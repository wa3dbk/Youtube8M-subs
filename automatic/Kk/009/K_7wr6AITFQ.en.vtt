00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:08.980 
what's tomorrow what's going to happen

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:10.680 
what's tomorrow what's going to happen
here<00:00:09.010> tomorrow<00:00:09.790> we're<00:00:10.420> going<00:00:10.510> to<00:00:10.629> be

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:10.690 
here tomorrow we're going to be

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:12.539 
here tomorrow we're going to be
converting<00:00:11.230> a<00:00:11.440> hybrid<00:00:11.860> vehicle<00:00:12.219> into<00:00:12.490> a

00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:12.549 
converting a hybrid vehicle into a

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:14.670 
converting a hybrid vehicle into a
plug-in<00:00:12.820> electric<00:00:13.209> hybrid<00:00:13.840> vehicle<00:00:14.260> which<00:00:14.530> is

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:14.680 
plug-in electric hybrid vehicle which is

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:16.529 
plug-in electric hybrid vehicle which is
very<00:00:14.889> exciting<00:00:14.980> because<00:00:15.400> the<00:00:15.760> auto<00:00:15.969> industry

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:16.539 
very exciting because the auto industry

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:18.750 
very exciting because the auto industry
keeps<00:00:17.080> saying<00:00:17.350> that<00:00:17.529> they<00:00:17.619> can't<00:00:17.920> do<00:00:18.160> it<00:00:18.340> and

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:18.760 
keeps saying that they can't do it and

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:20.250 
keeps saying that they can't do it and
they're<00:00:19.000> going<00:00:19.090> to<00:00:19.150> they<00:00:19.449> started<00:00:19.990> taking

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:20.260 
they're going to they started taking

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:21.599 
they're going to they started taking
these<00:00:20.350> little<00:00:20.619> baby<00:00:20.800> steps<00:00:21.100> and<00:00:21.250> then<00:00:21.310> oh<00:00:21.460> they

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:21.609 
these little baby steps and then oh they

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:23.009 
these little baby steps and then oh they
have<00:00:21.730> one<00:00:21.910> other<00:00:22.029> road<00:00:22.300> here<00:00:22.330> and<00:00:22.689> what<00:00:22.779> on<00:00:22.900> the

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:23.019 
have one other road here and what on the

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:25.170 
have one other road here and what on the
road<00:00:23.170> there<00:00:23.380> but<00:00:23.950> I<00:00:24.130> mean<00:00:24.400> there's<00:00:24.850> a<00:00:24.940> few

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:25.180 
road there but I mean there's a few

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:27.090 
road there but I mean there's a few
dozen<00:00:25.330> I<00:00:25.539> booked<00:00:25.690> on<00:00:25.810> the<00:00:25.960> road<00:00:26.140> already<00:00:26.380> the

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:27.100 
dozen I booked on the road already the

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.859 
dozen I booked on the road already the
people<00:00:27.400> fill<00:00:27.640> in<00:00:27.730> their<00:00:27.850> garages<00:00:28.119> so<00:00:28.480> I<00:00:28.510> think

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:28.869 
people fill in their garages so I think

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:31.109 
people fill in their garages so I think
that<00:00:29.080> if<00:00:29.320> we<00:00:29.590> can<00:00:29.770> build<00:00:30.130> plug-in<00:00:30.970> electric

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:31.119 
that if we can build plug-in electric

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:33.299 
that if we can build plug-in electric
hybrids<00:00:31.750> on<00:00:32.259> that<00:00:32.469> street<00:00:32.829> corner<00:00:32.860> right

00:00:33.299 --> 00:00:33.309 
hybrids on that street corner right

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:35.069 
hybrids on that street corner right
there<00:00:33.340> then<00:00:33.969> these<00:00:34.149> auto<00:00:34.390> companies<00:00:34.840> can

00:00:35.069 --> 00:00:35.079 
there then these auto companies can

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:36.180 
there then these auto companies can
certainly<00:00:35.410> build<00:00:35.620> a<00:00:35.770> plug-in<00:00:36.039> electric

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:36.190 
certainly build a plug-in electric

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:38.990 
certainly build a plug-in electric
hybrids<00:00:36.760> in<00:00:37.030> there

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
hybrids in there

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.510 
hybrids in there
out<00:00:39.510> of<00:00:39.720> the<00:00:39.810> 16<00:00:40.260> million<00:00:40.530> cars<00:00:40.980> sold<00:00:41.280> each

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
out of the 16 million cars sold each

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:47.390 
out of the 16 million cars sold each
year<00:00:41.550> how<00:00:42.540> many<00:00:42.750> are<00:00:42.840> plugins<00:00:43.170> oh<00:00:43.850> not<00:00:46.400> yet

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:47.400 
year how many are plugins oh not yet

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.390 
year how many are plugins oh not yet
you're<00:00:47.700> gonna<00:00:47.850> build<00:00:48.150> one<00:00:48.239> right<00:00:48.570> here<00:00:49.309> so<00:00:50.309> the

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:50.400 
you're gonna build one right here so the

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.130 
you're gonna build one right here so the
auto<00:00:50.550> companies<00:00:50.790> say<00:00:51.239> they<00:00:51.270> can't<00:00:51.690> build<00:00:51.960> them

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
auto companies say they can't build them

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:59.720 
auto companies say they can't build them
Oh<00:00:53.120> 16<00:00:54.120> million<00:00:54.420> cars<00:00:58.280> we're<00:00:59.280> gonna<00:00:59.400> convert

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
Oh 16 million cars we're gonna convert

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:00.830 
Oh 16 million cars we're gonna convert
one<00:00:59.879> of<00:00:59.970> those<00:01:00.090> diapers<00:01:00.360> into<00:01:00.570> a<00:01:00.629> plug-in

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
one of those diapers into a plug-in

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.210 
one of those diapers into a plug-in
something<00:01:01.320> that<00:01:01.410> they<00:01:01.530> say<00:01:01.739> is<00:01:01.769> the

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:02.220 
something that they say is the

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:04.790 
something that they say is the
technology<00:01:02.670> that<00:01:02.940> we<00:01:03.090> may<00:01:03.360> is<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.989> future<00:01:04.260> but

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:04.800 
technology that we may is the future but

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.460 
technology that we may is the future but
right<00:01:04.860> now<00:01:05.190> people<00:01:05.729> want<00:01:05.880> their<00:01:06.150> big<00:01:06.750> cars

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
right now people want their big cars

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.320 
right now people want their big cars
their<00:01:07.890> conventional<00:01:08.369> cars<00:01:08.640> when<00:01:08.970> all<00:01:09.150> these

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
their conventional cars when all these

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.940 
their conventional cars when all these
polls<00:01:09.600> show<00:01:09.840> that<00:01:09.869> people<00:01:10.200> want<00:01:10.500> cleaner<00:01:10.800> more

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
polls show that people want cleaner more

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.920 
polls show that people want cleaner more
fuel-efficient<00:01:11.580> cars<00:01:11.790> and<00:01:12.060> auto<00:01:12.479> companies

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
fuel-efficient cars and auto companies

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.170 
fuel-efficient cars and auto companies
simply<00:01:13.140> to<00:01:13.320> start<00:01:13.590> giving<00:01:13.880> but<00:01:14.880> you<00:01:14.970> know<00:01:15.090> they

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
simply to start giving but you know they

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.580 
simply to start giving but you know they
say<00:01:15.210> that<00:01:15.600> there's<00:01:15.780> no<00:01:15.990> such<00:01:16.200> thing<00:01:16.229> as<00:01:16.470> a

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
say that there's no such thing as a

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.230 
say that there's no such thing as a
plug-in<00:01:16.920> but<00:01:17.280> what's<00:01:17.460> that<00:01:17.700> thing<00:01:17.940> over<00:01:18.090> there

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
plug-in but what's that thing over there

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:24.200 
plug-in but what's that thing over there
that<00:01:19.080> looks<00:01:19.350> like<00:01:19.500> a<00:01:19.560> Toyota<00:01:20.130> even<00:01:22.670> if<00:01:23.670> they

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
that looks like a Toyota even if they

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.930 
that looks like a Toyota even if they
say<00:01:24.479> they<00:01:24.750> can't<00:01:25.050> make<00:01:25.229> a<00:01:25.259> plug-in<00:01:25.619> hybrid<00:01:25.940> but

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:26.940 
say they can't make a plug-in hybrid but

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:28.520 
say they can't make a plug-in hybrid but
there's<00:01:27.180> a<00:01:27.270> real<00:01:27.509> you<00:01:27.690> mean<00:01:27.810> it's<00:01:27.960> easier<00:01:28.380> to

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
there's a real you mean it's easier to

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.560 
there's a real you mean it's easier to
make<00:01:28.710> a<00:01:28.740> plug<00:01:29.130> in<00:01:29.340> EV<00:01:29.700> than<00:01:29.970> it<00:01:30.090> is<00:01:30.210> to<00:01:30.390> make<00:01:30.509> a

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
make a plug in EV than it is to make a

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.190 
make a plug in EV than it is to make a
plug-in<00:01:30.869> hybrids<00:01:31.470> could<00:01:32.070> that<00:01:32.220> be<00:01:33.050> so<00:01:34.050> they

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
plug-in hybrids could that be so they

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.770 
plug-in hybrids could that be so they
can<00:01:34.470> make<00:01:34.649> a<00:01:34.710> plug-in<00:01:35.100> hybrid<00:01:35.490> I<00:01:36.360> mean<00:01:36.660> they

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
can make a plug-in hybrid I mean they

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.300 
can make a plug-in hybrid I mean they
can<00:01:36.960> make<00:01:37.140> a<00:01:37.170> hybrid<00:01:37.619> which<00:01:37.740> is<00:01:37.860> just<00:01:37.920> a<00:01:38.039> little

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
can make a hybrid which is just a little

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.310 
can make a hybrid which is just a little
bigger<00:01:38.460> battery<00:01:38.910> that<00:01:39.090> could<00:01:39.210> plug<00:01:39.450> in<00:01:39.690> but

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
bigger battery that could plug in but

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.290 
bigger battery that could plug in but
but<00:01:40.590> they<00:01:40.770> why<00:01:40.950> did<00:01:41.100> they<00:01:41.190> stop<00:01:41.250> making<00:01:41.610> this

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:43.300 
but they why did they stop making this

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.300 
but they why did they stop making this
they<00:01:43.810> don't<00:01:43.960> want<00:01:44.020> us<00:01:44.170> to<00:01:44.320> him

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
they don't want us to him

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.359 
they don't want us to him
Harvey<00:01:46.090> I<00:01:46.119> say<00:01:46.570> there<00:01:46.810> they<00:01:47.680> want<00:01:47.890> to<00:01:48.009> make<00:01:48.159> the

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:48.369 
Harvey I say there they want to make the

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:50.370 
Harvey I say there they want to make the
world<00:01:48.790> a<00:01:49.240> cleaner<00:01:49.299> greener<00:01:49.750> place<00:01:50.049> and<00:01:50.290> when

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.380 
world a cleaner greener place and when

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.080 
world a cleaner greener place and when
it<00:01:50.500> comes<00:01:50.649> down<00:01:50.829> to<00:01:51.100> it<00:01:51.220> they're<00:01:51.729> not<00:01:51.909> willing

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.090 
it comes down to it they're not willing

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:53.399 
it comes down to it they're not willing
to<00:01:52.270> put<00:01:52.479> their<00:01:52.600> money<00:01:52.689> where<00:01:52.840> their<00:01:52.990> mouth<00:01:53.200> is
