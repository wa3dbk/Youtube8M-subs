00:04:25.249 --> 00:04:25.259 
too worried about dying foot then blow

00:04:25.259 --> 00:04:26.900 
too worried about dying foot then blow
his<00:04:25.410> arm<00:04:25.590> up<00:04:25.860> before<00:04:26.220> he<00:04:26.280> can<00:04:26.430> hurt<00:04:26.550> me<00:04:26.699> too<00:04:26.880> bad

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
his arm up before he can hurt me too bad

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:29.480 
his arm up before he can hurt me too bad
as<00:04:27.539> you<00:04:28.020> can<00:04:28.139> see<00:04:28.289> if<00:04:28.410> he<00:04:28.530> does<00:04:28.770> manage<00:04:29.190> to<00:04:29.220> hurt

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490 
as you can see if he does manage to hurt

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.490 
as you can see if he does manage to hurt
me<00:04:29.699> we're<00:04:30.000> just<00:04:30.030> going<00:04:30.330> to<00:04:30.360> get<00:04:30.570> our<00:04:30.720> health

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500 
me we're just going to get our health

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:35.180 
me we're just going to get our health
back<00:04:31.740> from<00:04:31.949> to<00:04:32.070> the<00:04:32.160> first<00:04:32.340> light<00:04:32.669> of<00:04:32.699> all<00:04:34.190> it

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:35.190 
back from to the first light of all it

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:37.010 
back from to the first light of all it
takes<00:04:35.370> a<00:04:35.460> second<00:04:35.820> for<00:04:35.849> a<00:04:36.000> survivor<00:04:36.330> come<00:04:36.570> kick

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020 
takes a second for a survivor come kick

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:38.659 
takes a second for a survivor come kick
in<00:04:37.199> but<00:04:37.470> then<00:04:37.620> we're<00:04:37.770> back<00:04:37.949> above<00:04:38.190> health<00:04:38.460> gate

00:04:38.659 --> 00:04:38.669 
in but then we're back above health gate

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:40.310 
in but then we're back above health gate
that's<00:04:39.030> cool<00:04:39.360> that's<00:04:39.750> what<00:04:39.900> we're<00:04:40.050> looking

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:40.320 
that's cool that's what we're looking

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:44.899 
that's cool that's what we're looking
for

00:04:44.899 --> 00:04:44.909 

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:49.019 

back<00:04:45.909> up<00:04:46.119> of<00:04:46.240> health<00:04:46.509> gate<00:04:47.249> and<00:04:48.249> this<00:04:48.729> works

00:04:49.019 --> 00:04:49.029 
back up of health gate and this works

00:04:49.029 --> 00:04:51.179 
back up of health gate and this works
it'll<00:04:49.419> keep<00:04:49.629> us<00:04:49.869> surviving<00:04:50.349> a<00:04:50.589> little<00:04:50.800> bit<00:04:50.979> I

it'll keep us surviving a little bit I
didn't<00:04:51.610> realize<00:04:51.909> I<00:04:52.089> had<00:04:52.330> a<00:04:52.860> singularity

didn't realize I had a singularity
grenade<00:04:54.309> on<00:04:54.490> okay<00:04:55.059> that's<00:04:55.869> kind<00:04:56.110> of<00:04:56.139> silly

00:04:58.730 --> 00:04:58.740 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:05.809

00:05:05.819 --> 00:05:09.170 

that<00:05:06.819> was<00:05:06.969> a<00:05:06.999> joke<00:05:07.270> you<00:05:08.110> guys<00:05:08.139> know<00:05:08.499> Nate

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:09.180 
that was a joke you guys know Nate

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:12.239 
that was a joke you guys know Nate

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:24.929 
trial and error
it'd<00:05:22.990> be<00:05:23.499> kind<00:05:23.709> of<00:05:23.740> hard<00:05:23.800> to<00:05:24.069> find<00:05:24.430> the<00:05:24.610> exact

00:05:24.929 --> 00:05:24.939 
it'd be kind of hard to find the exact

it'd be kind of hard to find the exact
right<00:05:25.149> combination<00:05:25.809> so<00:05:26.050> it<00:05:26.110> makes<00:05:26.619> it<00:05:26.770> a

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:26.830 
right combination so it makes it a

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:28.799 
right combination so it makes it a
little<00:05:26.979> bit<00:05:27.219> easier<00:05:27.610> otherwise<00:05:28.209> I'd

00:05:28.799 --> 00:05:28.809 
little bit easier otherwise I'd

00:05:28.809 --> 00:05:32.489 
little bit easier otherwise I'd
recommend<00:05:29.379> you<00:05:29.770> know<00:05:29.889> just<00:05:30.699> saving<00:05:31.029> your<00:05:32.020> op8

00:05:32.489 --> 00:05:32.499 
recommend you know just saving your op8

00:05:32.499 --> 00:05:36.719 
recommend you know just saving your op8

00:05:43.799 --> 00:05:43.809 
combination one that works for you only

00:05:43.809 --> 00:05:45.869 
combination one that works for you only
certainly<00:05:44.379> one<00:05:44.559> to<00:05:44.740> work<00:05:44.949> obviously<00:05:45.189> so<00:05:45.819> you

00:05:45.869 --> 00:05:45.879 
certainly one to work obviously so you

00:05:45.879 --> 00:05:51.869 
certainly one to work obviously so you
got<00:05:46.089> to<00:05:46.180> be<00:05:46.300> a<00:05:46.509> little<00:05:46.779> bit<00:05:46.990> cautious<00:05:50.699> you<00:05:51.699> need

00:05:51.869 --> 00:05:51.879 
got to be a little bit cautious you need

00:05:51.879 --> 00:05:55.810 
got to be a little bit cautious you need

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:25.400 
my friend AIDS of Sarah pointed this out

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:27.250 
my friend AIDS of Sarah pointed this out
to<00:06:25.460> me<00:06:25.700> he<00:06:26.030> had<00:06:26.150> an<00:06:26.270> idea<00:06:26.570> for<00:06:26.630> this<00:06:26.930> even

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:27.260 
to me he had an idea for this even

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:30.040 
to me he had an idea for this even
before<00:06:27.410> the<00:06:27.800> Opie<00:06:28.100> levels<00:06:28.430> existed<00:06:29.000> but<00:06:29.660> he

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:30.050 
before the Opie levels existed but he

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:32.310 
before the Opie levels existed but he
was<00:06:30.140> the<00:06:30.260> one<00:06:30.410> who<00:06:30.470> did<00:06:30.800> the<00:06:30.920> thinking<00:06:31.310> on<00:06:31.400> this

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:32.320 
was the one who did the thinking on this

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:37.170 
was the one who did the thinking on this
particular<00:06:33.320> setup<00:06:33.940> it'll<00:06:34.940> also<00:06:35.090> work<00:06:35.330> for

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:37.180 
particular setup it'll also work for

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:42.040 
particular setup it'll also work for
your<00:06:38.890> sirens<00:06:39.890> probably<00:06:40.490> as<00:06:40.700> well<00:06:41.060> as<00:06:41.390> maybe

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:42.050 
your sirens probably as well as maybe

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:44.830 
your sirens probably as well as maybe
even<00:06:42.380> the<00:06:42.470> guns<00:06:42.650> are<00:06:42.890> so<00:06:43.790> good<00:06:43.970> luck<00:06:44.180> guys<00:06:44.480> I

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:44.840 
even the guns are so good luck guys I
