00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
even out here before is there anything

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
specifically and some early that you

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.540 
specifically and some early that you
look<00:00:51.539> forward<00:00:51.870> to<00:00:52.020> that<00:00:52.050> you<00:00:52.410> will<00:00:53.160> be<00:00:53.399> doing

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
look forward to that you will be doing

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.020 
look forward to that you will be doing
um<00:00:53.940> I<00:00:54.809> think<00:00:54.930> it's<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.350> competiveness<00:00:55.770> uh

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.030 
um I think it's the competiveness uh

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.160 
um I think it's the competiveness uh
everybody's<00:00:57.030> gonna<00:00:57.120> be<00:00:57.180> real<00:00:57.420> competitive<00:00:57.930> I

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
everybody's gonna be real competitive I

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.229 
everybody's gonna be real competitive I
mean<00:00:58.500> I'm<00:00:58.680> everybody's<00:00:59.609> looking<00:00:59.820> for<00:00:59.969> a<00:01:00.000> job

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
mean I'm everybody's looking for a job

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.450 
mean I'm everybody's looking for a job
and<00:01:00.420> so<00:01:00.600> I<00:01:01.079> think<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.530> tensity<00:01:02.129> level<00:01:02.399> is

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
and so I think the tensity level is

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.520 
and so I think the tensity level is
gonna<00:01:02.609> be<00:01:02.730> hot<00:01:02.910> it's<00:01:03.600> obviously<00:01:03.989> hard<00:01:04.170> to<00:01:04.350> get

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
gonna be hot it's obviously hard to get

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.289 
gonna be hot it's obviously hard to get
a<00:01:04.769> lot<00:01:05.280> of<00:01:05.309> guys<00:01:05.489> you<00:01:05.640> never<00:01:05.760> really<00:01:06.000> played<00:01:06.150> on

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
a lot of guys you never really played on

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:07.580 
a lot of guys you never really played on
the<00:01:06.390> same<00:01:06.540> team<00:01:06.780> together<00:01:07.020> in<00:01:07.260> such<00:01:07.380> a<00:01:07.439> short

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
the same team together in such a short

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:08.510 
the same team together in such a short
period<00:01:07.710> of<00:01:07.890> time<00:01:07.950> what<00:01:08.100> do<00:01:08.159> you<00:01:08.220> think<00:01:08.340> is<00:01:08.430> the

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
period of time what do you think is the

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.130 
period of time what do you think is the
biggest<00:01:08.610> challenge<00:01:09.150> that<00:01:09.210> coach<00:01:09.510> faces<00:01:09.960> are

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
biggest challenge that coach faces are

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.770 
biggest challenge that coach faces are
in<00:01:10.979> doing<00:01:11.280> so<00:01:11.490> I'm<00:01:11.970> just<00:01:12.450> getting<00:01:12.720> that

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
in doing so I'm just getting that

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.780 
in doing so I'm just getting that
chemistry<00:01:13.200> down<00:01:13.380> I<00:01:13.530> mean<00:01:13.740> it's<00:01:13.920> it's<00:01:14.400> hard<00:01:14.670> to

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
chemistry down I mean it's it's hard to

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.240 
chemistry down I mean it's it's hard to
go<00:01:14.909> out<00:01:15.119> and<00:01:15.659> play<00:01:15.900> with<00:01:16.130> people<00:01:17.130> that<00:01:17.189> you

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
go out and play with people that you

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.609 
go out and play with people that you
haven't<00:01:17.549> played<00:01:17.700> with<00:01:17.729> before<00:01:18.000> and<00:01:18.240> so<00:01:18.540> on<00:01:18.689> and

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
haven't played with before and so on and

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.170 
haven't played with before and so on and
for<00:01:19.860> us<00:01:19.979> I<00:01:20.130> think<00:01:20.159> that's<00:01:20.520> what<00:01:20.610> we<00:01:20.700> try<00:01:20.970> to<00:01:21.000> do

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
for us I think that's what we try to do

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.520 
for us I think that's what we try to do
with<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:21.420> minicamp<00:01:21.810> we<00:01:21.960> was<00:01:22.080> just<00:01:22.170> trying<00:01:22.439> to

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
with the minicamp we was just trying to

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.130 
with the minicamp we was just trying to
get<00:01:23.220> familiarized<00:01:23.759> with<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:23.970> plays<00:01:24.240> and<00:01:24.270> and

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
get familiarized with the plays and and

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.590 
get familiarized with the plays and and
and<00:01:25.920> how<00:01:26.369> people<00:01:26.520> how<00:01:26.880> each<00:01:27.060> other<00:01:27.150> play<00:01:27.420> and

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
and how people how each other play and

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.480 
and how people how each other play and
so<00:01:27.750> on<00:01:27.960> that's<00:01:28.619> probably<00:01:28.799> the<00:01:29.130> biggest<00:01:29.250> thing

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
so on that's probably the biggest thing

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.370 
so on that's probably the biggest thing
it's<00:01:29.790> just<00:01:29.970> getting<00:01:30.720> that<00:01:30.840> chemistry<00:01:31.200> level

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
it's just getting that chemistry level

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.590 
it's just getting that chemistry level
is<00:01:31.950> there<00:01:32.070> anybody<00:01:32.220> out<00:01:32.640> here<00:01:32.790> who<00:01:33.119> hadn't<00:01:33.479> met

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
is there anybody out here who hadn't met

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.330 
is there anybody out here who hadn't met
before<00:01:33.630> who<00:01:34.170> who's<00:01:34.470> impressed<00:01:34.740> you<00:01:35.009> put<00:01:35.189> in

before who who's impressed you put in

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.410 
before who who's impressed you put in
particular<00:01:35.960> um<00:01:37.130> we<00:01:38.130> have<00:01:38.250> a<00:01:38.280> lot<00:01:38.700> on<00:01:38.909> this

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
particular um we have a lot on this

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.960 
particular um we have a lot on this
tennis<00:01:39.840> team<00:01:40.020> so<00:01:40.170> far<00:01:40.200> on<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:40.829> Hornets<00:01:41.130> um<00:01:41.460> a

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
tennis team so far on the Hornets um a

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.539 
tennis team so far on the Hornets um a
lot<00:01:42.420> I<00:01:42.689> haven't<00:01:43.290> said<00:01:43.470> first<00:01:44.130> chance<00:01:44.340> to<00:01:44.430> claim

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
lot I haven't said first chance to claim

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.819 
lot I haven't said first chance to claim
lost<00:01:44.759> on<00:01:45.030> me<00:01:45.149> I'm<00:01:45.479> but<00:01:45.720> he's<00:01:45.960> he's<00:01:46.409> quick<00:01:46.680> with

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
lost on me I'm but he's he's quick with

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.740 
lost on me I'm but he's he's quick with
the<00:01:46.860> bar<00:01:47.130> he's<00:01:47.759> probably<00:01:47.970> one<00:01:48.630> of<00:01:48.659> the

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
the bar he's probably one of the

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.090 
the bar he's probably one of the
quickest<00:01:49.020> up<00:01:49.200> people<00:01:49.500> asking<00:01:49.740> with<00:01:49.829> the<00:01:49.920> ball

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
quickest up people asking with the ball

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.859 
quickest up people asking with the ball
so<00:01:50.430> um<00:01:50.670> I<00:01:51.000> think<00:01:51.210> that's<00:01:51.570> something<00:01:51.720> that

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
so um I think that's something that

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.600 
so um I think that's something that
stood<00:01:52.259> out<00:01:52.320> to<00:01:52.439> me<00:01:52.590> how<00:01:52.799> how<00:01:53.009> quick<00:01:53.250> he<00:01:53.369> is<00:01:53.399> with

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
stood out to me how how quick he is with

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:54.850 
stood out to me how how quick he is with
the<00:01:53.640> ball<00:01:53.880> um

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 
the ball um

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:56.470 
the ball um
he<00:01:55.430> wasn't<00:01:55.700> he's<00:01:55.790> not<00:01:55.910> really<00:01:56.030> a<00:01:56.120> natural

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:56.480 
he wasn't he's not really a natural

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:57.670 
he wasn't he's not really a natural
point<00:01:56.660> he<00:01:56.750> hasn't<00:01:56.960> played<00:01:57.050> that<00:01:57.320> position<00:01:57.410> for

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:57.680 
point he hasn't played that position for

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.160 
point he hasn't played that position for
in<00:01:57.980> college<00:01:58.280> especially<00:01:58.570> and<00:01:59.570> what<00:01:59.780> is<00:01:59.870> it<00:01:59.900> you

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:02.770 
know because you've played both guard
positions<00:02:01.640> what<00:02:01.790> what<00:02:02.030> is<00:02:02.120> the<00:02:02.270> challenging

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
positions what what is the challenging

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.390 
positions what what is the challenging
moving<00:02:03.080> to<00:02:03.230> play<00:02:03.440> more<00:02:03.650> of<00:02:03.710> a<00:02:03.800> point<00:02:03.950> guard<00:02:04.160> and

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:04.400 
moving to play more of a point guard and

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:05.950 
moving to play more of a point guard and
in<00:02:04.640> the<00:02:04.790> point<00:02:05.090> guard<00:02:05.240> position<00:02:05.270> as<00:02:05.660> opposed

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960 
in the point guard position as opposed

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.760 
in the point guard position as opposed
to<00:02:06.490> the<00:02:07.490> challenges<00:02:07.940> I<00:02:08.000> mean<00:02:08.440> that's<00:02:09.440> when<00:02:09.649> me

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:09.770 
to the challenges I mean that's when me

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:12.130 
to the challenges I mean that's when me
I<00:02:09.800> had<00:02:10.100> I<00:02:10.130> had<00:02:10.310> to<00:02:10.820> the<00:02:10.970> problem<00:02:11.300> I<00:02:11.360> mean<00:02:11.540> I<00:02:11.750> was

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
I had I had to the problem I mean I was

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.380 
I had I had to the problem I mean I was
always<00:02:12.260> a<00:02:12.430> score<00:02:13.430> in<00:02:13.610> college<00:02:13.940> I<00:02:14.060> mean<00:02:14.180> I<00:02:14.210> play

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
always a score in college I mean I play

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.750 
always a score in college I mean I play
the<00:02:14.450> two<00:02:14.690> so<00:02:14.930> I've<00:02:15.080> always<00:02:15.410> good<00:02:15.800> score<00:02:16.490> score

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
the two so I've always good score score

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.370 
the two so I've always good score score
score<00:02:16.790> my<00:02:17.180> minds<00:02:17.690> and<00:02:17.810> that's<00:02:17.960> a<00:02:18.020> point<00:02:18.230> guard

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
score my minds and that's a point guard

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.050 
score my minds and that's a point guard
you<00:02:18.920> gotta<00:02:19.070> get<00:02:19.190> your<00:02:19.310> teammates<00:02:19.700> involved

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
you gotta get your teammates involved

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.510 
you gotta get your teammates involved
and<00:02:20.420> so<00:02:20.570> on<00:02:20.780> I<00:02:21.080> think<00:02:21.560> that's<00:02:21.709> was<00:02:22.100> the<00:02:22.250> hardest

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:22.520 
and so on I think that's was the hardest

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:23.949 
and so on I think that's was the hardest
thing<00:02:22.610> for<00:02:22.820> me<00:02:22.880> it's<00:02:23.150> just<00:02:23.240> controlling<00:02:23.780> my

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:23.959 
thing for me it's just controlling my

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:26.440 
thing for me it's just controlling my
team<00:02:24.200> and<00:02:24.560> making<00:02:24.860> sure<00:02:25.010> that<00:02:25.160> I'm<00:02:25.280> set<00:02:26.180> aside

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
team and making sure that I'm set aside

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.300 
team and making sure that I'm set aside
everybody<00:02:26.750> out<00:02:26.990> there<00:02:27.200> is<00:02:27.380> it<00:02:27.650> difficult<00:02:27.920> I

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
everybody out there is it difficult I

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.430 
everybody out there is it difficult I
mean<00:02:28.430> I<00:02:28.490> imagined<00:02:28.820> it<00:02:28.880> to<00:02:28.940> be<00:02:29.090> a<00:02:29.810> score<00:02:30.200> first

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
mean I imagined it to be a score first

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:31.600 
mean I imagined it to be a score first
guy<00:02:30.650> every<00:02:30.920> time<00:02:30.980> you<00:02:31.130> get<00:02:31.190> the<00:02:31.280> boy<00:02:31.340> from

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
guy every time you get the boy from

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:32.830 
guy every time you get the boy from
score<00:02:31.790> and<00:02:31.880> then<00:02:31.970> all<00:02:32.090> of<00:02:32.120> a<00:02:32.180> sudden<00:02:32.209> you

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
score and then all of a sudden you

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.000 
score and then all of a sudden you
realize<00:02:32.870> even<00:02:33.290> if<00:02:33.350> you<00:02:33.410> haven't<00:02:33.620> opened<00:02:33.830> shot

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
realize even if you haven't opened shot

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:35.229 
realize even if you haven't opened shot
sometimes<00:02:34.250> it's<00:02:34.370> better<00:02:34.520> to<00:02:34.610> pass<00:02:34.880> it<00:02:35.090> i<00:02:35.150> mean

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239 
sometimes it's better to pass it i mean
