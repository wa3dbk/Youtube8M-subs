mains cable in there in the bottom and
there<00:01:37.240> we<00:01:37.360> have<00:01:37.570> the<00:01:38.259> new<00:01:38.470> Mac<00:01:38.649> Pro<00:01:38.679> wrapped<00:01:40.500> in

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:41.500 
there we have the new Mac Pro wrapped in

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.820 
there we have the new Mac Pro wrapped in
plastic<00:01:41.759> it's<00:01:42.759> actually<00:01:43.350> slightly<00:01:44.350> heavier

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:44.830 
plastic it's actually slightly heavier

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:46.830 
plastic it's actually slightly heavier
than<00:01:44.890> I<00:01:45.069> thought<00:01:45.250> it<00:01:45.429> would<00:01:45.520> be<00:01:45.670> and<00:01:46.569> we<00:01:46.690> don't

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
than I thought it would be and we don't

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.139 
than I thought it would be and we don't
know<00:01:46.959> the<00:01:47.080> form<00:01:47.319> factor<00:01:47.530> but<00:01:48.149> slightly

00:01:49.139 --> 00:01:49.149 
know the form factor but slightly

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:50.550 
know the form factor but slightly
heavier<00:01:49.539> than<00:01:49.569> I<00:01:49.720> thought<00:01:49.750> it'd<00:01:49.990> be<00:01:50.020> it's<00:01:50.380> kind

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:50.560 
heavier than I thought it'd be it's kind

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:57.740 
heavier than I thought it'd be it's kind
of<00:01:50.619> weighted<00:01:50.920> on<00:01:51.009> the<00:01:51.130> base<00:01:51.420> there's<00:01:52.420> as<00:01:52.720> well

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:06.620 

undo<00:01:58.750> this<00:01:59.039> pick<00:02:00.039> it<00:02:00.159> up<00:02:00.250> like<00:02:00.369> that<00:02:00.490> because

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:12.210 

and<00:02:07.630> there<00:02:07.929> we<00:02:08.110> go<00:02:09.060> one<00:02:10.060> a<00:02:10.090> new<00:02:10.420> Mac<00:02:10.989> Pro<00:02:11.220> ready

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
and there we go one a new Mac Pro ready

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.109 
and there we go one a new Mac Pro ready
for<00:02:12.489> plugging<00:02:12.819> in<00:02:12.940> and<00:02:13.180> testing
