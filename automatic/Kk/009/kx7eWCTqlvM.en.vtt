00:00:05.429 --> 00:00:05.439 
hi welcome back to Genesis custom sabers

00:00:05.439 --> 00:00:07.800 
hi welcome back to Genesis custom sabers
and<00:00:05.649> this<00:00:05.799> is<00:00:06.100> a<00:00:06.310> new<00:00:06.790> saber<00:00:07.450> I've<00:00:07.629> just

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:07.810 
and this is a new saber I've just

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:09.480 
and this is a new saber I've just
constructed<00:00:08.320> it's<00:00:08.500> my<00:00:08.620> last<00:00:08.860> commissioned

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:09.490 
constructed it's my last commissioned

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:12.960 
constructed it's my last commissioned
piece<00:00:09.760> of<00:00:09.970> 2013<00:00:10.660> so<00:00:11.530> this<00:00:11.710> is<00:00:11.920> a<00:00:11.970> high-end

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:12.970

this<00:01:53.590> now<00:01:54.430> if<00:01:54.549> the<00:01:54.670> blade<00:01:54.850> fits<00:01:55.090> tight<00:01:55.329> you

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
this now if the blade fits tight you

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.130 
this now if the blade fits tight you
always<00:01:55.689> want<00:01:55.869> to<00:01:55.960> you<00:01:56.289> always<00:01:56.380> want<00:01:56.619> to<00:01:56.680> rotate

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:05.009 
as you can see I'll start unscrewing
this<00:04:03.430> part<00:04:03.700> of<00:04:03.790> the<00:04:03.849> saber<00:04:04.030> and<00:04:04.599> you<00:04:04.689> can<00:04:04.840> see

00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:05.019 
this part of the saber and you can see

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:07.110 
this part of the saber and you can see
that<00:04:05.200> that<00:04:05.650> it<00:04:05.769> would<00:04:05.889> pinch<00:04:06.159> the<00:04:06.609> Kilkee<00:04:06.970> and

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 
that that it would pinch the Kilkee and

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.179 
that that it would pinch the Kilkee and
the<00:04:07.180> recharge<00:04:07.510> point<00:04:07.780> there<00:04:07.959> so<00:04:08.560> the<00:04:08.859> pommel

00:04:09.179 --> 00:04:09.189 
the recharge point there so the pommel

00:04:09.189 --> 00:04:11.399 
the recharge point there so the pommel
can<00:04:09.340> unthread<00:04:09.669> or<00:04:09.790> not<00:04:09.939> but<00:04:10.209> no<00:04:10.329> leave<00:04:10.540> it<00:04:10.629> so

00:04:11.399 --> 00:04:11.409 
can unthread or not but no leave it so

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:13.800 
can unthread or not but no leave it so
well<00:04:11.879> unthread<00:04:12.879> the<00:04:13.120> bottom<00:04:13.480> half<00:04:13.629> of<00:04:13.750> the

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 
well unthread the bottom half of the

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:16.409 
well unthread the bottom half of the
saber<00:04:14.370> you<00:04:15.370> see<00:04:15.549> there's<00:04:15.730> a<00:04:15.790> set<00:04:16.000> screw<00:04:16.209> there

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:16.419 
saber you see there's a set screw there

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:20.819 
saber you see there's a set screw there
that<00:04:16.599> holds<00:04:17.079> in<00:04:18.419> the<00:04:19.419> inner<00:04:19.900> chassis<00:04:20.440> so<00:04:20.620> if

00:04:20.819 --> 00:04:20.829 
that holds in the inner chassis so if

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:22.260 
that holds in the inner chassis so if
for<00:04:21.039> whatever<00:04:21.160> reason<00:04:21.549> that<00:04:21.579> recharge<00:04:22.030> port

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270 
for whatever reason that recharge port

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.180 
for whatever reason that recharge port
ever<00:04:22.419> became<00:04:22.750> out<00:04:23.020> of<00:04:23.110> alignment<00:04:23.349> you<00:04:23.770> can

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:24.190 
ever became out of alignment you can

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:27.060 
ever became out of alignment you can
slightly<00:04:25.090> loosen<00:04:25.479> off<00:04:25.630> of<00:04:25.780> this<00:04:25.900> set<00:04:26.440> screw<00:04:26.710> in

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
slightly loosen off of this set screw in

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:28.439 
slightly loosen off of this set screw in
order<00:04:27.340> to<00:04:27.520> bring<00:04:27.729> it<00:04:27.880> back<00:04:28.000> in<00:04:28.150> line<00:04:28.270> with<00:04:28.419> that

00:04:28.439 --> 00:04:28.449 
order to bring it back in line with that

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:30.810 
order to bring it back in line with that
that<00:04:29.020> line<00:04:29.289> and<00:04:30.039> that<00:04:30.099> means<00:04:30.220> that<00:04:30.550> when<00:04:30.699> it's

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:30.820 
that line and that means that when it's

with<00:04:58.720> the<00:04:58.810> Jaina<00:04:59.050> say<00:04:59.320> we're<00:04:59.500> showing<00:04:59.740> how<00:05:00.070> to

00:05:00.089 --> 00:05:00.099 
with the Jaina say we're showing how to

with the Jaina say we're showing how to
how<00:05:00.789> to<00:05:00.849> do<00:05:01.060> that<00:05:01.229> with<00:05:02.229> this<00:05:02.380> saber<00:05:02.560> it's<00:05:02.740> that

00:05:02.879 --> 00:05:02.889 
how to do that with this saber it's that

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:04.680 
how to do that with this saber it's that
it's<00:05:03.039> a<00:05:03.099> track<00:05:03.340> cree<00:05:03.550> LED<00:05:03.699> so<00:05:04.150> you<00:05:04.210> don't<00:05:04.479> want

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:04.690 
it's a track cree LED so you don't want

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:09.390 
it's a track cree LED so you don't want
to<00:05:04.810> exceed<00:05:06.060> 1000<00:05:07.060> milliamps<00:05:07.599> on<00:05:07.780> an<00:05:08.620> LED<00:05:08.979> one

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:09.400 
to exceed 1000 milliamps on an LED one

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:13.260 
to exceed 1000 milliamps on an LED one
we're<00:05:10.210> led<00:05:10.570> to<00:05:10.990> LED<00:05:11.800> three<00:05:12.130> is<00:05:12.310> the<00:05:12.550> red<00:05:12.880> so<00:05:13.180> you

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:13.270 
we're led to LED three is the red so you

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:14.760 
we're led to LED three is the red so you
don't<00:05:13.419> want<00:05:13.570> to<00:05:13.659> exceed<00:05:13.900> seven<00:05:14.380> hundred

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:14.770 
don't want to exceed seven hundred

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:18.510 
don't want to exceed seven hundred
milliamps<00:05:15.070> on<00:05:15.430> the<00:05:16.030> red<00:05:16.500> so<00:05:17.500> anyway<00:05:18.400> as<00:05:18.460> you

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:18.520 
milliamps on the red so anyway as you

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:19.620 
milliamps on the red so anyway as you
can<00:05:18.639> see<00:05:18.760> the<00:05:18.849> bar<00:05:18.970> graph<00:05:19.180> there<00:05:19.330> that<00:05:19.449> shows

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:19.630 
can see the bar graph there that shows

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:21.510 
can see the bar graph there that shows
through<00:05:19.750> the<00:05:19.870> projection<00:05:20.680> window<00:05:21.070> this<00:05:21.370> is

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:21.520 
through the projection window this is

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.089 
through the projection window this is
your<00:05:21.669> crystal<00:05:22.000> focus<00:05:22.380> if<00:05:23.380> you<00:05:23.530> wanted<00:05:23.770> to<00:05:23.919> take

00:05:24.089 --> 00:05:24.099 
your crystal focus if you wanted to take

00:05:24.099 --> 00:05:25.920 
your crystal focus if you wanted to take

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:28.690 
would put the Kilkee in now the power

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:31.260 
would put the Kilkee in now the power
