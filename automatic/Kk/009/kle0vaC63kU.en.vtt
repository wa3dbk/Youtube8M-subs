 energy 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:53.640
 the machining technician is at the heart of mechanical companies 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.220
 he produces coins 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:56.810

 and also for a quality service 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.600

 the customer provides a drawing of the room that tea a program in 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.570
 the computer that controls the machine 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.200
 it defines the order the operations the choice of tools 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.800
 the speed of the machine 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.600
 all these parameters are of great importance 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.310
 to produce quickly well 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:53.540
 the machining technician to the responsibility of a machine conclusion 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.030
 Sylvain controls parts throughout the manufacturing process 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.630
 and improves the settings 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.630

 and manages the machine park entrusted to it 

00:02:11.139 --> 00:02:13.729
 not my technician skills 

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:16.709
