00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
I was like tweeting the whole thing it

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.360 
I was like tweeting the whole thing it
was<00:02:23.970> so<00:02:24.510> good<00:02:24.900> why<00:02:25.680> do<00:02:25.740> you<00:02:25.860> think<00:02:25.980> that<00:02:26.220> for

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
was so good why do you think that for

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.730 
was so good why do you think that for
the<00:02:26.490> front<00:02:26.730> page<00:02:26.940> so<00:02:27.330> for<00:02:28.080> the<00:02:28.170> front<00:02:28.590> page

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
the front page so for the front page

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:31.100 
the front page so for the front page
typically<00:02:29.220> we<00:02:29.340> always<00:02:29.610> put<00:02:29.790> on<00:02:29.880> the<00:02:30.030> news<00:02:30.270> but

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
typically we always put on the news but

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:32.660 
typically we always put on the news but
I<00:02:31.170> think<00:02:31.620> would<00:02:31.770> be<00:02:31.890> good<00:02:32.070> for<00:02:32.280> us<00:02:32.400> to<00:02:32.459> put<00:02:32.580> on

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
I think would be good for us to put on

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.760 
I think would be good for us to put on
something<00:02:32.910> more<00:02:33.209> relevant<00:02:33.360> honestly<00:02:34.290> I<00:02:34.530> think

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
something more relevant honestly I think

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:36.260 
something more relevant honestly I think
that's<00:02:35.010> what<00:02:35.190> we<00:02:35.280> need<00:02:35.430> to<00:02:35.490> do<00:02:35.610> yeah<00:02:35.880> and<00:02:36.120> then

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
that's what we need to do yeah and then

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:40.449 
that's what we need to do yeah and then
it<00:02:36.420> so<00:02:36.720> we<00:02:36.990> need<00:02:37.170> to<00:02:37.320> adapt<00:02:38.310> to<00:02:38.690> the<00:02:39.690> values<00:02:40.110> of

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 
it so we need to adapt to the values of

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:45.350 
it so we need to adapt to the values of
the<00:02:41.459> people<00:02:41.760> are<00:02:41.970> serving<00:02:42.770> maybe<00:02:43.770> in<00:02:44.130> all<00:02:44.370> next

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
the people are serving maybe in all next

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.590 
the people are serving maybe in all next
