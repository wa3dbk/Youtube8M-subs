the trickiest part of our installation
what<00:02:18.120> makes<00:02:18.330> this<00:02:18.540> tricky<00:02:18.870> are<00:02:19.440> the<00:02:19.709> tight

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
what makes this tricky are the tight

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.500 
what makes this tricky are the tight
quarters<00:02:20.129> we<00:02:20.400> have<00:02:20.519> to<00:02:20.670> work<00:02:20.819> in<00:02:21.030> and<00:02:21.239> the

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:43.910 
begin by loosening these two nuts now
that<00:02:42.629> we've<00:02:42.750> got<00:02:42.900> these<00:02:43.049> loose<00:02:43.290> let's<00:02:43.620> move<00:02:43.799> on

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:30.450 
going to be the FreePlay number two this

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:32.450 
going to be the FreePlay number two this
group<00:04:30.660> isn't<00:04:30.840> snapping<00:04:31.380> back<00:04:31.530> very<00:04:31.770> quick<00:04:32.160> so

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
group isn't snapping back very quick so

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:33.710 
group isn't snapping back very quick so
we're<00:04:32.550> going<00:04:32.640> to<00:04:32.730> have<00:04:32.820> to<00:04:32.910> modify<00:04:33.210> that<00:04:33.540> as

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
we're going to have to modify that as

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.560 
we're going to have to modify that as
well<00:04:34.580> these<00:04:35.580> major<00:04:35.850> adjustments<00:04:36.420> are<00:04:36.540> made

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:36.570 
well these major adjustments are made

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:38.480 
well these major adjustments are made
down<00:04:36.990> here<00:04:37.020> where<00:04:37.470> the<00:04:37.590> cables<00:04:37.980> attach<00:04:38.250> to<00:04:38.400> the

down here where the cables attach to the
carburetor<00:04:38.790> all<00:04:39.390> right<00:04:39.570> I<00:04:39.600> think<00:04:39.840> we<00:04:39.930> have<00:04:40.080> it

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:40.230
