00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:05.250
 hello to everyone who watches this video 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:08.130
 megaphone optima which acts as 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.590
 more expensive replacement megaphone login 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.269
 second generation proper 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:16.049
 if you look at both these devices 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:18.390
 next you can just compare them 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.220
 login dimensions with a diagonal of three 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.730
 half inch here 4 in general then 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.170
 the difference is noticeable at the same time at the price of differences 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.840
 between me is very large to leave there 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.550
 about 500 rubles when compared 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.250
 smartphones in the same versions that is 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.530
 this is offered with a connected model 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:38.450
 package megaphone xs 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:42.300
 which already depends on the regions 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:43.739
 terms of connecting prices and so on there are 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.829
 can simply evaluate how to 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.320
 device phone and fully assembled 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.579
 plastic what's the first thing 2 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.890
 Matt coating is used due to 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.350
 which does not appear especially scratches 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:59.280
 big my hands he's nice enough 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:01.350
 felt in size they are enough 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.690
 very similar to each other but 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.860
 why not a little bigger 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.689
 actually it is expressed in the fact that 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.080
 here 

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:11.640
 screen diagonal as told 4 inches in 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.590
 device based smartphone 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.979
 pusher can see it if 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.830
 let us remove the back cover can be 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:22.500
 by the way notice that it is fixed 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:24.000
 tight enough and some special 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.409
 there are no elevators 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.180
 the sides pressed against may not be very 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:33.299
 tight and due to this nausea tete-a 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:35.460
 crunching the panel is removed so 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:39.329
 here is the image on the pine here that needs 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.970
 this science hotel dana is quite flexible but in 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.140
 same time durable enough ie 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:45.420
 withstand drop drops and 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.240
 tougher carelessness by the way can 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.869
 notice that fixing the lid on 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.799
 the place it turns out such a teacher gap is 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:55.110
 apparently generic feature of these 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:57.180
 apparatuses because this is not an example 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.219
 only but the sample and many others 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.689
 there after installation 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:03.180
 lephone sim card need to walk on 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:04.690
 perimeter and snap this cover well 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.750
 everything kept tight 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:09.729
 surely there is a connector under the top 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:12.070
 headphones three and a half millimeters have 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.660
 button to lock the screen to another 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:16.390
 side there is a button to adjust 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.400
 volume is not white Ismatova 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.830
 plastics in general stands out on the general 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.650
 background down connectors micro beaten under 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:26.110
 standard cable zade camera lens 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:28.660
 and flashes here strangely not 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.640
 moreover in cheaper 2 on 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:33.750
 provided there is a hole for 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:37.360
 dynamics and actually start a megaphone 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:39.700
 front minimal set of elements is 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:42.010
 Three touch buttons on top of speaker 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:45.490
 actually all that is provided here 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:50.230
 as for camera tones quite simple 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:53.290
 This is a 3 megapixel sensor settings 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:56.140
 here cuts out several modes from here 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:58.800
 shooting can turn on the sound to not 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:04.540
 interfered with the camera while photographing 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:07.270
 Well, this series of parameters can be seen as 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:09.300
 hear the autofocus photographs and 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:11.560
 there is no correspondingly 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:14.680
 remove objects small text will be 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:16.090
 problematic what else have you got 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.010
 here and the front camera which 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:20.310
 login 2 is present in general despite 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.690
 the fact that this model is more expensive 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.340
 it is functional in something weaker but 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:27.100
 here is the best screen i.e. more 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:27.550
 diagonal your resolution is 480 by 800 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:30.520
 points 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:32.380
 but at the same time here are the same 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:35.260
 fairly poor viewing angles and 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:37.000
 he still has enough for everyone 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:39.910
 strange brightness control behavior 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:43.030
 that is, when changing the situation 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:45.430
 changing very light even changing 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.989
 in sudden jerks I want noticeably in principle 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:49.330
 In this case, you can specify that 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:50.890
 It has small viewing angles, but for 5 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:53.560
 at a price of 2 thousand spas for rubles 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:55.300
 something especially can not count 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.709
 attack your money principle grant 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:59.800
 acceptable surface quality 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:01.840
 covered with plastic as you can see this 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:04.060
 the surface can be forced but if 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:06.580
 push yourself and on her with all your might 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:10.600
 then something of this damage if not 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:13.870
 there will be 4 inside android version 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:15.430
 Stuffing this model is slightly more powerful than vagin 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:17.350
 fell in general, the same processor 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:20.940
 worth them takakashi 572 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:25.630
 but not cut down fans because there 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:27.850
 login 2 frequency 1 gigahertz here you 13 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:30.700
 that is, it means a little more powerful than 13 and those 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:33.640
 the same two cores and graphics mali-400 512 

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:35.169
 megabytes of RAM and enjoy 

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:38.680
 there remains about 2 gigabytes 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:40.539
 built-in memory and slender all that here 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:43.060
 they are comparable in terms of speed 

00:04:40.539 --> 00:04:46.090
 the menu works then in general the shell 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:47.770
 works smoothly and briskly and you can watch 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:49.020
 new device like together they 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:54.550
 look 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:05:00.970
 we evaluate this if you go to work 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:05:06.010
 table and go menu just see how 

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:09.130
 they work on past the camera and others 

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:10.660
 multimedia features that may have 

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:12.660
 it is enough to interest as a type of the menu 

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:14.800
 a lot of all good installed from the megaphone 

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:15.900
 part of this whole thing can be torn down 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:18.039
 free up memory 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:20.770
 I think many people use this device 

00:05:18.039 --> 00:05:23.380
 like it because the clean part 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:25.300
 the rest of the hotel which may not be all 

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:30.910
 will need there is here the weather lip notes and 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:32.890
 some other functions that can 

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:35.140
 interested to show 

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:37.690
 the speed of this phone need 

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:41.370
 you can watch my music player 

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:41.370
 estimate loudness 

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:55.540
 quite sonorous here and there is a radio 

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:56.860
 for the video as usual consider some 

00:05:55.540 --> 00:06:00.580
 separate player and because 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:02.919
 native support is very modest but 

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:07.229
 this pain other expensive models 

00:06:02.919 --> 00:06:09.090
 found in principle under typing 

00:06:07.229 --> 00:06:12.880
 standard keyboard is offered 

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:14.940
 can switch language water can god 

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:17.080
 it will accordingly be such 

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:18.910
 landscape orientation others myself 

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:21.060
 bearded men who can also be turned off 

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:24.000
 he us be with spawn various 

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:27.039
 actions that sing 

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:35.680
 moves through the menu you can look at 

00:06:27.039 --> 00:06:38.050
 the work of the browser this case is used in 

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:41.169
 chrome is basically worth the budget gone 

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:46.750
 inexpensive work all in decent 

00:06:41.169 --> 00:06:49.930
 speed and hurry jerks well this is a fee for 

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:52.240
 budget stuffing you basically for 

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:53.770
 relatively small yes dads at all 

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:58.320
 modest there you can get 500 rubles 

00:06:53.770 --> 00:07:00.490
 higher screen but by 

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:02.199
 usability I do not know something even 

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:04.690
 melagen 2 liked more and more 

00:07:02.199 --> 00:07:07.720
 it feels better in many ways 

00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:09.460
 account of the corps i.e. there build more 

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:12.190
 dense and here these 

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:13.840
 there are no lords between the covers plus it works 

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:17.220
 longer because here despite being 

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:18.940
 what more productive stuffing and 

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:22.930
 higher resolution screen 

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:24.849
 battery and the country is smaller but here 

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:27.699
 with a capacity of 400 milliamps hours there 

00:07:24.849 --> 00:07:29.530
 one and a half thousand but plus there is still lower 

00:07:27.699 --> 00:07:32.650
 CPU frequency and less screen about 

00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:35.650
 This phone works longer 

00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:39.370
 lives less power 12 works a half there 

00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:42.310
 two days, then this is somewhere around 100 home lives 

00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:44.770
 one day that's all about it 

00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:46.810
