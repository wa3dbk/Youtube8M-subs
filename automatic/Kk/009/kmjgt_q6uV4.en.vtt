usually you start out in a instruction
book<00:00:28.140> learning<00:00:28.439> the<00:00:28.500> C<00:00:28.710> chord<00:00:28.920> like<00:00:29.160> that<00:00:29.400> and

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
book learning the C chord like that and

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.269 
book learning the C chord like that and
the<00:00:29.789> F<00:00:29.970> chord<00:00:30.300> like<00:00:30.510> that<00:00:30.750> in<00:00:31.320> inversion<00:00:31.890> so

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
the F chord like that in inversion so

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:33.979 
the F chord like that in inversion so
that<00:00:32.460> see<00:00:32.850> that's<00:00:33.030> easier<00:00:33.390> to<00:00:33.480> move<00:00:33.630> from<00:00:33.840> the

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
that see that's easier to move from the

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.290 
that see that's easier to move from the
C<00:00:34.170> chord<00:00:34.380> to<00:00:34.559> the<00:00:34.590> F<00:00:34.770> chord<00:00:35.100> that<00:00:35.670> it<00:00:35.850> is<00:00:36.000> to<00:00:36.149> go

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
C chord to the F chord that it is to go

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.830 
C chord to the F chord that it is to go
see<00:00:36.750> em<00:00:37.739> isn't<00:00:38.730> it<00:00:38.790> because<00:00:39.390> you<00:00:39.480> just<00:00:39.540> move

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
see em isn't it because you just move

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.630 
see em isn't it because you just move
the<00:00:40.020> top<00:00:40.320> two<00:00:40.620> notes<00:00:40.860> up<00:00:41.129> and<00:00:41.370> leave<00:00:41.520> the

with they do this and they use that for

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.620 
with they do this and they use that for
g7<00:01:01.530> so<00:01:02.129> you<00:01:02.219> have<00:01:02.370> G<00:01:02.760> and<00:01:03.140> F<00:01:04.140> and<00:01:04.439> B<00:01:05.330> now<00:01:06.330> where's

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
g7 so you have G and F and B now where's

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.380 
g7 so you have G and F and B now where's
that<00:01:06.750> where's<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.229> other<00:01:07.350> note<00:01:07.619> of<00:01:07.830> a<00:01:07.890> court

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:54.150 
major 3rd your your mind could very well
and<00:01:52.360> play<00:01:52.540> the<00:01:52.720> minor<00:01:52.960> 3rd<00:01:53.320> ok<00:01:53.590> so<00:01:53.650> you<00:01:53.860> need<00:01:54.040> to

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:54.160 
and play the minor 3rd ok so you need to

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.700 
and play the minor 3rd ok so you need to
include<00:01:54.460> that<00:01:54.520> and<00:01:55.140> of<00:01:56.140> course<00:01:56.170> you<00:01:56.500> need<00:01:56.590> to

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:56.710 
include that and of course you need to

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:58.020 
include that and of course you need to
seventh<00:01:57.100> in<00:01:57.190> the<00:01:57.250> seventh<00:01:57.580> chord<00:01:57.759> otherwise

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.030 
seventh in the seventh chord otherwise

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:59.639 
seventh in the seventh chord otherwise
you<00:01:58.149> don't<00:01:58.270> have<00:01:58.420> a<00:01:58.479> seventh<00:01:58.810> chord<00:01:58.840> right<00:01:59.140> so

00:01:59.639 --> 00:01:59.649 
you don't have a seventh chord right so

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:01.440 
you don't have a seventh chord right so
the<00:01:59.770> only<00:01:59.890> logical<00:02:00.220> note<00:02:00.670> to<00:02:00.850> leave<00:02:01.030> out<00:02:01.210> is

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
the only logical note to leave out is

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.350 
the only logical note to leave out is
that<00:02:01.800> at<00:02:02.800> fifth<00:02:03.100> number<00:02:03.369> so<00:02:04.000> that's<00:02:04.149> the

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 
that at fifth number so that's the

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.270 
that at fifth number so that's the
answer<00:02:04.509> to<00:02:04.720> that<00:02:04.750> question<00:02:05.110> and<00:02:05.530> I<00:02:06.070> thought

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 
answer to that question and I thought

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:07.830 
answer to that question and I thought
that<00:02:06.430> was<00:02:06.550> very<00:02:06.610> insightful<00:02:07.090> of<00:02:07.450> the<00:02:07.509> student

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
that was very insightful of the student

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.979 
that was very insightful of the student
to<00:02:07.960> ask<00:02:08.110> that<00:02:08.410> why<00:02:09.070> why<00:02:09.520> do<00:02:09.580> some<00:02:09.940> foreign<00:02:10.899> up

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:10.989 
to ask that why why do some foreign up

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:12.870 
to ask that why why do some foreign up
chords<00:02:11.380> only<00:02:11.739> have<00:02:11.860> a<00:02:11.890> three<00:02:12.160> note<00:02:12.340> chords<00:02:12.700> and

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
chords only have a three note chords and

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.270 
chords only have a three note chords and
that's<00:02:13.030> the<00:02:13.150> reason<00:02:13.300> for<00:02:13.630> that<00:02:13.920> ok<00:02:14.920> that's<00:02:15.130> it

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
that's the reason for that ok that's it

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:16.560 
that's the reason for that ok that's it
for<00:02:15.310> today<00:02:15.670> and<00:02:15.850> tomorrow<00:02:15.970> we'll<00:02:16.239> take<00:02:16.420> up

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:16.570
