00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 so many of you have asked which 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:05.480
 I actually need techniques for that 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.400
 first quarter in kickboxing 

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:10.679
 yes there is a belt the kick box sport 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.420
 actually imperator education in the foot and 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.450
 then I just wanted the again 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.310
 techniques showing how or her 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.500
 first third needs it is one 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.119
 I'll just test this summer 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.350
 had celebrated by the last night 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.460
 then you will actually come here 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:28.800
 create so incurred is the whole 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.009
 For example, with the chip the gesture 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:40.440
 short time make the photos easy bein 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:41.940
 and step forward and because of that 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.770
 same again before that my easy 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.770
 then let two blows happen 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.670
 but you should then at the exam 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.620
 also do not fall asleep at the work 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.910
 thing there are three beats again 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.390
 that you can easily let it always step 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.390
 Forward 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:14.700
 the super boost four strokes behind 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:16.860
 each other again the last starter 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.540
 five punches behind each other again 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:29.610
 calls for beautiful easy leave 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:31.500
 and so if that sounds like that at 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.920
 you then he is already quite good and 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.869
 right 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.430
 You could do that after about a month 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.310
 that already done is missing now 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:41.340
 the two kicks foremost front the 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.289
 For a short time, I'll take my child's legs 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:48.600
 the press and then we can too 

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:51.030
 These kicks show that's the way it is 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.569
 same in front of the leg light and angular 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:59.729
 rhine from this time only the front leg 

00:01:54.569 --> 00:02:02.789
 alone you see she presses her hip 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:06.690
 forward and we pay attention to the 

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:14.519
 exam also now forward and forward 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:16.560
 behind together ok and then there are 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:19.500
 still the company come now in front 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.970
 I'll pull that short simulated like that 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.040
 a little fight you get the 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:29.010
 Opponent briefly has the fists up 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:31.730
 first again break 2000 the next 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:34.560
 three kics are fast forward 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.540
 leaves at the front and settle 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.220
 push 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.880
 mostly in the ring ropes and then you go 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.370
 after 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.730
 that again the company combination of 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.730
 kick 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:56.489
 two thick afterwards so that is in the 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:58.920
 Sum that was the first pro 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:00.750
 happen as I said when he is not 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.540
 you have just done 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:06.800
