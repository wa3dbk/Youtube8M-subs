00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:08.490
 Hello everyone, okay, and you are watching 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.690
 review of technology from the company allo now 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.540
 I would like to convey a separate 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.250
 hello to all iphone owners again from 9 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.080
 September you are hopelessly behind 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.029
 progress and dropped out of trend 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.380
 have a penultimate iPhone model for 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.090
 true apple fan 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.590
 it is like to some oligarch 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.260
 marry thrice divorced 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.310
 top models but what about any 3 4 iphone and 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.349
 I generally keep quiet 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.269
 I can assume that apple fans already 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.869
 left pouring out their wrath righteous 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.120
 komenty 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.399
 but left those who are primarily valued in 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.500
 iPhones quality and practicality they 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.719
 identify themselves with everybody there cool caste 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.570
 Today we will talk about 6 iphone 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.520
 and compare it a little bit with becoming 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.680
 trick and excitement and other show off 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.420
 let it be superfluous 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.879
 will say that iphone 6 plus 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.620
 bends it also knows everything and everything 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.840
 know that they have long since released jeans with 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.570
 pocket that does not bend in comparison with 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.260
 iphone 5s corners smoothed out rounded out yet 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.359
 stronger 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.250
 the screen is also rounded side faces 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.979
 spiteful critics claim that design 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:09.659
 deadpanned by sony xperia z3 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:11.850
 Well, what do you say. controls 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.619
 we will not change and only the main button 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.390
 now on the side of the options 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.189
 colors are the same gold 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.159
 silver and cosmic sulfur 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:24.420
 change began dimensions 5s had 12 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:27.650
 and 4 by 5 9 and 0 76 centimeters 6 scored in 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:30.509
 now he is 13 and 8 and 6 7 in the shoulders 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:32.700
 outwardly he lost a little weight until 069 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.560
 millimeters but generally looking at it 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.820
 comparable with the iPhones is 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.670
 the definition is kind of a question then someone 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:41.790
 smoothed 5s weighed 112 grams and here 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.189
 six from i passed 129 the reason for these 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.880
 dimensional and and weight metamorphosis is covered 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.369
 in the screen 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:50.460
 5s is the diagonal of the display in 4 inches 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:54.720
 sixes the screen grew to 47 changed and 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:56.460
 1136 resolution at 640 against 1334 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.890
 750 in the new model 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.619
 both models retina only six 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:04.619
 don't just retina aretro and wait for density 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:06.570
 pixels always 326 now camera 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.840
 again i'm standing six 6 megapixel 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.060
 there and there you can shoot video format 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.190
 1080p 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.560
 but still the tangible difference is this 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.599
 a bulging camera that kind of delights you 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.270
 see another difference sensor and 

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:20.830
 f-22 lens also sixth apples 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:24.670
 added the ability to shoot sloumo 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:26.920
 120 or 240 fps video looks like 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:29.050
 bulbs stunning frontal 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.420
 cameras in both cases identical this 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.340
 it's on 1 out of 2 megapixels but also 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.390
 video destruction in which you can shoot 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.519
 720p 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:39.099
 so the little mouth will get the same on 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:41.890
 Both iPhone percent devaysa also updated 

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:44.380
 5s meant a7 dual-core processor 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:47.019
 clock speeds of 1 and 3 gigahertz and 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:48.220
 m7 coprocessor and the six charges 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:51.010
 dual core 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:51.670
 a8 clocked at 1 and 4 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.459
 gigahertz 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:56.410
 isla processor m8 ram in 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:58.510
 both cases 1 gig as they say 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.880
 scary apple fans measure numbers with 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:02.349
 Android devices useless need 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.030
 put up with performance 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:06.130
 but I generally think that u measure 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.590
 do something with the notorious people 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:10.120
 if you understand what the protocols are about 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.980
 the connections are the same only 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.599
 added to axis standard file 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.630
 boosts download speeds to 

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:19.030
 incredible 400 33 megabits per second and 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:20.890
 truths the whole truth in nx is small 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.510
 nuance it works with contactless 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:24.760
 apple pay payment system 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:27.040
 exclusively in the usa nothing 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.019
 does not resemble the postman Pechkin brought 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.450
 package for your boy only you 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:33.100
 I will not give it again which time is an apple maker 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:35.739
 makes the module a little crop it 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:38.769
 functional 5s worked under the same control 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:40.780
 7 as the six came out the wife of the eighth to 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:42.670
 the same for two weeks six 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:45.190
 managed to get a new version 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:48.579
 802 battery capacity at six 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:53.109
 wins 1810 milliampere hours at that 

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:55.269
 time like 5 from 1570 as we know steve 

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:57.790
 Jobs was against the increase in size 

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:59.829
 iphone and so but in the very background we 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:01.630
 We can thanks to a double tapu on the screen 

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:03.220
 from the cinema all the icons down to your 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:05.620
 the little boy was able to reach 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:08.230
 Anything of course remains the same . 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:10.569
 branded flat quality and style among 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:12.160
 hordes of distant smartphones on a bucket go 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:15.100
 iphone 6 found 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.900
 of light in the kingdom of darkness as aragorn mordor 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:18.010
 as klitschko in boxing as a rose among 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.709
 dandelions 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:22.900
 yes and in general our apple all well here you already 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:25.150
 wrote angry comments saying 6 iphone 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:27.580
 he is very expensive why is he generally needed 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:29.530
 remove the angry comments put huskies
