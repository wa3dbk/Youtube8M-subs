00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:28.310
 the emergence of the human species was 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:30.169
 I have manipulated the home 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:33.079
 Since I started to interest myself 

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:35.149
 for spirituality open my head 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:37.579
 possibility of the existence of 

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:39.800
 other civilizations scattered throughout the 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:40.820
 universe and especially in our 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.890
 galaxy 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:45.260
 I keep thinking that from the point of view of 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.600
 an extraterrestrial consciousness 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.420
 we are seeing the history of 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.719
 our own kind of form 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.480
 disadvantageous 

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:56.000
 that is, if we have tools with a 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:59.390
 astral projection to discover the origin 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.820
 of our nature maybe we should use 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:04.040
 this in our favor in the sense of 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.880
 understand our composition in our 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:09.890
 energies and with this knowledge 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:12.230
 try to build something that helps us 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:15.850
 as a global community doing the 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:18.680
 human design works for civilization 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.720
 What can you say about that already? 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.570
 did some research in this direction 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:26.570
 or is this what we were a 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:28.579
 genetically manipulated species 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:32.509
 extraterrestrial consciences we are 

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:37.250
 fruit of one in that gene galactic nation 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:39.860
 It's alright, I always say that we 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.090
 we are an experience always said that 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.030
 all the time 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:47.899
 when someone asks me as soon as you 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:49.789
 think of the ration years experience and 

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:54.020
 not this is not only the human race is a 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:57.200
 experience in which we have other 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:02:01.369
 races that are an experience also 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:03.469
 notion that because we find in the 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:06.079
 maximum instead of working on the 

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:09.410
 for our growth 

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:11.390
 our awareness and conscience and 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.700
 to have a life in peace we know 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:16.930
 exactly the opposite here right then 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.930
 when you say here 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:29.420
 armament you need to stop having 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:31.370
 innumerable emotional defenses is 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.540
 we live all the time but we do not live 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.640
 in peace 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.530
 we live in a constant war that 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.370
 starts inside us and then goes to 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.230
 out 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.690
 there is no war that does not 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.800
 started inside someone can write down 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.870
 that's true 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.980
 our pathologies our 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:49.220
 difficulties 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:52.069
 understood the need to submit 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.840
 the other to affirm yourself or you 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:56.530
 states by submitting 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.400
 aggression or you reaffirm 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:01.940
 submitting the other through your 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:04.430
 my passivity is a person who has a 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:07.459
 more balanced condition more assertive 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.900
 she does not argue who is right 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:15.470
 she argues that we can do 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:19.160
 together it is well so we are one 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:23.989
 We are a group on this planet. 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:26.150
 which is truly an experience that will 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:28.250
 tell who is doing this experiment 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:30.230
 Look at all the work I have. 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.910
 made through astral projections I 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:34.400
 I really like studying this until 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:37.730
 to better understand what I am that 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:42.319
 each one of us is what we did 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:45.140
 route very very miserable because 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:47.150
 We are primitive of ignorant you. 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:50.269
 has been making several incarnations of 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:52.700
 several times a condition that people 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:55.280
 evolve little because those who are 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:56.720
 trying to evolve and see farther end 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.489
 being sacrificed by those who do not 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:01.010
 They want to see nothing, that's how our 

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:03.230
 human society or by those who 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:06.260
 want to master this kind of thing is 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:08.329
 so you see today is how many wars 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:10.160
 Do you think it exists on the planet? 

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:11.900
 How many people do you think do not 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:15.739
 they see nothing that are only prestige 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:17.959
 the ego itself is reaffirming the 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:20.090
 before a people or before the family 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:23.600
 or in front of oneself matters 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:26.690
 this is a very serious thing is not serious 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:30.130
 It's unfortunate, it's unconscious. 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:30.130
 of everything that exists 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:37.480
 do is travel human project I guess 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:42.010
 That's very little, we're part of it. 

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:43.780
 of the immense universe is a cosmos in which 

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:46.090
 we will have to integrate them 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:48.070
 through our effort the way is 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:49.330
 much longer than making people 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:52.450
 succeed 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:54.970
 the way we really can 

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:57.130
 grow so much is that we can 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:59.710
 to welcome all those consciences that 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:02.889
 exists in all known space and 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:04.390
 unknown to be greater than we 

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:06.730
 we're thinking like this, we'll be 

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:08.740
 very good here on the planet 

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:10.480
 This is a very primitive thing. 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:13.150
 our planet is a great thing but they can 

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:14.590
 even a little foot is a particle of sand 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:17.020
 in this immense universe 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:19.270
 I already said this, give a little something out of the 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:22.110
 Planet gives a march that will speak 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:25.690
 I do not want it, it's not for you 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:30.550
 understand how we are primitive right? 

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:32.830
 does not give that is the great truth here in 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:34.450
 our planet is aware of 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:38.950
 extraterrestrial consciousness that does not 

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:41.979
 had embedded nasdaq eyes 

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:44.530
 incarnated in physical body some with 

00:05:41.979 --> 00:05:47.169
 awareness of what they are and their origin 

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:50.620
 others that have already been involved 

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:52.780
 is whether the emotional energy context 

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:54.310
 and already lost themselves 

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:56.740
 you will find that there are people watching 

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:59.140
 to heaven and talking pulls life 

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:01.419
 Funny, I think I'm from another. 

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:05.620
 Planet is funny, I really like 

00:06:01.419 --> 00:06:09.010
 astronomy can not recover what 

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:11.919
 she really has remnants, but more 

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:16.000
 we put it in here and we'll produce 

00:06:11.919 --> 00:06:18.250
 more and more to put you talking 

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.900
 the fruit of a galactic miscegenation 

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:22.000
 that we can not go that far where 

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:23.710
 You know we want the answers a lot. 

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.410
 practices that assuming a mountain is a 

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:29.800
 flying saucer is what we want right? 

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:32.169
 Look, let's do some more projections. 

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:33.789
 astral and you will discover 

00:06:32.169 --> 00:06:37.570
 You can see a lot of things to hide. 

00:06:33.789 --> 00:06:39.909
 a lot and then your inner space 

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:42.220
 that will increase a lot will be a 

00:06:39.909 --> 00:06:43.960
 contribution to all those who 

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:46.000
 are here 

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:51.250
 that's what we really need 

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:53.199
 To think then is is the searches that I 

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:56.259
 makes me see the universe of a 

00:06:53.199 --> 00:06:58.660
 different way lead me to think that the 

00:06:56.259 --> 00:07:00.729
 our heart is already larger than is 

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:03.190
 people can accept everything that is 

00:07:00.729 --> 00:07:05.340
 around us and to thank all the 

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:08.710
 days 

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:11.800
 so I 'm going to say I feel like I'm going 

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:17.919
 putting it on i see images is one thing 

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:21.310
 very cool but it's really I believe 

00:07:17.919 --> 00:07:24.610
 What you're putting here is that 

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:26.259
 we need to evolve and be better 

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:27.580
 so let's work together and do this 

00:07:26.259 --> 00:07:29.380
 way so that one day people 

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:33.300
 can be proud of right 

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:35.949
 I think this is where our site is www 

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:39.070
 points between point studies the org 

00:07:35.949 --> 00:07:40.509
 our blog is the out-of-body point with the 

00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:44.710
 friend of the century 

00:07:40.509 --> 00:07:46.630
 The guardian if you want to help me is 

00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:48.460
 only purchase the books of the incident to 

00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:52.599
 that we continue on this path with 

00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:56.320
 all the will with all the force and put 

00:07:52.599 --> 00:07:58.500
 really grow until the next 

00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:58.500
 question
