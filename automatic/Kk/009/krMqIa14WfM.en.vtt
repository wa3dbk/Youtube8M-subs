00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:43.030
 very rich very healthy and good we are going to 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:46.930
 start the materials that we are going to 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:50.110
 need are japanese peanuts this 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:53.060
 what is tomato juice and those things here 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:57.230
 it's called clamato 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:01:00.790
 chile miguelito tajÃ­n peking or of which 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:04.790
 you want it to be in powder chamoy 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:07.130
 lemons and most importantly what 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:09.350
 next thing we're going to do is peel 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:12.320
 our cucumbers as normally what 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:15.530
 we would do with our cucumbers trimmed 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:18.540
 the corners and we rub all the cucumber 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:21.600
 to take away the bitter 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:24.590
 the good cucumber this is a very 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.590
 common peeling 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.190
 Y 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:34.890
 Now what we will do is take the cucumber 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:37.410
 and we will write it in two or three 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.080
 parts depending on the size that 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:42.480
 you want your cucumber cups I 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:47.290
 I'm going to do in two parts because this one 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:50.080
 cotino is very small and good 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:53.020
 and with a teaspoon what I'm going to do 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:57.870
 is to remove the center of the seeds 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.870
 to form the cup 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:07.509
 once we have our little glasses of 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:12.130
 cucumber so what we're going to do is get wet 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:12.130
 in the chamoy in this way 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.450
 and then wet 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:25.610
 good to bathe with chilito 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:29.950

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.950
