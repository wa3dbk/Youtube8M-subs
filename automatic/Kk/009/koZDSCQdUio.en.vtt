00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.370
 a good score there, the average score was 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.739
 help was high even everyone told 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.480
 well because games were considered easy 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.059
 to leave but we are still happy 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.530
 our score and expect to continue like this 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.780
 in this mean and points 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.620
 come on then our team is the 16th 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.620
 round the crowd 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:05.909
 good people remembering that the scheme as 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:09.180
 It's always 4 3 3, there for you and let's go. 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:11.880
 Then goalkeeper our goalkeeper then guys 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.680
 of continuous in Fernanda Prass was in the 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.630
 Arm playing the palm trees plays against the 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.220
 athletic paranaense home 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.409
 I believe it's going to be a not so 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.380
 easy for the palm trees and that was in the par 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:24.470
 be demanded there and make good defenses 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:28.110
 So we put fernando prass there. 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:28.530
 guys on the second side 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.850
 there 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:35.430
 the egídio the egídio who is a player there 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:38.189
 been playing very well made six points in the 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.259
 last round adds 16 points 76 of the average 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.979
 very good player and very good player 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.600
 regular 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.850
 the same egídio than what the palm trees 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:48.240
 he did not take a goal he always scored well 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:51.180
 then give them a second side 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:55.619
 people are samuel xavier samuel xavier 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:57.689
 I will not bet on him any more 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:00.299
 now I had not bet on it but 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:02.790
 I'll put it back on my team then he 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:06.780
 has an average not very good but the sport 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:08.849
 take the cruise home the guys and 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.340
 Joinville at home, the sport has to go to 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:13.180
 rainfall has to support rather than 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.870
 believed in a film assist 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:18.819
 xavier the noise of ball and by the side 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:21.069
 Our first guys defender is the 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:22.480
 inter is google or is not yet 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:24.310
 confirmed that he will play the guys or 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.269
 be silva do not play we will put 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.739
 allan costa 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:28.480
 we are betting behind the inter 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:30.730
 net with the two quarterbacks of Inter 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.430
 because because the interplay against the 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:36.340
 chapecoense at home in the inter and do not take 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:38.019
 so much goal I believe the backhand goes well 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:41.049
 if the inter also does not score more than 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:42.280
 zaga has not said not to take a goal and touched 

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:44.349
 behind the 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.090
 ruan the same thing with ernando then 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:48.609
 put the two of inter the next year 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.859
 of a very good average and 5.5 player 

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:52.780
 fairly regular herniating roano only 

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:54.639
 three matches but is one of the most 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:57.359
 experienced defender who does not commit 

00:02:54.639 --> 00:03:00.430
 many faults that a pretty ball there 

00:02:57.359 --> 00:03:03.069
 our socks galera 1º 6 is the elf of the 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:06.909
 That 's a sport, that 's a half field there. 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:09.040
 which has a good average 4.93 and whenever 

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:11.379
 enters and decides to go to the sport enters 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.969
 difficult matches and tac that will be 

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:13.540
 holder only gives then we put 

00:03:12.969 --> 00:03:15.040
 elber 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.840
 We thought about putting diego souza 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.519
 but it's a bit more expensive then you already own 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.989
 a work in sports believes that it can 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:22.870
 do a care or who knows how to do 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:24.579
 a goal and the second is guys is edson 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:26.260
 edson do fluminense 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:28.389
 edson is a very regular player there 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:30.099
 than the average of 16 

00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:32.260
 the Rio de Janeiro was a guild in the guild 

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:34.090
 home I think I'm a difficult game 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.010
 two teams that 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:37.870
 get there at g4 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:39.669
 so I believe the edson can 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:40.780
 get along this part of the Imasen stolen 

00:03:39.669 --> 00:03:44.680
 ball maybe even give assistance 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:47.049
 for goal and our 3rd mega was the otávio 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:50.019
 that even the player in 

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:53.470
 regular the top hat has an average of 6 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:54.819
 points 83 was 6.10 the last round plays 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:58.120
 against the palm trees outside the house 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:59.169
 thought of the guy's reasoning the team was 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.430
 very well against the corinthians too 

00:03:59.169 --> 00:04:02.650
 out of the house corinthians is enough 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:03.970
 up and otavio if the team did well 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:06.669
 made 20 points if I 'm not mistaken in 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:09.879
 It's true who 's even thinking about it. 

00:04:06.669 --> 00:04:12.459
 that it works and that it makes good 

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:14.769
 score our new first 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:16.930
 attacker on our tac right now we have 

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:19.299
 attacker nilmar nilmar inter 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:21.579
 mark has a reasonably good average and 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:24.070
 four points 94 did not come well the last 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:26.260
 but we believe that at sea 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:27.100
 is either the great attack option of the inter 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.710
 there to win 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:32.640
 the chapecoense then that believes neymar 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:35.050
 not unimar and organized event and also 

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:37.210
 our the attacker that she is the rafael 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:38.710
 Marquez from the palms because the people 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:40.300
 put rafael marques do not remember 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:42.580
 pear that comes very highly valued 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:45.880
 means of also because we believe 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:47.230
 that the group marks with this has many 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:49.120
 lots of option to attack the palm trees 

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:50.950
 to say that you just have to work there 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:53.170
 not to lose ownership too 

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:54.940
 hope he struggles a lot game 

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:58.240
 there make an assistance the thought a 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:05:01.480
 goal and we have attacker non - myth guys 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:04.060
 Paul the average warrior 7.8 in the top hat 

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:05.800
 Average baita 34 when 80 a little below 

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:07.630
 of what I've been doing more 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:10.090
 He believes strongly in the bathroom with Paulo 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:12.970
 best option of attack of flamengo né 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:14.440
 We go from paula warrior following 

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:15.730
 the line of thought we have three 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:17.860
 inter 3 players the palm trees 

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:20.350
 modified inter diego's coach 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:21.940
 expected to make a good performance with the 

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:24.430
 average of inter players 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:27.310
 Our team was like this, Fernando. 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:30.880
 brazil and egídio samuel xavier rua ernando 

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:33.820
 elber edson otavio maria rafael marques 

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:36.640
 paulo and rio the technician diego aguirre 

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:39.010
 Our team price then stayed at 176 is 

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:42.100
 an expensive team really were only two 

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:43.720
 in the coffers of our heritage 178 

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:46.600
