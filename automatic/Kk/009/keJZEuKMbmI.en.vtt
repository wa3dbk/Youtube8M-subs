00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:06.080 
holding the door with the beholder key

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:11.240 
holding the door with the beholder key
and<00:00:07.820> we're<00:00:08.820> flying<00:00:09.150> around<00:00:09.450> on<00:00:09.870> this<00:00:10.260> Pegasus

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
and we're flying around on this Pegasus

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.980 
and we're flying around on this Pegasus
type<00:00:11.490> thing<00:00:12.349> so<00:00:13.349> the<00:00:13.830> Pegasus<00:00:14.280> type<00:00:14.670> thing<00:00:14.990> has

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
type thing so the Pegasus type thing has

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.050 
type thing so the Pegasus type thing has
two<00:00:16.320> attacks<00:00:16.680> has<00:00:17.190> these<00:00:17.400> little<00:00:17.520> bolts<00:00:17.910> like

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
two attacks has these little bolts like

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.800 
two attacks has these little bolts like
this<00:00:18.270> and<00:00:18.650> you<00:00:19.650> can<00:00:19.680> hold<00:00:20.300> right<00:00:21.300> trigger<00:00:21.570> and

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
this and you can hold right trigger and

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.109 
this and you can hold right trigger and
charge<00:00:22.230> it<00:00:22.380> if<00:00:22.740> you<00:00:23.460> do<00:00:23.580> that<00:00:23.789> you<00:00:23.970> can

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
charge it if you do that you can

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:25.580 
charge it if you do that you can
highlight<00:00:24.449> multiple<00:00:24.630> enemies<00:00:25.170> and<00:00:25.350> you<00:00:25.439> can

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
highlight multiple enemies and you can

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.279 
highlight multiple enemies and you can
attack<00:00:25.890> those<00:00:26.189> three<00:00:26.550> enemies<00:00:26.880> or<00:00:27.090> I<00:00:27.390> think

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
attack those three enemies or I think

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:35.790 
attack those three enemies or I think
the<00:00:28.380> most<00:00:28.590> you<00:00:28.680> can<00:00:28.740> attach<00:00:29.039> is<00:00:29.250> five

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:35.800 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.840 

about<00:00:36.430> five<00:00:36.670> or<00:00:36.820> six

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
about five or six

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.349 
about five or six
so<00:00:39.420> pretty<00:00:39.600> much<00:00:39.690> this<00:00:39.870> whole<00:00:40.079> video<00:00:40.230> is

00:00:41.349 --> 00:00:41.359 
so pretty much this whole video is

00:00:41.359 --> 00:00:45.860 
so pretty much this whole video is
flying<00:00:42.359> around<00:00:43.879> there<00:00:44.879> are<00:00:44.940> no<00:00:45.359> collectibles

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
flying around there are no collectibles

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.389 
flying around there are no collectibles
in<00:00:45.930> this<00:00:46.079> video<00:00:48.589> just<00:00:49.589> a<00:00:49.739> lot<00:00:49.949> of<00:00:49.980> target

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
in this video just a lot of target

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.380 
in this video just a lot of target
practice

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:53.390 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.200 

a<00:00:53.510> little<00:00:54.320> later<00:00:54.470> on<00:00:54.559> the<00:00:54.860> level<00:00:55.040> maybe<00:00:55.790> about

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:56.210 
a little later on the level maybe about

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.860 
a little later on the level maybe about
halfway<00:00:56.450> through<00:00:57.399> it's<00:00:58.450> not<00:00:59.450> going<00:00:59.690> to<00:00:59.780> be

00:00:59.860 --> 00:00:59.870 
halfway through it's not going to be

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:01.060 
halfway through it's not going to be
much<00:01:00.079> of<00:01:00.110> a<00:01:00.260> challenge<00:01:00.500> there's<00:01:00.860> going<00:01:00.980> to<00:01:01.040> be

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.070 
much of a challenge there's going to be

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:02.950 
much of a challenge there's going to be
a<00:01:01.160> bunch<00:01:01.309> of<00:01:01.430> enemies<00:01:01.660> some<00:01:02.660> of<00:01:02.780> them<00:01:02.870> you

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:02.960 
a bunch of enemies some of them you

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.329 
a bunch of enemies some of them you
don't<00:01:03.079> even<00:01:03.140> have<00:01:03.290> to<00:01:03.379> kill<00:01:03.650> but<00:01:03.920> it's<00:01:04.159> just

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339 
don't even have to kill but it's just

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:11.340 
don't even have to kill but it's just
for<00:01:04.400> getting<00:01:04.640> Souls<00:01:05.059> and<00:01:05.300> stuff

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:11.350 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.140 

so<00:01:12.010> you'll<00:01:12.189> have<00:01:12.340> these<00:01:12.549> guys<00:01:12.729> that<00:01:13.000> have

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:13.150 
so you'll have these guys that have

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.749 
so you'll have these guys that have
these<00:01:13.299> circles<00:01:13.810> that<00:01:13.960> kind<00:01:14.229> of<00:01:14.320> spit<00:01:14.590> out<00:01:14.759> make

00:01:15.749 --> 00:01:15.759 
these circles that kind of spit out make

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:17.010 
these circles that kind of spit out make
sure<00:01:15.790> you<00:01:16.000> hit<00:01:16.119> those<00:01:16.299> circles<00:01:16.689> because<00:01:16.840> they

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.020 
sure you hit those circles because they

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:42.570 
sure you hit those circles because they
do<00:01:17.110> a<00:01:17.140> ton<00:01:17.470> of<00:01:17.619> damage

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:42.580 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:44.950 

so<00:01:43.580> if<00:01:43.700> you<00:01:43.790> couldn't<00:01:44.060> tell<00:01:44.120> already<00:01:44.210> i'm<00:01:44.780> not

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
so if you couldn't tell already i'm not

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.330 
so if you couldn't tell already i'm not
actually<00:01:45.140> controlling<00:01:45.740> the<00:01:45.950> bird<00:01:46.130> you're

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
actually controlling the bird you're

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.700 
actually controlling the bird you're
flying<00:01:46.750> it<00:01:47.750> doesn't<00:01:48.050> for<00:01:48.200> you<00:01:48.290> it's<00:01:48.440> just<00:01:48.590> a

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 
flying it doesn't for you it's just a

00:01:48.710 --> 00:02:13.510 
flying it doesn't for you it's just a
bunch<00:01:48.860> of<00:01:49.570> target<00:01:50.570> practice<00:01:50.930> for<00:01:50.960> you

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.880 

jelly<00:02:14.270> you'll<00:02:14.810> see<00:02:14.990> here<00:02:15.200> you<00:02:15.320> get<00:02:15.440> this<00:02:15.590> point

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
jelly you'll see here you get this point

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:17.530 
jelly you'll see here you get this point
where<00:02:16.040> you<00:02:16.130> fight<00:02:16.550> two<00:02:16.910> of<00:02:17.030> the<00:02:17.120> same<00:02:17.270> guys

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
where you fight two of the same guys

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.780 
where you fight two of the same guys
that<00:02:17.990> shoot<00:02:18.500> those<00:02:18.680> walls<00:02:18.920> at<00:02:19.100> you<00:02:19.190> so<00:02:19.370> you<00:02:19.730> got

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
that shoot those walls at you so you got

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.090 
that shoot those walls at you so you got
to<00:02:19.880> be<00:02:19.970> kind<00:02:20.150> of<00:02:20.180> quick<00:02:20.390> with<00:02:21.290> taking<00:02:21.740> the<00:02:21.800> orbs

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:22.100 
to be kind of quick with taking the orbs

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:23.920 
to be kind of quick with taking the orbs
out<00:02:22.250> because<00:02:22.550> once<00:02:22.790> they<00:02:22.970> kind<00:02:23.240> of<00:02:23.360> start

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
out because once they kind of start

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.320 
out because once they kind of start
moving<00:02:24.260> at<00:02:24.350> you<00:02:24.470> like<00:02:24.620> that<00:02:25.000> they're<00:02:26.000> really

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
moving at you like that they're really

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:27.910 
moving at you like that they're really
hard<00:02:26.630> to<00:02:26.720> stop<00:02:27.020> and<00:02:27.350> you<00:02:27.410> can<00:02:27.560> see<00:02:27.740> they're

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
hard to stop and you can see they're

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:42.590 
hard to stop and you can see they're
doing<00:02:28.220> a<00:02:28.460> decent<00:02:29.090> amount<00:02:29.150> of<00:02:29.300> damage<00:02:29.600> to<00:02:29.630> me

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.930 

so<00:02:43.170> this<00:02:43.290> whole<00:02:43.440> parts<00:02:43.800> on<00:02:43.950> rails<00:02:44.220> like<00:02:44.550> I<00:02:44.670> said

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
so this whole parts on rails like I said

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:49.400 
so this whole parts on rails like I said
so<00:02:45.360> if<00:02:46.260> you<00:02:46.470> don't<00:02:46.620> kill<00:02:47.010> an<00:02:47.130> enemy<00:02:48.410> before

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
so if you don't kill an enemy before

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.400 
so if you don't kill an enemy before
another<00:02:49.800> one<00:02:50.010> comes<00:02:50.600> the<00:02:51.600> enemies<00:02:52.110> that<00:02:52.290> you

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
another one comes the enemies that you

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:53.690 
another one comes the enemies that you
are<00:02:52.530> currently<00:02:52.680> fighting<00:02:53.010> will<00:02:53.220> just<00:02:53.430> kind<00:02:53.550> of

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
are currently fighting will just kind of

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.640 
are currently fighting will just kind of
fly<00:02:53.970> away<00:02:54.240> so<00:02:54.990> we<00:02:55.050> don't<00:02:55.230> go<00:02:55.320> worried<00:02:55.500> about

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
fly away so we don't go worried about

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:20.390 
fly away so we don't go worried about
fighting<00:02:55.950> like<00:02:56.940> masses<00:02:57.690> of<00:02:57.720> enemies

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.309 

these<00:03:21.030> little<00:03:21.209> bugs<00:03:21.480> don't<00:03:21.659> do<00:03:21.780> any<00:03:21.930> harm<00:03:22.079> but

00:03:22.309 --> 00:03:22.319 
these little bugs don't do any harm but

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:30.120 
these little bugs don't do any harm but
they<00:03:22.470> do<00:03:22.530> give<00:03:22.769> you<00:03:22.890> some<00:03:23.069> souls<00:03:23.370> he<00:03:23.879> killed

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.130 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:45.270 

you

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.930 

so<00:03:45.850> this<00:03:46.240> dragon<00:03:46.750> is<00:03:47.250> going<00:03:48.250> to<00:03:48.310> be<00:03:48.400> the<00:03:48.640> main

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:48.940 
so this dragon is going to be the main

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:24.570 
playing area is so small where it just
doesn't<00:05:22.479> give<00:05:22.569> you<00:05:22.689> much<00:05:22.740> move<00:05:23.740> around<00:05:23.919> it's
