00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.789 
i'm jeff plumb and today we're going to
talk<00:00:04.620> about<00:00:04.799> basic<00:00:05.520> footwork<00:00:06.319> in<00:00:07.319> table

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
talk about basic footwork in table

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:10.009 
talk about basic footwork in table
tennis<00:00:07.919> most<00:00:08.490> of<00:00:08.670> your<00:00:08.760> movement<00:00:09.240> is<00:00:09.389> sideways

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
tennis most of your movement is sideways

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:11.839 
tennis most of your movement is sideways
so<00:00:10.620> it's<00:00:10.740> really<00:00:10.889> important<00:00:11.429> to<00:00:11.490> get<00:00:11.639> that

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
so it's really important to get that

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.870 
so it's really important to get that
movement<00:00:12.360> correct<00:00:13.190> some<00:00:14.190> basic<00:00:14.580> things<00:00:14.610> that

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
movement correct some basic things that

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.580 
movement correct some basic things that
you<00:00:15.000> need<00:00:15.089> to<00:00:15.240> think<00:00:15.389> about<00:00:15.570> are<00:00:15.960> making<00:00:16.560> sure

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
you need to think about are making sure

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.260 
you need to think about are making sure
that<00:00:16.920> you're<00:00:17.039> down<00:00:17.220> nice<00:00:17.520> and<00:00:17.550> low<00:00:17.820> in<00:00:18.119> your

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
that you're down nice and low in your

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.779 
that you're down nice and low in your
basic<00:00:18.750> ready<00:00:19.230> position<00:00:19.650> once<00:00:20.490> you're<00:00:20.670> in<00:00:20.730> that

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
basic ready position once you're in that

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.150 
basic ready position once you're in that
ready<00:00:21.090> position<00:00:21.420> it's<00:00:22.080> a<00:00:22.230> matter<00:00:22.410> of<00:00:22.560> moving

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
ready position it's a matter of moving

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.060 
ready position it's a matter of moving
sideways<00:00:24.150> with<00:00:24.930> either<00:00:25.109> a<00:00:25.439> little<00:00:25.800> bit<00:00:25.949> of<00:00:26.010> a

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
sideways with either a little bit of a

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:32.269 
sideways with either a little bit of a
jump<00:00:26.340> or<00:00:26.609> a<00:00:27.320> shuffle<00:00:30.740> the<00:00:31.740> easiest<00:00:32.130> way<00:00:32.219> to

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
jump or a shuffle the easiest way to

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.310 
jump or a shuffle the easiest way to
learn<00:00:32.399> the<00:00:32.850> basic<00:00:33.210> footwork<00:00:33.390> is<00:00:33.780> to<00:00:34.050> do<00:00:34.200> it

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
learn the basic footwork is to do it

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.370 
learn the basic footwork is to do it
nice<00:00:34.500> and<00:00:34.530> slowly<00:00:35.010> in<00:00:35.309> one<00:00:35.790> ball<00:00:36.030> at<00:00:36.210> a<00:00:36.329> time<00:00:36.570> so

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
nice and slowly in one ball at a time so

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:38.959 
nice and slowly in one ball at a time so
I'm<00:00:37.649> going<00:00:37.890> to<00:00:37.920> feed<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.219> ball<00:00:38.340> out<00:00:38.520> one<00:00:38.790> at<00:00:38.910> a

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
I'm going to feed the ball out one at a

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:45.310 
I'm going to feed the ball out one at a
time<00:00:39.180> to<00:00:39.360> Jeff<00:00:40.579> so<00:00:41.579> we<00:00:41.700> start<00:00:41.940> with<00:00:42.200> hip<00:00:43.520> jump

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:45.320 
time to Jeff so we start with hip jump

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.880 
time to Jeff so we start with hip jump
hit<00:00:46.340> jump<00:00:47.340> into<00:00:47.520> position<00:00:47.969> and<00:00:48.200> here<00:00:49.200> and<00:00:49.350> I'm

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
hit jump into position and here and I'm

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.790 
hit jump into position and here and I'm
catching<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.460> ball<00:00:50.610> each<00:00:51.480> time<00:00:51.870> to<00:00:52.320> give<00:00:52.500> Jeff

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
catching the ball each time to give Jeff

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.580 
catching the ball each time to give Jeff
plenty<00:00:53.160> of<00:00:53.280> time<00:00:53.719> to<00:00:54.719> get<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:55.289> movement

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
plenty of time to get the movement

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.290 
plenty of time to get the movement
correct<00:00:57.530> once<00:00:58.530> you<00:00:58.739> feel<00:00:58.980> like<00:00:59.300> your

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
correct once you feel like your

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.660 
correct once you feel like your
movements<00:01:00.809> correct<00:01:01.170> then<00:01:01.770> you<00:01:01.920> can<00:01:02.070> start<00:01:02.309> to

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
movements correct then you can start to

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.890 
movements correct then you can start to
hit<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.270> ball<00:01:03.650> continuously<00:01:04.970> so<00:01:05.970> it's<00:01:06.479> a<00:01:06.659> hip

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
hit the ball continuously so it's a hip

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:12.500 
hit the ball continuously so it's a hip
and<00:01:08.270> jump<00:01:09.380> hit<00:01:10.380> them<00:01:10.650> jump<00:01:10.979> kick<00:01:11.430> and<00:01:11.729> jump<00:01:12.030> hit

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
and jump hit them jump kick and jump hit

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:19.160 
and jump hit them jump kick and jump hit
and<00:01:12.840> jump<00:01:13.080> hit<00:01:13.560> and<00:01:13.890> jump<00:01:17.810> the<00:01:18.810> other<00:01:18.930> really

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
and jump hit and jump the other really

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.050 
and jump hit and jump the other really
important<00:01:19.770> part<00:01:20.009> of<00:01:20.100> our<00:01:20.220> footwork<00:01:20.640> is<00:01:20.880> to

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
important part of our footwork is to

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.219 
important part of our footwork is to
make<00:01:21.240> sure<00:01:21.270> that<00:01:21.509> when<00:01:21.930> you're<00:01:22.110> actually

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
make sure that when you're actually

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.530 
make sure that when you're actually
hitting<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:22.830> ball<00:01:23.040> that<00:01:23.610> you<00:01:23.640> have<00:01:24.030> stopped

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
hitting the ball that you have stopped

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:32.630 
hitting the ball that you have stopped
so<00:01:25.439> now<00:01:26.100> let's<00:01:26.670> focus<00:01:26.939> on<00:01:27.890> move<00:01:28.970> stop<00:01:29.970> hit<00:01:31.640> move

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
so now let's focus on move stop hit move

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:39.620 
so now let's focus on move stop hit move
stop<00:01:33.509> and<00:01:33.780> hit<00:01:36.979> move<00:01:37.979> stop<00:01:38.490> hit<00:01:38.850> move<00:01:39.240> stop

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
stop and hit move stop hit move stop

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.679 
stop and hit move stop hit move stop
move<00:01:40.259> stop<00:01:40.500> hit<00:01:40.920> move<00:01:41.220> stop<00:01:41.549> it<00:01:41.820> let's<00:01:42.479> have<00:01:42.630> a

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
move stop hit move stop it let's have a

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.340 
move stop hit move stop it let's have a
look<00:01:42.810> at<00:01:42.899> this<00:01:43.020> in<00:01:43.290> slow<00:01:43.610> one<00:01:44.610> at<00:01:44.729> a<00:01:44.790> time<00:01:45.350> so

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
look at this in slow one at a time so

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.620 
look at this in slow one at a time so
let's<00:01:46.500> hear<00:01:46.680> move<00:01:47.220> stop<00:01:48.140> it<00:01:49.140> move<00:01:49.860> stop<00:01:50.630> it

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
let's hear move stop it move stop it

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:57.499 
let's hear move stop it move stop it
move<00:01:52.229> stop<00:01:52.649> and<00:01:53.100> here<00:01:56.060> why<00:01:57.060> is<00:01:57.119> it<00:01:57.240> really

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
move stop and here why is it really

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:58.880 
move stop and here why is it really
important<00:01:57.869> to<00:01:57.930> be<00:01:58.049> stopped<00:01:58.380> because<00:01:58.770> if

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
important to be stopped because if

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.170 
important to be stopped because if
you're<00:01:59.009> not<00:01:59.040> stopped<00:01:59.579> you're<00:01:59.880> going<00:02:00.030> to<00:02:00.119> be

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
you're not stopped you're going to be

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.940 
you're not stopped you're going to be
unbalanced<00:02:01.020> when<00:02:01.259> you're<00:02:01.409> making<00:02:01.799> this

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
unbalanced when you're making this

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.709 
unbalanced when you're making this
stroke<00:02:02.310> and<00:02:02.549> then<00:02:03.149> it's<00:02:03.420> going<00:02:03.540> to<00:02:03.600> be

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
stroke and then it's going to be

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:11.690 
stroke and then it's going to be
difficult<00:02:03.990> to<00:02:04.320> recover<00:02:04.979> for<00:02:05.490> the<00:02:05.549> next<00:02:05.850> ball

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.130 

so<00:02:12.700> you<00:02:12.790> can<00:02:12.940> see<00:02:13.150> that<00:02:13.180> whenever<00:02:13.599> Jeff's

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
so you can see that whenever Jeff's

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.380 
so you can see that whenever Jeff's
hitting<00:02:14.470> the<00:02:14.560> ball<00:02:14.739> now<00:02:14.980> his<00:02:15.580> feet<00:02:15.940> of<00:02:16.060> stop

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
hitting the ball now his feet of stop

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.900 
hitting the ball now his feet of stop
he's<00:02:16.750> in<00:02:16.989> position<00:02:17.349> and<00:02:17.680> then<00:02:18.370> he<00:02:18.459> makes<00:02:18.670> his

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
he's in position and then he makes his

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:37.080 
he's in position and then he makes his
stroke<00:02:19.180> and<00:02:23.130> Jeff<00:02:24.130> can<00:02:24.340> do<00:02:24.459> it<00:02:24.520> super<00:02:24.910> fast<00:02:36.090> so

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
stroke and Jeff can do it super fast so

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:38.460 
stroke and Jeff can do it super fast so
the<00:02:37.180> footwork<00:02:37.510> movement<00:02:37.959> is<00:02:38.050> called<00:02:38.260> a

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
the footwork movement is called a

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.550 
the footwork movement is called a
shuffle<00:02:38.860> step<00:02:39.099> but<00:02:39.610> in<00:02:39.790> reality<00:02:40.120> it's<00:02:40.780> best<00:02:41.319> if

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
shuffle step but in reality it's best if

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.620 
shuffle step but in reality it's best if

you're jumping with both legs at the
same<00:02:43.690> time<00:02:44.140> you'll<00:02:44.739> notice<00:02:45.100> that<00:02:45.250> all<00:02:45.400> the

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459 
same time you'll notice that all the

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:49.080 
same time you'll notice that all the
best<00:02:45.910> players<00:02:46.209> use<00:02:47.200> both<00:02:47.769> their<00:02:48.069> legs<00:02:48.250> at<00:02:48.940> the

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
best players use both their legs at the

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.509 
best players use both their legs at the
same<00:02:49.239> time<00:02:49.660> they've<00:02:50.530> got<00:02:50.769> their<00:02:50.920> feet<00:02:51.130> nice

00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:51.519

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:54.059 
same time they've got their feet nice
and<00:02:51.549> wide<00:02:51.790> apart<00:02:52.239> knees<00:02:53.080> bent<00:02:53.470> and<00:02:53.709> it's

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:54.069 
and wide apart knees bent and it's

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:56.100 
and wide apart knees bent and it's
almost<00:02:54.430> like<00:02:54.700> they've<00:02:54.880> got<00:02:55.090> a<00:02:55.209> rod<00:02:55.600> between

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
almost like they've got a rod between

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:58.289 
almost like they've got a rod between
their<00:02:56.319> knees<00:02:56.350> and<00:02:56.799> all<00:02:57.549> that's<00:02:57.730> happening<00:02:58.150> is

00:02:58.289 --> 00:02:58.299 
their knees and all that's happening is

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:00.830 
their knees and all that's happening is
that<00:02:58.330> they<00:02:58.660> jump<00:02:58.989> sideways<00:02:59.650> this<00:03:00.040> way<00:03:00.100> and

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
that they jump sideways this way and

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.130 
that they jump sideways this way and
sideways<00:03:01.840> that<00:03:02.140> way<00:03:02.489> if<00:03:03.489> at<00:03:04.120> the<00:03:04.420> start<00:03:04.780> you're

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140 
sideways that way if at the start you're

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:06.390 
sideways that way if at the start you're
finding<00:03:05.500> it<00:03:05.620> difficult<00:03:05.799> to<00:03:06.130> make<00:03:06.370> that

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
finding it difficult to make that

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.860 
finding it difficult to make that
movement<00:03:07.060> you<00:03:07.299> can<00:03:07.330> use<00:03:07.920> the<00:03:08.920> shuffle<00:03:09.340> step<00:03:09.880> to

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
movement you can use the shuffle step to

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.220 
movement you can use the shuffle step to
get<00:03:11.049> there<00:03:11.290> but<00:03:11.920> in<00:03:12.700> reality<00:03:13.030> i<00:03:13.510> want<00:03:13.930> you<00:03:14.109> to
