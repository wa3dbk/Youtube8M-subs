00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.620
 Hi everyone guys and welcome this 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:19.810
 new tutorial 

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:22.980
 today I will explain to you how to transform 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:26.080
 windows 7 in windows seen graphically 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.300
 then to do this let's download this 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:30.490
 archive from the link I will put you in 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.950
 description within this 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:34.720
 archive there are various folders in the 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:38.080
 windows vista theme folder 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:40.810
 there is the theme of windows vista 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:43.510
 then in the ogden patch folder there will be 

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:45.870
 the patch that we will then apply vi 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:48.280
 I will explain why we should apply it in 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.680
 wallpapers windows vista there are some 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:53.710
 Windows Vista and 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:56.830
 windows vista orbis will be there 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:59.250
 lorbek and windows vista we will have to 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:02.410
 apply to the taskbar 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.449
 before starting the tutorial I want 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:06.130
 advise you to create a point of 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:09.039
 restore because during 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:12.520
 proceeding could occur 

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:14.920
 error and therefore if an error occurs 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:17.229
 just restore and stay operational 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:21.960
 so let's go to start and type 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:21.960
 create a restore point 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:29.289
 select the unit where it is installed 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:34.480
 the operational theme and then click on 

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:37.660
 create here will ask us to give a name to the 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:39.670
 to the restore point and then after 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:41.650
 given the name we click on create I do not 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:45.790
 I will create it because I have already created a 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:55.750
 world of recovery ok now we take 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:58.380
 the right-click archive here extracts the 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:01.930
 first folder will be hoc stand patch 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:05.430
 then the patch must be applied 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:10.180
 because in all versions of windows 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:12.790
 the themes downloaded by the parties do not 

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:15.370
 in fact they can be installed 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.360
 windows recognizes them as non-themes 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.490
 official 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:21.780
 then this patch goes to change three 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:25.330
 system files to allow 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:27.250
 installation of unofficial themes 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:30.520
 so let's open the folder and how 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:34.630
 we can see there are two applications 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:37.000
 the first universal dampier x64 is the 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:42.130
 patch because it is a 64 operating system 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:44.320
 bit and universal dampier x86 is peace 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:45.850
 because it has a 32-bit perativo visa for 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.720
 see the bits of our system 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:49.989
 operating 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:52.510
 let's go to start computer owned by 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:56.020
 system and system type we can 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:57.760
 read the bits of our system 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:59.400
 operating in this case admits returns to 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:03.670
 the beat so me 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:05.980
 I will start universal dampier x86 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:09.390
 you must start it co-administrator then 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.930
 right click run as administrator 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:13.709
 here 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.709
 click on ok 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:18.610
 in this window we click on 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:21.910
 seafarer to enter the patch and behold 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:24.340
 here the patch then here are listed i 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:29.140
 files we're going to change and for each 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:31.959
 file there is the patch button you need 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:35.320
 just to change the file and button 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:38.170
 restore that serves to restore i 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:40.780
 file in the original condition then 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:47.010
 we click on patches on these three 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:47.010
 buttons for until they are darkened 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:56.580
 ok 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:58.650
 once clicked on the button for 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:01.920
 peace will ask us to restart the 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:04.890
 computer to apply the changes 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:06.900
 we click on yes I am now though 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:12.390
 the video and when the system will be 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:15.989
 rebooted i will take it back i am the 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:20.340
 computer is restarted and now let's move on 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:22.049
 to the next stage or we have to 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:23.910
 make small changes to the 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:28.200
 taskbar so let's go 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:31.680
 on it right-click properties here 

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:33.960
 check it uses small icons and in this one 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:37.590
 the less we choose not to combine 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:40.250
 apply ok now we have to change 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:43.229
 gross or windows 7 start button 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:45.120
 I advise you to follow one of my videos 

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:49.350
 tutorial where exactly explains how 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:53.460
 change start button then change 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:58.620
 the start button that will be the one for 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:05:12.539
 windows vista which is located in the 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:15.150
 windows vista orbis folder ok a 

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:17.450
 once changed 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:20.370
 we can move on to the next step 

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:22.200
 or install the windows theme 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:23.039
 view then we have the theme folder 

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:25.470
 windows vista 

00:05:23.039 --> 00:05:30.780
 as we can see here is one 

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:34.590
 folder and two files the view folder vs 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:36.990
 this file here and what file view vs 

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:39.960
 if we want the windows vista theme 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:44.039
 we have to take the folder and the file 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:46.080
 track vs if we want instead the theme of 

00:05:44.039 --> 00:05:49.229
 windows vista with aero effects 

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:54.289
 we must take this other theme and there 

00:05:49.229 --> 00:05:58.080
 let's go to start computer 

00:05:54.289 --> 00:06:03.060
 local tax office windows 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:07.030
 resources dance right button and paste 

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:08.290
 ok now let's go to the desktop button 

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:12.760
 right 

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:15.850
 customize and in the themes section 

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:17.800
 installed we can see that there is the 

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:20.290
 theme view vs 

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:24.160
 if you have entered it in the adams folder 

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:27.250
 also the aero effect file 

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:30.640
 then here you have another theme 

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:33.160
 we click on the theme windows vista and 

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:34.740
 we are waiting for windows to apply all 

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:40.540
 changes 

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:44.190
 ok as we can see windows apply 

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:46.810
 to all changes by changing the background 

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:49.000
 and if we open a folder we can 

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:52.000
 see that scaling rates 

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.740
 they are smaller like those in windows 

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.750
 view 

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:58.660
 obviously if you have put the areo file 

00:06:55.750 --> 00:07:00.340
 will be the same as those of windows 

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:06.220
 seven 

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:07.890
 and here is this colored strip 

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:10.840
 windows view 

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:13.540
 if I wanted to change the background we have 

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:17.950
 the white papers windows vista e folder 

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:26.040
 we choose the background we like best 

00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:33.720
 example we choose this here ok and now 

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:38.290
 you will have the Windows Vista theme 

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:43.200
 ok for this tutorial is everything i hope 

00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:43.200
 was helpful to you and to the next tutorial
