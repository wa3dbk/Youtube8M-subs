00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
and that is how to improve the

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.780 
and that is how to improve the
performance<00:00:08.670> of<00:00:09.240> your<00:00:09.300> iphone<00:00:09.840> 3g<00:00:10.790> it's

assumed that your phone is jailbroken

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:16.369 
assumed that your phone is jailbroken
but<00:00:14.460> these<00:00:14.880> four<00:00:15.299> steps<00:00:15.420> have<00:00:15.960> helped<00:00:16.260> me<00:00:16.350> a

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
but these four steps have helped me a

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.340 
but these four steps have helped me a
great<00:00:16.470> deal<00:00:16.770> and<00:00:17.250> that<00:00:17.310> is<00:00:17.430> one<00:00:17.820> set<00:00:18.779> up<00:00:18.930> a<00:00:19.080> swap

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
great deal and that is one set up a swap

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.460 
great deal and that is one set up a swap

to do it and it's very easy you
basically<00:00:25.350> take<00:00:25.710> to<00:00:26.580> xml<00:00:27.150> files<00:00:27.510> with<00:00:27.960> a<00:00:27.990> dot

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
basically take to xml files with a dot

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.200 
basically take to xml files with a dot
plist<00:00:28.769> extension<00:00:29.460> and<00:00:29.580> put<00:00:29.820> them<00:00:29.939> in<00:00:30.029> two

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
plist extension and put them in two

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.720 
plist extension and put them in two
different<00:00:30.619> directories<00:00:31.619> in<00:00:31.650> re<00:00:31.980> spring<00:00:32.430> and

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
different directories in re spring and

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.729 
different directories in re spring and
that<00:00:33.090> will<00:00:33.270> help<00:00:33.510> you<00:00:33.690> a<00:00:33.719> lot<00:00:34.050> in<00:00:34.350> terms<00:00:34.530> of

getting back memory ram the next one is
to<00:00:39.120> disabled<00:00:39.780> unused<00:00:40.649> demons<00:00:41.430> this<00:00:42.030> is<00:00:42.210> very

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
to disabled unused demons this is very

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.619 
to disabled unused demons this is very
helpful<00:00:42.809> to<00:00:43.559> some<00:00:44.550> folks<00:00:44.789> say<00:00:44.940> to<00:00:45.090> delete<00:00:45.480> them

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
helpful to some folks say to delete them

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.750 
helpful to some folks say to delete them
I<00:00:45.719> don't<00:00:46.079> delete<00:00:46.469> them<00:00:46.680> I<00:00:46.829> just<00:00:47.160> go<00:00:47.370> in<00:00:47.579> and

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
I don't delete them I just go in and

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.590 
I don't delete them I just go in and
rename<00:00:48.270> them<00:00:48.629> with<00:00:49.350> a<00:00:49.379> dot<00:00:49.710> capital<00:00:50.460> o<00:00:50.610> so<00:00:51.420> that

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
rename them with a dot capital o so that

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.420 
rename them with a dot capital o so that
then<00:00:51.719> when<00:00:51.840> you<00:00:51.930> re<00:00:52.140> spring<00:00:52.530> it<00:00:52.710> doesn't<00:00:53.129> run

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
then when you re spring it doesn't run

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.970 
then when you re spring it doesn't run
those<00:00:53.789> demons<00:00:54.449> I<00:00:54.629> want<00:00:55.260> to<00:00:55.379> keep<00:00:55.559> them<00:00:55.710> for<00:00:55.949> a

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
those demons I want to keep them for a

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.880 
those demons I want to keep them for a
rainy<00:00:56.190> day<00:00:56.430> so<00:00:56.969> I<00:00:57.000> don't<00:00:57.420> delete<00:00:57.870> them<00:00:58.050> the

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
rainy day so I don't delete them the

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.189 
rainy day so I don't delete them the
next<00:00:59.250> one<00:00:59.430> is<00:00:59.460> to<00:00:59.760> install<00:01:00.090> a<00:01:00.149> package<00:01:00.899> from

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
next one is to install a package from

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.369 
next one is to install a package from
cydia<00:01:01.649> called<00:01:02.070> fake<00:01:02.399> clock<00:01:02.879> up<00:01:03.180> that<00:01:03.809> helped

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
cydia called fake clock up that helped

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.770 
cydia called fake clock up that helped
in<00:01:04.559> terms<00:01:04.830> of<00:01:05.010> performance<00:01:05.250> and<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.299> last<00:01:06.540> one

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
in terms of performance and the last one

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.530 
in terms of performance and the last one
is<00:01:06.810> optional<00:01:07.560> is<00:01:07.650> called<00:01:08.000> free<00:01:09.000> memory<00:01:09.270> and

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
is optional is called free memory and

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.050 
is optional is called free memory and
that's<00:01:09.689> also<00:01:09.990> from<00:01:10.409> Cydia<00:01:10.830> all<00:01:11.070> that<00:01:11.760> does<00:01:12.030> is

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
that's also from Cydia all that does is

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.179 
that's also from Cydia all that does is
help<00:01:12.510> you<00:01:12.720> really<00:01:13.049> with<00:01:13.229> memory<00:01:13.650> management

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
help you really with memory management

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:18.890 
help you really with memory management
but<00:01:14.549> not<00:01:14.760> so<00:01:15.119> much<00:01:15.450> with<00:01:16.100> them<00:01:17.600> you<00:01:18.600> know<00:01:18.720> as

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
memory first I don't know if you can see

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.340 
memory first I don't know if you can see
the<00:01:27.030> top<00:01:27.240> corner<00:01:27.540> of<00:01:27.720> my<00:01:27.780> screen<00:01:27.840> there<00:01:28.200> it

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
the top corner of my screen there it

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.520 
the top corner of my screen there it
says<00:01:28.500> I<00:01:28.530> have<00:01:28.799> 62<00:01:29.280> megabytes<00:01:30.110> well<00:01:31.110> before<00:01:31.500> I

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
says I have 62 megabytes well before I

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.100 
says I have 62 megabytes well before I
did<00:01:31.860> all<00:01:32.070> this<00:01:32.250> I<00:01:32.490> never<00:01:32.880> got<00:01:33.119> up<00:01:33.299> to<00:01:33.420> 62<00:01:33.840> so

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
did all this I never got up to 62 so

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.690 
did all this I never got up to 62 so
we're<00:01:34.259> going<00:01:34.350> to<00:01:34.439> hit<00:01:34.590> that<00:01:34.770> free<00:01:35.100> memory<00:01:35.310> but

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
we're going to hit that free memory but

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.179 
we're going to hit that free memory but
and<00:01:35.909> see<00:01:36.090> if<00:01:36.210> it'll<00:01:36.329> give<00:01:36.570> us<00:01:36.600> some<00:01:36.930> more<00:01:37.189> and

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
and see if it'll give us some more and

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:39.890 
and see if it'll give us some more and
you<00:01:38.340> not<00:01:38.520> really<00:01:38.850> hurtin<00:01:39.210> anything<00:01:39.420> all<00:01:39.720> this

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
is going to do is release any objects

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.060 
is going to do is release any objects
that<00:01:42.450> have<00:01:42.570> been<00:01:42.720> out<00:01:42.840> there<00:01:43.020> allocated<00:01:43.829> that

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
that have been out there allocated that

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:58.200 
that have been out there allocated that
are<00:01:44.280> being<00:01:44.579> not<00:01:44.880> being<00:01:45.180> used<00:01:45.479> right<00:01:45.720> now

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.210 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:05.020

okay looks like it's done and it looks
like<00:02:05.270> i<00:02:05.479> went<00:02:05.630> from<00:02:05.719> 58<00:02:06.259> 265<00:02:07.219> salt<00:02:07.579> i'll<00:02:07.819> take

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
like i went from 58 265 salt i'll take

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:11.619 
like i went from 58 265 salt i'll take
that<00:02:08.209> extra<00:02:09.129> seven<00:02:10.129> megabytes<00:02:10.879> so<00:02:11.269> let's<00:02:11.480> see

00:02:11.619 --> 00:02:11.629 
that extra seven megabytes so let's see

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:14.110 
that extra seven megabytes so let's see
what<00:02:11.660> city<00:02:12.019> does<00:02:12.349> to<00:02:12.650> the<00:02:13.040> phone<00:02:13.310> click<00:02:13.970> on

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
what city does to the phone click on

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.740 
what city does to the phone click on
cydia<00:02:15.069> it's<00:02:16.069> starting<00:02:16.489> here<00:02:16.640> at<00:02:16.730> 66<00:02:17.450> it's

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
cydia it's starting here at 66 it's

these things these particular demons

00:07:15.219 --> 00:07:19.380 
these things these particular demons
that<00:07:15.849> gives<00:07:16.090> me<00:07:16.240> the<00:07:16.390> ability<00:07:17.130> to<00:07:18.130> have<00:07:18.430> in

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:19.390 
that gives me the ability to have in

00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:21.659 
that gives me the ability to have in
other<00:07:19.599> words<00:07:19.810> the<00:07:20.620> machine<00:07:21.010> will<00:07:21.219> load<00:07:21.460> and

00:07:21.659 --> 00:07:21.669 
other words the machine will load and

00:07:21.669 --> 00:07:23.850 
other words the machine will load and
run<00:07:21.820> faster<00:07:22.570> so<00:07:22.780> this<00:07:22.930> is<00:07:23.080> another<00:07:23.349> one<00:07:23.590> so
