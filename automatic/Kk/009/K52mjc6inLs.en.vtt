know

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:10.500 
know
typically<00:02:08.670> Western<00:02:09.670> Conference<00:02:10.060> teams<00:02:10.300> that

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:10.510 
typically Western Conference teams that

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:12.600 
typically Western Conference teams that
put<00:02:10.720> clay<00:02:10.930> around<00:02:11.200> 500<00:02:11.920> which<00:02:12.070> is<00:02:12.250> where<00:02:12.460> the

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
put clay around 500 which is where the

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.880 
put clay around 500 which is where the
Lakers<00:02:13.000> might<00:02:13.270> be<00:02:13.540> they<00:02:14.260> typically<00:02:14.620> have<00:02:14.740> a

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
Lakers might be they typically have a

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:16.650 
Lakers might be they typically have a
winning<00:02:15.220> home<00:02:15.520> record<00:02:15.970> and<00:02:16.180> a<00:02:16.240> pretty<00:02:16.420> bad

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
winning home record and a pretty bad

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.710 
winning home record and a pretty bad
Road<00:02:17.650> record<00:02:18.130> so<00:02:18.430> you're<00:02:18.880> getting<00:02:19.090> six<00:02:19.510> with

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
Road record so you're getting six with

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.710 
Road record so you're getting six with
the<00:02:19.840> Lakers<00:02:20.260> if<00:02:21.190> they<00:02:21.580> are<00:02:21.820> that<00:02:22.090> team<00:02:22.420> that

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
the Lakers if they are that team that

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.380 
the Lakers if they are that team that
you<00:02:23.110> think<00:02:23.350> they<00:02:23.470> could<00:02:23.710> be<00:02:23.740> in<00:02:24.640> that<00:02:24.700> 500

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
you think they could be in that 500

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.270 
you think they could be in that 500
range<00:02:25.540> than<00:02:25.810> they<00:02:25.930> should<00:02:25.960> at<00:02:26.500> the<00:02:26.920> very<00:02:26.950> least

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
range than they should at the very least

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.120 
range than they should at the very least

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:42.120 
Lakers will be any good this year I

think that you know not really sold on

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.460 
think that you know not really sold on
Jeremy<00:02:42.580> Lin<00:02:42.790> I<00:02:42.970> just<00:02:43.150> think<00:02:43.330> you<00:02:43.930> know<00:02:44.050> Boozer

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470

Lin Brian they help they're all good

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.250 
Lin Brian they help they're all good
offensively<00:02:48.910> defensively<00:02:49.750> this<00:02:49.960> is<00:02:50.080> going<00:02:50.200> to

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
offensively defensively this is going to

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.740 
offensively defensively this is going to
be<00:02:50.350> a<00:02:50.380> very<00:02:50.440> weak<00:02:51.010> team<00:02:51.540> rebounding<00:02:52.540> wise<00:02:52.690> i

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
be a very weak team rebounding wise i

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:54.480 
be a very weak team rebounding wise i
think<00:02:53.140> they're<00:02:53.230> going<00:02:53.350> to<00:02:53.410> be<00:02:53.560> terrible<00:02:54.040> and<00:02:54.430> i

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:54.490 
think they're going to be terrible and i

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:56.220 
think they're going to be terrible and i
think<00:02:54.700> on<00:02:54.850> the<00:02:54.940> interior<00:02:55.420> is<00:02:55.660> where<00:02:56.050> they're

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
think on the interior is where they're

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.850 
think on the interior is where they're
going<00:02:56.350> to<00:02:56.410> be<00:02:57.900> excused<00:02:58.900> heal<00:02:59.200> and<00:02:59.470> I<00:02:59.830> think

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860 
going to be excused heal and I think

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.010 
going to be excused heal and I think
that<00:03:00.250> tonight<00:03:00.700> you<00:03:01.120> got<00:03:01.270> a<00:03:01.300> team<00:03:01.570> that<00:03:01.780> cut<00:03:01.990> is

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:02.020 
that tonight you got a team that cut is

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:03.900 
that tonight you got a team that cut is
coming<00:03:02.470> to<00:03:02.560> town<00:03:02.740> that's<00:03:02.980> very<00:03:03.250> strong<00:03:03.580> on<00:03:03.790> the

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
coming to town that's very strong on the

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:06.900 
coming to town that's very strong on the
inside<00:03:04.240> you<00:03:04.870> have<00:03:04.900> Dwight<00:03:05.260> Howard<00:03:05.830> this<00:03:06.730> is<00:03:06.880> a

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
inside you have Dwight Howard this is a

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:08.550 
inside you have Dwight Howard this is a
bit<00:03:07.180> of<00:03:07.210> a<00:03:07.330> revenge<00:03:07.750> game<00:03:08.020> for<00:03:08.230> how<00:03:08.380> it

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
bit of a revenge game for how it

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.110 
bit of a revenge game for how it
obviously<00:03:08.890> is<00:03:09.040> how<00:03:09.160> the<00:03:09.220> Lakers<00:03:09.610> treated<00:03:10.000> him

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
obviously is how the Lakers treated him

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.690 
obviously is how the Lakers treated him
he'll<00:03:10.270> be<00:03:10.420> happy<00:03:10.720> to<00:03:10.750> be<00:03:10.930> back<00:03:11.110> and<00:03:11.350> eat<00:03:12.130> up<00:03:12.370> the

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
he'll be happy to be back and eat up the

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.090 
he'll be happy to be back and eat up the
Lakers<00:03:13.090> inside<00:03:13.630> and<00:03:13.960> this<00:03:14.560> is<00:03:14.650> just<00:03:14.800> a<00:03:14.890> more

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:15.100 
Lakers inside and this is just a more

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.940 
Lakers inside and this is just a more
complete<00:03:15.430> team<00:03:15.790> you<00:03:16.000> got<00:03:16.150> hardened<00:03:16.960> Beverly

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
complete team you got hardened Beverly

you know quality players all across the

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:22.560 
you know quality players all across the
court<00:03:21.160> whereas<00:03:21.400> the<00:03:21.550> lakers<00:03:21.910> are<00:03:22.030> trying<00:03:22.450> to

time I just think it's a little bit too

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:32.190 
time I just think it's a little bit too
much<00:03:30.850> to<00:03:31.090> ask<00:03:31.120> of<00:03:31.450> the<00:03:31.540> Lakers<00:03:31.870> I<00:03:31.960> think<00:03:32.140> the

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.200 
much to ask of the Lakers I think the

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.590 
much to ask of the Lakers I think the
Rockets<00:03:32.650> come<00:03:32.860> in<00:03:33.010> here<00:03:33.310> and<00:03:33.460> actually<00:03:34.090> cover

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:34.600 
Rockets come in here and actually cover

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.810 
Rockets come in here and actually cover
the<00:03:35.050> big<00:03:35.230> spread<00:03:35.650> one<00:03:36.220> last<00:03:36.430> thing<00:03:36.610> I'll<00:03:36.790> add

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:36.820 
the big spread one last thing I'll add

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:40.110 
the big spread one last thing I'll add
is<00:03:37.390> just<00:03:37.690> I<00:03:37.870> think<00:03:38.380> it<00:03:38.680> says<00:03:38.950> a<00:03:38.980> lot<00:03:39.190> about<00:03:39.670> the

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 
is just I think it says a lot about the

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.450 
is just I think it says a lot about the
lakers<00:03:40.570> at<00:03:41.440> least<00:03:41.710> from<00:03:41.920> the<00:03:42.100> quote<00:03:42.340> unquote

remember<00:03:47.620> as<00:03:47.830> I<00:03:47.950> mentioned<00:03:48.280> that<00:03:48.340> Rockets<00:03:48.850> are

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060 
remember as I mentioned that Rockets are

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:51.570 
remember as I mentioned that Rockets are
not<00:03:49.540> perceived<00:03:49.990> as<00:03:50.200> being<00:03:50.440> an<00:03:50.770> upper<00:03:51.400> echelon

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:57.580 
Golden State's of the world but they're

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:59.640 
Golden State's of the world but they're
not<00:03:57.700> the<00:03:57.940> Spurs<00:03:58.330> they're<00:03:58.750> not<00:03:58.930> the<00:03:59.170> Thunder

00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.650 
not the Spurs they're not the Thunder

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:02.730 
not the Spurs they're not the Thunder
yet<00:04:00.340> even<00:04:00.670> so<00:04:01.180> there's<00:04:01.480> six<00:04:01.840> point<00:04:02.170> favorite

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:02.740 
yet even so there's six point favorite

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:04.830 
yet even so there's six point favorite
in<00:04:02.950> Los<00:04:03.220> Angeles<00:04:03.250> which<00:04:04.240> is<00:04:04.390> a<00:04:04.420> little<00:04:04.690> bit

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 
in Los Angeles which is a little bit

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.930 
in Los Angeles which is a little bit
surprising<00:04:05.260> I<00:04:05.620> think<00:04:05.830> that<00:04:05.980> shows<00:04:06.280> what<00:04:06.790> the

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:06.940 
surprising I think that shows what the

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:08.700 
surprising I think that shows what the
oddsmakers<00:04:07.270> think<00:04:07.810> of<00:04:07.960> the<00:04:08.080> Lakers<00:04:08.500> and

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:08.710 
oddsmakers think of the Lakers and

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:11.850 
oddsmakers think of the Lakers and
that's<00:04:09.220> not<00:04:09.460> very<00:04:09.610> much<00:04:09.910> right<00:04:10.810> they<00:04:11.440> really

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:11.860 
that's not very much right they really
