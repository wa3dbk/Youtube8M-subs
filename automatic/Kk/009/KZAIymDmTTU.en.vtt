00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.189
 hello youtube personal in this video 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:11.940
 I'm showing the interested parties a 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:15.890
 homemade design nor meaning of 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.930
 timer controlled irrigation 

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:22.020
 electromechanical 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:24.119
 before showing the system already mounted 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:29.099
 I'll give you some instructions on how to 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:31.500
 set the time or timer since 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:34.649
 for those who have never seen a 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:37.950
 device to find some 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:40.260
 difficulties for the program since the 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.800
 instruction manual 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:47.789
 it comes very simple that sometimes it is 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:50.640
 difficult to understand is the model that 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:54.120
 What I'm wearing is the brand I 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:58.949
 the mechanic is one of the cheapest 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:01.320
 market costs around 20 reais 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:05.909
 now there are several other models 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:08.640
 brands are more sophisticated than they cost 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:11.210
 much more expensive but it works 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.210
 perfectly 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:20.210
 the appliance operates the system 24 hours 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:24.150
 being now divided every 15 minutes 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:27.450
 the black side if you go very close 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:31.950
 of it is all prepared in small 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:39.360
 slices of more help from a pen is 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:42.119
 you can do aaa programming is okay 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:47.460
 firmly confirm that the red button 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:50.369
 since before it was things are o observe 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:55.490
 and notes that the lock has to 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:55.490
 Being hidden will bring my life. 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:59.729
 check that the slices are all in the 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:05.300
 high position 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:09.040
 This is a low beauty 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:12.980
 is to manage and turn the wheel clockwise 

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:15.580
 to set the local time 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:20.830
 this example I will put 14 hours 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:25.700
 coinciding with the arrow on Friday and 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:29.150
 I'm going to program to call at 7 o'clock 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:31.690
 the tip of the pen will lower the slice is 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:34.280
 referring to 7 o'clock 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:38.080
 remembering that a single slice leaves the 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:40.550
 system energizes up to 7 hours to 15 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:44.300
 represents as little as possible for this 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:48.440
 timer device that shuts off after 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:51.470
 automatically if you want to stay connected 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:58.910
 for 30 minutes plus two slices in 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:03:02.720
 sequence is from the button 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:07.150
 red for position down there 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:11.780
 that the lock for will be appearing behind 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:14.440
 Then plug the power cord plug into 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:14.440
 essay 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:25.480
 This connection is made later one 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:31.610
 washing machine solenoid valve 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:34.209
 wire garden hose connections 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:39.160
 electric one-and-a-half millimeter 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:43.040
 Look for making TV CD34 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:47.270
 previously punctured with 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:49.430
 drill to form when climbing in a 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:51.230
 car for both one of the photos of the 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:55.420
 pvc pipe 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:55.420
 Let's see how it works. 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:06.440
 see there I fixed the valve 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:12.560
 solenoid on the device and its creativity 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:15.380
 and do otherwise 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:19.430
 ah you garden hose you can do 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:22.280
 a cane that wanted to be direct and will give 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:31.340
 your will 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:35.120
 see how the water works right 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:39.560
 It will rain and for 15 minutes in that 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:42.400
 time was to schedule there in the team 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:42.400
 that's it 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.850
 thanks guys
