00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 hello with you about hermione and today 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:05.970
 i would like to talk to you about 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:10.920
 demanding customers 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:13.190
 yes yes it is about these people who are 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.230
 to me personally very often come and 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:17.180
 often enough I hear from my other 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.529
 pupils 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:21.390
 the organizers that here comes the client 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.279
 which requires a lot of forces 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.439
 do the impossible and that thing 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.660
 interesting they just make you do 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.119
 impossible and you really do it 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.610
 yourself not knowing how so recently to me 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.890
 a client came who wanted 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.140
 the salute seemed banal absolutely 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.000
 the salute phenomenon but it so happened that in 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.160
 this time in a restaurant on site 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.239
 restaurants banned shoots the most 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:47.579
 salute and forbidden nobody be a 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:50.820
 the first president of Ukraine that is how are you 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:53.039
 understand in general, useless 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.989
 we tried in every way possible 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.090
 there contact with his guard 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.800
 there talk about the fact that there we will not 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.440
 it's late to shoot him but in general, that's all 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.439
 our attempts were unsuccessful and in 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.909
 the result when we told the customer about 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.740
 the fact that he simplify it in any way 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:11.340
 Impossible despite the fact that our client also 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:13.590
 was a weighty enough figure he them 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.860
 said i know nothing i want salute here 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.689
 and no matter how salute I should be 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.080
 telling you how we shot 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:24.869
 salute as many different came 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.720
 mars here's how we had asking how 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:31.829
 our iso flyers for a few more 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:35.490
 weeks to solve these issues but actually 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:38.479
 we did what the client wanted because 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.979
 that the client did not leave us any chance 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:43.740
 before when looking at such people 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:46.049
 it already became me I think about what 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.960
 a nightmare why people behave like this why 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:52.229
 they make you do the impossible 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:55.020
 but every time with each client I 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:57.119
 Began to understand what it turns out exactly 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.329
 these people show something impossible 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:02.909
 always possible and that if you will 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:05.009
 require you will receive exactly 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.700
 For this reason, many customers are considered 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.500
 moody really 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:11.110
 it's just those people who can 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.879
 squeeze and know what if 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:15.760
 it is impossible to pin down a little 

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:17.950
 it becomes possible I am a good student 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.950
 not only a teacher so I quickly learn 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:23.170
 and actually these are the same tactics and 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.360
 technology apply and in relation to their 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.880
 pupils and in his 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:30.730
 in general, ordinary life so came to 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:32.440
 hotel in bali where am i at the moment 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:36.010
 Now I am a movie you for sure 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:38.140
 see when I already returned and when we 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:41.110
 we came here first we were singapore 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.340
 then Bali flew to Bali from a sheep 2 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:45.099
 allowable stress 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:47.410
 telling you it will hurt so much more 

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:50.709
 Naturally, so we flew to Singapore 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:54.579
 in a huge hotel to us on the first evening 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:57.579
 They said that unfortunately the number with 

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:59.530
 big king bed can't us 

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:01.450
 now give because there are no free 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.130
 the rooms will move us to breakfast 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.049
 night keep up please at 2 in 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.340
 separate beds we said okay without 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:08.440
 problems they burn tomorrow we are in their 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.660
 we will relocate without any nuances 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.069
 we will transfer everything and we will make but naturally 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.930
 when the next day you 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:16.019
 do you understand the bags we did not unpack 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:19.150
 from men to fly suitcases perfectly 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:22.150
 we started to expect or even transfer us 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:24.519
 to another number and generally after 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.810
 there are very long walking there huge 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:27.850
 queuing because it's crazy 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:30.639
 huge hotel and 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:34.329
 in general, only a few hours later 

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:35.920
 here we are finally resettled and we are for 

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:37.660
 ourselves decided that we are more 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.250
 will never agree because 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:42.389
 really as you know 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:44.139
 the hotel is obliged if it cannot 

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:45.940
 provide the number that we 

00:03:44.139 --> 00:03:46.989
 booked he is obliged to provide a number 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:52.889
 categories above 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:56.139
 such such general rules and so 

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:58.030
 we arrive in pain when we come to 

00:03:56.139 --> 00:04:00.880
 the hotel and here we are told the same thing again 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:02.650
 the most sorry we will give you today 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:05.140
 room with two beds and then through 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:09.250
 three or four days I donâ€™t remember we 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:12.460
 moved naturally having already such an experience 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:15.730
 we immediately said no and probably in 

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:17.470
 within an hour not figured out something 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:19.390
 came and told us to listen to what 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:21.310
 again not in the end they promised us 

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:22.720
 move room the next day what 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:24.850
 here is some number of free 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.740
 but again we stood our ground because 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:29.050
 that living on the suitcases is absolutely not 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:30.940
 We wanted to relax and wanted to 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:33.190
 rest from the beginning unpacked what 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:35.080
 suitcases and in general not to not be in 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:38.530
 waiting for it to move somewhere 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:41.170
 and here several times we were told no 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:43.000
 There are no rooms for a new hotel 

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:45.460
 the year is scored almost 100 percent 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.530
 so we nodded their heads saying that we them 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:50.920
 very much we understand and what will we have 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:53.520
 then live at the reception desk here is just one 

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:57.310
 an hour of torment and terror on our part 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:05:00.400
 that's just not in the form of hard and in the end 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:02.350
 we are relocated to the room probably for a couple 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:04.840
 categories higher than what was ordered 

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:07.090
 we we suspect that this is a number of some kind 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:09.280
 such from someone backup 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:12.340
 guide from the hotel or top management 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:14.980
 because we have here and two bathrooms and 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:18.030
 meeting room and everything 

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:22.330
 wonderful and everything is gorgeous whether we are happy 

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:24.370
 we definitely did bad or good 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:26.020
 no, we just wanted to get ours 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:28.930
 room and if the hotel could not us it 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:31.360
 provide something actually here they gave 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:33.070
 us another number the beauty I am that 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:34.960
 because we can not in this room 

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:36.790
 hold for two days and then get 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:38.740
 move naturally hotel falls on 

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:41.729
 money for the length of stay that we 

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:44.699
 We are here but at the same time 

00:05:41.729 --> 00:05:47.520
 we were pleased with the hotel here and so 

00:05:44.699 --> 00:05:49.469
 must behave all companies morality 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:51.300
 this fable is such that if we wanted 

00:05:49.469 --> 00:05:53.580
 be kind and nice people and 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:55.680
 would agree to inconvenience 

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:56.939
 yourself and leave the hotel here is the situation 

00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:00.120
 which is not that 

00:05:56.939 --> 00:06:02.249
 only we would suffer from it 

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:05.879
 on their part were persistent 

00:06:02.249 --> 00:06:08.009
 that's just impossible to squeeze out 

00:06:05.879 --> 00:06:10.559
 hotel and as it turned out once again 

00:06:08.009 --> 00:06:12.080
 the impossible is possible therefore do not scold 

00:06:10.559 --> 00:06:13.889
 demanding customers 

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:15.629
 stop yourself demanding 

00:06:13.889 --> 00:06:18.899
 customers enjoy it 

00:06:15.629 --> 00:06:20.460
 and better try to fulfill the promise 

00:06:18.899 --> 00:06:23.309
 to our customers and then we wo n't have 

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:25.139
 no unpleasant situations in any 

00:06:23.309 --> 00:06:28.050
 case value every customer who to 

00:06:25.139 --> 00:06:31.559
 come to you and learn from him because 

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:34.740
 it is exacting customers who teach us 

00:06:31.559 --> 00:06:36.539
 themselves how to grow and make our lives not 

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:40.879
 only better but much better 

00:06:36.539 --> 00:06:40.879
 bye everyone and see you next time
