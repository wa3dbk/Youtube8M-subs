 dot com 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:14.190
 welcome a video tutorials to the 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.750
 server and brother d angelo 3.636 and in 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.400
 this time I have been answering the 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.099
 several subscribers which I 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:23.789
 they ask very often because we can not 

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:25.980
 play dvd on our computer ok 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.110
 this is with the windows operating system 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.169
 8 the final version the pro version that 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:33.450
 it came out a few weeks ago well then 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:35.850
 they ask a lot and the answer is 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:40.050
 because microsoft did not add the windows 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:41.879
 media center to windows 8 pro to the best 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.890
 he did it by mistake I do not know the joke of 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.690
 that there is already an update for 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.870
 download it and install it in our 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:51.359
 computer then with windows 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.789
 media center we will be able to reproduce 

00:00:51.359 --> 00:00:56.280
 movies we can now play the dvds 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.710
 by default we can 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.469
 play music because if we have the 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.960
 player we have the player 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.930
 windows media but we do not have the 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.210
 windows media center then we are going to 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.650
 start with this video tutorial in the 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.299
 description of the video I'll be leaving you 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.979
 a link which will redirect you to the 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.610
 official microsoft page this is the 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.790
 common 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:20.340
 that microsoft announced to add the 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.630
 windows media center player what 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.550
 only thing we have to do is put 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:27.000
 our email in this part 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:28.260
 let's put the code the captcha that 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.270
 we have this side and we're going to 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:33.030
 select send product key 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.010
 once we have done this we 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.070
 will be arriving to our mail 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:41.400
 electronic verification code ok 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.380
 this will take approximately good 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.229
 it took me an hour to arrive but 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.700
 it may take up to 24 hours then a 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.240
 once we have our key what 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.160
 let's open here we can see that 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.810
 here is my code right now 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:57.420
 they are watching it because it is I am 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.920
 covering but here is my code that 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.560
 I want to clarify that each code 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.660
 simply activates a player that is 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.700
 this code that I have I can not 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:08.100
 happen because nothing else is for just one 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.410
 computer then with this code 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.209
 we will be adding what is the 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.730
 windows media center player and 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:16.620
 all we are going to do is copy the 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.450
 next code that I will be leaving you 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.030
 in the description of the video we are going to 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.370
 copy we are going to select 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.200
 cr to open the run menu and 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.120
 let's paste the code that I left them in 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.280
 the description once we have done 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.110
 this we have selected accept for 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.850
 select what if in this message that 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.950
 we just left and here we go to 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.959
 add what the player 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.360
 windows media center does not end 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:41.700
 select is select I already have a 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:44.480
 product key and here we are going to copy 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:48.150
 the key that sent us microsoft 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:50.340
 then I cope or I hit it from this 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.650
 side is going to check the key is going to 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:56.160
 Check if the license is accepted 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:58.290
 Remember that you do not have to pay anything 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.660
 why send you this code 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.700
 I just do it you lose in this 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.440
 page it is important that you put a 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.700
 true email since in 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.920
 that mail where the 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.470
 code the serial number that goes to 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.900
 select next ok let's accept 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:16.050
 the license terms then we go 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.700
 to select add features 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:19.800
 or that is going to be aggravating the 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.630
 characteristics here I'm going to press the 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:23.400
 video because it's going to restart the 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:25.260
 computer and I do not want to lose the 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.660
 process then pause and return when 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.920
 has finished this good process 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.840
 after several minutes of waiting 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.090
 we have returned the equipment has been 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.790
 restarted has installed all the 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:37.440
 features of windows 8 and how 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.420
 we can see here we get a message that 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.340
 says that we have added correctly 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:44.580
 the features and now we have 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:46.650
 updated our windows 8 pro by the 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:49.400
 new update that is windows 8 pro 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:51.780
 with mediacenter if we go to 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.670
 pc information found in 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:55.590
 pc information configuration 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:57.780
 we can see that we have a new 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:00.780
 version of windows 8 installed in 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:02.730
 our computer then this one 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.350
 this has been all we will be able to see 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:07.110
 our movies and we go to the menu 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:08.720
 to look we can see that already 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:11.010
 we have the windows media center 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.690
 installed on our computer already 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:15.300
 we can play our movies 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:17.760
 our videos and there will be no problems 

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:20.100
 ok I hope that with this video I have 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:22.140
 helped all the subscribers that I 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.920
 they ask in this problem what can 

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:24.930
 because I can not 

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:26.490
 in playing your movies your dvds and 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:28.830
 they had already installed all the drivers 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:30.450
 Well do not expect anything to see this 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:32.130
 has nothing to do with the drivers this 

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:34.920
 was that we had to add this 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:37.530
 feature and I want to thank 

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:40.290

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:43.910
 these last days from the departure 

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:48.390
 from windows 8 our channel has grown 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:50.580
 let's say very quickly our visits to 

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:53.280
 starting from windows 8 exit it 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:54.780
 they multiplied that practically 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:57.300
 multiplied the subscribers of the 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:58.620
 same way they multiplied and good 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.180

00:05:05.009 --> 00:05:09.810
 good reproductions all this I will follow 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:11.460
 uploading videos of windows 7 the truth 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:13.410
 is that I have the videos the videos and 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:15.599
 I have them engraved but it is simply 

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:17.970
 issue of uploading them but also not
