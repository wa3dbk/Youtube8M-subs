00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 hey people we are in the apollo tonight 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:08.130
 cinema and want to watch the movie 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:11.370
 los how big the programs from Hanover 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:13.230
 to vegan statement from the author and 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.759
 Director Lars Oppermann, we can 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.289
 Of course not as a Hanoverian 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.390
 Escape especially the movies here 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.070
 also been shot in hanover 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.810
 unfortunately we have no more tickets 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.400
 got the premiere though 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.199
 but nothing was tried but we 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.390
 have cards for today today 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.960
 the 22 sunday 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:34.290
 Roll and the movie was only 25,000 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.540
 euro budget turned what i pretty much 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.750
 blatant finds and is also at the same time 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:42.149
 the cinema debut of las offermann and yes 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.489
 this 90-minute drama is supposed to be 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.920
 on the one hand the topic of animal cruelty and 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.480
 the exploitation on a very nice as 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.390
 loose realistic style but also 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.309
 at the same time in a very charming way 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.780
 convey and how he succeeds because 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.699
 we are very excited because of the 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.739
 trailer has probably already such a 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.750
 little talk and discussions 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.280
 that's why it's all the more 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.170
 excited to see the film 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.390
 for now or to ask us 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.580
 first and then we tell you 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.240
 afterwards as we liked it and 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.240
 how the movie was like that 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.280
 we're just coming out of the cinema we are 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.660
 at home and wanted you now 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.210
 small video give latest movie 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:49.060
 So, first thing must have fallen 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:50.890
 say great that is received 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.680
 There is cinema film in Germany 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.420
 I think so synonymous first in the form 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:02:00.310
 and yes it's the vegan theme at all 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:03.250
 In the cinema , the implementation is really good 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:05.050
 that was so mixed say so now 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.090
 The movie does not really suit us now 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:10.570
 but does not convince other paladins like that 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:12.550
 well liked the story itself 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:14.170
 catch it cute so it was a bit 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.030
 the nice story days too 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:19.770
 interesting was the one or 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:22.330
 other lacher it had hurt 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:24.730
 it was also more exciting so it was 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:26.430
 really a nice story actor 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:31.720
 have done a great job 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:35.040
 that was all great and so what now 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:38.290
 I did not say it was so great 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:41.709
 there were too much information and 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:43.180
 enlightenment work in this feature film 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:47.410
 pressed format 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:50.350
 that seemed very pure and simple 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:52.600
 way too much and then packed too lumpy 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:55.720
 just not and yes just too much 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:57.760
 a lot of banging and we found that ourselves 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.620
 not so good and i think that is coming 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:02.220
 also generally not so good but that 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.900
 you can decide for yourself 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:07.480
 yes it was just it's just that 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.070
 then ask one because of the film directed 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.440
 is because we have also asked ourselves 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:12.790
 or if you thought yes in the time 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.070
 movie is probably 90th now 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.570
 percent vegan pure so as the 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:17.890
 movie is already called and if you too 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:20.920
 the film description is then speaks 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:24.070
 Of course yes and only vegan 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:26.010
 but interested people like that 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:28.900
 movie is just built 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.610
 let's say it's vegan first 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:33.160
 old hat because we already say that 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:34.480
 the prejudices and typical questions the 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.430
 the vegan like that 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.690
 are confronted are addressed 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.569
 it makes you feel a little bit 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:42.670
 confirmed as a vegan but you know the 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:43.830
 answer there would be the film of the 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:46.510
 to be delivered next to 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:48.940
 So the film around I say so really 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:51.120
 to do so in the enlightenment 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:54.690
 whole population is more like the 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:58.900
 normalos or unis as you like 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:04:02.140
 I do not think so 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:05.799
 so would go in this movie so 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:07.510
 not volunteer now if ever 

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:09.610
 together in the cinema without work like that 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:11.290
 voluntarily, this film would be under the 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:14.470
 Names and depreciations I believe 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:15.310
 Nobody normal, I 'll tell you now 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:17.500
 sting eye 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:19.570
 and there is the question where then the 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:21.910
 the effect of the film remains as I said 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:24.460
 that's actually vegan for us 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:25.870
 clearly not so for the others yet 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:28.780
 and but it is supposed to, I think 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:30.880
 reach so there do not know if the film 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:34.030
 so many we reach that is 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:35.699
 actually what we should, however, as 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:38.680
 Hanoverian in turn very good 

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:40.450
 convey 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:42.639
 the movie locations so we have a few things 

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:45.760
 again, the caritas in the cafÃ© and 

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:48.340
 nature's good in linden and so that 

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:50.110
 It was cool for us that I think so 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:51.970
 Of course , that does not like at all or 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:54.070
 I think that was not so exciting 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:55.289
 we just super hanover my cinema to 

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:58.900
 see 

00:04:55.289 --> 00:05:01.450
 So all in all it was okay 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:04.660
 what a good movie 

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:06.729
 but i believe the effect has to be 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:08.320
 So wait and see if he does not 

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:10.020
 Pulling vegans into the cinema would be great 

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:12.550
 that was really great 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:14.950
 But you have to weigh just because you have to 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:16.840
 now wait what should I say yes and 

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:18.190
 of course you can have your own opinion 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:19.840
 about the film do so 

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:21.220
 very interested look like you 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:24.010
 The trailer on me is here 

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:26.020
 youtube link below times 

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:26.920
 Or look at the times 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:30.070
 Facebook site 

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:31.780
 there are also all dates list in 

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:33.340
 which cities are still running 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:35.470
 is running here in hanover for example 

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:36.850
 yes, still on the first and on 17 april 

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:38.890
 I think there are still some cards 

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:42.400
 we would just have to go to the apollo cinema 

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:43.630
 call and pre-book tickets so 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:47.050
 I would definitely look at it 

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:48.790
 that you just saw how you did 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:51.190
 Because they think everyone has to do that himself 

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:55.420
 decide the law given so should 

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:57.880
 with java does not taste but also now 

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:59.110
 not sooo cool so it is hardly easy 

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:01.210
 ne yo 

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:03.730
 that was our opinion of the film 

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:06.070
 under you saw the then writes 

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:08.110
 It's just your opinion in the box 

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:10.720
 we would be very interesting exactly that 

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:12.190
 is very good what are you laughing to that 

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:16.410
 it was already late I liked it too 

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:16.410
 go to bed we are
