00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
of platforms so when you talk about live

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.060 
of platforms so when you talk about live
migration<00:00:19.560> that's<00:00:19.680> one<00:00:19.830> of<00:00:19.890> the<00:00:19.980> great

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
migration that's one of the great

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.830 
migration that's one of the great
attractions<00:00:20.250> of<00:00:20.760> virtualization<00:00:21.480> that<00:00:21.630> gives

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
attractions of virtualization that gives

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.470 
attractions of virtualization that gives
you<00:00:21.930> the<00:00:21.990> ability<00:00:22.170> to<00:00:22.529> migrate<00:00:23.279> a<00:00:23.760> platform

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
you the ability to migrate a platform

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.939 
you the ability to migrate a platform
from<00:00:24.570> one<00:00:24.779> server<00:00:25.050> to<00:00:25.199> the<00:00:25.380> other<00:00:25.500> without<00:00:25.650> any

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
from one server to the other without any

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.519 
from one server to the other without any
real<00:00:26.130> downtime<00:00:26.670> so<00:00:27.330> if<00:00:27.990> you<00:00:28.140> look<00:00:28.230> at<00:00:28.349> it<00:00:28.470> from

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
real downtime so if you look at it from

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.620 
real downtime so if you look at it from
a<00:00:28.680> practical<00:00:28.890> business<00:00:29.250> standpoint<00:00:29.789> if<00:00:30.390> you

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
a practical business standpoint if you

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.240 
a practical business standpoint if you
have<00:00:30.840> a<00:00:30.869> server<00:00:31.230> or<00:00:31.349> an<00:00:31.560> older<00:00:31.800> server<00:00:32.009> and<00:00:32.189> you

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
have a server or an older server and you

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.660 
have a server or an older server and you
want<00:00:32.430> to<00:00:32.520> migrate<00:00:32.759> to<00:00:33.750> a<00:00:34.110> newer<00:00:34.920> server<00:00:35.309> this

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
want to migrate to a newer server this

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.160 
want to migrate to a newer server this
could<00:00:35.940> prevent<00:00:36.300> you<00:00:36.510> from<00:00:36.570> having<00:00:36.780> to<00:00:36.960> take<00:00:37.110> a

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
could prevent you from having to take a

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.080 
could prevent you from having to take a
lot<00:00:37.350> of<00:00:37.380> downtime<00:00:37.680> so<00:00:38.520> today<00:00:38.760> we're<00:00:38.940> going<00:00:39.030> to

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
lot of downtime so today we're going to

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.090 
lot of downtime so today we're going to
show<00:00:39.180> you<00:00:39.300> a<00:00:39.390> very<00:00:39.570> simple<00:00:39.840> demonstration<00:00:40.260> now

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
show you a very simple demonstration now

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.979 
show you a very simple demonstration now
we've<00:00:41.280> got<00:00:41.460> a<00:00:41.489> variety<00:00:41.820> of<00:00:42.000> servers<00:00:42.480> from<00:00:42.690> some

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
we've got a variety of servers from some

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.639 
we've got a variety of servers from some
of<00:00:43.079> our<00:00:43.230> key<00:00:43.410> OEMs<00:00:44.040> folks<00:00:44.820> like<00:00:44.969> Dell<00:00:45.239> son<00:00:45.809> HP

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
of our key OEMs folks like Dell son HP

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.459 
of our key OEMs folks like Dell son HP
so<00:00:47.280> we're<00:00:47.489> going<00:00:47.640> to<00:00:47.910> start<00:00:47.940> with<00:00:48.539> a<00:00:48.989> revie

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
so we're going to start with a revie

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.619 
so we're going to start with a revie
system<00:00:49.920> from<00:00:50.070> the<00:00:50.129> 2003<00:00:50.879> time<00:00:51.120> frame<00:00:51.480> and

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
system from the 2003 time frame and

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.680 
system from the 2003 time frame and
migrate<00:00:52.440> it<00:00:52.590> to<00:00:53.129> six<00:00:53.460> core<00:00:53.670> AMD<00:00:54.180> opteron

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
migrate it to six core AMD opteron

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.520 
migrate it to six core AMD opteron
processors<00:00:55.280> code-named<00:00:56.280> Istanbul<00:00:56.850> so<00:00:57.530> let's

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
processors code-named Istanbul so let's

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.020 
processors code-named Istanbul so let's
watch<00:00:58.680> me<00:00:58.859> do<00:00:58.980> this<00:00:59.070> live<00:00:59.250> migration<00:00:59.789> so<00:00:59.910> it's

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
watch me do this live migration so it's

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:06.330 
watch me do this live migration so it's
pretty<00:01:00.239> simple<00:01:00.539> I'm<00:01:01.199> going<00:01:01.800> to<00:01:02.930> migrate

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:06.340 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.139 

I'm<00:01:06.759> going<00:01:06.939> to<00:01:07.000> let<00:01:07.149> it<00:01:07.179> know<00:01:07.420> which<00:01:07.689> platform

00:01:09.139 --> 00:01:09.149 
I'm going to let it know which platform

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:16.789 
I'm going to let it know which platform
and<00:01:10.149> we're<00:01:10.420> going<00:01:10.570> to<00:01:10.689> go<00:01:10.810> to<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:13.350> Istanbul

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.380 

now<00:01:17.799> you'll<00:01:18.009> notice<00:01:18.219> the<00:01:18.579> video<00:01:18.880> is<00:01:19.030> running

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:19.390 
now you'll notice the video is running

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.130 
now you'll notice the video is running
and<00:01:19.539> the<00:01:20.530> live<00:01:20.679> migration<00:01:21.310> has<00:01:21.490> started<00:01:22.140> what

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:23.140 
and the live migration has started what

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:24.840 
and the live migration has started what
you<00:01:23.289> see<00:01:23.439> at<00:01:23.530> one<00:01:23.679> point<00:01:23.860> is<00:01:24.009> a<00:01:24.100> very<00:01:24.459> slight

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:24.850 
you see at one point is a very slight

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:26.850 
you see at one point is a very slight
pause<00:01:25.119> in<00:01:25.420> the<00:01:25.509> video<00:01:25.780> but<00:01:26.350> overall<00:01:26.619> the

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:26.860 
pause in the video but overall the

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:28.800 
pause in the video but overall the
performance<00:01:27.310> keeps<00:01:27.520> going<00:01:27.819> so<00:01:28.030> if<00:01:28.569> you're<00:01:28.780> an

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810 
performance keeps going so if you're an

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:30.120 
performance keeps going so if you're an
end<00:01:29.049> user<00:01:29.229> or<00:01:29.590> you're<00:01:29.799> in<00:01:29.890> a<00:01:29.979> critical

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.130 
end user or you're in a critical

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:32.580 
end user or you're in a critical
operation<00:01:30.880> situation<00:01:31.420> this<00:01:32.319> is<00:01:32.500> an

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 
operation situation this is an

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:34.889 
operation situation this is an
opportunity<00:01:33.030> to<00:01:34.030> continue<00:01:34.359> running<00:01:34.659> without

00:01:34.889 --> 00:01:34.899 
opportunity to continue running without

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:38.460 
opportunity to continue running without
any<00:01:35.170> downtime<00:01:35.740> so<00:01:36.899> you<00:01:37.899> can<00:01:38.020> see<00:01:38.170> the<00:01:38.259> progress

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:38.470 
any downtime so you can see the progress

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:40.889 
any downtime so you can see the progress
is<00:01:38.709> happening<00:01:39.039> and<00:01:39.429> it's<00:01:39.610> done<00:01:39.849> so<00:01:40.630> we<00:01:40.810> have

00:01:40.889 --> 00:01:40.899 
is happening and it's done so we have

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:44.580 
is happening and it's done so we have
now<00:01:41.079> migrated<00:01:41.860> from<00:01:42.009> a<00:01:42.849> rev<00:01:43.119> e<00:01:43.329> opteron<00:01:44.079> system

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 
now migrated from a rev e opteron system

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.969 
now migrated from a rev e opteron system
to<00:01:45.459> the<00:01:45.939> upcoming<00:01:46.840> sixth<00:01:47.289> floor<00:01:47.469> and<00:01:47.739> the

to the upcoming sixth floor and the
offer<00:01:48.340> on<00:01:48.459> system<00:01:48.880> this<00:01:49.239> is<00:01:49.360> a<00:01:49.390> real<00:01:49.689> world

00:01:49.889 --> 00:01:49.899 
offer on system this is a real world

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:52.490 
offer on system this is a real world
example<00:01:50.079> of<00:01:50.649> where<00:01:50.890> we<00:01:51.009> took<00:01:51.250> a<00:01:51.489> rev<00:01:52.060> e

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
example of where we took a rev e

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.289 
example of where we took a rev e
processor<00:01:53.500> based<00:01:53.619> system<00:01:54.159> and<00:01:54.369> migrated<00:01:55.209> all

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:55.299 
processor based system and migrated all

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:57.300 
processor based system and migrated all
the<00:01:55.420> way<00:01:55.539> over<00:01:55.719> to<00:01:55.750> the<00:01:55.869> six<00:01:56.170> core<00:01:56.379> AMD<00:01:56.829> opteron

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
the way over to the six core AMD opteron

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.630 
the way over to the six core AMD opteron
system<00:01:57.759> so<00:01:58.270> similarly<00:01:59.140> we<00:02:00.069> can<00:02:00.219> take<00:02:00.399> it<00:02:00.520> from

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640 
system so similarly we can take it from

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.149 
system so similarly we can take it from
the<00:02:00.729> six<00:02:00.969> core<00:02:01.239> AMD<00:02:01.689> opteron<00:02:02.110> to<00:02:02.920> these

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:03.159 
the six core AMD opteron to these

the six core AMD opteron to these
opteron<00:02:05.579> 6010<00:02:06.579> timeframe<00:02:07.060> so<00:02:07.299> let's<00:02:07.599> go<00:02:07.719> ahead

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.259 
opteron 6010 timeframe so let's go ahead
and<00:02:07.899> do<00:02:08.019> that<00:02:08.049> migration<00:02:08.619> so<00:02:09.549> what<00:02:09.940> you<00:02:10.060> see<00:02:10.239> is

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:10.269 
and do that migration so what you see is

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:12.629 
and do that migration so what you see is
the<00:02:10.509> six<00:02:10.840> core<00:02:11.049> AMD<00:02:11.319> opteron<00:02:11.769> we're<00:02:12.459> going<00:02:12.579> to

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:12.639 
the six core AMD opteron we're going to

00:02:12.639 --> 00:02:14.520 
the six core AMD opteron we're going to
go<00:02:12.730> to<00:02:12.790> the<00:02:13.480> future<00:02:13.810> technology<00:02:14.319> of<00:02:14.410> the

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
go to the future technology of the

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.809 
go to the future technology of the
opteron<00:02:14.799> 6000<00:02:15.790> so

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:16.819 
opteron 6000 so

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:24.480 
opteron 6000 so
check<00:02:17.510> this<00:02:18.019> out

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:24.490 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:27.600 

so<00:02:25.030> once<00:02:25.210> again<00:02:25.330> live<00:02:26.170> migration<00:02:26.830> using

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
so once again live migration using

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:30.780 
so once again live migration using
vMotion<00:02:28.180> and<00:02:28.470> you<00:02:29.470> can<00:02:29.620> see<00:02:29.770> the<00:02:30.100> vmware<00:02:30.580> is

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
vMotion and you can see the vmware is

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.840 
vMotion and you can see the vmware is
moving<00:02:31.270> and<00:02:32.160> you'll<00:02:33.160> notice<00:02:33.250> the<00:02:33.580> video

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
moving and you'll notice the video

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:36.450 
moving and you'll notice the video
continues<00:02:34.270> to<00:02:34.630> move<00:02:34.780> be<00:02:35.410> a<00:02:35.440> very<00:02:35.920> slight

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:36.460 
continues to move be a very slight

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:39.120 
continues to move be a very slight
hesitation<00:02:36.700> boom<00:02:37.360> and<00:02:38.050> now<00:02:38.260> we've<00:02:38.650> migrated

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
hesitation boom and now we've migrated

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:43.070 
hesitation boom and now we've migrated
over<00:02:39.400> to<00:02:39.580> the<00:02:39.790> opteron<00:02:40.120> 6300

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.440 

so<00:02:43.680> the<00:02:43.860> net<00:02:44.010> effect<00:02:44.040> here<00:02:44.610> is<00:02:45.030> that<00:02:45.270> what

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
so the net effect here is that what

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.540 
so the net effect here is that what
we've<00:02:45.600> shown<00:02:45.750> you<00:02:45.810> today<00:02:46.050> is<00:02:46.290> that<00:02:46.550> multiple

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
we've shown you today is that multiple

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:48.800 
we've shown you today is that multiple
generations<00:02:47.730> starting<00:02:48.420> all<00:02:48.510> the<00:02:48.600> way<00:02:48.660> with

of utilizing vmware's vMotion to do live

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.720 
of utilizing vmware's vMotion to do live
migration<00:02:57.890> significant<00:02:58.890> because<00:02:59.040> businesses

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
migration significant because businesses

migration significant because businesses
that<00:02:59.940> are<00:03:00.090> currently<00:03:00.390> running<00:03:00.540> older<00:03:00.930> opteron

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
that are currently running older opteron

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.200 
that are currently running older opteron
systems<00:03:01.860> will<00:03:02.250> be<00:03:02.400> able<00:03:02.490> to<00:03:02.640> migrate<00:03:02.850> to<00:03:03.180> the

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:03.210 
systems will be able to migrate to the

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:05.060 
systems will be able to migrate to the
new<00:03:03.300> systems<00:03:03.870> without<00:03:03.990> any<00:03:04.290> problem<00:03:04.740> once
