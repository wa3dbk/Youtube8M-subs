fine but in terms of this game though I
don't<00:01:24.119> understand<00:01:24.479> why<00:01:24.689> it<00:01:25.170> has<00:01:25.350> to<00:01:25.590> be<00:01:25.820> so

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
don't understand why it has to be so

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.569 
don't understand why it has to be so
temperamental<00:01:28.200> and<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:28.950> issue<00:01:29.070> seems<00:01:29.400> to<00:01:29.520> be

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
temperamental and the issue seems to be

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.609 
temperamental and the issue seems to be
much<00:01:29.700> more<00:01:29.759> intense<00:01:30.270> on<00:01:30.479> custom<00:01:31.049> tracks<00:01:31.320> not

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
much more intense on custom tracks not

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.249 
much more intense on custom tracks not
so<00:01:31.920> much<00:01:32.130> tracks<00:01:33.119> that<00:01:33.390> are<00:01:33.450> that<00:01:33.930> came<00:01:34.110> with<00:01:34.200> a

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
so much tracks that are that came with a

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:35.719 
so much tracks that are that came with a
campaign<00:01:34.530> okay<00:01:34.890> cabins<00:01:35.340> there<00:01:35.490> occasionally

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
campaign okay cabins there occasionally

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.910 
campaign okay cabins there occasionally
as<00:01:36.000> well<00:01:36.119> but<00:01:36.329> it's<00:01:36.990> definitely<00:01:37.229> much<00:01:37.890> more

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
as well but it's definitely much more

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.399 
as well but it's definitely much more
prevalent<00:01:38.729> in<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.450> custom<00:01:39.930> tracks<00:01:40.170> and<00:01:40.350> it

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
prevalent in the custom tracks and it

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.340 
prevalent in the custom tracks and it
makes<00:01:40.619> it<00:01:40.770> so<00:01:41.130> fucking<00:01:41.610> hard<00:01:41.790> to<00:01:42.390> record<00:01:43.170> an

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
makes it so fucking hard to record an

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.830 
makes it so fucking hard to record an
episode<00:01:43.470> of<00:01:43.799> tats<00:01:44.189> when<00:01:44.820> I<00:01:44.850> have<00:01:45.060> to<00:01:45.210> deal<00:01:45.509> with

episode of tats when I have to deal with

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.620
