here one of the symptoms of the vehicle
sort<00:01:22.460> of<00:01:22.549> proving<00:01:23.360> that<00:01:23.420> it's<00:01:23.570> faulty<00:01:23.840> is<00:01:23.930> that

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:24.080 
sort of proving that it's faulty is that

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.039 
sort of proving that it's faulty is that
the<00:01:24.680> it<00:01:25.100> kind<00:01:25.640> of<00:01:25.820> goes<00:01:26.119> it<00:01:26.420> sort<00:01:26.659> of<00:01:26.689> jitters

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:27.049 
the it kind of goes it sort of jitters

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:28.630 
the it kind of goes it sort of jitters
when<00:01:27.080> you're<00:01:27.380> driving<00:01:27.799> and<00:01:28.009> it<00:01:28.280> goes<00:01:28.460> into

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
when you're driving and it goes into

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.070 
when you're driving and it goes into
limp<00:01:28.909> mode<00:01:29.030> which<00:01:29.240> basically<00:01:29.570> won't<00:01:29.869> allow<00:01:30.049> us

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:30.080 
limp mode which basically won't allow us

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.469 
limp mode which basically won't allow us
to<00:01:30.320> go<00:01:30.439> over<00:01:30.470> 30<00:01:30.890> miles<00:01:31.130> an<00:01:31.310> hour<00:01:31.430> -<00:01:32.030> also<00:01:32.149> known

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 
to go over 30 miles an hour - also known

to go over 30 miles an hour - also known
as<00:01:32.509> ghetto<00:01:32.899> mode<00:01:33.430> right<00:01:34.430> so<00:01:34.700> the<00:01:34.850> control<00:01:35.270> unit

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
as ghetto mode right so the control unit

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:36.999 
as ghetto mode right so the control unit
we're<00:01:35.780> going<00:01:35.930> to<00:01:35.990> have<00:01:36.110> a<00:01:36.140> look<00:01:36.289> at<00:01:36.409> the<00:01:36.530> engine

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:37.009 
we're going to have a look at the engine

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:38.679 
we're going to have a look at the engine
module<00:01:37.190> because<00:01:37.580> the<00:01:37.700> engine<00:01:38.000> management

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:38.689 
module because the engine management

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:44.560 
module because the engine management
light<00:01:38.990> is<00:01:39.140> showing<00:01:43.270> so<00:01:44.270> we're<00:01:44.390> going<00:01:44.509> to

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 
light is showing so we're going to

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:46.929 
light is showing so we're going to
diagnose<00:01:44.930> the<00:01:45.080> engine<00:01:45.409> ECU<00:01:45.530> it's<00:01:46.520> a<00:01:46.610> petrol

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:46.939 
diagnose the engine ECU it's a petrol

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:51.850 
diagnose the engine ECU it's a petrol

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
type stoke a to that I'm going to read

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.719 
type stoke a to that I'm going to read
the<00:01:57.500> chords

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:03.340 

and<00:02:02.270> it's<00:02:02.420> telling<00:02:02.750> us<00:02:02.869> that<00:02:02.930> we<00:02:03.170> have<00:02:03.320> a

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
and it's telling us that we have a

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:07.270 
and it's telling us that we have a
misfire<00:02:03.829> on<00:02:04.009> cylinder<00:02:04.460> one<00:02:04.930> and<00:02:05.930> the<00:02:06.890> cord<00:02:07.100> is

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
misfire on cylinder one and the cord is

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.150 
misfire on cylinder one and the cord is
one<00:02:07.820> three<00:02:08.360> three<00:02:08.390> seven<00:02:08.869> or<00:02:09.440> you<00:02:09.890> would<00:02:10.009> also

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
one three three seven or you would also

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.940 
one three three seven or you would also
put<00:02:10.640> a<00:02:10.700> P<00:02:10.910> in<00:02:10.940> front<00:02:11.239> of<00:02:11.360> that<00:02:11.450> to<00:02:11.629> make<00:02:11.810> it<00:02:11.959> p133

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
put a P in front of that to make it p133

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.240 
put a P in front of that to make it p133
seven<00:02:14.290> so<00:02:15.290> that's<00:02:15.470> what<00:02:15.620> we<00:02:15.709> need<00:02:15.830> to<00:02:15.920> look<00:02:16.069> at

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
seven so that's what we need to look at

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.089 
seven so that's what we need to look at
we<00:02:16.340> need<00:02:16.459> to<00:02:16.550> look<00:02:16.670> at<00:02:16.930> cylinder<00:02:17.930> 1<00:02:18.140> I<00:02:18.380> suspect

00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:19.099 
we need to look at cylinder 1 I suspect

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:23.440 
we need to look at cylinder 1 I suspect
it<00:02:19.310> is<00:02:19.489> a<00:02:20.140> faulty<00:02:21.140> coil<00:02:21.700> so<00:02:22.700> we<00:02:22.910> replace<00:02:23.269> the

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
it is a faulty coil so we replace the

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.539 
it is a faulty coil so we replace the
coil<00:02:23.660> on<00:02:23.810> cylinder<00:02:24.200> 1<00:02:24.500> and<00:02:25.090> then<00:02:26.440> come<00:02:27.440> back

00:02:27.539 --> 00:02:27.549 
coil on cylinder 1 and then come back

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:31.089 
coil on cylinder 1 and then come back
reset<00:02:28.549> the<00:02:28.640> code<00:02:28.880> and<00:02:29.780> then<00:02:29.930> hopefully<00:02:30.140> the

00:02:31.089 --> 00:02:31.099 
reset the code and then hopefully the

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:32.500 
reset the code and then hopefully the
engine<00:02:31.370> management<00:02:31.610> light<00:02:31.910> and<00:02:32.180> the<00:02:32.360> deep

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
engine management light and the deep

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.020 
engine management light and the deep
ocean<00:02:32.840> system<00:02:33.170> faulty<00:02:33.560> error<00:02:34.040> should<00:02:34.610> be

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
ocean system faulty error should be

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:36.339 
ocean system faulty error should be
removed<00:02:35.390> from<00:02:35.569> the<00:02:35.810> vehicle

00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:36.349 
removed from the vehicle

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:39.970 
removed from the vehicle
so<00:02:37.250> we've<00:02:37.370> sourced<00:02:37.670> the<00:02:37.730> pot<00:02:38.590> this<00:02:39.590> is<00:02:39.739> the

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
so we've sourced the pot this is the

Bosch part number we always advise you
to<00:02:42.590> go<00:02:42.709> for<00:02:42.920> the<00:02:42.980> Bosch<00:02:43.160> part<00:02:43.459> number<00:02:43.790> and<00:02:44.170> this

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
to go for the Bosch part number and this

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.819 
to go for the Bosch part number and this
is<00:02:45.349> the<00:02:45.530> coil<00:02:45.769> itself<00:02:47.470> and<00:02:48.470> we're<00:02:48.650> going<00:02:48.769> to

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:48.829 
is the coil itself and we're going to

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:52.030 
is the coil itself and we're going to
remove<00:02:49.069> the<00:02:49.340> engine<00:02:49.940> cover<00:02:50.380> which<00:02:51.380> will<00:02:51.620> allow

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
remove the engine cover which will allow

00:02:52.040 --> 00:05:00.640 
remove the engine cover which will allow
us<00:02:52.220> to<00:02:52.400> remove<00:02:52.670> car<00:02:52.940> number<00:02:53.239> 1

here so we're back in the vehicle now
we've<00:05:03.449> changed<00:05:03.479> the<00:05:03.990> coil<00:05:04.259> on<00:05:04.529> cylinder<00:05:05.039> 1<00:05:06.319> and

00:05:07.309 --> 00:05:07.319 
we've changed the coil on cylinder 1 and

00:05:07.319 --> 00:05:08.149 
we've changed the coil on cylinder 1 and
what<00:05:07.439> we're<00:05:07.529> going<00:05:07.650> to<00:05:07.680> do<00:05:07.770> is<00:05:07.889> we're<00:05:08.009> going<00:05:08.099> to

what we're going to do is we're going to

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:10.610 
what we're going to do is we're going to
go<00:05:08.279> back<00:05:08.490> in<00:05:08.960> let's<00:05:09.960> see<00:05:10.139> if<00:05:10.199> we<00:05:10.349> can<00:05:10.469> actually

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:10.620 
go back in let's see if we can actually

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:15.290 
go back in let's see if we can actually
erase<00:05:11.550> the<00:05:11.789> trouble<00:05:12.120> code<00:05:12.330> and<00:05:13.939> then<00:05:14.939> start

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:15.300 
erase the trouble code and then start

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:17.600 
erase the trouble code and then start
the<00:05:15.419> engine<00:05:15.749> to<00:05:15.900> see<00:05:16.080> if<00:05:16.319> the<00:05:16.620> engine

just put the engine cover back on and

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:45.050 
just put the engine cover back on and
