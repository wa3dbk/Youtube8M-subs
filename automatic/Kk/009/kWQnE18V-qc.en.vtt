 I'm looking down all the way, so I'm always in the back of a cat, so I'm always going to boso boso so I'm on base 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:37.470
 Although I recently learned that I have not been there, after that I was the director of the theater club 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:38.790
 He and voice I had thought that all right for a small but go to see the trend in the help of illumination 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:44.630
 It was totally different 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:50.090
 My spine was stretched and I was able to clearly see the face clearly in addition to Haki Hiki and I was jealous 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:53.960
 In a nutshell, it's a waste of money to get rid of anyone who did 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:59.140
 Surprise is because consider these to smell people for the first time in non-cartoon world 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:59.140
 Everyone in the House of Representatives is surprised at the gap and is now popular 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:09.679
 No, but there are a lot of people like that, but when you play that play, you can say that everyone is that character 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:16.730
 It is true that it means that it will be that personality 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:17.960
 It is probably suitable for actors, I guess I'm sure you're an entertainer and I usually have a cat off

 day 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:24.080
 Also to attack but it is often those who say incredibly switch enter when you are turning the camera in your work 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:28.250
 so 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:33.410
 Well it's really an actor type 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:36.780
 In what now something I wonder if I'm in this kind of gap there are things that come with the softening Kyun Speaking 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:40.290
 I wonder if the story I Is there I is a popular person is 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:44.910
