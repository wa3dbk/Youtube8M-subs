00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
say this too often but I completely

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:16.480 
say this too often but I completely
agree<00:03:04.860> with<00:03:05.040> you<00:03:08.390> and<00:03:09.390> it's<00:03:09.810> been<00:03:10.019> reversed

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:16.490 

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:18.550 

I<00:03:16.580> don't<00:03:17.330> think<00:03:17.360> that<00:03:17.630> these<00:03:17.750> superstars<00:03:18.380> have

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
I don't think that these superstars have

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.170 
I don't think that these superstars have
even<00:03:18.830> contemplated<00:03:19.610> the<00:03:19.700> fact<00:03:19.910> that<00:03:20.000> they

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
even contemplated the fact that they

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.290 
even contemplated the fact that they
might<00:03:20.330> lose<00:03:20.570> I'm<00:03:21.320> sure<00:03:21.650> they<00:03:21.890> have<00:03:22.130> that's<00:03:23.090> not

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:23.300 
might lose I'm sure they have that's not

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:25.330 
might lose I'm sure they have that's not
the<00:03:23.420> kind<00:03:23.600> of<00:03:23.750> attitude<00:03:23.930> you<00:03:24.800> come<00:03:25.070> in<00:03:25.310> with

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
the kind of attitude you come in with

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.600 
the kind of attitude you come in with
and<00:03:25.790> expect<00:03:26.510> to<00:03:26.720> pick<00:03:27.020> up<00:03:27.200> the<00:03:27.380> win<00:03:27.620> right

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:28.610 
and expect to pick up the win right

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:30.520 
and expect to pick up the win right
about<00:03:28.790> that<00:03:28.970> jr.<00:03:29.390> if<00:03:29.870> you<00:03:30.020> can't<00:03:30.230> see<00:03:30.410> yourself

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
about that jr. if you can't see yourself

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:32.140 
about that jr. if you can't see yourself
having<00:03:30.800> your<00:03:31.070> arm<00:03:31.280> raised<00:03:31.520> by<00:03:31.700> the<00:03:31.760> referee

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
having your arm raised by the referee

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:40.260 
having your arm raised by the referee
when<00:03:32.300> it's<00:03:32.450> over<00:03:32.690> don't<00:03:33.230> bother<00:03:33.440> showing<00:03:33.830> up

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:40.270 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:42.030 

I<00:03:40.330> think<00:03:41.080> these<00:03:41.200> superstars<00:03:41.800> have<00:03:41.980> a

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
I think these superstars have a

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:43.680 
I think these superstars have a
legitimate<00:03:42.430> beef<00:03:42.730> with<00:03:42.970> each<00:03:43.060> other<00:03:43.300> junior

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:43.690 
legitimate beef with each other junior

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:47.220 
legitimate beef with each other junior
so<00:03:44.590> do<00:03:44.860> I<00:03:44.890> pee<00:03:45.100> I'm<00:03:45.970> not<00:03:46.180> so<00:03:46.420> sure<00:03:46.450> their<00:03:46.840> issues

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 
so do I pee I'm not so sure their issues

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:49.410 
so do I pee I'm not so sure their issues
with<00:03:47.380> each<00:03:47.500> other<00:03:47.740> are<00:03:47.980> going<00:03:48.490> to<00:03:48.640> be<00:03:48.790> solved

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:49.420 
with each other are going to be solved

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:52.710 
with each other are going to be solved
with<00:03:49.810> one<00:03:50.080> man<00:03:50.290> I<00:03:50.710> hope<00:03:51.400> not<00:03:51.430> i'd<00:03:52.240> love<00:03:52.450> to<00:03:52.570> see

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
with one man I hope not i'd love to see

00:03:52.720 --> 00:04:01.020 
with one man I hope not i'd love to see
them<00:03:52.810> go<00:03:52.930> at<00:03:53.050> it<00:03:53.080> again<00:03:53.290> and<00:03:53.710> again<00:03:53.800> i<00:04:00.030> think

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030 
them go at it again and again i think

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:02.430 
them go at it again and again i think
we're<00:04:01.150> going<00:04:01.180> to<00:04:01.330> find<00:04:01.390> out<00:04:01.660> just<00:04:01.900> how<00:04:02.230> much

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:02.440 
we're going to find out just how much

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.800 
we're going to find out just how much
punishment<00:04:02.770> that<00:04:03.370> human<00:04:03.790> body<00:04:04.030> can<00:04:04.330> there's

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:04.810 
punishment that human body can there's

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:07.350 
punishment that human body can there's
no<00:04:05.140> room<00:04:05.440> for<00:04:05.770> error<00:04:06.070> when<00:04:06.730> you're<00:04:06.880> on<00:04:06.970> the<00:04:07.000> top

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:07.360 
no room for error when you're on the top

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:15.510 
no room for error when you're on the top
rope<00:04:13.260> i'm<00:04:14.260> not<00:04:14.500> so<00:04:14.680> sure<00:04:14.710> this<00:04:15.100> was<00:04:15.280> about

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:15.520 
rope i'm not so sure this was about

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:17.670 
rope i'm not so sure this was about
winning<00:04:15.790> or<00:04:15.970> losing<00:04:16.209> anymore<00:04:16.630> I<00:04:17.110> think<00:04:17.590> it's

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:17.680 
winning or losing anymore I think it's

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:20.430 
winning or losing anymore I think it's
become<00:04:18.010> more<00:04:18.190> personal<00:04:19.030> than<00:04:19.060> that<00:04:19.239> of<00:04:20.170> course

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:20.440 
become more personal than that of course

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.010 
become more personal than that of course
it's<00:04:20.739> personal<00:04:20.950> jr.<00:04:21.580> any<00:04:22.300> time<00:04:22.540> you<00:04:22.690> step<00:04:22.900> into

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.020

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:24.390 
it's personal jr. any time you step into
