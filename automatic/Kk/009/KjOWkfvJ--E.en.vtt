bouncing so what's happening is waters
falling<00:00:24.840> on<00:00:25.110> the<00:00:25.200> tears<00:00:25.670> coming<00:00:26.670> down

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:29.900 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.280 

and<00:00:30.050> it's<00:00:30.290> a<00:00:30.620> misnomer<00:00:31.040> here

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:32.290 
and it's a misnomer here

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:35.250 
and it's a misnomer here
look<00:00:32.830> like<00:00:33.070> a<00:00:33.160> bowl<00:00:33.510> to<00:00:34.510> pitch<00:00:34.720> any<00:00:34.870> water<00:00:35.170> that

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:35.260 
look like a bowl to pitch any water that

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.200 
look like a bowl to pitch any water that
Skinnygirl<00:00:35.830> eyes<00:00:35.950> flashing<00:00:36.370> out<00:00:36.670> on<00:00:36.940> the<00:00:37.090> way

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.210 
Skinnygirl eyes flashing out on the way

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:38.940 
Skinnygirl eyes flashing out on the way
down<00:00:37.450> so<00:00:37.750> it<00:00:37.870> directs<00:00:38.200> all<00:00:38.320> the<00:00:38.470> water<00:00:38.650> into

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:38.950 
down so it directs all the water into

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:41.130 
down so it directs all the water into
this<00:00:39.070> chamber<00:00:39.550> this<00:00:40.360> is<00:00:40.420> actually<00:00:40.870> called<00:00:40.990> a

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:41.140 
this chamber this is actually called a

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:42.360 
this chamber this is actually called a
first<00:00:41.350> rain<00:00:41.590> separator

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:42.370 
first rain separator

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:44.280 
first rain separator
there's<00:00:42.790> two<00:00:42.970> chambers<00:00:43.420> here<00:00:43.600> you<00:00:43.720> can't<00:00:43.990> see

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:44.290 
there's two chambers here you can't see

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:45.990 
there's two chambers here you can't see
it<00:00:44.410> so<00:00:44.890> what's<00:00:45.070> happening<00:00:45.460> right<00:00:45.640> here<00:00:45.700> is

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:46.000 
it so what's happening right here is

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.490 
it so what's happening right here is
there's<00:00:46.150> a<00:00:46.270> baffle<00:00:46.690> wall<00:00:46.780> that's<00:00:47.020> coming<00:00:47.410> up

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:47.500 
there's a baffle wall that's coming up

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.140 
there's a baffle wall that's coming up
till<00:00:47.770> about<00:00:47.890> a<00:00:48.010> few<00:00:48.370> inches<00:00:48.520> from<00:00:48.700> the<00:00:48.970> top

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:49.150 
till about a few inches from the top

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:51.930 
till about a few inches from the top
there<00:00:49.420> and<00:00:49.810> all<00:00:50.500> the<00:00:50.710> first<00:00:50.980> rain<00:00:51.310> what<00:00:51.610> we<00:00:51.700> try

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:51.940 
there and all the first rain what we try

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:53.910 
there and all the first rain what we try
to<00:00:52.000> do<00:00:52.210> is<00:00:52.390> not<00:00:52.780> collect<00:00:53.140> the<00:00:53.290> first<00:00:53.530> one

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:53.920 
to do is not collect the first one

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.440 
to do is not collect the first one
millimeter<00:00:54.400> of<00:00:54.580> rain<00:00:54.790> that<00:00:54.970> falls<00:00:55.180> on<00:00:55.420> the

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:55.450 
millimeter of rain that falls on the

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:58.049 
millimeter of rain that falls on the
terrace<00:00:55.780> at<00:00:56.470> first<00:00:56.739> mm<00:00:57.130> is<00:00:57.370> reflected<00:00:57.820> in<00:00:57.940> this

00:00:58.049 --> 00:00:58.059 
terrace at first mm is reflected in this

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:00.479 
terrace at first mm is reflected in this
first<00:00:58.330> chamber<00:00:58.600> and<00:00:59.320> then<00:00:59.590> only<00:00:59.800> once<00:01:00.220> that

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:00.489 
first chamber and then only once that

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:02.490 
first chamber and then only once that
fills<00:01:00.820> up<00:01:00.970> the<00:01:01.120> capacity<00:01:01.660> of<00:01:01.840> the<00:01:02.020> additional

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:02.500 
fills up the capacity of the additional

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.410 
fills up the capacity of the additional
water<00:01:02.620> go<00:01:02.890> into<00:01:03.130> this<00:01:03.280> chamber<00:01:03.580> which<00:01:04.239> is<00:01:04.270> the

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:04.420 
water go into this chamber which is the

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.780 
water go into this chamber which is the
filter<00:01:05.100> what's<00:01:06.100> happening<00:01:06.520> is<00:01:06.610> there's

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:06.790 
filter what's happening is there's

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:08.850 
filter what's happening is there's
actually<00:01:07.000> a<00:01:07.270> horizontal<00:01:08.229> pipe<00:01:08.380> going<00:01:08.650> in

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:08.860 
actually a horizontal pipe going in

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.070 
actually a horizontal pipe going in
there<00:01:09.040> with<00:01:09.550> the<00:01:09.759> small<00:01:10.210> about<00:01:10.540> quarter<00:01:10.900> inch

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:11.080 
there with the small about quarter inch

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.230 
there with the small about quarter inch
holes<00:01:11.380> drilled<00:01:11.740> into<00:01:11.950> it<00:01:12.100> it's<00:01:12.970> wrapped

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:13.240 
holes drilled into it it's wrapped

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:14.820 
holes drilled into it it's wrapped
around<00:01:13.360> with<00:01:13.720> met<00:01:13.930> lawn<00:01:14.140> mesh<00:01:14.410> which<00:01:14.650> is<00:01:14.680> a

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:14.830 
around with met lawn mesh which is a

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:17.249 
around with met lawn mesh which is a
mosquito<00:01:15.369> mesh<00:01:15.550> and<00:01:16.300> then<00:01:16.420> on<00:01:16.509> top<00:01:16.720> of<00:01:16.780> that<00:01:17.050> we

00:01:17.249 --> 00:01:17.259 
mosquito mesh and then on top of that we

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:20.580 
mosquito mesh and then on top of that we
have<00:01:17.410> layers<00:01:17.680> of<00:01:17.800> sand<00:01:18.310> and<00:01:18.580> gravel<00:01:19.470> so<00:01:20.470> the

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 
have layers of sand and gravel so the

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.440 
have layers of sand and gravel so the
water<00:01:20.800> passes<00:01:21.340> through<00:01:21.369> that<00:01:21.729> it<00:01:21.970> removes<00:01:22.240> any

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:22.450 
water passes through that it removes any

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:23.969 
water passes through that it removes any
suspended<00:01:23.140> solids<00:01:23.530> that<00:01:23.650> are<00:01:23.800> still

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:23.979 
suspended solids that are still

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:25.920 
suspended solids that are still
remaining<00:01:24.220> in<00:01:24.430> the<00:01:24.550> water<00:01:24.759> and<00:01:25.210> after<00:01:25.690> that<00:01:25.780> it

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:25.930 
remaining in the water and after that it

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:48.130 
remaining in the water and after that it
goes<00:01:26.020> straight<00:01:26.080> down<00:01:26.590> into<00:01:26.800> this<00:01:26.979> pipe

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.200 

okay<00:01:48.830> so<00:01:48.890> as<00:01:49.130> you<00:01:49.160> can<00:01:49.310> see<00:01:49.370> what's<00:01:49.700> happening

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 
okay so as you can see what's happening

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.170 
okay so as you can see what's happening
is<00:01:50.450> we<00:01:51.140> have<00:01:51.320> about<00:01:51.490> about<00:01:52.490> three<00:01:52.790> three<00:01:53.150> a

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:53.180 
is we have about about three three a

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.150 
is we have about about three three a
pitch<00:01:53.420> pipe<00:01:53.750> coming<00:01:54.560> in<00:01:54.770> so<00:01:54.890> there's

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:55.160 
pitch pipe coming in so there's

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.760 
pitch pipe coming in so there's
something<00:01:55.630> and<00:01:56.630> then<00:01:56.840> you<00:01:57.170> see<00:01:57.350> that<00:01:57.560> there's

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
something and then you see that there's

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.910 
something and then you see that there's
rainwater<00:01:58.220> coming<00:01:58.430> into<00:01:58.700> it<00:01:58.940> right<00:01:59.090> now<00:01:59.920> and

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:00.920 
rainwater coming into it right now and

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:10.340 
rainwater coming into it right now and
I'll<00:02:01.250> just<00:02:02.350> sort<00:02:03.350> it's<00:02:03.530> quite<00:02:03.800> clear

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.350 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:18.840 

you

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:20.910 

you
