that so let's get started so let's

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.279 
that so let's get started so let's
create<00:00:13.500> a<00:00:13.620> new<00:00:13.650> composition<00:00:14.900> let's<00:00:15.900> call<00:00:16.139> this

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
create a new composition let's call this

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:22.250 
create a new composition let's call this
our<00:00:16.529> main<00:00:16.949> home<00:00:18.680> and<00:00:19.760> let's<00:00:20.760> make<00:00:20.880> it<00:00:21.029> 1920<00:00:21.990> by

seconds<00:00:26.609> it's<00:00:26.789> fine<00:00:27.080> so<00:00:28.080> let's<00:00:28.260> just<00:00:28.590> create<00:00:28.859> a

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
seconds it's fine so let's just create a

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.920 
seconds it's fine so let's just create a
new<00:00:29.189> text<00:00:29.730> so<00:00:30.380> we<00:00:31.380> were<00:00:31.439> just<00:00:31.590> gonna<00:00:31.769> call<00:00:32.009> this

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:32.930 
new text so we were just gonna call this

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:39.260 
new text so we were just gonna call this
my<00:00:35.360> or<00:00:36.360> let's<00:00:36.660> just<00:00:36.809> got<00:00:37.020> a<00:00:37.050> tutorial<00:00:38.210> there<00:00:39.210> we

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
properly by the align panel you can get

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.920 
properly by the align panel you can get
that<00:00:46.320> and<00:00:46.590> going<00:00:46.739> to<00:00:46.920> window<00:00:47.370> and<00:00:47.780> click<00:00:48.780> the

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
align one and let's make sure that our

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.020 
align one and let's make sure that our
fun<00:00:53.039> as<00:00:53.280> well<00:00:53.489> our<00:00:53.969> size<00:00:54.420> as<00:00:54.690> well<00:00:54.899> and

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
everything here is just perfect because

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.160 
everything here is just perfect because
we're<00:00:59.280> going<00:00:59.430> to<00:00:59.520> change<00:00:59.879> this<00:01:00.420> into<00:01:00.600> shapes

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
we're going to change this into shapes

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.160 
we're going to change this into shapes
and<00:01:01.820> add<00:01:02.820> some<00:01:03.120> effects<00:01:03.390> to<00:01:03.510> it<00:01:03.690> so<00:01:03.899> let's<00:01:03.930> just

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
and add some effects to it so let's just

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.700 
and add some effects to it so let's just
right<00:01:04.439> click<00:01:04.739> this<00:01:04.949> and<00:01:05.750> create<00:01:06.750> shapes<00:01:07.320> from

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
right click this and create shapes from

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.179 
right click this and create shapes from
text<00:01:08.520> so<00:01:08.880> let's<00:01:09.210> call<00:01:09.600> that<00:01:09.659> so<00:01:10.020> now<00:01:10.890> we<00:01:10.950> get<00:01:11.159> I

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
text so let's call that so now we get I

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:16.840 
text so let's call that so now we get I
knew<00:01:12.049> a<00:01:13.049> new<00:01:13.799> file<00:01:14.130> pretty<00:01:15.030> much<00:01:15.240> and<00:01:15.570> that<00:01:16.500> is

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850 
knew a new file pretty much and that is

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.270 
knew a new file pretty much and that is
all<00:01:17.850> our<00:01:18.240> letters<00:01:18.590> so<00:01:19.590> if<00:01:19.710> you<00:01:19.830> go<00:01:19.950> into<00:01:20.159> the

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
all our letters so if you go into the

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.510 
all our letters so if you go into the
contents<00:01:20.820> you<00:01:20.939> can<00:01:21.060> see<00:01:21.240> all<00:01:21.420> letters<00:01:21.960> in<00:01:22.520> a

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
contents you can see all letters in a

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.789 
contents you can see all letters in a
shape<00:01:23.909> so<00:01:24.659> what<00:01:24.869> we<00:01:24.960> can<00:01:25.110> do<00:01:25.259> now<00:01:25.439> is<00:01:25.619> just

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
shape so what we can do now is just

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.780 
shape so what we can do now is just
select<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.790> layer<00:01:27.030> go<00:01:27.299> to<00:01:27.450> add<00:01:27.869> and<00:01:28.640> let's<00:01:29.640> say

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
select the layer go to add and let's say

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.410 
select the layer go to add and let's say
eyelet<00:01:30.270> trim<00:01:30.540> pass<00:01:30.840> and<00:01:31.729> as<00:01:32.729> you<00:01:32.850> can<00:01:33.000> see<00:01:33.270> you

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
eyelet trim pass and as you can see you

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.950 
eyelet trim pass and as you can see you
can<00:01:33.570> have<00:01:33.689> this<00:01:33.869> weird<00:01:34.200> reveal<00:01:35.659> have<00:01:36.659> it<00:01:36.780> come

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
can have this weird reveal have it come

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:37.310 
can have this weird reveal have it come
on

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
on

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.889 
on
this<00:01:37.890> way<00:01:38.189> it's<00:01:38.670> just<00:01:38.790> pretty<00:01:39.180> cool<00:01:41.810> and<00:01:42.810> you

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
this way it's just pretty cool and you

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.139 
this way it's just pretty cool and you
can<00:01:42.930> just<00:01:43.259> add<00:01:43.409> a<00:01:43.799> couple<00:01:44.250> of<00:01:44.399> these<00:01:44.640> effects

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
can just add a couple of these effects

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.539 
can just add a couple of these effects
as<00:01:45.420> well<00:01:45.659> so<00:01:45.960> let's<00:01:46.110> just<00:01:46.259> add<00:01:46.439> let's<00:01:47.070> say<00:01:47.220> a

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
as well so let's just add let's say a

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:52.490 
as well so let's just add let's say a
wiggle<00:01:47.939> path<00:01:48.920> and<00:01:50.869> you<00:01:51.869> can<00:01:51.990> see<00:01:52.170> this<00:01:52.320> is<00:01:52.470> a

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
wiggle path and you can see this is a

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.539 
wiggle path and you can see this is a
weird<00:01:52.740> effect<00:01:53.159> from<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:54.799> part<00:01:55.799> I<00:01:55.920> gave<00:01:56.159> so<00:01:56.490> you

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
weird effect from the part I gave so you

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.420 
weird effect from the part I gave so you
can<00:01:56.820> you<00:01:57.060> could<00:01:57.180> kind<00:01:57.420> of<00:01:57.479> make<00:01:57.659> a<00:01:57.689> weird<00:01:58.430> with

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
can you could kind of make a weird with

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.520 
can you could kind of make a weird with
looking<00:01:59.759> animation<00:02:00.420> right<00:02:00.659> here<00:02:00.960> you<00:02:01.170> can<00:02:01.320> add

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
looking animation right here you can add

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.359 
looking animation right here you can add
something<00:02:02.490> more<00:02:03.079> you<00:02:04.079> can<00:02:04.110> add<00:02:04.409> a<00:02:04.920> round

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
something more you can add a round

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:09.830 
something more you can add a round
corners<00:02:05.909> and<00:02:06.479> make<00:02:06.960> this<00:02:07.140> look<00:02:07.380> round<00:02:08.840> and

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
corners and make this look round and

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:10.870 
corners and make this look round and
yeah

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:10.880 
yeah

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.340 
yeah
I<00:02:11.800> you<00:02:12.800> know<00:02:12.920> you<00:02:12.980> can<00:02:13.220> use<00:02:13.580> this<00:02:13.910> for<00:02:14.390> kind<00:02:15.230> of

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
I you know you can use this for kind of

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:17.770 
I you know you can use this for kind of
making<00:02:16.040> your<00:02:16.310> text<00:02:16.700> more<00:02:16.850> interesting<00:02:17.570> I

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
making your text more interesting I

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.000 
making your text more interesting I
guess<00:02:18.290> you<00:02:19.280> can<00:02:19.460> use<00:02:19.820> a<00:02:19.850> pucker<00:02:20.180> and<00:02:20.390> boat<00:02:21.010> you

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
guess you can use a pucker and boat you

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:23.410 
guess you can use a pucker and boat you
could<00:02:22.100> just<00:02:22.310> pretty<00:02:22.550> much<00:02:22.700> use<00:02:22.940> all<00:02:23.120> of<00:02:23.270> those

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
could just pretty much use all of those

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:29.230
