I said invite her over to your table but

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:39.430 
I said invite her over to your table but
she's<00:02:38.120> reading<00:02:38.390> her<00:02:38.600> book<00:02:38.810> I<00:02:38.989> don't<00:02:39.170> care<00:02:39.290> what

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
she's reading her book I don't care what

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:40.750 
she's reading her book I don't care what
she's<00:02:39.620> reading<00:02:39.800> she'd<00:02:40.040> probably<00:02:40.220> rather<00:02:40.340> sit

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
she's reading she'd probably rather sit

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.460 
she's reading she'd probably rather sit
with<00:02:40.910> a<00:02:40.940> bunch<00:02:41.209> of<00:02:41.300> people<00:02:41.690> invite<00:02:42.260> her<00:02:42.440> over

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
with a bunch of people invite her over

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.770 
with a bunch of people invite her over
so<00:02:43.130> really<00:02:43.340> it's<00:02:43.610> about<00:02:43.760> picking<00:02:44.420> up<00:02:44.570> those

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
so really it's about picking up those

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:46.060 
so really it's about picking up those
people<00:02:45.230> who<00:02:45.380> are<00:02:45.470> falling<00:02:45.860> through<00:02:45.890> the

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.070 
people who are falling through the

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:48.160 
people who are falling through the
cracks<00:02:46.160> to<00:02:46.640> and<00:02:46.850> and<00:02:47.150> I<00:02:47.270> think<00:02:47.300> the<00:02:47.810> longer

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
cracks to and and I think the longer

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:50.320 
cracks to and and I think the longer
they<00:02:48.440> stay<00:02:48.500> isolated<00:02:48.920> the<00:02:49.610> more<00:02:49.820> they<00:02:50.060> feel

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
they stay isolated the more they feel

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:51.610 
they stay isolated the more they feel
that<00:02:50.570> there's<00:02:50.750> something<00:02:50.959> wrong<00:02:51.200> with<00:02:51.440> them

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
that there's something wrong with them

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.920 
that there's something wrong with them
and<00:02:52.070> so<00:02:52.430> again<00:02:52.670> for<00:02:52.850> your<00:02:53.209> daughter<00:02:53.269> just<00:02:53.570> go
