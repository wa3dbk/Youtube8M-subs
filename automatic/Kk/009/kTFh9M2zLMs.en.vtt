 loop slips and delays 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:46.770
 loop must be wound so that it 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:50.850
 hopped over for that abalone tooling will have 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:55.070
 hold on tight and not walk with 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:59.580

 carabiners 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:21.020
 it is easy to take it easy to change to 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:21.020
 The main thread is the carbine ear and

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:37.430
 to tie 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:43.610
 such a carabiner with you right now knit 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:48.350
 loop here it fit in 2 passes 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:52.970
 first passes and 2 are required 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:57.640
 wet the knots so they do not heat up 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:03:02.260
 let it be tightly tied loop 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:08.980
 Now I will show how to make the installation 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:14.950

 rubber cone dress on our little nut 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:27.910
 snap ready here chains we cling 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:35.020
 main line 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:39.350
 so here it looks as an assembly on the hooks 

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:42.430
 hang polystyrene so the hooks go up 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:42.430
