up and make it look thinner I think when

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.900 
up and make it look thinner I think when
the<00:01:27.289> hair<00:01:27.470> got<00:01:27.590> really<00:01:27.860> thin<00:01:28.100> it<00:01:28.340> just<00:01:28.520> made<00:01:28.729> me

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:28.910 
the hair got really thin it just made me

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:33.160 
the hair got really thin it just made me
feel<00:01:29.360> as<00:01:29.840> if<00:01:29.929> my<00:01:30.670> normal<00:01:31.670> look<00:01:32.000> had<00:01:32.360> gone<00:01:32.990> away

a member of the international alliance

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:45.649 
a member of the international alliance
of<00:02:44.129> hair<00:02:44.340> restoration<00:02:44.489> surgeons<00:02:45.390> and<00:02:45.569> that

00:02:45.649 --> 00:02:45.659 
of hair restoration surgeons and that

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:49.459 
of hair restoration surgeons and that
was<00:02:45.810> very<00:02:45.840> very<00:02:46.439> important<00:02:47.159> to<00:02:47.219> me<00:02:48.469> everyone

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:49.469 
was very very important to me everyone

00:02:49.469 --> 00:02:51.649 
was very very important to me everyone
doesn't<00:02:49.650> look<00:02:50.010> good<00:02:50.489> with<00:02:50.700> the<00:02:50.819> same<00:02:51.120> hairline

00:02:51.649 --> 00:02:51.659 
doesn't look good with the same hairline

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:53.240 
doesn't look good with the same hairline
and<00:02:51.959> so<00:02:52.349> I<00:02:52.379> think<00:02:52.439> you<00:02:52.739> really<00:02:52.980> have<00:02:53.099> to<00:02:53.219> have

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
and so I think you really have to have

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.030 
and so I think you really have to have
an<00:02:53.430> artistic<00:02:53.909> eye<00:02:54.060> to<00:02:54.120> see<00:02:54.689> what<00:02:55.590> hairline<00:02:56.010> is

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
an artistic eye to see what hairline is

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.819 
an artistic eye to see what hairline is
going<00:02:56.459> to<00:02:56.549> look<00:02:56.730> good<00:02:56.970> and<00:02:57.239> the<00:02:58.140> placement<00:02:58.769> of

00:02:58.819 --> 00:02:58.829 
going to look good and the placement of

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:01.670 
going to look good and the placement of
the<00:02:58.950> hairs<00:02:59.189> and<00:03:00.150> specific<00:03:01.049> angles<00:03:01.470> and

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
the hairs and specific angles and

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.559 
the hairs and specific angles and
directions<00:03:02.159> that's<00:03:02.459> very<00:03:02.700> important<00:03:03.209> as<00:03:03.389> well

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:03.569 
directions that's very important as well

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:08.030 
directions that's very important as well
after<00:03:04.470> having<00:03:05.299> both<00:03:06.299> the<00:03:06.629> fuss<00:03:07.139> and<00:03:07.469> the<00:03:07.769> fue

going<00:03:14.250> to<00:03:14.400> do<00:03:14.519> it<00:03:14.639> because<00:03:14.819> it<00:03:14.879> was<00:03:15.139> much

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:16.139
