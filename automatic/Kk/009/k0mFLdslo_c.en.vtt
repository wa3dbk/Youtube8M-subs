00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:11.300
 Talk guys are rowing back with 

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:14.810
 You and I took an airplane in 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:17.450
 airport and from this airport at 

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:19.280
 land is difficult to fly the plane is not 

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:21.850
 It's easy to know how to land. 

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:26.090
 It's quite complicated here, so worse. 

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:30.020
 bigger boeing is not talked about nor time we 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:35.030
 so it's not very difficult to get well 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:40.149
 here so you can see in several 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:42.680
 cameras is the franklin inside the plane 

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:43.880
 taking franklin wave and frank is not the 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.820
 best airplane pilot 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:50.079
 everyone knows that you are caught 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.079
 front of airplane beak 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:53.260
 come on 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:01:00.070
 It's fine because you have to tighten the crucible. 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.070
 accelerator and turn the r1 together 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.710
 It would be good if it were a good thing to pull the 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.710
 whimsical car 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.790
 lifting a large pole 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:26.250
 to close the same congratulations on rockstar 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:33.020
 because even to fly the lyon is not 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:38.000
 easy and is very detail - body moves O 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:38.000
 He has to control him well. 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:47.040
 I'll try to make it back in the middle. 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.040
 then pose again 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.140
 there is another airport there are two 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.859
 airports in the same direction same 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.859
 three airports 

00:01:57.859 --> 00:02:00.859
 airports 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.130
 I know in Los Angeles airport 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.740
 make a thousand forced turn 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.140
 I'll go over these airports 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.650
 very cool same look is 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:44.650
 impressive 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.240
 I'll try to land in the same place. 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.100
 It is not easy as when it gets 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.140
 get on the landing gear 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:17.530
 speed up the acceleration of several 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.530
 processes 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.340
 there 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.200
 the pa 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:47.380
 saw how difficult it is 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:13.740
 funk is not a good pilot 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:28.780
 I hope it's taxed the name attack 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:32.850
 There are no other millions around here. 

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:43.610
 passionate bozzini attacks will not have a 

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:48.400
 travel mission that will have an airplane 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:48.400
 here but it is not the case or it is not 

00:04:48.439 --> 00:04:51.250
 So 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:00.430
 so guys this is a sample video 

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:03.190
 The plane that I made is what you 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:05.320
 Taking off and landing, I hope 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:09.930
 You like this short video. 

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:09.930
