just see the crates really going to be
moved<00:00:44.990> so<00:00:45.530> we<00:00:45.680> wanted<00:00:45.980> to<00:00:46.040> minimize<00:00:46.640> the<00:00:46.850> level

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.210 
moved so we wanted to minimize the level

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:48.730 
moved so we wanted to minimize the level
of<00:00:47.300> a<00:00:47.390> stretcher<00:00:47.750> and<00:00:48.050> you<00:00:48.590> know

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:48.740 
of a stretcher and you know

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:51.430 
of a stretcher and you know
uncomfortable<00:00:49.329> conditions<00:00:50.329> straightaway<00:00:51.170> in

less than 24 hours
animals<00:00:53.360> were<00:00:53.480> here<00:00:53.960> they<00:00:54.560> settle<00:00:54.980> down<00:00:55.160> start

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:56.060 
animals were here they settle down start

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:57.790 
animals were here they settle down start
smelling<00:00:56.510> they<00:00:56.810> start<00:00:57.050> filling<00:00:57.350> they<00:00:57.590> start

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:57.800 
smelling they start filling they start

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.220 
smelling they start filling they start
hearing<00:00:58.310> as<00:00:58.520> well<00:00:58.550> different<00:00:59.060> ways<00:00:59.360> of<00:00:59.660> living

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:00.230 
hearing as well different ways of living

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:02.500 
hearing as well different ways of living
so<00:01:01.040> it's<00:01:01.190> going<00:01:01.340> to<00:01:01.460> take<00:01:01.640> a<00:01:01.670> bit<00:01:01.880> of<00:01:01.910> a<00:01:02.060> time<00:01:02.270> to

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:02.510 
so it's going to take a bit of a time to

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.179 
so it's going to take a bit of a time to
settle<00:01:02.720> as<00:01:03.230> be<00:01:03.410> the<00:01:03.470> one<00:01:03.680> we<00:01:03.800> move<00:01:03.950> to<00:01:04.100> a<00:01:04.129> new

00:01:04.179 --> 00:01:04.189 
settle as be the one we move to a new

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:07.270 
settle as be the one we move to a new
house<00:01:04.549> so<00:01:05.210> just<00:01:05.509> take<00:01:05.659> a<00:01:05.689> bit<00:01:05.930> of<00:01:05.960> time<00:01:06.280> Komodos

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
house so just take a bit of time Komodos

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.670 
house so just take a bit of time Komodos
becomes<00:01:07.640> part<00:01:07.939> of<00:01:08.000> that<00:01:08.329> human<00:01:08.990> methodology

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 
becomes part of that human methodology

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.010 
becomes part of that human methodology
