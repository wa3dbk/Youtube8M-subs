spacing<00:01:45.320> for<00:01:45.439> strawberries<00:01:45.890> and<00:01:46.789> we<00:01:46.850> put<00:01:47.030> them

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:47.180 
spacing for strawberries and we put them

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:48.760 
spacing for strawberries and we put them
in<00:01:47.329> making<00:01:47.869> sure<00:01:47.930> that<00:01:48.049> we<00:01:48.229> don't<00:01:48.439> get<00:01:48.619> the

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
in making sure that we don't get the

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:50.380 
in making sure that we don't get the
roots<00:01:48.979> curling<00:01:49.369> back<00:01:49.490> on<00:01:49.670> themselves<00:01:50.090> so

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
roots curling back on themselves so

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.660 
roots curling back on themselves so
they're<00:01:50.509> kept<00:01:51.079> nice<00:01:51.350> and<00:01:51.619> straight<00:01:51.890> it's

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
they're kept nice and straight it's

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:53.980 
they're kept nice and straight it's
really<00:01:52.909> important<00:01:53.390> when<00:01:53.509> you<00:01:53.630> plant<00:01:53.869> your

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
really important when you plant your

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.999 
really important when you plant your
strawberries<00:01:54.350> that<00:01:54.380> you<00:01:54.530> get<00:01:54.680> the<00:01:54.799> height

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:55.009 
strawberries that you get the height

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:57.370 
strawberries that you get the height
right<00:01:55.310> you<00:01:56.210> want<00:01:56.390> to<00:01:56.450> get<00:01:56.570> the<00:01:56.689> soil<00:01:56.930> level

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
right you want to get the soil level

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.370 
right you want to get the soil level
just<00:01:58.100> at<00:01:58.219> the<00:01:58.310> point<00:01:58.490> where<00:01:58.670> those<00:01:58.789> roots<00:01:59.119> are

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 
just at the point where those roots are

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.929 
just at the point where those roots are
where<00:02:00.380> they<00:02:00.500> meet<00:02:00.649> the<00:02:00.799> top<00:02:00.979> of<00:02:01.100> the<00:02:01.159> crown<00:02:01.399> if

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:01.939 
where they meet the top of the crown if

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:04.120 
where they meet the top of the crown if
they're<00:02:02.180> in<00:02:02.329> too<00:02:02.509> deep<00:02:02.810> they'll<00:02:03.770> rot<00:02:04.009> the

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
they're in too deep they'll rot the

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:05.590 
they're in too deep they'll rot the
crown<00:02:04.369> if<00:02:04.609> they're<00:02:04.880> in<00:02:04.969> too<00:02:05.149> high<00:02:05.359> they'll

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
crown if they're in too high they'll

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.450 
crown if they're in too high they'll
they'll<00:02:05.960> dry<00:02:06.200> out<00:02:06.229> so<00:02:06.920> that's<00:02:07.100> about<00:02:07.310> the

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 
they'll dry out so that's about the

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.719 
they'll dry out so that's about the
right<00:02:07.490> height<00:02:07.850> there<00:02:09.399> so<00:02:10.399> once<00:02:10.580> you've

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
right height there so once you've

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:12.040 
right height there so once you've
planted<00:02:11.000> your<00:02:11.209> strawberries<00:02:11.569> it's<00:02:11.720> time<00:02:11.900> to

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
planted your strawberries it's time to

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.840 
planted your strawberries it's time to
give<00:02:12.170> them<00:02:12.230> a<00:02:12.349> quick<00:02:12.530> drink<00:02:12.769> to<00:02:13.129> water

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.190 

you<00:02:16.850> don't<00:02:17.030> need<00:02:17.150> to<00:02:17.270> water<00:02:17.420> them<00:02:17.600> a<00:02:17.690> lot<00:02:17.870> this

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
you don't need to water them a lot this

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.660 
you don't need to water them a lot this
stage<00:02:18.440> you<00:02:18.680> just<00:02:18.710> need<00:02:19.010> to<00:02:19.100> keep<00:02:19.280> them<00:02:19.460> moist

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
stage you just need to keep them moist

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:20.980 
stage you just need to keep them moist
or<00:02:19.940> just<00:02:20.120> a<00:02:20.180> little<00:02:20.360> bit<00:02:20.450> of<00:02:20.510> moisture<00:02:20.630> into

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:20.990 
or just a little bit of moisture into

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:22.560 
or just a little bit of moisture into
the<00:02:21.110> soil<00:02:21.350> to<00:02:21.440> wash<00:02:21.680> them<00:02:21.860> into<00:02:21.980> the<00:02:22.070> ground

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:22.570 
the soil to wash them into the ground

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:24.670 
the soil to wash them into the ground
typically<00:02:23.570> you<00:02:23.660> get<00:02:23.810> these<00:02:23.990> runners<00:02:24.500> in<00:02:24.590> the

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
typically you get these runners in the

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.860 
typically you get these runners in the
middle<00:02:24.860> of<00:02:24.950> winter<00:02:25.100> so<00:02:25.970> the<00:02:26.090> soil<00:02:26.360> moisture<00:02:26.720> is

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
middle of winter so the soil moisture is

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.320 
middle of winter so the soil moisture is
already<00:02:27.170> quite<00:02:27.320> high<00:02:28.000> one<00:02:29.000> of<00:02:29.090> the<00:02:29.150> major

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
already quite high one of the major

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:30.910 
already quite high one of the major
reasons<00:02:29.780> that<00:02:29.840> strawberry<00:02:30.140> runners<00:02:30.500> fail<00:02:30.710> is

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
reasons that strawberry runners fail is

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.590 
reasons that strawberry runners fail is
over<00:02:31.280> watering<00:02:31.640> at<00:02:31.820> this<00:02:31.970> time<00:02:32.180> of<00:02:32.300> the<00:02:32.390> year

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:32.600 
over watering at this time of the year

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.240 
over watering at this time of the year
because<00:02:33.020> the<00:02:33.260> roots<00:02:33.470> tend<00:02:33.650> to<00:02:33.830> rot<00:02:34.010> in<00:02:34.160> the

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
because the roots tend to rot in the

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.130 
because the roots tend to rot in the
ground<00:02:34.330> so<00:02:35.330> I<00:02:35.360> really<00:02:35.600> just<00:02:35.750> need<00:02:35.900> to<00:02:35.990> water

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
ground so I really just need to water

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.320 
ground so I really just need to water
them<00:02:36.290> in<00:02:36.410> for<00:02:36.620> now<00:02:36.770> allow<00:02:37.550> them<00:02:37.760> to<00:02:37.940> settle<00:02:38.240> in

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
them in for now allow them to settle in

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:39.760 
them in for now allow them to settle in
and<00:02:38.450> start<00:02:38.690> to<00:02:38.840> grow<00:02:39.050> and<00:02:39.290> then<00:02:39.500> start

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:39.770 
and start to grow and then start

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:41.590 
and start to grow and then start
supplementary<00:02:40.430> watering<00:02:40.850> when<00:02:41.330> the<00:02:41.450> weather

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:41.600 
supplementary watering when the weather

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.210 
supplementary watering when the weather
starts<00:02:41.690> to<00:02:41.990> warm<00:02:42.200> up<00:02:42.380> and<00:02:42.500> the<00:02:42.590> soil<00:02:42.830> starts<00:02:43.010> to

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
starts to warm up and the soil starts to

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.970 
starts to warm up and the soil starts to
dry<00:02:43.510> at<00:02:44.510> that<00:02:44.690> point<00:02:44.930> -<00:02:45.140> it's<00:02:45.290> a<00:02:45.350> good<00:02:45.470> idea<00:02:45.560> for

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
dry at that point - it's a good idea for

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:47.830 
dry at that point - it's a good idea for
keeping<00:02:46.280> the<00:02:46.370> moisture<00:02:46.520> up<00:02:46.850> in<00:02:47.060> the<00:02:47.570> mint<00:02:47.720> in

keeping the moisture up in the mint in

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.300 
keeping the moisture up in the mint in

the in the spring time to bring some

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:50.830 
the in the spring time to bring some
mulch<00:02:49.490> around<00:02:49.850> to<00:02:49.970> keep<00:02:50.120> that<00:02:50.270> moisture<00:02:50.450> into
