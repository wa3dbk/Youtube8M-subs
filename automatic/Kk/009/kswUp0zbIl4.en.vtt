been modified a bit I've got a new

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.160 
been modified a bit I've got a new
sounder<00:00:32.800> which<00:00:33.010> is<00:00:33.160> a<00:00:33.190> 32<00:00:33.850> tone<00:00:34.210> banished

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:35.170 
sounder which is a 32 tone banished

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:38.040 
sounder which is a 32 tone banished
sounder<00:00:35.830> with<00:00:36.370> three<00:00:36.610> volumes<00:00:37.090> election<00:00:37.810> and

the<00:00:38.700> tape<00:00:39.700> has<00:00:40.060> been<00:00:40.239> replaced<00:00:40.690> too<00:00:41.230> white<00:00:41.500> I

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:42.720 
the tape has been replaced too white I

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.080 
the tape has been replaced too white I
will<00:00:43.720> now<00:00:43.870> demonstrate<00:00:44.550> what<00:00:45.550> the<00:00:45.700> sound<00:00:45.910> of

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:46.090 
will now demonstrate what the sound of

00:00:46.090 --> 00:01:04.100 
will now demonstrate what the sound of
here<00:00:46.270> is<00:00:46.390> like

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.230 

our<00:01:05.110> now<00:01:05.470> show<00:01:06.130> you<00:01:06.190> what<00:01:06.580> the<00:01:06.700> sounder<00:01:07.090> is

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:07.240 
our now show you what the sounder is

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:14.210 
our now show you what the sounder is
like<00:01:07.510> inside

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.710 

you've<00:01:14.850> got<00:01:15.090> eight<00:01:15.660> dip<00:01:16.050> switches<00:01:16.370> 125<00:01:17.370> is<00:01:17.760> for

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
you've got eight dip switches 125 is for

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.590 
you've got eight dip switches 125 is for
the<00:01:18.810> sound<00:01:19.170> selection<00:01:19.920> tips<00:01:20.610> which<00:01:20.850> six<00:01:21.300> is

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
the sound selection tips which six is

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.320 
the sound selection tips which six is
not<00:01:21.780> used<00:01:22.140> and<00:01:22.440> did<00:01:22.800> seven<00:01:23.430> and<00:01:23.610> eight<00:01:23.850> is<00:01:24.150> for

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
not used and did seven and eight is for

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.380 
not used and did seven and eight is for
the<00:01:24.390> volume<00:01:24.770> that<00:01:25.770> resistor<00:01:26.400> as<00:01:26.580> you<00:01:26.940> can<00:01:27.090> see

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
the volume that resistor as you can see

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.770 
the volume that resistor as you can see
you<00:01:28.200> so<00:01:28.440> the<00:01:28.590> leds<00:01:29.100> on<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.610> detector<00:01:30.210> can<00:01:30.480> draw

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
you so the leds on the detector can draw

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.920 
you so the leds on the detector can draw
some<00:01:31.770> current<00:01:32.280> away<00:01:32.550> from<00:01:33.150> the<00:01:33.270> sounder<00:01:33.780> to

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
some current away from the sounder to

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.150 
some current away from the sounder to
light<00:01:34.110> them<00:01:34.350> up<00:01:35.900> this<00:01:36.900> is<00:01:37.080> a<00:01:37.110> white<00:01:37.590> banish

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:38.160 
light them up this is a white banish

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:46.370 
light them up this is a white banish
sounder<00:01:38.880> and<00:01:40.070> costs<00:01:41.070> 16<00:01:41.730> pounds<00:01:42.770> and<00:01:45.380> that's

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
sounder and costs 16 pounds and that's

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.750 
sounder and costs 16 pounds and that's
the<00:01:46.560> only<00:01:46.710> modification<00:01:47.130> in<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:47.910> system<00:01:48.360> I

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:49.760 
the only modification in the system I

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.609 
the only modification in the system I
sure<00:01:50.760> now<00:01:50.940> put<00:01:51.330> the<00:01:51.450> sounder<00:01:51.960> back<00:01:52.260> on<00:01:52.470> its

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
sure now put the sounder back on its

00:01:52.619 --> 00:02:01.790 
sure now put the sounder back on its
mountain

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:01.800 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.190 

the<00:02:02.340> sounders<00:02:02.790> have<00:02:02.940> simply<00:02:03.330> twists<00:02:03.780> on<00:02:03.930> and

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
the sounders have simply twists on and

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.830 
the sounders have simply twists on and
off<00:02:04.350> part<00:02:05.280> from<00:02:05.430> the<00:02:05.490> tape<00:02:05.910> and<00:02:06.980> the<00:02:07.980> sounder

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
off part from the tape and the sounder

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.690 
off part from the tape and the sounder
there<00:02:09.840> is<00:02:09.960> no<00:02:10.170> other<00:02:10.460> modification<00:02:11.460> to<00:02:11.610> the

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
there is no other modification to the

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.150 
there is no other modification to the
system
