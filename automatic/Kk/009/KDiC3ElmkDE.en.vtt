another<00:04:23.800> cache<00:04:24.130> in<00:04:24.850> the<00:04:24.910> woods<00:04:25.500> mm-hmm

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 
another cache in the woods mm-hmm

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.550 
another cache in the woods mm-hmm
Sean<00:04:27.580> and<00:04:27.820> number<00:04:28.090> that<00:04:28.300> way<00:04:28.450> we<00:04:29.290> went<00:04:29.470> this

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.560 
Sean and number that way we went this

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.230 
Sean and number that way we went this
way<00:04:29.740> cuz<00:04:30.010> there<00:04:30.130> was<00:04:30.250> a<00:04:30.280> path<00:04:30.610> but<00:04:30.970> we're<00:04:31.120> not

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:31.240 
way cuz there was a path but we're not

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:32.610 
way cuz there was a path but we're not
really<00:04:31.420> sure<00:04:31.540> if<00:04:31.780> it's<00:04:31.870> the<00:04:31.990> right<00:04:32.140> path<00:04:32.410> but

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:32.620 
really sure if it's the right path but

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:33.900 
really sure if it's the right path but
it<00:04:32.740> looks<00:04:32.890> like<00:04:33.040> this<00:04:33.280> will<00:04:33.460> go<00:04:33.580> out<00:04:33.669> to<00:04:33.790> the

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:33.910 
it looks like this will go out to the

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:36.480 
it looks like this will go out to the
lake<00:04:34.060> I<00:04:34.450> think<00:04:35.350> he's<00:04:35.560> saying<00:04:35.800> you<00:04:36.040> don't<00:04:36.310> want

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:36.490

to come this way I think that's what he
said<00:04:37.930> too<00:04:38.140> so<00:04:38.919> we're<00:04:39.040> gonna<00:04:39.160> try<00:04:39.370> going<00:04:39.610> this

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:39.790 
said too so we're gonna try going this

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:41.130 
said too so we're gonna try going this
way<00:04:39.910> and<00:04:40.060> see<00:04:40.150> if<00:04:40.180> the<00:04:40.330> path<00:04:40.540> that<00:04:40.810> was<00:04:40.930> around

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:41.140 
way and see if the path that was around

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:42.750 
way and see if the path that was around
yuppies<00:04:41.890> head<00:04:42.070> I'll<00:04:42.190> read<00:04:42.400> the<00:04:42.550> cache

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:42.760 
yuppies head I'll read the cache

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:44.610 
yuppies head I'll read the cache
description<00:04:43.450> and<00:04:43.630> see<00:04:43.780> what<00:04:43.900> I<00:04:43.930> can<00:04:44.020> find<00:04:44.320> out
