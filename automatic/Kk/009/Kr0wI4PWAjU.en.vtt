00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:19.570 
ok so here we are silverstone national

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:23.130 
ok so here we are silverstone national

circuit in the new v12 Vantage S we have

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.339 
circuit in the new v12 Vantage S we have
got<00:00:23.289> the<00:00:23.439> car<00:00:23.710> in<00:00:24.189> small<00:00:25.180> boat<00:00:25.480> so<00:00:25.930> that<00:00:25.960> gives

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:40.010 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:41.899 

why

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
why

he married slums
yes<00:01:44.380> there<00:01:44.830> we<00:01:44.980> go<00:01:45.130> fouls

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:54.690 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.530 

right<00:01:55.260> here's<00:01:55.530> a<00:01:55.680> thought

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:58.540 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:01.190 

bring<00:01:59.540> some

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
bring some

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:10.490 
bring some
very<00:02:02.100> good

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:22.320 

now<00:02:11.400> supposing<00:02:12.030> I

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:28.390 

that

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.360 

right

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:46.200 

30<00:02:33.370> seconds

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:46.210 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:49.010 

nice<00:02:46.450> very<00:02:46.810> fast

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
nice very fast

00:02:49.020 --> 00:03:05.850 
nice very fast
game<00:02:49.170> of<00:02:49.380> breaks

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:05.860 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.190 

right

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:27.450 

so

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:27.460 

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:29.670 

roll<00:03:28.060> down<00:03:28.300> the<00:03:28.540> car<00:03:28.750> as<00:03:28.930> well<00:03:29.080> which<00:03:29.350> I<00:03:29.500> will

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
roll down the car as well which I will

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.580 
roll down the car as well which I will
demonstrate<00:03:30.010> on<00:03:30.460> the<00:03:30.550> next<00:03:30.790> lab<00:03:30.970> set<00:03:31.590> enables

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
demonstrate on the next lab set enables

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:35.700 
demonstrate on the next lab set enables
us<00:03:32.680> to<00:03:32.740> our<00:03:32.920> team<00:03:33.130> is<00:03:33.250> important

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:35.710 

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:37.860 

so<00:03:36.340> you<00:03:36.550> can

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
so you can

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:40.080 
so you can
how

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
how

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:57.590 
how

90<00:04:37.400> second<00:04:37.729> year<00:04:37.910> so<00:04:38.120> I<00:04:38.180> didn't<00:04:38.449> have<00:04:38.479> to

00:04:38.589 --> 00:04:38.599 
90 second year so I didn't have to

00:04:38.599 --> 00:04:40.800 
90 second year so I didn't have to
individually

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:40.810 
individually

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:43.700 
individually
on<00:04:41.050> the<00:04:41.169> right

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:43.710 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:46.880 

actually<00:04:44.840> select<00:04:45.840> it<00:04:46.020> broke<00:04:46.260> again<00:04:46.470> the

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:49.070 
corner l Malone braking zone like that

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:56.980 
corner l Malone braking zone like that
actually<00:04:50.070> looks<00:04:50.280> very<00:04:50.580> low

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:56.990 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:04.380 

bad<00:04:57.590> luck<00:04:57.770> now
