00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:04.100 
hey you too is part one through five one
two<00:00:02.820> five<00:00:02.850> videos<00:00:03.389> they<00:00:03.720> have<00:00:03.840> a<00:00:03.899> video

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:04.110 
two five videos they have a video

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:05.510 
two five videos they have a video
showing<00:00:04.290> you<00:00:04.650> that<00:00:04.830> legendary<00:00:05.310> animal

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:05.520 
showing you that legendary animal

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.299 
showing you that legendary animal
locations<00:00:06.509> and<00:00:06.750> the<00:00:06.810> kills<00:00:07.080> in<00:00:07.649> single-player

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
locations and the kills in single-player

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.150 
locations and the kills in single-player
because<00:00:08.610> a<00:00:08.639> multiplayer<00:00:09.240> it's<00:00:10.080> I<00:00:10.559> think<00:00:10.920> it's

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
because a multiplayer it's I think it's

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.270 
because a multiplayer it's I think it's
more<00:00:11.370> like<00:00:11.550> a<00:00:11.580> horde<00:00:12.000> and<00:00:12.679> I<00:00:13.679> don't<00:00:14.099> know<00:00:14.190> if

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
more like a horde and I don't know if

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.740 
more like a horde and I don't know if
it's<00:00:14.370> the<00:00:14.429> same<00:00:14.460> locations<00:00:15.089> or<00:00:15.179> not<00:00:15.389> I<00:00:15.509> don't

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
it's the same locations or not I don't

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.279 
it's the same locations or not I don't
think<00:00:15.900> it<00:00:16.020> is<00:00:16.170> but<00:00:16.949> it<00:00:17.010> might<00:00:17.220> be<00:00:17.369> I<00:00:18.289> haven't

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
think it is but it might be I haven't

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:20.810 
think it is but it might be I haven't
done<00:00:19.439> them<00:00:19.590> on<00:00:19.650> multi<00:00:20.070> player<00:00:20.250> but<00:00:20.609> I'm<00:00:20.699> I

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
done them on multi player but I'm I

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.670 
done them on multi player but I'm I
didn't<00:00:21.090> later<00:00:21.210> so<00:00:21.570> I<00:00:21.600> think<00:00:22.020> it's<00:00:22.380> more<00:00:22.529> like<00:00:22.650> a

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
didn't later so I think it's more like a

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.439 
didn't later so I think it's more like a
horde<00:00:23.010> but<00:00:23.310> we're<00:00:23.820> just<00:00:23.850> one<00:00:24.060> single<00:00:24.210> player

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
horde but we're just one single player

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.500 
horde but we're just one single player
it's<00:00:24.720> just<00:00:24.930> the<00:00:25.019> animals<00:00:25.350> stuff<00:00:26.210> so<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.300> first

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
it's just the animals stuff so the first

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:35.260 
it's just the animals stuff so the first
one<00:00:27.750> is<00:00:28.490> con<00:00:29.490> at<00:00:30.470> Odell<00:00:31.730> ojos<00:00:32.730> del<00:00:33.450> Diablo

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:35.270 
one is con at Odell ojos del Diablo

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:37.010 
one is con at Odell ojos del Diablo
basically<00:00:36.270> the<00:00:36.390> only<00:00:36.480> thing<00:00:36.630> that's

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
basically the only thing that's

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.010 
basically the only thing that's
different<00:00:37.140> about<00:00:37.860> the<00:00:38.460> animals<00:00:38.850> is<00:00:39.780> they're<00:00:39.989> a

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
different about the animals is they're a

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.020 
different about the animals is they're a
little<00:00:40.260> bit<00:00:40.410> tougher<00:00:40.620> to<00:00:40.860> kill<00:00:41.219> and<00:00:41.579> maybe

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
little bit tougher to kill and maybe

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.510 
little bit tougher to kill and maybe
like<00:00:42.270> just<00:00:42.719> a<00:00:43.200> little<00:00:43.290> different<00:00:43.860> like

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
like just a little different like

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:45.680 
like just a little different like
they're<00:00:44.730> little<00:00:44.850> hard<00:00:45.030> to<00:00:45.120> kill<00:00:45.329> I<00:00:45.360> guess<00:00:45.570> you

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
they're little hard to kill I guess you

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.060
