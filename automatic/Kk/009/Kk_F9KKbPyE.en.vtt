okay<00:00:02.159> back<00:00:03.470> this<00:00:04.470> tool<00:00:05.040> has<00:00:05.490> saved<00:00:05.520> me<00:00:06.859> out<00:00:07.859> of

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
okay back this tool has saved me out of

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.360 
okay back this tool has saved me out of
a<00:00:08.250> lot<00:00:08.580> of<00:00:08.820> tight<00:00:09.120> situations<00:00:09.860> okay<00:00:10.860> so<00:00:10.920> what

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
a lot of tight situations okay so what

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.609 
a lot of tight situations okay so what
I'm<00:00:11.460> gonna<00:00:11.639> do<00:00:11.940> is<00:00:12.150> just<00:00:12.860> push<00:00:13.860> my<00:00:15.619> wire

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
I'm gonna do is just push my wire

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:25.089 
I'm gonna do is just push my wire
through<00:00:19.580> as<00:00:20.580> far<00:00:20.970> as<00:00:21.240> possible

00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:25.099 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:29.200 

okay<00:00:26.099> there<00:00:26.609> is<00:00:26.730> a<00:00:26.760> reason<00:00:27.330> why<00:00:27.539> I<00:00:27.570> used<00:00:28.109> such<00:00:28.560> a

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:29.210 
okay there is a reason why I used such a

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:35.780 
okay there is a reason why I used such a
slim<00:00:32.239> shrink<00:00:33.239> tubing<00:00:33.600> if<00:00:34.530> I<00:00:34.860> had<00:00:35.160> cut<00:00:35.550> the

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
slim shrink tubing if I had cut the

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:44.930 
slim shrink tubing if I had cut the
wires<00:00:36.680> apart<00:00:37.680> I<00:00:38.629> would<00:00:39.629> have<00:00:43.670> wouldn't<00:00:44.670> have

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
wires apart I would have wouldn't have

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:52.490 
wires apart I would have wouldn't have
to<00:00:47.329> I<00:00:48.829> wouldn't<00:00:49.829> have<00:00:49.950> to<00:00:50.129> use<00:00:50.160> it<00:00:51.140> but<00:00:52.140> I<00:00:52.199> need

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
to I wouldn't have to use it but I need

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.360 
to I wouldn't have to use it but I need
it<00:00:52.530> to<00:00:53.010> shrink<00:00:53.370> as<00:00:53.730> much<00:00:53.760> as<00:00:54.239> possible<00:00:55.010> back<00:00:56.010> to

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
it to shrink as much as possible back to

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.560 
it to shrink as much as possible back to
my<00:00:56.579> trusty<00:00:57.539> tool<00:00:58.219> to<00:00:59.219> find<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.670> place<00:01:00.149> where<00:01:00.180> I

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
my trusty tool to find the place where I

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.830 
my trusty tool to find the place where I
can<00:01:01.430> jam<00:01:02.430> it<00:01:02.840> just<00:01:03.840> push<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.409> connector<00:01:05.010> so

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:05.840 
can jam it just push the connector so

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.320 
can jam it just push the connector so
and<00:01:06.840> I<00:01:07.170> want<00:01:07.530> to<00:01:07.650> use<00:01:07.830> as<00:01:08.189> much<00:01:08.460> of<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:09.030> shrink

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
and I want to use as much of the shrink

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.399 
and I want to use as much of the shrink
tubing<00:01:09.750> as<00:01:09.950> possible<00:01:10.950> because<00:01:11.939> that<00:01:12.659> gives<00:01:13.020> me

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
tubing as possible because that gives me

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:33.680 
tubing as possible because that gives me
a<00:01:15.560> needed<00:01:16.560> strength<00:01:18.350> over<00:01:19.350> here<00:01:20.630> okay

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:33.690 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:35.250 

all<00:01:34.690> right

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:35.260 
all right

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:40.680 
all right
so<00:01:35.970> we<00:01:36.970> are<00:01:37.270> through<00:01:38.670> see<00:01:39.670> if<00:01:39.790> I<00:01:39.910> had<00:01:40.060> cut<00:01:40.540> the

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:40.690 
so we are through see if I had cut the

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:44.010 
so we are through see if I had cut the
wires<00:01:40.930> I<00:01:41.260> could<00:01:41.470> use<00:01:41.680> even<00:01:42.150> slimmer<00:01:43.150> shrink

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020 
wires I could use even slimmer shrink

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.270 
wires I could use even slimmer shrink
tubing<00:01:44.380> and<00:01:44.560> actually<00:01:44.980> lay<00:01:45.550> several<00:01:46.060> layers

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
tubing and actually lay several layers

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.430 
tubing and actually lay several layers
okay<00:01:48.280> so<00:01:48.340> we're<00:01:48.970> gonna<00:01:49.180> do<00:01:49.570> is<00:01:49.750> pull<00:01:50.650> it<00:01:50.860> back<00:01:51.370> a

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:52.440 
okay so we're gonna do is pull it back a

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.350 
okay so we're gonna do is pull it back a
little<00:01:53.440> bit<00:01:53.770> and<00:01:54.100> now<00:01:54.280> we're<00:01:54.610> going<00:01:54.850> to<00:01:55.060> shrink

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:55.360 
little bit and now we're going to shrink

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.420 
little bit and now we're going to shrink
it<00:01:55.510> and<00:01:55.870> then<00:01:56.020> we're<00:01:56.229> gonna<00:01:56.350> weigh<00:01:56.680> several

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:57.430 
it and then we're gonna weigh several

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:07.180 
it and then we're gonna weigh several
more<00:01:58.240> layers<00:01:58.750> to<00:01:58.780> give<00:01:59.320> it<00:01:59.470> good<00:02:00.840> strength

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:07.190 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:15.160 

either<00:02:12.140> miracle

and I will be please give it a little

00:02:50.190 --> 00:03:16.280 
and I will be please give it a little
more<00:02:50.519> strength

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.090 
with solutions is a billing so I'm just
gonna<00:03:23.400> shrink<00:03:23.820> it<00:03:24.030> like<00:03:24.240> that<00:03:24.770> you<00:03:25.770> know<00:03:25.860> what

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
gonna shrink it like that you know what

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.280 
gonna shrink it like that you know what
I<00:03:26.130> did<00:03:26.460> was<00:03:26.700> I<00:03:26.850> cut<00:03:27.150> off<00:03:27.300> a<00:03:27.330> piece<00:03:27.750> of<00:03:27.990> gear

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
I did was I cut off a piece of gear

shrink tube and I'm gonna place it over

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:33.260 
shrink tube and I'm gonna place it over
I<00:03:31.200> should<00:03:31.620> have<00:03:31.920> gotten<00:03:32.130> a<00:03:32.370> larger<00:03:32.760> piece<00:03:33.030> or

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:33.270 
I should have gotten a larger piece or

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:36.410 
I should have gotten a larger piece or
several<00:03:33.660> pieces<00:03:33.990> and<00:03:34.580> I'm<00:03:35.580> gonna<00:03:35.790> strengthen

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
several pieces and I'm gonna strengthen

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:48.000 
several pieces and I'm gonna strengthen
that<00:03:36.900> weak<00:03:37.440> spot

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:55.960 
it's very flexible right now but as the

00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:02.130 
it's very flexible right now but as the
tube<00:03:57.750> pardons<00:03:58.750> or<00:03:59.170> goes<00:04:00.070> down<00:04:00.100> a<00:04:00.760> partner's<00:04:01.240> so

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:06.580 
this one away from the heater this one

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:11.810 
this one away from the heater this one
is<00:04:07.240> fairly<00:04:08.130> large

as you can see as this larger fish

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:47.100 
as you can see as this larger fish
shrinks<00:04:42.520> it<00:04:42.700> leaves<00:04:43.389> the<00:04:45.480> it<00:04:46.480> doesn't<00:04:46.780> sink

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:47.110 
shrinks it leaves the it doesn't sink

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:50.820 
shrinks it leaves the it doesn't sink
all<00:04:47.350> the<00:04:47.380> way<00:04:47.730> its<00:04:48.730> smallest<00:04:49.389> diameter<00:04:49.660> is<00:04:50.560> too

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.830 
all the way its smallest diameter is too

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:57.860 
all the way its smallest diameter is too
big<00:04:52.590> boy<00:04:53.650> that's<00:04:54.100> hot<00:04:54.630> all<00:04:55.630> right<00:04:55.810> so<00:04:56.290> now

let's give it hopefully this one will

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:07.159 
let's give it hopefully this one will
still<00:05:02.440> fit<00:05:03.510> we'll<00:05:04.510> give<00:05:04.810> it<00:05:04.840> another<00:05:05.200> layer

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:07.169 
still fit we'll give it another layer

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:12.150 
still fit we'll give it another layer
yep<00:05:08.820> we're<00:05:09.820> good<00:05:10.330> and<00:05:10.570> as<00:05:10.870> you<00:05:10.900> can<00:05:11.200> see<00:05:11.530> I'm

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:12.160 
yep we're good and as you can see I'm

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:15.390 
yep we're good and as you can see I'm
not<00:05:12.610> I<00:05:12.850> don't<00:05:12.970> care<00:05:13.240> about<00:05:13.750> this<00:05:14.020> part<00:05:14.410> but<00:05:15.340> I

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:15.400 
not I don't care about this part but I

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.330 
not I don't care about this part but I
do<00:05:15.639> want<00:05:16.060> to<00:05:16.120> give<00:05:16.419> it<00:05:16.510> a<00:05:16.630> little<00:05:16.840> more<00:05:17.340> freedom

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:18.340 
do want to give it a little more freedom

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:41.940 
do want to give it a little more freedom
on<00:05:18.460> this<00:05:18.639> side

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:41.950 

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:45.430 

and<00:05:42.950> for<00:05:43.490> the<00:05:43.700> final<00:05:44.030> touch<00:05:44.210> I'm<00:05:45.020> just<00:05:45.290> gonna

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:45.440 
and for the final touch I'm just gonna

00:05:45.440 --> 00:06:04.600 
and for the final touch I'm just gonna
put<00:05:45.800> a<00:05:45.830> small<00:05:49.480> piece<00:05:51.820> just<00:05:52.820> right<00:05:53.780> there

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:04.610 

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:14.290 

okay<00:06:06.080> this<00:06:07.080> is<00:06:10.550> strong

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:14.300 

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:25.940 

Peter<00:06:16.390> hold<00:06:17.390> on<00:06:17.660> over<00:06:18.080> there<00:06:18.370> as<00:06:19.370> you<00:06:20.300> can<00:06:20.570> see

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:25.950 

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:32.469 

it's<00:06:26.460> flexible

00:06:32.469 --> 00:06:32.479 

00:06:32.479 --> 00:06:37.779 

and<00:06:33.020> it<00:06:33.169> keeps<00:06:33.379> a<00:06:33.590> lot<00:06:33.740> more<00:06:34.069> body<00:06:34.759> so<00:06:35.749> now<00:06:36.789> what

00:06:37.779 --> 00:06:37.789 
and it keeps a lot more body so now what

00:06:37.789 --> 00:06:40.629 
and it keeps a lot more body so now what
I<00:06:37.819> need<00:06:37.999> to<00:06:38.180> do<00:06:38.569> is<00:06:38.840> measure<00:06:39.289> how<00:06:39.949> far<00:06:40.309> back<00:06:40.610> I

00:06:40.629 --> 00:06:40.639 
I need to do is measure how far back I

00:06:40.639 --> 00:06:49.850 
I need to do is measure how far back I
need<00:06:41.089> to<00:06:41.300> cut<00:06:41.539> this<00:06:44.529> knife

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:49.860 

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:54.200 

slice<00:06:50.789> through<00:06:51.360> our<00:06:51.719> sandwich<00:06:52.560> of<00:06:53.129> the<00:06:53.669> shrink

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:54.210 
slice through our sandwich of the shrink

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:59.290 
slice through our sandwich of the shrink
tubing<00:06:54.689> hopefully<00:06:55.469> I'll<00:06:55.560> get<00:06:55.889> it<00:06:56.719> straight

00:06:59.290 --> 00:06:59.300 
tubing hopefully I'll get it straight

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:02.899 
tubing hopefully I'll get it straight
but<00:07:00.680> the<00:07:01.680> reason<00:07:02.009> I<00:07:02.129> didn't<00:07:02.430> want<00:07:02.580> to<00:07:02.699> damage

00:07:02.899 --> 00:07:02.909 
but the reason I didn't want to damage

00:07:02.909 --> 00:07:07.490 
but the reason I didn't want to damage
that<00:07:03.360> metal<00:07:04.430> shroud<00:07:05.430> is<00:07:06.020> precisely<00:07:07.020> because

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:07.500 
that metal shroud is precisely because

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:15.530 
that metal shroud is precisely because
of<00:07:07.710> this<00:07:08.150> this<00:07:09.150> gives<00:07:09.750> me<00:07:09.990> an<00:07:10.139> ability<00:07:10.409> to

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:15.540 

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:17.629 

keep<00:07:16.290> it

00:07:17.629 --> 00:07:17.639 
keep it

00:07:17.639 --> 00:07:22.700 
keep it
give<00:07:18.539> it<00:07:18.659> strength

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:22.710 

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:31.660 

okay<00:07:23.930> /<00:07:24.930> where's

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:31.670 

00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:35.720 

I<00:07:31.700> think<00:07:32.270> it's

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:35.730 

00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:38.420 

good<00:07:36.300> enough

00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:38.430 
good enough

00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:42.590 
good enough
and<00:07:40.040> hopefully<00:07:41.040> it<00:07:41.100> will<00:07:41.190> work<00:07:41.250> I<00:07:41.760> can't<00:07:42.330> test

00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:42.600 
and hopefully it will work I can't test

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:44.780 
and hopefully it will work I can't test
it<00:07:42.840> like<00:07:43.139> I<00:07:43.290> said<00:07:43.470> I<00:07:43.590> do<00:07:43.650> not<00:07:43.830> have<00:07:44.220> to<00:07:44.430> device

00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:44.790 
it like I said I do not have to device

00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:48.950 
it like I said I do not have to device
but<00:07:45.949> there<00:07:46.949> you<00:07:47.100> have<00:07:47.310> it<00:07:47.510> and<00:07:48.510> that's<00:07:48.660> how<00:07:48.840> it

00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:48.960 
but there you have it and that's how it

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:51.850 
but there you have it and that's how it
usually<00:07:49.169> is<00:07:49.470> only<00:07:49.889> one<00:07:50.220> wire<00:07:50.460> breaks<00:07:50.940> unless

00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:51.860 
usually is only one wire breaks unless

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:59.379 
usually is only one wire breaks unless
unless<00:07:53.479> you<00:07:54.479> really<00:07:54.720> tear<00:07:55.139> it<00:07:55.260> off<00:07:58.250> well

00:07:59.379 --> 00:07:59.389 
unless you really tear it off well

00:07:59.389 --> 00:08:02.120 
unless you really tear it off well
hopefully<00:08:00.389> this<00:08:00.870> helps<00:08:01.229> some<00:08:01.470> people<00:08:01.500> and

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:02.130 
hopefully this helps some people and

00:08:02.130 --> 00:08:05.449 
hopefully this helps some people and
have<00:08:02.910> a<00:08:02.940> nice<00:08:03.240> day
