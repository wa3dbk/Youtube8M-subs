00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 
triple moisture shower creams and I like

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.850 
triple moisture shower creams and I like
these<00:03:55.120> because<00:03:55.390> they're<00:03:56.140> not<00:03:56.290> as<00:03:56.440> thick<00:03:56.740> as

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:56.860 
these because they're not as thick as

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:58.230 
these because they're not as thick as
the<00:03:56.980> triple<00:03:57.220> moisture<00:03:57.340> shower<00:03:57.700> creams<00:03:58.000> which

the triple moisture shower creams which

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:00.180 
the triple moisture shower creams which
were<00:03:58.450> a<00:03:58.480> little<00:03:58.600> too<00:03:58.840> much<00:03:59.020> for<00:03:59.260> me<00:03:59.380> but<00:03:59.560> they

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:00.190 
were a little too much for me but they

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:01.590 
were a little too much for me but they
still<00:04:00.400> have<00:04:00.580> a<00:04:00.610> little<00:04:00.820> bit<00:04:00.910> more<00:04:01.120> moisture

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:01.600 
still have a little bit more moisture

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:04.250
