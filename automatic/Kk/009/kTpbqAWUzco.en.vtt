was<00:00:46.680> murder

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.100 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.479 

still<00:00:50.100> a<00:00:50.129> bit<00:00:50.309> restrictive<00:00:50.910> sleepingwise<00:00:52.489> but

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
still a bit restrictive sleepingwise but

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.689 
still a bit restrictive sleepingwise but
most<00:00:53.760> of<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:53.940> time<00:00:54.210> it's<00:00:55.140> just<00:00:55.500> a<00:00:55.860> little<00:00:56.579> bit

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
most of the time it's just a little bit

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:02.689 
most of the time it's just a little bit
of<00:00:56.789> discomfort<00:00:57.210> that's<00:00:58.020> all<00:00:58.289> and<00:01:01.280> you<00:01:02.280> know<00:01:02.430> it

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
of discomfort that's all and you know it

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.369 
of discomfort that's all and you know it
might<00:01:02.850> have<00:01:02.969> healed<00:01:03.210> by<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.480> time<00:01:03.719> I<00:01:03.899> we<00:01:04.199> get

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
might have healed by the time I we get

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.600 
might have healed by the time I we get
back<00:01:05.570> anyway<00:01:06.570> you<00:01:07.530> know<00:01:07.590> 10<00:01:07.890> days<00:01:07.920> since<00:01:08.400> that

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
back anyway you know 10 days since that

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.260 
back anyway you know 10 days since that
happened<00:01:08.970> we've<00:01:09.210> made<00:01:10.159> just<00:01:11.159> under<00:01:11.460> 500<00:01:12.030> miles

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
happened we've made just under 500 miles

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.340 
happened we've made just under 500 miles
on<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.500> route<00:01:13.650> back<00:01:13.920> so<00:01:14.280> quite<00:01:14.520> a<00:01:14.549> low<00:01:14.790> average

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.350 
on the route back so quite a low average

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.679 
on the route back so quite a low average
over<00:01:16.350> those<00:01:16.500> 10<00:01:16.799> days<00:01:16.830> but<00:01:17.520> we<00:01:17.610> had<00:01:17.729> one<00:01:17.970> day<00:01:18.240> we

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
over those 10 days but we had one day we

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.280 
over those 10 days but we had one day we
would<00:01:18.840> totally<00:01:19.049> be<00:01:19.380> calmed<00:01:20.030> 24<00:01:21.030> hours<00:01:21.270> made<00:01:21.900> 10

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
would totally be calmed 24 hours made 10

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.820 
would totally be calmed 24 hours made 10
miles<00:01:22.770> in<00:01:22.860> that<00:01:23.040> time<00:01:24.170> and<00:01:25.170> apart<00:01:25.619> from<00:01:25.650> that

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
miles in that time and apart from that

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.469 
miles in that time and apart from that
the<00:01:26.189> weather<00:01:26.400> has<00:01:26.580> been<00:01:26.729> very<00:01:26.790> very

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
the weather has been very very

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.690 
the weather has been very very
challenging<00:01:30.110> the<00:01:31.110> Labrador<00:01:31.590> sea<00:01:32.040> is<00:01:32.220> not<00:01:32.490> the

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
challenging the Labrador sea is not the

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.350 
challenging the Labrador sea is not the
kindest<00:01:33.240> of<00:01:33.630> places<00:01:36.020> very<00:01:37.020> gray<00:01:37.439> very<00:01:37.470> cold

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
kindest of places very gray very cold

kindest of places very gray very cold
rain<00:01:39.360> fog<00:01:40.579> and<00:01:41.579> what<00:01:41.759> I've<00:01:41.880> been<00:01:42.000> learning

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
rain fog and what I've been learning

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.120 
rain fog and what I've been learning
about<00:01:43.140> with<00:01:43.619> these<00:01:43.770> incredibly<00:01:44.780> quick

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130 
about with these incredibly quick

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:51.139 
about with these incredibly quick
changes<00:01:47.130> in<00:01:47.280> weather<00:01:49.579> don't<00:01:50.579> really<00:01:50.850> think<00:01:51.030> of

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
changes in weather don't really think of

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.630 
changes in weather don't really think of
experience<00:01:51.829> weather<00:01:52.829> quite<00:01:53.159> like<00:01:53.399> this<00:01:53.579> I

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
experience weather quite like this I

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.789 
experience weather quite like this I
mean<00:01:53.880> yesterday<00:01:54.060> for<00:01:54.509> example<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.560> last

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
mean yesterday for example the the last

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:01.639 
mean yesterday for example the the last
24<00:01:56.369> hours<00:01:56.750> we've<00:01:57.750> had<00:01:57.990> three<00:01:58.880> different<00:02:00.649> blows

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
24 hours we've had three different blows

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.469 
24 hours we've had three different blows
at<00:02:01.979> up<00:02:02.100> to<00:02:02.399> 6<00:02:03.060> to<00:02:03.270> 7<00:02:03.689> 4<00:02:03.960> 6<00:02:04.200> or<00:02:04.409> 7

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
at up to 6 to 7 4 6 or 7

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:09.669 
at up to 6 to 7 4 6 or 7
within<00:02:06.049> a<00:02:06.140> 24-hour<00:02:06.710> period<00:02:07.300> from<00:02:08.679> completely

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 
within a 24-hour period from completely

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:12.850 
within a 24-hour period from completely
different<00:02:09.979> directions<00:02:10.780> with<00:02:11.780> comms<00:02:12.379> in

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
different directions with comms in

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.490 
different directions with comms in
between<00:02:13.340> so<00:02:13.700> these<00:02:14.540> winds<00:02:14.810> get<00:02:15.170> up<00:02:15.290> very

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
between so these winds get up very

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.680 
between so these winds get up very
quickly<00:02:15.800> and<00:02:16.610> then<00:02:16.730> they<00:02:16.849> drop<00:02:17.090> away<00:02:17.239> very

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
quickly and then they drop away very

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.350 
quickly and then they drop away very
quickly<00:02:17.920> and<00:02:18.920> they<00:02:19.129> start<00:02:19.519> it<00:02:19.640> from<00:02:19.879> somewhere

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
quickly and they start it from somewhere

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.330 
quickly and they start it from somewhere
else<00:02:20.540> and<00:02:21.200> it<00:02:21.349> doesn't<00:02:21.590> seem<00:02:21.739> to<00:02:21.890> have<00:02:22.040> any

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
else and it doesn't seem to have any

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:23.860 
else and it doesn't seem to have any
relationship<00:02:22.940> either<00:02:23.180> with<00:02:23.510> what<00:02:23.720> the

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
relationship either with what the

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:29.500 
relationship either with what the
barometers<00:02:24.410> doing<00:02:25.690> but<00:02:26.690> we're<00:02:27.050> now<00:02:28.000> about<00:02:29.000> two

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
barometers doing but we're now about two

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.229 
barometers doing but we're now about two
hundred<00:02:29.660> and<00:02:29.900> thirty<00:02:30.170> miles<00:02:30.700> south<00:02:31.700> of<00:02:31.940> Cape

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:32.239 
hundred and thirty miles south of Cape

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:34.289 
hundred and thirty miles south of Cape
Farewell<00:02:32.810> the<00:02:33.380> southern<00:02:33.680> tip<00:02:33.799> of<00:02:34.010> Greenland

00:02:34.289 --> 00:02:34.299 
Farewell the southern tip of Greenland

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:37.240 
Farewell the southern tip of Greenland
so<00:02:35.299> we're<00:02:35.480> starting<00:02:35.750> to<00:02:36.049> exit<00:02:36.650> the<00:02:36.769> Labrador

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
so we're starting to exit the Labrador

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.890 
so we're starting to exit the Labrador
sea<00:02:37.700> and<00:02:38.060> move<00:02:38.810> back<00:02:39.319> properly<00:02:40.220> into<00:02:40.730> the

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
sea and move back properly into the

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:46.300 
sea and move back properly into the
North<00:02:41.900> Atlantic<00:02:43.989> that's<00:02:44.989> our<00:02:45.260> sort<00:02:46.220> of

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
North Atlantic that's our sort of

North Atlantic that's our sort of
