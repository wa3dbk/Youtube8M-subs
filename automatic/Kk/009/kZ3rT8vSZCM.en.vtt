00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:12.679
 drowsiness of the farewell CEO and shoe manufacturer the sportswoman 

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:15.679
 I have the pleasure to introduce you stratos 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.269
 now I'll show you the best way 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.649
 for footwear so you can use the best possible way 

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:51.090
 open the titanium top line by throwing the cord in from the morning 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.300
 vote down on itself the support part, 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.300
 pivoting on which said 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:04.570
 bring the knee-high backwards the belly of the dallas unhooks 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:07.570
 coffee 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:12.390
 open the micrometric closure acting on the snow 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:13.350
 caution 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.470

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:29.380
 open examples of compression on the instep then remove the foot pocket 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.690
 it 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.860
 loose beautiful shoe by pulling the buttonhole upwards 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:44.580
 a place on the instep 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.580
 then unfasten the upper part 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.880
 wear the foot pocket, note the arch of the front 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.870
 helping with the other intermediate 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:04.650
 the final phase of lacing make sure that the lace with wheels 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:07.740
 around the last kick from top to bottom 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.000
 then rotate it around the calf in a alberto position 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.169
 optimal 

00:02:13.169 --> 00:02:14.119
 caution 

00:02:14.119 --> 00:02:17.539
 alludes to exert too much pressure to allow better circulation 

00:02:17.539 --> 00:02:19.119
 blood 

00:02:19.119 --> 00:02:22.439
 in the case of the junta you are too short 

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:25.439
 pages on the node positioned initiatives lacing 

00:02:26.499 --> 00:02:31.259
 inserting curtain crap into the scarp box requires tilted outwards 

00:02:31.259 --> 00:02:35.729
 during this operation make sure that the compression wind 

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:38.729
 they do not remain crushed under the foot 

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:43.229
 superimposing compression text on this very important operation 

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:46.319
 because it will determine a better locking of the foot 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:49.559
 and close the door by rotating it outwards 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:54.700
 make sure that the two limit switch sources located under the door yes 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.869
 fit the hull well 

00:02:56.869 --> 00:03:00.769
 then insert the micrometric closure in the watts to fix it with the 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:05.239
 ratchet movement remaining in axis with the rack as long as foot remains 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:06.979
 well still of the hull 

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:10.579
 this operation retires from your internal compression 

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:16.189
 check that the leg is completely cracked backwards 

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:21.879
 place the ceiling hooks to the caterpillar in the special beautiful to the shoe 

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:25.729
 bring knee-high forward 

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:30.430
 mutter down the lever support flap positioning in this way 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:33.430
 to be able to fix the cord in diana 

00:03:37.369 --> 00:03:41.729
 customize retirement by acting on the regulation terminal node 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:49.859
 check that the rear device for locking the unlocking devices 

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:52.859
 knee-high functions optimally 

00:03:57.149 --> 00:04:00.609
 the hull is supplied with the inclination of the leg in position 

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:01.979
 intermediate 

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:05.649
 if you need to change the knee sock angle 

00:04:05.649 --> 00:04:09.039
 it is possible to act on the rear anchorage block in titanium 

00:04:09.039 --> 00:04:12.039
 unscrewing the first sky tv 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:20.440
 once the optimal definition is identified, terlizzi will be recommended 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.900
 all using a 4 newton meter load 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:27.220
 you are sia internal life for the external locknut 

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:32.029
 we also recommend using a liquid file block tif even if it comes 

00:04:32.029 --> 00:04:35.229
 maintained the intermediate position 

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:38.649

 in this project the sportswoman investors over 80 years of experience 

00:05:13.429 --> 00:05:16.429
 in the footwear sector 

00:05:18.839 --> 00:05:22.689
 now net to your feet the most performing suspension product on the mac 

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:27.779
 using the best existing materials such as carbon and titanium 

00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:44.270
 this result achieved to all of you good dinner
