markers<00:00:33.750> of<00:00:33.960> delayed<00:00:34.530> onset<00:00:34.710> muscle<00:00:34.980> soreness

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:35.450 
markers of delayed onset muscle soreness

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:38.270 
markers of delayed onset muscle soreness
now<00:00:36.450> you'll<00:00:36.630> get<00:00:36.809> sore<00:00:37.230> and<00:00:37.530> typically<00:00:38.129> you'll

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
now you'll get sore and typically you'll

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.210 
now you'll get sore and typically you'll
get<00:00:38.400> sore<00:00:38.610> 24-48<00:00:39.600> hours<00:00:39.720> after<00:00:40.350> you<00:00:40.890> do<00:00:41.010> some

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:41.220 
get sore 24-48 hours after you do some

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.750 
get sore 24-48 hours after you do some
strenuous<00:00:41.550> bout<00:00:42.000> and<00:00:42.840> so<00:00:43.290> we<00:00:43.440> were<00:00:43.559> looking<00:00:43.890> at

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
strenuous bout and so we were looking at

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.270 
strenuous bout and so we were looking at
that<00:00:45.000> period<00:00:45.390> of<00:00:45.449> time<00:00:45.510> about<00:00:45.870> 24-48<00:00:46.470> we

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
that period of time about 24-48 we

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.369 
that period of time about 24-48 we
actually<00:00:47.820> went<00:00:47.940> as<00:00:48.030> far<00:00:48.210> as<00:00:48.300> 72<00:00:48.690> hours<00:00:49.140> after

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
actually went as far as 72 hours after

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.549 
actually went as far as 72 hours after
you<00:00:49.980> did<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.190> exercise<00:00:50.790> the<00:00:51.720> exercise<00:00:52.140> we<00:00:52.350> had

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
you did the exercise the exercise we had

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.430 
you did the exercise the exercise we had
the<00:00:53.520> subjects<00:00:53.970> do<00:00:54.149> was<00:00:54.780> completed<00:00:55.290> on<00:00:55.410> the

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
the subjects do was completed on the

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.280 
the subjects do was completed on the
biotechs<00:00:55.980> isokinetic<00:00:56.550> dynamometer<00:00:57.300> and<00:00:57.989> what

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:58.290 
biotechs isokinetic dynamometer and what

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:59.810 
biotechs isokinetic dynamometer and what
this<00:00:58.470> system<00:00:58.680> is<00:00:58.860> kind<00:00:58.980> of<00:00:59.070> unique<00:00:59.309> system<00:00:59.700> you

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
this system is kind of unique system you

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.030 
this system is kind of unique system you
can<00:00:59.969> you<00:01:00.300> can<00:01:00.480> have<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:01.200> system<00:01:01.380> pull<00:01:01.829> your

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:02.040 
can you can have the system pull your

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.210 
can you can have the system pull your
arm<00:01:02.219> down<00:01:02.460> so<00:01:03.170> we<00:01:04.170> had<00:01:04.350> it<00:01:04.530> forcefully<00:01:05.040> pull

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
arm down so we had it forcefully pull

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.680 
arm down so we had it forcefully pull
your<00:01:05.369> arm<00:01:05.489> down<00:01:05.640> your<00:01:05.700> resist<00:01:06.149> as<00:01:06.270> hard<00:01:06.479> as<00:01:06.570> you

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:06.690 
your arm down your resist as hard as you

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:08.840 
your arm down your resist as hard as you
could<00:01:06.869> and<00:01:07.140> you<00:01:07.410> do<00:01:07.590> five<00:01:07.830> sets<00:01:08.220> of<00:01:08.399> ten<00:01:08.820> of

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
could and you do five sets of ten of

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.790 
could and you do five sets of ten of
those<00:01:09.090> so<00:01:09.300> fifty<00:01:09.720> contractions<00:01:10.320> as<00:01:10.470> hard<00:01:10.680> as

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:10.800 
those so fifty contractions as hard as

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.529 
those so fifty contractions as hard as
you<00:01:10.890> could<00:01:11.100> pretty<00:01:11.670> much<00:01:11.759> guaranteed<00:01:12.360> you're

00:01:12.529 --> 00:01:12.539 
you could pretty much guaranteed you're

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:14.420 
you could pretty much guaranteed you're
going<00:01:12.720> to<00:01:12.780> be<00:01:12.869> sore<00:01:13.140> after<00:01:13.590> you<00:01:13.680> do<00:01:13.830> that<00:01:14.070> and

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
going to be sore after you do that and

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.719 
going to be sore after you do that and
so<00:01:15.180> some<00:01:15.420> of<00:01:15.539> the<00:01:15.600> markers<00:01:15.990> that<00:01:16.170> we<00:01:16.920> looked<00:01:17.520> at

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
so some of the markers that we looked at

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.600 
so some of the markers that we looked at
were<00:01:18.660> blood<00:01:19.080> markers<00:01:19.440> of<00:01:19.560> inflammation<00:01:19.649> blood

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
were blood markers of inflammation blood

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.850 
were blood markers of inflammation blood
markers<00:01:20.970> of<00:01:21.119> protein<00:01:21.600> oxidative<00:01:22.350> damage<00:01:22.500> and

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
markers of protein oxidative damage and

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.270 
markers of protein oxidative damage and
blood<00:01:23.009> markers<00:01:23.729> of<00:01:23.940> lipid<00:01:24.330> oxidative<00:01:25.050> damage

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
blood markers of lipid oxidative damage

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.949 
blood markers of lipid oxidative damage
on<00:01:26.280> top<00:01:26.550> of<00:01:26.729> that<00:01:26.850> we<00:01:27.030> looked<00:01:27.270> at<00:01:27.360> measurements

00:01:27.949 --> 00:01:27.959 
on top of that we looked at measurements

00:01:27.959 --> 00:01:30.859 
on top of that we looked at measurements
of<00:01:28.140> inflammation<00:01:28.530> and<00:01:29.100> how<00:01:29.729> strong<00:01:30.330> you<00:01:30.720> were

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
of inflammation and how strong you were

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.710 
of inflammation and how strong you were
that<00:01:31.170> is<00:01:31.319> how<00:01:31.800> hard<00:01:31.979> you<00:01:32.130> could<00:01:32.310> resist

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:32.720 
that is how hard you could resist

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.550 
that is how hard you could resist
actually<00:01:33.720> when<00:01:33.810> you<00:01:33.899> get<00:01:34.020> sore<00:01:34.259> you're<00:01:34.440> not

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
actually when you get sore you're not

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:35.960 
actually when you get sore you're not
going<00:01:34.679> to<00:01:34.740> be<00:01:34.830> able<00:01:34.950> to<00:01:35.039> resist<00:01:35.280> as<00:01:35.520> hard<00:01:35.729> and

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
going to be able to resist as hard and

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.150 
going to be able to resist as hard and
so<00:01:36.179> that<00:01:36.690> was<00:01:36.810> some<00:01:36.990> of<00:01:37.080> the<00:01:37.140> things<00:01:37.380> that<00:01:37.619> we

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:38.160 
so that was some of the things that we

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.550 
so that was some of the things that we
measured<00:01:38.550> in<00:01:38.700> this<00:01:38.849> study<00:01:39.119> so<00:01:40.110> again<00:01:40.319> we<00:01:40.440> had

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
measured in this study so again we had

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.190 
measured in this study so again we had
14<00:01:41.009> subjects<00:01:41.550> they<00:01:42.330> served<00:01:42.599> as<00:01:42.810> both<00:01:42.959> the

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
14 subjects they served as both the

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.320 
14 subjects they served as both the
placebo<00:01:43.500> group<00:01:43.679> and<00:01:44.160> roughly<00:01:44.759> a<00:01:44.789> month<00:01:45.000> later

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:45.330 
placebo group and roughly a month later

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:46.820 
placebo group and roughly a month later
they<00:01:45.539> served<00:01:45.780> as<00:01:45.959> the<00:01:46.080> treatment<00:01:46.470> group<00:01:46.619> as

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:46.830 
they served as the treatment group as

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:49.490 
they served as the treatment group as
well<00:01:47.009> and<00:01:48.000> so<00:01:48.149> that's<00:01:48.330> the<00:01:48.539> crossover<00:01:49.140> design

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
well and so that's the crossover design

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.490 
well and so that's the crossover design
and<00:01:49.920> what<00:01:50.849> we<00:01:51.000> found<00:01:51.240> was<00:01:51.840> that<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:52.259> Cherry

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
and what we found was that the Cherry

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.270 
and what we found was that the Cherry
flex<00:01:53.060> supplementation<00:01:54.349> decreased<00:01:55.349> people's

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
flex supplementation decreased people's

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.960 
flex supplementation decreased people's
perception<00:01:56.970> of<00:01:57.060> pain<00:01:57.390> that<00:01:58.200> is<00:01:58.410> there<00:01:58.849> if<00:01:59.849> we

00:01:59.960 --> 00:01:59.970 
perception of pain that is there if we

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:02.300 
perception of pain that is there if we
ask<00:02:00.149> them<00:02:00.360> to<00:02:00.509> give<00:02:00.660> a<00:02:00.690> scale<00:02:01.110> of<00:02:01.349> 0<00:02:01.619> to<00:02:01.679> 10<00:02:01.830> on

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
ask them to give a scale of 0 to 10 on

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.130 
ask them to give a scale of 0 to 10 on
how<00:02:02.550> what<00:02:03.030> level<00:02:03.300> of<00:02:03.420> pain<00:02:03.599> they<00:02:03.780> were<00:02:03.840> feeling

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
how what level of pain they were feeling

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.210 
how what level of pain they were feeling
it<00:02:04.319> was<00:02:04.410> a<00:02:04.440> little<00:02:04.770> bit<00:02:04.890> lower

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:05.220 
it was a little bit lower

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.130 
it was a little bit lower
well<00:02:05.429> significantly<00:02:06.119> lower<00:02:06.390> in<00:02:06.660> the<00:02:06.989> group

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
well significantly lower in the group

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.410 
well significantly lower in the group
that<00:02:07.170> took<00:02:07.500> Cherry<00:02:07.800> Flex<00:02:08.160> we<00:02:09.090> also<00:02:09.209> had

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
that took Cherry Flex we also had

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.820 
that took Cherry Flex we also had
something<00:02:09.630> that<00:02:09.780> we<00:02:09.989> call<00:02:10.170> a<00:02:10.200> punctuated

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
something that we call a punctuated
