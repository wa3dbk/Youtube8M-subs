law called Dennard scaling now this says

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.040 
law called Dennard scaling now this says
that<00:00:43.020> as<00:00:43.649> transistors<00:00:44.190> shrink<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.510> current

long time this held true it's sort of

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.920 
long time this held true it's sort of
like<00:00:53.399> doubling<00:00:53.850> your<00:00:53.969> income<00:00:54.180> but<00:00:54.629> you<00:00:54.690> only

loose you see electrical leaks well that

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.440 
loose you see electrical leaks well that
means<00:01:38.070> that<00:01:38.220> you<00:01:38.460> have<00:01:38.490> an<00:01:38.820> increase<00:01:38.970> in<00:01:39.299> heat

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
means that you have an increase in heat

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.899 
means that you have an increase in heat
an<00:01:39.780> increase<00:01:40.200> in<00:01:40.320> heat<00:01:40.530> means<00:01:41.189> the<00:01:41.460> chance<00:01:41.729> of

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
an increase in heat means the chance of

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.300 
an increase in heat means the chance of
a<00:01:41.970> system<00:01:42.450> failure<00:01:42.689> so<00:01:43.229> you<00:01:43.290> need<00:01:43.710> to<00:01:43.799> add<00:01:43.950> some

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
a system failure so you need to add some

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.490 
a system failure so you need to add some
form<00:01:44.579> of<00:01:44.700> cooling<00:01:45.090> element<00:01:45.450> like<00:01:45.689> a<00:01:45.899> fan<00:01:46.229> in

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
form of cooling element like a fan in

form of cooling element like a fan in
your<00:01:46.619> laptop<00:01:46.860> but<00:01:47.850> these<00:01:48.149> require<00:01:48.540> their<00:01:48.750> own

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
your laptop but these require their own

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.139 
your laptop but these require their own
power<00:01:49.170> source<00:01:49.590> which<00:01:49.950> means<00:01:50.280> that<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:50.850> price

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
power source which means that the price

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.359 
power source which means that the price
of<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:51.540> chip<00:01:51.750> goes<00:01:51.990> up<00:01:52.259> and<00:01:52.530> that<00:01:53.009> could<00:01:53.189> mean
