00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:26.570
 this toyota rap year 2014 had a 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:29.270
 loss of key the immobilizer in the 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:32.050
 we are working is this because 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:36.170
 we had to discover them behind the 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:38.780
 behind the heater still not 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:41.820
 we have prepared as you can 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:44.420
 see the immobilizer is 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.680
 we are playing 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.720
 well we are preparing ourselves since 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.110
 we are with a scanner we have our 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.110
 Interface 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:58.230
 Y 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:01:00.340
 using the stream ok program with 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:05.460
 this program 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:05.460
 we will go to locate in the immobilizer 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:13.730
 we are entering we already have a 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:16.040
 problem here of key egypt 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:18.340
 well we can remove this code from 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.340
 failure 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:25.360
 and then let's go to 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.360
 but this 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:31.880
 make a configuration for this case 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:34.219
 we will go to utilities 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.170
 and utilities let's go to the record of 

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:39.450
 keys 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:41.810
 as a city to the bird registry 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:45.009
 okay 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:49.030
 and good at this time we have this 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:49.030
 we have this here 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:55.710
 oscillating the key 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:06.990
 and a padlock is swinging and we already have 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:08.520
 all ready prepared 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.810
 we are doing the 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:15.120
 procedures to enter the key 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:18.530
 he asks us to 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.530
 we have the contact 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:29.530
 and good and in the light of the dump 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:35.010
 It has been paid 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:39.300
 or that he will pay and we now have this 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.300
 we are going to go from this one 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.310
 we will go 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.770
 to see the fault code 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:55.410
 we no longer have a fault code 

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:57.630
 let's go to the list of data 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.970
 in the list of data we will have a 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:02.250
 key programmed this beach that 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:05.030
 adapted from programming ok to vehicle and 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.030
