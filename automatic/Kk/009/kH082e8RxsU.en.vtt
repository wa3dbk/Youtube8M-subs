00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
halftime writing a last kick of the half

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.799 
halftime writing a last kick of the half
we<00:00:14.099> scored<00:00:14.340> a<00:00:14.400> great<00:00:14.519> goal<00:00:14.639> we<00:00:15.299> look<00:00:15.450> like<00:00:15.630> did

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
we scored a great goal we look like did

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.090 
we scored a great goal we look like did
we<00:00:15.839> get<00:00:16.020> the<00:00:16.139> second<00:00:16.470> one<00:00:16.500> I<00:00:16.590> think<00:00:16.680> it's<00:00:16.920> done

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
we get the second one I think it's done

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.429 
we get the second one I think it's done
and<00:00:17.130> dusted<00:00:17.400> and<00:00:17.699> it<00:00:18.480> did<00:00:18.720> it<00:00:18.840> just<00:00:19.050> give<00:00:19.199> us<00:00:19.320> a

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
and dusted and it did it just give us a

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.200 
and dusted and it did it just give us a
little<00:00:19.470> bit<00:00:19.740> of<00:00:19.859> a<00:00:19.949> downer<00:00:20.160> at<00:00:20.430> halftime<00:00:20.670> but<00:00:20.970> i

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
little bit of a downer at halftime but i

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.880 
little bit of a downer at halftime but i
thought<00:00:21.359> 2nd<00:00:21.720> off<00:00:21.840> we<00:00:22.050> would<00:00:22.260> dump<00:00:22.439> generally

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
thought 2nd off we would dump generally

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.250 
thought 2nd off we would dump generally
dominated<00:00:23.430> the<00:00:23.519> game<00:00:23.750> didn't<00:00:24.750> really<00:00:25.140> look

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
dominated the game didn't really look

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:26.779 
dominated the game didn't really look
like<00:00:25.320> we're<00:00:25.650> going<00:00:25.800> to<00:00:25.859> get<00:00:26.010> a<00:00:26.039> goal<00:00:26.310> until<00:00:26.519> the

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
like we're going to get a goal until the

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.790 
like we're going to get a goal until the
later<00:00:26.970> stages<00:00:27.390> and<00:00:27.840> i<00:00:28.080> think<00:00:28.320> someone<00:00:28.740> just

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
later stages and i think someone just

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.950 
later stages and i think someone just
said<00:00:29.099> to<00:00:29.130> me<00:00:29.310> their<00:00:29.519> overall<00:00:30.150> was<00:00:30.449> it<00:00:30.570> fair<00:00:30.840> is

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
said to me their overall was it fair is

said to me their overall was it fair is
all<00:00:31.109> probably<00:00:31.679> probably<00:00:32.009> was<00:00:32.309> you'll<00:00:33.149> know

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
that Nathan Redmond gets a bit of

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.229 
that Nathan Redmond gets a bit of
criticism<00:00:34.620> for<00:00:35.070> a<00:00:35.160> lack<00:00:35.579> of<00:00:35.610> end<00:00:35.850> product

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
died so lated the with work the ball

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.760 
died so lated the with work the ball
well<00:01:21.270> and<00:01:21.299> got<00:01:21.570> it<00:01:21.659> out<00:01:21.750> 2<00:01:21.930> 1<00:01:22.170> v1<00:01:22.320> that's<00:01:22.680> a

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
well and got it out 2 1 v1 that's a

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.320 
well and got it out 2 1 v1 that's a
dream<00:01:22.920> situation<00:01:23.520> for<00:01:23.670> a<00:01:23.729> wide<00:01:23.909> player<00:01:24.210> and

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
dream situation for a wide player and

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.179 
dream situation for a wide player and
just<00:01:24.930> wanted<00:01:25.140> him<00:01:25.229> to<00:01:25.259> get<00:01:25.439> out<00:01:25.500> that<00:01:25.799> fall<00:01:26.009> but

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
just wanted him to get out that fall but

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.260 
just wanted him to get out that fall but
more<00:01:26.369> because<00:01:26.460> he<00:01:26.640> had<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:26.759> beating<00:01:27.090> of<00:01:27.150> a

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
more because he had the beating of a

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.390 
more because he had the beating of a
Bournemouth<00:01:27.930> pack<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.380> midfield<00:01:28.740> given<00:01:29.310> the

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
Bournemouth pack the midfield given the

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.620 
Bournemouth pack the midfield given the
way<00:01:29.460> you've<00:01:29.640> started<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:30.090> season<00:01:30.270> do<00:01:30.570> you

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
way you've started the season do you

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:31.460 
way you've started the season do you
think<00:01:30.810> that's<00:01:30.960> something<00:01:31.079> you're<00:01:31.320> going<00:01:31.409> to

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
think that's something you're going to

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.140 
think that's something you're going to
have<00:01:31.530> to<00:01:31.680> get<00:01:31.770> used<00:01:31.920> to<00:01:32.100> here<00:01:32.310> yeah<00:01:32.909> probably

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
have to get used to here yeah probably

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.580 
have to get used to here yeah probably
so<00:01:33.390> but<00:01:33.780> I<00:01:33.840> thought<00:01:33.990> I<00:01:34.170> thought<00:01:34.350> again

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
so but I thought I thought again

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.620 
so but I thought I thought again
bournemouth<00:01:35.159> good<00:01:35.340> team<00:01:35.549> they<00:01:35.820> dominated<00:01:36.420> the

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
bournemouth good team they dominated the

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.469 
bournemouth good team they dominated the
ball<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:37.560> capacity<00:01:38.130> but<00:01:38.790> they<00:01:39.060> changed<00:01:39.390> the

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
ball the capacity but they changed the

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.480 
ball the capacity but they changed the
shape<00:01:39.659> obviously<00:01:40.200> which<00:01:40.860> straightaway<00:01:41.430> you

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
shape obviously which straightaway you

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:42.920 
shape obviously which straightaway you
pleased<00:01:42.030> with<00:01:42.060> that<00:01:42.240> because<00:01:42.509> they<00:01:42.750> know

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
pleased with that because they know

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.080 
pleased with that because they know
they're<00:01:43.140> not<00:01:43.590> playing<00:01:43.799> system<00:01:44.790> they've<00:01:44.939> been

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
they're not playing system they've been

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.789 
they're not playing system they've been
with<00:01:45.240> further<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:46.079> first<00:01:46.350> four<00:01:46.560> games

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
with further the first four games

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.679 
with further the first four games
probably<00:01:47.610> to<00:01:47.790> deal<00:01:47.939> with<00:01:48.090> Wes<00:01:48.240> Hoolahan<00:01:48.390> I

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
probably to deal with Wes Hoolahan I

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.170 
probably to deal with Wes Hoolahan I
would<00:01:48.899> imagine<00:01:49.490> at<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:50.640> turret<00:01:50.850> you<00:01:51.060> know

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
would imagine at the turret you know

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.810 
would imagine at the turret you know
just<00:01:51.299> behind<00:01:51.570> the<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:52.020> striker<00:01:52.320> but<00:01:52.790> yeah<00:01:53.790> I

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
just behind the the striker but yeah I

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.429 
just behind the the striker but yeah I
thought<00:01:54.149> we<00:01:54.299> dealt<00:01:54.479> really<00:01:54.899> well<00:01:55.049> with<00:01:55.229> them

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
thought we dealt really well with them

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.889 
thought we dealt really well with them
we<00:01:55.649> kept<00:01:56.100> ball<00:01:56.369> well<00:01:56.579> we<00:01:56.850> certainly<00:01:57.299> on<00:01:57.540> top<00:01:57.750> in

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
we kept ball well we certainly on top in

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.330 
we kept ball well we certainly on top in
the<00:01:57.990> second<00:01:58.320> off<00:01:58.469> he<00:01:58.619> just<00:01:58.649> waiting<00:01:59.159> for<00:01:59.310> that

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
the second off he just waiting for that

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.069 
the second off he just waiting for that
goal<00:01:59.640> to<00:01:59.820> come<00:01:59.969> I<00:02:00.000> thought<00:02:00.270> it<00:02:00.450> would<00:02:00.630> but<00:02:00.840> it

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
goal to come I thought it would but it

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.410 
goal to come I thought it would but it
didn't<00:02:01.740> and<00:02:01.890> a<00:02:02.280> little<00:02:02.549> bit<00:02:02.610> frustrated<00:02:03.240> we've
