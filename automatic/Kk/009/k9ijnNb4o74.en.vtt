00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:23.369 
it's you know as you can see that's
gonna<00:05:20.800> be<00:05:21.009> it's<00:05:21.520> it's<00:05:22.180> gonna<00:05:22.419> be<00:05:22.629> sticking<00:05:23.139> out

00:05:23.369 --> 00:05:23.379 
gonna be it's it's gonna be sticking out

00:05:23.379 --> 00:05:25.469 
gonna be it's it's gonna be sticking out
like<00:05:23.589> this<00:05:23.830> and<00:05:24.279> you're<00:05:24.490> probably<00:05:24.789> gonna<00:05:25.150> say

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:25.479 
like this and you're probably gonna say

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:28.409 
like this and you're probably gonna say
alright<00:05:25.839> so<00:05:26.650> um<00:05:27.069> try<00:05:27.669> to<00:05:27.729> keep<00:05:27.909> the<00:05:28.029> pinky<00:05:28.270> bit

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:30.300 
alright so um try to keep the pinky bit
pretty<00:05:28.689> small<00:05:29.020> and<00:05:29.349> it's<00:05:29.800> a<00:05:29.919> few<00:05:30.129> angles

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:30.310 
pretty small and it's a few angles

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:33.059 
pretty small and it's a few angles
obviously<00:05:31.300> you<00:05:31.419> don't<00:05:31.569> want<00:05:31.719> to<00:05:32.139> perform<00:05:32.650> it

00:05:33.059 --> 00:05:33.069 
obviously you don't want to perform it

00:05:33.069 --> 00:05:35.850 
obviously you don't want to perform it
on<00:05:33.250> this<00:05:33.490> angle<00:05:33.789> here<00:05:34.240> okay<00:05:34.569> or<00:05:35.259> else<00:05:35.529> they<00:05:35.710> can

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:35.860 
on this angle here okay or else they can

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:39.089 
on this angle here okay or else they can
see<00:05:36.099> that<00:05:36.250> pinky<00:05:36.610> brain<00:05:36.759> spectators<00:05:37.860> are<00:05:38.860> from

00:05:39.089 --> 00:05:39.099 
see that pinky brain spectators are from

00:05:39.099 --> 00:05:40.469 
see that pinky brain spectators are from
the<00:05:39.189> most<00:05:39.370> ideal<00:05:39.550> angle<00:05:40.029> that<00:05:40.330> you<00:05:40.449> want

00:05:40.469 --> 00:05:40.479 
the most ideal angle that you want

00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:42.629 
the most ideal angle that you want
performing<00:05:41.139> on<00:05:41.289> is<00:05:41.500> this<00:05:41.740> straight<00:05:42.099> on<00:05:42.250> angle

00:05:42.629 --> 00:05:42.639 
performing on is this straight on angle

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:46.369 
performing on is this straight on angle
here<00:05:42.969> as<00:05:43.319> you're<00:05:44.319> doing<00:05:45.219> it<00:05:45.339> like<00:05:45.490> that<00:05:45.550> okay

00:05:46.369 --> 00:05:46.379 
here as you're doing it like that okay

00:05:46.379 --> 00:05:49.079 
here as you're doing it like that okay
you<00:05:47.379> can<00:05:47.529> probably<00:05:47.740> also<00:05:48.009> do<00:05:48.279> it<00:05:48.399> like<00:05:48.550> this<00:05:48.819> if

00:05:49.079 --> 00:05:49.089 
you can probably also do it like this if

00:05:49.089 --> 00:05:50.369 
you can probably also do it like this if
you<00:05:49.240> wanted<00:05:49.479> to<00:05:49.689> you<00:05:49.899> know<00:05:49.990> if<00:05:50.080> you've<00:05:50.229> got<00:05:50.349> a

00:05:50.369 --> 00:05:50.379 
you wanted to you know if you've got a

00:05:50.379 --> 00:05:53.369 
you wanted to you know if you've got a
large<00:05:50.889> group<00:05:50.979> of<00:05:51.250> spectators<00:05:52.110> it's<00:05:53.110> also

00:05:53.369 --> 00:05:53.379 
large group of spectators it's also

00:05:53.379 --> 00:05:55.469 
large group of spectators it's also
possible<00:05:53.740> to<00:05:54.009> do<00:05:54.159> it<00:05:54.279> here<00:05:54.490> but<00:05:54.759> the<00:05:55.270> most

00:05:55.469 --> 00:05:55.479 
possible to do it here but the most

00:05:55.479 --> 00:05:58.230 
possible to do it here but the most
ideal<00:05:55.659> angle<00:05:56.199> would<00:05:56.349> be<00:05:56.500> this<00:05:57.310> alright

00:05:58.230 --> 00:05:58.240 
ideal angle would be this alright

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:02.249 
ideal angle would be this alright
ah<00:05:58.949> so<00:05:59.949> that's<00:06:00.159> it<00:06:00.370> guys<00:06:00.430> um<00:06:01.060> I<00:06:01.689> just<00:06:01.810> want<00:06:02.199> to
