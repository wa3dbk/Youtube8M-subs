00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
get any issues with it I've tried to

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.179 
get any issues with it I've tried to
keep<00:00:17.970> it<00:00:18.119> a<00:00:18.240> little<00:00:18.270> bit<00:00:18.630> quiet<00:00:18.900> and<00:00:19.189> purely

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
keep it a little bit quiet and purely

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.630 
keep it a little bit quiet and purely
because<00:00:20.539> this<00:00:21.539> is<00:00:21.689> the<00:00:21.810> one<00:00:21.930> that's<00:00:22.080> kind<00:00:22.289> of

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:22.640 
because this is the one that's kind of

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.000 
because this is the one that's kind of
being<00:00:23.640> all<00:00:24.269> around<00:00:24.539> YouTube<00:00:24.990> and<00:00:25.410> back<00:00:25.859> again

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
being all around YouTube and back again

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.800 
being all around YouTube and back again
and<00:00:27.050> it<00:00:28.050> is<00:00:28.199> a<00:00:28.230> really<00:00:28.800> cool<00:00:29.010> intro<00:00:29.670> I<00:00:29.910> guess<00:00:30.630> if

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
and it is a really cool intro I guess if

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.010 
and it is a really cool intro I guess if
you're<00:00:31.019> not<00:00:31.230> really<00:00:31.470> am<00:00:31.769> excited<00:00:32.700> or<00:00:33.329> four<00:00:33.930> the

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
you're not really am excited or four the

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.130 
you're not really am excited or four the
game<00:00:34.200> after<00:00:34.260> sort<00:00:34.860> of<00:00:34.920> watching<00:00:35.100> this<00:00:35.430> and

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:36.140 
game after sort of watching this and

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.709 
game after sort of watching this and
think<00:00:37.140> it<00:00:37.290> looks<00:00:37.440> well<00:00:38.280> I'm<00:00:39.000> no<00:00:39.210> good<00:00:39.420> then

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
think it looks well I'm no good then

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.500 
think it looks well I'm no good then
maybe<00:00:40.190> just<00:00:41.190> avoid<00:00:41.730> it<00:00:41.850> because<00:00:42.090> I<00:00:42.120> think<00:00:42.270> it

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
maybe just avoid it because I think it

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.410 
maybe just avoid it because I think it
looks<00:00:42.690> like<00:00:43.200> a<00:00:43.230> really<00:00:43.649> cool<00:00:43.950> game<00:00:44.190> from<00:00:44.850> just

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
looks like a really cool game from just

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.680 
looks like a really cool game from just
looking<00:00:45.629> at<00:00:45.870> this<00:00:46.309> it<00:00:47.309> may<00:00:47.520> not<00:00:47.640> be<00:00:47.700> your<00:00:47.879> type

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
looking at this it may not be your type

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.200 
looking at this it may not be your type
of<00:00:48.870> game<00:00:49.020> overall<00:00:49.379> but<00:00:49.710> I<00:00:50.010> think<00:00:50.879> you<00:00:51.000> should

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
of game overall but I think you should

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.740 
of game overall but I think you should
at<00:00:51.300> least<00:00:51.329> get<00:00:52.260> a<00:00:52.320> little<00:00:52.680> bit<00:00:52.800> excited<00:00:53.750> about

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
at least get a little bit excited about

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.840 
at least get a little bit excited about
the<00:00:55.079> intro<00:00:56.480> so<00:00:57.480> I'm<00:00:57.930> sure<00:00:58.320> you've<00:00:59.280> seen<00:00:59.520> and<00:00:59.730> I

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
the intro so I'm sure you've seen and I

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.130 
the intro so I'm sure you've seen and I
am<00:00:59.969> kind<00:01:00.180> of<00:01:00.329> talking<00:01:00.570> over<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:00.899> top<00:01:01.109> just

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
am kind of talking over the top just

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.830 
am kind of talking over the top just
because<00:01:01.710> I<00:01:01.800> said<00:01:01.829> I<00:01:02.250> might<00:01:03.000> guess<00:01:03.300> and<00:01:03.539> issues

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
because I said I might guess and issues

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.620 
because I said I might guess and issues
with<00:01:04.369> their<00:01:05.369> matches<00:01:06.030> and<00:01:06.210> things<00:01:06.390> like<00:01:06.570> that

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
with their matches and things like that

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.859 
with their matches and things like that
because<00:01:07.260> it<00:01:07.439> has<00:01:07.680> been<00:01:07.790> in<00:01:08.790> and<00:01:08.970> around<00:01:09.030> you<00:01:09.600> to

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
because it has been in and around you to

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:15.530 
because it has been in and around you to
them<00:01:10.020> back<00:01:10.200> again<00:01:10.549> and<00:01:13.549> yeah<00:01:14.549> really<00:01:15.090> really

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
a game players in it gets really really

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.190 
a game players in it gets really really
tough<00:01:36.420> later<00:01:36.810> on<00:01:37.020> I<00:01:37.290> haven't<00:01:38.100> explored<00:01:38.970> a<00:01:39.509> lot

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
tough later on I haven't explored a lot

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.859 
tough later on I haven't explored a lot
of<00:01:40.290> YouTube<00:01:40.829> and<00:01:41.299> with<00:01:42.299> regard<00:01:42.450> to<00:01:42.750> the

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
of YouTube and with regard to the

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.950 
of YouTube and with regard to the
gameplay<00:01:43.310> videos<00:01:44.310> and<00:01:44.509> let's<00:01:45.509> place<00:01:45.750> that

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
gameplay videos and let's place that

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.340 
gameplay videos and let's place that
sort<00:01:46.200> of<00:01:46.229> thing<00:01:46.380> I<00:01:46.890> think<00:01:47.490> there's<00:01:48.350> hundreds

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
sort of thing I think there's hundreds

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.800 
sort of thing I think there's hundreds
and<00:01:49.500> hundreds<00:01:50.040> there's<00:01:51.000> certainly<00:01:51.299> a<00:01:51.570> fair

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
and hundreds there's certainly a fair

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.929 
and hundreds there's certainly a fair
few<00:01:52.020> but<00:01:52.320> I<00:01:52.350> don't<00:01:52.770> think<00:01:52.860> this<00:01:52.979> hundreds<00:01:53.759> out

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
few but I don't think this hundreds out

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.050 
few but I don't think this hundreds out
there<00:01:54.290> so<00:01:55.290> am<00:01:55.530> I<00:01:55.770> think<00:01:56.340> a<00:01:56.399> lot<00:01:56.430> of<00:01:56.579> people<00:01:56.640> got

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
there so am I think a lot of people got

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:02.090 
there so am I think a lot of people got
it<00:01:57.320> but<00:01:59.149> maybe<00:02:00.149> not<00:02:00.329> quite<00:02:00.630> as<00:02:00.689> many<00:02:01.020> as<00:02:01.710> i

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
it but maybe not quite as many as i

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.340 
it but maybe not quite as many as i
thought<00:02:02.280> was<00:02:02.430> going<00:02:02.610> to<00:02:02.700> pick<00:02:03.060> it<00:02:03.210> up<00:02:03.299> I<00:02:03.570> kind

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
thought was going to pick it up I kind

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.469 
thought was going to pick it up I kind
of<00:02:04.500> cancelled<00:02:05.009> mine<00:02:05.189> originally<00:02:05.820> and<00:02:08.479> the

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
of cancelled mine originally and the

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.540 
of cancelled mine originally and the
reason<00:02:09.750> for<00:02:10.080> that<00:02:10.289> was<00:02:10.410> actually<00:02:10.920> because<00:02:11.400> I

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
reason for that was actually because I

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.400 
reason for that was actually because I
ordered<00:02:11.790> it<00:02:12.060> to<00:02:12.270> come<00:02:12.480> with

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
ordered it to come with

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.630 
ordered it to come with
ho<00:02:13.530> tero<00:02:13.860> non<00:02:14.520> niku<00:02:14.970> and<00:02:15.680> that<00:02:16.680> one<00:02:16.950> I<00:02:17.160> got<00:02:17.430> let

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
ho tero non niku and that one I got let

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.780 
ho tero non niku and that one I got let
down<00:02:17.670> on<00:02:18.000> badly<00:02:18.510> well<00:02:18.980> maybe<00:02:19.980> it<00:02:20.220> wasn't<00:02:20.430> the

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
down on badly well maybe it wasn't the
