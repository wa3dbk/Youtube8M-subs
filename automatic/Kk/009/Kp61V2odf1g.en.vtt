but I'm 90% confident that it's gonna

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:25.290 
but I'm 90% confident that it's gonna
lose<00:04:23.020> its<00:04:23.080> curl<00:04:23.620> pattern<00:04:24.010> very<00:04:24.310> quickly<00:04:24.610> it's

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300 
lose its curl pattern very quickly it's

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.420 
lose its curl pattern very quickly it's
gonna<00:04:25.480> turn<00:04:25.810> into<00:04:25.990> like<00:04:26.320> a<00:04:26.530> wave<00:04:26.770> or<00:04:27.160> like<00:04:27.400> a

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:27.430 
gonna turn into like a wave or like a

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:31.800 
gonna turn into like a wave or like a
larger<00:04:28.000> sized<00:04:28.840> curl<00:04:29.380> so<00:04:30.220> I<00:04:30.760> use<00:04:31.090> all<00:04:31.360> of<00:04:31.780> that

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810 
larger sized curl so I use all of that

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:33.900 
larger sized curl so I use all of that
here<00:04:32.200> you<00:04:32.320> guys<00:04:32.440> so<00:04:32.860> what<00:04:33.100> I<00:04:33.130> plan<00:04:33.400> on<00:04:33.430> doing<00:04:33.610> at

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:05.020 
in and as you can see the hair looks

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:06.780 
in and as you can see the hair looks
beautiful<00:05:05.590> it<00:05:05.830> would<00:05:05.920> always<00:05:06.220> look<00:05:06.580> beautiful

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:06.790 
beautiful it would always look beautiful

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:11.070 
beautiful it would always look beautiful
but<00:05:07.450> I<00:05:07.720> I<00:05:08.530> foresee<00:05:09.400> this<00:05:09.610> hair<00:05:09.910> being<00:05:10.750> very

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:11.080 
but I I foresee this hair being very

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:14.640 
but I I foresee this hair being very
hard<00:05:11.440> to<00:05:11.860> wash<00:05:12.280> and<00:05:12.760> detangle<00:05:13.540> in<00:05:14.080> a<00:05:14.290> week<00:05:14.470> or

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:14.650 
hard to wash and detangle in a week or

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:16.890 
hard to wash and detangle in a week or
so<00:05:14.860> what<00:05:15.070> I<00:05:15.100> would<00:05:15.220> suggest<00:05:15.430> is<00:05:16.030> that<00:05:16.510> you

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:16.900 
so what I would suggest is that you

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:18.690 
so what I would suggest is that you
don't<00:05:17.320> like<00:05:17.560> run<00:05:17.860> your<00:05:18.010> fingers<00:05:18.370> through<00:05:18.400> this

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:18.700 
don't like run your fingers through this

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:21.990 
don't like run your fingers through this
hair<00:05:18.910> at<00:05:19.150> all<00:05:19.680> just<00:05:20.680> minimize<00:05:21.130> it<00:05:21.430> as<00:05:21.610> much<00:05:21.850> as

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:22.000 
hair at all just minimize it as much as

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.750 
hair at all just minimize it as much as
you<00:05:22.030> can<00:05:22.360> and<00:05:22.690> when<00:05:23.230> you<00:05:23.380> wash<00:05:23.590> it<00:05:23.830> try<00:05:24.190> I'm

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:24.760 
you can and when you wash it try I'm

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:26.400 
you can and when you wash it try I'm
gonna<00:05:24.940> try<00:05:25.180> not<00:05:25.330> to<00:05:25.390> detangle<00:05:25.990> the<00:05:26.020> hair<00:05:26.110> I'm

if<00:05:29.110> this<00:05:29.590> was<00:05:29.770> on<00:05:29.920> my<00:05:30.070> own<00:05:30.220> head

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:30.910 
if this was on my own head

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:33.000 
if this was on my own head
I<00:05:30.940> was<00:05:31.360> just<00:05:31.510> finger<00:05:31.810> detangle<00:05:32.470> I<00:05:32.680> wouldn't

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:33.010 
I was just finger detangle I wouldn't

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:35.070 
I was just finger detangle I wouldn't
like<00:05:33.130> go<00:05:33.400> vigorously<00:05:34.090> with<00:05:34.270> a<00:05:34.300> clone<00:05:34.630> if<00:05:34.960> you

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:35.080 
like go vigorously with a clone if you

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:36.690 
like go vigorously with a clone if you
were<00:05:35.200> to<00:05:35.320> get<00:05:35.470> this<00:05:35.590> bundle<00:05:35.800> deal<00:05:36.220> without<00:05:36.490> the

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:36.700 
were to get this bundle deal without the

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:39.030 
were to get this bundle deal without the
closure<00:05:37.090> it<00:05:37.900> will<00:05:38.020> be<00:05:38.110> like<00:05:38.290> literally<00:05:38.650> a

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:39.040 
closure it will be like literally a
