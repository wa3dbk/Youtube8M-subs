00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:55.100 
past with a few important differences

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.580 
past with a few important differences
first<00:00:56.030> of<00:00:56.210> all<00:00:56.330> it<00:00:56.660> has<00:00:56.840> that<00:00:56.960> longer<00:00:57.230> scale

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:57.590 
first of all it has that longer scale

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:59.320 
first of all it has that longer scale
length<00:00:57.830> twenty-five<00:00:58.580> and<00:00:58.700> a<00:00:58.760> half<00:00:58.910> inches

length twenty-five and a half inches

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:00.880 
length twenty-five and a half inches
which<00:00:59.630> makes<00:00:59.840> a<00:00:59.930> big<00:01:00.080> difference<00:01:00.440> both<00:01:00.620> in<00:01:00.800> the

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:00.890 
which makes a big difference both in the

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:02.530 
which makes a big difference both in the
tone<00:01:01.130> and<00:01:01.430> the<00:01:01.610> feel<00:01:01.820> of<00:01:01.850> the<00:01:02.030> guitar<00:01:02.330> the

tone and the feel of the guitar the

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:04.240 
tone and the feel of the guitar the
longer<00:01:03.170> scale<00:01:03.380> length<00:01:03.620> makes<00:01:03.800> the<00:01:03.890> strings<00:01:04.130> a

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.250 
longer scale length makes the strings a

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:05.860 
longer scale length makes the strings a
bit<00:01:04.400> tighter<00:01:04.670> so<00:01:05.120> when<00:01:05.210> you're<00:01:05.330> bending<00:01:05.540> notes

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:05.870 
bit tighter so when you're bending notes

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:08.110 
bit tighter so when you're bending notes
you're<00:01:06.770> adding<00:01:07.070> vibrato<00:01:07.370> you<00:01:07.580> can<00:01:07.760> feel<00:01:07.940> that

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:08.120 
you're adding vibrato you can feel that

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:09.880 
you're adding vibrato you can feel that
slight<00:01:08.390> difference<00:01:08.420> but<00:01:09.380> it<00:01:09.470> makes<00:01:09.590> a<00:01:09.680> bigger

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.890 
slight difference but it makes a bigger

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.010
