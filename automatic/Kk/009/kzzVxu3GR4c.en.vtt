00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:05.549
 Hey, about 8 hours and welcome to a 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.529
 new personalized feedback tactic 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.340
 to twist this time it's the turn 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:13.650
 borussia dormunt let's see a tactic 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:15.540
 to make a similar style the one that is 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.630
 borussia dortmund the tactic is coming 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.460
 deepened something something right for this 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.100
 team but we're going to move the 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.430
 small details so that it fits 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.590
 better to what is the feef to training 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:31.289
 4-2-3-1 which is the one used in life 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.940
 real well lets in the ssn elements in my 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.610
 opinion the best training than the game 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.890
 We always want fast speed 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.870
 with the brooch ornament has enough 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.360
 cuts with speed which is not enough 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:46.110
 fast game speed passes 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.780
 leave them in intermediates but lower them 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:52.039
 little to 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:54.980
 so that they are more a bit more secure 

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:57.649
 the passes so that you do not lose it 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:00.440
 so much in collaborations let's leave it 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:03.489
 risky in the way they do 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:05.659
 movements to give the passes 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:06.890
 we want the forwards that the 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:09.229
 front and the half are doing 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:11.420
 quite a few unmarks and 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:13.670
 enough accelerations so you can 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:16.640
 enter passes filtered centers are 44 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:19.340
 shots in 75 we also want enough 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.470
 enough shooting opportunities and 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.940
 centers do not neglect the centers or 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.039
 let's leave them there in normal 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:29.000
 more or less because you have a good 

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:30.440
 auctioneer like waldo skiing in pressure 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.630
 the pressure we do not want it so high the 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:35.720
 that was a in 50 what we want high is 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:37.550
 aggressiveness aggressiveness does 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.899
 let your team set the style 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.960
 burussia dortmund immediately 

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:44.420
 recover the silver in the field area 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.280
 opposite but without neglecting the defense 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.630
 of ge we do not leave the pressure so high 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.820
 because if not the lofts come quite 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:52.940
 go ahead and that's not 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:54.590
 we want at all because if it's not very 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.330
 well you can defend and from and you have the 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.610
 high pressure 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:00.050
 - You will be able to defend well because you 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.240
 they're going to hit the contra pretty pretty 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:04.490
 quite so hold the against 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.229
 then we leave it at 50/50 it's fine and 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.929
 the aggression quite high so that 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:11.510
 always be two looking for the ball and 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:15.020
 so you're going to find it now we wait 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:18.350
 we put the tactic in one of the 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:20.240
 control and ready now we are going to put 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.709
 the tactics in the game we're going against the 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.180
 bayern win who also has enough 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:25.580
 good bands but they go immediately 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:28.100
 urges aggressiveness and getting 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:30.950
 by the ball getting pressure so 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.300
 automatic you do not need your good yes yes 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:36.620
 it's good that as is the landmark player 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:39.380
 but the machine with this tactic on its own 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.670
 alone puts the 2 against 1 which is quite 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:43.130
 well, to replace the ball and not 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:45.080
 you neglect the pension area does not 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:46.910
 you neglect because they keep the pressure 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.260
 low the aggressive high and pressure 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:50.390
 low is what we want to see 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:53.590
 he immediately recovered 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:57.050
 and you have players so fast that is is 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:59.780
 I'm using this tactic with the cursor 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:02.660
 actually force carrying the passes 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:05.720
 the opposite blaszszykowski melzer 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:07.700
 you have the best of the best in 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.800
 what is midfield 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.900
 here he failed her stupidly but 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:15.280
 how can you also see the way that 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:17.239
 we attack is this this with filtered passes 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.100
 ball composition also with 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:22.040
 centers wants to be a complete team 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:23.720
 again there is the aggression of see 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:27.200
 the one two three four five six 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:29.930
 players in front is what we want 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:32.209
 and late that early huÃ¡sabas to 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:33.349
 break it mentally and you will find 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:35.989
 is timely return through the 

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:37.670
 movements must by the band these 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:39.500
 risky draw you do enough 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:41.780
 collaborations to enter the 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.580
 bands so that equality that moves 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.040
 the front to look for leaks and 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:47.239
 do above or below 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:50.000
 you can also cut to the center and 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:52.940
 throw that is also what gives you climb 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.310
 read shots like peter I was pretty 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:57.349
 bad luck I could not put it but late 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:04:00.920
 that early he was going to arrive they went to some 

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:02.810
 place doing that diagonal getting in and 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:05.840
 we simply put it in the background by 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:07.220
 this goal but this is the way 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:10.480
 we want to press the 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:14.030
 recovery of the good ball from 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:16.100
 good passes filtered good possession and 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:17.930
 this is the way we want a room 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:19.639
 in borussia dortmund in football 14 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:22.250
