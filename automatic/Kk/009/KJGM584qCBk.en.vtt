later<00:02:27.939> on<00:02:28.180> the<00:02:28.510> Android<00:02:28.840> spits<00:02:29.200> a<00:02:29.379> we<00:02:29.560> were

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
later on the Android spits a we were

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:30.959 
later on the Android spits a we were
talking<00:02:29.680> about<00:02:30.040> it<00:02:30.310> and<00:02:30.459> he<00:02:30.549> brought<00:02:30.760> up<00:02:30.879> a

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:30.969 
talking about it and he brought up a

00:02:30.969 --> 00:02:32.729 
talking about it and he brought up a
good<00:02:31.090> point<00:02:31.150> too<00:02:31.540> is<00:02:31.719> the<00:02:31.870> fact<00:02:32.049> that<00:02:32.230> she

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:32.739 
good point too is the fact that she

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:35.520 
good point too is the fact that she
really<00:02:33.040> doesn't<00:02:33.219> need<00:02:33.670> to<00:02:34.060> be<00:02:34.269> all<00:02:34.569> shredded

chance that we won't little food for

00:02:51.969 --> 00:02:53.759 
chance that we won't little food for
thought<00:02:52.209> and<00:02:52.599> anyways<00:02:52.930> we<00:02:53.200> go<00:02:53.379> to<00:02:53.439> the

of<00:05:46.400> the<00:05:46.490> galaxy<00:05:46.909> so<00:05:47.180> odds<00:05:48.169> are<00:05:48.379> it's<00:05:48.500> kind<00:05:48.620> of

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:48.680 
of the galaxy so odds are it's kind of

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:51.189 
of the galaxy so odds are it's kind of
hit<00:05:48.770> the<00:05:48.860> net<00:05:49.009> first<00:05:49.310> so<00:05:49.909> if<00:05:50.509> it<00:05:50.659> hasn't<00:05:50.839> yet

00:05:51.189 --> 00:05:51.199 
hit the net first so if it hasn't yet

00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:53.140 
hit the net first so if it hasn't yet
I'm<00:05:51.979> gonna<00:05:52.069> guess<00:05:52.310> eventually<00:05:52.550> will<00:05:52.909> but<00:05:53.089> I

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:53.150 
I'm gonna guess eventually will but I

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:55.540 
I'm gonna guess eventually will but I
can't<00:05:53.750> see<00:05:53.960> it<00:05:54.050> not<00:05:54.289> hitting<00:05:54.979> the<00:05:55.099> net<00:05:55.250> first

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:55.550 
can't see it not hitting the net first

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:58.269 
can't see it not hitting the net first
because<00:05:55.909> it's<00:05:56.440> so<00:05:57.440> fucking<00:05:57.830> Internet<00:05:58.129> but
