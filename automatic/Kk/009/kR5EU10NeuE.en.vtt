00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 so great everyone today we will answer 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.290
 the most important question is what does he think 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:10.070
 vanomas about consoles 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:12.570
 Well, in short, they slucked 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:14.820
 ok it was a joke well as they say in 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.260
 every joke has a grain of truth and now 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:20.039
 the most important thing 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:22.320
 Of course to the tests of the Lord so on 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.420
 your screens are now an official test from 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.320
 Euro gamer in particular from digital 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.570
 foundry 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.000
 full test you can see on their 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.790
 channel right so take drive 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.309
 digitalfoundry so what we see in 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:40.200
 this playstation 4 dough with onions in 30 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:42.480
 fps and average only 130 and soon 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.480
 gtx 750 ti video card 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:48.450
 which is a similar setting of 40 plus 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.420
 fps in some scenes to almost 50 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:55.079
 the price of such components reaches 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:59.070
 core i3 now stands at around seven thousand 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:02.190
 rubles video card costs around 7-8 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:07.260
 thousand rubles if you consider it now 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:10.049
 Now the dollar is somewhere around 55 rubles 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:14.729
 there is a processor + and such 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:16.490
 8 gigabyte video card 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:21.630
 random access memory 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:25.130
 body hard power supply everything goes 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:28.939
 about twenty three thousand rubles 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:31.500
 23-25 ​​how much is the console now 

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:33.479
 but I think everyone knows how much it 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.180
 is from 25 and above 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:39.990
 x-box one is generally on the official 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:42.600
 the site is 32 thousand 900 rubles and what are we 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:46.610
 we see so far which is cheaper than the console 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:51.479
 next-gen console issue graphics 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:54.479
 similar to us sky genes but with large 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:58.399
 fps what can you say about it 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.399
 my result is obvious 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.130
 but 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:24.390
 in principle, continue to show this test 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.880
 I do not see the point in this way they see that FPS 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:29.190
 keeps up much higher 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.680
 than on the console version despite the fact that 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:35.490
 because which draws the same graphics 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:38.430
 cost much cheaper than the end if 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:41.340
 x-box one costs 32,900 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:43.140
 at least 23-25 ​​thousand rubles cheaper 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.690
 even playstation 4 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.670
 let alone playing on the pitch of course in the incentive 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:51.930
 much cheaper than console 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:54.300
