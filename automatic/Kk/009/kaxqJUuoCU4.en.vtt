thing you're gonna do is make sure your

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.069 
thing you're gonna do is make sure your
cyber<00:00:36.210> commander<00:00:36.690> has<00:00:36.930> its<00:00:37.230> batteries<00:00:38.960> put<00:00:39.960> in

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
cyber commander has its batteries put in

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.810 
cyber commander has its batteries put in
correctly<00:00:40.559> so<00:00:40.710> that<00:00:40.739> turns<00:00:41.100> on<00:00:41.309> if<00:00:41.550> you're<00:00:41.700> not

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
have to understand how this cyber

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.229 
have to understand how this cyber
commander<00:00:50.309> works<00:00:50.520> there's<00:00:50.730> two<00:00:50.969> joysticks

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
commander works there's two joysticks

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.100 
commander works there's two joysticks
here<00:00:51.750> they<00:00:52.379> all<00:00:52.530> go<00:00:52.649> left<00:00:53.010> up<00:00:53.309> down<00:00:53.370> right<00:00:54.270> same

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
one and you can do a flash meter with

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.660 
one and you can do a flash meter with
this<00:01:03.780> one<00:01:03.930> when<00:01:04.049> you<00:01:04.140> fire<00:01:04.379> it<00:01:04.460> but<00:01:05.460> those

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
you won't see channel one or frequency

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.709 
you won't see channel one or frequency
one<00:02:00.270> option<00:02:00.750> show<00:02:00.990> up<00:02:01.110> right<00:02:01.860> here<00:02:02.219> so<00:02:02.939> what

with the adjust button up or down keep
it<00:02:16.770> at<00:02:16.890> one<00:02:17.180> you<00:02:18.180> can<00:02:18.330> also<00:02:18.510> adjust<00:02:18.750> the

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
it at one you can also adjust the

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:22.220 
it at one you can also adjust the
frequency<00:02:19.290> to<00:02:20.250> a<00:02:20.280> different<00:02:20.820> setting<00:02:21.090> in<00:02:21.390> this

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
frequency to a different setting in this

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.410 
frequency to a different setting in this
case<00:02:22.470> keep<00:02:22.830> it<00:02:23.010> at<00:02:23.130> 1<00:02:23.430> which<00:02:23.670> is<00:02:23.850> our<00:02:24.030> default

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
case keep it at 1 which is our default

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.630 
case keep it at 1 which is our default
setting<00:02:24.540> now<00:02:25.470> you<00:02:25.530> might<00:02:25.770> be<00:02:25.800> wondering<00:02:25.920> what

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
setting now you might be wondering what

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.600 
setting now you might be wondering what
therefore<00:02:27.240> the<00:02:27.990> different<00:02:28.380> channels<00:02:28.920> is<00:02:29.220> for

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
therefore the different channels is for

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.030 
therefore the different channels is for
you<00:02:29.700> to<00:02:29.820> control<00:02:30.180> different<00:02:30.570> lights<00:02:31.040> for

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
you to control different lights for

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.620 
you to control different lights for
different<00:02:32.340> power<00:02:32.550> outputs<00:02:33.060> so<00:02:33.330> if<00:02:33.420> you<00:02:33.510> had

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
different power outputs so if you had

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.080 
different power outputs so if you had
two<00:02:33.840> Einsteins<00:02:34.410> I<00:02:34.740> would<00:02:35.250> set<00:02:35.459> one<00:02:35.610> on<00:02:35.640> channel

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
two Einsteins I would set one on channel

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.120 
two Einsteins I would set one on channel
1<00:02:36.270> and<00:02:36.450> I<00:02:36.840> would<00:02:36.990> set<00:02:37.170> another<00:02:37.380> one<00:02:37.620> at<00:02:37.770> channel

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
1 and I would set another one at channel

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:41.710 
1 and I would set another one at channel
2<00:02:38.310> the<00:02:39.180> frequency<00:02:39.840> is<00:02:40.110> meant<00:02:40.500> for<00:02:40.590> you<00:02:40.800> not<00:02:40.980> to

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
2 the frequency is meant for you not to

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.020 
2 the frequency is meant for you not to
mix<00:02:42.720> signals<00:02:43.230> with<00:02:43.920> other<00:02:44.130> cyber<00:02:44.430> commanders

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
mix signals with other cyber commanders

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.360 
mix signals with other cyber commanders
so<00:02:45.360> if<00:02:45.660> there<00:02:46.290> are<00:02:46.380> two<00:02:46.590> photographers<00:02:47.220> in<00:02:47.340> the

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
so if there are two photographers in the

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:48.949 
so if there are two photographers in the
studio<00:02:47.790> using<00:02:48.270> two<00:02:48.450> different<00:02:48.600> cyber

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
studio using two different cyber

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.350 
studio using two different cyber
commanders<00:02:49.670> photographer<00:02:50.670> a<00:02:50.820> will<00:02:51.090> be<00:02:51.209> on

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
commanders photographer a will be on

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.810 
commanders photographer a will be on
frequency<00:02:51.900> zero<00:02:52.200> one<00:02:52.410> photographer<00:02:53.220> B<00:02:53.640> will

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820 
frequency zero one photographer B will

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:54.979 
frequency zero one photographer B will
be<00:02:53.910> on<00:02:54.030> frequency<00:02:54.480> zero<00:02:54.750> two

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
be on frequency zero two

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:56.720 
be on frequency zero two
this<00:02:55.440> will<00:02:55.650> make<00:02:55.770> sure<00:02:56.070> that<00:02:56.459> the<00:02:56.550> other

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
this will make sure that the other

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.970 
this will make sure that the other
photographer<00:02:57.450> does<00:02:57.750> not<00:02:57.959> trigger<00:02:58.380> your

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
photographer does not trigger your

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.310 
photographer does not trigger your
lights<00:02:59.250> all<00:03:00.120> right<00:03:00.300> so<00:03:00.510> we<00:03:00.780> got<00:03:00.930> that<00:03:01.140> squared

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 
lights all right so we got that squared

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.320 
lights all right so we got that squared
away<00:03:01.530> once<00:03:02.400> it's<00:03:02.580> on<00:03:02.730> it's<00:03:02.940> got<00:03:03.090> all<00:03:03.180> the

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
you're gonna land in default but to

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:38.660 
you're gonna land in default but to

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:40.019 
moved left and right on this little

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:42.410 
moved left and right on this little
joystick<00:03:40.320> and<00:03:40.739> what<00:03:41.640> you'll<00:03:41.790> see<00:03:41.820> a<00:03:41.970> studio

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
joystick and what you'll see a studio

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:45.289 
joystick and what you'll see a studio
channel<00:03:42.750> and<00:03:43.590> then<00:03:43.739> I'll<00:03:43.860> say<00:03:44.010> micro<00:03:44.640> SD<00:03:45.000> card

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:45.299 
channel and then I'll say micro SD card

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:46.940 
channel and then I'll say micro SD card
we<00:03:45.540> want<00:03:45.720> to<00:03:45.810> ignore<00:03:46.019> all<00:03:46.260> of<00:03:46.290> that<00:03:46.500> stuff<00:03:46.920> so

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
we want to ignore all of that stuff so

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.490 
we want to ignore all of that stuff so
you<00:03:47.730> can<00:03:47.790> also<00:03:48.030> hold<00:03:48.360> the<00:03:48.510> joystick<00:03:49.110> and<00:03:49.320> it'll

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
you can also hold the joystick and it'll

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.170 
you can also hold the joystick and it'll
move<00:03:49.650> through<00:03:49.920> the<00:03:50.010> options<00:03:50.160> a<00:03:50.459> lot<00:03:50.579> faster

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
move through the options a lot faster

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.360 
move through the options a lot faster
and<00:03:51.329> as<00:03:51.930> you<00:03:52.049> can<00:03:52.170> see<00:03:52.230> the<00:03:52.500> SD<00:03:52.890> option<00:03:53.280> is

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
and as you can see the SD option is

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:54.590 
and as you can see the SD option is
changing<00:03:53.820> and<00:03:53.910> the<00:03:53.970> reason<00:03:54.180> why<00:03:54.239> I'm<00:03:54.329> going

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:54.600 
changing and the reason why I'm going

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:55.460 
changing and the reason why I'm going
through<00:03:54.660> this<00:03:54.900> is<00:03:55.079> that<00:03:55.230> it<00:03:55.350> could<00:03:55.410> be

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
through this is that it could be

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.800 
through this is that it could be
confusing<00:03:55.769> so<00:03:56.670> just<00:03:56.850> keep<00:03:56.970> navigating<00:03:57.660> and

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
confusing so just keep navigating and

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:00.949 
confusing so just keep navigating and
navigating<00:03:58.739> until<00:03:59.070> you<00:03:59.190> see<00:03:59.660> studio<00:04:00.660> lights

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
navigating until you see studio lights

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:04.430 
navigating until you see studio lights
so<00:04:01.769> to<00:04:02.730> be<00:04:02.850> more<00:04:02.880> specific<00:04:03.120> you<00:04:04.049> want<00:04:04.260> to<00:04:04.320> make

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
so to be more specific you want to make

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.410 
so to be more specific you want to make
sure<00:04:04.470> you<00:04:04.799> sync<00:04:05.130> the<00:04:05.280> cyber<00:04:05.549> commander<00:04:06.120> from

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420 
sure you sync the cyber commander from

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.870 
sure you sync the cyber commander from
studio<00:04:06.930> lights<00:04:07.200> but<00:04:08.190> specifically<00:04:08.760> from

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:08.880 
studio lights but specifically from

studio lights but specifically from
studio<00:04:09.329> channel<00:04:09.690> zero<00:04:10.320> one<00:04:10.560> now<00:04:11.130> to<00:04:11.190> ignore

studio channel zero one now to ignore

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:12.949
