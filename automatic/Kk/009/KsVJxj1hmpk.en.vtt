interface with traffic data the graphics

00:01:56.799 --> 00:01:59.100 
interface with traffic data the graphics
are<00:01:56.979> pretty<00:01:57.430> crisp<00:01:57.790> I<00:01:58.060> do<00:01:58.390> like<00:01:58.720> the<00:01:58.840> way<00:01:58.960> this

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 
are pretty crisp I do like the way this

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.100 
are pretty crisp I do like the way this
map<00:01:59.380> looks<00:01:59.710> you<00:02:00.549> only<00:02:00.760> get<00:02:01.060> 2d<00:02:01.479> maps<00:02:01.780> you<00:02:01.960> don't

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110 
map looks you only get 2d maps you don't

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:03.810 
map looks you only get 2d maps you don't
get<00:02:02.200> 3d<00:02:02.650> maps<00:02:02.860> and<00:02:03.130> you<00:02:03.190> do<00:02:03.340> get<00:02:03.520> sort<00:02:03.760> of

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820 
get 3d maps and you do get sort of

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:05.789 
get 3d maps and you do get sort of
rudimentary<00:02:04.540> building<00:02:05.020> data<00:02:05.200> but<00:02:05.470> it's<00:02:05.590> not

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:05.799 
rudimentary building data but it's not

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:08.009 
rudimentary building data but it's not
anything<00:02:06.010> like<00:02:06.190> you<00:02:06.850> would<00:02:07.210> see<00:02:07.420> in<00:02:07.720> an<00:02:07.840> Audi

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:08.019 
anything like you would see in an Audi

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:10.680 
anything like you would see in an Audi
but<00:02:08.349> this<00:02:08.530> is<00:02:08.709> a<00:02:08.970> $25,000<00:02:09.970> Kia<00:02:10.239> so<00:02:10.450> I<00:02:10.509> don't

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
but this is a $25,000 Kia so I don't

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.809 
but this is a $25,000 Kia so I don't
really<00:02:10.810> expect<00:02:10.989> that<00:02:11.530> now<00:02:12.250> the<00:02:12.310> navigation

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
really expect that now the navigation

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:15.570 
really expect that now the navigation
system<00:02:13.209> is<00:02:13.360> based<00:02:13.989> on<00:02:14.200> an<00:02:14.349> SD<00:02:14.709> card<00:02:14.739> the

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
system is based on an SD card the

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.240 
system is based on an SD card the
underneath<00:02:16.120> this<00:02:16.330> little<00:02:16.629> door<00:02:16.870> here<00:02:16.900> so<00:02:17.739> that

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
underneath this little door here so that

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.309 
underneath this little door here so that
flash<00:02:18.519> memory<00:02:18.909> means<00:02:19.239> that<00:02:19.540> the<00:02:19.690> map<00:02:19.900> getting

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:20.319 
flash memory means that the map getting

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:22.350 
flash memory means that the map getting
loaded<00:02:20.530> really<00:02:20.950> quickly<00:02:21.400> and<00:02:21.610> the<00:02:22.000> best<00:02:22.180> thing

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
loaded really quickly and the best thing

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:23.610 
loaded really quickly and the best thing
about<00:02:22.390> this<00:02:22.659> interface<00:02:23.080> is<00:02:23.260> that<00:02:23.290> it's<00:02:23.560> very

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
about this interface is that it's very

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.530 
about this interface is that it's very
snappy<00:02:24.220> as<00:02:24.489> you<00:02:24.610> pop<00:02:24.819> between<00:02:25.120> the<00:02:25.239> screens

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
snappy as you pop between the screens

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.899 
snappy as you pop between the screens
there's<00:02:25.750> almost<00:02:25.989> no<00:02:26.860> hesitation<00:02:27.519> the<00:02:27.760> other

00:02:27.899 --> 00:02:27.909 
there's almost no hesitation the other

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:29.670 
there's almost no hesitation the other
great<00:02:28.180> thing<00:02:28.390> about<00:02:28.420> having<00:02:28.689> UVO<00:02:29.409> and

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
great thing about having UVO and

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.770 
great thing about having UVO and
navigation<00:02:30.340> at<00:02:30.489> the<00:02:30.549> same<00:02:30.760> time<00:02:31.060> is<00:02:31.330> that<00:02:31.599> you

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
navigation at the same time is that you

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.080

feel<00:04:56.270> in<00:04:56.479> any<00:04:56.660> of<00:04:56.810> those<00:04:56.960> modes<00:04:57.350> what<00:04:57.949> the

00:04:58.029 --> 00:04:58.039 
feel in any of those modes what the

00:04:58.039 --> 00:05:00.310 
feel in any of those modes what the
system<00:04:58.370> actually<00:04:58.550> does<00:04:58.760> is<00:04:59.240> change<00:04:59.960> up<00:05:00.229> the

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:00.320 
system actually does is change up the

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:01.750 
system actually does is change up the
amount<00:05:00.560> of<00:05:00.620> assist<00:05:00.949> that<00:05:01.039> you<00:05:01.250> get<00:05:01.430> so<00:05:01.669> it's

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:01.760 
amount of assist that you get so it's

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:04.029 
amount of assist that you get so it's
you<00:05:01.820> have<00:05:01.910> to<00:05:02.000> use<00:05:02.120> less<00:05:02.389> effort<00:05:02.930> when<00:05:03.889> you're

00:05:04.029 --> 00:05:04.039 
you have to use less effort when you're

00:05:04.039 --> 00:05:06.250 
you have to use less effort when you're
in<00:05:04.220> the<00:05:04.490> comfort<00:05:05.240> mode<00:05:05.419> the<00:05:05.990> wheel<00:05:06.139> is

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:06.260 
in the comfort mode the wheel is

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:07.510 
in the comfort mode the wheel is
actually<00:05:06.500> a<00:05:06.530> lot<00:05:06.650> lighter<00:05:06.919> and<00:05:07.220> when<00:05:07.400> you're

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:07.520 
actually a lot lighter and when you're

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:11.050 
actually a lot lighter and when you're
in<00:05:07.580> sport<00:05:07.940> mode<00:05:08.000> it<00:05:08.360> weights<00:05:09.199> up<00:05:09.910> sort<00:05:10.910> of<00:05:10.940> like

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:11.060 
in sport mode it weights up sort of like

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:13.960 
in sport mode it weights up sort of like
a<00:05:11.090> simulated<00:05:11.750> a<00:05:11.840> road<00:05:12.020> feel<00:05:12.260> but<00:05:12.650> not<00:05:12.970> really

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:13.970 
a simulated a road feel but not really

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:16.390 
a simulated a road feel but not really
anything<00:05:14.449> like<00:05:14.600> the<00:05:14.900> real<00:05:15.110> thing<00:05:15.340> earlier<00:05:16.340> I

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:16.400 
anything like the real thing earlier I

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.969 
anything like the real thing earlier I
said<00:05:16.639> that<00:05:16.850> it's<00:05:16.970> got<00:05:17.260> 150<00:05:18.260> some<00:05:18.860> odd

00:05:18.969 --> 00:05:18.979 
said that it's got 150 some odd

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:20.740 
said that it's got 150 some odd
pound-feet<00:05:19.430> of<00:05:19.460> torque<00:05:19.610> 100<00:05:20.120> 70<00:05:20.449> some<00:05:20.660> odd

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:20.750 
pound-feet of torque 100 70 some odd

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:22.590 
pound-feet of torque 100 70 some odd
horsepower<00:05:21.289> but<00:05:21.560> I<00:05:21.590> didn't<00:05:21.830> feel<00:05:21.949> like<00:05:22.010> it<00:05:22.340> and

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:22.600 
horsepower but I didn't feel like it and

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.540 
horsepower but I didn't feel like it and
here's<00:05:23.600> why<00:05:23.870> the<00:05:24.800> Forte<00:05:25.130> is<00:05:25.250> actually

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:25.550 
here's why the Forte is actually

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:27.820 
here's why the Forte is actually
equipped<00:05:25.880> with<00:05:26.240> a<00:05:26.270> six-speed<00:05:27.050> automatic

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:27.830 
equipped with a six-speed automatic

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:29.589 
equipped with a six-speed automatic
transmission<00:05:27.860> and<00:05:28.669> that<00:05:28.760> kind<00:05:29.150> of<00:05:29.270> takes<00:05:29.450> a

00:05:29.589 --> 00:05:29.599 
transmission and that kind of takes a

00:05:29.599 --> 00:05:32.440 
transmission and that kind of takes a
lot<00:05:29.810> of<00:05:29.930> the<00:05:30.020> fun<00:05:30.380> out<00:05:30.680> of<00:05:31.340> that<00:05:31.669> amount<00:05:32.240> of

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:32.450 
lot of the fun out of that amount of

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:34.480 
lot of the fun out of that amount of
power<00:05:32.630> that's<00:05:33.050> advertised<00:05:33.590> on<00:05:33.830> the<00:05:33.950> page<00:05:34.160> now

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:34.490 
power that's advertised on the page now

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:36.850 
power that's advertised on the page now
it's<00:05:34.669> not<00:05:34.820> just<00:05:34.880> the<00:05:35.360> flow<00:05:35.630> shifts<00:05:36.139> kind<00:05:36.770> of

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:36.860 
it's not just the flow shifts kind of

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:39.640 
it's not just the flow shifts kind of
expect<00:05:37.310> that<00:05:37.400> from<00:05:38.150> a<00:05:38.330> slush<00:05:38.840> box<00:05:39.169> in<00:05:39.500> this

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:41.950 
expect that from a slush box in this
sort<00:05:40.010> of<00:05:40.070> class<00:05:40.340> the<00:05:41.090> problem<00:05:41.539> is<00:05:41.660> that<00:05:41.870> the

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:41.960 
sort of class the problem is that the

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:44.529 
sort of class the problem is that the
gearing<00:05:42.229> is<00:05:42.440> actually<00:05:42.830> absurdly<00:05:43.700> tall<00:05:44.180> and

00:05:44.529 --> 00:05:44.539 
gearing is actually absurdly tall and

top of this engines power band so you

00:05:52.789 --> 00:05:54.129
