than<00:03:14.320> the<00:03:14.350> golfer<00:03:14.860> and<00:03:15.160> I'm<00:03:15.340> shock<00:03:15.640> horror<00:03:15.850> but

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630

there<00:03:16.750> are<00:03:16.840> two<00:03:16.990> good<00:03:17.140> reasons<00:03:17.200> for<00:03:17.650> that

one I think the engine sound in this is

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.800 
one I think the engine sound in this is
much<00:03:21.040> much<00:03:21.250> nicer<00:03:21.310> so<00:03:21.790> you<00:03:21.910> enjoy<00:03:22.180> goofing<00:03:22.720> it

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
much much nicer so you enjoy goofing it
