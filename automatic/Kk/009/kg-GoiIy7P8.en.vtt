00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:09.780
 It is game style training 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:11.470
 In order to firmly seek out the best action to take the goal 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:17.130
 Before goal 0 a 

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:21.810
 We will do training like 2 to 1 +1 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:28.470
 I hit the ball on two of this yellow defender from Hey Mother 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:32.730
 The given defender quickly descends to where this cone is and is here 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:35.620
 It will be in the form of joining the game after touching 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:39.340
 Of course, during which time the 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:44.530
 I was hit by the hero's ball, but while I'm back here, there are two attackers 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:49.300
 It is a form that approaches the goal by taking advantage of the two-to-one numerical advantage 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:52.840
 Of course, yellow is back when it is caught by the keeper who can not take the goal 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:55.650
 It is a form that becomes a form like a loading platform 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.650
 Let's try it first 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.500
 Yes 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:11.300
 What 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:11.300
 Oh wow this is yellow now from now on blue relaping will be Nagata 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:15.270
 Ne 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:24.810
 Hey 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.840
 I can not wait 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:46.450
 It is training that continues early, but needs increase in the same way as now 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:52.990
 It was 2 to 2 to 1 +1 now, but this time 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:55.490
 by increasing the other little grid in such a way that a 3-to-2 + 1 the number of persons in the 3-to-2 Nojo year 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:58.490
 I want to do more 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:02.799
 it's ok because there are also Otsu side 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.799
 To play while taking advantage of the rules or 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.530
 Mud Muddy 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:24.190
 The idea of ​​overlapping months other than ok 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:26.790
 What it is important So I guess the tie doing but last finish 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.790
 Go back 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:45.740
 Ouchi Barbara by all means counterattack 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:46.319
 We do it from above about 2-to-1, which was carried out three simply development system Do not say 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:49.409
 Huh 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:54.930
 In the case of dita city, you can dribble yourself and shoot 

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:56.280
 A trick play that looks like a shot dribbling shot with water and a shot with only water 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:02.430
 Or combination play 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:03.719
 I can make a living, but when it comes to 3 bodies, I also make use of things like the third person's movement 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.310
 I will be able to 

00:03:03.719 --> 00:03:11.110
 Among such ideas and spaces 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:17.500
 It is a place like you want you to tie to the goal while making use of what you say 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:18.069
 The only thing we think we need to do is to take the ball off the opponent 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:23.349
 Subsequent 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:26.330
 I put the cone of attack on the corn defense side here , but I 'm sure to make it a studio 

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:30.790
 On going even doing soccer things Fu say 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:30.790
 I think that it is one of the important elements
