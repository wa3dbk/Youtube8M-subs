interesting things for you this week and
Sam<00:00:09.240> this<00:00:09.599> is<00:00:09.780> something<00:00:10.139> that<00:00:10.170> I<00:00:10.500> never

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
Sam this is something that I never

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:12.980 
Sam this is something that I never
thought<00:00:10.980> much<00:00:11.250> about<00:00:11.280> never<00:00:12.179> realized<00:00:12.719> it<00:00:12.900> and

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
thought much about never realized it and

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.900 
thought much about never realized it and
that<00:00:13.110> is<00:00:13.320> when<00:00:13.860> today's<00:00:14.160> cars<00:00:14.519> they're<00:00:14.880> all

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
that is when today's cars they're all

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.060 
that is when today's cars they're all
having<00:00:15.570> electronic<00:00:16.170> throttle<00:00:16.470> on<00:00:16.740> it<00:00:16.859> but<00:00:16.980> you

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
having electronic throttle on it but you

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.290 
having electronic throttle on it but you
know<00:00:17.190> when<00:00:17.310> you<00:00:17.369> put<00:00:17.550> your<00:00:17.640> foot<00:00:17.789> down<00:00:17.970> on<00:00:18.029> it

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
know when you put your foot down on it

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.150 
know when you put your foot down on it
it<00:00:18.930> accelerates<00:00:19.470> the<00:00:19.529> way<00:00:19.680> you<00:00:19.740> don't<00:00:19.949> think

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
it accelerates the way you don't think

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.460 
it accelerates the way you don't think
much<00:00:20.310> about<00:00:20.340> it<00:00:20.580> right<00:00:21.240> but<00:00:21.510> it's<00:00:21.869> a<00:00:21.960> computer

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
much about it right but it's a computer

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.650 
much about it right but it's a computer
control<00:00:23.189> and<00:00:23.430> how<00:00:23.519> fast<00:00:23.850> that<00:00:24.060> throttle<00:00:24.480> plate

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
control and how fast that throttle plate

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.210 
control and how fast that throttle plate
opens<00:00:24.990> with<00:00:25.109> a<00:00:25.140> DC<00:00:25.590> motor<00:00:25.769> electric

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
opens with a DC motor electric

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.730 
opens with a DC motor electric
bi-directional<00:00:27.180> motor<00:00:27.390> that<00:00:28.170> gets<00:00:28.410> a<00:00:28.500> signal

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
bi-directional motor that gets a signal

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.830 
bi-directional motor that gets a signal
from<00:00:28.949> the<00:00:29.070> throttle<00:00:29.429> position<00:00:29.519> sensor<00:00:30.269> which

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
from the throttle position sensor which

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.049 
from the throttle position sensor which
is<00:00:30.869> now<00:00:31.140> mounted<00:00:31.619> on<00:00:31.710> the<00:00:31.920> throttle<00:00:32.279> pedal<00:00:32.430> you

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
is now mounted on the throttle pedal you

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:34.729 
is now mounted on the throttle pedal you
step<00:00:33.300> down<00:00:33.329> on<00:00:33.719> it<00:00:33.809> well<00:00:33.899> as<00:00:34.020> hard<00:00:34.200> as<00:00:34.320> fast<00:00:34.559> as

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
step down on it well as hard as fast as

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.470 
step down on it well as hard as fast as
you<00:00:34.829> push<00:00:35.070> it<00:00:35.250> it<00:00:35.850> doesn't<00:00:36.000> matter<00:00:36.210> the

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
you push it it doesn't matter the

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.150 
you push it it doesn't matter the
computer<00:00:36.899> still<00:00:37.140> does<00:00:37.320> what<00:00:37.500> it<00:00:37.620> wants<00:00:37.739> to<00:00:37.980> do

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
computer still does what it wants to do

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.490 
computer still does what it wants to do
and<00:00:38.399> here's<00:00:39.300> a<00:00:39.420> great<00:00:39.629> way<00:00:39.750> to<00:00:39.780> show<00:00:40.079> how<00:00:40.230> slow

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
and here's a great way to show how slow

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.410 
and here's a great way to show how slow
that<00:00:40.530> is<00:00:40.890> exactly<00:00:41.520> this<00:00:41.640> is<00:00:41.850> normal<00:00:42.300> operation

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
that is exactly this is normal operation

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.660 
that is exactly this is normal operation
right<00:00:43.020> here<00:00:43.050> I<00:00:43.500> push<00:00:43.950> it<00:00:44.100> down<00:00:44.129> like<00:00:44.430> that<00:00:44.460> you

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
right here I push it down like that you

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.660 
right here I push it down like that you
can<00:00:44.940> see<00:00:45.059> how<00:00:45.149> long<00:00:45.390> it<00:00:45.570> takes<00:00:45.840> for<00:00:46.140> it<00:00:46.260> to

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:46.670 
can see how long it takes for it to

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.029 
can see how long it takes for it to
accelerate<00:00:47.670> right<00:00:48.480> well<00:00:49.020> we<00:00:49.230> found<00:00:49.260> a<00:00:49.649> device

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
accelerate right well we found a device

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.580 
accelerate right well we found a device
here<00:00:50.430> that<00:00:50.579> can<00:00:51.120> change<00:00:51.480> that<00:00:51.809> all<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.440> way

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
here that can change that all the way

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.369 
here that can change that all the way
around<00:00:53.010> and<00:00:53.280> that's<00:00:53.460> from<00:00:53.640> Sprint<00:00:54.000> Booster

00:00:54.369 --> 00:00:54.379 
around and that's from Sprint Booster

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:56.600 
around and that's from Sprint Booster
absolutely<00:00:55.379> and<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:55.829> Sprint<00:00:56.100> Booster<00:00:56.250> is

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
absolutely and the Sprint Booster is

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.090 
absolutely and the Sprint Booster is
really<00:00:57.090> human<00:00:57.420> stall<00:00:57.660> it<00:00:58.109> goes<00:00:58.350> in<00:00:58.590> series

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
really human stall it goes in series

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.770 
really human stall it goes in series
with<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.550> harness<00:00:59.969> coming<00:01:00.420> from<00:01:00.600> the

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
with the harness coming from the

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.660 
with the harness coming from the
computer<00:01:01.320> to<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.620> throttle<00:01:01.859> position<00:01:02.070> sensor

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
computer to the throttle position sensor

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.009 
computer to the throttle position sensor
really<00:01:03.059> does<00:01:03.210> a<00:01:03.239> great<00:01:03.480> job<00:01:03.539> I'm<00:01:03.840> gonna<00:01:03.960> go

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
really does a great job I'm gonna go

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.359 
really does a great job I'm gonna go
ahead<00:01:04.080> and<00:01:04.199> install<00:01:04.500> on<00:01:04.650> this<00:01:04.739> Camaro<00:01:05.070> well

multiple programs which you can kind of

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.389 
multiple programs which you can kind of
see<00:01:44.340> right<00:01:44.369> here<00:01:44.790> all<00:01:44.970> right<00:01:45.860> Stage<00:01:46.860> one<00:01:46.890> is

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
see right here all right Stage one is

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.190 
see right here all right Stage one is
still<00:01:47.790> gonna<00:01:47.939> be<00:01:48.030> a<00:01:48.119> progressive<00:01:48.509> opening<00:01:49.020> I

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
still gonna be a progressive opening I

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.050 
still gonna be a progressive opening I
like<00:01:49.710> that<00:01:49.979> one<00:01:50.189> that's<00:01:50.460> just<00:01:50.729> your<00:01:50.880> normal

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
like that one that's just your normal

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.999 
like that one that's just your normal
right<00:01:51.450> exactly<00:01:52.049> that's<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:52.409> factory<00:01:52.799> it's<00:01:52.950> a

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
right exactly that's the factory it's a

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.560 
right exactly that's the factory it's a
progressive<00:01:53.310> opening<00:01:53.759> it<00:01:53.850> opens<00:01:54.119> at<00:01:54.270> how<00:01:54.390> they

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
progressive opening it opens at how they

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.300 
progressive opening it opens at how they
programmed<00:01:55.049> it<00:01:55.200> look<00:01:55.350> how<00:01:55.500> long<00:01:55.710> it<00:01:55.950> takes<00:01:56.189> to

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
programmed it look how long it takes to

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.920 
programmed it look how long it takes to
do<00:01:56.490> that<00:01:56.670> when<00:01:56.820> I<00:01:56.850> slammed<00:01:57.240> the<00:01:57.329> throttle<00:01:57.780> down

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
do that when I slammed the throttle down

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.080 
do that when I slammed the throttle down
and<00:01:58.829> then<00:01:59.009> we<00:01:59.070> switch<00:01:59.280> it<00:01:59.340> over<00:01:59.520> to<00:01:59.790> the<00:01:59.880> stage

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
and then we switch it over to the stage

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.359 
and then we switch it over to the stage
one<00:02:00.299> right<00:02:00.509> here<00:02:00.810> okay<00:02:01.590> which<00:02:02.070> is<00:02:02.189> still

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
one right here okay which is still

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:03.920 
one right here okay which is still
progressive<00:02:02.850> right<00:02:03.090> but<00:02:03.360> it's<00:02:03.479> a<00:02:03.509> lot<00:02:03.689> quicker

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
progressive right but it's a lot quicker

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.109 
progressive right but it's a lot quicker
than<00:02:04.259> what<00:02:04.409> the<00:02:04.500> factory<00:02:04.860> piraju<00:02:05.130> with<00:02:05.460> yeah

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
than what the factory piraju with yeah

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:06.800 
than what the factory piraju with yeah
it<00:02:06.270> sure<00:02:06.479> is

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
it sure is

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.900 
it sure is
and<00:02:07.170> then<00:02:07.619> stage<00:02:07.979> two<00:02:08.009> is<00:02:08.489> where<00:02:08.670> the<00:02:08.729> fun

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
and then stage two is where the fun

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.510 
and then stage two is where the fun
happens<00:02:09.119> oh<00:02:09.560> look<00:02:10.560> at<00:02:10.649> that<00:02:10.679> that's<00:02:11.250> a<00:02:11.340> linear

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
happens oh look at that that's a linear

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.730 
happens oh look at that that's a linear
opening<00:02:12.060> just<00:02:12.480> like<00:02:12.720> your<00:02:13.020> cable<00:02:13.290> throught

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
opening just like your cable throught

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:14.990 
opening just like your cable throught
so<00:02:13.830> just<00:02:14.040> like<00:02:14.130> the<00:02:14.250> old<00:02:14.370> cars<00:02:14.580> when<00:02:14.790> you<00:02:14.820> push

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
so just like the old cars when you push

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.610 
so just like the old cars when you push
the<00:02:15.120> pedal<00:02:15.360> down<00:02:15.390> the<00:02:15.720> throttle<00:02:16.050> body<00:02:16.140> opens

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
the pedal down the throttle body opens

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.650 
the pedal down the throttle body opens
and<00:02:16.860> way<00:02:17.010> down<00:02:17.550> something's<00:02:18.000> gonna<00:02:18.180> happen

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
and way down something's gonna happen

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.600 
and way down something's gonna happen
that's<00:02:18.780> for<00:02:19.020> sure<00:02:19.170> in<00:02:19.350> it<00:02:19.470> I<00:02:19.680> had<00:02:20.310> no<00:02:20.460> idea

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
that's for sure in it I had no idea

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.130 
that's for sure in it I had no idea
there<00:02:20.970> was<00:02:21.060> that<00:02:21.120> much<00:02:21.420> delay<00:02:21.720> because<00:02:22.020> you

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
there was that much delay because you

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.200 
there was that much delay because you
get<00:02:22.290> used<00:02:22.560> to<00:02:22.680> it<00:02:22.800> you<00:02:23.070> know<00:02:23.220> when<00:02:23.850> you<00:02:23.940> start

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.210 
get used to it you know when you start

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:25.850 
get used to it you know when you start
out<00:02:24.390> is<00:02:24.630> no<00:02:24.870> different<00:02:25.290> when<00:02:25.410> you<00:02:25.470> get<00:02:25.560> used<00:02:25.770> to

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
out is no different when you get used to

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.830 
out is no different when you get used to
it<00:02:25.980> but<00:02:26.070> boy<00:02:26.220> you<00:02:26.280> see<00:02:26.550> that<00:02:26.790> I<00:02:27.060> can<00:02:27.450> see<00:02:27.660> how

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
it but boy you see that I can see how

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.540 
it but boy you see that I can see how
that<00:02:28.050> can<00:02:28.200> make<00:02:28.380> a<00:02:28.410> big<00:02:28.650> difference<00:02:28.680> it<00:02:29.400> is<00:02:29.520> a

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
that can make a big difference it is a

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.340 
that can make a big difference it is a
whole<00:02:29.790> different<00:02:30.090> car<00:02:30.210> off<00:02:30.360> to<00:02:30.510> install<00:02:30.810> it<00:02:30.930> so

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
think we're gonna take it out and try it

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.510 
think we're gonna take it out and try it
sounds<00:02:57.450> good<00:02:57.630> all<00:02:57.930> right<00:02:58.140> okay<00:02:58.980> so<00:02:59.010> this<00:02:59.190> is

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 
sounds good all right okay so this is

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.070 
sounds good all right okay so this is
the<00:02:59.640> wire<00:02:59.820> harness<00:03:00.270> from<00:03:00.360> the<00:03:00.450> computer<00:03:00.990> you

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
the wire harness from the computer you

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.570 
the wire harness from the computer you
can<00:03:01.230> see<00:03:01.410> it<00:03:01.500> right<00:03:01.620> here<00:03:01.680> let<00:03:02.310> me<00:03:02.370> show<00:03:02.520> you

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
can see it right here let me show you

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.250 
can see it right here let me show you
how<00:03:02.700> you<00:03:02.760> access<00:03:02.970> that<00:03:03.330> this<00:03:03.570> goes<00:03:03.780> to<00:03:03.930> the<00:03:04.020> top

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
how you access that this goes to the top

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.290 
how you access that this goes to the top
of<00:03:04.530> the<00:03:04.980> throttle<00:03:05.610> pedal<00:03:05.760> where<00:03:06.030> the<00:03:06.120> throttle

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
of the throttle pedal where the throttle

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:07.820 
of the throttle pedal where the throttle
position<00:03:06.510> sensor<00:03:07.140> is<00:03:07.260> there's<00:03:07.560> a<00:03:07.620> little

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
position sensor is there's a little

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:09.770 
position sensor is there's a little
safety<00:03:08.070> clip<00:03:08.460> that's<00:03:08.730> required<00:03:09.150> take<00:03:09.750> a

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
safety clip that's required take a

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.620 
safety clip that's required take a
little<00:03:10.020> pic<00:03:10.340> depress<00:03:11.340> this<00:03:11.520> little<00:03:11.790> tab<00:03:12.000> pull

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
little pic depress this little tab pull

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:14.210 
little pic depress this little tab pull
it<00:03:12.750> out<00:03:12.870> save<00:03:13.320> it<00:03:13.470> you<00:03:13.650> want<00:03:13.800> to<00:03:13.860> put<00:03:13.980> it<00:03:14.070> back

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
it out save it you want to put it back

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.640 
it out save it you want to put it back
it's<00:03:14.520> common<00:03:14.910> sense<00:03:15.120> and<00:03:15.390> here's<00:03:16.140> our<00:03:16.260> sprint

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
it's common sense and here's our sprint

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.170 
it's common sense and here's our sprint
booster<00:03:17.070> now<00:03:17.220> it's<00:03:17.460> programmable<00:03:17.910> we're

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
booster now it's programmable we're

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.660 
booster now it's programmable we're
gonna<00:03:18.270> leave<00:03:18.540> the<00:03:19.320> selector<00:03:20.100> switch<00:03:20.130> with<00:03:20.580> the

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
gonna leave the selector switch with the

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:22.310 
gonna leave the selector switch with the
lights<00:03:20.910> on<00:03:21.150> it<00:03:21.270> so<00:03:21.540> now<00:03:21.660> is<00:03:21.750> a<00:03:21.810> good<00:03:21.960> time<00:03:22.020> to

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
lights on it so now is a good time to

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.560 
lights on it so now is a good time to
plug<00:03:22.560> it<00:03:22.680> in<00:03:22.830> this<00:03:23.220> plugs<00:03:23.490> into<00:03:23.670> the<00:03:23.820> side<00:03:24.030> it
