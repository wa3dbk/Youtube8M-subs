 a purple onion silenced 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:03.059
 two chiles habaneros fillet two 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:07.409
 and 300 grams of grated cheese that is a 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:10.440
 cheese that is the cheese ball also that 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.450
 it's used a lot in the southeast so it's 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:15.210
 that is wonderful it gives excellent flavor 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.369
 and it combines very well with the 80,000 and 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.680
 let's start with this cochinita what 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.680
 first is here in the blender do 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:25.970
 our our achiote mind we have 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:29.220
 here cumin oregano peppers 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:31.440
 whole blacks we are going to put also 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:35.360
 here in the blender we are going to add 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:39.940
 also a little salt to this one 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:42.980
 the roasted onion let's go here to add the 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:45.190
 perfect let's also add the 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:47.120
 I stir also previously roasted 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:50.390
 slightly quemado to have 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:52.550
 good taste that also gives very very 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.130
 good taste of course of achiote 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:57.230
 ayote bars 100 grams in total 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:59.750
 let's add it and 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:01.580
 the sour orange juice in case 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:04.700
 have sour orange and that does not 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:07.130
 find then you can use the 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.410
 sweet orange and add a few drops of 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.450
 a few drops of lemon and this works 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:14.570
 pretty good or also a trickle of 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:16.360
 vinegar either works 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:18.730
 fairly good 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:22.330
 that is well seasoned, try 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:24.700
 at home before putting it here in the pot 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:27.100
 express try it out and what you are going to do 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.860
 you six sailors for two hours 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.310
 or if it can be a day before very much 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.320
 best 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.930
 remember that if it goes more well but 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:36.760
 So let's fly the liquid as it has 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.680
 capabilities to impregnate the 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.270
 meat and also the will soften it serves 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.459
 also like a marinade to soften 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:44.920
 the meat so leave it from a day 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:47.709
 before in the refrigerator covered with 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:50.200
 plastic paper the values between cold and 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:53.110
 we leave it to that it stays a good 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:55.270
 Now, if you do not have time to 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:58.030
 maynas like in this case that right now I 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:03:00.370
 I'm going to do it directly and we're going to 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:03.400
 do what I'm doing this 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:05.320
 I understand, we are going to liquify all this 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.590
 we can burn and nothing that is very rich 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:12.070
 that is well seasoned and then we go 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:14.440
 to put here in the express pot then 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:16.750
 approach here has a little water 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:19.690
 today expressed I want you to see it has a 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:22.709
 little water the express pot because 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:25.000
 yes no if not if we leave you without water 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:26.980
 then the only thing that has happened is that 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.010
 our banana leaves are going to 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:33.400
 burn we're going to put down sheets of 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:34.950
 banana on top of the water 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.940
 is 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:39.640
 a little more 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:41.910
 is on top of the little water we are going to put 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:44.590
 the banana leaves we are going to put 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:46.600
 our meat that theoretically should already 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.550
 be previously marinated lady I repeat 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:50.860
 previously marinated so very much 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:52.840
 better let's go here I just put a 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:54.270
 little bit of salt let's put our 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:57.710
 meat 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:59.610
 here inside the banana leaf 

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:03.870
 is 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:07.130
 project and let's also put now 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:10.020
 yes our our achiote mix 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:12.760
 let's cover it completely this is 

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:15.000
 a delight is a true delight 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:18.280
 to this list all the screams that 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.979
 we did here we go to put it on and 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:23.440
 let's cover with another banana leaf 

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:25.240
 that I have previously gone through the 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.610
 lumbre tells that the banana leaf that 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.320
 It's very hard for you to buy the market 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:33.310
 it's very hard then what they're going to do 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:36.160
 to soften it is to light your fire 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:38.800
 both sides and we're going to pass it like this 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:41.470
 just as it is changing from 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:43.570
 color will change color of a 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:46.330
 very dry green will happen to a green a 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:48.699
 little more on and it's going to soften it 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:52.720
 fast passes nothing more to be smooth 

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:56.590
 and we are going now like this to cover here see there 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:59.020
 we already have the pieces of meat with the 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:00.490
 gÃ¼ito of I'll cover 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:02.050
 perfectly fine with the sheet 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:04.870
 banana 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:06.920
 so that it is well wrapped and now yes 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:09.890
 We're closing 

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:13.970
 our express pot and we're going to leave it 

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:15.830
 around about 45 50 minutes later 

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:18.080
 that the valve starts to sound 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:21.080
 after we wash the person we are going to 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:23.300
 count 45 between 45 and 60 minutes 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:25.430
 approximately until the meat already 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:27.320
 be well cooked eye if you can more 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:29.450
 amount of meat will be longer 

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:31.310
 of cooking and also more liquid if not 

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:34.370
 they will respect you very much like that is 

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:36.380
 that here to light the fire and we're going 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:37.700
 direct to a commercial court sir the 

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:41.200

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:42.550
 Yucatecan cake that can not be missed

 two 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:47.050
 step by step of Yucatecan cake liquefies the 

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:48.880
 spices with salt onions 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:50.560
 garlic cloves achiote and juice 

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:52.720
 orange while in a refractory 

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:54.850
 add the meat and let it marinate for 

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:56.560
 two hours accommodates two leaves of banana 

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:58.150
 in the bottom of an express pot with a 

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:59.950
 little water places the meat and the 

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:02.200
 liquid with which it is capped with 

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:04.360
 remaining leaves let cook for 45 

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:06.340
 minutes from when it starts ringing 

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:09.040

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:11.350
 and zebra the reserve in a refractory 

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:13.000
 arrange a layer of tortillas on the

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.270
 previously mixed with the chile 

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:18.250
 Havana repeats the procedure until 

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:20.650
 finish with the ingredients finishing 

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:24.760
 with the cheese it bakes for 15 minutes or 

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:27.030
 until completely free offers 

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:27.030
