00:00:00.839 --> 00:00:02.630
 Numbers are 

00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:06.750
 I want you around today in Worms are a tough shell again 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:07.330
 down 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:11.430
 and now all eyes on the catamaran have tribal my videos as well 

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:13.179
 and entered braid 

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:16.379
 and they asked quite a lot about it and that's why I want to 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.050
 All that still has time but I think that is a very sweet Frizzo now 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:22.960
 especially in the summer and also to this whole marijuana 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.069
 Theme fits the super 

00:00:25.069 --> 00:00:27.009
 It's easy to do 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:30.229
 and that shows me today 

00:00:30.229 --> 00:00:34.940
 I have always been so on mostly the whole Icelanders since you realize their way is m70 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.250
 here a strand of compartments 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.120
 Dieterich then in two strands ORF 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.120
 about the claim about the Linterer 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.960
 Altena 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:59.400
 Father should not be running, that's because I only have the small display 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.650
 only as a mirror so space 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.650
 no wonder I do not 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.260
 so always persuade 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.260
 over there 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.040
 and a few hair dozens 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:55.870
 so that not yet i just remember the upcoming one 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.890
 Siegrist Records 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.350
 there you can have a Bobbycar race or spaces other brackets 

00:02:08.339 --> 00:02:11.339
 and stick the aspirations here 

00:02:13.169 --> 00:02:17.359
 So I used mostly no copy artist Manfred Tamm Eichen and the 

00:02:17.359 --> 00:02:19.739
 really make others really right 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:21.969
 because my hair is relative 

00:02:21.969 --> 00:02:24.969
 I'm four years old and I do not want to outdo this is not so good 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:32.099
 and so now after the full she has now had the braided 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:34.189
 pinned 

00:02:34.189 --> 00:02:37.649
 Should one need a page 

00:02:37.649 --> 00:02:40.649
 Keitel students we want to show you the life 

00:02:42.119 --> 00:02:46.169
 The so-called G6 stand the last hours standing the time 

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:56.039
 and Max has made equivalency with the pony 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:02.129
 after the left now again it is fact that it just times despite gw-keeper 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:34.749
 so turns to keep contents of the left giving Strini go no turned on 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:40.569
 Take these Striedinger that is because they have lent quoted 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:45.400
 and she advises 

00:04:46.849 --> 00:04:49.849
 in the front towards the face 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:01.319
 Here you have the second Strehlau Square I would just do that 

00:05:01.319 --> 00:05:01.800
 times 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:04.800
 very important too 

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:17.330
 okay no now LEG you the controversial is the joy strand over the 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:18.719
 rear striee 

00:05:18.719 --> 00:05:21.719
 and no one can aspire to work now 

00:05:22.569 --> 00:05:25.569
 Away from the face 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:36.159
 so instruction that you 

00:05:36.159 --> 00:05:39.620
 once almost turning to forms to the back 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:42.840
 Fritz's hair structure would be a bit like that 

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:47.930
 "If we do that without ever turning back and forth then 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:49.900
 the hair just dissolve again 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:52.900
 Haber like El Zayat 

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:57.680
 at the moment is not fixed in the harbor 

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:03.229
 Brundtland was the so-called 

00:06:03.229 --> 00:06:06.229
 The whole house looks exactly like that 

00:06:06.869 --> 00:06:09.719
 you might be unsure that i have been around here yet again 

00:06:09.719 --> 00:06:12.719
 Heinstetten man troops first leg 

00:06:14.069 --> 00:06:16.909
 Lock 1 can now also be made without a mirror 

00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:19.909
 I think it will be a bit of a student 

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:26.060
 but I just think we're demonstrating we're not meant to be safe 

00:06:27.119 --> 00:06:29.699
 all this is the Celtic hairstyle 

00:06:29.699 --> 00:06:32.729
 If I lose my step, we want the first three 

00:06:32.729 --> 00:06:34.039
 and have there 

00:06:34.039 --> 00:06:35.589
 very many 

00:06:35.589 --> 00:06:39.020
 Finally, I have really talked about them like that 

00:06:39.019 --> 00:06:42.339
 Williams did that because maybe just trying to turn animals around 

00:06:42.339 --> 00:06:45.389
 does not work so the trick is a meter wide that you first the 

00:06:45.389 --> 00:06:49.189
 single strands in one direction go out and then against this 

00:06:49.189 --> 00:06:51.699
 Direction you have the strands then 

00:06:51.699 --> 00:06:53.889
 Gilliam one 

00:06:53.889 --> 00:06:56.020
 Dokic then becomes 

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:59.729
 So of course you can also do this around here, maybe 

00:06:59.729 --> 00:07:01.369
 directly below me 

00:07:01.369 --> 00:07:05.919
 go around Zoff makes I think it's so nice while 

00:07:05.919 --> 00:07:07.659
 because you just 

00:07:07.659 --> 00:07:11.169
 this leads and handles here more on the side of Seiters and also after 

00:07:11.169 --> 00:07:14.839
 At the back of this Square, once walked around the head 

00:07:15.779 --> 00:07:18.779
 So wait for the secret of my phone number 

00:07:19.559 --> 00:07:22.239
 and I hope you liked it relocated No
