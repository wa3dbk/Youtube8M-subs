that<00:02:27.470> has<00:02:28.340> a<00:02:28.370> lot<00:02:28.610> to<00:02:28.640> do<00:02:28.879> with<00:02:29.030> the<00:02:29.180> tone<00:02:29.420> of

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
that has a lot to do with the tone of

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
the instrument in my opinion but it's

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.690 
the instrument in my opinion but it's
