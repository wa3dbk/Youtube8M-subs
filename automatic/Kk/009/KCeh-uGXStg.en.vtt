00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
here I wish they had a port for this

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.690 
here I wish they had a port for this
little<00:01:52.350> peg<00:01:52.649> right<00:01:52.799> over<00:01:53.039> here<00:01:53.250> for<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:53.520> back

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
little peg right over here for the back

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:54.800 
little peg right over here for the back
of<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:53.909> hand<00:01:54.090> so<00:01:54.210> it<00:01:54.299> looks<00:01:54.420> like<00:01:54.509> he's<00:01:54.630> kind

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
of the hand so it looks like he's kind

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.389 
of the hand so it looks like he's kind
of<00:01:54.899> shooting<00:01:55.110> his<00:01:55.380> symbiote<00:01:55.740> webbing<00:01:56.250> you

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
of shooting his symbiote webbing you

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:57.800 
of shooting his symbiote webbing you
know<00:01:56.520> but<00:01:56.789> you<00:01:56.880> can<00:01:57.000> kind<00:01:57.210> of<00:01:57.240> wedge<00:01:57.479> it<00:01:57.689> in

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
know but you can kind of wedge it in

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.719 
know but you can kind of wedge it in
there<00:01:57.869> and<00:01:58.469> I<00:01:58.740> don't<00:01:58.950> know<00:01:59.009> let's<00:01:59.430> see

kind<00:01:59.939> of<00:01:59.969> tricky<00:02:00.210> but<00:02:00.360> yeah<00:02:00.539> I<00:02:00.570> think<00:02:00.750> that

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
kind of tricky but yeah I think that

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.330 
kind of tricky but yeah I think that
looks<00:02:01.020> pretty<00:02:01.200> cool<00:02:01.530> he's<00:02:01.799> shooting<00:02:02.070> his<00:02:02.100> web

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
hidden you know I think that's pretty

cool so yeah one two three and then you
get<00:02:08.369> a<00:02:08.399> fourth<00:02:08.850> hole<00:02:09.090> right<00:02:09.269> over<00:02:09.450> there

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:09.600 
get a fourth hole right over there

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.180 
get a fourth hole right over there
another<00:02:09.810> hole<00:02:10.049> right<00:02:10.170> there<00:02:10.500> and<00:02:10.709> then

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
another hole right there and then

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.530 
another hole right there and then
another<00:02:11.400> hole<00:02:11.790> right<00:02:11.910> there<00:02:11.970> and<00:02:12.209> then<00:02:12.420> the

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
another hole right there and then the

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.420 
another hole right there and then the
last<00:02:12.690> hole<00:02:12.989> is<00:02:13.140> right<00:02:13.320> so<00:02:13.920> plugging<00:02:14.130> these<00:02:14.280> in

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
last hole is right so plugging these in

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:15.620

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
can see the Simba and round over here

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:03.280 
can see the Simba and round over here
something<00:03:02.030> at<00:03:02.239> this<00:03:02.359> hand<00:03:02.629> over<00:03:02.750> here<00:03:03.079> just

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
something at this hand over here just

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:05.140 
something at this hand over here just
just<00:03:03.500> stop<00:03:03.920> man<00:03:04.159> interchanging<00:03:04.819> these<00:03:04.940> and

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
just stop man interchanging these and

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:06.520 
just stop man interchanging these and
plugging<00:03:05.389> them<00:03:05.420> in<00:03:05.629> is<00:03:05.750> not<00:03:05.930> very<00:03:06.139> difficult

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
plugging them in is not very difficult

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:08.319 
plugging them in is not very difficult
at<00:03:06.680> all<00:03:06.709> they<00:03:07.040> just<00:03:07.250> snap<00:03:07.459> right<00:03:07.760> in<00:03:07.970> there<00:03:08.150> I

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:08.329 
at all they just snap right in there I

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:10.149 
at all they just snap right in there I
feel<00:03:08.659> like<00:03:08.690> the<00:03:08.870> hands<00:03:09.290> are<00:03:09.440> a<00:03:09.470> little<00:03:09.590> on<00:03:10.040> the

00:03:10.149 --> 00:03:10.159 
feel like the hands are a little on the

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:11.920 
feel like the hands are a little on the
loose<00:03:10.400> side<00:03:10.700> but<00:03:11.120> it<00:03:11.329> doesn't<00:03:11.599> really<00:03:11.720> bother

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
loose side but it doesn't really bother

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:13.629 
loose side but it doesn't really bother
me<00:03:12.109> one<00:03:12.470> bit<00:03:12.500> because<00:03:12.980> it<00:03:13.099> just<00:03:13.280> makes<00:03:13.459> it<00:03:13.549> a

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:13.639 
me one bit because it just makes it a

00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:15.460 
me one bit because it just makes it a
little<00:03:13.730> bit<00:03:13.909> easier<00:03:14.359> to<00:03:14.510> detach<00:03:14.900> these<00:03:15.230> and

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
little bit easier to detach these and

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:17.140 
little bit easier to detach these and
reapply<00:03:15.799> them<00:03:15.859> you<00:03:16.340> can<00:03:16.459> put<00:03:16.639> the<00:03:16.730> packs<00:03:16.939> right

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
reapply them you can put the packs right

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:18.940 
reapply them you can put the packs right
in<00:03:17.269> there<00:03:17.450> oh<00:03:17.599> yeah<00:03:17.870> takes<00:03:18.260> a<00:03:18.349> little<00:03:18.739> bit<00:03:18.859> of

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
in there oh yeah takes a little bit of

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:20.589 
in there oh yeah takes a little bit of
might<00:03:19.099> but<00:03:19.310> not<00:03:19.370> too<00:03:19.700> bad<00:03:19.879> so<00:03:20.120> the<00:03:20.209> figure<00:03:20.450> has

00:03:20.589 --> 00:03:20.599 
might but not too bad so the figure has

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:21.940 
might but not too bad so the figure has
three<00:03:20.900> different<00:03:21.109> head<00:03:21.319> scopes<00:03:21.620> this<00:03:21.799> is<00:03:21.889> the

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
three different head scopes this is the

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:23.470 
three different head scopes this is the
cletus<00:03:22.310> kasady<00:03:22.340> head<00:03:23.000> sculpt<00:03:23.329> with<00:03:23.420> the

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:47.329 
over here I didn't notice that the

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:49.270 
over here I didn't notice that the
eyebrows<00:03:47.840> were<00:03:48.109> more<00:03:48.379> of<00:03:48.470> an<00:03:48.530> orange<00:03:48.889> color<00:03:48.919> on

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 
eyebrows were more of an orange color on

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:50.830 
eyebrows were more of an orange color on
the<00:03:49.340> prototype<00:03:49.909> though<00:03:50.120> this<00:03:50.329> is<00:03:50.480> more<00:03:50.659> the

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
the prototype though this is more the

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.050 
the prototype though this is more the
same<00:03:50.989> color<00:03:51.290> as<00:03:51.560> the<00:03:51.709> carnage<00:03:52.099> red<00:03:52.370> so<00:03:52.879> that's

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:53.060 
same color as the carnage red so that's

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:54.189 
same color as the carnage red so that's
supposed<00:03:53.269> to<00:03:53.299> be<00:03:53.389> more<00:03:53.540> of<00:03:53.599> a<00:03:53.659> ginger<00:03:53.959> color

00:03:54.189 --> 00:03:54.199 
supposed to be more of a ginger color

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:55.300 
supposed to be more of a ginger color
but<00:03:54.590> not<00:03:54.709> a<00:03:54.739> big<00:03:54.919> deal

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:55.310 
but not a big deal

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:57.129 
but not a big deal
and<00:03:55.400> here's<00:03:55.699> a<00:03:55.760> classic<00:03:56.120> carnage<00:03:56.659> head<00:03:56.840> sculpt

looking too sick over here it's kind of

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:07.899 
looking too sick over here it's kind of
tricky<00:04:06.829> to<00:04:06.859> pick<00:04:07.069> up<00:04:07.190> on<00:04:07.310> the<00:04:07.400> camera<00:04:07.669> but<00:04:07.819> they

00:04:07.899 --> 00:04:07.909 
tricky to pick up on the camera but they

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:09.939 
tricky to pick up on the camera but they
did<00:04:08.120> use<00:04:08.150> a<00:04:08.389> pearlescent<00:04:08.900> white<00:04:09.169> paint<00:04:09.739> right

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:37.940 
one because it would

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:39.880 
one because it would
watch<00:04:38.030> the<00:04:38.360> pin<00:04:38.660> with<00:04:38.960> it<00:04:39.170> you<00:04:39.320> know<00:04:39.440> but<00:04:39.620> I<00:04:39.680> did

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:39.890 
watch the pin with it you know but I did

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:41.170 
watch the pin with it you know but I did
shave<00:04:40.190> this<00:04:40.340> down<00:04:40.580> a<00:04:40.610> little<00:04:40.730> bit<00:04:40.910> with<00:04:41.090> an

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:41.180 
shave this down a little bit with an

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:42.730 
shave this down a little bit with an
exacto<00:04:41.660> knife<00:04:41.870> and<00:04:42.020> now<00:04:42.170> it<00:04:42.290> doesn't<00:04:42.440> do<00:04:42.620> that

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:42.740 
exacto knife and now it doesn't do that

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:43.180 
exacto knife and now it doesn't do that

the other two head scopes I didn't have
any<00:04:44.840> problems<00:04:45.200> interchanging<00:04:45.740> at<00:04:45.830> all<00:04:45.950> now<00:04:46.250> I

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:46.280

and I feel like carnage is a bit too
tall<00:06:27.530> I<00:06:27.590> don't<00:06:27.950> think<00:06:28.130> you<00:06:28.190> should<00:06:28.220> tower<00:06:28.610> over

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:28.970 
tall I don't think you should tower over

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:30.700 
tall I don't think you should tower over
spider-man<00:06:29.480> like<00:06:29.690> this<00:06:29.870> and<00:06:30.169> here's<00:06:30.380> carnage

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:30.710 
spider-man like this and here's carnage

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:32.140 
spider-man like this and here's carnage
next<00:06:30.980> up<00:06:31.100> Popeye<00:06:31.400> over<00:06:31.700> here<00:06:31.850> we<00:06:31.970> have<00:06:32.060> the

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:32.150 
next up Popeye over here we have the

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:34.000 
next up Popeye over here we have the
Marvel<00:06:32.390> Select<00:06:32.480> venom<00:06:33.140> and<00:06:33.320> yeah<00:06:33.530> that's<00:06:33.800> the

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:34.010 
Marvel Select venom and yeah that's the

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:35.740 
Marvel Select venom and yeah that's the
biggest<00:06:34.220> downside<00:06:34.790> to<00:06:34.910> this<00:06:35.030> figure<00:06:35.360> is<00:06:35.510> the

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:35.750 
biggest downside to this figure is the

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:37.690 
biggest downside to this figure is the
scaling<00:06:36.260> carnage<00:06:36.830> should<00:06:37.070> definitely<00:06:37.550> be

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:37.700 
scaling carnage should definitely be

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:39.250 
scaling carnage should definitely be
shorter<00:06:38.060> than<00:06:38.090> venom<00:06:38.660> and<00:06:38.840> it's<00:06:38.990> the<00:06:39.140> other

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:39.260 
shorter than venom and it's the other

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:40.900 
shorter than venom and it's the other
way<00:06:39.410> around<00:06:39.440> over<00:06:40.040> here<00:06:40.400> and<00:06:40.550> then<00:06:40.640> here<00:06:40.790> use

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:40.910 
way around over here and then here use

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:42.130 
way around over here and then here use
next<00:06:41.090> to<00:06:41.210> the<00:06:41.300> Marvel<00:06:41.540> Legends<00:06:41.780> become<00:06:42.020> the

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:42.140 
next to the Marvel Legends become the

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:43.390 
next to the Marvel Legends become the
tenth<00:06:42.320> spider-man<00:06:42.680> so<00:06:42.950> the<00:06:43.040> biggest<00:06:43.190> problem

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:43.400 
tenth spider-man so the biggest problem

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:44.920 
tenth spider-man so the biggest problem
with<00:06:43.640> this<00:06:43.790> figure<00:06:43.970> is<00:06:44.120> that<00:06:44.270> it<00:06:44.419> is<00:06:44.570> out<00:06:44.780> of

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:44.930 
with this figure is that it is out of
