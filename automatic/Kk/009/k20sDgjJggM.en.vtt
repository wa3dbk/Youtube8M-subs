welcome<00:00:07.770> to<00:00:07.919> my<00:00:08.040> unboxing<00:00:08.220> your<00:00:08.670> first<00:00:08.910> look

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
welcome to my unboxing your first look

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.700 
welcome to my unboxing your first look
at<00:00:09.269> the<00:00:09.420> zotac<00:00:09.780> z<00:00:10.080> box<00:00:10.320> +<00:00:10.679> idat<00:00:11.309> this<00:00:12.059> is<00:00:12.300> a

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:12.710 
at the zotac z box + idat this is a

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:14.810 
at the zotac z box + idat this is a
creatively<00:00:13.710> color<00:00:13.950> scheme<00:00:14.309> and<00:00:14.400> see<00:00:14.549> the<00:00:14.639> blue

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
creatively color scheme and see the blue

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.200 
creatively color scheme and see the blue
ring<00:00:15.059> for<00:00:15.509> the<00:00:15.690> Intel<00:00:16.500> Atom<00:00:16.770> processor<00:00:17.210> inside

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
ring for the Intel Atom processor inside

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.740 
ring for the Intel Atom processor inside
versus<00:00:19.140> the<00:00:19.350> green<00:00:20.100> ring<00:00:20.430> on<00:00:20.670> the<00:00:20.820> ADL<00:00:21.300> four

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
versus the green ring on the ADL four

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.070 
versus the green ring on the ADL four
which<00:00:22.020> is<00:00:22.140> over<00:00:22.350> there<00:00:22.470> which<00:00:22.680> has<00:00:22.859> an<00:00:23.039> AMD<00:00:24.080> EPU

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
which is over there which has an AMD EPU

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.519 
which is over there which has an AMD EPU
inside<00:00:25.529> so<00:00:25.800> this<00:00:25.920> is<00:00:26.130> a<00:00:26.400> Adam<00:00:27.269> as<00:00:28.199> well<00:00:28.470> as

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
inside so this is a Adam as well as

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.950 
inside so this is a Adam as well as
GeForce<00:00:29.070> ion<00:00:29.580> solution<00:00:30.210> which<00:00:30.599> is<00:00:30.750> very

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
GeForce ion solution which is very

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.880 
GeForce ion solution which is very
similar<00:00:31.380> otherwise<00:00:32.309> to<00:00:32.759> the<00:00:32.969> other<00:00:33.440> mini<00:00:34.440> PC

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
similar otherwise to the other mini PC

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.680 
similar otherwise to the other mini PC
so<00:00:35.040> what<00:00:35.160> we're<00:00:35.280> going<00:00:35.399> to<00:00:35.430> do<00:00:35.610> is<00:00:35.880> on<00:00:36.059> my<00:00:36.090> NC<00:00:36.420> ox

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
so what we're going to do is on my NC ox

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.380 
so what we're going to do is on my NC ox
mci<00:00:37.350> ox<00:00:37.590> NCIX<00:00:38.219> comm<00:00:38.520> channel<00:00:38.879> we're<00:00:39.000> going<00:00:39.030> to

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
mci ox NCIX comm channel we're going to

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.299 
mci ox NCIX comm channel we're going to
take<00:00:39.570> these<00:00:39.719> guys<00:00:39.780> head-to-head<00:00:40.559> and<00:00:40.770> find

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
take these guys head-to-head and find

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.549 
take these guys head-to-head and find
out<00:00:41.489> which<00:00:41.730> one<00:00:42.000> performs<00:00:42.329> the<00:00:42.540> best<00:00:42.570> but<00:00:43.230> for

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
out which one performs the best but for

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.080 
out which one performs the best but for
now<00:00:43.649> I<00:00:43.680> still<00:00:44.129> have<00:00:44.250> to<00:00:44.370> do<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.579> unboxing<00:00:44.700> of

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
now I still have to do the unboxing of

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.060 
now I still have to do the unboxing of
this<00:00:45.210> so<00:00:45.510> there's<00:00:46.050> a<00:00:46.170> bunch<00:00:46.289> of<00:00:46.469> stuff<00:00:46.680> on<00:00:46.950> the

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
this so there's a bunch of stuff on the

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.560 
this so there's a bunch of stuff on the
outside<00:00:47.100> of<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.579> box<00:00:47.820> which<00:00:48.090> we're<00:00:48.300> basically

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
outside of the box which we're basically

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:49.910 
outside of the box which we're basically
not<00:00:48.840> going<00:00:48.870> to<00:00:49.020> concern<00:00:49.320> ourselves<00:00:49.379> with<00:00:49.710> too

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
not going to concern ourselves with too

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.549 
not going to concern ourselves with too
much<00:00:50.070> other<00:00:50.550> than<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.539> specs<00:00:51.809> so<00:00:52.020> it<00:00:52.170> uses<00:00:52.469> an

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
much other than the specs so it uses an

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.950 
much other than the specs so it uses an
Intel<00:00:52.890> Atom<00:00:53.070> D<00:00:53.430> 2700<00:00:54.329> so<00:00:54.449> this<00:00:54.600> is<00:00:54.719> a<00:00:54.750> new

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
Intel Atom D 2700 so this is a new

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.139 
Intel Atom D 2700 so this is a new
generation<00:00:55.140> dual-core<00:00:56.100> at<00:00:56.250> 2.1<00:00:56.699> 3<00:00:56.879> gigahertz

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
generation dual-core at 2.1 3 gigahertz

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.990 
generation dual-core at 2.1 3 gigahertz
with<00:00:57.780> an<00:00:57.899> Intel<00:00:58.199> nm<00:00:58.559> 10<00:00:58.800> Express<00:00:59.129> chipset<00:00:59.609> so

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
with an Intel nm 10 Express chipset so

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.970 
with an Intel nm 10 Express chipset so
that<00:01:00.120> means<00:01:00.300> this<00:01:00.420> is<00:01:00.570> an<00:01:00.690> older<00:01:01.079> class<00:01:01.350> GPU<00:01:01.859> at

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
that means this is an older class GPU at

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.050 
that means this is an older class GPU at

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
are available as a completed PC so that

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.249 
are available as a completed PC so that
is<00:01:13.950> one<00:01:14.130> with<00:01:14.340> memory<00:01:14.820> and<00:01:14.850> with<00:01:15.450> a<00:01:15.479> drive<00:01:15.840> or

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
is one with memory and with a drive or

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.170 
is one with memory and with a drive or
as<00:01:16.799> a<00:01:16.830> bare-bones<00:01:17.280> so<00:01:17.490> you<00:01:17.549> can<00:01:17.790> buy<00:01:17.909> this<00:01:17.970> I

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
as a bare-bones so you can buy this I

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.179 
as a bare-bones so you can buy this I
bare-bones<00:01:18.570> put<00:01:18.840> an<00:01:18.930> SSD<00:01:19.259> in<00:01:19.590> there<00:01:19.799> you<00:01:20.070> know

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
bare-bones put an SSD in there you know

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.120 
bare-bones put an SSD in there you know
throw<00:01:20.549> a<00:01:20.850> bunch<00:01:21.420> of<00:01:21.570> RAM<00:01:21.810> in<00:01:22.049> there<00:01:22.259> I<00:01:22.799> think

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
throw a bunch of RAM in there I think

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.249 
throw a bunch of RAM in there I think
it's<00:01:23.220> got<00:01:23.369> two<00:01:23.700> slots<00:01:24.600> so<00:01:24.810> you<00:01:24.900> should<00:01:25.049> be<00:01:25.140> able

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
it's got two slots so you should be able

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.219 
it's got two slots so you should be able
to<00:01:25.320> put<00:01:25.439> up<00:01:25.530> to<00:01:25.759> eight<00:01:26.759> gigs<00:01:27.210> of<00:01:27.330> memory<00:01:27.509> yes<00:01:28.020> so

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
to put up to eight gigs of memory yes so

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.630 
to put up to eight gigs of memory yes so
you<00:01:28.290> can<00:01:28.500> do<00:01:28.590> up<00:01:28.680> to<00:01:28.710> 8<00:01:28.920> gigs<00:01:29.189> of<00:01:29.340> memory<00:01:29.369> in

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
you can do up to 8 gigs of memory in

well and intakes on the bottom once
again<00:05:12.000> heat<00:05:12.240> rises<00:05:12.690> etc<00:05:13.320> and<00:05:13.500> that<00:05:14.010> is<00:05:14.160> a<00:05:14.190> good

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:14.400 
again heat rises etc and that is a good

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.180 
again heat rises etc and that is a good
place<00:05:14.580> for<00:05:14.820> those<00:05:15.000> as<00:05:15.270> well<00:05:16.040> one<00:05:17.040> of<00:05:17.130> the

not come with an OS so you will have to

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:57.170 
not come with an OS so you will have to
procure<00:05:56.190> an<00:05:56.310> OS<00:05:56.580> whether<00:05:56.820> it's<00:05:56.970> when<00:05:57.090> you

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:57.180 
procure an OS whether it's when you

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:58.430 
procure an OS whether it's when you
already<00:05:57.420> have<00:05:57.600> or<00:05:57.750> whether<00:05:57.870> you<00:05:58.020> violent<00:05:58.380> in

00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:58.440 
already have or whether you violent in

already have or whether you violent in
place<00:05:58.650> like<00:05:58.860> say<00:05:59.040> for<00:05:59.100> example<00:05:59.220> NCIX

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:00.270 
place like say for example NCIX

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:04.400 
place like say for example NCIX
and<00:06:00.420> you<00:06:00.930> can<00:06:01.080> install<00:06:01.380> it<00:06:01.640> yourself<00:06:02.640> or<00:06:03.410> you

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:04.410 
and you can install it yourself or you

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:05.720 
and you can install it yourself or you
could<00:06:04.710> pay<00:06:04.800> a<00:06:04.830> technician<00:06:05.190> to<00:06:05.370> do<00:06:05.460> it<00:06:05.580> but<00:06:05.700> I

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:05.730 
could pay a technician to do it but I

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:07.250 
could pay a technician to do it but I
would<00:06:05.820> recommend<00:06:06.000> installing<00:06:06.540> yourself<00:06:06.990> it's

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:07.260 
would recommend installing yourself it's

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:10.220 
would recommend installing yourself it's
not<00:06:07.470> that<00:06:07.680> hard<00:06:07.950> and<00:06:08.880> I'm<00:06:09.420> gonna<00:06:09.540> try<00:06:09.870> and<00:06:09.930> put

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:10.230 
not that hard and I'm gonna try and put

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:12.860 
not that hard and I'm gonna try and put
this<00:06:10.410> Wi-Fi<00:06:11.370> antenna<00:06:11.550> on<00:06:11.880> here<00:06:12.210> I'm<00:06:12.420> trying

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:12.870 
this Wi-Fi antenna on here I'm trying

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:13.730 
this Wi-Fi antenna on here I'm trying
here<00:06:13.050> there<00:06:13.350> we<00:06:13.440> go

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:13.740 
here there we go

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:18.800 
here there we go
BAM<00:06:15.920> there<00:06:16.920> we<00:06:17.070> go<00:06:17.160> we've<00:06:17.670> also<00:06:17.850> got<00:06:18.120> two<00:06:18.330> USB

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:18.810 
BAM there we go we've also got two USB

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:20.960 
BAM there we go we've also got two USB
3.0<00:06:19.350> SuperSpeed<00:06:19.860> ports<00:06:20.130> on<00:06:20.250> the<00:06:20.340> back<00:06:20.490> two

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:20.970 
3.0 SuperSpeed ports on the back two

3.0 SuperSpeed ports on the back two
more<00:06:21.180> USB<00:06:21.300> 2.0<00:06:22.020> ports<00:06:22.290> so<00:06:22.410> that<00:06:22.530> is<00:06:22.650> a<00:06:22.680> total<00:06:22.950> of

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:23.010 
more USB 2.0 ports so that is a total of

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:26.330 
more USB 2.0 ports so that is a total of
six<00:06:23.400> USB<00:06:23.910> ports<00:06:24.390> one<00:06:25.080> Gigabit<00:06:25.470> Ethernet<00:06:25.530> DVI

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:30.780 
HDMI optical audio and power in so that

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:35.659 
HDMI optical audio and power in so that
is<00:06:31.050> a<00:06:31.080> pretty<00:06:31.440> full<00:06:31.920> complement<00:06:32.580> of

00:06:35.659 --> 00:06:35.669 

00:06:35.669 --> 00:06:41.420 

oh<00:06:37.999> okay<00:06:39.030> cooling<00:06:39.719> time<00:06:39.900> so<00:06:40.620> there<00:06:40.830> is<00:06:41.099> the

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:41.430 
oh okay cooling time so there is the

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:44.119 
oh okay cooling time so there is the
cooling<00:06:41.759> fan<00:06:41.969> for<00:06:42.270> the<00:06:42.300> actual<00:06:43.009> where<00:06:44.009> the

00:06:44.119 --> 00:06:44.129 
cooling fan for the actual where the

00:06:44.129 --> 00:06:45.649 
cooling fan for the actual where the
bulk<00:06:44.340> of<00:06:44.460> the<00:06:44.610> processing<00:06:45.150> is<00:06:45.240> going<00:06:45.270> on

00:06:45.649 --> 00:06:45.659 
bulk of the processing is going on

00:06:45.659 --> 00:06:47.929 
bulk of the processing is going on
inside<00:06:45.990> so<00:06:46.529> you've<00:06:46.949> got<00:06:47.159> your<00:06:47.310> intake<00:06:47.610> here

00:06:47.929 --> 00:06:47.939 
inside so you've got your intake here

00:06:47.939 --> 00:06:50.659 
inside so you've got your intake here
you've<00:06:48.389> got<00:06:48.599> an<00:06:48.779> intake<00:06:49.229> here<00:06:49.620> and<00:06:49.770> then<00:06:50.159> the

00:06:50.659 --> 00:06:50.669 
you've got an intake here and then the

00:06:50.669 --> 00:06:52.999 
you've got an intake here and then the
exhaust<00:06:51.240> is<00:06:51.509> going<00:06:51.779> to<00:06:51.930> be<00:06:52.050> predominantly<00:06:52.710> up

00:06:52.999 --> 00:06:53.009 
exhaust is going to be predominantly up

00:06:53.009 --> 00:06:54.469 
exhaust is going to be predominantly up
here<00:06:53.400> so<00:06:53.759> I<00:06:53.789> think<00:06:53.879> that<00:06:54.090> pretty<00:06:54.270> much<00:06:54.360> covers

00:06:54.469 --> 00:06:54.479 
here so I think that pretty much covers

00:06:54.479 --> 00:06:56.269 
here so I think that pretty much covers
