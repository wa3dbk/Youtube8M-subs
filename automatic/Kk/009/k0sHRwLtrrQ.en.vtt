 makeup makeup for glasses for us from 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.250
 bespectacled I really like to wear glasses they 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.970
 I like it but when you wear glasses 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:20.970
 lift your eyes slightly lost and therefore 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.400

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.109
 just seen enough court if you too 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.180
 love to wear glasses don't know which 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.519
 make up please see this 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.619
 video and do this makeup places with 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.780
 me as always start with the fact that 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.540
 align the complexion for this i put 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.760
 tonal basis further I leveled 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.030
 some flaws there hiding bruises 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.920
 under the eyes and put 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:46.730
 pearl almost transparent slightly 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.629
 beige shade on eyelids 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.250
 virtually all makeup we will 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.199
 carry with black pencil 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.360
 pencil must wash well 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.280
 sharpen this pencil just 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:00.059
 draw the upper line of growth 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:03.170
 eyelashes starting from the middle of the eye and go 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.170
 to external tick 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.189
 the principle is the difference between the eyes 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.189
 he is the same 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.960
 Once again, it turned out very wide 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:31.020
 arrows that are rounded and highlighted 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:34.460
 Eyes to steal men pencil pencil 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.460
 lower lash line 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.820
 among them eyes on the tip 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.820
 it was 2 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.869
 further so that our arrows do not 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:53.650
 remained so clear see just 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:56.080
 any of your favorite hands are grayish 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:58.090
 or a brownish shade i'm gonna take 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.070
 here are such chocolate and we need 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.909
 slightly shade the line that 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:02.909
 drew themselves 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.390
 Further we draw the same shadows. 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:48.650
 the crease of the upper eyelid so that our eyes 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.650
 didn't seem so flat 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:19.340
 further white pencil sum 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.340
 water line 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:30.190
 and carefully painted our eyelashes 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:32.320
 try to envy paint as if 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:34.200
 upstairs because if you will paint 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:38.430
 length will not necessarily wear glasses 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.430
 at least me always 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:55.770
 The following and such necessarily issue 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:57.750
 beautiful your eyebrows business no eyebrows 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:58.220
 decorated therefore mandatory necessary 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:01.080
 the entrance 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:05.090
 I always use 2 main ones for this 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:05.090
 means first this here for eyebrows 

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:12.420
 she means this topic 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:32.630
 immediately different as i am then 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:32.630
 army and this broadcast 

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:45.350
 that's basically just for her eyes 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:47.660
 become much more rounded and how 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:50.470
 would have isolated strongly on the face so when 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:50.470
 wear glasses 

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:11.000
 our makeup is ready on this principle all 

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:13.070
 nothing we did not use in 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.940
 Essentially, there are not many products
