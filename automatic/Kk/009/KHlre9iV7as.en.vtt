for just of this wash so that's when

for just of this wash so that's when
this<00:00:25.590> recently<00:00:26.340> I<00:00:26.369> decided<00:00:26.670> to<00:00:26.970> look<00:00:27.060> for

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
this recently I decided to look for

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.960 
this recently I decided to look for
something<00:00:27.420> that's<00:00:27.570> cheaper<00:00:28.260> though<00:00:29.130> that<00:00:29.460> 400

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
something that's cheaper though that 400

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.190 
something that's cheaper though that 400
be<00:00:30.840> face<00:00:31.080> wash<00:00:31.410> lasted<00:00:32.040> much<00:00:32.279> longer<00:00:32.630> but<00:00:33.630> just

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
be face wash lasted much longer but just

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.750 
be face wash lasted much longer but just
the<00:00:34.380> perception<00:00:34.710> so<00:00:35.070> I<00:00:35.130> thought<00:00:35.340> let<00:00:35.489> me<00:00:35.520> pick

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
the perception so I thought let me pick

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.580 
the perception so I thought let me pick
up<00:00:35.910> something<00:00:36.270> is<00:00:36.450> cheaper<00:00:36.809> than<00:00:36.840> that<00:00:37.230> so<00:00:37.559> I

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
up something is cheaper than that so I

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.920 
up something is cheaper than that so I
picked<00:00:37.890> up<00:00:38.040> emolia's<00:00:38.550> oil-control<00:00:39.090> face<00:00:39.629> wash

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
which said that though it's going to be

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.229
