00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 
going it really becomes frantic fun I

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.080 
going it really becomes frantic fun I
know<00:01:39.740> this<00:01:39.979> is<00:01:40.069> pretty<00:01:40.220> similar<00:01:40.459> to<00:01:40.580> hot<00:01:40.849> rope

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
know this is pretty similar to hot rope

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.589 
know this is pretty similar to hot rope
jump

00:01:41.589 --> 00:01:41.599 
jump

00:01:41.599 --> 00:01:43.210 
jump
but<00:01:41.810> there<00:01:41.959> is<00:01:42.050> one<00:01:42.080> enormous<00:01:42.649> difference

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.220 
but there is one enormous difference

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.339 
but there is one enormous difference
between<00:01:43.550> these<00:01:43.670> two<00:01:43.880> games<00:01:44.119> a<00:01:44.420> hot<00:01:45.080> rope<00:01:45.319> jump

00:01:45.339 --> 00:01:45.349 
between these two games a hot rope jump

00:01:45.349 --> 00:01:47.919 
between these two games a hot rope jump
you're<00:01:46.190> jumping<00:01:46.610> over<00:01:46.700> a<00:01:46.849> flaming<00:01:47.239> jump<00:01:47.660> rope

00:01:47.919 --> 00:01:47.929 
you're jumping over a flaming jump rope

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:50.350 
you're jumping over a flaming jump rope
while<00:01:48.229> in<00:01:48.440> this<00:01:48.649> game<00:01:48.920> you're<00:01:49.520> clearly<00:01:50.090> on<00:01:50.239> a

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
while in this game you're clearly on a

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.809 
while in this game you're clearly on a
clock<00:01:50.750> jumping<00:01:51.259> over<00:01:51.470> the<00:01:51.560> hands<00:01:51.950> it's<00:01:52.459> a<00:01:52.580> key

00:01:52.809 --> 00:01:52.819 
clock jumping over the hands it's a key

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:55.419 
clock jumping over the hands it's a key
difference<00:01:53.209> I<00:01:53.539> guess<00:01:54.440> my<00:01:54.709> only<00:01:54.890> complaint<00:01:55.190> is

00:01:55.419 --> 00:01:55.429 
difference I guess my only complaint is

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:56.710 
difference I guess my only complaint is
that<00:01:55.459> they<00:01:55.670> didn't<00:01:55.910> make<00:01:56.000> it<00:01:56.060> a<00:01:56.209> four<00:01:56.509> player

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:56.720 
that they didn't make it a four player

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.809 
that they didn't make it a four player
game<00:01:56.810> it's<00:01:57.319> a<00:01:57.470> dual<00:01:57.679> game<00:01:58.009> so<00:01:58.310> you<00:01:58.369> can<00:01:58.550> only<00:01:58.670> do

00:01:58.809 --> 00:01:58.819 
game it's a dual game so you can only do

00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:01.419 
game it's a dual game so you can only do
two<00:01:58.970> players<00:01:59.300> the<00:01:59.959> Super<00:02:00.229> Mario<00:02:00.440> 64<00:02:00.649> reference
