00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 hello friends today I bring you a trick of 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:06.680
 magic called sherlock holmes for it 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.450
 let's extract a card from the deck 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:11.670
 can be any letter although all 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.410
 the magicians or most of them use 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.080
 the joker I in this case I do not have 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:19.650
 him but we can use any letter 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.660
 the result is the same we place it in 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.359
 second position of the deck watching the 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:27.390
 back letters putting a letter to 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.130
 anyone on top of it well and so on 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.240
 we have our deck ready for the 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.700
 trick 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:36.780
 we will start our trick by extracting the 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:38.820
 Shuffle from our bag or case and 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.469
 we'll start talking to the viewer 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.809
 that home was a great detective 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.149
 all this is to confuse what 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:48.149
 with the left hand we are going to make a 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.430
 move we tip the deck a little 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.680
 in this way and we are going to press with 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.590
 the thumb this corner of such 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.329
 way that we release two letters there 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.480
 released one 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.670
 the other is very important to practice this 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.939
 movement do not worry you do not see anymore 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.600
 that the deck is like this we take 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.060
 the two letters 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.970
 and let go of the thumb so that the 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.920
 shuffle take your normal state we tell you 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:18.700
 to the viewer that this letter is called 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:20.590
 sherlock holmes the great detective 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:24.520
 we take it this way that actually 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:26.469
 we have two cards okay now what 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.649
 we will do is place it in the part 

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:28.649
 higher 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.610
 and we will start by telling the viewer 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:36.790
 that we assure him that if he took one 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:39.520
 card of the deck the great detective what 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:40.619
 you will find all this is also for 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.970
 mislead 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.520
 later we pull the first card 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:47.680
 from the deck telling him to be home 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.799
 that we really know that 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:52.780
 it is what we put on the table and 

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:55.479
 we make a mix by drag that 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:58.050
 is to pull the first card and all the 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:02.330
 others above 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:02.330
 now we pull all the cards 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.980
 and when we get to the end we peel a 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.110
 to a 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:11.010
 in this way we have the letter of 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:14.190
 Sherlock Holmes in first position 

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:16.930
 again despite making a mixture 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:19.890
 we will tell the viewer that we are going to 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.720
 throw letters on the table 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:26.390
 in such a way that he tells us where 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:28.760
 stop we start throwing letters 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:33.170
 and suppose he tells us to stop in 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:36.709
 this point that I observed this letter 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:40.310
 what is the 8 of hearts we teach it 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:43.940
 well since he has seen it we put it 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:46.480
 again on the deck and we raise 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:49.640
 the pile that is on the table 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:51.980
 putting it on top that 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:55.069
 we have achieved with this that the letter 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:57.120
 do it home go over the letter of 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:03:02.560
 viewer 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:04.720
 we proceed to make some cuts and mix 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.390
 and then we ask the 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:09.970
 spectator or ourselves what we can 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:12.790
 have the letter introduced by 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:15.190
 any point in the deck telling him 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:18.860
 that we are sure that this letter is going to 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:22.010
 find your letter well 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:23.690
 we cut and complete again and we 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:26.810
 we deliver the deck the spectator 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:29.630
 asking him to cut and complete one 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:31.970
 Once all this is done, proceed to look 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:36.710
 the letter be 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:38.450
 and his letter and automatically he will see that 

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:41.570
