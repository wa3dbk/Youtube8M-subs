like<00:00:42.899> 20<00:00:43.290> minutes<00:00:43.469> I<00:00:43.680> think<00:00:44.100> Utah<00:00:44.430> goes<00:00:44.670> in<00:00:44.820> and

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.639 
like 20 minutes I think Utah goes in and
wins<00:00:45.149> which<00:00:45.570> means<00:00:45.600> all<00:00:46.050> the<00:00:46.230> pressure<00:00:46.500> shifts

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649
