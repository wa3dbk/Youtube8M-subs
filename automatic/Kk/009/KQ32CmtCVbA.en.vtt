00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
to the stand as far as extra weight

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.050 
to the stand as far as extra weight
because<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.590> stand<00:01:10.830> weighs<00:01:11.040> around<00:01:11.189> 11<00:01:11.880> and<00:01:12.030> a

tree but you can put this on multiple
trees<00:01:21.420> and<00:01:21.689> then<00:01:21.780> just<00:01:21.960> hang<00:01:22.110> your<00:01:22.140> stand

hook<00:03:57.239> to<00:03:57.420> those<00:03:57.600> you<00:03:58.410> can<00:03:58.560> get<00:03:58.739> this<00:03:58.920> stand

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
hook to those you can get this stand

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.910 
hook to those you can get this stand
really<00:03:59.610> tight<00:03:59.850> up<00:04:00.000> to<00:04:00.150> the<00:04:00.269> tree<00:04:00.510> so<00:04:00.720> then<00:04:01.380> when

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
really tight up to the tree so then when

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.039 
really tight up to the tree so then when
you<00:04:02.100> when<00:04:02.459> you<00:04:02.549> have<00:04:02.700> it<00:04:02.850> say<00:04:03.090> it<00:04:03.150> you<00:04:03.720> can<00:04:03.870> push

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:04.049 
you when you have it say it you can push

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:06.259 
you when you have it say it you can push
down<00:04:04.079> and<00:04:04.530> really<00:04:04.950> make<00:04:05.130> that<00:04:05.310> stand<00:04:05.579> bite

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:06.269 
down and really make that stand bite

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:09.140 
down and really make that stand bite
into<00:04:06.510> the<00:04:06.600> tree<00:04:06.900> okay<00:04:07.590> so<00:04:08.160> then<00:04:08.549> then<00:04:08.880> you<00:04:09.000> have

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
into the tree okay so then then you have

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:09.440 
into the tree okay so then then you have
it

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:09.450 
it

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:11.569 
it
very<00:04:09.810> good<00:04:10.049> secure<00:04:10.440> the<00:04:10.829> bottom<00:04:11.190> is<00:04:11.250> not<00:04:11.370> going

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:11.579 
very good secure the bottom is not going

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:15.080 
very good secure the bottom is not going

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
using your Lyman's belt and you want to

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:27.960 
using your Lyman's belt and you want to
be<00:04:25.950> attached<00:04:26.340> to<00:04:26.490> the<00:04:26.640> tree<00:04:27.210> at<00:04:27.390> all<00:04:27.510> time

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:27.970 
be attached to the tree at all time

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:29.880 
be attached to the tree at all time
so<00:04:28.630> if<00:04:28.690> that<00:04:28.810> means<00:04:29.020> coming<00:04:29.590> up<00:04:29.710> with<00:04:29.830> a

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:29.890 
so if that means coming up with a

so if that means coming up with a
Lyman's<00:04:30.250> belt<00:04:30.490> and<00:04:30.730> then<00:04:31.090> taking<00:04:31.480> you<00:04:31.600> a

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:31.630 
Lyman's belt and then taking you a

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:34.770 
Lyman's belt and then taking you a
secondary<00:04:32.140> rope<00:04:32.410> tying<00:04:33.010> your<00:04:33.300> tether<00:04:34.300> off<00:04:34.570> to

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:34.780 
secondary rope tying your tether off to

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:36.960 
secondary rope tying your tether off to
the<00:04:34.900> tree<00:04:35.170> then<00:04:36.160> that's<00:04:36.370> what<00:04:36.490> you<00:04:36.610> need<00:04:36.730> to<00:04:36.790> do

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:36.970 
the tree then that's what you need to do

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:38.990 
the tree then that's what you need to do
make<00:04:37.300> sure<00:04:37.480> you're<00:04:37.720> connected<00:04:38.650> at<00:04:38.800> all<00:04:38.830> times

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000 
make sure you're connected at all times

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.690 
make sure you're connected at all times
but<00:04:40.000> this<00:04:40.510> simply<00:04:40.840> folds<00:04:41.320> down<00:04:41.470> like<00:04:41.740> this<00:04:41.980> you

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:42.700 
but this simply folds down like this you

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:45.780 
but this simply folds down like this you
have<00:04:43.450> one<00:04:43.720> metal<00:04:44.050> bar<00:04:44.260> here<00:04:44.740> and<00:04:44.920> then<00:04:45.670> the

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:45.790 
have one metal bar here and then the

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:47.820 
have one metal bar here and then the
rest<00:04:45.820> of<00:04:46.060> the<00:04:46.150> noodles<00:04:46.480> on<00:04:46.570> the<00:04:46.630> outside<00:04:47.200> so

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:47.830 
rest of the noodles on the outside so

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:50.010 
rest of the noodles on the outside so
that's<00:04:48.010> what<00:04:48.340> makes<00:04:48.610> the<00:04:49.150> Millennium<00:04:49.600> so<00:04:49.810> now

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:50.020 
that's what makes the Millennium so now

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:53.160 
that's what makes the Millennium so now
I<00:04:50.470> won't<00:04:50.770> step<00:04:51.010> up<00:04:51.070> on<00:04:51.370> this<00:04:51.750> umbrella<00:04:52.750> to

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:53.170 
I won't step up on this umbrella to

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:56.220 
I won't step up on this umbrella to
worry<00:04:53.320> about<00:04:53.410> definitely<00:04:53.920> out<00:04:54.750> and<00:04:55.750> this<00:04:56.050> is

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:56.230 
worry about definitely out and this is

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:57.690 
worry about definitely out and this is
