lamp black general finishes milk paint
onto<00:00:23.610> the<00:00:23.820> drawer<00:00:24.150> and<00:00:24.360> I've<00:00:25.170> also<00:00:25.380> applied

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:25.770 
onto the drawer and I've also applied

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:29.600 
onto the drawer and I've also applied
their<00:00:26.310> high-performance<00:00:27.300> sealer<00:00:28.050> in<00:00:28.340> flat

their high-performance sealer in flat

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:31.909 
their high-performance sealer in flat
this<00:00:30.210> gives<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:30.779> paint<00:00:31.320> a<00:00:31.500> little<00:00:31.740> bit<00:00:31.829> of

00:00:31.909 --> 00:00:31.919 
this gives the paint a little bit of

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:34.819 
this gives the paint a little bit of
protection<00:00:32.180> so<00:00:33.180> when<00:00:33.360> you<00:00:33.540> put<00:00:33.960> the<00:00:34.200> glaze<00:00:34.560> on

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
protection so when you put the glaze on

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.120 
protection so when you put the glaze on
top<00:00:35.250> it's<00:00:35.520> easier<00:00:35.970> to<00:00:36.210> apply<00:00:36.890> manipulate<00:00:37.890> and

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:38.130 
top it's easier to apply manipulate and

top it's easier to apply manipulate and
wipe<00:00:38.340> off<00:00:38.579> so<00:00:39.390> let's<00:00:39.570> take<00:00:39.750> it<00:00:39.870> from<00:00:40.020> here<00:00:40.170> so
