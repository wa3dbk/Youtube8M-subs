that<00:05:33.030> lead<00:05:33.750> exposure<00:05:34.229> is<00:05:34.440> really<00:05:34.710> just<00:05:34.890> a

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:35.010 
that lead exposure is really just a

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:36.850 
that lead exposure is really just a
problem<00:05:35.250> for<00:05:35.430> children<00:05:36.000> and<00:05:36.150> kids<00:05:36.300> don't<00:05:36.630> wear

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:36.860

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:39.860 
problem for children and kids don't wear
lipstick<00:05:37.910> but<00:05:38.910> I<00:05:39.180> think<00:05:39.450> it's<00:05:39.600> really

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:39.870 
lipstick but I think it's really
