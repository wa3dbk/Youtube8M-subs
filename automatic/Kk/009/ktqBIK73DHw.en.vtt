00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.970
 yo everyone is marco I hope 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:04.680
 that you are well and following the 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.759
 last video you've been many to 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.770
 leave comments telling me 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:08.880
 some myths and legends about pc 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.139
 gamer that you heard 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.269
 so I thought why not 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.769
 make a second video on it so 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.719
 so I selected the best 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.910
 myth that you have told me and I 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.490
 I'll try to explain them 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:24.020
 either disassemble them or approve them 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.020
 short on this heads co 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.730
 2 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.810
 the first with consoles are more 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.790
 durable that pc sees is enough 

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:41.340
 complicated to answer I would say yes and 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.680
 no because of a certain level 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.140
 software a pc you can clearly the 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.309
 rot very easily and very 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.019
 quickly if there is anyone there 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.510
 knows not at all he can find himself 

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:53.430
 with 20000 malware on his pc etc 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.260
 his pc he's going to be unusable and he 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.690
 will be just good to be formatted for 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.250
 to be able to use it properly then 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.330
 that the ps4 the kids on all 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.790
 consoles this is strictly impossible 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:05.720
 the operating system is totally 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:07.680
 closed so you can not rot 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.330
 software mans your console 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.560
 except that the problem is that the 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.899
 console systems is totally 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.399
 closed which means that finally he 

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:15.780
 is not closed that software death it is 

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:16.950
 closed also hardware mans ie 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.570
 that you can not change 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.820
 components on your console aside 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.619
 the hard drive is still not phew 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.700
 so if you have a component that falls 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.070
 broken down on your console it's 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.170
 direct direct repair finally 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.970
 direct return directly to sony or 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.210
 microsoft to operate the warranty 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.259
 or have it repaired while on a pc 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.119
 it's a lot simpler because 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.410
 you just have to diagnose the piece 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.390
 who does not replace her 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:40.800
 and from that point of view there the pc will be 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.509
 much more durable than a console and 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.130
 will be much easier to maintain 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.429
 from a personal point of view that 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.170
 console after the console lasts longer 

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:50.849
 long on the games say that a 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.240
 console you can the ps3 and that lasted 

00:01:50.849 --> 00:01:53.970
 long time 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.349
 here you were able to keep it six or seven 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.640
 years old and there were always some games 

00:01:55.349 --> 00:01:58.470
 who was coming out on ps3 and who was still 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.539
 playable on pc it's true that after 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.220
 seven years ben you have already renewed 

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:02.759
 usually entirely your pc or 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.020
 nearly 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.450
 after there are things that are when 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.229
 even more durable on pc in the 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.550
 sense where for example you can use 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.229
 your case you can reuse 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.150
 your diet you can use 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.200
 your hard drives on your wish on 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.000
 your new confides that you are 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.140
 not have to change everything and after 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.989
 say that component prices are 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.739
 not excessive on pc because you 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:21.239
 have to buy a new card 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:22.830
 graphic that a lot of 250 euros 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:24.270
 suddenly it's like getting 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.910
 four games on ps4 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.050
 while 70 euros while on pc you 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:32.670
 for example, you can buy four 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:34.950
 games at 15 euros on sale here you are me 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.780
 say yes and so for this second myth 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:40.470
 it takes three screens to play well on 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:42.660
 pc it's true that there I can not 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.569
 to play it's impossible I only have one 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.760
 screen his taxes 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:47.409
 I can not get to play I say I 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.299
 not see on the screen is not big enough 

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:51.849
 name but who said it took three 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:53.230
 screens for game on pc elsewhere it's 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:54.480
 absolutely not practical on some 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:57.280
 games of times it's even one pour 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.480
 the games or have three screens for 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.760
 to play is good it's the game of 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.780
 aircraft racing simulation the rts and 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.719
 things like that trying to play a 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:07.150
 bike word three screens to the limit that 

00:03:04.719 --> 00:03:08.620
 goes to the limit to the limit well 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.510
 some games or not really three 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.489
 screens is good but it's not wrong 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.349
 not three screens to play the third 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:16.329
 a little bit disturbed is that the 

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:18.250
 players on pc are people who do not 

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:21.129
 is interested in nothing else and who does not 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:24.790
 do that with their lives while I 

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:26.230
 find that it is rather the reverse that 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:29.680
 people usually on pc have a 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:31.599
 culture a little more developed than the 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.129
 people who play that on console because 

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:34.870
 that people on consoles are more of 

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:35.590
 ul gamer causes i speak of course in 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:37.780
 a generality 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.859
 I do not do there are exceptions and 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.299
 always experiences I speak for 

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:41.260
 a very big generality ie 

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:42.359
 that people on consoles are 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.069
 usually more causes ul 

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:48.729
 usually while people on pc 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:52.000
 are more interested in the games universe 

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:53.979
 video and the multimedia world that those 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.269
 who are on console who are suddenly 

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:57.189
 more casual while the players on pc 

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:59.319
 / singing generally less casual than 

00:03:57.189 --> 00:04:02.139
 the players on consoles and so this 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:04.030
 done there they will be interested more in 

00:04:02.139 --> 00:04:08.739
 the universe if we mean to the universe 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:10.000
 geek and suddenly open up to a lot 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:11.079
 more things especially that a pc can 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.659
 do a lot more things one is 

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:16.000
 not have to play on pc so we 

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:17.769
 can do a lot of things with with 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.180
 a pc so I think it's not 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:20.380
 necessarily people who do that finally 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.699
 it's a question that's pretty 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:22.810
 difficult to answer I do not know if 

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:23.860
 it's very clear what I say so I 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:26.199
 think I'm going to stop there because 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:27.880
 otherwise I will confuse you 

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:29.380
 fourth have a pc that rotates 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:30.849
 the games at 30 fps it is useless I 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:34.690
 prefers to have a console that 

00:04:30.849 --> 00:04:36.340
 turns the games at 60fps sorry the 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:39.190
 last assassin's creed united turns to 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:41.949
 60 fps maybe ah well no we do 30 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:44.620
 fps because it's more cinematic and 

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:46.180
 also we will do in 960 peace because 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:48.340
 otherwise the game will never turn back 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:51.789
 there are lags in 1960 pie do you imagine in 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:53.129
 In 1080 then there I feel that 

00:04:51.789 --> 00:04:54.300
 people think that if 

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:56.279
 console the games are running all the time 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:57.179
 at 60 fps which is absolutely wrong because 

00:04:56.279 --> 00:04:58.619
 that there are many people who do not attempt 

00:04:57.179 --> 00:05:00.779
 not 60 fps because the developers 

00:04:58.619 --> 00:05:02.009
 can not optimize enough 

00:05:00.779 --> 00:05:03.419
 the games because the news 

00:05:02.009 --> 00:05:06.389
 next gen consoles do not necessarily have 

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:07.080
 a power or fissionable I believe that 

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:09.239
 even the last 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:10.229
 uncharted 4 who will go out or who is 

00:05:09.239 --> 00:05:12.059
 released I have no idea 

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:14.069
 I think the developers had 

00:05:12.059 --> 00:05:16.199
 trouble running the game at 60 60 fps 

00:05:14.069 --> 00:05:17.599
 and he thought the master in 30 fps 

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:19.739
 but I'm not sure he did it 

00:05:17.599 --> 00:05:21.899
 so the fifth myth that comes 

00:05:19.739 --> 00:05:23.129
 usually after the answer I 

00:05:21.899 --> 00:05:24.330
 can give when you have a little 

00:05:23.129 --> 00:05:26.009
 showed that there are a lot of games that 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:28.080
 turn in 30 fps and not in 60 fps 

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:30.569
 what are you saying yes but anyway 

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:33.599
 60 fps way it's useless since my 

00:05:30.569 --> 00:05:36.479
 eyes only see 24 frames per second 

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:38.009
 so here I invite you very soon if 

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:40.860
 you believe that's going to see this video where 

00:05:38.009 --> 00:05:42.479
 I explain why the eyes do not see 

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:45.419
 not at 24 frames per second 

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:47.009
 a thanks and why even though the movies 

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:49.499
 are in 24 frames per second its share 

00:05:47.009 --> 00:05:52.019
 is fluid and why the blow to see 

00:05:49.499 --> 00:05:54.179
 more fps not better because 

00:05:52.019 --> 00:05:55.409
 that will be more fluid and 

00:05:54.179 --> 00:05:56.639
 if you are still not convinced and 

00:05:55.409 --> 00:05:58.319
 after watching this video if you 

00:05:56.639 --> 00:05:59.789
 want to have a stock of ropes in my 

00:05:58.319 --> 00:06:02.729
 closet and chairs too that can 

00:05:59.789 --> 00:06:07.610
 you be useful last myth there is 

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:11.159
 more excluded on console than on pc who 

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:14.369
 who is the dude a clearly that they the 

00:06:11.159 --> 00:06:15.599
 dude who said that as I bring it all 

00:06:14.369 --> 00:06:20.329
 on I put the a pair of 

00:06:15.599 --> 00:06:20.329
 slaps there it annoys me I give up 

00:06:22.009 --> 00:06:27.139
 you guys do not have to say stuff like 

00:06:24.409 --> 00:06:28.610
 that he is on the nerves there he will do 

00:06:27.139 --> 00:06:29.990
 he'll make a one-day stop if you 

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:30.740
 says stuff like that on pc it 

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:33.589
 must not be a 

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:35.990
 a tip never again stuff like 

00:06:33.589 --> 00:06:39.080
 because the place is there it was 

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:40.819
 limit limit I do not know what he's going 

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:41.119
 to do but my opinion I was going there 

00:06:40.819 --> 00:06:42.589
 pass 

00:06:41.119 --> 00:06:44.089
 finally brief blow I obliged to 

00:06:42.589 --> 00:06:45.469
 resume in its place I do not know 

00:06:44.089 --> 00:06:47.990
 great thing but still need when 

00:06:45.469 --> 00:06:49.639
 not even be cool to understand that he 

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:51.849
 are still more excluded on pc than 

00:06:49.639 --> 00:06:54.110
 on consoles the steam guys 

00:06:51.849 --> 00:06:56.509
