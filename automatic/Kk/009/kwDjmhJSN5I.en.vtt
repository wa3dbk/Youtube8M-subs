00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:07.500
 It's raining today It seems that something is strange Plum is like that 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:10.800
 It is also a movie of rare sugar soda 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:13.780
 Once we decided so I would like to take a look with us 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:17.680
 That of rare sugar soda 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:18.800
 It is a raw material name, I think I want to see it together 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:25.720
 Here 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:28.840
 Including rare sugar is contained in a rare sugar-containing syrup 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:36.090
 Fructose glucose solution and plum juice 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:36.090
 This means that what I say black molasses Is whether I continue anycast acidulant flavoring 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:44.270
 If the energy is that 100ml Oh Terry # 42 kcal 

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:50.260
 To the 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:58.480
 Explain rare sugar There is only a small amount in nature 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:59.769
 It is a general term for sugar, and some of Matsutake are noted for their value, and research and development is promoted centering on color areas 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:08.950
 It is done 

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:12.520
 Is a rare sugar suite compared to is that of the syrup containing a rare sugar sugar is slightly Amami 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:14.720
 It features gentle raining 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:17.990
 What is it? 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:21.320
 Here is the content of rare sugar solar of the corresponding Acer 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:27.490
 Colorless, transparent, something something like Ms. Cider 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:27.490
 I would like to check the digestion with the strength of carbonation and raise it 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:37.560
 It is plum soda usually plum is that 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:42.930
 Flavor taste of plum which is used from Kishu or variously 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:49.620
 Well, somehow I used some Kishu plums 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:54.090
 Plum specific has become to that taste that but plum of the country I have come good flavor 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:56.290
 As for rare sugars, that's right 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.060
 Usually sweet 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:02.560
 I feel it 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:07.110
 It doesn't feel like that, it's beach sweetness, isn't it? 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.110
 It Dechotto I would like to start one more time 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:14.590
 Normally Well Ano 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.770
 Umeshu with plum from Umeshukishu without alcohol 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:23.290
 Like 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:23.290
 I don't feel like there is a taste of plum flavor with a little salt. 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:32.800
 Is this rare sugar particularly affecting the case? 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:38.290
 There is nothing in particular 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:42.730
 It is slightly sweet with umesh-like taste and is said to be refreshing with carbonic acid 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:49.080
 It's plum seems normal but I'm delicious as a plum soda 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:54.640
 It is a rare sugar that something special Amami is felt 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:58.930
 Toka do not smoke It is such a 1 Naii do not know a little better 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:01.150
 In particular , I think it's good because it's not really good for the body 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:06.040
 Well another 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:10.170
 Each to is the time being delicious plain that I think is that there is no need to buy looking for trouble 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.170
 I would like to excuse me
