hello<00:00:03.449> YouTube<00:00:03.959> I<00:00:04.560> just<00:00:05.100> decided<00:00:05.400> to<00:00:05.640> make<00:00:05.759> a

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:05.790 
hello YouTube I just decided to make a

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.049 
hello YouTube I just decided to make a
random<00:00:06.299> video<00:00:06.450> of<00:00:06.720> my<00:00:06.870> setup<00:00:07.440> I<00:00:07.849> figured<00:00:08.849> I'll

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
random video of my setup I figured I'll

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.240 
random video of my setup I figured I'll
try<00:00:09.450> getting<00:00:09.809> some<00:00:09.840> video<00:00:10.230> responses<00:00:10.860> as<00:00:11.040> well

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
try getting some video responses as well

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:12.850 
try getting some video responses as well
and<00:00:11.460> then<00:00:11.550> we'll<00:00:11.700> just<00:00:11.880> see<00:00:12.059> what

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:12.860 
and then we'll just see what

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:15.140 
and then we'll just see what
characteristics<00:00:13.860> of<00:00:13.980> the<00:00:14.160> average<00:00:14.730> set<00:00:15.030> of

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
characteristics of the average set of

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:21.080 
characteristics of the average set of
arms<00:00:15.570> so<00:00:16.070> here's<00:00:17.070> my<00:00:17.130> son<00:00:17.460> up<00:00:17.609> I<00:00:18.800> got<00:00:19.800> my<00:00:20.760> ps2

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
arms so here's my son up I got my ps2

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.480 
arms so here's my son up I got my ps2
right<00:00:21.300> there<00:00:21.660> which<00:00:21.869> is<00:00:22.020> good<00:00:22.260> for<00:00:22.289> linux<00:00:23.250> and

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
right there which is good for linux and

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.529 
right there which is good for linux and
games<00:00:24.050> then<00:00:25.050> there<00:00:25.529> i<00:00:25.560> got<00:00:25.890> my<00:00:26.099> monitor<00:00:26.519> that<00:00:27.510> i

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
games then there i got my monitor that i

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.359 
games then there i got my monitor that i
can<00:00:27.869> switch<00:00:29.300> back<00:00:30.300> and<00:00:30.359> forth<00:00:30.630> between<00:00:31.369> my

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
can switch back and forth between my

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:38.810 
can switch back and forth between my
computer<00:00:32.910> and<00:00:33.360> my<00:00:33.559> ps3<00:00:36.410> now<00:00:37.410> I<00:00:37.680> got<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.129> 5.1

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
computer and my ps3 now I got the 5.1

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.240 
computer and my ps3 now I got the 5.1
surround<00:00:39.480> sound<00:00:39.750> I<00:00:40.170> put<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:40.680> rear<00:00:40.829> speakers

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
surround sound I put the rear speakers

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.000 
surround sound I put the rear speakers
right<00:00:41.520> by<00:00:41.700> the<00:00:41.760> front<00:00:42.600> ones<00:00:42.899> I<00:00:43.260> just<00:00:43.710> like<00:00:43.890> it

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
right by the front ones I just like it

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.119 
right by the front ones I just like it
like<00:00:44.129> that<00:00:44.750> there's<00:00:45.750> my<00:00:46.050> server<00:00:46.410> chose<00:00:47.100> a

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
like that there's my server chose a

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.350 
like that there's my server chose a
laptop<00:00:47.730> because<00:00:47.910> it's<00:00:48.120> those<00:00:48.329> power<00:00:50.360> uses

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
laptop because it's those power uses

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.630 
laptop because it's those power uses
less<00:00:51.570> power<00:00:51.600> it's<00:00:52.320> most<00:00:52.530> cost<00:00:52.829> effective<00:00:53.160> and

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
less power it's most cost effective and

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.560 
less power it's most cost effective and
it's<00:00:54.030> quiet<00:00:54.739> use<00:00:55.739> wireless<00:00:56.070> is<00:00:56.430> real<00:00:56.640> which

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
it's quiet use wireless is real which

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.810 
it's quiet use wireless is real which
was<00:00:57.780> probably<00:00:57.989> met<00:00:58.230> a<00:00:58.260> good<00:00:58.410> idea<00:00:58.710> for<00:00:59.010> server

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
was probably met a good idea for server

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.279 
was probably met a good idea for server
but<00:01:00.239> still<00:01:00.480> gets<00:01:00.660> really<00:01:00.960> good<00:01:01.079> response

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
but still gets really good response

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.980 
but still gets really good response
times<00:01:02.989> this<00:01:04.040> is<00:01:05.040> my<00:01:05.850> workstation<00:01:06.450> going<00:01:06.900> to

times this is my workstation going to

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.300 
times this is my workstation going to
use<00:01:07.140> for<00:01:07.409> work<00:01:08.340> on<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.549> website<00:01:09.090> and<00:01:09.240> stuff

we'll<00:02:16.720> just<00:02:17.010> get<00:02:18.010> a<00:02:18.040> little<00:02:18.220> bit<00:02:18.400> of<00:02:18.489> an<00:02:18.640> idea

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
we'll just get a little bit of an idea

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.570 
we'll just get a little bit of an idea
of<00:02:19.030> what<00:02:19.390> the<00:02:19.569> average<00:02:19.750> setup<00:02:20.440> looks<00:02:20.590> like

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
of what the average setup looks like

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.900 
of what the average setup looks like
