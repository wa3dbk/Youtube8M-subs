00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:36.270
 Kazakhstan Moldova Belarus 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:38.809

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:42.180
 proceed to view open our 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:45.230
 miracle program we enter the serial number I 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.230

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:09.240
 checks the serial number forward 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.310
 here 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.899
 Our phone appeared, I'm showing an example 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:32.619
 on ordinary nokia 

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:37.119
 I'm 2310 here we press it twenty three d 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:41.850
 compliance with firmware 5 9 release date 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:44.740
 phone 19 2007 year 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:48.460
 a little bit there is water in mom's phone 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:51.030
 press a button among the phone here we are 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:55.829
 We see indicators that this function 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:59.310
 supports our phone waiting when 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:59.310
 data will be processed 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:07.960
 here is also the most you can block 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:13.490
 phone make calls forwarding and 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:18.800
 so on so here's our phone went 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:23.110
 city ​​of lions and here is my address or i am now 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.110
 I am exactly living 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:32.590
 so he is a hell of a rand 31 without such a thing 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.590
 so there is such 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:40.450
 Here is my approximate length showed 

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:41.930
 but of course there is my apartment or show 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.390
 so ok 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.940
 then we figured out going to the cottage 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:55.640
 block the phone here on the screen we 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:59.000
 write a letter here let's say if you 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:07.010
 stole his return phone enter here 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:10.280
 All the number and here he was knocked back the phone 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:14.660
 on the screen and stamped number and where is it 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:20.780
 can make a call and we 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:23.299
 unlock code 4 units is harmful 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:24.549
 to unlock you can and we enter 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:28.069
 to block 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:29.750
 Here and our phone does not support data 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:35.650
 the functions are what I said for 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:40.239
 The indicator from us is crossed well here 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:43.190
 further commit phone called too 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:47.000
 can give a message 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:48.650
 and also we do not have to be supported by 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.669
 Well, we have nokia 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:55.340
 running on the veins and so here are the cases 

00:03:51.669 --> 00:04:00.919
 then forwarding the same thing can be 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:03.230
 forward the message and calls further 

00:04:00.919 --> 00:04:06.620
 call logs can be downloaded and 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:10.699
 last calls to be made 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:14.599
 from phones for the last week as well 

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:16.989
 the most we can remove with a flash drive or sim 

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:16.989

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:30.620
 yes further unlock phone as we 

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:33.800
 We see our factory is closed so we'll have to 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:36.860
