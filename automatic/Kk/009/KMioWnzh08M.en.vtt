young people but not so fast studies
indicate<00:01:32.790> that<00:01:32.939> a<00:01:33.000> lot<00:01:33.210> of<00:01:33.329> these<00:01:33.479> charter

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
indicate that a lot of these charter

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.410 
indicate that a lot of these charter
schools<00:01:33.900> on<00:01:34.439> average<00:01:35.070> do<00:01:35.490> not<00:01:35.670> perform<00:01:36.090> better

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
schools on average do not perform better

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.600

than<00:01:36.750> our<00:01:36.900> public<00:01:37.290> schools<00:01:37.530> do<00:01:37.770> so<00:01:38.220> I<00:01:38.250> was

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
than our public schools do so I was

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:39.859 
than our public schools do so I was
really<00:01:38.850> surprised<00:01:39.240> by<00:01:39.390> that<00:01:39.509> because<00:01:39.630> I<00:01:39.780> had

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
really surprised by that because I had

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.330 
really surprised by that because I had
always<00:01:40.020> assumed<00:01:40.470> that<00:01:40.500> the<00:01:40.710> charter<00:01:41.040> schools

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
always assumed that the charter schools

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.149 
always assumed that the charter schools
we're<00:01:41.759> gonna<00:01:41.850> do<00:01:42.030> better<00:01:42.240> honestly<00:01:42.710> and<00:01:43.710> part

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
we're gonna do better honestly and part

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.260 
we're gonna do better honestly and part
of<00:01:44.189> the<00:01:44.280> reason<00:01:44.460> is<00:01:44.549> I<00:01:44.820> believe<00:01:45.149> in

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
of the reason is I believe in

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.780 
of the reason is I believe in
competition<00:01:45.899> and<00:01:46.079> I<00:01:46.619> believe<00:01:46.920> that<00:01:46.950> in

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
competition and I believe that in

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.760 
competition and I believe that in
diversity<00:01:48.420> so<00:01:48.659> if<00:01:49.049> you<00:01:49.259> have<00:01:49.380> a<00:01:49.409> bunch<00:01:49.680> of

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
diversity so if you have a bunch of

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.289 
diversity so if you have a bunch of
different<00:01:50.100> schools<00:01:50.280> trying<00:01:50.759> different<00:01:50.939> ways

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
different schools trying different ways

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.600 
different schools trying different ways
I<00:01:51.659> thought<00:01:52.350> that<00:01:52.680> the<00:01:53.040> cream<00:01:53.280> would<00:01:53.369> rise<00:01:53.579> to

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
I thought that the cream would rise to

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.370 
I thought that the cream would rise to
the<00:01:53.909> top<00:01:54.149> and<00:01:54.450> you'd<00:01:54.600> see<00:01:54.869> what<00:01:55.049> works<00:01:55.229> and

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
the top and you'd see what works and

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.260 
the top and you'd see what works and
what<00:01:55.560> doesn't<00:01:55.950> and<00:01:56.070> that<00:01:56.130> on<00:01:56.640> average<00:01:56.939> the

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
what doesn't and that on average the

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.459 
what doesn't and that on average the
charter<00:01:57.570> schools<00:01:57.810> would<00:01:57.960> do<00:01:58.079> better<00:01:58.259> than<00:01:58.409> the

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
charter schools would do better than the

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:59.719 
charter schools would do better than the
public<00:01:58.710> schools<00:01:58.890> now<00:01:59.040> I<00:01:59.070> was<00:01:59.280> proven<00:01:59.610> wrong

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
public schools now I was proven wrong

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.149 
public schools now I was proven wrong
that's<00:02:00.180> not<00:02:00.360> what<00:02:00.600> happened<00:02:00.990> but<00:02:01.680> this<00:02:01.890> story

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
that's not what happened but this story

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.300 
that's not what happened but this story
begins<00:02:02.369> to<00:02:02.579> explain<00:02:03.000> part<00:02:03.509> of<00:02:03.630> the<00:02:03.689> reason<00:02:03.990> why

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
begins to explain part of the reason why

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.649 
begins to explain part of the reason why
because<00:02:05.310> there's<00:02:05.640> a<00:02:05.790> reason<00:02:06.299> why<00:02:06.420> there's

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
because there's a reason why there's

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.270 
because there's a reason why there's
some<00:02:06.960> of<00:02:07.079> the<00:02:07.140> rules<00:02:07.350> not<00:02:07.590> all<00:02:07.799> the<00:02:08.009> rules<00:02:08.129> but

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
some of the rules not all the rules but

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.650 
some of the rules not all the rules but
some<00:02:08.520> of<00:02:08.610> the<00:02:08.670> rules<00:02:08.849> in<00:02:09.000> the<00:02:09.090> public<00:02:09.360> schools

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
some of the rules in the public schools

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.320 
some of the rules in the public schools
now<00:02:10.319> when<00:02:10.470> you<00:02:10.560> take<00:02:10.739> away<00:02:10.860> those<00:02:11.129> rules<00:02:12.030> what

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
now when you take away those rules what

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.300 
now when you take away those rules what
winds<00:02:12.660> up<00:02:12.780> happening<00:02:12.840> that

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
winds up happening that

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.430 
winds up happening that
charter<00:02:13.520> schools<00:02:13.670> while<00:02:14.390> these<00:02:14.569> corporations

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
charter schools while these corporations

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.199 
charter schools while these corporations
come<00:02:15.680> in<00:02:15.830> they<00:02:15.950> go<00:02:16.069> by<00:02:16.250> this<00:02:16.310> by<00:02:16.700> that<00:02:16.910> by<00:02:17.150> this

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209 
come in they go by this by that by this

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:19.510 
come in they go by this by that by this
by<00:02:17.599> that<00:02:17.840> forget<00:02:18.470> the<00:02:18.620> rules<00:02:18.830> gimme<00:02:19.280> gimme

and<00:02:20.270> it<00:02:20.450> turns<00:02:20.720> out<00:02:20.840> the<00:02:20.959> charter<00:02:21.230> schools

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
and it turns out the charter schools

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.220 
and it turns out the charter schools
wind<00:02:21.709> up<00:02:21.920> being<00:02:22.130> totally<00:02:22.819> inefficient<00:02:23.330> yes<00:02:23.989> in

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
wind up being totally inefficient yes in

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.400 
wind up being totally inefficient yes in
fact<00:02:24.470> the<00:02:24.709> administrative<00:02:25.430> costs<00:02:25.940> are

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
fact the administrative costs are

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:29.589 
fact the administrative costs are
extremely<00:02:27.410> high<00:02:27.760> relatively<00:02:28.760> speaking<00:02:29.150> in

00:02:29.589 --> 00:02:29.599 
extremely high relatively speaking in

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:32.110 
extremely high relatively speaking in
charter<00:02:30.140> schools<00:02:30.370> so<00:02:31.370> that's<00:02:31.489> really<00:02:31.790> a<00:02:31.880> big

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
charter schools so that's really a big

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.699 
charter schools so that's really a big
problem<00:02:32.480> and<00:02:32.599> David<00:02:32.840> Sirota<00:02:32.989> points<00:02:33.410> to<00:02:33.560> that

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:33.709 
problem and David Sirota points to that

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:36.640 
problem and David Sirota points to that
perfectly<00:02:34.220> but<00:02:34.670> of<00:02:35.239> course<00:02:35.569> Rupert<00:02:36.319> Murdoch
