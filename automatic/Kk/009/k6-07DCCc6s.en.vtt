00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:16.070

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:29.820
 same many commissioners and no one for 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:33.900
 spectra veshka not understand our business 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:38.240

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:00.750
 surely surely what they got 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:03.360
 great game practice it went to us 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.070
 plus first of all these guys 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.940
 who received little during the season 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:13.750
 practice play but this with this i can 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:15.940
 agree or 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.100
 help win 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:29.220
 parents of universities broadcast 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:29.220
 spying on the pipe will see here 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:49.200
 today such things can not be allowed 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:51.520
 special pilaf man experienced 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:03:09.130
 the loser has no right to leave 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:03:11.230
 teams less so such an idea 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:13.600
 to get to here 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:14.840
 need to play not the team 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:17.230
 he won't understand it 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.230
 he will 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:30.580
 you are very similar to perception. 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:30.580
 taught new author 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:37.159
 regularly played very little to you 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:43.519
 perform he and Angarsk spoke a lot 

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:45.950
 a guy happened to him through her in that 

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:49.400
 including even analyze our answer to wife 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:50.180
 to the question about but this too of course 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.610
 very cracks 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:57.709
 no new couple i worked all season we walked 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:04:01.190
 I donâ€™t think much about milk for a long time 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:02.780
 what else can I say is not so easy 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:03.349
 was directing and sent him 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.890
 Angarsk 

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:09.940
 and we are not happy with everything 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:12.019
 get through once the end of the season basically 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:16.690
 Maxim began to justify his potential 

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:20.019
 that guy played the youth team 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:20.019
 just the same there 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:29.530
 on the hook 2 mega your old address i want 

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:40.930
 commands of the month from time 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:42.759
 January help and we all look at 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:47.199
 tomorrow's match is already dependent on 

00:04:42.759 --> 00:04:48.070
 after all, our morning can get up and 

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:54.250
 read that someone 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:59.380
 disqualified yet by the match in the evening 

00:04:54.250 --> 00:05:00.910
 up therefore therefore well naturally if i 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:03.850
 tell us all of us again and play on 

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:05.110
 an hour arrived 24 field players therefore 

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:07.720
 naturally we are considering all 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:10.320
 everyone is looking forward to see the match 

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:10.320
 I decided 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:19.960
 I had a nice operation 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:23.259
 would her for such 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:26.039
 ratio taking into account the fact that it will pass 

00:05:23.259 --> 00:05:26.039
 tasting wear 

00:05:28.199 --> 00:05:31.520
 implementer or set up let's allow 

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:34.310
 was changing 

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:37.639
 you go out all the card stands right after 

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:40.280
 games do not happen like books first 

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:42.500
 shoveled everything that happened digest 

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:45.250
 view analyze and then already 

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:45.250
 do and even
