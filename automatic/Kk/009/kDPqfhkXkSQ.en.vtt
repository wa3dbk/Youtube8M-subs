00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.830 
this new game because I haven't tried
our<00:01:09.750> new<00:01:09.930> game<00:01:10.140> since<00:01:10.409> grand<00:01:10.860> theft<00:01:11.010> auto<00:01:11.159> v

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.179 

battlefield<00:01:15.840> 4<00:01:15.960> I<00:01:16.409> mean<00:01:16.710> this<00:01:16.890> game<00:01:17.100> would

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
battlefield 4 I mean this game would

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.609 
battlefield 4 I mean this game would
probably<00:01:17.549> cool<00:01:17.729> with<00:01:17.850> this<00:01:17.970> may<00:01:18.119> in<00:01:18.180> 2002<00:01:18.840> the

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
probably cool with this may in 2002 the

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.890 
probably cool with this may in 2002 the
graphics<00:01:20.100> are<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.670> worst<00:01:20.909> I've<00:01:21.180> seen<00:01:21.240> ever

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
graphics are the worst I've seen ever

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.100 
graphics are the worst I've seen ever
like<00:01:22.740> dude<00:01:23.040> I<00:01:23.159> mean<00:01:23.340> they're<00:01:23.610> so<00:01:23.850> bad<00:01:24.060> if<00:01:24.960> this

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
like dude I mean they're so bad if this

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.539 
like dude I mean they're so bad if this
was<00:01:25.290> their<00:01:25.439> first<00:01:25.619> attempt<00:01:26.040> I<00:01:26.100> try<00:01:26.250> to<00:01:26.280> make<00:01:26.490> a

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
was their first attempt I try to make a

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:27.920 
was their first attempt I try to make a
first<00:01:26.759> person<00:01:26.939> shooter<00:01:27.119> and<00:01:27.659> okay<00:01:27.900> I

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
first person shooter and okay I

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.319 
first person shooter and okay I
understand<00:01:28.500> but<00:01:29.070> it<00:01:29.189> has<00:01:29.340> for<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:29.850> title<00:01:30.180> so

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
understand but it has for the title so

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:31.580 
understand but it has for the title so
you<00:01:30.390> assume<00:01:30.780> that<00:01:30.960> there's<00:01:31.110> at<00:01:31.259> least<00:01:31.290> four

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
you assume that there's at least four

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.399 
you assume that there's at least four
behind<00:01:31.979> this<00:01:32.130> one<00:01:32.509> or<00:01:33.509> something<00:01:34.290> like<00:01:34.350> that

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
behind this one or something like that

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:39.710 
behind this one or something like that
anyway<00:01:35.159> so<00:01:35.490> it's<00:01:36.090> like<00:01:38.329> the<00:01:39.329> fact<00:01:39.479> that<00:01:39.570> they

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
anyway so it's like the fact that they

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.990 
anyway so it's like the fact that they
keep<00:01:40.130> making<00:01:41.130> these<00:01:41.369> games<00:01:41.610> a<00:01:41.700> year<00:01:41.759> after

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
keep making these games a year after

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.200 
keep making these games a year after
year<00:01:42.030> and<00:01:42.450> it<00:01:42.869> continued<00:01:43.170> to<00:01:43.229> be<00:01:43.380> terrible<00:01:43.799> is

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
year and it continued to be terrible is

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.719 
year and it continued to be terrible is
just<00:01:45.210> terrible<00:01:45.570> and<00:01:46.380> people<00:01:46.770> people<00:01:47.460> aren't

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
just terrible and people people aren't

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:48.649 
just terrible and people people aren't
