00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.940 
doubt that happens as defconn if anyone
is<00:00:30.810> made<00:00:30.960> you<00:00:31.140> hit<00:00:31.830> Ron<00:00:32.070> Cey<00:00:33.710> absolutely<00:00:34.710> is

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
is made you hit Ron Cey absolutely is

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.680 
is made you hit Ron Cey absolutely is
the<00:00:35.160> core<00:00:35.370> fracture<00:00:35.880> but<00:00:36.030> I<00:00:36.149> don't<00:00:36.480> think

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
the core fracture but I don't think

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.630 
the core fracture but I don't think
you'll<00:00:36.899> inflict<00:00:37.110> physical<00:00:37.469> damage<00:00:38.070> I<00:00:38.219> hope<00:00:38.399> on

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640
