so<00:00:28.320> if<00:00:29.100> we<00:00:29.280> can<00:00:29.400> get<00:00:29.520> a<00:00:29.550> shot<00:00:29.820> off<00:00:30.150> maybe<00:00:30.780> both<00:00:31.020> a

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:31.759 
so if we can get a shot off maybe both a

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:36.639 
so if we can get a shot off maybe both a
so<00:00:32.759> what<00:00:32.910> we've<00:00:33.000> got<00:00:33.120> here<00:00:33.239> is<00:00:33.980> the<00:00:34.980> Unicare

00:00:36.639 --> 00:00:36.649 
so what we've got here is the Unicare

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:38.810 
so what we've got here is the Unicare
assigns<00:00:37.649> different<00:00:37.859> commands<00:00:38.309> from<00:00:38.489> the

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
assigns different commands from the

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.540 
assigns different commands from the
existing<00:00:39.329> steering<00:00:39.660> wheels<00:00:39.839> to<00:00:40.739> making

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
existing steering wheels to making

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.029 
existing steering wheels to making
function<00:00:41.969> different<00:00:42.510> different<00:00:43.379> soft<00:00:43.559> areas

00:00:44.029 --> 00:00:44.039 
function different different soft areas

00:00:44.039 --> 00:00:48.290 
function different different soft areas
of<00:00:44.249> the<00:00:44.399> kit<00:00:44.609> so<00:00:46.190> for<00:00:47.190> example<00:00:47.609> to<00:00:47.820> enter<00:00:48.179> the

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300

menu we use the sync button so we go

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.040 
menu we use the sync button so we go
seek<00:00:51.839> up<00:00:52.140> down<00:00:52.710> up<00:00:53.219> down<00:00:53.550> up<00:00:53.909> down<00:00:54.059> twice<00:00:54.480> up

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
seek up down up down up down twice up

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.610 
seek up down up down up down twice up
down<00:00:55.589> up<00:00:55.859> down<00:00:56.179> you<00:00:57.179> can<00:00:57.329> see<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.600> kit<00:00:57.839> enters

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
down up down you can see the kit enters

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.360 
down up down you can see the kit enters
the<00:00:59.309> phone<00:00:59.670> book<00:00:59.850> menu<00:01:00.390> so<00:01:01.019> from<00:01:01.260> there<00:01:01.469> we<00:01:01.710> use
