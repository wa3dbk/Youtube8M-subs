00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.170
 good morning like this greets you in the 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.900
 today I'm going to make a good video 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:23.029
 quickie just to explain something 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:26.880
 that I use on my hair to 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:29.730
 empty it to smooth it to remove the 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.079
 waves when for example I that I have the 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.990
 Curly hair that I told you 

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:36.300
 many times this 

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:39.810
 when it's not going to grow or this hair 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:42.690
 they see it straight because it's stabilized 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:45.440
 but when the root starts to grow the 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:48.630
 root grows with my natural hair and 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.580
 Chinese curly as they say in some 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:53.130
 places used when you say like 

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:55.770
 they say in other places then custom 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:58.710
 that is growing me since I have 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.650
 growth you can be noticing the 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.010
 difference 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:06.720
 straight smooth caste hair that was 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:11.300
 already treated but the root 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.300
 the hair that is growing to be visaed 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.880
 if it was decided they reach to look good 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:20.070
 then what do I do when I have 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.229
 a lot of growth and I got a little 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.149
 uncomfortable to accommodate my hair because 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.430
 when I dry it with the dryer I do not 

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:28.740
 logically remains the same here I have left 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.899
 like a better bad more sit down and here I 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.070
 stays with more and little bird for more or 

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:34.799
 that you iron and all this 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.170
 especially when he's already like that 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:40.530
 wet you start to be like tap 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.570
 it starts to be like that then we have 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.369
 what to expect from having enough 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:48.000
 growth I do not usually know 23 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:51.179
 months and then what I use I'm going to 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.850
 share with you without a box that 

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:57.179
 is a cream analyzer is not very 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:59.280
 strong as a reads be strong is something 

00:01:57.179 --> 00:02:02.880
 very soft but leaves the hair well 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:05.429
 smoothed well inspired this is a kit or 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.780
 whether it is a complete kit brings everything 

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:08.729
 what one needs to do this 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.280
 process and this process can do it 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.280
 one in a room or I do it in the 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.930
 home because I get much cheaper 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.670
 and I know where I want to go, I know 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.060
 how much and all good I'm going to tell you 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:24.370
 bring this box 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:27.569
 this box brings the al isr 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:31.260
 or the base 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:33.030
 bring this that is the activator then 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.870
 here says for example says the little letter ah 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:39.230
 and then the letrita sees then this what 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.750
 we throw everything 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:45.650
 I'm sorry, my phone 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:47.030
 we miss this all this 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:50.540
 this liquid that is the activator what 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:55.000
 we throw everything here then when 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:55.000
 we carry here that brings a little stick 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:03.570
 bring a little stick and stir it 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:06.090
 stir scrambled well because it is 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:09.920
 realize that we are going to put on 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.920
 after we put this to the isr 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:14.150
 shampoo 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:20.750
 the shampoo it brings is a shampoo for 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:22.580
 neutralize what is going to do that 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:25.640
 they will not update once we 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:27.530
 we put the smoothing cream this already 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:30.080
 remove the effect kills the effect of 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:32.330
 cream so that the hair does not follow 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:35.690
 the process of healthy glaze is followed 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:37.849
 follow then this we do not put them a 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:39.980
 Once we've texted each other, we make sure 

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:41.599
 of not feeling the cream and then not 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:44.400
 you can put everything weigh because they are given 

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:45.989
 account is pretty enough 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:49.110
 after we put on ciampino what 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:51.060
 we bring brings a treatment back to 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:53.010
 give that what the hair needs 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.710
 when the hair is processed then 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:56.690
 this is left 

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:58.640
 I'll leave it for an hour if I 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:00.200
 I put Monday I get rich plastic if I do not 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:02.540
 has a plastic bag and 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.290
 everyone leaves it for an hour when it 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:06.970
 they take it away 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:09.910
 but it looks good soft pretty nice 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:11.710
 out of this this brings an oil 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:15.000
 that I really like that it's a gel 

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:17.350
 lotion that is like a creampie an oil 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.120
 this is very good this says it helps 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:20.799
 also to dry hair when 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.930
 hair is very dry helps one 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:26.710
 It also helps to give softness to the 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:29.230
 Hair root also conditions and 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:31.420
 is very good for damaged hair will 

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:33.520
 gives elasticity gives softness and gives 

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:35.170
 shine to hair this has been done as 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.940
 any milestone oil we've made a 

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:39.310
 little hands go up and I do not know 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:42.070
 they put but this is not part of the process 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:45.510
 Is this what he brings for when he tries it 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:45.510
 another is that they treat well 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:51.479
 treat me this that we can use this 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:53.220
 when we put on curlers when 

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:55.470
 we put rolos or when we do the 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:57.780
 turn also very good is like a 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:00.550
 water and it's very good also from the 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:02.140
 comes in the package 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:04.450
 something that also three are 

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:07.390
 instructions in the instructions we 

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:10.210
 they say more or less everything step by step 

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:11.860
 also tells us the time I what 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:13.270
 I 'm going to make a video because I 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:14.740
 I'm going to put and I 'm going to show you 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:16.180
 how do I put it on why that is not said 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:20.189
 video so that you can see the 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:23.529
 difference then one grabs one 

00:05:20.189 --> 00:05:25.330
 a timer or something to mark time and 

00:05:23.529 --> 00:05:27.969
 one puts the time one will last in 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:30.400
 that time one has to put on all the 

00:05:27.969 --> 00:05:31.779
 cream and do the whole process that one what 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:33.099
 have to do look at my next life 

00:05:31.779 --> 00:05:35.650
 so you can see how I'm going to put it 

00:05:33.099 --> 00:05:41.279
 so here it says if the hair is 

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:41.279
 finite from 10 to 12 to 12 minutes maximum 

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:47.310
 If the hair is medium or is it never 

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:48.630
 There was an infinite or very thick 13 15 

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:51.570
 minutes that is the time that the 

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:53.940
 our give us to put it if the 

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:58.240
 well-resilient head and a hair 

00:05:53.940 --> 00:06:00.280
 strong 15 to 18 minutes 

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:01.720
 then here to the side also says 

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:04.760
 then if the hair 

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:07.070
 they also give you other options 

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:10.280
 We can not last a maximum of 20 minutes 

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:12.680
 then we can put the time in 

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:15.110
 where you do not want to put on a phone in 

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:16.820
 the to mark the time when we go to 

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:18.800
 to last putting us coming putting it 

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:21.050
 of this and remember the change has to 

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:23.540
 be dirty can not do it with the 

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:25.220
 clean hair because then the root 

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:26.690
 it's clean and we're going to feel like 

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:29.510
 we are burning like that is us 

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:32.420
 scratching and with dirty hair then 

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:33.800
 we have this we have the dirty root and we 

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:36.530
 will stand more to do this 

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:40.400
 process of this cream in 20 minutes 

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:42.470
 never put it on with clean hair 

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:45.500
 good girls then look at my next 

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:50.800
 video that we can see how I'm going to 

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:50.800
 put because then I wait for you go
