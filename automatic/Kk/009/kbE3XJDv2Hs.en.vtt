seeing people get started so this

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.010 
seeing people get started so this
material<00:00:35.880> is<00:00:35.969> very<00:00:36.239> near<00:00:36.510> and<00:00:36.540> dear<00:00:36.780> to<00:00:36.809> my

so<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.670> drums<00:00:38.879> can<00:00:39.030> be<00:00:39.059> a<00:00:39.120> little<00:00:39.329> bit

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
so the drums can be a little bit

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.330 
so the drums can be a little bit
confusing<00:00:39.930> especially<00:00:40.800> if<00:00:40.890> your<00:00:40.980> drum<00:00:41.190> set

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
confusing especially if your drum set

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.799 
confusing especially if your drum set
came<00:00:41.579> completely<00:00:42.000> disassembled<00:00:42.690> there's

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809

you're probably looking at them like
which<00:00:46.680> one<00:00:46.860> goes<00:00:47.039> where<00:00:47.100> we're<00:00:47.969> gonna<00:00:48.059> take
