00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:09.960
 Hello today, I look well in the form 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:12.630
 release of the game took place in the warmth of 2008 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.490
 in Russian, it came out only 2009 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.770
 cooked up is a strategy 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:20.580
 World War 2 in which we can 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:23.580
 decide the course of history in this game 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.740
 maybe all the Nazis can take over the world 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.189
 and japan throw a nuclear bomb on 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.189
 America 

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:34.930
 immediately after choosing a company 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:37.300
 we are invited to choose the nation of Germany 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:41.170
 to japan italy usa 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:44.710
 britain ussr or france here 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:49.059
 attached to oksana leaders strong and 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:53.440
 weaknesses of the country and history 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:55.920
 nation further to other plan customization on 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.920
 your taste 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.090
 for beginners here is my adviser 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.250
 Board is very commonplace mb in the game is divided 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.070
 in two parts the first part of his 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.700
 save and policy and drag and drop 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.979
 unit icons and the second I will say later 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.299
 back to 1 we have windows 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.210
 areas where we can start 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:31.460
 structure and the leader of such 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:34.040
 infantry tanks and aircraft ships 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:37.369
 further economy it comes down to collecting 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:39.409
 tax and trading forest ate the window 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:43.690
 research allows us to study new 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:43.690
 technology to improve our army 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:50.000
 down to the atomic bombs ministry 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:52.009
 interior shows relationship 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.399
 citizens on every territory to our 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:54.399
 regime 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.570
 window the ministry of foreign affairs to 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.580
 the most intense here we can look 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:05.300
 how do international relations add up 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:09.260
 sign alliances sign facts 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:09.260
 trade declare war 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.530
 and the last statistics window 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:39.240
 let's look at the war for example Slovakia 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:46.209
 and lead for the troops we open a window with 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:48.250
 stopping forces and in the framework 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:51.730
 capitulate present on the battlefield 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:53.770
 or not present present at 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:56.580
 principle not necessarily given 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:58.870
 and the second engagement battlefield 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.950
 the second part looks like the most 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.630
 ordinary 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.630
 strategies known to all of us 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:13.120
 here all the standard fitch and data 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:14.350
 them again and the developers have implemented it 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.860
 bad enough 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:20.459
 could have been better so the score would be him 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:20.459
 not the nicest 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:41.110
 after the battle the window with his 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.110
 results and losses 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:46.880
 let's summarize in on the gameplay first 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:50.450
 participation done quite well 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:54.080
 You can rate 9 out of 10 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:57.280
 the second is made quite wretched I put 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:57.280
 3 and 10 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:04.040
 i background sudan listen to the sound at the end 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.040
 I will comment 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:33.470
 sound is recorded well enough 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:33.470
 put 7 out of 10 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:38.020
 look at the graphics in the game 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:41.770
 meaningless as after all this 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:48.780
 strategy and for her she is perfectly acceptable 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:51.070
 I put 5 and 10 despite the fact that 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:52.930
 minimum system requirements specified 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:55.360
 very low I can not imagine how to them 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:57.280
 you can play the game will probably be like 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:00.400
 on their shows with this configuration 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:03.010
 computer I answered the game on the computer 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:05.830
 much more powerful indicated in the minimum 

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:08.200
 system requirements the game is very strong 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:09.880
 lagged and hard enough from him 

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:13.240
 must modern powerful computer 

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:15.790
 sometimes skips lags game enough 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:20.250
 zagagirovannaya and so optimization 

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:22.780
 bad put 2 and 10 

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:24.460
 The game is only available for now. 

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:27.520
 games can only be bought from the hands of others 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:29.700
 I have been on the disk for five years now 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:33.340
 pirated version can be found anywhere 

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:35.230
 it is very widespread if 

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:37.180
 omit the fact that the unit on the console 

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:40.660
 is that you licensed cheeks buy it 

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:41.230
 very difficult that accessibility will be 10 of 

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:44.080
 ten 

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:44.740
 but these facts cannot be released so 

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:50.050
 availability 

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:51.390
 3 out of 10 as a result we can get 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:55.150
 assessment 

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:58.720
 4.8 but I omit a little objectivity and 

00:05:55.150 --> 00:06:01.480
 add up to 6 in general it seems to me 

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:03.250
 appreciation serving fiends me very 

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:04.720
 interesting and you can play it all 

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:07.690
 kill enough time 

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:09.090
 if you need it so advise 

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:11.860
 everybody play 

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:14.410
 as a cake, I will say that you can 

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:15.520
 will disagree with my opinion she 

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:17.590
 purely personal
