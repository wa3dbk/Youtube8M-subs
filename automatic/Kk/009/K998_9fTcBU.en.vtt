00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:13.830

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.389
 kross here for another video guys 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.340
 Next I had to do a blog to 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:21.750
 You are and I wanted to make one. 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:23.850
 communicated to you because it really is 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.250
 It was past time to do it. 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.859
 This blog is for you to do this. 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.080
 comment is how you perceived 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.030
 in the last days and in my two 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.030
 last videos or three or four do not know 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.309
 when he started the blog I test is okay 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.350
 I ended up changing the system a bit 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.700
 money intruders not the system of 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.410
 channel thumbnails 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.420
 ie you know it is also business is 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.550
 I also only those miniatures that the 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.239
 people put in the right videos to stay 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.829
 there handsome man showing up for you to see 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:55.230
 before clicking the right video or is it 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.629
 one thing that really brings an audience 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.660
 for the channel it changes everything completely 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:03.239
 is not the view people have of the channel 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.010
 I was not satisfied with the synthesis 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.920
 of my channel or was not because 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:10.020
 had a lot of lyrics polluting the channel knows 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.159
 that for the people looked at a typeface 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.090
 lots of stuff I was not really 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:17.970
 satisfied with that and these days 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.710
 Hey, and the bank's early does not know me. 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.720
 he posted a business on twitter that I 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.970
 I saw, did I really say that? 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.909
 true that all meetings of the 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:30.479
 twitter bradou do youtube brazil all 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:32.070
 the tanks are alike then it seems 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.200
 that the whole channel is the same guy 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.880
 really after I saw him talking 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.020
 This I stopped for I went there 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.290
 youtube to see 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.000
 and really she was really is looks 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.250
 that all the channels are the same know 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.229
 there is nothing to differ 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:50.130
 There is nothing that you understand I want 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:52.170
 say I adopted a new system of 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.090
 Ines tango as you saw you came 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.810
 until today the little roses also god form 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.880
 and they're cool, and I'm fine too. 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.560
 I like it, I like it, I like it, I'm good. 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.659
 enjoying doing this kind of too 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.610
 because it is also a kind of cleaner and 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.799
 cleaner or I'm finding it too 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.959
 more handsome than I actually look like 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:11.250
 for the right channel, something else that you 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.890
 They also realized that I'm going through 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.480
 more filters on the videos then 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.910
 Good, the videos will earn more 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:21.090
 quality is not as much of audio as of 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.720
 in the part of the part of the same image 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.540
 huh 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:28.530
 it is another very important thing too 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:30.600
 What I wanted to tell you is me. 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:33.990

 good people are very good people and are not 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.390
 closing ball is not because they really have 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:18.120
 I bought other stores the guys do not have the 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:22.019
 same care that df faces 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:23.070

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:24.750
 good fucking people 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:26.760
 Thanks, bro. You 'll exchange an idea with 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.860
 the guys and such years and see a difference 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.810
 I've spoken a thousand times, but it's because 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:33.180
 I'm excited so they sent me 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:35.459
 here the ps4 here it stays here on the side 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:38.640
 there is a table that where I leave 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:42.000
 all mine is my right consoles 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:44.430
 so they basically stay at that table 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.530
 here and here on the other side has a monitor 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.329
 there is another monitor here then until this 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:51.360
 monitor I'm talking to you have 

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:53.250
 another here and there's another one here that I'm going 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.630
 make a video showing our top that 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:56.640
 which is also something that you 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:57.540
 Ask me the fuck I never have the time 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:01.470
 to do 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:03.989
 well come on it's because that rolled this 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:06.090
 change in mining covers because it rolled 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:08.519
 because before folks will talk to you 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:10.049
 that I uploaded my channel until 40 

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:13.560
 one thousand subscribers 

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:15.600
 mano tipo do not know there's going to be the industrialist 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.190
 because my equipment has not yet 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.930
 they are tops but nowadays I have one 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:21.510
 equipment that can already lead the channel 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:23.729
 more good on, so I suffered with 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:24.990
 the equipment used with the bad program 

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:27.020
 You know I did not have an editing program . 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:29.030
 I have today I did not have 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:31.699
 the programs I have today audio 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:34.659
 and such I had not badly knowing then I 

00:04:31.699 --> 00:04:36.830
 I suffered a lot with equipment like 

00:04:34.659 --> 00:04:39.740
 outdated and old equipment and today 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:41.810
 I already have equipment a little bit 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:45.080
 It's better to make videos for you right. 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:46.849
 So it's today I have the condition 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.470
 bring to you I feel in the 

00:04:46.849 --> 00:04:49.639
 obligation since I do not bring more 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:51.740
 that one video per day 

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:54.169
 For now, I have to do it. 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:56.449
 more in the video in the videos really and 

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:58.310
 That's when you also saw that I 

00:04:56.449 --> 00:05:00.530
 always had a different way of 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:03.710
 start the videos that was I put a 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:05.930
 from the video and then put it in 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:07.580
 and I changed it because because one of 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:09.349
 You told me something that I found 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:11.479
 quite convincingly that I actually found 

00:05:09.349 --> 00:05:13.220
 was very plausible that it could 

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:15.919
 really gives a little spoiler than 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:18.080
 happened in the video so I took it and 

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:20.330
 I put the sponsors on the other 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:22.250
 belts at the beginning of the video now 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:24.020
 from now the video will sell because 

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:26.319
 sure you also liked it a lot said 

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:30.169
 I was really happy of course 

00:05:26.319 --> 00:05:32.960
 It's good so people were basically 

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:34.729
 this is there and do a play 4 boxing 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:36.349
