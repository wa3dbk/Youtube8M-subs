little<00:06:27.210> bit<00:06:27.450> less<00:06:27.600> cilantro<00:06:28.170> but<00:06:29.160> other<00:06:29.280> than

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:29.460 
little bit less cilantro but other than

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:33.170 
little bit less cilantro but other than
that<00:06:29.520> it's<00:06:29.850> a<00:06:30.030> good<00:06:30.510> recipe<00:06:30.840> and<00:06:31.460> I<00:06:32.460> definitely
