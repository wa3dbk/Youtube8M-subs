have like where you'd only have to tap
it<00:00:50.190> down<00:00:50.309> a<00:00:50.340> little<00:00:50.520> bit<00:00:50.700> and<00:00:50.969> they<00:00:51.090> or<00:00:51.329> they

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
it down a little bit and they or they

would make the throw of the analog L&amp;R

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.270 
would make the throw of the analog L&amp;R
buttons<00:00:54.449> be<00:00:54.690> much<00:00:54.960> shorter<00:00:55.260> so<00:00:55.680> you<00:00:55.739> could<00:00:56.010> you

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
buttons be much shorter so you could you

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.369 
buttons be much shorter so you could you
know<00:00:56.399> do<00:00:56.579> rapid-fire<00:00:57.300> because<00:00:58.140> you<00:00:58.230> didn't

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
know do rapid-fire because you didn't

00:00:58.379 --> 00:00:59.630 
know do rapid-fire because you didn't
have<00:00:58.440> to<00:00:58.559> push<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.890> button<00:00:59.160> down<00:00:59.309> as<00:00:59.489> hard

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
have to push the button down as hard

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.580 
have to push the button down as hard
they<00:01:00.329> were<00:01:00.390> crazy<00:01:00.840> and<00:01:01.109> they<00:01:01.230> were<00:01:01.289> really

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
they were crazy and they were really

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.799 
they were crazy and they were really
expensive<00:01:02.160> too<00:01:02.670> and<00:01:02.940> it<00:01:03.480> seems<00:01:03.719> like

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
expensive too and it seems like

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.990 
expensive too and it seems like
Microsoft<00:01:04.500> is<00:01:04.650> going<00:01:04.979> after<00:01:05.220> that<00:01:05.640> market
