00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
in description below it's belfie three

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.490 
in description below it's belfie three
but<00:02:17.700> it's<00:02:17.820> like<00:02:18.300> the<00:02:18.570> pro<00:02:18.810> mode<00:02:18.990> version<00:02:19.350> we

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
but it's like the pro mode version we

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.760 
but it's like the pro mode version we
had<00:02:19.650> like<00:02:19.950> tested<00:02:20.820> like<00:02:21.180> back<00:02:21.510> in<00:02:21.540> the<00:02:21.690> days<00:02:21.900> so

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
had like tested like back in the days so

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.910 
had like tested like back in the days so
you<00:02:23.670> basically<00:02:23.850> have<00:02:24.420> no<00:02:24.690> suppression<00:02:25.050> no

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
you basically have no suppression no

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.910 
you basically have no suppression no
weird<00:02:26.430> color<00:02:26.700> correction<00:02:27.210> and<00:02:27.240> all<00:02:28.200> are<00:02:28.350> like

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
weird color correction and all are like

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.410 
weird color correction and all are like
good<00:02:29.190> stuff<00:02:29.310> and<00:02:29.670> I<00:02:29.850> think<00:02:30.090> right<00:02:30.180> now<00:02:30.360> it's

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
good stuff and I think right now it's

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.120 
good stuff and I think right now it's
closed<00:02:30.750> beta<00:02:30.960> and<00:02:31.290> I<00:02:31.350> really<00:02:31.770> want<00:02:31.890> to<00:02:31.980> get<00:02:32.070> a

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:23.900 
definitely pralay stealth Bell front
because<00:03:22.590> there<00:03:22.770> to<00:03:22.980> love<00:03:23.250> Star<00:03:23.520> Wars<00:03:23.730> and

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
because there to love Star Wars and

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.120 
because there to love Star Wars and
battlefront<00:03:24.450> so<00:03:25.080> that's<00:03:25.350> a<00:03:25.530> no<00:03:25.800> brainer<00:03:25.830> for

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
battlefront so that's a no brainer for

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:29.510 
battlefront so that's a no brainer for
me<00:03:26.280> and<00:03:26.959> yeah<00:03:27.959> but<00:03:28.140> still<00:03:28.709> quite<00:03:29.070> some<00:03:29.340> time

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:29.520 
me and yeah but still quite some time

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.400 
me and yeah but still quite some time
off<00:03:29.700> until<00:03:30.030> it's<00:03:30.480> possible<00:03:30.810> for<00:03:30.870> me<00:03:31.080> to<00:03:31.110> play

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
off until it's possible for me to play

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.260 
off until it's possible for me to play
those<00:03:31.590> games<00:03:31.650> it's<00:03:32.280> like<00:03:32.459> at<00:03:32.850> the<00:03:32.970> end<00:03:33.000> of<00:03:33.150> the

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:33.270 
those games it's like at the end of the

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:36.860 
those games it's like at the end of the
year<00:03:33.300> so<00:03:34.160> I<00:03:35.160> think<00:03:35.640> right<00:03:35.910> now<00:03:36.120> it<00:03:36.330> might<00:03:36.630> be

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
year so I think right now it might be

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.500 
year so I think right now it might be
time<00:03:37.110> for<00:03:37.170> a<00:03:37.470> change<00:03:37.709> because<00:03:38.400> as<00:03:39.180> you<00:03:39.330> can<00:03:39.360> see

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
time for a change because as you can see

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.420 
time for a change because as you can see
I've<00:03:39.959> been<00:03:40.410> playing<00:03:40.590> a<00:03:40.830> little<00:03:40.950> bit<00:03:41.160> more<00:03:41.280> see

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
I've been playing a little bit more see

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:45.410 
I've been playing a little bit more see
you<00:03:41.489> again<00:03:41.940> I<00:03:42.150> actually<00:03:42.989> did<00:03:43.590> that<00:03:43.620> um<00:03:44.420> pretty

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
you again I actually did that um pretty

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:46.940 
you again I actually did that um pretty
much<00:03:45.510> a<00:03:45.660> year<00:03:45.870> ago<00:03:45.959> and<00:03:46.290> I<00:03:46.350> want<00:03:46.530> to<00:03:46.590> get<00:03:46.709> more

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
much a year ago and I want to get more

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:48.229 
much a year ago and I want to get more
into<00:03:47.130> it<00:03:47.190> and<00:03:47.370> I've<00:03:47.580> actually<00:03:47.850> almost

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
into it and I've actually almost

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:50.960 
into it and I've actually almost
switched<00:03:48.750> to<00:03:48.930> it<00:03:49.100> and<00:03:50.100> right<00:03:50.280> now<00:03:50.400> I<00:03:50.430> really<00:03:50.820> do

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
switched to it and right now I really do

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:52.190 
switched to it and right now I really do
feel<00:03:51.000> like<00:03:51.450> I<00:03:51.630> should<00:03:51.870> have<00:03:51.959> done<00:03:52.170> that

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
feel like I should have done that

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.760 
feel like I should have done that
because<00:03:53.030> like<00:03:54.030> Cisco<00:03:54.900> even<00:03:55.140> though<00:03:55.260> when<00:03:55.650> you

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:55.770 
because like Cisco even though when you

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:57.140 
because like Cisco even though when you
lose<00:03:55.950> competitive<00:03:56.430> matches<00:03:56.580> and<00:03:56.820> stuff<00:03:56.940> I

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
lose competitive matches and stuff I

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.380 
lose competitive matches and stuff I
have<00:03:57.840> fun<00:03:58.080> and<00:03:58.230> fun<00:03:58.860> with<00:03:59.010> it<00:03:59.160> and<00:03:59.340> I<00:03:59.550> think

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
have fun and fun with it and I think

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:01.760 
have fun and fun with it and I think
that<00:04:00.510> lots<00:04:00.780> of<00:04:00.870> you<00:04:00.989> guys<00:04:01.140> really<00:04:01.380> noticed

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:01.770 
that lots of you guys really noticed

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:03.410 
that lots of you guys really noticed
when<00:04:01.950> I<00:04:01.980> was<00:04:02.220> not<00:04:02.430> having<00:04:02.610> lots<00:04:02.880> of<00:04:03.000> fun<00:04:03.060> with

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 
when I was not having lots of fun with

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:05.030 
when I was not having lots of fun with
like<00:04:03.600> making<00:04:03.930> videos<00:04:03.959> with<00:04:04.260> battlefield<00:04:04.739> 4

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
like making videos with battlefield 4

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.460 
like making videos with battlefield 4
and<00:04:05.280> I<00:04:06.270> think<00:04:06.690> if<00:04:06.900> you're<00:04:07.020> a<00:04:07.050> content<00:04:07.440> creator

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
and I think if you're a content creator

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.740 
and I think if you're a content creator
you<00:04:07.830> should<00:04:07.980> not<00:04:08.130> really<00:04:08.370> do<00:04:08.550> that<00:04:08.790> I<00:04:08.970> don't

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
you should not really do that I don't

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:12.020 
you should not really do that I don't
know<00:04:09.810> if<00:04:09.900> like<00:04:10.050> Omar<00:04:10.560> over<00:04:11.010> dramatizing<00:04:11.790> it

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
know if like Omar over dramatizing it

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.390 
know if like Omar over dramatizing it
right<00:04:12.209> now<00:04:12.330> but<00:04:12.510> I<00:04:13.470> think<00:04:14.040> you<00:04:14.100> get<00:04:14.220> what<00:04:14.280> I

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
right now but I think you get what I

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.340 
right now but I think you get what I
mean<00:04:14.459> because<00:04:15.060> like<00:04:15.600> many<00:04:15.900> of<00:04:16.109> you<00:04:16.200> guys

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.350
