drifblim<00:01:13.770> it<00:01:14.159> has<00:01:14.340> like<00:01:14.610> 80<00:01:15.000> base<00:01:15.330> speed<00:01:15.600> or

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
drifblim it has like 80 base speed or

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.840 
drifblim it has like 80 base speed or
something<00:01:16.020> like<00:01:16.110> that<00:01:16.170> so<00:01:16.979> it<00:01:17.130> is<00:01:17.220> slower<00:01:17.520> so

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
something like that so it is slower so

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.160 
something like that so it is slower so
it<00:01:17.970> does<00:01:18.090> tell<00:01:18.270> me<00:01:18.360> he's<00:01:18.509> scarf<00:01:18.780> so<00:01:18.960> I<00:01:18.990> go<00:01:19.140> to

is a definite kill on a drift Blum even
with<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.170> massive<00:01:31.740> HP<00:01:32.159> SAT<00:01:32.460> and<00:01:32.869> after<00:01:33.869> Matt

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
with the massive HP SAT and after Matt

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.359 
with the massive HP SAT and after Matt
didn't<00:01:34.259> really<00:01:34.470> matter<00:01:34.619> because<00:01:34.860> I<00:01:35.100> think

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
didn't really matter because I think

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.039 
didn't really matter because I think
life<00:01:35.549> for<00:01:35.790> ba<00:01:36.030> would<00:01:36.270> have<00:01:36.390> killed<00:01:36.540> me<00:01:36.689> anyway

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
life for ba would have killed me anyway

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.300 
life for ba would have killed me anyway
I<00:01:37.079> was<00:01:37.350> in<00:01:37.439> pay<00:01:37.560> attention<00:01:37.860> to<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.040> numbers

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
I was in pay attention to the numbers

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.100 
I was in pay attention to the numbers
there<00:01:38.490> but<00:01:39.210> anyway<00:01:39.600> I'm<00:01:39.720> going<00:01:39.780> to<00:01:39.869> bring<00:01:39.990> in

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
there but anyway I'm going to bring in

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.990 
there but anyway I'm going to bring in
my<00:01:40.229> lamp<00:01:40.470> for<00:01:40.560> time<00:01:40.890> protecting<00:01:41.250> him<00:01:41.640> to<00:01:41.880> bring

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
my lamp for time protecting him to bring

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.080 
my lamp for time protecting him to bring
in<00:01:42.090> his<00:01:42.210> Sharpedo<00:01:42.630> but<00:01:43.590> he<00:01:44.250> does<00:01:44.490> not<00:01:44.670> do<00:01:44.939> that

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
in his Sharpedo but he does not do that

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.609 
in his Sharpedo but he does not do that
so<00:01:45.509> I'm<00:01:45.600> going<00:01:45.630> to<00:01:45.810> show<00:01:45.899> it<00:01:45.960> out<00:01:46.079> to<00:01:46.200> my<00:01:46.380> hip

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
so I'm going to show it out to my hip

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.039 
so I'm going to show it out to my hip
now<00:01:46.799> fearing<00:01:47.759> the<00:01:47.939> sleep<00:01:48.149> powder<00:01:48.360> because<00:01:48.960> I

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
now fearing the sleep powder because I

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.480 
now fearing the sleep powder because I
definitely<00:01:49.200> can't<00:01:49.560> get<00:01:49.710> my<00:01:49.829> cleric<00:01:50.220> put<00:01:50.399> to

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
definitely can't get my cleric put to

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:51.620 
definitely can't get my cleric put to
sleep<00:01:50.610> which<00:01:50.880> is<00:01:51.000> going<00:01:51.090> to<00:01:51.149> be<00:01:51.210> good<00:01:51.360> for<00:01:51.509> me

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
sleep which is going to be good for me

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.359 
sleep which is going to be good for me
gonna<00:01:52.200> go<00:01:52.320> for<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.530> t-wave<00:01:52.860> on<00:01:53.040> the<00:01:53.130> switch

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
gonna go for the t-wave on the switch

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.120 
gonna go for the t-wave on the switch
but<00:01:53.670> he<00:01:53.850> goes<00:01:54.030> to<00:01:54.210> a<00:01:54.240> rock-type<00:01:54.630> so<00:01:55.229> both<00:01:55.890> of<00:01:55.920> us

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
but he goes to a rock-type so both of us

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.530 
but he goes to a rock-type so both of us
are<00:01:56.250> making<00:01:56.490> some<00:01:56.640> pretty<00:01:56.820> good<00:01:57.030> predictions

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
are making some pretty good predictions

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.569 
are making some pretty good predictions
based<00:01:57.719> on<00:01:57.960> statuses<00:01:58.500> I'm<00:01:58.890> gonna<00:01:59.219> go<00:01:59.340> for<00:01:59.520> the

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
based on statuses I'm gonna go for the

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.190 
based on statuses I'm gonna go for the
protect<00:01:59.969> just<00:02:00.360> to<00:02:00.450> scout<00:02:00.689> what<00:02:00.840> he<00:02:00.899> wants<00:02:01.140> to

protect just to scout what he wants to
do<00:02:01.409> I<00:02:01.619> don't<00:02:02.579> think<00:02:02.729> he's<00:02:02.850> going<00:02:03.000> to<00:02:03.090> want<00:02:03.240> to

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
do I don't think he's going to want to

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.660 
do I don't think he's going to want to
rock<00:02:03.899> polish<00:02:04.320> too<00:02:04.770> early<00:02:05.189> or<00:02:05.219> anything<00:02:05.640> like

that now the fact that I see life orb on
this<00:02:08.819> guy<00:02:09.209> makes<00:02:09.569> me<00:02:09.690> think<00:02:09.899> that<00:02:09.989> he

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
this guy makes me think that he

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.450 
this guy makes me think that he
definitely<00:02:10.500> is

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:11.460 
definitely is

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:14.750

a rock polisher so I know he's going to

fact of the matter is I know I can't

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:35.630 
fact of the matter is I know I can't

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
take two more hits from this thing so

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.310 
take two more hits from this thing so
rather<00:02:35.790> than<00:02:36.030> trying<00:02:36.300> to<00:02:36.510> wish<00:02:36.720> and<00:02:36.990> do<00:02:37.110> some

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
rather than trying to wish and do some

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.200 
rather than trying to wish and do some
shenanigans<00:02:37.530> like<00:02:37.890> that<00:02:38.010> I'm<00:02:38.610> just<00:02:38.970> going<00:02:39.150> to

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.210 
shenanigans like that I'm just going to

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.000 
shenanigans like that I'm just going to
go<00:02:39.330> for<00:02:39.510> the<00:02:39.540> estás<00:02:39.990> hoping<00:02:40.380> at<00:02:40.500> he<00:02:40.680> will<00:02:40.830> dies

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
go for the estás hoping at he will dies

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.250 
go for the estás hoping at he will dies
life<00:02:41.400> or<00:02:41.640> work<00:02:41.760> while<00:02:42.000> on<00:02:42.300> the<00:02:42.810> finishing<00:02:43.110> blow

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
life or work while on the finishing blow

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.130 
life or work while on the finishing blow
and<00:02:43.800> it<00:02:44.460> gets<00:02:44.610> him<00:02:44.760> to<00:02:44.820> a<00:02:44.910> pretty<00:02:45.330> low<00:02:45.600> amount

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
and it gets him to a pretty low amount

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.020 
and it gets him to a pretty low amount
so<00:02:46.500> I'm<00:02:46.650> hoping<00:02:47.040> that<00:02:47.190> that<00:02:47.310> will<00:02:47.340> be<00:02:47.700> enough

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
so I'm hoping that that will be enough

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.910 
so I'm hoping that that will be enough
to<00:02:48.150> take<00:02:48.300> him<00:02:48.450> out<00:02:48.570> it<00:02:49.050> does<00:02:49.470> look<00:02:49.500> to<00:02:49.890> be

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
to take him out it does look to be

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.890 
to take him out it does look to be
enough<00:02:50.190> to<00:02:50.310> take<00:02:50.460> him<00:02:50.610> out<00:02:50.700> he<00:02:51.390> got<00:02:51.570> the<00:02:51.720> burn

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
enough to take him out he got the burn

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.540 
enough to take him out he got the burn
didn't<00:02:52.380> really<00:02:52.500> matter<00:02:52.740> to<00:02:52.980> be<00:02:53.100> honest<00:02:53.370> with

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550 
didn't really matter to be honest with

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:55.280 
didn't really matter to be honest with
you<00:02:53.700> although<00:02:54.570> I<00:02:54.600> think<00:02:54.840> he<00:02:54.900> got<00:02:55.020> a<00:02:55.050> special

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
you although I think he got a special

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.080 
you although I think he got a special
defense<00:02:55.650> drop<00:02:55.920> which<00:02:56.220> kind<00:02:56.550> of<00:02:56.640> mattered<00:02:56.910> but

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
defense drop which kind of mattered but

hypnosis<00:03:58.350> was<00:03:58.740> a<00:03:58.770> pretty<00:03:58.950> good<00:03:59.040> play<00:03:59.130> on<00:03:59.280> his

00:03:59.480 --> 00:03:59.490 
hypnosis was a pretty good play on his

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:02.090 
hypnosis was a pretty good play on his
part<00:03:59.750> unfortunately<00:04:00.750> for<00:04:00.780> him<00:04:01.020> bug<00:04:01.350> buzz<00:04:01.590> did

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.100 
part unfortunately for him bug buzz did

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:04.220 
part unfortunately for him bug buzz did
appear<00:04:02.400> to<00:04:02.550> be<00:04:02.670> a<00:04:02.700> two-hit<00:04:03.030> kale<00:04:03.270> based<00:04:03.990> on<00:04:04.140> the

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
appear to be a two-hit kale based on the

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.200 
appear to be a two-hit kale based on the
original<00:04:04.350> damage<00:04:04.980> it's<00:04:05.520> really<00:04:06.000> close

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:06.210 
original damage it's really close

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:09.380 
original damage it's really close
probably<00:04:06.630> dependent<00:04:07.080> on<00:04:07.170> max<00:04:07.410> and<00:04:07.620> min<00:04:07.800> so<00:04:08.610> you

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:09.390 
probably dependent on max and min so you

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:11.060 
probably dependent on max and min so you
know<00:04:09.510> if<00:04:10.200> I<00:04:10.350> hadn't<00:04:10.650> killed<00:04:10.800> him<00:04:10.890> he<00:04:11.010> probably

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:11.070 
know if I hadn't killed him he probably

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:13.160 
know if I hadn't killed him he probably
could<00:04:11.370> have<00:04:11.400> gotten<00:04:11.580> estás<00:04:12.030> off<00:04:12.300> which<00:04:12.990> would

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.170 
could have gotten estás off which would

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:14.900 
could have gotten estás off which would
have<00:04:13.230> made<00:04:13.440> his<00:04:13.740> life<00:04:13.920> quite<00:04:14.610> a<00:04:14.640> bit<00:04:14.880> easier

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910 
have made his life quite a bit easier

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:16.520 
have made his life quite a bit easier
because<00:04:15.660> he<00:04:15.870> would<00:04:15.960> have<00:04:15.990> been<00:04:16.140> able<00:04:16.230> to<00:04:16.350> kill

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460 
we thought unfortunately for me his team

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:30.090 
we thought unfortunately for me his team
is<00:04:27.760> a<00:04:27.900> for<00:04:28.900> the<00:04:28.990> most<00:04:29.020> part<00:04:29.530> pretty<00:04:29.830> good

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:30.100 
is a for the most part pretty good

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:31.830 
is a for the most part pretty good
against<00:04:30.280> my<00:04:30.400> sand<00:04:30.669> /<00:04:30.910> so<00:04:31.270> I<00:04:31.300> never<00:04:31.389> really<00:04:31.570> got

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:31.840 
against my sand / so I never really got

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:33.390 
against my sand / so I never really got
a<00:04:31.870> chance<00:04:31.960> to<00:04:32.290> bring<00:04:32.410> it<00:04:32.590> and<00:04:32.770> get<00:04:32.919> rocks<00:04:33.160> up

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:33.400 
a chance to bring it and get rocks up

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.400 
a chance to bring it and get rocks up
that<00:04:33.970> was<00:04:34.090> probably<00:04:34.210> a<00:04:34.419> mistake<00:04:34.449> on<00:04:34.900> my<00:04:34.930> part<00:04:35.080> I

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:35.410 
that was probably a mistake on my part I

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:36.930 
that was probably a mistake on my part I
probably<00:04:35.620> should<00:04:35.860> have<00:04:35.919> brought<00:04:36.100> Sam<00:04:36.370> /<00:04:36.639> in<00:04:36.820> on

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:36.940 
probably should have brought Sam / in on

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:39.510 
probably should have brought Sam / in on
that<00:04:37.060> original<00:04:37.630> double<00:04:37.960> down<00:04:38.139> just<00:04:39.010> to<00:04:39.130> set<00:04:39.430> up

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.520 
that original double down just to set up

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:42.120 
that original double down just to set up
rocks<00:04:39.790> for<00:04:40.570> the<00:04:40.600> Sharpedo<00:04:41.020> but<00:04:41.710> as<00:04:41.860> I<00:04:42.010> already

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:42.130 
rocks for the Sharpedo but as I already

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:43.439 
rocks for the Sharpedo but as I already
said<00:04:42.250> I<00:04:42.430> thought<00:04:42.669> Sharpedo<00:04:43.060> was<00:04:43.210> the<00:04:43.330> one

00:04:43.439 --> 00:04:43.449 
said I thought Sharpedo was the one

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:47.159 
said I thought Sharpedo was the one
coming<00:04:43.660> in<00:04:43.900> so<00:04:44.650> yeah<00:04:45.310> I<00:04:45.610> do<00:04:46.479> just<00:04:46.780> finish<00:04:47.020> him

down<00:05:25.270> low<00:05:25.510> enough<00:05:25.630> where<00:05:25.930> I<00:05:25.960> can<00:05:26.020> sub<00:05:26.350> into

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:26.620 
down low enough where I can sub into

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:29.690 
down low enough where I can sub into
pitaya<00:05:26.919> and<00:05:28.020> hopefully<00:05:29.020> kill<00:05:29.229> him<00:05:29.380> off

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:29.700 
pitaya and hopefully kill him off

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:32.760 
pitaya and hopefully kill him off
unfortunately<00:05:30.700> he<00:05:30.850> is<00:05:30.880> a<00:05:31.030> rest<00:05:31.539> muck<00:05:31.900> luckily

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:32.770 
unfortunately he is a rest muck luckily

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:34.920 
unfortunately he is a rest muck luckily
for<00:05:32.979> me<00:05:33.070> he's<00:05:33.190> not<00:05:33.220> a<00:05:33.340> rest<00:05:33.550> talking<00:05:34.060> muck<00:05:34.270> but

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:34.930 
for me he's not a rest talking muck but

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:38.070 
for me he's not a rest talking muck but
he<00:05:35.050> is<00:05:35.169> a<00:05:35.200> rest<00:05:35.470> muck<00:05:35.710> and<00:05:36.270> I<00:05:37.270> think<00:05:37.780> if<00:05:37.930> his

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:38.080 
he is a rest muck and I think if his

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:40.740 
he is a rest muck and I think if his
curse<00:05:38.350> were<00:05:38.590> actually<00:05:39.039> sleep<00:05:39.669> talking<00:05:40.120> it

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:40.750 
curse were actually sleep talking it

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:42.300 
curse were actually sleep talking it
would<00:05:40.930> have<00:05:41.020> been<00:05:41.050> more<00:05:41.500> problematic<00:05:42.070> for<00:05:42.190> my

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:42.310 
would have been more problematic for my

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:43.980 
would have been more problematic for my
team<00:05:42.490> but<00:05:43.000> now<00:05:43.180> that<00:05:43.330> he's<00:05:43.419> asleep<00:05:43.750> I'm<00:05:43.900> gonna

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:43.990 
team but now that he's asleep I'm gonna

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:45.360 
team but now that he's asleep I'm gonna
go<00:05:44.169> into<00:05:44.320> Cooper<00:05:44.590> troop<00:05:44.770> just<00:05:45.039> go<00:05:45.130> for<00:05:45.310> the

against<00:05:53.889> his<00:05:54.070> dude<00:05:54.370> and<00:05:55.270> then<00:05:55.450> double<00:05:55.840> switch

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:56.080 
against his dude and then double switch

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:58.620 
against his dude and then double switch
will<00:05:56.860> not<00:05:57.010> switch<00:05:57.280> I<00:05:57.550> guess<00:05:57.729> we<00:05:58.030> both<00:05:58.210> switched

00:05:58.620 --> 00:05:58.630

will not switch I guess we both switched
which<00:05:58.900> makes<00:05:59.080> it<00:05:59.139> a<00:05:59.229> double<00:05:59.380> switch<00:05:59.590> if<00:05:59.770> you

00:05:59.850 --> 00:05:59.860
