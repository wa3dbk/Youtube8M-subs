00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.879 
Explorer that we're replacing for my
daughter<00:00:11.849> we're<00:00:12.240> actually<00:00:12.540> fixing<00:00:13.469> it<00:00:13.559> up<00:00:13.679> and

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
daughter we're actually fixing it up and

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:15.740 
daughter we're actually fixing it up and
building<00:00:14.130> it<00:00:14.250> up<00:00:14.309> what<00:00:15.179> we<00:00:15.299> do<00:00:15.389> is<00:00:15.450> we<00:00:15.570> bought<00:00:15.690> a

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
building it up what we do is we bought a

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.960 
building it up what we do is we bought a
brand<00:00:16.049> new<00:00:16.109> solenoid<00:00:16.650> and<00:00:17.250> you<00:00:17.430> can<00:00:17.550> see<00:00:17.670> it's

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
brand new solenoid and you can see it's

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.609 
brand new solenoid and you can see it's
pot<00:00:18.270> number<00:00:18.690> s<00:00:19.289> five<00:00:19.859> zero<00:00:20.490> four<00:00:20.939> nine<00:00:21.000> Z<00:00:21.900> it's

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
pot number s five zero four nine Z it's

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.509 
pot number s five zero four nine Z it's
a<00:00:22.740> solenoid<00:00:23.150> from<00:00:24.150> bwd<00:00:24.980> it's<00:00:25.980> a<00:00:26.099> factory

a solenoid from bwd it's a factory

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.820 
a solenoid from bwd it's a factory
solenoid<00:00:27.680> comes<00:00:28.680> in<00:00:28.800> a<00:00:28.890> package<00:00:30.650> and<00:00:31.650> what

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
solenoid comes in a package and what

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.549 
solenoid comes in a package and what
we're<00:00:31.949> going<00:00:32.099> to<00:00:32.130> do<00:00:32.989> take<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.110> old<00:00:34.260> one<00:00:34.410> off

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
we're going to do take the old one off

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.340 
we're going to do take the old one off
put<00:00:35.280> the<00:00:35.370> new<00:00:35.520> one<00:00:35.640> on<00:00:35.989> because<00:00:36.989> we're<00:00:37.200> having

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
put the new one on because we're having

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.850 
put the new one on because we're having
a<00:00:37.410> problem<00:00:37.620> start<00:00:37.980> in<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.190> vehicle<00:00:38.610> so<00:00:39.860> take

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
a problem start in the vehicle so take

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.709 
a problem start in the vehicle so take
us<00:00:40.890> a<00:00:41.010> couple<00:00:41.250> minutes<00:00:41.340> and<00:00:41.700> we're<00:00:42.570> going<00:00:42.690> to

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
us a couple minutes and we're going to

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.770 
us a couple minutes and we're going to
show<00:00:42.870> you<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:43.079> solenoid<00:00:44.510> basically<00:00:45.510> what<00:00:45.690> you

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
show you the solenoid basically what you

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.190 
show you the solenoid basically what you
want<00:00:45.989> to<00:00:46.050> do<00:00:46.640> is<00:00:47.750> you<00:00:48.750> want<00:00:48.870> to<00:00:48.899> take<00:00:49.020> off<00:00:49.170> your

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
want to do is you want to take off your

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.520 
want to do is you want to take off your
positive<00:00:50.190> battery<00:00:50.910> cable<00:00:51.120> right<00:00:51.600> here<00:00:51.660> the

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
positive battery cable right here the

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.500 
positive battery cable right here the
positive<00:00:52.980> battery<00:00:53.100> cable<00:00:53.370> runs<00:00:54.149> into<00:00:54.390> the

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
positive battery cable runs into the

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.830 
positive battery cable runs into the
celluloid<00:00:54.930> on<00:00:55.170> Ford's<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:56.160> solenoid<00:00:56.730> is<00:00:57.000> up

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
celluloid on Ford's the solenoid is up

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.810 
celluloid on Ford's the solenoid is up
on<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.109> firewall<00:00:58.590> versus<00:00:59.070> down<00:00:59.280> on<00:00:59.460> the<00:00:59.550> stata

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
on the firewall versus down on the stata

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.910 
on the firewall versus down on the stata
so<00:01:00.750> we're<00:01:00.899> going<00:01:00.989> to<00:01:01.079> replace<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.469> Silliman

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
so we're going to replace the Silliman

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.740 
so we're going to replace the Silliman
right<00:01:02.070> here<00:01:02.370> and<00:01:03.030> once<00:01:03.239> we<00:01:03.329> replace<00:01:03.600> the

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
right here and once we replace the

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.660 
right here and once we replace the
solenoid<00:01:04.260> hopefully<00:01:05.040> we<00:01:05.159> should<00:01:05.189> have<00:01:05.430> no

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
solenoid hopefully we should have no

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.399 
solenoid hopefully we should have no
problem<00:01:06.000> starting<00:01:06.390> we're<00:01:07.020> also<00:01:07.140> going<00:01:07.350> to

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
problem starting we're also going to

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:08.870 
problem starting we're also going to
check<00:01:07.470> some<00:01:08.010> of<00:01:08.100> these<00:01:08.189> wires<00:01:08.460> up<00:01:08.729> here

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
check some of these wires up here

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.750 
check some of these wires up here
because<00:01:09.030> Y<00:01:09.390> is<00:01:09.450> on<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:10.049> positive<00:01:10.530> cable<00:01:10.770> are<00:01:11.700> a

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
because Y is on the positive cable are a

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.719 
because Y is on the positive cable are a
little<00:01:12.000> bit<00:01:12.180> frayed<00:01:12.710> so<00:01:13.710> we're<00:01:14.369> going<00:01:14.490> to<00:01:14.549> give

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
little bit frayed so we're going to give

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.999 
little bit frayed so we're going to give
it<00:01:14.850> a<00:01:15.030> couple<00:01:15.780> minutes<00:01:16.020> we'll<00:01:16.680> pull<00:01:16.890> this

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
it a couple minutes we'll pull this

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.160 
it a couple minutes we'll pull this
battery<00:01:17.369> cable<00:01:17.670> off<00:01:17.820> get<00:01:18.299> these<00:01:18.479> Y's<00:01:18.689> in<00:01:18.990> good

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
battery cable off get these Y's in good

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.280 
battery cable off get these Y's in good
shape<00:01:19.380> once<00:01:19.950> a<00:01:20.070> wires<00:01:20.280> are<00:01:20.490> in<00:01:20.549> good<00:01:20.670> shape<00:01:21.290> we

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
shape once a wires are in good shape we

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.810 
shape once a wires are in good shape we
should<00:01:22.439> have<00:01:22.530> no<00:01:22.680> problems<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.220> cash<00:01:23.430> we<00:01:23.670> be

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
should have no problems the cash we be

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:29.740 
should have no problems the cash we be
starting<00:01:24.299> perfect<00:01:26.540> okay<00:01:27.740> let's<00:01:28.740> start<00:01:28.979> off<00:01:29.159> by

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750 
starting perfect okay let's start off by

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.890 
starting perfect okay let's start off by
disconnecting<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:31.049> power<00:01:31.920> and<00:01:32.430> I<00:01:32.549> said<00:01:32.900> the

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
disconnecting the power and I said the

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.660 
disconnecting the power and I said the
power<00:01:34.170> on<00:01:34.650> these<00:01:34.950> area<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:35.820> 1/2<00:01:36.000> inch<00:01:36.240> of<00:01:36.329> 7/16

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 
power on these area the 1/2 inch of 7/16

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.130 
power on these area the 1/2 inch of 7/16
instead<00:01:38.670> of<00:01:38.759> taking<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.119> cable<00:01:39.329> off<00:01:39.689> what

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
instead of taking the cable off what

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.140 
instead of taking the cable off what
we're<00:01:40.229> going<00:01:40.380> to<00:01:40.409> do<00:01:40.700> is<00:01:41.700> we're<00:01:41.850> going<00:01:41.880> to<00:01:42.000> just

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
we're going to do is we're going to just

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.429 
we're going to do is we're going to just
connect<00:01:42.450> it<00:01:42.540> up<00:01:42.600> here<00:01:42.810> because<00:01:42.960> we<00:01:43.200> have<00:01:43.320> to

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
connect it up here because we have to

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.100 
connect it up here because we have to
change<00:01:43.710> these<00:01:43.860> wires<00:01:44.130> anyways<00:01:44.869> so<00:01:45.869> it's<00:01:45.990> going

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
change these wires anyways so it's going

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.350 
change these wires anyways so it's going
to<00:01:46.200> give<00:01:46.290> it<00:01:46.380> a<00:01:46.409> quick<00:01:47.750> disconnect<00:01:48.750> up<00:01:49.110> here

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
to give it a quick disconnect up here

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.600 

that<00:01:51.990> way<00:01:52.170> there's<00:01:52.380> no<00:01:52.410> power<00:01:52.800> going<00:01:53.100> into<00:01:53.310> it

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
that way there's no power going into it

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.440 
that way there's no power going into it
and<00:01:53.790> we<00:01:53.850> won't<00:01:54.000> have<00:01:54.090> any<00:01:54.240> problems<00:01:54.720> as<00:01:54.960> far<00:01:55.290> as

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
and we won't have any problems as far as

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:05.390 
and we won't have any problems as far as
its<00:01:57.450> shorting<00:01:57.930> out<00:01:58.050> we<00:01:58.800> get<00:01:58.980> executed<00:02:04.400> you

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:05.400 
its shorting out we get executed you

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.940 
its shorting out we get executed you
changing<00:02:05.820> a<00:02:05.880> solenoid<00:02:06.410> it's<00:02:07.410> important<00:02:07.920> that

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
changing a solenoid it's important that

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.850 
changing a solenoid it's important that
you<00:02:08.160> remember<00:02:08.960> which<00:02:09.960> side<00:02:10.170> is<00:02:10.410> which<00:02:10.590> because

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
you remember which side is which because

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.880 
you remember which side is which because
Ford<00:02:11.550> when<00:02:12.030> they<00:02:12.150> have<00:02:12.540> four<00:02:13.200> solenoids<00:02:13.740> are

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
Ford when they have four solenoids are

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.610 
Ford when they have four solenoids are
basically<00:02:14.340> pretty<00:02:14.910> much<00:02:15.120> all<00:02:15.300> the<00:02:15.390> same<00:02:15.630> but

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
basically pretty much all the same but

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.260 
basically pretty much all the same but
they<00:02:16.770> have<00:02:16.800> different<00:02:19.730> parts<00:02:20.730> where<00:02:21.000> the

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
they have different parts where the

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:22.880 
they have different parts where the
wires<00:02:21.630> connect<00:02:22.140> so<00:02:22.320> you<00:02:22.410> want<00:02:22.590> to<00:02:22.650> be<00:02:22.709> sure

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
wires connect so you want to be sure

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.290 
wires connect so you want to be sure
that<00:02:23.040> you<00:02:23.100> get<00:02:23.220> your<00:02:23.370> wires<00:02:23.580> cut<00:02:23.910> in<00:02:24.120> the

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
that you get your wires cut in the

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.910 
that you get your wires cut in the
proper<00:02:24.780> places<00:02:26.120> do<00:02:27.120> you<00:02:27.270> the<00:02:27.450> socket<00:02:27.920> get

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
proper places do you the socket get

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.720 
proper places do you the socket get
stuck<00:02:29.610> in<00:02:29.760> a<00:02:29.880> is<00:02:30.030> give<00:02:30.239> it<00:02:30.270> a<00:02:30.450> couple<00:02:30.780> caps<00:02:31.080> and

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
stuck in a is give it a couple caps and

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:37.190 
stuck in a is give it a couple caps and
another<00:02:32.730> usually<00:02:32.970> fall<00:02:33.390> out<00:02:33.680> there<00:02:34.680> we<00:02:34.770> go<00:02:36.200> now

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
another usually fall out there we go now

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.540 
another usually fall out there we go now
like<00:02:37.350> I<00:02:37.440> said<00:02:37.620> it's<00:02:37.709> very<00:02:37.890> important<00:02:38.340> to<00:02:38.400> make

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
like I said it's very important to make

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.130 
like I said it's very important to make
sure<00:02:38.670> that<00:02:38.790> we<00:02:38.910> have<00:02:39.030> all<00:02:39.060> these<00:02:39.510> wires<00:02:39.810> in

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
sure that we have all these wires in

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.860 
sure that we have all these wires in
here<00:02:40.350> but<00:02:40.860> they<00:02:40.980> go<00:02:41.130> back<00:02:41.370> on<00:02:41.640> the<00:02:42.420> proper

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
here but they go back on the proper

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:51.229 
here but they go back on the proper
position<00:02:43.650> of<00:02:43.860> the<00:02:44.400> other<00:02:44.520> solenoid<00:02:49.459> okay<00:02:50.459> what

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
position of the other solenoid okay what

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:52.610 
position of the other solenoid okay what
we<00:02:51.360> did<00:02:51.540> is<00:02:51.690> we<00:02:51.720> just<00:02:51.900> connected<00:02:52.470> all<00:02:52.590> the

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
we did is we just connected all the

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.699 
we did is we just connected all the
wires<00:02:52.800> a<00:02:53.070> solenoid<00:02:53.400> and<00:02:53.790> basically<00:02:54.780> this

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
wires a solenoid and basically this

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:58.520 
wires a solenoid and basically this
solenoid<00:02:56.870> which<00:02:57.870> going<00:02:58.049> to<00:02:58.110> take<00:02:58.200> the<00:02:58.290> wires

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
solenoid which going to take the wires

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.370 
solenoid which going to take the wires
and<00:02:59.340> separate<00:02:59.910> them<00:03:00.060> put<00:03:00.660> them<00:03:00.780> directly<00:03:01.140> onto

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
and separate them put them directly onto

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:07.699 
and separate them put them directly onto
the<00:03:01.590> cylinder<00:03:02.959> without<00:03:03.959> having<00:03:06.290> any<00:03:07.290> chance

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
the cylinder without having any chance

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:12.190 
the cylinder without having any chance
of<00:03:08.430> the<00:03:09.060> wires<00:03:10.519> getting<00:03:11.519> in<00:03:11.640> the<00:03:11.700> wrong<00:03:11.880> place

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
of the wires getting in the wrong place

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.690 
of the wires getting in the wrong place
towards<00:03:13.200> of<00:03:13.320> known<00:03:13.709> for<00:03:13.860> having<00:03:14.100> problems

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
towards of known for having problems

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.850 
towards of known for having problems
with<00:03:14.760> this<00:03:14.940> solenoid<00:03:18.380> I've<00:03:19.380> had<00:03:19.560> a<00:03:19.590> lot<00:03:19.830> of

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
with this solenoid I've had a lot of

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:22.370 
with this solenoid I've had a lot of
Fords<00:03:20.310> and<00:03:20.400> unfortunately<00:03:21.120> this<00:03:21.840> is<00:03:22.049> a<00:03:22.080> weak

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
Fords and unfortunately this is a weak

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:26.990 
Fords and unfortunately this is a weak
spot<00:03:22.590> on<00:03:22.980> the<00:03:23.160> Ford<00:03:23.989> so<00:03:24.989> we're<00:03:25.500> going<00:03:25.620> to<00:03:26.000> give

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
spot on the Ford so we're going to give

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.170 
spot on the Ford so we're going to give
it<00:03:27.030> a<00:03:27.150> way<00:03:27.480> it<00:03:27.540> up<00:03:27.780> and<00:03:27.989> get<00:03:28.140> it<00:03:28.230> all<00:03:28.350> fixed<00:03:28.680> and

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
it a way it up and get it all fixed and

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.690 
it a way it up and get it all fixed and
once<00:03:30.180> you<00:03:30.330> have<00:03:30.420> it<00:03:30.510> all<00:03:30.600> fixed<00:03:31.430> we<00:03:32.430> should

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
once you have it all fixed we should

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.610 
once you have it all fixed we should
have<00:03:32.880> no<00:03:33.000> problems<00:03:33.510> the<00:03:34.110> other<00:03:34.230> problems<00:03:34.590> that

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
have no problems the other problems that

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.880 
have no problems the other problems that
Ford<00:03:34.920> have<00:03:35.160> is<00:03:35.459> underneath<00:03:36.269> the<00:03:36.390> column<00:03:36.890> there

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
Ford have is underneath the column there

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:42.140 
Ford have is underneath the column there
is<00:03:38.100> a<00:03:38.420> pin<00:03:39.420> that<00:03:39.870> I<00:03:40.459> simply<00:03:41.459> when<00:03:41.700> you<00:03:41.790> turn<00:03:42.030> the

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
is a pin that I simply when you turn the

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.870 
is a pin that I simply when you turn the
key<00:03:42.360> it<00:03:42.600> actually<00:03:42.930> slides<00:03:43.260> on<00:03:43.709> and<00:03:44.130> tells<00:03:44.790> it

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
key it actually slides on and tells it

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.030 
key it actually slides on and tells it
when<00:03:45.060> decide<00:03:45.450> you<00:03:46.049> know<00:03:46.110> what<00:03:46.530> position<00:03:46.950> the

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
when decide you know what position the

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.030 
when decide you know what position the
key<00:03:47.250> is<00:03:47.370> on<00:03:47.549> Oh<00:03:48.230> we've<00:03:49.230> tested<00:03:49.530> it<00:03:49.829> and<00:03:49.950> we

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
key is on Oh we've tested it and we

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.350 
key is on Oh we've tested it and we
think<00:03:50.220> that<00:03:50.280> the<00:03:50.430> solenoid<00:03:50.820> is<00:03:50.850> open<00:03:51.239> this

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 
think that the solenoid is open this

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.390 
think that the solenoid is open this
problem<00:03:51.780> so<00:03:52.049> we'll<00:03:52.739> take<00:03:52.890> a<00:03:52.950> quick<00:03:53.190> look<00:03:53.250> you

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
problem so we'll take a quick look you

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.759 
problem so we'll take a quick look you
know<00:03:53.700> I<00:03:53.970> get<00:03:54.690> back<00:03:54.840> in<00:03:55.049> two<00:03:55.170> seconds<00:03:55.560> as<00:03:55.650> soon

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:55.769 
know I get back in two seconds as soon

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:58.820 
know I get back in two seconds as soon
as<00:03:55.829> we<00:03:55.890> get<00:03:55.980> this<00:03:56.100> all<00:03:56.280> I<00:03:56.310> soldered
