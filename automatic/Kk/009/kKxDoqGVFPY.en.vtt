00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:07.000
 Then I would like to see the details of this part, leaving the contents empty. 

00:00:11.362 --> 00:00:14.402
 Let's put out some parts 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.620
 Because the desk became smaller 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.060
 It may not be possible to line up all the parts .... 

00:00:27.013 --> 00:00:29.253
 For now, I tried to put out all the parts. 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.060
 I can not do anything on the desk anymore. 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.020
 This part was a little bothersome 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.220
 Beam saber and other beam weapons 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:41.480
 It is a part 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.160
 It's green. It looks like a fluorescent green. 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.920
 In the time of 1/144 sozaby that I made before 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.160
 This part was yellow though 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:56.180
 This time Ver.ka ... Master grade Ver.Ka is fluorescent green. 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.420
 And it is this part that is fun. 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.900
 This is the internal part of the exterior, what kind of part it is. 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.340
 Now this is silver from the beginning, but this ... 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:21.340
 How do you paint like 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:28.260
 In other models, we try various colors such as aluminum silver or titanium silver 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:34.860
 In order to paint this, there are also models that have been made to stick to metal colors in various models, 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:42.640
 This time, I can not decide how many colors to paint, but ... 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.680
 In metal color that oneself likes 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:48.840
 I hope I can paint this. 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.660
 The details of other parts are like this. 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.320
 Since launching this YouTube channel called "Gunpladan", 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:56.780
 One day I wanted to make this model, 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.700
 Somehow, get this (Sazabi Ver.ka) this time, 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.453
 You can get into production. 

00:03:02.952 --> 00:03:04.952
 I really look forward to it! 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.700
 This time is master grade, 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.600
 There is a doll of Char. 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.660
 Master grade comes with a pilot doll. 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.100
 With such a feeling, I stood and ... 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:35.180
 Wearing a pilot suit, with a sitting shah doll. 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:41.500
 If you are sitting, maybe you can put it in the cockpit. 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.880
 When I make MG (master grade), 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:50.860
 Basically, the pilot's doll, which is attached, has been ignored, 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.960
 This time, let's try to make it properly ... 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:58.320
 It seems that it is not so hard to distinguish the colors 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:01.160
 It is an ant to try. 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:05.820
 I think that part of this doll will be brush-painted ... 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.160
 Also, such a place is good, isn't it? 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.800
 This part is below "Kang! ] I'm sliding. 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:18.440
 If you slide it like this, the internal parts of the contents will be exposed. 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:23.240
 Here are the silver parts I mentioned a little while ago. 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.160
 Because this area is exposed 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.140
 If you can finish this area realistically 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:31.480
 This model is going to look cool. 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:35.700
 I am looking forward to it! 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:40.720
 That's why ... this is a desire 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.920
 MG (master grade) Sazabi Ver. Ka 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:47.000
 I want to get into production 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:52.020
 Since (previous) Neo Geong has become more than 30 videos, 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.740
 This time is ... 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:00.820
 If you are not good, you may feel that the number of videos is more than that, but 

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:06.540
 If it's ok, I'm glad if you can associate until the end. 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:12.220
 I would like to enter production next time!
