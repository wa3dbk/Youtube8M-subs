00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.150
 Hello today I show how to do it all 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:09.389
 easy on lego legs an iphone 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:14.190
 Tripod can do that you just that 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:17.509
 are holding looks with which one has 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.509
 can also lead with good 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:28.140
 But everything you need is a big one 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:34.830
 two of these individual areas 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:46.710
 they are just six times six 

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:51.870
 should be the 6 1 6 1 6 also was 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:56.610
 one still of the two times 42 of the 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.979
 two six and two out of the four times 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.500
 lonely 

00:00:57.979 --> 00:01:02.040
 First, the skeleton 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.800
 to get finished 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.700
 that looks like the land register 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.890
 looks like this 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:15.299
 and then you can have the second level 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:16.850
 bring it here and there 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.630
 moor 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:21.479
 Of course it is also important that one 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:24.600
 cable fits through it again and you 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:30.110
 then you can set the cable 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:35.990
 already connect the back wall and attach 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:35.990
 Here you put the iphone on it 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:42.330
 It's not all that good because it is 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:44.760
 Of course, this is not real and arises 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:49.080
 the iphone loaded on it as cannes 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:50.930
 you can film about it or it 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:54.420
 just have to stand nicely 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:57.590
 so because it looks tripod and you 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:00.090
 can film with it super 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:02.900
 Thank you for watching and have fun 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.900
 when reconstructing
