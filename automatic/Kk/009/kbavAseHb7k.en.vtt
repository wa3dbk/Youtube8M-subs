fraction the amount in order to make it

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.760 
fraction the amount in order to make it
fit<00:01:11.939> on<00:01:12.119> our<00:01:12.180> left<00:01:13.020> side<00:01:13.229> of<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.439> bike<00:01:13.590> the

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
fit on our left side of the bike the

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:14.990 
fit on our left side of the bike the
right<00:01:13.950> side<00:01:14.159> of<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.280> bike<00:01:14.430> it<00:01:14.549> actually<00:01:14.820> fits

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
right side of the bike it actually fits

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.719 
right side of the bike it actually fits
with<00:01:15.180> no<00:01:15.420> trimming<00:01:15.840> at<00:01:16.020> all<00:01:16.170> so<00:01:16.770> essentially

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
with no trimming at all so essentially

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.060 
with no trimming at all so essentially
this<00:01:18.390> is<00:01:18.600> replacing<00:01:19.140> a<00:01:19.290> main<00:01:19.470> engine<00:01:19.860> bolt

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
this is replacing a main engine bolt

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.980 
this is replacing a main engine bolt
which<00:01:20.250> i've<00:01:20.400> already<00:01:20.490> removed<00:01:21.060> we're<00:01:21.869> just

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
which i've already removed we're just

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.130 
which i've already removed we're just
going<00:01:22.110> to<00:01:22.170> slide<00:01:22.380> this<00:01:22.530> into<00:01:22.740> place<00:01:23.780> we<00:01:24.780> need<00:01:24.960> a

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
going to slide this into place we need a

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.440 
going to slide this into place we need a
17<00:01:25.770> mil<00:01:26.040> socket<00:01:27.110> and<00:01:28.110> we're<00:01:28.770> just<00:01:28.829> going<00:01:29.040> to

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
17 mil socket and we're just going to

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.640 
17 mil socket and we're just going to
spin<00:01:30.450> this<00:01:30.570> on<00:01:30.750> let's<00:01:31.079> just<00:01:31.170> get<00:01:31.320> this<00:01:31.470> done

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
spin this on let's just get this done

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:41.660 
spin this on let's just get this done
here<00:01:31.860> twist<00:01:40.040> so<00:01:41.040> we're<00:01:41.130> going<00:01:41.220> to<00:01:41.310> remove<00:01:41.490> this

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
here twist so we're going to remove this

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.370 
here twist so we're going to remove this

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:13.230 

and<00:02:11.620> again<00:02:11.860> just<00:02:12.490> like<00:02:12.580> the<00:02:12.700> other<00:02:12.730> side<00:02:12.910> we're

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
and again just like the other side we're

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:14.490 
and again just like the other side we're
going<00:02:13.330> to<00:02:13.390> have<00:02:13.450> to<00:02:13.600> double-check<00:02:13.930> our<00:02:14.110> torque

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
going to have to double-check our torque

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:20.460 
going to have to double-check our torque
on<00:02:14.650> this<00:02:18.750> now<00:02:19.750> that<00:02:19.930> we<00:02:20.020> have<00:02:20.140> our<00:02:20.170> crash

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
on this now that we have our crash

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.620 
on this now that we have our crash
protectors<00:02:20.980> installed<00:02:21.400> we<00:02:22.000> feel<00:02:22.180> a<00:02:22.210> lot<00:02:22.450> safer

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
protectors installed we feel a lot safer

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.060 
protectors installed we feel a lot safer
when<00:02:22.900> we<00:02:22.960> go<00:02:23.110> it<00:02:23.230> on<00:02:23.350> the<00:02:23.470> track<00:02:23.710> or<00:02:23.890> on<00:02:23.980> the

street knowing that this year will scrub
off<00:02:26.950> lots<00:02:27.220> of<00:02:27.370> speed<00:02:27.610> when<00:02:27.760> we<00:02:27.880> slide<00:02:28.090> down<00:02:28.150> and

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
off lots of speed when we slide down and

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.420 
off lots of speed when we slide down and
protect<00:02:28.840> the<00:02:28.959> frame<00:02:29.200> and<00:02:29.470> the<00:02:29.860> bodywork<00:02:30.280> from
