as<00:03:30.720> you<00:03:31.049> can<00:03:31.200> see<00:03:31.410> I<00:03:31.440> started<00:03:31.920> with<00:03:32.040> a<00:03:32.069> weight

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
as you can see I started with a weight

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.460 
as you can see I started with a weight
that<00:03:32.910> I<00:03:32.970> could<00:03:33.209> do<00:03:33.329> with<00:03:33.569> a<00:03:33.660> very<00:03:33.780> strict<00:03:34.139> form

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
that I could do with a very strict form

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:37.009 
that I could do with a very strict form
for<00:03:35.160> twelve<00:03:35.430> repetitions<00:03:35.700> and<00:03:36.299> as<00:03:36.690> you<00:03:36.840> can

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 
for twelve repetitions and as you can

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:40.610 
for twelve repetitions and as you can
see<00:03:37.200> as<00:03:37.590> I<00:03:37.920> moved<00:03:38.190> along<00:03:38.489> the<00:03:38.989> the<00:03:39.989> repetitions

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
see as I moved along the the repetitions

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.559 
see as I moved along the the repetitions
just<00:03:40.889> dropped<00:03:41.190> into<00:03:41.730> the<00:03:42.000> six<00:03:42.239> to<00:03:42.420> eight

00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:42.569 
just dropped into the six to eight

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:45.979 
just dropped into the six to eight
repetition<00:03:43.200> range<00:03:43.410> so<00:03:44.130> the<00:03:45.030> last<00:03:45.269> repetition

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
repetition range so the last repetition

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:47.870 
repetition range so the last repetition
of<00:03:46.079> the<00:03:46.290> barbell<00:03:46.650> curls<00:03:46.980> was<00:03:47.130> extremely<00:03:47.700> hard

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
of the barbell curls was extremely hard

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:49.870 
of the barbell curls was extremely hard
to<00:03:48.030> do<00:03:48.180> I<00:03:48.389> think<00:03:48.959> I<00:03:49.380> think

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:49.880 
to do I think I think

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:51.370 
to do I think I think
