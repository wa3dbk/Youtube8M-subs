to be released on android so it proves a
a<00:00:15.330> really<00:00:15.839> good<00:00:16.109> kind<00:00:16.470> of<00:00:16.619> test<00:00:17.010> throwing<00:00:17.910> the

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
a really good kind of test throwing the

a really good kind of test throwing the
latest<00:00:18.359> games<00:00:18.570> i<00:00:18.690> think<00:00:18.810> we're<00:00:18.930> also<00:00:19.020> going<00:00:19.170> to

latest games i think we're also going to

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.109 
latest games i think we're also going to
take<00:00:19.350> a<00:00:19.439> look<00:00:19.560> at<00:00:19.710> dead<00:00:19.920> trigger<00:00:20.130> 2<00:00:20.250> will<00:00:20.910> just

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
take a look at dead trigger 2 will just

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:22.609 
take a look at dead trigger 2 will just
give<00:00:21.390> her<00:00:21.480> a<00:00:21.510> little<00:00:21.689> bit<00:00:22.020> of<00:00:22.140> footage<00:00:22.410> of<00:00:22.500> this

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
give her a little bit of footage of this

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.140 
give her a little bit of footage of this
really<00:00:22.980> just<00:00:23.189> to<00:00:23.279> kind<00:00:23.490> of<00:00:23.519> get<00:00:23.640> a<00:00:23.699> feel<00:00:23.939> for

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
really just to kind of get a feel for

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.790 
really just to kind of get a feel for
how<00:00:24.269> it's<00:00:24.420> going<00:00:24.570> to<00:00:24.600> work<00:00:24.660> it's<00:00:25.230> also<00:00:25.380> papa

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
how it's going to work it's also papa

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.650 
how it's going to work it's also papa
audio<00:00:26.640> up<00:00:26.760> a<00:00:26.880> little<00:00:27.119> bit<00:00:27.269> so<00:00:27.390> you<00:00:27.449> can<00:00:27.480> get<00:00:27.599> a

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
audio up a little bit so you can get a

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.380 
audio up a little bit so you can get a
sense<00:00:27.900> from<00:00:28.050> him<00:00:28.289> soon<00:00:28.529> as<00:00:28.740> well<00:00:29.090> see<00:00:30.090> how<00:00:30.240> this

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
sense from him soon as well see how this

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.540 
sense from him soon as well see how this
place<00:00:30.660> now<00:00:31.109> on<00:00:31.560> the<00:00:31.710> Nexus<00:00:32.009> 5<00:00:32.189> when<00:00:32.430> I've

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
place now on the Nexus 5 when I've

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.490 
place now on the Nexus 5 when I've
played<00:00:33.360> this<00:00:33.480> game<00:00:33.690> I<00:00:33.840> found<00:00:34.079> it<00:00:34.170> to<00:00:34.260> be<00:00:34.290> pretty

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
played this game I found it to be pretty

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.860 
played this game I found it to be pretty
good<00:00:34.590> but<00:00:34.980> can<00:00:35.399> have<00:00:35.790> some<00:00:36.120> framerate<00:00:36.480> issues

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
good but can have some framerate issues

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.889 
good but can have some framerate issues
going<00:00:37.620> into<00:00:38.070> corners<00:00:38.640> and<00:00:38.820> onto<00:00:39.570> some<00:00:39.750> of<00:00:39.840> the

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
going into corners and onto some of the

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.569 
going into corners and onto some of the
tracks<00:00:40.170> so<00:00:40.500> let's<00:00:40.739> just<00:00:40.890> see<00:00:40.980> let<00:00:41.100> me<00:00:41.129> get<00:00:41.340> here

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
tracks so let's just see let me get here

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.580 
tracks so let's just see let me get here
pops<00:00:42.420> that<00:00:42.629> should<00:00:42.780> have<00:00:42.899> actually<00:00:43.260> going<00:00:43.530> for

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
pops that should have actually going for

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.040 
pops that should have actually going for
a<00:00:43.680> slide<00:00:44.100> there<00:00:44.520> rather<00:00:44.820> than<00:00:45.000> trying<00:00:45.809> to<00:00:45.899> turn

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
a slide there rather than trying to turn

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.200 
a slide there rather than trying to turn
the<00:00:46.200> corner<00:00:46.350> normally<00:00:47.030> certainly<00:00:48.030> there's

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
the corner normally certainly there's

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.790 
the corner normally certainly there's
not<00:00:48.390> a<00:00:48.420> lot<00:00:48.600> to<00:00:48.629> grumble<00:00:49.020> about<00:00:49.110> here<00:00:49.500> I<00:00:49.530> didn't

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
not a lot to grumble about here I didn't

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.950 
not a lot to grumble about here I didn't
say<00:00:52.879> yeah<00:00:53.879> that<00:00:54.090> does<00:00:54.329> feel<00:00:54.510> a<00:00:54.570> little<00:00:54.660> bit

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
say yeah that does feel a little bit

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.470 
say yeah that does feel a little bit
more<00:00:55.140> fluid<00:00:55.500> and<00:00:55.649> responsive<00:00:56.210> what<00:00:57.210> you<00:00:57.300> found

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
more fluid and responsive what you found

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.910 
more fluid and responsive what you found
is<00:00:57.690> sometimes<00:00:58.199> when<00:00:58.379> you<00:00:58.469> come<00:00:58.680> in<00:00:58.770> and

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
is sometimes when you come in and

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.510 
is sometimes when you come in and
actually<00:00:59.039> try<00:00:59.879> and<00:01:00.120> put<00:01:00.809> a<00:01:00.840> drift<00:01:01.109> on<00:01:01.489> get<00:01:02.489> a

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
actually try and put a drift on get a

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.280 
actually try and put a drift on get a
little<00:01:02.820> bit<00:01:02.940> of<00:01:02.969> kind<00:01:03.480> of<00:01:03.539> frame<00:01:03.750> rate<00:01:03.989> lag

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
little bit of kind of frame rate lag

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.550 
little bit of kind of frame rate lag
through<00:01:05.100> it<00:01:05.189> that<00:01:06.030> is<00:01:06.210> actually

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
through it that is actually

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.469 
through it that is actually
substantially<00:01:07.560> better<00:01:07.710> i<00:01:07.920> would<00:01:08.070> so<00:01:08.369> a<00:01:08.549> little

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
substantially better i would so a little

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.870 
substantially better i would so a little
bit<00:01:09.750> glitching<00:01:10.229> there<00:01:10.890> is<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.220> fill<00:01:11.729> rate

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
bit glitching there is the fill rate

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.840 
bit glitching there is the fill rate
spins<00:01:12.210> around<00:01:12.619> or<00:01:13.619> just<00:01:13.680> as<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.340> Cartwright's

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
spins around or just as the Cartwright's

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.590 
spins around or just as the Cartwright's
itself<00:01:16.280> again<00:01:17.280> that<00:01:17.580> is<00:01:17.729> feeling<00:01:18.060> pretty<00:01:18.270> good

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
itself again that is feeling pretty good

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.179 
itself again that is feeling pretty good
actually<00:01:18.810> I<00:01:19.170> wouldn't<00:01:19.500> say<00:01:19.590> it's<00:01:19.740> perfect

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
actually I wouldn't say it's perfect

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.340 
actually I wouldn't say it's perfect
though<00:01:20.280> you<00:01:20.549> see<00:01:20.759> when<00:01:21.060> those<00:01:21.720> smoke<00:01:22.049> trails

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
though you see when those smoke trails

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.960 
though you see when those smoke trails
come<00:01:22.530> out<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:22.740> back<00:01:22.890> of<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.130> car<00:01:23.670> from<00:01:23.880> the

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
come out the back of the car from the

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.450 
come out the back of the car from the
tire<00:01:24.210> burn<00:01:24.509> that<00:01:25.140> actually<00:01:25.770> it<00:01:26.009> does<00:01:26.220> lag<00:01:26.430> a

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
tire burn that actually it does lag a

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.480 
tire burn that actually it does lag a
little<00:01:26.759> bit<00:01:26.909> of<00:01:27.060> those<00:01:27.619> but<00:01:28.619> I<00:01:28.860> would<00:01:29.189> say<00:01:29.460> that

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
little bit of those but I would say that

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.850 
little bit of those but I would say that
is<00:01:29.939> certainly<00:01:30.509> an<00:01:30.600> improvement<00:01:30.900> over<00:01:31.350> the

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
is certainly an improvement over the

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.370 
is certainly an improvement over the
Nexus<00:01:32.340> 5<00:01:32.610> but<00:01:32.850> not<00:01:32.970> by<00:01:33.150> much<00:01:33.329> it's<00:01:33.810> marginal<00:01:34.290> I

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
Nexus 5 but not by much it's marginal I

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.660 
Nexus 5 but not by much it's marginal I
would<00:01:34.530> say<00:01:37.280> obviously<00:01:38.280> I'm<00:01:38.369> going<00:01:38.490> to<00:01:38.549> have<00:01:38.640> to

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
would say obviously I'm going to have to

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.899 
would say obviously I'm going to have to
play<00:01:38.850> a<00:01:39.119> lot<00:01:39.509> more<00:01:40.159> games<00:01:41.159> to<00:01:41.430> get<00:01:41.579> a<00:01:41.610> really

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
play a lot more games to get a really

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.389 
play a lot more games to get a really
good<00:01:41.939> feel<00:01:42.060> for<00:01:42.540> it<00:01:42.720> but<00:01:42.990> yeah<00:01:43.979> I<00:01:44.009> would<00:01:44.130> say

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
good feel for it but yeah I would say

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:45.770 
good feel for it but yeah I would say
that<00:01:44.430> is<00:01:44.670> definitely<00:01:45.060> an<00:01:45.149> improvement<00:01:45.360> of<00:01:45.659> the

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
that is definitely an improvement of the

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.020 
that is definitely an improvement of the
nexus<00:01:46.079> 5<00:01:46.290> but<00:01:46.530> it's<00:01:46.710> only<00:01:46.829> marginal<00:01:47.430> only
