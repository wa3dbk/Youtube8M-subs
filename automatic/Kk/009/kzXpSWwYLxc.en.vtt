00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:48.900 
we get in the next round we could get a
single<00:05:47.290> on<00:05:47.500> who<00:05:47.740> finished<00:05:48.130> second<00:05:48.640> in<00:05:48.700> this

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:48.910 
single on who finished second in this

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:51.870 
single on who finished second in this
group<00:05:49.180> that's<00:05:49.630> that<00:05:49.990> certain<00:05:50.530> that<00:05:51.460> would<00:05:51.700> be

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:51.880 
group that's that certain that would be

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:53.730 
group that's that certain that would be
a<00:05:51.910> really<00:05:52.450> interesting<00:05:52.780> game<00:05:53.110> or<00:05:53.350> we<00:05:53.590> could

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:53.740 
a really interesting game or we could

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:56.160 
a really interesting game or we could
get<00:05:53.920> Malaga<00:05:54.580> either<00:05:54.970> or<00:05:55.390> Hoffenheim<00:05:55.990> and

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:56.170 
get Malaga either or Hoffenheim and

00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:58.110 
get Malaga either or Hoffenheim and
Bacchic<00:05:56.530> -<00:05:56.770> all<00:05:57.040> those<00:05:57.220> draws<00:05:57.610> would<00:05:57.970> be

00:05:58.110 --> 00:05:58.120 
Bacchic - all those draws would be

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:00.840 
Bacchic - all those draws would be
really<00:05:58.810> good<00:05:58.960> for<00:05:59.020> us<00:05:59.230> or<00:05:59.740> we<00:06:00.190> could<00:06:00.370> get<00:06:00.550> mice

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:00.850 
really good for us or we could get mice

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:03.900 
really good for us or we could get mice
marsai<00:06:01.690> or<00:06:01.870> CSKA<00:06:02.440> Moscow<00:06:02.890> this<00:06:03.280> is<00:06:03.490> why<00:06:03.640> it's

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:03.910 
marsai or CSKA Moscow this is why it's

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:06.600 
marsai or CSKA Moscow this is why it's
very<00:06:04.210> important<00:06:04.900> to<00:06:05.020> finish<00:06:05.290> first<00:06:06.130> in<00:06:06.490> your

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:06.610 
very important to finish first in your

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:08.190 
very important to finish first in your
Champions<00:06:07.210> League<00:06:07.390> group<00:06:07.480> because<00:06:07.930> then<00:06:08.080> you

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:08.200 
Champions League group because then you

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:10.410 
Champions League group because then you
can<00:06:08.380> avoid<00:06:08.650> the<00:06:08.860> big<00:06:09.040> themes<00:06:09.310> grandmother<00:06:10.300> it

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:10.420 
can avoid the big themes grandmother it

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:11.910 
can avoid the big themes grandmother it
could<00:06:10.600> finish<00:06:10.780> second<00:06:11.290> though<00:06:11.410> if<00:06:11.560> they<00:06:11.740> lose

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:11.920 
could finish second though if they lose

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:14.070 
could finish second though if they lose
and<00:06:12.190> you<00:06:12.280> want<00:06:12.490> to<00:06:12.610> swim<00:06:12.850> in<00:06:13.420> the<00:06:13.600> last<00:06:13.810> round

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:14.080 
and you want to swim in the last round

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:16.560 
and you want to swim in the last round
but<00:06:15.070> then<00:06:15.220> this<00:06:15.400> group<00:06:15.580> Barcelona<00:06:16.270> win<00:06:16.420> their

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:16.570 
but then this group Barcelona win their

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:18.420 
but then this group Barcelona win their
group<00:06:16.750> as<00:06:16.930> well<00:06:17.110> so<00:06:17.170> I<00:06:17.590> would<00:06:17.860> get<00:06:18.070> I<00:06:18.220> would

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:18.430 
group as well so I would get I would

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:20.490 
group as well so I would get I would
like<00:06:18.610> to<00:06:18.820> get<00:06:18.970> Tottenham<00:06:19.510> or<00:06:19.690> Celtic<00:06:20.140> as<00:06:20.290> well

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:20.500 
like to get Tottenham or Celtic as well

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:24.270 
like to get Tottenham or Celtic as well
so<00:06:20.710> basically<00:06:21.040> any<00:06:21.280> team<00:06:21.580> oh<00:06:22.740> that<00:06:23.740> now<00:06:23.950> this

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:24.280 
so basically any team oh that now this

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:26.070 
so basically any team oh that now this
is<00:06:24.460> the<00:06:24.610> one<00:06:24.760> rule<00:06:25.030> that<00:06:25.060> I<00:06:25.450> would<00:06:25.690> like<00:06:25.900> to

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:26.080 
is the one rule that I would like to

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:29.340 
is the one rule that I would like to
avoid<00:06:26.230> early<00:06:26.890> on<00:06:27.040> man<00:06:27.280> united<00:06:27.580> I<00:06:28.240> think<00:06:29.230> they

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:29.350 
avoid early on man united I think they

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:31.890 
avoid early on man united I think they
will<00:06:29.500> finish<00:06:29.890> second<00:06:30.460> both<00:06:31.120> will<00:06:31.420> have<00:06:31.450> a<00:06:31.630> much

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:31.900 
will finish second both will have a much

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:33.540 
will finish second both will have a much
better<00:06:32.110> goal<00:06:32.410> difference<00:06:32.860> not<00:06:33.220> sure<00:06:33.430> about

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:33.550 
better goal difference not sure about

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:36.690 
better goal difference not sure about
the<00:06:33.820> head-to-head<00:06:34.150> results<00:06:35.020> or<00:06:35.700> Atletico

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:36.700 
the head-to-head results or Atletico

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:39.480 
the head-to-head results or Atletico
Madrid<00:06:37.060> that<00:06:37.120> would<00:06:37.480> be<00:06:37.630> another<00:06:38.620> difficult

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:39.490 
Madrid that would be another difficult

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:44.400 
Madrid that would be another difficult
draw<00:06:39.700> so<00:06:40.570> yeah<00:06:40.750> it's<00:06:41.880> mostly<00:06:42.880> mostly<00:06:43.870> we<00:06:44.170> could

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:44.410 
draw so yeah it's mostly mostly we could

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:46.110 
draw so yeah it's mostly mostly we could
get<00:06:44.620> a<00:06:44.650> good<00:06:44.800> roll<00:06:45.190> but<00:06:45.430> if<00:06:45.610> we<00:06:45.760> get<00:06:45.910> many

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:46.120 
get a good roll but if we get many

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:48.060 
get a good roll but if we get many
Isador<00:06:46.720> Atletico<00:06:47.290> that<00:06:47.500> could<00:06:47.710> be<00:06:47.860> difficult

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:48.070 
Isador Atletico that could be difficult

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:50.490 
Isador Atletico that could be difficult
telling<00:06:49.060> me<00:06:49.150> that's<00:06:49.360> it<00:06:49.630> for<00:06:49.900> today<00:06:50.170> is<00:06:50.230> my
