00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:49.450 
it's the best decision that I have made

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:53.250

for<00:04:50.229> my<00:04:50.410> hair<00:04:50.770> it<00:04:51.070> is<00:04:51.100> the<00:04:51.460> best<00:04:51.639> decision<00:04:52.260> that

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:53.260 
for my hair it is the best decision that

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:57.029 
for my hair it is the best decision that
I<00:04:53.860> have<00:04:54.160> made<00:04:54.370> from<00:04:54.700> a<00:04:54.789> harem<00:04:55.120> start<00:04:55.419> so<00:04:56.260> one

00:04:57.029 --> 00:04:57.039 
I have made from a harem start so one

00:04:57.039 --> 00:04:58.560 
I have made from a harem start so one
thing<00:04:57.220> that<00:04:57.280> I<00:04:57.460> would<00:04:57.520> like<00:04:57.880> to<00:04:57.910> say<00:04:58.300> is<00:04:58.539> that

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:58.570 
thing that I would like to say is that

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:02.340 
thing that I would like to say is that
going<00:04:59.080> natural<00:04:59.440> is<00:05:00.039> very<00:05:00.750> it's<00:05:01.750> not<00:05:01.930> hard<00:05:02.229> but

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:02.350 
going natural is very it's not hard but

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:04.800 
going natural is very it's not hard but
it<00:05:02.590> does<00:05:02.740> require<00:05:02.860> a<00:05:03.070> lot<00:05:03.280> of<00:05:03.310> patience<00:05:04.000> and<00:05:04.120> it

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:04.810 
it does require a lot of patience and it

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:07.879 
it does require a lot of patience and it
requires<00:05:05.229> you<00:05:05.650> really<00:05:06.160> showing<00:05:06.520> your<00:05:07.030> hair<00:05:07.479> a

00:05:07.879 --> 00:05:07.889 
requires you really showing your hair a

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:12.719 
requires you really showing your hair a
lot<00:05:08.889> of<00:05:09.070> love<00:05:09.310> and<00:05:09.700> attention<00:05:10.210> um<00:05:11.460> one<00:05:12.460> tip

lot of love and attention um one tip
that<00:05:12.760> I<00:05:12.970> would<00:05:13.270> say<00:05:13.600> is<00:05:13.840> that<00:05:14.110> if<00:05:14.380> you<00:05:14.740> do<00:05:15.010> start

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:15.340 
that I would say is that if you do start

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:18.629 
that I would say is that if you do start
transitioning<00:05:15.789> that<00:05:16.120> you<00:05:16.240> treat<00:05:16.710> every<00:05:17.710> piece

00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:18.639 
transitioning that you treat every piece

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:22.529 
transitioning that you treat every piece
of<00:05:18.849> your<00:05:19.180> hair<00:05:19.570> like<00:05:20.260> it<00:05:20.560> is<00:05:21.060> your<00:05:22.060> best<00:05:22.330> friend
