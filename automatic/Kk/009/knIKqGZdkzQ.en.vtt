00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
simple video demonstration of why not to

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.500 
simple video demonstration of why not to
use<00:00:27.450> your<00:00:28.340> diffusion<00:00:29.340> dome<00:00:29.610> if<00:00:29.940> you're<00:00:30.360> doing

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
use your diffusion dome if you're doing

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.080 
use your diffusion dome if you're doing
interior<00:00:31.200> photography<00:00:32.160> I've<00:00:32.489> done<00:00:32.700> a<00:00:32.730> video

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
interior photography I've done a video

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.450 
interior photography I've done a video
before<00:00:33.330> but<00:00:33.780> here<00:00:34.380> is<00:00:34.560> a<00:00:34.590> perfect<00:00:35.040> example<00:00:35.070> for

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
before but here is a perfect example for

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.900 
before but here is a perfect example for
it<00:00:35.550> so<00:00:35.850> just<00:00:36.720> now<00:00:36.870> I<00:00:37.200> am<00:00:38.010> in<00:00:38.129> a<00:00:38.160> room<00:00:38.400> which<00:00:38.730> has

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
it so just now I am in a room which has

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.400 
it so just now I am in a room which has
pretty<00:00:39.120> much<00:00:39.239> nothing<00:00:39.480> in<00:00:39.750> it<00:00:39.870> it's<00:00:39.989> just<00:00:40.050> a

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
pretty much nothing in it it's just a

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.090 
pretty much nothing in it it's just a
room<00:00:40.940> with<00:00:41.940> a<00:00:42.379> flap<00:00:43.379> which<00:00:43.739> is<00:00:43.890> kind<00:00:44.070> of

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
room with a flap which is kind of

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.660 
room with a flap which is kind of
hanging<00:00:44.250> off<00:00:44.460> now<00:00:44.879> if<00:00:45.150> I<00:00:45.330> take<00:00:46.290> a<00:00:46.350> photo<00:00:46.620> I<00:00:46.980> am

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
hanging off now if I take a photo I am

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.490 
hanging off now if I take a photo I am
wanting<00:00:48.030> it<00:00:48.150> to<00:00:48.270> be<00:00:48.300> as<00:00:48.420> wide<00:00:48.720> as<00:00:48.870> possible<00:00:49.050> and

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
wanting it to be as wide as possible and

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.320 
wanting it to be as wide as possible and
also<00:00:49.620> I'm<00:00:49.860> wanting<00:00:50.220> the<00:00:50.370> light<00:00:50.610> to<00:00:51.120> brighten

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:51.330 
also I'm wanting the light to brighten

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:52.729 
also I'm wanting the light to brighten
up<00:00:51.449> this<00:00:51.570> place<00:00:51.810> as<00:00:51.989> much<00:00:52.140> as<00:00:52.350> possible<00:00:52.470> as

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
up this place as much as possible as

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.470 
up this place as much as possible as
well<00:00:52.860> but<00:00:53.579> for<00:00:53.760> this<00:00:53.880> video<00:00:54.000> I'm<00:00:54.210> just<00:00:54.270> going

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
well but for this video I'm just going

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.389 
well but for this video I'm just going
to<00:00:54.540> show<00:00:54.690> you<00:00:54.810> what<00:00:54.989> it's<00:00:55.110> like<00:00:55.230> on<00:00:55.410> manual<00:00:56.130> so

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
to show you what it's like on manual so

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.270 
to show you what it's like on manual so
if<00:00:56.579> I<00:00:56.760> take<00:00:57.720> the<00:00:57.899> photo<00:00:58.140> of<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:59.430> room<00:00:59.610> here

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:01.280 
if I take the photo of the room here

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:08.719 
if I take the photo of the room here
with<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.520> flash<00:01:02.850> diffusion<00:01:03.780> on<00:01:07.430> look<00:01:08.430> at<00:01:08.550> that

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
with the flash diffusion on look at that

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:14.120 
with the flash diffusion on look at that
a<00:01:09.090> big<00:01:10.050> shadow<00:01:10.800> coming<00:01:11.670> behind<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.960> lamp<00:01:13.530> or

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
a big shadow coming behind the lamp or

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.210 
a big shadow coming behind the lamp or
the<00:01:14.820> light<00:01:15.240> shade<00:01:15.750> a<00:01:15.930> simple<00:01:16.710> way<00:01:16.800> to<00:01:16.860> fix<00:01:17.040> that

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
the light shade a simple way to fix that

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.499 
the light shade a simple way to fix that
is<00:01:18.140> take<00:01:19.140> this<00:01:19.259> boy<00:01:19.470> off<00:01:19.680> through<00:01:20.280> a<00:01:20.310> movie<00:01:20.509> and

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
is take this boy off through a movie and

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:27.770 
is take this boy off through a movie and
then<00:01:22.259> is<00:01:22.470> exactly<00:01:24.229> changes<00:01:25.700> and<00:01:26.700> look<00:01:27.000> no

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
then is exactly changes and look no

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.550 
then is exactly changes and look no
shadow<00:01:28.080> at<00:01:28.590> all

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.160 

so<00:01:32.400> that's<00:01:32.520> why<00:01:32.729> if<00:01:33.030> you're<00:01:33.150> doing<00:01:33.360> interior

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
so that's why if you're doing interior

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.380 
so that's why if you're doing interior
photography<00:01:34.770> you<00:01:35.190> want<00:01:35.340> to<00:01:35.430> bounce<00:01:35.670> but<00:01:36.299> you

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
photography you want to bounce but you

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.850 
photography you want to bounce but you
don't<00:01:36.570> use<00:01:36.780> your<00:01:36.930> diffusion<00:01:37.320> door<00:01:37.590> because

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
don't use your diffusion door because

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.530 
don't use your diffusion door because
that<00:01:38.130> effectively<00:01:38.549> sends<00:01:38.940> light<00:01:39.150> forward

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
that effectively sends light forward

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:45.680 
that effectively sends light forward
whenever<00:01:43.070> that<00:01:44.070> when<00:01:44.310> we<00:01:44.460> put<00:01:44.700> this<00:01:44.820> on<00:01:45.090> top<00:01:45.450> of

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:45.690 
whenever that when we put this on top of

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:48.080 
whenever that when we put this on top of
your<00:01:45.780> flash<00:01:46.430> that<00:01:47.430> means<00:01:47.640> light<00:01:47.880> goes

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
your flash that means light goes

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.090 
your flash that means light goes
straight<00:01:48.300> forward<00:01:48.630> and<00:01:48.750> that<00:01:48.869> casts<00:01:49.680> shadows

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.460 

see<00:01:53.100> if<00:01:53.720> it's<00:01:54.720> not<00:01:54.840> really<00:01:55.020> that<00:01:55.080> much<00:01:55.229> of<00:01:55.380> a

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
see if it's not really that much of a

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.320 
see if it's not really that much of a
difference<00:01:55.560> from<00:01:55.860> having<00:01:56.130> direct<00:01:56.549> flash<00:01:56.820> to

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:57.330 
difference from having direct flash to

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:58.399 
difference from having direct flash to
having<00:01:57.570> it<00:01:57.659> with<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:57.869> diffusion<00:01:58.259> door

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
having it with the diffusion door

00:01:58.409 --> 00:01:59.690 
having it with the diffusion door
pointing<00:01:58.979> up<00:01:59.070> there<00:01:59.220> so<00:01:59.310> if<00:01:59.430> you're<00:01:59.580> doing

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
pointing up there so if you're doing

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.240 
pointing up there so if you're doing
interiors<00:02:00.360> always<00:02:01.020> do<00:02:01.229> it<00:02:01.350> with<00:02:01.500> no<00:02:01.740> diffusion

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
interiors always do it with no diffusion

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.590 
interiors always do it with no diffusion
dorm<00:02:02.430> and<00:02:02.610> have<00:02:02.729> it<00:02:02.820> appoints<00:02:03.180> it<00:02:03.270> straight<00:02:03.479> of

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
dorm and have it appoints it straight of

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:04.910 
dorm and have it appoints it straight of
the<00:02:03.690> way<00:02:03.810> so<00:02:03.990> it's<00:02:04.140> just<00:02:04.259> completely

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
the way so it's just completely

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.680 
the way so it's just completely
pointless<00:02:05.100> always<00:02:05.910> take<00:02:06.090> the<00:02:06.210> diffusion<00:02:06.539> dome

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:06.690 
pointless always take the diffusion dome

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:11.330 
pointless always take the diffusion dome
off<00:02:07.910> what<00:02:08.910> the<00:02:09.060> helps
