00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:10.660
 So friends or Simon here on Saturdays 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:12.310
 monday negative test i introduce you 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:15.400
 today a collections before that you 

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:17.020
 that you need especially if 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:19.000
 her kabeg loading does something yesterday 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:21.010
 We have yet to introduce ourselves 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.930
 much on the subject of qadbak loading make 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:25.060
 topic carbohydrates on the topic 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:27.250
 insulin sensitivity will do everything else 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.600
 see today as I said a supplement 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:30.460
 I recommend you definitely 

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:32.439
 for comeback I would even load 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.000
 almost say it's a bit like must 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:35.950
 Now you might think yes 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.399
 I can take dextrose as well 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:41.530
 cheap grape sugar is yes 

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:44.230
 Similarly, I'll explain you briefly 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.700
 why motto is better in that case 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:47.680
 especially when comeback loading 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:50.020
 maybe a short time something is 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:52.120
 Changing maltodextrin is actually 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:54.070
 nothing but sugar we have 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:57.219
 and become matrix from different 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:01:00.190
 sugar varieties the overall simple 

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:02.620
 sugar will be very very high 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.780
 glycemic index has higher than that of 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.909
 grape sugar glycemic index her 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.220
 Knowing videos simply means 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:10.150
 would be very high on the 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.460
 insulin mirror 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:14.440
 why do we want insulin right after that 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.850
 have training especially when comeback 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.190
 loading insulin 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.080
 For one thing , it's anti-Qatar ball 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:21.820
 Anabolic hormone is practically this 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:25.090
 katar screed state during the 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:28.479
 Training stops that is point 1.2 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:30.010
 insulin prepares the muscle cell 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:32.409
 practically on your nutrient supply 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:35.020
 So that's explained so easy 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:37.810
 insulin affects your muscle cells like that 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.530
 that they simply make the nutrients better 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.240
 be able to record 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.159
 that means you have your glycogen 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.960
 practically during hard training 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:46.320
 But you want that again 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.490
 bring back important 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.979
 initiate regeneration processes 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.810
 also the whole white into the muscle cell 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:54.400
 inflict 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.650
 for that we just need insulin and 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.440
 we just need it 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:59.070
 good bird chemical carbohydrate after 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.130
 the training 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.540
 the good thing about the alto is so it just has 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.240
 a few advantages compared to 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:09.990
 Dextrose Advantage 1 It is essential 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.910
 easier to digest the problem with 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:13.440
 dextrose is simply that many do not 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.700
 good for metabolism or 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.490
 already metabolizes but not good 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.840
 many digest digestive pain 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:20.730
 especially with the high amount of it 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.190
 now maybe directly to the quantity 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.510
 especially when comeback loading you 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.420
 I usually recommend that way 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:30.300
 05 grams per kilogram of body weight that 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.130
 means if you recommend 100 kilo weighs 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.780
 I 50 grams in the post workout sheikh 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.610
 when comeback loading you should 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.320
 really on a gram per kilogram 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.010
 Going up the body weight thats mine 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.500
 recommendation 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.330
 you do not have to worry about that 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.950
 It makes you fat that's so good 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.510
 how impossible after training 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.840
 because we have the muscle cell 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:52.020
 have trained and practically say 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.430
 there is the train at the rhine is that 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:57.209
 practically impossible that the 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:58.740
 this is fed in by fat cells 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:00.000
 simple words so do not worry 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:01.739
 even with the amount of her powdered 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.230
 really more training at the 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:07.050
 In the first place, it is high stefan 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:09.269
 smith extra and second is super sweet 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:11.880
 not that the great advantage of walter 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:13.380
 it is as good as not sweet max kruses 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:17.010
 pub sweet at the crowd introduces itself 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:19.650
 100 grams of dextrose is disgusting if you 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:23.430
 contract it is okay otherwise here 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:25.410
 tastes super good in protein shake me 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.180
 I recommend programming creatine 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:29.310
 especially for comeback loading 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:32.130
 because really make sure that 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:33.660
 meet well the whole is 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:36.239
 really made it that way very much 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:38.130
 Well tuned to the time when the 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:39.959
 Availability of protein is there when 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:41.700
 the creatine is the most receptive 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:43.739
 why come to me, it is also 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:45.120
 a must-have videos with the combo 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:48.600
 malta absolutely awesome 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:50.640
 it's not expensive so for me 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.959
 especially when comeback loading 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:55.019
 still much to the topic 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:56.740
 then there has to be a must of me there 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:58.900
 extreme 

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:01.750
 from in your post office worker said water 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.700
 on it creative on it and you know 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:05.110
 have everything in a training 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:07.420
 tries the channel looks in the shop 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:09.840
 I will make it cheaper so until 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:09.840
 next time 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:24.729
 No
