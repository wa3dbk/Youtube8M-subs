if i zoom in you can kind of see the

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.330 
if i zoom in you can kind of see the

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.399 
I got a jalapeno early jalapeno
specifically<00:01:38.490> that<00:01:38.670> strain<00:01:39.509> of<00:01:39.659> it<00:01:39.780> and<00:01:39.960> I've

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
specifically that strain of it and I've

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.319 
specifically that strain of it and I've
learned<00:01:40.560> that<00:01:40.799> if<00:01:41.070> you<00:01:41.250> let<00:01:41.369> the<00:01:41.460> jalapenos<00:01:42.000> go

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
learned that if you let the jalapenos go

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.270 
learned that if you let the jalapenos go
when<00:01:42.899> they<00:01:42.990> turn<00:01:43.170> red<00:01:43.200> they're<00:01:43.829> even<00:01:44.040> hotter

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
when they turn red they're even hotter

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.429 
when they turn red they're even hotter
than<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.549> green<00:01:44.759> ones<00:01:44.939> so<00:01:45.899> I<00:01:45.930> did<00:01:46.229> not<00:01:46.350> know

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
than the green ones so I did not know

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.440 
than the green ones so I did not know
that<00:01:46.470> until<00:01:46.799> recently<00:01:47.040> just<00:01:47.549> just<00:01:48.090> learn<00:01:48.240> that

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
that until recently just just learn that

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.630 
that until recently just just learn that
so<00:01:48.659> if<00:01:48.780> you<00:01:48.840> see<00:01:48.990> a<00:01:49.020> green<00:01:49.200> jalapeno<00:01:49.740> it's<00:01:50.490> not

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
so if you see a green jalapeno it's not

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.280 
so if you see a green jalapeno it's not
quite<00:01:50.939> as<00:01:51.149> hot<00:01:51.420> as<00:01:51.630> the<00:01:51.780> red<00:01:51.930> ones<00:01:52.140> when

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
quite as hot as the red ones when

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.350 
quite as hot as the red ones when
they're<00:01:52.409> fully<00:01:52.619> mature<00:01:52.950> so<00:01:53.820> interesting

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
they're fully mature so interesting

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.600 
they're fully mature so interesting

that teeny tiny little plant over there

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.639 
that teeny tiny little plant over there
that<00:01:59.009> is<00:01:59.159> my<00:01:59.310> habanero<00:01:59.850> and<00:02:00.110> I<00:02:01.110> don't<00:02:01.469> know<00:02:01.530> how

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
that is my habanero and I don't know how

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.889 
that is my habanero and I don't know how
that's<00:02:01.829> going<00:02:01.979> to<00:02:02.070> do<00:02:02.159> because<00:02:02.430> it's<00:02:02.880> fine<00:02:03.659> for

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
that's going to do because it's fine for

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.130 
that's going to do because it's fine for
my<00:02:04.049> zone<00:02:04.350> my<00:02:04.710> growing<00:02:05.070> zone<00:02:05.280> and<00:02:05.490> PA<00:02:06.140> but

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
my zone my growing zone and PA but

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.690 
my zone my growing zone and PA but
unfortunately<00:02:07.920> it<00:02:08.099> needs<00:02:08.280> like<00:02:08.429> a<00:02:08.489> hundred

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
unfortunately it needs like a hundred

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.080 
unfortunately it needs like a hundred
days<00:02:08.970> to<00:02:09.360> mature<00:02:09.720> and<00:02:10.470> my<00:02:11.220> growing<00:02:11.550> season<00:02:11.910> is

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
days to mature and my growing season is

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
days to mature and my growing season is
not<00:02:12.300> really<00:02:12.569> that<00:02:12.690> long

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
not really that long

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.190 
not really that long
I'll<00:02:13.410> be<00:02:13.590> lucky<00:02:13.740> if<00:02:13.890> I<00:02:14.040> can<00:02:14.070> squeeze<00:02:14.490> 60<00:02:15.060> 65<00:02:15.810> 70

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
I'll be lucky if I can squeeze 60 65 70

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.010 
I'll be lucky if I can squeeze 60 65 70
days<00:02:16.380> out<00:02:16.590> so<00:02:16.890> we'll<00:02:17.760> say<00:02:17.970> it<00:02:18.150> likes<00:02:18.600> a<00:02:18.780> hotter
