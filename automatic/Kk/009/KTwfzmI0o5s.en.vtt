00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:39.290
 Hello, war is a dangerous business, especially 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.510
 if you decide to make it a game and 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:44.510
 even more so if they took the basis 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:46.400
 the great historical event did not have time 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.170
 see the light the second part of the company of 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:51.350
 heroes as the game hit the squall 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:53.540
 criticism from our fellow citizens deal 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.790
 it came to collecting signatures with requirements 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.900
 prohibit the sale of the game on site 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:59.449
 our state 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:01.580
 blame the storyline in which 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:04.399
 the red army was not put in the 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:06.110
 better light but for now the scandal around 

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:08.509
 games are gaining momentum 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:11.539
 we continue our conversation about community 

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:13.520
 various media projects and today 

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:18.970
 we have the heroes of the game universes 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.970
 darksiders philosophical death and asia 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:29.110
 the economy spares no one huge 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.509
 hopes on sale darksiders 2 not 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:34.000
 able to keep estrus from bankruptcy 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:36.520
 starring game 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.009
 became for studios last fate and 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:42.070
 really not without a sense of humor black 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:44.020
 humor however I was waiting for the game with 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:46.780
 impatience because not every day they give you 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:49.240
 opportunity to be death itself however 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:54.069
 literally after a few minutes of play i 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:56.590
 I felt a familiar feeling yes yes 

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:59.080
 this is exactly the reason 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:01.090
 shape and pattern of the hero fighting 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:03.369
 mechanics and presented in the game world and 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.539
 reminded me of my beloved series 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:06.940
 legacy of kain 

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:09.250
 or rather two parts sol river and 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:11.250
 the last game of the series 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:14.170
 legacy of kain defiance 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.880
 Well, let's not waste time and move on 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:19.690
 directly to the detailed analysis 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:23.500
 parallels of these two projects first 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:25.299
 appearance does not need long stare 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.850
 to identify similarities in outline 

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:30.160
 characters characters are transmitted emotions 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:32.590
 exclusively gestures and eyes to force 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.810
 the fact that almost all the time their faces 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.450
 hidden from sight is also worth noting 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.850
 constant readiness for battle bent 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.890
 legs and slightly hunched shoulders and such 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:43.480
 readiness to jump beyond that 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.640
 character often take 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.739
 the same poses in the game and on 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.510
 illustrations 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:52.060
 but deserves special attention 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:54.579
 how death ruzil climb walls 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:57.370
 You can give a lot of examples of this 

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:59.580
 similarities in games however similarities such 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:04.470
 degrees you can hardly find 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:06.710
 second battle the combat mechanics of heroes among 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:09.240
 commanding various combo attacks 

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:11.340
 death bader waving arms 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:13.580
 and cleverly managed with simple 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:16.440
 rivals like training dolls 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:18.450
 by the way about weapons while death 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.640
 has in its arsenal braids claws 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.950
 pistols and more section 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.960
 manages his soul thief who 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.910
 in the process of the game gains more 

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:28.260
 number of incarnations changing 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:30.870
 properties miracle ball 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.850
 the bottom line is that the aforementioned kidnapper 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.420
 shower performs all the functions of the arsenal 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:39.780
 of death 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:41.370
 if not more than 3 surrounded despite 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.240
 conditional freedom of movement in 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.490
 darksiders 2 

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:46.670
 the architecture of the world is very similar to what 

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:49.260
 we see in the process of wandering raziel 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:51.390
 abandoned temples with various riddles 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.490
 and traps concealing bonuses and 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:55.350
 other delights afterlife world and 

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:58.200
 corridor roads through mountains and forests 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:04:00.630
 mysterious buildings and much more 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:02.640
 oncoming occupants often send 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:05.160
 us to perform various tasks 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:06.709
 or give something useful but oh 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.910
 adversary like mushrooms after rain 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:12.060
 reappear upon re-visit 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:12.510
 locations oh yes and about the portal and not worth it 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.910
 forget 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:17.930
 finally, pay attention to the way 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:17.930
 opening the door 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:26.770
 4 plot both heroes wander in their 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:28.480
 worlds looking for answers 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:31.480
 death is trying to find a way 

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:33.790
 justify your brother to war a section 

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:36.190
 looking for answers to the question who is he 

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:39.130
 in the process both meet different 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:41.710
 characters directing them their searches 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:44.110
 and oddly enough both heroes in the end 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:48.850
 sacrifices himself for the common 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:51.640
 the good conclusion is worth noting that 

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:52.840
 age difference darksiders 2 and legacy 

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:55.270
 of kain defiance 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:58.930
 which remind is the last 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:05:01.330
 the game of the series is 9 years while 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:05.020
 distinguishes the game only the presence of improved 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:08.440
 charts inventory levels loot and konyashki 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:10.570
 not really thick really want to believe that 

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:13.720
 rumors of restarting the legacy of kain series 

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:16.000
 not unfounded and that soon fans again 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:19.510
 will be able to plunge into the mysterious world of the nose 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.490
 year and don't forget to leave in 

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:23.650
 comments the names of games of films and 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:24.160
 TV series in your opinion having a lot 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:26.950
 in common 

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:29.020
 and also subscribe to the channel but me 

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:32.430
