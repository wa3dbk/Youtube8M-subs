00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
over here Dolph Dolph and flopping

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.769 
over here Dolph Dolph and flopping
around<00:00:19.410> in<00:00:19.740> the<00:00:19.859> spawn<00:00:20.130> shot<00:00:20.460> so<00:00:21.119> basically

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
around in the spawn shot so basically

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.420 
around in the spawn shot so basically
all<00:00:22.140> i<00:00:22.260> have<00:00:22.859> to<00:00:22.920> say<00:00:23.269> from<00:00:24.769> long<00:00:25.769> range<00:00:25.800> shots

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
all i have to say from long range shots

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.509 
all i have to say from long range shots
like<00:00:26.640> this<00:00:27.170> where<00:00:28.170> your<00:00:28.470> target<00:00:28.680> really<00:00:29.099> isn't

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
like this where your target really isn't

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:30.919 
like this where your target really isn't
going<00:00:29.640> to<00:00:29.699> have<00:00:29.820> much<00:00:30.060> of<00:00:30.090> a<00:00:30.300> chance<00:00:30.480> to<00:00:30.720> kill

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
going to have much of a chance to kill

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.350 
going to have much of a chance to kill
you<00:00:31.050> if<00:00:31.140> you<00:00:31.199> go<00:00:31.470> for<00:00:31.769> them<00:00:31.830> is<00:00:32.369> on<00:00:32.759> you<00:00:32.969> can<00:00:33.149> go

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
you if you go for them is on you can go

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.200 
you if you go for them is on you can go
for<00:00:33.660> them<00:00:33.840> i'd<00:00:34.620> say<00:00:35.010> just<00:00:35.280> whenever<00:00:35.820> you<00:00:36.120> have

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
for them i'd say just whenever you have

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.600 
for them i'd say just whenever you have
the<00:00:36.270> chance<00:00:36.390> um<00:00:36.930> it's<00:00:37.829> not<00:00:38.100> very<00:00:38.219> likely<00:00:38.430> that

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
the chance um it's not very likely that

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.430 
the chance um it's not very likely that
you're<00:00:38.820> going<00:00:38.850> to<00:00:39.000> hit<00:00:39.180> them<00:00:39.360> but<00:00:39.989> if<00:00:40.110> you<00:00:40.230> do

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
you're going to hit them but if you do

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.889 
you're going to hit them but if you do
it'll<00:00:40.649> definitely<00:00:40.890> be<00:00:41.100> worth<00:00:41.219> it<00:00:41.610> and<00:00:41.899> you

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
it'll definitely be worth it and you

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.020 
it'll definitely be worth it and you
don't<00:00:43.680> have<00:00:43.770> to<00:00:43.890> go<00:00:44.010> for<00:00:44.190> as<00:00:44.280> much<00:00:44.430> complexity

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
don't have to go for as much complexity

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.049 
don't have to go for as much complexity
really<00:00:45.390> with<00:00:45.539> those<00:00:45.719> so<00:00:46.440> always<00:00:47.250> go<00:00:47.700> for<00:00:47.910> those

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
really with those so always go for those

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.580 
really with those so always go for those
when<00:00:48.270> you<00:00:48.300> have<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.539> chance<00:00:48.570> even<00:00:49.410> if<00:00:49.500> you

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
when you have the chance even if you

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:50.330 
when you have the chance even if you
don't<00:00:49.739> think<00:00:49.890> you're<00:00:50.010> going<00:00:50.100> to<00:00:50.160> hit<00:00:50.250> your

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
don't think you're going to hit your

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.430 
don't think you're going to hit your
target<00:00:50.700> um<00:00:50.820> segi<00:00:51.629> can<00:00:51.870> you<00:00:51.960> go<00:00:52.079> to<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.230> next

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
target um segi can you go to the next

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.990 
target um segi can you go to the next
spot<00:00:53.539> so<00:00:54.539> our<00:00:55.530> next<00:00:55.770> kind<00:00:56.070> of<00:00:56.160> spot<00:00:56.430> really<00:00:56.760> is

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
spot so our next kind of spot really is

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.720 
spot so our next kind of spot really is
a<00:00:57.449> spot<00:00:58.320> where<00:00:58.500> they're<00:00:59.070> definitely<00:00:59.370> within

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
a spot where they're definitely within

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.819 
a spot where they're definitely within
range<00:01:00.120> you<00:01:00.600> have<00:01:00.690> a<00:01:00.719> decent<00:01:00.960> chance<00:01:01.620> of

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
range you have a decent chance of

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.920 
range you have a decent chance of
hitting<00:01:01.980> them<00:01:02.219> as<00:01:03.059> you<00:01:03.239> can<00:01:03.359> see<00:01:03.510> psyche

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
hitting them as you can see psyche

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.050 
hitting them as you can see psyche
ducking<00:01:04.320> in<00:01:04.409> how<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.710> doors<00:01:05.040> like<00:01:05.369> already

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
ducking in how the doors like already

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.560 
ducking in how the doors like already
know<00:01:06.360> um<00:01:07.220> but<00:01:08.220> they're<00:01:08.760> within<00:01:08.970> a<00:01:09.180> decent

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
know um but they're within a decent

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.600 
know um but they're within a decent
amount<00:01:09.659> of<00:01:09.840> range<00:01:10.140> and<00:01:10.500> there's<00:01:11.280> a<00:01:11.369> pretty

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
amount of range and there's a pretty

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.670 
amount of range and there's a pretty
good<00:01:11.700> chance<00:01:11.880> that<00:01:12.330> you<00:01:12.420> could<00:01:12.840> lend<00:01:13.200> a<00:01:13.409> shot

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
good chance that you could lend a shot

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.520 
good chance that you could lend a shot
um<00:01:14.000> if<00:01:15.000> it's<00:01:15.240> in<00:01:15.390> a<00:01:15.479> clear<00:01:15.810> path<00:01:16.140> like<00:01:16.500> this

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
um if it's in a clear path like this

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.039 
um if it's in a clear path like this
I've<00:01:17.340> recommend<00:01:18.000> going<00:01:18.360> for<00:01:18.720> your<00:01:18.810> shot

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
I've recommend going for your shot

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.530 
I've recommend going for your shot
adding<00:01:19.500> a<00:01:19.590> little<00:01:19.770> bit<00:01:19.920> of<00:01:20.040> complexity<00:01:20.700> but

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
adding a little bit of complexity but

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.660 
adding a little bit of complexity but
still<00:01:22.170> making<00:01:22.530> it<00:01:22.650> a<00:01:22.710> kind<00:01:22.950> of<00:01:23.070> shot<00:01:23.340> that<00:01:23.580> you

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
still making it a kind of shot that you

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.469 
still making it a kind of shot that you
can<00:01:23.880> time<00:01:24.270> and<00:01:25.400> really<00:01:26.400> only<00:01:26.640> go<00:01:26.939> for<00:01:27.210> it<00:01:27.330> if

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
can time and really only go for it if

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.060 
can time and really only go for it if
you<00:01:27.540> don't<00:01:28.080> think<00:01:28.470> they're<00:01:28.650> gonna<00:01:28.770> come

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
you don't think they're gonna come

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.789 
you don't think they're gonna come
closer<00:01:29.400> or<00:01:29.869> if<00:01:30.869> you<00:01:31.049> don't<00:01:31.350> think<00:01:31.530> there's

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
closer or if you don't think there's

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.289 
closer or if you don't think there's
that<00:01:31.860> much<00:01:32.250> of<00:01:32.430> a<00:01:32.490> chance<00:01:32.700> they're<00:01:32.909> gonna<00:01:33.000> kill

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
that much of a chance they're gonna kill

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.899 
that much of a chance they're gonna kill
you<00:01:33.420> so<00:01:34.140> um<00:01:34.350> you<00:01:34.979> could<00:01:35.130> really<00:01:35.310> just<00:01:35.430> go<00:01:35.759> for

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
you so um you could really just go for

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.649 
you so um you could really just go for
anything<00:01:36.150> right<00:01:36.479> there<00:01:36.750> um<00:01:37.970> but<00:01:38.970> you're<00:01:39.540> gonna

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
anything right there um but you're gonna

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.210 
anything right there um but you're gonna
want<00:01:39.930> to<00:01:39.990> be<00:01:40.079> a<00:01:40.110> little<00:01:40.320> bit<00:01:40.470> cautious<00:01:40.799> from

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
want to be a little bit cautious from

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.609 
want to be a little bit cautious from
that<00:01:41.369> range<00:01:41.579> and<00:01:41.880> I'd<00:01:42.840> recommend<00:01:43.200> bringing

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
that range and I'd recommend bringing

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.719 
that range and I'd recommend bringing
them<00:01:43.950> closer<00:01:44.220> if<00:01:44.579> you<00:01:45.180> can<00:01:45.450> get<00:01:45.689> them<00:01:45.780> there<00:01:46.079> um

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:46.729 
them closer if you can get them there um

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:50.810 
them closer if you can get them there um
you<00:01:47.729> send<00:01:48.000> over<00:01:48.299> here<00:01:48.450> now<00:01:49.220> now<00:01:50.220> this<00:01:50.399> kind<00:01:50.729> of

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
you send over here now now this kind of

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.880 
you send over here now now this kind of
range<00:01:51.090> this<00:01:51.540> is<00:01:51.780> where<00:01:52.229> you're<00:01:52.409> normally

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
range this is where you're normally

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.200 
range this is where you're normally
going<00:01:52.920> to<00:01:53.159> be<00:01:53.220> going<00:01:53.369> for<00:01:53.700> your<00:01:53.790> shots<00:01:54.060> from

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
going to be going for your shots from

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.240 
going to be going for your shots from
and<00:01:54.600> this<00:01:55.079> is<00:01:55.200> where<00:01:55.409> i'd<00:01:55.500> recommend<00:01:56.009> trying

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
and this is where i'd recommend trying

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.179 
and this is where i'd recommend trying
to<00:01:56.399> get<00:01:56.549> most<00:01:56.759> of<00:01:56.939> your<00:01:57.030> shots<00:01:57.329> off<00:01:57.600> from<00:01:57.899> um

00:01:58.179 --> 00:01:58.189 
to get most of your shots off from um

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:01.520 
to get most of your shots off from um
kind<00:01:59.189> of<00:01:59.250> a<00:01:59.340> medium<00:01:59.759> range<00:02:00.090> so<00:02:00.869> you<00:02:00.960> have<00:02:01.140> both

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
kind of a medium range so you have both

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.999 
kind of a medium range so you have both
distance<00:02:02.130> and<00:02:02.430> you<00:02:02.759> can<00:02:02.880> go<00:02:03.030> for<00:02:03.240> complexity

00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:04.009 
distance and you can go for complexity

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:08.109 
distance and you can go for complexity
but<00:02:05.009> really<00:02:05.969> on<00:02:06.149> this<00:02:06.509> type<00:02:06.750> of<00:02:06.780> a<00:02:07.020> shot<00:02:07.290> um

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
but really on this type of a shot um

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:10.160 
but really on this type of a shot um
you're<00:02:09.119> going<00:02:09.270> to<00:02:09.360> want<00:02:09.509> to<00:02:09.599> make<00:02:09.750> sure<00:02:09.780> that

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
you're going to want to make sure that

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.410 
you're going to want to make sure that
if<00:02:10.349> there's<00:02:11.129> some<00:02:11.489> possible<00:02:12.090> way<00:02:12.209> that<00:02:12.239> you

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
if there's some possible way that you

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.170 
if there's some possible way that you
can<00:02:12.690> you

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
can you

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.479 
can you
to<00:02:13.329> sample<00:02:13.659> your<00:02:13.719> target<00:02:14.200> so<00:02:14.739> you<00:02:14.799> can<00:02:15.159> shock

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:15.489 
to sample your target so you can shock

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:16.709 
to sample your target so you can shock
charge<00:02:15.790> am<00:02:15.939> I'm<00:02:16.030> not<00:02:16.180> going<00:02:16.329> to<00:02:16.390> do<00:02:16.480> it<00:02:16.569> now

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:16.719 
charge am I'm not going to do it now

00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:18.720 
charge am I'm not going to do it now
because<00:02:16.870> I'm<00:02:17.079> keeping<00:02:17.349> this<00:02:17.409> for<00:02:17.590> my<00:02:17.709> shot<00:02:17.980> but

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
because I'm keeping this for my shot but

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.770 
because I'm keeping this for my shot but
um<00:02:18.909> just<00:02:19.659> any<00:02:19.930> sort<00:02:20.590> of<00:02:20.739> way<00:02:21.129> to<00:02:22.090> disable<00:02:22.540> your

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
um just any sort of way to disable your

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.209 
um just any sort of way to disable your
target<00:02:23.170> or<00:02:23.290> something<00:02:23.590> that<00:02:23.680> you<00:02:23.769> can<00:02:23.920> put<00:02:24.099> in

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:24.219 
target or something that you can put in

00:02:24.219 --> 00:02:26.280 
target or something that you can put in
between<00:02:24.519> your<00:02:24.670> target<00:02:25.030> like<00:02:25.180> San<00:02:25.780> jumped<00:02:26.170> off

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
between your target like San jumped off

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:27.869 
between your target like San jumped off
over<00:02:26.590> here<00:02:26.890> it<00:02:27.219> would<00:02:27.340> put<00:02:27.489> a<00:02:27.519> little<00:02:27.700> more

00:02:27.869 --> 00:02:27.879 
over here it would put a little more

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:29.759 
over here it would put a little more
distance<00:02:28.180> but<00:02:28.540> don't<00:02:28.719> give<00:02:28.810> me<00:02:28.900> that<00:02:28.959> plane<00:02:29.560> as

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:29.769 
distance but don't give me that plane as

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:33.330 
distance but don't give me that plane as
a<00:02:29.799> barrier<00:02:30.250> between<00:02:30.459> me<00:02:31.120> in<00:02:31.209> the<00:02:31.329> target<00:02:31.719> um<00:02:32.349> so

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
a barrier between me in the target um so

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:34.949 
a barrier between me in the target um so
just<00:02:33.639> keep<00:02:34.000> that<00:02:34.060> in<00:02:34.239> mind<00:02:34.480> when<00:02:34.659> you're<00:02:34.719> going

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959 
just keep that in mind when you're going

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:37.440 
just keep that in mind when you're going
for<00:02:35.139> these<00:02:35.230> shots<00:02:35.730> but<00:02:36.730> that's<00:02:36.909> normally

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
for these shots but that's normally

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:38.819 
for these shots but that's normally
where<00:02:37.599> you're<00:02:37.750> going<00:02:37.900> to<00:02:37.959> want<00:02:38.079> to<00:02:38.170> go<00:02:38.230> from<00:02:38.560> on

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:38.829 
where you're going to want to go from on

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:41.309 
where you're going to want to go from on
the<00:02:39.489> last<00:02:39.730> area<00:02:40.090> over<00:02:40.510> here<00:02:40.540> can<00:02:41.019> you<00:02:41.079> stand

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:41.319 
the last area over here can you stand

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:45.270 
the last area over here can you stand
over<00:02:41.439> here<00:02:41.680> sluggy<00:02:42.840> thank<00:02:43.840> you<00:02:43.989> um<00:02:44.290> this<00:02:45.040> is

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
over here sluggy thank you um this is

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.210 
over here sluggy thank you um this is
where<00:02:45.720> it's<00:02:46.720> kind<00:02:46.989> of<00:02:47.079> a<00:02:47.169> close-range<00:02:47.829> thing

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
where it's kind of a close-range thing

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:49.979 
where it's kind of a close-range thing
and<00:02:48.400> this<00:02:48.669> is<00:02:48.849> where<00:02:49.030> you<00:02:49.150> have<00:02:49.329> to<00:02:49.480> go<00:02:49.629> for<00:02:49.659> all

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
and this is where you have to go for all

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:53.099 
and this is where you have to go for all
your<00:02:50.200> complexity<00:02:50.739> um<00:02:51.510> obviously<00:02:52.510> when<00:02:52.989> he's

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:53.109 
your complexity um obviously when he's

00:02:53.109 --> 00:02:55.470 
your complexity um obviously when he's
this<00:02:53.319> close<00:02:53.560> um<00:02:53.919> I<00:02:54.310> use<00:02:54.669> this<00:02:54.909> map<00:02:55.150> is<00:02:55.180> a<00:02:55.329> good

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
this close um I use this map is a good

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.149 
this close um I use this map is a good
example<00:02:55.569> because<00:02:55.989> those<00:02:56.680> who<00:02:56.799> you<00:02:56.889> don't<00:02:57.040> know

00:02:57.149 --> 00:02:57.159 
example because those who you don't know

00:02:57.159 --> 00:02:58.649 
example because those who you don't know
the<00:02:57.340> bottom<00:02:57.489> of<00:02:57.669> carriers<00:02:58.060> like<00:02:58.090> right<00:02:58.450> there

00:02:58.649 --> 00:02:58.659 
the bottom of carriers like right there

00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:00.869 
the bottom of carriers like right there
on<00:02:58.900> this<00:02:59.620> is<00:02:59.769> if<00:02:59.859> you<00:02:59.980> plan<00:03:00.219> it<00:03:00.250> or<00:03:00.489> something

00:03:00.869 --> 00:03:00.879 
on this is if you plan it or something

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:03.270 
on this is if you plan it or something
and<00:03:01.090> these<00:03:01.870> shots<00:03:02.260> are<00:03:02.409> only<00:03:02.620> really<00:03:03.040> going<00:03:03.189> to

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
and these shots are only really going to

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.500 
and these shots are only really going to
be<00:03:03.370> usable<00:03:03.849> if<00:03:04.169> you<00:03:05.169> put<00:03:05.680> a<00:03:05.889> ton<00:03:06.579> of<00:03:06.609> complexity

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
be usable if you put a ton of complexity

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:10.770 
be usable if you put a ton of complexity
of<00:03:07.540> them<00:03:07.810> so<00:03:08.439> that's<00:03:08.859> why<00:03:09.129> I<00:03:09.159> recommend<00:03:09.969> trying

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
of them so that's why I recommend trying

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.379 
of them so that's why I recommend trying
to<00:03:10.989> keep<00:03:11.200> them<00:03:11.409> away<00:03:11.709> from<00:03:11.739> this<00:03:12.129> range<00:03:12.489> but

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:13.389 
to keep them away from this range but

00:03:13.389 --> 00:03:15.449 
to keep them away from this range but
just<00:03:13.750> if<00:03:13.900> you<00:03:14.139> do<00:03:14.379> get<00:03:14.590> close<00:03:14.859> enough<00:03:15.069> to<00:03:15.340> this

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:15.459 
just if you do get close enough to this

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:17.129 
just if you do get close enough to this
kind<00:03:15.669> of<00:03:15.790> range<00:03:16.090> that's<00:03:16.689> where<00:03:16.930> you're<00:03:17.019> going

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:17.139 
kind of range that's where you're going

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:18.030 
kind of range that's where you're going
to<00:03:17.199> really<00:03:17.440> want<00:03:17.620> to<00:03:17.739> throw<00:03:17.889> in<00:03:18.010> your

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
to really want to throw in your

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.599 
to really want to throw in your
complexity<00:03:18.669> so<00:03:20.010> you<00:03:21.010> can<00:03:21.129> really<00:03:21.370> go<00:03:21.459> for

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:21.609 
complexity so you can really go for

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:25.680 
complexity so you can really go for
anything<00:03:21.819> but<00:03:22.690> um<00:03:24.090> something<00:03:25.090> like<00:03:25.269> a<00:03:25.299> shock

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
anything but um something like a shock

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:29.009 
anything but um something like a shock
charge<00:03:25.959> cancel<00:03:26.560> or<00:03:26.889> maybe<00:03:27.400> even<00:03:27.780> black<00:03:28.780> hat

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:29.019 
charge cancel or maybe even black hat

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:31.469 
charge cancel or maybe even black hat
cancel<00:03:29.709> something<00:03:30.220> like<00:03:30.459> that<00:03:30.639> those<00:03:31.090> are<00:03:31.299> all

00:03:31.469 --> 00:03:31.479 
cancel something like that those are all
