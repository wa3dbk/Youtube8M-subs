00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
my name is Peter streetball and I'm from

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.890 
my name is Peter streetball and I'm from
Dayton<00:00:10.710> Ohio<00:00:10.860> and<00:00:11.099> this<00:00:11.429> is<00:00:11.580> my<00:00:11.900> tricopter

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
Dayton Ohio and this is my tricopter

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.680 
Dayton Ohio and this is my tricopter
tiltrotor<00:00:13.610> this<00:00:14.610> thing<00:00:14.759> is<00:00:14.849> basically<00:00:15.120> a<00:00:15.240> VTOL

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
tiltrotor this thing is basically a VTOL

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.090 
tiltrotor this thing is basically a VTOL
it<00:00:15.929> takes<00:00:16.080> off<00:00:16.199> vertically<00:00:16.500> and<00:00:16.740> tradition

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
it takes off vertically and tradition

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.019 
it takes off vertically and tradition
afford<00:00:17.369> flight<00:00:17.640> by<00:00:17.940> tilting<00:00:18.270> these<00:00:19.910> this<00:00:20.910> is

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
afford flight by tilting these this is

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:22.670 
afford flight by tilting these this is
basically<00:00:21.449> like<00:00:21.570> probably<00:00:22.199> the<00:00:22.320> six

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
basically like probably the six

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.050 
basically like probably the six
renditions<00:00:23.100> of<00:00:23.160> something<00:00:23.490> like<00:00:23.550> this<00:00:23.760> I've

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
renditions of something like this I've

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.939 
renditions of something like this I've
made<00:00:24.090> it<00:00:24.810> by<00:00:24.990> it's<00:00:25.109> pretty<00:00:25.350> good<00:00:25.529> though<00:00:25.769> and

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
made it by it's pretty good though and

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.470 
made it by it's pretty good though and
the<00:00:26.039> parts<00:00:26.310> are<00:00:26.400> from<00:00:26.490> the<00:00:26.849> parts<00:00:27.090> and<00:00:27.210> murders

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
the parts are from the parts and murders

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.970 
the parts are from the parts and murders
and<00:00:27.510> the<00:00:27.630> SC's<00:00:27.840> from<00:00:28.050> laser<00:00:28.230> toys<00:00:28.560> it<00:00:28.800> flies

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
and the SC's from laser toys it flies

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.840 
and the SC's from laser toys it flies
off<00:00:29.189> a<00:00:29.660> 3000<00:00:30.660> milliamp<00:00:30.869> 3s<00:00:31.349> the<00:00:32.250> controller<00:00:32.640> is

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
off a 3000 milliamp 3s the controller is

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.209 
off a 3000 milliamp 3s the controller is
a<00:00:32.880> adrenal<00:00:33.540> board<00:00:33.780> with<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.500> we<00:00:35.010> plus

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
a adrenal board with the we plus

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.280 
a adrenal board with the we plus
controller<00:00:35.579> made<00:00:35.969> it<00:00:36.120> to<00:00:36.239> it<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.960> port<00:00:37.200> the

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
controller made it to it the port the

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.869 
controller made it to it the port the
idea<00:00:37.500> came<00:00:37.680> from<00:00:37.739> our<00:00:37.950> secures<00:00:38.190> from<00:00:38.670> that<00:00:38.790> as

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
idea came from our secures from that as

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.360 
idea came from our secures from that as
well<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:39.629> tilt<00:00:40.050> mount<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.530> detail<00:00:40.860> servo<00:00:41.250> is

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
well the tilt mount the detail servo is

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.610 
well the tilt mount the detail servo is
from<00:00:41.579> wrap<00:00:41.969> RC<00:00:42.390> he<00:00:42.989> gave<00:00:43.140> me<00:00:43.260> that<00:00:43.379> and<00:00:43.440> that

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
from wrap RC he gave me that and that

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.490 
from wrap RC he gave me that and that
works<00:00:43.770> pretty<00:00:43.860> good

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:45.500 
works pretty good

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.410 
works pretty good
this<00:00:46.500> is<00:00:46.649> about<00:00:46.829> a<00:00:46.890> three<00:00:47.340> week<00:00:47.460> project<00:00:47.820> so

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
this is about a three week project so

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.450 
this is about a three week project so
it's<00:00:49.230> pretty<00:00:49.410> smooth<00:00:49.770> I've<00:00:50.100> got<00:00:50.309> this

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
it's pretty smooth I've got this

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:51.830 
it's pretty smooth I've got this
probably<00:00:50.789> like<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.030> fourth<00:00:51.270> wider<00:00:51.510> bear<00:00:51.690> put

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
probably like the fourth wider bear put

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.959 
probably like the fourth wider bear put
on<00:00:51.960> it<00:00:52.160> but<00:00:53.160> it's<00:00:53.250> doing<00:00:53.489> pretty<00:00:53.640> good<00:00:53.789> so<00:00:53.850> far

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
on it but it's doing pretty good so far

00:00:53.969 --> 00:01:43.000 
on it but it's doing pretty good so far
and<00:00:54.270> it's<00:00:54.360> not<00:00:54.510> giving<00:00:54.780> me<00:00:54.899> much<00:00:55.050> of<00:00:55.199> a<00:00:55.230> problem

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:43.010
