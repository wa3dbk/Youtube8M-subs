00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:12.990
 next but you know the cup games 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.089
 have their own laws 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.890
 if the team was complete so too 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.930
 with scorer black what else 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.880
 to report and whether it relaxes 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.900
 or exciting that was all 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:27.029
 pure lefeber after the last 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.189
 convincing play was merkur 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.260
 dortmund certainly not without chances to 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.079
 Tables fourth of the Oberliga Westphalia 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.820
 traveled to Herne and before the 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.980
 game offered dortmundern the one 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.750
 Another advantage the game was not 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.030
 as provided for in the closed stadium 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.860
 strünkede discharged but because of 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.320
 weather conditions to one 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.960
 misplaced and on the usual 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:56.670
 Aschenplatz played the more Korean 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:58.500
 from the beginning with that is already the 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:02.300
 fifth minute as a member black 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:05.220
 shot comes and just forgives 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.990
 also jimmy felix i with the number 13 was 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.299
 from the very beginning, he has the last 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.070
 games offered good and despite 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.049
 he too will be injured in his early injury 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.630
 through to the end and after eight 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.970
 minutes provoke the second 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.520
 big chance more coal in the 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.350
 Oberligist was disturbed early did not come 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.540
 has interplay in the first half 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:28.140
 absolutely only one big chance 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:30.390
 as here in the 31 minute the defense of 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.030
 Dortmunder is not paying attention that is 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.189
 carsten link who walks up and away 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.409
 and a better owner than that 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:40.680
 You can hardly shoot therapy 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:43.229
 at these 10 for herne it remained until the 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.479
 pause and in the second half had 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:49.200
 the host the better start 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:50.610
 that's the 48 minute and mercury probably 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.770
 still shocked about this 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.229
 owner leaves the host the 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.659
 initiative carsten link head here to 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.350
 but the king is on the ball 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.200
 Post 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.240
 and then about the middle of the second half 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:05.310
 leave westfalia herne merkur the 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.439
 initiative wants the 1 0 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.270
 rocking over time and jimmy felix 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.110
 had a great chance to 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.270
 compensation 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.280
 and from now on, they will see around 300 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:17.280
 spectators a dramatic cup play 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:19.410
 merkur is getting stronger and in the 68th 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.230
 minute is it defender frank müller 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:24.870
 so that his header balancing 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:26.910
 achieved a lot of cheering and of course 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.410
 Merkur now remembers the pusher 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.930
 that there is more in here 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:33.300
 that's jimmy felix again the ball 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:36.060
 to jonny guth her playing will be yes 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:39.450
 his shot misses the target clearly 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:41.660
 at the end , it says 1 to 1 after 90 minutes 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:44.010
 There is an extension 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:45.690
 and in the westfalia herne but has 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.650
 the weather is getting worse and worse 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.410
 better start 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:51.480
 after that flank of uli reimann becomes 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.250
 Joerg silver bush come to the ball and 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.709
 against his shot has volker okun 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.330
 There is no chance 2 2 1 for Westfalia 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:59.640
 Hear in the 94th 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:01.799
 minute but merkur stuck under no circumstances 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:05.250
 on after this free kick of frank rost 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:07.950
 ferrero tieres has the big chance yet 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:10.019
 The culprit detlef müller can hold 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.420
 a minute later then this attack 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:14.280
 of merkur jimmy felix and he plays 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.530
 his opponent brings the ball after 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:21.209
 inside and after that feeling it is that 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:23.940
 Nigerian who scored the 2 2 in the 99 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:26.250
 minute and now feels merkurs trainer 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:28.170
 walter that a decision for 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.810
 Mercury is possible he brings two new 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:33.269
 striker for manuel guth animal and the 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:35.459
 therapy and relies fully on offensive 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:37.889
 and in the meantime strong snowfall 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:40.859
 Black has the big chance here 

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:42.989
 in the 111 minute but can be lift 

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:46.350
 hernes trainer detlef müller just yet 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:47.910
 parry and who plays the final phase 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:50.190
 only merkur dortmund the team 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:52.380
 fights excellently comes to the ground 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:54.450
 better cope and two minutes before 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:56.730
 the big chance to win 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:58.950
 decision yet petra red iris 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:01.560
 misses it remains even after 120 minutes 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:03.750
 when 2 2 the penalty shoot 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:06.359
 decide and that's the 3 2 by 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:07.430
 lord it wilfried perner but more briefly 

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:10.129
 frank postberg 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:12.560
 often as safe to 3 3 then stopped 

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:14.780
 Volker Kullik a penalty and so on 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:16.489
 nico tieres has a great chance for 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:18.079
 Merkur to force the preliminary decision 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:22.610
 but he failed with his penalty 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:25.699
 at Kernes täter müller and that is the 4 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:27.590
 3 for herne by carsten left with 

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:28.759
 the black retains in the rows of 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:30.919
 Mercury's nerves 

00:04:28.759 --> 00:04:32.000
 his strike meant the compensation to 

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:34.669
 4 4 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.650
 then comes the big moment of merck 

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:40.370
 US dollar gets his second 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:43.270
 strafstoß and andrea cipolla brings 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:46.490
 his eleven meter merkur 5 to 4 in leadership 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:49.310
 afterwards Hernes reimann transforms 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:51.169
 to balance and the decision must 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:53.539
 fall in the last penalty for merkur 

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:55.160
 the skis georg long and the meets on 

00:04:53.539 --> 00:04:56.900
 thus , merker wins the end 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:59.840
 superlists of the fabia herne 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:01.660
 sensational but not undeserved with 6 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:05.410
 to 5 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:05.410
 congratulation circle class
