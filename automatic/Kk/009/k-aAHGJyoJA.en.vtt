life and that things were were different

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.530

than<00:02:23.019> they<00:02:23.170> had<00:02:23.379> been<00:02:23.620> before<00:02:23.940> where<00:02:24.940> maybe<00:02:25.450> I

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
than they had been before where maybe I

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.479

aggressive<00:02:45.640> goal<00:02:46.090> but<00:02:46.599> it's<00:02:46.660> exciting

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
aggressive goal but it's exciting

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:51.770 
aggressive goal but it's exciting
