welcome to mr. V teaching math in this

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:05.420 
welcome to mr. V teaching math in this
session<00:00:03.330> I'll<00:00:03.840> be<00:00:04.049> talking<00:00:04.259> about<00:00:04.440> how<00:00:04.770> to<00:00:04.830> use

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
session I'll be talking about how to use

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.740 
session I'll be talking about how to use
protractor<00:00:06.420> properly<00:00:07.580> there<00:00:08.580> is<00:00:08.610> one<00:00:09.059> key

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
protractor properly there is one key

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.490 
protractor properly there is one key
thing<00:00:10.139> that<00:00:10.170> confuses<00:00:10.980> so<00:00:11.280> many<00:00:11.519> students

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:12.500 
thing that confuses so many students

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:17.779 
thing that confuses so many students
there<00:00:13.500> are<00:00:13.530> two<00:00:14.179> sets<00:00:15.179> of<00:00:15.330> numbers<00:00:16.490> that<00:00:17.490> so

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
there are two sets of numbers that so

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.099 
there are two sets of numbers that so
this<00:00:17.940> device<00:00:18.330> can<00:00:18.570> be<00:00:18.600> used<00:00:18.840> for<00:00:18.960> any

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
this device can be used for any

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:19.790 
this device can be used for any
direction

direction
the<00:00:19.920> problem<00:00:20.369> is<00:00:20.490> students<00:00:20.910> constantly<00:00:21.270> get

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
the problem is students constantly get

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.080 
the problem is students constantly get
confused<00:00:22.230> about<00:00:22.410> which<00:00:22.529> set<00:00:23.310> of<00:00:23.550> numbers<00:00:23.910> to

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
confused about which set of numbers to

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.179 
confused about which set of numbers to
use<00:00:24.330> and<00:00:25.260> the<00:00:25.350> set<00:00:25.529> of<00:00:25.650> numbers<00:00:25.769> to<00:00:26.039> use

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
use and the set of numbers to use

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.660 
use and the set of numbers to use
changes<00:00:26.730> based<00:00:27.210> on<00:00:27.420> how<00:00:27.630> you<00:00:27.689> place<00:00:28.140> it<00:00:28.670> so

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
changes based on how you place it so

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.880 
changes based on how you place it so
let's<00:00:29.849> go<00:00:29.970> over<00:00:30.179> how<00:00:30.269> to<00:00:30.300> place<00:00:30.570> it<00:00:30.710> first<00:00:31.710> and

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
let's go over how to place it first and

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.910 
let's go over how to place it first and
most<00:00:31.980> important<00:00:32.550> thing<00:00:32.759> is<00:00:32.969> this<00:00:33.270> point<00:00:33.690> here

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:33.920 
most important thing is this point here

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.229 
most important thing is this point here
this<00:00:34.920> point<00:00:35.100> here<00:00:35.520> needs<00:00:35.820> to<00:00:35.910> go<00:00:36.090> on<00:00:36.120> the

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
this point here needs to go on the

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.920 
this point here needs to go on the
vertex<00:00:36.840> of<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.770> angle<00:00:37.950> here<00:00:38.700> as<00:00:38.930> accurately

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
vertex of the angle here as accurately

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.490 
vertex of the angle here as accurately
as<00:00:40.469> you<00:00:40.530> possibly<00:00:41.250> can<00:00:41.870> the<00:00:42.870> second<00:00:43.260> thing<00:00:43.410> is

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
as you possibly can the second thing is

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.740 
as you possibly can the second thing is
you<00:00:43.620> must<00:00:43.829> align<00:00:44.399> up<00:00:44.640> one<00:00:45.090> of<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.300> bottom

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
you must align up one of the bottom

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.660 
you must align up one of the bottom
edges<00:00:45.930> whether<00:00:46.260> it's<00:00:46.469> this<00:00:46.649> bottom<00:00:46.980> edge<00:00:47.129> or

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
edges whether it's this bottom edge or

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.270 
edges whether it's this bottom edge or
that<00:00:47.910> bottom<00:00:48.300> edge<00:00:48.420> doesn't<00:00:48.870> matter<00:00:49.260> but<00:00:49.920> one

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
that bottom edge doesn't matter but one

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.950 
that bottom edge doesn't matter but one
of<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.460> bottom<00:00:50.730> edges<00:00:50.879> must<00:00:51.329> be<00:00:51.570> lined<00:00:51.809> up

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
of the bottom edges must be lined up

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.930 
of the bottom edges must be lined up
with<00:00:52.199> either<00:00:52.680> arm<00:00:53.070> whichever<00:00:53.520> one<00:00:53.699> you<00:00:53.789> want

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
with either arm whichever one you want

00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:00.290 
with either arm whichever one you want
allow<00:00:54.539> me<00:00:54.690> to<00:00:54.809> demonstrate<00:00:59.090> center<00:01:00.090> point

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
allow me to demonstrate center point

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.540 
allow me to demonstrate center point
here<00:01:00.390> I've<00:01:00.870> chosen<00:01:01.260> to<00:01:01.469> line<00:01:01.680> up<00:01:01.859> this<00:01:02.160> line

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
here I've chosen to line up this line

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.050 
here I've chosen to line up this line
now<00:01:03.300> this<00:01:03.660> tells<00:01:04.439> me<00:01:04.739> which<00:01:05.339> set<00:01:05.640> of<00:01:05.729> numbers

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
now this tells me which set of numbers

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.870 
now this tells me which set of numbers
to<00:01:06.210> use<00:01:06.450> wherever<00:01:07.200> you<00:01:07.619> line<00:01:08.010> up<00:01:08.310> this<00:01:08.460> bottom

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
to use wherever you line up this bottom

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.609 
to use wherever you line up this bottom
edge<00:01:09.000> to<00:01:09.240> one<00:01:09.360> of<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.570> arms<00:01:09.960> of<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.290> angle

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
edge to one of the arms of the angle

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.780 
edge to one of the arms of the angle
that<00:01:11.100> is<00:01:11.520> zero<00:01:11.909> so<00:01:12.840> look<00:01:13.020> here<00:01:13.320> there's<00:01:14.159> my<00:01:14.460> 0

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
that is zero so look here there's my 0

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.359 
that is zero so look here there's my 0
since<00:01:15.659> the<00:01:15.840> zero<00:01:16.080> is<00:01:16.259> on<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.439> inside<00:01:16.650> set<00:01:17.250> of

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
since the zero is on the inside set of

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.340 
since the zero is on the inside set of
numbers<00:01:17.700> that<00:01:18.299> means<00:01:18.509> I'm<00:01:18.689> going<00:01:18.869> to<00:01:18.990> use<00:01:19.170> the

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
numbers that means I'm going to use the

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.130 
numbers that means I'm going to use the
inside<00:01:19.979> set<00:01:20.310> of<00:01:20.400> numbers<00:01:20.729> to<00:01:20.880> measure<00:01:21.180> this<00:01:21.450> if

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
inside set of numbers to measure this if

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.200 
inside set of numbers to measure this if
I'm<00:01:22.409> very<00:01:22.950> careful<00:01:23.430> and<00:01:23.549> thorough<00:01:23.670> here<00:01:24.030> I'll

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
I'm very careful and thorough here I'll

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:24.950 
I'm very careful and thorough here I'll
get<00:01:24.299> to<00:01:24.450> 30

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
get to 30

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.410 
get to 30
I<00:01:25.140> look<00:01:25.590> over<00:01:25.740> here<00:01:26.189> I'm<00:01:26.549> looking<00:01:27.030> at<00:01:27.150> thirty

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
I look over here I'm looking at thirty

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:33.319 
I look over here I'm looking at thirty
six<00:01:29.060> point<00:01:30.060> five<00:01:30.390> degrees<00:01:31.820> what's<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:33.000> second

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
six point five degrees what's the second

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.800 
six point five degrees what's the second
set<00:01:33.479> of<00:01:33.509> numbers<00:01:33.600> four<00:01:34.280> well<00:01:35.420> what<00:01:36.420> if<00:01:36.509> I<00:01:36.600> lined

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
set of numbers four well what if I lined

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.929 
set of numbers four well what if I lined
it<00:01:36.840> up<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.290> other<00:01:37.530> way<00:01:37.740> and<00:01:38.130> I<00:01:38.250> decided<00:01:38.579> to<00:01:38.759> use

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
it up the other way and I decided to use

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:47.940 
it up the other way and I decided to use
this<00:01:39.570> side<00:01:40.490> that<00:01:41.490> will<00:01:41.670> look<00:01:41.759> like<00:01:41.909> this

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.950 

again<00:01:48.950> lined<00:01:49.850> up<00:01:49.970> as<00:01:50.120> carefully<00:01:50.510> as<00:01:50.600> I<00:01:50.720> can

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
again lined up as carefully as I can

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.250 
again lined up as carefully as I can
here<00:01:51.290> with<00:01:51.950> the<00:01:52.070> bottom<00:01:52.430> line<00:01:52.700> lined<00:01:53.420> up<00:01:53.630> this

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:54.260 
here with the bottom line lined up this

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.650 
here with the bottom line lined up this
is<00:01:54.560> the<00:01:54.890> side<00:01:55.370> that's<00:01:55.400> lined<00:01:55.820> up<00:01:56.000> that<00:01:56.270> becomes

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:56.660 
is the side that's lined up that becomes

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:58.900 
is the side that's lined up that becomes
zero<00:01:57.320> you'll<00:01:57.740> notice<00:01:58.040> now<00:01:58.220> I'm<00:01:58.490> using<00:01:58.700> the

00:01:58.900 --> 00:01:58.910 
zero you'll notice now I'm using the

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:01.060 
zero you'll notice now I'm using the
outside<00:01:59.360> set<00:01:59.660> of<00:01:59.750> numbers<00:02:00.050> and<00:02:00.619> then<00:02:00.800> go<00:02:00.979> along

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 
outside set of numbers and then go along

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:02.920 
outside set of numbers and then go along
to<00:02:01.369> the<00:02:01.460> outside<00:02:01.820> and<00:02:02.240> you'll<00:02:02.390> notice<00:02:02.600> that<00:02:02.720> I

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:02.930 
to the outside and you'll notice that I

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:07.900 
to the outside and you'll notice that I
end<00:02:03.170> up<00:02:03.410> at<00:02:03.760> this<00:02:04.760> time<00:02:05.290> 36<00:02:06.290> degrees<00:02:06.910> now

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:07.910 
end up at this time 36 degrees now

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:10.419 
end up at this time 36 degrees now
that's<00:02:08.090> easily<00:02:08.390> possible<00:02:09.229> to<00:02:09.410> be<00:02:09.530> off<00:02:09.740> by<00:02:10.070> a<00:02:10.100> a

order to account for the fact that

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.699 
order to account for the fact that
sometimes<00:02:26.209> there's<00:02:26.989> a<00:02:27.080> little<00:02:27.290> bit<00:02:27.500> of

sometimes there's a little bit of

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:30.870 
sometimes there's a little bit of

variation exactly how this is lined up

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.690 
variation exactly how this is lined up
that<00:02:31.880> is<00:02:32.690> how<00:02:32.750> to<00:02:32.930> use<00:02:33.050> a<00:02:33.140> protractor

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
that is how to use a protractor

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.700 
that is how to use a protractor
correctly
