00:02:24.789 --> 00:02:24.799 
clips now when I'm on my transitions I

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:27.340 
clips now when I'm on my transitions I
can<00:02:25.340> pick<00:02:25.519> I<00:02:25.610> like<00:02:25.820> the<00:02:25.970> cross<00:02:26.239> blur<00:02:26.600> and<00:02:26.840> if<00:02:27.230> i

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
can pick I like the cross blur and if i

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:29.680 
can pick I like the cross blur and if i
drag<00:02:27.680> that<00:02:27.920> between<00:02:28.220> i<00:02:28.519> can<00:02:28.790> add<00:02:28.970> that<00:02:29.209> here<00:02:29.239> i

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
drag that between i can add that here i

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.560 
drag that between i can add that here i
usually<00:02:30.110> pick<00:02:30.560> the<00:02:30.739> same<00:02:31.100> transition<00:02:31.700> if<00:02:32.090> it

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:32.570 
usually pick the same transition if it

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:33.819

in<00:02:32.660> a<00:02:32.720> video<00:02:32.870> i<00:02:33.049> don't<00:02:33.290> like<00:02:33.440> to<00:02:33.470> switch<00:02:33.680> them

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:33.829 
in a video i don't like to switch them

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:36.280 
in a video i don't like to switch them
up<00:02:33.920> but<00:02:34.790> now<00:02:34.970> if<00:02:35.150> i<00:02:35.239> click<00:02:35.450> play<00:02:35.750> i'm<00:02:36.049> going<00:02:36.230> to

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
up but now if i click play i'm going to

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:44.080 
up but now if i click play i'm going to
see<00:02:36.410> this<00:02:36.680> video<00:02:38.230> will<00:02:39.230> change<00:02:39.260> to<00:02:39.829> that<00:02:39.980> it's

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.170 

and<00:02:44.900> then<00:02:45.019> that<00:02:45.170> video<00:02:45.440> will<00:02:45.590> change<00:02:46.180> much

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
and then that video will change much

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.150 
and then that video will change much
nicer<00:02:47.510> than<00:02:47.690> just<00:02:47.989> that<00:02:48.140> hard<00:02:48.470> cut<00:02:48.769> that<00:02:48.950> just

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
nicer than just that hard cut that just

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:50.979 
nicer than just that hard cut that just
goes<00:02:49.310> from<00:02:49.489> one<00:02:49.730> to<00:02:49.879> the<00:02:49.910> other<00:02:50.000> adds<00:02:50.720> a<00:02:50.959> little

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:50.989 
goes from one to the other adds a little

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:52.420 
goes from one to the other adds a little
bit<00:02:51.260> of<00:02:51.379> depth<00:02:51.620> to<00:02:51.709> your<00:02:51.830> video<00:02:52.129> and<00:02:52.160> also

bit of depth to your video and also

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:53.920 
bit of depth to your video and also
makes<00:02:53.060> it<00:02:53.150> just<00:02:53.209> look<00:02:53.450> a<00:02:53.480> little<00:02:53.629> bit<00:02:53.810> more

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
makes it just look a little bit more

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:55.750 
makes it just look a little bit more
professional<00:02:54.250> but<00:02:55.250> those<00:02:55.400> are<00:02:55.580> your

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760
