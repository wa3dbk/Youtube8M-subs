00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.490
 hi today I want to present you a game 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.020
 which is called the elevator game 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.809
 indeed more than a game we say this is 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:12.660
 a demonstration of a typical day 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.910
 working for people within 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.340
 a computer company these missions 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:22.050
 are the square trains of that lapse of 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.740
 almost 23 to do we start from the most 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.810
 important 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:28.050
 you have who is important who it is 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.849
 exactly the canvas of which because I go 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.550
 words is the owner of the company 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:35.370
 computerist he was very crazy for 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.649
 the cars in fact at his home had one 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.510
 showroom all for himself every morning 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.950
 went to different crowned work is 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.469
 that car decided to go to the 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.579
 work with his lombardini arrives at 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.100
 society 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.500
 the lamborghini with guarded parking 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.750
 then of course we have in a nutshell 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.620
 the office on the highest floor of the whole 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.270
 society 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:58.260
 and in fact every morning he took 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:01:00.629
 the elevator to go to the office and 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:04.320
 obviously check the work of 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:06.430
 all for as much as 42 instead 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.170
 he was the engineer 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:12.100
 IT better than the whole 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:14.770
 then family company too 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:17.020
 let's say pretty rich in networks that 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.759
 so a hundred from this beautiful I will explain in 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.409
 following as I said was the engineer 

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:22.900
 IT technician better than the whole 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:24.509
 company was also very vain 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:27.399
 in fact every morning to get noticed 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:30.850
 he took his from the helicopter 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:33.250
 here is the fact that he was rich enough and 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.560
 he placed it on the roof of the company, however 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:37.780
 the president didn't like that 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.700
 that is, they did not like vain people and 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.590
 obviously he couldn't fire the tough guy 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.390
 because thanks to two many entered 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.250
 money within the company 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.560
 but now what did the president do? 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.869
 made official put at the top 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.759
 low of the company in fact two years 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:54.210
 morning take this lift for 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:57.369
 go to his office to work 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.440
 now let's talk about the most out of tune all 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:01.750
 because he is most unfortunate of all is up there 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:04.119
 adequate because in a nutshell one 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:06.520
 works the high ether in the intermediate floors 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:09.060
 and not even the lowest years of society 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.560
 he mostly work outside 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:14.350
 of society and you will say 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:17.829
 you work from the outside what a race of 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:19.989
 Work is and nothing up there to file pictures 

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:22.660
 in fact he makes glasses every morning to do 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:27.070
 must solve by censor and did 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:28.120
 shine society's militias on its own 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:30.609
 of paintings 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.900
 oh God, I know that if the elevator is broken, yes 

00:02:30.609 --> 00:02:34.209
 because if in a few words respect 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.640
 in fact, the center of low park shelters that 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:37.450
 here is the ace of paintings that has gone up 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.329
 on the top 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:42.569
 be careful though because the 6 of 

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:45.719
 cadres can be skilled 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:47.639
 the elevator is also an inventor indeed 

00:02:45.719 --> 00:02:49.859
 increased a little ascension 

00:02:47.639 --> 00:02:52.459
 particular that called the elevator 

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:53.760
 supersonic thanks to this sensor 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:55.499
 lift 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:59.370
 just a simple snap of life that 

00:02:55.499 --> 00:03:02.280
 the ace the 23 of paintings immediately return to 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:06.109
 top and I'm so apple tree we're back 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.109
 they only leave their shadows
