00:00:00.809 --> 00:00:02.880
 hello full screen readers 

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:05.480
 here it is kauani silva 

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:09.900
 and she has one here again to do the third video next to it I think it's 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:10.979
 unusual 

00:00:10.979 --> 00:00:12.829
 what are you going to teach 

00:00:12.829 --> 00:00:13.979
 ap 

00:00:13.979 --> 00:00:16.979
 to kill the pen drive 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:19.579
 evil to many people 

00:00:19.579 --> 00:00:22.810
 but that will help a lot of people because 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:27.050
 These people asked me to tell me that by using these stones not only 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.919
 at home but 

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:28.989
 also 

00:00:28.989 --> 00:00:30.400
 at the University 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:31.789
 and in reports 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:33.320
 oftentimes 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.310
 lb 

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:37.900
 these channels are contaminated with the virus 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.900
 p their formatting is the best 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:45.860
 to eliminate viruses that may be affecting your stone 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.420
 so even doing this in a very simple way 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:52.960
 favorite 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.960
 I already called my work, it does not matter, it's knowing 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:58.260
 ef 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.570
 because my computer 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.880
 and here are all the disks 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.900
 is connected to the computer 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.420
 the question is the pen drive it goes into effect 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.700
 it has the name of the colony that we try to have 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:11.920
 three activists 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.810
 Okay, I'll have as an example 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:18.240
 I'm going to format them so the formatting is very simple 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.570
 right click on the other stones 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.030
 I'll be formatting 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.100
 it will open its fullness 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.020
 so if it will leave normal capacity it will already have the full capacity 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.730
 of the pen drive 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:36.230
 the file system and can play little the same as it appears here 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.390
 here you are 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:43.750
 right 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.270
 here you can change the name of your pendrive 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.270
 so I'll put it here 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:57.510
 and here you can select 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.910
 the formatting option 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:03.800
 you can do a quick formatting so it's done a lot 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.800
 quickly but it does not include 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:08.799
 she 

00:02:08.799 --> 00:02:14.669
 can not exclude some certain records from quiteria files been recorded 

00:02:14.669 --> 00:02:16.429
 on your pendrive 

00:02:16.429 --> 00:02:18.779
 for example many times when I 

00:02:18.779 --> 00:02:21.639
 I make a quick format of the pen drive 

00:02:21.639 --> 00:02:22.939
 at least 

00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:24.439
 and they have bride 

00:02:24.439 --> 00:02:27.439
 on dynamic systems such as mac and west 

00:02:29.139 --> 00:02:32.279
 I can see that she some hidden files 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:34.190
 There's nothing like that yet. 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.409
 even though I have recently formatted it 

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:40.409
 In case you're in a hurry, no time. 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.759
 you can use this 

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:47.759
 but if you are 

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:49.879
 unhurried 

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:54.749
 and can wait a bit I recommend that you do normal formatting without being 

00:02:54.749 --> 00:02:55.479
 fast 

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:58.699
 But how is a video lesson and I do not have 

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:59.959
 so long this way 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:01.909
 for fast formatting 

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:05.129
 it announces will be much faster than normal formatting 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:10.139
 so I'm going to start 

00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:13.119
 he will give me this warns you that saying that I will lose all the data that 

00:03:13.119 --> 00:03:14.949
 are inside the stones 

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:16.509
 don rock 

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:18.919
 he is going to be formatting 

00:03:18.919 --> 00:03:21.139
 or formatting pen drive 

00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:24.389
 it says the formatting is complete if you give it an ok 

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:29.010
 the French to the line and then you will see this stones already had the name that 

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:31.479
 You gave a full screen. 

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:34.899
 and you opening the stone event is empty 

00:03:34.899 --> 00:03:38.489
 so this is the best way for you to remove those old ones. 

00:03:39.339 --> 00:03:41.310
 What can you have with me? 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.310
 worked your pen drive another computer 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:48.749
 this also prevents you from your beginning said 

00:03:48.749 --> 00:03:51.009
 what really 

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:54.009
 the pendrive viruses they were 

00:03:55.539 --> 00:03:58.759
 it lodges in the system s 

00:03:58.759 --> 00:04:02.899
 of assets that cause the stones to be played automatically 

00:04:02.899 --> 00:04:08.399
 counters and with this new automatic production the virus already contaminated the 

00:04:08.399 --> 00:04:09.959
 computer files 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:12.589
 So 

00:04:12.589 --> 00:04:14.410
 Are you formatting your pendrive? 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:15.569
 right 

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:18.870
 Why can I have week age for a few days? 

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:22.930
 kravitz is very dangerous 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:25.189
 for you come in and for 

00:04:25.189 --> 00:04:28.509
 the computers on which miguel pedro goes 

00:04:28.509 --> 00:04:30.219
 for these people 

00:04:30.219 --> 00:04:33.300
 This was a quick video lesson but I think it's going to be great. 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.129
 help for many people 

00:04:35.129 --> 00:04:36.550
 I'll stay here 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:39.129
 continues exercising by fia dotcom 

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:42.099
 morning and has callsigns and do not forget
