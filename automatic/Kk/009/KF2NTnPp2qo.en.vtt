and Celebi doesn't take too much damage
so<00:01:30.570> I<00:01:30.600> decided<00:01:30.900> up<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.200> lead<00:01:31.380> sheet<00:01:31.590> on<00:01:31.710> it<00:01:31.740> or

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
so I decided up the lead sheet on it or

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.280 
so I decided up the lead sheet on it or
your<00:01:32.220> switch<00:01:32.460> maybe<00:01:32.729> but<00:01:33.329> he<00:01:33.420> blizzards<00:01:33.960> and

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
your switch maybe but he blizzards and

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.770 
your switch maybe but he blizzards and
that<00:01:35.220> does<00:01:35.400> a<00:01:35.430> lot<00:01:35.490> of<00:01:35.640> damage<00:01:35.939> because

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
that does a lot of damage because

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.100 
that does a lot of damage because
blizzard<00:01:37.110> likes<00:01:37.320> to<00:01:37.439> do<00:01:37.500> a<00:01:37.530> lot<00:01:37.710> of<00:01:37.740> damage

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 
blizzard likes to do a lot of damage

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:44.749 
blizzard likes to do a lot of damage
anyway<00:01:41.720> I'm<00:01:42.720> he<00:01:43.560> doesn't<00:01:44.100> stay<00:01:44.250> in<00:01:44.280> and<00:01:44.640> goes

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
anyway I'm he doesn't stay in and goes

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.359 
anyway I'm he doesn't stay in and goes
in<00:01:44.909> a<00:01:44.970> venusaur<00:01:45.390> as<00:01:45.810> I<00:01:46.560> recover<00:01:47.009> because<00:01:47.220> I

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
in a venusaur as I recover because I

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:48.499 
in a venusaur as I recover because I
predict<00:01:47.759> it<00:01:47.880> easy<00:01:48.000> they're<00:01:48.180> going<00:01:48.299> to<00:01:48.360> switch

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
predict it easy they're going to switch

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.230 
predict it easy they're going to switch
or<00:01:49.170> probably<00:01:49.829> go<00:01:49.979> hydro<00:01:50.310> pump<00:01:50.520> just<00:01:50.909> in<00:01:50.970> case<00:01:51.119> i

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
or probably go hydro pump just in case i

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.679 
or probably go hydro pump just in case i
switch<00:01:52.100> but<00:01:53.100> anyway<00:01:53.610> now<00:01:54.119> he's<00:01:54.299> into<00:01:54.509> this

predicting<00:02:14.610> my<00:02:14.760> switch<00:02:15.090> which<00:02:15.570> is<00:02:15.780> annoying<00:02:16.710> I

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
predicting my switch which is annoying I

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.850 
predicting my switch which is annoying I
decided<00:02:17.820> you<00:02:17.940> turn<00:02:18.210> out<00:02:18.420> and<00:02:18.660> it<00:02:19.590> does<00:02:19.740> about

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
decided you turn out and it does about

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.260 
decided you turn out and it does about
half<00:02:20.280> and<00:02:20.610> I<00:02:21.000> go<00:02:21.120> back<00:02:21.360> into<00:02:21.600> Celebi<00:02:23.120> for<00:02:24.120> the

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
half and I go back into Celebi for the

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:25.880 
half and I go back into Celebi for the
sleep<00:02:24.720> pattern<00:02:25.110> because<00:02:25.470> I<00:02:25.560> knew<00:02:25.680> he'd

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
sleep pattern because I knew he'd

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.750 
sleep pattern because I knew he'd
probably<00:02:26.130> do<00:02:26.400> it<00:02:27.170> so<00:02:28.170> Celebi<00:02:29.100> now<00:02:29.280> is<00:02:29.430> a<00:02:29.460> sleep

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
probably do it so Celebi now is a sleep

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:35.060 
probably do it so Celebi now is a sleep
powder<00:02:29.970> and<00:02:32.120> I'm<00:02:33.120> going<00:02:33.390> to<00:02:33.450> stay<00:02:33.660> in<00:02:33.980> cuz<00:02:34.980> I

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
powder and I'm going to stay in cuz I

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:36.350 
powder and I'm going to stay in cuz I
don't<00:02:35.130> know<00:02:35.370> what<00:02:35.490> moves<00:02:35.700> he<00:02:35.850> as<00:02:36.030> if<00:02:36.180> he<00:02:36.240> has

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
don't know what moves he as if he has

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:37.640 
don't know what moves he as if he has
anything<00:02:36.540> to<00:02:36.660> hurt<00:02:36.810> Celebi<00:02:37.110> but<00:02:37.320> it<00:02:37.380> does<00:02:37.500> that

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
anything to hurt Celebi but it does that

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.380 
anything to hurt Celebi but it does that
the<00:02:37.740> sludge<00:02:37.980> bomb<00:02:38.220> and<00:02:38.520> that's<00:02:38.700> just<00:02:39.090> great

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
the sludge bomb and that's just great

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.530 
the sludge bomb and that's just great
because<00:02:39.600> it<00:02:39.990> hurts<00:02:40.170> a<00:02:40.320> lot<00:02:41.060> he<00:02:42.060> makes<00:02:42.270> a<00:02:42.390> nice

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
because it hurts a lot he makes a nice

because it hurts a lot he makes a nice
prediction<00:02:42.930> here<00:02:43.260> but<00:02:43.440> unfortunately<00:02:44.340> luck

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
prediction here but unfortunately luck

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.510 
prediction here but unfortunately luck
is<00:02:44.910> the<00:02:45.030> best<00:02:45.240> of<00:02:45.390> him<00:02:45.620> he<00:02:46.620> actually<00:02:47.070> goes<00:02:47.280> the

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
is the best of him he actually goes the

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.780 
is the best of him he actually goes the
sleep<00:02:47.760> powder<00:02:47.970> on<00:02:48.330> my<00:02:48.480> switch<00:02:48.870> but<00:02:49.320> he<00:02:49.530> misses

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
sleep powder on my switch but he misses

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:51.740 
sleep powder on my switch but he misses
now<00:02:50.790> sleep<00:02:50.970> powder<00:02:51.150> i<00:02:51.270> was<00:02:51.390> pretty<00:02:51.540> bad

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
now sleep powder i was pretty bad

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.210 
now sleep powder i was pretty bad
receive<00:02:52.320> so<00:02:52.530> it<00:02:52.590> was<00:02:52.680> going<00:02:52.980> to<00:02:53.070> miss

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
receive so it was going to miss

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.190 
receive so it was going to miss
eventually<00:02:53.790> but<00:02:54.060> still<00:02:54.600> kind<00:02:54.780> of<00:02:54.810> sucks<00:02:54.990> for

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
eventually but still kind of sucks for

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.130 
eventually but still kind of sucks for
him<00:02:55.320> so<00:02:55.620> I<00:02:55.650> you<00:02:55.770> turn<00:02:56.100> again<00:02:56.940> and<00:02:57.210> he<00:02:57.990> almost

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
him so I you turn again and he almost

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.650 
him so I you turn again and he almost
dies<00:02:58.500> from<00:02:58.740> it<00:02:58.950> not<00:02:59.130> quite<00:02:59.490> and<00:03:00.210> he<00:03:00.300> does<00:03:00.480> go<00:03:00.630> to

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
dies from it not quite and he does go to

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.390 
dies from it not quite and he does go to
sleep<00:03:00.960> powder<00:03:01.140> and<00:03:01.530> hit<00:03:01.680> the<00:03:01.830> Celebi<00:03:02.250> this

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
sleep powder and hit the Celebi this

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.450 
sleep powder and hit the Celebi this
time<00:03:03.110> but<00:03:04.110> sleppy<00:03:04.920> doesn't<00:03:05.190> mind<00:03:05.340> being

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:05.460 
time but sleppy doesn't mind being

time but sleppy doesn't mind being
asleep<00:03:05.880> and<00:03:06.240> now<00:03:06.480> I'm<00:03:06.660> trying<00:03:07.440> to<00:03:07.500> predict

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
asleep and now I'm trying to predict

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.650 
asleep and now I'm trying to predict
what<00:03:07.950> each<00:03:08.370> other's<00:03:08.580> going<00:03:08.730> to<00:03:08.880> do<00:03:09.060> I<00:03:09.270> think

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
what each other's going to do I think

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.350 
what each other's going to do I think
finally<00:03:10.320> he's<00:03:10.470> going<00:03:10.650> to<00:03:10.710> use<00:03:10.830> sludge<00:03:11.100> bomb<00:03:11.360> so

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
finally he's going to use sludge bomb so

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.600 
finally he's going to use sludge bomb so
I<00:03:12.390> go<00:03:12.660> in<00:03:12.690> a<00:03:12.900> size<00:03:13.110> or<00:03:13.140> and<00:03:13.650> I<00:03:13.980> was<00:03:14.100> right<00:03:14.400> he

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
I go in a size or and I was right he

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.340 
I go in a size or and I was right he
does<00:03:14.820> go<00:03:14.970> with<00:03:15.060> a<00:03:15.150> sludge<00:03:15.390> bomb<00:03:15.600> and<00:03:16.050> it

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
does go with a sludge bomb and it

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.670 
does go with a sludge bomb and it
doesn't<00:03:16.530> effect<00:03:16.860> size<00:03:17.100> or<00:03:17.370> and<00:03:17.640> that's<00:03:17.850> great

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
doesn't effect size or and that's great

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.320 
doesn't effect size or and that's great
because<00:03:19.680> now<00:03:19.830> I<00:03:19.980> can<00:03:20.370> kill<00:03:20.730> the<00:03:21.000> stupid

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
a Salamence because any move that he'd

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.750 
a Salamence because any move that he'd
used<00:03:44.750> against<00:03:45.750> Lucario<00:03:46.320> would<00:03:47.130> be<00:03:47.340> resisted

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
used against Lucario would be resisted

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.390 
used against Lucario would be resisted
by<00:03:47.790> settlements<00:03:48.450> and<00:03:48.600> I'm<00:03:49.530> hoping<00:03:49.920> this<00:03:50.100> is

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
by settlements and I'm hoping this is

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.900 
by settlements and I'm hoping this is
adamant<00:03:51.060> but<00:03:51.709> so<00:03:52.709> I<00:03:52.770> can<00:03:52.920> be<00:03:53.010> faster<00:03:53.459> but<00:03:53.670> this

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
adamant but so I can be faster but this

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:58.370 
adamant but so I can be faster but this
is<00:03:54.030> actually<00:03:54.300> a<00:03:55.580> timid<00:03:56.720> electivire<00:03:57.720> so<00:03:58.260> I'm

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
is actually a timid electivire so I'm

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.260 
is actually a timid electivire so I'm
not<00:03:58.530> faster<00:03:59.040> and<00:03:59.190> it<00:03:59.250> cost<00:03:59.459> me<00:03:59.550> my<00:03:59.700> settlements

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:00.270 
not faster and it cost me my settlements

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:04.430 
not faster and it cost me my settlements
and<00:04:01.100> that's<00:04:02.100> kind<00:04:02.400> of<00:04:02.489> lame<00:04:02.810> so<00:04:03.810> I<00:04:03.959> go<00:04:04.290> on<00:04:04.410> a

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
and that's kind of lame so I go on a

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:10.190 
and that's kind of lame so I go on a
heatran<00:04:04.950> and<00:04:05.420> he<00:04:06.420> goes<00:04:06.660> into<00:04:08.870> politoed<00:04:09.870> which

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
heatran and he goes into politoed which

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.130 
heatran and he goes into politoed which
I<00:04:10.410> love<00:04:10.650> politoed<00:04:11.190> makes<00:04:11.610> me<00:04:11.730> sad<00:04:12.000> that<00:04:12.300> I<00:04:12.870> have

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:13.140 
I love politoed makes me sad that I have

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:15.949 
I love politoed makes me sad that I have
dead<00:04:13.380> she<00:04:13.650> heard<00:04:13.830> it<00:04:14.010> but<00:04:14.310> um<00:04:14.520> I<00:04:14.850> use<00:04:15.780> Fire

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
dead she heard it but um I use Fire

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:18.430 
dead she heard it but um I use Fire
Blast<00:04:15.989> on<00:04:16.650> it<00:04:16.799> and<00:04:16.980> it<00:04:17.130> doesn't<00:04:17.400> do<00:04:17.489> anything<00:04:17.730> I

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:18.440 
Blast on it and it doesn't do anything I

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.570 
Blast on it and it doesn't do anything I
predict<00:04:19.440> you<00:04:19.500> to<00:04:19.590> switch<00:04:19.799> by<00:04:20.010> the<00:04:20.070> way<00:04:20.250> so

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:20.580 
predict you to switch by the way so

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:22.400 
predict you to switch by the way so
because<00:04:21.000> though<00:04:21.210> i<00:04:21.239> didn't<00:04:21.539> use<00:04:21.630> earth<00:04:21.750> power

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:22.410 
because though i didn't use earth power

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:25.670 
because though i didn't use earth power
but<00:04:23.160> I<00:04:23.190> go<00:04:23.760> into<00:04:23.970> Celebi<00:04:24.390> and<00:04:24.750> he<00:04:25.230> puts<00:04:25.470> me<00:04:25.560> to

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 
but I go into Celebi and he puts me to

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.220 
but I go into Celebi and he puts me to
sleep<00:04:25.710> with<00:04:25.920> hypnosis<00:04:26.390> this<00:04:27.390> sleep<00:04:27.720> stuff<00:04:28.050> is

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:28.230 
sleep with hypnosis this sleep stuff is

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:30.230 
sleep with hypnosis this sleep stuff is
really<00:04:28.500> getting<00:04:28.770> annoying<00:04:29.070> how<00:04:29.850> I<00:04:29.880> go<00:04:30.090> into

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 
really getting annoying how I go into

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.150 
really getting annoying how I go into
size<00:04:30.540> of<00:04:30.750> it<00:04:30.840> and<00:04:31.020> he<00:04:31.530> actually<00:04:31.560> switch<00:04:31.950> it<00:04:32.070> out

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160 
size of it and he actually switch it out

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:36.650 
size of it and he actually switch it out
into<00:04:32.370> Islam<00:04:33.060> and<00:04:33.420> pulling<00:04:34.200> on<00:04:34.290> and<00:04:35.060> I<00:04:36.060> have<00:04:36.360> the

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.660 
into Islam and pulling on and I have the

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:38.330 
into Islam and pulling on and I have the
super<00:04:36.930> power<00:04:37.200> he<00:04:37.410> hasn't<00:04:37.650> seen<00:04:37.800> it<00:04:37.890> yet<00:04:37.920> so<00:04:38.310> I

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 
super power he hasn't seen it yet so I

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:41.570 
super power he hasn't seen it yet so I
decided<00:04:38.730> to<00:04:38.820> go<00:04:39.090> for<00:04:39.330> it<00:04:39.390> and<00:04:39.950> boom<00:04:40.950> superpower

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:41.580 
decided to go for it and boom superpower

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.570 
decided to go for it and boom superpower
chaos<00:04:42.090> is<00:04:42.300> and<00:04:43.200> pulling<00:04:43.560> on<00:04:43.650> and<00:04:43.920> I'm<00:04:44.280> one<00:04:44.460> step

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:44.580 
chaos is and pulling on and I'm one step

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:48.800 
chaos is and pulling on and I'm one step
closer<00:04:44.880> to<00:04:45.060> victory<00:04:45.090> here<00:04:47.450> so<00:04:48.450> now<00:04:48.600> he's

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:48.810 
closer to victory here so now he's

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:50.060 
closer to victory here so now he's
thinking<00:04:48.930> about<00:04:49.260> what<00:04:49.380> he<00:04:49.440> wants<00:04:49.650> to<00:04:49.710> send<00:04:49.860> in

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:50.070 
thinking about what he wants to send in

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:53.080 
thinking about what he wants to send in
and<00:04:50.340> eventually<00:04:50.760> sent<00:04:50.940> in<00:04:51.030> the<00:04:51.150> eve<00:04:51.330> i<00:04:51.540> er<00:04:51.570> and

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.090 
and eventually sent in the eve i er and

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:57.230 
and eventually sent in the eve i er and
I'm<00:04:54.090> thinking<00:04:54.150> maybe<00:04:54.870> it'll<00:04:55.320> be<00:04:55.350> a<00:04:56.340> prediction

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:57.240 
I'm thinking maybe it'll be a prediction

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:01.640 
I'm thinking maybe it'll be a prediction
into<00:04:59.570> heatran<00:05:00.570> so<00:05:00.780> I<00:05:00.810> go<00:05:00.930> into<00:05:01.050> Celebi<00:05:01.380> but<00:05:01.590> he

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:01.650 
into heatran so I go into Celebi but he

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:02.660 
into heatran so I go into Celebi but he
actually<00:05:01.770> predicts<00:05:02.190> the<00:05:02.280> switch<00:05:02.460> in<00:05:02.610> the

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:02.670 
actually predicts the switch in the

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:04.340 
actually predicts the switch in the
Celebi<00:05:03.000> which<00:05:03.210> is<00:05:03.300> a<00:05:03.330> good<00:05:03.600> prediction<00:05:04.140> in<00:05:04.200> his

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:04.350 
Celebi which is a good prediction in his

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:07.160 
Celebi which is a good prediction in his
part<00:05:04.620> and<00:05:04.830> he<00:05:05.340> goes<00:05:05.490> ice<00:05:05.790> punch<00:05:06.180> now<00:05:06.780> I<00:05:06.810> think

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:07.170 
part and he goes ice punch now I think

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:09.230 
part and he goes ice punch now I think
he's<00:05:07.260> gonna<00:05:07.350> overcook<00:05:07.740> again<00:05:08.130> and<00:05:08.400> predict

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:09.240 
he's gonna overcook again and predict

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:11.810 
he's gonna overcook again and predict
the<00:05:09.330> switching<00:05:09.630> heatran<00:05:10.530> again<00:05:10.830> so<00:05:11.460> i<00:05:11.490> decided

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:11.820 
the switching heatran again so i decided

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:13.640 
the switching heatran again so i decided
to<00:05:11.910> recover<00:05:12.270> and<00:05:12.570> i<00:05:12.630> was<00:05:12.750> right<00:05:13.050> he<00:05:13.230> goes<00:05:13.380> for

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:13.650 
to recover and i was right he goes for

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:15.470 
to recover and i was right he goes for
the<00:05:13.710> earthquake<00:05:14.130> and<00:05:14.400> that's<00:05:14.670> amazing

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:15.480 
the earthquake and that's amazing

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:18.950 
the earthquake and that's amazing
because<00:05:16.230> i<00:05:16.470> get<00:05:16.680> their<00:05:16.830> cover<00:05:17.100> off<00:05:17.370> and<00:05:17.960> that's

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:18.960 
because i get their cover off and that's

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:21.020 
because i get their cover off and that's
awesome<00:05:19.230> so<00:05:20.040> he<00:05:20.220> tries<00:05:20.520> to<00:05:20.550> predict<00:05:20.940> the

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:21.030 
awesome so he tries to predict the

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:23.000 
awesome so he tries to predict the
switch<00:05:21.300> and<00:05:21.420> he<00:05:21.570> ran<00:05:21.720> again<00:05:22.050> but<00:05:22.350> i<00:05:22.380> don't<00:05:22.890> want

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:23.010 
switch and he ran again but i don't want

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:24.440 
switch and he ran again but i don't want
to<00:05:23.070> risk<00:05:23.220> losing<00:05:23.610> heat<00:05:23.940> rain<00:05:24.090> because<00:05:24.300> i<00:05:24.330> kind

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:24.450 
to risk losing heat rain because i kind

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:26.360 
to risk losing heat rain because i kind
of<00:05:24.540> need<00:05:24.660> him<00:05:24.780> to<00:05:24.930> win<00:05:24.960> so<00:05:25.860> i<00:05:25.890> decided<00:05:26.220> to<00:05:26.310> go

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:26.370 
of need him to win so i decided to go

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:30.280 
of need him to win so i decided to go
for<00:05:26.550> the<00:05:26.610> psychic<00:05:27.060> and<00:05:27.470> damage<00:05:28.470> the<00:05:28.530> evo<00:05:28.920> and
