00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:11.120
 Today we want to connect an MFP8 connector to a data cable. 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:17.439
 For this we need a parallel pressing tool and a side cutter. 

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:33.620
 At the beginning, the insulation of the data cable is removed and the mesh becomes right 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:39.059
 and passed the cable on the left. 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:54.840
 Here it will be shortened, 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:04.539
 placed around the outer sheath and twisted. 

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:15.660
 The pairs of foils we divide, so that forms an outcrossing. 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:22.229
 Crossing out opens the pair of foils on the data cable. 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:27.750
 We push this pair of foil upwards a bit. 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:41.080
 Now we can scrape these. 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:50.410
 At this point, the pair of films detaches from the wire pairs without de-twisting them 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:54.239
 and thus to change the properties of the data cable. 

00:01:54.239 --> 00:02:11.860
 Then we take our vein manager to the hand and can the pair leadership on the basis of the color scheme 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:12.860
 to compare. 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:18.390
 The right pair leadership is orange-blue and green-brown. 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:34.510
 The data cable is untwisted, leaving the colored wires in the middle and the white ones 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:44.470
 Veins are on the outside. 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:53.220
 We shorten the veins by cutting them at an angle. 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:59.340
 Now we also unravel the blue and orange pair. 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:20.569
 Again the colored wires in the middle. 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:30.510
 We then cut off these pairs at a slight angle. 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:44.800
 Now the individual wires are introduced into the wire manager. 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:56.590
 Always one wire after the other, so that implement a quick introduction 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:57.590
 leaves. 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:10.140
 Then push the wire manager as close as possible to the pair of foils. 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:21.180
 With the parallel pliers, the wire manager is now pressed together so that the mounting aid 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:22.180
 opens. 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:35.300
 This lingers for the time being at the vein manager, until we separated our eight veins on the edge 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:36.620
 to have. 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:44.540
 This assembly facilitation does not damage the circuit board. 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:49.650
 Now we can remove it and squeeze the vein manager again. 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:53.910
 Now we take our case to hand. 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:05:02.930
 The installation of a twist protection ensures that the cable is not wrong 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:05.090
 fits around in the plug. 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:16.850
 So we can only introduce cable management into the connector in one way. 

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:29.530
 We enlarge the parallel forceps by one tooth and press the upper and lower parts together, 

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:33.010
 that the latching is heard. 

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:38.310
 The strain relief is made with the locking clip. 

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:45.790
 When you finally remove the dust cover, the MFP8 connector is professional 

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:50.560
 connected and can be inserted into any data outlet.
