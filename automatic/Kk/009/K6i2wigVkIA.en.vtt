here's are these some routine questions

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:06.420 
here's are these some routine questions
I<00:00:03.040> think<00:00:03.509> that<00:00:04.509> are<00:00:04.930> important<00:00:05.410> for<00:00:05.589> breast

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:06.430 
I think that are important for breast

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:08.910 
I think that are important for breast
cancer<00:00:06.790> patient<00:00:07.149> to<00:00:07.779> ask<00:00:08.020> or<00:00:08.349> future

cancer patient to ask or future
oncologists

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:15.270 

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:18.929 

since<00:00:16.270> breast<00:00:16.750> cancer<00:00:17.050> treatment<00:00:17.500> is<00:00:17.849> tend<00:00:18.849> to

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:18.939 
since breast cancer treatment is tend to

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:21.240 
since breast cancer treatment is tend to
be<00:00:19.090> very<00:00:19.330> comprehensive<00:00:19.660> I<00:00:20.320> think<00:00:21.010> it's

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:21.250 
be very comprehensive I think it's

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:26.280 
be very comprehensive I think it's
important<00:00:21.880> to<00:00:24.090> find<00:00:25.090> oncologist<00:00:25.900> you<00:00:26.020> can

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:26.290 
important to find oncologist you can

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:29.880 
important to find oncologist you can
truly<00:00:26.560> trust<00:00:27.300> who's<00:00:28.300> well-trained<00:00:29.020> usually

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:29.890 
truly trust who's well-trained usually

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:32.880 
truly trust who's well-trained usually
required<00:00:30.400> fellowship<00:00:30.939> training<00:00:31.290> and<00:00:32.290> also

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:32.890 
required fellowship training and also

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.080 
required fellowship training and also
they<00:00:33.280> they<00:00:33.910> need<00:00:34.210> to<00:00:34.360> be<00:00:34.480> board-certified<00:00:35.050> I

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
they they need to be board-certified I

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.820 
they they need to be board-certified I
think<00:00:37.090> another<00:00:37.269> important<00:00:37.840> issue<00:00:37.960> to<00:00:38.350> ask<00:00:38.500> is

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:38.830 
think another important issue to ask is

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:42.750 
think another important issue to ask is
to<00:00:39.820> see<00:00:40.059> if<00:00:40.420> these<00:00:41.010> medical<00:00:42.010> oncologists<00:00:42.610> or

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
around him and they need to take

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.639 
around him and they need to take
multidisciplinary<00:00:49.300> approach<00:00:49.600> by<00:00:50.290> which<00:00:50.500> I

00:00:50.639 --> 00:00:50.649 
multidisciplinary approach by which I

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:54.510
