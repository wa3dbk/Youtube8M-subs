00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 hello people under my sneakers though 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:05.850
 I asked as I do that because 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.890
 My shoes are always so clean 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.540
 and of course that's because of me 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.280
 clean them thoroughly because I'm not going 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.840
 happy with dirty shoes out of the house 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.150
 I think schools should always clean 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.430
 his as well as the nails and so on 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.810
 but that's not the topic now 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.640
 I thought I can do a video 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.859
 make because there something more to 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.460
 just say in a comment 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.010
 write 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.990
 and that's why I'm doing this video 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.740
 does best with things which are wrong 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.179
 can make 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.730
 and the more so in the spring 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.500
 clean wire brush and shoes 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.360
 but above all things like for example 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.190
 This is not a good idea at the schools 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.620
 to clean his shoes or 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.750
 even with shoes and events so 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.399
 you ruin the colors and that 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.500
 material and then of course you can 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.390
 also just a given the 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.800
 to make shoes clean but find there 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.090
 I 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.530
 does not do that much, respectively 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.840
 The school is not completely clean 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.190
 So that's wrong now because the schools 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.710
 latten clean 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.020
 but it's just not as good as with 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.910
 my method and the inside thing is 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.860
 the washing machine is not 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.020
 completely wrong but you have to consider 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.090
 that shoes are not anymore 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.680
 lived but mainly glued 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.780
 are because that just cheaper for the 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.880
 manufacturer is and therefore you can 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.409
 not everyone trains the washing machine 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.119
 throw because it can happen then 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.189
 that the glue dissolves and the shoes 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.869
 you just fall apart quite like that 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.790
 Often regret the school life please said 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.950
 Do not throw in the washing machine 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.200
 good example of this are the nxp yes the 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.509
 are just glued and if you are 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.920
 that too often throws in the washing machine 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.200
 then you will sooner or later 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.310
 but the study falls apart 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.659
 to throw the washing machine that 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.430
 of course, not entirely wrong, the 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.110
 First, do not do it too often 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.240
 with every little spot but when I am 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.080
 shoes really a bit dirtier 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.650
 are 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:48.420
 and really not clean with your hand 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:51.240
 to get what you are second 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.040
 It must be noted that the speed is not 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.960
 So high is from the drum so to 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.600
 set an example for a wash 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.250
 and the temperature at that is 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.990
 water is too hot then it dissolves 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.390
 glue the shoe and then if you are 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.100
 apart and of course that one 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.930
 not too often does that often get you in 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.790
 to the various schools of cleaning agents 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.740
 offered for example this 

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:12.750
 foam the white shoes on or off 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:15.570
 then there are erasers and 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.100
 different things are not 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:19.590
 Bad the products you can get 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.660
 his shoes on clean but not in 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.430
 every shoe store is the cleaning agent good 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.020
 For example, we only have this one 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.430
 look with his white shoes 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.470
 can tell again 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.959
 I find really very good the can 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.920
 I highly recommend it but it costs eight 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.270
 or ten euros 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.370
 that's why it's up to you 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:37.620
 Whether we want to do that or not 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.540
 Let's get what I want you for 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.459
 can give tips and would advise you 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.110
 and that is the first tip if you the 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:45.510
 shoe new that you have the shoe 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.280
 There are impregnated in schools 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.590
 impregnating agents but they are expensive 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.420
 but you also get impregnant 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.640
 at dm or rossmann costs the belief 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.900
 I have two euros two euros fifty and that 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.790
 is already the first step to it 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.739
 that the shoe is not that dirty 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:01.110
 will or will not be so fast dirty 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:03.600
 and the dirt is not so deep in 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:06.150
 can fix the shoe then of course 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:08.430
 if you live completely new shoes 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:11.280
 you then go straight to the swing 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:13.110
 celebrate or walk with your dog 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.670
 Of course, not so great for that 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:18.209
 Shooter gets dirty very quickly 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:20.730
 and that is annoying and so 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:23.010
 if you are happy about the shoe 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:25.500
 Maybe not so in the beginning 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:27.420
 things where the shoes directly dirty 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.040
 which can be very important 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:31.500
 even if you are innocent your way 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.750
 have you dirty or you already beautiful 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.130
 got clean pay attention to the 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.380
 Shoelaces when the shoelaces 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:39.810
 dirty, they are immediately the whole school 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:41.519
 totally dirty and I'll take 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.019
 Always take off the shoelaces in front of the zoo 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:45.090
 and we go to a container 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:47.330
 Washing then gives a little something 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:49.280
 felt the game was on it and then 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:50.750
 I cook water and dump it over and over 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.920
 then I let that act sometimes 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.600
 I'll take that too if that's the case 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.700
 example knows how laces are clear 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:57.650
 To last a bit like that 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:59.510
 and then if you can handle that 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:01.850
 I'm too hot then you can do that 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:03.650
 just a bit with my hands like that 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:06.440
 hurl as in the washing machine and 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:08.540
 rub it out a bit and then 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:09.710
 the laces are really too 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:11.600
 nice clean and if just the 

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:13.820
 shoestring clean they are directly the 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:15.080
 whole created the clean and the 

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:16.730
 Last point is of course the 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:17.780
 complete shoe clean so how 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:20.269
 said, if I really really 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:22.520
 Dirty are sewn and I have no 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:24.170
 I'm afraid I 'm older 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:26.000
 I also see them at the washing machine 

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:27.800
 as I said then you have to pay attention 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.840
 what I already told you earlier 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.250
 I have no example now 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.630
 dirty shoes because my shoes 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:35.120
 unfortunately clean 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:37.400
 but I'll show you that without it 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:39.890
 clean now and take it 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:42.560
 I'll just clean my shoe 

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:44.120
 want to make and an old boar 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:47.090
 so they will bristle now too 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:48.920
 not nice anymore or so and yes mine 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:50.060
 dog has already torn and everything 

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:52.130
 but that's not bad at all 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:53.900
 but does not need a new one for it 

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:55.430
 and as well as that too beautiful to the hair 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:57.860
 sand that's the way to the shoes 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:05:00.200
 Saturdays the forests are tough enough 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:03.230
 to remove the dirt but not to 

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:05.390
 hard so that breaks the material 

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:07.850
 make and for these are just these words 

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:10.130
 in boston you are doing very well and i am doing 

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:13.430
 then just a drop of hand soap 

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:15.560
 or detergent brush us and the 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:17.630
 protection and then I start the the 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:19.840
 therefore, the whole movement is circling 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:22.430
 unscrew school tray 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:25.010
 wherever there is dirt or on the whole 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:26.510
 then push here too, you can do that too 

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:27.030
 Make shoestring when you can 

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:29.790
 none 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:32.520
 the single washing it and then 

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:34.500
 I feel the whole show simple and 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:36.750
 let it dry and then see mine 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:39.000
 shoes really completely look like 

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:40.770
 New sometimes there's obviously find the 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.880
 then not super world then I do 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:43.890
 the whole thing again 

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:45.870
 it comes just the age of the shoe 

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:47.670
 but actually I get it 

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:49.260
 always every shoe cleanmen 

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:50.790
 shoe collection you can see how clean 

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.560
 my shoes are actually there 

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:54.780
 what works i do with it 

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:57.900
 my leather shoes clean like my 

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:59.700
 air force one or my timbaland it 

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:01.350
 everything is really clean with it or 

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:04.230
 the shoes are the same 

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:06.420
 Plastics are the mx 4 

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:08.400
 and substance-school events are so 

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:10.140
 I can really get everything back with it 

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:11.520
 picobello clean and we want 

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:13.080
 of course, when you think of the shoe 

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:15.210
 you have to clean it again 

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:17.460
 then impregnate on this protection 

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:18.780
 if slimmed down so that has 

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:20.940
 should not be forgotten then 

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:22.050
 lines to practice again and I hope 

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:24.240
 of course that video for you 

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:26.700
 was informative and helpful and like you 

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:28.950
 see is not expensive at all so 

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:30.450
 you either do not pay anything when you are 

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:32.040
 already an old boar bristle 

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:34.590
 you have or you can stop too 

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:36.450
 Buy a brush just like that at dm 

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:38.460
 does not cost much and you really have 

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:40.950
 long what it really nothing ackermann 

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:42.930
 do wrong and all the cleaning products 

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:44.850
 from the schools and so are optional that 

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:46.950
 Do you need to know if you feel like it 

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:48.360
 how much you spend on yours 

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:49.890
 hangs and then I hope 

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:52.490
 Of course we will see you in the next video 

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:52.490
 meet again
