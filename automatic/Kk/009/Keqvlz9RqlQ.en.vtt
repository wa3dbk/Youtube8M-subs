00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.330
 the initial stage you will learn a lot of questions 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.090

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:26.380
 bought on the style of boradis then 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.180
 when a newcomer comes to form on this 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:30.400
 you will advise skiing right there experts 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:33.070
 suburb here there and she looked 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:35.020
 mountain there is no looked round it to you 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.390
 you need in Greece then you need to sc 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.890
 what befell the question of giving it just 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.260
 tell you what it means 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:43.690
 what is behind these words means 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:47.860
 the first category is what is 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:49.660
 round and allmountine means allmountine this 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:51.410
 universal skis implying 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:53.980
 skating in different 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:56.300
 in the states of the city ​​in different states 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:58.730
 snow francis no scrap 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.020
 the question is all-Russian speak all the mountain 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.180
 this wagon 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:04.250
 as a rule it is a wider ski 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:07.490
 geometry is skis designed to 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:09.830
 skiing on the slopes either for some 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:13.340
 neighborhood slope but not freeride 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:15.979
 Well, just allowing to ride down the slope 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.970
 I do not feed this carving as tightly 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:19.620
 there are such skis 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.500
 with a wide range of applications for 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:24.240
 will catch the surface of death all round 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.970
 skiing it 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:30.090
 lies the simplest simplest carving 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.979
 skiing they can be good they can 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.860
 to be there can be quite simple 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:37.409
 more difficult but it's just carving skis 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.360
 which made special for skiers 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.159
 passion for skiing i mean people 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.049
 who came bora rest came 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.939
 there is a family there is no painting 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.310
 technicians wanted nothing just something 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.720
 that was yes here somehow ride it 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.470
 somehow in principle with this 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.869
 pleasure 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.680
 that is, we move the main criteria to 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.450
 this ginger is 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.010
 for one thing just so fast 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.750
 securely meet at the comfort of 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:00.780
 riding on them then man should be 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:03.799
 comfort he should rest 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.760
 Well, then go more technical skis 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:08.880
 pc versions 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:12.570
 cis with what it means cis with it 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:14.700
 skis and is characterized by the fact that they are taken 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:15.930
 called so because they are made in 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.170
 according to regulations 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:22.819
 federations of international of and called 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:24.799
 they are the same by topic 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:26.900
 the kind of disciplines in which they 

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:29.689
 apply in one discipline tsl it 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.819
 According to the nodal characterizes the box 

00:02:29.689 --> 00:02:33.639
 turning radius is 13 meters 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:36.950
 demand clean one and a half 

00:02:33.639 --> 00:02:39.349
 depending on the year of release because 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.780
 the requirement is replaced here are the skis which 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:44.389
 fis requirements 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:47.780
 god slalom category they are called sl 

00:02:44.389 --> 00:02:49.760
 just as gigantic according to gs or g with 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.230
 it only means with a large radius 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:54.609
 turn for a quick ride 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.609
 conforming to his standards 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:03.500
 nomination gs yes in the mortar of the world 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:06.750
 scales cheese counting here so said 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:08.760
 amateur analogue from silt gss this 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:11.550
 According to carving it is better with a short 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.440
 turn radius we are again there 12-13 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:16.140
 meters depending on the specific 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:18.210
 manufacturer of the model version of the race car 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:21.750
 and that is a quick carving my ring 

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:24.780
 it's turning radius he is 15 16 17 18 more 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:27.860
 faster skis straighter or let's say 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:30.440
 faster skating 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:32.420
 and there are still so-called categories 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:34.880
 here in europe we have no Russians 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:36.410
 It seems such a performance at all 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.900
 high produced is skis which is not 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:41.390
 fall into the scene versin it can 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:43.640
 to an average kid from a put radius it can 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:47.210
 be skiing some kind of middle waist again 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:50.270
 same length over dream usually higher cis 

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:52.730
 with they are also narrow gauge then jesus 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:55.190
 Natalia gave them because in sports 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:57.590
 what is accepted is better and and 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:59.090
 federation limit the width either here 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:01.130
 high performance it can be skis 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:04.310
 which is still not wide across 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:04.730
 mountain but already out of Russia there from 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:07.220
 and 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:09.380
 it is necessary who was born no longer sat down 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:11.150
