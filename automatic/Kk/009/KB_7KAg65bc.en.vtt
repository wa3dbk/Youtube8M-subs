the<00:00:10.980> attachment<00:00:11.639> is<00:00:11.730> a<00:00:11.759> pretty<00:00:12.179> good

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
the attachment is a pretty good

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.360 
the attachment is a pretty good
attachment<00:00:12.660> to<00:00:12.990> use<00:00:13.139> on<00:00:13.320> almost<00:00:13.920> every

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
attachment to use on almost every

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.939 
attachment to use on almost every
submachine<00:00:14.820> gun<00:00:15.000> but<00:00:15.599> I<00:00:15.630> wouldn't<00:00:16.350> use<00:00:16.590> it<00:00:16.619> or

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
submachine gun but I wouldn't use it or

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.179 
submachine gun but I wouldn't use it or
wouldn't<00:00:17.400> recommend<00:00:17.880> it<00:00:18.029> on<00:00:18.210> the<00:00:18.840> mp5k<00:00:19.410> solely

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
wouldn't recommend it on the mp5k solely

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.609 
wouldn't recommend it on the mp5k solely
because<00:00:20.400> the<00:00:20.580> mp5k<00:00:21.029> is<00:00:21.869> probably<00:00:22.230> the<00:00:22.380> one<00:00:22.529> of

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
because the mp5k is probably the one of

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.080 
because the mp5k is probably the one of
the<00:00:22.680> guns<00:00:22.890> that<00:00:23.039> recalls<00:00:23.460> the<00:00:23.609> most<00:00:23.820> in<00:00:24.000> the

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
the guns that recalls the most in the

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.089 
the guns that recalls the most in the
game<00:00:24.240> released<00:00:24.539> in<00:00:24.660> my<00:00:24.810> opinion<00:00:25.080> maybe<00:00:25.949> the

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
game released in my opinion maybe the

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.580 
game released in my opinion maybe the
famous<00:00:26.460> kicks<00:00:27.359> a<00:00:27.480> little<00:00:27.510> harder<00:00:28.080> it<00:00:28.260> depends

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
famous kicks a little harder it depends

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.169 
famous kicks a little harder it depends
because<00:00:29.010> all<00:00:29.250> the<00:00:29.340> guns<00:00:29.519> have<00:00:29.760> different

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
because all the guns have different

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.720 
because all the guns have different
recall<00:00:30.929> some<00:00:31.230> sway<00:00:32.009> to<00:00:32.070> the<00:00:32.250> right<00:00:32.460> but<00:00:32.640> this

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
recall some sway to the right but this

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.430 
recall some sway to the right but this
one<00:00:32.969> I<00:00:33.180> think<00:00:33.210> it<00:00:33.480> kicks<00:00:33.719> straight<00:00:34.050> up<00:00:34.230> into

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
one I think it kicks straight up into

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.990 
one I think it kicks straight up into
the<00:00:34.559> right<00:00:34.860> which<00:00:35.430> is<00:00:35.579> probably<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:35.969> worst

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
the right which is probably the worst

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.030 
the right which is probably the worst
type<00:00:36.420> of<00:00:36.450> recall<00:00:36.930> it<00:00:37.050> released<00:00:37.380> in<00:00:37.530> my<00:00:37.620> in<00:00:37.800> my

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
type of recall it released in my in my

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.639 
type of recall it released in my in my
opinion<00:00:38.399> is<00:00:38.670> and<00:00:38.910> you'll<00:00:39.780> see<00:00:39.960> me<00:00:40.110> in<00:00:40.140> a<00:00:40.320> second

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
opinion is and you'll see me in a second

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.080 
opinion is and you'll see me in a second
I<00:00:40.710> pick<00:00:40.890> up<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.129> famas<00:00:41.430> silence<00:00:41.940> which

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
I pick up the famas silence which

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.549 
I pick up the famas silence which
actually<00:00:42.300> comes<00:00:42.510> in<00:00:42.719> really<00:00:42.899> handy<00:00:42.989> later<00:00:43.320> cuz

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
actually comes in really handy later cuz

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.410 
actually comes in really handy later cuz
I<00:00:43.590> run<00:00:43.739> out<00:00:43.770> of<00:00:43.860> ammo<00:00:44.100> pretty<00:00:44.340> quickly<00:00:44.579> mainly

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
I run out of ammo pretty quickly mainly

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.350 
I run out of ammo pretty quickly mainly
due<00:00:45.570> to<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:45.750> rapid<00:00:46.200> fire<00:00:46.620> i<00:00:46.980> would<00:00:47.820> say<00:00:48.090> cuz

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
due to the rapid fire i would say cuz

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.430 
due to the rapid fire i would say cuz
you<00:00:48.390> start<00:00:48.719> off<00:00:48.780> with<00:00:48.930> about<00:00:49.050> a<00:00:49.170> hundred<00:00:49.260> and

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
you start off with about a hundred and

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.910 
you start off with about a hundred and
120<00:00:50.250> rounds<00:00:50.610> and<00:00:50.989> that's<00:00:51.989> usually<00:00:52.170> enough<00:00:52.469> but

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
120 rounds and that's usually enough but

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.220 
120 rounds and that's usually enough but

nothing<00:01:28.470> against<00:01:28.950> it<00:01:29.070> it's<00:01:29.189> a<00:01:29.250> decent<00:01:29.729> perk

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:30.079 
nothing against it it's a decent perk

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:32.899 
nothing against it it's a decent perk
anyone<00:01:31.079> who<00:01:31.200> uses<00:01:31.380> it<00:01:31.590> is<00:01:31.890> usually<00:01:32.340> a<00:01:32.490> smart

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
anyone who uses it is usually a smart

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.730 
anyone who uses it is usually a smart
strategist<00:01:33.479> I'm<00:01:33.840> not<00:01:34.110> really<00:01:34.290> sure<00:01:34.380> why

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
strategist I'm not really sure why

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.440 
strategist I'm not really sure why
people<00:01:34.770> say<00:01:35.250> it's<00:01:35.430> overpowered<00:01:36.030> of<00:01:36.119> that<00:01:36.299> it

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
people say it's overpowered of that it

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.030 
people say it's overpowered of that it
you<00:01:37.110> know<00:01:37.229> it's<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.350> same<00:01:37.560> as<00:01:37.590> cold-blooded

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
you know it's the same as cold-blooded

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.980 
you know it's the same as cold-blooded
on<00:01:38.430> modern<00:01:38.700> warfare<00:01:38.850> two<00:01:39.180> things<00:01:39.750> just

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
on modern warfare two things just

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.780 
on modern warfare two things just
because<00:01:40.110> people<00:01:40.380> rely<00:01:40.710> on<00:01:40.860> UAV<00:01:41.369> more<00:01:41.610> on<00:01:41.700> this

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
because people rely on UAV more on this

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:42.980 
because people rely on UAV more on this
game<00:01:41.970> because<00:01:42.150> they've<00:01:42.420> running<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:42.840> lower

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
game because they've running the lower

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.469 
game because they've running the lower
kill<00:01:43.290> streaks<00:01:43.619> and<00:01:43.799> the<00:01:44.640> Blackbird<00:01:45.060> you<00:01:45.329> need

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
kill streaks and the Blackbird you need

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.719 
kill streaks and the Blackbird you need
ghost<00:01:45.720> pro<00:01:46.020> to<00:01:46.079> avoid<00:01:46.500> that<00:01:46.530> I<00:01:46.710> believe<00:01:46.979> if<00:01:47.610> you

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
ghost pro to avoid that I believe if you

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.100 
ghost pro to avoid that I believe if you
can<00:01:47.880> avoid<00:01:47.970> it<00:01:48.149> to<00:01:48.420> land<00:01:48.659> that<00:01:48.780> guy<00:01:48.899> against

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
can avoid it to land that guy against

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.840 
can avoid it to land that guy against
turn<00:01:49.320> I'm<00:01:49.439> pretty<00:01:49.619> quickly<00:01:50.310> there<00:01:50.549> but<00:01:50.729> yeah

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
turn I'm pretty quickly there but yeah

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.730 
turn I'm pretty quickly there but yeah
you<00:01:50.909> need<00:01:51.090> them<00:01:51.299> ghost<00:01:51.750> pro<00:01:52.049> to<00:01:52.110> avoid<00:01:52.470> the

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
you need them ghost pro to avoid the

it is up and the hit as you can see here
the<00:02:37.819> famas<00:02:38.209> is<00:02:38.360> coming<00:02:38.600> in<00:02:38.690> useful<00:02:38.810> isn't

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:39.319 
the famas is coming in useful isn't

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:41.020 
the famas is coming in useful isn't
actually<00:02:39.500> the<00:02:39.709> one<00:02:39.920> I<00:02:39.950> picked<00:02:40.040> up<00:02:40.640> i<00:02:40.760> think<00:02:40.790> the

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
actually the one I picked up i think the

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.180 
actually the one I picked up i think the
other<00:02:41.150> woman<00:02:41.269> i<00:02:41.420> replace<00:02:42.349> it<00:02:42.560> with<00:02:42.650> this<00:02:42.830> or

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
other woman i replace it with this or

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.850 
other woman i replace it with this or
maybe<00:02:43.370> my<00:02:43.610> mp5<00:02:44.000> k<00:02:44.060> and<00:02:44.569> that<00:02:45.500> right<00:02:45.650> there<00:02:45.709> i

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
maybe my mp5 k and that right there i

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:47.500 
maybe my mp5 k and that right there i
get<00:02:46.040> my<00:02:46.100> Blackbird<00:02:46.550> and<00:02:46.790> also<00:02:47.150> you<00:02:47.209> can<00:02:47.360> see

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
get my Blackbird and also you can see

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.500 
get my Blackbird and also you can see
that<00:02:47.540> all<00:02:47.930> on<00:02:48.560> the<00:02:48.709> map<00:02:48.890> and<00:02:49.150> this<00:02:50.150> is<00:02:50.299> quite

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
that all on the map and this is quite

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:52.720 
that all on the map and this is quite
lucky<00:02:51.230> but<00:02:51.560> i<00:02:51.590> guess<00:02:51.769> it<00:02:51.920> isn't<00:02:52.190> really<00:02:52.400> lucky

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
lucky but i guess it isn't really lucky

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:54.670 
lucky but i guess it isn't really lucky
because<00:02:52.760> i'm<00:02:53.000> using<00:02:53.030> the<00:02:53.269> famas<00:02:53.600> which<00:02:54.500> is

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
because i'm using the famas which is

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.830 
because i'm using the famas which is
amazing<00:02:55.280> up<00:02:55.519> close<00:02:55.760> which<00:02:56.239> is<00:02:56.360> kind<00:02:56.660> of<00:02:56.690> weird

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
amazing up close which is kind of weird

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.990 
amazing up close which is kind of weird
i<00:02:57.019> it's<00:02:57.500> almost<00:02:57.860> like<00:02:58.130> a<00:02:58.160> submachine<00:02:58.819> gun

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
i it's almost like a submachine gun

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.720 
i it's almost like a submachine gun
except<00:02:59.299> it<00:02:59.420> doesn't<00:02:59.630> give<00:02:59.840> you<00:02:59.930> that<00:03:00.110> extra

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
except it doesn't give you that extra

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.059

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
free on this game I might have turned it

free on this game I might have turned it
up<00:03:33.739> to<00:03:34.040> four<00:03:34.489> but<00:03:34.670> when<00:03:35.120> I<00:03:35.150> start<00:03:35.480> playing<00:03:35.690> in

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
up to four but when I start playing in

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:37.630 
up to four but when I start playing in
the<00:03:36.079> morning<00:03:36.709> or<00:03:36.799> whatever<00:03:36.859> wet<00:03:37.310> like<00:03:37.519> my

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:37.640 
the morning or whatever wet like my

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:39.039 
the morning or whatever wet like my
first<00:03:37.820> few<00:03:38.030> games<00:03:38.180> I<00:03:38.390> put<00:03:38.570> it<00:03:38.630> on<00:03:38.690> free<00:03:38.930> because

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:39.049 
first few games I put it on free because

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:43.509 
first few games I put it on free because
it<00:03:39.170> feels<00:03:39.350> really<00:03:39.730> weird<00:03:40.730> and<00:03:41.079> I<00:03:42.079> also<00:03:43.010> like<00:03:43.489> to

00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:43.519 
it feels really weird and I also like to

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:45.099 
it feels really weird and I also like to
admit<00:03:43.670> I'd<00:03:43.880> also<00:03:44.060> like<00:03:44.329> to<00:03:44.390> mention<00:03:44.540> sorry

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:45.109 
admit I'd also like to mention sorry

00:03:45.109 --> 00:03:46.690 
admit I'd also like to mention sorry
that<00:03:45.320> the<00:03:45.739> reason<00:03:45.980> i<00:03:46.040> haven't<00:03:46.070> uploaded<00:03:46.400> the

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:46.700 
that the reason i haven't uploaded the

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:48.729 
that the reason i haven't uploaded the
commentariat<00:03:47.150> almost<00:03:47.450> a<00:03:47.570> week<00:03:47.870> is<00:03:48.200> them

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:48.739 
commentariat almost a week is them

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:50.620 
commentariat almost a week is them
somewhat<00:03:49.700> really<00:03:49.880> sure<00:03:50.060> why<00:03:50.180> it<00:03:50.239> is<00:03:50.359> i<00:03:50.450> think

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:50.630 
somewhat really sure why it is i think

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:51.789 
somewhat really sure why it is i think
it<00:03:50.690> might<00:03:50.780> because<00:03:51.049> the<00:03:51.079> weather<00:03:51.380> if<00:03:51.590> he<00:03:51.739> is

00:03:51.789 --> 00:03:51.799 
it might because the weather if he is

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:54.250 
it might because the weather if he is
like<00:03:52.010> really<00:03:52.040> really<00:03:52.609> cold<00:03:52.880> in<00:03:53.540> the<00:03:53.900> minuses

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
like really really cold in the minuses

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.110 
like really really cold in the minuses
it's<00:03:54.530> like<00:03:54.680> minus<00:03:55.010> five<00:03:55.310> last<00:03:55.609> night<00:03:55.850> which<00:03:56.000> is

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
it's like minus five last night which is

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.090 
it's like minus five last night which is
pretty<00:03:56.690> damn<00:03:56.959> cold<00:03:57.140> especially<00:03:57.350> for<00:03:57.739> november

00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.100 
pretty damn cold especially for november

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.100 
pretty damn cold especially for november
and<00:03:59.190> I<00:03:59.640> think<00:03:59.910> the<00:04:00.030> reason<00:04:00.300> I<00:04:00.570> didn't<00:04:00.870> upload

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:01.110 
and I think the reason I didn't upload

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:02.930 
and I think the reason I didn't upload
anything<00:04:01.590> was<00:04:01.830> basically<00:04:02.250> because<00:04:02.550> I<00:04:02.580> felt

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
anything was basically because I felt

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.920 
anything was basically because I felt
lazy<00:04:03.710> which<00:04:05.030> I'm<00:04:06.030> sure<00:04:06.330> a<00:04:06.360> lot<00:04:06.510> of<00:04:06.660> you<00:04:06.780> can

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
lazy which I'm sure a lot of you can

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:08.150 
lazy which I'm sure a lot of you can
relate<00:04:07.050> to<00:04:07.290> you<00:04:07.350> when<00:04:07.470> it's<00:04:07.590> cold<00:04:07.830> you<00:04:08.070> just

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160 
relate to you when it's cold you just

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.430 
relate to you when it's cold you just
feel<00:04:08.460> you<00:04:08.730> know<00:04:08.760> but<00:04:09.510> anyway<00:04:10.020> as<00:04:10.110> you<00:04:10.140> can<00:04:10.230> see

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440
