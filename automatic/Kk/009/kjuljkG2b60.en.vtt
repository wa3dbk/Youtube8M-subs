00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:19.860
 let's first use a grapefruit 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:22.039
 whenever we use a citrus there's 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:25.070
 to make a small base 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:27.710
 since these are spherical and can 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:30.730
 roll I know then what are we going to 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:33.590
 see with help a sharp knife we are going to 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:36.800
 Remove the outer skin and skin 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:38.420
 inside until you reach the pulp to 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.699
 power 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.880
 see the live flesh or in itself the pulp of 

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:46.150
 our citrus 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:48.960
 with the help of a small knife we are going to 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:52.140
 make small incisions 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:56.640
 to take out the pulps that we 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:01:01.160
 we call supreme if it is only the 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.160
 pulp of our citrus 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.000
 without any seeds or anything 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:12.390
 ah 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:23.360
 we continue with the cut let's see 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:27.050
 now with an orange we use equally 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:30.310
 a base and from the top 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:32.780
 until the bottom we are going to cut 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:36.520
 our skin 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.520
 its inside and outside of the skin 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:41.390
 we proceed to 

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:45.049
 perfectly 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:49.090
 and so and cut them off 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:55.320
 ah 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.320
 Y 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:00.140
 they're going to come out with seeds it does not matter 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:03.730
 more we remove seeds to give it a 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.730
 little more aesthetic to our court 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.329
 ah 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:10.590
 Hello 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.850
 and finally we proceed with one of the 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.520
 most used citrus fruits more 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:20.410
 used that is the lemon and we're going to 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:23.410
 do the same step 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:25.990
 very carefully try to remove skin 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:29.450
 interior and exterior to be able to 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:34.310
 peel it and take out our pulp 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:36.700
 and even with a small knife a sharp edge 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.700
 we cut 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:43.260
 they are a little more complicated 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.290
 the pieces are going to come out 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.540
 i 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:50.110
 Y 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.110
 and 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:01.260

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.879

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:10.110
