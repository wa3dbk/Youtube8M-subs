I<00:01:25.810> walked<00:01:26.439> with<00:01:26.680> lions<00:01:27.130> not<00:01:27.490> really<00:01:27.939> but<00:01:28.119> kind

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:28.360 
I walked with lions not really but kind

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:28.880 
I walked with lions not really but kind
of

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
of

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.850 
of
so<00:01:30.060> how<00:01:31.060> come<00:01:31.270> I'm<00:01:31.570> in<00:01:31.630> here<00:01:32.140> and<00:01:32.439> you're<00:01:32.680> out

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:32.860 
so how come I'm in here and you're out

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.420 
so how come I'm in here and you're out
there<00:01:33.100> well<00:01:34.000> I<00:01:34.329> think<00:01:35.229> the<00:01:35.469> easier<00:01:36.040> answer<00:01:36.310> to

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:36.430 
there well I think the easier answer to

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:39.060 
there well I think the easier answer to
that<00:01:36.549> is<00:01:36.729> you<00:01:36.880> know<00:01:37.000> part<00:01:37.180> of<00:01:37.360> their<00:01:37.540> pride<00:01:38.110> the

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:39.070 
that is you know part of their pride the

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:40.679 
that is you know part of their pride the
interesting<00:01:39.310> thing<00:01:39.700> about<00:01:39.729> lions<00:01:40.329> is<00:01:40.509> that

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:40.689 
interesting thing about lions is that

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:43.620 
interesting thing about lions is that
they're<00:01:40.899> the<00:01:41.020> only<00:01:41.289> truly<00:01:41.560> social<00:01:42.100> cat<00:01:42.630> they

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630 
they're the only truly social cat they

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:45.630 
they're the only truly social cat they
live<00:01:43.810> in<00:01:43.899> prides<00:01:44.140> and<00:01:44.619> they<00:01:44.829> got<00:01:45.009> much<00:01:45.310> strict

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:45.640 
live in prides and they got much strict

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.850 
live in prides and they got much strict
family<00:01:45.820> groups<00:01:46.299> so<00:01:46.990> if<00:01:47.140> I<00:01:47.259> came<00:01:47.500> out<00:01:47.680> they

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:47.860 
family groups so if I came out they

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:49.740 
family groups so if I came out they
would<00:01:48.039> try<00:01:48.280> and<00:01:48.369> get<00:01:48.549> me<00:01:48.729> definitely

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:49.750 
would try and get me definitely

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:51.870 
would try and get me definitely

analogous to humans you'd say you know

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.550 
analogous to humans you'd say you know
they<00:01:52.030> really<00:01:52.360> rely<00:01:52.630> heavily<00:01:52.810> on<00:01:53.110> the<00:01:53.259> bonds

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
they really rely heavily on the bonds

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.440 
they really rely heavily on the bonds
they<00:01:53.680> have<00:01:53.829> with<00:01:53.979> their<00:01:54.159> their<00:01:54.729> family<00:01:54.939> unit
