00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.409 
through the area more times but you just
wrap<00:04:28.500> it<00:04:28.530> around<00:04:28.740> the<00:04:28.980> brush<00:04:29.190> and<00:04:29.520> blow-dry<00:04:30.390> it

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:30.419 
wrap it around the brush and blow-dry it

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:34.720 
wrap it around the brush and blow-dry it
straight<00:04:30.930> up<00:04:31.140> and<00:04:31.410> pull<00:04:31.710> it<00:04:31.860> forward<00:04:32.190> a<00:04:32.490> little

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:34.730 

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:55.270 

just<00:04:35.730> keep<00:04:35.940> doing<00:04:36.360> that

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:55.280 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:58.189 

so<00:04:56.280> there<00:04:56.520> we<00:04:56.669> have<00:04:56.699> the<00:04:56.910> finish<00:04:57.419> to<00:04:57.630> blow<00:04:57.840> dry

00:04:58.189 --> 00:04:58.199 
so there we have the finish to blow dry

00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:00.830 
so there we have the finish to blow dry
as<00:04:58.530> you<00:04:59.160> can<00:04:59.310> see<00:04:59.520> it's<00:04:59.699> definitely<00:05:00.569> not

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:00.840 
as you can see it's definitely not

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:03.499 
as you can see it's definitely not
totally<00:05:01.500> straight<00:05:01.919> and<00:05:02.069> smooth<00:05:02.400> so<00:05:03.180> if<00:05:03.330> you're

00:05:03.499 --> 00:05:03.509 
totally straight and smooth so if you're

00:05:03.509 --> 00:05:05.120 
totally straight and smooth so if you're
like<00:05:03.720> me<00:05:03.930> and<00:05:03.960> you<00:05:04.110> have<00:05:04.199> curly<00:05:04.560> hair<00:05:04.590> what<00:05:05.099> I

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:05.130 
like me and you have curly hair what I

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:07.400 
like me and you have curly hair what I
do<00:05:05.250> is<00:05:05.669> I<00:05:05.880> just<00:05:05.940> section<00:05:06.539> it<00:05:06.630> all<00:05:06.840> off<00:05:07.110> again

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:07.410 
do is I just section it all off again

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:09.680 
do is I just section it all off again
the<00:05:07.440> same<00:05:07.770> exact<00:05:08.160> way<00:05:08.430> and<00:05:08.759> I<00:05:09.150> run<00:05:09.389> through<00:05:09.630> it

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:09.690 
the same exact way and I run through it

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:13.820 
the same exact way and I run through it
with<00:05:09.930> a<00:05:10.169> straightener<00:05:10.830> I<00:05:12.530> take<00:05:13.530> little

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:13.830 
with a straightener I take little

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:15.650 
with a straightener I take little
section<00:05:14.220> by<00:05:14.340> section<00:05:14.370> and<00:05:15.000> I<00:05:15.120> comb<00:05:15.389> through<00:05:15.630> it

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:15.660 
section by section and I comb through it

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:17.540 
section by section and I comb through it
before<00:05:15.840> I<00:05:16.080> straighten<00:05:16.560> it<00:05:16.770> just<00:05:17.069> so<00:05:17.250> I<00:05:17.280> make

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:17.550 
before I straighten it just so I make

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:20.300 
before I straighten it just so I make
sure<00:05:17.580> I'm<00:05:17.940> not<00:05:18.120> straining<00:05:19.110> in<00:05:19.380> any<00:05:19.560> knots<00:05:19.889> or

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:20.310 
sure I'm not straining in any knots or

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:22.600 
sure I'm not straining in any knots or
anything<00:05:20.849> and<00:05:21.150> make<00:05:21.240> sure<00:05:21.300> the<00:05:21.509> hair<00:05:21.630> smooth

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:22.610 
anything and make sure the hair smooth

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:25.100 
anything and make sure the hair smooth
and<00:05:23.610> I<00:05:23.669> just<00:05:23.849> go<00:05:24.060> around<00:05:24.240> just<00:05:24.780> like<00:05:24.900> i<00:05:25.080> did

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:25.110 
and I just go around just like i did

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:28.460 
and I just go around just like i did
with<00:05:25.380> blow<00:05:25.620> drying<00:05:26.449> the<00:05:27.449> strainer<00:05:27.780> i'm<00:05:27.990> using

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:28.470 
with blow drying the strainer i'm using

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:30.950 
with blow drying the strainer i'm using
is<00:05:28.590> a<00:05:28.620> Revlon<00:05:29.340> strainer<00:05:29.940> that<00:05:30.270> is<00:05:30.419> not<00:05:30.599> sold

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:30.960 
is a Revlon strainer that is not sold

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:34.730 
is a Revlon strainer that is not sold
anymore<00:05:31.259> so<00:05:32.009> don't<00:05:32.599> even<00:05:33.599> bother<00:05:34.080> trying<00:05:34.500> to

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:34.740 
anymore so don't even bother trying to

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:42.830 
anymore so don't even bother trying to
find<00:05:35.039> it<00:05:35.280> because<00:05:35.400> you<00:05:35.610> won't<00:05:35.820> find<00:05:36.090> it<00:05:41.360> and<00:05:42.360> I

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:42.840 
find it because you won't find it and I

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:44.900 
find it because you won't find it and I
also<00:05:43.139> curl<00:05:43.620> the<00:05:43.770> ends<00:05:43.949> under<00:05:44.340> a<00:05:44.370> little<00:05:44.639> bit

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:44.910 
also curl the ends under a little bit

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:55.700 
also curl the ends under a little bit
when<00:05:45.240> I<00:05:45.270> straighten

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:55.710 

00:05:55.710 --> 00:06:09.860 

I'm<00:05:56.370> just<00:05:56.580> going<00:05:56.730> to<00:05:56.760> take<00:05:56.940> another<00:05:57.090> section

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:09.870 

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:12.260 

and<00:06:10.440> you<00:06:11.070> can<00:06:11.280> really<00:06:11.490> do<00:06:11.730> this<00:06:11.910> with<00:06:12.090> any

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:12.270 
and you can really do this with any

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:15.470 
and you can really do this with any
length<00:06:12.630> of<00:06:12.870> hair<00:06:13.910> basically<00:06:14.910> this<00:06:15.090> is<00:06:15.150> the

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:15.480 
length of hair basically this is the

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:17.390 
length of hair basically this is the
basics<00:06:15.990> of<00:06:16.170> how<00:06:16.200> you<00:06:16.380> do<00:06:16.620> it<00:06:16.740> with<00:06:16.860> any<00:06:17.040> length

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:17.400 
basics of how you do it with any length

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:25.040 
basics of how you do it with any length
of<00:06:17.610> hair<00:06:22.940> so<00:06:23.940> once<00:06:24.120> again<00:06:24.300> when<00:06:24.660> i<00:06:24.720> get<00:06:24.900> to<00:06:25.020> the

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:25.050 
of hair so once again when i get to the

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:27.350 
of hair so once again when i get to the
top<00:06:25.380> area<00:06:25.980> i'm<00:06:26.250> going<00:06:26.520> to<00:06:26.580> do<00:06:26.760> the<00:06:26.940> exact<00:06:27.330> same

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:27.360 
top area i'm going to do the exact same

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:31.640 
top area i'm going to do the exact same
thing<00:06:28.580> i'm<00:06:29.580> going<00:06:30.210> to<00:06:30.360> take<00:06:30.840> the<00:06:30.990> section<00:06:31.440> I'm

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:31.650 
thing i'm going to take the section I'm

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:33.200 
thing i'm going to take the section I'm
going<00:06:31.710> to<00:06:31.860> comb<00:06:32.070> through<00:06:32.100> it<00:06:32.460> and<00:06:32.820> then<00:06:33.030> when<00:06:33.180> I

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:33.210 
going to comb through it and then when I

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:35.480 
going to comb through it and then when I
straighten<00:06:33.810> it<00:06:34.050> I'm<00:06:34.350> not<00:06:34.800> going<00:06:35.040> to<00:06:35.130> put<00:06:35.340> the

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:35.490 
straighten it I'm not going to put the

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:37.400 
straighten it I'm not going to put the
strainer<00:06:35.730> right<00:06:36.210> on<00:06:36.390> my<00:06:36.630> route<00:06:36.930> because

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:37.410 
strainer right on my route because

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:40.490 
strainer right on my route because
that's<00:06:37.830> where<00:06:38.670> well<00:06:39.540> look<00:06:39.810> like<00:06:40.020> I<00:06:40.140> just<00:06:40.170> stood

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:40.500 
that's where well look like I just stood

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:41.960 
that's where well look like I just stood
there<00:06:40.710> but<00:06:40.920> I<00:06:40.950> didn't<00:06:41.340> that's<00:06:41.610> where<00:06:41.850> your

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:41.970 
there but I didn't that's where your

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:43.490 
there but I didn't that's where your
volume<00:06:42.360> is<00:06:42.510> and<00:06:42.720> you<00:06:42.780> don't<00:06:42.960> want<00:06:43.140> to<00:06:43.260> flat

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:43.500 
volume is and you don't want to flat

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:45.250 
volume is and you don't want to flat
iron<00:06:43.530> through<00:06:44.070> your<00:06:44.190> volume<00:06:44.610> because<00:06:44.880> then

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:45.260 
iron through your volume because then

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:48.470 
iron through your volume because then
the<00:06:46.260> whole<00:06:46.470> point<00:06:46.710> of<00:06:46.950> it<00:06:47.040> is<00:06:47.100> being<00:06:47.460> lost<00:06:47.670> so

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:48.480 
the whole point of it is being lost so

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:50.660 
the whole point of it is being lost so
place<00:06:49.260> the<00:06:49.290> strainer<00:06:49.830> a<00:06:49.860> little<00:06:50.160> bit<00:06:50.280> above

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:50.670 
place the strainer a little bit above

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:54.710 
place the strainer a little bit above
your<00:06:51.170> route<00:06:52.170> and<00:06:52.350> then<00:06:52.680> pull<00:06:53.670> upward<00:06:54.270> and<00:06:54.570> then

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:54.720 
your route and then pull upward and then

00:06:54.720 --> 00:07:16.560 
your route and then pull upward and then
curl<00:06:55.170> the<00:06:55.380> ends<00:06:55.530> up<00:06:55.800> over

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:16.570 

00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:19.060 

now<00:07:17.570> I'm<00:07:17.690> going<00:07:17.810> to<00:07:17.900> do<00:07:17.990> my<00:07:18.020> bangs<00:07:18.440> I<00:07:18.770> do<00:07:18.830> my

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:22.040 
bangs in two sections I just slice it

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:23.980 
bangs in two sections I just slice it
halfway<00:07:22.460> through<00:07:22.670> and<00:07:23.060> then<00:07:23.150> I<00:07:23.210> first<00:07:23.690> I<00:07:23.870> do

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:23.990

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:27.440 
the bottom section and I just run the

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:30.040 
the bottom section and I just run the
straightener<00:07:27.860> through<00:07:28.190> them<00:07:28.430> as<00:07:28.790> you<00:07:29.720> can<00:07:29.870> see

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:30.050 
straightener through them as you can see
