00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.379
 good morning then we go with another 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.930
 presentation of dynafit shoes 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:22.529
 from finish make the biggest fair 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:25.770
 of europe in this case the new msp 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:29.460
 ultra link that replace the very 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:31.199
 successful panther trying to improve the 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.860
 strengths without polishing some 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:36.350
 weak details that had 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:39.320
 we start with their numbers at the price of 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:40.190
 recommended sale around 140 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.980
 euros 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:45.140
 weight of the 340 shoe that is a great 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.480
 advance is cut much respect in 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:50.809
 previous and the fall drop remains 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:54.650
 from heel to 8 mm fingers 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:57.440
 we go from bottom to top in the sole 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:01:00.470
 maintains the concept of the multi sole 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.900
 peace of vibrates then with stretches 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:06.470
 differentiated according to which zone 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:09.710
 Directional studs and one-way studs 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:12.560
 medium-high prominence and have been included 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.630
 some slots that you can see here in 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:18.110
 the sole to make the sole more 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:20.479
 flexible and massage this was a sneaker 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.369
 the panther that was born as a true 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:24.920
 both in terms of protection 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:27.050
 fabulous but with the new 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.910
 trends some people threw in 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:31.670
 lack a little more agility and 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:33.740
 flexibility while maintaining protection and 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.720
 that is what has been tried 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:39.619
 if we go up we see the 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:43.490
 midsole that keeps the uo motion 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:46.490
 as the brand calls they are different 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:50.960
 density of EBA is not according to where 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:55.369
 let's apply the weight or see here too 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:58.460
 much more caught in the heel is more 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:02:00.740
 sensitivity and more touch on fingers 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:03.020
 seeing also the protection that has 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.689
 and a little bit of these protections are 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:08.959
 lateral gills are new and the 

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:11.000
 we see also in the feline x 73 from the 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:13.190
 corporate air brand design 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.810
 that on the one hand they protect and zinc in the 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.959
 foot but on the other hand they allow us 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.640
 breathe is a solid plastic that is 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:22.010
 here stitched 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.740
 we see that it is a real sneaker 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:27.200
 very protected mountain here is the 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:29.060
 slide but that basically this sir 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.040
 so that if we hit a kick to a 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:34.610
 accidental rock our fingers carry 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:37.610
 there our nails arrive all together 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:40.580
 As you can see, the shoe is protected in 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.770
 all over and break some ultra goes to 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:44.870
 be probably as difficult as how 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:47.150
 was to break a panther that was 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.460
 probably the number one shoe 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:50.690
 of the market in terms of durability 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:53.570
 then we see here that has 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:56.840
 frame to adjust and tighten on the 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:58.580
 Ankle is not protection details 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:02.810
 reflective to give us security 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:06.050
 also and already closing up the mesh in 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:08.000
 a breathable grid but that 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:11.030
 It's also thick enough so that 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.330
 do not easily enter the gravel and what 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:16.760
 that comes from outside and as a novelty 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:18.620
 linked by cable that we see here and in 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:22.820
 this case linked by cable is collected 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:24.770
 with this cable this rubber that you see here 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:28.850
 in front of which we have already seen use 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:33.210
 in some other brands finally yes 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:35.820
 we see the template that counts 

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:38.910
 it's an orton template and it's made for 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:41.310
 live with a medium-high thickness of 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:44.960
 environment of the 46 millimeters that helps 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.960
 also in the cushioning 

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:50.090
 rivals in the good market place 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:52.220
 basically those shoes that 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:54.080
 try to ensure traction and 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:57.230
 protection to be able to run from 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:58.940
 Alpine marathon up great ultras or 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:01.280
 good for those people who have 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:03.050
 less habit of mountain maybe the 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:06.290
 most known in the market can be 

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:08.990
 well the best seller cascadia 10 the 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:11.550
 classic saga x the wings of Solomon in 

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:16.830
 this case the wings x pro 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:18.959
 of adidas as the response we will see how 

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:22.080
 behaves compared to them and about 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:24.000
 all we will see how he responds to the test 

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:26.430
 of more than 200 kilometers running with 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.010
 she does maintain the standards of 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:32.280
 durability that fixed its predecessor to the 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:35.580
 panther and has also managed to reduce 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:36.990
 weight and improve the attraction and 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:39.530
 agility with these details then without 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:42.690
 doubt will be a huge step forward 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:45.930
 we end up remembering their numbers 142 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:48.900
 I have recommended 340 grams of weight and 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:50.790
 an 8 millimeter drop thank you for 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:53.930
 your attention and until next time in 

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:53.930
