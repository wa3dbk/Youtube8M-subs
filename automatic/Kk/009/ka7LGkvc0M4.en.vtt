00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:29.750 
very similar to gas but I half and half

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:32.230 
very similar to gas but I half and half
I'm<00:04:30.470> using<00:04:30.770> the<00:04:30.919> super<00:04:31.099> seen<00:04:31.430> him<00:04:31.669> and<00:04:32.090> I'll

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.240

mix it half and half with with the chili
him<00:04:34.789> I<00:04:35.000> find<00:04:35.570> the<00:04:35.630> silly<00:04:35.810> him<00:04:36.020> probably<00:04:36.979> a

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:37.010 
him I find the silly him probably a

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:38.500 
him I find the silly him probably a
little<00:04:37.130> bit<00:04:37.310> overpowering<00:04:37.820> if<00:04:38.090> you<00:04:38.210> if<00:04:38.389> it's

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:38.510 
little bit overpowering if you if it's

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:40.570 
little bit overpowering if you if it's
just<00:04:38.780> on<00:04:38.900> its<00:04:39.050> own<00:04:39.169> so<00:04:39.800> I'll<00:04:39.949> just<00:04:39.979> mix<00:04:40.250> the<00:04:40.430> two

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:40.580 
just on its own so I'll just mix the two

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:43.560 
just on its own so I'll just mix the two
together<00:04:40.960> as<00:04:41.960> you<00:04:42.020> can<00:04:42.199> see<00:04:42.470> simple<00:04:43.159> as<00:04:43.250> that

of that probably as you can work out
thats<00:04:55.669> probly<00:04:55.820> about<00:04:56.030> 100<00:04:56.389> mil<00:04:56.570> mix<00:04:57.560> that<00:04:57.680> in

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:57.860 
thats probly about 100 mil mix that in

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:01.000

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:08.270 
I think it's quite alarming especially

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:09.969 
I think it's quite alarming especially
if<00:06:08.330> the<00:06:08.870> amount<00:06:09.169> if<00:06:09.350> you<00:06:09.440> ever<00:06:09.560> go<00:06:09.710> out<00:06:09.830> in<00:06:09.919> a

00:06:09.969 --> 00:06:09.979 
if the amount if you ever go out in a

00:06:09.979 --> 00:06:12.100 
if the amount if you ever go out in a
boat<00:06:10.160> you've<00:06:10.970> spotted<00:06:11.240> out<00:06:11.449> a<00:06:11.479> lot<00:06:11.750> of<00:06:11.840> spot

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:12.110 
boat you've spotted out a lot of spot

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:13.840 
boat you've spotted out a lot of spot
and<00:06:12.800> then<00:06:12.919> you<00:06:12.979> have<00:06:13.100> got<00:06:13.130> go<00:06:13.460> and<00:06:13.610> have<00:06:13.729> a<00:06:13.760> look

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:13.850 
and then you have got go and have a look

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:15.820 
and then you have got go and have a look
over<00:06:14.150> the<00:06:14.180> top<00:06:14.389> of<00:06:14.419> it<00:06:14.630> it's<00:06:14.990> alarming<00:06:15.350> and<00:06:15.740> I

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:15.830 
over the top of it it's alarming and I

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:17.320 
over the top of it it's alarming and I

think that's what what happened with the
carp<00:06:17.570> so<00:06:17.810> I<00:06:17.840> tend<00:06:18.139> to<00:06:18.229> go<00:06:18.350> on<00:06:18.470> the<00:06:18.560> darker<00:06:18.889> side
