know and the feel of those old bikes
yeah<00:03:44.069> it<00:03:44.250> does<00:03:44.489> remind<00:03:44.819> me<00:03:44.970> of<00:03:45.060> Evel<00:03:45.510> Knievel<00:03:45.930> I

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
yeah it does remind me of Evel Knievel I

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:49.160 
yeah it does remind me of Evel Knievel I
say<00:03:46.260> I<00:03:46.290> think<00:03:46.500> if<00:03:46.829> he<00:03:47.810> commissioned<00:03:48.810> you<00:03:48.930> to

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.170 
say I think if he commissioned you to

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:50.990 
say I think if he commissioned you to
build<00:03:49.439> a<00:03:49.560> bike<00:03:49.769> for<00:03:50.010> him<00:03:50.220> it<00:03:50.489> would<00:03:50.670> be<00:03:50.790> this

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
build a bike for him it would be this

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.300 
build a bike for him it would be this
exact<00:03:51.390> bike<00:03:51.599> just<00:03:52.079> needs<00:03:52.260> a<00:03:52.349> few<00:03:52.500> stars<00:03:52.829> on<00:03:53.129> it

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
exact bike just needs a few stars on it

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.670 
exact bike just needs a few stars on it
mm-hmm<00:03:54.000> yeah<00:03:54.239> because<00:03:54.989> it's<00:03:55.230> got<00:03:55.379> a<00:03:55.409> great

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
mm-hmm yeah because it's got a great

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.740 
mm-hmm yeah because it's got a great
kind<00:03:55.920> of<00:03:56.010> 70s<00:03:56.310> vibe<00:03:56.700> I<00:03:56.970> think<00:03:57.209> he'd<00:03:57.359> be<00:03:57.480> into

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
kind of 70s vibe I think he'd be into

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:58.069 
kind of 70s vibe I think he'd be into
that

00:03:58.069 --> 00:03:58.079 
that

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:01.009
