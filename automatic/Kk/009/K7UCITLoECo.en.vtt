a reef aquarium really needs to aim at

a reef aquarium really needs to aim at
25<00:00:57.790> degrees<00:00:58.239> you<00:00:58.989> can<00:00:59.230> get<00:00:59.440> up<00:00:59.530> to<00:00:59.560> 28<00:00:59.980> degrees

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:00.430 
25 degrees you can get up to 28 degrees

25 degrees you can get up to 28 degrees
and<00:01:00.460> get<00:01:00.670> away<00:01:00.910> with<00:01:01.090> it<00:01:01.239> but<00:01:01.360> you<00:01:01.510> really<00:01:01.780> need

00:01:01.889 --> 00:01:01.899 
and get away with it but you really need

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:03.450 
and get away with it but you really need
to<00:01:02.050> aim<00:01:02.200> to<00:01:02.350> get<00:01:02.470> it<00:01:02.590> down<00:01:02.770> again<00:01:03.100> as<00:01:03.220> quickly

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:03.460 
to aim to get it down again as quickly

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:04.229 
to aim to get it down again as quickly
as<00:01:03.670> possible

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:04.239 
as possible

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:05.730 
as possible
as<00:01:04.570> soon<00:01:04.780> as<00:01:04.899> you<00:01:05.019> start<00:01:05.290> getting<00:01:05.350> up<00:01:05.619> around

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:05.740 
as soon as you start getting up around

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.490 
as soon as you start getting up around
29<00:01:06.310> s<00:01:06.460> and<00:01:06.610> 30s<00:01:06.820> you<00:01:07.540> really<00:01:07.960> will<00:01:08.200> see

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:08.500 
29 s and 30s you really will see

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.160 
29 s and 30s you really will see
significant<00:01:09.250> losses<00:01:09.520> now<00:01:10.509> the<00:01:10.570> fish<00:01:10.899> aren't

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:11.170 
significant losses now the fish aren't

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:12.899 
significant losses now the fish aren't
is<00:01:11.469> worried<00:01:11.829> about<00:01:11.889> this<00:01:12.249> so<00:01:12.460> if<00:01:12.609> you<00:01:12.700> have<00:01:12.759> a

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:12.909 
is worried about this so if you have a

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:15.059 
is worried about this so if you have a
fish<00:01:13.179> only<00:01:13.389> aquarium<00:01:14.049> providing<00:01:14.829> there's<00:01:15.009> a

00:01:15.059 --> 00:01:15.069 
fish only aquarium providing there's a

00:01:15.069 --> 00:01:17.489 
fish only aquarium providing there's a
lot<00:01:15.340> of<00:01:15.460> oxygen<00:01:15.609> in<00:01:16.060> your<00:01:16.210> aquarium<00:01:16.539> the<00:01:17.170> fish

00:01:17.489 --> 00:01:17.499 
lot of oxygen in your aquarium the fish

00:01:17.499 --> 00:01:19.859 
lot of oxygen in your aquarium the fish
are<00:01:17.740> really<00:01:17.799> not<00:01:18.429> so<00:01:18.670> affected<00:01:19.179> the<00:01:19.299> fish<00:01:19.539> are

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:19.869 
are really not so affected the fish are

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:22.139 
are really not so affected the fish are
really<00:01:20.170> more<00:01:20.469> effected<00:01:20.950> by<00:01:21.100> the<00:01:21.159> lower<00:01:21.520> oxygen

00:01:22.139 --> 00:01:22.149 
really more effected by the lower oxygen

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:23.849 
really more effected by the lower oxygen
because<00:01:22.719> the<00:01:22.749> higher<00:01:23.020> the<00:01:23.049> temperature<00:01:23.679> goes

00:01:23.849 --> 00:01:23.859 
because the higher the temperature goes

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:26.489 
because the higher the temperature goes
up<00:01:23.889> the<00:01:24.579> less<00:01:24.759> oxygen<00:01:24.969> tends<00:01:25.659> to<00:01:25.840> maintain<00:01:26.020> in

00:01:26.489 --> 00:01:26.499 
up the less oxygen tends to maintain in

00:01:26.499 --> 00:01:28.709 
up the less oxygen tends to maintain in
solution<00:01:26.979> in<00:01:27.100> the<00:01:27.219> water<00:01:27.429> so<00:01:28.090> if<00:01:28.420> your

00:01:28.709 --> 00:01:28.719 
solution in the water so if your

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:29.550 
solution in the water so if your
temperature<00:01:29.139> goes<00:01:29.319> up

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 
temperature goes up

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.529 
temperature goes up
make<00:01:30.039> sure<00:01:30.249> there's<00:01:30.429> heaps<00:01:30.639> of<00:01:30.819> oxygen<00:01:31.329> in<00:01:31.479> the

00:01:31.529 --> 00:01:31.539 
make sure there's heaps of oxygen in the

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:33.330 
make sure there's heaps of oxygen in the
aquarium<00:01:31.810> and<00:01:32.079> you<00:01:32.499> really<00:01:32.859> should<00:01:33.069> get<00:01:33.219> away

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 
aquarium and you really should get away

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.069 
aquarium and you really should get away
with<00:01:33.639> it<00:01:33.759> as<00:01:33.850> far<00:01:33.880> as<00:01:34.090> the<00:01:34.299> fish<00:01:34.479> are<00:01:34.630> concerned

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:35.079 
with it as far as the fish are concerned

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:37.739 
with it as far as the fish are concerned
unless<00:01:35.590> it<00:01:35.889> was<00:01:36.039> extreme<00:01:36.579> like<00:01:36.789> up<00:01:36.969> around<00:01:37.119> 34

00:01:37.739 --> 00:01:37.749 
unless it was extreme like up around 34

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:41.279 
unless it was extreme like up around 34
or<00:01:38.020> 35<00:01:38.850> oxygen<00:01:39.850> will<00:01:39.999> also<00:01:40.420> help<00:01:40.659> save<00:01:41.079> the

00:01:41.279 --> 00:01:41.289 
or 35 oxygen will also help save the

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:42.870 
or 35 oxygen will also help save the
corals<00:01:41.649> because<00:01:42.130> if<00:01:42.399> there's<00:01:42.579> a<00:01:42.670> lot<00:01:42.850> of

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 
corals because if there's a lot of

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.879 
corals because if there's a lot of
oxygen<00:01:43.420> in<00:01:43.569> the<00:01:43.600> aquarium<00:01:43.929> you<00:01:44.380> do<00:01:44.560> tend<00:01:44.829> to

00:01:44.879 --> 00:01:44.889 
oxygen in the aquarium you do tend to

00:01:44.889 --> 00:01:47.429 
oxygen in the aquarium you do tend to
get<00:01:45.009> better<00:01:45.249> heat<00:01:45.549> dispersal<00:01:46.270> but<00:01:47.079> as<00:01:47.200> far<00:01:47.409> as

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:47.439 
get better heat dispersal but as far as

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:49.440 
get better heat dispersal but as far as
the<00:01:47.649> corals<00:01:47.950> are<00:01:48.039> concerned<00:01:48.399> you<00:01:48.819> really<00:01:49.179> need

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
the corals are concerned you really need

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.859 
the corals are concerned you really need
to<00:01:49.630> aim<00:01:49.779> for<00:01:50.020> them<00:01:50.170> to<00:01:50.349> be<00:01:50.499> 25<00:01:51.039> degrees

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
to aim for them to be 25 degrees

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.389 
to aim for them to be 25 degrees
particularly<00:01:52.869> for<00:01:53.020> small<00:01:53.259> aquariums<00:01:53.859> what

00:01:54.389 --> 00:01:54.399 
particularly for small aquariums what

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:56.910 
particularly for small aquariums what
people<00:01:54.759> do<00:01:54.880> in<00:01:54.999> emergencies<00:01:55.689> is<00:01:55.929> keep<00:01:56.649> frozen

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
people do in emergencies is keep frozen

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.249 
people do in emergencies is keep frozen
drink<00:01:57.369> bottles<00:01:57.700> in<00:01:57.819> their<00:01:57.999> freezer<00:01:58.299> and<00:01:58.659> drop
