all together we use anesthesia the birds
are<00:05:03.100> under<00:05:03.310> anesthetic<00:05:03.700> the<00:05:04.000> whole<00:05:04.150> time<00:05:04.450> we

are under anesthetic the whole time we

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:08.010 
are under anesthetic the whole time we
give<00:05:05.110> them<00:05:05.290> also<00:05:05.710> additional<00:05:06.870> analgesic<00:05:07.870> or

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:08.020 
give them also additional analgesic or

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:10.830 
give them also additional analgesic or

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:10.840 
pain relief following the surgery so

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:12.330 
pain relief following the surgery so
they<00:05:10.990> not<00:05:11.140> feeling<00:05:11.500> any<00:05:11.650> pain<00:05:11.920> when<00:05:12.190> we

they not feeling any pain when we

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:14.010 
they not feeling any pain when we
release<00:05:12.670> them<00:05:12.880> here<00:05:13.210> to<00:05:13.780> give<00:05:13.930> them

ringer's solution and the surgery

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:23.640 
ringer's solution and the surgery
basically<00:05:21.820> allows<00:05:22.090> us<00:05:22.300> to<00:05:22.480> implant<00:05:23.200> a<00:05:23.410> little

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:23.650 
basically allows us to implant a little

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:25.440 
basically allows us to implant a little
transmitter<00:05:24.010> in<00:05:24.460> there<00:05:24.760> in<00:05:25.030> one<00:05:25.240> of<00:05:25.270> their

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:25.450 
transmitter in there in one of their

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:28.650 
transmitter in there in one of their
little<00:05:25.690> air<00:05:25.810> sacs<00:05:26.140> and<00:05:27.180> as<00:05:28.180> you<00:05:28.330> can<00:05:28.480> see<00:05:28.510> a

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:28.660 
little air sacs and as you can see a

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:30.420 
little air sacs and as you can see a
little<00:05:28.900> antenna<00:05:29.350> that<00:05:29.560> comes<00:05:29.890> out<00:05:30.070> through

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:30.430 
little antenna that comes out through

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:33.150 
little antenna that comes out through
the<00:05:30.550> skin<00:05:31.020> through<00:05:32.020> a<00:05:32.050> little<00:05:32.380> port<00:05:32.770> that

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:33.160 
the skin through a little port that

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:36.060 
the skin through a little port that
basically<00:05:33.790> makes<00:05:34.090> use<00:05:34.330> of<00:05:34.890> human<00:05:35.890> technology

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:36.070 
basically makes use of human technology

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:39.180 
basically makes use of human technology
there's<00:05:36.910> a<00:05:36.970> little<00:05:37.840> cuff<00:05:38.050> there<00:05:38.350> that's<00:05:38.890> used

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:39.190 
there's a little cuff there that's used

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:41.820 
there's a little cuff there that's used
in<00:05:39.490> peritoneal<00:05:39.970> dialysis<00:05:40.660> stuff<00:05:40.960> human

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:41.830 
in peritoneal dialysis stuff human

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:44.790 
in peritoneal dialysis stuff human
patients<00:05:42.250> that<00:05:42.970> we<00:05:43.090> suture<00:05:43.930> into<00:05:44.380> the<00:05:44.500> skin

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:44.800 
patients that we suture into the skin

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:47.400 
patients that we suture into the skin
and<00:05:45.330> allows<00:05:46.330> the<00:05:46.570> antenna<00:05:46.870> to<00:05:47.050> come<00:05:47.260> out

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:47.410 
and allows the antenna to come out

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:49.790 
and allows the antenna to come out
without<00:05:47.680> causing<00:05:48.160> the<00:05:48.220> bird<00:05:48.370> any<00:05:48.580> problems

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:49.800 
without causing the bird any problems

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:52.260 
without causing the bird any problems
other<00:05:50.800> than<00:05:50.830> that<00:05:51.130> they<00:05:51.610> usually<00:05:51.940> do<00:05:52.060> pretty

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:52.270 
other than that they usually do pretty

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:54.600 
other than that they usually do pretty
well<00:05:52.540> they<00:05:52.870> live<00:05:53.140> for<00:05:53.410> years<00:05:53.650> with<00:05:54.010> the<00:05:54.040> with

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:54.610 
well they live for years with the with

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:56.370 
well they live for years with the with
the<00:05:54.730> transmitters<00:05:55.270> in<00:05:55.300> with<00:05:55.600> no<00:05:55.720> problems<00:05:56.170> and

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:56.380 
the transmitters in with no problems and

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:57.630 
the transmitters in with no problems and
the<00:05:56.530> transmitters<00:05:57.040> will<00:05:57.190> last<00:05:57.370> for<00:05:57.580> a<00:05:57.610> couple

00:05:57.630 --> 00:05:57.640 
the transmitters will last for a couple

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:01.350 
the transmitters will last for a couple
years<00:05:58.680> as<00:05:59.680> dr.<00:06:00.100> Olson<00:06:00.430> said<00:06:00.670> we'll<00:06:01.090> be<00:06:01.210> able<00:06:01.270> to

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:01.360 
years as dr. Olson said we'll be able to

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.060 
years as dr. Olson said we'll be able to
track<00:06:01.480> these<00:06:01.690> birds<00:06:01.990> for<00:06:02.230> with<00:06:02.680> any<00:06:02.830> luck<00:06:02.920> a

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:03.070 
track these birds for with any luck a

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:05.010 
track these birds for with any luck a
couple<00:06:03.460> years<00:06:03.670> initially<00:06:04.120> will<00:06:04.540> be<00:06:04.690> will<00:06:04.990> be

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:05.020 
couple years initially will be will be

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:08.010 
couple years initially will be will be
able<00:06:05.200> to<00:06:05.320> get<00:06:05.500> locations<00:06:06.370> daily<00:06:07.150> for<00:06:07.960> the

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:08.020 
able to get locations daily for the

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:09.810 
able to get locations daily for the
first<00:06:08.230> 10<00:06:08.440> days<00:06:08.470> or<00:06:08.860> so<00:06:08.890> and<00:06:09.250> then<00:06:09.310> every<00:06:09.580> third

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:09.820 
first 10 days or so and then every third

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:11.790 
first 10 days or so and then every third
day<00:06:09.850> for<00:06:10.630> a<00:06:10.660> couple<00:06:10.960> months<00:06:11.080> until<00:06:11.410> we<00:06:11.680> know

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:11.800 
day for a couple months until we know

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:12.900 
day for a couple months until we know
that<00:06:12.010> they're<00:06:12.130> going<00:06:12.220> to<00:06:12.280> be<00:06:12.400> on<00:06:12.520> the<00:06:12.610> breeding

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:12.910 
that they're going to be on the breeding

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:15.090 
that they're going to be on the breeding
grounds<00:06:13.210> then<00:06:13.900> we'll<00:06:14.050> only<00:06:14.230> track<00:06:14.560> them<00:06:14.770> only

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:15.100 
grounds then we'll only track them only

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:16.920 
grounds then we'll only track them only
get<00:06:15.220> locations<00:06:15.700> once<00:06:15.940> every<00:06:16.240> 10<00:06:16.540> days<00:06:16.570> or<00:06:16.900> so

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:16.930 
get locations once every 10 days or so

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:19.380 
get locations once every 10 days or so
and<00:06:17.350> then<00:06:17.410> we'll<00:06:17.800> get<00:06:17.920> more<00:06:18.610> locations<00:06:19.180> come

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:19.390 
and then we'll get more locations come

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:21.180 
and then we'll get more locations come
fall<00:06:19.630> migration<00:06:20.110> again<00:06:20.380> so<00:06:20.590> the<00:06:20.680> transmitters

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:21.190 
fall migration again so the transmitters

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:22.890 
fall migration again so the transmitters
are<00:06:21.310> structured<00:06:21.760> such<00:06:21.940> that<00:06:22.000> we<00:06:22.270> get<00:06:22.450> more

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:22.900 
are structured such that we get more

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:24.690 
are structured such that we get more
locations<00:06:23.500> during<00:06:23.740> the<00:06:23.890> migratory<00:06:24.370> period

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:24.700 
locations during the migratory period

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:27.990 
locations during the migratory period
and<00:06:25.920> so<00:06:26.920> we're<00:06:27.010> going<00:06:27.100> to<00:06:27.190> get<00:06:27.310> lots<00:06:27.400> of<00:06:27.610> really

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:28.000 
and so we're going to get lots of really

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.820 
and so we're going to get lots of really
