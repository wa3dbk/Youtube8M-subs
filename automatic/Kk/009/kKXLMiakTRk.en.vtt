00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 very thick ok we are here in the channel 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.130
 of clash of clans from my business about 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.500
 guys I bring you a pretty attack 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.050
 I miss the truth I had never happened 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.880
 a thing like that but it is that the truth had 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.849
 than to bring it to the channel because it's super 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:17.160
 cool and good because it seemed very 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.020
 funny as you see begins to make a 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.000
 air attack then carries a few 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.250
 dragons a few balloons to go 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.570
 removing defenses from above and not 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.820
 bother the dragons 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.109
 but good note that around here 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.060
 well I should have released before 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.859
 the balloons because that's how he took off 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.410
 above all are santi to them that 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.260
 could be the ones that bothered him and 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.270
 everything could have done 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:41.550
 a good attack only with dragons not 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.890
 I know what I would be thinking at this moment 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.320
 eyebrow using balloons because here what 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.000
 it's better to catch and do all dragons and 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.399
 start attacking tombs or a defense 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.559
 and how are you two others left because 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.899
 it's a town hall level 8 you use a 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.969
 rage is worth it with that anger so good 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.340
 for those dragons is pretty good 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.469
 because you get rid of that immediately 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.809
 air defense but good here what 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.760
 important are not these balloons worth the 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.650
 balloons, yes, it is true that 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.360
 a lot let's say all the mortars 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.250
 all those archer towers that 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.020
 they can possibly bother you 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.060
 very much to the two heroes that as you see 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.700
 over here, well, the truth is released 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.340
 they start to deviate a bit but 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.680
 good use here because the king 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.510
 the skill as soon as possible for good 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.640
 to get rid of the buildings 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:28.410
 do not bother the queen 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.020
 archer but good watch the queen 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:32.880
 archer is already set to break the wall is worth 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.900
 around here there are some balloons everything goes to 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.310
 influence the attack practically not 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.280
 there is no defense that can make you 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.080
 much damage to the queen archer for 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.530
 knock down the town hall in any case 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:49.200
 good could be king if put there to 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.850
 touch the pellets or possibly the 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.180
 mortar but good the mortar the truth 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:57.120
 does not practically hurt one at all 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:59.130
 ok but we have here the king 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.660
 now notice that you are going to use the 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.850
 skill and the moment you use the 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:04.920
 skill then good at that time 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.690
 queen who will have split the wall by 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.580
 So, well, the king quickly 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:10.149
 it gets around here it gets ahead of 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.220
 the Queen 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:13.950
 to the builders hut and all for 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.720
 here therefore the queen has already 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.579
 egg lotion fix it you have it at 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.959
 egg already to knock down the town hall what 

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:21.909
 The only thing that could bother you would be the 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:25.110
 globules that is there are out there playing 

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:27.370
 the pellets and the mortar but look 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.349
 the mortars that is pulling a 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.180
 mortar vale pulls here one 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:32.890
 pavle here over the queen archer vale 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:36.630
 it takes away a little life nothing happens 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:38.580
 here the king is good, he is going to die 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:41.220
 and possibly good if I had 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:44.040
 lying down etc it would have been more 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.750
 easy but look grave right here and now 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.120
 the queen bows what the fuck she does 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.100
 begins to knock down the balloons 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.380
 tap here another one out there but 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:55.020
 look at that morterazo just what I just 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:57.540
 catching at the right time hits 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:03:00.030
 the queen bows and pam and the strip 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:03.360
 like four more boxes towards the 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:06.450
 right therefore it gets on the radio 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:08.700
 of the tesla on top, well, also 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.860
 about the barbarian king a little bit the 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.540
 Queen is even closer than good 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:14.880
 he is already practically shot 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.290
 everything there is within reach and 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:19.319
 Well, they kill the queen archer 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:22.680
 see how good it would be if it had broken 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:24.959
 would have destroyed that wall would not have 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:27.090
 been those balloons automatically 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:28.469
 would have knocked down the town hall 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:31.200
 and possibly well he would have 

00:03:28.469 --> 00:03:33.060
 made the second star but good of 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.829
 anyway, the attack was a bit 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:38.010
 I miss the truth it would have been better 

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:39.450
 have made a good attack with only 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:41.219
 dragons would have managed to do it at 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:43.709
 one hundred percent but good you're 

00:03:41.219 --> 00:03:45.450
 rather curious than a mortar ball 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:46.980
 have displaced both the queen archer 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:49.079
 to change the goal and so 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:51.659
 so much good he goes to kill the king 

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:54.090
 barbarian enemy and the tesla and so 

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:55.530
 so much good end up plugging in the 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.120
 queen if I had the ability yes 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.669
 that is true that well, something could 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.620
 have done but anyway you already 

00:03:59.669 --> 00:04:03.359
 I had deviated too much and I do not think 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.370
 could have done the second star 

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:07.560
 so, well, guys, I hope that I have 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:09.599
 liked this repetition the truth 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:11.250
 pretty curious we'll see you in the 

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:12.930
