00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:22.150
More than a decade after the modern MINI first
arrived, it has been reimagined with five

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:27.790
doors instead of three. Depending on your
point of view this will either be highly controversial,

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:32.990
or it will make perfect sense. Those worried
about outgrowing their beloved MINI Hatchback’s

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:36.660
have now been thrown a lifeline.
To accommodate two more doors the whole car

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.620
has been stretched by 16cms, meaning there’s
now space for two adults in the back, and

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:48.960
the boot has grown by 67-litres. But, the
MINI has always been about driving fun, so

00:00:48.960 --> 00:01:02.180
has that been compromised? Let’s find out.
No way, the fun factor is alive and well.

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.140
This MINI might be longer and slightly heavier
than its name suggests, but you wouldn’t

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.053
really know it from the driver’s seat. The
steering is incredibly sharp, immediately

00:01:09.053 --> 00:01:14.370
giving you the sense this car has a real sense
of fun. A short-throw gearbox makes for very

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:19.940
quick changes, and the car automatically matches
revs when you downshift, often with a few

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:29.219
pops from the exhaust for good measure. There’s
an optional auto, but it’s not as much fun,

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:38.420
unless you live in a congested city.
Turn into a corner and bodyroll is almost

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:44.799
none existent and you can really feel the
tyres gripping into the tarmac. Choose Sport

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:52.100
mode for ‘maximum go kart feel’ in this
Cooper S version and the suspension becomes

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:57.270
so firm you’d probably want to save it for
track days.

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.920
One and Cooper models fitted with smaller
wheels ride more comfortable, and while the

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:09.979
MINI is no Rolls-Royce, it can cruise comfortably
on the motorway.

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:26.730
Petrol engines start with a 1.2-litre with
101bhp, while a sportier 134bhp 1.5-litre

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.319
is fitted in the Cooper. This could be the
pick of the range, with 0-62mph taking just

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:39.920
over 8 seconds and impressive economy of 60mpg.
The Cooper S has 189bhp and feels hot hatch

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:49.250
quick, so its 48mpg is quite respectable,
if you can resist putting your foot down.

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:57.959
The One, Cooper and Cooper S are also available
with a diesel, ranging in power from 101 to

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:10.190
168bhp and economy from 69 to 80mpg.
The 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:16.830
latest MINI still has a very distinctive cabin,
with a unique view out of its small, upright

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:23.211
windscreen, and a dinner plate-sized pod above
the centre console. This is no longer a huge

00:03:23.211 --> 00:03:29.010
speedometer though, instead it houses the
infotainment system or radio, while the speedo

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:32.920
has moved to a more conventional spot above
the steering wheel.

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.780
Controls for the electric windows have also
moved to the doors, so they are no longer

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:51.000
operated by toggles buried in the centre console.
The rear doors might be quite small, but sit

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.640
in the back and you’ll find there’s much
more knee room than the 3-dr, meaning two

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:00.590
adults can at last be carried in comfort.
You won’t want to sit in the middle though,

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:06.500
the MINI hasn’t got any wider, and there’s
this transmission tunnel to deal with.

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:12.120
Step ‘round to the boot and the 5-dr starts
to make even more sense. There’s 67-litres

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:17.180
extra space, and it’s well thought out,
with a split-level boot floor allowing for

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:20.890
a deeper space, or for valuables to be kept
hidden.

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:26.670
The MINI might not be as dainty as it once
was, but this 5-dr version is a lot better

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:30.720
suited to growing families and is pretty good
value too, costing just £600 more than the

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:37.060
smaller 3-dr.
On top of that, its extra practicality hasn’t

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:39.790
come at the cost of driving fun; the MINI
behind me is sure to put a smile on your face.

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:44.830
So, while purists may sneer at its sheer size,
we think most customers will simply be happy

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:48.310
they can keep driving a MINI, despite needing
more space.
