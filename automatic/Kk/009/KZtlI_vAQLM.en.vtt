not much creativity on the woman but

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:47.580 
not much creativity on the woman but
it's<00:04:45.370> pretty<00:04:45.520> cool<00:04:45.730> it's<00:04:46.540> just<00:04:46.810> a<00:04:46.960> jet<00:04:47.380> pack

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:47.590 
it's pretty cool it's just a jet pack

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:48.840 
it's pretty cool it's just a jet pack
but<00:04:47.830> the<00:04:47.920> jet<00:04:48.070> pack<00:04:48.250> is<00:04:48.340> actually<00:04:48.580> a<00:04:48.640> little

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:48.850 
but the jet pack is actually a little

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:50.700 
but the jet pack is actually a little
bit<00:04:48.970> of<00:04:49.120> a<00:04:49.210> lighter<00:04:49.510> and<00:04:49.840> a<00:04:49.930> darker<00:04:50.050> orange

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:50.710

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:54.550 
shade a little bit not too much but it

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:57.210

on this guy so let's go Birds

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:00.340 
on this guy so let's go Birds

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:00.350 
articulation first off there's feet he

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:02.439 
articulation first off there's feet he
got<00:06:00.560> a<00:06:00.590> ball<00:06:00.830> joint<00:06:01.130> and<00:06:01.729> you<00:06:01.820> can<00:06:02.000> move<00:06:02.120> side

00:06:02.439 --> 00:06:02.449 
got a ball joint and you can move side

00:06:02.449 --> 00:06:04.210 
got a ball joint and you can move side
to<00:06:02.479> side<00:06:02.660> a<00:06:02.930> little<00:06:03.410> bit<00:06:03.530> can't<00:06:03.979> endure<00:06:04.130> him

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:04.220 
to side a little bit can't endure him

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:06.640 
to side a little bit can't endure him
360<00:06:04.820> can<00:06:05.479> bend<00:06:05.690> at<00:06:05.810> two<00:06:05.840> points<00:06:05.960> in<00:06:06.410> the<00:06:06.500> knee

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:06.650 
360 can bend at two points in the knee

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:09.430 
360 can bend at two points in the knee
because<00:06:06.860> of<00:06:07.070> the<00:06:07.160> axial<00:06:07.580> then<00:06:08.240> the<00:06:08.389> leg<00:06:09.169> he

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:09.440 
because of the axial then the leg he

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:11.500 
because of the axial then the leg he
moves<00:06:09.650> up<00:06:09.860> to<00:06:10.070> belt<00:06:10.220> there<00:06:10.460> then<00:06:10.760> back<00:06:11.030> if<00:06:11.360> you

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:11.510 
moves up to belt there then back if you

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:13.930 
moves up to belt there then back if you
lift<00:06:11.720> this<00:06:11.840> up<00:06:12.050> and<00:06:12.260> moves<00:06:12.410> back<00:06:12.470> further<00:06:13.010> can

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:13.940 
lift this up and moves back further can

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:15.969 
lift this up and moves back further can
see<00:06:14.150> but<00:06:14.419> not<00:06:14.570> too<00:06:14.870> much<00:06:15.020> articulation<00:06:15.349> there

00:06:15.969 --> 00:06:15.979 
see but not too much articulation there

00:06:15.979 --> 00:06:20.230 
see but not too much articulation there
then<00:06:16.639> moving<00:06:16.849> it<00:06:17.120> out<00:06:17.380> then<00:06:18.380> uh<00:06:18.910> you<00:06:19.910> can<00:06:19.940> move

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:20.240 
then moving it out then uh you can move

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:21.939 
then moving it out then uh you can move
this<00:06:20.419> up<00:06:20.690> and<00:06:20.840> down<00:06:20.990> the<00:06:21.229> move<00:06:21.380> this<00:06:21.650> there's

00:06:21.939 --> 00:06:21.949 
this up and down the move this there's

00:06:21.949 --> 00:06:23.379 
this up and down the move this there's
only<00:06:22.009> two<00:06:22.310> points<00:06:22.610> particulate<00:06:23.000> in<00:06:23.150> the<00:06:23.210> arm

00:06:23.379 --> 00:06:23.389 
only two points particulate in the arm

00:06:23.389 --> 00:06:25.659 
only two points particulate in the arm
which<00:06:23.599> is<00:06:23.630> a<00:06:23.780> little<00:06:24.110> lame<00:06:24.919> but<00:06:25.190> I<00:06:25.310> don't<00:06:25.490> care

00:06:25.659 --> 00:06:25.669 
which is a little lame but I don't care

00:06:25.669 --> 00:06:28.120 
which is a little lame but I don't care
the<00:06:26.330> head<00:06:26.510> articulation<00:06:27.229> you<00:06:27.349> can<00:06:27.530> move<00:06:27.710> it<00:06:27.919> up

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:28.130 
the head articulation you can move it up

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:33.070 
the head articulation you can move it up
and<00:06:28.520> down<00:06:29.080> side<00:06:30.080> to<00:06:30.110> side<00:06:30.729> and<00:06:31.729> swivel<00:06:32.300> so

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:33.080 
and down side to side and swivel so

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:33.969 
and down side to side and swivel so
pretty<00:06:33.349> standard<00:06:33.740> stuff

00:06:33.969 --> 00:06:33.979 
pretty standard stuff

00:06:33.979 --> 00:06:35.560 
pretty standard stuff
I<00:06:34.159> don't<00:06:34.340> really<00:06:34.520> count<00:06:34.699> that<00:06:34.940> propellers

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:35.570 
I don't really count that propellers

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:37.240 
I don't really count that propellers
articulation<00:06:36.349> about<00:06:36.530> I<00:06:36.560> guess<00:06:36.770> some<00:06:36.979> people

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:37.250 
articulation about I guess some people

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:39.850 
articulation about I guess some people
can<00:06:37.460> so<00:06:38.270> that's<00:06:38.419> pretty<00:06:38.599> much<00:06:38.690> a<00:06:38.780> closer<00:06:39.470> look

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:39.860 
can so that's pretty much a closer look

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:43.629 
can so that's pretty much a closer look
at<00:06:40.010> Earth<00:06:40.220> a<00:06:40.610> very<00:06:41.479> awesome<00:06:41.840> figure<00:06:42.470> so<00:06:42.919> what

00:06:43.629 --> 00:06:43.639 
at Earth a very awesome figure so what

00:06:43.639 --> 00:06:44.950 
at Earth a very awesome figure so what
you're<00:06:43.760> trying<00:06:44.060> to<00:06:44.150> figure<00:06:44.300> out<00:06:44.419> is<00:06:44.630> how<00:06:44.750> big

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:44.960 
you're trying to figure out is how big

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:46.540 
you're trying to figure out is how big
get<00:06:45.080> this<00:06:45.229> guy<00:06:45.380> look<00:06:45.650> at<00:06:45.770> one<00:06:45.889> side<00:06:46.039> two-person

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:46.550 
get this guy look at one side two-person

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:47.740 
get this guy look at one side two-person
times<00:06:46.760> who<00:06:46.909> can<00:06:47.120> see<00:06:47.270> I've<00:06:47.360> got<00:06:47.510> rudder

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:47.750 
times who can see I've got rudder

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:49.450 
times who can see I've got rudder
compared<00:06:48.199> to<00:06:48.320> all<00:06:48.470> the<00:06:48.650> great<00:06:48.770> figures<00:06:49.190> here

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:49.460 
compared to all the great figures here

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:51.580 
compared to all the great figures here
even<00:06:49.729> in<00:06:49.820> McDonald's<00:06:50.240> toy<00:06:50.389> you<00:06:51.020> can<00:06:51.050> see<00:06:51.320> he<00:06:51.560> is

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:51.590 
even in McDonald's toy you can see he is

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:53.909 
even in McDonald's toy you can see he is
so<00:06:52.190> much<00:06:52.430> taller<00:06:52.729> than<00:06:52.849> a<00:06:53.000> regular<00:06:53.120> hero

00:06:53.909 --> 00:06:53.919 
so much taller than a regular hero

00:06:53.919 --> 00:06:56.730 
so much taller than a regular hero
yeah<00:06:54.919> but<00:06:55.159> it<00:06:55.460> doesn't<00:06:55.789> mean<00:06:56.090> you<00:06:56.180> can<00:06:56.300> get<00:06:56.419> I

00:06:56.730 --> 00:06:56.740 
yeah but it doesn't mean you can get I

00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:59.170 
yeah but it doesn't mean you can get I
don't<00:06:57.740> know<00:06:57.949> what<00:06:58.099> that<00:06:58.220> comes<00:06:58.400> saying<00:06:58.639> but

00:06:59.170 --> 00:06:59.180 
don't know what that comes saying but

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:00.730 
don't know what that comes saying but
he's<00:06:59.419> a<00:06:59.449> lot<00:06:59.750> taller<00:06:59.990> than<00:07:00.110> my<00:07:00.349> surgeon

00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:00.740 
he's a lot taller than my surgeon

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:03.010 
he's a lot taller than my surgeon
duncanville<00:07:00.889> Caen<00:07:01.490> he<00:07:02.210> does<00:07:02.449> actually

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:03.020 
duncanville Caen he does actually

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:04.930 
duncanville Caen he does actually
doesn't<00:07:03.349> really<00:07:03.500> remind<00:07:03.830> me<00:07:04.039> of<00:07:04.130> Salman<00:07:04.610> here

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:04.940 
doesn't really remind me of Salman here

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:06.490 
doesn't really remind me of Salman here
some<00:07:05.330> reason<00:07:05.630> I<00:07:05.780> guess<00:07:06.050> it's<00:07:06.169> just<00:07:06.289> cuz<00:07:06.409> the

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:06.500 
some reason I guess it's just cuz the

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:08.589 
some reason I guess it's just cuz the
color<00:07:06.710> scheme<00:07:06.979> maybe<00:07:07.220> you<00:07:07.970> can<00:07:08.150> see<00:07:08.330> he's<00:07:08.570> a

00:07:08.589 --> 00:07:08.599 
color scheme maybe you can see he's a

00:07:08.599 --> 00:07:10.480 
color scheme maybe you can see he's a
lot<00:07:08.840> taller<00:07:09.050> than<00:07:09.229> all<00:07:09.470> these<00:07:09.680> guys<00:07:09.740> here<00:07:10.250> so

lot taller than all these guys here so
you<00:07:10.550> can<00:07:10.699> see<00:07:10.880> how<00:07:11.060> big<00:07:11.419> rotor<00:07:11.780> is<00:07:12.020> he's<00:07:12.320> about

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:12.440 
you can see how big rotor is he's about

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:14.680 
you can see how big rotor is he's about
the<00:07:12.650> biggest<00:07:12.830> tumor<00:07:13.340> he's<00:07:13.940> better<00:07:14.210> than<00:07:14.360> to<00:07:14.510> my

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:14.690
