00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:09.900
 using knauf mounting glue 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:12.059
 Perlfix C 611 is used when 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:16.260
 frameless drywall device 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:17.760
 facing channel c 611 for wall decoration in 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.590
 rooms with dry and normal 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.050
 humidity conditions 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.060
 installation of cladding should be done in 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.420
 finishing period before the device 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.269
 clean floors when all wet processes 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:31.740

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.510
 systems in dry and normal conditions 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.360
 humidity conditions at a temperature of 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.940
 no room below plus ten degrees with 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.420
 wall to remove dust and

 mud 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.160
 wall surfaces must be dry 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.020
 smooth and non-wicking walls 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.910
 for example concrete must be 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.160
 pretreated with primer 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:57.090

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:59.940
 clutch is hygroscopic and absorbent 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.859
 surface moisture for example brick gas 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.220
 foam concrete treated with primer 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:07.380
 knauf thunder hermit to reduce 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.619
 moisture absorption from the mortar mixture 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.900

 bag to fall asleep in a clean cold container 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:18.420
 water and mix with a construction mixer 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:21.060
 until homogeneous, not containing 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:24.049
 lumps of mass work duration with 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.790
 mortar for at least 30 minutes 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:27.479
 knauf mounting glue mortar

 on the spot in single rows in the center 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:37.220
 along the sheet with an interval of 35 centimeters 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.220
 and around the perimeter with a minimum interval 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:43.740
 after applying the glue sheet rises 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.470
 mounted on a lining 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:49.080
 or mounting fixture is pressed 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.420
 in the wall and light strokes 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.540
 level with a plumb or 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.540
 level 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:59.100
 each subsequent sheet fits tightly 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.290
 with previous installation 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.690
 drywall sheets can not be left 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:06.270
 voids in the seams otherwise after puttying 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:08.270
 at the interface can be formed 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:11.280
 crack adjust position 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:13.920
 facing sheet can be for 10 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.010
 minutes after applying the adhesive 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.840

 putty knauf uniflot 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:24.650
 or channel fugen with paper reinforcement 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:27.540
 taping tape seams facing with 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:29.640
 611 is exactly the same as 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.250
 putty partitions and facings on 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.760
 dry cast metal frame 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.820
 mixture 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.350
 fill the tank with clean cold water 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:40.020
 evenly spreading over the surface to 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:42.120
 the formation of a dry islet will endure three 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:44.610
 minute and mix with a spatula until 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.860
 homogeneous consistency then apply 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.810
 the first layer of putty on the butt sheets 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.600
 lay reinforcement tape on the layer 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.730
 putty and press with trowel preventing 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:56.519
 while removing the solution from under the tape 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.830
 and the formation of folds and bubbles on it 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:01.320
 after curing and drying first 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:04.230
 apply a second leveling coat 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:06.980
 putty putty work out over 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.980
