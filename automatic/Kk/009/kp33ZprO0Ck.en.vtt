 How the Microwave Oven Works - Sleek Engineer Man # 4 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
 The microwave oven is a remarkable achievement of engineering achievements 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
 The rapid heating of the microwave made it a popular product 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
 And also because of its energy saving 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.000
 This is * LED Drainer 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
 If you have a conception of the LED Drainer it is normal to find it in 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
 Radio like it 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
 Inevitably transistors and small electronic segments modulate 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
 Electric valves are inappropriate but premature 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.000
 To donate them to the museum 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
 Electronic chips can not be replaced with valves to produce power 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.000
 For example: in heating food 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
 The microwave contains three main components 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
 LED dumper nicknamed * Magentron 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
 It generates the energy that heats the food 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
 A waveguide, a cache in the wall to direct that energy to the food 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
 Room to hold food and to hold (hold) microwave rays 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
 In principle the microwave oven heating is no different 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
 For any kind of other heat transfer 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
 At the molecular level the heat is transformed into energy 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
 As a result of increasing the movement of atoms in the material 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.000
 We do not have enough volumes 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
 We note this increase in traffic 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.000
 High temperature 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
 In the traditional oven or burner we cut food 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.000
 Place the pan on the fire 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
 Or in an oven where the walls radiate heat 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
 Which cooks the outside of the food 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
 Internal cooking occurs when the heat travels from a surface 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
 Food into it 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
 In contrast the energy of the magnetrons is penetrating 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
 Into the food which means that the entire mass of food 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.000
 You cook at the same time 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.000
 How does this happen? 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
 Well, our food is full of water 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
 Who has a positive charge on one side 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.000
 And negative at the other end 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
 To give these particles more energy 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
 We are exposed to electromagnetic waves emitted by the LED 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
 By definition: waves have two electric and magnetic fields 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.000
 Which are rapidly changing direction 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
 In this furnace the direction of the fields changes 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
 2.45 billion times per second 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
 The water will try to align (align) with the irradiated electric field 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
 Field changes make the water molecule swinging (vibrating 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
 Fast and fast molecular friction 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
 This makes heat because the motion is torn 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
 Hydrogen bonds between adjacent water molecules 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
 Now, you can get an idea of ​​the wavelength of energy 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
 Emitted from the mugentron using cheese 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
 Now, you can see these sections where cheese is 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
 Has completely melted, and other sections have not fully heated 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
 The walls of the metal oven reflect the waves only 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000
 Suitable length inside oven 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
 These continuous waves cause hot and cold spots inside the oven 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
 It is difficult to predict the three-dimensional pattern of the waves 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
 But in principle it can be seen 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000
 Surf in one dimension 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
 The upper and lower peaks of the wave represent 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000
 Great wave energy 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
 While the nodes here correspond to the \ "cold \" areas inside the microwave room 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
 If you measure the distance between melting cheese spots 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
 The distance will be about 2.5 inches 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.000
 Which will be half the wavelength 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
 (Distance between nodes) 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
 Will be close to the actual wavelength of the microwave radiation used 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.000
 Using wavelength I can deduce the frequency of microwave radiation 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
 Frequency is related to wavelength and speed of light 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
 We got an answer with a 4_5% error 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
 That's not bad as an initial measure 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
 Now, the real geometry is in the microwave 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
 Lies in the industry of * magnetos * which 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
 Generates radio waves with high capacity 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
 It is truly an amazing device 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.000
 LED drapes will be inside here 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.000
 These are cooling fins 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000
 Thin metal parts that heat dissipate when it works * Magnetrons 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
 The main parts are these magnets 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
 This is a drain valve 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
 I have another one so you can see what's inside 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
 We apply great effort across 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
 Electrical wire in the middle and the outer copper circle 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
 Which emits electrons away from the wire in the middle 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
 Which flows towards the circular copper section 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
 The wire is made of tungsten and thorium 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
 Tungsten because it can resist high temperatures 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
 Thorium is a good source of electrons 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000
 Magnets reverse the path of these electrons 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.000
 Returning it to the center wire in the middle 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
 We adjust the magnetic force so that 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000
 The electrons spin in the orbits of a scanner behind the holes of these cavities 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
 Such as blowing over a half filled pop bottle to make it whistle 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.000
 This creates a vibrating wave - the microwave radiation that warms the food 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
 It is really surprising that these gaps can be made 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
 High precision, low cost, and incredibly high reliability 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
 I called Bill Hammack - The Engineer Man 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
 This video is based on a chapter in a book 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
 Eight Amazing Engineering Stories 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
 The chapter contains more information on this topic
