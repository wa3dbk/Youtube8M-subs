00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:14.219
 7 cedars are not friends with you smaller player 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:16.289
 and today we'll talk about n 551 sheridan 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:19.240
 american light tanker 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.970
 who put on level 4 branches 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.470
 development arbat vfr small 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:26.230
 history reference 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:28.599
 Sheridan is unique and while easy 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:31.359
 the tank which was flattened set 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:33.880
 newest solutions such as aluminum 

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:35.380
 armor and launcher instead of guns 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.690
 able to fire 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:41.530
 guided missiles she layla other 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:43.690
 the shells of the late 1970s were 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:46.330
 about 1700 tanks produced 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:49.560
 are in the us army to this day in 

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:52.560
 as airborne vehicles 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:55.180
 now we will pass to characteristics 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:57.700
 survival 730 hp 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:02.070
 this is about an average of 4 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:06.759
 level for comparison about b t 4 levels t-64 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:09.579
 879 that is, 49 x p more but armor 

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:11.979
 not at all about 100 millimeters thick 

00:01:09.579 --> 00:01:14.469
 circle this armor can sometimes save you 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:17.189
 only from automatic guns and no more 

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:21.659
 after all, it's a light tank after all 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:25.119
 the damage from this tank is much better 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:28.259
 346 damage that's really a lot too 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:32.229
 for comparison, experiments on the level above m 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:33.880
 63200 15 damage I've been thinking here you can 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:36.609
 punch them then cheated or 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.149
 rate of fire but no also all on 

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:40.509
 height 

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:43.960
 penetration of about the same as the meters 63a 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:45.369
 damage per minute higher by 300 units almost 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.820
 six shots per minute and then 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:51.740
 recharge in about 10 seconds 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:54.380
 speed and here our little one fails 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:57.080
 almost 70 kilometers per hour it's pretty 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.370
 high numbers here with power density y 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.950
 he is not very good 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:03.260
 20 horsepower per ton is not at all 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.600
 cool half of our maximum we 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:07.929
 we type in about 15 seconds what 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:11.660
 comparable to bt 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:14.390
 review disguise disguise we have very 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:16.670
 good in this game as i noticed 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:19.250
 on the characteristics of all light machines 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:23.030
 this indicator is raised to the example of 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:26.030
 Abrams this factor is 0.07 and our 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:28.310
 almost three tenths sheridan don't know much 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.950
 will affect visibility or not but 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:33.100
 I think that this is an advantage however 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:38.360
 this tank was not given a great overview 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:41.480
 more or less average level of accuracy and 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:43.790
 dropping tools with and broken off 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.640
 each tank must be substantial 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:49.580
 minuses and ears of these minuses for two 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.990
 these are indicators of time information and accuracy 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.600
 bone 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:56.470
 this is so close to artillery can 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.470
 slightly more accurate 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:02.680
 what can generally say m 551 sheridan 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.340
 the tank itself is quite unique and 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.530
 is interesting 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:08.080
 at least that his arsenal is 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:10.180
 guided missiles with 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:12.520
 good speed this tank will be 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.860
 dangerous enemy on the battlefield which 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:15.480
 worth being afraid especially if he drove up 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:18.040
 from the rear 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.170
 however weak maneuverability and inertia 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.720
 tools from the balance wider for as it should 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:24.430
 friends many cars he can not and 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.410
 ranged combat is not his strong point 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:29.170
 so you have to get close to the enemy 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.790
 make a shot and immediately run away in order 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:33.160
 don't get up in return 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.989
 And on this I have all put huskies 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.730
