00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.660 
maybe it's going to be a 10 player
multiplayer<00:01:36.570> or<00:01:37.110> even<00:01:37.380> more<00:01:37.560> maybe<00:01:37.799> 12<00:01:38.220> or<00:01:38.430> 14

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
multiplayer or even more maybe 12 or 14

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.090 
multiplayer or even more maybe 12 or 14
but<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.600> other<00:01:39.720> side<00:01:39.990> to<00:01:40.200> this<00:01:40.320> argument<00:01:40.590> is

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
but the other side to this argument is

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.480 
but the other side to this argument is
that<00:01:41.659> 4j<00:01:42.689> could<00:01:43.049> have<00:01:43.290> a<00:01:43.500> special<00:01:44.040> kind<00:01:44.340> of

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
that 4j could have a special kind of

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.609 
that 4j could have a special kind of
developing<00:01:45.090> tool<00:01:45.420> where<00:01:46.079> you<00:01:46.290> know<00:01:46.409> you're

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
developing tool where you know you're

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.440 
developing tool where you know you're
going<00:01:46.770> to<00:01:46.920> like<00:01:47.070> dev<00:01:47.340> mode<00:01:47.579> and<00:01:47.939> then<00:01:48.090> you<00:01:48.210> can

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
going to like dev mode and then you can

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.240 
going to like dev mode and then you can
you<00:01:48.659> know<00:01:48.750> like<00:01:48.960> move<00:01:49.200> around<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:49.950> game

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
you know like move around the game

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.460 
you know like move around the game
without<00:01:51.149> actually<00:01:51.600> being<00:01:51.840> a<00:01:51.930> player<00:01:52.140> if

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
without actually being a player if

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.350 
without actually being a player if
you're<00:01:52.619> not<00:01:52.740> I<00:01:52.770> mean<00:01:53.040> like<00:01:53.399> other<00:01:53.820> know<00:01:54.090> how<00:01:54.299> to

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
you're not I mean like other know how to

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.240 
you're not I mean like other know how to
explain<00:01:54.780> it<00:01:54.840> you<00:01:55.170> know<00:01:55.470> they<00:01:55.590> could<00:01:55.770> just<00:01:56.100> have

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
explain it you know they could just have

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.800 
explain it you know they could just have
a<00:01:56.280> camera<00:01:56.670> mode<00:01:56.850> because<00:01:57.270> you<00:01:57.420> know<00:01:57.540> as

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
a camera mode because you know as

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.600 
a camera mode because you know as
developers<00:01:58.469> I<00:01:58.680> would<00:01:58.979> surely<00:01:59.100> have<00:01:59.250> all<00:01:59.460> the

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
developers I would surely have all the

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.580 
developers I would surely have all the
tools<00:01:59.850> they<00:02:00.030> need<00:02:00.240> to<00:02:00.509> build<00:02:00.930> stuff<00:02:01.229> so

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
tools they need to build stuff so

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:02.929 
tools they need to build stuff so
perhaps<00:02:01.890> they're<00:02:02.040> in<00:02:02.159> this<00:02:02.280> like<00:02:02.460> this<00:02:02.640> dev

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
perhaps they're in this like this dev

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.940 
perhaps they're in this like this dev
mode<00:02:03.180> it's<00:02:03.450> like<00:02:03.600> a<00:02:03.630> ghost<00:02:03.930> mode<00:02:04.380> kind<00:02:04.799> of

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
mode it's like a ghost mode kind of

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.200 
mode it's like a ghost mode kind of
thing<00:02:05.189> I'm<00:02:05.399> really<00:02:05.549> not<00:02:05.729> explaining<00:02:06.180> this

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
thing I'm really not explaining this

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.059 
thing I'm really not explaining this
very<00:02:06.360> well<00:02:06.540> but<00:02:07.140> yeah<00:02:07.290> it's<00:02:07.469> basically<00:02:07.770> it

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
very well but yeah it's basically it

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:08.760 
very well but yeah it's basically it
won't<00:02:08.310> count

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:08.770 
won't count

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:10.950 
won't count
another<00:02:09.070> player<00:02:09.430> in<00:02:09.700> the<00:02:09.760> game<00:02:10.090> so<00:02:10.750> maybe

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:10.960 
another player in the game so maybe

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:13.260 
another player in the game so maybe
that's<00:02:11.230> how<00:02:11.320> they<00:02:11.470> did<00:02:11.830> it<00:02:11.950> or<00:02:12.130> another<00:02:13.030> way

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
that's how they did it or another way

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:14.940 
that's how they did it or another way
how<00:02:13.480> they<00:02:13.630> did<00:02:13.810> it<00:02:13.930> is<00:02:14.020> they<00:02:14.170> just<00:02:14.320> edited<00:02:14.800> in

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
how they did it is they just edited in

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.430 
how they did it is they just edited in
the<00:02:15.460> skin<00:02:15.760> like<00:02:16.060> they<00:02:16.180> just<00:02:16.390> copy<00:02:16.840> and<00:02:17.020> pasted

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
the skin like they just copy and pasted

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.290 
the skin like they just copy and pasted
the<00:02:17.710> skin<00:02:18.010> into<00:02:18.490> the<00:02:18.520> screenshot<00:02:19.060> and<00:02:19.180> it

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
the skin into the screenshot and it

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:20.850 
the skin into the screenshot and it
looks<00:02:19.570> like<00:02:19.630> he's<00:02:19.870> actually<00:02:20.020> there<00:02:20.410> that's

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
looks like he's actually there that's

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.200 
looks like he's actually there that's
another<00:02:21.100> way<00:02:21.340> that<00:02:21.370> they<00:02:21.640> might<00:02:21.790> have<00:02:21.910> done<00:02:22.060> it

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:22.210 
another way that they might have done it

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:24.030 
another way that they might have done it
but<00:02:22.420> yeah<00:02:22.570> well<00:02:23.080> done<00:02:23.230> Jacob<00:02:23.560> Perry<00:02:23.770> that<00:02:23.950> was

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
but yeah well done Jacob Perry that was

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.970 
but yeah well done Jacob Perry that was
very<00:02:24.220> smart<00:02:25.110> observation<00:02:26.110> that<00:02:26.230> you<00:02:26.350> did<00:02:26.620> so

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
very smart observation that you did so

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.130 
very smart observation that you did so
yeah<00:02:27.100> they<00:02:27.280> could<00:02:27.550> be<00:02:27.790> nine<00:02:28.450> players<00:02:28.750> on<00:02:28.960> this

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
yeah they could be nine players on this

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:30.870 
yeah they could be nine players on this
screenshot<00:02:29.500> and<00:02:29.950> also<00:02:30.250> going<00:02:30.490> back<00:02:30.640> to<00:02:30.760> the

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
screenshot and also going back to the

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.240 
screenshot and also going back to the
Spider<00:02:31.150> Man<00:02:31.390> one<00:02:31.600> I<00:02:31.750> was<00:02:31.930> talking<00:02:32.410> about<00:02:32.590> how

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
Spider Man one I was talking about how

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:34.830 
Spider Man one I was talking about how
there<00:02:33.460> was<00:02:33.580> more<00:02:33.850> than<00:02:34.000> eight<00:02:34.210> players<00:02:34.510> on<00:02:34.720> the

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
there was more than eight players on the

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.380 
there was more than eight players on the
screen<00:02:35.170> it<00:02:35.530> was<00:02:35.740> like<00:02:35.920> 10<00:02:36.340> I<00:02:36.550> think<00:02:36.580> and<00:02:37.120> that

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
screen it was like 10 I think and that

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.560 
screen it was like 10 I think and that
was<00:02:37.540> made<00:02:37.780> by<00:02:37.960> hat<00:02:38.200> films<00:02:38.470> so<00:02:39.280> it<00:02:39.760> means<00:02:40.390> that

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:40.570 
was made by hat films so it means that

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:43.140 
was made by hat films so it means that
hat<00:02:41.140> films<00:02:41.380> had<00:02:41.710> early<00:02:42.070> access<00:02:42.550> like<00:02:42.820> a<00:02:42.850> beta

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
hat films had early access like a beta

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.360 
hat films had early access like a beta
code<00:02:43.480> to<00:02:43.960> the<00:02:44.140> next-gen<00:02:44.590> versions<00:02:45.190> of

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
code to the next-gen versions of

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.060 
code to the next-gen versions of
Minecraft<00:02:45.580> or<00:02:46.270> they<00:02:46.780> just<00:02:46.810> used<00:02:47.380> some<00:02:47.560> editing

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.070 
Minecraft or they just used some editing

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:50.790 
Minecraft or they just used some editing
skills<00:02:48.580> to<00:02:49.180> put<00:02:49.420> the<00:02:49.780> other<00:02:50.080> players<00:02:50.410> on<00:02:50.650> the

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:50.800 
skills to put the other players on the

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.470 
skills to put the other players on the
screen<00:02:51.130> when<00:02:51.340> they<00:02:51.460> weren't<00:02:51.610> really<00:02:51.880> there<00:02:52.180> so

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
screen when they weren't really there so

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.060 
screen when they weren't really there so
you<00:02:52.840> know<00:02:52.960> there's<00:02:53.170> two<00:02:53.320> ways<00:02:53.530> to<00:02:53.560> interpret

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.070 
you know there's two ways to interpret

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:56.580 
you know there's two ways to interpret
this<00:02:54.550> as<00:02:54.790> I<00:02:54.910> just<00:02:55.120> said<00:02:55.330> it's<00:02:55.660> real<00:02:55.900> or<00:02:56.440> it's

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
this as I just said it's real or it's

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.320 
this as I just said it's real or it's
not<00:02:56.710> real<00:02:56.950> but<00:02:57.250> you<00:02:57.310> know<00:02:57.400> here's<00:02:57.670> to<00:02:57.820> hoping<00:02:58.180> I

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:58.330 
not real but you know here's to hoping I

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:00.330 
not real but you know here's to hoping I
really<00:02:58.720> hope<00:02:58.900> that<00:02:58.930> there<00:02:59.470> is<00:02:59.620> more<00:03:00.190> than

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
really hope that there is more than

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.280 
really hope that there is more than
eight<00:03:00.610> players<00:03:00.970> on<00:03:01.240> this<00:03:01.390> screen<00:03:01.720> and<00:03:01.900> that

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
eight players on this screen and that

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.080 
eight players on this screen and that
multiplayer<00:03:02.950> is<00:03:03.160> going<00:03:03.430> to<00:03:03.520> be<00:03:03.580> bigger<00:03:03.790> than

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
multiplayer is going to be bigger than

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:05.970 
multiplayer is going to be bigger than
eight<00:03:04.480> players<00:03:04.840> because<00:03:05.260> you<00:03:05.380> know<00:03:05.500> there's<00:03:05.890> a

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
eight players because you know there's a

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:07.500 
eight players because you know there's a
