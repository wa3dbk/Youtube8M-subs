00:00:01.690 --> 00:00:05.569
 Hello everyone in this video will tell about 

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:07.399
 fit 

00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:08.750
 with which you can manually 

00:00:07.399 --> 00:00:11.120
 pull the knife down 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:15.259
 this idea is not my idea borrowed on 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:17.720
 one english channel well and 

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:19.990
 accordingly took to use and 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:23.000
 she shows herself very well 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:24.679
 because I was often asked 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.929
 what is this thing I decided to take off 

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:28.820
 a separate video about her means 

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:32.240
 the design is very simple and very well 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:47.350
 principle of operation everyone probably saw yes that 

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:47.350
 there is here is here such here that 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:01:00.410
 downhill is very high quality 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:03.140
 eat with your hands to make of this to adapt 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:05.000
 it will be very very no do but 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.369
 it looks it will not be very beautiful here 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.850
 such a thing does later very very 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:09.850
 beautiful 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:16.250
 show what it means made of 

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:18.369
 plain centimeter plywood out 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:21.640
 several pieces the longest piece 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:24.799
 here it is yes well, probably centimeters 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:30.409
 60 centimeters wide in my opinion I took 

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:30.770
 12 centimeters that is this base to 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:33.229
 her 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.509
 for rigidity attached 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:38.149
 glued another one of the same width on 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:40.100
 slightly shorter than exactly 12 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:42.979
 centimeters to 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:46.310
 and one of them across exactly the same 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:48.280
 glued in one layer and it turns out 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:51.009
 Here we have such a big letter m 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:55.939
 further from several scraps can 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:02:00.170
 you can stick one 2 you can 345 how many 

00:01:55.939 --> 00:02:02.240
 Please, these things are needed to 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.889
 here we will be mounted as if 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:07.249
 ring on which will ride 

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:08.830
 guides can do several 

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:13.460
 because 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:18.980
 more precisely in order to regulate 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:22.370
 slope that is the closer we are here here 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:24.410
 use this here so let's say this 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:28.370
 this ring the closer it will stand 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:30.170
 that's how the knife the higher the angle is yes then 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.300
 there is understand and accordingly than 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:35.150
 further we will use as it were under 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:39.140
 this position will be the lower angle here but 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:43.160
 In principle, I decided not to do a lot of them. 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:45.140
 There are such things because to regulate 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:48.050
 tilt angle can be using this 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.220
 here is such a screw ring just 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:52.370
 twisting it 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:56.150
 and twisting it means here I attached 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:57.650
 one more piece of plywood because me 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.540
 not enough a little bit but I did not 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:04.280
 attach them a lot i just increased 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:06.920
 one in height and twisting harder 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.660
 thereby increasing the angle or if i 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.150
 need a little corner i will take this off 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:16.180
 top thing yes and twirl deeper 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:20.630
 screw ring means well respectively 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:23.360
 what else here means here as if well 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:25.250
 this is the distance to this 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.110
 this is the distance chosen 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:30.920
 arbitrarily the width of the knife here in my 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:34.640
 42 centimeter is no longer needed 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:37.370
 one line I drilled holes and twisted 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:40.910
 ordinary bolts up ie without nuts just 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:44.300
 in the tension so to speak they are needed for 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:47.930
 order here so to speak 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:50.510
 knife rigid fixation game no we just 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:52.910
 how would we rest on here too and he 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:55.400
 here we do not rotate that is here as 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:58.010
 would be a butt and here tip she 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:01.040
 respectively on the other side for 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:03.080
 another descent that's all 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:06.820
 construction stupidly fastened with a clamp there 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:08.590
 to the table to the workbench and you follow 

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:12.079
 drill through 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:14.780
 work very much 

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:18.970
 worth pennies plywood can be found everywhere 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:21.680
 screw ring in general I do not speak here 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:24.410
 the problem is to find a guide 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:27.229
 here need some tube is not desirable 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:28.610
 I tried a big steel pipe and 

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:31.400
 she is heavy enough 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:33.620
 you're tired so I found this one from 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:36.590
 Aluminum tube probably centimeter 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:39.710
 in diameter means normal yokes 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:41.539
 here I attached this sight 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:43.849
 healthy on saw in my 40 he 

00:04:41.539 --> 00:04:45.710
 centimeters in one of the biggest 

00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:47.930
 what I found here is the more 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:50.389
 the surface is abrasive the faster we have 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:52.460
 will go work but about one 

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:54.889
 descent well of course it all depends on the knife here 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:56.840
 that knife which I made last on 

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:59.150
 one descent goes somewhere forty minutes 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:01.070
 over there on the saw was smaller here on 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:04.430
 the film will be great i think half an hour 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:08.650
 I manage well, in principle, in principle 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:08.650
 all that is here is such a thing 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:20.380
 a little oil to avoid squeaks 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:30.470
 thank you all bye 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:35.270
 like this, you can fix it with 

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:41.780
 rescued when she is able to here the knife instructions 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:42.889
 and fixed here is one important detail 

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:45.380
 I forgot to say 

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:48.340
 it means one of these bolts here 

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:52.070
 need to do long because it will 

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:54.590
 limit our file and do as 

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:57.020
 here it will be here 

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:59.870
 descent how to stop it is necessary 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:01.639
 do because the descent that is the boundaries 

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:04.639
 between the raw part and the descent 

00:06:01.639 --> 00:06:06.849
 Then it will be clear, that is, one by one 

00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:06.849
 the lines 

00:06:08.279 --> 00:06:18.809
 here they are on the same line and so we 

00:06:13.419 --> 00:06:18.809
 we will work like this
