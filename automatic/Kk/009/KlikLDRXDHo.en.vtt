00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
coming up for two sky I think old man a

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:07.609 
coming up for two sky I think old man a
couple<00:01:06.810> more<00:01:06.900> scourge<00:01:07.170> coming<00:01:07.439> up<00:01:07.530> and

killing<00:01:07.890> a<00:01:08.040> number<00:01:08.400> of<00:01:08.520> clowns<00:01:08.760> mutalisks<00:01:09.150> I

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
killing a number of clowns mutalisks I

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.270 
killing a number of clowns mutalisks I
think<00:01:09.930> Lake<00:01:10.110> hab<00:01:10.290> has<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:10.680> upper<00:01:10.920> hand<00:01:10.950> though

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
think Lake hab has the upper hand though

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.429 
think Lake hab has the upper hand though
now<00:01:11.490> I<00:01:12.090> think<00:01:12.689> there<00:01:12.810> were<00:01:12.869> also<00:01:13.020> some<00:01:13.290> more

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
now I think there were also some more

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.219 
now I think there were also some more
dragoons<00:01:13.770> out<00:01:13.950> for<00:01:14.840> backhoe<00:01:15.840> I<00:01:15.960> don't<00:01:16.140> know

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
dragoons out for backhoe I don't know

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.649 
dragoons out for backhoe I don't know
why<00:01:16.409> there<00:01:16.619> were<00:01:16.650> but<00:01:17.400> I<00:01:17.430> guess<00:01:17.640> it's<00:01:18.299> preps

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
why there were but I guess it's preps

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.530 
why there were but I guess it's preps
just<00:01:19.200> better<00:01:19.500> mackerel<00:01:20.040> from<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:21.060> Air<00:01:21.299> Force

there<00:01:23.640> but<00:01:24.509> definitely<00:01:24.630> in<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:24.990> air<00:01:25.049> battle<00:01:25.560> I

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
there but definitely in the air battle I

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.679

actually recovering and I think they're

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.050 
actually recovering and I think they're
well<00:03:06.040> I'd<00:03:06.160> say<00:03:06.340> they're<00:03:06.489> slightly<00:03:06.730> in<00:03:06.970> the

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060

well I'd say they're slightly in the
lead<00:03:07.269> right<00:03:07.390> now<00:03:07.450> actually<00:03:07.829> they're

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:08.829 
lead right now actually they're

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:10.380 
lead right now actually they're
definitely<00:03:09.010> lead<00:03:09.459> now<00:03:09.579> out<00:03:09.760> looking<00:03:10.120> inside

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
definitely lead now out looking inside

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.539 
definitely lead now out looking inside
of<00:03:10.599> the<00:03:11.230> base<00:03:11.440> of<00:03:11.680> two<00:03:11.920> sky<00:03:12.129> there<00:03:12.310> he's<00:03:12.430> got

00:03:12.539 --> 00:03:12.549 
of the base of two sky there he's got

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:15.449 
of the base of two sky there he's got
almost<00:03:12.790> no<00:03:13.030> drones<00:03:13.329> and<00:03:14.099> that's<00:03:15.099> going<00:03:15.280> to<00:03:15.340> be

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:15.459 
almost no drones and that's going to be

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:18.120 
almost no drones and that's going to be
felt<00:03:15.760> in<00:03:15.879> about<00:03:16.120> like<00:03:16.569> 20<00:03:16.930> seconds<00:03:17.290> or<00:03:17.440> so<00:03:17.590> when

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.130 
felt in about like 20 seconds or so when

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:20.220 
felt in about like 20 seconds or so when
/<00:03:18.639> skies<00:03:19.000> just<00:03:19.030> able<00:03:19.389> to<00:03:19.510> muster<00:03:19.720> so<00:03:19.959> many<00:03:20.139> more

00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:21.549 
troops and of course now that he doesn't

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:23.069 
troops and of course now that he doesn't
have<00:03:21.700> any<00:03:21.819> drones<00:03:22.420> mining<00:03:22.690> minerals<00:03:22.810> he's

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:29.370 
long as rage doesn't slip up here I
actually<00:03:27.700> think<00:03:27.940> ace<00:03:28.209> could<00:03:28.569> take<00:03:28.750> this<00:03:28.870> to<00:03:29.260> be

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:29.380 
actually think ace could take this to be

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:34.050 
actually think ace could take this to be
to<00:03:29.560> match<00:03:29.739> here<00:03:32.220> looks<00:03:33.220> like<00:03:33.340> rage<00:03:33.549> just

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
to match here looks like rage just

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:35.400 
to match here looks like rage just

once<00:03:57.760> again<00:03:57.880> perhaps<00:03:58.120> thinking<00:03:58.419> about<00:03:58.599> going

00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:58.660 
once again perhaps thinking about going

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:01.020 
once again perhaps thinking about going
for<00:03:58.840> an<00:03:58.900> attack<00:03:59.139> here<00:03:59.519> no<00:04:00.519> it<00:04:00.639> looks<00:04:00.790> like<00:04:00.910> he's

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030 
for an attack here no it looks like he's

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:02.490 
for an attack here no it looks like he's
going<00:04:01.150> to<00:04:01.239> retreat<00:04:01.510> just<00:04:01.780> a<00:04:01.870> lot<00:04:02.049> of<00:04:02.139> dancing

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
going to retreat just a lot of dancing

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.050 
going to retreat just a lot of dancing
back<00:04:02.650> and<00:04:02.829> forth<00:04:02.980> a<00:04:03.040> lot<00:04:03.160> of<00:04:03.280> attempts<00:04:03.970> to

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.060 
back and forth a lot of attempts to

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:06.449 
back and forth a lot of attempts to
separate<00:04:04.419> the<00:04:04.540> forces<00:04:04.930> I<00:04:05.019> think<00:04:05.230> and<00:04:05.459> once

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:06.459 
separate the forces I think and once

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:07.559 
separate the forces I think and once
they're<00:04:06.609> separated<00:04:07.030> to<00:04:07.120> attack<00:04:07.389> them

00:04:07.559 --> 00:04:07.569 
they're separated to attack them

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:09.289 
they're separated to attack them
piecemeal<00:04:07.810> of<00:04:08.169> course<00:04:08.380> that<00:04:08.500> is<00:04:08.650> the<00:04:08.799> way<00:04:08.950> of

00:04:09.289 --> 00:04:09.299 
piecemeal of course that is the way of

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:12.240 
piecemeal of course that is the way of
great<00:04:10.299> generals<00:04:10.959> throughout<00:04:11.380> history<00:04:11.650> is<00:04:12.099> to

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250 
great generals throughout history is to

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:14.670

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:16.780 
smaller force it and still win if you

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:18.629 
smaller force it and still win if you
