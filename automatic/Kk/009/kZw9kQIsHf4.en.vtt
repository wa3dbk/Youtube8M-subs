00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.700
 there are very good youtube here and I know that 

00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:05.380
 commenting is I bring an episode of 

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:07.090
 nuclear mentality that you know once 

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:08.709
 per week this time then adjusting 

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:10.329
 hurrying on Sunday well you know 

00:00:08.709 --> 00:00:11.769
 because it was by the chance that 

00:00:10.329 --> 00:00:14.289
 the good years came out the new 

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:16.630
 camouflages and he wanted to bring the nuclear 

00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:18.460
 The sooner I could, it's with the new 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:19.779
 camouflage not with the dragon you follow that 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.570
 I have pending we have also with one 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:24.339
 of nuclear with the cyborg camouflage but 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:26.199
 well let's what we 're going and how I'm doing 

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:27.849
 seeing in the title new episode and we 

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:29.980
 it's about talking about kings pau is not 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:31.779
 one thing that I deal with separately 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:33.340
 say it in the respawn guides but that 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:35.680
 I wanted to talk about the importance that 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.210
 has this since as I said in the 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.690
 previous episode the most important thing is 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:42.250
 eliminate the minimap continuously and 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.050
 then the second most important thing or maybe 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.360
 the most important thing above the minimum 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:47.740
 for would be responsible respawn not 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.090
 are you going to be able to do any streak is what 

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:51.040
 most important the call of duty in 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.480
 any game of shooters is the most 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.090
 important to know where the 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.500
 enemy and good we are going very very soon with 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.600
 the first moment so to speak of 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.070
 tension or first decision making and 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.420
 good taking advantage of that I take stock in 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.340
 the weapon explains the thing that I have 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.710
 you see jce start for the enemy and 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:07.330
 it's worth it goes but it stays like in 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.770
 the hole then 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.180
 we have the option to let shoot but 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:12.670
 risk that just when we leave 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.320
 to shoot the guy come out so I eat 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.820
 I have a stock but what I do is make a 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.230
 little bit of spray that would be re- burning 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.060
 throwing bullets by tyner towards the door 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:20.830
 while I pull back to 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.090
 hide my weapon recharge gives the 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.410
 chance that as you will see now the 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.540
 enemy comes out and I take it ahead 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:27.210
 because that's what the spray is for 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:29.320
 so that you while you are covering yourself 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.450
 earn a little bit of time and that is the 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:33.400
 enemy happens then you kill him not because 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:34.240
 I'm lucky in that enemy situation 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.440
 pass killed him 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.410
 neither my goal was not my goal 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:41.470
 kill him in that instant but as I have 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:42.370
 said cover and recharge and good as 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:45.960
 you are seeing is a hot spot 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:48.610
 playing alone on the 'break' map but 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.229
 gives the peculiarity that this does not happen 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.300
 almost never got me with a very team 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:54.640
 good and what I was throwing a lot is to use 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:57.280
 so I was playing alone I mean 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.630
 I did not know anyone but the truth is 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.040
 the team was very good and well this is that 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.600
 makes things very easy, they do not see 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.270
 clouds tighten the air almost all the time more 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.399
 what do you throw? 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.329
 it comes in handy to make you this guy 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:08.489
 of streaks 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:09.599
 you're just asking the thing 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.310
 I wear because I have the mini beyond 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.660
 point and good this is a class that 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.099
 we could consider competitive 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.200
 something for the coalman and a competitive 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:19.440
 Well, the scavenger would exchange it for a 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.629
 as a trophy system and a secondary one and 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.099
 in this case I was waiting for 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:24.540
 that invited me in competitive those 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:26.790
 games that you put in between for 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.709
 make time not to be invited and 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.970
 Hey, this job came out, I'm just 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:31.530
 As I tell you, well, it comes to me very 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.370
 well to explain the subject to you 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.870
 response 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.549
 and well now it 's about to reach 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.079
 another situation so good from 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:38.459
 this situation is to start talking a 

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:40.530
 little of the answers of the truth is 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:42.630
 this one they see quite short is a tad 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.040
 fast since good also wanted me 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.360
 give a bit of a hurry since I just 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.829
 they were already saying to play they were 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.750
 inviting this example of cinema mode by 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:50.610
 what may seem a bit fake 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.530
 sometimes but let's go I was 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.180
 hurry I wanted to do the nuclear thing 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.530
 quick because they were inviting me no longer 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.299
 I wanted to leave shots to my teammates 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.280
 I have no, I am not going to leave 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:00.510
 heading that a fairly high streak does not and 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.769
 well here comes the next shot of 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.750
 decisions bis as it came to the first 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:05.069
 enemy and here we have bad luck 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.790
 of the answer is what I'm going to talk about 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:07.319
 now 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.740
 then you see how there is an enemy above 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:10.390
 clicking is saying 

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:12.310
 if I'm going to put the most likely ones that 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.870
 mate and we see how two have reappeared 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:16.030
 enemies from behind we can say from behind 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.650
 on the right one is looking towards 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.210
 where I'm looking at me and another one is 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.620
 seeing for my right then what do they do 

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:22.120
 in that situation you always have to go 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:25.750
 as I say for the enemy who is alone 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:27.160
 that is, I go to my right and finish 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.750
 with him a little bit about too 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.250
 obviously but that would also be 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.900
 another option to throw back is to say 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.970
 retro of those my steps and get in 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.590
 in the house in this case he has put 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.760
 for hitting the wall to dodge 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.410
 bullets of the enemy is how he is 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.510
 shooting from behind hit me to the wall 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:42.520
 to finish later with him and good 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:44.320
 previously eliminating the enemy that I 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:46.870
 had been born back then we go with 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:48.760
 the remains of passes well, you have the 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.840
 respawn map guides is worth so that 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.990
 take a look a little bit 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:55.150
 orientative and also as I said 

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:57.640
 the allies mark where they are towards the 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:59.050
 enemies then if you want to kill 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.670
 sarkozy you want to follow a style of 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:02.200
 aggressive game like me and already 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:03.730
 exposes a good sack that you have to do 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.950
 is to separate them from the partners so that 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:07.540
 be born close to your enemies what happens 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:09.700
 with this, what happens to me happened 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:12.220
 in the situation before you can 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.420
 do a lot of blow spread or 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:15.190
 many at once in one place 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:17.049
 concentrated and not having the bullets 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:19.239
 in the time frame to kill 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:22.540
 all then it's a style of play the 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:24.820
 funny risky rush but it's clear 

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:27.910
 difficult to make the gusts 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:29.950
 say it because you play it a lot many 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:31.480
 chances of getting killed since if 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:33.040
 you have basically relies on luck 

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:34.960
 not if you have bad luck they are all born of 

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:37.780
 hit close to you and you have no margin of 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:39.700
 maneuver because they kill you and then if you walk 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:41.500
 a little bit as I've done 

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:42.990
 before then he can save you but you have 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:44.920
 to be pretty clever then 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:46.690
 luguesa because it always helps a lot 

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:47.920
 so that you learn them responsibly see 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:49.330
 my guides and so I recommend 

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:50.890
 always play with clouds as because apart 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:52.810
 that you will find it easier to act 

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:56.440
 the nuclear ones are going to start learning 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:58.510
 the respondents good that that is 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:01.150
 clear that if you want to become nuclear 

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:03.070
 fast funny nuclear nuclear a 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:04.270
 I take out then you have to go to your 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:05.470
 responsible for your separated 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:06.880
 companions and the cheers for what 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:08.410
 happens that what happens to me can happen 

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:10.330
 before they come to you many at once and you 

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:11.530
 kill here another situation is going to come 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:13.060
 quite uncomfortable as this well of 

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:14.170
 clouds to all the concentrated enemies 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:15.940
 inside the house in its surroundings 

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:17.680
 so I'm not going to go after them with the 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:19.390
 few bullets that I have and less than me 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:20.590
 missing one for the nuclear not here fails 

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:22.200
 a lot of bullets I get to accept 

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:24.780
 some but 

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:26.190
 and I was left alone with the knife I never 

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:28.230
 just carry secondary I know it's 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:30.060
 It is advisable to take something from the ground in case 

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:31.590
 I do not have secondary school but it is also 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:33.930
 because with the knife you run a little 

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:35.520
 more time then sometimes sometimes because I 

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:37.020
 it's very good that's worth then 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:38.940
 situation that we do not have bullets that 

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:41.070
 you have to make two options or stick to 

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:42.810
 a partner and I killed someone and 

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:44.160
 take the scavenger's backpack or as 

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:45.810
 I will do in this case taking advantage 

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:47.850
 that there is a kiss trying to go for a 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:49.560
 enemy that is quite isolated and 

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:51.510
 look for your back is to say that you do not 

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:53.520
 see no time you hide wait for 

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:54.630
 what happens and the blade is worth in this 

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.800
 case as you are seeing I am going to 

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:58.200
 enemy is in the part on the left 

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:59.310
 I was going up or down I did not have very 

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:01.080
 Of course I was waiting a little bit 

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:02.610
 meat was there when it turns around 

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:04.440
 is when I take advantage of him as I 

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:06.620
 I say and do not let the uncle never see you 

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:09.270
 come back down I hope it happens 

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:13.560
 jump and there's a slash fail so that
