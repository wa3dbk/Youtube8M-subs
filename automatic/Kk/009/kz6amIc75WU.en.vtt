00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.850
 Hi guys , how are you? 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.789
 today one more base review for you 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:30.359
 that today's chosen base is the date and 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.949
 hour now listen to my number choice 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.280
 1 0 20 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:38.010
 I really liked that base the champion in 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.780
 last year's finale and she was 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.960
 very good I leave my skin very 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.570
 beautiful to her is a vacancy of chiquinho tem 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.039
 oily skin and I like the wedding 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.129
 she did not really let the super 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:52.020
 Matilda selector teacher with her 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.180
 It looked very beautiful for the night. 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:57.289
 I was happy for the holidays. 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.289
 let's introduce 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:05.560
 we base application then it is the base 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:11.530
 Today is not like I said it's hours 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:13.570
 who I am and my color is 0 21/15 and 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:16.300
 long ago wanted to have this base 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:18.220
 okay because I read many reviews in 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:20.710
 several very feminine blogs among 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:23.560
 women speaking you base is very good 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:26.140
 makes the skin beautiful and I was the same 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:29.320
 so it has a light texture 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:31.420
 but that covers old man then I bought 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:34.210
 at the end of last year this was not in the 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:36.340
 end of last year november clay me 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:39.100
 I told my side with the marcinha 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:41.619
 facebook, it 's beautiful, I had 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.450
 bought in Paraguay is cheaper but 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:47.259
 whenever I went there on the floor of my color 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:49.210
 and if he stood up or not, then 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:52.060
 The texture of the base on these people 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:56.530
 is that it has a texture that is not 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:58.600
 very thick is a texture okay and a 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:03.670
 pigmentation is very good when you 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:05.740
 she 's there she covers well she does not 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:08.950
 it is argued that it is cut into the pocket without 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:12.040
 leaving faults she does not cover well and she 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:14.170
 it is a very dry base for not so 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.090
 completely mate but I think she 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.519
 left until the moment of my skin well 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.950
 and look beautiful to use both 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:23.080
 during the day and at night before 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.300
 It uses a layer sun goes at night 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:28.180
 a layer a little bit I think 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:30.459
 It needs and it looks great. 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.560
 Her duration is very good on my skin. 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:34.269
 It was there I said extremely valuable 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.129
 then it was a wooden base stay 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:38.049
 just an investment even for me 

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:40.180
 apply half of the face to you 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:43.510
 to see the difference in coverage 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:46.030
 I passed the moisturizer and passed a 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:54.880
 trailer too that I used was this one 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:57.400
 da melo foto linde and this is it we are going to 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.920
 connection of the base will connect the 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:02.430
 base with a reggae brush I'll apply on 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.430
 Cashier 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:12.890
 Botafogo too. 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:35.390
 So I stayed on this side of the face and 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:37.819
 you can see how well it covers 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:40.489
 the dark circles and if a girl is fine 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:43.010
 marked that the young man founds and here 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:45.709
 there is a good margin of clarity what I 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:47.629
 the more I like it on this basis that it covers 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:50.329
 but she has a faith makes an appearance 

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:52.700
 very natural very very very natural 

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:54.620
 the player who had 111 thorn china 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:57.590
 Here one here is looking like a 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:59.840
 I have already covered enough to say that there 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:02.629
 a high culture but the average coverage 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:06.590
 her is very good very good table 

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:10.700
 It's just her dry face. 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:13.010
 Transferring almost nothing is then I 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:15.409
 I'm totally in love with this 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:17.810
 military base is an understanding that neither I 

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:19.820
 I always say that if you want to invest 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:21.109
 a product seen many roles 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:23.479
 instead of investing in lipstick 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:25.880
 invest in a shadow because if the skin 

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:27.169
 not done well and you do not have a 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.699
 good base 

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:31.580
 it's no use making a sauce 

00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:33.470
 the little red button that the 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:37.099
 state will not be the same 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:38.870
 so it's a base that index you are 

00:04:37.099 --> 00:04:40.010
 to Mexicans who were no longer 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:41.960
 cockroach 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:44.380
 I quite liked the now terminal 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.380
 to apply 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:54.900
 I made two banks in every two points 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:57.240
 on either side of the other is the other 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:05:01.350
 inside when some apply it seems 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:03.030
 mark ours that plaster but it is not going away 

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:05.760
 publishing is spreading it 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:07.680
 share her it's getting perfect 

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:11.540
 I like to apply the base by giving 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:15.270
 they are not spreading by beating 

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:17.160
 pulling together in the sky, it's going too 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:20.340
 make a difference but ensures a 

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:23.820
 Better coverage on base then for me. 

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:26.310
 will take better advantage of your ready base 

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:28.080
 applied base of this base cover 

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:30.030
 so I'll put photos from before 

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:32.520
 later on the blog it becomes easier to 

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:34.140
 view this basic review 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:35.910
 I'll leave some more information and 

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:37.590
 remember things in a blog post I'm going to 

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:41.720
 put the link here below for you 

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:41.720
 a kiss and until the next video
