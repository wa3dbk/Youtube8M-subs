forming<00:00:15.599> in<00:00:15.690> to<00:00:15.809> remember<00:00:16.230> that<00:00:16.440> we<00:00:16.560> write

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
forming in to remember that we write

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.000 
forming in to remember that we write
human<00:00:17.250> sentence<00:00:17.730> on<00:00:18.000> the<00:00:18.119> top<00:00:18.650> so<00:00:19.650> we<00:00:19.830> know

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
human sentence on the top so we know

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.950 
human sentence on the top so we know
that<00:00:20.039> we<00:00:20.520> have<00:00:20.640> to<00:00:20.760> take<00:00:20.970> away<00:00:21.240> the<00:00:21.390> units<00:00:21.750> from

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
that we have to take away the units from

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.740 
that we have to take away the units from
the<00:00:22.050> units<00:00:22.560> and<00:00:22.710> the<00:00:23.279> tens<00:00:23.550> from<00:00:23.820> the<00:00:24.060> tens<00:00:24.300> now

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
the units and the tens from the tens now

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.700 
the units and the tens from the tens now
here<00:00:25.439> we<00:00:25.769> have<00:00:25.949> four<00:00:26.460> units<00:00:26.990> from<00:00:27.990> four<00:00:28.349> units

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
here we have four units from four units

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.130 
here we have four units from four units
you<00:00:28.830> have<00:00:28.949> to<00:00:29.039> take<00:00:29.220> away<00:00:29.490> three<00:00:30.029> four<00:00:30.660> take

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
you have to take away three four take

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.040 
you have to take away three four take
away<00:00:31.380> three<00:00:31.619> answer<00:00:32.250> is<00:00:32.430> one<00:00:32.809> so<00:00:33.809> in<00:00:33.930> the

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
away three answer is one so in the

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.660 
away three answer is one so in the
unit's<00:00:34.579> we<00:00:35.579> write<00:00:35.790> one<00:00:36.800> we<00:00:37.800> have<00:00:38.010> three<00:00:38.309> tens

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
unit's we write one we have three tens

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.380 
unit's we write one we have three tens
three<00:00:39.270> take<00:00:39.960> away<00:00:40.320> one<00:00:40.950> so<00:00:41.550> you<00:00:41.670> take<00:00:41.879> away<00:00:42.000> one

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
three take away one so you take away one

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:48.470 
three take away one so you take away one
equals<00:00:42.899> two<00:00:43.760> the<00:00:44.760> answer<00:00:45.149> is<00:00:45.329> 21<00:00:46.289> 34<00:00:47.160> minus<00:00:48.059> 13

equals two the answer is 21 34 minus 13
equals<00:00:48.690> 21<00:00:49.680> if<00:00:49.860> you<00:00:49.890> say<00:00:50.219> X<00:00:50.340> minus<00:00:50.760> 24<00:00:51.149> we<00:00:51.750> are

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
equals 21 if you say X minus 24 we are

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.200 
equals 21 if you say X minus 24 we are
going<00:00:51.989> to<00:00:52.079> take<00:00:52.230> away<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.739> units<00:00:53.699> from<00:00:53.969> the

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
going to take away the units from the

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.630 
going to take away the units from the
units<00:00:54.539> and<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:55.050> tens<00:00:55.320> from<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:55.949> tens<00:00:56.309> over

units and the tens from the tens over

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:03.260 
units and the tens from the tens over
here<00:00:58.550> 6-4<00:00:59.780> 6-2<00:01:00.780> away<00:01:01.170> for<00:01:01.469> answer<00:01:02.280> is<00:01:02.430> two<00:01:02.670> we

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
here 6-4 6-2 away for answer is two we

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.590 
here 6-4 6-2 away for answer is two we
write<00:01:03.480> two<00:01:03.870> in<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.439> unit's<00:01:04.769> place<00:01:04.979> and<00:01:05.600> then

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
write two in the unit's place and then

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.260 
write two in the unit's place and then
we<00:01:06.750> actually<00:01:07.080> solve<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.560> tens<00:01:07.830> five<00:01:08.790> take

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
we actually solve the tens five take

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.039 
we actually solve the tens five take
away<00:01:09.299> 2<00:01:09.659> equals<00:01:10.560> 3<00:01:10.650> so<00:01:11.520> we<00:01:11.640> have<00:01:11.670> 3<00:01:11.880> tens<00:01:12.510> answer

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
away 2 equals 3 so we have 3 tens answer
