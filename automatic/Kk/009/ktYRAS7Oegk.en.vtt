reason why people like to go vegan is

00:03:46.919 --> 00:03:49.849 
reason why people like to go vegan is
that<00:03:47.489> because<00:03:47.700> a<00:03:48.419> lot<00:03:49.019> of<00:03:49.049> animals<00:03:49.500> that<00:03:49.709> we

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:49.859 
that because a lot of animals that we

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:52.159 
that because a lot of animals that we
are<00:03:50.069> consuming<00:03:50.700> like<00:03:50.880> pigs<00:03:51.720> and<00:03:51.959> cows<00:03:52.139> and

chickens and fish they actually are

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.539 
chickens and fish they actually are
quite<00:03:55.410> intelligent<00:03:56.160> they've<00:03:56.340> actually

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:56.549 
quite intelligent they've actually

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:58.729 
quite intelligent they've actually
discovered<00:03:57.239> that<00:03:57.359> pigs<00:03:57.720> are<00:03:57.900> more

00:03:58.729 --> 00:03:58.739 
discovered that pigs are more

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:01.729 
discovered that pigs are more
intelligent<00:03:59.150> than<00:04:00.150> our<00:04:00.329> dogs<00:04:00.569> but<00:04:01.410> the<00:04:01.530> thing

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739 
intelligent than our dogs but the thing

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:05.659 
intelligent than our dogs but the thing
is<00:04:01.769> that<00:04:01.950> we<00:04:02.489> are<00:04:02.519> we<00:04:03.419> love<00:04:03.720> and<00:04:04.250> we<00:04:05.250> love<00:04:05.519> our

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:07.889 
dogs and we love our cats so much there

00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:09.550 
dogs and we love our cats so much there
are<00:04:08.010> companions<00:04:08.459> and<00:04:08.819> I<00:04:08.910> think<00:04:09.120> that's<00:04:09.269> great

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:09.560 
are companions and I think that's great

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:12.199 
are companions and I think that's great
but<00:04:10.560> to<00:04:10.919> me<00:04:11.040> it<00:04:11.190> just<00:04:11.220> kind<00:04:11.669> of<00:04:11.730> there's<00:04:12.000> a<00:04:12.060> bit

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:12.209 
but to me it just kind of there's a bit

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:15.199 
but to me it just kind of there's a bit
of<00:04:12.239> a<00:04:12.329> disconnect<00:04:12.680> when<00:04:13.680> you<00:04:14.250> love<00:04:14.489> that<00:04:14.760> and

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209 
of a disconnect when you love that and

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:16.699 
of a disconnect when you love that and
then<00:04:15.389> you<00:04:15.510> have<00:04:15.660> like<00:04:15.690> bacon<00:04:16.260> on<00:04:16.349> your<00:04:16.380> plate

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:16.709 
then you have like bacon on your plate

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:20.000 
then you have like bacon on your plate
or<00:04:17.570> you're<00:04:18.570> eating<00:04:18.870> beef<00:04:19.049> and<00:04:19.410> it<00:04:19.560> just<00:04:19.769> kind

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
or you're eating beef and it just kind

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:21.890 
or you're eating beef and it just kind
of<00:04:20.070> um<00:04:20.250> to<00:04:20.820> me<00:04:20.940> it<00:04:21.060> just<00:04:21.120> seems<00:04:21.479> like<00:04:21.599> there's<00:04:21.780> a

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
of um to me it just seems like there's a

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.020 
of um to me it just seems like there's a
bit<00:04:22.049> of<00:04:22.079> a<00:04:22.169> disconnect<00:04:22.380> and<00:04:22.950> I<00:04:23.760> don't<00:04:23.909> think

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030 
bit of a disconnect and I don't think

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.120 
bit of a disconnect and I don't think
anybody<00:04:24.300> is<00:04:24.539> a<00:04:24.570> bad<00:04:24.840> person<00:04:25.349> for<00:04:25.530> eating

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
anybody is a bad person for eating

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:27.379 
anybody is a bad person for eating
animal<00:04:26.430> products<00:04:26.789> and

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:27.389 
animal products and

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:28.670 
animal products and
so<00:04:27.479> one<00:04:27.870> of<00:04:27.960> the<00:04:28.020> one<00:04:28.199> of<00:04:28.229> the<00:04:28.349> reasons<00:04:28.560> why

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 
so one of the one of the reasons why

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.860 
so one of the one of the reasons why
people<00:04:28.889> like<00:04:29.069> to<00:04:29.159> go<00:04:29.249> vegan<00:04:29.430> is<00:04:29.729> because<00:04:30.240> they

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:30.870 
people like to go vegan is because they

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:32.929 
people like to go vegan is because they
realize<00:04:31.259> that<00:04:31.499> you<00:04:32.129> know<00:04:32.159> all<00:04:32.430> animals<00:04:32.909> are

00:04:32.929 --> 00:04:32.939 
realize that you know all animals are

00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:35.600 
realize that you know all animals are
going<00:04:33.090> to<00:04:33.150> feel<00:04:33.330> pain<00:04:33.949> all<00:04:34.949> animals<00:04:35.430> feel

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
going to feel pain all animals feel

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:37.730 
going to feel pain all animals feel
emotions<00:04:36.150> and<00:04:36.240> they're<00:04:36.389> all<00:04:36.740> sentient<00:04:37.740> beings

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:37.740 
emotions and they're all sentient beings

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:40.309 
emotions and they're all sentient beings
so<00:04:38.729> they<00:04:38.819> don't<00:04:38.909> necessarily<00:04:39.150> you<00:04:39.900> know<00:04:39.930> want

00:04:40.309 --> 00:04:40.319 
so they don't necessarily you know want

00:04:40.319 --> 00:04:43.309 
so they don't necessarily you know want
to<00:04:40.469> be<00:04:40.560> killed<00:04:40.889> and<00:04:41.509> killed<00:04:42.509> for<00:04:43.169> our

00:04:43.309 --> 00:04:43.319 
to be killed and killed for our

to be killed and killed for our
consumption<00:04:43.800> as<00:04:44.039> well<00:04:44.090> so<00:04:45.090> those<00:04:45.270> are<00:04:45.419> for

00:04:45.709 --> 00:04:45.719 
consumption as well so those are for

00:04:45.719 --> 00:04:48.050 
consumption as well so those are for
little<00:04:46.020> no<00:04:46.259> no<00:04:46.680> one<00:04:46.860> reasons<00:04:47.279> why<00:04:47.520> people<00:04:47.849> like

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:48.060 
little no no one reasons why people like

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:49.640
