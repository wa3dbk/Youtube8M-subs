this<00:00:00.120> is<00:00:00.240> the<00:00:00.329> 2012<00:00:00.960> Prius<00:00:01.500> C<00:00:01.709> this<00:00:01.920> is<00:00:02.220> the

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:02.250 
this is the 2012 Prius C this is the

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:03.889 
this is the 2012 Prius C this is the
smallest<00:00:02.700> member<00:00:03.060> of<00:00:03.090> the<00:00:03.300> Prius<00:00:03.570> family

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:03.899 
smallest member of the Prius family

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:15.400 
smallest member of the Prius family
let's<00:00:04.290> take<00:00:04.470> it<00:00:04.589> for<00:00:04.710> a<00:00:04.740> spin

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:15.410 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:17.660 

so<00:00:16.410> essentially<00:00:16.710> what<00:00:16.890> towed<00:00:17.100> is<00:00:17.250> done<00:00:17.490> to

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
so essentially what towed is done to

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.910 
so essentially what towed is done to
create<00:00:17.850> the<00:00:18.060> prius<00:00:18.390> c<00:00:18.420> is<00:00:18.840> they've<00:00:19.380> taken<00:00:19.529> a

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
create the prius c is they've taken a

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.980 
create the prius c is they've taken a
four-door<00:00:20.460> hatchback<00:00:20.699> Yaris<00:00:21.449> they've

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
four-door hatchback Yaris they've

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.630 
four-door hatchback Yaris they've
stripped<00:00:22.560> out<00:00:22.769> the<00:00:22.890> suspension<00:00:23.250> the<00:00:23.490> engine

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
stripped out the suspension the engine

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.000 
stripped out the suspension the engine
and<00:00:24.060> transmission<00:00:24.330> they<00:00:25.109> stuffed<00:00:25.560> in<00:00:25.800> the

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
and transmission they stuffed in the

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.609 
and transmission they stuffed in the
suspension<00:00:26.609> modified<00:00:27.330> from<00:00:27.660> a<00:00:27.779> regular<00:00:28.230> Prius

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
suspension modified from a regular Prius

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.099 
suspension modified from a regular Prius
and<00:00:28.890> then<00:00:29.490> they<00:00:29.670> took<00:00:29.849> the<00:00:30.210> engine<00:00:30.689> from<00:00:30.929> the

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
and then they took the engine from the

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.130 
and then they took the engine from the
former<00:00:31.619> generation<00:00:32.160> Prius<00:00:32.399> the<00:00:33.090> 1.5<00:00:33.809> liter

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
stuff that into the hood and then they

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.290 
stuff that into the hood and then they
took<00:00:40.320> the<00:00:40.530> transmission<00:00:41.309> and<00:00:41.550> hybrid<00:00:42.149> synergy

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
took the transmission and hybrid synergy

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.319 
took the transmission and hybrid synergy
drive<00:00:42.540> power<00:00:43.469> splitting<00:00:43.950> devices<00:00:44.430> out<00:00:44.789> of<00:00:45.180> the

drive power splitting devices out of the
regular<00:00:45.840> Prius<00:00:46.289> and<00:00:46.559> they<00:00:46.800> modified<00:00:47.399> them

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
regular Prius and they modified them

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.299 
regular Prius and they modified them
with<00:00:48.120> to<00:00:48.989> make<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.230> footprint<00:00:49.680> smaller<00:00:50.010> to

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
with to make the footprint smaller to

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.700 
with to make the footprint smaller to
fit<00:00:50.489> under<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:50.879> hood<00:00:51.059> of<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.539> Prius<00:00:51.870> C<00:00:52.079> the

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
fit under the hood of the Prius C the

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.920 
fit under the hood of the Prius C the
combination<00:00:53.489> is<00:00:53.610> good<00:00:53.760> for<00:00:54.000> 99<00:00:54.390> horsepower

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
combination is good for 99 horsepower

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.790 
combination is good for 99 horsepower
but<00:00:55.920> it<00:00:56.010> also<00:00:56.190> is<00:00:56.699> good<00:00:56.940> for<00:00:57.180> being<00:00:57.390> 500<00:00:57.800> pounds

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
but it also is good for being 500 pounds

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.670 
but it also is good for being 500 pounds
less<00:00:59.190> than<00:00:59.550> the<00:01:00.149> curb<00:01:00.750> weight<00:01:00.930> of<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.289> regular

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
less than the curb weight of the regular

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:11.819 
less than the curb weight of the regular
Prius

side on the road the Prius II handles

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:16.149 
side on the road the Prius II handles
exactly<00:01:14.719> like<00:01:14.869> what<00:01:15.049> you'd<00:01:15.140> expect<00:01:15.259> out<00:01:15.799> of<00:01:15.829> a

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:16.159 
exactly like what you'd expect out of a

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:19.240 
exactly like what you'd expect out of a
cross<00:01:16.399> between<00:01:16.640> a<00:01:17.119> Prius<00:01:17.750> and<00:01:18.020> a<00:01:18.079> Yaris<00:01:18.439> that

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:19.250 
cross between a Prius and a Yaris that

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:20.709 
cross between a Prius and a Yaris that
is<00:01:19.369> to<00:01:19.520> say<00:01:19.670> you<00:01:19.729> know<00:01:19.880> the<00:01:19.969> handling<00:01:20.420> is<00:01:20.539> not

00:01:20.709 --> 00:01:20.719 
is to say you know the handling is not

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:23.410 
is to say you know the handling is not
bad<00:01:20.959> for<00:01:21.350> a<00:01:21.380> small<00:01:21.530> car<00:01:21.859> but<00:01:22.459> it's<00:01:22.850> not<00:01:23.030> really

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
bad for a small car but it's not really

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:24.910 
bad for a small car but it's not really
a<00:01:23.450> Mazda<00:01:23.929> 3

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920 
a Mazda 3

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
but then against not really trying to be

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:27.580 
but then against not really trying to be
either<00:01:26.599> what<00:01:26.840> it<00:01:26.929> is<00:01:27.049> trying<00:01:27.170> to<00:01:27.349> be<00:01:27.439> is

either what it is trying to be is

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.550 
either what it is trying to be is
extraordinarily<00:01:28.569> economical<00:01:29.569> and<00:01:29.719> we've

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
extraordinarily economical and we've

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.679 
extraordinarily economical and we've
been<00:01:30.709> averaging<00:01:30.890> 54<00:01:31.759> miles<00:01:32.030> per<00:01:32.329> gallon

00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:42.649 
as you can see you know if you look out

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:44.469 
as you can see you know if you look out
in<00:01:42.770> the<00:01:42.799> distance<00:01:43.250> you<00:01:43.969> know<00:01:44.090> we<00:01:44.209> have<00:01:44.360> been

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479 
in the distance you know we have been

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:46.539 
in the distance you know we have been
going<00:01:44.750> up<00:01:44.869> and<00:01:45.049> down<00:01:45.170> hills<00:01:45.560> in<00:01:45.920> our<00:01:46.039> Prius<00:01:46.340> C

going up and down hills in our Prius C

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:48.190 
going up and down hills in our Prius C
and<00:01:46.700> it<00:01:46.759> hasn't<00:01:46.939> really<00:01:47.119> affected<00:01:47.810> the<00:01:47.929> fuel

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 
and it hasn't really affected the fuel

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.929 
and it hasn't really affected the fuel
economy<00:01:48.409> as<00:01:48.770> much<00:01:49.009> as<00:01:49.219> I<00:01:49.399> would<00:01:49.459> have<00:01:49.700> thought

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:49.939 
economy as much as I would have thought

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:53.709 
economy as much as I would have thought

the the Prius C are fairly similar to

00:01:58.209 --> 00:01:58.219 
the Prius we have you know fairly hard -

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:02.109 
the Prius we have you know fairly hard -
parts<00:01:59.319> keeping<00:02:00.319> weight<00:02:00.500> down<00:02:00.739> basically<00:02:01.280> but

parts keeping weight down basically but

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:05.050 
parts keeping weight down basically but
we<00:02:02.270> do<00:02:02.479> have<00:02:02.659> soft<00:02:03.289> touch<00:02:03.560> points<00:02:04.039> in<00:02:04.819> the
