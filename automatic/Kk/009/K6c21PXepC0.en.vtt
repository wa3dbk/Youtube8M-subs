00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:07.400
 hello friends with you kind of raslov and 

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:09.110
 today we will talk about one of my 

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.970
 most favorite achievements in warcraft 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:13.490
 the achievements that I received just 

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:15.559
 incredibly interesting way but first 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:17.480
 I would like to talk about what 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:19.039
 the monster channel interviewed them 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.140
 wind of the word that is not with me not with 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:23.269
 yes it is a panda character she 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.650
 plastic roleplay style and it seems to me 

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:26.239
 that it is very interesting therefore 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:28.099
 There was a reference war can not press 

00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:31.069
 and look seriously i really like 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:34.430
 as if that's so and recommend Arena 

00:00:31.069 --> 00:00:37.609
 Gurubashi is a good old place to include 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:39.199
 battle mode just with everyone around then 

00:00:37.609 --> 00:00:40.879
 there is this the only place where alliance 

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:43.309
 after all, it can legitimately kill such 

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:45.050
 same sheep alliance and nothing for it 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:47.800
 will do well except that you take away from 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:51.260
 print can be but everything will be fine 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:54.379
 single mode will not turn on if 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.999
 you will be in a group or in a raid together then 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:58.159
 Pelvic can with friends 

00:00:55.999 --> 00:01:01.480
 getting the chef and what's the actual 

00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:04.040
 shining every 3 hours every day on 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.780
 the arena get a chest appears in 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.400
 Sudak in general loot to low levels 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.400
 which by and large is not needed and 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:13.250
 actually trinka which is also useful 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:15.380
 only that the kids but gives achivku 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:18.440
 So the essence of this achivki is that you need 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:20.180
 collect 12 such clinics for seated and 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.100
 Of course for one 3-ku but the coolest 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.870
 Chika for 12 such collected training 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.790
 there are 12 times you need to confuse this chest 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:28.370
 she is called the great lead master 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:31.390
 Gurubashi and despite the pretentious name 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:33.830
 it is really a very worthy thing 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:36.530
 training course again I repeat, even 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:39.580
 over 12 doesn't really make sense for 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:41.900
 current levels up to the nineties but 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.940
 The process of getting it is probably one 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:46.190
 of the most pleasant and interesting achivok 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.960
 wow and if I was asked right now what 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:51.830
 achivka i would like to do again i chose 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:54.110
 This is the essence of what is always in the arena 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:56.150
 there is almost always competition and 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.860
 us when i got i got it with mine 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.870
 brother and doing together he had a nickname 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.060
 radosvet he played for death knight it 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:05.420
 time times hunter new livargia 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:07.860
 we came to the arena together and he 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:11.670
 basically was in plastic I was basically 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:13.900
 then a m m with Beijing and the essence of our 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.460
 a simple trip was that he needed 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.870
 will give back opponents from 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:19.960
 a chest I would also be worth 5 of it 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:21.670
 stray more hunt can stand 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:25.120
 there sometimes nykaetsya somewhere in the corner catch 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:26.230
 just shoot down at least this caste 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.510
 a chest because how would when 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.940
 opens and the chest is such 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.610
 a kind of process well and 1 called him to 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.800
 wash it again let the caste be 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.570
 nA need to press some time talking 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.070
 its opening that is a few seconds per 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:40.690
 this time we if you hit him 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:43.030
 a character that opens that is from 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:45.430
 at the opening will be gone and you will need again 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:47.320
 open the chest and the most epic battle 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:48.760
 we passed there been 10 people when 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:51.190
 was in the arena that is really started 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:54.550
 meat and just a bloody orgy was very 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:56.260
 there were fun fighting characters 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:56.710
 came all the time nowadays it 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.220
 was such 

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:02.290
 dk their death and he and his friends on 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.670
 it was not enough for some fallen souls with 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.830
 chickpeas and leger kids eyes two levels 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.300
 who really wanted the stub of this dream 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:09.250
 were besplatni kino which stub 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:12.400
 can really be very useful here on 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:14.080
 this level of the letter is relevant here 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.330
 he stretched out friends babies tried 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.100
 confront us really 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:20.290
 kindness of mind first 20 levels we 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:22.270
 somehow nigan if several times 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.130
 some little horns just 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:26.680
 poked at the trunk and took it while you were 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:27.600
 you rush around there runoff 8 5 levels it's just 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.650
 was in a cataclysm 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.600
 so you had to cheat somehow 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.580
 sometimes because it is further fatalism 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:35.860
 work this stupid bonus but although 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:37.120
 certainly had its advantages, this completely 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:39.040
 when all the allies could all 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.140
 can call in 3-5 people 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:44.320
 ask to call them you almost always 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:45.910
 big raid pick up the chest this one 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:47.140
 bonus work unfortunately sometimes been 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:49.420
 situations that appeared there 1 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:51.220
 remember to test the radio was also 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:53.320
 very epic fight i came in the morning brother 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:54.760
 i was still sleeping it was something five or 

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:57.190
 six in the morning there at various times slept and 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:59.800
 chest depending on it then summer there 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:01.750
 time is not summer time fighting death with him 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:04.810
 cad one on one order blood dk hunt but 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:06.790
 hard enough beat him but I 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:08.200
 left penny share opened the chest he 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:10.170
 quickly ran away graveyard killed me 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.640
 met not only it was very disappointing 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:14.920
 similar system acts on 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.970
 fair of the new moon but there is enough 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:19.640
 big disadvantage due to the fact that 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:21.350
 even briefly lasts mostly there 

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:22.850
 comes just a huge crowd that is 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:24.500
 Specifically, you will negotiate the guild 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:26.330
 there are ten people at a time 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:29.000
 very difficult she is rude all the same you can 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:30.650
 catch the moment when people have little in common 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.030
 sincerely recommend doing this chef 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:33.980
 especially if you are interested in pvp 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:36.350
 because interests are not only well in 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:38.810
 getting you achivki namely in the very 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:41.630
 process is the result of a cyst 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:43.760
 interesting as a process to achieve it 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:46.250
 ok if you tried to get a profit 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:48.230
 new moon tamarillo on Volodin or 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:49.760

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:52.030
