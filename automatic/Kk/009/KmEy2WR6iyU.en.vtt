00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
channel and how it makes an S pattern as

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.009 
channel and how it makes an S pattern as
it<00:00:39.269> goes<00:00:39.480> down<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:39.719> river<00:00:40.079> if<00:00:40.760> you<00:00:41.760> apply<00:00:42.600> what

00:00:50.419 --> 00:00:50.429 
bridge it'll all come together as a

00:00:50.429 --> 00:00:52.779 
bridge it'll all come together as a
whole<00:00:50.760> and<00:00:51.089> it'll<00:00:51.600> help<00:00:51.780> you<00:00:51.929> find<00:00:52.170> these<00:00:52.350> fish

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
it's the current and right now there's

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.349 
it's the current and right now there's
no<00:00:58.859> water<00:00:59.249> there's<00:00:59.489> no<00:00:59.609> current<00:00:59.969> but<00:01:00.120> I<00:01:00.149> can

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359

what what it looks like right now so the

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.110 
what what it looks like right now so the
current<00:01:07.140> would<00:01:07.290> come<00:01:07.530> as<00:01:07.830> as<00:01:08.100> I<00:01:08.520> described

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:09.120 
current would come as as I described

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.440 
current would come as as I described
before<00:01:09.150> it<00:01:09.690> would<00:01:09.780> come<00:01:10.020> in<00:01:10.320> an<00:01:10.440> S<00:01:10.710> shape<00:01:11.450> and

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
before it would come in an S shape and

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.960 
before it would come in an S shape and
as<00:01:13.140> it<00:01:13.590> comes<00:01:13.830> towards<00:01:14.100> this<00:01:14.400> bridge<00:01:14.700> we're

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
as it comes towards this bridge we're

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.840 
as it comes towards this bridge we're
here<00:01:15.150> at<00:01:15.300> Black's<00:01:15.990> bridge<00:01:16.320> in<00:01:17.070> Las<00:01:17.370> Cruces<00:01:17.820> New

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
here at Black's bridge in Las Cruces New

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.410 
here at Black's bridge in Las Cruces New
Mexico<00:01:18.650> one<00:01:19.650> of<00:01:19.770> my<00:01:19.920> regular<00:01:20.790> fishing<00:01:21.000> spots

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
Mexico one of my regular fishing spots

Mexico one of my regular fishing spots
when<00:01:21.660> there<00:01:21.840> is<00:01:21.960> water<00:01:22.460> but<00:01:23.460> it<00:01:23.670> would<00:01:23.790> come<00:01:24.060> in

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:24.620 
when there is water but it would come in

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:29.210 
when there is water but it would come in
an<00:01:25.620> S<00:01:25.830> shape<00:01:25.860> and<00:01:26.670> then<00:01:27.450> it<00:01:27.750> would<00:01:28.650> hit<00:01:28.920> one<00:01:29.130> of

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
an S shape and then it would hit one of

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.180 
an S shape and then it would hit one of
these<00:01:29.340> pillars<00:01:31.760> when<00:01:32.760> it's<00:01:32.940> passing<00:01:33.420> by<00:01:33.600> and

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:34.190 
these pillars when it's passing by and

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:37.070 
these pillars when it's passing by and
the<00:01:35.190> one<00:01:35.370> behind<00:01:35.520> me<00:01:35.820> is<00:01:35.970> where<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.690> current

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:37.080 
the one behind me is where the current

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.500 
the one behind me is where the current
hit<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:37.770> hardest<00:01:38.160> and<00:01:38.490> that's<00:01:39.240> going<00:01:39.420> to

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:39.510 
hit the hardest and that's going to

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:41.450 
hit the hardest and that's going to
carve<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:39.960> holes<00:01:40.230> out<00:01:40.530> that's<00:01:41.040> going<00:01:41.220> to<00:01:41.280> make

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
carve the holes out that's going to make

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.300 
carve the holes out that's going to make
the<00:01:41.610> deepest<00:01:41.970> spots<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:43.170> most<00:01:43.470> ideal<00:01:43.770> spot

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
the deepest spots the most ideal spot

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.630 
the deepest spots the most ideal spot
for<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:45.450> fish<00:01:45.690> to<00:01:45.720> hide<00:01:46.110> and<00:01:46.470> I'll<00:01:47.220> show<00:01:47.490> it<00:01:47.580> to

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
for the fish to hide and I'll show it to

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:54.590 
for the fish to hide and I'll show it to
you<00:01:47.760> right<00:01:47.970> now<00:01:50.510> alright<00:01:51.510> as<00:01:51.780> you<00:01:51.810> can<00:01:51.960> see<00:01:53.600> the

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
you right now alright as you can see the

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.010 
you right now alright as you can see the
water<00:01:54.810> would<00:01:55.740> be<00:01:55.770> flowing<00:01:56.480> and<00:01:57.480> hitting<00:01:57.900> this

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
water would be flowing and hitting this

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.010 
water would be flowing and hitting this
pillar<00:01:59.030> straight<00:02:00.030> against<00:02:00.480> that<00:02:00.660> flat

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
pillar straight against that flat

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.590 
pillar straight against that flat
surface<00:02:02.750> which<00:02:04.310> causes<00:02:05.310> the<00:02:05.460> water<00:02:05.610> to<00:02:05.820> have

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
surface which causes the water to have

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.350 
surface which causes the water to have
to<00:02:06.780> choose<00:02:07.080> to<00:02:07.470> go<00:02:07.620> left<00:02:07.860> or<00:02:08.039> right<00:02:08.099> and<00:02:09.000> it

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
to choose to go left or right and it

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.390 
to choose to go left or right and it
does<00:02:09.569> both<00:02:09.840> of<00:02:09.869> course<00:02:10.349> and<00:02:10.679> it<00:02:11.009> digs<00:02:11.280> out

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
does both of course and it digs out

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.589 
does both of course and it digs out
holes<00:02:11.730> along<00:02:12.030> the<00:02:12.090> side

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:18.690 

you<00:02:16.599> see<00:02:16.810> how<00:02:16.989> that<00:02:17.200> the<00:02:17.829> angle<00:02:18.249> gets<00:02:18.430> shallow

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
you see how that the angle gets shallow

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.239 
you see how that the angle gets shallow
on<00:02:19.030> the<00:02:19.209> concrete<00:02:19.689> it's<00:02:20.290> deeper<00:02:20.709> there<00:02:20.950> and

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:21.249 
on the concrete it's deeper there and

00:02:21.249 --> 00:02:25.160 
on the concrete it's deeper there and
then<00:02:21.370> it<00:02:21.489> goes<00:02:22.319> down<00:02:23.319> to<00:02:23.590> nothing<00:02:23.739> over<00:02:24.099> there

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
then it goes down to nothing over there

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:33.270 
then it goes down to nothing over there
and<00:02:26.170> it's<00:02:26.680> the<00:02:26.859> same<00:02:26.889> on<00:02:27.159> the<00:02:27.430> other<00:02:27.459> side<00:02:32.280> and

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
and it's the same on the other side and

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.129 
and it's the same on the other side and
I<00:02:33.790> can<00:02:33.969> go<00:02:34.120> around<00:02:34.209> that<00:02:34.450> side<00:02:34.510> and<00:02:34.870> show<00:02:35.079> you

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:35.139 
I can go around that side and show you

00:02:35.139 --> 00:02:37.160 
I can go around that side and show you
but<00:02:35.379> I<00:02:35.500> want<00:02:36.310> you<00:02:36.430> to<00:02:36.549> understand<00:02:37.000> that

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
but I want you to understand that

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.220 
but I want you to understand that
finding<00:02:38.170> the<00:02:38.889> channel<00:02:39.930> makes<00:02:40.930> a<00:02:41.049> big

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
finding the channel makes a big

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.140 
finding the channel makes a big
difference<00:02:41.650> because<00:02:41.950> this<00:02:42.159> is<00:02:42.310> the<00:02:42.459> the<00:02:42.760> ideal

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
difference because this is the the ideal

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.720 
difference because this is the the ideal
pillar<00:02:43.450> to<00:02:43.659> fish<00:02:43.980> let<00:02:44.980> me<00:02:45.069> show<00:02:45.310> you<00:02:45.370> a

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
pillar to fish let me show you a

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.830 
pillar to fish let me show you a
different<00:02:46.299> pillar<00:02:48.120> that's<00:02:49.120> not<00:02:49.510> in<00:02:49.719> the

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
different pillar that's not in the

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.000 
different pillar that's not in the
channel<00:02:52.139> which<00:02:53.139> would<00:02:53.290> be<00:02:53.439> that<00:02:53.590> one<00:02:53.769> over

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
channel which would be that one over

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.240 
channel which would be that one over
there<00:02:55.049> and<00:02:56.049> if<00:02:56.169> you<00:02:56.290> look<00:02:56.469> at<00:02:56.590> this<00:02:56.769> one

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
there and if you look at this one

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:01.470 
there and if you look at this one
that<00:02:57.669> it's<00:02:58.329> completely<00:02:58.870> flat<00:03:00.239> there's<00:03:01.239> no

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
that it's completely flat there's no

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.129 
that it's completely flat there's no
hole<00:03:02.169> dug<00:03:02.409> out<00:03:02.560> in<00:03:02.590> the<00:03:02.799> front<00:03:03.099> or<00:03:03.959> along<00:03:04.959> the

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:05.139 
hole dug out in the front or along the

00:03:05.139 --> 00:03:07.470 
hole dug out in the front or along the
sides<00:03:05.409> because<00:03:05.980> the<00:03:06.400> channel<00:03:06.879> did<00:03:07.090> not<00:03:07.239> hit

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
sides because the channel did not hit

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.800 
sides because the channel did not hit
there<00:03:07.810> and<00:03:08.049> there<00:03:08.980> was<00:03:09.129> not<00:03:09.449> enough<00:03:10.449> strength

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
there and there was not enough strength

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.750 
there and there was not enough strength
in<00:03:11.049> the<00:03:11.169> in<00:03:11.500> the<00:03:11.680> river<00:03:12.609> to<00:03:13.090> dig<00:03:13.329> out<00:03:13.510> the<00:03:14.019> holes

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
in the in the river to dig out the holes

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.970 
in the in the river to dig out the holes
along<00:03:15.760> the<00:03:15.909> sides<00:03:16.150> and<00:03:16.359> in<00:03:16.510> the<00:03:16.599> front

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.729 

so<00:03:19.980> once<00:03:20.430> you<00:03:20.579> can<00:03:20.730> distinguish<00:03:21.530> where<00:03:22.530> the

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739 
so once you can distinguish where the

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:25.819 
so once you can distinguish where the
channel<00:03:23.099> is<00:03:23.249> flowing<00:03:24.049> then<00:03:25.049> find<00:03:25.469> which

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:25.829 
channel is flowing then find which

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:30.670 
channel is flowing then find which
pillar<00:03:26.189> is<00:03:26.999> in<00:03:27.329> its<00:03:27.480> path<00:03:27.780> and<00:03:28.310> that'll<00:03:29.310> be

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 
pillar is in its path and that'll be

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.709 
pillar is in its path and that'll be
where<00:03:31.680> the<00:03:31.829> hole<00:03:32.040> is<00:03:32.069> going<00:03:32.340> to<00:03:32.400> be<00:03:32.489> and<00:03:33.299> this

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:33.719 
where the hole is going to be and this

00:03:33.719 --> 00:03:36.500 
where the hole is going to be and this
is<00:03:33.900> kind<00:03:34.620> of<00:03:34.650> like<00:03:34.769> I<00:03:34.920> said<00:03:34.980> on<00:03:35.430> the<00:03:35.480> log<00:03:36.480> jam

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
is kind of like I said on the log jam

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.440 
is kind of like I said on the log jam
video<00:03:37.349> it's<00:03:37.680> the<00:03:37.799> same<00:03:38.189> kind<00:03:38.579> of<00:03:38.670> concept<00:03:38.909> it

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
video it's the same kind of concept it

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.839 
video it's the same kind of concept it
digs<00:03:40.109> the<00:03:40.290> hole<00:03:40.500> in<00:03:40.650> the<00:03:40.739> front<00:03:41.099> along<00:03:41.670> the

00:03:41.839 --> 00:03:41.849 
digs the hole in the front along the

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:46.879 
digs the hole in the front along the
sides<00:03:42.120> and<00:03:42.450> it<00:03:42.689> deposits<00:03:43.349> all<00:03:44.719> the<00:03:45.719> sand<00:03:46.650> or

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:46.889 
sides and it deposits all the sand or

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:51.229 
sides and it deposits all the sand or
rock<00:03:47.099> along<00:03:48.030> the<00:03:48.180> back<00:03:49.760> let<00:03:50.760> me<00:03:50.849> scoot<00:03:51.150> over

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239 
rock along the back let me scoot over

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:53.300 
rock along the back let me scoot over
here<00:03:51.599> so<00:03:51.870> you<00:03:51.900> can<00:03:52.079> see<00:03:52.500> what<00:03:52.829> I'm<00:03:52.950> talking

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
here so you can see what I'm talking

00:03:53.310 --> 00:04:09.289 
here so you can see what I'm talking
about<00:04:07.129> so<00:04:08.129> you<00:04:08.159> can<00:04:08.340> see<00:04:08.699> the<00:04:08.819> water<00:04:09.000> came

00:04:09.289 --> 00:04:09.299 
about so you can see the water came

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:13.789 
about so you can see the water came
through<00:04:10.790> and<00:04:11.790> it<00:04:11.909> dug<00:04:12.209> this<00:04:12.419> out<00:04:12.689> in<00:04:13.500> a<00:04:13.530> nice

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:13.799 
through and it dug this out in a nice

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:16.719 
through and it dug this out in a nice
hole<00:04:14.069> and<00:04:14.310> then<00:04:14.459> it<00:04:15.060> piled<00:04:15.419> all<00:04:15.659> the<00:04:16.019> rock

00:04:16.719 --> 00:04:16.729 
hole and then it piled all the rock

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:23.589 
hole and then it piled all the rock
along<00:04:17.729> that<00:04:18.000> side<00:04:18.509> right<00:04:18.810> there

00:04:23.589 --> 00:04:23.599 

00:04:23.599 --> 00:04:26.240 

so<00:04:24.599> if<00:04:24.960> fish<00:04:25.139> are<00:04:25.289> holding<00:04:25.650> in<00:04:25.770> deep<00:04:25.949> water

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
so if fish are holding in deep water

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:28.610 
so if fish are holding in deep water
obviously<00:04:26.820> they're<00:04:26.970> going<00:04:27.060> to<00:04:27.120> be<00:04:27.210> on<00:04:27.900> the

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 
obviously they're going to be on the

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.640 
obviously they're going to be on the
sides<00:04:28.919> right<00:04:29.280> here<00:04:29.340> in<00:04:30.030> these<00:04:30.270> holes

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:30.650 
sides right here in these holes

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:33.290 
sides right here in these holes
depending<00:04:31.650> on<00:04:32.009> how<00:04:32.159> fast<00:04:32.460> the<00:04:32.639> current<00:04:33.000> is<00:04:33.120> it

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.300 
depending on how fast the current is it

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:34.790 
depending on how fast the current is it
might<00:04:33.449> be<00:04:33.479> a<00:04:33.659> little<00:04:33.990> bit<00:04:34.080> of<00:04:34.139> a<00:04:34.199> challenge<00:04:34.470> for

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 
might be a little bit of a challenge for

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.980 
might be a little bit of a challenge for
the<00:04:34.889> fish<00:04:35.130> to<00:04:35.159> sit<00:04:35.550> right<00:04:35.759> up<00:04:35.820> front<00:04:36.750> because

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
the fish to sit right up front because

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:39.140 
the fish to sit right up front because
the<00:04:37.380> water<00:04:37.620> will<00:04:37.800> be<00:04:37.919> churning<00:04:38.400> right<00:04:38.580> there

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150 
the water will be churning right there

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:42.800 
the water will be churning right there
and<00:04:40.280> if<00:04:41.280> they<00:04:41.580> are<00:04:41.880> holding<00:04:42.180> in<00:04:42.479> the<00:04:42.570> tail

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810 
and if they are holding in the tail

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:45.890 
and if they are holding in the tail
waters<00:04:43.199> of<00:04:43.380> course

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:52.439 

it'll<00:04:46.900> be<00:04:47.340> back<00:04:48.340> along<00:04:48.669> this<00:04:48.849> side<00:04:51.330> on<00:04:52.330> the

00:04:52.439 --> 00:04:52.449 
it'll be back along this side on the

00:04:52.449 --> 00:05:02.309 
it'll be back along this side on the
other<00:04:52.479> side<00:04:52.780> of<00:04:52.900> that<00:04:53.050> dirt<00:04:53.289> hill<00:05:01.110> so<00:05:02.110> there's

00:05:02.309 --> 00:05:02.319 
other side of that dirt hill so there's

00:05:02.319 --> 00:05:04.350 
other side of that dirt hill so there's
just<00:05:02.379> a<00:05:02.620> little<00:05:02.860> video<00:05:03.039> describing<00:05:03.789> bridges

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:04.360 
just a little video describing bridges

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.600 
just a little video describing bridges
like<00:05:05.289> I<00:05:05.409> said<00:05:05.620> they're<00:05:05.800> very<00:05:05.830> similar<00:05:06.279> to<00:05:06.520> the

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:06.610 
like I said they're very similar to the

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:11.249 
like I said they're very similar to the
log<00:05:06.819> jams<00:05:07.150> if<00:05:08.020> you<00:05:08.800> find<00:05:09.159> a<00:05:09.779> pillar<00:05:10.779> like<00:05:10.900> this

00:05:11.249 --> 00:05:11.259 
log jams if you find a pillar like this

00:05:11.259 --> 00:05:15.899 
log jams if you find a pillar like this
that<00:05:11.560> has<00:05:12.060> logs<00:05:13.060> is<00:05:13.449> brush<00:05:14.430> pile<00:05:15.430> up<00:05:15.669> in<00:05:15.789> the

00:05:15.899 --> 00:05:15.909 
that has logs is brush pile up in the

00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:18.029 
that has logs is brush pile up in the
front<00:05:16.150> of<00:05:16.240> it<00:05:16.360> all<00:05:16.599> the<00:05:16.779> better<00:05:16.990> is<00:05:17.199> just<00:05:17.529> give

00:05:18.029 --> 00:05:18.039 
front of it all the better is just give

00:05:18.039 --> 00:05:20.939 
front of it all the better is just give
the<00:05:18.400> fish<00:05:19.270> a<00:05:19.300> better<00:05:19.689> place<00:05:19.960> to<00:05:20.139> hide<00:05:20.319> more
