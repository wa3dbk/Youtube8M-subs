00:02:20.899 --> 00:02:20.909 
the same computer if so we don't need to

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:22.369 
the same computer if so we don't need to
make<00:02:21.120> what's<00:02:21.480> called<00:02:21.599> a<00:02:21.870> self-contained

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:22.379

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:24.299 
movie we can make what's called a

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:26.720

reference<00:02:24.810> file<00:02:25.079> a<00:02:25.349> reference<00:02:26.189> file<00:02:26.430> is<00:02:26.700> a

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
reference file a reference file is a

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.690 
reference file a reference file is a
smaller<00:02:27.239> QuickTime<00:02:27.930> but<00:02:28.769> it<00:02:28.860> refers<00:02:29.250> back<00:02:29.640> to

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
smaller QuickTime but it refers back to

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.149

00:02:32.149 --> 00:02:32.159 
the master media so what that means is

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:33.259 
the master media so what that means is
is<00:02:32.310> this<00:02:32.459> QuickTime<00:02:32.879> that<00:02:33.030> we're<00:02:33.120> going<00:02:33.209> to
