00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:40.729 
just to leave them and let them sell on
their<00:00:39.629> own<00:00:39.780> you<00:00:39.899> don't<00:00:40.020> have<00:00:40.140> to<00:00:40.260> bother<00:00:40.410> re

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
their own you don't have to bother re

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:41.750 
their own you don't have to bother re
listening<00:00:40.920> them<00:00:41.190> over<00:00:41.399> and<00:00:41.489> over<00:00:41.550> again

listening them over and over again

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.119 
listening them over and over again
obviously<00:00:42.480> relisting<00:00:43.050> is<00:00:43.230> a<00:00:43.530> much<00:00:43.739> better<00:00:43.770> way

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
obviously relisting is a much better way
