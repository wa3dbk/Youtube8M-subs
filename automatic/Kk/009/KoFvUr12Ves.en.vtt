 rwm tour we start with the 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.710
 Attractions in the leisure park 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.710
 located and located on the beach 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.809
 from los santos the attraction was there 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.969
 although previously in online mode but 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.550
 you could not use them and not 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.809
 drive with them that was only offline 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.850
 Mode possible 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.250
 for example, you can now for ten 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.140
 dollar the roller coaster use what a 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.629
 Pretty cool thing is even more man 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.670
 So many friends are sitting inside 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.969
 by pressing the rectangle on the 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.920
 playstation 3 or the x-th on the xbox 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.210
 hands upward lift the can 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.859
 if you were with the eighth after 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.710
 otherwise below, you can also 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.760
 Change perspective and camera view 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.890
 like me in the background 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.380
 done and that's how it comes in any case 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.939
 even better feeling on the second and 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.650
 last attraction which one now also in the 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.020
 online must be able to start that's it 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.280
 I do not like Ferris wheel personally 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.470
 I think it's a bit lax 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.780
 just slowly from the bottom up and 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.549
 is not my thing again but down 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.020
 who likes that can get up there 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.150
 every case has to reinsetzen on each 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.290
 a good view over the sea 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.290
 and about the city 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:41.970
 in the area of masts you in this 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.100
 You can buy masks loading again 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.990
 new animal masks appeared as already at 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.860
 previous dlc was the case 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:52.590
 there we have who the bison and 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.420
 We also have the bull 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.240
 In addition, the eagle simply comes 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:00.090
 The vulture looks really cool and too 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.830
 Last but not least, we also have the wolf 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.670
 and all you can do in two different ways 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:07.649
 Buy colors in the clothing stores 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.910
 Now you can find new tops and new ones 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:12.959
 pants the us american patriotism 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.260
 should emphasize and that too 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:15.300
 do 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.410
 the only thing that convinces me is that 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.000
 the best ones we have now in the background 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.650
 I think that's cool 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.510
 the rest does not really have me now 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:26.220
 to go from the stool to the last resort 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.170
 We still in the hair salon and look 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.450
 the new hairstyle to this is the vokuhila 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.670
 you can see the hair in the back long front 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.500
 a little shorter what's from this video 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.850
 I'll like it 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.890

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:40.310
