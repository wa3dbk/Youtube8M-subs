00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.100 
available
so<00:00:47.340> the<00:00:47.489> diesel<00:00:47.879> so<00:00:48.360> lots<00:00:48.719> of<00:00:48.870> torque

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
so the diesel so lots of torque

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.720 
so the diesel so lots of torque
obviously<00:00:49.530> off<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:49.739> lines<00:00:49.920> of<00:00:50.160> 3.2<00:00:50.700> liter

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
obviously off the lines of 3.2 liter

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.070 
obviously off the lines of 3.2 liter
inline<00:00:51.239> 5

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:54.080 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.750 

move<00:00:55.080> along<00:00:55.290> through<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:56.190> chorus<00:00:56.490> pretty

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
move along through the chorus pretty

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.570 
move along through the chorus pretty
eagerly<00:00:57.800> right<00:00:58.800> off<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.040> bat<00:00:59.190> around<00:00:59.460> the

00:00:59.570 --> 00:00:59.580 
eagerly right off the bat around the

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:03.800 
eagerly right off the bat around the
corners<00:01:01.850> it<00:01:02.850> does<00:01:03.090> see<00:01:03.270> if<00:01:03.390> it<00:01:03.480> doesn't<00:01:03.690> seem

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:03.810 
corners it does see if it doesn't seem

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:06.080 
corners it does see if it doesn't seem
to<00:01:03.900> have<00:01:04.020> a<00:01:04.290> little<00:01:04.770> bit<00:01:04.949> more<00:01:05.250> softness<00:01:05.700> in<00:01:06.000> a

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
to have a little bit more softness in a

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.610 
to have a little bit more softness in a
suspension<00:01:07.010> which<00:01:08.870> which<00:01:09.870> is<00:01:10.020> surprising

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:10.620 
suspension which which is surprising

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:12.770 
suspension which which is surprising
because<00:01:10.770> it<00:01:11.100> is<00:01:11.220> so<00:01:11.400> much<00:01:11.550> taller<00:01:11.850> and<00:01:12.479> I<00:01:12.570> think

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
because it is so much taller and I think

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.450 
because it is so much taller and I think
that<00:01:12.900> this<00:01:13.080> model<00:01:13.320> is<00:01:13.530> just<00:01:13.680> just<00:01:14.160> simply<00:01:14.430> a

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
that this model is just just simply a

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.420 
that this model is just just simply a
lot<00:01:14.700> bigger<00:01:14.940> and<00:01:15.240> heavier<00:01:15.890> the<00:01:16.890> nose<00:01:17.100> feels

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
lot bigger and heavier the nose feels

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.700 
lot bigger and heavier the nose feels
feels<00:01:18.000> heavier<00:01:18.479> but<00:01:18.780> still<00:01:19.080> accurate

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
feels heavier but still accurate

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.650 
feels heavier but still accurate
definitely<00:01:20.430> not<00:01:20.550> as<00:01:20.670> sporty<00:01:21.000> as<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.270> low<00:01:21.420> roof

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:21.660 
definitely not as sporty as the low roof

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:25.999 
definitely not as sporty as the low roof
gasoline<00:01:23.390> EcoBoost<00:01:24.390> but<00:01:25.229> you<00:01:25.530> know<00:01:25.680> still

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
gasoline EcoBoost but you know still

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.640 
gasoline EcoBoost but you know still
pretty<00:01:26.250> good<00:01:26.570> so<00:01:27.570> pretty<00:01:27.840> good<00:01:27.869> for<00:01:28.170> a<00:01:28.200> giant

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
pretty good so pretty good for a giant

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.180 
pretty good so pretty good for a giant
fan<00:01:28.860> I'd<00:01:29.670> say<00:01:29.880> a<00:01:29.910> lot<00:01:30.150> more<00:01:30.390> of<00:01:30.540> a<00:01:30.860> lot<00:01:31.860> more<00:01:32.040> the

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:32.190 
fan I'd say a lot more of a lot more the

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:34.430

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:34.440 
big band handling handling that you

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.910 
big band handling handling that you
might<00:01:34.619> might<00:01:35.460> expect<00:01:35.850> versus<00:01:36.300> the<00:01:36.920> the
