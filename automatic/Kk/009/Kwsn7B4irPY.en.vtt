00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:11.370
 so the g2 that will come out around the 20th 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:15.059
 September in France so this is the 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:17.220
 continuity of lg in the smartphone 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.960
 it's a pretty revolutionary product 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.160
 so 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.160
 beyond all the features 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.289
 techniques is first of all optimization 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.149
 of his slab and we see in relation to a 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.929
 clutter of one of its competitors 

00:00:27.149 --> 00:00:33.090
 it leaves a very large part on the screen 

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:37.680
 since we managed to put a screen 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.860
 5 points 2 with and that's also the 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.450
 change 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:43.900
 on this product there is at most no 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:45.730
 button on the sides since for a 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:49.270
 best use be right and its 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:51.970
 left and we decided to leave all 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:55.300
 the photoshoot volume access buttons 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:58.180
 here which allows with your finger 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:00.190
 when you call or when in 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.000
 left-handed or right-handed to be able to access 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.550
 all the features 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.680
 so it's a real revolution for 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:08.780
 the user 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.729
 it really makes a lot more 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:14.150
 to have easy access without having to 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:14.479
 break your communication and not changed 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.600
 brand 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:18.950
 that's really the big plus in term 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.140
 of use and the first returns 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.030
 customers we have had users who have 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.259
 that they have in their hands a certain 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.170
 journalist is that it's still 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:30.500
 very much appreciated beyond that the product 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:32.690
 there too we wanted to make a product that 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.220
 allows from this use all the 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:38.000
 day and very long way 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:40.100
 so it's a 3000 millan father 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.660
 there too we are sure of the very long 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.760
 duration which is fundamental because 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:46.160
 when using a product of this type 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:49.810
 with all that makes it possible to do in 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:51.820
 audio and video on the internet 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.170
 the capacity of the battery is 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.640
 fundamental they must be able to 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.560
 last all day long 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.009
 so we have these features it's a 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:02.399
 product which is also in terms 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:05.280
 cameras or camcorders 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:09.429
 on powerful we have a stabilizer 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.989
 that really helps to keep a very 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:12.970
 good picture quality is not having any 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:15.610
 under in every sense we also have the 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.840
 ability to choose where the focus 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.190
 are because often when we're in 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.220
 a noisy environment 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.870
 we can center and choose relaxes from 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.630
 micro so focused on this or that 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.530
 person and avoid the noise around 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.670
 we have a number of 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.440
 features of course every 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.610
 functions that style we know and 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.740
 that we had already developed on the jets 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:35.230
 which are shipped with a quality 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:37.540
 unmatched sound more today we 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.820
 says it's the product that allows 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.360
 to have the best rendering in terms of 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:42.820
 sound quality 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.960
 I think it's a very beautiful 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:46.460
 production 

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:49.040
 quick 

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:51.460
 autonomous that will seduce a lot of 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.460
 consumers
