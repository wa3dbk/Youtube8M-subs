00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.660
 2014 was the year of the World Cup and it was a 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.330
 year of incredible releases we saw 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:12.299
 mayist we saw superfly we saw prime it 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.530
 but personally I launch that 

00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:15.470
 the most interesting thing was the 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.070
 launch of the new pu power of bo power 

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:18.689
 apparently it was not a note that 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.070
 It gets a lot of attention until I tried it 

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:22.140
 in play a game of hit the ball 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.730
 with her and notice that feeling of effect 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.259
 elastic every time we hit the ball 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.400
 and that really helped me 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:28.800
 implement it 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.080
 perfectly hit me just one year 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.460
 then cougar launches the new generation 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.170
 of evo power we are going to make a small 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.390
 comparative between the first generation 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.070
 and the new generation so we can see what 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:43.140
 that keeps the old boot and what 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:44.790
 improvement in the new entry model what 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.170
 most important of this boot and that it 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:47.940
 keeps as is from the previous 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.950
 generation to the new one is the material of 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.630
 the housing the external material is a 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.640
 material that is called tablita what 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:54.720
 we can see written on both boots and that 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.850
 what will allow is that when 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.590
 hit the ball will generate an effect 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.240
 elastic without anything from a racket 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.770
 tennis or a golf club that 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:03.960
 transmit directly to the ball and 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.909
 so let's get all the power 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.920
 that we can to our beating in that 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.000
 characterizes this material as it is a 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.720
 designed material 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.310
 by cougar they do not have exclusive that is 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:16.410
 elastic in the longitudinal direction of this 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.600
 way we can get the boot 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:21.030
 Stretch and flex but totally 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.590
 rigid in a transversal sense therefore 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.600
 when we put on the boot not having 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.240
 no discomfort that the drop and the foot 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.700
 the material is formed slack 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.619
 to the elite is the principal the main 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.690
 element of this smoked power that is a 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.210
 difference from last year's video to the 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:37.860
 current list as you can see is a 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.510
 very bright material be a material 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.250
 aesthetically beautiful but had a 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:43.890
 problem when the ball or the boot 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.750
 they were wet it was annoying 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.970
 landslides when hitting to make a 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.340
 control make a pass with the effect this 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.060
 it's detrimental to the footballer 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.979
 quickly pumas has been put to 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.990
 work and has totally changed the 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.789
 admits the external appearance of the hdad 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.350
 this year's leader contributing in this 

00:01:56.789 --> 00:02:00.000
 technology grip text that is not 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.950
 only in these areas that we see in 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.039
 pink but throughout the housing 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:07.619
 same flexion and rigidity properties 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:10.380
 in the sense that we generate tension 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.820
 however the appearance is totally 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:14.780
 different and the contact with the ball is 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:14.780
 totally different 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:21.080
 second evolution of the new generation 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.790
 of puma bo power the beating was very good 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.010
 thanks to the energy the cia that the boot 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.450
 it generated the weight was very low but pupa 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.830
 I needed to give a bigger arm to this 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.200
 boot remember that it is not a boot of 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.750
 speed is a striking boot like 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.940
 got thus creating an internal month 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.910
 We can see here that it has small 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:40.790
 cells with air that does not increase at all 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:42.829
 the weight of the boot does not change at all 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.329
 the sensations but if you get a 

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:46.790
 extra armed we can see that this 

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:48.980
 mesh is placed glued in the area 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.390
 internal of the casing of this 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.459
 way without there being variation of weight 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:54.620
 then we will get a higher 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:56.180
 armed since the previous generation of 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:59.410
 hbo power did not have this mesh but 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.410
 had a conventional tissue 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.629
 third modification the height and the 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:05.920
 fluffy heel players 

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:07.810
 they said that the boot a little low 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.760
 then for that second generation it 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:11.890
 has increased the height of the area 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.260
 tied was a very light modification 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:17.379
 but above all in the inner zone you will be 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.819
 has put more padding so that the 

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:21.780
 Achilles tendon protection is 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:21.780
 much more effective 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:26.270
 The sole is the only common element that 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:28.760
 maintains between the previous generation of 

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:30.380
 evo power and the current the gradual 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.000
 stability frame is totally 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:33.530
 essential in this boot the 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.910
 players were delighted with him for 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:37.480
 so much puma has not done any kind of 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:37.480
 modification 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:42.900
 we ended up talking about the weight added 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.370
 new things to the new power they us 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.299
 guarantee that the weight has been reduced 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.219
 with respect to the previous generation 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:49.409
 let's check it with our scale 

00:03:47.219 --> 00:03:52.579
 of precision old generation of evo 

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:55.200
 power in size 8 and half mouth 209 grams 

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:57.469
 same size of the new generation itself 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.469
 sole 

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:01.600
 200 grams exact the reduction is 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.920
 minimal but it 's important above all 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:06.190
 knowing that they have added new 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:07.150
 technologies to the boot and to know the 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:09.340
 differences between the two generations 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:11.020
 of evo power the first generation that 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:12.040
 falls in love with professional footballers and 

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:13.840
 which has gained a market share 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.209
 incredible among amateur footballers 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:18.070
 and basic and now I encourage all of you to 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:19.600
 try the new generation of cougars or 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:20.560
 power I still can not use it in a 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.270
 soccer field 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.500
 I'm looking forward to doing it and to you 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.850
 I encourage you to try any of the 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.380
 two both the first generation that 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:28.570
 now we have it in offer 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:30.010
 singlecomers dotcom like any of 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:35.010
 the new generations that are coming out 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:35.010
 of the new foam evo power 1.2
