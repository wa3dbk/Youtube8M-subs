00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:25.810
 we 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.970
 and we have a study firm so who is 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.730
 that they had checked our facilities 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:40.830
 it turns out that the skatepark was 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.080
 more to standards and that in case of 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:44.520
 problem and accident the responsibility 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:46.260
 the municipality could engage or that 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.770
 in the rush has withdrawn 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.840
 the old skate park and the idea came 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:55.170
 to come back directly to young people 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.910
 users to see the effect that there 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.010
 had gone there they had had the 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.660
 dismantling of this skatepark and it is 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.710
 find that we do not even have the time to 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.420
 take the approach with young people 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.790
 it's young people on the approach of the 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.990
 common initiative could build 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.580
 at the skatepark she had been taking a 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.250
 gap on michelle and me when we were 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.470
 still in its entirety but the idea we 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.120
 came that we could no longer ride 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.729
 everything to the sango one is obliged to 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:19.860
 move we were a little fed up and 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.619
 suddenly we sent a letter to 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.890
 fofana tone but when she this report has 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.720
 been demolished the young people it is badly reacted it 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.820
 really has them more they can 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.720
 more practice their sport 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.910
 and 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.090
 we were a little upset about the 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:39.780
 town hall early we had not asked for anything 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:47.250
 but by the way, who demolishes them 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:49.140
 of the entire project kg m already it's through 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.820
 relate to their motivation when they are 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.920
 come to claim to the mayor and not 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.980
 not including the demolition that were 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.270
 due to security checks but also 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:59.670
 we saw that they were starting to 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.890
 to involve participative democracy 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.300
 we have already done a lot in loos 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.800
 gohelle but do it with young people 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:09.470
 who were between 11 and 14 years old 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:11.970
 frankly it was her 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.870
 really a plus for the city the 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.760
 common losse still has a 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.970
 know-how on all these questions 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.790
 application of 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:22.130
 of inhabitants' participation and on this 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:24.140
 type of citizen solicitations 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.720
 the idea is to accompany and see 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:29.270
 to what extent can we apply the 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.340
 young people on a subject and allow them 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:38.540
 to better understand the challenges of 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:40.220
 territory through the networks 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.950
 social organize meetings 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:45.690
 where young people have 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:48.390
 answered this and 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:51.210
 we thought together about how 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.020
 could consider setting up a 

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:54.900
 new skatepark 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:56.640
 so they came up with plans they 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.680
 have thought about a design that could 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.680
 to best suit them according to their level 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.300
 of practice we had made visits 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.640
 on shows from vendin-le-old at 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:09.510
 made of her then I believe 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:11.400
 grenet and we had modeled with a 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.110
 software on the internet that we found 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.700
 on a title and modules we have them 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:16.740
 chosen in relation to the disciples in 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:20.670
 the point that no longer crossed skateboard 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:22.320
 and koller freeboxes that were short 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:25.340
 often it was for the quattro their 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:29.280
 master week plans that were 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:30.840
 really studied and submitted precisely to 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.670
 different manufacturers we had 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.990
 asked to try to stick the most 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:35.940
 near at the request of young people actually 

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:38.340
 so initially there were four modules 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:40.290
 on a skate park and the will was 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:43.300
 really to have a bigger space 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:45.180
 practice therefore 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:47.440
 the city stadium had also been 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:50.200
 dismantled actually because he was coming 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.880
 also at the end of life so suddenly it has 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.950
 allowed also a little to have a plus 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.660
 large space and therefore power too 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:58.720
 consider an hour of practice a lot 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:00.640
 more consistent so far also 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:03.610
 account in front of a much larger audience 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.960
 off precisely because of the youth 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:07.030
 younger people come from cities 

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:07.480
 nearby or even the metropolis 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:10.780
 Lille 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:12.460
 if alone in his office the elected representatives 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.620
 technicians in the city make a choice 

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:17.859
 which can even be very relevant hyper 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:19.420
 worked with could naively by 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:20.980
 example a study office on the 

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:22.210
 designing a skatepark if we had it 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:25.110
 done in a traditional way we would have 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:27.670
 definitely pulled out an interesting space 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.810
 but for example we might not have 

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:29.890
 not seen that there were different 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:32.740
 practices that would not have been answered 

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:35.140
 for example the bmice activity that is 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:37.560
 actually very strong in terms of 

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:41.560
 therefore asks the final goal for me to 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:44.380
 the application that really interest 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:46.270
 principal is to qualify the implementation 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:48.340
 implementation of a public policy and there in 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:51.310
 the occurrence was qualified the implementation 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:53.260
 place of public equipment for for 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:54.940
 young people from the moment we 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:58.670
 gets to put people there stands 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:05:01.190
 so put your finger in a subject 

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:02.750
 of the territory there is a whole process 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:04.310
 is going on with them so you have to 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:06.560
 to participate in laws it is necessary to exchange 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:08.870
 with others, it creates a bond 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:11.440
 sacred too of sacred trust and 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:13.880
 especially also a common experience and 

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:16.220
 it creates a collective skill 

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:21.650
 since we shared some 

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:23.720
 thing and we took out an object and suddenly 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:24.860
 I think that afterwards it was 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:25.370
 realizes it to many 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:27.830
 occasions 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:30.050
 that allows the person who has a 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:31.580
 successful experience of this type there is a 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:33.569
 little more involved a little more 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:34.860
 accountable 

00:05:33.569 --> 00:05:37.889
 in the life of his commune so 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:40.259
 general we really have a nice example of 

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:42.330
 participatory democracy since since 

00:05:40.259 --> 00:05:44.699
 the project started effectively by 

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:46.469
 the fact that they proposed plans 

00:05:44.699 --> 00:05:49.129
 that they have tried to find 

00:05:46.469 --> 00:05:52.499
 alternatives to the receipts we were able to 

00:05:49.129 --> 00:05:54.929
 to express to them about us in particular 

00:05:52.499 --> 00:05:56.909
 budgetary restrictions or 

00:05:54.929 --> 00:05:59.189
 precisely the safety standards that he 

00:05:56.909 --> 00:06:02.279
 had to respect their application is 

00:05:59.189 --> 00:06:04.139
 always present actually the project 

00:06:02.279 --> 00:06:05.520
 especially francs the fortnight of 

00:06:04.139 --> 00:06:08.099
 young people who is really the one applied 

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:08.779
 from the beginning until today is always 

00:06:08.099 --> 00:06:12.240
 constant 

00:06:08.779 --> 00:06:13.080
 they are they are really present on 

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.969
 the skatepark 

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:17.099
 he also invites young people to respect 

00:06:14.969 --> 00:06:18.809
 the places so that's a job is 

00:06:17.099 --> 00:06:20.159
 now every day for in 

00:06:18.809 --> 00:06:22.409
 does the fact that it's between 

00:06:20.159 --> 00:06:24.539
 quotes their projects they are 

00:06:22.409 --> 00:06:27.830
 born there would be more spectrum and he 

00:06:24.539 --> 00:06:27.830
 must also respect more
