00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.660
 hi I had constancy and excessive 

00:00:02.479 --> 00:00:09.559
 download video 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:11.840
 That's right, this time I bring you the version 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:15.340
 Newest from minecraft pocket edition 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.340
 20 points 7.6 

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:21.330
 what I have here 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:24.060
 this thing that have not changed at all 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.580
 I do not see anything, nothing good has been in 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.289
 the thing 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:30.560
 it is supposed that this update was going to 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:33.930
 be very small only as they saw 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:36.000
 nothing else had appeared play 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.150
 and nothing was going to be a very update 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.730
 small for 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:43.450
 fix some books ebooks of the 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:43.450
 play in reims 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:50.390
 there was a bug yes 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:52.370
 I do not know if they have seen it or I imagine that 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.990
 those who have had the opportunity to 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:58.610
 enter the beach servers dreams 

00:00:55.990 --> 00:01:01.910
 there was a bug that when you entered 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:05.730
 of zorite and that track metal when 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:07.530
 They focused on my country 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:09.300
 no then you could not open anything we 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:13.060
 they could open the chests and you could not 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:15.189
 enter the ovens 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.439
 and they fixed it right now and to 

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:19.329
 enter the chests necessarily 

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:21.630
 we have to have something in the inventory 

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:21.630
 down here 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:28.180
 for example a peak we can already open the 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:29.740
 oven there was a ship I do not know if it still 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.910
 keep going I'll try that when 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.910
 we squeeze the d 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:40.960
 this here is the chat button 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:43.750
 well it still follows that it opens in the 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:46.170
 kilns good whatever they're pointing at 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:48.780
 this case to see the oven 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.939
 well do not open it did not kill it they have 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.549
 given that vessel those of moya 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:56.310
 but one is a little bit weird they have not 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.830
 added nothing nothing new nothing else have 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.810
 changed what is the look of the menu 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:02.869
 in fact now 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.380
 if you are not going to look like this part 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:06.700
 example here 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.399
 log out 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:11.860
 it's going to look like it says nothing 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:17.030
 more and good to enter we have had 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:20.450
 tilt it jing and enter with your account 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:23.190
 of mojang because there are two accounts is the 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:25.440
 of minecraft and the dock 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:28.130
 in this case I will put 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.130
 appear blur 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:36.630
 so they do not see my data 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:39.980
 and well that's all they have added 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.980
 that time to type 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.050
 now my password 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.870
 what is my password 1 2 3 4 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:05.400
 let's see if the tub my password 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:06.959
 well it disappeared when you 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.940
 come in and you're going to seem to work 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:11.700
 in player game and it will look like 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:13.270
 to enter there I tell them that they have not 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:16.150
 put nothing 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:18.600
 and here you can see here I have my world in 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.600
 creative 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:26.760
 and good as I tell you they have not put 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:30.090
 nothing is at all the clouds the sun the 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:33.209
 Shadows all of xove in the inventory 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:35.830

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:37.360

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:40.030

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:49.180
 there is what to be able to activate this thing 

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:50.830

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:53.440
