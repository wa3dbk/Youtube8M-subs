 preparation review from sony nex perezat we 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.840
 with eugeny decided to demonstrate 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.269
 speed shooting mode is separately

 He has a full review process 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:24.119
 so now I will show you how it is 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.510
 works as it is implemented by one 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:34.380
 the phone will start a timer do this 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:37.290
 as follows 1 will be the starting point 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.110
 here we will have the main phone 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:44.160
 choose mode 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:46.940
 a series as you know and shooting is possible with 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:50.820
 9 megapixels maximum quality 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:53.610
 second more than 9 frames of activity from 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.649
 resolutions you can choose high 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.440
 low resolution medium speed 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.840
 speed with medium resolution and low 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:05.480
 maximum resolution speed let's 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.480
 first try at high speed 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.570
 simultaneously put 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:32.159
 how many frames a minute we get 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:36.869
 make at the maximum minimum 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:39.290
 speed resolution of 280 us is what 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.290
 points 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:53.650
 like this a little bit yes it's from this 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:59.110
 xperia z can you and boss 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:02:02.010
 not the channel itself by virtue of me even so 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.010
 soon consider 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:22.090
 and that we have 877 photos 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:25.550
 per minute then there are almost 900 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:27.680
 the result is impressive let's 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:31.160
 look at the highest quality you have 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:33.140
 get to make such a minute average 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.600
 look not going to sense from mosul this 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:38.410
 no for clarity enough and 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.410
 such a regime 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:06.850
 slower work is already needed here 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:06.850
 shutter 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:51.280
 yet we've got 237 photos 

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:56.860
 additionally they are all good quality 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:04:01.560
 you can see such an interesting mode 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:01.560
 with red shooting in good quality 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:08.760
 high speed that not a single moment 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:13.900
 interesting your life will not be missed
