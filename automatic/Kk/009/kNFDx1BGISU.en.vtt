00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:14.450
 we are here together because I am going to do 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:17.119
 another excursion to the hairdresser and to the 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:18.920
 hairdresser I exposed myself to the claws of 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:22.010
 hairdressers a couple of weeks ago and the 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:24.439
 result was not the one I wanted not to 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:26.240
 nothing but because it turns out that in the end I 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:29.060
 I realized that I was looking for another 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:31.820

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:37.370

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:38.480

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.610
 seconds undo the wicks 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.800
