00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.889
 the rest do and that the location for short cooking is the varsity fever points 

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:07.819
 reports used code fc youth 5 for 5 percent discount and you have the fever 

00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:09.419
 stand together within a minute 

00:00:09.419 --> 00:00:12.919
 because gastel is welcome with new delivery of network products 

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:16.539
 delivering the backside the previous episode where we stayed at the gold 

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:20.430
 cup that we will continue to play we are now in the quarterfinals and 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:21.680
 come against this team 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:26.160
 not at the throat impressive he has a few also ex players where they know 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.300
 That 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.220
 not very much on the good side 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.040
 We get in the lead quite early in the race and then a thousand and 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.280
 hit the ball once and shoot it in the short corner 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.810
 and if you want and prevent around 10 

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:42.109
 and you score again very quickly the 0 2 with false device flew 

00:00:42.109 --> 00:00:43.280
 you actually know 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:44.640
 that it will be okay 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.050
 and so far, inkeld cup is so bad, I honestly had more 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.170
 Expect it all the way if you check in the first match we have with 4 3 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.879
 had won 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:54.820
 as you may still be in it from the previous episode 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:58.380
 normally if you continue in such a tournament you also think a construction site 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:02.140
 it now only gets harder but we score the 4 0 here after a best 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.080
 nice number with sun 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.340
 m that is also 5 0 when our korean king heard shoot at the goalkeeper 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.210
 keeper tenable adi had on behalf of the state for the rebound 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.720
 and that always happens what I have very often when I am in front then I start one 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.540
 pay attention and then I am halfway typing something on skype 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:19.799
 watch YouTube video 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.219
 why the opponent scores but it basically doesn't matter anymore 

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:26.270
 The great thing about this match is that there are five goals scored all 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.149
 another player all in our midfielders on attackers 

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:31.740
 and we already know in the semi-final 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.910
 after we light what we have had in mind and contacts come against this 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.750
 premium team and when I see a premium team with 3 5 2 formation I am always 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.740
 stay no matter if it is another team after a 3 5 2 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.180
 always stay locally 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.560
 Few people 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.530
 They have the misery and the RM fought the most important positions 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.369
 in a 3 5 7 they have a defensive player who is almost standing 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:58.070
 no one if you do not become young expo especially if you are against one 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:01.600
 team comes like mine with the three attackers and he has three 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.909
 Defenders then it just stands three out of three when you are tilting at it 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.090
 you can't stop three attacks with three defenders then you just come 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.360
 easily through a strong opponent and the good he scores wins 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.330
 2 2 with good walking there m at that time I also thought something must go 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.719
 change the vendor's business brought in for cake 

00:02:18.719 --> 00:02:20.210
 because coupe did nothing for me 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:23.379
 short-lived 2 3 juices in the courtroom 

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:26.859
 and my opponent who gets a dumb about trying out what I am 

00:02:26.859 --> 00:02:27.689
 so just described 

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:28.999
 to stop 

00:02:28.999 --> 00:02:32.149
 it has to get a second yellow card on which becomes mandala 

00:02:32.149 --> 00:02:36.500
 the amount is sent and if you only have two defenders left 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.250
 You have to focus entirely on your defense strengthened instead of 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.270
 attacker remains is 2 3 there are actually very confident that final 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:47.419
 boiled down regardless of winning or losing the final 

00:02:47.419 --> 00:02:50.349
 I think after this I will continue with divisions 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:55.440
 and that is because we have now done that cup, I just want that off the list 

00:02:55.439 --> 00:02:59.180
 with things that are nice to show you in that division 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.049
 nevertheless remains to get more because you calculated so you play four 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:06.950
 competitions in the tournament you get 2000 composer and you get a package 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:09.929
 with a little last year was at least average 

00:03:09.929 --> 00:03:13.719
 the second package for 1000 crusts of carte so you don't get if you win 

00:03:13.719 --> 00:03:14.780
 executed 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:18.080
 then you have to play four gates for each game against 5 of the corps in between 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.690
 the end 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:23.640
 you have four times five hundred columns and count 3000 fever is around 5,000 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:24.130
 columns 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.069
 for playing the kitchen 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:29.979
 four games that is quite reasonable, but in divisions there is often more to it 

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:32.979
 and that is because we are in the lower divisions anyway 

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:37.959
 yes we can certainly say ok we are going to get a PhD where get those bonuses 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:40.729
 keep the profit from winning the cup 

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:43.809
 and in the tournament you know that I am not yesterday I have the carnival cup 

00:03:43.809 --> 00:03:45.059
 played the new tournament 

00:03:45.059 --> 00:03:47.469
 on the other hand what I also need enough 

00:03:47.469 --> 00:03:49.079
 because it is a turning point tonight 

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:51.539
 but I did that 

00:03:51.539 --> 00:03:55.159
 and once I also had florentina you played three games 

00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:57.719
 for nothing year for the Westdarenaren with van sint 

00:03:57.719 --> 00:03:58.290
 March procession 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:01.129
 but well you understand where I want you to be a three year old 

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:03.209
 score with opponent always caught 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:06.630
 and then it all looks very comfortable just now sun 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:08.620
 got a nice score once 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.970
 I have always not done I am a bit out of the rotation I notice 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:15.279
 myself being a little less levita and that is annoying 

00:04:15.279 --> 00:04:19.009
 who always wants to get better in the future evita m maybe so comes in that 

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:22.400
 as i like giving that i was ahead but my opponent better two 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.960
 goals scored the fourth first 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.730
 that was already too late because it was now the 90th minute 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:29.599
 he also had a red card again 

00:04:29.599 --> 00:04:31.370
 and that simply means that we 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:34.960
 have made the cup one earlier this year and that also means 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:39.280
 that we still have done nothing but won in this series 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:42.760
 percent weeks of discussions twice you do nothing about sochi in that 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:44.069
 delivery inspection 

00:04:44.069 --> 00:04:48.270
 and so we have now played something of 26 ears 5 the pots according to me 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:51.139
 we have not lost or drawn one 

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:54.840
 our bonus cycling team will be reinforced with what the next episode 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.129
 suggestions that you had left 

00:04:57.129 --> 00:05:01.229

 and then speak here all the next episode 

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.569
