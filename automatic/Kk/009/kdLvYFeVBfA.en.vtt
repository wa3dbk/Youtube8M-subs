00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:10.249 

I<00:00:08.300> can't<00:00:09.300> think<00:00:09.450> of<00:00:09.599> a<00:00:09.660> composer<00:00:10.019> of<00:00:10.139> his

00:00:10.249 --> 00:00:10.259 
I can't think of a composer of his

00:00:10.259 --> 00:00:13.009 
I can't think of a composer of his
generation<00:00:10.679> whose<00:00:11.490> music<00:00:11.849> is<00:00:11.969> so<00:00:12.540> eagerly

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
generation whose music is so eagerly

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.289 
generation whose music is so eagerly
awaited<00:00:13.530> by<00:00:14.070> so<00:00:14.309> many<00:00:14.490> people<00:00:14.849> in<00:00:15.000> so<00:00:15.179> many

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
awaited by so many people in so many

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:26.210 
awaited by so many people in so many
places<00:00:23.210> his<00:00:24.210> talent<00:00:24.599> for<00:00:24.660> making<00:00:25.380> sounds<00:00:26.189> that

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
places his talent for making sounds that

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.429 
places his talent for making sounds that
sound<00:00:26.640> completely<00:00:27.210> fresh<00:00:29.539> as<00:00:30.539> if<00:00:30.720> yeah<00:00:31.289> there

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
sound completely fresh as if yeah there

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.799 
sound completely fresh as if yeah there
was<00:00:31.529> waiting<00:00:32.009> to<00:00:32.189> make<00:00:32.369> these<00:00:32.550> sounds<00:00:32.820> and<00:00:33.300> had

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
was waiting to make these sounds and had

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.260 
was waiting to make these sounds and had
to<00:00:33.930> wait<00:00:34.110> 200<00:00:34.590> years<00:00:34.890> and<00:00:35.280> there<00:00:35.550> it's<00:00:35.969> allowed

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
to wait 200 years and there it's allowed

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.709 
to wait 200 years and there it's allowed
to<00:00:36.420> make<00:00:36.600> now<00:00:37.219> and<00:00:38.219> I<00:00:38.280> think<00:00:38.460> that's<00:00:38.640> very<00:00:38.910> rare

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
to make now and I think that's very rare

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.709 
to make now and I think that's very rare
certainly<00:00:40.050> rarely<00:00:40.469> young<00:00:40.739> composer<00:00:41.340> I<00:00:41.760> think

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
certainly rarely young composer I think

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.630 
certainly rarely young composer I think

something<00:06:32.169> very<00:06:32.729> raw<00:06:33.729> about<00:06:34.210> it<00:06:34.510> it's<00:06:34.780> the

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:35.110 
something very raw about it it's the

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:39.029 
something very raw about it it's the
most<00:06:35.789> naked<00:06:36.789> and<00:06:37.030> in<00:06:37.960> a<00:06:38.050> way<00:06:38.169> most<00:06:38.350> emotional

00:06:39.029 --> 00:06:39.039 
most naked and in a way most emotional

00:06:39.039 --> 00:06:41.040 
most naked and in a way most emotional
of<00:06:39.190> all<00:06:39.400> his<00:06:39.550> pieces<00:06:39.820> despite<00:06:40.600> the<00:06:40.780> fact<00:06:40.990> that

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:41.050 
of all his pieces despite the fact that

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:46.890 
of all his pieces despite the fact that
it's<00:06:41.289> like<00:06:41.470> a<00:06:41.710> huge<00:06:42.070> machine<00:06:45.419> somehow<00:06:46.419> I<00:06:46.630> think

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:46.900 
it's like a huge machine somehow I think

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:49.140 
it's like a huge machine somehow I think
it's<00:06:47.110> one<00:06:47.560> of<00:06:47.620> the<00:06:47.710> most<00:06:47.830> deeply<00:06:48.160> felt<00:06:48.610> pieces

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:49.150 
it's one of the most deeply felt pieces

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:54.999 
it's one of the most deeply felt pieces
that<00:06:49.479> he<00:06:49.660> wrote

00:06:54.999 --> 00:06:55.009 

00:06:55.009 --> 00:06:58.480 

I<00:06:55.869> think<00:06:56.869> that<00:06:57.169> audiences<00:06:57.319> will<00:06:57.919> continue<00:06:58.400> to

00:06:58.480 --> 00:06:58.490 
I think that audiences will continue to

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:00.790 
I think that audiences will continue to
find<00:06:58.699> new<00:06:58.789> things<00:06:58.909> in<00:06:59.300> his<00:06:59.509> work<00:06:59.719> for<00:07:00.559> many

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:00.800 
find new things in his work for many

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:02.499 
find new things in his work for many
many<00:07:01.069> years<00:07:01.159> to<00:07:01.400> come<00:07:01.669> and<00:07:01.909> I<00:07:01.939> think<00:07:01.969> he<00:07:02.330> will

00:07:02.499 --> 00:07:02.509 
many years to come and I think he will

00:07:02.509 --> 00:07:05.439 
many years to come and I think he will
be<00:07:02.569> one<00:07:02.839> of<00:07:02.900> the<00:07:03.139> survivors<00:07:04.069> when<00:07:04.550> we<00:07:04.699> when<00:07:05.330> the

00:07:05.439 --> 00:07:05.449 
be one of the survivors when we when the

00:07:05.449 --> 00:07:10.290 
be one of the survivors when we when the
tide<00:07:05.719> of<00:07:06.020> another<00:07:06.589> century<00:07:06.860> washes<00:07:07.789> out

00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:10.300 

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:16.839 

I'm<00:07:11.289> usually<00:07:11.699> exciting<00:07:12.699> event<00:07:13.210> this

00:07:16.839 --> 00:07:16.849 

00:07:16.849 --> 00:07:18.909
