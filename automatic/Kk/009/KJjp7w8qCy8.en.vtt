00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:05.639
 The study plan 

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:09.120
 dances communion 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:16.820
 hours 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:19.189
 they know breaking and night of the ground 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:21.079
 I bring, as in other cases, the controversy 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:23.480
 accompanies game and with gave order has been 

00:00:21.079 --> 00:00:24.860
 magnified to absurd points in 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.630
 Reality has always been about 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:28.160
 side of luxury performing 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:31.070
 adaptations of santa's licenses 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:33.620
 Monica or fast now with tools 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:34.900
 enough talent and audacity jump 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.730
 to the ring with this action adventure 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:39.739
 we have heard that if it lasts little if 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.150
 there are too many cinematic the question 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:43.250
 is that you have opted for a narrative 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:45.650
 risky totally cinematic 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.479
 with touches of shooter and a lot of quit 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:50.030
 there is a level that the player demands 

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:52.309
 degree of concentration in addition and this is 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.110
 something obvious enters through the eyes its 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:55.600
 technical section is overwhelmed and 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:58.820
 becomes the main claim 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:02.199
 then as a whole that such as 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.199
 let's find out in this video 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.140
 why 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:40.439
 that is my life and the strikes 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.030
 Sir Galahad and the order a series of 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.039
 gentlemen who watch over security 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.240
 Citizen something like a 

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:47.009
 adaptation of the legend of the 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.899
 knights of the round table but 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.420
 located in a Victorian london where 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:53.219
 Werewolves roam freely 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.140
 as you see an easy premise and a 

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:57.000
 the simple story where the secondary 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.100
 they have a lot of strength and in which each 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.390
 flat wants to tell something by leaning 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.000
 course in the extraordinary 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.920
 facial animations the mechanics do not 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.110
 they risk practically nothing being 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.489
 certainly very basic there is some 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.769
 minigame where for example we must 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:12.299
 open locks and another with which 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:15.090
 thanks to a contraption that gives us 

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:17.459
 we can melt test leads beyond 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.650
 of that good functional coverage 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:21.299
 impact detection and a targeted 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.280
 manual that can not be 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:24.690
 question anything 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.940
 these pinches of pure gameplay are 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.470
 interspersed with many scenes including 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.930
 there are whole chapters where the user 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.150
 it's a mere spectator there are collectables 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.160
 those and where we will listen to messages 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.650
 or even a song and dozens of 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.299
 newspapers photos and objects that we can 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.940
 observe to better understand the context 

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:43.920
 of the adventure in the shootings we have 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.030
 a unique characteristic as is a 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.130
 kind of time 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.350
 beyond this help that relieves when 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:52.110
 we are surrounded we stand out for good 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:54.240
 the weapons are not many but varied 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.400
 and originals with devastating effects on 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:58.200
 the bodies of the soldiers in others 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.090
 clashes as against men 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.220
 wolf we will not only have to hit shots 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.640
 but be careful to clavarles one 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.440
 dagger 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.180
 or directly confront us in another 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:09.000
 minigame where we demand speed of 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:11.550
 reaction in general the development of 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.770
 This title is 100% guided and there is hardly 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:15.300
 space for improvisation has been 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:17.280
 crushed a lot the subject of duration 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:19.110
 that is not so serious as it is 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.970
 shoots more than seven hours by little 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:23.519
 that we entertain but we believe that 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:25.290
 its main problem is not that the biggest 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:27.360
 hit we have found is the lack of 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:29.220
 ambition in the playable we miss 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.989
 a greater use of the universe 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.090
 that some puzzle has been created 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:35.700
 investigation that we can commit 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:37.319
 errors and that these are penalized and 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.060
 orders that kind of game that goes 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:41.730
 enthuse the one looking for a linear work 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.800
 of perfect execution does not risk for 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:45.840
 nothing and will not remember those games for a 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:47.819
 only playstation player two of the 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.440
 that go to the grain and that this time they merge 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:50.590
 the cinema with the video game so almost 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.050
 literal 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:55.180
 technically as you can see in the 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:57.220
 video is brilliant an authentic 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:59.140
 referent marks that turning point 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:01.540
 that justifies a new generation of 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:03.670
 consoles already did drive clap with a 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:05.459
 of your big updates and now 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:08.379
 the game of network and down goes one step further 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:10.209
 the scale the design the details the 

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:12.069
 lighting everything is taken care of to the fullest 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:14.860
 and it is a real delight for the 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:16.479
 player the same with the sound thanks to 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:18.010
 a great soundtrack by Jason 

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:20.859
 serious and a great dubbing the Castilian 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:23.030
 directed by Ã¡lex of the church touches what 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:26.990
 what do you want 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:28.430
 be careful and to conclude it is true 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:30.170
 that its playable mechanics are very 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:32.840
 basic that can be boring 

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:34.460
 insufficient for many players but 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:36.320
 we are facing a very solid product 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:38.210
 wants to offer an experience 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.620
 cinematographic and everything you try what 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:41.060
 it does well as the shooter parts 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:43.460
 where even a great 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:44.660
 artificial intelligence is surely 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.940
 a step back in terms of complexity 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:49.340
 but a turning point as a concept 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:52.120
 a game that you love or hate but that 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:52.120
 after all it is necessary 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.889
 to
