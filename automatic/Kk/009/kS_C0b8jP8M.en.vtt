the first what's one of the first steps

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:31.710 
the first what's one of the first steps
that<00:00:29.570> you<00:00:29.660> can<00:00:29.840> take<00:00:29.900> to<00:00:30.410> really<00:00:31.370> start

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:31.720 
that you can take to really start

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.160 
that you can take to really start
zeroing<00:00:32.720> in<00:00:32.930> and<00:00:33.640> I<00:00:34.690> started<00:00:35.690> thinking<00:00:36.050> about

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:36.170 
zeroing in and I started thinking about

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.950 
zeroing in and I started thinking about
it<00:00:36.410> and<00:00:36.560> there's<00:00:37.160> something<00:00:37.490> called<00:00:37.960> angel

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:38.960 
it and there's something called angel

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.910 
it and there's something called angel
numbers<00:00:39.320> I<00:00:39.530> work<00:00:40.190> with<00:00:40.400> angels<00:00:40.850> and<00:00:41.650> I<00:00:42.650> call

numbers I work with angels and I call

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.310 
numbers I work with angels and I call
them<00:00:43.070> trips<00:00:43.460> because<00:00:44.150> if<00:00:44.450> you<00:00:44.540> see<00:00:44.750> numbers<00:00:45.140> in

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:45.320 
them trips because if you see numbers in

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.560 
them trips because if you see numbers in
triplicate<00:00:45.890> and<00:00:46.100> sometimes<00:00:47.000> it<00:00:47.150> can<00:00:47.300> be<00:00:47.420> you

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:47.570 
triplicate and sometimes it can be you

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.650 
triplicate and sometimes it can be you
know<00:00:47.600> quads<00:00:47.989> where<00:00:48.230> you<00:00:48.320> go<00:00:48.470> 1<00:00:49.100> 1<00:00:49.280> 1<00:00:49.489> or<00:00:49.820> 2<00:00:50.210> 2<00:00:50.450> 2

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:50.660 
know quads where you go 1 1 1 or 2 2 2

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:55.000 
know quads where you go 1 1 1 or 2 2 2
or<00:00:51.730> maybe<00:00:52.730> it's<00:00:52.940> 11<00:00:53.300> 11<00:00:53.720> it<00:00:54.230> can<00:00:54.410> be<00:00:54.500> any<00:00:54.710> group

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010 
or maybe it's 11 11 it can be any group

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:56.650 
or maybe it's 11 11 it can be any group
of<00:00:55.190> numbers<00:00:55.340> but<00:00:55.610> if<00:00:55.700> you<00:00:55.790> see<00:00:55.970> simultaneous

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:56.660 
of numbers but if you see simultaneous

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.860 
of numbers but if you see simultaneous
numbers<00:00:56.989> that<00:00:57.140> is<00:00:57.410> a<00:00:57.440> key<00:00:58.210> that<00:00:59.210> the<00:00:59.329> angels

00:00:59.860 --> 00:00:59.870

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:01.730 
are around there are all different ways

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:03.940 
are around there are all different ways
for<00:01:01.970> the<00:01:02.030> angels<00:01:02.420> to<00:01:02.450> get<00:01:02.630> ahold<00:01:02.840> of<00:01:03.020> you<00:01:03.170> but

they don't pick up a phone and say hey
what's<00:01:05.299> going<00:01:05.569> on<00:01:06.369> one<00:01:07.369> of<00:01:07.399> the<00:01:07.549> best<00:01:07.789> ways<00:01:08.090> is

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:08.299 
what's going on one of the best ways is

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:11.590 
what's going on one of the best ways is
for<00:01:08.600> you<00:01:08.689> to<00:01:08.810> be<00:01:08.929> aware<00:01:09.259> and<00:01:09.880> when<00:01:10.880> you<00:01:11.060> see

for you to be aware and when you see
some<00:01:12.170> of<00:01:12.259> those<00:01:12.380> numbers<00:01:12.710> they<00:01:13.100> each<00:01:13.340> mean

00:01:13.779 --> 00:01:13.789 
some of those numbers they each mean

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:16.870 
some of those numbers they each mean
something<00:01:14.719> separate<00:01:15.709> but<00:01:16.459> just<00:01:16.700> know<00:01:16.850> that

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880
