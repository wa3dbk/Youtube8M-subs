00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.750
 Hello everyone and if you comment today 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:20.060
 that lures how the money goes by 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:21.920
 as quickly as possible and save it in 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.200
 your own profile without having to 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:27.439
 take out the guest how are we going to do 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:29.420
 this is good so let's get us the 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:31.100
 time bomb then when 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:34.160
 let's have the time pump the clock 

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:37.160
 of time we are going to address here to 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:39.830
 bank already I say you do not need guests 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.750
 only with a single player 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:45.170
 this can do so much in individual 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:47.390
 as doing it from the three players 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.860
 of four to pass money to you 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.410
 comrades then what are you going to 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:53.539
 carry out teaching and the bank with which 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.690
 I was saying and now you are going to take 

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:58.789
 your own money that I had saved 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:01.579
 then when you take out the money what 

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:04.129
 you leave six and then what are you going to 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:06.410
 to do is that you are going to put the pump 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:08.390
 time the time clock just when 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:10.430
 came and took the money then 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.140
 Now you are going to put the money you are going to 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.100
 save the money again then no 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.530
 you are losing that money 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:20.070
 and also with serves and I tell you so much in 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.810
 individual as in two players 34 for 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.479
 spend money your colleagues without 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.799
 lose your money and without needing 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.509
 take out the guest that is the most 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.960
 important of all then now you 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.780
 we give the clock of time 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.909
 we go back in time and what we 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.549
 we had saved and we no longer have 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:39.950
 back again or be perfect 

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:41.720
 then imagine if we do it in two 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.790
 players because I passed the money to me 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.860
 fellow he keeps it 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:47.509
 we give back in time and I go back 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:49.729
 to have it again and the day has it 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:52.280
 saved then I've spent my money 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:54.080
 I have recovered it and everything is perfect and if 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:57.619
 we do individually as well as 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:59.479
 You see the 20 times I spend the money what 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:00.500
 I put in the bank and I would have another 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:01.759
 back again 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.590
 good people I hope you liked the 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:06.560
 video and you already know how to take advantage of the bank 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:10.390
 take advantage of the time pump the clock 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.390
 of the time until the next video
