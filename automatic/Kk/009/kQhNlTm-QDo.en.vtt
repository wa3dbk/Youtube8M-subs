00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 of casks with their soles and sunchos are 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:08.750
 concrete the project of making tubs of 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.750
 heated bath 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:18.710
 how your idea arose 

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:20.360
 arises from a situation of lack of 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:22.580
 work 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:24.030
 in the house a friend who had brought a 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.910
 from Canada 

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:29.820
 and already with a couple of weeks turning around 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.180
 to see what was done around 50 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:36.500
 hair years works to meet the slope 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:39.560
 insert yourself in some company 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:41.540
 and you had to develop something that was 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:43.220
 entertained and to give us the 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:47.470
 independence and the possibility of having 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.470
 an acceptable income 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.620
 for you 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.610
 It's all we can 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:04.800
 the first the first tub that I made the 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.240
 I sent it to do about seven years ago and 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.040
 I always stay around the 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.960
 way to improve it to enlarge the 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.570
 put a fact that they were copper if 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.280
 were made of bronze and we made the first 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.710
 tina seven years ago with my wife 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.750
 we send it to do and then when 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.580
 we saw that this this product 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.380
 existed and we entered the internet and 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.350
 we forbid that a friend brought one of 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:28.259
 canada and we got into the hot water 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:31.740
 and I remember that the thing stayed a lot 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:34.770
 firmer on the hard drive and hence a 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.810
 day was coming on the road and the thing was 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.180
 I was enlightened in the middle of the road 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:42.690
 out of fear and for all the said I'm going to 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.670
 do and I got sidetracked and started in 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:47.909
 At the same time, look for the teachers 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:50.399
 coopers who knew about the subject and a 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.560
 place where the first teacher that you 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:56.240
 I asked he told me if I do it and 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.470
 we start by making a first tub that 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.990
 it turned out it was put on display in a 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:04.759
 place people started arriving and 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.759
 apparently the thing learned 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:13.020
 cold and thorns and three that is not native 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.340
 but that has a result 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.680
 extraordinary with him 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.410
 in the water in fact it is to that wood it 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:22.320
 occupy to build boats 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:23.870
 then both are the two woods that 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.820
 they are occupied for this type of work 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.230
 basically two sizes of tub this 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:30.810
 which is two meters in diameter in the 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:33.120
 top are conical and another that 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.630
 It is two and a half meters in diameter 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.630
 the top 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.830
 what is important in the making of these 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.390
 heaters is the airtightness that 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:59.220
 they have to have because they are submerged 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:03:00.720
 in water and that leads us to every time 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.310
 that we made them and before entering 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.530
 to galvanize the van gaal van izaban 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.180
 hot we do several tests of 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:08.910
 tightness so that there is no 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.019
 type of porosity welding and not 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:12.930
 we have no problem once 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:15.090
 installed people believe that the 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:18.870
 galvanized a layer that goes over the 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:20.760
 iron and it's not like that because in the process 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.099
 of galvanized is incorporated the 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.540
 galvanized penetrates inside the 

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:27.239
 material so that here I can 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:30.500
 make a hole scratch and I do not lose 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:30.500
 The quality of galvanized 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:37.060
 the heater system is particular 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:39.250
 taking advantage of combustion very well 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:41.910
 water circulates through tubes that heat it 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:44.130
 it's like a small boiler 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:46.590
 this modality exists in other parts 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:49.050
 of the world but here you add this to 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:51.510
 reinvention and we have a system that 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:53.160
 works online and that allows you to 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:55.970
 hot baths even when the rain 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.980
 Southern manifests in pendulum 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:00.290
 how much damage in vats for example your tail 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:03.440
 can get to heat these 3,000 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:05.180
 liters half a yard average and if 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.770
 We consider that the baraka in the area 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:08.660
 port is now about three thousand 

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:10.670
 three thousand 500 pesos means that we 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:13.550
 we can give a tub with two thousand pesos 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:16.310
 we give ourselves a good tubs or the first day 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:18.829
 because we are starting those works and 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:20.810
 half three hours we are starting from the 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:23.420
 guagua 8 degrees that the one that leaves the 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:25.460
 key but day 2 or day 3 already 

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:28.400
 we broke the inertia we no longer have latina 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:31.280
 8 degrees and we have it at 20 25 degrees and 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:35.890
 with a load a couple of sticks and one hour 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:35.890
 of delay we are ready 

00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:39.659
 I felt one of the pleasures that has 

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:44.039
 the fact of bathing and heating the water 

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:46.949
 here is that while you are in Libya 

00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:49.799
 they can go throwing logs inside the 

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:53.809
 kettle and feel the crunch of this 

00:04:49.799 --> 00:04:53.809
 beautiful fire and shelters us 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:01.620
 we have not not gone against 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:03.449
 wall looking looking 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:06.270
 financing with banks not the 

00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:07.620
 we have found and it is a bit of 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:11.610
 suddenly what we need to be able to 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:13.110
 give more give more labor to expand 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:15.540
 our horizon expand our 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:17.790
 market is really not what a 

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:20.100
 businessman needs is so small the 

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:22.970
 push but it's extremely difficult to 

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:25.440
 done I already at the bank level is not 

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:27.630
 distressing suddenly feel that one 

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:29.490
 have a project in their hands that has 

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:32.280
 all the potential that by where one what 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:34.470
 see says this is going to turn out in fact I 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:36.350
 I'm giving a workforce with high 

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:38.100
 difficulty and with effort I'm giving 

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:41.250
 work 

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:44.070
 I'm giving work and it costs me 

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:45.690
 I think suddenly what is needed 

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:47.820
 is that small and medium enterprises 

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:53.180
 really have a bank of their own or 

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:53.180
 someone who really supports him now
