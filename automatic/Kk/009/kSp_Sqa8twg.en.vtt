experiences that fertilizer with trace
elements<00:00:52.210> of<00:00:52.360> copper<00:00:52.750> would<00:00:53.110> not<00:00:53.410> hurt

00:00:53.639 --> 00:00:53.649 
elements of copper would not hurt

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:56.310 
elements of copper would not hurt
mushroom<00:00:54.510> into<00:00:55.510> the<00:00:55.660> region<00:00:55.930> that<00:00:56.050> I'll<00:00:56.170> be

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:56.320 
mushroom into the region that I'll be

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.020 
mushroom into the region that I'll be
using<00:00:56.350> this<00:00:56.710> in<00:00:56.860> my<00:00:56.890> low<00:00:57.100> tech<00:00:57.340> planted<00:00:57.820> tank

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:58.030 
using this in my low tech planted tank

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.930 
using this in my low tech planted tank
so<00:00:58.690> a<00:00:58.989> little<00:00:59.350> bit<00:00:59.530> more<00:00:59.590> about<00:00:59.950> it<00:01:00.160> so<00:01:00.340> for

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:00.940 
so a little bit more about it so for

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:02.819 
so a little bit more about it so for
those<00:01:01.059> people<00:01:01.360> that<00:01:01.450> don't<00:01:01.600> know<00:01:01.870> copiers

00:01:02.819 --> 00:01:02.829 
those people that don't know copiers

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:04.770 
those people that don't know copiers
generally<00:01:03.309> generally<00:01:03.730> used<00:01:04.119> and<00:01:04.299> fertilizer

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:04.780 
generally generally used and fertilizer

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.529 
generally generally used and fertilizer
a<00:01:05.290> lot<00:01:05.710> in<00:01:05.890> the<00:01:05.979> Far<00:01:06.189> East<00:01:06.369> to<00:01:06.999> actually<00:01:07.359> keep

00:01:07.529 --> 00:01:07.539 
a lot in the Far East to actually keep

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:09.840 
a lot in the Far East to actually keep
snails<00:01:07.929> or<00:01:08.170> plants<00:01:08.770> now<00:01:09.009> the<00:01:09.490> problem<00:01:09.789> about

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:09.850 
snails or plants now the problem about

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:11.550 
snails or plants now the problem about
that<00:01:09.999> is<00:01:10.299> that<00:01:10.329> if<00:01:10.659> it<00:01:10.840> sits<00:01:11.049> on<00:01:11.170> the<00:01:11.319> plant

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:11.560 
that is that if it sits on the plant

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.499 
that is that if it sits on the plant
even<00:01:12.039> if<00:01:12.219> a<00:01:12.310> little<00:01:12.490> bit<00:01:12.670> is<00:01:12.729> on<00:01:12.939> that<00:01:13.060> plant<00:01:13.329> it

00:01:13.499 --> 00:01:13.509 
even if a little bit is on that plant it

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:16.020 
even if a little bit is on that plant it
can<00:01:13.719> actually<00:01:14.079> kill<00:01:15.069> an<00:01:15.219> entire<00:01:15.340> colony<00:01:15.850> of

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.030 
can actually kill an entire colony of

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.660 
can actually kill an entire colony of
shrimp<00:01:16.270> in<00:01:16.389> a<00:01:16.479> tank<00:01:16.719> so<00:01:17.049> any<00:01:17.829> copper<00:01:18.310> to<00:01:18.399> attack

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670 
shrimp in a tank so any copper to attack

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:20.239 
shrimp in a tank so any copper to attack
Mike's<00:01:18.999> a<00:01:19.179> little<00:01:19.569> bit<00:01:19.659> counterproductive

00:01:20.239 --> 00:01:20.249 
Mike's a little bit counterproductive

00:01:20.249 --> 00:01:23.309 
Mike's a little bit counterproductive
now<00:01:21.249> what<00:01:21.759> we've<00:01:21.939> gotten<00:01:22.359> is<00:01:22.600> I've<00:01:22.929> received

00:01:23.309 --> 00:01:23.319

now<00:01:35.889> what<00:01:36.520> those<00:01:36.670> I<00:01:36.909> just<00:01:37.179> if<00:01:37.299> I<00:01:37.420> can<00:01:37.569> explain

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
now what those I just if I can explain

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.289 
now what those I just if I can explain
that<00:01:38.049> quickly<00:01:38.439> is<00:01:38.649> we<00:01:39.279> don't<00:01:39.429> really<00:01:39.639> know<00:01:39.969> how

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:40.299 
that quickly is we don't really know how

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:41.419 
that quickly is we don't really know how
much

00:01:41.419 --> 00:01:41.429 
much

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:43.949 
much
minerals<00:01:42.429> and<00:01:42.639> nutrients<00:01:43.119> plants<00:01:43.420> actually

00:01:43.949 --> 00:01:43.959 
minerals and nutrients plants actually

00:01:43.959 --> 00:01:46.800 
minerals and nutrients plants actually
use<00:01:44.229> so<00:01:44.799> we<00:01:44.979> estimated<00:01:45.520> and<00:01:45.909> then<00:01:46.420> he<00:01:46.539> sells

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810 
use so we estimated and then he sells

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.050 
use so we estimated and then he sells
you<00:01:47.020> a<00:01:47.049> kit<00:01:47.349> it<00:01:47.920> comes<00:01:47.979> as<00:01:48.399> a<00:01:48.429> gift<00:01:48.609> where<00:01:48.880> you

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.060 
you a kit it comes as a gift where you

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:50.849 
you a kit it comes as a gift where you
get<00:01:49.270> bags<00:01:49.539> of<00:01:49.779> the<00:01:49.899> different<00:01:50.200> types<00:01:50.380> of<00:01:50.499> salts

00:01:50.849 --> 00:01:50.859 
get bags of the different types of salts

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:53.010 
get bags of the different types of salts
such<00:01:50.979> as<00:01:51.119> potassium<00:01:52.119> etc

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
such as potassium etc

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.019 
such as potassium etc
and<00:01:53.109> then<00:01:53.469> you<00:01:53.590> mix<00:01:53.770> those<00:01:54.039> into<00:01:54.369> a<00:01:54.399> bottle<00:01:54.759> so

00:01:55.019 --> 00:01:55.029 
and then you mix those into a bottle so

00:01:55.029 --> 00:01:57.179 
and then you mix those into a bottle so
it's<00:01:55.509> a<00:01:55.599> very<00:01:55.810> cost<00:01:56.079> effective<00:01:56.229> in<00:01:56.740> terms<00:01:56.889> of

00:01:57.179 --> 00:01:57.189 
it's a very cost effective in terms of

00:01:57.189 --> 00:01:59.849 
it's a very cost effective in terms of
how<00:01:57.789> long<00:01:57.969> you<00:01:58.119> can<00:01:58.240> use<00:01:58.419> it<00:01:58.599> kit<00:01:59.349> can<00:01:59.499> last<00:01:59.679> you

00:01:59.849 --> 00:01:59.859 
how long you can use it kit can last you

00:01:59.859 --> 00:02:00.219 
how long you can use it kit can last you
anything

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:00.229 
anything

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:03.370 
anything
from<00:02:00.560> six<00:02:00.890> months<00:02:01.219> to<00:02:01.369> it<00:02:01.490> yeah<00:02:02.810> plus<00:02:03.229> you're

from six months to it yeah plus you're

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:04.600 
from six months to it yeah plus you're
not<00:02:03.500> really<00:02:03.740> paying<00:02:03.979> for<00:02:04.130> the<00:02:04.280> water<00:02:04.490> that

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610 
not really paying for the water that

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:06.700 
not really paying for the water that
they're<00:02:04.880> mixing<00:02:05.240> it<00:02:05.390> into<00:02:05.630> so<00:02:06.020> all<00:02:06.530> those

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
they're mixing it into so all those

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.139 
they're mixing it into so all those
squares<00:02:07.039> and<00:02:07.130> bottles<00:02:07.430> that<00:02:07.579> you<00:02:07.700> find<00:02:07.909> such

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
squares and bottles that you find such

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:10.210 
squares and bottles that you find such
as<00:02:08.269> easy<00:02:08.539> life<00:02:08.780> for<00:02:08.989> a<00:02:09.019> photo<00:02:09.349> or<00:02:09.800> some<00:02:09.979> of<00:02:10.069> even

enough<00:02:23.330> for<00:02:23.480> the<00:02:23.510> test<00:02:23.840> you<00:02:24.140> didn't<00:02:24.680> know<00:02:24.860> how

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
enough for the test you didn't know how

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:26.890 
enough for the test you didn't know how
long<00:02:25.459> I<00:02:25.519> was<00:02:25.670> going<00:02:25.760> to<00:02:26.030> test<00:02:26.269> for<00:02:26.510> so<00:02:26.690> think

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
long I was going to test for so think

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.600 
long I was going to test for so think
before<00:02:27.110> about<00:02:27.440> a<00:02:27.500> month<00:02:27.769> from<00:02:27.860> off<00:02:28.069> two<00:02:28.280> months

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
before about a month from off two months

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.460 
before about a month from off two months
and<00:02:28.970> I'll<00:02:29.120> be<00:02:29.239> running<00:02:29.510> this<00:02:29.660> test<00:02:29.930> for<00:02:30.230> four

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
and I'll be running this test for four

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:34.809 
and I'll be running this test for four
weeks<00:02:30.769> now<00:02:31.810> how<00:02:32.810> this<00:02:32.989> works<00:02:33.049> is<00:02:33.440> that<00:02:33.500> you<00:02:33.830> get

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:34.819 
weeks now how this works is that you get

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:37.900 
weeks now how this works is that you get
the<00:02:34.970> salt<00:02:35.180> and<00:02:35.540> you<00:02:35.690> premix<00:02:36.260> it<00:02:36.440> or<00:02:36.980> you<00:02:37.280> mix<00:02:37.730> it

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
the salt and you premix it or you mix it

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:39.400 
the salt and you premix it or you mix it
into<00:02:38.150> a<00:02:38.180> bottle<00:02:38.390> such<00:02:38.780> as<00:02:38.930> this<00:02:39.110> you<00:02:39.319> actually

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
into a bottle such as this you actually

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.229 
into a bottle such as this you actually
get<00:02:39.739> these<00:02:39.890> bottles<00:02:40.099> along<00:02:40.489> with<00:02:40.670> the<00:02:40.790> kit<00:02:41.000> and

00:02:41.229 --> 00:02:41.239 
get these bottles along with the kit and

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:43.870 
get these bottles along with the kit and
then<00:02:41.780> you<00:02:42.340> actually<00:02:43.340> dose<00:02:43.579> these

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
then you actually dose these

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.110 
then you actually dose these
alternatively<00:02:44.920> macro<00:02:45.920> micro<00:02:46.130> macro<00:02:46.519> micro<00:02:46.819> of

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
alternatively macro micro macro micro of

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.850 
alternatively macro micro macro micro of
the<00:02:47.209> day<00:02:47.360> off<00:02:47.599> during<00:02:47.810> the<00:02:47.959> week<00:02:48.200> so<00:02:48.680> you<00:02:48.709> can

the day off during the week so you can
do<00:02:49.160> three<00:02:49.730> micros<00:02:50.180> per<00:02:50.390> week<00:02:50.599> and<00:02:50.810> three

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
do three micros per week and three

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.710 
do three micros per week and three
macros<00:02:51.680> per<00:02:51.920> week<00:02:52.130> you<00:02:52.880> also<00:02:53.030> send<00:02:53.360> you<00:02:53.540> this

instructions for dosing on the back and

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:02.080 
instructions for dosing on the back and
it's<00:03:00.200> very<00:03:00.470> easy<00:03:00.709> to<00:03:00.980> understand<00:03:01.549> with<00:03:02.060> the

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
it's very easy to understand with the

actually<00:03:04.489> doing<00:03:04.790> it<00:03:05.030> so<00:03:05.239> they<00:03:05.750> go<00:03:05.900> very<00:03:06.230> far

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
actually doing it so they go very far

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:07.990 
actually doing it so they go very far
and<00:03:06.560> trying<00:03:07.040> to<00:03:07.160> teach<00:03:07.340> you<00:03:07.489> how<00:03:07.700> to<00:03:07.760> actually

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
and trying to teach you how to actually

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.199 
and trying to teach you how to actually
use<00:03:08.209> these<00:03:08.600> products<00:03:09.170> now<00:03:10.000> what<00:03:11.000> I<00:03:11.030> was

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:11.209 
use these products now what I was

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:12.849 
use these products now what I was
worried<00:03:11.480> about<00:03:11.569> mostly<00:03:12.079> is<00:03:12.200> that<00:03:12.530> of<00:03:12.709> course

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:12.859 
worried about mostly is that of course

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:15.699 
worried about mostly is that of course
will<00:03:13.280> it<00:03:13.400> damage<00:03:13.549> mushroom<00:03:14.090> so<00:03:14.450> apophysis<00:03:15.440> is

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:15.709 
will it damage mushroom so apophysis is

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:20.170 
will it damage mushroom so apophysis is
that<00:03:16.630> dosing<00:03:17.630> with<00:03:17.660> a<00:03:18.910> fertilizer<00:03:19.910> that

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
that dosing with a fertilizer that

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.750 
that dosing with a fertilizer that
contains<00:03:20.540> trace<00:03:20.930> minerals<00:03:21.470> of<00:03:21.769> copper<00:03:22.220> will

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
contains trace minerals of copper will

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.900 
contains trace minerals of copper will
not<00:03:23.090> do<00:03:23.389> it<00:03:23.480> mushroom<00:03:24.400> the<00:03:25.400> tank<00:03:25.609> that<00:03:25.760> will

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:25.910 
not do it mushroom the tank that will

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:29.440 
not do it mushroom the tank that will
actually<00:03:26.090> be<00:03:26.329> using<00:03:26.510> this<00:03:26.810> in<00:03:27.260> is<00:03:27.650> my<00:03:28.209> low<00:03:29.209> tech
