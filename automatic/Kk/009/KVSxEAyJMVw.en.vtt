landing a little slow almost didn't
rotate<00:02:05.070> it<00:02:05.430> which<00:02:05.579> would<00:02:05.759> have<00:02:05.939> probably<00:02:06.200> men

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
rotate it which would have probably men

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.050 
rotate it which would have probably men
I<00:02:07.229> would<00:02:07.469> have<00:02:07.560> broke<00:02:07.890> about<00:02:08.129> 20<00:02:08.580> bones<00:02:08.759> in<00:02:08.940> my

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
I would have broke about 20 bones in my

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.119 
I would have broke about 20 bones in my
body<00:02:09.239> but<00:02:09.450> it<00:02:09.750> did<00:02:09.899> did<00:02:10.289> make<00:02:10.470> it<00:02:10.500> around<00:02:10.830> and

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
body but it did did make it around and

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.120 
body but it did did make it around and
this<00:02:11.489> definitely<00:02:11.670> is<00:02:12.030> a<00:02:12.060> lot<00:02:12.270> more<00:02:12.480> dangerous

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
this definitely is a lot more dangerous

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.790 
this definitely is a lot more dangerous
when<00:02:13.280> I<00:02:13.310> do<00:02:13.840> normally<00:02:14.840> yeah<00:02:15.050> exactly<00:02:15.350> i<00:02:15.740> mean

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
when I do normally yeah exactly i mean

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.100 
when I do normally yeah exactly i mean
you<00:02:16.040> do<00:02:16.430> it<00:02:16.550> on<00:02:16.670> snow<00:02:16.940> it's<00:02:17.330> just<00:02:17.420> really<00:02:17.780> cool

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
you do it on snow it's just really cool

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.550 
you do it on snow it's just really cool
and<00:02:18.470> it's<00:02:18.530> different<00:02:18.890> to<00:02:19.310> have<00:02:19.820> a<00:02:19.850> snowmobile

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
and it's different to have a snowmobile

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.190 
and it's different to have a snowmobile
doing<00:02:21.560> backflips<00:02:22.280> dirt<00:02:23.210> to<00:02:23.390> dirt<00:02:23.600> or<00:02:23.900> you<00:02:24.080> know

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
doing backflips dirt to dirt or you know

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.500 
doing backflips dirt to dirt or you know
without<00:02:24.530> snow<00:02:24.950> you<00:02:25.400> know<00:02:25.490> yeah<00:02:25.670> cool<00:02:26.000> I<00:02:26.180> think

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
without snow you know yeah cool I think

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:27.520 
without snow you know yeah cool I think
that's<00:02:26.720> something<00:02:26.930> that<00:02:27.080> the<00:02:27.260> crowd<00:02:27.500> is

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
that's something that the crowd is

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.040 
that's something that the crowd is
really<00:02:27.890> stoked<00:02:28.280> on<00:02:28.550> the<00:02:28.790> you<00:02:29.180> know<00:02:29.300> it's<00:02:29.840> all

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
really stoked on the you know it's all

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:31.720 
really stoked on the you know it's all
about<00:02:30.260> like<00:02:30.530> Larry<00:02:30.800> said<00:02:31.130> you<00:02:31.430> got<00:02:31.550> to<00:02:31.580> bring

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
about like Larry said you got to bring

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.310 
about like Larry said you got to bring
the<00:02:31.850> danger<00:02:32.240> back<00:02:32.420> into<00:02:32.690> the<00:02:32.780> sport<00:02:33.080> and<00:02:33.230> I

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:33.320 
the danger back into the sport and I

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.950 
the danger back into the sport and I
think<00:02:33.560> the<00:02:33.680> snowmobile<00:02:34.280> on<00:02:34.760> these<00:02:35.210> ramps

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:35.960 
think the snowmobile on these ramps

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:37.930 
think the snowmobile on these ramps
definitely<00:02:36.410> is<00:02:36.530> dangerous<00:02:37.010> and<00:02:37.220> something

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
definitely is dangerous and something

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:39.580 
definitely is dangerous and something
that<00:02:37.970> people<00:02:38.360> will<00:02:38.630> never<00:02:38.900> ever<00:02:39.200> get<00:02:39.470> a<00:02:39.530> chance

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
that people will never ever get a chance

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.610 
that people will never ever get a chance
to<00:02:39.950> see<00:02:40.250> again<00:02:40.790> here<00:02:41.210> in<00:02:41.450> New<00:02:41.660> Zealand<00:02:42.080> and<00:02:42.320> in
