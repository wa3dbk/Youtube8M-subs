00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
extreme sour taste and I'm not saying

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.520 
extreme sour taste and I'm not saying
bitter<00:03:12.209> and<00:03:12.299> sour<00:03:12.480> bad<00:03:12.810> things<00:03:13.079> I<00:03:13.260> was<00:03:13.380> just

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
bitter and sour bad things I was just

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.300 
bitter and sour bad things I was just
saying<00:03:13.769> in<00:03:13.950> extreme<00:03:14.610> cases

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
saying in extreme cases

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:18.070 
saying in extreme cases
but<00:03:16.819> that's<00:03:17.000> not<00:03:17.090> true<00:03:17.330> for<00:03:17.360> all<00:03:17.599> things<00:03:17.810> too

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:18.080 
but that's not true for all things too

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.080 
but that's not true for all things too
so<00:03:18.500> I<00:03:18.530> mean<00:03:18.920> there's<00:03:19.099> some<00:03:19.280> poisonous<00:03:19.670> plants

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
so I mean there's some poisonous plants

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.170 
so I mean there's some poisonous plants
that<00:03:20.300> don't<00:03:20.420> have<00:03:20.660> any<00:03:20.840> taste<00:03:21.080> at<00:03:21.290> all<00:03:22.180> so

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
that don't have any taste at all so

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:24.760 
that don't have any taste at all so
after<00:03:23.450> you've<00:03:23.690> done<00:03:23.870> that<00:03:23.930> you<00:03:24.319> want<00:03:24.530> to<00:03:24.560> wait

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:24.770 
after you've done that you want to wait

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:27.070 
after you've done that you want to wait
a<00:03:25.010> good<00:03:25.040> amount<00:03:25.670> of<00:03:25.790> time<00:03:25.970> 30<00:03:26.569> minutes<00:03:26.959> to

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:27.080 
a good amount of time 30 minutes to

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:28.990 
a good amount of time 30 minutes to
three<00:03:27.349> hours<00:03:27.709> see<00:03:28.340> if<00:03:28.430> you<00:03:28.550> have<00:03:28.700> any<00:03:28.849> of<00:03:28.910> these

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
three hours see if you have any of these

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.140 
three hours see if you have any of these
adverse<00:03:29.330> reactions<00:03:30.340> so<00:03:31.340> the<00:03:31.610> next<00:03:31.640> step<00:03:31.940> in

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
adverse reactions so the next step in

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.120 
adverse reactions so the next step in
this<00:03:32.239> process<00:03:32.330> is<00:03:32.989> to<00:03:33.290> take<00:03:33.470> some<00:03:33.739> of<00:03:33.860> the<00:03:33.920> same

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.130 
this process is to take some of the same

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:36.309 
this process is to take some of the same
plan<00:03:34.400> and<00:03:34.670> again<00:03:34.880> at<00:03:35.000> small<00:03:35.300> pieces<00:03:35.630> maybe<00:03:35.989> one

00:03:36.309 --> 00:03:36.319 
plan and again at small pieces maybe one

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:37.960 
plan and again at small pieces maybe one
leaf<00:03:36.560> or<00:03:36.800> half<00:03:36.980> a<00:03:37.130> leaf<00:03:37.340> even<00:03:37.700> in<00:03:37.819> this

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
leaf or half a leaf even in this

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:40.630 
leaf or half a leaf even in this
particular<00:03:38.150> case<00:03:38.540> is<00:03:38.780> a<00:03:38.810> dandelion<00:03:39.230> and<00:03:40.190> then

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:40.640 
particular case is a dandelion and then

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.400 
particular case is a dandelion and then
you<00:03:40.760> want<00:03:40.910> to<00:03:41.060> ingest<00:03:41.480> it<00:03:41.630> and<00:03:41.810> this<00:03:42.019> is<00:03:42.200> again

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.410 
you want to ingest it and this is again

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:44.530 
you want to ingest it and this is again
it<00:03:42.680> you've<00:03:42.950> passed<00:03:43.250> the<00:03:43.459> forearm<00:03:43.880> test<00:03:44.180> you've

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:12.920 
to stay away from that plan so make sure

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:14.589 
to stay away from that plan so make sure
that<00:04:13.130> you<00:04:13.549> have<00:04:13.730> plenty<00:04:14.030> of<00:04:14.150> time<00:04:14.360> for<00:04:14.569> that

that you have plenty of time for that

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:16.690 
that you have plenty of time for that
food<00:04:14.930> to<00:04:15.080> digest<00:04:15.230> all<00:04:15.860> the<00:04:16.130> way<00:04:16.250> through<00:04:16.519> your

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:16.700 
food to digest all the way through your

food to digest all the way through your
intestinal<00:04:17.180> tract<00:04:17.510> so<00:04:18.350> in<00:04:18.620> this<00:04:18.769> particular

00:04:18.969 --> 00:04:18.979 
intestinal tract so in this particular

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:20.860 
intestinal tract so in this particular
case<00:04:19.609> we're<00:04:19.880> talking<00:04:19.910> about<00:04:20.239> a<00:04:20.359> survival

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:20.870 
case we're talking about a survival

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:23.440 
case we're talking about a survival
situation<00:04:21.019> keep<00:04:21.890> in<00:04:22.070> mind<00:04:22.100> if<00:04:22.640> you<00:04:23.090> studied

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:23.450 
situation keep in mind if you studied

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:26.170 
situation keep in mind if you studied
law<00:04:23.660> threes<00:04:24.110> you<00:04:24.979> know<00:04:25.220> that<00:04:25.520> you've<00:04:25.669> got<00:04:25.910> at

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:26.180 
law threes you know that you've got at

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:28.420 
law threes you know that you've got at
least<00:04:26.210> three<00:04:26.690> weeks<00:04:26.720> in<00:04:27.200> a<00:04:27.830> general<00:04:28.190> sense

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:28.430 
least three weeks in a general sense

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:31.029 
least three weeks in a general sense
before<00:04:28.760> you<00:04:29.030> have<00:04:29.210> to<00:04:29.300> consider<00:04:29.919> situation<00:04:30.919> of

00:04:31.029 --> 00:04:31.039 
before you have to consider situation of

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:32.890 
before you have to consider situation of
starvation<00:04:31.430> so<00:04:31.910> this<00:04:32.090> is<00:04:32.240> not<00:04:32.390> something<00:04:32.720> that

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:32.900 
starvation so this is not something that

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:35.350 
starvation so this is not something that
you<00:04:33.140> have<00:04:33.320> to<00:04:33.350> do<00:04:33.620> immediately<00:04:34.280> and<00:04:34.640> go<00:04:35.150> for

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.360 
you have to do immediately and go for

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.779 
you have to do immediately and go for
this<00:04:35.479> food<00:04:36.160> so<00:04:37.160> there<00:04:37.310> you<00:04:37.400> have<00:04:37.460> it<00:04:37.580> that's

00:04:37.779 --> 00:04:37.789 
this food so there you have it that's

00:04:37.789 --> 00:04:39.580 
this food so there you have it that's
pretty<00:04:37.940> much<00:04:38.240> it<00:04:38.300> you<00:04:38.690> want<00:04:38.870> to<00:04:38.900> get<00:04:39.050> a<00:04:39.229> forearm

pretty much it you want to get a forearm

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:41.950 
pretty much it you want to get a forearm
test<00:04:39.919> you<00:04:40.310> want<00:04:40.520> to<00:04:40.610> get<00:04:40.700> a<00:04:40.729> tongue<00:04:41.000> test<00:04:41.300> you

test you want to get a tongue test you
want<00:04:42.110> to<00:04:42.200> get<00:04:42.350> a<00:04:42.789> digestion<00:04:43.789> chip<00:04:44.270> test<00:04:44.900> and

00:04:45.219 --> 00:04:45.229 
want to get a digestion chip test and

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:48.460 
want to get a digestion chip test and
it's<00:04:45.740> hard<00:04:45.919> to<00:04:45.950> say<00:04:46.160> digestion<00:04:46.870> test<00:04:47.870> make

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:48.470 
it's hard to say digestion test make

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:50.320 
it's hard to say digestion test make
sure<00:04:48.500> it<00:04:48.710> goes<00:04:48.830> through<00:04:49.100> your<00:04:49.370> entire<00:04:49.820> system

with no adverse effects on any three of
these<00:04:52.430> and<00:04:52.729> then<00:04:53.539> it<00:04:53.780> may<00:04:53.990> be<00:04:54.050> possible<00:04:54.380> for

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:54.860 
these and then it may be possible for
