00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
a7 chip with 64-bit architecture it's

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.109 
a7 chip with 64-bit architecture it's
also<00:02:03.540> got<00:02:03.750> the<00:02:03.869> new<00:02:03.990> m7<00:02:04.619> motion<00:02:04.799> coprocessor

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119 
also got the new m7 motion coprocessor

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:07.490

and<00:02:06.119> if<00:02:06.630> you<00:02:06.689> know<00:02:06.810> what<00:02:06.930> this<00:02:07.079> is<00:02:07.259> it

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
and if you know what this is it

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.609 
and if you know what this is it
basically<00:02:08.149> collects<00:02:09.149> processes<00:02:09.599> and<00:02:10.229> stores

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
basically collects processes and stores

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.290 
basically collects processes and stores
sensor<00:02:11.069> data<00:02:11.250> and<00:02:11.520> when<00:02:11.940> the<00:02:12.060> device<00:02:12.270> is

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
sensor data and when the device is

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.610 
sensor data and when the device is
asleep<00:02:12.840> and<00:02:13.110> then<00:02:13.410> when

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
asleep and then when

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.759 
asleep and then when
turns<00:02:13.860> back<00:02:14.159> on<00:02:14.190> apps<00:02:14.640> can<00:02:14.879> retrieve<00:02:15.209> the<00:02:15.330> data

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:15.769 
turns back on apps can retrieve the data

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:18.050 
turns back on apps can retrieve the data
when<00:02:16.769> it's<00:02:16.920> powered<00:02:17.040> up<00:02:17.220> again<00:02:17.489> and<00:02:17.730> this<00:02:17.940> is

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
when it's powered up again and this is

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.670 
when it's powered up again and this is
this<00:02:18.269> is<00:02:18.330> just<00:02:18.510> a<00:02:18.629> really<00:02:19.019> phenomenal<00:02:19.260> feature

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
this is just a really phenomenal feature

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.410 
this is just a really phenomenal feature
because<00:02:20.040> it<00:02:20.069> reduces<00:02:20.610> the<00:02:20.730> power<00:02:20.909> draw<00:02:21.239> of<00:02:21.269> the

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
because it reduces the power draw of the

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.509 
because it reduces the power draw of the
device<00:02:21.690> and<00:02:21.930> it<00:02:22.230> saves<00:02:22.470> a<00:02:22.680> ton<00:02:23.010> of<00:02:23.069> battery

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
device and it saves a ton of battery

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:23.930 
device and it saves a ton of battery
