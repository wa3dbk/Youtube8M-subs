gonna hook this up real quick and uh get
the<00:02:38.760> test<00:02:39.000> in<00:02:39.120> it<00:02:40.430> alright<00:02:41.430> so<00:02:41.700> I<00:02:41.760> got<00:02:41.910> the<00:02:42.030> bass

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
the test in it alright so I got the bass

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:45.470 
the test in it alright so I got the bass
knob<00:02:42.420> installed<00:02:42.870> um<00:02:43.910> it's<00:02:44.910> been<00:02:45.030> in<00:02:45.180> start<00:02:45.360> for

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
knob installed um it's been in start for

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.660 
knob installed um it's been in start for
a<00:02:45.510> little<00:02:45.690> while<00:02:45.810> now<00:02:45.989> a<00:02:46.370> little<00:02:47.370> while<00:02:47.489> today

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
a little while now a little while today

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.890 
a little while now a little while today
about<00:02:48.060> an<00:02:48.150> hour<00:02:48.270> and<00:02:48.450> a<00:02:48.480> half<00:02:48.690> um<00:02:50.780> problems<00:02:51.780> I

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
about an hour and a half um problems I

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.620 
about an hour and a half um problems I
had<00:02:52.050> with<00:02:52.230> it<00:02:52.410> were<00:02:52.790> nothing<00:02:53.790> it<00:02:54.239> wasn't<00:02:54.510> that

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
had with it were nothing it wasn't that

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.240 
had with it were nothing it wasn't that
that<00:02:54.870> little<00:02:55.080> piece<00:02:55.230> here<00:02:55.650> right<00:02:55.860> there<00:02:56.040> is

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
that little piece here right there is

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.400 
that little piece here right there is
the<00:02:56.340> part<00:02:56.550> I<00:02:56.610> soldered<00:02:56.940> in<00:02:57.000> heat<00:02:57.120> shrunk<00:02:57.410> what

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
the part I soldered in heat shrunk what

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.229 
the part I soldered in heat shrunk what
I<00:02:58.440> think<00:02:58.680> happened<00:02:59.070> inside<00:02:59.790> the<00:02:59.940> heat<00:03:00.060> shrink

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
I think happened inside the heat shrink

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:01.670 
I think happened inside the heat shrink
was<00:03:00.480> when<00:03:00.630> I<00:03:00.690> was<00:03:00.840> using<00:03:00.959> my<00:03:01.140> lighter<00:03:01.350> since<00:03:01.590> I

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
was when I was using my lighter since I

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.250 
was when I was using my lighter since I
don't<00:03:01.739> have<00:03:01.830> a<00:03:01.950> heat<00:03:02.070> gun<00:03:02.250> to<00:03:02.550> it<00:03:03.420> a<00:03:03.630> little

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
don't have a heat gun to it a little

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.800 
don't have a heat gun to it a little
thin<00:03:04.470> RCA<00:03:04.860> wires<00:03:05.190> the<00:03:05.880> solder<00:03:06.120> on<00:03:06.269> that<00:03:06.390> melted

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
thin RCA wires the solder on that melted

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:07.910 
thin RCA wires the solder on that melted
and<00:03:06.870> it<00:03:06.989> pulled<00:03:07.170> them<00:03:07.260> apart<00:03:07.380> so<00:03:07.739> they<00:03:07.830> were

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
and it pulled them apart so they were

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.770 
and it pulled them apart so they were
kind<00:03:08.010> of<00:03:08.130> touching<00:03:08.489> together<00:03:08.790> and<00:03:09.360> then<00:03:09.510> in

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
kind of touching together and then in

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.870 
kind of touching together and then in
the<00:03:10.080> under<00:03:10.709> there<00:03:10.890> when<00:03:11.220> I<00:03:11.250> had<00:03:11.400> it<00:03:11.519> when<00:03:11.670> I<00:03:11.730> put

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
the under there when I had it when I put

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.370 
the under there when I had it when I put
it<00:03:11.970> back<00:03:12.000> on<00:03:12.209> the<00:03:12.330> first<00:03:12.510> time<00:03:12.720> so<00:03:13.019> wasn't<00:03:13.320> as

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
it back on the first time so wasn't as

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:14.270 
it back on the first time so wasn't as
loud<00:03:13.500> as<00:03:13.650> it<00:03:13.680> supposed<00:03:13.920> to<00:03:13.980> be<00:03:14.040> it<00:03:14.130> would<00:03:14.220> be

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
loud as it supposed to be it would be

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.340 
loud as it supposed to be it would be
like<00:03:14.430> loud<00:03:14.670> and<00:03:14.700> it<00:03:15.030> wouldn't<00:03:15.209> be<00:03:15.269> loud<00:03:15.450> I<00:03:15.720> like

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
like loud and it wouldn't be loud I like

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:17.630 
like loud and it wouldn't be loud I like
them<00:03:16.470> the<00:03:16.620> vibrations<00:03:17.100> and<00:03:17.280> stuff<00:03:17.430> and<00:03:17.550> not

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
them the vibrations and stuff and not

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:18.910 
them the vibrations and stuff and not
took<00:03:17.820> it<00:03:17.940> out<00:03:18.030> and<00:03:18.060> wiggled<00:03:18.450> the<00:03:18.480> wire<00:03:18.660> around

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
took it out and wiggled the wire around

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.300 
took it out and wiggled the wire around
and<00:03:19.920> ever<00:03:20.250> get<00:03:20.400> louder<00:03:20.580> and

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
and ever get louder and

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:25.640 
and ever get louder and
you<00:03:21.340> know<00:03:21.540> vice<00:03:22.540> versa<00:03:22.920> so<00:03:23.920> um<00:03:24.160> I<00:03:24.760> redid<00:03:25.480> it

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
you know vice versa so um I redid it

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.979 
you know vice versa so um I redid it
temporarily<00:03:26.650> with<00:03:27.459> some<00:03:27.670> I<00:03:28.120> restarted<00:03:28.750> it<00:03:28.900> and

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:28.989 
temporarily with some I restarted it and

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:31.199 
temporarily with some I restarted it and
electrical<00:03:29.410> taped<00:03:29.620> it<00:03:29.800> and<00:03:30.670> the<00:03:30.790> reason<00:03:31.000> I<00:03:31.060> did

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.209 
electrical taped it and the reason I did

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:33.660 
electrical taped it and the reason I did
this<00:03:31.270> again<00:03:31.420> early<00:03:31.870> is<00:03:32.110> because<00:03:32.349> I'm<00:03:33.310> about<00:03:33.610> to

the blue ones under new concepts but i

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:52.830 
the blue ones under new concepts but i
just<00:03:51.430> like<00:03:51.519> ah<00:03:51.760> the<00:03:52.150> way<00:03:52.269> those<00:03:52.450> are<00:03:52.630> and<00:03:52.810> I

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 
just like ah the way those are and I

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.800 
just like ah the way those are and I
want<00:03:53.019> the<00:03:53.200> same<00:03:53.380> ones<00:03:53.620> so<00:03:53.920> let<00:03:54.160> me<00:03:54.220> get<00:03:54.370> those

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
want the same ones so let me get those

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.840 
want the same ones so let me get those
but<00:03:55.810> that's<00:03:56.170> why<00:03:56.410> I<00:03:56.739> just<00:03:57.400> kind<00:03:57.580> of<00:03:57.610> get<00:03:57.760> it
