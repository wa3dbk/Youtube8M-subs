00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:47.740 
on my old controller I took them out

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:48.780 
on my old controller I took them out

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890 
an experiment with advanced warfare I've

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:52.649 
an experiment with advanced warfare I've
actually<00:01:51.100> ordered<00:01:51.580> two<00:01:51.850> pairs<00:01:52.030> of<00:01:52.180> control

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:52.659 
actually ordered two pairs of control

actually ordered two pairs of control
freaks<00:01:52.900> I<00:01:53.110> ordered<00:01:53.680> the<00:01:53.740> Alpha<00:01:54.130> ones<00:01:54.310> which

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 
freaks I ordered the Alpha ones which

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:55.980 
freaks I ordered the Alpha ones which
are<00:01:54.610> the<00:01:54.850> really<00:01:55.000> small<00:01:55.270> one<00:01:55.479> that<00:01:55.630> was<00:01:55.720> just

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
are the really small one that was just

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:57.570 
are the really small one that was just
apparently<00:01:56.380> increased<00:01:56.890> surface<00:01:57.070> area<00:01:57.310> so<00:01:57.520> i'm

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:57.580 
apparently increased surface area so i'm

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:59.280 
apparently increased surface area so i'm
going<00:01:57.670> to<00:01:57.729> use<00:01:57.850> that<00:01:57.880> for<00:01:58.270> my<00:01:58.390> walking<00:01:59.260> stick

00:01:59.280 --> 00:01:59.290

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:02.070 
going to use that for my walking stick
and<00:01:59.799> then<00:02:00.460> I<00:02:00.490> ordered<00:02:00.700> FPS<00:02:01.360> freek<00:02:01.570> sentinels

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:02.080 
and then I ordered FPS freek sentinels

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:03.950 
and then I ordered FPS freek sentinels
