feature right and then just in terms of
dimensions<00:00:58.320> it's<00:00:58.620> one<00:00:59.280> third<00:00:59.579> Leiter<00:00:59.969> and

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
dimensions it's one third Leiter and

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.630 
dimensions it's one third Leiter and
one-third<00:01:01.109> slimmer<00:01:01.530> than<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:01.980> current<00:01:02.280> model

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
one-third slimmer than the current model

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.219 
one-third slimmer than the current model
it's<00:01:02.789> a<00:01:02.910> las<00:01:03.059> 11<00:01:03.090> right<00:01:03.600> now<00:01:03.750> it's<00:01:03.930> really

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
it's a las 11 right now it's really

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.230 
it's a las 11 right now it's really
quiet<00:01:04.710> compared<00:01:05.339> to<00:01:05.430> mine<00:01:05.610> which<00:01:05.880> is<00:01:06.060> always

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
quiet compared to mine which is always

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.179 
quiet compared to mine which is always
on<00:01:06.540> I<00:01:06.810> mean<00:01:07.170> that<00:01:07.290> one's<00:01:07.409> quite<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:07.890> other

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
on I mean that one's quite the other

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.330 
on I mean that one's quite the other
moment<00:01:08.520> as<00:01:08.580> well<00:01:08.729> this<00:01:08.970> was<00:01:09.180> yes<00:01:09.920> the<00:01:10.920> amount

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
moment as well this was yes the amount

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.010 
moment as well this was yes the amount
of<00:01:11.430> heat<00:01:11.580> that<00:01:11.610> this<00:01:12.119> one<00:01:12.270> generates<00:01:12.630> compared

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
of heat that this one generates compared

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.050 
of heat that this one generates compared
to<00:01:13.140> this<00:01:13.260> is<00:01:13.500> is<00:01:13.890> pretty<00:01:14.159> dramatic<00:01:14.520> we<00:01:14.850> just

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
to this is is pretty dramatic we just

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:22.190 
to this is is pretty dramatic we just
listen<00:01:16.340> here<00:01:17.340> like<00:01:17.490> right<00:01:17.610> here<00:01:21.200> because

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
listen here like right here because

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.020 
listen here like right here because
they've<00:01:22.950> all<00:01:23.100> been<00:01:23.250> on<00:01:23.400> for<00:01:23.700> basically<00:01:23.939> the

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
they've all been on for basically the

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.789 
they've all been on for basically the
same<00:01:24.180> amount<00:01:24.330> of<00:01:24.479> time<00:01:24.540> okay<00:01:25.320> well<00:01:25.470> it<00:01:25.530> doesn't

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
same amount of time okay well it doesn't

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.380 
same amount of time okay well it doesn't
seem<00:01:26.040> much<00:01:26.100> different<00:01:26.220> is<00:01:26.670> she<00:01:26.820> looking<00:01:27.180> right

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
seem much different is she looking right

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.630 
seem much different is she looking right
now<00:01:27.420> I<00:01:28.020> thought<00:01:28.770> I<00:01:28.920> was<00:01:29.040> one<00:01:29.159> of<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:29.310> features

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
now I thought I was one of the features

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.330 
now I thought I was one of the features
that<00:01:29.670> you<00:01:30.150> it<00:01:30.630> was<00:01:31.020> kind<00:01:31.200> of<00:01:31.290> cool<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:32.100> chips

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
that you it was kind of cool the chips

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.429 
that you it was kind of cool the chips
are<00:01:32.460> difference<00:01:32.850> in<00:01:33.000> it<00:01:33.290> everything's<00:01:34.290> been

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
are difference in it everything's been

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.039 
are difference in it everything's been
shrunk<00:01:34.650> down<00:01:34.920> and<00:01:34.979> it's<00:01:35.729> a<00:01:35.850> third<00:01:36.090> less<00:01:36.299> power

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
shrunk down and it's a third less power

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.090 
shrunk down and it's a third less power
consumption<00:01:37.380> though<00:01:37.710> that's<00:01:37.920> prime

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
consumption though that's prime

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.109 
consumption though that's prime
consumption<00:01:38.549> okay<00:01:39.049> right<00:01:40.049> and<00:01:40.970> this<00:01:41.970> is

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
consumption okay right and this is

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.990 
consumption okay right and this is
fairly<00:01:42.840> minor<00:01:43.170> but<00:01:43.439> this<00:01:43.590> power<00:01:44.340> cables<00:01:44.850> a

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
fairly minor but this power cables a

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.490 
fairly minor but this power cables a
little<00:01:45.240> bit<00:01:45.360> slimmer<00:01:45.960> is<00:01:46.110> actually<00:01:46.350> similar

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
little bit slimmer is actually similar

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.230 
little bit slimmer is actually similar
to<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:46.860> yeah<00:01:47.040> yeah<00:01:48.000> playstation<00:01:48.600> 2<00:01:48.780> Kim

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.530 

but<00:01:52.200> other<00:01:52.470> than<00:01:52.560> that<00:01:52.619> the<00:01:53.210> hdmi<00:01:54.210> this<00:01:54.390> to

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
but other than that the hdmi this to

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.840 
but other than that the hdmi this to
hdmi<00:01:55.049> so<00:01:55.110> there's<00:01:55.530> 11<00:01:55.920> what's<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:56.549> other<00:01:56.640> one

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
hdmi so there's 11 what's the other one

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.120 
hdmi so there's 11 what's the other one
that's<00:01:57.030> just<00:01:57.299> the<00:01:57.509> multi<00:01:58.079> AV<00:01:58.350> connectors<00:01:58.979> by

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
that's just the multi AV connectors by

same was it on the side and you need to

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:21.050 
same was it on the side and you need to
unscrew<00:03:17.010> which<00:03:19.670> that's<00:03:20.670> other<00:03:20.850> thing<00:03:20.970> I'm

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
screen capture we don't have the

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.380 
screen capture we don't have the
upcoming<00:03:57.840> 3.0<00:03:58.590> firmware<00:03:58.830> update<00:03:59.400> on<00:03:59.640> this

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
upcoming 3.0 firmware update on this

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:02.750 
upcoming 3.0 firmware update on this
unit<00:04:00.750> but<00:04:00.900> we<00:04:01.050> do<00:04:01.200> have<00:04:01.590> a<00:04:01.860> couple<00:04:02.070> of<00:04:02.340> screens

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
unit but we do have a couple of screens

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.820 
unit but we do have a couple of screens
of<00:04:02.910> what<00:04:03.030> it<00:04:03.120> will<00:04:03.300> look<00:04:03.330> like<00:04:03.510> on<00:04:04.020> this<00:04:04.470> unit

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:04.830 
of what it will look like on this unit

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:09.320 
of what it will look like on this unit
so<00:04:06.050> this<00:04:07.050> is<00:04:07.320> one<00:04:08.220> screen<00:04:08.640> it<00:04:08.820> really<00:04:09.060> just

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:09.330 
so this is one screen it really just

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:11.120 
so this is one screen it really just
shows<00:04:09.600> what<00:04:10.080> a<00:04:10.230> couple<00:04:10.380> of<00:04:10.590> things<00:04:10.770> that<00:04:10.860> shows

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:11.130
