in<00:00:00.420> this<00:00:00.690> video<00:00:00.900> I'm<00:00:01.319> going<00:00:01.589> to<00:00:01.680> answer<00:00:01.949> the

00:00:02.119 --> 00:00:02.129 
in this video I'm going to answer the

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:04.519 
in this video I'm going to answer the
question<00:00:02.550> what<00:00:03.300> weight<00:00:03.510> gloves<00:00:03.840> are<00:00:04.110> the<00:00:04.290> best

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529 
question what weight gloves are the best

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:14.200 
question what weight gloves are the best
for<00:00:04.710> improving<00:00:05.040> punching<00:00:05.640> hand<00:00:05.850> speed

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:14.210 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:16.640 

training<00:00:15.210> in<00:00:15.299> heavier<00:00:15.599> gloves<00:00:15.839> has<00:00:16.109> long<00:00:16.410> been

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
training in heavier gloves has long been

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.140 
training in heavier gloves has long been
thought<00:00:16.949> to<00:00:17.190> improve<00:00:17.279> strength<00:00:17.850> and

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
thought to improve strength and

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.570 
thought to improve strength and
therefore<00:00:18.750> punching<00:00:19.470> speed<00:00:19.740> once<00:00:20.130> you<00:00:20.250> return

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
therefore punching speed once you return

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.450 
therefore punching speed once you return
to<00:00:20.880> regular<00:00:21.510> weight<00:00:21.660> gloves<00:00:22.010> others<00:00:23.010> swear<00:00:23.250> by

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
to regular weight gloves others swear by

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.029 
to regular weight gloves others swear by
shadow<00:00:23.760> boxing<00:00:24.150> with<00:00:24.269> dumbbells<00:00:25.039> resistance

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
exercises used to increase punch speed

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.900 
exercises used to increase punch speed
and<00:00:30.539> having<00:00:31.470> been<00:00:31.590> asked<00:00:32.040> about<00:00:32.250> adding

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
and having been asked about adding

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.760 
and having been asked about adding
resistance<00:00:33.329> to<00:00:33.480> punching<00:00:33.870> practice<00:00:34.290> to

increase<00:00:35.070> punch<00:00:35.370> speed<00:00:35.670> I<00:00:35.850> thought<00:00:36.510> I'd<00:00:36.630> share

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
increase punch speed I thought I'd share

with you my thoughts all strengthen
conditioning<00:00:39.570> training<00:00:39.870> should<00:00:40.020> follow<00:00:40.260> a

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
conditioning training should follow a

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.319 
conditioning training should follow a

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
to loading up actual Muay Thai

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.319 
to loading up actual Muay Thai
techniques<00:00:46.230> themselves<00:00:47.070> you<00:00:47.730> can't<00:00:48.030> get<00:00:48.180> much

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
techniques themselves you can't get much

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.229 
techniques themselves you can't get much
more<00:00:48.360> specific<00:00:48.780> than<00:00:49.079> that<00:00:49.250> but<00:00:50.250> a<00:00:50.579> word<00:00:51.120> of

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
more specific than that but a word of

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.479 
more specific than that but a word of
caution<00:00:51.480> too<00:00:52.410> much<00:00:52.590> load<00:00:52.860> will<00:00:53.010> distort<00:00:53.370> your

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
caution too much load will distort your

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.430 
caution too much load will distort your
finely-tuned<00:00:54.120> technique<00:00:54.600> and<00:00:54.840> heavy

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
finely-tuned technique and heavy

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.619 
finely-tuned technique and heavy
repetitions<00:00:56.070> will<00:00:56.280> anchor<00:00:56.520> wonky<00:00:57.090> form<00:00:57.390> and

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
repetitions will anchor wonky form and

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.619 
repetitions will anchor wonky form and
bad<00:00:58.170> habits<00:00:58.670> so<00:00:59.670> how<00:00:59.850> much<00:01:00.000> extra<00:01:00.390> resistance

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
bad habits so how much extra resistance

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.529 
bad habits so how much extra resistance
is<00:01:00.989> too<00:01:01.260> much<00:01:01.469> I<00:01:01.770> take<00:01:02.730> my<00:01:02.850> lead<00:01:03.030> from<00:01:03.180> research

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
is too much I take my lead from research

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.240 
is too much I take my lead from research
into<00:01:03.870> baseball<00:01:04.080> pitching<00:01:04.680> with<00:01:04.949> various

into baseball pitching with various
weight<00:01:05.460> balls<00:01:05.729> which<00:01:06.420> I<00:01:06.570> believe<00:01:06.840> in<00:01:06.990> the

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
weight balls which I believe in the

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.750 
weight balls which I believe in the
absence<00:01:07.439> of<00:01:07.590> punch<00:01:07.830> in<00:01:08.010> specific<00:01:08.460> research

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
absence of punch in specific research

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.940 
absence of punch in specific research

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
the skill of throwing a ball is

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.149 
the skill of throwing a ball is
representative<00:01:11.670> of<00:01:12.000> throwing<00:01:12.390> a<00:01:12.510> punch<00:01:12.720> to
