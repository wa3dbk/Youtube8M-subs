 there will be a review on the animated series ultimate 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.880
 spider-man or as we call it 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.340
 perfect spiderman 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:25.260
 I already adore this world the best 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.000
 cartoon series about spiderman this 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.519
 which left us goes to goddam year 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.340
 he was called just a spiderman and in 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:34.079
 Russia was shown the word completely 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.660
 recently revised recalled so 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:39.600
 tell childhood from measures the most such 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:43.410
 the best animated series about spiderman and 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.590
 on drawing on how would having there 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:49.590
 characters to all enemies 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:51.600
 allies bangs a spider and that's just 2012 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.820
 year we started a new series under 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.960
 the name is completely spiderman not 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.920
 I remember the premiere was 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:01.020
 April 1, 2012 and in Russia it 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.899
 showed somewhere through well, probably more 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.330
 than half a year in duplicate on the CTC channel I 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.900
 I still remember watched but started to watch it 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:12.030
 it was there with amateur rather a voice acting 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:15.119
 our own such series 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.689
 It begins with us 2 season has already come out 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:21.659
 currently season 2 and also 

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:24.810
 announced that looks like season 3 panache 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:27.600
 series of this good enough yes 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.280
 Better than I remember coming out in 2008 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.619
 some are looking too animated series there are two 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:35.430
 Season why you have not extended further 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:37.500
 I do not know why the truth is we have a series 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:41.549
 send eats and gums and how do we know that 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:45.290
 disney bought marvel here to me in this 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:48.570
 the fossa material is then more aimed at 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:50.490
 younger age and now 4 years old he 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:54.119
 so more seriously it is not enough 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.740
 joke here most jokes 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.899
 all sorts of spiderman sid constantly 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.300
 something joking there jokes lets go on 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:02.790
 screen sometimes appears as if this 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:05.010
 how to call it no sign of war of some kind 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.950
 spiderman attack with big head 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:10.590
 small body but i like that 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:14.010
 here there are characters such as 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.990
 for example, deadpool he, too, is constantly 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.230
 all sorts of jokes lets go but how 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:21.870
 everyone knows before deadpool such a joker 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:24.090
 always says a lot here just like 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.640
 times such here and show such here 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:29.220
 like the same appears small 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:32.910
 Spiderman is constant as such 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:36.180
 jokes let go so it's more 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.410
 focused on do not know but 10 years 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.810
