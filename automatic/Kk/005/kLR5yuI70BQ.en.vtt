00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
hey guys this is normal for normal TV

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.580 
hey guys this is normal for normal TV
calm<00:00:15.089> and<00:00:15.299> let's<00:00:15.780> have<00:00:15.990> a<00:00:16.109> look<00:00:16.320> at<00:00:16.440> the

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
calm and let's have a look at the

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.179 
calm and let's have a look at the
benchmark<00:00:17.039> scores<00:00:17.400> of<00:00:17.699> gionee<00:00:18.539> elife<00:00:18.960> e7<00:00:19.380> so

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
benchmark scores of gionee elife e7 so

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.580 
benchmark scores of gionee elife e7 so
we<00:00:20.369> have<00:00:20.460> installed<00:00:21.000> the<00:00:21.410> benchmarking<00:00:22.410> app

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
we have installed the benchmarking app

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.150 
we have installed the benchmarking app
from<00:00:23.250> an<00:00:23.519> to<00:00:23.699> do<00:00:23.880> so<00:00:24.330> we<00:00:24.600> will<00:00:24.630> test<00:00:24.990> it<00:00:25.170> out<00:00:25.320> so

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
from an to do so we will test it out so

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.689 
from an to do so we will test it out so
let's<00:00:26.760> open<00:00:27.000> the<00:00:27.300> app<00:00:27.480> and<00:00:27.510> see<00:00:28.080> this<00:00:28.260> course

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:28.699 
let's open the app and see this course

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:33.229 
let's open the app and see this course
so<00:00:29.699> let's<00:00:30.000> test<00:00:30.570> the<00:00:30.840> app<00:00:31.790> so<00:00:32.790> we<00:00:32.820> will<00:00:33.030> do<00:00:33.210> all

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
so let's test the app so we will do all

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:38.180 
so let's test the app so we will do all
the<00:00:33.570> tests<00:00:33.809> now<00:00:34.290> let's<00:00:34.559> start<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:34.920> test

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.990 

so<00:00:39.180> there<00:00:39.390> you<00:00:39.539> go<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:40.140> test<00:00:40.379> is<00:00:40.559> charted<00:00:41.000> so

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
so there you go the test is charted so

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.850 
so there you go the test is charted so
it<00:00:42.090> will<00:00:42.210> take<00:00:42.239> some<00:00:42.660> time<00:00:42.719> to<00:00:43.289> test<00:00:43.500> all<00:00:43.829> the

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
it will take some time to test all the

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.850 
it will take some time to test all the
aspects<00:00:44.760> of<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:45.030> phone<00:00:45.210> so<00:00:45.809> this<00:00:46.079> phone<00:00:46.589> has

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
aspects of the phone so this phone has

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.209 
aspects of the phone so this phone has
high<00:00:47.250> in<00:00:47.460> hardware<00:00:47.879> which<00:00:48.120> includes<00:00:48.980> 3gb<00:00:49.980> RAM

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
high in hardware which includes 3gb RAM

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.250 
high in hardware which includes 3gb RAM
and<00:00:50.550> then<00:00:50.699> you<00:00:50.879> have<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.329> strap<00:00:51.570> around<00:00:51.600> 800

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
and then you have the strap around 800

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.910 
and then you have the strap around 800
quad-core<00:00:52.500> processor<00:00:53.239> then<00:00:54.239> this<00:00:54.870> 3gb<00:00:55.710> RAM

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
quad-core processor then this 3gb RAM

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.180 
quad-core processor then this 3gb RAM
for<00:00:56.370> this<00:00:56.760> 32gb<00:00:57.479> variant<00:00:57.960> and<00:00:58.110> 2gb<00:00:58.500> RAM<00:00:58.829> for

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
for this 32gb variant and 2gb RAM for

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.079 
for this 32gb variant and 2gb RAM for
them<00:00:59.870> 16gb<00:01:00.870> variant<00:01:01.140> so<00:01:01.979> this<00:01:02.309> phone<00:01:02.610> is<00:01:02.940> a

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:03.089

high-end hardware phone so you might get

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.320 
high-end hardware phone so you might get
good<00:01:07.080> benchmarking<00:01:07.920> for<00:01:08.159> this<00:01:08.280> phone<00:01:08.520> so<00:01:09.000> this

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
good benchmarking for this phone so this

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.930 
good benchmarking for this phone so this
this<00:01:09.869> is<00:01:10.020> a<00:01:10.140> top<00:01:10.320> and<00:01:10.560> hardware<00:01:10.979> for<00:01:11.190> and<00:01:11.399> it

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:11.940 
this is a top and hardware for and it

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:13.790 
this is a top and hardware for and it
will<00:01:12.060> compete<00:01:12.420> with<00:01:12.479> other<00:01:12.929> phones<00:01:13.409> in<00:01:13.619> this

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:13.800 
will compete with other phones in this

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.700 
will compete with other phones in this
segment<00:01:14.310> as<00:01:14.640> well<00:01:14.820> so<00:01:15.390> let's<00:01:15.659> have<00:01:16.259> a<00:01:16.319> look<00:01:16.409> at

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
segment as well so let's have a look at

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.639 
segment as well so let's have a look at
the<00:01:16.920> scores<00:01:17.429> then<00:01:18.060> we<00:01:18.300> see<00:01:18.899> how<00:01:19.200> good<00:01:19.470> it

00:01:19.639 --> 00:01:19.649 
the scores then we see how good it

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:22.370 
the scores then we see how good it
performs<00:01:20.220> with<00:01:20.550> respect<00:01:21.030> to<00:01:21.210> other<00:01:21.450> phones

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
performs with respect to other phones

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.669 
performs with respect to other phones
which<00:01:22.619> have<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.130> snapdragon<00:01:23.700> processor<00:01:24.179> line

00:01:24.669 --> 00:01:24.679 
which have the snapdragon processor line

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:29.029 
which have the snapdragon processor line
note<00:01:25.679> 3<00:01:26.069> the<00:01:26.399> g2<00:01:26.850> and<00:01:27.179> the<00:01:27.270> Nexus<00:01:27.690> 5<00:01:27.929> so<00:01:28.710> let's

00:01:29.029 --> 00:01:29.039 
note 3 the g2 and the Nexus 5 so let's

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:32.139 
note 3 the g2 and the Nexus 5 so let's
wait<00:01:29.310> till<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:30.030> phone<00:01:30.330> testing<00:01:30.899> is<00:01:31.020> complete

00:01:32.139 --> 00:01:32.149 
wait till the phone testing is complete

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:35.090 
wait till the phone testing is complete
so<00:01:33.149> the<00:01:33.509> test<00:01:33.720> is<00:01:33.929> complete<00:01:34.350> and<00:01:34.500> you<00:01:34.619> can<00:01:34.800> see

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
so the test is complete and you can see

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.760 
so the test is complete and you can see
as<00:01:35.880> we<00:01:36.179> have<00:01:36.270> said<00:01:36.420> before<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:37.140> e7<00:01:37.590> has<00:01:37.740> a

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
as we have said before the e7 has a

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.740 
as we have said before the e7 has a
top-notch<00:01:38.369> hardware<00:01:38.819> and<00:01:39.000> you<00:01:39.360> can<00:01:39.509> see<00:01:39.720> the

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
top-notch hardware and you can see the

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.339 
top-notch hardware and you can see the
d7<00:01:40.409> is<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:41.159> best<00:01:41.429> phone<00:01:42.270> in<00:01:42.599> the<00:01:42.750> benchmarking

00:01:43.339 --> 00:01:43.349 
d7 is the best phone in the benchmarking

00:01:43.349 --> 00:01:45.589 
d7 is the best phone in the benchmarking
so<00:01:43.890> it<00:01:43.979> even<00:01:44.280> beats<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.789> note<00:01:44.970> 3<00:01:45.270> in<00:01:45.450> a

00:01:45.589 --> 00:01:45.599 
so it even beats the note 3 in a

00:01:45.599 --> 00:01:49.160 
so it even beats the note 3 in a
benchmark<00:01:46.080> scores<00:01:46.399> so<00:01:47.399> you<00:01:47.459> can<00:01:47.610> see<00:01:47.849> that<00:01:48.209> e<00:01:48.629> 7

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
benchmark scores so you can see that e 7

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.669 
benchmark scores so you can see that e 7
at<00:01:49.259> the<00:01:49.379> top<00:01:49.619> then<00:01:49.950> you<00:01:50.099> have<00:01:50.250> no<00:01:50.489> tree<00:01:50.849> then

00:01:51.669 --> 00:01:51.679 
at the top then you have no tree then

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:56.300 
at the top then you have no tree then
xperia<00:01:52.679> z<00:01:53.039> ultra<00:01:53.069> then<00:01:54.030> you<00:01:54.209> have<00:01:54.390> a<00:01:54.709> mi<00:01:55.709> 3<00:01:56.039> then

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
xperia z ultra then you have a mi 3 then

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.389 
xperia z ultra then you have a mi 3 then
the<00:01:56.700> g2's<00:01:57.119> and<00:01:57.450> other<00:01:57.720> other<00:01:58.080> phone<00:01:58.349> suffer<00:01:58.770> so
