00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.720
 it's time to talk about Internet picture 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:10.260
 this scene that made him famous there 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:14.280
 calm fishing with the family caught 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:17.240
 closing the fish out of the water 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.240
 It will be made so 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:24.779
 with that robot fish shark on girl 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.060
 this video has already been viewed more than 9 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.670
 millions of times on the internet 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.349
 but is it true that a scene 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.120
 of an action movie will be that in 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:37.860
 computer graphics in history 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:39.719
 the virtual detective will investigate the 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.820
 images were made in sheryl crow 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.370
 south carolina united states 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.030
 The girl who took the fright is called the room. 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.160
 brain 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.920
 she told the American tv network cnn 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.510
 that this was the first time in life 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.430
 that she has to answer 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.110
 so the stepfather was filming of 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.820
 The Shark Plate could very well have 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.070
 jumped on me because the tide 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.739
 I was uploading and they are already going out on tape online 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.739
 now what has been missing explain what is it 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:08.790
 a saltwater shark from the sea 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:11.490
 is doing on the canal in fresh water 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.140
 the explanation is in the species of shark 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.380
 flat head 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.420
 flat boring single species 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.240
 among all the sharks that penetrate 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.960
 freshwater and lives in fresh water Atherton 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.080
 female 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.610
 between these mouths to and from the puppy 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.009
 puppy stays there for a while 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:32.400
 a few months to a year until he 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:35.009
 grow and can go out to the high seas 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:38.729
 this species is one of the most aggressive 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:41.159
 it is common on our coast the flat head 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.350
 is a shark that exists not all almost 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:46.470
 all of our coast and assessed 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.670
 involved in non- reef attacks in the 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.729
 Brazilian Northeast 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.079
 after that scare was to pass the stepfather 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.840
 the whole family will never come close 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:57.509
 that tea thing is nothing 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.270
 they not only came near the water as 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:02.869
 behind the shark and recorded everything from 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:06.500
 new and post another internet video 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:08.479
 it worked out no shark did not show up 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:11.900
 therefore this video here in the history of 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:13.640
 it is not true that the family of the 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:19.840
 Sara guarantees that she will continue fishing 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:19.840
 see nothing is nothing anymore 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.380
 unequal
