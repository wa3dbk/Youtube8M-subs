00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
this rate is the first rate like I have

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.269 
this rate is the first rate like I have
two<00:00:27.390> ways<00:00:27.570> in<00:00:27.810> this<00:00:27.900> video<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:28.800> first<00:00:29.039> one<00:00:29.250> is

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
two ways in this video the first one is

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.250 
two ways in this video the first one is
actually<00:00:29.789> like<00:00:29.970> a<00:00:30.029> donate<00:00:30.539> your<00:00:30.750> space<00:00:31.080> I

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
actually like a donate your space I

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.260 
actually like a donate your space I
think<00:00:31.289> because<00:00:31.920> there's<00:00:32.219> Opie<00:00:32.730> King<00:00:33.000> stuff

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
think because there's Opie King stuff

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.389 
think because there's Opie King stuff
and<00:00:33.960> if<00:00:34.200> i'm<00:00:34.350> not<00:00:34.530> wrong<00:00:34.590> that's<00:00:35.130> like<00:00:35.370> a

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
and if i'm not wrong that's like a

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.690 
and if i'm not wrong that's like a
donate<00:00:35.910> their<00:00:36.120> stuff<00:00:36.360> although<00:00:37.020> this<00:00:37.700> base

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
donate their stuff although this base

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.369 
donate their stuff although this base
was<00:00:38.940> pretty<00:00:39.239> empty<00:00:39.390> but<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:39.899> stuff<00:00:40.170> were

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
was pretty empty but the stuff were

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.220 
was pretty empty but the stuff were
actually<00:00:40.739> pretty<00:00:40.860> good<00:00:41.129> because<00:00:42.050> in<00:00:43.050> my

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
actually pretty good because in my

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.110 
actually pretty good because in my
opinion<00:00:43.350> like<00:00:43.800> I<00:00:44.100> don't<00:00:44.370> know<00:00:44.550> like<00:00:44.640> I<00:00:44.850> haven't

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
opinion like I don't know like I haven't

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.010 
opinion like I don't know like I haven't
seen<00:00:45.239> that<00:00:45.390> many<00:00:46.399> donator<00:00:47.399> items<00:00:47.969> in<00:00:48.149> basis<00:00:48.690> so

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
seen that many donator items in basis so

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.790 
seen that many donator items in basis so
I<00:00:49.289> guess<00:00:49.920> it<00:00:50.100> was<00:00:50.250> kind<00:00:50.309> of<00:00:50.579> good<00:00:50.789> and<00:00:51.120> I<00:00:51.800> don't

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
I guess it was kind of good and I don't

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.680 
I guess it was kind of good and I don't
know<00:00:52.890> man<00:00:53.039> I<00:00:53.309> think<00:00:53.370> Oh<00:00:53.670> picking<00:00:54.059> is<00:00:54.180> a<00:00:54.210> donated

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
know man I think Oh picking is a donated

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.830 
know man I think Oh picking is a donated
rank<00:00:54.899> I'm<00:00:55.500> not<00:00:55.620> exactly<00:00:56.010> sure<00:00:56.160> but<00:00:56.660> anyways<00:00:57.660> we

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
rank I'm not exactly sure but anyways we

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.450 
rank I'm not exactly sure but anyways we
got<00:00:57.870> some<00:00:58.140> really<00:00:58.260> nice<00:00:58.530> stuff<00:00:58.559> so<00:00:59.160> that<00:00:59.340> was

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
got some really nice stuff so that was

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.180 
got some really nice stuff so that was
really<00:00:59.489> cool<00:00:59.879> I<00:01:00.809> have<00:01:01.350> to<00:01:01.620> raise<00:01:01.829> in<00:01:02.010> one

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
really cool I have to raise in one

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.179 
really cool I have to raise in one
videos<00:01:02.489> because<00:01:03.030> well<00:01:03.420> usually<00:01:04.140> LP<00:01:04.769> rates<00:01:05.010> are

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
videos because well usually LP rates are

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.530 
videos because well usually LP rates are
very<00:01:05.220> short<00:01:05.909> and<00:01:07.580> it<00:01:08.580> actually<00:01:08.820> depends<00:01:09.360> if

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
very short and it actually depends if

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.990 
very short and it actually depends if
it's<00:01:09.659> short<00:01:09.780> or<00:01:10.170> not<00:01:10.320> because<00:01:10.710> you<00:01:11.610> can<00:01:11.790> take

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
it's short or not because you can take

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.850 
it's short or not because you can take
everything<00:01:12.600> and<00:01:12.750> put<00:01:12.840> back<00:01:13.380> to<00:01:13.560> your<00:01:13.710> base

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
everything and put back to your base

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.260 
everything and put back to your base
which<00:01:14.130> i<00:01:14.280> think<00:01:14.340> is<00:01:14.549> pretty<00:01:14.790> pointless

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
which i think is pretty pointless

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.100 
which i think is pretty pointless
because<00:01:15.570> well<00:01:16.530> Opie<00:01:17.009> raids<00:01:17.220> are<00:01:17.400> like<00:01:17.610> I<00:01:18.110> don't

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
because well Opie raids are like I don't

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.620 
because well Opie raids are like I don't
know<00:01:19.170> man<00:01:19.320> it<00:01:19.500> just<00:01:19.530> I<00:01:20.009> don't<00:01:20.220> know<00:01:21.119> I<00:01:21.210> usually

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
know man it just I don't know I usually

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.270 
know man it just I don't know I usually
like<00:01:21.780> to<00:01:21.840> blow<00:01:22.110> up<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.439> stuff<00:01:22.680> because<00:01:23.100> I

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
like to blow up the stuff because I

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.890 
like to blow up the stuff because I
don't<00:01:23.490> want<00:01:23.520> anyone<00:01:24.150> to<00:01:24.299> have<00:01:24.390> that<00:01:24.600> stuff

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
don't want anyone to have that stuff

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.410 
don't want anyone to have that stuff
pretty<00:01:25.590> much<00:01:25.680> what<00:01:25.979> I<00:01:26.009> do<00:01:26.159> is<00:01:26.400> like<00:01:26.430> in<00:01:27.299> a

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
pretty much what I do is like in a

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:28.969 
pretty much what I do is like in a
second<00:01:27.780> you're<00:01:27.840> going<00:01:28.049> to<00:01:28.140> see<00:01:28.259> how<00:01:28.530> I<00:01:28.560> usually

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
second you're going to see how I usually

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.940 
second you're going to see how I usually
rate<00:01:29.400> Opie<00:01:29.880> países<00:01:30.329> which<00:01:30.540> is<00:01:30.720> not<00:01:30.900> donate<00:01:31.799> to

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
rate Opie países which is not donate to

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.940 
rate Opie países which is not donate to
space<00:01:32.250> I<00:01:33.180> usually<00:01:33.630> take<00:01:33.990> everything<00:01:34.650> from<00:01:34.799> a

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
space I usually take everything from a

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.710 
space I usually take everything from a
donated<00:01:35.460> space<00:01:35.700> and<00:01:35.909> if<00:01:36.000> it's<00:01:36.150> not<00:01:36.270> not<00:01:36.689> a

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
donated space and if it's not not a

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.660 
donated space and if it's not not a
donated<00:01:37.409> space<00:01:37.619> then<00:01:37.920> I<00:01:38.009> don't<00:01:38.189> take<00:01:38.400> the

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
donated space then I don't take the

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.350 
donated space then I don't take the
stuff<00:01:39.479> usually<00:01:39.780> and<00:01:40.220> so<00:01:41.220> it<00:01:41.340> is<00:01:41.369> really<00:01:41.610> chill

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
stuff usually and so it is really chill

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.090 
stuff usually and so it is really chill
and<00:01:42.659> cool<00:01:43.140> I<00:01:43.880> make<00:01:44.880> no<00:01:44.909> sense<00:01:45.390> but<00:01:45.860> anyways<00:01:46.860> it

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
and cool I make no sense but anyways it

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.800 
and cool I make no sense but anyways it
is<00:01:47.220> pretty<00:01:47.430> nice<00:01:47.670> right<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:48.060> first<00:01:48.299> one<00:01:48.540> but

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
is pretty nice right the first one but

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.420 
is pretty nice right the first one but
you're<00:01:48.990> gonna<00:01:49.110> see<00:01:49.350> a<00:01:49.380> second<00:01:49.829> rate<00:01:49.979> in<00:01:50.159> a<00:01:50.220> sec

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
you're gonna see a second rate in a sec

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.460 
you're gonna see a second rate in a sec
all<00:01:50.700> right<00:01:50.909> this<00:01:51.270> is<00:01:51.299> the<00:01:51.540> second<00:01:51.960> rate<00:01:52.170> and

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
all right this is the second rate and

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:53.960 
all right this is the second rate and
now<00:01:52.920> you're<00:01:53.100> going<00:01:53.220> to<00:01:53.280> see<00:01:53.430> how<00:01:53.579> I<00:01:53.610> usually

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
now you're going to see how I usually

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.260 
now you're going to see how I usually
rate<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:54.509> bases<00:01:54.960> which<00:01:55.680> is<00:01:55.829> a<00:01:55.860> very<00:01:56.270> stupid

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
rate the bases which is a very stupid

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.810 
rate the bases which is a very stupid
way<00:01:57.600> I<00:01:57.630> guess<00:01:57.960> you<00:01:58.409> can<00:01:58.619> say<00:01:58.890> because<00:01:59.729> I

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
way I guess you can say because I

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.420 
way I guess you can say because I
usually<00:02:00.210> like<00:02:00.360> to<00:02:00.420> blow<00:02:00.689> up<00:02:00.869> everything<00:02:01.430> here

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
usually like to blow up everything here

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.370 
usually like to blow up everything here
mushy<00:02:02.670> checking<00:02:03.119> if<00:02:03.240> the<00:02:03.270> stuff<00:02:03.600> our<00:02:03.780> donators

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
mushy checking if the stuff our donators

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.210 
mushy checking if the stuff our donators
or<00:02:04.560> not<00:02:04.740> but<00:02:05.040> it's<00:02:05.250> not<00:02:05.520> sadly<00:02:06.890> because<00:02:07.890> like<00:02:08.039> I

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
or not but it's not sadly because like I

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.190 
or not but it's not sadly because like I
don't<00:02:08.399> know<00:02:08.580> like<00:02:08.640> the<00:02:09.149> default<00:02:09.569> stuff<00:02:09.840> isn't

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
don't know like the default stuff isn't

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.500 
don't know like the default stuff isn't
really<00:02:10.500> valuable<00:02:11.129> for<00:02:11.310> me<00:02:11.610> because<00:02:12.390> I'm

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
really valuable for me because I'm

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.000 
really valuable for me because I'm
already<00:02:12.660> pretty<00:02:12.989> rich<00:02:13.290> on<00:02:13.470> the<00:02:13.590> server

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
already pretty rich on the server

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.399 
already pretty rich on the server
only<00:02:14.670> things<00:02:14.909> which<00:02:15.120> I<00:02:15.269> if<00:02:15.569> I<00:02:15.750> want<00:02:15.959> anything

00:02:16.399 --> 00:02:16.409 
only things which I if I want anything

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:18.770 
only things which I if I want anything
from<00:02:16.530> a<00:02:16.620> radius<00:02:17.099> like<00:02:17.280> a<00:02:17.310> donated<00:02:17.939> stuff<00:02:18.150> which

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
from a radius like a donated stuff which

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.179 
from a radius like a donated stuff which
is<00:02:18.810> solving<00:02:19.260> the<00:02:19.349> first<00:02:19.590> raid<00:02:19.829> which<00:02:20.010> I<00:02:20.129> took

00:02:20.179 --> 00:02:20.189 
is solving the first raid which I took

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:22.729 
is solving the first raid which I took
pretty<00:02:20.610> much<00:02:20.700> everything<00:02:21.420> and<00:02:21.629> this<00:02:22.530> way

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739 
pretty much everything and this way

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:24.860 
pretty much everything and this way
these<00:02:22.890> I<00:02:23.040> can<00:02:23.220> on<00:02:23.340> donators<00:02:24.000> and<00:02:24.269> there<00:02:24.780> was

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
these I can on donators and there was

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.020 
these I can on donators and there was
like<00:02:25.019> no<00:02:25.200> armor<00:02:25.620> for<00:02:25.829> some<00:02:26.010> reasons<00:02:26.370> there

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030

take everything because I had quite a

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:03.140 
take everything because I had quite a
lot<00:03:01.079> in<00:03:01.230> my<00:03:01.379> base<00:03:02.190> already<00:03:02.400> and<00:03:02.730> I<00:03:02.879> was<00:03:03.000> like

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
lot in my base already and I was like

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.830 
lot in my base already and I was like
ours<00:03:03.359> doesn't<00:03:03.599> matter<00:03:03.840> and<00:03:04.519> here's<00:03:05.519> another

ours doesn't matter and here's another

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.129 
ours doesn't matter and here's another
lag<00:03:06.840> and<00:03:07.579> this<00:03:08.579> server<00:03:08.819> kind<00:03:09.269> of<00:03:09.420> has<00:03:09.569> lots<00:03:10.019> of

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:10.139 
lag and this server kind of has lots of

00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:13.009 
lag and this server kind of has lots of
lags<00:03:10.530> I<00:03:10.950> did<00:03:11.250> it<00:03:11.519> just<00:03:11.790> has<00:03:11.970> like<00:03:12.000> as<00:03:12.420> those

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
like a few seconds and it happened so

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:23.990

just<00:03:26.519> like<00:03:26.730> boom<00:03:27.060> lag<00:03:27.540> and<00:03:27.900> then<00:03:28.590> it<00:03:28.769> stops

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
just like boom lag and then it stops

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.640 
just like boom lag and then it stops
like<00:03:29.579> the<00:03:29.730> server<00:03:29.970> like<00:03:30.239> please<00:03:30.810> leashes<00:03:31.379> like
