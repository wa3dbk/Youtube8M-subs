it's<00:00:18.210> a<00:00:18.270> little<00:00:18.300> bit<00:00:18.630> but<00:00:18.869> some<00:00:19.080> of<00:00:19.170> these

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
it's a little bit but some of these

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.200 
it's a little bit but some of these

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.000 

and<00:01:44.460> then<00:01:44.670> we<00:01:44.820> have<00:01:45.350> half<00:01:46.350> overclocked

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:47.010 
and then we have half overclocked

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:50.810 
and then we have half overclocked
pattern<00:01:48.170> how<00:01:49.170> we<00:01:49.230> completed<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:49.980> other<00:01:50.130> half

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820

let<00:01:51.690> me<00:01:51.780> trimmed<00:01:52.050> up<00:01:52.200> across<00:01:53.070> the<00:01:53.340> center<00:01:53.670> I'm

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
let me trimmed up across the center I'm

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.520 
let me trimmed up across the center I'm
going<00:01:53.940> to<00:01:54.000> take<00:01:54.150> it<00:01:54.300> to<00:01:54.420> that<00:01:54.450> when<00:01:55.080> I<00:01:55.110> put<00:01:55.440> it

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
going to take it to that when I put it

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.010 
going to take it to that when I put it
together<00:01:55.850> and<00:01:56.850> see<00:01:57.120> how<00:01:57.300> good<00:01:57.480> a<00:01:57.540> joint<00:01:57.870> we

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
together and see how good a joint we

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.570 
together and see how good a joint we
have<00:01:58.880> we<00:01:59.880> have<00:02:00.060> a<00:02:00.090> very<00:02:00.510> excellent<00:02:00.780> joint<00:02:01.580> so

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:02.580 
have we have a very excellent joint so

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.140 
have we have a very excellent joint so
now<00:02:02.730> we're<00:02:02.880> going<00:02:03.000> to<00:02:03.060> turn<00:02:03.420> it<00:02:03.630> over

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:05.150 
now we're going to turn it over

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.030 
now we're going to turn it over
amantha<00:02:06.150> move<00:02:06.510> there<00:02:06.870> are<00:02:06.960> some<00:02:07.140> of<00:02:07.260> the<00:02:07.380> newer

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:08.040 
amantha move there are some of the newer

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:11.330 
amantha move there are some of the newer
thing<00:02:08.869> so<00:02:09.869> the<00:02:10.050> serie<00:02:10.350> packs<00:02:10.710> a<00:02:10.860> joint<00:02:11.130> real

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
thing so the serie packs a joint real

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:23.800 
thing so the serie packs a joint real
well<00:02:14.780> and<00:02:15.780> this<00:02:15.930> will<00:02:16.200> pay<00:02:16.440> a<00:02:16.470> little<00:02:16.709> scissors

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.650 

bring<00:02:24.810> the<00:02:24.930> joints<00:02:25.260> together<00:02:26.209> that's<00:02:27.209> a<00:02:27.360> great

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
bring the joints together that's a great

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:36.610 
bring the joints together that's a great

it's<00:02:52.200> not<00:02:52.380> right<00:02:52.620> we<00:02:52.830> can<00:02:53.010> make<00:02:53.190> little

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
it's not right we can make little
