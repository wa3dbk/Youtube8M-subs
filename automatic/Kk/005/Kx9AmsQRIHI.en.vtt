planning on getting a betta fish but I
was<00:01:58.380> going<00:01:58.590> to<00:01:58.740> get<00:01:58.860> a<00:01:58.890> bigger<00:01:59.219> tank<00:01:59.579> and<00:01:59.850> this

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
was going to get a bigger tank and this

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.350 
was going to get a bigger tank and this
is<00:02:00.960> obviously<00:02:01.500> what<00:02:02.399> I<00:02:02.430> picked<00:02:02.729> out<00:02:02.850> and<00:02:03.149> I

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
is obviously what I picked out and I

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.090 
is obviously what I picked out and I
think<00:02:03.420> it<00:02:03.689> works<00:02:03.869> perfectly<00:02:04.320> for<00:02:04.649> her<00:02:04.680> she<00:02:05.009> has

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
think it works perfectly for her she has

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.029 
think it works perfectly for her she has
tons<00:02:05.310> of<00:02:05.460> space<00:02:05.520> and<00:02:06.380> so<00:02:07.380> that's<00:02:07.560> kind<00:02:07.860> of<00:02:07.950> a

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
tons of space and so that's kind of a

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.580 
tons of space and so that's kind of a
little<00:02:08.250> story<00:02:09.500> unexpected<00:02:10.790> kind<00:02:11.790> of<00:02:11.879> little

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
little story unexpected kind of little

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.320 
little story unexpected kind of little
background<00:02:13.590> and<00:02:14.220> the<00:02:14.520> neon<00:02:14.760> tetras<00:02:15.120> don't

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
background and the neon tetras don't

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:16.970 
background and the neon tetras don't
really<00:02:15.540> have<00:02:15.660> a<00:02:15.690> story<00:02:16.080> they<00:02:16.410> were<00:02:16.470> kind<00:02:16.800> of

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
really have a story they were kind of

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.670 
really have a story they were kind of
just<00:02:17.640> added<00:02:18.150> in<00:02:18.330> when<00:02:18.600> I<00:02:18.630> knew<00:02:19.350> I<00:02:19.380> was<00:02:19.500> gonna

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
just added in when I knew I was gonna

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.860 
just added in when I knew I was gonna
get<00:02:19.920> this<00:02:20.130> bigger<00:02:20.370> tank<00:02:20.700> because<00:02:21.240> I<00:02:21.570> thought

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
get this bigger tank because I thought

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.640 
get this bigger tank because I thought
that<00:02:22.530> one<00:02:23.100> fish<00:02:23.400> would<00:02:23.730> be<00:02:24.140> a<00:02:25.140> little<00:02:25.410> lonely

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
that one fish would be a little lonely

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.520 
that one fish would be a little lonely
in<00:02:25.890> this<00:02:26.160> gigantic<00:02:26.670> tank<00:02:27.030> for<00:02:27.900> one<00:02:28.080> fish<00:02:28.320> so<00:02:28.350> I

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
in this gigantic tank for one fish so I

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.970 
in this gigantic tank for one fish so I
got<00:02:28.710> three<00:02:29.580> little<00:02:30.230> tetras<00:02:31.230> and<00:02:31.650> they<00:02:31.830> don't

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
got three little tetras and they don't

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.950 
got three little tetras and they don't
have<00:02:32.130> names<00:02:32.370> and<00:02:32.820> I<00:02:33.210> probably<00:02:33.570> won't<00:02:33.810> be

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:33.960 
have names and I probably won't be

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.560 
have names and I probably won't be
naming<00:02:34.290> them<00:02:34.440> but<00:02:34.710> you<00:02:34.860> know<00:02:35.210> so<00:02:36.210> those<00:02:36.390> are

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
naming them but you know so those are

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:39.200 
naming them but you know so those are
just<00:02:36.750> the<00:02:37.020> three<00:02:37.560> tetras<00:02:38.400> and<00:02:38.670> then<00:02:38.820> I<00:02:38.850> still

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.210 
just the three tetras and then I still

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:40.790 
just the three tetras and then I still
have<00:02:39.240> my<00:02:39.570> snail<00:02:40.080> down<00:02:40.410> there

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
have my snail down there

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.360 
have my snail down there
Andy<00:02:41.670> Moss<00:02:41.850> ball<00:02:42.530> so<00:02:43.530> they're<00:02:43.800> all<00:02:43.920> doing<00:02:44.190> good

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
Andy Moss ball so they're all doing good

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.510 
Andy Moss ball so they're all doing good
the<00:02:44.580> filter<00:02:45.000> is<00:02:45.300> top<00:02:45.840> thin<00:02:46.200> 10<00:02:46.710> or<00:02:47.010> something

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
the filter is top thin 10 or something

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.060 
the filter is top thin 10 or something
like<00:02:47.670> that<00:02:47.730> and<00:02:48.240> it<00:02:48.960> works<00:02:49.170> really<00:02:49.440> good<00:02:49.560> and<00:02:49.950> I

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
like that and it works really good and I

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:52.010 
like that and it works really good and I
can't<00:02:50.370> even<00:02:50.490> hear<00:02:50.820> it<00:02:50.970> so<00:02:51.270> it'll<00:02:51.900> work

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.020 
can't even hear it so it'll work

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:54.140 
can't even hear it so it'll work
perfectly<00:02:52.530> in<00:02:52.800> my<00:02:52.830> room<00:02:53.310> so<00:02:53.610> now<00:02:53.790> I'll<00:02:53.970> give

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
perfectly in my room so now I'll give

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:55.940 
perfectly in my room so now I'll give
you<00:02:54.240> a<00:02:54.300> quick<00:02:54.480> tape<00:02:54.750> tour<00:02:55.020> here<00:02:55.440> I<00:02:55.470> have<00:02:55.710> my

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
you a quick tape tour here I have my

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:57.440 
you a quick tape tour here I have my
thermometer<00:02:56.340> at<00:02:56.700> the<00:02:56.790> same<00:02:57.000> one<00:02:57.150> I've<00:02:57.300> always

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
thermometer at the same one I've always

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:58.790 
thermometer at the same one I've always
had<00:02:57.720> and<00:02:58.020> the<00:02:58.080> water<00:02:58.230> temperature<00:02:58.410> is<00:02:58.770> a

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 
had and the water temperature is a

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.140 
had and the water temperature is a
little<00:02:58.860> high<00:02:59.220> I<00:02:59.250> think<00:02:59.670> it's<00:02:59.790> just<00:02:59.910> because

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
little high I think it's just because

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.220 
little high I think it's just because
that<00:03:01.140> I've<00:03:01.380> had<00:03:01.590> my<00:03:01.830> heat<00:03:02.130> lamp<00:03:02.340> on<00:03:02.550> and<00:03:03.230> pretty

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
that I've had my heat lamp on and pretty

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.650 
that I've had my heat lamp on and pretty
much<00:03:04.440> for<00:03:04.650> the<00:03:04.740> whole<00:03:04.920> video<00:03:05.070> so<00:03:05.640> I<00:03:05.940> will<00:03:06.450> turn

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
much for the whole video so I will turn

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.320 
much for the whole video so I will turn
that<00:03:06.810> off<00:03:07.020> after<00:03:07.680> the<00:03:08.460> spin<00:03:08.700> here<00:03:09.030> I<00:03:09.060> have<00:03:09.300> a

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
that off after the spin here I have a

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.650 
that off after the spin here I have a
small<00:03:09.570> Amazon<00:03:10.230> sword<00:03:10.650> plant<00:03:11.040> and<00:03:11.400> I<00:03:12.150> just<00:03:12.480> put
