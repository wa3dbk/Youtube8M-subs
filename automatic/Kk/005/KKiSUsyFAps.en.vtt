that I look at and learn from absolutely
but<00:04:10.200> this<00:04:10.410> is<00:04:10.620> not<00:04:10.770> for<00:04:11.040> the<00:04:11.130> weak<00:04:11.160> I<00:04:11.610> mean<00:04:12.150> I

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239 
but this is not for the weak I mean I

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:13.699 
but this is not for the weak I mean I
mentioned<00:04:12.600> the<00:04:12.690> large<00:04:12.900> sample<00:04:13.320> day<00:04:13.440> nine

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
mentioned the large sample day nine

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:16.010 
mentioned the large sample day nine
percent<00:04:14.160> make<00:04:14.370> it<00:04:14.520> through<00:04:14.760> one<00:04:15.720> hundred

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:16.020 
percent make it through one hundred

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:18.530 
percent make it through one hundred
percent<00:04:16.080> follow<00:04:16.590> a<00:04:16.680> certain<00:04:16.919> pattern<00:04:17.390> but<00:04:18.390> you

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:18.540 
percent follow a certain pattern but you

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:20.840 
percent follow a certain pattern but you
still<00:04:18.600> see<00:04:19.080> people<00:04:19.440> trying<00:04:19.650> to<00:04:20.010> fight<00:04:20.310> against

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:20.850 
still see people trying to fight against

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:23.470 
still see people trying to fight against
what<00:04:21.510> i<00:04:21.540> think<00:04:21.810> is<00:04:21.870> overwhelming<00:04:22.500> data<00:04:22.710> and

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:23.480 
what i think is overwhelming data and

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:26.930 
what i think is overwhelming data and
and<00:04:24.480> those<00:04:25.140> who<00:04:25.350> aren't<00:04:25.680> are<00:04:26.010> doing<00:04:26.790> really

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
and those who aren't are doing really

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:29.300 
and those who aren't are doing really
well<00:04:27.180> so<00:04:28.020> I'm<00:04:28.169> optimistic<00:04:28.380> that<00:04:28.919> there's<00:04:29.250> a

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
well so I'm optimistic that there's a

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:34.730 
well so I'm optimistic that there's a
way<00:04:29.610> forward<00:04:30.300> it<00:04:31.070> takes<00:04:32.210> dramatic<00:04:33.740> changes

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 
way forward it takes dramatic changes

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:37.100 
way forward it takes dramatic changes
and<00:04:34.979> a<00:04:35.190> commitment<00:04:35.550> to<00:04:35.850> reinvent<00:04:36.630> who<00:04:36.810> you<00:04:36.930> are

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110 
and a commitment to reinvent who you are

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.740 
and a commitment to reinvent who you are
not<00:04:37.650> a<00:04:37.680> not<00:04:38.280> a<00:04:38.310> little<00:04:38.610> innovation<00:04:39.150> on<00:04:39.270> what<00:04:39.300> a
