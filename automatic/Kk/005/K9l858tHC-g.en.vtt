00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:09.750
 hello everyone here calipso gamers 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.540
 welcome to a new video today 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:15.120
 I bring the dolphin emulator an emulator 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.369
 for rim club and wii computer post 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.020
 with which you can play and artigas deals 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.539
 with solÃ¡ showed computer 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.490
 first of all tell you that you need a 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.369
 order pretty good to emulate these 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.080
 these two consoles so good ya 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.929
 will leave in the video information the 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.489
 minimum system requirements and good 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.950
 we arrived the first thing would be to enter the 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.110
 official page of the emulator that also 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.260
 I would leave it information but good is 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.660
 the dolfina search conclude if it does not come out 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.780
 the first one is valid here we have the section 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.370
 of downloads we have the last ones 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.500
 pressures that have forgiven the 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.610
 latest versions that have come out 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:53.079
 we will load the last one that would be 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.749
 the one above and we have 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:01:00.280
 the download for 32 bit windows and 

00:00:55.749 --> 00:01:02.079
 for 4 bits for mac which how many 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.269
 bits and has our computer then 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:07.530
 you can see it giving start panel 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:10.920
 control and then to the system 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.840
 and here you have mine is 32 bits like this 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.320
 what do you see if we download the one we 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.320
 It is convenient to balear once the download 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:21.509
 is downloaded into this rare file that 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.220
 unzip and unload this folder 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.110
 here we have already the file was the 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:29.490
 program that to start it we give two 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:31.560
 clicks and already opens us worth one thing 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.890
 games you can download the good ones and 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.960
 find these two pages where the 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.630
 people posting it enough games there 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.740
 quite a few tabs and also think that 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.560
 people also gets quite the 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.270
 games will be downloaded from 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.310
 torrent I told you the above video 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.250
 you can download it from the program 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.710
 auto network that goes very well and good 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.110
 download and there they occupy enough all 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:58.890
 games for example this is the 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:02:01.830
 pokemon collision for 21 occupies but 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.869
 well a gigabyte with 35 is not much 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:05.850
 value occupies more also if it is that 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:08.700
 to emulate the web it takes even more 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.960
 computer power that startup is worth 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.450
 he downloads it 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:14.520
 they were files in point and they are also 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:18.830
 this type of file is called 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:20.940
 fm files will be ranking and good 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:24.750
 we started the emulator like I did 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:26.310
 before and you can give him to look for the games 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.990
 that you have for example there was a desk 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.630
 and how do I have the game on the desk 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:33.180
 you can use this screen already the game that 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:36.480
 I have then well I will explain 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:39.420
 how to set a little bit above the 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.250
 emulator we have here the father 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.490
 you can connect to a command to make it 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:46.710
 more comfortable I recommend you connect a 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:48.720
 command by usb to the computer because if not 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:50.280
 do not love us, I do not believe or that 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.130
 may or may not yes that can be by keyboard 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.690
 but it will be pretty boring to tell you that 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:57.780
 how good these controls do not cost much 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:59.670
 if you do not have and they are very useful 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:04.260
 to play all kinds of games or in the 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:07.379
 computer and it would be good to connect him 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:09.420
 he ordered to choose here the name of 

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:11.610
 your command mine sixty gates or 'the 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:14.310
 action 'and here would be configure buttons 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.060
 of the command once we have configured 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.959
 the buttons 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:22.019
 we could for example command we would look at 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:24.329
 save and once it's saved it 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:27.690
 you have loved and ok you would have already configured 

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:29.610
 the command for console 21 then for 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:32.220
 wii tell you that this is something pretty 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:34.590
 interesting you can buy the bar 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:36.930
 this one that is put over used of the 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.370
 official console and a bar that 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.409
 puts on the television to detect 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:42.269
 the movement you can buy the bar 

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:44.519
 and a command and to be able to play the computer 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:46.530
 with the boy with the bar with the command 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:50.489
 wireless wii by using 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:53.010
 bluetooth and also has the advantage that the 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:55.889
 wii that uses this emulator makes the 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:58.650
 Wii and get in full HD 1080p thing 

00:03:55.889 --> 00:04:00.329
 the wing itself has so and you 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:03.060
 I say if you have a good computer because 

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:04.889
 I already tell you that my girlfriend is not going almost 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:07.650
 no game with the emulator of the eu and 

00:04:04.889 --> 00:04:08.699
 if you have a powerful computer a 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:10.319
 powerful computer 

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:13.170
 I recommend is what you 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:14.430
 the command and the bar that and well 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:16.919
 here to all you want 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:20.009
 quietly with better quality still 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:21.930
 by then it would be one with another command 

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:25.680
 can not do it would be to choose the wiimote 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:27.240
 and configure will connect the device 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:30.479
 by bluetooth I do not know what I do not know what good 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:32.910
 configure it and aix then we have the 

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:36.449
 graphics for how you want it to appear 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:38.250
 the game I have put that does not put in 

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:41.729
 full screen to record this video 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:44.430
 and you can put it in format 

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:46.320
 16 9 that is like more stretched more shape 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:48.479
 rectangular or this that would be like 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:49.710
 automatic square or automatic 

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:52.590
 will depend the quality that you have put 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:54.090
 here I also put the maximum because 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:56.970
 I already tell you the club's pretty well 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:58.830
 there's no luxury either but it gives me 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:02.460
 pretty good so I can afford 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:04.979
 put this up for the improvements to a 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:08.039
 advanced hacks is everything you look at 

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:11.270
 you and new explaining everything and 

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:14.600
 well the shoulders would be that buoy 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:15.980
 they teach an example of love two clicks and 

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:17.540
 today he has set up a screen for 

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:19.100
 make the appointment anyway once 

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:20.310
 inside you can stretch it like you 

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:24.500
 you want 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:24.500
 well here I have the command has a little 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:35.900
 tell you that thank you very much the truth is 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:38.360
 that I did not think we were going to get 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:39.949
 so many visits with the videos like that 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:42.259
 I'm surprised thank you very much everyone 

00:05:39.949 --> 00:05:46.360
 those who have seen I am his son and 

00:05:42.259 --> 00:05:46.360
 so well there we go 

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:03.150
 sea 

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:06.590
 [Music] 

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:08.390
 more now that I'm recording going even worse 

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:11.050
 the sound of truth that fails quite a 

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:11.050
 me at least 

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:18.249
 it's not like I have a super super computer 

00:06:16.249 --> 00:06:21.560
 modern yes but good I have a laptop 

00:06:18.249 --> 00:06:26.060
 normalito of 3 gigas of ram 

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:28.250
 320 GB of hard disk graphics will not be 

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:30.630
 of a giga or 500 new good 

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:32.700
 we would be here 

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:35.160
 and we can start from what 

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:37.380
 you want to save the game one you 

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:41.060
 I would save alone and if you can not give it I think 

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:41.060
 what good file 

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:46.340
 [Music] 

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:48.680
 it would be that it keeps the state and arn areas 

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:49.670
 ura some regulators where depends if 

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:51.770
 you are going to play more than one game 

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:54.050
 different games because you can save 

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:56.120
 each game in one thing is worth and then already 

00:06:54.050 --> 00:07:01.100
 yes then and I would start jce would give that 

00:06:56.120 --> 00:07:03.470
 file would be emulation load state and 

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:05.990
 for example 6 saved is in the slot 

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:08.150
 1 the download have been slot 1 already 

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:09.560
 I would start where you left as equal 

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:11.690
 you also do not need to save anything and if 

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:14.390
 more coming out and coming back will be saved 

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:15.950
 or simply when you take you go 

00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:17.150
 happening the adventure of the game will be 

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:20.020
 saving and I also guess that it 

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:22.850
 save once you enter then 

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:24.200
 good has been everything will not be now 

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:26.150
 playing as if you want me to upload a 

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:29.690
 gameplay playing a game in which I 

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:30.920
 you say and upload some fancy I do not know 

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:35.150
 I hope you liked it 

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:37.820
 guys tell you the dolphin emulator is 

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:39.620
 very well I'm worth that I think with a 

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:41.660
 very good computer and I would not go very 

00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:43.460
 well in games problems I say if you have 

00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:45.650
 a good computer the truth that is 

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:48.190
 fantastic this can be played at a club 

00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:51.180
 I 'm already here on the same computer 

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:53.860

 something to help you nothing but good if 

00:07:57.910 --> 00:08:04.090
 you do those things something better and good 

00:08:00.490 --> 00:08:10.070
 dismiss a greeting and goodbye 

00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:10.070
