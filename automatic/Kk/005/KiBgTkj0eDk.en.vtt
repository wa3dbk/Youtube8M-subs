00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
think we can do it I think we can we've

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:21.570 
think we can do it I think we can we've
done<00:01:11.939> if<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.150> killers<00:01:12.450> in<00:01:12.630> our<00:01:12.720> path

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:21.580 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:23.760 

we're<00:01:22.360> gonna<00:01:22.450> be<00:01:22.540> making<00:01:22.690> a<00:01:23.110> shepherd's<00:01:23.560> pie

which it's classic Aldi family favourite
I<00:01:25.810> think<00:01:26.110> with<00:01:26.320> a<00:01:26.350> bit<00:01:26.530> of<00:01:26.590> lamb<00:01:26.860> and<00:01:27.310> we'll<00:01:27.580> set

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:27.730 
I think with a bit of lamb and we'll set

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:29.490 
I think with a bit of lamb and we'll set
some<00:01:27.850> eggplant<00:01:28.330> and<00:01:28.720> then<00:01:29.170> we'll<00:01:29.290> go<00:01:29.350> have

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:29.500 
some eggplant and then we'll go have

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:30.990 
some eggplant and then we'll go have
some<00:01:29.650> greens<00:01:29.890> on<00:01:30.040> the<00:01:30.070> side<00:01:30.340> so<00:01:30.610> I<00:01:30.640> think<00:01:30.700> some

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.000 
some greens on the side so I think some

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.520 
some greens on the side so I think some
broccolini<00:01:31.420> with<00:01:31.630> a<00:01:31.690> lovely<00:01:31.870> sauce<00:01:32.200> delicious

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.530
