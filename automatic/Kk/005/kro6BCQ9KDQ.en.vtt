00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 hello everyone my name is Sasha today 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.180
 have you finally large and Alex 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.400
 our alex is so big that he is already 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.120
 Fully into the frame does not fit but only her 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.340
 half 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.230
 well let me tell you 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:14.519
 more about her that immediately rushes to 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.949
 eyes so this is what it is a little bit 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.949
 voluminous namely her voluminous hair 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.830
 voluminous t-shirt and small volume on 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:25.560
 but his legs are not so visible so 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.720
 on her hair is the amount of people in front 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.519
 the sides here here is the volume behind on 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.500
 the head volume of the coin is such 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.489
 Here voluminous hair that come down from 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.219
 her shirt 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:38.370
 also bulky hair on her left 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:41.640
 hand and sleep the river and now yes on the left hand 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.850
 in front where they end there also 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.980
 she has a volume right here for T-shirts 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:50.489
 here here is a small amount on the sleeves 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.590
 there is and here here is another small volume 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.210
 on his feet he is quite small literally 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.190
 maybe millimeter maybe even 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.430
 less and here it is practically and not 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.020
 in sight but he is also there is the same 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.340
 small volume and as you know now 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.610
 many sweep in the arc 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:08.340
 just closes the top and the bands and tea 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.520
 it turns out how the volume this volume is on 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.170
 here this here stripes this here 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.970
 squares here it is all here so here 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.000
 stuck on top of it all seems to be considered 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.840
 well, too voluminous but I think that more 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.020
 such a volume 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.490
 I made my hair like this 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:26.549
 it and even show you when to do so 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.619
 in the next video by the way hair 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:31.140
 here you can see here what is painted here 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.270
 further than this volume goes all business 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.759
 in that I painted the head itself 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.820
 there is a head sweep bent contribution to 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.950
 cube painted her pixels and so to 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.329
 debtors hair to those made another 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.210
 hair scan 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.979
 made them so voluminous and then 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.659
 already that the same colored 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.820
 and already glued on top I think 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.530
 glue do not glue hair spout 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.470
 I decided to determine because they are the voice 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.540
 walked they must hold on to the head also 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.460
 I can see that I stuck my eyes on top 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.219
 where speaking laid out in contact 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.080
 a picture of this eye I blurred it 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:06.630
 then peeled off and glued 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.369
 you have also got a little dirty here 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.530
 green but that's nothing because she 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.630
 everything was not very convenient to paint because 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.810
 that colors are bright yellow green very 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:17.160
 easy everything gets dirty and so what again 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.660
 pony i will say but she is like this 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.850
 pixel style principle as it was 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.230
 with steve but steve also painted 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:24.390
 hands learn such tons 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.190
 yet here the square and go crazy and lazy 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.150
 alexa did not tell me so 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.390
 it seemed that it looked like that 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:32.250
 pretty pretty by the way I'm 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.080
 I thought for a long time to do or not to do 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.660
 Alex moved all done so 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.190
 immovable say why agile alex 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.530
 you and here these different all sorts of bends on 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.209
 feet they are very big there is a gap and even 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.740
 on small figures and think for what 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:45.990
 large gaps in such would be from 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:47.730
 the slab patterns that's exactly on the folds on 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:49.620
 so big alex so I thought 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.459
 so will not be very nice and decided 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.920
 make this one 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:54.720
 volumetric alex only volumetric alex here 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.670
 So here are moving hands I made them as 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.700
 the usual there and signs such here allowances 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.860
 and stuck them under my head and that's why 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.060
 teach rub we move so here in 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.870
 principle so here she can put 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.450
 steve's hand 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.820
 inside here so here they are painted too 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:12.570
 there are yellow green 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:14.940
 standard to here are her palms are made here 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:17.280
 so here they are also a little bit the volume is me 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:19.200
 stuck here on a square like this 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.220
 here is the top of this is here by 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:24.090
 rectangle 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:27.840
 redhead here at first I all glued the 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:30.810
 sea ​​has stuck hairs in her head and 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:33.120
 legs then i painted it all earth 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.530
 joined in one figure because and not 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.670
 love tell then it's still in 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.739
 sweep because then when 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:40.709
 glue it just stays like that 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:43.080
 huge prints on all white colors 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:44.850
 after let's say on those yellows 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.510
 the yellow color remains huge prints 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:47.370
 green 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.739
 just so we get uncomfortable 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.459
 therefore it is not easier to paint more precisely there is no 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:51.840
 neither easier to fold 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:54.239
 and then paint if it's easier for you 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.950
 on the contrary, then do so well, I don’t know how 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:57.480
 so you need to do with gloves or something 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:59.910
 because i have fingerprints 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.560
 stayed just tough even when i 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:03.480
 just stuck with me here here 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.700
 such a whole hand was in prints and 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:07.410
 just all over the top to decorate your face too 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:09.660
 by the way the prominent sulphate is colored once more 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:13.210
 I found almost everything was in prints 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:15.490
 creepy in orange greens just awful 

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:17.530
 many of her here and so are painted here 

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:20.080
 these here and shoes here here and to such 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:21.970
 here is a small amount of leg here here 

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:24.010
 Here are these voluminous things painted 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:24.730
 paint and generally all Alex painted 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:27.130
 paint 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:28.900
 besides here many here i don't 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:31.300
 it was completely black paint with no 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:33.730
 droplets it was not visible that she painted 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:35.380
 felt-tip old man it looks 

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:37.120
 pretty good but close enough 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:39.400
 still ugly because here is the paper 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:41.260
 hesitated appeared what such here 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:44.320
 marker pens 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:45.940
 so here is general, it turned out so beautiful 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:47.650
 felt-tip pen here here too on top on 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:50.170
 wedge here at all on how something bad happened 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:53.230
 the paint still dripped and everything else 

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:54.730
 painted with paint and it seems to me 

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:58.150
 that red is the most beautiful thing to steal 

00:04:54.730 --> 00:05:00.070
 it turns out pretty nice so what 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:02.080
 Well guys on this, it seems, I'm all 

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:04.420
 He said that it was interesting to get sick and 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:06.490
 Duma is still a couple of video on it, I 

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:08.740
 I will show as did the volume of say 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:10.000
 hair or something else there she is 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:10.870
 do you like if this is the case then put 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.370
 huskies 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:17.710
 in height it is 32 centimeters that is 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:21.130
 from the bottom to the from the very end but trouble 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:24.010
 head rings 32 centimeters wide i 

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:25.810
 not measured but alex usual skin alex 

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:27.400
 it turns out just that one pixel is 

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:28.210
 one centimeter just like it was 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.950
 in style 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:32.400
 that is, it turns out that we have this 

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:35.800
 steve is already well crouched in dust 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:37.510
 stained with something and here we have this Alex 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:39.580
 but alexa is still a few 

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:41.910
 millimeters above the 6th I don't know what 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:43.900
 this is due but in general they 

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:45.820
 approximately equal 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:47.950
 and per month look very, very 

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:49.600
 nice bones telling me alex even 

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:49.840
 like something more because steve 

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:52.000
 going 

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:53.770
 all flat yes shine these here when 

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.460
 the rectangles are drawn on the roller 

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:56.740
 there is no such thing 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:59.530
 I would not think so too 

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:01.210
 beautiful, in principle, with the body there is nothing 

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:02.950
 the bulk she seems to me the season was 

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:06.340
 voluminous he too would be very very 

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:08.530
 beautiful photos like I'm step by step there 

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:10.450
 approximately a photo as an ideal alex well 

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:13.390
 More precisely fotkala as there I made 

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:15.280
 the torso of the head is still white so everything was 

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:17.080
 by the way, alex didn't like when 

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:19.090
 she was white shut up she was like 

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:21.550
 I like gypsum to where 

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:23.200
 great when she painted in contact and 

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:23.500
 we walked two photos will show you how i am 

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:25.870
 there 

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:27.910
 although you have already laid out step by step as 

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:29.920
 Number them that in whose there 

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:31.810
 slowly painted some fotkala 

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:33.880
 but not very much but if you will 

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:35.590
 interesting you can go see well 

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:37.690
 Well guys on this all here such from us 

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:40.060

 those items that are from to do well 

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:48.100
