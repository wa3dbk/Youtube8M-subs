00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
20 2015 18 motor and then you if you

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.850 
20 2015 18 motor and then you if you
look<00:00:47.309> right<00:00:47.910> into<00:00:48.180> this<00:00:48.480> area<00:00:48.860> this

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
look right into this area this

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.939 
look right into this area this
particular<00:00:50.250> EC<00:00:50.700> does<00:00:50.910> not<00:00:51.059> beep<00:00:51.360> audibly<00:00:51.949> it

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
particular EC does not beep audibly it

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.850 
particular EC does not beep audibly it
it<00:00:53.789> simply<00:00:54.270> flashes<00:00:54.960> the<00:00:55.140> number<00:00:55.440> of<00:00:55.559> cells

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
it simply flashes the number of cells

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.630 
it simply flashes the number of cells
that<00:00:56.039> it<00:00:56.760> picks<00:00:56.969> up<00:00:57.180> so<00:00:58.190> let's<00:00:59.190> see<00:00:59.399> if<00:00:59.489> it'll

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
that it picks up so let's see if it'll

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.790 
that it picks up so let's see if it'll
focus<00:01:00.329> there<00:01:00.660> so<00:01:01.260> I'm<00:01:01.320> gonna<00:01:01.440> turn<00:01:01.590> it<00:01:01.710> on

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
focus there so I'm gonna turn it on

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.860 
focus there so I'm gonna turn it on
right<00:01:01.980> now<00:01:02.129> and<00:01:02.370> then<00:01:02.520> you'll<00:01:02.670> see<00:01:03.090> a<00:01:03.120> blue

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
right now and then you'll see a blue

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.740 
right now and then you'll see a blue
light<00:01:04.110> flash<00:01:04.439> six<00:01:04.769> times<00:01:05.210> at<00:01:06.210> least<00:01:06.390> it<00:01:06.570> better

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
light flash six times at least it better

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:15.219 
light flash six times at least it better
put<00:01:06.930> flash<00:01:07.140> six<00:01:07.380> times<00:01:07.619> so<00:01:08.070> here<00:01:08.280> we<00:01:08.369> go
