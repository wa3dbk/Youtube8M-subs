a<00:01:56.170> stable<00:01:56.500> career<00:01:57.490> path<00:01:57.700> like<00:01:58.630> law<00:01:59.310> so<00:02:00.310> I<00:02:00.340> tend

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640 
a stable career path like law so I tend

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.350 
a stable career path like law so I tend
I<00:02:00.850> kind<00:02:01.360> of<00:02:01.450> geared<00:02:02.200> my<00:02:02.470> a-levels<00:02:03.430> towards<00:02:04.150> a

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 
I kind of geared my a-levels towards a

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.249 
I kind of geared my a-levels towards a
law<00:02:05.020> degree<00:02:05.440> and<00:02:05.680> just<00:02:06.640> before<00:02:07.390> the<00:02:07.900> degree

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:08.259 
law degree and just before the degree

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:10.889 
law degree and just before the degree
started<00:02:09.160> I<00:02:09.369> decided<00:02:09.759> that<00:02:09.910> I<00:02:10.270> really<00:02:10.600> should

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
started I decided that I really should

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:11.760 
started I decided that I really should
go<00:02:11.140> with<00:02:11.260> my<00:02:11.380> heart

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
go with my heart

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:15.600 
go with my heart
and<00:02:12.040> I<00:02:12.640> really<00:02:13.270> didn't<00:02:13.450> want<00:02:13.600> to<00:02:13.690> do<00:02:13.780> law<00:02:14.190> so<00:02:15.190> I

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
and I really didn't want to do law so I

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.000 
and I really didn't want to do law so I
decided<00:02:16.300> to<00:02:16.450> have<00:02:16.959> a<00:02:17.020> chat<00:02:17.230> with<00:02:17.260> my<00:02:17.470> parents

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
decided to have a chat with my parents

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:19.980 
decided to have a chat with my parents
and<00:02:18.220> explain<00:02:18.880> to<00:02:19.030> them<00:02:19.180> how<00:02:19.300> I<00:02:19.330> felt<00:02:19.660> and<00:02:19.900> I

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:19.990 
and explain to them how I felt and I

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:23.130 
and explain to them how I felt and I
would<00:02:20.260> be<00:02:20.380> unhappy<00:02:20.770> if<00:02:20.950> I<00:02:21.239> pursued<00:02:22.239> what<00:02:23.020> they

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
would be unhappy if I pursued what they

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.640 
would be unhappy if I pursued what they
wanted<00:02:23.760> and<00:02:24.760> so<00:02:25.570> we<00:02:25.690> compromised<00:02:26.200> on<00:02:26.440> the

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
wanted and so we compromised on the

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.470 
wanted and so we compromised on the
degree<00:02:26.920> in<00:02:27.010> business<00:02:27.250> computing<00:02:27.790> which

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
degree in business computing which

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.180 
degree in business computing which
actually<00:02:28.900> turned<00:02:29.110> out<00:02:29.200> to<00:02:29.290> be<00:02:29.380> so<00:02:29.530> vital<00:02:29.800> in<00:02:30.070> my

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
actually turned out to be so vital in my

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.699 
actually turned out to be so vital in my
career<00:02:30.459> because<00:02:30.910> so<00:02:31.540> much<00:02:31.750> of<00:02:31.810> my<00:02:32.050> job<00:02:32.320> is<00:02:32.560> in

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
career because so much of my job is in

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:35.670 
career because so much of my job is in
fact<00:02:33.150> about<00:02:34.150> the<00:02:34.780> business<00:02:35.200> and<00:02:35.440> commercial

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
fact about the business and commercial

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.590 
fact about the business and commercial
side<00:02:36.100> of<00:02:37.110> fashion<00:02:38.130> so<00:02:39.130> it<00:02:39.790> kind<00:02:40.120> of<00:02:40.209> grounded

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:40.600 
side of fashion so it kind of grounded

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.229 
side of fashion so it kind of grounded
me<00:02:40.720> and<00:02:40.750> given<00:02:41.050> me<00:02:41.140> quite<00:02:41.290> a<00:02:41.380> good<00:02:41.590> balance<00:02:42.239> but

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:43.239 
me and given me quite a good balance but

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:44.729 
me and given me quite a good balance but
it<00:02:43.330> did<00:02:43.480> worry<00:02:43.720> me<00:02:43.959> throughout<00:02:44.230> the<00:02:44.440> degree

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:44.739 
it did worry me throughout the degree

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:46.860 
it did worry me throughout the degree
whether<00:02:45.010> or<00:02:45.160> not<00:02:45.310> I<00:02:45.370> would<00:02:45.640> have<00:02:45.670> the<00:02:46.510> sort<00:02:46.780> of

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
whether or not I would have the sort of

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.650 
whether or not I would have the sort of
equal<00:02:47.590> opportunities<00:02:48.220> as<00:02:48.550> the<00:02:49.239> people<00:02:49.540> that

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
equal opportunities as the people that

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.720 
equal opportunities as the people that
would<00:02:49.780> graduate<00:02:50.170> from<00:02:50.260> a<00:02:50.440> fashion<00:02:50.620> school<00:02:51.040> so

would graduate from a fashion school so
