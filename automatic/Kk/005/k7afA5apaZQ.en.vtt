00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:05.280

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:11.360
 good solutions like this I am river 

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:13.549
 and well I'm in something that I know 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.439
 many of you are going to like it that way 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:17.600
 guys and well I do not know if they remember that 

00:00:15.439 --> 00:00:19.640
 long ago but a lot but a long time 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.320
 we had gotten a server from 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.900
 carmen land so is a server of 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.490
 kárbala that supposedly not 24/7 but 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.039
 when a lot of people started coming in 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:30.380
 it was but they could never open it 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:33.050
 they just stole the money for that 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:35.420
 they say no, I 'm never going to look for another 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.640
 server guys now they got a 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.829
 super super surprise this is how they are given 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:43.280
 account who left minecraft says 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:45.440
 that I have 65 mods activated 65 much more 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.539
 the fine loft like that because it's that 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.719
 well basically because we're 

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:53.690
 organizing a super server guys 

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:55.909
 karman land 2 so is the server 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:59.390
 karma the two in it that are 

00:00:55.909 --> 00:01:02.960
 playing venetian willy rex is like this 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:06.409
 and at xxvi and I think that use is like that 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:08.690
 same bar of mods will be open 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:10.670
 24/7 for everyone who can 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:13.580
 well at the moment it just has 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:16.280
 you extend lots but little by little with their 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:18.860
 donations and purchases for VIPS 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.180
 we can extend it logically if the 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.030
 server starts to grow because it's going to 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.950
