00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
Rollins or would it pretty much be a

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:07.920 
Rollins or would it pretty much be a
double-cross<00:03:06.849> on<00:03:07.060> John<00:03:07.299> Cena<00:03:07.510> and<00:03:07.629> I<00:03:07.690> don't

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
double-cross on John Cena and I don't

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:09.660 
double-cross on John Cena and I don't
really<00:03:08.079> want<00:03:08.410> Brock<00:03:08.980> Lesnar<00:03:09.160> to<00:03:09.489> be

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
really want Brock Lesnar to be

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.630 
really want Brock Lesnar to be
completely<00:03:10.540> destroyed<00:03:11.170> and<00:03:11.410> really<00:03:11.709> hurt<00:03:12.400> by

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
completely destroyed and really hurt by

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.910 
completely destroyed and really hurt by
this<00:03:12.700> I<00:03:13.030> think<00:03:13.299> that<00:03:13.530> what<00:03:14.530> what<00:03:14.769> they're

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
this I think that what what they're

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.289 
this I think that what what they're
trying<00:03:15.129> to<00:03:15.250> do<00:03:15.430> I<00:03:15.459> think<00:03:15.609> this<00:03:16.000> is<00:03:16.150> their

00:03:16.289 --> 00:03:16.299 
trying to do I think this is their

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:20.009 
trying to do I think this is their
intention<00:03:16.900> to<00:03:17.310> make<00:03:18.310> Lesnar<00:03:19.209> lose<00:03:19.569> the<00:03:19.810> match

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:20.019 
intention to make Lesnar lose the match

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:21.990 
intention to make Lesnar lose the match
and<00:03:20.319> then<00:03:20.590> he<00:03:20.829> would<00:03:20.950> be<00:03:21.160> back<00:03:21.489> and<00:03:21.760> then

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
and then he would be back and then

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.479 
and then he would be back and then
probably<00:03:22.299> win<00:03:22.660> it<00:03:22.810> again<00:03:22.989> at<00:03:23.560> Fastlane

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:24.489 
probably win it again at Fastlane

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:26.729 
probably win it again at Fastlane
against<00:03:25.000> Seth<00:03:25.299> Rollins<00:03:25.480> perhaps<00:03:25.959> this<00:03:26.590> would

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:26.739 
against Seth Rollins perhaps this would

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:30.120 
against Seth Rollins perhaps this would
lead<00:03:26.980> up<00:03:27.130> to<00:03:27.510> Brock<00:03:28.510> Lesnar<00:03:28.590> against<00:03:29.590> Roman

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.130 
lead up to Brock Lesnar against Roman

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:31.589 
lead up to Brock Lesnar against Roman
reigns<00:03:30.370> whoever<00:03:30.730> wins<00:03:31.000> damaged<00:03:31.359> it<00:03:31.569> will

00:03:31.589 --> 00:03:31.599 
reigns whoever wins damaged it will

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:33.330 
reigns whoever wins damaged it will
probably<00:03:31.870> be<00:03:31.989> Brock<00:03:32.530> Lesnar<00:03:32.919> to<00:03:33.069> win<00:03:33.099> the

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
probably be Brock Lesnar to win the

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:37.800 
probably be Brock Lesnar to win the
match<00:03:34.090> or<00:03:34.720> if<00:03:35.440> it<00:03:35.769> is<00:03:35.799> Brock<00:03:36.340> Lesnar<00:03:36.810> losing

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
and quitting the w/e Roman reigns would

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.379 
and quitting the w/e Roman reigns would
probably<00:03:41.560> win<00:03:41.739> the<00:03:41.919> match<00:03:42.130> that<00:03:42.970> would<00:03:43.150> be

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:43.389 
probably win the match that would be

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:46.830 
probably win the match that would be
when<00:03:43.780> the<00:03:43.989> future<00:03:44.410> of<00:03:44.650> the<00:03:44.799> WWE<00:03:44.970> arrives<00:03:45.970> it<00:03:46.299> is

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
when the future of the WWE arrives it is

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.020 
when the future of the WWE arrives it is
Seth<00:03:47.349> Rollins<00:03:47.470> cashing<00:03:48.040> in<00:03:48.310> his<00:03:48.370> contract

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
Seth Rollins cashing in his contract

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:51.839 
Seth Rollins cashing in his contract
along<00:03:49.870> with<00:03:50.019> Paul<00:03:50.200> Heyman<00:03:50.650> to<00:03:51.220> win<00:03:51.459> the

00:03:51.839 --> 00:03:51.849 
along with Paul Heyman to win the

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:54.180 
along with Paul Heyman to win the
championship<00:03:51.880> at<00:03:52.599> WrestleMania<00:03:53.470> now<00:03:53.620> what<00:03:53.950> a

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
championship at WrestleMania now what a

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:56.490 
championship at WrestleMania now what a
moment<00:03:55.180> that<00:03:55.299> would<00:03:55.329> be<00:03:55.599> but<00:03:56.139> it'll<00:03:56.260> be<00:03:56.319> really

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
moment that would be but it'll be really

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.190 
moment that would be but it'll be really
bad<00:03:56.889> reputation<00:03:57.849> for<00:03:58.269> Brock<00:03:58.510> Lesnar<00:03:58.540> because

00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.200 
bad reputation for Brock Lesnar because

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.009 
bad reputation for Brock Lesnar because
it<00:03:59.410> would<00:03:59.500> probably<00:03:59.709> be<00:03:59.950> when<00:04:00.430> he<00:04:00.669> quits<00:04:01.389> the<00:04:01.690> W

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:02.019 
it would probably be when he quits the W

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:03.750 
it would probably be when he quits the W
every<00:04:02.169> week<00:04:02.319> so<00:04:02.470> we<00:04:02.620> probably<00:04:03.099> get<00:04:03.370> a<00:04:03.400> hint<00:04:03.579> of

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760 
every week so we probably get a hint of

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:07.680 
every week so we probably get a hint of
