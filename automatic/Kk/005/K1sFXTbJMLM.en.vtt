00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:35.170 
many of them I still doing what is my

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:38.460 
many of them I still doing what is my
least<00:06:35.440> favorite<00:06:35.920> thing<00:06:35.950> about<00:06:36.160> spring<00:06:37.470> maybe

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:38.470 
least favorite thing about spring maybe

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:40.800 
least favorite thing about spring maybe
having<00:06:39.100> all<00:06:39.220> the<00:06:39.310> pollen<00:06:39.730> gang<00:06:40.000> stuffy<00:06:40.600> and

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:40.810 
having all the pollen gang stuffy and

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:42.090 
having all the pollen gang stuffy and
like<00:06:40.960> maybe<00:06:41.260> a<00:06:41.350> little<00:06:41.560> bit<00:06:41.740> I'll<00:06:41.920> have

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:42.100 
like maybe a little bit I'll have

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:44.580 
like maybe a little bit I'll have
allergies<00:06:42.790> I<00:06:43.030> wouldn't<00:06:43.360> say<00:06:43.570> but<00:06:43.630> I<00:06:44.050> do<00:06:44.350> get

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:44.590 
allergies I wouldn't say but I do get

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:46.800 
allergies I wouldn't say but I do get
stuffy<00:06:45.160> and<00:06:45.280> sneezy<00:06:45.520> more<00:06:46.090> often<00:06:46.360> in<00:06:46.480> spring

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:46.810 
stuffy and sneezy more often in spring

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:48.420 
stuffy and sneezy more often in spring
so<00:06:46.990> that's<00:06:47.110> definitely<00:06:47.350> one<00:06:47.800> thing<00:06:47.980> that<00:06:48.220> I

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:48.430 
so that's definitely one thing that I

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:50.790 
so that's definitely one thing that I
don't<00:06:48.940> like<00:06:49.090> so<00:06:49.390> much<00:06:49.540> felt<00:06:49.810> free<00:06:50.200> last<00:06:50.590> but

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:50.800 
don't like so much felt free last but

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:52.470 
don't like so much felt free last but
not<00:06:50.830> least<00:06:50.950> do<00:06:51.310> I<00:06:51.340> have<00:06:51.640> any<00:06:51.820> plans<00:06:52.090> for<00:06:52.210> spring

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:52.480

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:02.470 
just because I am putting all my time

00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:04.050 
just because I am putting all my time
and<00:07:02.500> energy<00:07:02.680> and<00:07:03.130> to<00:07:03.250> playing<00:07:03.490> in<00:07:03.610> the<00:07:03.730> sweat<00:07:04.030> a

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:04.060 
and energy and to playing in the sweat a

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:05.880 
and energy and to playing in the sweat a
lot<00:07:04.510> of<00:07:04.660> money<00:07:04.690> is<00:07:05.050> going<00:07:05.290> towards<00:07:05.770> this

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:05.890 
lot of money is going towards this
