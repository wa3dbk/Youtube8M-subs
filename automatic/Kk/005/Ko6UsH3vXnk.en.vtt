00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.410
 asked 

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:18.400
 wheel 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:28.820
 say you have no maries on 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:30.410
 the map right that's it 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.029
 bought the are bought how do we do 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.910
 then a fryer pure and then there 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:37.300
 he with mayonnaise and remoulade for 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:39.530
 I have an idea 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.540
 alternatively to his purchased calamari 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:45.020
 Let's make a fresh calamari one 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:52.309
 Japanese version with sushi bar and 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:54.290
 one thing we need fresh calamari 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:57.050
 we need more 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:58.370
 we need temperature that will become one 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.250
 Simply with cold water until you get to the 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:03.830
 has right consistency and what are they 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:06.560
 because the coconut flakes or may or 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:08.570
 a little bit of flake that's punk 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.070
 this is Japanese besides testing and that 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:15.799
 Makes the dough bring a lot more plus 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:16.630
 to say that is brightly baked bread 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:18.799
 out 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.750
 then we had to send was there 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:22.909
 We are also a bit of a position for 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:25.010
 the wasabi mayonnaise needs to be there 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:27.109
 we like mayonnaise and the water 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:30.820
 therapy sauce we admit a bit 

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:30.820
 marinating in the camera 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:36.530
 Ok, I'll give you the sauce 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.210
 the calamari is the one you will be the same 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.650
 earlier he orders over there 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:39.950
 we need at the moment we need 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:41.210
 Not 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.640
 May she be nice with yours 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.869
 Hands go in now then in 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:50.869
 in the meantime already in the 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:53.780
 Powder dough on that footballer's best 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:55.729
 always as a finger and if the 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.160
 finger slightly moistened is still with the 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:00.050
 dough then it is really great we 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.729
 now do the wasabi maronese yes you 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:03.259
 give me a bit of the time 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:05.090
 Send because the rhine is almost in 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:06.740
 vinegar already has some idea 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:10.429
 Give me a little bit something but 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:13.130
 so 23 spoons maybe so great and 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:20.580
 then even such a nice strip 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:22.920
 from the wasabi we're starting now 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.000
 folded at the back to media 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.650
 because of course we have one now 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.240
 little sauce and there would be us 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.040
 of course that I do not hold now 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:32.630
 That's why we just enter it 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.860
 a bit into the sea so to speak the 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:37.590
 Moisture is bound by the sauce 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.300
 and then we can do the nice in here 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.130
 give the tempo rateike bit 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:44.190
 take care that it kind of comes to me 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:45.660
 a bit tapped nerve I give you 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.440
 which ones and you just do it 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.820
 really only left and right one 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.110
 a little bit of rolling through 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:58.050
 and then they are actually already 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:03:03.470
 ready and can she help me with this 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:03.470
 sometimes already here in the hot fat 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:12.140
 okay the color is a little bit more brother 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.140
 are dripping off briefly 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.830
 and have already set perfect for 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.470
 do you think so i mean to 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:20.190
 all gone to the calamari and then 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.330
 we can actually already 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:24.030
 cause 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:27.700
 we make a bit of the bazaar 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:28.900
 Mio on the plate and turned that 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.370
 of course a bit more stylish 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.629
 attack 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:35.069
 can also do a bit of 

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:37.030
 make the teriyaki sauce 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:39.849
 we'll do a little bit more like this 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:43.060
 send that to me imagine that vista 

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:46.890

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:46.890
 nice the calamari 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:52.610

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:55.300
 i 'm not so thermic with it i am 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:59.900

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:04.160
