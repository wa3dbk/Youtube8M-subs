00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
week we did the AMD build and this week

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.169 
week we did the AMD build and this week
we<00:00:07.919> are<00:00:08.040> doing<00:00:08.160> the<00:00:08.309> Nvidia<00:00:08.670> one<00:00:08.880> for<00:00:09.090> all

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:11.810 
we are doing the Nvidia one for all
those<00:00:09.330> Nvidia<00:00:09.840> fans<00:00:10.139> out<00:00:10.380> there<00:00:10.490> because<00:00:11.490> I<00:00:11.670> am

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
those Nvidia fans out there because I am

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.789 
those Nvidia fans out there because I am
one<00:00:12.000> of<00:00:12.030> them<00:00:12.269> and<00:00:12.599> I<00:00:12.900> know<00:00:13.139> some<00:00:13.500> of<00:00:13.530> you<00:00:13.620> guys

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
one of them and I know some of you guys

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.640 
one of them and I know some of you guys
have<00:00:14.630> software<00:00:15.630> you<00:00:15.929> have<00:00:15.990> an<00:00:16.170> nvidia<00:00:16.440> shield

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
have software you have an nvidia shield

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.500 
have software you have an nvidia shield
you<00:00:17.250> need<00:00:17.400> something<00:00:17.640> that'll<00:00:17.880> work<00:00:17.970> with<00:00:18.300> all

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
you need something that'll work with all

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.349 
you need something that'll work with all
of<00:00:18.660> that<00:00:18.690> stuff<00:00:19.109> so<00:00:19.859> basically<00:00:20.730> this<00:00:20.939> build<00:00:21.210> is

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
of that stuff so basically this build is

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.240 
of that stuff so basically this build is
the<00:00:21.510> same<00:00:21.869> exact<00:00:22.260> build<00:00:22.529> except<00:00:22.980> with<00:00:23.100> an

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
the same exact build except with an

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.099 
the same exact build except with an
nvidia<00:00:23.789> setup<00:00:24.300> so<00:00:24.570> we're<00:00:24.689> going<00:00:24.779> to<00:00:24.869> go<00:00:24.900> ahead

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
nvidia setup so we're going to go ahead

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.099 
nvidia setup so we're going to go ahead
and<00:00:25.230> get<00:00:25.470> right<00:00:25.830> into<00:00:26.099> it<00:00:26.390> so<00:00:27.390> first<00:00:27.630> off<00:00:27.840> for

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
and get right into it so first off for

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:29.779 
and get right into it so first off for
the<00:00:28.230> cpu<00:00:28.710> of<00:00:28.830> course<00:00:29.130> we're<00:00:29.340> gonna<00:00:29.429> go<00:00:29.640> with

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
the cpu of course we're gonna go with

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.900 
the cpu of course we're gonna go with
the<00:00:29.910> AMD<00:00:30.449> FX<00:00:30.869> 6300<00:00:31.590> this<00:00:32.309> of<00:00:32.460> course<00:00:32.489> is<00:00:32.790> a

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
the AMD FX 6300 this of course is a

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.690 
the AMD FX 6300 this of course is a
well-rounded<00:00:33.360> 64<00:00:34.290> processor<00:00:35.280> that'll<00:00:35.550> pretty

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
well-rounded 64 processor that'll pretty

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.490 
well-rounded 64 processor that'll pretty
much<00:00:35.790> just<00:00:36.090> allow<00:00:36.390> you<00:00:36.450> to<00:00:36.660> do<00:00:36.750> any<00:00:36.930> gaming<00:00:37.170> in

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
much just allow you to do any gaming in

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.680 
much just allow you to do any gaming in
DDO<00:00:37.800> it's<00:00:38.160> not<00:00:38.579> perfect<00:00:39.090> for<00:00:39.239> doing<00:00:39.420> any<00:00:39.570> sort

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
DDO it's not perfect for doing any sort

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.060 
DDO it's not perfect for doing any sort
of<00:00:39.780> production<00:00:40.260> work<00:00:40.440> that's<00:00:40.710> good<00:00:40.890> enough

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
of production work that's good enough

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.490 
of production work that's good enough
for<00:00:41.129> gaming<00:00:41.840> for<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:42.930> motherboard<00:00:43.379> we're

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
for gaming for the motherboard we're

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.810 
for gaming for the motherboard we're
just<00:00:43.649> gonna<00:00:43.739> go<00:00:43.860> with<00:00:43.950> a<00:00:44.040> simple<00:00:44.370> motherboard

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
just gonna go with a simple motherboard

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.760 
just gonna go with a simple motherboard

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
that is the Affordable Nvidia build I

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.460 
that is the Affordable Nvidia build I
wanted<00:02:11.819> to<00:02:11.879> do<00:02:12.030> this<00:02:12.180> build<00:02:12.390> mainly<00:02:12.810> because<00:02:12.959> a

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
wanted to do this build mainly because a

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.680 
wanted to do this build mainly because a
lot<00:02:14.069> of<00:02:14.099> the<00:02:14.250> people<00:02:14.549> who<00:02:14.670> saw<00:02:14.880> the<00:02:14.940> AMD<00:02:15.420> build

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
lot of the people who saw the AMD build

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.809 
lot of the people who saw the AMD build
may<00:02:16.290> have<00:02:16.440> preferred<00:02:16.799> the<00:02:16.830> Nvidia<00:02:17.400> build<00:02:17.640> so

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
may have preferred the Nvidia build so

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:19.309 
may have preferred the Nvidia build so
basically<00:02:18.150> is<00:02:18.239> playing<00:02:18.480> off<00:02:18.599> the<00:02:18.660> same<00:02:18.989> idea

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
basically is playing off the same idea

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:21.080 
basically is playing off the same idea
for<00:02:19.860> those<00:02:19.980> who<00:02:20.160> are<00:02:20.220> wondering<00:02:20.579> about<00:02:20.670> any

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
really want an SI build or build that

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:30.740 
really want an SI build or build that
could<00:02:29.790> be<00:02:29.849> upgraded<00:02:30.209> down<00:02:30.329> the<00:02:30.450> road<00:02:30.599> you

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
could be upgraded down the road you

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.330 
could be upgraded down the road you
definitely<00:02:31.230> want<00:02:31.410> to<00:02:31.500> spend<00:02:31.739> a<00:02:31.799> bit<00:02:31.950> more<00:02:31.980> on<00:02:32.280> a

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
definitely want to spend a bit more on a

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.610 
definitely want to spend a bit more on a
760<00:02:33.060> and<00:02:33.269> a<00:02:33.569> bit<00:02:33.750> more<00:02:33.959> on<00:02:34.079> the<00:02:34.110> power<00:02:34.319> supply

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
760 and a bit more on the power supply

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.949 
760 and a bit more on the power supply
but<00:02:35.549> otherwise<00:02:35.760> this<00:02:36.120> build<00:02:36.360> is<00:02:36.569> pretty<00:02:36.810> much

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
but otherwise this build is pretty much

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:39.319 
but otherwise this build is pretty much
made<00:02:37.260> to<00:02:37.500> go<00:02:37.950> it's<00:02:38.220> just<00:02:38.459> a<00:02:38.579> great<00:02:38.790> bill<00:02:39.030> just

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:39.329 
made to go it's just a great bill just

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:42.140 
made to go it's just a great bill just
to<00:02:39.510> put<00:02:40.500> a<00:02:40.530> few<00:02:40.769> bucks<00:02:40.950> in<00:02:41.190> to<00:02:41.400> enjoy<00:02:41.880> it<00:02:42.030> while

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
to put a few bucks in to enjoy it while

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.240 
to put a few bucks in to enjoy it while
you<00:02:42.299> have<00:02:42.510> it<00:02:42.540> and<00:02:42.900> probably<00:02:43.530> you<00:02:43.920> will<00:02:44.069> have

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
you have it and probably you will have

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:45.979 
you have it and probably you will have
to<00:02:44.370> upgrade<00:02:44.519> two<00:02:44.940> years<00:02:45.299> down<00:02:45.480> the<00:02:45.660> road<00:02:45.690> even

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
to upgrade two years down the road even

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:48.080 
to upgrade two years down the road even
a<00:02:46.140> year<00:02:46.349> down<00:02:46.500> the<00:02:46.530> road<00:02:46.709> it's<00:02:47.370> not<00:02:47.549> exactly<00:02:48.000> a

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
a year down the road it's not exactly a

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.300 
a year down the road it's not exactly a
future-proof<00:02:48.600> system<00:02:49.319> by<00:02:49.470> any<00:02:49.650> means<00:02:49.829> but<00:02:50.190> of

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
future-proof system by any means but of

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.699 
future-proof system by any means but of
course<00:02:50.549> it's<00:02:50.730> only<00:02:51.090> 650<00:02:51.540> has<00:02:52.200> a<00:02:52.230> very<00:02:52.620> good

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
course it's only 650 has a very good

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:55.220 
course it's only 650 has a very good
price<00:02:53.069> for<00:02:53.400> a<00:02:53.880> gaming<00:02:54.480> computer<00:02:54.660> that<00:02:55.139> could
