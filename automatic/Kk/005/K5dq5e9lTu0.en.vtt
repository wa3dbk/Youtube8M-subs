going to be Musa Vasu cold hardy banana
we're<00:00:07.890> up<00:00:08.099> in<00:00:08.280> central<00:00:08.880> New<00:00:08.970> Jersey<00:00:09.059> so<00:00:10.050> in<00:00:10.170> 7a

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
all right so the first hole has been

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.450 
all right so the first hole has been
prepared<00:01:06.030> what<00:01:06.780> I've<00:01:06.899> done<00:01:07.080> is<00:01:07.380> dug<00:01:08.310> out<00:01:08.399> a

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
of mine root system looks really good

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.540 
of mine root system looks really good
tree<00:01:42.020> itself<00:01:42.440> is<00:01:42.740> a<00:01:42.770> little<00:01:43.010> bit<00:01:43.220> of<00:01:43.310> damage

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:43.550 
tree itself is a little bit of damage

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.640 
tree itself is a little bit of damage
from<00:01:43.940> shipping<00:01:44.330> it<00:01:44.420> in<00:01:44.570> it's<00:01:45.170> not<00:01:45.260> too<00:01:45.470> bad

all right now it's time to plant the
second<00:02:27.910> banana<00:02:28.470> this<00:02:29.470> one<00:02:29.710> suffered<00:02:30.250> a<00:02:30.340> little

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
second banana this one suffered a little

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.720 
second banana this one suffered a little
bit<00:02:30.850> more<00:02:31.030> damage<00:02:31.210> during<00:02:31.600> shipping

but

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.780 
but
the<00:02:35.390> root<00:02:35.600> system<00:02:36.050> on<00:02:36.170> this<00:02:36.410> also<00:02:36.890> looks<00:02:37.550> okay

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
the root system on this also looks okay

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.690 
the root system on this also looks okay
then<00:02:39.790> take<00:02:40.030> this

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
then take this

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:51.580 
then take this
Glantz<00:02:42.240> it<00:02:42.390> in<00:02:42.480> there

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.650

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
and now Hollis ought to do whose water

00:02:53.660 --> 00:03:01.510 
and now Hollis ought to do whose water
both<00:02:53.900> of<00:02:54.020> these<00:02:54.140> in<00:02:54.380> really<00:02:54.980> well

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:01.520 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:11.440 

you

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:14.930 

all<00:03:12.450> right<00:03:12.800> here's<00:03:13.800> the<00:03:13.890> finished<00:03:14.310> bananas<00:03:14.790> in

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
all right here's the finished bananas in

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:16.990 
all right here's the finished bananas in
the<00:03:15.030> ground

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
the ground

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.030 
the ground
and<00:03:17.090> these<00:03:18.020> will<00:03:18.230> just<00:03:18.410> have<00:03:18.500> to<00:03:18.560> be<00:03:18.680> watered

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
and these will just have to be watered

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.450 
and these will just have to be watered
every<00:03:19.190> day<00:03:19.730> and<00:03:20.170> hopefully<00:03:21.310> they<00:03:22.310> will

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:22.460 
every day and hopefully they will

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:33.900 
every day and hopefully they will
eventually<00:03:23.170> get<00:03:24.170> to<00:03:26.470> 4<00:03:27.470> 6<00:03:28.960> 12<00:03:30.820> 15<00:03:31.820> feet<00:03:32.120> tall

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:33.910 
eventually get to 4 6 12 15 feet tall

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.580 
eventually get to 4 6 12 15 feet tall
these<00:03:34.910> tend<00:03:35.330> to<00:03:35.390> top<00:03:35.600> out<00:03:35.840> right<00:03:35.870> around<00:03:36.080> 10<00:03:36.560> or

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
these tend to top out right around 10 or

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:40.080 
these tend to top out right around 10 or
15<00:03:36.980> feet<00:03:37.720> get<00:03:38.720> some<00:03:38.930> other<00:03:39.020> ones<00:03:39.230> in<00:03:39.500> pots

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
15 feet get some other ones in pots

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:43.390 
15 feet get some other ones in pots
right<00:03:41.090> now<00:03:41.300> that<00:03:41.780> should<00:03:42.200> maybe<00:03:42.530> even<00:03:42.860> hit<00:03:43.010> 20

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 
right now that should maybe even hit 20

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.430 
right now that should maybe even hit 20
this<00:03:44.300> will<00:03:44.450> give<00:03:44.540> a<00:03:44.600> really<00:03:44.690> nice<00:03:44.900> tropical

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440 
this will give a really nice tropical

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.060 
this will give a really nice tropical
