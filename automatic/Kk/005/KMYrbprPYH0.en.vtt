that<00:00:37.090> cycle<00:00:38.090> venture<00:00:38.390> one<00:00:39.350> was<00:00:39.710> worth<00:00:39.950> the

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:40.130 
that cycle venture one was worth the

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:41.740 
that cycle venture one was worth the
Sonic<00:00:40.489> series<00:00:40.520> started<00:00:41.120> to<00:00:41.180> go<00:00:41.239> downhill<00:00:41.420> but

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:41.750 
Sonic series started to go downhill but

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.369 
Sonic series started to go downhill but
honestly<00:00:42.050> I<00:00:42.230> liked<00:00:42.739> Sonic<00:00:43.640> Adventure<00:00:43.820> one

00:00:44.369 --> 00:00:44.379 
honestly I liked Sonic Adventure one

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:47.440 
honestly I liked Sonic Adventure one
back<00:00:45.379> in<00:00:45.530> the<00:00:45.559> day<00:00:45.800> I<00:00:46.220> will<00:00:46.580> say<00:00:46.910> that<00:00:46.940> the<00:00:47.270> game

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:47.450 
back in the day I will say that the game

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:49.570 
back in the day I will say that the game
has<00:00:47.629> not<00:00:47.660> aged<00:00:48.110> well<00:00:48.290> and<00:00:48.680> if<00:00:49.040> I<00:00:49.160> was<00:00:49.280> to<00:00:49.370> play

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:49.580 
has not aged well and if I was to play

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:52.030 
has not aged well and if I was to play
it<00:00:49.730> in<00:00:49.940> today's<00:00:50.780> world<00:00:51.080> I<00:00:51.440> would<00:00:51.920> probably

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:52.040 
it in today's world I would probably

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.640 
it in today's world I would probably
think<00:00:52.309> that<00:00:52.430> it<00:00:52.640> was<00:00:52.760> a<00:00:52.820> piece<00:00:53.059> of<00:00:53.090> garbage<00:00:53.650> but

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:54.650 
think that it was a piece of garbage but

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:57.310 
think that it was a piece of garbage but
back<00:00:55.309> in<00:00:55.340> the<00:00:55.610> back<00:00:56.180> in<00:00:56.210> the<00:00:56.360> Dreamcast<00:00:57.080> days

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:57.320 
back in the back in the Dreamcast days

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.180 
back in the back in the Dreamcast days

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:01.190 
oh it was excellent one of the things I

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:02.530 
oh it was excellent one of the things I
like<00:01:01.309> about<00:01:01.370> this<00:01:01.610> game<00:01:01.909> is<00:01:01.940> that's<00:01:02.269> kind<00:01:02.510> of
