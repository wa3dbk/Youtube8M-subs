today's downhill main event one of the
things<00:01:03.510> that<00:01:03.690> we<00:01:03.780> want<00:01:03.989> to<00:01:04.110> look<00:01:04.260> at<00:01:04.530> on<00:01:04.800> this

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:05.160 
things that we want to look at on this

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.250 
things that we want to look at on this
course<00:01:05.460> because<00:01:05.700> it<00:01:06.060> is<00:01:06.210> so<00:01:06.390> steep<00:01:06.750> and<00:01:07.020> it<00:01:07.110> is

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
course because it is so steep and it is

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.170 
course because it is so steep and it is
so<00:01:07.470> rough<00:01:07.770> we<00:01:07.950> want<00:01:08.160> to<00:01:08.280> keep<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.580> fork<00:01:08.880> and

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
so rough we want to keep the fork and

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.810 
so rough we want to keep the fork and
the<00:01:09.330> shock<00:01:09.690> from<00:01:10.650> packing<00:01:11.280> down<00:01:11.460> just<00:01:11.729> a

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
the shock from packing down just a

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.730 
the shock from packing down just a
little<00:01:11.850> bit<00:01:12.060> we<00:01:12.660> want<00:01:12.870> to<00:01:12.960> keep<00:01:13.110> that<00:01:13.320> fork

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
little bit we want to keep that fork

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.950 
little bit we want to keep that fork
fairly<00:01:14.400> well<00:01:14.580> extended<00:01:15.180> because<00:01:15.330> it<00:01:15.630> is<00:01:15.780> so

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
fairly well extended because it is so

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.170 
fairly well extended because it is so
steep<00:01:16.320> and<00:01:16.530> it<00:01:16.770> is<00:01:16.920> so<00:01:17.130> choppy<00:01:17.490> going<00:01:17.970> into

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
steep and it is so choppy going into

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.030 
steep and it is so choppy going into
some<00:01:18.390> of<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:18.600> corners<00:01:18.990> with<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.650> braking

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
some of the corners with the braking

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.280 
some of the corners with the braking
bumps<00:01:20.250> so<00:01:21.150> to<00:01:21.210> do<00:01:21.479> that<00:01:21.509> we're<00:01:21.900> going<00:01:22.020> to<00:01:22.080> do<00:01:22.259> a

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
bumps so to do that we're going to do a

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.840 
bumps so to do that we're going to do a
couple<00:01:22.740> of<00:01:22.800> things<00:01:23.009> one<00:01:23.280> of<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.490> things<00:01:23.729> we're

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
couple of things one of the things we're

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:24.980 
couple of things one of the things we're
going<00:01:23.940> to<00:01:24.030> do<00:01:24.210> is<00:01:24.390> make<00:01:24.570> sure<00:01:24.600> that<00:01:24.930> our

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
going to do is make sure that our

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.170 
going to do is make sure that our
rebound<00:01:25.470> is<00:01:25.619> plenty<00:01:26.040> quick<00:01:26.280> enough<00:01:26.580> to<00:01:26.759> get

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
rebound is plenty quick enough to get

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.760 
rebound is plenty quick enough to get
that<00:01:27.390> front<00:01:27.660> wheel<00:01:27.840> back<00:01:28.080> on<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.380> ground<00:01:28.619> as

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
that front wheel back on the ground as

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.040 
that front wheel back on the ground as
quickly<00:01:29.009> as<00:01:29.250> possible<00:01:29.600> the<00:01:30.600> other<00:01:30.750> thing<00:01:31.020> that

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:31.050 
quickly as possible the other thing that

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:32.810 
quickly as possible the other thing that
we<00:01:31.229> want<00:01:31.440> to<00:01:31.530> do<00:01:31.710> is<00:01:31.890> maybe<00:01:32.100> firm<00:01:32.490> up<00:01:32.670> the

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
we want to do is maybe firm up the

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.609 
we want to do is maybe firm up the
high-speed<00:01:33.060> compression<00:01:33.930> just<00:01:34.170> a<00:01:34.290> little<00:01:34.470> bit

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
high-speed compression just a little bit

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.749 
high-speed compression just a little bit
to<00:01:35.100> keep<00:01:35.310> that<00:01:35.460> fork<00:01:35.820> high<00:01:36.119> in<00:01:36.479> its<00:01:36.600> stroke

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:37.759 
to keep that fork high in its stroke

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:40.790 
to keep that fork high in its stroke
although<00:01:38.759> those<00:01:39.390> changes<00:01:40.140> that<00:01:40.170> we<00:01:40.470> would<00:01:40.650> do

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:40.800 
although those changes that we would do

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.249 
although those changes that we would do
from<00:01:41.130> a<00:01:41.190> normal<00:01:41.520> set<00:01:41.759> up<00:01:41.940> will<00:01:42.660> allow<00:01:42.810> us<00:01:43.229> to

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
from a normal set up will allow us to

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.020 
from a normal set up will allow us to
keep<00:01:43.530> that<00:01:43.710> front<00:01:43.979> end<00:01:44.160> high<00:01:44.490> to<00:01:44.550> keep<00:01:44.970> the

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
keep that front end high to keep the

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.880 
keep that front end high to keep the
rider<00:01:45.390> from<00:01:45.630> trying<00:01:45.930> to<00:01:46.020> pitch<00:01:46.200> himself<00:01:46.410> over

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
rider from trying to pitch himself over

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.040 
rider from trying to pitch himself over
the<00:01:46.920> handlebars<00:01:47.490> over<00:01:48.180> the<00:01:48.300> steep<00:01:48.540> drops<00:01:48.840> that

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:49.050 
the handlebars over the steep drops that

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:52.700 
the handlebars over the steep drops that
they<00:01:49.170> have<00:01:49.350> here<00:01:50.780> for<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:51.870> rear<00:01:52.050> shock<00:01:52.380> we

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
they have here for the rear shock we

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.410 
they have here for the rear shock we
want<00:01:52.890> to<00:01:52.950> do<00:01:53.040> something<00:01:53.490> similar<00:01:53.790> we<00:01:54.120> want<00:01:54.330> to

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
want to do something similar we want to

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.420 
want to do something similar we want to
keep<00:01:54.570> it<00:01:54.690> a<00:01:54.780> little<00:01:54.810> bit<00:01:55.260> firm<00:01:55.590> so<00:01:55.890> it'll<00:01:56.040> skip

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
keep it a little bit firm so it'll skip

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.790 
keep it a little bit firm so it'll skip
over<00:01:56.670> some<00:01:57.090> of<00:01:57.180> the<00:01:57.270> holes<00:01:57.510> rather<00:01:58.290> than<00:01:58.620> have

00:01:58.790 --> 00:01:58.800 
over some of the holes rather than have

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.950 
over some of the holes rather than have
the<00:01:58.979> wheel<00:01:59.190> suck<00:01:59.640> down<00:01:59.820> inside<00:02:00.299> the<00:02:00.510> hole<00:02:00.690> and

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
the wheel suck down inside the hole and

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.020 
the wheel suck down inside the hole and
slow<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:01.740> rider<00:02:01.950> down<00:02:02.250> and<00:02:02.580> you<00:02:02.640> can<00:02:02.820> tell

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
slow the rider down and you can tell

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.469 
slow the rider down and you can tell
when<00:02:03.210> that's<00:02:03.390> happening<00:02:03.900> on<00:02:04.049> your<00:02:04.890> bike<00:02:05.130> as

when that's happening on your bike as
the<00:02:06.479> rear<00:02:06.750> wheel<00:02:06.960> gets<00:02:07.229> into<00:02:07.770> one<00:02:07.979> of<00:02:08.100> those

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
the rear wheel gets into one of those

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.400 
the rear wheel gets into one of those
square-edged<00:02:08.760> potholes<00:02:09.720> you<00:02:09.959> can<00:02:10.110> kind<00:02:10.350> of

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
square-edged potholes you can kind of

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.440 
square-edged potholes you can kind of
feel<00:02:10.619> it<00:02:10.649> jerk<00:02:11.010> back<00:02:11.250> on<00:02:11.459> the<00:02:11.580> handlebars<00:02:12.060> just

a<00:02:12.570> little<00:02:12.870> bit<00:02:13.049> kind<00:02:13.650> of<00:02:13.709> like<00:02:13.890> a<00:02:13.920> fish<00:02:14.310> tugging

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
a little bit kind of like a fish tugging

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.250 
a little bit kind of like a fish tugging
on<00:02:14.820> a<00:02:14.850> line<00:02:15.150> when<00:02:15.390> you're<00:02:15.540> out<00:02:15.690> fishing<00:02:16.140> you

handlebars<00:02:20.370> and<00:02:20.549> that's<00:02:20.730> that<00:02:20.910> wheel

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
handlebars and that's that wheel

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.449 
handlebars and that's that wheel
following<00:02:21.900> though<00:02:22.080> the<00:02:22.530> ground<00:02:22.799> so<00:02:23.070> closely

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
following though the ground so closely

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:26.060 
following though the ground so closely
that<00:02:24.390> it<00:02:24.630> is<00:02:24.780> falling<00:02:25.019> into<00:02:25.350> that<00:02:25.530> hole<00:02:25.799> and

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
that it is falling into that hole and

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.340 
that it is falling into that hole and
sucking<00:02:26.430> some<00:02:26.640> of<00:02:26.760> your<00:02:26.910> speed<00:02:27.239> away<00:02:27.570> so<00:02:28.290> to

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
sucking some of your speed away so to

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.560 
sucking some of your speed away so to
help<00:02:28.560> fix<00:02:28.830> that<00:02:29.100> we're<00:02:29.400> gonna<00:02:29.519> firm<00:02:30.000> up<00:02:30.239> our

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
help fix that we're gonna firm up our

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:32.600 
help fix that we're gonna firm up our
low<00:02:31.019> in<00:02:31.140> high<00:02:31.320> speed<00:02:31.620> compression<00:02:32.220> just

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
low in high speed compression just

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.370 
low in high speed compression just
enough<00:02:32.880> to<00:02:33.120> get<00:02:33.239> that<00:02:33.480> wheel<00:02:33.660> to<00:02:33.840> kind<00:02:34.019> of<00:02:34.080> skip

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
enough to get that wheel to kind of skip

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.800 
enough to get that wheel to kind of skip
over<00:02:34.530> the<00:02:34.769> tops<00:02:35.040> of<00:02:35.310> those<00:02:35.430> holes<00:02:35.760> but<00:02:36.420> not<00:02:36.630> be

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
over the tops of those holes but not be

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.470 
over the tops of those holes but not be
so<00:02:37.080> firm<00:02:37.500> that<00:02:37.799> the<00:02:38.160> back<00:02:38.340> end<00:02:38.610> starts<00:02:39.030> dancing

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
so firm that the back end starts dancing

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:40.850 
so firm that the back end starts dancing
around<00:02:39.570> and<00:02:39.840> doing<00:02:39.989> what<00:02:40.140> I<00:02:40.170> call<00:02:40.380> the<00:02:40.560> devil

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
around and doing what I call the devil

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.880 
around and doing what I call the devil
dance<00:02:41.100> where<00:02:41.400> it<00:02:41.459> never<00:02:41.640> stays<00:02:42.209> in<00:02:43.140> line<00:02:43.590> it

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
dance where it never stays in line it

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.009 
dance where it never stays in line it
just<00:02:44.070> tends<00:02:44.280> to<00:02:44.370> move<00:02:44.580> from<00:02:44.760> side<00:02:44.940> to<00:02:45.000> side<00:02:45.180> so

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:46.019 
just tends to move from side to side so

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:47.390 
just tends to move from side to side so
we<00:02:46.110> want<00:02:46.290> it<00:02:46.380> soft<00:02:46.650> enough<00:02:46.950> where<00:02:47.160> it<00:02:47.250> won't

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
we want it soft enough where it won't

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.670 
we want it soft enough where it won't
move<00:02:47.580> around<00:02:47.970> but<00:02:48.600> not<00:02:48.780> so<00:02:49.049> soft<00:02:49.290> that<00:02:49.560> it

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
move around but not so soft that it

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.039 
move around but not so soft that it
sucks<00:02:49.980> into<00:02:50.220> each<00:02:50.340> of<00:02:50.519> those<00:02:50.640> holes<00:02:50.970> and<00:02:51.360> again

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.049 
sucks into each of those holes and again

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:53.479 
sucks into each of those holes and again
like<00:02:52.290> the<00:02:52.320> fork<00:02:52.769> we<00:02:52.950> want<00:02:53.130> to<00:02:53.190> keep<00:02:53.310> the

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
like the fork we want to keep the

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:56.120 
like the fork we want to keep the
rebound<00:02:53.880> a<00:02:54.060> little<00:02:54.090> bit<00:02:54.389> quick<00:02:54.750> to<00:02:55.470> allow<00:02:55.859> that

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
rebound a little bit quick to allow that

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:57.780 
rebound a little bit quick to allow that
shock<00:02:56.489> to<00:02:57.000> push

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
shock to push

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.220 
shock to push
we'll<00:02:58.090> back<00:02:58.299> down<00:02:58.510> on<00:02:58.659> the<00:02:58.750> ground<00:02:58.780> and

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
we'll back down on the ground and

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.380 
we'll back down on the ground and
recover<00:02:59.590> as<00:02:59.739> quickly<00:02:59.769> as<00:03:00.189> possible<00:03:00.219> but<00:03:01.209> not

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
recover as quickly as possible but not

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.149 
recover as quickly as possible but not
so<00:03:01.659> quick<00:03:01.930> that<00:03:02.140> you<00:03:02.170> start<00:03:02.530> getting<00:03:02.590> bucked

00:03:03.149 --> 00:03:03.159 
so quick that you start getting bucked

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:05.550 
so quick that you start getting bucked
just<00:03:03.939> like<00:03:04.180> riding<00:03:04.870> a<00:03:04.959> hobby<00:03:05.140> horse<00:03:05.379> and

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
just like riding a hobby horse and

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:06.839 
just like riding a hobby horse and
getting<00:03:05.739> thrown<00:03:05.950> over<00:03:06.159> the<00:03:06.250> handlebars<00:03:06.670> we

00:03:06.839 --> 00:03:06.849 
getting thrown over the handlebars we

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:08.550 
getting thrown over the handlebars we
just<00:03:07.090> don't<00:03:07.209> want<00:03:07.329> to<00:03:07.359> have<00:03:07.510> that<00:03:07.540> happen<00:03:07.900> so

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
just don't want to have that happen so

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.470 
just don't want to have that happen so
there's<00:03:08.739> a<00:03:08.829> happy<00:03:09.010> medium<00:03:09.189> between<00:03:09.790> being<00:03:10.299> too

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
there's a happy medium between being too

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.479 
there's a happy medium between being too
firm<00:03:10.780> and<00:03:11.019> too<00:03:11.140> soft<00:03:11.379> on<00:03:11.680> our<00:03:11.799> compression<00:03:12.189> and

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:12.489 
firm and too soft on our compression and

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:15.420 
firm and too soft on our compression and
too<00:03:12.969> fast<00:03:13.239> and<00:03:13.569> too<00:03:13.719> slow<00:03:13.930> on<00:03:14.079> our<00:03:14.349> rebound<00:03:14.769> for

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
too fast and too slow on our rebound for

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:17.009 
too fast and too slow on our rebound for
this<00:03:15.579> course<00:03:15.879> a<00:03:16.060> little<00:03:16.209> bit<00:03:16.359> quicker<00:03:16.689> on<00:03:16.930> the

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:17.019 
this course a little bit quicker on the

this course a little bit quicker on the
backend<00:03:17.200> and<00:03:18.090> as<00:03:19.090> far<00:03:19.269> as<00:03:19.329> rebound<00:03:19.840> is

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:20.019 
backend and as far as rebound is

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:21.539 
backend and as far as rebound is
concerned<00:03:20.379> and<00:03:20.650> a<00:03:20.709> little<00:03:20.920> bit<00:03:21.010> firmer<00:03:21.250> on<00:03:21.459> the
