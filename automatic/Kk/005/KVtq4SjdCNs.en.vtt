00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.530
 if it 's up here we give patch mods 

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:54.300

 doulat surely you also what 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:02.100
 they open and if not they look for it they open it in 

00:00:58.889 --> 00:01:05.670
 the folder they have and they leave it and they 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.770
 they are going to have it activated 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.030

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.390
 restore resources I will do it fast 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.119
 because my subscribers some already 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.220
 they know how to install it so 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.080
 for those who do not know I teach them we are going to 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.390
 use packages of textures pack of 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.289
 We give textures in doubling or where 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.570
 have saved 

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:27.900
 here is what we open 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:30.540
 is going to automatically leave you 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.800
 they have to leave they are going to be charged and 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.090

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.400

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.619

 the stone there is all there so that what 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.640

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:17.299
 are the reviews of the textures this if 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:21.199
 you do not activate the mod correctly 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:23.600
 in what is when they put a or when 

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:25.910
 find a redstone block that 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:27.560
 It would be this one that I will break when 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:30.470
 find this block is going to look like 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:32.419
 that water and fire in the and in the sand 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:34.760
 also that is going to bring a bug 

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:36.410
 but good is good mont activate them 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:39.949
 I'm going to remove the bug so check 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:42.410
