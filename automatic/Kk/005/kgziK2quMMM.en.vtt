00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:03.689
 we're going today tested for our channel was also sander a 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:05.360
 interval meters 

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:06.509
 the offending 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:09.509
 tr 90 these six 

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:15.709
 gold 

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:19.099
 because it delivered in its simplest device if I can say 

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:20.890
 a cardboard box in which we find 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:22.220
 our interval meters 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:26.330
 and two batteries once this one is tight interval hi meters 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:29.449
 automatically there is indeed no button we do not leave 

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:32.080
 we give them very simply 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:33.300
 by taking 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.160
 provided for this purpose on the left side of our reflex that we remember well 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.760
 sure the cache and we turn on in a photo mode the one of your choice 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.770
 positions on the tripod 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.010
 we prepare our framework 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.280
 and from that moment we do not touch anything 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.460
 so I obviously advise to remove the automatic mode of the bet 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.550
 in order to prevent the similarity from developing itself 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:55.729
 between each file 

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:59.330
 and so wrong the focus the camera is very simply 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:01.260
 a bar is in the center 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.260
 a button that allows the focus when you press 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.150
 and take a picture when almost totally like the trigger 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.800
 paris also has the ability to light up 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.870
 which can be quite useful when one turns indeed tailor or 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:19.680
 less what did outdoor photos especially for a sunset 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.820
 sun for example the most important console the center console 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.460
 consisting of four the purchase 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.140
 and the central button will allow us to program the remote is to 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.740
 program so our text then to start the year function 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:34.520
 completely left 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.240
 it allows to program the time that will elapse between the ignition of the 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.330
 remote control 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:41.560
 and the first shot 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.540
 so we can adjust for example on zero simply 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.540
 but to do this to the thigh once on the button 7 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:49.770
 we can navigate on 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.840
 the seconds digits of minutes or authors 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.590
 to program it 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.060
 with the buttons ouidah and press again on this to validate 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.990
 a beep informs us that fiction 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.560
 and well taken into account then there is the long function one franc on the right 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.459
 that allow us to choose the opening time 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:11.269
 our reflex 

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:14.919
 in other words, how long will the curator stay open to take the 

00:02:14.919 --> 00:02:16.509
 Photo 

00:02:16.509 --> 00:02:19.259
 as for the delay as for the interval 

00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:22.470
 this can vary from 2 0 to 99 eur 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.699
 so I advise to leave it on 0 

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:26.779
 and in this way a camera 

00:02:26.779 --> 00:02:30.079
 will take the automatic hand depending on the atmosphere finally to the 

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:33.100
 most interesting function the function interval meters 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:37.670
 so we press the button 7 and we can select the interval that will have 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.809
 among others each photo 

00:02:39.809 --> 00:02:43.039
 but can we for example a week 

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:46.299
 press the button 7 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:48.069
 and finally 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:50.519
 penultimate tie 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:53.079
 it's the number of photos to take 

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:55.579
 so two origins on bread 

00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:58.769
 we can change it from 399 

00:02:59.669 --> 00:03:03.089
 and it works more interesting than the one with two little dots 

00:03:03.089 --> 00:03:04.119
 this one 

00:03:04.119 --> 00:03:07.699
 allows you to take another unlimited of photos ie once the 

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:11.369
 program is launched it will have to be manually stopped at the end of the 

00:03:11.369 --> 00:03:12.289
 longed for 

00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:15.919
 if I summarize the delay before the programming is equal to zero 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.810
 the length that is to say the opening time being automatic 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:21.879
 interval and a second 

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:24.750
 and the unlimited number I can then on the button 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.040
 hookers start and stop and the camera started taking pictures 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.040
 of himself 

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:42.649
 and I support them to stop it 

00:03:42.649 --> 00:03:44.659
 my photos were taken 

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:48.010
 it will be enough then to repatriate them on the computer and to use software 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:49.209
 mounting 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:51.729
 to assemble them and barely make it 

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:55.119
 so this method is especially used in this video here 

00:03:55.839 --> 00:03:58.469
 so once you have finished using 

00:03:58.469 --> 00:04:01.779
 other interval meters it is very advisable 

00:04:01.779 --> 00:04:04.089
 to remove the wires that are there 

00:04:04.089 --> 00:04:07.399
 because there is no button for the state and so that could consume all 

00:04:07.399 --> 00:04:11.759
 the batteries and make the remote unusable when you need it 

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:14.969
 gives you an appointment very quickly for new tests been taken in hand 

00:04:14.969 --> 00:04:17.209
 in the meantime and by then do not forget 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:20.479
