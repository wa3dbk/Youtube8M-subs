 you know when we talk more and more 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.679
 medical tourism 

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:23.320
 for the hair cream 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.810
 there are four low cost destinations 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:28.460
 Tunisia 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:29.899
 Turkey 

00:00:29.899 --> 00:00:31.159
 the Morocco 

00:00:31.159 --> 00:00:33.330
 and the mauritian island 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:34.580
 the Morocco 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:36.250
 p mummies 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.680
 I live in a very good reputation 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.870
 so we know that we are selected for the quality of their services 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.490
 in Marrakech 

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:50.950
 it exists 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:52.350
 technical 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.120
 quite special 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.370
 original 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.980
 we met the medical manager in a whole new concept 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.200
 whose name is 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.489
 follicular 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:05.780
 assistant 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.220
 so what is it that this time since their assistance 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:10.840
 the mia 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:11.740
 but publish it 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.550
 you lead this structure 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:16.650
 can you explain to us 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.190
 what does this consist of 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:19.750
 assistance 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:21.050
 it's a concept 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:22.420
 original m 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:23.680
 and performant 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:28.409
 which allows practicing surgeons of Morocco benefits 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.630
 of the technique of there of bushel 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:33.770
 the cellar of geneva 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.899
 I think he's fed up 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:38.900
 debbie technician 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.900
 the specialized press in the letter sent to his account 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.560
 we are called a little back 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.570
 group activities 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:49.620
 that's enough to take place between little 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:51.190
 how are chosen 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:55.420
 the pitchers rejects because think of all this and much more is a lot of 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:56.620
 things 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:59.490
 which ccn to the strike 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.250
 annappes that are very powerful 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.600
 the excellent typhoon ph how would you choose 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.210
 we selected 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.299
 a really very very choice and a half the ministry 

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:11.880
 they were all trained 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.920
 end in european clinics in germany especially in spain 

00:02:18.829 --> 00:02:22.569
 so these are horses dogs cats or dogs or cats the visual artist 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.209
 these are things the place 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:29.569
 what beautifulval technique do you practice 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:31.650
 repeat it 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.930
 and peace no speech extraction degree of contentment it's their 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.899
 interest in losing patience away 

00:02:38.899 --> 00:02:41.390
 so if I understood correctly in summary 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.390
 you are a team of nurses and technicians 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:48.809
 so you are the research firm I imagine 

00:02:48.809 --> 00:02:54.129
 the director you have all your material while this topic at the level 

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:56.759
 material when we think 

00:02:56.759 --> 00:03:01.099
 in the country of the maghreb as soon as we say we will say exotic 

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:04.409
 for the tiny cream because it's warmer there 

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:05.939
 and there are no longer two 

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:09.039
 of two since standing 

00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:11.129
 we will say perfection 

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:13.019
 what equipment more 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:17.289
 why when we move birth to people transported of course 

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:19.959
 and then our instruments - 10 am 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:22.609
 it would be the same brutal way 

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:27.499
 who serve more than seven months and so long I do not know to avoid any 

00:03:27.499 --> 00:03:30.499
 as much as with the company sector 

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:35.519
 to listen thank you the biat remains to clarify that Morocco is a 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:37.359
 touristic destination 

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:42.430
 an amicable arrangement the spirit of rest and much more or less less 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:43.380
 expensive 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:48.100
 ccas that is to say less expensive is invited about 30 to 40% less 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:51.499
 expensive than 30 to 40% cheaper than in Iran 

00:03:51.499 --> 00:03:52.059
 thank you
