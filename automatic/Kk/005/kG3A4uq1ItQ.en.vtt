this ball mount so it it can rotate

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.060 
this ball mount so it it can rotate
quite<00:00:59.820> easily<00:01:00.000> or<00:01:00.410> horizontally<00:01:01.410> I'll<00:01:01.920> show

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
quite easily or horizontally I'll show

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.429 
quite easily or horizontally I'll show
you<00:01:02.129> more<00:01:02.340> of<00:01:02.399> that<00:01:02.789> in<00:01:02.940> a<00:01:03.000> second

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
you more of that in a second

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.640 
you more of that in a second
so<00:01:05.510> let's<00:01:06.510> get<00:01:06.630> right<00:01:06.750> into<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:07.049> usage<00:01:07.380> here

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
so let's get right into the usage here

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.980 
so let's get right into the usage here
and<00:01:08.180> so<00:01:09.710> put<00:01:10.710> it<00:01:10.799> in<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.159> CD<00:01:11.760> mount<00:01:12.060> here<00:01:12.510> the

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
and so put it in the CD mount here the

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.320 
and so put it in the CD mount here the
CD<00:01:13.200> slots<00:01:13.530> or<00:01:13.740> you<00:01:14.369> push<00:01:14.700> it<00:01:14.820> in<00:01:14.970> and<00:01:15.000> you

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
CD slots or you push it in and you

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.170 
CD slots or you push it in and you
rotate<00:01:15.810> it<00:01:15.960> about<00:01:16.280> you<00:01:17.280> know<00:01:17.310> five<00:01:17.759> six<00:01:18.030> times

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
rotate it about you know five six times

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.510 
rotate it about you know five six times
and<00:01:18.900> you<00:01:19.770> probably<00:01:19.920> don't<00:01:20.100> want<00:01:20.280> to<00:01:20.340> over

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
and you probably don't want to over

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:21.740 
and you probably don't want to over
tighten<00:01:20.549> it<00:01:20.880> but<00:01:21.090> that's<00:01:21.240> a<00:01:21.360> really<00:01:21.479> solid

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
tighten it but that's a really solid

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.910 
tighten it but that's a really solid
after<00:01:22.020> about<00:01:22.320> six<00:01:22.590> turns<00:01:22.830> so<00:01:23.759> you<00:01:24.360> can<00:01:24.920> just

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
after about six turns so you can just

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.219 
after about six turns so you can just
put<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.220> phone<00:01:26.430> in<00:01:26.610> here<00:01:26.850> and<00:01:27.090> I<00:01:27.630> I'm<00:01:27.930> using<00:01:28.080> a

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
put the phone in here and I I'm using a

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.870 
put the phone in here and I I'm using a
Nexus<00:01:28.560> S<00:01:28.740> with<00:01:30.170> incipio<00:01:31.170> case<00:01:31.590> it's<00:01:32.579> a<00:01:32.640> thin

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
Nexus S with incipio case it's a thin

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.060 
Nexus S with incipio case it's a thin
case<00:01:33.150> but<00:01:33.509> you<00:01:33.840> know<00:01:33.930> it<00:01:34.110> goes<00:01:34.259> that<00:01:34.500> wide<00:01:34.710> so

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
case but you know it goes that wide so

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.920 
case but you know it goes that wide so
you<00:01:35.130> can<00:01:35.430> able<00:01:35.520> to<00:01:35.640> use<00:01:35.700> any<00:01:35.909> case<00:01:36.150> with<00:01:36.299> it<00:01:36.420> you

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
you can able to use any case with it you

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.090 
you can able to use any case with it you

block the vent you know maybe it maybe a

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.359 
block the vent you know maybe it maybe a
tiny<00:01:51.630> bit<00:01:51.840> of<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.020> vent<00:01:52.200> but<00:01:52.380> barely<00:01:52.979> blocks

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
tiny bit of the vent but barely blocks

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.289 
tiny bit of the vent but barely blocks
it<00:01:53.610> and<00:01:55.340> you<00:01:56.340> know<00:01:56.430> you<00:01:56.490> can<00:01:56.700> have<00:01:56.909> horizontal

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
it and you know you can have horizontal

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.510 
it and you know you can have horizontal

and horizontal and vertical orientation

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.350 
and horizontal and vertical orientation
and<00:02:03.229> it's<00:02:04.229> really<00:02:04.380> quick<00:02:04.649> so<00:02:05.000> takes<00:02:06.000> about<00:02:06.119> two

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
and it's really quick so takes about two

might want to take off this plastic
piece<00:02:33.689> but<00:02:33.870> I<00:02:34.109> found<00:02:34.590> the<00:02:34.739> plastic<00:02:34.950> piece

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
piece but I found the plastic piece

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.520 
piece but I found the plastic piece
actually<00:02:35.760> helps<00:02:36.109> position<00:02:37.109> you<00:02:37.260> know<00:02:37.349> the

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
actually helps position you know the

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.580 
actually helps position you know the
volume<00:02:38.329> rocker<00:02:39.329> and<00:02:39.750> the<00:02:39.840> power<00:02:40.019> button<00:02:40.260> are

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
volume rocker and the power button are

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.860 
volume rocker and the power button are
all<00:02:41.010> it's<00:02:41.219> still<00:02:41.430> accessible<00:02:41.700> not<00:02:42.419> blocked<00:02:42.689> by

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
all it's still accessible not blocked by

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.619 
all it's still accessible not blocked by
the<00:02:42.930> side<00:02:43.260> clamps<00:02:43.650> here<00:02:43.799> so<00:02:44.040> you<00:02:45.030> know<00:02:45.150> if<00:02:45.510> you

00:02:45.619 --> 00:02:45.629 
the side clamps here so you know if you

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:47.449 
the side clamps here so you know if you
can't<00:02:45.870> leave<00:02:46.139> in<00:02:46.290> the<00:02:46.379> bottom<00:02:46.680> piece<00:02:46.889> out<00:02:47.159> I'd

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
can't leave in the bottom piece out I'd

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:50.990 
can't leave in the bottom piece out I'd
recommend<00:02:47.939> and<00:02:48.769> the<00:02:49.769> only<00:02:50.010> cons<00:02:50.310> I<00:02:50.549> found<00:02:50.819> with

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
recommend and the only cons I found with

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.009 
recommend and the only cons I found with
this<00:02:51.150> is<00:02:51.419> that<00:02:51.599> the<00:02:51.870> screw<00:02:52.790> position<00:02:54.019> it

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
this is that the screw position it

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:57.920 
this is that the screw position it
blocks<00:02:55.469> a<00:02:55.709> bit<00:02:55.859> of<00:02:55.949> the<00:02:56.040> display<00:02:56.430> now<00:02:57.239> in<00:02:57.659> some

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
blocks a bit of the display now in some

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.809 
blocks a bit of the display now in some
cars<00:02:58.230> the<00:02:58.500> CD<00:02:58.769> slot<00:02:58.980> is<00:02:59.099> actually<00:02:59.400> below<00:02:59.639> the

00:02:59.809 --> 00:02:59.819 
cars the CD slot is actually below the

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:02.390 
cars the CD slot is actually below the
display<00:03:00.030> in<00:03:00.780> which<00:03:00.989> case<00:03:01.230> it<00:03:01.859> would<00:03:02.159> block

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
display in which case it would block

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.000 
display in which case it would block
most<00:03:02.669> of<00:03:02.879> it<00:03:02.969> or<00:03:03.180> the<00:03:03.930> climate<00:03:04.199> controls<00:03:04.739> would

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
most of it or the climate controls would

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.770 
most of it or the climate controls would
be<00:03:05.159> above<00:03:05.549> I've<00:03:06.180> seen<00:03:06.480> that<00:03:06.599> before<00:03:06.719> above<00:03:07.290> the

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
be above I've seen that before above the

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.110 
be above I've seen that before above the
the<00:03:09.780> audio<00:03:10.109> deck<00:03:10.349> so<00:03:11.040> in<00:03:11.219> that<00:03:11.340> case<00:03:11.669> you<00:03:12.000> know

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
the audio deck so in that case you know

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.759 
the audio deck so in that case you know
it'll<00:03:12.329> be<00:03:12.480> really<00:03:12.659> low<00:03:12.930> and<00:03:13.290> it<00:03:13.560> will<00:03:13.650> be

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:13.769 
it'll be really low and it will be

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:15.140 
it'll be really low and it will be
blocking<00:03:14.010> way<00:03:14.280> more<00:03:14.459> on<00:03:14.549> the<00:03:14.639> screen<00:03:14.879> as<00:03:15.000> well

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
blocking way more on the screen as well

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.330 
blocking way more on the screen as well
so<00:03:15.419> I<00:03:15.989> recommend<00:03:16.469> it<00:03:16.560> for<00:03:16.709> this<00:03:16.799> kind<00:03:17.040> of<00:03:17.099> setup

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
so I recommend it for this kind of setup

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.679 
so I recommend it for this kind of setup
where<00:03:17.579> the<00:03:17.609> CD<00:03:18.000> slot<00:03:18.269> is<00:03:18.840> above<00:03:19.290> the<00:03:20.509> deck<00:03:21.509> and

00:03:21.679 --> 00:03:21.689 
where the CD slot is above the deck and

00:03:21.689 --> 00:03:25.039 
where the CD slot is above the deck and
it's<00:03:22.290> moving<00:03:22.500> on<00:03:22.970> now<00:03:23.970> you<00:03:24.030> you<00:03:24.810> know<00:03:24.900> the

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
it's moving on now you you know the

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:26.330 
it's moving on now you you know the
access<00:03:25.290> your<00:03:25.439> CDs<00:03:25.709> obviously<00:03:26.069> you<00:03:26.159> have<00:03:26.280> to

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
access your CDs obviously you have to

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:30.559 
access your CDs obviously you have to
take<00:03:26.579> out<00:03:26.699> the<00:03:26.819> mount<00:03:27.060> and<00:03:29.269> it'll<00:03:30.269> also<00:03:30.359> fit

00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:30.569
