00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.219
 some products that have worked in the 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.219
 my hair 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:27.079
 my hair I make progressive then 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:28.910
 hair that has chemistry in reais 

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:29.990
 completely different from most other 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:31.490
 cosmetics 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:34.070
 to why I did not indicate both 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:35.360
 because the product is great but 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:37.280
 it does not match the chemistry in my 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.949
 hair that is a specific technique 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:42.320
 so she just stayed is the wrong guess of the 

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:44.900
 ruins plastic knows that my 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:47.239
 hair is boring but sometimes it's lucky 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:48.920
 I think the right products and that's it. 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:51.140
 happened on the last trip, I 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.760
 I bought several products that he only 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.729
 realized that they are making my 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:58.479
 hair grow very fast these brands 

00:00:55.729 --> 00:01:00.830
 Come here only they are cheaper out there 

00:00:58.479 --> 00:01:04.840
 So it's worth talking to a friend. 

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:07.729
 soy touring so if you are planning 

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:09.920
 finally start showing it to you and it's going to 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:15.799
 start talking about the game this is 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:19.670
 The people I own are a shampoo and this is the 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:23.600
 shampoo one that is more basic type 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:27.590
 Their original was full of coconut and coconut 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:30.140
 even he is practical law is more neutral and 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:33.140
 half with it for the hair and as I already 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:35.750
 I use the consumer and mark very heavy 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.730
 I like shampoo that does not lose hair 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.530
 This one works really well, that's all. 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:41.690
 we do not let them be 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:44.650
 It has a coconut-based coconut aroma 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:47.900
 worked on the hair so there is a given 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:50.870
 here are the very good ones too 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:53.930
 and that 's what worked is the original 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:57.350
 He is a white man arrested for how she 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:59.390
 cost of people made dollars new york 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:02.120
 the one with 50 reais but still worth it 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:05.000
 the penalty for the continuation of the debt 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:05.990
 red line here is to restore the 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.869
 hair 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:10.869
 the inner vermilion 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.890
 I used conditioner and he has eyes 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.690
 so I step conditioner only in 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.720
 My hair tips my hair type 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.819
 now he has grown again so he is 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.230
 and no more so I had to me I 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:27.090
 did the line by line does not have a 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.950
 long story that I'm going to put here 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.530
 In this issue for you , stop cutting the 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.870
 hair on his shoulder because he reacted wrong 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.730
 the chemistry then here was not 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.010
 shared with the frills people 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.870
 cut your hair here at age three 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.569
 Only I said you do not know very fast 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.400
 Since then I've grown all that 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:46.440
 I'm using products that are more 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.530
 specifics for less in the case here for 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:56.640
 restore hair with a fifth as 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:58.590
 both in the case of the dye or in the 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.660
 the company's products are very 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.849
 and you'll be able to use a 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.950
 rock line that also worked 

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:08.400
 quite this game company sells at 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:11.970
 pharmacy here in são paulo and some 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:15.359
 markets, but it's harder for you to 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:17.280
 you can look at the lines of these brand 

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:20.870
 here and more authentic to do with you 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:24.030
 Access school curly hair is 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:26.370
 closed and very good brand and has a 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:28.859
 product here that I was very curious 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:31.260
 I showed you the video New York that 

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:33.390
 It's al if I think that's how you 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.190
 I'm not sure it's a brand mark 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:39.390
 Aussie even has a zinnia kangaroo 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:41.819
 here above to this product he is 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:43.769
 3 minute miracle type you pass on 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:45.750
 hair after the type conditioner 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:47.579
 leave a little bit and it's only three minutes 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:50.850
 because sometimes it gives you a lot of need 

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:52.739
 leave 15 minutes was in no hurry 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:54.660
 It can take so much of the bath and if here 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:56.400
 it's only 15 minutes and almost a little 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:58.859
 just in my hand and when I understand 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:01.440
 I was in the hand and passed the length 

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:04.079
 of the hair never in the root because otherwise 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.760
 Dandruff and spoke is very careful so 

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:08.880
 so always down here that is where the 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.290
 hair that has hair is that 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.970
 part was more dry because it is 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:14.069
 very far from the scalp so he 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:16.380
 receives the oiliness 

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:18.000
 then you have to pass the products to 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:20.010
 to treat but points out that's why my 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.900
 Hair I can make big hair 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:22.960
 a lot of people say I can not get the tip 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:25.060
 it's dry 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:27.340
 I do not have to handle the bill 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:29.830
 and this very functional product for me is 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:32.800
 a very tense hydration if you finish 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:35.349
 to pass and you already felt a lot more 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.419
 It's good, but it's going to be very good and I'll 

00:04:35.349 --> 00:04:39.400
 I'd rather comb my hair in the shower then 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:40.479
 I pass this product and the hairstyle with 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.849
 He in the hair 

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:45.160
 Finally, it is a new product but 

00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:47.650
 so I do not usually use products 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:49.509
 after which I wash my hair more sauce 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:51.370
 neighbor but I can not use a cream 

00:04:49.509 --> 00:04:54.430
 to comb then because they all 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:57.490
 speak very heavily gouged very heavy and 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:05:00.880
 here is the name is another launch 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:03.550

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:07.630
 speak in erechim 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:10.180

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:13.150
 pretty, all golden is in that line 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:15.250
 of them is very good and this product is 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:16.479
 to pass you after you've left 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:19.840
 with the hair with long hair and you 

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:22.509
 pass and dry the hair, not type with 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:24.340

00:05:22.509 --> 00:05:26.470
 central but it has the smell is a show 

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:29.710
 very very very very good not only 

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:32.110
 of calógero smell of producing the product 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:34.120
 because everyone smells but the smell of 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:37.750
 If you are very good, you want to create a 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:39.190
 perfume smell here and I thought 

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:41.620
 I then started to go and get 

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:43.960
 happened mania you have too 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:45.310
 of looking without some double edge 

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:47.080
 and she stared at if you have a 

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:48.909

 start dividing the tournament makes some 

00:05:55.630 --> 00:06:00.520
 three weeks or two weeks in three 

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:05.050
 weeks and it has helped me a lot 

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:07.210
 so it's a bit more expensive but it broke 

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:10.030
 my hair solve also indicated 

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:11.500
 enough and there is one more product today 

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:14.889
 product that I 'm going to show you 

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:17.050
 This is where the network can site where it is 

00:06:14.889 --> 00:06:19.630
 who uses the dryer a lot I do not usually 

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:22.780
 dry your hair or nothing because 

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:25.000
 I already do progressive so I avoid and only 

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:27.940
 of my avoided to the utmost using the dryer 

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.780

 late hair need to dry 

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:38.320
 I use this one is very important. 

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:40.060
 you use products that protect a wire 

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:42.010
 high temperatures because it does not help 

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:44.950
 you do an incredible hydration and 

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:47.169
 then type bt dryer you cable 

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:48.639
 to heat your hair so much because it stays 

00:06:47.169 --> 00:06:50.260
 dry then you have to use something 

00:06:48.639 --> 00:06:51.730
 to protect what you are 

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:53.740
 hitching your hair but all 

00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:56.080
 hydration ends when you put the 

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:58.600
 dryer a very high temperature then 

00:06:56.080 --> 00:07:00.760
 I'm so all cheaper lines of the 

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:03.190
 which is this but tries to use some producer 

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:05.980

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:09.370

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:19.150
 just a little bit just the hand and 

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:21.160
 it super surrenders a huge step 

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:23.740
 I do this bit here and I doing 

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:27.250

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:29.440

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:37.540
