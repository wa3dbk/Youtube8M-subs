so rodders take to verse 1 1 1 stalkers
let's<00:02:56.860> see<00:02:57.010> how<00:02:57.160> the<00:02:57.220> wraparound<00:02:57.700> line<00:02:58.030> goes

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 
let's see how the wraparound line goes

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:00.660 
let's see how the wraparound line goes
on<00:02:58.390> the<00:02:58.480> mini-map<00:02:58.720> so<00:02:59.470> watch<00:02:59.739> that<00:02:59.770> again<00:03:00.220> guys

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
on the mini-map so watch that again guys

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.930 
on the mini-map so watch that again guys
as<00:03:01.030> it<00:03:01.300> climbs<00:03:01.570> up<00:03:01.840> and<00:03:02.080> goes<00:03:02.200> south<00:03:02.530> and<00:03:02.940> again

as it climbs up and goes south and again

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.030 
as it climbs up and goes south and again
you're<00:03:04.090> seeing<00:03:04.360> that<00:03:04.540> tailing<00:03:04.840> action<00:03:05.470> from

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
you're seeing that tailing action from

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.330 
you're seeing that tailing action from
the<00:03:06.190> stalkers<00:03:06.760> so<00:03:07.000> the<00:03:07.090> stockings<00:03:07.600> over<00:03:07.870> here

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 
are bending the line at least a little

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:12.570 
are bending the line at least a little
bit<00:03:11.260> and<00:03:11.410> then<00:03:11.530> the<00:03:11.680> Marauders<00:03:12.130> are<00:03:12.310> winning

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:12.580

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:23.870 

see<00:03:19.740> the<00:03:19.890> wrapping<00:03:20.280> around<00:03:20.370> we<00:03:20.610> got<00:03:22.580> see<00:03:23.580> the

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
see the wrapping around we got see the

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.520 
see the wrapping around we got see the
martyrs<00:03:24.300> trying<00:03:24.660> to<00:03:24.750> wrap<00:03:24.930> around<00:03:24.959> on<00:03:25.380> both

changing<00:03:35.790> nothing<00:03:36.180> now<00:03:36.300> 30<00:03:36.600> Marauders<00:03:37.170> lived

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
changing nothing now 30 Marauders lived

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.980 
changing nothing now 30 Marauders lived
instead<00:03:37.740> of<00:03:37.950> 33<00:03:38.490> so<00:03:38.700> literally<00:03:39.209> one<00:03:39.480> upgrade

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.170 
stems going to be doing and then we're

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:52.130 
stems going to be doing and then we're
probably<00:03:49.290> gonna<00:03:49.530> go<00:03:49.680> back<00:03:49.830> to<00:03:49.980> no<00:03:50.100> stim<00:03:51.140> all

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 
probably gonna go back to no stim all

probably gonna go back to no stim all
right<00:03:52.260> let's<00:03:52.500> see<00:03:52.739> the<00:03:53.340> value<00:03:53.850> of<00:03:54.120> stim<00:03:54.420> pack

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
right let's see the value of stim pack

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
stim one time and let's see just how

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.000 
stim one time and let's see just how
many<00:04:03.180> extra<00:04:03.570> stalkers<00:04:04.110> that<00:04:04.290> kills<00:04:04.530> off<00:04:04.739> shall

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 
many extra stalkers that kills off shall

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:11.570 
many extra stalkers that kills off shall
we

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:11.580 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:14.030 

all<00:04:12.150> right<00:04:12.510> let's<00:04:12.750> see<00:04:12.930> if<00:04:13.050> those<00:04:13.230> tails<00:04:13.560> start

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
all right let's see if those tails start

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:17.300 
all right let's see if those tails start
wrapping<00:04:14.520> and<00:04:15.530> there's<00:04:16.530> a<00:04:16.620> bend<00:04:16.920> around<00:04:17.190> on

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
wrapping and there's a bend around on

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:22.100 
wrapping and there's a bend around on
the<00:04:17.430> bottom<00:04:20.299> marauders<00:04:21.299> on<00:04:21.600> their<00:04:21.780> way<00:04:21.930> around

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:22.110 
the bottom marauders on their way around

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:24.600 
now on the top I mean we can kind of

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.090 
now on the top I mean we can kind of
figure<00:04:24.780> them<00:04:24.990> or<00:04:25.140> others<00:04:25.410> are<00:04:25.530> gonna<00:04:25.650> win<00:04:25.920> this

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:26.100 
figure them or others are gonna win this

interesting

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:50.860 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:53.900 

is<00:04:51.310> it<00:04:51.550> just<00:04:51.790> me<00:04:52.060> or<00:04:52.120> did<00:04:52.330> more<00:04:52.690> Marauders<00:04:53.260> die

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:53.910 
is it just me or did more Marauders die

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:58.940 
is it just me or did more Marauders die
when<00:04:54.910> using<00:04:55.150> stimpacks<00:04:56.730> who<00:04:57.730> saw<00:04:57.970> that<00:04:58.180> coming

00:04:58.940 --> 00:04:58.950 
when using stimpacks who saw that coming

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:02.910 
when using stimpacks who saw that coming
holy<00:04:59.950> crap<00:05:00.430> okay<00:05:01.000> so<00:05:01.810> two<00:05:01.870> more<00:05:02.410> Marauders

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:02.920 
holy crap okay so two more Marauders

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:06.840 
holy crap okay so two more Marauders
died<00:05:03.250> by<00:05:03.610> losing<00:05:04.210> that<00:05:04.240> HP<00:05:05.050> and<00:05:05.860> the<00:05:06.490> thing<00:05:06.730> is

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:06.850 
died by losing that HP and the thing is

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:09.900 
died by losing that HP and the thing is
from<00:05:07.090> Marauders<00:05:07.390> they<00:05:07.660> lose<00:05:07.840> 120<00:05:08.470> HP<00:05:08.910> system

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:09.910 
from Marauders they lose 120 HP system

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:13.350 
from Marauders they lose 120 HP system
so<00:05:10.770> apparently<00:05:11.770> that's<00:05:11.920> a<00:05:12.100> huge<00:05:12.280> factor<00:05:12.520> stim

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:13.360 
so apparently that's a huge factor stim

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.320 
so apparently that's a huge factor stim
was<00:05:13.570> actually<00:05:14.140> a<00:05:14.170> negative<00:05:14.650> attribute<00:05:15.580> yeah

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:16.330 
was actually a negative attribute yeah

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:18.780 
was actually a negative attribute yeah
okay<00:05:16.990> so<00:05:17.350> let's<00:05:17.500> keep<00:05:17.620> that<00:05:17.770> in<00:05:17.830> mind<00:05:18.100> moving

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:18.790 
okay so let's keep that in mind moving

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:20.580 
okay so let's keep that in mind moving
forward<00:05:19.210> though<00:05:19.420> we're<00:05:19.750> gonna<00:05:19.870> go<00:05:20.050> back<00:05:20.260> to<00:05:20.290> no

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:20.590 
forward though we're gonna go back to no

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:23.580 
forward though we're gonna go back to no
stem<00:05:20.950> Marauders<00:05:21.640> have<00:05:22.330> the<00:05:22.480> advantage<00:05:23.020> by<00:05:23.230> 30

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:23.590 
stem Marauders have the advantage by 30

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:24.990 
stem Marauders have the advantage by 30
Marauders<00:05:24.130> at<00:05:24.280> this<00:05:24.430> point<00:05:24.700> so<00:05:24.820> we're<00:05:24.910> gonna

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:25.000 
Marauders at this point so we're gonna

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.020 
Marauders at this point so we're gonna
go<00:05:25.180> to<00:05:25.240> to<00:05:25.450> two<00:05:25.630> stalkers<00:05:26.580> two<00:05:27.580> to<00:05:27.790> two

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:28.030 
go to to two stalkers two to two

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:31.290 
go to to two stalkers two to two
stalkers<00:05:29.340> versus<00:05:30.340> I'm<00:05:30.820> not<00:05:30.970> going<00:05:31.120> to<00:05:31.180> use

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:31.300 
stalkers versus I'm not going to use

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:32.790 
stalkers versus I'm not going to use
Marauder<00:05:31.570> stemis<00:05:32.110> that<00:05:32.260> seemed<00:05:32.470> to<00:05:32.590> be<00:05:32.620> an

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:32.800 
Marauder stemis that seemed to be an

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:35.580 
Marauder stemis that seemed to be an
actual<00:05:33.160> drawback<00:05:33.700> in<00:05:33.940> that<00:05:34.090> situation<00:05:34.720> and<00:05:35.020> I

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:35.590 
actual drawback in that situation and I

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:36.780 
actual drawback in that situation and I
actually<00:05:35.770> did<00:05:36.040> just<00:05:36.070> go<00:05:36.340> ahead<00:05:36.490> and<00:05:36.580> spread

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:36.790 
actually did just go ahead and spread

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:39.270 
actually did just go ahead and spread
out<00:05:36.940> fan<00:05:37.330> out<00:05:37.510> both<00:05:37.720> teams<00:05:37.990> a<00:05:38.200> bitch<00:05:38.380> just<00:05:39.070> so

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:39.280 
out fan out both teams a bitch just so

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:40.590 
out fan out both teams a bitch just so
there<00:05:39.490> won't<00:05:39.520> be<00:05:39.730> as<00:05:39.910> much<00:05:40.090> of<00:05:40.240> a<00:05:40.300> wrap<00:05:40.570> around

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:40.600 
there won't be as much of a wrap around

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:43.920 
there won't be as much of a wrap around
will<00:05:41.080> be<00:05:41.230> more<00:05:41.500> instantaneous<00:05:42.540> so<00:05:43.540> here<00:05:43.750> we<00:05:43.840> go

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:43.930 
will be more instantaneous so here we go

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:53.310 
will be more instantaneous so here we go
let's<00:05:44.140> try<00:05:44.260> to<00:05:44.350> -<00:05:44.620> -<00:05:44.800> shall<00:05:45.100> we

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:53.320 

00:05:53.320 --> 00:06:01.920 

and<00:05:53.610> so<00:05:54.610> far<00:05:58.410> it<00:05:59.410> is<00:06:00.000> staying<00:06:01.000> pretty<00:06:01.360> straight

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:01.930 
and so far it is staying pretty straight

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:04.050 
and so far it is staying pretty straight
a<00:06:02.320> lot<00:06:02.770> of<00:06:02.920> bumps<00:06:03.160> up<00:06:03.280> on<00:06:03.430> the<00:06:03.550> bottom<00:06:03.820> again

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:04.060 
a lot of bumps up on the bottom again

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:05.760 
a lot of bumps up on the bottom again
the<00:06:04.270> stock<00:06:04.540> is<00:06:04.780> actually<00:06:04.960> bending<00:06:05.440> the<00:06:05.590> line

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:05.770 
the stock is actually bending the line

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:12.670 
the stock is actually bending the line
once<00:06:06.130> more

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:12.680 

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:15.640 

and<00:06:13.130> they<00:06:14.030> have<00:06:14.150> broken<00:06:14.360> the<00:06:14.570> top<00:06:14.780> line<00:06:15.050> again

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:15.650 
and they have broken the top line again

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:19.150 
and they have broken the top line again
but<00:06:16.720> the<00:06:17.720> stalker<00:06:17.990> is<00:06:18.199> doing<00:06:18.440> much<00:06:18.680> better<00:06:18.919> on

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:19.160 
but the stalker is doing much better on

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:23.390 
but the stalker is doing much better on
the<00:06:19.340> bottom<00:06:19.759> end
