00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:19.460 
science literacy series right integrates
science<00:00:17.580> with<00:00:17.940> reading<00:00:18.510> and<00:00:18.750> a<00:00:19.140> different

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
science with reading and a different

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:26.330 
science with reading and a different
topic<00:00:23.900> where<00:00:24.900> today<00:00:25.289> we<00:00:25.650> are<00:00:25.800> talking<00:00:26.039> about

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
topic where today we are talking about

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.759 
topic where today we are talking about
different<00:00:26.640> properties<00:00:27.269> of<00:00:27.420> water<00:00:27.599> Earth<00:00:28.380> Day

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
different properties of water Earth Day

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.009 
different properties of water Earth Day
is<00:00:29.400> coming<00:00:29.640> up<00:00:29.910> next<00:00:30.119> week<00:00:30.420> so<00:00:30.689> I<00:00:30.720> thought<00:00:30.779> it

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
is coming up next week so I thought it

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.420 
is coming up next week so I thought it
would<00:00:31.080> be<00:00:31.230> a<00:00:31.260> good<00:00:31.500> opportunity<00:00:31.740> to<00:00:32.219> talk<00:00:32.399> a

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
would be a good opportunity to talk a

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:33.319 
would be a good opportunity to talk a
little<00:00:32.550> bit<00:00:32.759> about<00:00:32.790> water<00:00:33.090> conservation

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
little bit about water conservation

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:46.660 
little bit about water conservation
water<00:00:34.260> like<00:00:34.559> in<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:34.890> Ganges<00:00:35.399> where<00:00:35.670> is<00:00:35.850> that

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:46.670 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.100 

well<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:47.730> first<00:00:47.940> of<00:00:48.120> all<00:00:48.270> we<00:00:48.570> did<00:00:48.719> we<00:00:48.840> were<00:00:48.989> not

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
well the first of all we did we were not

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.930 
well the first of all we did we were not
going<00:00:49.260> to<00:00:49.289> have<00:00:49.469> time<00:00:49.739> to<00:00:50.129> actually<00:00:50.309> show<00:00:50.730> how

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
going to have time to actually show how

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.150 
going to have time to actually show how
these<00:00:51.120> expand<00:00:51.660> but<00:00:51.899> these<00:00:52.020> are<00:00:52.199> called<00:00:52.440> jelly

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
these expand but these are called jelly

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.970 
these expand but these are called jelly
crystals<00:00:53.910> and<00:00:54.629> what<00:00:54.960> they<00:00:55.140> are<00:00:55.350> is<00:00:55.649> super

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
crystals and what they are is super

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.299 
crystals and what they are is super
absorbent<00:00:56.129> polymers<00:00:57.120> that<00:00:57.149> absorb<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:57.930> water

00:00:58.299 --> 00:00:58.309 
absorbent polymers that absorb the water

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:01.369 
absorbent polymers that absorb the water
150<00:00:59.309> to<00:00:59.430> 300<00:00:59.699> times<00:01:00.090> their<00:01:00.449> size<00:01:00.660> because<00:01:01.230> this

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
150 to 300 times their size because this

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.070 
150 to 300 times their size because this
is<00:01:01.500> their<00:01:01.710> original<00:01:02.160> size<00:01:02.399> okay<00:01:03.120> so<00:01:03.600> the

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
is their original size okay so the

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.260 
is their original size okay so the
implications<00:01:04.739> of<00:01:04.949> this<00:01:05.189> is<00:01:05.489> actually

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
implications of this is actually

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.980 
implications of this is actually
communities<00:01:06.960> and<00:01:07.790> plants<00:01:08.790> potted<00:01:09.330> plants<00:01:09.869> and

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
communities and plants potted plants and

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.020 
communities and plants potted plants and
that<00:01:10.619> you<00:01:10.770> can<00:01:10.950> actually<00:01:10.979> cut<00:01:11.670> down<00:01:11.700> your

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
that you can actually cut down your

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.380 
that you can actually cut down your
watering<00:01:12.420> 50<00:01:12.960> to<00:01:13.049> 80<00:01:13.260> C<00:01:14.100> better<00:01:14.400> so<00:01:14.640> everything

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
watering 50 to 80 C better so everything

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.359 
watering 50 to 80 C better so everything
you<00:01:15.450> can<00:01:15.659> find<00:01:15.930> these<00:01:16.229> not<00:01:16.500> only<00:01:16.830> at<00:01:16.950> Science

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
you can find these not only at Science

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.249 
you can find these not only at Science
stores<00:01:17.729> or<00:01:18.119> on<00:01:18.360> your<00:01:18.450> website<00:01:18.600> but<00:01:19.110> you<00:01:19.140> can

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
stores or on your website but you can

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:20.870 
stores or on your website but you can
find<00:01:19.560> them<00:01:19.710> at<00:01:19.830> nurseries<00:01:20.280> as<00:01:20.430> well<00:01:20.640> so<00:01:20.850> I

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
find them at nurseries as well so I

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.039 
find them at nurseries as well so I
wanted<00:01:21.180> to<00:01:21.240> be<00:01:21.330> sure<00:01:21.509> and<00:01:21.659> tell<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:21.960> audience

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
wanted to be sure and tell the audience

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.600 
wanted to be sure and tell the audience
that<00:01:22.320> today<00:01:22.680> because<00:01:22.860> probably<00:01:23.280> in<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.520> next

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
that today because probably in the next

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.990 
that today because probably in the next
rajole<00:01:23.970> machine<00:01:24.780> released<00:01:25.259> water<00:01:25.650> lily<00:01:26.640> and

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
rajole machine released water lily and

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.910 
rajole machine released water lily and
the<00:01:27.060> implications<00:01:27.689> it<00:01:27.810> has<00:01:27.900> for<00:01:28.080> science

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
the implications it has for science

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.789 
the implications it has for science
obviously<00:01:29.490> are<00:01:29.880> in<00:01:30.150> areas<00:01:30.509> with<00:01:30.689> drought<00:01:31.049> and

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
obviously are in areas with drought and

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.770 
obviously are in areas with drought and
it's<00:01:31.950> been<00:01:32.130> phenomenal<00:01:32.340> so<00:01:33.000> so<00:01:33.420> really<00:01:33.750> just

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
it's been phenomenal so so really just

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.270 
it's been phenomenal so so really just
in<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.110> last<00:01:34.290> few<00:01:34.470> years<00:01:34.740> this<00:01:34.920> has<00:01:35.100> come

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
in the last few years this has come

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.789 
in the last few years this has come
about<00:01:35.310> so<00:01:35.850> this<00:01:36.810> is<00:01:37.020> a<00:01:37.170> handy<00:01:37.439> for<00:01:37.619> all<00:01:37.710> the

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
about so this is a handy for all the

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.649 
about so this is a handy for all the
people<00:01:38.100> planting<00:01:38.579> things<00:01:38.850> as<00:01:39.030> we're<00:01:39.180> going<00:01:39.450> to

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
people planting things as we're going to

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.870 
people planting things as we're going to
spray<00:01:39.960> and<00:01:40.590> these<00:01:40.829> are<00:01:41.040> obviously<00:01:41.189> just<00:01:41.520> cars

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
spray and these are obviously just cars

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.039 
spray and these are obviously just cars
because<00:01:42.150> they're<00:01:42.299> just<00:01:42.450> fun<00:01:42.600> to<00:01:42.689> play<00:01:42.869> with

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
because they're just fun to play with

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.800 
because they're just fun to play with
feeling<00:01:43.500> they<00:01:43.619> feel<00:01:43.799> really<00:01:44.189> kind<00:01:44.399> of<00:01:44.810> it's

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
feeling they feel really kind of it's

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.219 
feeling they feel really kind of it's
like<00:01:46.049> a<00:01:46.079> jello<00:01:46.530> jelly<00:01:47.009> right<00:01:47.790> yet<00:01:48.600> to<00:01:48.899> get<00:01:49.049> in

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
like a jello jelly right yet to get in

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.170 
like a jello jelly right yet to get in
there<00:01:49.439> so<00:01:49.710> that<00:01:49.740> is<00:01:50.159> what<00:01:50.399> are<00:01:50.520> we<00:01:50.549> gonna<00:01:50.850> do

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
there so that is what are we gonna do

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.230 
there so that is what are we gonna do

you well we are going to do is I'm going
to<00:01:54.299> show<00:01:54.570> you<00:01:54.600> some<00:01:55.140> really<00:01:55.350> cool<00:01:55.560> sand<00:01:56.310> okay

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 
to show you some really cool sand okay

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.050 
to show you some really cool sand okay
hydrophobic<00:01:58.350> sand<00:01:58.740> and<00:01:59.040> hydrophilic<00:01:59.520> sand

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
hydrophobic sand and hydrophilic sand

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.469 
hydrophobic sand and hydrophilic sand
now<00:02:00.390> first<00:02:00.899> of<00:02:01.079> all<00:02:01.140> this<00:02:01.439> is<00:02:01.649> just<00:02:02.060> sand<00:02:03.060> that

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
now first of all this is just sand that

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.709 
now first of all this is just sand that
I<00:02:03.540> got<00:02:03.689> on<00:02:04.049> the<00:02:04.229> beach<00:02:04.439> right<00:02:04.920> in<00:02:05.579> Mexico<00:02:06.270> okay

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
I got on the beach right in Mexico okay

30 seconds your sand is it's dry dry
hydrophobic<00:03:51.350> hydrophobic<00:03:52.340> sand<00:03:52.940> what<00:03:53.269> it<00:03:53.450> is

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:53.630 
hydrophobic hydrophobic sand what it is

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:55.900 
hydrophobic hydrophobic sand what it is
is<00:03:53.840> it<00:03:53.959> actually<00:03:54.140> kind<00:03:54.590> of<00:03:54.680> has<00:03:54.890> an<00:03:55.100> oil<00:03:55.430> type

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:55.910 
is it actually kind of has an oil type

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:58.509 
is it actually kind of has an oil type
base<00:03:56.299> on<00:03:56.600> it<00:03:56.840> which<00:03:57.530> is<00:03:57.560> basically<00:03:58.160> a

00:03:58.509 --> 00:03:58.519 
base on it which is basically a

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:02.370 
base on it which is basically a
scotchguard<00:03:59.209> on<00:03:59.480> the<00:03:59.750> sand<00:04:00.019> oh<00:04:00.260> so<00:04:00.950> that's<00:04:01.370> it

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:02.380 
scotchguard on the sand oh so that's it

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:07.930 
scotchguard on the sand oh so that's it
you<00:04:03.380> need<00:04:03.590> Scotchgard<00:04:04.310> on<00:04:04.459> dirt<00:04:06.700> that's<00:04:07.700> what

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:07.940 
you need Scotchgard on dirt that's what

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:10.240 
you need Scotchgard on dirt that's what
it<00:04:08.060> is<00:04:08.209> one<00:04:08.780> of<00:04:08.810> the<00:04:09.079> experiments<00:04:09.530> people<00:04:09.950> can
