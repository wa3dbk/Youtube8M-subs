00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:05.879
 today it allows our creditors I would care to let the use of 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:07.859
 critical program 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.239
 first of all it is expected of him 

00:00:11.239 --> 00:00:15.739
 the tepic program what makes us rebuild our partition table 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.480
 which is the partition table 3 where it is specified 

00:00:20.749 --> 00:00:24.699
 how is this part given our hard drive let's put an example I've 

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:28.429
 seen in several cases that have already presented problems with anyone 

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:30.050
 the partition program 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.470
 Mary-Kate 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:38.700
 well some ppk deleted the plots observe that I have distribution 7 10 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:45.170
 now on the disk of I have a partition with a folder with marcano 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.170
 data recovery 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:50.870
 so also the commonly 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:52.430
 contains this data 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.430
 will do very well what happens if for some reason we 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.320
 we have manipulated years 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.770
 We did not back up our system and c 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.970
 we lost a part that we are going to align our particular to 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:08.950
 purpose 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:11.560
 I'm going to delete the entire extended partition 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.030
 notice that I have inside the extended 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:15.530
 the fearsome 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.530
 vueling weapons 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.100
 chrysler made 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.790
 binner participated 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.790
 very well so the changes 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.670
 the process with jubilation and I no longer have the fixed date 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:36.330
 now this is 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.940
 a serious problem 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:40.800
 as we can see 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.800
 in there is provision of epc and where the candidates 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:45.850
 the problem 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.130
 is that if I want to create the partition again 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.350
 I do not know exactly in the address 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.860
 from where this data was started 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.729
 if I had the addresses for example experience and this decade 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.790
 of the previous partitions because I could 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.760
 create them manually the ring 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.210
 but I do not have them 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.379
 so 

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:11.469
 if I believe in partitions 

00:02:11.469 --> 00:02:13.589
 the files that were 

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:15.649
 written here in this partition 

00:02:15.649 --> 00:02:18.379
 I'm not going to have to eliminate them anymore 

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:22.040
 or they will disappear because arnold will no longer locate us in total 

00:02:22.609 --> 00:02:25.609
 then we can not create participate 

00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:28.499
 how we recover the data 

00:02:28.499 --> 00:02:29.899
 we have to 

00:02:29.899 --> 00:02:32.149
 download the thesis program 

00:02:32.149 --> 00:02:35.149
 the page as you can see here 

00:02:36.839 --> 00:02:40.159
 I hope you can give them 

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:42.780
 efe the canine race of the program 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.229
 we believe the version 

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:48.099
 stopped I care 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:50.079
 now this program 

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:52.119
 strap in the same way 

00:02:52.119 --> 00:02:55.629
 since January is to say from a Syrian from a discrete 

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:58.629
 it is advisable to have anything like that from b os 

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:02.449
 just in case you can not boot your scotch in the world too 

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:04.139
 the partition c 

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:06.139
 I already downloaded it 

00:03:06.139 --> 00:03:09.139
 garmaz in 2010 

00:03:14.219 --> 00:03:17.239
 time and extract the files 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:20.239
 to my desk and I'm going to work from 

00:03:23.499 --> 00:03:24.350
 yes the project 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:27.159
 continuation to see very well 

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:29.189
 villalon I'm running from windows 

00:03:29.189 --> 00:03:32.109
 then I open what I did 

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:33.599
 and here the cis 

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:38.209
 the Mexicans and it seems to me this time in nine hours now a moment 

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:44.079
 buoy enlarge the image a little so that it occupies all the space 

00:03:45.029 --> 00:03:48.029
 and so we can continue with your project 

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:54.649
 nowadays we are within the program that life 

00:03:55.189 --> 00:03:57.409
 now everything works from 

00:03:57.409 --> 00:04:00.779
 of heroin as well as we can see is an environment 

00:04:00.779 --> 00:04:03.449
 now what are we going to do this 

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:05.709
 notice that there are people going to create a look 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:08.709
 a child file to be able to restore everything 

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:14.120
 very well shows us the discs I have hard disk has a civil merit 

00:04:14.119 --> 00:04:16.069
 hard diplomat 

00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:19.680
 is expected to detect them very well we will work on my hard drive 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.620
 do not have what Carlos Vizcarra says 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:27.229
 merchant 

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:31.750
 the name of the hard drive very well let's see the intersection amos people the kind of 

00:04:31.749 --> 00:04:34.110
 partitions that my computer had 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:37.550
 He explained that he tried a PC repartition 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:40.580
 If we had another type of practice we will have to select 

00:04:41.219 --> 00:04:44.159
 well then there are center 

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:45.830
 now he wants to demonstrate 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:47.689
 analysts 

00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:50.689
 will look for matches very well how can they see 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:53.080
 we have 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:57.270
 the first participation here is how our hard drive is now 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:59.249
 it only has one partition 

00:04:59.249 --> 00:05:01.009
 there is no more data protection 

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:05.229
 are deactivated that we are going to do we are going to make our 

00:05:06.249 --> 00:05:09.569
 program start looking for new strategies to keep quiet 

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:13.349
 of we have to see that marker that fall 

00:05:13.349 --> 00:05:16.520
 Kaka market we press in Peru 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:19.339
 very good questions and we want 

00:05:19.339 --> 00:05:23.769
 look for partitions that have not been done with a good doubles player, we'll say yes 

00:05:23.769 --> 00:05:25.180
 if anything 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:29.430
 As we can see, the green line we had before 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:33.710
 are virtually completely eliminated while we do not create partitions all 

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:35.189
 we can recover it 

00:05:35.189 --> 00:05:36.550
 is here 

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:40.029
 the partition of the country 

00:05:40.029 --> 00:05:43.409
 is writing the serve we want to do now 

00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:47.360
 what we are going to do is continue what matters 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:50.699
 and he has already created us the parts is how we can see 

00:05:50.699 --> 00:05:54.129
 1 the world in which the couple in primary then the extended that 

00:05:54.129 --> 00:05:57.080
 contains ana the palaces that we are going to make 

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:59.279
 let's go back hunting 

00:05:59.279 --> 00:06:02.279
 arrow that marks where it says bow and stern 

00:06:03.229 --> 00:06:05.720
 puts of catamarca we press it people 

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:07.369
 the feet confirm 

00:06:07.369 --> 00:06:09.360
 we assume that 10 

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:12.740
 because it tells us that we must restart the computer 

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:16.409
 so that the changes will have their effect let's say of the program 

00:06:18.129 --> 00:06:20.839
 very good caribe of the program 

00:06:20.839 --> 00:06:23.839
 let's not say with the arrows everything works with arrows 

00:06:24.999 --> 00:06:27.999
 nor are we going to restart the computer 

00:06:31.869 --> 00:06:36.849
 we are ready to restart the computer and it is going to pay restart 

00:06:36.849 --> 00:06:40.939
 notice before restarting that we are one we have our passions 

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:46.030
 but at the moment of restarting they will offer our parks them with all 

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:48.449
 the data that I had 

00:06:48.449 --> 00:06:51.449
 well then now we restart 

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:01.110
 well as we can see the computer is already turning on 

00:07:03.399 --> 00:07:06.289
 now let's review if these changes 

00:07:06.289 --> 00:07:09.289
 c are reluctant 

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:13.430
 in 2013 

00:07:19.349 --> 00:07:22.029
 good you have to wait until they charge prevents until 

00:07:22.029 --> 00:07:24.860
 we have our services again 

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:27.860
 with your folders and each of our more 

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:35.620
 have in mind what is the common program of zijin principle can run 

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:37.210
 from oesis to say 

00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:39.309
 take it according to sevilla 

00:07:39.309 --> 00:07:41.319
 and start them arrested is 

00:07:41.319 --> 00:07:45.270
 everything is at peace to those who told them they do not have any manual 

00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:49.230
 I think with this it is clear what to do if they have any questions very well 

00:07:49.229 --> 00:07:50.869
 leave us a comment 

00:07:50.869 --> 00:07:53.199
 on the blog 

00:07:53.199 --> 00:07:55.529
 and we are ready to enter 

00:07:55.529 --> 00:07:56.729
 have a good foot
