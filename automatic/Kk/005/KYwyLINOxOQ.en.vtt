that<00:00:32.820> I<00:00:32.850> just<00:00:33.090> spawned<00:00:33.450> and<00:00:33.690> died<00:00:33.899> what<00:00:34.200> you're

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
that I just spawned and died what you're

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.500 
that I just spawned and died what you're
going<00:00:34.440> to<00:00:34.500> need<00:00:34.590> to<00:00:34.680> do<00:00:34.739> is<00:00:34.860> spawn<00:00:35.190> in<00:00:35.460> rap<00:00:36.270> in

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
going to need to do is spawn in rap in

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:37.790 
going to need to do is spawn in rap in
the<00:00:36.570> model<00:00:37.140> and<00:00:37.260> you're<00:00:37.440> going<00:00:37.530> to<00:00:37.590> need<00:00:37.770> to

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
the model and you're going to need to

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.459 
the model and you're going to need to
spawn<00:00:38.219> with<00:00:38.550> it<00:00:38.730> invincible<00:00:39.090> on<00:00:39.629> the<00:00:40.200> vehicle

is<00:01:43.799> a<00:01:43.829> further<00:01:44.250> fix<00:01:44.700> for<00:01:44.939> this<00:01:45.119> you<00:01:45.810> can<00:01:45.960> only

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
is a further fix for this you can only

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.819 
is a further fix for this you can only
use<00:01:46.259> it<00:01:46.740> as<00:01:47.579> its<00:01:47.939> invincible<00:01:48.360> if<00:01:48.960> you<00:01:49.470> turn<00:01:49.619> off

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
use it as its invincible if you turn off

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.020 
use it as its invincible if you turn off
invincibility<00:01:50.399> will<00:01:50.850> explode<00:01:51.329> until<00:01:51.780> you<00:01:51.960> die

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
invincibility will explode until you die

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.810 
invincibility will explode until you die
