University of Zurich in Switzerland I

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.990 
University of Zurich in Switzerland I
think<00:00:45.210> if<00:00:46.049> I<00:00:46.229> look<00:00:46.440> at<00:00:46.619> the<00:00:46.739> response<00:00:47.220> and<00:00:47.699> the

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
think if I look at the response and the

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.789 
think if I look at the response and the
interest<00:00:48.360> of<00:00:48.449> people<00:00:48.869> and<00:00:49.080> the<00:00:49.229> discussions

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:49.799 
interest of people and the discussions

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:51.950 
interest of people and the discussions
that<00:00:50.100> I've<00:00:50.250> had<00:00:50.519> I<00:00:51.089> think<00:00:51.659> it's<00:00:51.780> been

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
that I've had I think it's been

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.229 
that I've had I think it's been
fantastic<00:00:52.739> so<00:00:52.979> we<00:00:53.129> have<00:00:53.280> people<00:00:53.519> from<00:00:53.850> many

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
fantastic so we have people from many

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.930 
fantastic so we have people from many
different<00:00:54.540> areas<00:00:54.960> we<00:00:55.920> have<00:00:56.100> like<00:00:56.339> we<00:00:56.909> have

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
different areas we have like we have

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.570 
different areas we have like we have
scientists<00:00:57.659> we<00:00:57.900> have<00:00:57.930> professionals<00:00:58.710> get

00:00:59.570 --> 00:00:59.580 
scientists we have professionals get

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:02.149 
scientists we have professionals get
them<00:00:59.790> interested<00:01:00.059> in<00:01:00.330> technology<00:01:00.809> and<00:01:01.710> so<00:01:02.040> if

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:02.159 
them interested in technology and so if

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:04.670 
them interested in technology and so if
communicate<00:01:02.970> about<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.600> work<00:01:03.869> that<00:01:03.900> we<00:01:04.320> do<00:01:04.470> in

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
communicate about the work that we do in

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.540 
communicate about the work that we do in
the<00:01:04.739> science<00:01:05.250> basically<00:01:06.090> in<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.720> ivory<00:01:07.140> tower

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:08.550 
the science basically in the ivory tower

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:11.240 
the science basically in the ivory tower
here<00:01:09.240> to<00:01:09.810> disseminate<00:01:10.440> our<00:01:10.680> knowledge<00:01:11.070> I

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
here to disseminate our knowledge I

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.340 
here to disseminate our knowledge I
think<00:01:11.280> and<00:01:11.730> discuss<00:01:12.510> with<00:01:12.900> people<00:01:13.260> I<00:01:13.290> think

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
think and discuss with people I think

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:23.720 
think and discuss with people I think
it's<00:01:13.620> restraint<00:01:14.070> and<00:01:14.880> fantastic<00:01:22.400> as<00:01:23.400> you<00:01:23.610> can

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:23.730 
it's restraint and fantastic as you can

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
it's restraint and fantastic as you can
see<00:01:23.970> robotic<00:01:24.600> is<00:01:24.810> all<00:01:25.470> about<00:01:25.890> adaptation<00:01:26.750> but

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
see robotic is all about adaptation but

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.980 
see robotic is all about adaptation but
learning<00:01:28.530> is<00:01:28.860> difficult<00:01:29.360> we<00:01:30.360> started<00:01:30.840> looking

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
learning is difficult we started looking

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.730 
learning is difficult we started looking
at<00:01:31.290> ways<00:01:31.560> in<00:01:31.590> which<00:01:31.860> robots<00:01:32.340> can<00:01:32.580> learn<00:01:33.470> not<00:01:34.470> by

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
at ways in which robots can learn not by

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.600 
at ways in which robots can learn not by
just<00:01:35.040> doing<00:01:35.670> random<00:01:36.150> trial<00:01:36.720> and<00:01:36.840> error<00:01:37.050> but

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610 
just doing random trial and error but

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.190 
just doing random trial and error but
extracting<00:01:38.610> every<00:01:39.570> piece<00:01:39.870> of<00:01:39.900> information

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
extracting every piece of information

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.560 
extracting every piece of information
from<00:01:40.770> every<00:01:41.160> experiment<00:01:41.670> they<00:01:41.760> do<00:01:41.820> and<00:01:42.240> they

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
from every experiment they do and they

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.140 
from every experiment they do and they
way<00:01:43.050> to<00:01:43.080> do<00:01:43.440> that<00:01:43.590> is<00:01:43.770> to<00:01:43.950> create<00:01:44.100> self<00:01:44.700> models

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:45.150 
way to do that is to create self models

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:47.450 
way to do that is to create self models
and<00:01:45.270> I<00:01:45.330> would<00:01:45.480> argue<00:01:45.530> that<00:01:46.530> that<00:01:46.770> is<00:01:47.130> the

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
and I would argue that that is the

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.890 
and I would argue that that is the
origin<00:01:47.970> of<00:01:48.090> consciousness<00:01:48.390> is

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:48.900 
origin of consciousness is

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.200 
origin of consciousness is
self-awareness<00:01:49.500> is<00:01:49.830> our<00:01:50.040> ability<00:01:50.520> to<00:01:50.730> create

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
self-awareness is our ability to create

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.600 
self-awareness is our ability to create
models<00:01:51.810> of<00:01:51.960> ourselves<00:01:52.590> so<00:01:52.740> that<00:01:52.770> we<00:01:52.920> can<00:01:53.310> learn

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
models of ourselves so that we can learn

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.030 
models of ourselves so that we can learn
from<00:01:53.970> every<00:01:54.690> experience<00:01:54.780> that<00:01:55.230> we<00:01:55.440> have<00:01:55.650> and

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
from every experience that we have and

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.520 
from every experience that we have and
not<00:01:56.730> repeat<00:01:57.200> mistakes<00:01:58.200> twice

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
not repeat mistakes twice

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.220 
not repeat mistakes twice
so<00:01:58.950> if<00:01:59.100> we<00:01:59.250> take<00:01:59.400> that<00:01:59.640> if<00:02:00.450> we<00:02:00.570> take<00:02:00.750> that<00:02:00.930> idea

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:01.230 
so if we take that if we take that idea

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:05.000 
so if we take that if we take that idea
and<00:02:01.790> we<00:02:02.790> apply<00:02:03.150> it<00:02:03.210> to<00:02:03.750> a<00:02:03.930> physical<00:02:04.590> machine<00:02:04.680> we

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:05.010 
and we apply it to a physical machine we

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:06.770 
and we apply it to a physical machine we
can<00:02:05.130> make<00:02:05.310> it<00:02:05.400> normal<00:02:05.700> and<00:02:06.030> we<00:02:06.480> can<00:02:06.630> make<00:02:06.750> it

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
can make it normal and we can make it

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.870 
can make it normal and we can make it
adapt<00:02:07.260> and<00:02:07.920> we<00:02:08.010> can<00:02:08.130> even<00:02:08.310> take<00:02:08.640> that

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 
adapt and we can even take that

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.300 
adapt and we can even take that
information<00:02:09.060> out<00:02:09.690> think<00:02:10.320> that<00:02:10.470> algorithm<00:02:10.830> and

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
information out think that algorithm and

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:22.210 
information out think that algorithm and
also<00:02:11.989> run<00:02:12.989> it<00:02:13.170> on<00:02:14.930> standard<00:02:15.930> systems

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:27.080 

as<00:02:23.220> always<00:02:23.670> I<00:02:24.049> really<00:02:25.049> like<00:02:25.459> Swiss<00:02:26.459> next<00:02:26.760> event

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
as always I really like Swiss next event

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.179 
as always I really like Swiss next event
and<00:02:27.299> this<00:02:27.480> is<00:02:27.629> another<00:02:27.870> great<00:02:28.079> one<00:02:28.290> thank<00:02:29.099> you

00:02:29.179 --> 00:02:29.189 
and this is another great one thank you

00:02:29.189 --> 00:02:31.519 
and this is another great one thank you
very<00:02:29.310> much
