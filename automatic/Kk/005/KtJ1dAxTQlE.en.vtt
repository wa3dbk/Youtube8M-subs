 pick up another tank capture went by 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.259
 time let's go on first there will be 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.329
 very interesting it is not detected capture 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:52.140
 but it's not so simple 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:54.180
 There is in the first about about for a bunch and also already 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.250
 weaving rides literally goes to the block 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.180
 Now in ksd and here to Mike can 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.759

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.920
 for he talked about ways 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.390
 through outfits in csd negative is understandable 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.720
 weaving more damage will do here already 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:23.340
 aventador which can help and negative 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:26.820
 little 4th did not leave the book to leave 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:30.180
 I’ll hide it back and I also took it 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:32.400
 aventador and also shaitan dies from st 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:36.000
 what well on experience on the shovel mayn 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:38.070
 here such micro moments wait for the negative 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.200
 one projectile at this time and in csd has 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:41.880
 as many as three but still vanshotny ta-ta-ta 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.810
 . the ride starts to force things off 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:47.190
 the first is upsetting to you where to 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.490
 this saying that. 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:52.830
 this is a very important character in each 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:56.310
 the team gave that full take 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:59.100
 virginity what chance did the course have such 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.840
 cool idea and just about to 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:02.670
 mind you guys believe in your success 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.980
 it was necessary after the first minus 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:07.410
 go off on task deftly breathe and 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:10.740
 kill team mayn't sure be rozman 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:14.160
 forces against toni are also two 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:16.800
 fraga in the piggy bank amga a lot of damage 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.810
 for this fight and I think the maximum 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:22.470
 performance must be 2 players well 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:25.260
 yes songs of god seizures of courses like 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:27.330
 always as always interesting and very 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.940
 interesting and very prepared guys 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:32.850
 but breaks on the experience of this fight 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:35.660
 score 10 here and you wanted first round 1 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:38.640
 mobile then expressed the beach zone battle 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:39.690
 ended up for someone good for 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:41.489
 someone bad 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:43.590
 Well, a very interesting confrontation 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:45.209
 you and I watched friends a little bit 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:49.230
 I think I sweat all the tankers 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:51.150
 involved in this fight but mayn't of course 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.660
 Well here you will not say the next card 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.580
 we have 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:56.269
 Enska not talk as soon as we see 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:58.950
 the statistics of the previous fight well, 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:04:00.510
 women that I would like to say that corsa 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:02.160
 from the upper base from the lower base will be 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:04.769
 work guys from might but 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:06.870
 waiting for the statistics of the previous round, we 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:09.090
 here is not burn consider we will 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:11.400
 finally good ensk maybe 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:13.440
 finally, the fun is still there 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.269
 an obvious favorite in this meeting after all 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:17.519
 might very strong maybe we 

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:21.180
 let's see the first match that will end 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:23.350
 you can play ahead of time 303 120 to 104 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:26.020
 fighting and in principle 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:29.890
 finish the match ahead of time but a few words about 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:31.750
 negative statistics 1900 almost 2000 plus 

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:34.630
 two frags are cool and low 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:36.580
 class and it works great 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:38.860
 and of course we do not forget about amga which 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:40.870
 2127 efficiency will be the best 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:43.180
 player of this round hire sleep 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:45.040
 look won by four tanks 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.900
 considering that zik is just a target 

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:50.860
 indicator of flooring throughout 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:54.190
 everywhere 0 and zik did not do anything 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:58.510
 actively played not four tanks again all 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:05:01.720

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:02.620
 he fought took them threw damage he 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:06.700
 also eighth 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:08.770
 the tank wonderfully wonderfully fine 

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:11.410
 though it was lost at the beginning of the battle 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:15.010
 but the team lost as it seemed in 

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:16.990
 peter small 31 became actually 8 ml 

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:18.850
