00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:03.620
[Music: There ain't no storm 

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:06.500
And there ain't no flood

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:09.110
There ain't no war 

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:11.970
Worth spilling blood. 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:17.660
Gonna hold me down, gonna break my
stride, 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:22.730
'Cause I got the love and light
inside. 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:25.940
'Cause there ain't no storm 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.790
And there ain't no flood

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.530
There ain't no war

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:34.320
Worth spillin' blood 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.170
Gonna hold me down

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:39.970
Gonna break my stride

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:45.550
'Cause I got the love and the light
inside. 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.380
Well, the winds may blow

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.260
In the thunder roll 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.860
But I got a fire

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.720
Lit in my soul. 

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:59.670
The roots run deep

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.540
So when the journey's long

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:04.970
Down in my heart

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:07.820
I sing this song. 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.740
'Cause there ain't no storm

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.410
And there ain't no flood 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.030
There ain't no war 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:18.950
Worth spillin' blood

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:21.730
Gonna hold me down 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.480
Gonna break my stride, oh 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.310
'Cause I got the love

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.030
And the light inside. 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:30.780
Play it for me one more time, now,
come on. 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:36.770
[Saxophone solo]

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:42.780

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:48.780

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.580

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.150
Well, the winds may blow, yeah

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.210
And that thunder roll

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:01.090
But we got a fire

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.710
Lit in our soul

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:06.550
Well, the roots run deep

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.410
So when the journey's long

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:12.390
Deep down in our hearts

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.630
We sing this song. 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.770
Oh, Lord, there ain't no storm

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.640
And there ain't no flood

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.250
There ain't no war

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:26.030
Worth spillin' blood

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.840
Gonna hold us down

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.740
Gonna break our stride

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.440
'Cause we got the love

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:36.830
And the light inside. 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:38.190
Now let the people sing it. 

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:40.080
There ain't no storm 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.050
And there ain't no flood, oh, Lord

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:48.310
There ain't no war worth spillin'
blood

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.130
Gonna hold us down

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.920
Gotta break our stride

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.680
'Cause we got the love

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.500
And light inside. 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:59.880
Come on, together, come on. 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.470
There ain't no storm

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:05.720
And there ain't no flood

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:10.810
There ain't no war worth spillin'
blood

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:13.490
They ain't gonna hold us down

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.490
Yes, they're not gonna break our
stride

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.130
Yes, 'cause we got the love

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:31.652
And light inside . . .]
