00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:04.400 

let's<00:00:01.979> now<00:00:02.280> look<00:00:02.520> once<00:00:03.210> the<00:00:03.419> facial<00:00:03.840> type<00:00:04.049> has

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:04.410 
let's now look once the facial type has

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:05.570 
let's now look once the facial type has
been<00:00:04.589> determined<00:00:04.859> and<00:00:05.190> the<00:00:05.279> reference

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.580 
been determined and the reference

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.990 
been determined and the reference
midline<00:00:06.060> has<00:00:06.270> been<00:00:07.069> calculated<00:00:08.069> let's<00:00:08.760> have<00:00:08.970> a

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
midline has been calculated let's have a

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.749 
midline has been calculated let's have a
look<00:00:09.179> at<00:00:09.300> facial<00:00:09.540> symmetry<00:00:10.110> as<00:00:10.469> you<00:00:11.429> can<00:00:11.550> see

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
look at facial symmetry as you can see

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.999 
look at facial symmetry as you can see
in<00:00:11.820> this<00:00:11.910> picture<00:00:12.210> a<00:00:12.660> face<00:00:13.440> severe

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
in this picture a face severe

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:15.860 
in this picture a face severe
symmetrical<00:00:14.730> racial<00:00:15.089> differences<00:00:15.660> between

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
symmetrical racial differences between

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.590 
symmetrical racial differences between
the<00:00:16.080> right<00:00:16.289> and<00:00:16.320> the<00:00:16.619> left<00:00:16.650> side<00:00:17.330> so<00:00:18.330> in<00:00:18.480> this

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
the right and the left side so in this

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.990 
the right and the left side so in this
example<00:00:18.949> if<00:00:19.949> you<00:00:20.130> only<00:00:20.279> look<00:00:20.369> at<00:00:20.609> two<00:00:20.820> right

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
example if you only look at two right

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.590 
example if you only look at two right
sides<00:00:21.330> or<00:00:22.260> you<00:00:22.560> get<00:00:22.800> to<00:00:22.830> left<00:00:23.189> side<00:00:23.480> you<00:00:24.480> will

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
sides or you get to left side you will

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.220 
sides or you get to left side you will
see<00:00:24.660> that<00:00:25.699> the<00:00:26.699> face<00:00:26.939> of<00:00:26.970> the<00:00:27.269> patient<00:00:27.689> does

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
see that the face of the patient does

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.060 
see that the face of the patient does
change<00:00:28.619> and<00:00:28.949> if<00:00:29.699> you<00:00:29.880> looked<00:00:30.150> at<00:00:30.300> this<00:00:31.070> real

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
change and if you looked at this real

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.639 
change and if you looked at this real
picture<00:00:32.730> of<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:33.300> patient<00:00:33.719> you<00:00:33.930> would<00:00:34.110> have<00:00:34.620> a

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
picture of the patient you would have a

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.220 
picture of the patient you would have a
hard<00:00:34.950> time<00:00:35.390> telling<00:00:36.390> us<00:00:36.690> there<00:00:36.899> isn't<00:00:37.170> a

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
hard time telling us there isn't a

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.430 
hard time telling us there isn't a
symmetry<00:00:37.680> but<00:00:38.250> if<00:00:38.399> you<00:00:38.550> do<00:00:38.700> to<00:00:38.940> rice<00:00:39.200> or<00:00:40.200> two

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
symmetry but if you do to rice or two

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.090 
symmetry but if you do to rice or two
legs<00:00:40.700> you<00:00:41.700> will<00:00:41.850> see<00:00:42.059> that<00:00:42.270> definitely<00:00:43.100> there

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
legs you will see that definitely there

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.910 
legs you will see that definitely there
are<00:00:44.190> some<00:00:44.399> differences<00:00:45.050> in<00:00:46.050> either<00:00:46.559> the

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
are some differences in either the

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.240 
are some differences in either the
height<00:00:47.610> of<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.969> eyes<00:00:48.469> the<00:00:49.469> width<00:00:49.739> of<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:49.980> face

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
height of the eyes the width of the face

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.060 
height of the eyes the width of the face
the<00:00:50.910> length<00:00:51.180> of<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:51.480> face<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:52.559> logo<00:00:52.739> job

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
the length of the face the logo job

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.470 
the length of the face the logo job
would<00:00:53.250> be<00:00:53.280> longer<00:00:53.579> on<00:00:53.850> one<00:00:54.030> side<00:00:54.239> and<00:00:54.390> the

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
would be longer on one side and the

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.529 
would be longer on one side and the
other<00:00:54.510> so<00:00:54.989> it's<00:00:55.110> very<00:00:55.829> important<00:00:56.730> and<00:00:56.940> the

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
other so it's very important and the

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.770 
other so it's very important and the
facial<00:00:57.750> symmetry<00:00:58.260> analysis<00:00:58.920> is<00:00:59.399> designed<00:01:00.000> to

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
facial symmetry analysis is designed to

facial symmetry analysis is designed to
record<00:01:01.050> anomalies<00:01:01.890> in<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.070> transverse

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
record anomalies in the transverse

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.770 
record anomalies in the transverse

dimension it has to be detected and

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.450 
dimension it has to be detected and
recorded<00:01:06.780> and<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.470> etiology<00:01:07.860> of<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.250> facial

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
recorded and the etiology of the facial

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.000 
recorded and the etiology of the facial
symmetry<00:01:08.970> must<00:01:09.330> be<00:01:09.510> known<00:01:09.750> between<00:01:10.409> before

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010

any orthodontic therapy started as an
example<00:01:15.060> let's<00:01:15.720> say<00:01:15.869> a<00:01:15.900> patient<00:01:16.290> had<00:01:16.439> a

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
example let's say a patient had a

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:22.570 
example let's say a patient had a
fountain<00:01:16.950> across<00:01:17.189> by<00:01:17.810> well<00:01:19.009> you<00:01:20.009> would<00:01:20.189> have<00:01:20.729> a

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:22.580 
fountain across by well you would have a

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:27.109 
fountain across by well you would have a
appearance<00:01:23.580> of<00:01:24.479> a<00:01:24.659> new<00:01:24.780> symmetry<00:01:25.880> but<00:01:26.880> it

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
appearance of a new symmetry but it

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.940 
appearance of a new symmetry but it
would<00:01:27.330> be<00:01:27.360> treated<00:01:27.869> differently<00:01:28.350> than<00:01:28.470> if<00:01:28.799> the

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
would be treated differently than if the

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.539 
would be treated differently than if the
patient<00:01:29.369> have<00:01:29.610> a<00:01:30.650> many<00:01:31.650> liberals<00:01:32.159> pattern

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
patient have a many liberals pattern

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.580 
patient have a many liberals pattern
anomaly<00:01:33.119> that<00:01:33.360> will<00:01:33.720> give<00:01:33.900> us<00:01:33.930> pretty<00:01:34.380> much

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
anomaly that will give us pretty much

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.340 
anomaly that will give us pretty much
the<00:01:34.770> same<00:01:34.950> look<00:01:35.310> so<00:01:36.180> it's<00:01:36.390> very<00:01:36.570> important<00:01:37.259> to

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
the same look so it's very important to

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.410 
the same look so it's very important to
determine<00:01:37.979> the<00:01:38.130> geology<00:01:38.670> of<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.210> facial

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
determine the geology of the facial

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:45.020 
determine the geology of the facial
symmetries<00:01:40.170> when<00:01:41.159> you<00:01:41.909> notice<00:01:42.270> one<00:01:43.880> so<00:01:44.880> the

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
symmetries when you notice one so the

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.350 
symmetries when you notice one so the
best<00:01:45.210> way<00:01:45.450> to<00:01:46.549> determine<00:01:47.549> the<00:01:48.000> facial

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
best way to determine the facial

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.630 
best way to determine the facial
symmetry<00:01:48.659> is<00:01:49.020> you<00:01:49.320> must<00:01:49.590> carefully<00:01:49.890> observe

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
symmetry is you must carefully observe

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.440 
symmetry is you must carefully observe
each<00:01:50.820> patient<00:01:51.509> face<00:01:51.990> from<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.530> front<00:01:53.450> looking

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
each patient face from the front looking

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.800 
each patient face from the front looking
in<00:01:54.990> their<00:01:55.530> eyes<00:01:55.710> and<00:01:56.130> note<00:01:56.640> any<00:01:56.850> disproportion

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
in their eyes and note any disproportion

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.790 
in their eyes and note any disproportion
to<00:01:58.439> the<00:01:58.590> right<00:01:58.799> or<00:01:59.070> left<00:01:59.130> side
