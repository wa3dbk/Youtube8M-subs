00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:26.259
 caraba will have to face the 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.330
 There's another video on the channel. 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:30.789
 this time we recorded a gameplay of the 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:33.130
 new batman arkham origins 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:35.079
 How can you be watching in the video? 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:38.260
 game is running super good that my 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:39.640
 notebook or it happens that it is of brakes 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.900
 during the game 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.820
 even using the recording program 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:45.400
 you can see there that performance 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.530
 was very good without using the program 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:50.650
 recording is not even spoken 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:52.600
 LEDs are minimal during this sun 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:55.660
 change scenarios even when you open a 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:57.580
 door to go to another prison scene 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:00.910
 and answer, see you 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:02.650
 even when it has many enemies it does not have 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:06.820
 performance drop I really liked it 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:10.270
 of that other logical playing in the details 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:11.859
 at least and with resolution 512 by 384 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.289
 which is to ensure that you will not have 

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:17.700
 problem even with the gameplay 

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:20.499
 I really liked it if you have a notebook. 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.999
 similar and have this video card worth 

00:01:20.499 --> 00:01:23.319
 It's worth giving the game a chance because 

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:25.299
 it's cool 

00:01:23.319 --> 00:01:28.299
 as well as the other two 

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:30.399

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:32.200
 he is promising people by complaining about 

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:33.569
 some bugs he has 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.740
 I did not get it repaired yet 

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:37.299
 during the time I played I did not 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.880
 see bugre enem 

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:43.810
 but if it has also must have correction 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:45.789
 go ahead do not be good kanun vai 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:48.850

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:49.959

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.929

00:01:56.439 --> 00:02:02.289

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.730
 performance on my machine 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.470
 It complicated and I liked it too much. 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.330
 I'll keep playing here because the game 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.850
 It's very good if you have not had it yet. 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:33.880
