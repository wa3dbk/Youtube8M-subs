00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
funny way still quite important because

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.720 
funny way still quite important because

above them I think it will be it won't

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.100 
above them I think it will be it won't
be<00:00:52.800> a<00:00:52.829> true<00:00:53.100> reflection<00:00:53.250> of<00:00:53.760> ability<00:00:54.300> if<00:00:54.629> men

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
be a true reflection of ability if men

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.689 
be a true reflection of ability if men
deny<00:00:55.289> finish<00:00:55.620> above<00:00:55.770> are<00:00:55.949> so<00:00:56.129> we<00:00:56.219> believe<00:00:56.460> this

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
deny finish above are so we believe this

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.700 
deny finish above are so we believe this
year<00:00:56.879> but<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.360> irony<00:00:57.480> table<00:00:57.989> will<00:00:58.140> lie<00:00:58.320> if

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
year but the irony table will lie if

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.819 
year but the irony table will lie if
that<00:00:58.920> yeah<00:00:59.640> once<00:01:00.030> it<00:01:00.239> would<00:01:00.420> well<00:01:01.350> I'm<00:01:01.530> I'm

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
that yeah once it would well I'm I'm

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.880 
that yeah once it would well I'm I'm
looking<00:01:02.190> forward<00:01:02.370> to<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:02.640> game<00:01:02.670> today<00:01:03.030> I
