00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:14.659 
was from my froggy stuff but i actually

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:17.390 
was from my froggy stuff but i actually
made<00:01:15.659> it<00:01:15.840> and<00:01:16.020> thought<00:01:16.290> off<00:01:16.530> of<00:01:16.770> it<00:01:16.979> before<00:01:17.369> she

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
made it and thought off of it before she

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.330 
made it and thought off of it before she
even<00:01:17.759> thought<00:01:18.060> of<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:18.299> idea<00:01:18.830> except<00:01:19.830> i<00:01:20.009> used<00:01:20.220> a

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
even thought of the idea except i used a

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.880 
even thought of the idea except i used a
toothpick<00:01:20.880> for<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.240> back<00:01:21.450> and<00:01:22.020> some<00:01:22.350> tape<00:01:22.590> and

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
toothpick for the back and some tape and

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.820 
toothpick for the back and some tape and
used<00:01:23.369> a<00:01:23.460> thicker<00:01:23.700> cardboard<00:01:24.479> and<00:01:25.350> then<00:01:25.530> aim<00:01:25.710> is

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
used a thicker cardboard and then aim is

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.440 
used a thicker cardboard and then aim is
some<00:01:26.040> cardboard<00:01:26.400> for<00:01:26.820> the<00:01:26.880> bottom<00:01:27.240> but<00:01:27.420> i

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
some cardboard for the bottom but i

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.920 
some cardboard for the bottom but i
think<00:01:27.750> hers<00:01:27.960> is<00:01:28.380> a<00:01:28.409> little<00:01:28.979> bit<00:01:29.130> better<00:01:29.720> but<00:01:30.720> i

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
think hers is a little bit better but i

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.440 
think hers is a little bit better but i
actually<00:01:31.439> what<00:01:32.040> i<00:01:32.070> do<00:01:32.250> for<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.759> screens<00:01:33.150> I
