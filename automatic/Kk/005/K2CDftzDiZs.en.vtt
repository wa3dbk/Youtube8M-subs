00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:07.750
 hello how about this good night 

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:11.750
 here I wanted to show you 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:14.980
 I wanted to show you this is a crossover 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:17.340
 it is a crossover of a 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:22.470
 a speaker 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:24.510
 to a double 15 horn and his twitter and 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:29.510
 what this crossover does is for 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:33.079
 protect as it has a magnifying glasses has a 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:37.520
 coil for lopez 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:40.040
 means is called 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:43.790
 and then have for the treble for 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:45.100
 protect them and this part of here 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:46.550
 If you can not 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:52.129
 observe 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:55.560
 is this for a lamp of that the for 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:58.920
 what it does is a fuse 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:02.219
 when too much arrives 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:05.400
 too much signal too much 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:09.380
 voltage towards twitter 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:12.180
 this faith melts and no longer lets the 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:14.040
 it no longer lets excess voltage pass 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.740
 towards twitter so that the 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:20.970
 twitter because it is very very expensive 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:23.340
 replace them then as you already have your 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.700
 years this horn has been used by 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.700
 many 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.680
 many touched then what are we going to 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.880
 to do is place here you have to 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.600
 to be 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.580
 of a coil for the tummy so many that 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:43.800
 is 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:47.900
 2.2 thousand and homs then we already ordered it 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:49.750
 gmail.com and here we have 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:53.580
 the routine 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:53.580
 if you can observe it is this 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.770
 both 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:04.820
 2.2 million is what we are going to put 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.820
 here 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:11.260
 we remove are a little different 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:14.430
 because these are 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:16.530
 that are hollow if you are alone 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:19.069
 these are the ones I had originally from 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.069
 factory 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:27.510
 can give us is already burned 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.510
 and is the one that went in this part of here 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:33.660
 then we are going to do is replace 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:41.110
 the coil for a new one are different 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:44.710
 but you are in the same function 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:49.440
 then what are we going to put in place 

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:49.440
 here and then to protect the twitters 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.400
 we have 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:58.800
 by a few switches poly switches like 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:04.800
 that's what they do that work 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:08.380
 also with heat are like a kind 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:10.990
 of heat switches 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:13.480
 when too much enters 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:19.680
 too much voltage 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:19.680
 too much happiness what they do is this 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:27.640
 they cut that is the flow of electricity and 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:30.700
 already after I'm with him since he 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:32.950
 cool and about five seconds return to 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:35.290
 drive from him 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:37.480
 the coconut electricity as it was 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:39.879
 previously then the reason that 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:43.239
 let's replace this place it to 

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:45.489
 who in the place of the wire is a 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:48.610
 advantage is that the lamps melt and 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:51.099
 you have to weld and replace them in the 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:55.420
 case of these parts of these switches 

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:57.220
 little ones not because they go out and 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:00.970
 they turn on again in five seconds 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:02.739
 several is not not exactly and in what 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:06.120
 let's try to do to fix 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:06.120
 these speakers now 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:11.800
 this also goes for all friends 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:14.890
 from the youtube channel 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:18.670
 they have followed us good always ask 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:22.360
 for me for a box of cervera that had 

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:24.170
 you behave then all of me 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:26.480
 they claim that 

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:28.490
 I know that being a good vegan brings us to that 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:30.980
 kind of sports 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:33.230
 and also many ask me for the most 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:36.140
 I wanted to tell you briefly that those 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:39.200
 I made it I horns like a Nomás 

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:41.540
 hobby I did not want to do a tutorial for 

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:44.290
 tell you that it has to be like the 

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:48.200
 they have to do I just did them 

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:50.600
 as a hobby I simply repair my 

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:54.640
 things and if I do not want to buy them then 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:57.110
 I just make them build them and 

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:59.240
 it was just what I did and all 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:03.290
 the friends who have asked me for the plans 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:07.970
 this I regret to tell you that not 

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:10.430
 I have plans I made it I had not had 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:15.440
 to disarm but I was measuring piece by 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:17.540
 piece to the horn part and this one 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:19.670
 speaker crate and that was the only 

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:21.560
 way I did it I did not do it 

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:24.170
 with a purpose of making horns and 

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:27.640
 sell I did not for the purpose of 

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:30.550
 do plans and do a tutorial 

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:34.780
 just normal I did it with an elbow 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:37.330
 but thanks to all of them that 

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:40.199
 have subscribed to my channel 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:42.729
 and I thank you in advance too 

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:46.590
 well also not to notice the 

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:50.169
 you carry or do not take it to heart 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:53.469
 servín arrivals of their horns 

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:55.509
 I just did an experiment 

00:05:53.469 --> 00:05:56.960
 and good has really worked very 

00:05:55.509 --> 00:05:59.330
 all right 

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:04.139
 and well as I say, I do not do the 

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:08.400
 things at least simply from what 

00:06:04.139 --> 00:06:10.800
 I investigate something and I start not to give it 

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:14.180
 hands to work and for example in this 

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:14.180
 case I am arranging same fine 

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:20.570
 investigate where they sell what things 

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:23.310
 occupies a crossover already to calculate in 

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:26.250
 how to calculate for 

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:29.310
 what kind but there is more or less how 

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:33.720
 calculate what kind of capacitors these 

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:36.100
 are the purposes to make a bypass 

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:41.710
 what for 

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:44.170
 and these are the ones that for example an ipad 

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:47.170
 of the first phase because what else can you use 

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:51.420
 a pure capacitor for an iPad 

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:51.420
 second phase he used 

00:06:51.689 --> 00:06:58.610
 the east cap is called 

00:06:54.590 --> 00:07:03.200
 the coil in parallel and the capacitors 

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:05.840
 in series on the positive side of the GDP and 

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:09.040
 in the case of the media because it 

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:12.860
 have invested the coil is placed in 

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:15.890
 series with the positive and the capacitor in 

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:18.230
 parallel in the two poles then good 

00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:20.360
 I do not want to say more things no more than 

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:23.849
 beforehand what I tell you and let me know 

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:27.840
 show them how 

00:07:23.849 --> 00:07:32.980
 as seen in this crossover 

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:35.020
 that is cut that goes like 3500 xerez 

00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:37.680
 the treble means I have no idea 

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:37.680
 still 

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:44.670
 and let me show you the 

00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:44.670
 the other this 

00:07:45.449 --> 00:07:52.189
 here is the eyes how soldiers were left 

00:07:48.779 --> 00:07:52.189
 the part 

00:07:53.050 --> 00:08:00.370
 in another well see that they are two horns 

00:07:55.650 --> 00:08:02.440
 this is the horn we place and so 

00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:04.690
 there were jobs in the back 

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:07.990
 clean I do not dedicate myself to repair or anything 

00:08:04.690 --> 00:08:12.160
 I only repair our own my 

00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:16.360
 own equipment I make my own cables 

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:20.580
 Well, it's a greeting to all 

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:20.580
 heavy l subscribers
