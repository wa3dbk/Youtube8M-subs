00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:24.440
 Boys! 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:25.780
 What is it? 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.600
 Listen. I just came up with the best idea ever. 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.080
 Yes? 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.280
 Yes. I finally have a solution for our problems, guys. 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.540
 I know how we can escape from this rotten life and make something of ourselves. 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:41.340
 How? 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.340
 We're going ... to Kashyyyk. 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:48.660
 Kashyyyk? 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:49.800
 Kashyyyk. 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:50.880
 Kashyyyk? 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:52.640
 Kashyyyk. 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:54.220
 What do you mean, Kashyyyk? 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.140
 Because it's possible. 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.220
 Again, why Kashyyyk? 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.960
 Do not you get it? Kashyyyk is the place to be. 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.260
 The place to be? 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:13.120
 Yes! Kashyyyk is cheap, there are a lot of trees and most importantly, it is the home planet of the Wookies. 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:18.080
 Guest, Wookies are mean. They will tear your head off if they get the chance. 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.480
 Not really. Wookies are awesome! And they are a lot nicer than the debiles here. 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.020
 So what do you say, boys? Are you coming with me? 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:28.160
 No. 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:29.420
 No. 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.720
 Why not? 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:35.100
 Unlike you, we don't want to be beheaded. We love life. 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:39.340
 Whatever. You watch it! I'm going to live in paradise. 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.180
 Okay, you win. Here's your money. 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.940
 I told you he would go crazy. 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
 'What is that?' 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
 'No idea.' 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:13.640
 Greetings from the same kind of planet! 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
 "Who the hell is this debile?" 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.700
 Yes, I am going to live with your fantastic creatures. 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.000
 "Let's kill this bitch!" 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.840
 So, let's start looking for food. I rattle. What do you normally eat? 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.000
 'Get him!'
