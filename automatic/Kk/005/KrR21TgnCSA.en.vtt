hey everyone today I'll be showing you
how<00:00:02.850> I<00:00:03.030> make<00:00:03.360> my<00:00:03.570> controllable<00:00:04.200> lighting<00:00:04.560> as<00:00:04.710> I

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.100 
how I make my controllable lighting as I

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.570 
how I make my controllable lighting as I
used<00:00:05.370> in<00:00:05.549> my<00:00:05.670> bathroom<00:00:06.089> video<00:00:07.160> what<00:00:08.160> this<00:00:08.309> is

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
used in my bathroom video what this is

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.629 
used in my bathroom video what this is
is<00:00:09.059> Pistons<00:00:09.599> which<00:00:09.929> move<00:00:10.260> away<00:00:10.410> from<00:00:10.639> what

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
is Pistons which move away from what

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:12.950 
is Pistons which move away from what
which<00:00:11.820> moves<00:00:12.120> out<00:00:12.269> the<00:00:12.360> piece<00:00:12.509> of<00:00:12.660> stone<00:00:12.840> away

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
which moves out the piece of stone away

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.709 
which moves out the piece of stone away
and<00:00:13.259> lets<00:00:13.440> the<00:00:13.559> light<00:00:13.590> source<00:00:13.920> through<00:00:14.280> as<00:00:14.719> you

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
and lets the light source through as you

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.090 
and lets the light source through as you
can<00:00:15.870> see<00:00:16.199> I'll<00:00:16.500> just<00:00:16.859> drop<00:00:17.190> off<00:00:17.340> the<00:00:17.460> light

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:19.100 
can see I'll just drop off the light

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.710 
can see I'll just drop off the light
okay<00:00:20.100> so<00:00:20.160> that's<00:00:20.400> really<00:00:20.580> dark<00:00:20.939> and<00:00:21.300> then<00:00:21.480> if

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
okay so that's really dark and then if

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.840 
okay so that's really dark and then if
you<00:00:21.869> want<00:00:22.020> to<00:00:22.080> bright<00:00:22.260> it<00:00:22.439> up<00:00:22.850> controllable

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
you want to bright it up controllable

eight<00:00:45.870> of<00:00:46.140> those<00:00:46.320> lighting<00:00:48.980> mechanisms<00:00:49.980> and

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510 
eight of those lighting mechanisms and

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:55.610 
eight of those lighting mechanisms and
yeah<00:00:51.510> just<00:00:51.719> to<00:00:51.809> get<00:00:51.930> started<00:00:53.180> make<00:00:54.180> this<00:00:54.620> three

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
hi I'm just making the base layers for

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.700 
hi I'm just making the base layers for
the<00:01:01.980> room<00:01:02.250> and<00:01:02.719> we<00:01:03.719> want<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:03.960> daughter<00:01:04.229> and

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
the room and we want the daughter and

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:10.609 
the room and we want the daughter and
the<00:01:05.600> roof<00:01:08.360> and<00:01:09.360> if<00:01:10.049> you<00:01:10.350> haven't<00:01:10.500> noticed

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
the roof and if you haven't noticed

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.100 
the roof and if you haven't noticed
already<00:01:11.000> to<00:01:12.000> get<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.299> piston<00:01:12.479> working<00:01:13.020> the

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
already to get the piston working the

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.840 
already to get the piston working the
red<00:01:13.260> stone<00:01:13.439> has<00:01:13.680> to<00:01:13.830> go<00:01:13.920> directly<00:01:14.430> to<00:01:14.670> it<00:01:14.790> a

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
red stone has to go directly to it a

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.810 
red stone has to go directly to it a
combo<00:01:15.180> in<00:01:15.270> a<00:01:15.299> side<00:01:15.630> woods<00:01:15.930> angle<00:01:16.490> so<00:01:17.490> that<00:01:17.520> can

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
combo in a side woods angle so that can

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.160 
combo in a side woods angle so that can
be<00:01:17.850> a<00:01:17.970> little<00:01:18.210> tricky<00:01:18.299> when<00:01:18.750> you're<00:01:18.900> doing

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
be a little tricky when you're doing

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.810 
be a little tricky when you're doing
like<00:01:19.320> a<00:01:19.530> big<00:01:19.770> setup<00:01:20.130> of<00:01:20.340> redstone<00:01:22.640> so<00:01:23.640> it's

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
like a big setup of redstone so it's

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.270 
like a big setup of redstone so it's
good<00:01:24.000> to<00:01:24.180> have<00:01:24.439> make<00:01:25.439> sure<00:01:25.619> will<00:01:25.860> make<00:01:26.100> sure

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
good to have make sure will make sure

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.109 
good to have make sure will make sure
that<00:01:26.310> it<00:01:27.000> can<00:01:27.240> go<00:01:28.200> together<00:01:28.350> well<00:01:28.880> I'll<00:01:29.880> show

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
that it can go together well I'll show

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.310 
that it can go together well I'll show
you<00:01:30.180> me<00:01:30.420> in<00:01:30.479> a<00:01:30.600> second<00:01:32.840> alright<00:01:33.840> so<00:01:34.020> that's<00:01:34.140> the

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
you me in a second alright so that's the

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.890 
you me in a second alright so that's the
base<00:01:34.530> and<00:01:35.030> we<00:01:36.030> want<00:01:36.390> the<00:01:36.869> lighting<00:01:37.680> right<00:01:38.130> the

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:38.900 
base and we want the lighting right the

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:44.840 
base and we want the lighting right the
piston<00:01:40.520> the<00:01:42.049> place<00:01:43.049> is<00:01:43.290> stone<00:01:43.619> block<00:01:44.369> onto<00:01:44.610> the

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
piston the place is stone block onto the

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.980 
piston the place is stone block onto the
piston<00:01:45.240> and<00:01:46.939> this<00:01:47.939> is<00:01:48.090> what<00:01:48.240> i<00:01:48.270> do<00:01:48.390> to<00:01:48.540> block

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
piston and this is what i do to block

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.520 
piston and this is what i do to block
off<00:01:49.170> any<00:01:49.439> surrounding<00:01:49.860> light<00:01:51.110> you<00:01:52.110> just<00:01:52.350> make

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
off any surrounding light you just make

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.940 
off any surrounding light you just make
this<00:01:52.740> a<00:01:53.420> circle<00:01:54.420> around<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:54.899> circle<00:01:55.770> square

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
this a circle around the circle square

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.260 
this a circle around the circle square
around<00:01:56.310> this<00:01:56.579> bit<00:01:56.969> and<00:01:58.520> the<00:01:59.520> glowstone<00:01:59.939> goes

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
around this bit and the glowstone goes

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.969 
around this bit and the glowstone goes
right<00:02:00.659> in<00:02:00.750> the<00:02:00.810> center<00:02:01.110> because<00:02:01.320> the<00:02:01.619> stone

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
right in the center because the stone

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:07.280 
right in the center because the stone
will<00:02:02.159> move<00:02:02.340> in<00:02:02.520> and<00:02:02.729> block<00:02:03.570> it<00:02:03.600> off<00:02:06.140> so<00:02:07.140> there

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
will move in and block it off so there

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.800 
will move in and block it off so there
we<00:02:07.409> go<00:02:07.670> and<00:02:08.670> now<00:02:08.819> we<00:02:08.879> just<00:02:09.209> want<00:02:09.360> to<00:02:09.420> wear<00:02:09.599> it<00:02:09.629> up

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
we go and now we just want to wear it up

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.370 
we go and now we just want to wear it up
you<00:02:09.959> can<00:02:10.080> use<00:02:10.259> vertical

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
you can use vertical

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.210 
you can use vertical
iron<00:02:12.500> or<00:02:12.830> you<00:02:13.010> can<00:02:13.220> just<00:02:13.850> do<00:02:14.060> what<00:02:14.210> I<00:02:14.240> do<00:02:15.070> as<00:02:16.070> I

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
iron or you can just do what I do as I

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.910 
iron or you can just do what I do as I
find<00:02:16.460> that<00:02:16.550> easier<00:02:16.700> and<00:02:17.290> what<00:02:18.290> happens<00:02:18.680> is<00:02:18.800> the

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
find that easier and what happens is the

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.310 
find that easier and what happens is the
lever<00:02:19.190> will<00:02:19.340> be<00:02:19.460> inside<00:02:19.820> there<00:02:20.120> and<00:02:20.270> that<00:02:21.140> can

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:21.320 
lever will be inside there and that can

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.620 
lever will be inside there and that can
travel<00:02:21.590> when<00:02:22.250> the<00:02:22.340> redstone<00:02:22.730> sideways<00:02:23.210> it's

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
travel when the redstone sideways it's

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:28.840 
travel when the redstone sideways it's
all<00:02:23.810> cool<00:02:23.990> and<00:02:24.760> ok<00:02:27.370> so<00:02:28.370> what<00:02:28.520> we're<00:02:28.640> going<00:02:28.760> to

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:28.850 
all cool and ok so what we're going to

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:33.000 
all cool and ok so what we're going to
do<00:02:28.970> is<00:02:29.120> we're<00:02:29.300> going<00:02:29.420> to<00:02:29.480> add<00:02:30.220> another<00:02:31.660> little

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
do is we're going to add another little

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.410 
do is we're going to add another little
addition<00:02:34.010> to<00:02:34.130> this<00:02:34.280> so<00:02:34.580> the<00:02:34.730> redstone<00:02:35.240> can

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
addition to this so the redstone can

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.100 
addition to this so the redstone can
loop<00:02:35.630> round<00:02:36.220> and<00:02:37.220> go<00:02:37.490> straight<00:02:38.300> to<00:02:38.420> the<00:02:38.630> piston

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
loop round and go straight to the piston

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.920 
loop round and go straight to the piston
so<00:02:39.230> it<00:02:39.320> will<00:02:39.410> work<00:02:39.620> and<00:02:40.420> i've<00:02:41.420> added<00:02:41.450> this

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
so it will work and i've added this

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.650 
so it will work and i've added this
redstone<00:02:42.320> i've<00:02:43.190> started<00:02:43.460> this<00:02:43.610> current<00:02:44.120> of

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
redstone i've started this current of

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:49.890 
redstone i've started this current of
redstone<00:02:45.590> right<00:02:46.010> here<00:02:46.460> i<00:02:46.670> think<00:02:47.060> and<00:02:48.400> yeah

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
redstone right here i think and yeah

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.680 
redstone right here i think and yeah
that's<00:02:50.900> all<00:02:51.230> it<00:02:51.440> is<00:02:51.470> basically<00:02:52.270> so<00:02:53.270> just<00:02:53.510> make

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
that's all it is basically so just make

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:55.840 
that's all it is basically so just make
sure<00:02:53.720> your<00:02:54.140> redstone<00:02:54.500> is<00:02:54.920> a<00:02:55.190> path<00:02:55.550> like<00:02:55.790> this

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:55.850 
sure your redstone is a path like this

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.680 
sure your redstone is a path like this
I'll<00:02:56.210> show<00:02:56.780> you<00:02:56.840> it<00:02:57.080> won't<00:02:57.230> work<00:02:57.410> if<00:02:58.690> it's

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690 
I'll show you it won't work if it's

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:02.170 
I'll show you it won't work if it's
sideways<00:03:00.050> I'm<00:03:00.560> not<00:03:01.130> sure<00:03:01.220> why<00:03:01.520> it<00:03:01.580> probably

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
sideways I'm not sure why it probably

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:03.970 
sideways I'm not sure why it probably
should<00:03:02.270> as<00:03:02.720> you<00:03:03.170> can<00:03:03.260> see<00:03:03.410> the<00:03:03.530> Pistons<00:03:03.830> it's

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
should as you can see the Pistons it's

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.610 
should as you can see the Pistons it's
not<00:03:04.130> working<00:03:04.430> so<00:03:04.610> ya<00:03:05.420> have<00:03:05.720> it<00:03:05.870> going<00:03:06.470> like

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
not working so ya have it going like

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.600 
not working so ya have it going like
this<00:03:06.940> so<00:03:07.940> make<00:03:08.150> sure<00:03:08.180> you<00:03:08.740> design<00:03:09.740> your<00:03:09.770> layout

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:10.610 
this so make sure you design your layout

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:13.600 
this so make sure you design your layout
very<00:03:11.000> carefully<00:03:11.620> this<00:03:12.620> is<00:03:12.770> my<00:03:12.920> bathroom<00:03:13.160> one

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:13.610 
very carefully this is my bathroom one

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:16.030 
very carefully this is my bathroom one
as<00:03:13.940> you<00:03:14.180> can<00:03:14.270> see<00:03:14.450> it's<00:03:14.570> a<00:03:14.630> lot<00:03:14.870> of<00:03:15.050> wiring<00:03:15.680> so

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
as you can see it's a lot of wiring so

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.400 
as you can see it's a lot of wiring so
just<00:03:16.190> make<00:03:16.370> sure<00:03:16.580> you<00:03:16.760> won't<00:03:16.940> get<00:03:17.090> it<00:03:17.410> have

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410 
just make sure you won't get it have

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:20.680 
just make sure you won't get it have
problems<00:03:19.040> when<00:03:19.310> you're<00:03:19.640> setting<00:03:20.570> up

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
problems when you're setting up

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:22.960 
problems when you're setting up
everything<00:03:21.410> because<00:03:22.010> I<00:03:22.130> do<00:03:22.190> that<00:03:22.550> I<00:03:22.580> had<00:03:22.850> to

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
everything because I do that I had to

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.350 
everything because I do that I had to
move<00:03:23.120> the<00:03:23.240> lights<00:03:23.420> around<00:03:23.660> but<00:03:23.930> yeah<00:03:24.260> and

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:25.360 
move the lights around but yeah and

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.820 
move the lights around but yeah and
that's<00:03:26.360> about<00:03:26.540> all<00:03:26.690> there<00:03:27.050> is<00:03:27.170> to<00:03:27.410> it<00:03:27.440> I'll
