kind of shimmery creamy taupe and we're

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:41.700 
kind of shimmery creamy taupe and we're
going<00:02:40.600> to<00:02:40.630> put<00:02:40.720> this<00:02:40.930> all<00:02:41.140> over<00:02:41.170> the<00:02:41.500> lid

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:41.710 
going to put this all over the lid

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:44.070 
going to put this all over the lid
because<00:02:42.430> she's<00:02:42.700> wearing<00:02:43.000> almost<00:02:43.180> nothing<00:02:43.510> on

because she's wearing almost nothing on

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.050 
because she's wearing almost nothing on
the<00:02:44.230> lid<00:02:44.380> so<00:02:44.560> the<00:02:44.680> eyes<00:02:44.800> are<00:02:45.190> incredibly<00:02:45.850> easy

now I'm gonna go back to that mac 266
brush<00:02:48.790> and<00:02:48.970> I'm<00:02:49.000> going<00:02:49.060> to<00:02:49.180> take<00:02:49.330> rocket<00:02:49.600> our

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
brush and I'm going to take rocket our

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.710 
brush and I'm going to take rocket our
public<00:02:50.080> eye<00:02:50.230> shadow<00:02:50.500> in<00:02:51.060> saturate<00:02:52.060> it<00:02:52.270> is<00:02:52.570> a

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
public eye shadow in saturate it is a

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.890 
public eye shadow in saturate it is a
deep<00:02:52.990> Navy<00:02:53.260> and<00:02:53.590> she<00:02:54.580> was<00:02:55.360> looking<00:02:55.480> closely

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
deep Navy and she was looking closely

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.810 
deep Navy and she was looking closely
and<00:02:56.110> I<00:02:56.140> think<00:02:56.410> that<00:02:56.590> this<00:02:56.770> is<00:02:56.830> a<00:02:57.010> Navy<00:02:57.430> and<00:02:57.700> not

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:57.820 
and I think that this is a Navy and not

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:05.250 
and I think that this is a Navy and not
a<00:02:57.850> black<00:02:58.180> and<00:03:03.300> that<00:03:04.300> goes<00:03:04.540> all<00:03:04.750> the<00:03:04.780> way<00:03:05.020> to<00:03:05.080> the

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
a black and that goes all the way to the

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:19.800 
a black and that goes all the way to the
inner<00:03:05.410> corner

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:21.449 

and<00:03:19.900> then<00:03:20.530> I'm<00:03:20.620> going<00:03:20.770> to<00:03:20.830> do<00:03:20.950> the<00:03:21.069> same<00:03:21.220> thing

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 
and then I'm going to do the same thing

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:25.920 
and then I'm going to do the same thing
on<00:03:21.640> the<00:03:21.790> upper<00:03:22.060> lashes<00:03:24.569> just<00:03:25.569> going<00:03:25.750> to<00:03:25.810> make

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
on the upper lashes just going to make

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:27.210 
on the upper lashes just going to make

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 
the lashes look thicker and fuller

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:31.850 
the lashes look thicker and fuller
because<00:03:28.950> she<00:03:29.950> is<00:03:30.099> not<00:03:30.370> wearing<00:03:30.700> mascara

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.520 
really bright and we're just trying to
conceal<00:04:03.340> any<00:04:04.120> super<00:04:04.690> dark<00:04:04.900> circles<00:04:05.260> but<00:04:05.380> she

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
conceal any super dark circles but she

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:06.900 
conceal any super dark circles but she
actually<00:04:05.709> keeps<00:04:06.220> a<00:04:06.370> little<00:04:06.610> bit<00:04:06.730> of<00:04:06.819> the

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:06.910 
actually keeps a little bit of the

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:09.390 
actually keeps a little bit of the
darkness<00:04:07.390> right<00:04:08.230> in<00:04:08.410> there<00:04:08.590> so<00:04:08.920> I'm<00:04:09.160> just

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 
darkness right in there so I'm just

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:14.910 
darkness right in there so I'm just
going<00:04:09.519> to<00:04:09.580> blend<00:04:09.790> this<00:04:09.910> out<00:04:13.530> and<00:04:14.530> then<00:04:14.590> this

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:14.920 
going to blend this out and then this

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.349 
going to blend this out and then this
pile<00:04:15.130> is<00:04:15.160> also<00:04:15.610> awesome<00:04:15.670> because<00:04:15.970> it<00:04:16.060> comes

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:16.359 
pile is also awesome because it comes

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:17.789 
pile is also awesome because it comes
with<00:04:16.479> a<00:04:16.600> powder<00:04:17.049> so<00:04:17.380> I'm<00:04:17.470> going<00:04:17.590> to<00:04:17.620> take<00:04:17.769> a

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:17.799 
with a powder so I'm going to take a

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:19.920 
with a powder so I'm going to take a
little<00:04:17.950> bit<00:04:18.130> that<00:04:18.280> powder<00:04:18.519> now<00:04:18.820> and<00:04:19.180> i'm<00:04:19.900> just

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:19.930 
little bit that powder now and i'm just

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:25.460 
little bit that powder now and i'm just
going<00:04:20.139> to<00:04:20.169> use<00:04:20.260> that<00:04:20.380> to<00:04:20.829> set<00:04:21.280> the<00:04:21.459> concealer

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:28.110 

now<00:04:26.470> she<00:04:26.530> actually<00:04:26.800> is<00:04:27.130> a<00:04:27.160> tiny<00:04:27.580> bit<00:04:27.850> bronze

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.120
