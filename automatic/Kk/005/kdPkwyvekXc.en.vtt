00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:33.350 
the century you know 1890s 1900 it could

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.430 
the century you know 1890s 1900 it could
be<00:00:33.500> as<00:00:33.620> late<00:00:33.830> as<00:00:33.860> the<00:00:34.129> 1920s<00:00:34.520> or<00:00:35.059> 30s<00:00:35.170> it's<00:00:36.170> hard

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:36.440 
be as late as the 1920s or 30s it's hard

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.220 
be as late as the 1920s or 30s it's hard
to<00:00:36.530> tell<00:00:36.739> the<00:00:37.430> finish<00:00:37.910> really<00:00:38.390> isn't<00:00:38.720> bad<00:00:39.199> I

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:39.230 
to tell the finish really isn't bad I

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:40.960 
to tell the finish really isn't bad I
think<00:00:39.650> that<00:00:39.770> we<00:00:39.890> can<00:00:40.070> after<00:00:40.370> we've<00:00:40.640> done<00:00:40.670> the

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:40.970 
think that we can after we've done the

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:43.170 
think that we can after we've done the
veneer<00:00:41.300> repairs<00:00:41.690> we<00:00:41.930> can<00:00:42.080> clean<00:00:42.410> it<00:00:42.559> up<00:00:42.620> and

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:43.180 
veneer repairs we can clean it up and

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.570
