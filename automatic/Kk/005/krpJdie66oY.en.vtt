00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:04.629
 hello thank you for your time and thanks for 

00:00:02.649 --> 00:00:08.500
 watch this video what we are going to do 

00:00:04.629 --> 00:00:12.070
 now by request is a horchata of 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:15.940
 strawberry is delicious the normal horchata 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:19.090
 The same is tasty but strawberry 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:22.330
 richer what we are going to do is if 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:25.620
 can one day soak the rice and the 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:29.910
 cinnamon here we have 

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:33.950
 three cups of rice 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:38.300
 and a cinnamon 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:41.920
 and we're going to soak it with three quarters 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.920
 the liter of water 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:48.280
 and we're going to leave it all night and 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:51.930
 we arrived at 8 o'clock 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.930
 and we give it back a little 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:58.440
 and we will leave it 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:58.440
 until we need it 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:04.050
 now here this is optional 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:10.740
 it's better if you can do it just as well 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:13.860
 from before here we are going to make the syrup 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.630
 or if not just pure sugar when 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.610
 make the water but this fits better 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.490
 better seditions the sugar when it does 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:23.270
 the syrup 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:26.450
 a liter of water in a pot we go to 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:28.670
 medium heat heat the water that does not 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.250
 come to boil that not very hot 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:34.820
 because there we are going to dissolve to dissolve 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:36.990
 our sugar that are two cups for 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:39.659
 that is diluted 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:43.130
 the best possible sugar for our 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:46.250
 flat here we have hot water 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:48.520
 he did not come to the boil 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:51.600
 and we're going 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.600
 the famous 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.439
 also little by little 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:04.570
 beating 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:07.000
 until it is diluted and the sugar 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:09.940
 that's why we do not have water very 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.450
 hot because if it does not crystallize that 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.450
 makes us 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.870
 so we do not want 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:23.370
 it's like 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.370
 that's not distributing the city well 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.090
 since this list 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:35.230
 she pays her out of the fire 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:37.920
 heating the water 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:43.060
 exc well diluted 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:46.290
 and we'll leave it out 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.290
 to cool 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:58.090
 our flat we have here all the 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:03:00.250
 ingredients in the video will be the 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.340
 we also have the quantities 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:05.610
 try to name 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:10.220
 here we have the syrup that we made the 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:14.370
 yesterday is already ready cold you have a 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:16.379
 liter of water and two cups of matters what 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.930
 what do you have if you do not make the syrup 

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:21.239
 just put the extra liter of water 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:24.230
 and the two cups of sugar 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:29.940
 we are expecting a spoonful of vanilla 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:32.610
 we have two condensed milk and one 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:35.700
 evaporated milk from common cans of 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:38.810
 the girls and we have a pound and a half 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:41.690
 of strawberries already cleaned and washed 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:45.590
 we take away the green and now we go well 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:47.569
 and we have our rice that are three 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:49.730
 cups of rice 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:53.599
 a cinnamon 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:56.840
 and three quarters of a liter of water and 

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:58.790
 enough ice to taste 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:02.930
 and the first thing we're going to do is 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:04.550
 let's go out and play our rice first 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:05.920
 we're going to strain it, we're going to put it 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:08.950
 our hydro jet 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:11.980
 let's avoid admitting the noise of the 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:13.420
 blender let's put first our 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:16.840
 rice 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:19.269
 here is already liquefied it the most 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:22.150
 We could the rice with the cinnamon for 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:23.800
 get him out as much as possible and we're going to 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:26.050
 populate when we are putting it to 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:28.900
 our water here we already have 4 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:31.120
 liters of water ready in our filter 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:34.060
 ready we put the rice and cinnamon 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:36.040
 that we had liquefied them and put them in 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:39.580
 our glass again we pay it 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:42.639
 we have the strawberries and we are going to put 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:45.099
 half of our syrup 

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:48.930
 more or less to put it processed in 

00:04:45.099 --> 00:04:51.260
 to liquefy the criticisms 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:54.500
 and we are going to liquefy 

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:56.480
 our shots that we put also for 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:05:01.490
 commercial and we go as much as we could 

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:04.620
 our strawberries and like cabbage or if 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:08.140
 something but that's the way it goes 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:11.930
 but well well liquefied 

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:16.420
 Now what we are going to do is liquefy the 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:21.550
 rest of our stuff its ingredients 

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:21.550
 let's put the rest of the sector 

00:05:22.439 --> 00:05:25.439
 d 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:34.039
 the milk 

00:05:30.689 --> 00:05:34.039
 evaporated milk 

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:42.310
 and the two condensed milk and we're going 

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:44.200
 to liquefy the reason why we had it 

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:46.870
 to the blender is to mix and 

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:52.560
 the best possible here are all 

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:52.560
 our creams and emilia well mixed 

00:05:55.210 --> 00:06:04.430
 and we're going to finish the ice 

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:07.330
 and ready let's avoid 

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:07.330
 noise 

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:22.260
 and here as you can see it is not pink 

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:26.270
 people would like to see it 

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:26.270
 but we are going to put a little 

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:31.420
 a few drops of pink paint 

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:51.570
 and as you need them most fritters him 

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:51.570
 let's put it to color 

00:06:53.860 --> 00:07:00.580
 we have the color we want 

00:06:56.910 --> 00:07:10.659
 and the taste we want 

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:12.939
 We serve if you want to adjust the flavor to 

00:07:10.659 --> 00:07:15.550
 I do not recommend that you not be 

00:07:12.939 --> 00:07:17.630
 throwing ice but reduce so much if 

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:20.210
 puts it in a 

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:21.590
 container with ice if you put it up 

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:24.530
 of a container with ice for 

00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:28.330
 keep it cold and not have to be 

00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:31.120
 putting more ice because it would lower 

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:34.810
 the taste and 

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:37.150
 the texture I hope you enjoy it is 

00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:40.380
 very many thanks for watching 

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:40.380
 this video up
