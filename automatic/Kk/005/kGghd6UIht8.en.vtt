00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
that we've had sort of within our our

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.369 
that we've had sort of within our our
world<00:00:41.790> tender<00:00:42.329> to<00:00:42.629> go<00:00:42.750> pretty<00:00:42.930> well<00:00:43.050> at

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
world tender to go pretty well at

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:44.720 
world tender to go pretty well at
festivals<00:00:44.039> particularly<00:00:44.520> when<00:00:44.610> it's

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
festivals particularly when it's

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:45.980 
festivals particularly when it's
nighttime<00:00:44.910> I<00:00:45.239> think<00:00:45.420> people<00:00:45.539> are<00:00:45.690> ready<00:00:45.870> to

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:45.990

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:50.270 
nighttime I think people are ready to
dance<00:00:46.860> and<00:00:47.130> cut<00:00:47.310> loose<00:00:47.490> a<00:00:47.610> little<00:00:47.730> bit<00:00:47.990> but<00:00:49.280> but

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
dance and cut loose a little bit but but

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.110 
dance and cut loose a little bit but but
yeah<00:00:50.340> I<00:00:50.370> think<00:00:50.460> we're<00:00:50.640> definitely<00:00:50.760> playing

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120

all<00:00:51.360> those<00:00:51.540> tonight<00:00:52.290> it's<00:00:52.650> some<00:00:53.060> the<00:00:54.060> formula

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
all those tonight it's some the formula

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.760 
all those tonight it's some the formula
for<00:00:54.510> playing<00:00:54.900> festivals<00:00:55.350> is<00:00:55.500> not<00:00:55.650> that

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
for playing festivals is not that

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:56.960 
for playing festivals is not that

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:56.970 
complicated you know you just got to

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:59.540 
complicated you know you just got to
give<00:00:57.150> people<00:00:57.270> I<00:00:57.660> think<00:00:58.350> some<00:00:58.649> a<00:00:58.980> bit<00:00:59.310> of

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
give people I think some a bit of

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.300 
give people I think some a bit of
familiarity<00:00:59.910> but<00:01:00.360> also<00:01:00.510> sort<00:01:00.989> of<00:01:01.190> you<00:01:02.190> know

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:02.310 
familiarity but also sort of you know

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:04.549 
familiarity but also sort of you know

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:41.870 
bunch of sort of unreleased material
from<00:01:40.140> from<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.650> recording<00:01:40.950> sessions<00:01:41.280> of<00:01:41.460> our

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
from from the recording sessions of our

from from the recording sessions of our
recent<00:01:42.060> records<00:01:42.540> so<00:01:42.720> so<00:01:43.409> that's<00:01:43.560> what<00:01:43.680> another

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
recent records so so that's what another

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.980 
recent records so so that's what another
exciting<00:01:44.189> thing<00:01:44.520> that<00:01:44.700> I<00:01:44.729> guess<00:01:44.939> is<00:01:45.119> about<00:01:45.750> to

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
exciting thing that I guess is about to

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.960 
exciting thing that I guess is about to
happen<00:01:46.080> well<00:01:47.070> and<00:01:47.280> what's<00:01:47.430> been<00:01:47.610> up<00:01:47.640> with<00:01:47.880> the

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
happen well and what's been up with the

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.399 
happen well and what's been up with the
new<00:01:48.090> tunes<00:01:48.330> you<00:01:48.479> mentioned<00:01:48.810> how's<00:01:48.930> that<00:01:49.140> going

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
new tunes you mentioned how's that going

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.910 
new tunes you mentioned how's that going
I<00:01:50.510> guess<00:01:51.510> it's<00:01:51.689> hard<00:01:51.840> sometimes<00:01:52.080> when<00:01:52.470> when

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
I guess it's hard sometimes when when

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.920 
I guess it's hard sometimes when when

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
almost a bit of a research mission when

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.510

festivals<00:02:07.110> like<00:02:07.140> this<00:02:07.380> you'll<00:02:07.500> see<00:02:07.619> a<00:02:07.650> lot<00:02:07.770> of

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:07.830 
festivals like this you'll see a lot of

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:09.850 
festivals like this you'll see a lot of
other<00:02:08.009> bands<00:02:08.250> so<00:02:08.489> I<00:02:08.519> think<00:02:08.610> we're<00:02:08.849> sort<00:02:09.060> of

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
other bands so I think we're sort of

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.869 
other bands so I think we're sort of
absorbing<00:02:10.860> ideas<00:02:11.220> and<00:02:11.489> kind<00:02:11.670> of<00:02:11.760> getting

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
absorbing ideas and kind of getting

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:14.660 
absorbing ideas and kind of getting
inspired<00:02:12.299> for<00:02:12.720> for<00:02:13.349> the<00:02:13.439> next<00:02:13.650> record<00:02:13.829> but<00:02:14.280> we

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
inspired for for the next record but we

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.630 
inspired for for the next record but we
haven't<00:02:15.180> exactly<00:02:15.450> sort<00:02:15.870> of<00:02:15.930> put<00:02:16.170> pen<00:02:16.349> to<00:02:16.379> paper

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
haven't exactly sort of put pen to paper

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.149 
haven't exactly sort of put pen to paper
yet<00:02:17.640> so<00:02:17.849> to<00:02:17.939> speak<00:02:18.150> I<00:02:18.390> think<00:02:18.769> you<00:02:19.769> know<00:02:19.890> once<00:02:20.069> we

00:02:20.149 --> 00:02:20.159 
yet so to speak I think you know once we

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:21.770 
yet so to speak I think you know once we
once<00:02:20.549> we<00:02:20.640> finish<00:02:20.879> up<00:02:21.000> this<00:02:21.120> summer<00:02:21.390> touring

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
once we finish up this summer touring

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.120 
once we finish up this summer touring
session<00:02:22.110> we<00:02:22.200> might<00:02:22.380> sort<00:02:22.620> of<00:02:22.680> get<00:02:22.770> back<00:02:22.920> in<00:02:23.040> the

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130
