question<00:00:12.690> so<00:00:13.170> the<00:00:13.440> Bulgarian<00:00:13.889> method<00:00:14.190> so<00:00:14.429> I

00:00:14.659 --> 00:00:14.669 
question so the Bulgarian method so I

00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:17.390 
question so the Bulgarian method so I
didn't<00:00:15.450> experiment<00:00:15.870> with<00:00:16.020> this<00:00:16.200> method<00:00:16.470> maybe

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
didn't experiment with this method maybe

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.570 
didn't experiment with this method maybe
for<00:00:17.670> a<00:00:17.700> month<00:00:17.940> and<00:00:18.060> a<00:00:18.150> half<00:00:18.410> sometime<00:00:19.580> earlier

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
for a month and a half sometime earlier

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:26.060 
for a month and a half sometime earlier
and<00:00:22.010> I<00:00:23.010> was<00:00:23.730> hitting<00:00:23.910> one<00:00:24.390> of<00:00:24.420> Max's<00:00:25.080> relative

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
and I was hitting one of Max's relative

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.360 
and I was hitting one of Max's relative
one<00:00:26.220> rep<00:00:26.370> max<00:00:26.400> is<00:00:26.760> in<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:27.000> squat<00:00:27.650> and<00:00:28.650> again

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:29.370 
one rep max is in the squat and again

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:31.880 
one rep max is in the squat and again
doing<00:00:29.820> some<00:00:30.270> singles<00:00:30.660> on<00:00:30.720> the<00:00:30.750> bench<00:00:31.020> but<00:00:31.590> I

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
doing some singles on the bench but I

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.479 
doing some singles on the bench but I
felt<00:00:32.340> that<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:33.379> this<00:00:34.379> method<00:00:34.589> is<00:00:34.890> incomplete

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
felt that the this method is incomplete

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.400 
felt that the this method is incomplete
is<00:00:35.640> it<00:00:35.789> because<00:00:36.120> the<00:00:36.780> deadlift<00:00:37.170> gets

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
is it because the deadlift gets

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.619 
is it because the deadlift gets
neglected<00:00:37.649> so<00:00:38.250> when<00:00:38.699> I<00:00:38.730> was<00:00:38.910> on<00:00:39.030> this<00:00:39.210> method

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
neglected so when I was on this method

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.669 
neglected so when I was on this method
doing<00:00:40.170> a<00:00:40.499> winner<00:00:41.489> of<00:00:41.640> max<00:00:41.850> on<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.300> squat<00:00:42.809> and<00:00:43.079> I

00:00:43.669 --> 00:00:43.679 
doing a winner of max on the squat and I

00:00:43.679 --> 00:00:45.950 
doing a winner of max on the squat and I
wouldn't<00:00:43.920> run<00:00:44.010> maximan<00:00:44.370> Delap<00:00:44.730> everyday<00:00:45.120> felt

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
wouldn't run maximan Delap everyday felt

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.139 
wouldn't run maximan Delap everyday felt
that<00:00:46.230> there<00:00:46.800> wasn't<00:00:46.949> enough<00:00:47.339> volume<00:00:47.670> for<00:00:48.120> the

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
that there wasn't enough volume for the

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.709 
that there wasn't enough volume for the
bench<00:00:48.600> and<00:00:49.010> also<00:00:50.010> for<00:00:50.159> the<00:00:50.249> squad<00:00:50.550> I<00:00:50.820> was

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
bench and also for the squad I was

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.750 
bench and also for the squad I was
hitting<00:00:51.929> good<00:00:52.739> numbers<00:00:53.039> in<00:00:53.219> squat<00:00:53.460> but

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
hitting good numbers in squat but

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.759 
hitting good numbers in squat but
because<00:00:54.239> my<00:00:54.449> deadlift<00:00:54.809> you<00:00:55.260> know<00:00:55.379> doing<00:00:55.589> it

00:00:55.759 --> 00:00:55.769 
because my deadlift you know doing it

00:00:55.769 --> 00:00:59.149 
because my deadlift you know doing it
maybe<00:00:56.059> once<00:00:57.059> a<00:00:57.179> week<00:00:57.210> tops<00:00:57.800> it<00:00:58.800> really

00:00:59.149 --> 00:00:59.159 
maybe once a week tops it really

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:01.250 
maybe once a week tops it really
impacted<00:00:59.940> delat<00:01:00.390> especially<00:01:00.899> since<00:01:01.079> I'm<00:01:01.229> a

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
impacted delat especially since I'm a

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.889 
impacted delat especially since I'm a
sumo<00:01:01.530> deadlift<00:01:01.979> so<00:01:02.300> sorry<00:01:03.300> I'm<00:01:03.449> assumed<00:01:03.780> with

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
sumo deadlift so sorry I'm assumed with

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.860 
sumo deadlift so sorry I'm assumed with
that<00:01:04.050> lifter<00:01:04.350> so<00:01:04.730> the<00:01:05.730> movements<00:01:06.510> are<00:01:06.630> not

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:06.870 
that lifter so the movements are not

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:08.720 
that lifter so the movements are not
mutually<00:01:07.290> beneficial<00:01:07.770> so<00:01:08.250> if<00:01:08.490> you<00:01:08.610> don't

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:08.730 
mutually beneficial so if you don't

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:10.400 
mutually beneficial so if you don't
practice<00:01:08.970> sumo<00:01:09.480> deadlift<00:01:09.840> then<00:01:10.050> it'll

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:10.410 
practice sumo deadlift then it'll

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:13.610 
practice sumo deadlift then it'll
definitely<00:01:10.620> go<00:01:10.950> down<00:01:11.190> and<00:01:11.840> because<00:01:12.840> Parling

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:13.620 
definitely go down and because Parling

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:16.610 
definitely go down and because Parling
is<00:01:13.770> three<00:01:14.010> lift<00:01:14.220> sport<00:01:14.580> I<00:01:15.350> don't<00:01:16.350> recommend

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:16.620 
is three lift sport I don't recommend

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:19.040 
is three lift sport I don't recommend
the<00:01:16.890> Bulgarian<00:01:17.280> method<00:01:17.580> because<00:01:17.910> again<00:01:18.840> it's

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:19.050 
the Bulgarian method because again it's

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:21.950 
the Bulgarian method because again it's
more<00:01:19.410> squat<00:01:19.920> centric<00:01:20.400> and<00:01:20.580> it<00:01:21.510> won't<00:01:21.750> help

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
more squat centric and it won't help

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.470 
more squat centric and it won't help
develop<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:22.680> deadlift<00:01:23.370> especially<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.180> sumo

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:24.480

deadlift per se again that's just my

deadlift per se again that's just my

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
same concept as the Bulgarian method you

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.170 
same concept as the Bulgarian method you
squatting<00:02:23.260> hard<00:02:23.740> four<00:02:24.010> times<00:02:24.040> a<00:02:24.310> week<00:02:24.490> on<00:02:24.730> the

squatting hard four times a week on the
base<00:02:25.710> meso<00:02:26.710> cycle<00:02:27.220> and<00:02:27.750> it<00:02:28.750> doesn't<00:02:29.080> really

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
base meso cycle and it doesn't really

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.320 
base meso cycle and it doesn't really
emphasize<00:02:29.620> the<00:02:29.650> data<00:02:30.190> too<00:02:30.460> much<00:02:30.640> or<00:02:30.910> you're

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
emphasize the data too much or you're

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.210 
emphasize the data too much or you're
trying<00:02:31.570> to<00:02:31.840> ignore<00:02:32.320> the<00:02:32.470> death<00:02:32.650> completely

trying to ignore the death completely

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.040 
trying to ignore the death completely
and<00:02:33.400> again<00:02:33.850> it's<00:02:34.030> not<00:02:34.180> the<00:02:34.480> right<00:02:34.810> way<00:02:34.990> to

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
and again it's not the right way to

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:36.780 
and again it's not the right way to
approach<00:02:35.230> things<00:02:35.470> especially<00:02:36.250> if<00:02:36.670> you're

drive it's something that has to be

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959 
reinforced constantly so if you ignore

reinforced constantly so if you ignore

completely or do too little volume for

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:07.260 
completely or do too little volume for
the<00:03:05.830> similar<00:03:06.190> delat<00:03:06.520> then<00:03:06.730> it's<00:03:06.940> going<00:03:07.180> to

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:07.270 
the similar delat then it's going to

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:11.580 
the similar delat then it's going to
become<00:03:07.660> worse<00:03:08.459> so<00:03:09.600> so<00:03:10.600> that<00:03:10.780> is<00:03:10.959> correct<00:03:11.230> I

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
become worse so so that is correct I

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.680 
become worse so so that is correct I
mean<00:03:11.890> I<00:03:11.920> once<00:03:12.459> you<00:03:12.580> go<00:03:12.730> high<00:03:12.940> frequency<00:03:13.420> never

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
mean I once you go high frequency never

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:16.170 
mean I once you go high frequency never
go<00:03:13.900> back<00:03:14.110> so<00:03:14.550> that's<00:03:15.550> it<00:03:15.700> hopefully<00:03:15.910> that

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
go back so that's it hopefully that

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.380 
go back so that's it hopefully that
helps<00:03:16.510> and<00:03:16.750> thanks<00:03:16.780> for<00:03:17.320> watching
