00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:11.710
 I live in 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:25.140
 at level said ganim club and so great if 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:27.300
 no but 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.570
 diego of title band in the lack much 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:33.809
 there is nothing to gain in madrid the club more 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:36.390
 great to a club that has always fascinated me 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.790
 to be able to pray here and I'm pretty 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.010
 happy for is in the greatest the truth 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.769
 is that with horses I feel in this 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.800
 time is that I have already come won the selection 

00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:48.720
 and now in madrid things go more 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.210
 easy I can by our understanding 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:52.980
 we with the selection do not think it's a 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.079
 great player has a lot 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.020
 experience and that will bring many 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.900
 if things here to help 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.780
 team yes 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:05.710
 but in the opposition the central one was a 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.710
 more comfortable listing and 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.130
 in things maybe for me not 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:12.659
 pretty pretty trainer who works 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.179
 all right 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.579
 he likes his values ​​to be very 

00:01:15.179 --> 00:01:19.469
 staff and is always in the 

00:01:17.579 --> 00:01:22.200
 training with us so that 

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:24.420
 we fail and when we fail 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.150
 for as little as possible 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:30.090
 I was here with us had a 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.100
 very fast quality player works 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.930
 well for the team we also have to 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.050
 be very focused we have to be 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.300
 got into the game 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:39.860
 we the centrals have to be 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:44.410
 always a tad more in front of them 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.410
 because if we leave space 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:50.650
 always a match against opposites 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.870
 it can always be exciting because 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:56.590
 the last seasons I was there 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:58.240
 there always special party 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.880
 I think the Madridista prepared for 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:04.210
 contribute the game well and I hope to win 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.750
 because important for our path in 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:08.080
 our league 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:10.060
 if we had a position of 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.060
 last games I think that if not the 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:16.360
 tranquility the tissue are also 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:19.270
 because important to have when when 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:22.050
 are in this type of party so that 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:22.050
 the birds 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:32.750
 I think Indian football is not easy, 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:35.030
 who would say it's winning the barça but 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.569
 afterwards and have a good team to a 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:40.140
 equipment that has quality 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:44.590
 a team that is more mature does not carry 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:47.019
 two years in the first and good is a 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.790
 difficult match to base but the most 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:52.799
 important we concentrate on 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.799
 our and make our castle 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:58.850
 and I hope it's a good match both 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:02.640
 to talk about that as a journey but 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:04.740
 it's different from a new athlete 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.870
 defeats and goes there to look for an auditor 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:09.590
 the valence was calmer not 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:12.500
 he has to win to continue leading 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:14.020
 what I do an interesting match of 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:18.210
 look 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:18.210
 they arrive at the best of the tour of the field 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.310
 I live in
