the<00:01:38.260> good<00:01:38.409> thing<00:01:38.560> about<00:01:38.590> tail<00:01:39.040> slides<00:01:39.340> is<00:01:39.670> you

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.240 
the good thing about tail slides is you

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:41.820 
the good thing about tail slides is you
can<00:01:40.390> keep<00:01:40.510> a<00:01:40.600> good<00:01:40.720> flow<00:01:40.990> going<00:01:41.200> especially<00:01:41.740> on

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:41.830 
can keep a good flow going especially on

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:43.649 
can keep a good flow going especially on
a<00:01:41.860> mini-ramp<00:01:42.159> or<00:01:42.490> a<00:01:42.520> halfpipe<00:01:43.030> you<00:01:43.360> can<00:01:43.510> keep

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:43.659 
a mini-ramp or a halfpipe you can keep

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:45.870 
a mini-ramp or a halfpipe you can keep
hitting<00:01:43.810> walls<00:01:44.170> do<00:01:44.890> a<00:01:44.920> tail<00:01:45.190> slide<00:01:45.460> and<00:01:45.640> mix<00:01:45.760> it

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
hitting walls do a tail slide and mix it

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:52.950
