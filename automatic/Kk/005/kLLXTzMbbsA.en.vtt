00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:34.209
 You hear it? a breath stops when his footsteps approach 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:40.901
 Re scared? do not worry, they will not come for you. 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:47.809
 Although we fled to this place, I already knew it, I knew it 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:54.849
 Although we open the door, the cycle repeats itself. 

00:00:55.291 --> 00:00:59.930
 Someday, everyone will return. 

00:01:02.011 --> 00:01:07.450
 Repeat it now, destroy life. 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:20.481
 An endless cycle that envelops all solitary souls 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:35.040
 If someone breaks the cycle everything would repeat itself and come back here 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:22.520
 Do not ask for help, your voice will not be heard by anyone. 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:29.120
 It's something natural, there's no way you can escape. 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:35.940
 Cry, your moans will only bounce on the walls of this mansion. 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:43.080
 Okay, my ears have already heard that before. 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:48.350
 Be in peace, I will send you ... 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:55.600
 to desolate hell as to others 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:01.931
 The continuous cycle of rebirth 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:08.960
 it will be repeated one more time. 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:15.810
 We open the next door? 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:22.795
 without changing the world that is on the other side. 

00:03:51.460 --> 00:04:04.950
 An endless cycle that envelops all solitary souls 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:19.350
 If someone breaks the cycle, everything would repeat itself and come back here
