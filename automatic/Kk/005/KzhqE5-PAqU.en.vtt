we're<00:00:17.640> going<00:00:17.760> to<00:00:17.850> look<00:00:18.000> at<00:00:18.240> the<00:00:18.480> technology

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
we're going to look at the technology

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.660 
we're going to look at the technology
and<00:00:19.199> andrew<00:00:19.920> he<00:00:20.039> is<00:00:20.100> going<00:00:20.220> to<00:00:20.340> take<00:00:20.520> us

I'm Andrew Pauline from THX we're going

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:26.120 
I'm Andrew Pauline from THX we're going
to<00:00:25.170> spend<00:00:25.289> a<00:00:25.380> little<00:00:25.500> bit<00:00:25.590> of<00:00:25.680> time<00:00:25.920> talking

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
to spend a little bit of time talking

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.820 
to spend a little bit of time talking
about<00:00:26.369> media<00:00:26.820> director<00:00:27.269> a<00:00:27.800> technology<00:00:28.800> that

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
about media director a technology that

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.030 
about media director a technology that
we<00:00:29.279> have<00:00:29.460> developed<00:00:29.750> that<00:00:30.750> really<00:00:31.289> simplifies

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
we have developed that really simplifies

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.340 
we have developed that really simplifies
the<00:00:32.070> experience<00:00:33.059> for<00:00:33.239> the<00:00:33.329> user<00:00:33.480> so<00:00:34.110> a<00:00:34.140> couple

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
the experience for the user so a couple

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.310 
the experience for the user so a couple
things<00:00:34.500> happen<00:00:35.070> one<00:00:35.340> is<00:00:35.670> that<00:00:36.390> with<00:00:37.020> new

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
things happen one is that with new

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.920 
things happen one is that with new
technology<00:00:38.040> now<00:00:38.250> the<00:00:38.940> process<00:00:39.390> is<00:00:39.540> incredibly

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
technology now the process is incredibly

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.209 
technology now the process is incredibly
complicated<00:00:40.320> there's<00:00:40.770> all<00:00:40.890> these<00:00:40.980> different

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
complicated there's all these different

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:42.830 
complicated there's all these different
formats<00:00:41.730> that<00:00:41.910> all<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.180> technologies<00:00:42.809> and

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
formats that all the technologies and

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.420 
formats that all the technologies and
receivers<00:00:43.469> and<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:43.680> televisions<00:00:44.160> have<00:00:44.309> to

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
receivers and the televisions have to

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.090 
receivers and the televisions have to
support<00:00:44.760> and<00:00:45.000> now<00:00:45.480> we've<00:00:45.690> got<00:00:45.899> 3d<00:00:46.469> a<00:00:46.680> new<00:00:46.890> layer

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
support and now we've got 3d a new layer

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.520 
support and now we've got 3d a new layer
of<00:00:47.129> complexity<00:00:47.820> so<00:00:48.690> i'll<00:00:49.079> give<00:00:49.350> you<00:00:49.440> an

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
of complexity so i'll give you an

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.100 
of complexity so i'll give you an
example<00:00:49.620> one<00:00:50.430> of<00:00:50.520> the<00:00:50.610> things<00:00:50.760> is<00:00:51.059> to<00:00:51.480> my<00:00:51.660> left

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
example one of the things is to my left

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.850 
example one of the things is to my left
you<00:00:52.770> see<00:00:52.980> this<00:00:53.219> is<00:00:53.430> a<00:00:53.460> 3d<00:00:53.760> content<00:00:54.090> it's<00:00:54.570> a<00:00:54.860> left

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
you see this is a 3d content it's a left

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.540 
you see this is a 3d content it's a left
eye<00:00:56.039> and<00:00:56.070> right<00:00:56.610> eye<00:00:56.850> image<00:00:58.399> incorporate<00:00:59.399> into

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
eye and right eye image incorporate into

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.400 
eye and right eye image incorporate into
one<00:00:59.910> frame<00:01:00.270> that<00:01:00.660> gets<00:01:00.840> delivered<00:01:01.140> to<00:01:01.320> the

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
one frame that gets delivered to the

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.290 
one frame that gets delivered to the
television<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:02.340> television<00:01:02.640> needs<00:01:03.030> to<00:01:03.180> be

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
television the television needs to be

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.600 
television the television needs to be
set<00:01:03.570> up<00:01:03.600> properly<00:01:04.080> to<00:01:04.530> play<00:01:04.830> back<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.280> 3d

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
set up properly to play back the 3d

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.690 
set up properly to play back the 3d
content<00:01:05.850> you<00:01:06.689> as<00:01:06.840> a<00:01:06.869> user<00:01:07.140> have<00:01:07.799> to<00:01:08.010> go<00:01:08.159> in<00:01:08.400> grab

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
content you as a user have to go in grab

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.580 
content you as a user have to go in grab
the<00:01:08.850> remote<00:01:08.970> think<00:01:09.420> about<00:01:09.630> okay<00:01:10.020> and<00:01:10.200> my<00:01:10.290> left

media<00:01:18.390> director<00:01:18.840> takes<00:01:19.080> care<00:01:19.409> of<00:01:19.439> that<00:01:19.680> for

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
media director takes care of that for

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.770 
media director takes care of that for
you<00:01:20.130> so<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.759> question<00:01:21.090> is<00:01:21.210> how<00:01:21.390> do<00:01:21.450> we<00:01:21.600> do<00:01:21.750> it

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
you so the question is how do we do it

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.510 
you so the question is how do we do it
well<00:01:22.500> what<00:01:23.189> happens<00:01:23.610> when<00:01:23.820> contents<00:01:24.479> created

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 
well what happens when contents created

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.140 
well what happens when contents created
information<00:01:26.520> is<00:01:27.680> encoded<00:01:28.680> with<00:01:29.159> the<00:01:29.670> content

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
information is encoded with the content

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.179 
information is encoded with the content
what<00:01:30.450> we<00:01:30.540> call<00:01:30.720> metadata<00:01:31.049> it's<00:01:31.500> descriptive

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
what we call metadata it's descriptive

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.160 
what we call metadata it's descriptive
information<00:01:32.460> that<00:01:33.060> says<00:01:33.240> this<00:01:33.689> is<00:01:33.869> what<00:01:34.049> the
