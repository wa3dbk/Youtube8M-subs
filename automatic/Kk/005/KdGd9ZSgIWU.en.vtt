00:02:33.119 --> 00:02:33.129 
probably the the hop adjuster which sets

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:34.920 
probably the the hop adjuster which sets
up<00:02:33.280> here<00:02:33.430> in<00:02:33.519> the<00:02:33.610> scorpio<00:02:34.000> it's<00:02:34.480> just<00:02:34.660> a<00:02:34.750> quick

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
up here in the scorpio it's just a quick

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.520 
up here in the scorpio it's just a quick
dial<00:02:35.290> screw<00:02:35.760> so<00:02:36.760> if<00:02:36.910> the<00:02:37.060> day<00:02:37.239> gets<00:02:37.510> hot<00:02:37.690> or<00:02:38.290> you

dial screw so if the day gets hot or you

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.199 
dial screw so if the day gets hot or you
change<00:02:38.739> gas<00:02:39.099> or<00:02:39.370> anything<00:02:39.549> like<00:02:39.670> that<00:02:39.790> any

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:41.739 
reason it would mean you need to change

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:45.479 
reason it would mean you need to change
your<00:02:41.890> hop<00:02:42.099> you<00:02:43.060> can<00:02:43.269> do<00:02:43.480> by<00:02:43.810> hand<00:02:44.140> and<00:02:44.680> where<00:02:45.370> it

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:45.489 
your hop you can do by hand and where it

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:47.039 
your hop you can do by hand and where it
sits<00:02:45.640> under<00:02:45.849> the<00:02:46.060> scope<00:02:46.299> it's<00:02:46.840> easily

00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:47.049 
sits under the scope it's easily

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:49.500 
sits under the scope it's easily
accessible<00:02:47.769> but<00:02:47.980> not<00:02:48.220> so<00:02:48.519> that<00:02:49.150> it's<00:02:49.269> going<00:02:49.360> to

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
accessible but not so that it's going to

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.509 
accessible but not so that it's going to
get<00:02:49.599> knocked<00:02:49.780> off<00:02:50.049> or<00:02:50.290> anything<00:02:50.470> like<00:02:50.709> that<00:02:50.769> so
