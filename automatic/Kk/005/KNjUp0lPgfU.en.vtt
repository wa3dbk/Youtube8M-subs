00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.970
 Hi hello 

00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:10.620
 Well, recently Camino color is bright and there are a lot of stains . 

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:14.790
 Treatment 2 which does not wash away this time 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:19.470
 I would like to introduce you 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:24.160
 There is recently a bit not washed away the favorite treatments 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:27.800
 This redder's base oil is used to go recently 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:33.020
 I'm a hair treatment guy 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:38.390
 Well there are so many other things in this various aligner teasing treatment 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:39.570
 Why use Loretta's base oil ? 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.120
 I think 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.820
 First to 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:48.170
 And I keep 2 minutes 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.170
 8 is that way 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:55.250
 It is said that there is Lori 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:59.340
 It is called extraordinary oil of the place 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:00.740
 Well I used this oil 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:05.330
 Recently 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:11.340
 I 'm going to change to a little older person 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:15.820
 I say I think we as all the same would use Well I treatments not washed away 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:21.310
 What does it mean to be different? 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:24.340
 I tried it all in my own, but Loretta's base oil 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:28.390
 There is something that is different 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:34.960
 The smell is so cool 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:36.680
 I think if you know someone who has used wax, but I think that Rose system or that 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.450
 I say 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:42.159
 Softening Oh I 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:45.600
 There is a rose-like scent like that. 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:48.869
 Well I I I do not like is good to be so much 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:52.340
 Hey here loreal foal 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:54.640
 The smell of sweetness 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:02:00.040
 Plant-based 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:03.640
 It's a scent, but if you have a lot of pozzuroli, it won't last long 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:08.679
 For example, put this on that 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:10.009
 When I use it as a hair iron, it may be written out 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:15.730
 Here 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:15.730
 I tried using Loretta's base oil 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:23.030
 The great lord is the dissenting system 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:27.140
 I don't have that feeling so much Loretta's base oil 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:29.180
 If you use it, it will have immediate effect and you will find out once you use it once 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:32.670
 Than the others 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:38.160
 It is a good feeling to become a great smooth 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:41.900
 Well, my eyes washed my mouth and hair 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.900
 After the towel dry 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:49.390
 One When was Well flow Kuroko roughly one-push but it may not be visible now 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:58.340
 It is about push 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:59.710
 Extend to the space between the fingers in the wax and how to put it between the fingers, not attached to the root from the hair tip 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.370
 center 

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:05.750
 Maybe in the center of this house 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.750
 It feels like Najima 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:13.150
 Crowded massage and go crowded rubbing in the same feeling as a quack Stone 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:18.410
 Great 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:21.500
 Hair and effect would think you put to root the kana easy-to-understand 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:23.080
 Nde become me Petter 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:26.840
 Later 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:30.400
 If you have attached to the main center 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.370
 This after dividing all with a focus in 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.740
 Draft 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:37.720
 It's kind of like blogging 

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:40.730
 At the stage of putting on already 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:43.240
 You can see that it is moist 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:43.240
 In a 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:50.050
 If I put it properly until the end of high 2 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.050
 I'm having a hard time 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.000
 Oh dear 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:56.140
 this 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.069
 a 120 ml 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:02.540
 Well there is 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:04.319
 Comparing the other of the Koch front real 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:06.800
 Here 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:08.240
 Hey how do you such much 

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:12.500
 100 ml 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:16.450
 And here too it's about 1500 yen too 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:21.640
 There is so much is not high Gorori the price basis 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:25.750
 Nde wrong ah Oh Loretta Desu over the wax is still higher than that of other 

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:31.560
 Loretta luxe is about 2000 yen or so I think other 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:36.470
 Also high for the I pretty I was there or a good wax because I've covered so far 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:42.660
 It is amazing to say 1600 yen Toka such do is I have Tsu wax that are out of Loretta 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:45.289
 I thought there was a high image and the base oil was high, but the price was 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:47.880
 It's not so high normal 

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:54.289
 I mean the base oil that 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:56.040
 It does not change the treatment which doesn't wash away with other manufacturers 

00:04:54.289 --> 00:05:01.260
 Because 

00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:05.850
 This time I think Dekirukana recommended Well the Tteyuu Loretta at such a point 

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:08.860
 The price is a bit high at max, so I can not recommend it in that way 

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:10.040
 I is Tan said that I mean come true 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:15.660
 truly 

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:21.120
 This is the best I have ever used, but it was the best 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:25.640
 I also think that some people are using it quite a bit, so let's borrow a bit to that friend. 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:25.640
 I think it may be good to try 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:33.190
 Well, this time this time 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:36.030
 From that treatment Loretta-based care oil hair treatment is not washed away 

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:36.030
