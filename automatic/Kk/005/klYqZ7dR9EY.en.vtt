up<00:03:12.689> stills<00:03:13.200> from<00:03:13.470> the<00:03:13.530> expo<00:03:14.040> and<00:03:14.400> it's

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
up stills from the expo and it's

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.380 
up stills from the expo and it's
becoming<00:03:15.540> very<00:03:15.659> hard<00:03:16.109> because<00:03:17.090> he's<00:03:18.090> not

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
becoming very hard because he's not

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:21.890 
becoming very hard because he's not
eating<00:03:18.780> on<00:03:18.900> his<00:03:19.079> own<00:03:19.200> so<00:03:19.500> every<00:03:19.920> day<00:03:20.069> to<00:03:20.900> feed

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
eating on his own so every day to feed

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:27.259 
eating on his own so every day to feed
him<00:03:24.139> and<00:03:25.139> he's<00:03:25.530> not<00:03:25.859> getting<00:03:26.340> as<00:03:26.609> much<00:03:26.639> food<00:03:27.060> as

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
him and he's not getting as much food as

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:31.990 
him and he's not getting as much food as
he<00:03:27.420> would<00:03:27.599> be<00:03:27.780> if<00:03:27.900> she<00:03:28.019> was<00:03:28.139> eating<00:03:28.290> on<00:03:28.470> his<00:03:28.590> own

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.270 

but<00:03:33.000> I'm<00:03:33.629> definitely<00:03:33.870> not<00:03:34.109> gonna<00:03:34.200> give<00:03:34.439> up

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.280 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.020 

hopefully<00:03:38.280> fatten<00:03:38.670> him<00:03:38.790> up

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:45.040 

he's<00:03:41.630> calmed<00:03:42.290> down<00:03:42.530> quite<00:03:42.860> a<00:03:42.980> bit<00:03:43.480> also<00:03:44.480> hasn't

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:45.050 
he's calmed down quite a bit also hasn't

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:51.520 
he's calmed down quite a bit also hasn't
been<00:03:45.350> biting<00:03:45.680> as<00:03:45.800> much<00:03:47.650> so<00:03:49.990> I'm<00:03:50.990> just<00:03:51.260> worried

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:51.530 
been biting as much so I'm just worried

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:53.680 
been biting as much so I'm just worried
about<00:03:51.709> how<00:03:51.890> skinny<00:03:52.250> is<00:03:52.400> getting<00:03:52.790> or<00:03:53.330> has

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.690 
about how skinny is getting or has

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:58.020 
about how skinny is getting or has
gotten<00:03:54.850> he's<00:03:55.850> not<00:03:56.090> getting<00:03:56.540> any<00:03:56.600> skinnier<00:03:57.170> but

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030 
gotten he's not getting any skinnier but

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:01.660 
gotten he's not getting any skinnier but
he's<00:03:59.050> trying<00:04:00.050> to<00:04:00.290> make<00:04:00.680> him<00:04:00.830> slowly<00:04:01.250> put<00:04:01.580> on

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:01.670 
he's trying to make him slowly put on

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:04.030 
he's trying to make him slowly put on
some<00:04:01.910> weight<00:04:02.140> he's<00:04:03.140> as<00:04:03.380> you<00:04:03.410> can<00:04:03.680> see<00:04:03.890> he's

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:04.040 
some weight he's as you can see he's

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:05.920 
some weight he's as you can see he's
definitely<00:04:04.430> not<00:04:04.459> like<00:04:05.000> one<00:04:05.330> of<00:04:05.360> the<00:04:05.510> fattest

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:35.320 
of his tank there is some basically

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:39.040 
of his tank there is some basically
that's<00:04:36.320> his<00:04:36.530> tank<00:04:37.300> that's<00:04:38.300> his<00:04:38.510> basking<00:04:39.020> spot

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.050 
that's his tank that's his basking spot

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:41.580 
that's his tank that's his basking spot
the<00:04:39.500> lamp<00:04:39.710> is<00:04:39.830> usually<00:04:40.160> pointing<00:04:40.520> down<00:04:40.700> and

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:41.590 
the lamp is usually pointing down and

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:45.190 
the lamp is usually pointing down and
his<00:04:42.590> basking<00:04:43.040> spot<00:04:43.070> gets<00:04:43.550> to<00:04:43.700> 82<00:04:44.240> or<00:04:44.600> 84

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:45.200 
his basking spot gets to 82 or 84

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:48.010 
his basking spot gets to 82 or 84
degrees<00:04:45.550> the<00:04:46.550> rest<00:04:46.760> of<00:04:46.880> the<00:04:46.940> tank<00:04:47.210> is<00:04:47.419> is

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:48.020 
degrees the rest of the tank is is

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:52.000 
degrees the rest of the tank is is
cooler<00:04:49.150> between<00:04:50.150> that<00:04:50.540> and<00:04:50.750> 75<00:04:51.290> degrees<00:04:51.680> and

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:52.010 
cooler between that and 75 degrees and

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:53.070 
cooler between that and 75 degrees and
it<00:04:52.100> gets<00:04:52.190> a<00:04:52.310> little<00:04:52.490> bit<00:04:52.669> colder<00:04:52.940> at<00:04:53.030> night

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.080 
it gets a little bit colder at night

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.350 
it gets a little bit colder at night
because<00:04:54.080> the<00:04:54.320> basking<00:04:54.710> light<00:04:54.740> goes<00:04:55.040> off<00:04:55.360> but

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:56.360 
because the basking light goes off but

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.090 
because the basking light goes off but
this<00:04:56.510> room<00:04:56.840> is<00:04:56.960> right<00:04:57.440> next<00:04:57.500> to<00:04:57.770> the<00:04:57.919> boiler

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:58.100 
this room is right next to the boiler

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:02.230 
this room is right next to the boiler
room<00:04:58.280> so<00:04:58.580> it<00:04:58.669> doesn't<00:04:58.940> get<00:04:59.000> too<00:04:59.060> cold<00:05:00.669> and<00:05:01.669> also

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:02.240 
room so it doesn't get too cold and also

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:03.670 
room so it doesn't get too cold and also
this<00:05:02.450> is<00:05:02.600> the<00:05:02.630> basement<00:05:03.140> with<00:05:03.260> a<00:05:03.289> bunch<00:05:03.560> of

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:03.680 
this is the basement with a bunch of

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:06.520 
this is the basement with a bunch of
fish<00:05:03.860> tanks<00:05:04.160> around<00:05:04.370> so<00:05:05.289> definitely<00:05:06.289> stays

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:06.530 
fish tanks around so definitely stays

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:10.540 
fish tanks around so definitely stays
warm<00:05:08.440> probably<00:05:09.440> drops<00:05:09.650> about<00:05:09.950> 510<00:05:10.400> degrees

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:10.550 
warm probably drops about 510 degrees

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:14.469 
warm probably drops about 510 degrees
that's<00:05:11.270> about<00:05:11.510> it<00:05:13.000> and<00:05:14.000> possibly<00:05:14.180> have<00:05:14.450> the

00:05:14.469 --> 00:05:14.479 
that's about it and possibly have the

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:16.420 
that's about it and possibly have the
heating<00:05:14.930> system<00:05:15.080> on<00:05:15.410> and<00:05:15.770> if<00:05:15.979> it<00:05:16.070> gets<00:05:16.190> too

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:16.430 
heating system on and if it gets too

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:21.909 
heating system on and if it gets too
cold<00:05:17.200> but<00:05:18.200> that's<00:05:18.740> his<00:05:18.919> tank<00:05:19.360> about<00:05:20.360> 85<00:05:20.990> I<00:05:21.380> mean

00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:21.919 
cold but that's his tank about 85 I mean

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:24.300 
cold but that's his tank about 85 I mean
80<00:05:22.100> to<00:05:22.550> 84<00:05:23.060> degrees<00:05:23.240> in<00:05:23.479> the<00:05:23.539> basking<00:05:23.870> spot

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:24.310 
80 to 84 degrees in the basking spot

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:28.240 
80 to 84 degrees in the basking spot
between<00:05:25.310> 70<00:05:26.000> and<00:05:26.030> 75<00:05:26.479> degrees<00:05:27.020> average<00:05:27.590> and
