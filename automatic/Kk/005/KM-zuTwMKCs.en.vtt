the dark me where the more field work
you<00:03:03.730> did<00:03:04.000> that<00:03:04.510> back-breaking<00:03:05.139> labor<00:03:05.799> so<00:03:06.730> it

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
you did that back-breaking labor so it

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.150 
you did that back-breaking labor so it
kind<00:03:07.120> of<00:03:07.239> like<00:03:07.569> instilled<00:03:08.380> idea<00:03:08.739> that<00:03:08.950> lighter

00:03:12.539 --> 00:03:12.549 
was I guess better back then that whole

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:16.920 
was I guess better back then that whole
ideal<00:03:13.000> kind<00:03:13.480> of<00:03:13.720> stuck<00:03:14.290> with<00:03:14.950> us<00:03:15.160> but<00:03:16.090> Society

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
ideal kind of stuck with us but Society

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.099 
ideal kind of stuck with us but Society
has<00:03:16.959> changed<00:03:17.109> so<00:03:17.889> that<00:03:18.359> whole<00:03:19.359> ideal

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:20.109 
has changed so that whole ideal

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:21.900 
has changed so that whole ideal
shouldn't<00:03:20.650> doesn't<00:03:21.370> even<00:03:21.489> isn't<00:03:21.730> even

light-skinned all sorts of things Tim
from<00:05:06.120> preferences<00:05:07.120> and<00:05:07.300> I<00:05:07.390> think<00:05:07.600> a<00:05:07.690> lot<00:05:07.720> of

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:07.840 
from preferences and I think a lot of

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:11.190 
from preferences and I think a lot of
times<00:05:09.150> you're<00:05:10.150> confused<00:05:10.960> with

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:11.200 
times you're confused with

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:13.290 
times you're confused with
discrimination<00:05:11.860> because<00:05:12.430> sometimes<00:05:13.030> it<00:05:13.180> is

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:13.300 
discrimination because sometimes it is

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.420 
discrimination because sometimes it is
just<00:05:13.330> for<00:05:13.660> lunch<00:05:13.840> so<00:05:14.680> what<00:05:14.860> is<00:05:14.980> the<00:05:15.100> difference

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:15.430 
just for lunch so what is the difference

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:17.400 
just for lunch so what is the difference
between<00:05:15.460> preference<00:05:16.360> and<00:05:16.570> discrimination<00:05:16.990> I

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:17.410 
between preference and discrimination I

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:19.260 
between preference and discrimination I
think<00:05:18.040> the<00:05:18.130> difference<00:05:18.340> between<00:05:18.580> preference

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:19.270 
think the difference between preference

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:21.390 
think the difference between preference
and<00:05:19.390> discrimination<00:05:19.930> is<00:05:20.260> when<00:05:20.500> you<00:05:20.710> exclude<00:05:21.100> a

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:21.400 
and discrimination is when you exclude a

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:23.760 
and discrimination is when you exclude a
certain<00:05:21.700> group<00:05:21.790> of<00:05:21.940> people<00:05:22.000> so<00:05:22.510> if<00:05:22.990> you<00:05:23.200> say<00:05:23.470> I

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:23.770 
certain group of people so if you say I

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:26.400 
certain group of people so if you say I
only<00:05:24.460> date<00:05:25.000> light<00:05:25.270> skinned<00:05:25.600> guys<00:05:25.810> and<00:05:26.230> I<00:05:26.350> will

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:26.410 
only date light skinned guys and I will

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:28.800 
only date light skinned guys and I will
