00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:13.120 
them in I'm just gonna roll them on the
other<00:04:11.630> side<00:04:11.930> to<00:04:12.110> make<00:04:12.230> sure<00:04:12.440> that<00:04:12.680> the<00:04:12.860> brown

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:13.130 
other side to make sure that the brown

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:15.940 
other side to make sure that the brown
evenly<00:04:13.780> when<00:04:14.780> you<00:04:14.900> bake<00:04:15.110> it<00:04:15.140> I<00:04:15.320> suggest<00:04:15.860> that

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:15.950 
evenly when you bake it I suggest that

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:17.530 
evenly when you bake it I suggest that
you<00:04:16.070> just<00:04:16.310> flatten<00:04:16.730> it<00:04:16.820> a<00:04:16.910> little<00:04:17.090> bit<00:04:17.299> so<00:04:17.450> it

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:17.540 
you just flatten it a little bit so it

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:22.680 
you just flatten it a little bit so it
cooks<00:04:17.750> more<00:04:18.110> evenly<00:04:21.010> this<00:04:22.010> is<00:04:22.160> when<00:04:22.340> you<00:04:22.490> know

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:22.690 
cooks more evenly this is when you know

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:26.020 
cooks more evenly this is when you know
that<00:04:23.690> they're<00:04:23.870> ready<00:04:24.280> what<00:04:25.280> I<00:04:25.310> do<00:04:25.400> is<00:04:25.640> I<00:04:25.670> turn
