 I'll tell you packs tactics use better 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:49.039
 it is my opinion that so therefore 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:52.239
 so car tactic I walk myself vx you 

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:55.460
 can not copy care 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:57.559

 intrigue the viewer well let's all 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:04.760
 let's get it right 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:07.790
 just wore a gun more than once 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:12.220
 count because we come up with that 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:16.060
 you ca n't shoot a bit later let's 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:18.960
 in short let me buy deagle 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.990
 return anonymous big 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:29.090
 because we look if I press 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:33.420
 immediately look patrons flew 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:35.790
 unevenly they went jabbing ebanuty 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.710
 in seven years of playing counter-strike, I am so 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.869
 and did not learn to shoot normally but 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:43.610
 thanks to the advice of our student all 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:47.899
 it turned out you shoot a big 2 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:47.899
 + Into the brains of all Dalby 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:57.479
 shoot as they jump but because 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:02:00.750
 the character in the game will walk because 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:05.220
 on the whole will not stand here he could not 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:08.970
 of course and even shoot like that 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:11.580
 It turns out well in the meantime that he does not kill 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:14.810
 visible goal, I smoothly transferred to 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.810
 first shootout 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:27.030
 okay i see you are a little bored 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.600
 so a couple of effects and music not 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.600
 will hurt 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:47.200
 I'll show you the tactics that 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.920
 they work practically professionals 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:52.700
 take the pan 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:56.260
 throw and cars we take a smoke grenade 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.260
 we throw and you may be glad 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:04.480
 logan's house explodes and we start 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:07.060
 shoot after the fact I mean as if the price 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:10.180
 and the fact that you are not visible in the first you 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:15.159
 fume smoke grenades and 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:16.870
 find out hi big run you play a lot 

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:23.980
 computer games and what do you think 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:25.780
 Whether this is a good tactic because data rollers 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.299
 imbued with the author's melancholy dullness 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.400
 the concentration of the word jug is so great 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:36.819
 what does he tell her every two 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:39.459
 minutes to prescribe you just prescribe 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:41.049
 urban need it can not be prescribed 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:46.019
 work ditty 

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:52.060
 because cheater Ilyich that but we like 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:56.760
 play well we ran our opponent 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:59.620
 got a jug and we have no one we threw 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:03.010
 Now we are following the same pattern 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:07.150
 act like this get up we drain from the smoke 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:12.280
 and prescribe jug and good jug what 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:14.290
 we drain smoke from all the cards 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.150
 may just act it very 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:21.599
 good tactic 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:21.599
