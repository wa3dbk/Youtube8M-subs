00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.010 

I<00:00:04.940> think<00:00:05.940> for<00:00:06.150> me<00:00:06.240> it's<00:00:06.420> about<00:00:06.569> getting<00:00:06.720> people

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
I think for me it's about getting people

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:08.720 
I think for me it's about getting people
involved<00:00:07.529> in<00:00:07.830> swimming<00:00:07.980> it's<00:00:08.340> about<00:00:08.550> getting

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
involved in swimming it's about getting

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.970 
involved in swimming it's about getting
families<00:00:09.150> involved<00:00:09.389> as<00:00:09.900> well<00:00:10.050> so<00:00:10.380> you<00:00:10.830> can

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
families involved as well so you can

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.440 
families involved as well so you can
come<00:00:11.160> to<00:00:11.280> some<00:00:11.429> Britain<00:00:11.730> and<00:00:11.849> you<00:00:11.940> can<00:00:12.120> do<00:00:12.330> it

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
come to some Britain and you can do it

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:13.940 
come to some Britain and you can do it
because<00:00:12.660> it's<00:00:12.780> a<00:00:12.900> relay<00:00:13.170> challenge<00:00:13.410> with<00:00:13.740> four

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
because it's a relay challenge with four

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.039 
because it's a relay challenge with four
people<00:00:14.130> so<00:00:14.580> it's<00:00:15.030> really<00:00:15.299> exciting<00:00:15.599> that<00:00:15.960> you

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
people so it's really exciting that you

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:17.510 
people so it's really exciting that you
can<00:00:16.170> come<00:00:16.350> down<00:00:16.379> and<00:00:16.710> last<00:00:16.920> year<00:00:17.130> I<00:00:17.160> did<00:00:17.400> the

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
can come down and last year I did the

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.070 
can come down and last year I did the
relay<00:00:17.760> with<00:00:17.880> my<00:00:18.029> family<00:00:18.420> so<00:00:18.570> it's<00:00:18.720> really<00:00:18.869> nice

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
relay with my family so it's really nice

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.840 
relay with my family so it's really nice
that<00:00:19.140> we<00:00:19.380> could<00:00:19.529> all<00:00:19.619> swim<00:00:19.830> together<00:00:20.160> and<00:00:20.400> do

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
that we could all swim together and do

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.900 
that we could all swim together and do
something<00:00:21.180> as<00:00:21.300> a<00:00:21.330> family<00:00:21.689> together

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:25.910 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:31.690 

I<00:00:27.250> do<00:00:28.250> about<00:00:29.020> 99.9%<00:00:30.070> provide<00:00:31.070> training<00:00:31.520> in<00:00:31.580> the

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:31.700 
I do about 99.9% provide training in the

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:33.490 
I do about 99.9% provide training in the
pool<00:00:31.850> and<00:00:32.540> a<00:00:32.599> very<00:00:32.780> small<00:00:32.989> percent<00:00:33.320> of<00:00:33.380> my

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:33.500 
pool and a very small percent of my

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.530 
pool and a very small percent of my
training<00:00:33.829> over<00:00:33.950> water<00:00:34.250> because<00:00:35.059> I<00:00:35.090> have<00:00:35.300> to<00:00:35.420> do

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:35.540 
training over water because I have to do

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.479 
training over water because I have to do
so<00:00:35.780> much<00:00:35.930> in<00:00:36.110> the<00:00:36.170> pool<00:00:36.350> it's<00:00:36.830> really<00:00:37.129> hard<00:00:37.309> to

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:37.489 
so much in the pool it's really hard to

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:39.820 
so much in the pool it's really hard to
regulate<00:00:37.760> trying<00:00:38.180> to<00:00:38.270> do<00:00:38.559> 7,000<00:00:39.559> meters<00:00:39.800> a

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:39.830 
regulate trying to do 7,000 meters a

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:42.040 
regulate trying to do 7,000 meters a
week<00:00:40.040> in<00:00:40.250> the<00:00:40.550> open<00:00:40.820> water<00:00:41.000> or<00:00:41.300> in<00:00:41.480> a<00:00:41.570> lake<00:00:41.720> so

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:42.050 
week in the open water or in a lake so

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:43.810 
week in the open water or in a lake so
everything<00:00:42.769> I<00:00:42.860> pretty<00:00:43.100> much<00:00:43.190> do<00:00:43.519> is<00:00:43.610> in<00:00:43.760> the

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:43.820 
everything I pretty much do is in the

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:45.729 
everything I pretty much do is in the
pool<00:00:44.000> and<00:00:44.239> my<00:00:44.510> training<00:00:45.230> for<00:00:45.440> open<00:00:45.710> water

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:45.739 
pool and my training for open water

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:47.860 
pool and my training for open water
would<00:00:46.129> be<00:00:46.250> races<00:00:46.640> that<00:00:46.790> I<00:00:46.820> do<00:00:46.910> in<00:00:47.390> and<00:00:47.750> around

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:47.870 
would be races that I do in and around

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:53.939 
would be races that I do in and around
the<00:00:48.019> country<00:00:48.350> and<00:00:48.440> around<00:00:48.500> the<00:00:48.710> world

00:00:53.939 --> 00:00:53.949 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:57.009 

during<00:00:54.949> sewing<00:00:55.370> sessions<00:00:55.870> generally<00:00:56.870> there's

00:00:57.009 --> 00:00:57.019 
during sewing sessions generally there's

00:00:57.019 --> 00:00:58.360 
during sewing sessions generally there's
something<00:00:57.289> to<00:00:57.379> think<00:00:57.469> about<00:00:57.559> so<00:00:57.859> my<00:00:57.949> coach<00:00:58.160> has

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:58.370 
something to think about so my coach has

00:00:58.370 --> 00:00:59.860 
something to think about so my coach has
given<00:00:58.579> me<00:00:58.640> a<00:00:58.670> focus<00:00:58.910> of<00:00:59.089> a<00:00:59.239> session<00:00:59.600> it's<00:00:59.780> a

00:00:59.860 --> 00:00:59.870 
given me a focus of a session it's a

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:01.630 
given me a focus of a session it's a
hard<00:01:00.050> session<00:01:00.379> and<00:01:00.500> easy<00:01:00.620> session<00:01:01.070> something

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:01.640 
hard session and easy session something

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.130 
hard session and easy session something
on<00:01:01.879> those<00:01:02.000> lines<00:01:02.120> but<00:01:02.479> my<00:01:02.600> mind<00:01:02.839> always

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:03.140 
on those lines but my mind always

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.109 
on those lines but my mind always
wonders<00:01:03.710> and<00:01:03.890> it's<00:01:04.040> from<00:01:04.309> what<00:01:04.879> I'm<00:01:04.939> going<00:01:05.089> to

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 
singing one line up to the whole of my

00:01:29.139 --> 00:01:29.149 
pancake we do a fair amount of core I

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:31.330 
pancake we do a fair amount of core I
don't<00:01:29.479> do<00:01:29.659> too<00:01:29.840> much<00:01:30.050> weight<00:01:30.979> training

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 
don't do too much weight training

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.160 
don't do too much weight training
because<00:01:31.729> to<00:01:32.119> be<00:01:32.240> in<00:01:32.360> open<00:01:32.630> water<00:01:32.810> swimming<00:01:33.050> you

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
because to be in open water swimming you

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.649 
because to be in open water swimming you
need<00:01:33.289> to<00:01:33.380> be<00:01:33.500> lean<00:01:33.740> and<00:01:34.610> kind<00:01:35.090> of<00:01:35.179> slim<00:01:35.420> rather

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:35.659 
need to be lean and kind of slim rather

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:37.389 
need to be lean and kind of slim rather
than<00:01:35.929> and<00:01:36.229> really<00:01:36.530> beefy<00:01:36.860> because<00:01:37.130> if<00:01:37.280> you're

00:01:37.389 --> 00:01:37.399 
than and really beefy because if you're

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:39.249 
than and really beefy because if you're
going<00:01:37.549> to<00:01:37.640> be<00:01:37.729> too<00:01:37.940> big<00:01:38.600> then<00:01:38.840> it's<00:01:38.990> gonna<00:01:39.110> be

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:39.259 
going to be too big then it's gonna be

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:40.450 
going to be too big then it's gonna be
hard<00:01:39.470> for<00:01:39.530> you<00:01:39.710> to<00:01:39.799> kind<00:01:39.920> of<00:01:40.009> swim<00:01:40.220> through<00:01:40.399> the

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
hard for you to kind of swim through the

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.100 
hard for you to kind of swim through the
water<00:01:40.490> when<00:01:40.940> you<00:01:40.970> really<00:01:41.270> need<00:01:41.450> it<00:01:41.600> so<00:01:41.720> for<00:01:42.020> me

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.110 
water when you really need it so for me

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:43.480

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.680 

our<00:02:08.649> technique<00:02:09.129> work<00:02:09.340> is<00:02:09.580> always<00:02:10.090> on<00:02:10.599> the

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
our technique work is always on the

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.150 
our technique work is always on the
front<00:02:10.869> of<00:02:10.989> my<00:02:11.019> mind<00:02:11.349> when<00:02:11.500> I'm<00:02:11.620> training<00:02:12.040> it

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
front of my mind when I'm training it

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.589 
front of my mind when I'm training it
has<00:02:12.310> to<00:02:12.550> be<00:02:12.670> there<00:02:12.849> you<00:02:13.000> have<00:02:13.150> to<00:02:13.300> make<00:02:13.450> sure

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:13.599 
has to be there you have to make sure

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:15.300 
has to be there you have to make sure
that<00:02:13.660> you're<00:02:13.930> doing<00:02:14.080> the<00:02:14.410> right<00:02:14.650> technique

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
that you're doing the right technique

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:16.830 
that you're doing the right technique
especially<00:02:15.489> when<00:02:16.269> you're<00:02:16.390> doing<00:02:16.510> hard

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
especially when you're doing hard

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.270 
especially when you're doing hard
sessions<00:02:17.230> and<00:02:17.410> paced<00:02:17.590> sessions<00:02:17.920> that's<00:02:18.099> well

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
sessions and paced sessions that's well

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:19.740 
sessions and paced sessions that's well
it's<00:02:18.400> probably<00:02:18.549> the<00:02:18.849> most<00:02:19.030> important<00:02:19.629> because

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
it's probably the most important because

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.119 
it's probably the most important because
you're<00:02:20.349> paying<00:02:20.470> yourself<00:02:20.860> and<00:02:21.040> you're

00:02:21.119 --> 00:02:21.129 
you're paying yourself and you're

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:23.009 
you're paying yourself and you're
putting<00:02:21.250> your<00:02:21.370> body<00:02:21.549> under<00:02:21.819> real<00:02:22.120> pressure<00:02:22.150> so

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:23.019 
putting your body under real pressure so

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:24.420 
putting your body under real pressure so
if<00:02:23.110> you<00:02:23.170> can<00:02:23.319> have<00:02:23.440> great<00:02:23.650> technique<00:02:24.010> during

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
if you can have great technique during

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.160 
if you can have great technique during
training<00:02:24.849> when<00:02:24.970> you're<00:02:25.060> under<00:02:25.269> pressure<00:02:25.510> then

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
training when you're under pressure then

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:27.270 
training when you're under pressure then
when<00:02:26.379> you're<00:02:26.500> something<00:02:26.739> easy<00:02:26.980> it<00:02:27.250> should

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
when you're something easy it should

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.460 
when you're something easy it should
just<00:02:27.610> flow<00:02:28.030> and<00:02:28.209> it<00:02:28.269> should<00:02:28.420> just<00:02:28.450> be<00:02:28.629> what<00:02:29.319> it

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
just flow and it should just be what it

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:41.590 
just flow and it should just be what it
needs<00:02:29.680> to<00:02:29.739> be

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:41.600 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.660
