what<00:03:50.430> worries<00:03:50.760> me<00:03:50.790> is<00:03:51.209> that<00:03:51.299> I<00:03:52.230> believe<00:03:52.890> I

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
what worries me is that I believe I

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:55.520 
what worries me is that I believe I
don't<00:03:53.310> know<00:03:53.400> if<00:03:53.489> it's<00:03:53.670> a<00:03:53.880> myth<00:03:54.330> but<00:03:54.630> DDT<00:03:55.290> is

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
don't know if it's a myth but DDT is

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.860

still<00:03:55.860> legal<00:03:56.190> in<00:03:56.430> Thailand<00:03:57.000> so<00:03:57.390> that<00:03:57.570> leads<00:03:57.750> me

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
still legal in Thailand so that leads me

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:00.710 
still legal in Thailand so that leads me
to<00:03:58.049> believe<00:03:58.080> that<00:03:58.380> if<00:03:58.950> this<00:03:59.100> is<00:03:59.250> not<00:03:59.400> ddd<00:04:00.090> then

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
to believe that if this is not ddd then

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.360 
to believe that if this is not ddd then
it<00:04:00.840> could<00:04:01.019> very<00:04:01.230> well<00:04:01.320> do<00:04:01.620> something<00:04:02.070> harmful

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370
