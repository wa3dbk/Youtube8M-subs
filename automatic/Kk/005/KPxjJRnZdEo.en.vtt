to them as like morphs like ball pythons

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.210 
to them as like morphs like ball pythons
you<00:02:14.660> have<00:02:14.780> spiders<00:02:15.290> you<00:02:15.440> have<00:02:15.560> pins<00:02:15.800> you<00:02:16.100> have

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
you have spiders you have pins you have

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.040 
you have spiders you have pins you have
you<00:02:17.030> have<00:02:17.150> a<00:02:17.180> bunch<00:02:17.360> there<00:02:17.480> but<00:02:17.600> more<00:02:17.780> these

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
you have a bunch there but more these

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:19.510 
you have a bunch there but more these
these<00:02:18.260> guys<00:02:18.440> are<00:02:18.620> not<00:02:18.740> more<00:02:19.040> so<00:02:19.220> different

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520 
these guys are not more so different

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:25.090 
these guys are not more so different
species<00:02:19.960> so<00:02:21.400> just<00:02:22.400> to<00:02:22.490> get<00:02:22.610> that<00:02:22.730> straight<00:02:24.100> so

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.100 
species so just to get that straight so

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.580 
species so just to get that straight so
there<00:02:26.030> are<00:02:26.060> there's<00:02:26.840> nine<00:02:27.050> different<00:02:27.440> types

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
there are there's nine different types

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.330 
there are there's nine different types
of<00:02:27.800> species<00:02:29.320> and<00:02:30.320> they're<00:02:30.560> all<00:02:30.740> they're<00:02:31.130> named

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
of species and they're all they're named

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.470 
of species and they're all they're named
after<00:02:31.550> these<00:02:32.000> guys<00:02:32.180> the<00:02:32.480> process<00:02:34.360> they<00:02:35.360> all

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
after these guys the process they all

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.449 
after these guys the process they all
are<00:02:35.600> the<00:02:35.750> exact<00:02:35.990> same<00:02:36.020> build<00:02:36.530> from<00:02:37.190> what<00:02:37.310> I<00:02:37.340> can

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 
are the exact same build from what I can

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:40.630 
are the exact same build from what I can
tell<00:02:37.580> and<00:02:38.080> just<00:02:39.080> different<00:02:39.200> skin<00:02:39.920> types<00:02:40.130> skin

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
tell and just different skin types skin

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.120 
tell and just different skin types skin
patterns<00:02:41.360> but<00:02:41.810> again<00:02:42.050> not<00:02:42.290> a<00:02:42.350> month<00:02:42.620> there<00:02:43.040> are

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
patterns but again not a month there are

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:49.630 
patterns but again not a month there are
different<00:02:43.400> species<00:02:43.550> so<00:02:47.530> there<00:02:48.530> are<00:02:48.650> so<00:02:49.280> I<00:02:49.310> mean

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
different species so there are so I mean

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.040 
different species so there are so I mean
that<00:02:49.730> was<00:02:49.820> basically<00:02:50.120> my<00:02:50.300> whole<00:02:50.330> point<00:02:50.750> to<00:02:50.930> get

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.050 
that was basically my whole point to get

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:52.300 
that was basically my whole point to get
across<00:02:51.080> there<00:02:51.470> cuz<00:02:51.680> there's<00:02:51.860> the<00:02:51.980> questions

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
across there cuz there's the questions

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.390 
across there cuz there's the questions
and<00:02:52.640> again<00:02:53.510> I've<00:02:53.810> had<00:02:53.930> a<00:02:53.959> lot<00:02:54.140> of<00:02:54.280> requests<00:02:55.280> for

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
and again I've had a lot of requests for

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:56.830 
and again I've had a lot of requests for
like<00:02:55.550> a<00:02:55.730> care<00:02:55.910> sheet<00:02:56.090> for<00:02:56.300> a<00:02:56.330> black<00:02:56.540> fin

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
like a care sheet for a black fin

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.530 
like a care sheet for a black fin
monitor<00:02:57.230> or<00:02:57.440> blue<00:02:57.920> stream<00:02:58.190> if<00:02:58.670> you<00:02:59.180> watch<00:02:59.360> my

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
Karen video over the screen trace it

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:02.980 
Karen video over the screen trace it
covers<00:03:01.760> anything<00:03:02.270> that<00:03:02.390> I<00:03:02.450> just<00:03:02.480> listed<00:03:02.720> the

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:02.990 
covers anything that I just listed the

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:04.420 
covers anything that I just listed the
nine<00:03:03.140> species<00:03:03.590> and<00:03:03.770> the<00:03:03.830> process<00:03:04.160> complex

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
nine species and the process complex

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:06.880 
nine species and the process complex
exact<00:03:05.360> same<00:03:05.570> care<00:03:05.810> no<00:03:06.110> nothing<00:03:06.590> different<00:03:06.739> at

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890 
exact same care no nothing different at

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.920 
exact same care no nothing different at
all<00:03:07.070> it's<00:03:07.730> like<00:03:07.910> I've<00:03:08.390> seen<00:03:09.140> this<00:03:09.380> one<00:03:09.560> to<00:03:09.680> do<00:03:09.830> a

exemplar<00:03:38.870> now<00:03:38.989> by<00:03:39.140> no<00:03:39.200> Varna<00:03:39.709> is<00:03:39.860> a<00:03:40.280> morph<00:03:40.580> it

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:40.820 
exemplar now by no Varna is a morph it

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:42.370 
exemplar now by no Varna is a morph it
is<00:03:41.000> not<00:03:41.180> a<00:03:41.209> different<00:03:41.570> species<00:03:41.930> that<00:03:42.170> you<00:03:42.260> go

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:42.380 
is not a different species that you go

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:45.280 
is not a different species that you go

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.290 
on it is a morph genetics and that

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:46.990 
on it is a morph genetics and that
aren't<00:03:45.590> changed<00:03:45.920> from<00:03:46.100> the<00:03:46.280> original<00:03:46.850> green

aren't changed from the original green
tree<00:03:47.209> it<00:03:47.420> is<00:03:47.450> a<00:03:47.680> different<00:03:49.450> same<00:03:51.459> see<00:03:52.459> this<00:03:52.910> is

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 
tree it is a different same see this is

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.640 
tree it is a different same see this is
where<00:03:53.150> it<00:03:53.209> gets<00:03:53.360> complicated<00:03:53.540> it<00:03:54.110> is<00:03:54.230> the<00:03:54.440> same

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:54.650 
where it gets complicated it is the same

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:57.430 
where it gets complicated it is the same
lizard<00:03:55.580> in<00:03:55.730> turn<00:03:55.940> but<00:03:56.239> different<00:03:56.720> it<00:03:57.170> is<00:03:57.350> a

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:57.440 
lizard in turn but different it is a

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:58.860 
lizard in turn but different it is a
more<00:03:57.650> it's<00:03:57.860> not<00:03:57.920> a<00:03:58.040> different<00:03:58.430> species

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
more it's not a different species

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:01.449 
more it's not a different species
whereas<00:03:59.870> these<00:04:00.110> guys<00:04:00.260> all<00:04:00.680> they're<00:04:01.100> all<00:04:01.130> nine

morphs and from my understanding we have

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:09.250 
morphs and from my understanding we have
they've<00:04:07.220> never<00:04:07.400> found<00:04:07.610> an<00:04:07.850> albino<00:04:08.150> and
