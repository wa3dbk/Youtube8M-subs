00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
taking pictures and it also has

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.949 
taking pictures and it also has
capability<00:02:43.600> of<00:02:43.630> taking<00:02:43.900> HD<00:02:44.769> video<00:02:45.540> so<00:02:46.540> that<00:02:46.810> is

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
capability of taking HD video so that is

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:50.160 
capability of taking HD video so that is
pretty<00:02:47.290> awesome<00:02:47.530> just<00:02:48.430> like<00:02:48.640> the<00:02:48.819> iphone<00:02:49.000> 4<00:02:49.840> i

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
pretty awesome just like the iphone 4 i

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:55.920 
pretty awesome just like the iphone 4 i
believe<00:02:51.160> it's<00:02:51.340> the<00:02:51.459> same<00:02:52.140> specs<00:02:53.140> or<00:02:53.910> I<00:02:54.910> get<00:02:55.720> it

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
believe it's the same specs or I get it

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:00.289 
believe it's the same specs or I get it
takes<00:02:56.140> the<00:02:56.260> same<00:02:56.440> pictures<00:02:57.190> and<00:02:57.549> video<00:02:58.480> video

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:00.299 
takes the same pictures and video video

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:02.970 
takes the same pictures and video video
so<00:03:01.299> that's<00:03:01.959> pretty<00:03:02.170> much<00:03:02.260> it<00:03:02.349> that's<00:03:02.709> all<00:03:02.950> I

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980
