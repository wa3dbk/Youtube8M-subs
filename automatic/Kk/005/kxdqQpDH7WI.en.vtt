to<00:00:58.790> it<00:00:59.079> so<00:01:00.079> let's<00:01:00.230> talk<00:01:00.290> about<00:01:00.409> what<00:01:00.649> it<00:01:00.739> covers

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:01.220 
to it so let's talk about what it covers

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:03.460 
to it so let's talk about what it covers
it<00:01:01.519> covers<00:01:01.850> manufacturing<00:01:02.570> defects<00:01:03.049> such<00:01:03.409> as

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:03.470 
it covers manufacturing defects such as

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:05.859 
it covers manufacturing defects such as
hard<00:01:03.769> drive<00:01:03.979> failures<00:01:04.519> or<00:01:04.850> your<00:01:05.510> if<00:01:05.689> your

00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:05.869 
hard drive failures or your if your

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:08.200 
hard drive failures or your if your
motherboard<00:01:06.170> fails<00:01:06.590> for<00:01:06.770> example<00:01:07.250> or<00:01:07.460> you

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
motherboard fails for example or you

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:09.850 
motherboard fails for example or you
have<00:01:08.330> a<00:01:08.360> dead<00:01:08.630> pixel<00:01:08.869> on<00:01:09.260> your<00:01:09.380> display<00:01:09.710> or

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860 
have a dead pixel on your display or

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:11.859 
have a dead pixel on your display or
something<00:01:10.100> like<00:01:10.159> that<00:01:10.220> it<00:01:10.520> covers<00:01:10.850> that<00:01:11.030> but

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:11.869 
something like that it covers that but

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:13.480 
something like that it covers that but
what<00:01:12.020> it<00:01:12.110> doesn't<00:01:12.260> cover<00:01:12.439> is<00:01:12.860> accidental

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490 
what it doesn't cover is accidental

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.520 
what it doesn't cover is accidental
damage<00:01:13.640> so<00:01:14.090> for<00:01:14.330> example<00:01:14.689> if<00:01:14.810> you<00:01:14.930> drop<00:01:15.229> it<00:01:15.409> or

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530 
damage so for example if you drop it or

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:16.990 
damage so for example if you drop it or
something<00:01:15.770> like<00:01:15.830> that<00:01:15.890> if<00:01:16.400> you<00:01:16.490> drop<00:01:16.700> it<00:01:16.729> you

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000 
something like that if you drop it you

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.910 
something like that if you drop it you
spill<00:01:17.270> water<00:01:17.509> over<00:01:18.110> and<00:01:18.439> stuff<00:01:18.590> like<00:01:18.710> that

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
spill water over and stuff like that

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.330 
spill water over and stuff like that
doesn't<00:01:19.280> cover<00:01:19.610> that<00:01:20.409> so<00:01:21.409> a<00:01:21.710> lot<00:01:21.950> of<00:01:22.009> people

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
doesn't cover that so a lot of people

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:23.830 
doesn't cover that so a lot of people
when<00:01:22.610> they<00:01:22.640> ask<00:01:22.970> themselves<00:01:23.390> they're<00:01:23.570> like<00:01:23.689> oh

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 
when they ask themselves they're like oh

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.630 
when they ask themselves they're like oh
yeah<00:01:24.140> I<00:01:24.290> take<00:01:24.530> good<00:01:24.740> care<00:01:24.950> of<00:01:25.009> my<00:01:25.220> Mac<00:01:25.400> and

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:25.640 
yeah I take good care of my Mac and

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.219 
yeah I take good care of my Mac and
stuff<00:01:25.759> like<00:01:25.880> that<00:01:26.030> I<00:01:26.150> don't<00:01:26.330> need<00:01:26.509> it<00:01:26.689> well

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:27.229 
stuff like that I don't need it well

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:28.929 
stuff like that I don't need it well
this<00:01:27.409> warranty<00:01:27.890> doesn't<00:01:28.040> cover<00:01:28.189> that<00:01:28.460> I<00:01:28.729> mean

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:28.939 
this warranty doesn't cover that I mean

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:30.399 
this warranty doesn't cover that I mean
when<00:01:29.270> people<00:01:29.540> ask<00:01:29.750> themselves<00:01:30.079> like<00:01:30.229> that

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:30.409 
when people ask themselves like that

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:32.230 
when people ask themselves like that

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
for another three years so that's always

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.070 
for another three years so that's always
a<00:02:59.190> plus

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080 
a plus

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.660 
a plus
