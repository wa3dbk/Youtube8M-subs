 very good cook so it's really 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:39.520
 easy recipes 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.809
 So here we go and we will 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:46.300
 start by going to wash your hands and 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:48.100
 here we go 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.360
 clenched hands and so now we 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.970
 will prepare all the ingredients we have 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:55.290
 need for our banana cake set 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:55.290
 chocolate is gone 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:04.199
 that's it for this recipe so we have 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:07.210
 need 220 grams of sugar agree 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:13.570
 a packet of vanilla sugar and half 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:13.960
 of a bag of yeast 125 g of flour 2 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:15.940
 bananas 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.860
 after we can put more maybe 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.940
 no less but at least two bananas a 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:20.259
 half glass of olive oil 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:21.369
 I do not have olive oil after you 

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:23.530
 can put become normal it's you 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:25.420
 who see and then chocolate chocolate 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.920
 we can park dark chocolate so there 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.369
 today it will be with 2015 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.649
 hazelnut 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:32.440
 So we have all these 

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:34.690
 ingredients and we'll be able to start 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:36.729
 of course I had forgotten the 3rd very 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:38.880
 important here we are all our 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:38.880
 ingredients 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:50.980
 so there we mixed so we have like 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:54.610
 you saw there is sugar the sugar 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:56.080
 vanilla 1/2 sachet of yeast three eggs 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:58.270
 and olive oil and here it is 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:01.290
 once we have mixed it gives that and 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.290
 then we will incorporate the flour 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.869
 flour see a very thick all that so 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:12.670
 now we'll let some rest 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:14.880
 and we were going to deal with bananas and 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.880
 chocolate 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.099
 so here we go 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.620
 we have our pact we had left 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:27.930
 rest a little bit our cut banana 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.760
 in small cubes and our choco our 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.500
 hazelnut chocolate crushed after 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.680
 we can also do with apples so 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.940
 quantity 3 4 apples four packs if 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.010
 it's not too big anyway 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.780
 but that's it admits to innovate if you 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.040
 have ideas of you can put a 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.269
 little what do you want finally when 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.599
 not even put anything either 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:44.599
 but there 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.989
 so we mixed in our paw 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:54.040
 bananas and chocolate so 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:54.040
 now we will mix well 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:02.150
 ours mold and well buttered see 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.770
 everywhere shocked really not too thick 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:05.600
 no more but that's how it is not 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:08.540
 wrong and then suddenly we'll put a 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:10.250
 little flour and it'll say carpeted all 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.920
 the edges and then once the 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.180
 cake will have baked barrister will roll out 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.740
 easily because otherwise it's close to 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:20.510
 bottom is boring here it is a small 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:25.220
 nice trick in the meantime we're going 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:29.959

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:36.590
 minutes heating 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:38.750
 here we go for ten minutes of 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:40.280
 here is our cake and our 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:42.620
 ingredients are all mix so 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.540
 now we will be able to put it our 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:46.660
 preparation in the mold that has been buttered 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.660
 and floured 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:59.799
 here is your cake is in the mold no 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:03.690
 far from it we will expose it to 160 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:06.180
 degrees for 50 minutes 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:08.980
 we have fifty minutes we eat and a half 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:14.850
 55 minutes then preheated a little 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:20.910
