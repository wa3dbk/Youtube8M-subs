we'll<00:00:11.880> use<00:00:12.150> another<00:00:12.269> 64<00:00:13.110> for<00:00:13.620> the<00:00:13.650> sides

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:15.139 
we'll use another 64 for the sides

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:17.540 
we'll use another 64 for the sides
currently<00:00:16.139> we've<00:00:16.289> used<00:00:16.500> 1400<00:00:17.160> feet<00:00:17.279> of<00:00:17.400> duct

currently we've used 1400 feet of duct

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:18.859 
currently we've used 1400 feet of duct
tape<00:00:17.580> but<00:00:17.880> we<00:00:17.940> still<00:00:18.119> got<00:00:18.240> two<00:00:18.300> more<00:00:18.390> to<00:00:18.630> finish

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869

tape but we still got two more to finish
the<00:00:19.050> other<00:00:19.140> two<00:00:19.289> sides<00:00:19.970> you<00:00:20.970> can<00:00:21.029> see<00:00:21.119> here's

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
the other two sides you can see here's

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:22.790 
the other two sides you can see here's
the<00:00:21.630> other<00:00:21.779> milk<00:00:22.199> jugs<00:00:22.350> we're<00:00:22.470> gonna<00:00:22.560> use<00:00:22.680> on

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
the other milk jugs we're gonna use on

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.000 
the other milk jugs we're gonna use on
the<00:00:22.859> sides<00:00:23.130> and<00:00:24.170> then<00:00:25.170> there's<00:00:25.619> some<00:00:25.769> extra

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
the sides and then there's some extra

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.589 
the sides and then there's some extra
milk<00:00:26.130> jugs<00:00:26.340> we<00:00:26.460> might<00:00:26.640> make<00:00:26.849> like<00:00:27.029> a<00:00:27.060> canopy<00:00:27.449> we

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
milk jugs we might make like a canopy we

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.470 
milk jugs we might make like a canopy we
haven't<00:00:27.840> quite<00:00:28.109> decided<00:00:28.320> yet<00:00:29.330> the<00:00:30.330> actual

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
haven't quite decided yet the actual

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.740 
haven't quite decided yet the actual
floor<00:00:31.019> like<00:00:31.230> this<00:00:31.410> is<00:00:31.470> the<00:00:31.619> base<00:00:31.769> and<00:00:32.750> then

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
floor like this is the base and then

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:34.910 
floor like this is the base and then
we're<00:00:33.989> going<00:00:34.079> to<00:00:34.140> put<00:00:34.320> this<00:00:34.440> piece<00:00:34.590> of<00:00:34.649> plywood

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
we're going to put this piece of plywood

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.490 
we're going to put this piece of plywood
it's<00:00:35.370> going<00:00:35.670> to<00:00:35.730> be<00:00:35.790> like<00:00:35.910> the<00:00:36.000> floor<00:00:36.320> and<00:00:37.320> from

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
it's going to be like the floor and from

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.310 
it's going to be like the floor and from
there<00:00:37.710> we're<00:00:37.860> going<00:00:37.950> to<00:00:38.040> use<00:00:39.020> these<00:00:40.020> two<00:00:40.170> back

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
there we're going to use these two back

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.869 
there we're going to use these two back
doors<00:00:40.350> we're<00:00:40.680> screwing<00:00:40.920> down<00:00:41.040> to<00:00:41.399> the<00:00:41.579> plywood

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
doors we're screwing down to the plywood

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.209 
doors we're screwing down to the plywood
and<00:00:42.210> then<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:43.170> sides<00:00:43.379> Archie<00:00:43.649> duct<00:00:43.800> tape<00:00:43.980> to

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
and then the sides Archie duct tape to

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:45.650 
and then the sides Archie duct tape to
the<00:00:44.309> two<00:00:44.430> by<00:00:44.520> fours<00:00:44.760> so<00:00:45.149> that<00:00:45.300> way<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.480> sides

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
the two by fours so that way the sides

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.779 
the two by fours so that way the sides
are<00:00:45.809> actually<00:00:46.050> sturdy<00:00:46.260> on<00:00:46.469> there<00:00:46.680> and<00:00:46.860> then

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
are actually sturdy on there and then

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.060 
are actually sturdy on there and then
we'll<00:00:48.090> actually<00:00:48.360> duct<00:00:48.780> tape<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.110> base<00:00:49.350> to<00:00:49.950> the

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
we'll actually duct tape the base to the

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.040 
we'll actually duct tape the base to the
plywood<00:00:50.420> so<00:00:51.420> we're<00:00:51.570> gonna<00:00:51.660> need<00:00:51.750> more<00:00:51.870> duct

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
plywood so we're gonna need more duct

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.389 
plywood so we're gonna need more duct
tape<00:00:52.079> for<00:00:52.289> that<00:00:52.379> also<00:00:53.809> like<00:00:54.809> it<00:00:55.440> is<00:00:55.620> four<00:00:56.160> feet

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
tape for that also like it is four feet

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:02.660 
tape for that also like it is four feet
wide<00:00:56.430> and<00:00:57.000> a<00:00:57.750> little<00:00:58.079> over<00:00:58.170> a<00:00:58.230> foot<00:00:58.350> long<00:01:01.670> okay

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
wide and a little over a foot long okay

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.399 
wide and a little over a foot long okay
we<00:01:02.789> finished<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.149> milk<00:01:03.329> jug<00:01:03.480> raft<00:01:03.719> and<00:01:03.989> it

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
we finished the milk jug raft and it

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:05.600 
we finished the milk jug raft and it
flowed<00:01:04.650> up<00:01:04.769> and<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:04.920> back<00:01:05.040> of<00:01:05.129> my<00:01:05.189> truck

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
flowed up and the back of my truck

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.700 
flowed up and the back of my truck

two layers of milk jugs on the bottom
160<00:01:26.670> on<00:01:26.759> the<00:01:26.820> bottom<00:01:27.060> and<00:01:27.780> then<00:01:28.200> we<00:01:28.470> took<00:01:28.590> this

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
160 on the bottom and then we took this

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.429 
160 on the bottom and then we took this
piece<00:01:29.009> of<00:01:29.100> plywood<00:01:29.689> and<00:01:30.689> these<00:01:30.960> two<00:01:31.079> by<00:01:31.170> fours

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
piece of plywood and these two by fours

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.380 
piece of plywood and these two by fours
and<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.860> rails<00:01:32.070> which<00:01:32.490> are<00:01:32.610> -<00:01:32.790> no<00:01:33.240> tricks

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
and the rails which are - no tricks

and the rails which are - no tricks
higher<00:01:33.630> than<00:01:33.780> 64<00:01:34.200> on<00:01:34.290> the<00:01:34.380> rails<00:01:34.530> you<00:01:34.799> tape

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
higher than 64 on the rails you tape

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.580 
higher than 64 on the rails you tape
them<00:01:35.549> to<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.850> 2x4<00:01:36.329> and<00:01:36.600> then<00:01:37.049> we<00:01:37.140> screwed<00:01:37.439> the

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
them to the 2x4 and then we screwed the

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.069 
them to the 2x4 and then we screwed the
2x4<00:01:38.100> into<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:38.820> plywood<00:01:38.970> we<00:01:39.570> actually<00:01:39.869> taped

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
2x4 into the plywood we actually taped

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:44.990 
2x4 into the plywood we actually taped
the<00:01:40.680> bottom<00:01:41.329> to<00:01:42.329> the<00:01:42.659> plywood<00:01:43.549> so<00:01:44.549> it's<00:01:44.820> all<00:01:44.970> I

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
the bottom to the plywood so it's all I

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.770 
the bottom to the plywood so it's all I
mean<00:01:45.240> it's<00:01:45.360> all<00:01:45.450> together

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.090 

we'll<00:01:51.780> be<00:01:51.960> floating<00:01:52.350> it<00:01:52.440> in<00:01:52.560> a<00:01:52.620> couple<00:01:52.800> hours

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
we'll be floating it in a couple hours

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.220 
we'll be floating it in a couple hours
and<00:01:53.520> I'll<00:01:53.790> be<00:01:53.970> videotaping<00:01:54.390> that<00:01:54.450> also<00:01:54.630> Oh<00:01:57.230> in

00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:58.230 
and I'll be videotaping that also Oh in

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:59.540 
and I'll be videotaping that also Oh in
the<00:01:58.350> overall<00:01:58.740> amount<00:01:58.830> of<00:01:59.040> duct<00:01:59.190> tape<00:01:59.220> we<00:01:59.430> use

00:01:59.540 --> 00:01:59.550 
the overall amount of duct tape we use
