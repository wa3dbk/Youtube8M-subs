 boys what do you make menu 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.919
 how about a wonderful winter 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.740
 meal soups 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:13.440
 and this week is from kidney beans and 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:17.120
 for this old-fashioned dish you have the 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.120
 following ingredients 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.439
 the main constituent 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:24.960
 is of course kidney beans and they are coming 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:27.480
 this week from the pot and we make one 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.490
 broth of pork steaks a bit lukewarm 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.890
 you and you 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.079
 beef broth cubes tomato puree 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.390
 and tomato cubes 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.110
 then comes in that soup and pea soup 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.030
 package 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.340
 will be a shoot course 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.860
 artisan smoked bacon and we took 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.510
 season with sauce and we were right 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.539
 serve milk 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.129
 whole wheat bread and brown butter 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.870
 bean soup 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.329
 and old-fashioned and then you have to start 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.820
 making the broth in that 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:01.710
 we make pork steaks 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:05.400
 and tomato to start with cold water 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:08.869
 the large soup pan then you do that 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:12.090
 pork chops in it together with an outing 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:15.240
 and with a laurel 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:18.390
 so cold water why cold water 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.640
 Well then the meat has time to taste 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.009
 relinquishing the stock makes you warm 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.950
 water yes but sears it shut shut 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:28.020
 so it should be slow well then you grab 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:34.790
 just the tomato cubes that you put in 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:34.790
 once with a brief rinse but also 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:45.480
 contains all tomato pulp 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:47.430
 the stock cubes in it 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:50.310
 then we do a little bit 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:53.000
 Add tomato puree but I still like this 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.000
 more powerful of 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:58.760
 and a little bit of soup vegetables not old 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:09.479
 and then draw the broth after three 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.300
 quarter 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:15.510
 then that broth is ready and has the 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:21.420
 meat our taste ceded the scissors 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:24.690
 get out is hot and we get it out of it 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:27.450
 also there that already has its taste 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:29.370
 ceded look and the bay leaf that 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:33.560
 marlowe time and he we go the meat 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.560
 it's going to cut my pretty little cubes 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:51.120
 so you a separate 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:53.489
 now the beans go with the broth and not 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:56.300
 Shed that moisture also use that 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:56.300
 can be reached in one go 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:04.190
 not everything little bit left over for 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:04.190
 now for the garnish 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:09.140
 and then you buy and puree it 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:18.150
 and then puree for as long 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:22.370
 that it is completely fine not a vegetable 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:22.370
 can you see me everything must be pureed 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:31.010
 as now and then boiled for a while 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:39.950
 the bacon but now add the meat 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:52.920
 and finally leave the vegetables 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:54.960
 just nice to cook but that green menu 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:57.840
 the meat also becomes small 

00:03:54.960 --> 00:04:00.230
 bit this just needs to taste 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:03.330
 but one thing is important 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:04.200
 actually this is the tastiest when you have it 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:07.080
 one night 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:09.270
 let alone because then it pulls so completely 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:11.280
 and you really have a delicious one 

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:13.740
 make a meal soup with a flavor 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:16.830
 little protest sauce 

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:18.980
 few drops of salt and a little 

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:18.980
 pepper 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:34.890
 just stir it so taste it 

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:45.670
 yes super a delicious meal soup yet 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:47.050
 let it continue to drizzle for a while 

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:49.630
 are going to finish the dish 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:53.170
 use preheated plates first 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:54.820
 we left some beans in the plate and 

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:56.380
 why do we energize those beans 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:58.450
 one more time you are in nature 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:00.850
 want one we are in my finely ground and 

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:04.360
 then you see them again 

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:05.950
 this a tasty generous full scoop of soup 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:10.300
 so 

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:11.530
 green and that serve well there 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:14.140
 whole grain bread 

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:16.530
 contaminated with butter and then we make it 

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:20.169
 finish with a little fresh parsley 

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:23.500
 and this week we have a wonderful 

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:26.560
 old-fashioned Dutch meal soup 

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:29.470
 kidney beans and this time we link 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:33.480
 with a cool glass of milk the white 

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:33.480
 nice engine
