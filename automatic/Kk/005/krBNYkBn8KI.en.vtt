in a cave using commands redstone and a

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.370 
in a cave using commands redstone and a
few<00:00:35.340> workarounds<00:00:35.730> the<00:00:36.510> same<00:00:36.780> effect<00:00:37.170> can<00:00:37.260> be

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
few workarounds the same effect can be

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.280 
few workarounds the same effect can be
duplicated<00:00:38.010> in<00:00:38.190> vanilla<00:00:38.610> minecraft<00:00:38.940> and<00:00:39.510> it

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
duplicated in vanilla minecraft and it

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.130 
duplicated in vanilla minecraft and it
looks<00:00:40.469> pretty<00:00:40.649> good<00:00:40.920> if<00:00:41.040> you<00:00:41.160> ask<00:00:41.250> me<00:00:42.079> now<00:00:43.079> the

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
looks pretty good if you ask me now the

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.740 
looks pretty good if you ask me now the
way<00:00:43.440> this<00:00:43.620> works<00:00:43.920> is<00:00:44.070> pretty<00:00:44.399> straightforward

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:44.750 
way this works is pretty straightforward

you need them the simple explanation of

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.460 
you need them the simple explanation of
how<00:01:32.700> it<00:01:32.850> works<00:01:33.090> is<00:01:33.360> that<00:01:33.659> it<00:01:33.960> replaces<00:01:34.290> a

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
how it works is that it replaces a

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.130 
how it works is that it replaces a
certain<00:01:34.890> block<00:01:35.130> with<00:01:35.520> a<00:01:35.549> flower<00:01:35.909> when<00:01:36.810> it<00:01:36.930> does

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
certain block with a flower when it does

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.990 
certain block with a flower when it does
this<00:01:37.350> it<00:01:37.590> causes<00:01:37.979> the<00:01:38.130> flower<00:01:38.369> to<00:01:38.579> immediately

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
this it causes the flower to immediately

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.990 
this it causes the flower to immediately
break<00:01:39.360> into<00:01:39.659> item<00:01:39.960> form<00:01:40.259> which<00:01:41.040> essentially

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
break into item form which essentially

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.330 
break into item form which essentially
allows<00:01:42.150> you<00:01:42.899> to<00:01:43.020> turn<00:01:43.170> a<00:01:43.229> block<00:01:43.619> into<00:01:44.250> an

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
allows you to turn a block into an

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.330 
allows you to turn a block into an
entity<00:01:44.729> that<00:01:44.939> can<00:01:45.149> then<00:01:45.450> be<00:01:45.509> tracked<00:01:45.899> later

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
entity that can then be tracked later

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.069 
entity that can then be tracked later
this<00:01:47.340> entity<00:01:47.670> is<00:01:47.880> then<00:01:48.329> checked<00:01:48.600> for<00:01:48.840> stone

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
this entity is then checked for stone

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.800 
this entity is then checked for stone
above<00:01:49.320> it<00:01:49.500> and<00:01:49.680> if<00:01:50.100> it<00:01:50.369> is<00:01:50.490> successful<00:01:51.119> at<00:01:51.329> thin
