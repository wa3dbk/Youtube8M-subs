00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
me go ahead and hit a couple off the

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.380 
me go ahead and hit a couple off the
overhead<00:00:37.260> that<00:00:37.290> I'm<00:00:37.649> used<00:00:38.489> to<00:00:38.640> seeing<00:00:38.730> when

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
overhead that I'm used to seeing when

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.270 
overhead that I'm used to seeing when
you<00:00:39.420> guys<00:00:39.660> aren't<00:00:40.050> really<00:00:40.379> confident<00:00:41.129> about

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
you guys aren't really confident about

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:51.430 
you guys aren't really confident about
hitting<00:00:41.820> overheads<00:00:42.239> okay<00:00:42.600> so<00:00:43.200> mark<00:00:43.469> lobs<00:00:43.770> me

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:51.440 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.100 

okay<00:00:52.440> I<00:00:52.680> see<00:00:53.100> that<00:00:53.129> so<00:00:53.969> often<00:00:54.510> it's<00:00:54.690> just<00:00:54.780> that

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
okay I see that so often it's just that

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.770 
okay I see that so often it's just that
play<00:00:55.469> where<00:00:55.829> we<00:00:55.949> let<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.190> arm<00:00:56.489> drop<00:00:56.850> we<00:00:57.600> let

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
play where we let the arm drop we let

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.139 
play where we let the arm drop we let
the<00:00:57.930> ball<00:00:58.140> drop<00:00:58.410> it's<00:00:59.219> this<00:00:59.489> safe<00:00:59.879> little

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
the ball drop it's this safe little

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.500 
the ball drop it's this safe little
environment<00:01:00.899> and<00:01:01.699> you<00:01:02.699> guys<00:01:02.850> make<00:01:03.239> those

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
environment and you guys make those

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.509 
environment and you guys make those
which<00:01:03.899> is<00:01:04.049> probably<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.409> most<00:01:04.589> unfortunate

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
which is probably the most unfortunate

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.890 
which is probably the most unfortunate
part<00:01:05.760> about<00:01:05.850> it<00:01:06.290> because<00:01:07.290> my<00:01:07.619> opponent<00:01:08.900> feels

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
part about it because my opponent feels

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.380 
part about it because my opponent feels
no<00:01:10.320> pressure<00:01:10.740> against<00:01:11.280> that<00:01:11.430> shot<00:01:11.729> what<00:01:12.240> is

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
no pressure against that shot what is

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.870 
no pressure against that shot what is
going<00:01:12.720> to<00:01:12.750> keep<00:01:13.020> them<00:01:13.350> from<00:01:13.650> continuing<00:01:13.920> to

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
going to keep them from continuing to

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.230 
going to keep them from continuing to
lob<00:01:15.090> me<00:01:15.420> when<00:01:16.170> I<00:01:16.200> come<00:01:16.530> into<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:17.009> net<00:01:17.220> if<00:01:17.520> my

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
lob me when I come into the net if my

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.929 
lob me when I come into the net if my
only<00:01:18.659> response<00:01:19.200> is<00:01:19.560> this<00:01:19.979> weak<00:01:20.280> little<00:01:20.670> push

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
only response is this weak little push

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.420 
only response is this weak little push
back<00:01:21.439> and<00:01:22.439> my<00:01:22.650> right<00:01:22.680> mark

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
back and my right mark

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.090 
back and my right mark
okay<00:01:24.420> so<00:01:24.479> mark<00:01:25.229> feels<00:01:25.530> like<00:01:25.770> he<00:01:25.950> would

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
okay so mark feels like he would

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.760 
okay so mark feels like he would
continue<00:01:26.310> to<00:01:26.640> lob<00:01:26.939> me<00:01:26.990> so<00:01:27.990> something<00:01:28.439> I<00:01:28.530> want

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
you guys to start to adopt is this idea

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.350 
you guys to start to adopt is this idea
that<00:01:31.350> you<00:01:32.100> got<00:01:32.220> to<00:01:32.400> be<00:01:32.490> okay<00:01:32.850> with<00:01:33.060> missing

that you got to be okay with missing

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.690 
that you got to be okay with missing
some<00:01:33.750> overheads<00:01:34.380> and<00:01:34.710> get<00:01:35.369> into<00:01:35.610> the

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
some overheads and get into the

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.280 
some overheads and get into the
mentality<00:01:36.299> where<00:01:36.570> you're<00:01:36.720> sending<00:01:37.020> a<00:01:37.259> message

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
mentality where you're sending a message

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.730 
mentality where you're sending a message
to<00:01:38.009> your<00:01:38.159> opponent<00:01:38.729> that<00:01:39.299> is<00:01:39.360> it<00:01:39.780> is<00:01:40.020> a<00:01:40.049> mistake

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
the court we want a big explosive bounce

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.710

out<00:01:49.229> of<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:49.649> court<00:01:49.920> obviously<00:01:50.759> I'm<00:01:51.420> probably

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
out of the court obviously I'm probably

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.690 
out of the court obviously I'm probably
taking<00:01:52.170> a<00:01:52.259> little<00:01:52.439> more<00:01:52.649> risk<00:01:53.040> there<00:01:53.369> if<00:01:53.520> I'm

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
taking a little more risk there if I'm

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.420 
taking a little more risk there if I'm
not<00:01:53.909> used<00:01:54.240> to<00:01:54.360> that<00:01:54.570> swing<00:01:54.950> but<00:01:55.950> at<00:01:56.070> the<00:01:56.189> same

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
not used to that swing but at the same

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.670 
not used to that swing but at the same
time<00:01:56.729> even<00:01:56.909> if<00:01:57.090> I<00:01:57.240> miss<00:01:57.509> it<00:01:57.750> it's<00:01:58.409> on<00:01:58.649> my

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
time even if I miss it it's on my

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.830 
time even if I miss it it's on my
opponents<00:01:59.369> mind<00:01:59.610> that<00:01:59.850> wow<00:01:59.969> this<00:02:00.210> guy<00:02:00.390> really

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
opponents mind that wow this guy really

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.050 
opponents mind that wow this guy really
tries<00:02:01.170> to<00:02:01.200> go<00:02:01.619> after<00:02:01.799> his<00:02:02.159> overhead<00:02:02.640> I<00:02:02.670> should

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
tries to go after his overhead I should

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.560 
tries to go after his overhead I should
think<00:02:03.360> twice<00:02:03.630> about<00:02:05.240> lobbing<00:02:06.240> this<00:02:06.390> guy

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
think twice about lobbing this guy

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.139 
think twice about lobbing this guy
especially<00:02:07.500> if<00:02:07.590> you<00:02:08.039> guys<00:02:08.190> make<00:02:08.489> a<00:02:08.520> couple<00:02:08.849> and

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
especially if you guys make a couple and

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.600 
especially if you guys make a couple and
that's<00:02:09.660> a<00:02:09.810> great<00:02:10.050> idea<00:02:10.379> for<00:02:10.590> your<00:02:10.739> warm<00:02:11.099> ups<00:02:11.400> in

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
that's a great idea for your warm ups in

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:12.699 
that's a great idea for your warm ups in
your<00:02:11.760> matches

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 
your matches

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:14.450 
your matches
concentrate<00:02:13.860> really

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:14.460 
concentrate really

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:16.280 
concentrate really
really<00:02:14.760> well<00:02:14.970> in<00:02:15.210> your<00:02:15.240> warm-up<00:02:15.900> on<00:02:16.080> your

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
really well in your warm-up on your

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.180 
really well in your warm-up on your
overhead<00:02:16.680> and<00:02:17.270> hit<00:02:18.270> them<00:02:18.540> pretty<00:02:19.170> big<00:02:19.620> so<00:02:20.040> that

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
overhead and hit them pretty big so that

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:21.950 
overhead and hit them pretty big so that
your<00:02:20.340> opponent<00:02:20.490> even<00:02:21.270> before<00:02:21.420> the<00:02:21.720> match

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
your opponent even before the match

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:27.950 
your opponent even before the match
starts<00:02:22.910> respects<00:02:23.910> your<00:02:24.450> overhead<00:02:24.990> okay<00:02:25.640> so<00:02:26.960> my

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:27.960 
starts respects your overhead okay so my

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.050 
starts respects your overhead okay so my
mindset<00:02:28.620> with<00:02:28.800> these<00:02:29.010> as<00:02:29.220> so<00:02:29.400> long<00:02:29.640> as<00:02:29.820> I've

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
mindset with these as so long as I've

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.200 
mindset with these as so long as I've
understood<00:02:31.160> that<00:02:32.160> I'm<00:02:32.280> getting<00:02:32.580> a<00:02:32.640> lob<00:02:32.850> and<00:02:33.150> I

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:33.210 
understood that I'm getting a lob and I

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:36.740 
understood that I'm getting a lob and I
and<00:02:33.540> I'm<00:02:33.950> early<00:02:34.950> about<00:02:35.250> my<00:02:35.460> reaction<00:02:35.700> time<00:02:36.360> if

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
and I'm early about my reaction time if

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.830 
and I'm early about my reaction time if
I<00:02:37.140> set<00:02:37.530> well<00:02:37.830> I<00:02:38.190> then<00:02:38.970> go<00:02:39.150> into<00:02:39.330> this<00:02:39.540> mode

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
I set well I then go into this mode

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.570 
I set well I then go into this mode
where<00:02:40.140> I'm<00:02:40.260> just<00:02:40.440> trying<00:02:40.830> to<00:02:40.950> hit<00:02:41.370> the<00:02:41.550> ball

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
where I'm just trying to hit the ball

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.330 
where I'm just trying to hit the ball
really<00:02:42.420> really<00:02:42.750> big<00:02:43.020> okay<00:02:43.620> so<00:02:43.680> let's<00:02:44.130> take<00:02:44.280> a

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
really really big okay so let's take a

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:57.950 
really really big okay so let's take a
look<00:02:44.610> at<00:02:44.760> some<00:02:44.940> of<00:02:45.060> those<00:02:54.560> okay<00:02:55.590> now<00:02:56.810> I've<00:02:57.810> been

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:57.960 
look at some of those okay now I've been

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:59.480 
look at some of those okay now I've been
playing<00:02:58.260> a<00:02:58.350> long<00:02:58.530> time<00:02:58.800> I've<00:02:59.070> got<00:02:59.220> a<00:02:59.250> pretty

00:02:59.480 --> 00:02:59.490 
playing a long time I've got a pretty

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:02.000 
playing a long time I've got a pretty
good<00:02:59.670> overhead<00:03:00.150> so<00:03:00.810> for<00:03:01.110> me<00:03:01.260> the<00:03:01.590> idea<00:03:01.950> of

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
good overhead so for me the idea of

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.180 
good overhead so for me the idea of
crushing<00:03:02.730> my<00:03:02.850> overheads<00:03:03.620> still<00:03:04.620> results<00:03:05.100> in

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
crushing my overheads still results in

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.490 
crushing my overheads still results in
me<00:03:05.400> making<00:03:05.790> most<00:03:06.150> of<00:03:06.330> my<00:03:06.450> overheads<00:03:06.900> but<00:03:07.320> that

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
me making most of my overheads but that

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.310 
me making most of my overheads but that
wasn't<00:03:07.890> always<00:03:08.010> the<00:03:08.250> case<00:03:08.280> I<00:03:08.780> had<00:03:09.780> to<00:03:09.990> get<00:03:10.140> into

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320 
wasn't always the case I had to get into

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.210 
wasn't always the case I had to get into
a<00:03:10.470> pattern<00:03:11.040> where<00:03:11.310> the<00:03:11.340> log<00:03:11.790> to<00:03:12.210> me<00:03:12.390> was<00:03:12.690> not

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
a pattern where the log to me was not

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.430 
a pattern where the log to me was not
something<00:03:14.220> that<00:03:14.400> made<00:03:14.700> me<00:03:14.880> nervous<00:03:15.440> but

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
something that made me nervous but

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.190 
something that made me nervous but
something<00:03:16.830> that<00:03:16.860> I'd<00:03:17.100> like<00:03:17.310> to<00:03:17.370> see<00:03:17.820> and<00:03:18.200> once

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
something that I'd like to see and once

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.670 
something that I'd like to see and once
I<00:03:19.380> got<00:03:19.560> into<00:03:19.770> that<00:03:19.980> mindset<00:03:20.550> that<00:03:21.320> swing<00:03:22.320> just

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
I got into that mindset that swing just

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.910 
I got into that mindset that swing just
starts<00:03:23.160> to<00:03:23.430> really<00:03:23.850> click<00:03:24.330> and<00:03:24.660> I<00:03:25.530> think<00:03:25.770> you

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
starts to really click and I think you

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.260 
starts to really click and I think you
guys<00:03:26.100> will<00:03:26.430> find<00:03:26.790> that<00:03:27.530> coming<00:03:28.530> into<00:03:28.680> the<00:03:28.920> net

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:29.270 
guys will find that coming into the net

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:31.880 
guys will find that coming into the net
playing<00:03:30.270> these<00:03:30.540> people<00:03:30.900> that<00:03:31.020> lob<00:03:31.290> you<00:03:31.560> a<00:03:31.590> lot

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
when you get into the net will start to

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:37.250 
when you get into the net will start to
be<00:03:34.470> something<00:03:34.920> you<00:03:35.070> crave<00:03:35.550> if<00:03:36.030> you<00:03:36.840> guys<00:03:37.020> are

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
really trying to crush the overhead

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:40.730 
really trying to crush the overhead
where<00:03:39.540> if<00:03:39.660> you're<00:03:39.810> going<00:03:40.080> up<00:03:40.200> there<00:03:40.380> just<00:03:40.650> to

the opponent has no problem continuing

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:51.290 
the opponent has no problem continuing
to<00:03:48.690> lob<00:03:48.900> you<00:03:49.170> because<00:03:50.040> they<00:03:50.190> don't<00:03:50.340> you<00:03:51.180> know

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:51.300

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
see any real threat coming off your

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.810 
see any real threat coming off your
overhead<00:03:54.680> it's<00:03:55.680> just<00:03:55.950> kind<00:03:56.160> of<00:03:56.220> this<00:03:56.340> endless

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:56.820 
overhead it's just kind of this endless

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:01.750 
overhead it's just kind of this endless
vicious<00:03:57.480> cycle<00:03:57.960> so<00:03:58.310> be<00:03:59.310> okay<00:03:59.640> with<00:03:59.850> missing

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:01.760 
vicious cycle so be okay with missing

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.430 
vicious cycle so be okay with missing
obviously<00:04:02.760> if<00:04:02.970> if<00:04:03.300> you<00:04:03.510> are<00:04:03.540> missing<00:04:03.930> a<00:04:04.200> lot

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
obviously if if you are missing a lot

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.650 
obviously if if you are missing a lot
when<00:04:04.950> you<00:04:05.070> have<00:04:05.100> this<00:04:05.430> mentality<00:04:05.850> of<00:04:06.180> crushing

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 
when you have this mentality of crushing

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:08.810 
when you have this mentality of crushing
your<00:04:06.750> overhead<00:04:07.200> give<00:04:08.160> yourself<00:04:08.550> a<00:04:08.670> little

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:08.820 
your overhead give yourself a little

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:11.360 
your overhead give yourself a little
more<00:04:09.030> margin<00:04:09.540> maybe<00:04:09.720> aim<00:04:10.050> a<00:04:10.080> little<00:04:10.500> closer<00:04:11.010> to

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
more margin maybe aim a little closer to

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:14.510 
more margin maybe aim a little closer to
the<00:04:11.490> middle<00:04:11.760> of<00:04:11.970> the<00:04:12.090> court<00:04:13.100> instead<00:04:14.100> of<00:04:14.250> going

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:14.520 
the middle of the court instead of going

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.849 
the middle of the court instead of going
for<00:04:14.730> the<00:04:14.820> sidelines<00:04:15.390> and<00:04:15.690> that<00:04:15.870> way<00:04:16.109> if<00:04:16.380> if

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:16.859 
for the sidelines and that way if if

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:19.310 
for the sidelines and that way if if
you're<00:04:17.130> a<00:04:17.160> little<00:04:17.400> off<00:04:17.670> line<00:04:18.060> you're<00:04:18.989> still

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 
you're a little off line you're still

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.039 
you're a little off line you're still
within<00:04:19.560> the<00:04:19.830> singles<00:04:20.190> court<00:04:20.460> okay<00:04:21.020> but<00:04:22.020> I

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
within the singles court okay but I

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:23.390 
within the singles court okay but I
think<00:04:22.290> you<00:04:22.380> guys<00:04:22.500> will<00:04:22.680> have<00:04:22.740> a<00:04:22.860> lot<00:04:23.100> of<00:04:23.220> fun

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
think you guys will have a lot of fun
