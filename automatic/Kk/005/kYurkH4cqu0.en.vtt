00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
of the 200 megabytes of data per month

slow down to 2g speeds I don't know how

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.119 
slow down to 2g speeds I don't know how
bad<00:01:03.149> that<00:01:03.420> is<00:01:03.480> at<00:01:03.870> this<00:01:04.110> point<00:01:04.379> in<00:01:04.559> time<00:01:04.739> at

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
use it it'll just slow down to 2g speeds

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.920 
use it it'll just slow down to 2g speeds
dude<00:01:14.070> that<00:01:14.400> is<00:01:14.430> freaking<00:01:15.150> awesome<00:01:15.650> and<00:01:16.759> then

you were also wondering can you add a

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.929 
you were also wondering can you add a
plan<00:01:21.900> to<00:01:22.170> your<00:01:22.320> current<00:01:22.799> t-mobile<00:01:23.189> plan<00:01:23.580> and

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
plan to your current t-mobile plan and

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.249 
plan to your current t-mobile plan and
that<00:01:24.299> absolutely<00:01:25.640> absolutely<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:27.600> prices

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
that absolutely absolutely the prices

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.249 
that absolutely absolutely the prices
are<00:01:28.770> like<00:01:29.520> for<00:01:29.729> instance<00:01:30.060> if<00:01:30.240> you<00:01:30.420> wanted<00:01:30.810> 1

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
are like for instance if you wanted 1

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.630 
are like for instance if you wanted 1
gigabytes<00:01:31.770> of<00:01:31.920> 1<00:01:32.340> gigabyte<00:01:32.939> of<00:01:33.259> 3G<00:01:34.259> data

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
gigabytes of 1 gigabyte of 3G data

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.030 
gigabytes of 1 gigabyte of 3G data
that'll<00:01:35.640> be<00:01:35.729> $10<00:01:36.270> a<00:01:36.299> month<00:01:36.420> and<00:01:36.869> they<00:01:37.619> go<00:01:37.799> up

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
that'll be $10 a month and they go up

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.969 
that'll be $10 a month and they go up
and<00:01:38.280> $10<00:01:38.909> increments<00:01:39.329> so<00:01:40.049> one<00:01:40.409> gigabyte<00:01:40.799> is

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
and $10 increments so one gigabyte is

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.920 
and $10 increments so one gigabyte is
$10<00:01:41.670> 3<00:01:42.540> gigabytes<00:01:42.840> is<00:01:43.229> $20<00:01:44.070> 5<00:01:44.850> gigabytes<00:01:45.630> is

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
$10 3 gigabytes is $20 5 gigabytes is

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.039 
$10 3 gigabytes is $20 5 gigabytes is
$30<00:01:46.829> and<00:01:47.130> then<00:01:47.430> it<00:01:47.670> goes<00:01:47.939> up<00:01:47.970> so<00:01:48.450> on<00:01:48.659> and<00:01:48.869> so<00:01:49.020> on

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
$30 and then it goes up so on and so on

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.810 
$30 and then it goes up so on and so on
so<00:01:50.000> that's<00:01:51.000> not<00:01:51.240> bad<00:01:51.450> they<00:01:51.960> can<00:01:52.200> also<00:01:52.759> if<00:01:53.759> you

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
so that's not bad they can also if you

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.270 
so that's not bad they can also if you
called<00:01:54.450> them<00:01:54.750> they<00:01:54.960> can<00:01:55.140> also<00:01:55.320> bump<00:01:56.040> you<00:01:56.250> up

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
for a month and then it'll go back down

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.770 
for a month and then it'll go back down
to<00:01:58.890> the<00:01:59.070> 200<00:01:59.579> megabytes<00:02:00.090> all<00:02:00.360> you<00:02:00.479> I<00:02:00.540> do<00:02:00.600> is

to the 200 megabytes all you I do is

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.560 
to the 200 megabytes all you I do is
call<00:02:01.020> them<00:02:01.340> you<00:02:02.340> can<00:02:02.490> also<00:02:02.670> get<00:02:03.000> on<00:02:03.180> the<00:02:03.329> little
