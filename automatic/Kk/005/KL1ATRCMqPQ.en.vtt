basically<00:00:18.029> I've<00:00:18.300> built<00:00:18.600> a<00:00:18.750> giant<00:00:19.020> pokéball<00:00:19.560> um

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:20.000 
basically I've built a giant pokéball um

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.960 
basically I've built a giant pokéball um
it<00:00:21.000> didn't<00:00:21.359> take<00:00:21.869> too<00:00:21.900> much<00:00:22.439> effort<00:00:22.760> the<00:00:23.760> only

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
it didn't take too much effort the only

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.170 
it didn't take too much effort the only
problems<00:00:24.539> i<00:00:24.689> really<00:00:25.080> had<00:00:25.460> were<00:00:26.460> the<00:00:26.519> fact<00:00:27.029> that

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
problems i really had were the fact that

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.019 
problems i really had were the fact that
the<00:00:27.420> black<00:00:27.720> outlining<00:00:28.289> was<00:00:28.650> kind<00:00:29.550> of<00:00:29.640> uneven

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
the black outlining was kind of uneven

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.380 
the black outlining was kind of uneven
and<00:00:30.650> the<00:00:31.650> button<00:00:32.009> was<00:00:32.550> kind<00:00:32.790> of<00:00:32.850> hard<00:00:33.059> to<00:00:33.149> do

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
and the button was kind of hard to do

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.670 
and the button was kind of hard to do
because<00:00:33.630> i<00:00:33.870> had<00:00:34.140> to<00:00:35.630> well<00:00:36.630> it's<00:00:36.989> because<00:00:37.440> of

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
because i had to well it's because of

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.150 
because i had to well it's because of
the<00:00:37.860> shape<00:00:38.629> you<00:00:39.629> have<00:00:39.750> to<00:00:39.930> make<00:00:40.110> the<00:00:40.410> outside

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
the shape you have to make the outside

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.470 
the shape you have to make the outside
like<00:00:41.820> shapes<00:00:42.270> I<00:00:42.690> mean<00:00:43.350> like<00:00:43.500> stairs<00:00:43.890> and<00:00:44.250> it's

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:44.480 
like shapes I mean like stairs and it's

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.690 
like shapes I mean like stairs and it's
kind<00:00:45.480> of<00:00:45.570> hard<00:00:45.809> obviously<00:00:46.800> you<00:00:47.190> can<00:00:47.340> see<00:00:47.489> that

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
kind of hard obviously you can see that

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.660 
kind of hard obviously you can see that
these<00:00:47.850> two<00:00:48.090> are<00:00:48.120> different<00:00:48.750> but<00:00:48.989> you<00:00:49.320> know<00:00:49.770> i'm

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
these two are different but you know i'm

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.040 
these two are different but you know i'm
not<00:00:50.940> going<00:00:51.120> to<00:00:51.149> walk<00:00:51.360> you<00:00:51.510> through<00:00:51.570> a<00:00:51.780> whole

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
not going to walk you through a whole

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.200 
not going to walk you through a whole
process<00:00:52.079> because<00:00:52.949> you<00:00:53.070> can<00:00:53.280> kind<00:00:53.579> of<00:00:53.730> see<00:00:53.940> what

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
process because you can kind of see what

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.360 
process because you can kind of see what
I've<00:00:54.329> done<00:00:54.600> here<00:00:54.660> just<00:00:55.620> by<00:00:55.739> looking<00:00:56.190> at<00:00:56.280> it<00:00:56.489> um

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:58.370 
I've done here just by looking at it um

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:04.219 
I've done here just by looking at it um
wait<00:00:59.370> a<00:00:59.430> second<00:00:59.989> little<00:01:00.989> details<00:01:01.559> count<00:01:03.229> this

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
wait a second little details count this

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.320 
wait a second little details count this
should<00:01:04.500> be<00:01:04.710> here<00:01:05.339> and<00:01:05.909> this<00:01:06.210> should<00:01:06.479> be<00:01:08.330> here

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
should be here and this should be here

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.990 
should be here and this should be here
now<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.710> one<00:01:11.250> cube<00:01:11.610> thick<00:01:12.030> idea<00:01:12.570> gives<00:01:13.080> it<00:01:13.290> the

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 
now the one cube thick idea gives it the

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:21.200 
now the one cube thick idea gives it the
8-bit<00:01:15.020> pixel<00:01:16.020> effect<00:01:19.700> see<00:01:20.700> right<00:01:20.909> now<00:01:20.939> this

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
8-bit pixel effect see right now this

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.050 
8-bit pixel effect see right now this
angle<00:01:21.570> doesn't<00:01:21.720> look<00:01:21.990> like<00:01:22.110> it's<00:01:22.320> kind<00:01:22.590> of<00:01:22.680> big

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060 
angle doesn't look like it's kind of big

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.789 
angle doesn't look like it's kind of big
then<00:01:24.060> when<00:01:24.210> you<00:01:24.330> straight<00:01:24.930> now<00:01:25.140> for<00:01:25.380> a<00:01:25.409> second

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
then when you straight now for a second

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:30.440 
then when you straight now for a second
it<00:01:25.890> actually<00:01:26.400> looks<00:01:26.549> better<00:01:26.900> armed<00:01:27.900> and<00:01:29.450> what

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
building that you know in 1.6 they've

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.590 
building that you know in 1.6 they've
really<00:02:51.090> changed<00:02:51.330> a<00:02:52.110> lot<00:02:52.380> of<00:02:52.500> things<00:02:53.000> but<00:02:54.000> you

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
really changed a lot of things but you

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.570 
really changed a lot of things but you
know<00:02:54.720> these<00:02:55.350> mods<00:02:55.620> have<00:02:55.770> to<00:02:55.890> change<00:02:56.100> to<00:02:56.340> like

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
know these mods have to change to like

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.910 
know these mods have to change to like
for<00:02:56.760> example<00:02:56.820> a<00:02:57.120> trapdoor<00:02:57.560> so<00:02:58.560> on<00:02:58.709> and<00:02:58.860> so

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
for example a trapdoor so on and so

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:04.790 
for example a trapdoor so on and so
forth<00:02:59.010> but<00:03:02.630> this<00:03:03.630> video<00:03:03.959> is<00:03:04.050> about<00:03:04.170> this<00:03:04.500> I

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 
forth but this video is about this I

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:10.100 
forth but this video is about this I
mean<00:03:07.790> so<00:03:08.790> basically<00:03:09.120> you<00:03:09.270> can<00:03:09.420> see<00:03:09.630> that<00:03:09.780> I<00:03:09.810> had

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
mean so basically you can see that I had

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.520 
mean so basically you can see that I had
to<00:03:11.180> start<00:03:12.180> with<00:03:12.330> the<00:03:12.450> outline<00:03:12.900> because<00:03:13.200> I

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
to start with the outline because I

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.650 
to start with the outline because I
didn't<00:03:13.769> know<00:03:13.890> what<00:03:13.980> I<00:03:14.040> was<00:03:14.100> doing<00:03:14.459> and<00:03:14.640> then<00:03:15.480> I

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
didn't know what I was doing and then I

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:24.140 
didn't know what I was doing and then I
work<00:03:16.440> my<00:03:16.650> way<00:03:17.360> thrilled<00:03:19.130> and<00:03:21.620> had<00:03:22.620> gotten<00:03:23.519> all

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
work my way thrilled and had gotten all

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:28.040 
work my way thrilled and had gotten all
the<00:03:24.390> way<00:03:25.880> the<00:03:26.880> only<00:03:27.030> thing<00:03:27.180> I<00:03:27.300> do<00:03:27.360> feel<00:03:27.840> though

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.050 
the way the only thing I do feel though

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:30.170 
the way the only thing I do feel though
is<00:03:28.080> the<00:03:28.440> lightning<00:03:28.890> because<00:03:29.519> if<00:03:29.880> it<00:03:30.030> does

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
is the lightning because if it does

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.170 
is the lightning because if it does
happen<00:03:30.360> to<00:03:30.690> strike<00:03:31.220> and<00:03:32.220> it's<00:03:32.640> all<00:03:32.820> the<00:03:32.970> way<00:03:33.000> up

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
happen to strike and it's all the way up

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.530 
happen to strike and it's all the way up
top<00:03:33.480> and<00:03:34.440> I<00:03:34.739> might<00:03:34.980> not<00:03:35.130> have<00:03:35.340> fly<00:03:35.940> on<00:03:36.269> or

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
top and I might not have fly on or

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.690 
top and I might not have fly on or
single<00:03:36.900> player<00:03:37.080> commands<00:03:37.530> installed<00:03:37.980> it<00:03:38.670> will

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
single player commands installed it will

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.660 
single player commands installed it will
burn<00:03:39.269> down<00:03:39.739> once<00:03:40.739> again<00:03:40.830> not<00:03:41.280> as<00:03:41.430> easily

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
burn down once again not as easily

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.670 
burn down once again not as easily
