00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:08.480
 again dialog competence schoolchildren 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.480
 give security 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.940
 the coat on over the hearts luck 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.330
 the chest and a walrus beard in the 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.880
 this is dietmar gabbert vfl fan 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.040
 and trainings lapwings rejoices 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.189
 currently that he has his vfl 

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:28.110
 no longer recognizable in the 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:31.140
 Immediately you see it again 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:32.910
 The card game game is allowed because you 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.730
 Do you play those years you already missed? 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.950
 you yes over bochum radiates again 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.750
 sun after several dull years 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.790
 suddenly come the again 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.730
 Objectives because there are stories too 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:47.370
 tell stories like those of the new guy simon 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.829
 terodde at union berlin last season 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.600
 on the siding at the vfl with five 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.679
 goals in three goalsgetter 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.809
 as such 

00:00:52.679 --> 00:00:57.749
 how do you have that from berlin to bochum? 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.820
 the clarification is quite simple that 

00:00:57.749 --> 00:01:01.409
 I certainly not so last year 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.059
 many times did not work either 

00:01:01.409 --> 00:01:04.710
 Many goals have fired heavy 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.090
 for me that's often on the bench 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.830
 and then makes you look now playing 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.550
 Of course, one thought 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.229
 simplifying change 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:13.140
 we once re-set the scene 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.310
 like the trainer Peter Neururer at the time 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.320
 talk with manager christian 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:20.040
 hochstÃ¤tter a new striker 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.590
 but now it was synonymous for 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.120
 the new season 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:27.540
 I need a very special one 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:30.030
 player was missing with us so his club has 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.790
 he looks at it home and the thing 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:37.140
 I invite pure order so this 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:40.500
 player with you right now and me 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.790
 want that man tomorrow for us 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.200
 provided 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:48.830
 and combed in the morning 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:51.330
 Shaved and in a good mood as well as top quality 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:56.670
 A business office is waiting for us 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:58.980
 is feasible that's not a problem to 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.890
 I will visit the player at the beginning 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:03.450
 vom vfl bochum had great talks with 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.130
 the trainer and the christian 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.540
 HochstÃ¤tter and then it was me 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.890
 not quite clear that I understand the 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.099
 would like to step here 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:14.610
 So I ask because the question was what 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:17.240
 I invest for this player 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.100
 and now it does not come 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.890
 free transfer despite a running 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:24.020
 contract and now against union den 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.670
 he did not want an old club anymore 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:27.650
 it is a normal game 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.870
 certainly not worthy to lie 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:33.970
 simon terodde so far 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.970
 Great bargains of the current season
