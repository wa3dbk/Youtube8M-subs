00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:31.010 
oh here i guess i can crack it open and

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:35.270 
oh here i guess i can crack it open and
just<00:01:32.010> the<00:01:32.340> top<00:01:32.640> layer<00:01:33.110> it<00:01:34.110> was<00:01:34.320> a<00:01:34.350> beginning<00:01:34.740> to

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
just the top layer it was a beginning to

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:42.020 
just the top layer it was a beginning to
get<00:01:35.430> together<00:01:35.640> ah<00:01:38.810> there<00:01:40.490> you<00:01:41.490> can<00:01:41.670> see<00:01:41.700> what's

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
get together ah there you can see what's

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:50.750 
get together ah there you can see what's
inside<00:01:43.460> just<00:01:44.460> put<00:01:45.330> these<00:01:45.570> back<00:01:45.930> on<00:01:49.460> the<00:01:50.460> white

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:50.760 
inside just put these back on the white

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:56.110 
inside just put these back on the white
anytime<00:01:51.980> so<00:01:52.980> this<00:01:53.190> is<00:01:53.220> a<00:01:54.200> technique

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:56.120 
anytime so this is a technique

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.460 
anytime so this is a technique
techniques<00:01:57.120> piece<00:01:57.450> in<00:01:57.690> there<00:01:57.780> with<00:01:57.960> a<00:01:58.020> spring

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:58.470 
techniques piece in there with a spring

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:06.230 
techniques piece in there with a spring
on<00:01:58.650> that<00:02:00.290> with<00:02:01.290> some<00:02:01.590> nice<00:02:01.830> smooth<00:02:02.310> tops<00:02:05.240> and

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
on that with some nice smooth tops and

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.900 
on that with some nice smooth tops and
then<00:02:06.660> it<00:02:06.900> pushes<00:02:07.080> down<00:02:07.440> on<00:02:07.500> there<00:02:10.400> ya<00:02:11.400> popped

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
then it pushes down on there ya popped

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:20.540 
then it pushes down on there ya popped
in<00:02:12.180> there<00:02:17.300> this<00:02:18.300> way<00:02:18.540> oh<00:02:18.810> and<00:02:19.370> nothing<00:02:20.370> is

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
in there this way oh and nothing is

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.160 
in there this way oh and nothing is
permanent<00:02:20.820> either<00:02:21.330> everything's<00:02:21.930> just

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
permanent either everything's just

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
permanent either everything's just
wedged<00:02:22.530> in<00:02:22.830> here<00:02:22.860> just<00:02:23.280> perfectly<00:02:27.500> yeah<00:02:30.440> ok<00:02:31.440> we

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
wedged in here just perfectly yeah ok we

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:38.060 
wedged in here just perfectly yeah ok we
just<00:02:32.780> steep<00:02:34.430> and<00:02:35.430> it's<00:02:35.550> just<00:02:35.850> it
