dr. Miller I guess I just talked a
little<00:00:18.500> bit<00:00:18.650> about<00:00:18.770> Android<00:00:19.670> and<00:00:20.060> iOS<00:00:20.900> and

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:21.529 
little bit about Android and iOS and

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:23.080 
little bit about Android and iOS and
sort<00:00:21.710> of<00:00:21.770> comparing<00:00:22.160> them<00:00:22.310> I<00:00:22.520> get<00:00:22.730> asked<00:00:22.970> this

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:23.090 
sort of comparing them I get asked this

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:24.310 
sort of comparing them I get asked this
question<00:00:23.180> a<00:00:23.450> lot<00:00:23.570> about<00:00:23.869> what's<00:00:24.200> the<00:00:24.290> most

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:24.320 
question a lot about what's the most

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:29.140 
question a lot about what's the most
secure<00:00:26.950> basically<00:00:27.950> I<00:00:27.980> never<00:00:28.400> say<00:00:28.790> between

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:29.150 
secure basically I never say between

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:31.570 
secure basically I never say between
those<00:00:29.420> two<00:00:29.660> iOS<00:00:30.650> is<00:00:30.800> quite<00:00:30.980> a<00:00:31.009> bit<00:00:31.130> more<00:00:31.189> secure

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:31.580 
those two iOS is quite a bit more secure

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:33.490 
those two iOS is quite a bit more secure
even<00:00:32.330> though<00:00:32.390> I<00:00:32.419> pick<00:00:32.690> on<00:00:32.809> it<00:00:32.930> a<00:00:32.989> lot<00:00:33.110> and<00:00:33.379> I

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:33.500 
even though I pick on it a lot and I

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.729 
even though I pick on it a lot and I
broke<00:00:34.040> into<00:00:34.309> it<00:00:34.340> for<00:00:34.699> a<00:00:34.760> pond<00:00:34.910> own<00:00:35.120> yeah<00:00:35.739> it's

00:00:36.729 --> 00:00:36.739 
broke into it for a pond own yeah it's

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:37.990 
broke into it for a pond own yeah it's
not<00:00:36.890> invincible<00:00:37.220> by<00:00:37.520> any<00:00:37.640> means<00:00:37.820> what's

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:38.000 
not invincible by any means what's

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.810 
not invincible by any means what's
better<00:00:38.180> and<00:00:38.780> so<00:00:39.250> if<00:00:40.250> you<00:00:40.340> look<00:00:40.460> at<00:00:40.610> the<00:00:40.730> way

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:40.820 
better and so if you look at the way

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:42.880 
better and so if you look at the way
that<00:00:41.059> they're<00:00:41.210> they're<00:00:41.570> basically<00:00:42.379> two<00:00:42.710> ways

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:42.890 
that they're they're basically two ways

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.070 
that they're they're basically two ways
that<00:00:43.100> code<00:00:43.220> gets<00:00:43.460> onto<00:00:43.640> a<00:00:43.790> system<00:00:44.030> one<00:00:44.930> is

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:45.080 
that code gets onto a system one is

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.740 
that code gets onto a system one is
through<00:00:45.470> malware<00:00:46.300> so<00:00:47.300> it's<00:00:47.420> a<00:00:47.480> stuffy

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:47.750 
through malware so it's a stuffy

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:49.600 
through malware so it's a stuffy
download<00:00:48.110> run<00:00:48.320> so<00:00:48.920> we<00:00:49.010> can<00:00:49.130> pair<00:00:49.280> the<00:00:49.430> two

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:49.610 
download run so we can pair the two

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:53.619 
download run so we can pair the two
there<00:00:49.850> you<00:00:50.600> have<00:00:50.719> I<00:00:51.500> us<00:00:51.980> they<00:00:52.489> have<00:00:52.730> all<00:00:53.360> the

00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:53.629 
there you have I us they have all the

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:57.220 
there you have I us they have all the
programs<00:00:54.079> a<00:00:54.350> good<00:00:54.890> app<00:00:55.520> store<00:00:55.760> so<00:00:56.329> that<00:00:56.660> was<00:00:57.200> a

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:57.230 
programs a good app store so that was a

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.139 
programs a good app store so that was a
chance<00:00:57.500> to<00:00:57.590> look<00:00:57.680> at<00:00:57.829> them<00:00:58.100> and<00:00:58.430> so<00:00:58.670> well

00:00:59.139 --> 00:00:59.149 
chance to look at them and so well

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:02.380 
chance to look at them and so well
network<00:00:59.480> could<00:00:59.660> get<00:00:59.840> through<00:01:00.020> there<00:01:00.200> it's<00:01:01.390> did

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390 
network could get through there it's did

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.109 
network could get through there it's did
something<00:01:02.629> really<00:01:02.809> obvious<00:01:02.930> they<00:01:03.320> would<00:01:04.119> and

00:01:05.109 --> 00:01:05.119 
something really obvious they would and

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:06.490 
something really obvious they would and
then<00:01:05.330> of<00:01:05.570> course<00:01:05.600> once<00:01:06.020> it<00:01:06.140> gets<00:01:06.259> on<00:01:06.320> your

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:06.500 
then of course once it gets on your

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.550 
then of course once it gets on your
phone<00:01:07.570> if<00:01:08.570> they<00:01:08.720> find<00:01:08.899> out<00:01:08.990> that's<00:01:09.229> bad<00:01:09.410> they

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:09.560 
phone if they find out that's bad they

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.609 
phone if they find out that's bad they
can<00:01:09.680> remotely<00:01:09.860> I<00:01:10.520> mean<00:01:10.910> on<00:01:11.000> the<00:01:11.119> Android<00:01:11.390> side

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:11.619 
can remotely I mean on the Android side

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:14.170 
can remotely I mean on the Android side
you<00:01:12.619> can<00:01:12.770> there<00:01:13.220> is<00:01:13.340> no<00:01:13.490> sort<00:01:13.759> of<00:01:13.789> equivalent

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:14.180 
you can there is no sort of equivalent

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.420 
you can there is no sort of equivalent
to<00:01:14.210> a<00:01:14.270> short<00:01:14.600> there's<00:01:14.899> a<00:01:15.020> native<00:01:16.009> marketplace

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 
to a short there's a native marketplace

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.260 
to a short there's a native marketplace
but<00:01:16.729> there<00:01:17.270> anyone<00:01:18.170> can<00:01:18.320> put<00:01:18.440> it<00:01:18.530> in<00:01:18.649> and

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:19.270 
but there anyone can put it in and

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:21.130 
but there anyone can put it in and
doesn't<00:01:20.270> get<00:01:20.330> check<00:01:20.510> for<00:01:20.630> anything<00:01:20.780> like<00:01:20.930> that

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140 
doesn't get check for anything like that

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.710 
doesn't get check for anything like that
it's<00:01:21.590> sort<00:01:21.830> of<00:01:21.860> a<00:01:21.950> more<00:01:22.100> open<00:01:22.130> environment<00:01:22.720> the

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:23.720 
it's sort of a more open environment the

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:24.910 
it's sort of a more open environment the
problem<00:01:23.990> with<00:01:24.080> that<00:01:24.110> is<00:01:24.439> that<00:01:24.470> it's<00:01:24.710> easy<00:01:24.830> to

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920 
problem with that is that it's easy to

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.929 
problem with that is that it's easy to
put<00:01:25.070> malware<00:01:25.220> there<00:01:27.280> we've<00:01:28.280> seen<00:01:28.430> that<00:01:28.580> too<00:01:28.760> so

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:28.939 
put malware there we've seen that too so

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:31.030 
put malware there we've seen that too so
that<00:01:29.060> we've<00:01:29.150> seen<00:01:29.330> cases<00:01:29.570> of<00:01:29.890> Android<00:01:30.890> malware

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:31.040 
that we've seen cases of Android malware

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.100 
that we've seen cases of Android malware
and<00:01:31.670> not<00:01:31.820> so<00:01:32.030> much<00:01:32.180> you<00:01:32.479> know<00:01:32.570> maybe<00:01:32.720> more<00:01:32.869> to

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.110 
and not so much you know maybe more to

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.630 
and not so much you know maybe more to
iOS<00:01:33.950> ones<00:01:34.189> than<00:01:34.400> even<00:01:34.580> those<00:01:34.670> were<00:01:34.880> sort<00:01:35.030> of<00:01:36.640> so

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 
iOS ones than even those were sort of so

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.480 
iOS ones than even those were sort of so
now<00:01:37.880> we're<00:01:38.060> arena<00:01:38.619> iOS<00:01:39.619> has<00:01:39.920> a<00:01:39.979> big<00:01:40.159> images

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
now we're arena iOS has a big images

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.319 
now we're arena iOS has a big images
because<00:01:40.729> there's<00:01:40.880> so<00:01:41.000> much<00:01:41.150> more<00:01:41.420> control

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:43.329 
because there's so much more control

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:47.710 
because there's so much more control
with<00:01:44.329> control<00:01:44.720> comes<00:01:44.900> security<00:01:45.320> I<00:01:45.350> guess<00:01:46.720> so

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
with control comes security I guess so

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.020 
with control comes security I guess so
are<00:01:47.869> you<00:01:48.049> seeing<00:01:48.680> more<00:01:49.310> malware<00:01:49.729> on<00:01:49.909> the

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
are you seeing more malware on the

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:51.520 
are you seeing more malware on the
jailbroken<00:01:50.479> phones<00:01:50.780> when<00:01:51.170> people<00:01:51.439> are

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
jailbroken phones when people are

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:53.319 
jailbroken phones when people are
pulling<00:01:51.710> it<00:01:51.860> from<00:01:51.979> unauthorized<00:01:52.220> stores<00:01:52.970> that

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:53.329 
pulling it from unauthorized stores that

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:54.940 
pulling it from unauthorized stores that
kind<00:01:53.509> of<00:01:53.540> thing<00:01:53.689> right<00:01:54.049> so<00:01:54.259> so<00:01:54.560> once<00:01:54.860> you

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
kind of thing right so so once you

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:56.859 
kind of thing right so so once you
jailbreak<00:01:55.189> your<00:01:55.430> phone<00:01:55.490> then<00:01:56.210> everything's

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:56.869 
jailbreak your phone then everything's

00:01:56.869 --> 00:01:58.660 
jailbreak your phone then everything's
out<00:01:56.990> the<00:01:57.110> door<00:01:57.259> so<00:01:57.500> do<00:01:57.619> programs<00:01:58.430> that<00:01:58.549> are

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
out the door so do programs that are

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:00.460 
out the door so do programs that are
from<00:01:58.820> that<00:01:58.880> store<00:01:59.240> so<00:01:59.869> you<00:01:59.899> could<00:02:00.110> see<00:02:00.290> a<00:02:00.320> lot

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:00.470 
from that store so you could see a lot

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:02.139 
from that store so you could see a lot
more<00:02:00.500> malware<00:02:01.070> there<00:02:01.340> but<00:02:01.490> we<00:02:01.579> haven't<00:02:01.759> seen

00:02:02.139 --> 00:02:02.149 
more malware there but we haven't seen

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:04.960 
more malware there but we haven't seen
that<00:02:02.210> so<00:02:03.100> you<00:02:04.100> know<00:02:04.189> just<00:02:04.340> a<00:02:04.490> baggage<00:02:04.790> really

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:04.970 
that so you know just a baggage really

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.399 
that so you know just a baggage really
earnest<00:02:05.240> and<00:02:05.540> mobile<00:02:05.810> stuff<00:02:05.990> so<00:02:06.140> much

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
earnest and mobile stuff so much

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:08.869 
earnest and mobile stuff so much
I<00:02:07.439> think<00:02:07.619> it's<00:02:07.770> gonna<00:02:07.859> change<00:02:07.950> but<00:02:08.429> then<00:02:08.789> the

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
I think it's gonna change but then the

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.880 
I think it's gonna change but then the
other<00:02:09.000> the<00:02:09.269> other<00:02:09.360> way<00:02:09.569> that<00:02:09.869> you<00:02:10.410> can<00:02:10.619> get

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
other the other way that you can get

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.770 
other the other way that you can get
code<00:02:11.099> onto<00:02:11.340> a<00:02:11.550> phone<00:02:11.730> as<00:02:11.970> a<00:02:12.000> bad<00:02:12.180> guy<00:02:12.330> is<00:02:12.569> to

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
code onto a phone as a bad guy is to

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:18.770 
code onto a phone as a bad guy is to
just<00:02:12.959> have<00:02:13.170> an<00:02:13.260> X<00:02:13.410> plane<00:02:16.310> so<00:02:17.310> there<00:02:18.030> again<00:02:18.330> iOS

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
just have an X plane so there again iOS

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.289 
just have an X plane so there again iOS
is<00:02:18.870> much<00:02:19.049> stronger<00:02:19.260> so<00:02:19.680> the<00:02:20.670> big<00:02:20.819> protections

00:02:21.289 --> 00:02:21.299 
is much stronger so the big protections

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:23.539 
is much stronger so the big protections
there<00:02:21.510> are<00:02:21.840> a<00:02:22.019> large<00:02:22.379> depth<00:02:22.620> of<00:02:22.860> memorization

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:23.549 
there are a large depth of memorization

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:26.650 
there are a large depth of memorization
and<00:02:24.209> differentiate<00:02:25.140> between<00:02:25.260> code<00:02:25.590> data<00:02:25.860> and

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
and differentiate between code data and

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.759 
and differentiate between code data and
Android<00:02:27.660> doesn't<00:02:27.840> do<00:02:27.959> that<00:02:28.080> at<00:02:28.230> all<00:02:28.349> it

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:28.769 
Android doesn't do that at all it

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:31.039 
Android doesn't do that at all it
basically<00:02:29.010> all<00:02:29.540> that's<00:02:30.540> not<00:02:30.780> my<00:02:30.870> memory

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:31.049 
basically all that's not my memory

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:33.470 
basically all that's not my memory
systems<00:02:31.379> have<00:02:31.530> done<00:02:31.650> that<00:02:31.769> for<00:02:31.920> a<00:02:31.980> while<00:02:32.480> and

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
systems have done that for a while and

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.220 
systems have done that for a while and
then<00:02:33.780> iOS<00:02:34.530> does<00:02:35.459> may<00:02:35.640> assign<00:02:35.879> them<00:02:36.150> so<00:02:36.390> so<00:02:36.810> it's

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
then iOS does may assign them so so it's

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:42.229 
then iOS does may assign them so so it's
a<00:02:37.560> lot<00:02:37.709> harder<00:02:37.860> right<00:02:38.099> next<00:02:38.310> please

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:44.180 

then<00:02:42.690> the<00:02:42.810> final<00:02:42.930> thing<00:02:43.140> is<00:02:43.200> sandboxing<00:02:43.829> so

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
then the final thing is sandboxing so

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.729 
then the final thing is sandboxing so
they<00:02:45.150> both<00:02:45.269> have<00:02:45.329> sandbox<00:02:45.840> models<00:02:46.200> they're

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
they both have sandbox models they're

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:50.240 
they both have sandbox models they're
different<00:02:47.180> the<00:02:48.379> iOS<00:02:49.379> one<00:02:49.590> there's<00:02:50.190> one

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
different the iOS one there's one

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:51.979 
different the iOS one there's one
sandbox<00:02:50.819> for<00:02:51.000> all<00:02:51.180> the<00:02:51.480> apps<00:02:51.660> from<00:02:51.780> the<00:02:51.870> App

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
sandbox for all the apps from the App

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:54.460 
sandbox for all the apps from the App
Store<00:02:52.019> they<00:02:52.349> all<00:02:52.440> have<00:02:52.620> the<00:02:52.920> same<00:02:52.950> sandbox<00:02:53.340> so

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
Store they all have the same sandbox so

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.080 
Store they all have the same sandbox so
the<00:02:55.470> bad<00:02:55.620> news<00:02:55.650> is<00:02:55.980> that<00:02:56.010> the<00:02:56.459> sandbox<00:02:56.760> gonna

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
the bad news is that the sandbox gonna

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.220 
the bad news is that the sandbox gonna
be<00:02:57.150> as<00:02:57.209> strong<00:02:57.299> as<00:02:57.629> sort<00:02:57.810> of<00:02:59.959> running<00:03:00.959> Android

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
be as strong as sort of running Android

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.400 
be as strong as sort of running Android
side<00:03:01.440> they<00:03:01.650> have<00:03:01.829> the<00:03:02.540> custom<00:03:03.540> Sam<00:03:03.989> boxes

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
side they have the custom Sam boxes

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.289 
side they have the custom Sam boxes
where<00:03:04.650> you<00:03:04.799> each<00:03:05.190> ant<00:03:05.430> has<00:03:05.640> asked<00:03:05.970> for<00:03:06.030> what

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:06.299 
where you each ant has asked for what

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:08.089 
where you each ant has asked for what
permissions<00:03:06.870> it<00:03:07.140> needs<00:03:07.319> you<00:03:07.680> can<00:03:07.890> prove<00:03:08.069> that

00:03:08.089 --> 00:03:08.099 
permissions it needs you can prove that

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:10.520 
permissions it needs you can prove that
and<00:03:08.700> so<00:03:09.180> there<00:03:09.390> you<00:03:09.569> get<00:03:09.690> the<00:03:09.810> sandbox<00:03:10.200> is<00:03:10.290> a

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
and so there you get the sandbox is a

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.039 
and so there you get the sandbox is a
lot<00:03:10.680> tighter<00:03:10.920> because<00:03:11.459> it's<00:03:11.700> Burnap<00:03:12.299> the<00:03:12.900> bad

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:13.049 
lot tighter because it's Burnap the bad

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:14.539 
lot tighter because it's Burnap the bad
news<00:03:13.260> is<00:03:13.440> then<00:03:13.620> you're<00:03:13.889> back<00:03:14.010> to<00:03:14.340> the

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:14.549 
news is then you're back to the

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:16.129 
news is then you're back to the
situation<00:03:14.760> where<00:03:15.150> users<00:03:15.450> are<00:03:15.630> sort<00:03:15.870> of<00:03:15.930> in

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:16.139 
situation where users are sort of in

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:18.050 
situation where users are sort of in
charge<00:03:16.170> of<00:03:16.530> their<00:03:16.620> own<00:03:16.709> security<00:03:17.069> and<00:03:17.370> we've

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
charge of their own security and we've

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:19.039 
charge of their own security and we've
seen<00:03:18.269> that<00:03:18.420> that<00:03:18.510> doesn't<00:03:18.660> really<00:03:18.870> work<00:03:19.019> very

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:19.049 
seen that that doesn't really work very

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:19.370 
seen that that doesn't really work very
well

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
well

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.830 
well
no<00:03:19.620> abuser<00:03:20.459> really<00:03:20.670> wants<00:03:20.910> to<00:03:20.940> download<00:03:21.540> some

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
no abuser really wants to download some

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.270 
no abuser really wants to download some
stupid<00:03:22.139> app<00:03:22.260> and<00:03:22.530> it<00:03:22.590> says<00:03:22.799> it<00:03:22.980> needs<00:03:23.160> the

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
stupid app and it says it needs the

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.640 
stupid app and it says it needs the
Internet<00:03:23.549> and<00:03:23.730> sending<00:03:24.660> text<00:03:24.930> messages<00:03:25.049> a<00:03:25.620> lot

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
Internet and sending text messages a lot

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:26.690 
Internet and sending text messages a lot
of<00:03:25.859> times<00:03:25.980> we're<00:03:26.069> going<00:03:26.160> to<00:03:26.220> say<00:03:26.310> yes<00:03:26.489> just

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
of times we're going to say yes just

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.640 
of times we're going to say yes just
because<00:03:26.819> they<00:03:26.970> really<00:03:27.180> want<00:03:27.299> the<00:03:27.359> app<00:03:27.500> is<00:03:28.500> not

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
because they really want the app is not

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.589 
because they really want the app is not
good<00:03:29.190> it's<00:03:29.669> nothing's<00:03:30.000> changed

00:03:30.589 --> 00:03:30.599 
good it's nothing's changed

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:32.360 
good it's nothing's changed
right<00:03:30.840> right<00:03:31.049> so<00:03:31.319> so<00:03:31.590> android<00:03:31.919> relies<00:03:32.250> a<00:03:32.280> lot

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
right right so so android relies a lot

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.309 
right right so so android relies a lot
on<00:03:32.459> the<00:03:32.669> user<00:03:32.819> and<00:03:32.970> the<00:03:33.239> community<00:03:33.630> to<00:03:33.959> enforce

00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:34.319 
on the user and the community to enforce

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:36.199 
on the user and the community to enforce
their<00:03:34.470> security<00:03:34.919> an<00:03:35.519> apple<00:03:35.880> just<00:03:36.000> is<00:03:36.180> like

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
their security an apple just is like

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:38.780 
their security an apple just is like
from<00:03:36.930> the<00:03:37.049> top<00:03:37.260> down<00:03:37.530> smash<00:03:38.130> down<00:03:38.370> security

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
from the top down smash down security

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:45.050 
from the top down smash down security
and<00:03:39.090> so<00:03:40.340> it's<00:03:41.340> less<00:03:41.489> open<00:03:41.880> but<00:03:42.120> then<00:03:42.329> you<00:03:42.810> know

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.090 

cool<00:03:46.060> all<00:03:47.020> right<00:03:47.170> dr.<00:03:47.590> Miller<00:03:47.740> we<00:03:47.860> really

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:48.100 
cool all right dr. Miller we really

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:51.930 
cool all right dr. Miller we really
appreciate<00:03:48.460> it<00:03:48.580> thank<00:03:49.090> you<00:03:49.150> all<00:03:49.810> right
