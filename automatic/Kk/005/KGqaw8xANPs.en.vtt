but I think it's I don't know maybe it's

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.150 
but I think it's I don't know maybe it's
likely<00:02:29.940> maybe<00:02:30.150> it's<00:02:30.330> unlikely<00:02:30.660> you<00:02:31.440> know<00:02:31.590> we

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
likely maybe it's unlikely you know we

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.920 
likely maybe it's unlikely you know we
just<00:02:32.190> can't<00:02:32.580> say<00:02:32.790> anything<00:02:33.000> for<00:02:33.180> sure<00:02:33.360> now<00:02:33.690> you
