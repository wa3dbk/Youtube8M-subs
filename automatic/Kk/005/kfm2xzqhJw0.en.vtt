00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.589
 today on the domestic floor market 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:05.609
 Coatings are presented not only 

00:00:03.589 --> 00:00:09.150
 high-quality Russian and European 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:11.670
 product samples from china which are 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.849
 Unfortunately often leaves much to be desired 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.440
 but also sometimes tries 

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:18.680
 mimic under European 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.680
 manufacturers 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:25.010
 palm in production 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.690
 The laminate belongs to a Swedish company 1 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:29.240
 it was she in the late seventies was 

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:31.880
 hp and technology based 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:35.630
 chipboard with locking connection spike groove and 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:37.520
 using glue 1979 ege for the first time 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:40.730
 demonstrated laminated flooring 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.800
 1991 to the general public first was 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:45.170
 the only one who showed his 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.850
 products at the exhibition domotex in Germany 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:49.070
 one year later laminated floors 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:51.140
 introduced them to the company after six 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.580
 For years, the exhibition occupied a whole pavilion 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.530
 the next step was the union 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:57.230
 manufacturers in the european association 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.210
 and pff in parallel there is a need 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:01.670
 creating uniform evaluation criteria 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.050
 qualities therefore pff together with 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:07.040
 European Committee for Standardization 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:08.720
 was seen standard n 13 329 so 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.330
 there was a clear classification in 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.500
 depending on operation modes 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:15.860
 identified two areas of use 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:19.160
 household laminate from 21 to 23 class and 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:21.040
 commercial 31 to 34 resistance to 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.910
 abrasion ultraviolet radiation 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.950
 moisture resistance resistance to 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:27.020
 spotting and scratching emissions 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.060
 formaldehyde test scores 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.160
 who pass laminate before 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.350
 get on the market so evolved in europe 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:35.330
 The Institute of Regulation in China 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.280
 so there are no manufacturers 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.530
 class which is written on packages not 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.420
 always true 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.979
 as a rule, these products 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.720
 characterized by 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:46.550
 mismatch wear resistance class 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:48.619
 loose MDF plate brittle soaked 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:50.690
 connection and what's important and 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:52.000
 matching class and and 1 that is 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:53.810
 high formaldehyde emission 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.030
 manufacturers are trying hard 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.459
 hide the origin of this laminate 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.660
 and adjust it to the European also 

00:01:58.459 --> 00:02:01.819
 flooring manufacturers 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:03.740
 brand owners can reflect on 

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:05.660
 packaging any non - existent 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.090
 standard or accompany your products 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:10.930
 certificate with incorrect data to 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:14.450
 example to us down 14 figs from 

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:15.680
 Russian-made product where 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.080
 it was stated that it is produced in 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.940
 Germany and even given the address where it is 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.250
 produced by google maps we 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.630
 tried to find this factory but we are nothing 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.730
 not found because this address 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.349
 just there is no situation 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.329
 aggravated by the fact that in Russia so far 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:31.390
 no state accepted on laminated 

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:34.810
 coverage so the buyer is bigger 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:37.569
 We are not protected laminate in Russia 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:40.840
 more than 10-15 years on the market 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:42.340
 but would still operate only guests 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.670
 80s 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:47.740
 parquet boards parquet parquet 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.090
 piece of course nobody forbids 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:50.950
 conduct compliance tests 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.780
 European standard if in 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.250
 the lab is his translation and 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:56.140
 related equipment 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.900
 but in any case it is not done for 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:01.230
 certificates namely to see 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:04.420
 the quality of the material at the moment 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:06.880
 you can certify laminate either by 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:10.350
 declarations the manufacturer declares 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:13.510
 some indicators and certification authority 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:14.200
 just notarizing or writing technical 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.750
 conditions 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.610
 and then highly praised directly by 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.470
 specifications in order not to 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:22.660
 make mistakes when buying need to be 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:25.870
 as armed as possible 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:28.600
 the first must be present 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.910
 second language site 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.680
 information about this manufacturer 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:35.019
 must be present on other sites 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:37.320
 countries of the manufacturer also any point 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:39.640
 Buyer sales can get 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:41.950
 top top is the declaration of characteristics 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:43.900
 quality in this declaration manufacturer 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:45.549
 prescribes that this product 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:48.280
 meets all European standards 

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:50.049
 production can also always go to 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.299
 official website of the European Association 

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:54.850
 belov and see if the given 

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:56.739
 plant manufacturer in the composition of this 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:58.810
 associations are better to acquire yet 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:00.730
 flooring in certified 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:03.360
 authorized points of sale thereby 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:05.670
 the client once again protect themselves from 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:08.680
 purchase of substandard products 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:10.209
 sometimes dangerous in the end even with 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.430
 being late in Russia occurs 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:14.079
 updating of national standards with 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:16.359
 European in July of this year 

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:19.799
 finally will gost on laminate for 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:21.940
 consumers it will increase significantly 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:26.560
 security at the moment if 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:29.080
 someone happens to the laminate then even 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:30.789
 testing centers and expert 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:34.600
 organizations can do nothing 

00:04:30.789 --> 00:04:36.789
 because there are no evaluation criteria and the most 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:38.289
 The main thing is interested in the subject of purchase 

00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:40.330
 try to figure out what you are 

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:42.490
 don't rely on me 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:44.169
 And the seller, it is of course important, but it happens 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:46.120
 which is also a premium class salon 

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:47.889
 box labeled made in Germany and 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:49.780
 Belgium or Italy sell goods 

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:52.030
 produced in small factories in 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:54.430
 China may have this product and quite good 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:58.710
 qualities you get a cat in a bag and 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:58.710
 for the money that this code is not worth
