00:01:23.279 --> 00:01:23.289 
decoder in the receiver the output was

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:25.050 
decoder in the receiver the output was
literally<00:01:23.619> a<00:01:23.740> servo<00:01:24.069> pulse<00:01:24.369> so<00:01:24.640> it<00:01:24.729> just<00:01:24.880> drove

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:25.060 
literally a servo pulse so it just drove

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.499 
literally a servo pulse so it just drove
