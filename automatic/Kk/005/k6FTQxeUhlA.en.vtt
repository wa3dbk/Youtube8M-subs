these guns I think they are not in the

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:11.690 
these guns I think they are not in the
game<00:00:10.230> code<00:00:10.469> but<00:00:10.710> these<00:00:10.889> ones<00:00:11.099> are<00:00:11.219> just<00:00:11.519> from

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
game code but these ones are just from

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.850 
game code but these ones are just from
what<00:00:11.910> someone<00:00:12.269> tested<00:00:12.750> in<00:00:12.900> game<00:00:13.110> they<00:00:13.679> did

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860

people so if we're looking at the ak-12

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.080 
people so if we're looking at the ak-12
it<00:00:19.710> takes<00:00:19.890> three<00:00:20.160> to<00:00:20.279> four<00:00:20.490> bullets<00:00:20.910> to<00:00:21.060> kill

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
ak-12 has a circular iron site whereas

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.530 
ak-12 has a circular iron site whereas
every<00:01:04.769> other<00:01:04.890> variation<00:01:05.670> of<00:01:05.790> it<00:01:05.880> has<00:01:06.060> a<00:01:06.090> you

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
iron site and that you iron site I find

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.030 
iron site and that you iron site I find
actually<00:01:09.240> performs<00:01:09.900> a<00:01:10.020> lot<00:01:10.290> better<00:01:10.590> than<00:01:10.920> that

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
actually performs a lot better than that

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.920 
actually performs a lot better than that
circular<00:01:11.610> iron<00:01:11.790> site<00:01:12.119> you<00:01:12.270> have<00:01:12.450> on<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.720> base

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
circular iron site you have on the base

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.260 
circular iron site you have on the base
gun<00:01:13.229> so<00:01:13.619> if<00:01:13.710> you<00:01:13.830> have<00:01:14.040> any<00:01:14.220> variations<00:01:14.880> for

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
gun so if you have any variations for

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.899 
gun so if you have any variations for
this<00:01:15.450> gun<00:01:15.630> I<00:01:15.810> highly<00:01:16.229> suggest<00:01:16.409> using<00:01:16.830> them<00:01:17.100> the

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
this gun I highly suggest using them the

this gun I highly suggest using them the
version<00:01:18.119> I<00:01:18.360> use<00:01:18.600> is<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:18.930> ak-12<00:01:19.229> Lance<00:01:19.619> but

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
version I use is the ak-12 Lance but

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:20.660 
version I use is the ak-12 Lance but
we're<00:01:19.920> going<00:01:20.009> to<00:01:20.100> talk<00:01:20.220> about<00:01:20.340> that<00:01:20.549> in<00:01:20.640> a

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.850 
mobility is a 12 so if you ask me I
think<00:01:31.950> that<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:33.110> accuracy<00:01:34.110> and<00:01:34.229> range<00:01:34.500> are

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
think that the accuracy and range are

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.649 
think that the accuracy and range are
actually<00:01:35.670> a<00:01:35.700> little<00:01:35.820> bit<00:01:36.000> low<00:01:36.270> i<00:01:36.299> think

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
actually a little bit low i think

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:37.609 
actually a little bit low i think
they're<00:01:36.780> a<00:01:36.810> little<00:01:36.869> bit<00:01:37.110> better<00:01:37.229> than<00:01:37.500> that

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
they're a little bit better than that

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.219 
they're a little bit better than that
just<00:01:38.040> comparing<00:01:38.400> it<00:01:38.579> to<00:01:38.610> other<00:01:38.700> guns<00:01:39.229> aside

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
just comparing it to other guns aside

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.499 
just comparing it to other guns aside
from<00:01:40.350> that<00:01:40.439> though<00:01:40.770> i<00:01:40.950> use<00:01:40.979> the<00:01:41.310> ak-12<00:01:41.880> lance

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
from that though i use the ak-12 lance

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.510 
from that though i use the ak-12 lance
which<00:01:43.290> the<00:01:43.439> only<00:01:43.649> difference<00:01:43.950> between<00:01:44.070> that

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
which the only difference between that

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.310 
which the only difference between that
and<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:44.790> regular<00:01:45.030> version<00:01:45.060> it's<00:01:45.780> plus<00:01:46.079> 2

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
and the regular version it's plus 2

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.800 
and the regular version it's plus 2
range<00:01:46.649> minus<00:01:47.369> 1<00:01:47.700> handling<00:01:48.149> and<00:01:48.329> you<00:01:48.420> can't<00:01:48.659> use

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
range minus 1 handling and you can't use

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.270 
range minus 1 handling and you can't use
any<00:01:48.960> under<00:01:49.320> attachment<00:01:49.740> so<00:01:49.829> that's<00:01:49.979> include

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
any under attachment so that's include

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.190 
any under attachment so that's include
suppressor<00:01:50.850> for<00:01:51.210> grip<00:01:51.479> anything<00:01:51.990> like<00:01:52.170> that

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
suppressor for grip anything like that

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.980 
suppressor for grip anything like that
you<00:01:52.829> can't<00:01:53.040> use<00:01:53.250> any<00:01:53.549> of<00:01:53.729> those<00:01:54.000> which<00:01:54.540> is<00:01:54.720> fine

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
you can't use any of those which is fine

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.840 
you can't use any of those which is fine
because<00:01:55.170> I<00:01:55.380> find<00:01:55.619> with<00:01:55.770> this<00:01:55.950> gun<00:01:56.189> you're

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
because I find with this gun you're

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.399 
because I find with this gun you're
handling<00:01:57.210> goes<00:01:57.479> down<00:01:57.780> which<00:01:58.020> is<00:01:58.049> fine<00:01:58.380> you

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
handling goes down which is fine you

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.830 
handling goes down which is fine you
move<00:01:58.680> around<00:01:58.920> a<00:01:59.130> little<00:01:59.250> bit<00:01:59.490> slower<00:01:59.909> it's<00:02:00.750> a

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
move around a little bit slower it's a

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.319 
move around a little bit slower it's a
little<00:02:00.990> bit<00:02:01.200> harder<00:02:01.979> to<00:02:02.250> manage<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:02.939> recoil

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
little bit harder to manage the recoil

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.690 
little bit harder to manage the recoil
but<00:02:04.049> at<00:02:04.350> the<00:02:04.710> same<00:02:04.890> time<00:02:05.100> this<00:02:05.250> gun<00:02:05.399> already

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
but at the same time this gun already

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.670 
but at the same time this gun already
has<00:02:05.850> so<00:02:06.149> much<00:02:06.299> recoil<00:02:06.689> and<00:02:06.930> you're<00:02:07.049> only<00:02:07.290> using

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
has so much recoil and you're only using

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.650 
has so much recoil and you're only using
it<00:02:07.950> at<00:02:08.099> long<00:02:08.310> range<00:02:08.550> engagements<00:02:08.729> which<00:02:09.360> means

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
it at long range engagements which means

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.270 
it at long range engagements which means
those<00:02:09.959> two<00:02:10.200> things<00:02:10.410> don't<00:02:10.830> really<00:02:11.099> matter

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
those two things don't really matter

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.090 
those two things don't really matter
that<00:02:11.400> much<00:02:11.580> anyway

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
that much anyway

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:14.860 
that much anyway
the<00:02:13.580> no<00:02:13.670> attachment<00:02:14.150> thing<00:02:14.240> is<00:02:14.390> just<00:02:14.510> kind<00:02:14.780> of

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
the no attachment thing is just kind of

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:16.840 
the no attachment thing is just kind of
I'm<00:02:15.110> fine<00:02:15.350> with<00:02:15.560> it<00:02:15.680> has<00:02:15.830> very<00:02:16.130> very<00:02:16.430> good<00:02:16.610> iron

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.850 
I'm fine with it has very very good iron

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:19.540 
I'm fine with it has very very good iron
sights<00:02:17.270> so<00:02:18.140> I<00:02:18.170> don't<00:02:18.470> even<00:02:18.530> use<00:02:18.950> one<00:02:19.310> of<00:02:19.340> those

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550 
sights so I don't even use one of those

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:21.910 
sights so I don't even use one of those
attachments<00:02:19.940> even<00:02:20.390> though<00:02:20.480> you<00:02:20.540> can<00:02:20.870> so<00:02:21.740> when

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
attachments even though you can so when

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.860 
attachments even though you can so when
my<00:02:22.040> class<00:02:22.250> is<00:02:22.490> set<00:02:22.670> up<00:02:22.790> I<00:02:22.940> kind<00:02:23.240> of<00:02:23.390> don't<00:02:23.630> even

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
my class is set up I kind of don't even

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.070 
my class is set up I kind of don't even
use<00:02:24.140> any<00:02:24.380> attachments<00:02:24.980> so<00:02:25.550> um<00:02:25.940> if<00:02:26.570> you<00:02:26.780> are

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
use any attachments so um if you are

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.660 
use any attachments so um if you are
using<00:02:27.470> the<00:02:27.710> base<00:02:27.890> version<00:02:28.130> of<00:02:28.340> it<00:02:28.430> though<00:02:28.550> and

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
using the base version of it though and

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.610 
using the base version of it though and
you<00:02:28.760> can<00:02:29.000> use<00:02:29.270> attachments<00:02:29.870> I<00:02:29.960> highly<00:02:30.410> suggest

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
you can use attachments I highly suggest

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.120 
you can use attachments I highly suggest
using<00:02:31.190> the<00:02:31.430> foregrip<00:02:31.850> and<00:02:32.060> that's<00:02:32.390> it<00:02:32.690> or<00:02:33.020> a

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
using the foregrip and that's it or a

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:36.910 
using the foregrip and that's it or a
stock<00:02:34.130> if<00:02:34.430> you<00:02:34.790> really<00:02:35.420> like<00:02:35.720> strafing<00:02:36.380> which

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
stock if you really like strafing which

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.860 
stock if you really like strafing which
I<00:02:37.040> do<00:02:37.100> so<00:02:37.430> when<00:02:37.760> i'm<00:02:37.850> using<00:02:38.180> the<00:02:38.240> base<00:02:38.420> gun<00:02:38.660> i

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
I do so when i'm using the base gun i

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.410 
I do so when i'm using the base gun i
use<00:02:39.050> for<00:02:39.350> grip<00:02:39.530> stock<00:02:39.950> when<00:02:40.580> i'm<00:02:40.670> using<00:02:41.060> the

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
use for grip stock when i'm using the

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.070

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
ak-12 lance i just use that base gun and

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.020 
ak-12 lance i just use that base gun and
then<00:02:45.200> i<00:02:45.260> can<00:02:45.470> put<00:02:45.920> on<00:02:46.040> extra<00:02:46.370> perks<00:02:46.670> extra
