00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.519
 hello everyone today i'll be back by just 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:10.710
 sandblasting the past video that created 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.349
 by sandblasting we got the probability 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:16.740
 unsuccessfully therefore will have a little bit of it 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.869
 redo the matter is that I wanted to write 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.939
 that the sand was important that the guys did not 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.699
 treat it 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:27.150
 sand blasting u like sand blasting by sweeping 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.710
 full body performance 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.710
 compressor by itself. 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:36.180
 but I am not intended for such purposes as 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:39.090
 This is understood so I want more 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.770
 chew and show what it means 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.550
 so let's get started in order 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:48.500
 the compressor that stands behind me 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:51.750
 420 liters manufacturer hose diameter 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:54.989
 20 millimeters unlike which 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:58.510
 there will be a hose length of 10 meters in contrast 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:01.680
 from what was there 25 years 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:04.720
 diameter of the nozzle families remained the same 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:07.689
 river sand 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:12.009
 difference from being career dry in 

00:01:07.689 --> 00:01:14.890
 difference in one I think in detail 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:17.490
 told everything like that 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:20.759
 picture oil. we will build 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:23.049
 the inner part of the arch 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.000
 now I actually like and 

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:28.420
 cast no need i do this video for 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.000
 so that you understand what is here 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:33.550
 such a sand blasting and compressor 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.770
 capacity 420 liters for 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:38.350
 normal sandblasting to sandblast 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:42.460
 do business 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:44.340
 sandblasted castes whole bodies for 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.420
 this is necessary but at least 3000 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:50.020
 compressor capacity per liter 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:52.929
 to have 35 thousand nozzle diameter 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:55.830
 Well, two centimeters when you have and 

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:59.350
 the pawn is worth it with sand naturally 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:01.209
 special abrasive okay for that 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.099
 so that sand builds we must necessarily 

00:02:01.209 --> 00:02:05.890
 protect your respiratory system 

00:02:03.099 --> 00:02:11.200
 at least such a mask because dust 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:14.319
 settles in the lungs it is very dangerous light 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:17.530
 I'll show you the video later where I shot 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:23.670
 blunt which forms the process of having 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:23.670
 when you master the grinder putty 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:34.319
 Well, so it turns out the mask and communication with 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:38.250
 so that I have no special 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:41.090
 costume special mask i will be all this 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.090
 stir up on the go 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:57.780
 defended his bald head 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:20.870
 something so the camera must be removed away 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.870
 on the zoom set 

00:04:31.349 --> 00:04:44.590
 what do you think I'm a batman or sort 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:51.639
 Here is such a primitive protection but she 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:53.650
 relieve you of great discomfort and well 

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:56.639
 as if all good luck 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:56.639
 to new meetings 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:00.750
 but
