brown original I was originally afraid
to<00:00:12.030> this<00:00:12.120> matchup<00:00:12.360> a<00:00:12.630> lot<00:00:12.870> because<00:00:13.110> Brown

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
to this matchup a lot because Brown

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.010 
to this matchup a lot because Brown
really<00:00:13.980> counters<00:00:14.400> green<00:00:14.700> well<00:00:14.910> um<00:00:15.540> so

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
really counters green well um so

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.080 
really counters green well um so
hopefully<00:00:16.170> I'll<00:00:16.529> be<00:00:16.560> able<00:00:16.859> to<00:00:17.160> outplay<00:00:18.000> him

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
hopefully I'll be able to outplay him

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.630 
hopefully I'll be able to outplay him
and<00:00:18.539> win<00:00:18.810> so<00:00:19.500> he<00:00:19.770> leaves<00:00:19.949> with<00:00:20.070> Heatran<00:00:20.460> I<00:00:20.490> do

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
and win so he leaves with Heatran I do

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.070 
and win so he leaves with Heatran I do
with<00:00:20.760> Tyranitar<00:00:21.390> I'm<00:00:21.510> kind<00:00:21.840> of<00:00:21.900> thinking

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
with Tyranitar I'm kind of thinking

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.450 
with Tyranitar I'm kind of thinking
he'll<00:00:22.439> either<00:00:22.619> tone<00:00:22.859> or<00:00:23.010> set<00:00:23.130> up<00:00:23.189> stealth

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
he'll either tone or set up stealth

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.670 
he'll either tone or set up stealth
rocks<00:00:23.699> I<00:00:23.880> decided<00:00:24.180> just<00:00:24.269> to<00:00:24.480> set<00:00:24.779> up<00:00:24.900> just<00:00:25.560> go

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
rocks I decided just to set up just go

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.349 
rocks I decided just to set up just go
for<00:00:25.830> the<00:00:25.890> earthquake<00:00:26.279> he<00:00:26.789> ends<00:00:26.939> up<00:00:27.000> having<00:00:27.150> to

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
for the earthquake he ends up having to

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:28.519 
for the earthquake he ends up having to
shuck<00:00:27.570> a<00:00:27.599> berry<00:00:27.869> which<00:00:28.050> kind<00:00:28.260> of<00:00:28.320> sucks

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
shuck a berry which kind of sucks

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.080 
shuck a berry which kind of sucks
because<00:00:28.710> I'm<00:00:28.859> not<00:00:28.980> able<00:00:29.160> to<00:00:29.310> kill<00:00:29.490> him<00:00:29.609> but

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
because I'm not able to kill him but

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.120 
because I'm not able to kill him but
then<00:00:30.210> he<00:00:30.240> just<00:00:30.300> explodes<00:00:30.900> and<00:00:31.199> I<00:00:31.529> resist<00:00:31.890> that

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
then he just explodes and I resist that

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.459 
then he just explodes and I resist that
but<00:00:32.489> it<00:00:32.610> still<00:00:32.759> does<00:00:32.880> a<00:00:32.910> lot<00:00:33.030> of<00:00:33.090> damage<00:00:33.469> it's

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
but it still does a lot of damage it's

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:35.630 
but it still does a lot of damage it's
still<00:00:34.620> pretty<00:00:34.739> good<00:00:34.980> for<00:00:35.160> me<00:00:35.280> though<00:00:35.460> because

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
still pretty good for me though because

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.709 
still pretty good for me though because
his<00:00:36.600> his<00:00:37.230> lead<00:00:37.440> is<00:00:37.649> dead<00:00:37.920> and<00:00:38.190> I<00:00:38.820> have<00:00:39.149> a<00:00:39.420> half

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
his his lead is dead and I have a half

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.900 
his his lead is dead and I have a half
health<00:00:39.960> Tyranitar<00:00:40.620> so<00:00:40.950> it's<00:00:41.219> not<00:00:41.340> quite<00:00:41.610> a<00:00:41.730> bad

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
health Tyranitar so it's not quite a bad

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.630 
health Tyranitar so it's not quite a bad
start<00:00:42.210> so<00:00:42.930> he's<00:00:43.379> gonna<00:00:43.530> go<00:00:43.710> out<00:00:43.739> into<00:00:44.040> his

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
start so he's gonna go out into his

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.209 
start so he's gonna go out into his
pincer<00:00:45.090> now<00:00:45.300> and<00:00:45.600> I'm<00:00:45.809> thinking<00:00:46.500> either<00:00:46.649> X's

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
pincer now and I'm thinking either X's

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.430 
pincer now and I'm thinking either X's
or<00:00:47.340> a<00:00:47.430> close-combat<00:00:47.940> so<00:00:48.420> either<00:00:48.629> way<00:00:48.930> I<00:00:48.960> can<00:00:49.320> go

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
or a close-combat so either way I can go

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.680 
or a close-combat so either way I can go
into<00:00:49.559> en<00:00:49.770> mega<00:00:50.129> without<00:00:50.430> too<00:00:50.640> much<00:00:50.789> trouble<00:00:51.000> he

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
into en mega without too much trouble he

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.180 
into en mega without too much trouble he
goes<00:00:51.870> through<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.079> x-scissor<00:00:52.500> and<00:00:52.860> that

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
goes through the x-scissor and that

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.860 
goes through the x-scissor and that
doesn't<00:00:53.520> do<00:00:53.640> much<00:00:53.820> to<00:00:53.879> Yen<00:00:54.149> mega<00:00:54.539> and<00:00:54.690> that's

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
doesn't do much to Yen mega and that's

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.049 
doesn't do much to Yen mega and that's
pretty<00:00:55.050> nice<00:00:55.289> for<00:00:55.500> me<00:00:55.649> I'm<00:00:56.219> just<00:00:56.280> gonna<00:00:56.550> go<00:00:56.760> for

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
pretty nice for me I'm just gonna go for

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.729 
pretty nice for me I'm just gonna go for

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
intimidate and that the inmate doesn't

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.700 
intimidate and that the inmate doesn't
mean<00:01:08.250> anything<00:01:08.580> actually<00:01:08.760> but<00:01:09.320> I'm<00:01:10.320> kind<00:01:10.680> of

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
mean anything actually but I'm kind of

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.469 
mean anything actually but I'm kind of
afraid<00:01:10.920> of<00:01:11.250> a<00:01:11.369> brave<00:01:11.610> bird<00:01:11.850> I<00:01:11.970> decided<00:01:12.240> to<00:01:12.360> go

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
afraid of a brave bird I decided to go

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.080 
afraid of a brave bird I decided to go
for<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:12.869> protect<00:01:13.439> again<00:01:13.830> to<00:01:14.010> see<00:01:14.159> what<00:01:14.280> he<00:01:14.369> do

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
for the protect again to see what he do

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.810 
for the protect again to see what he do
because<00:01:15.390> I<00:01:15.630> don't<00:01:15.840> see<00:01:16.140> leftovers<00:01:16.860> so<00:01:17.700> I'm

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
because I don't see leftovers so I'm

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.999 
because I don't see leftovers so I'm
thinking<00:01:18.119> he's<00:01:18.240> probably<00:01:18.710> banded<00:01:19.710> because

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
thinking he's probably banded because

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.200 
thinking he's probably banded because
most<00:01:20.220> don't<00:01:20.369> Raptors<00:01:20.700> seem<00:01:20.820> to<00:01:20.909> be<00:01:21.000> banned

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
most don't Raptors seem to be banned

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.149 
most don't Raptors seem to be banned

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
but he goes for the brave bird I see and

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.690 
but he goes for the brave bird I see and
I'm<00:01:25.619> just<00:01:25.650> gonna<00:01:25.830> go<00:01:26.009> for<00:01:26.159> the<00:01:26.250> hypnosis

I'm just gonna go for the hypnosis

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.310 
I'm just gonna go for the hypnosis
because<00:01:27.240> I<00:01:27.330> really<00:01:27.570> don't<00:01:27.750> have<00:01:27.810> anything<00:01:28.110> I

because I really don't have anything I

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.620 
because I really don't have anything I

surprisingly<00:02:07.439> but<00:02:07.799> I<00:02:08.160> just<00:02:08.340> go<00:02:08.489> for<00:02:08.640> the<00:02:08.729> air

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
surprisingly but I just go for the air

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.780 
surprisingly but I just go for the air
slash<00:02:09.149> and<00:02:09.420> that's<00:02:09.920> going<00:02:10.920> to<00:02:11.009> be<00:02:11.099> one<00:02:11.520> more

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
slash and that's going to be one more

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.570 
slash and that's going to be one more
like<00:02:12.330> one<00:02:12.480> more<00:02:12.629> turn<00:02:12.810> that's<00:02:12.989> going<00:02:13.170> to<00:02:13.230> be

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
like one more turn that's going to be

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.100 
like one more turn that's going to be
well<00:02:13.940> one<00:02:14.060> more<00:02:14.180> air<00:02:14.300> slasher<00:02:14.660> should<00:02:14.810> be<00:02:14.900> dead

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
well one more air slasher should be dead

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.050 
well one more air slasher should be dead
but<00:02:15.710> instead<00:02:15.920> I<00:02:15.980> go<00:02:16.190> for<00:02:16.340> the<00:02:16.400> protect<00:02:16.760> I<00:02:16.880> don't

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
but instead I go for the protect I don't

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.770 
but instead I go for the protect I don't
really<00:02:17.180> want<00:02:17.390> to<00:02:17.420> get<00:02:17.540> hit<00:02:17.630> with<00:02:17.720> another

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
really want to get hit with another

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.650 
really want to get hit with another
extremely<00:02:18.410> speed<00:02:18.910> so<00:02:19.910> I<00:02:19.940> go<00:02:20.120> forth<00:02:20.270> to<00:02:20.330> protect

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
extremely speed so I go forth to protect

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.220 
extremely speed so I go forth to protect
basically<00:02:21.200> for<00:02:21.530> sandstorm<00:02:22.070> stalling<00:02:22.670> and<00:02:23.230> I'm

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
basically for sandstorm stalling and I'm

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.530 
basically for sandstorm stalling and I'm
doing<00:02:24.530> that<00:02:24.740> just<00:02:24.800> so<00:02:25.580> hopefully<00:02:26.090> his<00:02:26.210> Dragon

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
doing that just so hopefully his Dragon

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:27.610 
doing that just so hopefully his Dragon
Knight<00:02:26.660> will<00:02:26.780> died<00:02:26.930> at<00:02:27.080> the<00:02:27.170> sandstorm

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
Knight will died at the sandstorm

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.130 
Knight will died at the sandstorm
eventually<00:02:28.120> so<00:02:29.120> now<00:02:29.270> I<00:02:29.300> decide<00:02:29.570> to<00:02:29.600> switch<00:02:29.900> I

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
eventually so now I decide to switch I

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:31.990 
eventually so now I decide to switch I
switch<00:02:30.410> here<00:02:30.740> because<00:02:31.490> I<00:02:31.550> don't<00:02:31.640> want<00:02:31.730> to<00:02:31.880> hit

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
switch here because I don't want to hit

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.610 
switch here because I don't want to hit
get<00:02:32.270> hit<00:02:32.420> with<00:02:32.510> another<00:02:32.750> extreme<00:02:33.140> speed<00:02:33.410> so<00:02:33.560> I

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
get hit with another extreme speed so I

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.520 
get hit with another extreme speed so I
go<00:02:33.770> on<00:02:33.800> to<00:02:34.040> bronzong<00:02:34.550> and<00:02:35.260> yeah<00:02:36.260> he<00:02:36.380> goes

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
go on to bronzong and yeah he goes

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.040 
go on to bronzong and yeah he goes
extreme<00:02:36.920> speed<00:02:37.160> that<00:02:37.430> will<00:02:37.880> be<00:02:38.480> resisted<00:02:39.020> by

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.050 
extreme speed that will be resisted by

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.400 
extreme speed that will be resisted by
bronzong<00:02:39.680> and<00:02:40.100> won't<00:02:40.340> do<00:02:40.490> much<00:02:40.730> and<00:02:41.200> one<00:02:42.200> more

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
bronzong and won't do much and one more

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:43.870 
bronzong and won't do much and one more
sandstorm<00:02:42.890> hit<00:02:43.010> that<00:02:43.160> Dragon<00:02:43.460> Knight<00:02:43.550> is<00:02:43.640> dead

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
sandstorm hit that Dragon Knight is dead

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.760 
sandstorm hit that Dragon Knight is dead
so<00:02:44.090> I<00:02:44.120> decide<00:02:44.420> just<00:02:44.900> to<00:02:44.960> set<00:02:45.140> up<00:02:45.230> stealth<00:02:45.470> rocks

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.650 
is dragon it goes down and bronzong
still<00:03:01.220> looking<00:03:01.490> pretty<00:03:01.730> nice<00:03:01.910> and<00:03:02.300> he<00:03:02.510> goes

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
still looking pretty nice and he goes

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.540 
still looking pretty nice and he goes
out<00:03:02.870> into<00:03:03.140> Infernape<00:03:03.890> and<00:03:04.220> I<00:03:04.250> knew<00:03:04.430> we'd

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:04.550 
out into Infernape and I knew we'd

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:06.070 
out into Infernape and I knew we'd
probably<00:03:04.760> have<00:03:05.180> it<00:03:05.360> because<00:03:05.630> Infernape

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.080 
probably have it because Infernape

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.740 
probably have it because Infernape
counters<00:03:06.530> green<00:03:06.890> really<00:03:07.280> well<00:03:07.640> and<00:03:07.970> I<00:03:08.570> just

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
counters green really well and I just

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:09.640 
counters green really well and I just
kind<00:03:08.900> of<00:03:08.930> want<00:03:09.080> to<00:03:09.110> see<00:03:09.290> what<00:03:09.380> kind<00:03:09.590> of

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
kind of want to see what kind of

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:11.890 
kind of want to see what kind of
inferences<00:03:10.220> is<00:03:10.340> if<00:03:10.520> it's<00:03:10.670> scarfed<00:03:11.150> or<00:03:11.660> you

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
inferences is if it's scarfed or you

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.540 
inferences is if it's scarfed or you
know<00:03:12.020> whatever<00:03:12.260> he<00:03:13.010> goes<00:03:13.160> with<00:03:13.310> the<00:03:13.370> fire

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:13.550 
know whatever he goes with the fire

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:16.720 
know whatever he goes with the fire
blasts<00:03:13.820> expectedly<00:03:14.510> and<00:03:15.010> killed<00:03:16.010> my<00:03:16.160> bronzong

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
blasts expectedly and killed my bronzong

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:19.090 
blasts expectedly and killed my bronzong
and<00:03:17.000> i<00:03:17.090> see<00:03:17.300> the<00:03:17.450> life<00:03:17.690> form<00:03:17.989> so<00:03:18.320> now<00:03:18.350> I<00:03:18.620> know<00:03:18.770> he

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.100 
and i see the life form so now I know he

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:20.949 
and i see the life form so now I know he
can<00:03:19.400> change<00:03:19.670> moves<00:03:19.970> but<00:03:20.239> he<00:03:20.330> isn't<00:03:20.480> going<00:03:20.750> to

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959 
can change moves but he isn't going to

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:23.860 
can change moves but he isn't going to
be<00:03:21.110> faster<00:03:21.680> than<00:03:21.860> a<00:03:22.250> lot<00:03:22.970> of<00:03:23.090> my<00:03:23.180> Pokemon<00:03:23.660> so<00:03:23.840> I

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
be faster than a lot of my Pokemon so I

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:25.630 
be faster than a lot of my Pokemon so I
go<00:03:24.050> on<00:03:24.170> to<00:03:24.260> Yen<00:03:24.440> makeup<00:03:24.800> because<00:03:25.040> I<00:03:25.070> know<00:03:25.310> this

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:25.640 
go on to Yen makeup because I know this

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:27.520 
go on to Yen makeup because I know this
isn't<00:03:25.850> scarf<00:03:26.270> I<00:03:26.450> can<00:03:26.600> go<00:03:26.720> for<00:03:26.900> the<00:03:26.989> protect<00:03:27.350> and

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
isn't scarf I can go for the protect and

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:29.620 
isn't scarf I can go for the protect and
then<00:03:27.620> be<00:03:27.830> faster<00:03:28.220> than<00:03:28.340> at<00:03:28.430> next<00:03:28.700> turn<00:03:28.880> he<00:03:29.450> goes

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:29.630 
then be faster than at next turn he goes

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:31.330 
then be faster than at next turn he goes
for<00:03:29.810> the<00:03:29.870> hidden<00:03:30.080> power<00:03:30.290> probably<00:03:30.739> ice<00:03:31.100> I

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
for the hidden power probably ice I

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:32.590 
for the hidden power probably ice I
don't<00:03:31.489> know<00:03:31.610> but<00:03:31.970> it<00:03:32.090> doesn't<00:03:32.270> really<00:03:32.390> matter

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:32.600 
don't know but it doesn't really matter

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.240 
don't know but it doesn't really matter
because<00:03:32.959> now<00:03:33.140> I<00:03:33.170> have<00:03:33.380> this<00:03:33.500> bead<00:03:33.739> boost<00:03:33.980> and

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
because now I have this bead boost and

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:36.250 
because now I have this bead boost and
that<00:03:34.850> means<00:03:35.060> I'm<00:03:35.180> faster<00:03:35.600> and<00:03:35.750> I<00:03:35.780> can<00:03:35.930> try<00:03:36.080> go

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
that means I'm faster and I can try go

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:37.449 
that means I'm faster and I can try go
for<00:03:36.440> the<00:03:36.500> air<00:03:36.620> slash<00:03:36.920> which<00:03:37.130> is<00:03:37.250> super

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:37.459 
for the air slash which is super

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:39.760 
for the air slash which is super
effective<00:03:37.910> so<00:03:38.570> ago<00:03:38.750> that<00:03:38.780> enter<00:03:39.170> star<00:03:39.350> Raptor

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:39.770 
effective so ago that enter star Raptor

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:41.380 
effective so ago that enter star Raptor
here<00:03:40.070> and<00:03:40.250> I<00:03:40.310> go<00:03:40.580> for<00:03:40.730> the<00:03:40.790> air<00:03:40.910> slash<00:03:41.090> and<00:03:41.300> get

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:41.390 
here and I go for the air slash and get

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:42.670 
here and I go for the air slash and get
a<00:03:41.420> crit<00:03:41.840> but<00:03:42.050> it's<00:03:42.170> kind<00:03:42.320> of<00:03:42.380> meaningless

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
a crit but it's kind of meaningless

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.080 
a crit but it's kind of meaningless
because<00:03:42.920> it's<00:03:43.190> going<00:03:43.400> to<00:03:43.489> be<00:03:43.580> a<00:03:43.610> to<00:03:43.790> a<00:03:43.820> KO

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.090 
because it's going to be a to a KO

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:46.390 
because it's going to be a to a KO
anyway<00:03:44.450> so<00:03:45.170> that<00:03:45.440> crit<00:03:45.739> kind<00:03:46.070> of<00:03:46.160> didn't

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 
anyway so that crit kind of didn't

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.070 
anyway so that crit kind of didn't
matter<00:03:46.520> but<00:03:47.270> I<00:03:47.300> end<00:03:47.450> up<00:03:47.480> begging<00:03:47.660> to<00:03:47.870> start

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:48.080 
matter but I end up begging to start

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:50.070 
matter but I end up begging to start
Raptor<00:03:48.380> down<00:03:48.530> which<00:03:48.709> is<00:03:48.830> kind<00:03:49.160> of<00:03:49.220> nice<00:03:49.370> and

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:50.080 
Raptor down which is kind of nice and

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:53.590 
Raptor down which is kind of nice and
now<00:03:51.080> he<00:03:51.140> goes<00:03:51.350> out<00:03:51.560> into<00:03:51.940> Mamoswine<00:03:52.940> and

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:53.600 
now he goes out into Mamoswine and

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:55.240 
now he goes out into Mamoswine and
looking<00:03:54.260> at<00:03:54.320> my<00:03:54.410> team<00:03:54.620> I<00:03:54.650> only<00:03:54.830> have<00:03:54.980> one

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.250 
looking at my team I only have one

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:57.190 
looking at my team I only have one
counter<00:03:55.700> in<00:03:55.880> my<00:03:56.030> team<00:03:56.270> left<00:03:56.690> for<00:03:56.810> Mamoswine

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 
counter in my team left for Mamoswine

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.640 
counter in my team left for Mamoswine
and<00:03:57.709> that<00:03:58.340> is<00:03:58.520> my<00:03:58.700> poly<00:03:59.060> toad<00:03:59.390> so<00:04:00.170> he<00:04:00.290> goes<00:04:00.440> out

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:00.650 
and that is my poly toad so he goes out

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:02.680 
and that is my poly toad so he goes out
into<00:04:00.920> it<00:04:01.250> and<00:04:01.550> I<00:04:01.940> don't<00:04:02.090> want<00:04:02.390> to<00:04:02.450> get<00:04:02.540> I

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:02.690 
into it and I don't want to get I

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:04.570 
into it and I don't want to get I
sharted<00:04:03.020> so<00:04:03.320> I<00:04:03.350> go<00:04:03.620> out<00:04:03.770> into<00:04:03.950> pollito<00:04:04.520> to

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:04.580 
sharted so I go out into pollito to

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:07.270 
sharted so I go out into pollito to
resist<00:04:05.150> and<00:04:05.390> he<00:04:05.900> gets<00:04:06.050> a<00:04:06.170> crit<00:04:06.590> with<00:04:06.739> ice<00:04:06.950> shard

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
resist and he gets a crit with ice shard

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.130 
resist and he gets a crit with ice shard
now<00:04:07.550> normally<00:04:08.030> you<00:04:08.150> would<00:04:08.270> think<00:04:08.300> okay<00:04:08.900> I

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:09.140 
now normally you would think okay I

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:11.199 
now normally you would think okay I
resisted<00:04:09.890> crit<00:04:10.220> still<00:04:10.760> doesn't<00:04:10.940> do<00:04:11.000> a<00:04:11.030> lot<00:04:11.180> of

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:11.209 
resisted crit still doesn't do a lot of

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:11.680 
resisted crit still doesn't do a lot of
damage

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:11.690 
damage

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:14.740 
damage
however<00:04:12.650> this<00:04:13.190> crate<00:04:13.550> really<00:04:14.030> did<00:04:14.300> matter

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:14.750 
however this crate really did matter

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:16.390 
however this crate really did matter
because<00:04:15.410> we<00:04:15.530> did<00:04:15.680> the<00:04:15.769> damage<00:04:16.010> calculation

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 
because we did the damage calculation

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.940 
because we did the damage calculation
after<00:04:17.330> the<00:04:17.480> game<00:04:17.690> and<00:04:18.049> he's<00:04:18.620> gonna<00:04:18.769> go

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:18.950 
after the game and he's gonna go

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:20.740 
after the game and he's gonna go
earthquake<00:04:19.459> here<00:04:19.760> and<00:04:19.970> if<00:04:20.120> it<00:04:20.299> wasn't<00:04:20.570> for

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:20.750 
earthquake here and if it wasn't for

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:22.300 
earthquake here and if it wasn't for
that<00:04:20.959> ice<00:04:21.290> shard<00:04:21.620> crit

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.310 
that ice shard crit

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:23.950 
that ice shard crit
I<00:04:22.340> would<00:04:22.789> have<00:04:22.880> survived<00:04:23.240> and<00:04:23.479> been<00:04:23.600> able<00:04:23.720> to

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:23.960 
I would have survived and been able to

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.020 
I would have survived and been able to
serve<00:04:24.200> his<00:04:24.380> Mamoswine<00:04:24.740> or<00:04:25.610> I<00:04:25.669> had<00:04:25.789> a<00:04:25.820> good

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:26.030 
serve his Mamoswine or I had a good

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:26.860 
serve his Mamoswine or I had a good
chance<00:04:26.270> to<00:04:26.450> survive

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870 
chance to survive

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:29.890 
chance to survive
rather<00:04:27.199> so<00:04:28.010> that<00:04:28.340> crit<00:04:28.669> really<00:04:29.150> really<00:04:29.660> hurt

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:29.900 
rather so that crit really really hurt

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:33.040 
rather so that crit really really hurt
and<00:04:30.820> now<00:04:31.820> looking<00:04:32.120> at<00:04:32.240> my<00:04:32.360> team<00:04:32.570> I<00:04:32.690> don't<00:04:32.900> have

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.050 
and now looking at my team I don't have

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:35.469 
and now looking at my team I don't have
any<00:04:33.290> counters<00:04:33.770> with<00:04:33.919> this<00:04:34.040> Mamoswine<00:04:34.479> the

00:04:35.469 --> 00:04:35.479 
any counters with this Mamoswine the

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:37.060 
any counters with this Mamoswine the
only<00:04:35.660> things<00:04:35.870> I<00:04:35.960> really<00:04:36.199> had<00:04:36.380> was<00:04:36.620> bronzong

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.070 
only things I really had was bronzong

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:38.890 
only things I really had was bronzong
and<00:04:37.280> politoed<00:04:37.729> and<00:04:37.910> they're<00:04:38.000> both<00:04:38.210> gone<00:04:38.540> so<00:04:38.870> I

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:38.900 
and politoed and they're both gone so I

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:40.629 
and politoed and they're both gone so I
go<00:04:39.139> on<00:04:39.229> that<00:04:39.380> Tyranitar<00:04:39.949> just<00:04:40.130> hoping<00:04:40.430> out

00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:40.639 
go on that Tyranitar just hoping out

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:42.610 
go on that Tyranitar just hoping out
speed<00:04:41.000> because<00:04:41.330> this<00:04:41.449> is<00:04:41.570> Jolly<00:04:41.870> max<00:04:42.229> speed

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:42.620 
speed because this is Jolly max speed

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:45.730 
speed because this is Jolly max speed
Tyranitar<00:04:43.400> but<00:04:44.120> um<00:04:44.330> his<00:04:44.690> Mamoswine<00:04:45.050> is<00:04:45.380> also

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:45.740 
Tyranitar but um his Mamoswine is also

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:48.040 
Tyranitar but um his Mamoswine is also
jolly<00:04:46.040> so<00:04:46.340> that's<00:04:46.490> irrelevant<00:04:47.000> and<00:04:47.180> that

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.050 
jolly so that's irrelevant and that

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:50.110 
jolly so that's irrelevant and that
sucks<00:04:48.350> for<00:04:48.440> me<00:04:48.680> so<00:04:49.010> I<00:04:49.040> go<00:04:49.430> on<00:04:49.550> to<00:04:49.729> Breloom

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:50.120 
sucks for me so I go on to Breloom

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.420 
sucks for me so I go on to Breloom
because<00:04:50.990> I'm<00:04:51.110> jolly<00:04:51.350> on<00:04:51.560> this<00:04:51.710> guy<00:04:51.860> -<00:04:51.919> he

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:52.430 
because I'm jolly on this guy - he

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:55.060 
because I'm jolly on this guy - he
switches<00:04:53.000> I<00:04:53.210> guess<00:04:53.720> not<00:04:54.169> wanting<00:04:54.500> to<00:04:54.560> risk<00:04:54.770> not

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:55.070 
switches I guess not wanting to risk not

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:57.129 
switches I guess not wanting to risk not
killing<00:04:55.430> me<00:04:55.490> with<00:04:55.639> ice<00:04:55.760> shard<00:04:56.030> so<00:04:56.720> I<00:04:56.750> just<00:04:56.990> go

00:04:57.129 --> 00:04:57.139 
killing me with ice shard so I just go

00:04:57.139 --> 00:04:59.379 
killing me with ice shard so I just go
for<00:04:57.290> the<00:04:57.410> spore<00:04:57.710> and<00:04:58.040> I<00:04:58.340> put<00:04:58.580> his<00:04:58.729> Infernape<00:04:59.240> to

00:04:59.379 --> 00:04:59.389 
for the spore and I put his Infernape to

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:00.730 
for the spore and I put his Infernape to
sleep<00:04:59.600> so<00:04:59.840> that's<00:05:00.050> not<00:05:00.199> so<00:05:00.470> bad

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:00.740 
sleep so that's not so bad

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:03.430 
sleep so that's not so bad
and<00:05:01.100> I'm<00:05:01.940> just<00:05:02.180> gonna<00:05:02.330> try<00:05:02.600> to<00:05:02.630> go<00:05:02.840> for<00:05:02.870> the<00:05:03.110> sub

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:03.440 
and I'm just gonna try to go for the sub

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:05.680 
and I'm just gonna try to go for the sub
on<00:05:03.710> his<00:05:03.830> switch<00:05:04.160> it's<00:05:04.910> really<00:05:05.180> the<00:05:05.300> best<00:05:05.449> thing

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:05.690 
on his switch it's really the best thing

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:07.029 
on his switch it's really the best thing
I<00:05:05.750> can<00:05:05.810> do<00:05:06.050> at<00:05:06.169> the<00:05:06.260> moment<00:05:06.289> I<00:05:06.590> probably<00:05:06.830> could

00:05:07.029 --> 00:05:07.039 
I can do at the moment I probably could

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:08.439 
I can do at the moment I probably could
have<00:05:07.070> just<00:05:07.280> focused<00:05:07.610> punched<00:05:07.970> on<00:05:08.090> the<00:05:08.240> switch

00:05:08.439 --> 00:05:08.449 
have just focused punched on the switch

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:10.719 
have just focused punched on the switch
but<00:05:08.810> I<00:05:09.080> don't<00:05:09.440> know<00:05:09.530> so<00:05:10.190> you<00:05:10.280> go<00:05:10.370> down<00:05:10.550> the

00:05:10.719 --> 00:05:10.729 
but I don't know so you go down the

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:12.939 
but I don't know so you go down the
pincer<00:05:11.090> and<00:05:11.360> I'm<00:05:12.020> just<00:05:12.199> going<00:05:12.350> to<00:05:12.440> go<00:05:12.680> for<00:05:12.889> the

00:05:12.939 --> 00:05:12.949 
pincer and I'm just going to go for the

00:05:12.949 --> 00:05:15.820 
pincer and I'm just going to go for the
sub<00:05:13.190> and<00:05:14.020> that's<00:05:15.020> kind<00:05:15.350> of<00:05:15.410> good<00:05:15.590> for<00:05:15.620> me

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:15.830 
sub and that's kind of good for me

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:19.360 
sub and that's kind of good for me
because<00:05:16.419> yeah<00:05:17.419> subs<00:05:17.990> are<00:05:18.199> cool<00:05:18.500> and<00:05:18.949> I'm<00:05:19.280> just

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:19.370 
because yeah subs are cool and I'm just

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:22.150 
because yeah subs are cool and I'm just
going<00:05:19.520> to<00:05:19.550> go<00:05:19.669> for<00:05:19.820> the<00:05:19.910> focus<00:05:20.210> punch<00:05:21.160> hoping

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:22.160

doesn't<00:05:47.870> really<00:05:47.900> matter<00:05:48.289> because<00:05:48.680> apparently

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:49.400 
doesn't really matter because apparently

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:51.760 
doesn't really matter because apparently
he<00:05:49.550> has<00:05:49.639> quick<00:05:49.849> attack<00:05:50.229> and<00:05:51.229> he's<00:05:51.440> gonna<00:05:51.560> get<00:05:51.710> a

he has quick attack and he's gonna get a
quick<00:05:51.889> attack<00:05:52.190> on<00:05:52.370> my<00:05:52.490> Flygon<00:05:53.000> but<00:05:53.389> it<00:05:53.479> doesn't

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:53.720 
quick attack on my Flygon but it doesn't

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:55.150 
quick attack on my Flygon but it doesn't
really<00:05:53.840> matter<00:05:54.110> because<00:05:54.620> I<00:05:54.650> sure<00:05:54.979> it<00:05:55.070> would

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:55.160 
really matter because I sure it would

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:57.790 
really matter because I sure it would
kill<00:05:55.370> me<00:05:55.490> anyway<00:05:55.729> so<00:05:56.169> yeah<00:05:57.169> I<00:05:57.199> go<00:05:57.380> on<00:05:57.500> the<00:05:57.620> fly

gun I'm just gonna go for the outrage at
this<00:05:59.360> point<00:05:59.570> I<00:05:59.690> know<00:05:59.750> I'm<00:05:59.990> pretty<00:06:00.229> much
