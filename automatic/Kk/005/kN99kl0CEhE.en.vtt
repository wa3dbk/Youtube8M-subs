Vinci<00:01:30.420> started<00:01:30.720> by<00:01:30.810> drawing<00:01:31.110> a<00:01:31.200> picture<00:01:31.350> of<00:01:31.590> a

Vinci started by drawing a picture of a

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.920 
Vinci started by drawing a picture of a
spaceship<00:01:32.159> then<00:01:32.729> he<00:01:32.820> added<00:01:33.090> some<00:01:33.270> gears<00:01:33.570> the

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
spaceship then he added some gears the

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.539 
spaceship then he added some gears the
idea<00:01:34.200> was<00:01:34.350> that<00:01:34.380> two<00:01:34.680> guys<00:01:34.829> could<00:01:35.070> sit<00:01:35.280> inside

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
idea was that two guys could sit inside

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.670 
idea was that two guys could sit inside
and<00:01:35.729> operate<00:01:36.090> a<00:01:36.119> pair<00:01:36.360> of<00:01:36.450> cranks<00:01:36.930> one<00:01:37.500> would

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
and operate a pair of cranks one would

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.499 
and operate a pair of cranks one would
propel<00:01:37.979> the<00:01:38.100> spaceship<00:01:38.490> forward<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.360> other

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
propel the spaceship forward the other

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:40.940 
propel the spaceship forward the other
would<00:01:39.659> make<00:01:39.810> it<00:01:39.960> turn<00:01:40.140> in<00:01:40.320> one<00:01:40.470> direction<00:01:40.650> or

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
would make it turn in one direction or

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.560 
would make it turn in one direction or
the<00:01:41.009> other<00:01:41.100> but<00:01:41.579> the<00:01:41.729> spaceship<00:01:42.119> had<00:01:42.299> as<00:01:42.420> many

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
the other but the spaceship had as many

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.260 
the other but the spaceship had as many
cranks<00:01:43.020> as<00:01:43.290> it<00:01:43.409> had<00:01:43.560> fatal<00:01:43.950> flaws<00:01:44.220> for<00:01:44.850> one<00:01:45.060> it

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
cranks as it had fatal flaws for one it

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.090 
cranks as it had fatal flaws for one it
was<00:01:45.390> made<00:01:45.540> of<00:01:45.659> wood<00:01:45.899> and<00:01:46.110> while<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:46.680> 15th
