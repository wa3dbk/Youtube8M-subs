00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
healthier than most Americans so the

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.020 
healthier than most Americans so the
first<00:00:13.500> way<00:00:13.710> to<00:00:13.740> eat<00:00:13.920> healthy<00:00:13.950> food<00:00:14.519> is<00:00:14.820> to

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
first way to eat healthy food is to

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.640 
first way to eat healthy food is to

learn to prepare your own food and I'm

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.170 
learn to prepare your own food and I'm
as<00:00:16.859> guilty<00:00:17.039> of<00:00:17.160> this<00:00:17.310> as<00:00:17.460> anyone<00:00:17.760> as<00:00:17.910> I've<00:00:18.029> said

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
as guilty of this as anyone as I've said

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.550 
as guilty of this as anyone as I've said
in<00:00:18.270> the<00:00:18.330> past<00:00:18.359> I'm<00:00:18.690> a<00:00:18.779> terrible<00:00:19.080> cook

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
in the past I'm a terrible cook

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.820 
in the past I'm a terrible cook
but<00:00:20.039> it's<00:00:20.310> a<00:00:20.460> long<00:00:20.670> learning<00:00:20.970> process<00:00:21.660> to<00:00:21.960> be

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
but it's a long learning process to be

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.470 
but it's a long learning process to be
able<00:00:23.039> to<00:00:23.100> prepare<00:00:23.430> your<00:00:23.580> own<00:00:23.609> food<00:00:23.730> versus

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
able to prepare your own food versus

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.240 
able to prepare your own food versus
buying<00:00:24.720> pre<00:00:25.109> processed<00:00:25.590> food<00:00:25.830> which<00:00:26.039> isn't

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
buying pre processed food which isn't

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.160 
buying pre processed food which isn't
healthy<00:00:26.670> and<00:00:26.820> is<00:00:26.910> overpriced<00:00:27.359> and<00:00:27.720> is

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
healthy and is overpriced and is

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.870 
healthy and is overpriced and is
probably<00:00:28.529> gonna<00:00:28.710> leave<00:00:28.949> you<00:00:29.130> deficient<00:00:29.730> in

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
probably gonna leave you deficient in

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.490 
probably gonna leave you deficient in
nutrition<00:00:30.390> and<00:00:30.510> make<00:00:30.689> you<00:00:30.840> want<00:00:30.990> to<00:00:31.050> eat<00:00:31.140> more

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
nutrition and make you want to eat more

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.880 
nutrition and make you want to eat more
so<00:00:32.489> if<00:00:33.300> you<00:00:33.510> can't<00:00:33.780> afford<00:00:33.930> to<00:00:34.290> eat<00:00:34.530> healthy

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
so if you can't afford to eat healthy

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.620 
so if you can't afford to eat healthy
food<00:00:35.130> today<00:00:35.309> think<00:00:36.059> about<00:00:36.270> what<00:00:36.450> you're<00:00:36.570> gonna

same for them I think networking is
perhaps<00:03:07.510> the<00:03:07.870> best<00:03:08.170> way<00:03:08.350> to<00:03:08.380> save<00:03:08.680> money<00:03:08.890> so

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:09.610

those are just the ways I've found over

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:12.479 
those are just the ways I've found over
the<00:03:11.050> years<00:03:11.080> to<00:03:11.380> save<00:03:11.530> probably<00:03:11.950> more<00:03:12.070> than<00:03:12.190> 50%

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:12.489 
the years to save probably more than 50%

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:14.400 
the years to save probably more than 50%
