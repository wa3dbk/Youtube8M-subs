00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.160 
here and grab a rectangle or three it

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:02.259 
here and grab a rectangle or three it
when<00:03:58.310> you<00:03:58.430> get<00:03:58.519> it<00:03:58.640> really<00:03:58.910> small<00:04:01.030> now<00:04:02.030> when

it's going to get even smaller just take
that<00:04:07.849> into<00:04:08.180> a<00:04:08.209> vector<00:04:08.540> I<00:04:08.810> remember<00:04:09.200> that<00:04:16.329> about

00:04:17.319 --> 00:04:17.329 
that into a vector I remember that about

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:22.260 
that into a vector I remember that about
right<00:04:17.570> there

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:26.500

bigger I just start going down the head

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:44.860 
bigger I just start going down the head
with<00:04:36.620> it

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:44.870 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:48.050

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:35.830 
when I shape it I try to make it where

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:38.369 
when I shape it I try to make it where
it<00:06:36.009> is<00:06:36.490> small<00:06:37.180> at<00:06:37.300> the<00:06:37.389> top<00:06:37.569> but<00:06:37.840> curves<00:06:38.139> in
