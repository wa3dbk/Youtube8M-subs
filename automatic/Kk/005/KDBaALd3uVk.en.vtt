00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:23.900 
always be pretty crappy because it'll be

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.570 
always be pretty crappy because it'll be
too<00:01:24.900> far<00:01:25.200> away<00:01:25.350> because<00:01:25.590> you<00:01:25.860> never<00:01:26.040> know<00:01:26.159> from

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
too far away because you never know from

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.719 
too far away because you never know from
which<00:01:26.759> side<00:01:27.150> he's<00:01:27.360> going<00:01:27.509> to<00:01:27.570> show<00:01:27.750> up<00:01:28.729> maybe

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
which side he's going to show up maybe

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.609 
which side he's going to show up maybe
if<00:01:29.970> you<00:01:30.060> have<00:01:30.210> a<00:01:30.240> fully<00:01:30.600> functional<00:01:31.259> Nintendo

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.530 
if you have a fully functional Nintendo
64<00:01:32.130> controller<00:01:32.460> this<00:01:32.640> might<00:01:32.820> be<00:01:32.939> easier<00:01:33.390> but

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
64 controller this might be easier but

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.179 
64 controller this might be easier but
because<00:01:33.810> my<00:01:33.990> control<00:01:34.380> stick<00:01:34.619> is<00:01:34.770> incredibly

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
because my control stick is incredibly

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.429 
because my control stick is incredibly
broken<00:01:35.700> I'm<00:01:36.600> really<00:01:36.930> having<00:01:37.079> a<00:01:37.200> hard<00:01:37.229> time

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
turning fast enough to get decent

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.230 
turning fast enough to get decent
pictures<00:01:39.720> of<00:01:39.869> them<00:01:39.990> or<00:01:40.110> throw<00:01:40.380> stuff<00:01:40.740> at<00:01:40.920> him

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240 
pictures of them or throw stuff at him

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:48.149 
pictures of them or throw stuff at him

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:48.159 
when he comes ceiling by so yeah

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:52.980 
when he comes ceiling by so yeah
that's<00:01:48.850> kind<00:01:49.210> of<00:01:49.299> what<00:01:49.479> you<00:01:49.630> get<00:01:51.840> okay<00:01:52.840> the

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990 
that's kind of what you get okay the

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:54.270 
that's kind of what you get okay the
bubbles<00:01:53.229> broken<00:01:53.560> again<00:01:53.770> where<00:01:53.979> is<00:01:54.069> he<00:01:54.159> going

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
to show up on the right side again

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.440 
to show up on the right side again
that's<00:01:59.560> pretty<00:01:59.979> much<00:02:00.100> the<00:02:00.159> best<00:02:00.579> shot<00:02:01.060> you<00:02:01.270> can

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450
