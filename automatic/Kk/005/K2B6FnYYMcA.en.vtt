00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
chaotic at all I'm thinking that's

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.499

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.149

lashes<00:01:21.840> so<00:01:22.320> it<00:01:22.380> would<00:01:22.470> be<00:01:22.590> hard<00:01:22.799> for<00:01:22.890> them<00:01:23.130> to

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
lashes so it would be hard for them to

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.100 
lashes so it would be hard for them to
get<00:01:23.430> kind<00:01:23.759> of<00:01:23.939> messy<00:01:24.240> they<00:01:24.600> just<00:01:24.840> stay

waterproof as all heck cons I would say

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.390 
waterproof as all heck cons I would say
our<00:02:16.420> it<00:02:16.690> already<00:02:17.140> starts<00:02:17.500> off<00:02:17.650> as<00:02:17.830> a<00:02:17.860> kind<00:02:18.250> of

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
our it already starts off as a kind of

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.520 
our it already starts off as a kind of
dry<00:02:18.760> or<00:02:19.000> formula<00:02:19.540> which<00:02:19.780> is<00:02:19.930> why<00:02:20.080> I<00:02:20.110> think<00:02:20.260> it

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
dry or formula which is why I think it

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.590 
dry or formula which is why I think it
holds<00:02:20.830> my<00:02:21.070> lashes<00:02:21.340> so<00:02:21.730> well<00:02:21.940> from<00:02:22.180> the<00:02:22.420> get-go

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600

also I did have some blinking with this

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.390 
also I did have some blinking with this
and<00:02:25.390> after<00:02:25.930> barely<00:02:26.290> a<00:02:26.530> month<00:02:26.710> of<00:02:26.920> using<00:02:27.130> it

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
and after barely a month of using it

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:28.770 
and after barely a month of using it
it's<00:02:27.550> getting<00:02:27.730> to<00:02:27.970> that<00:02:28.000> point<00:02:28.330> where<00:02:28.510> it's

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
it's getting to that point where it's

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.290 
it's getting to that point where it's
too<00:02:29.050> dry<00:02:29.320> to<00:02:29.350> use<00:02:29.680> so<00:02:30.130> do<00:02:30.580> i<00:02:30.640> recommend<00:02:31.180> giving

major crowding going on down here that
was<00:03:18.370> basically<00:03:18.580> pushing<00:03:19.330> out<00:03:19.510> one<00:03:19.810> of<00:03:19.840> my

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.080 
was basically pushing out one of my

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.780 
was basically pushing out one of my
teeth<00:03:20.290> completely<00:03:20.890> which<00:03:21.070> was<00:03:21.250> then<00:03:21.400> messing

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
teeth completely which was then messing

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.100 
teeth completely which was then messing
up<00:03:21.880> my<00:03:22.000> top<00:03:22.239> teeth<00:03:22.480> because<00:03:22.690> it<00:03:22.720> was<00:03:22.900> pushing

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:23.110 
up my top teeth because it was pushing

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:24.780 
up my top teeth because it was pushing
those<00:03:23.440> out<00:03:23.739> when<00:03:23.980> I<00:03:24.010> first<00:03:24.250> went<00:03:24.430> into<00:03:24.610> the

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
those out when I first went into the

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:26.640 
those out when I first went into the
orthodontist<00:03:25.330> to<00:03:25.480> get<00:03:25.600> an<00:03:25.690> evaluation<00:03:25.810> he

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
orthodontist to get an evaluation he

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:28.170 
orthodontist to get an evaluation he
wasn't<00:03:26.920> even<00:03:27.100> sure<00:03:27.130> if<00:03:27.280> we<00:03:27.459> could<00:03:27.670> fix<00:03:27.970> this

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
wasn't even sure if we could fix this

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.270 
wasn't even sure if we could fix this
completely<00:03:28.870> he<00:03:29.170> said<00:03:29.380> it<00:03:29.500> might<00:03:29.680> end<00:03:29.709> up<00:03:29.980> still

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 
completely he said it might end up still

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.250 
completely he said it might end up still
a<00:03:30.459> little<00:03:30.940> off<00:03:31.209> but<00:03:31.510> we<00:03:31.630> could<00:03:31.810> do<00:03:31.930> our<00:03:31.959> best

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260 
a little off but we could do our best

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.320 
a little off but we could do our best
and<00:03:32.650> man<00:03:32.950> I<00:03:33.190> think<00:03:33.400> it<00:03:33.489> came<00:03:33.640> out<00:03:33.790> better<00:03:34.000> than

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:34.330 
and man I think it came out better than

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:36.150 
and man I think it came out better than
at<00:03:34.540> least<00:03:34.750> I<00:03:34.900> expected<00:03:35.560> so<00:03:35.770> now<00:03:35.920> that<00:03:35.950> I'm

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.160 
at least I expected so now that I'm

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:37.920 
at least I expected so now that I'm
completely<00:03:36.489> done<00:03:36.670> with<00:03:36.850> my<00:03:37.209> treatment<00:03:37.720> plan

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
completely done with my treatment plan

completely done with my treatment plan
and<00:03:38.350> the<00:03:38.650> aligners<00:03:39.220> I<00:03:39.520> opted<00:03:39.970> into<00:03:40.180> getting

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 
and the aligners I opted into getting

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.420 
and the aligners I opted into getting
bonded<00:03:41.050> or<00:03:41.170> permanent<00:03:41.680> retainers<00:03:42.100> that's

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
bonded or permanent retainers that's

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:43.800 
bonded or permanent retainers that's

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
when they basically glue a piece of

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:45.660 
when they basically glue a piece of
metal<00:03:44.140> behind<00:03:44.410> like<00:03:44.830> four<00:03:45.100> or<00:03:45.250> five<00:03:45.280> in<00:03:45.580> your
