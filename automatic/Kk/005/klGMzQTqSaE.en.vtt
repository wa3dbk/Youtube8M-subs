it<00:00:54.180> was<00:00:54.300> a<00:00:54.329> little<00:00:54.570> bit<00:00:54.840> confusing<00:00:55.620> here<00:00:56.219> and

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
it was a little bit confusing here and

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.310 
it was a little bit confusing here and
there<00:00:56.760> because<00:00:57.149> when<00:00:57.449> it<00:00:57.570> starts<00:00:57.840> off<00:00:58.050> I

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
there because when it starts off I

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.319 
there because when it starts off I
didn't<00:00:58.770> really<00:00:59.010> get<00:00:59.489> what's<00:00:59.760> going<00:01:00.180> on

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
didn't really get what's going on

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.150 
didn't really get what's going on
because<00:01:00.570> I<00:01:00.870> guess<00:01:01.199> cuz<00:01:01.590> it<00:01:01.680> starts<00:01:01.949> off<00:01:02.039> with

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
because I guess cuz it starts off with

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.979 
because I guess cuz it starts off with
the<00:01:02.280> fight<00:01:02.550> but<00:01:02.760> it<00:01:02.910> turns<00:01:03.180> out<00:01:03.300> it's<00:01:03.570> a<00:01:03.690> fight

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
the fight but it turns out it's a fight

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.899 
the fight but it turns out it's a fight
that<00:01:04.019> happens<00:01:04.589> later<00:01:04.890> on<00:01:05.129> and<00:01:05.549> then<00:01:05.670> I'm
