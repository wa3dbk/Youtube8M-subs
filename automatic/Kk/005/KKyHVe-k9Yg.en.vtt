is hours and hours and hours

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.060 
is hours and hours and hours
of<00:01:35.640> work<00:01:36.240> and<00:01:36.930> the<00:01:37.080> vikon<00:01:37.440> system<00:01:37.740> does<00:01:37.920> that

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
of work and the vikon system does that

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.550 
of work and the vikon system does that
force<00:01:38.280> automatically<00:01:39.020> further<00:01:40.020> it<00:01:40.170> enables

so<00:01:48.960> we<00:01:49.050> can<00:01:49.200> tell<00:01:49.380> if<00:01:49.470> we've<00:01:49.590> got<00:01:49.800> good<00:01:50.009> data

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
so we can tell if we've got good data

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.570 
so we can tell if we've got good data
right<00:01:50.580> away<00:01:50.850> or<00:01:51.360> if<00:01:51.479> we<00:01:51.600> need<00:01:51.810> to<00:01:51.930> try<00:01:52.170> and

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:52.580 
right away or if we need to try and

00:01:52.580 --> 00:02:04.060 
right away or if we need to try and
collect<00:01:53.580> more

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
automatically writes that see the hard

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.550 
automatically writes that see the hard
drive<00:02:20.700> when<00:02:21.210> I<00:02:21.240> stop<00:02:21.900> the<00:02:21.930> trial<00:02:22.320> it

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
drive when I stop the trial it

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.230 
drive when I stop the trial it
automatically<00:02:23.010> advances<00:02:23.520> to<00:02:23.610> the<00:02:23.640> next<00:02:23.850> trial

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
automatically advances to the next trial

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.180

in<00:02:24.720> the<00:02:24.810> meantime<00:02:24.990> that<00:02:25.380> frees<00:02:25.590> up<00:02:25.740> my<00:02:25.860> hands

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
in the meantime that frees up my hands

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.990 
in the meantime that frees up my hands
lets<00:02:26.430> me<00:02:27.380> start<00:02:28.380> a<00:02:28.530> trial<00:02:28.770> early<00:02:28.980> and<00:02:29.370> then<00:02:29.460> try

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
lets me start a trial early and then try

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.490 
lets me start a trial early and then try
to<00:02:30.030> record<00:02:30.330> some<00:02:30.540> high-speed<00:02:30.660> video<00:02:31.110> because

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
to record some high-speed video because

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:32.980 
to record some high-speed video because
it<00:02:31.620> does<00:02:31.740> take<00:02:31.890> a<00:02:31.920> little<00:02:32.100> bit<00:02:32.190> more<00:02:32.370> time<00:02:32.550> and

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:32.990 
it does take a little bit more time and

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:36.650 
it does take a little bit more time and
it's<00:02:33.990> much<00:02:34.290> much<00:02:34.590> easier<00:02:35.220> it<00:02:35.550> can<00:02:35.610> generate<00:02:36.600> a

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
it's much much easier it can generate a

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.720 
it's much much easier it can generate a
lot<00:02:36.960> of<00:02:36.990> data<00:02:37.230> a<00:02:37.380> lot<00:02:37.500> more<00:02:37.740> quickly<00:02:37.920> I<00:02:38.370> can

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
lot of data a lot more quickly I can

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.220 
lot of data a lot more quickly I can
process<00:02:38.940> these<00:02:39.270> trials<00:02:39.660> within<00:02:39.900> a<00:02:40.080> couple

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
process these trials within a couple

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.890 
process these trials within a couple
hours<00:02:40.440> whereas<00:02:41.370> with<00:02:41.670> just<00:02:42.210> a<00:02:42.300> regular<00:02:42.600> high

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
hours whereas with just a regular high

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.110 
hours whereas with just a regular high
speed<00:02:43.170> video<00:02:43.580> generally<00:02:44.580> you<00:02:44.670> have<00:02:44.850> to<00:02:44.970> do<00:02:45.090> a

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
speed video generally you have to do a

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.570 
speed video generally you have to do a
lot<00:02:45.330> of<00:02:45.360> manual<00:02:46.080> or<00:02:46.320> utter<00:02:46.590> tracking<00:02:47.160> and<00:02:47.370> even

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
lot of manual or utter tracking and even

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:53.090 
lot of manual or utter tracking and even
still<00:02:47.820> it<00:02:47.940> does<00:02:48.090> take<00:02:48.270> a<00:02:48.300> while<00:02:48.390> to<00:02:48.540> do

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.730 

all<00:02:53.700> right<00:02:53.850> that's<00:02:54.120> it<00:02:54.300> yep<00:02:54.570> we've<00:02:54.810> we've<00:02:55.500> put

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:55.740 
all right that's it yep we've we've put

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:57.890 
all right that's it yep we've we've put
in<00:02:55.830> seven<00:02:56.220> good<00:02:56.370> hard<00:02:56.610> days<00:02:56.790> we've<00:02:57.450> got<00:02:57.630> a<00:02:57.660> lot

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
in seven good hard days we've got a lot

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.920 
in seven good hard days we've got a lot
of<00:02:58.020> really<00:02:58.140> great<00:02:58.380> data<00:02:59.300> it<00:03:00.300> was<00:03:00.450> a<00:03:00.480> help<00:03:00.690> like

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
of really great data it was a help like

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.630 
of really great data it was a help like
on<00:03:01.140> were<00:03:01.290> kind<00:03:01.500> of<00:03:01.560> be<00:03:01.830> able<00:03:01.920> to<00:03:02.070> analyze<00:03:02.430> it<00:03:02.460> a

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
on were kind of be able to analyze it a

on were kind of be able to analyze it a
lot<00:03:02.820> easier<00:03:03.830> today<00:03:04.830> was<00:03:05.100> a<00:03:05.130> good<00:03:05.310> day<00:03:05.370> we<00:03:05.700> had

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
lot easier today was a good day we had

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:06.830 
lot easier today was a good day we had
the<00:03:05.880> last<00:03:06.000> animal<00:03:06.300> we<00:03:06.450> had<00:03:06.630> it<00:03:06.720> was<00:03:06.810> just

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
the last animal we had it was just

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.390 
the last animal we had it was just
fantastic<00:03:07.140> we've<00:03:07.680> got<00:03:07.800> a<00:03:07.830> lot<00:03:07.950> of<00:03:07.980> really<00:03:08.190> good

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
fantastic we've got a lot of really good

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.730 
fantastic we've got a lot of really good
trials<00:03:08.850> we<00:03:09.570> got<00:03:09.720> a<00:03:09.750> lot<00:03:09.960> of<00:03:10.110> data<00:03:10.320> from<00:03:10.560> both

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:10.740 
trials we got a lot of data from both

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:13.030 
trials we got a lot of data from both
the<00:03:11.010> grey<00:03:11.190> kangaroos<00:03:11.700> and<00:03:11.940> the<00:03:12.030> red<00:03:12.210> kangaroos

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
the grey kangaroos and the red kangaroos

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.350 
the grey kangaroos and the red kangaroos
and<00:03:14.040> we<00:03:14.160> should<00:03:14.340> be<00:03:14.430> able<00:03:14.520> to<00:03:14.640> get<00:03:14.850> a<00:03:14.880> pretty

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360
