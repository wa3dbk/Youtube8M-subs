1<00:00:06.210> all<00:00:06.930> right<00:00:07.109> so<00:00:07.319> this<00:00:07.560> is<00:00:07.799> a<00:00:08.240> strumming

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
1 all right so this is a strumming

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.480 
1 all right so this is a strumming
pattern<00:00:09.599> which<00:00:09.750> one<00:00:10.740> of<00:00:10.769> the<00:00:10.950> strong<00:00:11.160> acids

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
pattern which one of the strong acids

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:12.950 
pattern which one of the strong acids
which<00:00:11.610> I'll<00:00:11.759> use<00:00:11.969> in<00:00:12.150> the<00:00:12.240> law<00:00:12.360> of<00:00:12.389> my<00:00:12.599> videos

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
which I'll use in the law of my videos

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.340 
which I'll use in the law of my videos
and<00:00:13.370> is<00:00:14.370> it's<00:00:14.849> a<00:00:15.089> simple<00:00:15.360> one<00:00:15.690> which<00:00:15.929> can<00:00:16.230> be

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
and is it's a simple one which can be

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.109 
and is it's a simple one which can be
applied<00:00:16.710> to<00:00:16.920> a<00:00:16.949> lot<00:00:17.039> of<00:00:17.250> different<00:00:17.460> sounds<00:00:17.970> and

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
applied to a lot of different sounds and

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.210 
applied to a lot of different sounds and
i<00:00:18.630> would<00:00:18.660> recommend<00:00:18.810> beginners<00:00:19.740> to<00:00:19.949> learn<00:00:19.980> it

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
i would recommend beginners to learn it

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.529 
i would recommend beginners to learn it
alright<00:00:20.550> so<00:00:20.730> basically<00:00:20.850> the<00:00:21.240> way<00:00:21.270> this

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
alright so basically the way this

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:29.660 
alright so basically the way this
pattern<00:00:21.900> goes<00:00:22.080> it's<00:00:23.869> 1<00:00:24.869> 1<00:00:25.670> &amp;<00:00:26.670> 2<00:00:27.029> &amp;<00:00:27.480> 3<00:00:27.599> &amp;<00:00:27.900> 4<00:00:28.349> &amp;<00:00:29.010> 1<00:00:29.039> &amp;

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
pattern goes it's 1 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 &amp; 1 &amp;

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.060 
pattern goes it's 1 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 &amp; 1 &amp;
2<00:00:29.760> &amp;<00:00:30.179> 3<00:00:30.779> &amp;<00:00:31.260> 4

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.479 
2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4
so<00:00:32.579> it's<00:00:32.759> 1<00:00:33.690> then<00:00:34.230> so<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:35.010> second<00:00:35.370> ones

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
so it's 1 then so the second ones

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.190 
so it's 1 then so the second ones

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.320 
comfortable with that rhythm you can

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.870 
comfortable with that rhythm you can
improve<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.500> pattern<00:01:04.860> and<00:01:05.010> add<00:01:05.280> to<00:01:05.460> it<00:01:05.610> with

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
improve the pattern and add to it with

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.679 
improve the pattern and add to it with
an<00:01:06.060> upstroke<00:01:06.510> so<00:01:07.049> what<00:01:07.200> you<00:01:07.320> do<00:01:07.500> is<00:01:07.710> 1<00:01:08.369> &amp;<00:01:08.729> 2<00:01:09.119> &amp;<00:01:09.510> 3

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
an upstroke so what you do is 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.780 
an upstroke so what you do is 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
&amp; 4 &amp; 1 2 3 4 so what's happening is

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:24.410 
&amp; 4 &amp; 1 2 3 4 so what's happening is
you're<00:01:15.270> going<00:01:15.420> 1<00:01:16.009> &amp;<00:01:17.390> 2<00:01:19.729> 3<00:01:23.060> alright<00:01:24.060> so<00:01:24.240> done

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
you're going 1 &amp; 2 3 alright so done

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:34.039 
you're going 1 &amp; 2 3 alright so done
quickly<00:01:29.119> and<00:01:32.090> this<00:01:33.090> follows<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.509> same<00:01:33.810> sort

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
quickly and this follows the same sort

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.080 
quickly and this follows the same sort
of<00:01:34.110> rhythm<00:01:34.229> as<00:01:34.500> just<00:01:35.159> a<00:01:35.280> Down<00:01:35.430> stroke<00:01:35.700> 1<00:01:35.880> so<00:01:36.030> you

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
of rhythm as just a Down stroke 1 so you

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.770 
of rhythm as just a Down stroke 1 so you
can<00:01:36.180> use<00:01:36.869> you<00:01:37.710> can<00:01:37.740> use<00:01:37.950> either<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.090> down

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
can use you can use either the down

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.289 
can use you can use either the down
stroke<00:01:40.259> or<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:41.040> down<00:01:41.250> stroke<00:01:41.909> with<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.180> up

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
stroke or the down stroke with the up

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.510 
stroke or the down stroke with the up
stroke<00:01:42.570> on<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:43.380> same<00:01:43.590> song<00:01:43.890> depending<00:01:44.430> on

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
stroke on the same song depending on

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.130 
stroke on the same song depending on
where<00:01:44.970> which<00:01:45.210> part<00:01:45.450> of<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.570> song<00:01:45.720> you<00:01:45.899> want<00:01:46.020> to

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
where which part of the song you want to

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.139 
where which part of the song you want to
do<00:01:46.259> it<00:01:46.439> you<00:01:46.619> can<00:01:46.799> interchange<00:01:47.490> quite<00:01:47.970> easily

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
do it you can interchange quite easily

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.240 
do it you can interchange quite easily
because<00:01:48.450> it<00:01:48.960> follows<00:01:49.350> the<00:01:49.380> same<00:01:49.770> rhythm<00:01:50.009> of

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
because it follows the same rhythm of

00:01:50.250 --> 00:02:04.010 
because it follows the same rhythm of
the<00:01:50.399> song<00:01:50.640> alright<00:01:51.030> so<00:01:51.240> you'd<00:01:51.450> go

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.070 

all<00:02:05.020> right<00:02:05.200> so<00:02:06.030> with<00:02:07.030> that<00:02:07.210> I<00:02:07.480> recommend

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
all right so with that I recommend

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.919 
all right so with that I recommend
practice<00:02:08.950> this<00:02:09.130> strumming<00:02:09.429> pattern<00:02:09.910> get<00:02:10.720> used

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:10.929 
practice this strumming pattern get used

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:13.530 
practice this strumming pattern get used
to<00:02:11.140> it<00:02:11.290> and<00:02:11.410> just<00:02:11.980> add<00:02:12.580> it<00:02:12.640> to<00:02:12.970> your<00:02:13.090> repertoire

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
of of strums that you know because this

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:17.910 
of of strums that you know because this
can<00:02:16.840> be<00:02:16.960> applied<00:02:17.230> to<00:02:17.410> a<00:02:17.440> lot<00:02:17.500> of<00:02:17.680> different
