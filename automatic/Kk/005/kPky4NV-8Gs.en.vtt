00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:03.290 

now<00:00:02.280> I<00:00:02.310> think<00:00:02.430> it's<00:00:02.700> fair<00:00:02.880> to<00:00:03.060> say<00:00:03.270> that

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:03.300 
now I think it's fair to say that

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.300 
now I think it's fair to say that
strumming<00:00:03.990> is<00:00:04.109> probably<00:00:04.560> the<00:00:04.770> number<00:00:05.130> one

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.310 
strumming is probably the number one

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.179 
strumming is probably the number one
reason<00:00:05.340> why<00:00:05.759> beginners<00:00:06.570> can't<00:00:07.170> play<00:00:07.410> guitar

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
reason why beginners can't play guitar

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:09.920 
reason why beginners can't play guitar
songs<00:00:08.430> or<00:00:08.760> have<00:00:09.090> a<00:00:09.120> lot<00:00:09.300> of<00:00:09.420> difficulty

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:09.930 
songs or have a lot of difficulty

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
playing their first guitar songs what

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.020 
playing their first guitar songs what
I'm<00:00:13.080> going<00:00:13.200> to<00:00:13.260> show<00:00:13.410> you<00:00:13.469> here<00:00:13.830> are<00:00:14.070> the<00:00:14.670> three

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
I'm going to show you here are the three

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.510 
I'm going to show you here are the three
most<00:00:15.300> powerful<00:00:16.170> strumming<00:00:16.890> patterns<00:00:17.250> that

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
most powerful strumming patterns that

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.730 
most powerful strumming patterns that
you<00:00:17.640> can<00:00:17.850> learn<00:00:18.140> to<00:00:19.140> get<00:00:19.289> going

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
you can learn to get going

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.920 
you can learn to get going
playing<00:00:20.010> hundreds<00:00:20.400> of<00:00:20.580> popular<00:00:21.210> songs<00:00:21.690> on

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
playing hundreds of popular songs on

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.800 
playing hundreds of popular songs on
guitar<00:00:22.910> during<00:00:23.910> all<00:00:24.090> of<00:00:24.210> this<00:00:24.300> I'm<00:00:24.480> going<00:00:24.660> to

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
guitar during all of this I'm going to

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.870 
guitar during all of this I'm going to
be<00:00:24.900> muting<00:00:25.500> my<00:00:25.650> strings<00:00:25.980> which<00:00:26.189> means<00:00:26.430> I<00:00:26.640> place

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
be muting my strings which means I place

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.939 
be muting my strings which means I place
all<00:00:27.090> four<00:00:27.330> fingers<00:00:27.689> across<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:28.410> strings<00:00:28.710> but

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
all four fingers across the strings but

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.529 
all four fingers across the strings but
I<00:00:29.039> don't<00:00:29.220> apply<00:00:29.430> any<00:00:29.670> pressure<00:00:29.699> I<00:00:30.060> just<00:00:30.330> touch

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
I don't apply any pressure I just touch

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.349 
I don't apply any pressure I just touch
and<00:00:31.320> that<00:00:31.380> gives<00:00:32.219> me<00:00:32.369> a<00:00:32.399> percussive<00:00:33.120> sound

00:00:33.349 --> 00:00:33.359 
and that gives me a percussive sound

00:00:33.359 --> 00:00:35.180 
and that gives me a percussive sound
which<00:00:33.870> allows<00:00:34.139> me<00:00:34.319> to<00:00:34.409> concentrate<00:00:34.620> on

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
which allows me to concentrate on

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.349 
which allows me to concentrate on
learning<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:35.639> strum<00:00:35.909> pattern<00:00:36.239> without

00:00:36.349 --> 00:00:36.359 
learning the strum pattern without

00:00:36.359 --> 00:00:39.139 
learning the strum pattern without
worrying<00:00:36.809> about<00:00:36.960> chord<00:00:37.469> shapes<00:00:37.940> so<00:00:38.940> here's

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
worrying about chord shapes so here's

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.149 
worrying about chord shapes so here's
the<00:00:39.269> first<00:00:39.449> universal<00:00:40.289> strum<00:00:40.530> pattern<00:00:40.859> we're

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:41.159 
the first universal strum pattern we're

00:00:41.159 --> 00:00:42.979 
the first universal strum pattern we're
going<00:00:41.280> to<00:00:41.339> call<00:00:41.489> it<00:00:41.609> strum<00:00:41.879> number<00:00:42.149> one<00:00:42.329> it's

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
going to call it strum number one it's

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:48.680 
going to call it strum number one it's
going<00:00:43.260> down<00:00:44.069> down<00:00:44.460> up<00:00:45.239> up<00:00:45.809> down<00:00:46.649> up<00:00:47.159> I<00:00:47.699> do<00:00:48.420> that

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
going down down up up down up I do that

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.619 
going down down up up down up I do that
once<00:00:48.839> more<00:00:49.079> down<00:00:49.999> down<00:00:50.999> up<00:00:51.269> up<00:00:51.809> down<00:00:52.649> up<00:00:53.629> now

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
once more down down up up down up now

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.479 
once more down down up up down up now
once<00:00:54.809> you<00:00:54.929> get<00:00:55.109> that<00:00:56.809> pattern<00:00:58.190> it's<00:00:59.190> very

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
once you get that pattern it's very

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.340 
once you get that pattern it's very
important<00:00:59.940> to<00:01:00.029> try<00:01:00.179> and<00:01:00.239> cycle<00:01:00.779> it<00:01:00.869> around<00:01:01.170> and

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
important to try and cycle it around and

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.990 
important to try and cycle it around and
around<00:01:01.909> so<00:01:02.909> I<00:01:02.940> slowly<00:01:03.420> would<00:01:03.749> go<00:01:03.929> down<00:01:04.710> down<00:01:05.070> up

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
around so I slowly would go down down up

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.050 
around so I slowly would go down down up
up<00:01:06.390> down<00:01:07.289> up<00:01:07.799> down<00:01:08.250> down<00:01:08.850> up<00:01:09.390> up<00:01:10.170> down<00:01:11.130> up<00:01:11.490> down

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
up down up down down up up down up down

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.639 
up down up down down up up down up down
down<00:01:12.479> up<00:01:13.049> up<00:01:13.799> down<00:01:14.729> up<00:01:15.229> once<00:01:16.229> you<00:01:16.320> get<00:01:16.469> at<00:01:16.590> a

00:01:16.639 --> 00:01:16.649 
down up up down up once you get at a

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:26.050 
down up up down up once you get at a
slow<00:01:16.890> tempo<00:01:16.920> you<00:01:17.490> can<00:01:17.640> try<00:01:17.850> and<00:01:17.969> speed<00:01:18.210> it<00:01:18.329> up

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.060 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.550 

now<00:01:27.060> that's<00:01:27.240> a<00:01:27.359> universal<00:01:27.630> strumming<00:01:28.259> pattern

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
now that's a universal strumming pattern

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.919 
now that's a universal strumming pattern
because<00:01:28.920> you<00:01:29.100> can<00:01:29.280> apply<00:01:29.670> it<00:01:29.729> to<00:01:30.149> hundreds<00:01:30.659> and

00:01:30.919 --> 00:01:30.929 
because you can apply it to hundreds and

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:34.099 
because you can apply it to hundreds and
probably<00:01:31.530> even<00:01:32.130> thousands<00:01:32.789> of<00:01:32.909> songs<00:01:33.780> on

00:01:34.099 --> 00:01:34.109 
probably even thousands of songs on

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:38.239 
probably even thousands of songs on
guitar<00:01:34.520> if<00:01:35.520> I<00:01:35.759> just<00:01:35.969> play<00:01:36.119> say<00:01:36.420> a<00:01:36.960> Cena<00:01:37.499> G<00:01:37.829> over

00:01:38.239 --> 00:01:38.249 
guitar if I just play say a Cena G over

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:39.950 
guitar if I just play say a Cena G over
here<00:01:38.490> with<00:01:38.670> chords<00:01:39.119> we<00:01:39.359> can<00:01:39.509> see<00:01:39.689> how<00:01:39.869> it

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
here with chords we can see how it

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:55.149 
here with chords we can see how it
sounds

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:55.159 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:02:05.740 

Oh

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:07.649 

you

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:07.659 
you

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:10.380 
you
the<00:02:08.649> next<00:02:08.920> Universal<00:02:09.729> strumming<00:02:10.060> pattern

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
the next Universal strumming pattern

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:12.120 
the next Universal strumming pattern
we're<00:02:10.600> going<00:02:10.780> to<00:02:10.840> call<00:02:11.020> strum<00:02:11.410> number<00:02:11.680> two<00:02:11.860> and

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
we're going to call strum number two and

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.820 
we're going to call strum number two and
is<00:02:12.640> slightly<00:02:12.880> longer<00:02:13.319> so<00:02:14.319> for<00:02:14.500> this<00:02:14.560> pattern

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
is slightly longer so for this pattern

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:15.540 
is slightly longer so for this pattern
we're<00:02:15.040> going<00:02:15.069> there

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
we're going there

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:23.040 
we're going there
down<00:02:16.680> down<00:02:17.680> down<00:02:18.040> up<00:02:18.640> up<00:02:18.940> down<00:02:19.330> down<00:02:20.730> down<00:02:22.050> down

down up up down down down down down up
up<00:02:29.800> down<00:02:30.400> now<00:02:31.739> so<00:02:32.739> again<00:02:33.040> the<00:02:33.310> same<00:02:33.489> thing

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
up down now so again the same thing

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.840 
up down now so again the same thing
applies<00:02:34.560> try<00:02:35.560> and<00:02:35.709> speed<00:02:36.010> it<00:02:36.130> up<00:02:36.250> once<00:02:36.580> you<00:02:36.700> get

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
applies try and speed it up once you get

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:48.420 
applies try and speed it up once you get
it<00:02:36.940> at<00:02:37.000> a<00:02:37.060> slow<00:02:37.270> tempo<00:02:45.900> and<00:02:47.100> if<00:02:48.100> you<00:02:48.220> really

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
it at a slow tempo and if you really

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.160 
it at a slow tempo and if you really
want<00:02:48.670> to<00:02:48.760> be<00:02:48.850> cool<00:02:49.090> with<00:02:49.420> the<00:02:49.569> strum<00:02:49.840> put<00:02:50.140> a

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
want to be cool with the strum put a

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.080 
want to be cool with the strum put a
little<00:02:50.470> down<00:02:50.680> up<00:02:50.950> at<00:02:51.160> the<00:02:51.340> end<00:02:51.489> of<00:02:51.610> it<00:02:51.700> as<00:02:51.819> well

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
little down up at the end of it as well

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.650 
little down up at the end of it as well
so<00:02:52.660> that<00:02:52.810> would<00:02:52.930> be<00:02:53.080> down<00:02:53.580> down<00:02:54.580> down<00:02:55.120> up<00:02:55.360> up

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
so that would be down down down up up

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:00.030 
so that would be down down down up up
down<00:02:56.230> down<00:02:56.560> down<00:02:57.310> up<00:02:57.340> down<00:02:57.880> down<00:02:58.440> down<00:02:59.440> up<00:02:59.620> up

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:15.010 
down down down down up up down now okay
so<00:03:06.340> let's<00:03:06.580> put<00:03:06.730> the<00:03:06.819> same<00:03:07.030> chords<00:03:07.510> that<00:03:08.380> strum

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:15.020 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:27.700 

to

again<00:03:44.209> there's<00:03:44.510> a<00:03:44.599> massive<00:03:44.959> amount<00:03:45.379> of<00:03:45.470> songs

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:45.739 
again there's a massive amount of songs

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:48.039 
again there's a massive amount of songs
that<00:03:45.950> you<00:03:46.069> can<00:03:46.250> play<00:03:46.430> using<00:03:46.909> strum<00:03:47.510> number<00:03:47.810> two

00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:48.049 
that you can play using strum number two

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:49.990 
that you can play using strum number two
you<00:03:48.500> can<00:03:48.709> transpose<00:03:49.220> them<00:03:49.519> it<00:03:49.670> requires

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
you can transpose them it requires

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.819 
you can transpose them it requires
different<00:03:50.239> tempos<00:03:50.870> different<00:03:51.349> styles

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:51.829 
different tempos different styles

everything there Universal strums

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:58.089 
everything there Universal strums
because<00:03:55.069> they're<00:03:55.310> so<00:03:55.939> widely<00:03:56.689> used<00:03:57.409> across<00:03:57.680> an

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:02.900 
the final Universal scrum we're going to

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:04.869 
the final Universal scrum we're going to
show<00:04:03.049> you<00:04:03.109> now<00:04:03.319> is<00:04:03.560> a<00:04:03.799> strum<00:04:04.129> number<00:04:04.400> three<00:04:04.700> and

00:04:04.869 --> 00:04:04.879 
show you now is a strum number three and

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:06.940 
show you now is a strum number three and
it's<00:04:05.390> the<00:04:05.599> shortest<00:04:06.049> of<00:04:06.200> our<00:04:06.379> strums<00:04:06.709> it

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:06.950 
it's the shortest of our strums it

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:12.069 
it's the shortest of our strums it
simply<00:04:07.579> goes<00:04:07.790> down<00:04:08.709> down<00:04:09.709> down<00:04:10.280> up<00:04:10.519> and<00:04:11.079> that's

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:12.079 
simply goes down down down up and that's

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:15.250 
simply goes down down down up and that's
it<00:04:12.260> down<00:04:13.180> now

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:15.260 
it down now

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.199 
it down now
now<00:04:15.769> when<00:04:15.950> you<00:04:16.039> cycle<00:04:16.310> it<00:04:16.609> around<00:04:16.850> you<00:04:17.030> might

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:17.209 
now when you cycle it around you might

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:19.229 
now when you cycle it around you might
find<00:04:17.449> it<00:04:17.600> a<00:04:17.660> little<00:04:17.840> bit<00:04:18.019> tricky<00:04:18.289> at<00:04:18.470> first

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:19.239 
find it a little bit tricky at first

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:24.969 
find it a little bit tricky at first
let's<00:04:20.239> try<00:04:20.479> it<00:04:20.539> down<00:04:21.460> now<00:04:22.520> now<00:04:23.030> pop<00:04:23.360> down<00:04:23.979> now

00:04:24.969 --> 00:04:24.979 
let's try it down now now pop down now

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:32.020 
let's try it down now now pop down now
now<00:04:25.580> pop<00:04:25.940> down<00:04:26.590> now<00:04:27.590> now<00:04:28.190> pop<00:04:28.520> down<00:04:29.139> now<00:04:31.030> so

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.030 
now pop down now now pop down now so

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:34.689 
now pop down now now pop down now so
putting<00:04:32.419> our<00:04:32.720> same<00:04:33.350> chords<00:04:33.860> to<00:04:34.190> strum<00:04:34.460> number

00:04:34.689 --> 00:04:34.699 
putting our same chords to strum number

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:53.270 
putting our same chords to strum number
three<00:04:34.970> would<00:04:35.270> be

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:53.280 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:55.710 

again<00:04:54.280> enormous<00:04:54.910> amount<00:04:55.180> of<00:04:55.210> songs<00:04:55.420> that<00:04:55.570> you

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:55.720 
again enormous amount of songs that you

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:07.540 
again enormous amount of songs that you
can<00:04:55.870> play<00:04:56.050> using<00:04:56.560> strum<00:04:57.040> number<00:04:57.310> three

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:07.550 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:10.580 

now<00:05:08.550> I've<00:05:08.669> kind<00:05:08.910> of<00:05:08.970> gone<00:05:09.210> quickly<00:05:09.870> through

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:10.590 
now I've kind of gone quickly through

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:12.230 
now I've kind of gone quickly through
these<00:05:10.770> strum<00:05:11.340> patterns<00:05:11.699> because<00:05:11.970> I<00:05:12.060> don't

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:12.240 
these strum patterns because I don't

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.120 
these strum patterns because I don't
have<00:05:12.360> a<00:05:12.419> whole<00:05:12.630> other<00:05:12.780> time<00:05:13.110> on<00:05:13.319> these<00:05:13.800> our

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:14.130 
have a whole other time on these our

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:17.450 
have a whole other time on these our
introductory<00:05:14.849> homepage<00:05:15.630> videos<00:05:16.080> but<00:05:16.860> inside

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:17.460 
introductory homepage videos but inside

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:20.480 
introductory homepage videos but inside
the<00:05:18.330> guitar<00:05:18.479> course<00:05:18.930> I<00:05:19.110> go<00:05:19.319> into<00:05:19.650> them<00:05:19.889> in<00:05:20.039> much

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:20.490 
the guitar course I go into them in much

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:22.339 
the guitar course I go into them in much
greater<00:05:20.520> detail<00:05:21.030> and<00:05:21.539> we<00:05:21.780> do<00:05:21.930> lots<00:05:22.169> of

00:05:22.339 --> 00:05:22.349 
greater detail and we do lots of

00:05:22.349 --> 00:05:24.499 
greater detail and we do lots of
drilling<00:05:22.770> in<00:05:22.889> exercises<00:05:23.639> to<00:05:23.819> perfect<00:05:24.300> them

00:05:24.499 --> 00:05:24.509 
drilling in exercises to perfect them

00:05:24.509 --> 00:05:26.930 
drilling in exercises to perfect them
but<00:05:25.349> basically<00:05:25.740> now<00:05:26.039> you<00:05:26.069> have<00:05:26.370> the<00:05:26.520> second

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:26.940 
but basically now you have the second

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:29.540 
but basically now you have the second
part<00:05:27.150> of<00:05:27.330> the<00:05:27.479> equation<00:05:27.960> so<00:05:28.410> on<00:05:28.919> one<00:05:29.130> side<00:05:29.160> we

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:29.550 
part of the equation so on one side we

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:31.430 
part of the equation so on one side we
have<00:05:29.580> our<00:05:29.910> chords<00:05:30.419> contained<00:05:31.020> within<00:05:31.229> the

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:31.440 
have our chords contained within the

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:33.800 
have our chords contained within the
context<00:05:32.009> of<00:05:32.099> keys<00:05:32.400> and<00:05:32.729> also<00:05:33.150> the<00:05:33.389> use<00:05:33.539> of<00:05:33.690> our

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:33.810 
context of keys and also the use of our

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:36.320 
context of keys and also the use of our
guitar<00:05:34.229> capo<00:05:34.680> and<00:05:34.860> on<00:05:35.550> the<00:05:35.699> other<00:05:35.819> side<00:05:36.120> we
