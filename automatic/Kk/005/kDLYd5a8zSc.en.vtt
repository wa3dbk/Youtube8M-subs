00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
broken texture what we've done is first

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.220 
broken texture what we've done is first
of<00:00:28.769> all<00:00:28.859> started<00:00:29.490> with<00:00:29.640> prepping<00:00:30.119> the<00:00:30.240> hair<00:00:30.449> so

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
of all started with prepping the hair so

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.920 
of all started with prepping the hair so
we've<00:00:31.830> actually<00:00:32.450> saturated<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.570> hair<00:00:33.719> with<00:00:33.899> a

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
we've actually saturated the hair with a

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.840 
we've actually saturated the hair with a
lot<00:00:34.260> of<00:00:34.290> product<00:00:34.800> to<00:00:34.920> begin<00:00:35.040> with<00:00:35.430> so<00:00:35.730> we've

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
lot of product to begin with so we've

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.240 
lot of product to begin with so we've
worked<00:00:36.030> with<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:36.420> extra-strong<00:00:36.960> mousse<00:00:37.260> also

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
worked with the extra-strong mousse also

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.610 
worked with the extra-strong mousse also
working<00:00:38.489> with<00:00:38.700> the<00:00:38.940> volume<00:00:39.360> foam<00:00:39.690> and<00:00:40.020> the

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
working with the volume foam and the

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.290 
working with the volume foam and the
reason<00:00:41.010> that<00:00:41.040> we've<00:00:41.250> used<00:00:41.550> these<00:00:41.940> two

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
reason that we've used these two

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.299 
reason that we've used these two
products<00:00:42.780> together<00:00:42.930> is<00:00:43.410> because<00:00:43.559> working<00:00:44.219> on

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
products together is because working on

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.000 
products together is because working on
a<00:00:44.340> shoot<00:00:44.760> we<00:00:45.450> need<00:00:45.629> to<00:00:45.780> really<00:00:46.050> maximize<00:00:46.410> an

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
a shoot we need to really maximize an

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.729 
a shoot we need to really maximize an
exaggerated<00:00:47.820> texture<00:00:48.539> and<00:00:48.690> volume<00:00:48.750> and<00:00:49.649> we

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
exaggerated texture and volume and we

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.670 
exaggerated texture and volume and we
also<00:00:49.950> applied<00:00:50.550> curl<00:00:51.210> spray<00:00:51.420> this<00:00:52.379> has<00:00:52.649> a

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
also applied curl spray this has a

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.040 
also applied curl spray this has a
humidity<00:00:53.340> formula<00:00:54.030> which<00:00:54.180> helps<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.750> steps

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
humidity formula which helps the steps

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.410 
humidity formula which helps the steps
and<00:00:55.260> hold<00:00:55.530> curls<00:00:55.949> so<00:00:56.640> after<00:00:57.000> applying<00:00:57.090> the

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
and hold curls so after applying the

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.090 
and hold curls so after applying the
product<00:00:57.780> we<00:00:57.930> then<00:00:58.079> just<00:00:58.289> power<00:00:58.530> dried<00:00:58.890> the

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
product we then just power dried the

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.209 
product we then just power dried the
hair<00:00:59.129> to<00:00:59.910> exaggerate<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:00.989> shape<00:01:01.289> and<00:01:01.620> to

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
hair to exaggerate the shape and to

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.579 
hair to exaggerate the shape and to
produce<00:01:02.430> more<00:01:02.940> volume<00:01:03.390> and<00:01:03.660> more<00:01:03.899> movement<00:01:04.470> we

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
produce more volume and more movement we

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.130 
produce more volume and more movement we
then<00:01:04.799> worked<00:01:05.100> with<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.460> tongue<00:01:05.790> so<00:01:06.780> what<00:01:07.020> we

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
then worked with the tongue so what we

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.700 
then worked with the tongue so what we
did<00:01:07.320> was<00:01:07.560> go<00:01:07.770> through<00:01:08.159> section<00:01:08.700> by<00:01:09.030> section

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710 
did was go through section by section

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.620 
did was go through section by section
working<00:01:10.710> with<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.430> label<00:01:11.760> and<00:01:11.850> hair<00:01:12.180> spray

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
working with the label and hair spray

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.190 
working with the label and hair spray
and<00:01:12.930> then<00:01:13.409> utilizing<00:01:14.130> your<00:01:14.460> tongue<00:01:14.790> to<00:01:15.330> wrap

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
and then utilizing your tongue to wrap

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.260 
and then utilizing your tongue to wrap
and<00:01:16.500> coil<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:17.159> hair<00:01:17.369> around<00:01:17.700> so<00:01:18.150> we're

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
and coil the hair around so we're

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.499 
and coil the hair around so we're
actually<00:01:18.420> producing<00:01:18.780> maximum<00:01:19.470> volume

00:01:20.499 --> 00:01:20.509 
actually producing maximum volume

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:23.690 
actually producing maximum volume
maximum<00:01:21.509> movement<00:01:21.720> within<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:23.040> shape<00:01:23.460> and

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
maximum movement within the shape and

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.359 
maximum movement within the shape and
the<00:01:23.790> end<00:01:23.939> results<00:01:24.509> we<00:01:25.229> then<00:01:25.439> started<00:01:25.830> working

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
the end results we then started working

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.969 
the end results we then started working
with<00:01:26.580> some<00:01:27.000> filet<00:01:27.330> balem<00:01:27.659> polish<00:01:28.140> it's<00:01:28.799> a

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
with some filet balem polish it's a

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.090 
with some filet balem polish it's a
lightweight<00:01:29.450> solid<00:01:30.450> serum<00:01:30.900> and<00:01:31.409> what<00:01:31.740> we<00:01:31.860> did

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
lightweight solid serum and what we did

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.550 
lightweight solid serum and what we did
was<00:01:32.280> soften<00:01:32.850> it<00:01:32.939> into<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.420> hands<00:01:33.869> and<00:01:34.020> then

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
was soften it into the hands and then

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.380 
was soften it into the hands and then
working<00:01:34.860> it<00:01:35.220> through<00:01:35.250> just<00:01:35.909> onto<00:01:36.119> the

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
working it through just onto the

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.420 
working it through just onto the
Midlands<00:01:36.840> and<00:01:37.049> end<00:01:37.350> so<00:01:37.680> we're<00:01:37.829> creating<00:01:38.070> a

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
Midlands and end so we're creating a

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.340 
Midlands and end so we're creating a
really<00:01:38.729> beautiful<00:01:39.210> separation<00:01:39.930> within<00:01:40.140> the

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
really beautiful separation within the

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.920 
really beautiful separation within the
end<00:01:40.470> results<00:01:41.040> from<00:01:41.880> there<00:01:42.119> I<00:01:42.150> then<00:01:42.450> started

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
end results from there I then started

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.380 
end results from there I then started
working<00:01:43.380> with<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.740> shine<00:01:44.009> mist<00:01:44.399> this<00:01:45.149> was

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
working with the shine mist this was

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.780 
working with the shine mist this was
just<00:01:45.600> sprayed<00:01:45.960> through<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:46.799> hair<00:01:47.040> lifting

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
just sprayed through the hair lifting

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.300 
just sprayed through the hair lifting
the<00:01:48.180> hair<00:01:48.360> section<00:01:48.689> by<00:01:48.899> section<00:01:49.110> to<00:01:49.799> work<00:01:49.979> it

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
the hair section by section to work it

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.130 
the hair section by section to work it
through<00:01:50.579> the<00:01:50.700> underneath<00:01:51.240> and<00:01:51.570> through<00:01:51.960> the

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
through the underneath and through the

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.740 
through the underneath and through the
surface<00:01:52.649> of<00:01:52.829> the<00:01:52.979> hair<00:01:53.159> the<00:01:54.000> added<00:01:54.210> benefit<00:01:54.720> of

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
surface of the hair the added benefit of

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.740 
surface of the hair the added benefit of
the<00:01:55.350> label<00:01:55.680> M<00:01:55.770> showing<00:01:56.310> Miz's<00:01:56.610> that<00:01:56.969> it<00:01:57.060> has<00:01:57.210> UV

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
the label M showing Miz's that it has UV

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.810 
the label M showing Miz's that it has UV
filters<00:01:58.439> so<00:01:59.009> it<00:01:59.130> gives<00:01:59.340> you<00:01:59.460> that<00:01:59.579> added

protection<00:02:00.090> in<00:02:00.630> the<00:02:00.750> hair<00:02:00.930> we<00:02:01.409> finally<00:02:01.860> worked

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
protection in the hair we finally worked

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.780 
protection in the hair we finally worked
with<00:02:02.340> the<00:02:02.430> dry<00:02:02.670> shampoo

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:03.790 
with the dry shampoo

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:06.060 
with the dry shampoo
now<00:02:03.970> the<00:02:04.030> dry<00:02:04.420> shampoo<00:02:04.930> is<00:02:05.080> normally<00:02:05.620> thought

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:06.070 
now the dry shampoo is normally thought

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.120 
now the dry shampoo is normally thought
of<00:02:06.130> as<00:02:06.400> being<00:02:06.670> used<00:02:07.030> to<00:02:07.420> refresh<00:02:07.990> shapes<00:02:08.680> or

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.130 
of as being used to refresh shapes or

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:12.060 
of as being used to refresh shapes or
refresh<00:02:09.610> finishes<00:02:10.300> in<00:02:10.570> this<00:02:11.140> instance<00:02:11.770> what

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.070 
refresh finishes in this instance what

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:14.700 
refresh finishes in this instance what
it<00:02:12.190> was<00:02:12.310> actually<00:02:12.700> doing<00:02:12.910> for<00:02:13.270> me<00:02:13.480> is<00:02:13.960> building

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:14.710 
it was actually doing for me is building

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:16.680 
it was actually doing for me is building
a<00:02:14.800> little<00:02:15.130> bit<00:02:15.310> more<00:02:15.520> volume<00:02:15.700> and<00:02:16.270> a<00:02:16.300> little

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
a little bit more volume and a little

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.840 
a little bit more volume and a little
bit<00:02:16.870> more<00:02:17.080> texture<00:02:17.500> in<00:02:17.620> supporting<00:02:18.370> the<00:02:18.550> roots

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
bit more texture in supporting the roots

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.210 
bit more texture in supporting the roots
so<00:02:19.480> we<00:02:19.630> can<00:02:19.840> really<00:02:20.050> really<00:02:20.350> elaborate<00:02:20.920> and

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
so we can really really elaborate and

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.200 
so we can really really elaborate and
exaggerate<00:02:21.910> the<00:02:22.030> shape<00:02:22.330> and<00:02:22.540> the<00:02:22.750> texture
