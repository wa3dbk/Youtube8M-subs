do like the first impressions I guess of

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.379 
do like the first impressions I guess of
GTA<00:00:09.570> online<00:00:09.860> that's<00:00:10.860> if<00:00:11.190> it<00:00:11.429> works<00:00:11.730> because<00:00:12.210> I

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
GTA online that's if it works because I

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:14.990 
GTA online that's if it works because I
played<00:00:12.780> it<00:00:12.929> online<00:00:13.259> for<00:00:13.769> a<00:00:13.830> tiny<00:00:14.370> bit<00:00:14.639> earlier

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
played it online for a tiny bit earlier

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.010 
played it online for a tiny bit earlier
and<00:00:15.240> it<00:00:15.900> worked<00:00:16.139> perfectly<00:00:16.789> but<00:00:17.810> for<00:00:18.810> some

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
and it worked perfectly but for some

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.019 
and it worked perfectly but for some
reason<00:00:19.410> now<00:00:19.619> it<00:00:19.980> just<00:00:20.010> doesn't<00:00:20.640> want<00:00:20.760> to<00:00:20.820> work

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
reason now it just doesn't want to work

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.060 
reason now it just doesn't want to work
but<00:00:21.390> I<00:00:21.810> know<00:00:22.230> this<00:00:22.380> is<00:00:22.529> how<00:00:22.590> you<00:00:22.650> create<00:00:22.890> your

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
but I know this is how you create your

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.200 
but I know this is how you create your
character<00:00:23.310> it's<00:00:23.660> really<00:00:25.369> really<00:00:26.369> stupid<00:00:26.730> in

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
character it's really really stupid in

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.330 
character it's really really stupid in
my<00:00:27.269> opinion<00:00:27.590> they<00:00:28.590> there<00:00:28.800> is<00:00:28.890> no<00:00:29.039> need<00:00:29.279> for

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
my opinion they there is no need for

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.849 
my opinion they there is no need for
this<00:00:29.670> because<00:00:30.240> you<00:00:30.660> could<00:00:30.960> like<00:00:31.260> you<00:00:31.410> sell<00:00:31.619> you

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
this because you could like you sell you

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.310 
this because you could like you sell you
find<00:00:32.160> your<00:00:33.030> grandparent<00:00:33.840> and<00:00:34.050> then<00:00:34.200> you'll

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
find your grandparent and then you'll

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.860 
find your grandparent and then you'll
customize<00:00:34.559> your<00:00:35.100> your<00:00:35.550> mum<00:00:35.910> and<00:00:36.030> dad<00:00:36.300> to<00:00:36.690> make
