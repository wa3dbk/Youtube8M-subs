00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
really he's got a really interesting

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.120 
really he's got a really interesting
quality<00:01:45.659> about<00:01:46.320> being<00:01:46.590> really<00:01:46.860> young<00:01:47.100> and

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
quality about being really young and

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.510 
quality about being really young and
youthful<00:01:47.549> and<00:01:48.229> bendy<00:01:49.229> and<00:01:49.530> but<00:01:50.009> also<00:01:50.220> having

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
youthful and bendy and but also having

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.270 
youthful and bendy and but also having
this<00:01:50.610> really

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
this really

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.490 
this really
sure<00:01:52.460> why<00:01:52.909> is<00:01:52.970> this<00:01:53.180> about<00:01:53.450> them<00:01:53.659> as<00:01:53.780> well<00:01:53.960> and

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
I think that's something that he can

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:58.990 
I think that's something that he can
take<00:01:56.930> forwards<00:01:57.380> into<00:01:57.710> any<00:01:58.040> role<00:01:58.340> and<00:01:58.640> you<00:01:58.909> know
