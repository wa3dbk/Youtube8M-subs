afterward<00:00:02.409> okay<00:00:03.409> I'd<00:00:03.709> like<00:00:03.860> to<00:00:04.009> talk<00:00:04.160> about

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:04.220 
afterward okay I'd like to talk about

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:10.060 
afterward okay I'd like to talk about
the<00:00:04.700> f-word<00:00:05.620> f-word<00:00:06.620> is<00:00:06.770> flex<00:00:08.290> in<00:00:09.290> my<00:00:09.559> opinion

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:10.070 
the f-word f-word is flex in my opinion

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:12.190 
the f-word f-word is flex in my opinion
in<00:00:10.190> my<00:00:10.340> belief<00:00:10.700> is<00:00:11.120> that<00:00:11.179> the<00:00:11.690> amount<00:00:12.019> of

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:12.200 
in my belief is that the amount of

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.940 
in my belief is that the amount of
flexing<00:00:12.679> aboard<00:00:12.980> is<00:00:13.280> not<00:00:13.639> as<00:00:13.940> important<00:00:14.599> as

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:14.950 
flexing aboard is not as important as

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:20.620 
flexing aboard is not as important as
how<00:00:15.950> that<00:00:16.820> flex<00:00:18.070> comes<00:00:19.070> back<00:00:19.519> or<00:00:19.910> the<00:00:20.060> cyclical

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:20.630 
how that flex comes back or the cyclical

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:23.890 
how that flex comes back or the cyclical
rate<00:00:20.900> the<00:00:21.740> harmonic<00:00:22.340> vibration<00:00:23.150> of<00:00:23.420> a<00:00:23.630> board

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:23.900 
rate the harmonic vibration of a board

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.679 
rate the harmonic vibration of a board
that's<00:00:24.410> the<00:00:24.619> most<00:00:24.769> important<00:00:25.279> part<00:00:25.490> to<00:00:25.820> that

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:26.689 
that's the most important part to that

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:29.259 
that's the most important part to that
and<00:00:27.019> I<00:00:27.320> have<00:00:27.679> come<00:00:27.920> up<00:00:27.949> with<00:00:28.130> a<00:00:28.699> new

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:29.269 
and I have come up with a new

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:33.040 
and I have come up with a new
construction<00:00:31.000> what<00:00:32.000> this<00:00:32.210> construction<00:00:32.720> is

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:33.050 
construction what this construction is

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:42.060 
construction what this construction is
is<00:00:33.880> bamboo<00:00:34.880> on<00:00:35.090> the<00:00:35.180> bottom<00:00:38.500> cork<00:00:39.500> on<00:00:39.710> the<00:00:39.770> top

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:42.070 
is bamboo on the bottom cork on the top

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:46.450 
is bamboo on the bottom cork on the top
this<00:00:43.070> board<00:00:43.340> has<00:00:43.400> carbon<00:00:43.880> fiber<00:00:44.270> rails<00:00:45.460> some

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:46.460 
this board has carbon fiber rails some

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.510 
this board has carbon fiber rails some
some<00:00:46.970> of<00:00:47.120> this<00:00:47.440> type<00:00:48.440> of<00:00:48.470> construction<00:00:48.890> does

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:49.520 
some of this type of construction does

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.320 
some of this type of construction does
have<00:00:49.790> carbon<00:00:50.240> some<00:00:50.750> doesn't<00:00:52.150> what<00:00:53.150> this

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:53.330 
have carbon some doesn't what this

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:57.150 
have carbon some doesn't what this
construction<00:00:54.080> offers<00:00:54.710> is<00:00:55.040> is<00:00:55.760> that<00:00:56.150> the

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:57.160 
construction offers is is that the

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.030 
construction offers is is that the
bottom<00:00:58.160> of<00:00:58.280> the<00:00:58.430> board<00:00:58.640> the<00:00:59.150> bamboo<00:01:00.040> has

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:01.040 
bottom of the board the bamboo has

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.760 
bottom of the board the bamboo has
really<00:01:01.700> high<00:01:01.940> tensile<00:01:02.330> strength<00:01:02.870> it's<00:01:03.470> very

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:03.770 
really high tensile strength it's very

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:14.560 
really high tensile strength it's very
difficult<00:01:04.220> to<00:01:04.400> break<00:01:04.699> it<00:01:04.970> this<00:01:05.239> way

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.620 

the<00:01:15.110> top<00:01:15.380> of<00:01:15.590> the<00:01:15.680> board<00:01:15.860> has<00:01:16.130> a<00:01:16.160> cork<00:01:16.610> which<00:01:17.450> is

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:17.630 
the top of the board has a cork which is

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.650 
the top of the board has a cork which is
really<00:01:18.080> good<00:01:18.380> under<00:01:18.920> compression<00:01:19.580> you<00:01:20.480> can

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:20.660 
really good under compression you can

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:23.770 
really good under compression you can
imagine<00:01:20.930> that<00:01:21.260> a<00:01:21.320> wine<00:01:21.650> cork<00:01:22.780> compresses

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780 
imagine that a wine cork compresses

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:24.730 
imagine that a wine cork compresses
really<00:01:24.200> well

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
really well

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.880 
really well
comes<00:01:25.250> back<00:01:25.370> nice<00:01:25.820> and<00:01:25.850> slow<00:01:26.330> I'm<00:01:27.020> looking<00:01:27.560> for

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890 
comes back nice and slow I'm looking for

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.140 
comes back nice and slow I'm looking for
that<00:01:28.070> slow<00:01:28.970> come<00:01:29.510> back<00:01:30.730> boards<00:01:31.730> that<00:01:31.910> feel

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:32.150 
that slow come back boards that feel

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:35.740 
that slow come back boards that feel
ping-pong<00:01:32.900> volley<00:01:33.400> are<00:01:34.400> boards<00:01:35.090> that<00:01:35.330> that

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:35.750 
ping-pong volley are boards that that

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.890 
ping-pong volley are boards that that
flex<00:01:36.590> that<00:01:37.010> goes<00:01:37.220> in<00:01:37.490> comes<00:01:38.060> back<00:01:38.300> really<00:01:38.570> fast

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:38.900 
flex that goes in comes back really fast

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.880 
flex that goes in comes back really fast
kicks<00:01:39.560> you<00:01:39.740> off<00:01:39.979> kicks<00:01:40.460> you<00:01:40.610> out<00:01:40.850> of<00:01:41.030> a<00:01:41.090> turn

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:41.890 
kicks you off kicks you out of a turn

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.360 
kicks you off kicks you out of a turn
this<00:01:42.890> cork<00:01:43.400> comes<00:01:43.790> back<00:01:44.090> real<00:01:44.510> slow<00:01:45.340> nice<00:01:46.340> and

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:46.370 
this cork comes back real slow nice and

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:49.120 
this cork comes back real slow nice and
slow<00:01:46.670> so<00:01:47.180> the<00:01:47.360> human<00:01:47.750> reaction<00:01:48.380> time<00:01:48.590> can't

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
slow so the human reaction time can't

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:54.249 
slow so the human reaction time can't
absorb<00:01:49.850> it<00:01:52.210> the<00:01:53.210> other<00:01:53.360> thing<00:01:53.630> is<00:01:53.869> is<00:01:54.229> that

00:01:54.249 --> 00:01:54.259 
absorb it the other thing is is that

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:58.050 
absorb it the other thing is is that
this<00:01:54.860> construction<00:01:55.990> even<00:01:56.990> though<00:01:57.320> it<00:01:57.530> is<00:01:57.680> as
