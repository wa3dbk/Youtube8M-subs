00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
but he did use it once and I like that

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.469

I<00:02:15.160> don't<00:02:15.400> know<00:02:15.520> if<00:02:15.580> it's<00:02:15.819> just<00:02:16.120> gotten<00:02:16.620> sanded

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
I don't know if it's just gotten sanded

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.650 
I don't know if it's just gotten sanded
or<00:02:17.770> stuck<00:02:18.220> or<00:02:18.430> maybe<00:02:18.580> the<00:02:18.760> springs<00:02:19.239> gotten

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
or stuck or maybe the springs gotten

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.860 
or stuck or maybe the springs gotten
loose<00:02:19.989> over<00:02:20.440> the<00:02:20.560> years<00:02:20.890> but<00:02:21.880> this<00:02:22.330> flips<00:02:22.660> out

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
loose over the years but this flips out

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.990 
loose over the years but this flips out
and<00:02:23.080> that'll<00:02:23.290> form<00:02:23.560> is<00:02:23.680> gun<00:02:24.010> in<00:02:24.640> a<00:02:25.680> robot<00:02:26.680> mode

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
and that'll form is gun in a robot mode

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.229 
and that'll form is gun in a robot mode
if<00:02:28.000> you<00:02:28.470> if<00:02:29.470> you<00:02:29.560> push<00:02:29.800> on<00:02:30.040> it<00:02:30.310> push<00:02:31.090> the

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:12.249 
I lost the photon blaster or whatever it

00:04:12.249 --> 00:04:17.310 
I lost the photon blaster or whatever it
was<00:04:12.280> called<00:04:12.489> and<00:04:13.319> so<00:04:14.319> it<00:04:15.129> really<00:04:15.989> doesn't<00:04:16.989> stay

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:17.320 
was called and so it really doesn't stay

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.529 
was called and so it really doesn't stay
in<00:04:17.350> very<00:04:17.709> well<00:04:17.889> so<00:04:18.100> I<00:04:18.130> usually<00:04:18.489> just<00:04:18.549> leave<00:04:19.389> it

repair arm medic thing which I always
liked<00:04:30.940> better<00:04:31.240> than<00:04:31.509> the<00:04:31.630> photon<00:04:32.080> blaster<00:04:32.620> is

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:32.740 
liked better than the photon blaster is

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:34.200 
liked better than the photon blaster is
the<00:04:32.770> arm<00:04:33.039> anyway<00:04:33.370> because<00:04:33.699> i<00:04:33.849> think<00:04:34.120> the

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.210 
the arm anyway because i think the
