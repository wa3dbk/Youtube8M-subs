00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
here there's an after event so I have to

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.560 
here there's an after event so I have to
roll<00:02:19.290> another<00:02:19.470> die<00:02:19.790> to<00:02:20.790> see<00:02:20.970> if<00:02:21.120> I<00:02:21.240> have<00:02:21.390> to

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
roll another die to see if I have to

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:24.430 
roll another die to see if I have to
roll<00:02:21.780> again<00:02:22.110> and<00:02:22.880> unfortunately<00:02:23.880> I<00:02:23.910> do

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
roll again and unfortunately I do

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.580 
roll again and unfortunately I do
so<00:02:25.440> I'll<00:02:25.920> roll<00:02:26.190> again<00:02:26.460> on<00:02:26.670> the<00:02:26.790> event<00:02:27.090> table<00:02:27.590> at

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
so I'll roll again on the event table at
