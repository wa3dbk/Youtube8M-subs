00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
has requested that I show the seeker

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:12.169 
has requested that I show the seeker
missile<00:00:10.950> because<00:00:11.280> I<00:00:11.309> haven't<00:00:11.580> showed<00:00:11.910> it<00:00:12.090> in

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
missile because I haven't showed it in

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.299 
missile because I haven't showed it in
any<00:00:12.300> of<00:00:12.450> my<00:00:12.570> other<00:00:12.660> videos<00:00:13.080> so<00:00:13.769> I'm<00:00:13.889> just<00:00:14.070> doing

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
any of my other videos so I'm just doing

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.510 
any of my other videos so I'm just doing
a<00:00:14.429> game<00:00:14.670> against<00:00:15.240> the<00:00:16.109> very<00:00:16.289> easy<00:00:16.650> AI<00:00:16.980> here

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
a game against the very easy AI here

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.700 
a game against the very easy AI here
I've<00:00:17.699> gotten<00:00:18.000> a<00:00:18.060> few<00:00:18.090> Ravens<00:00:18.720> now<00:00:19.350> the<00:00:19.410> thing

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
I've gotten a few Ravens now the thing

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.099 
I've gotten a few Ravens now the thing
is<00:00:19.740> you<00:00:20.100> can't<00:00:20.340> really<00:00:20.550> rush<00:00:21.029> this<00:00:21.390> strategy<00:00:22.080> I

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
is you can't really rush this strategy I

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.279 
is you can't really rush this strategy I
I<00:00:22.560> discussed<00:00:23.100> it<00:00:23.250> with<00:00:23.279> him<00:00:23.490> a<00:00:23.550> little<00:00:23.880> bit<00:00:24.029> and

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:24.289 
I discussed it with him a little bit and

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:27.650 
I discussed it with him a little bit and
the<00:00:25.289> thing<00:00:25.500> is<00:00:25.880> they<00:00:26.880> can't<00:00:27.180> be<00:00:27.359> rushed

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
the thing is they can't be rushed

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.880 
the thing is they can't be rushed
because<00:00:29.779> you<00:00:30.779> need<00:00:30.990> to<00:00:31.140> not<00:00:31.289> only<00:00:31.500> get<00:00:31.740> the

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
because you need to not only get the

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.830 
because you need to not only get the
starport<00:00:32.489> but<00:00:32.880> you<00:00:32.969> have<00:00:33.149> to<00:00:33.329> get<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.600> tech

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
starport but you have to get the tech

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.170 
starport but you have to get the tech
lab<00:00:34.140> then<00:00:35.040> you<00:00:35.280> have<00:00:35.460> to<00:00:35.640> throw<00:00:35.850> down<00:00:35.969> the

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
lab then you have to throw down the

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.270 
lab then you have to throw down the
fusion<00:00:36.630> core<00:00:36.870> which<00:00:37.230> is<00:00:37.410> a<00:00:37.440> hundred<00:00:37.860> and<00:00:37.980> fifty

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
fusion core which is a hundred and fifty

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.180 
fusion core which is a hundred and fifty
minerals<00:00:38.670> and<00:00:38.820> 150<00:00:39.660> gas<00:00:39.870> then<00:00:40.590> you<00:00:40.860> have<00:00:41.040> to

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
minerals and 150 gas then you have to

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.270 
minerals and 150 gas then you have to
upgrade<00:00:41.450> the<00:00:42.450> seeker<00:00:42.840> missile<00:00:43.260> in<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.800> tech

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
upgrade the seeker missile in the tech

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.180 
upgrade the seeker missile in the tech
lab<00:00:44.309> which<00:00:44.879> is<00:00:44.910> 150<00:00:45.660> minerals<00:00:45.989> 150<00:00:46.500> gas<00:00:46.680> so

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
lab which is 150 minerals 150 gas so

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.250 
lab which is 150 minerals 150 gas so
it's<00:00:47.340> kind<00:00:47.579> of<00:00:47.670> a<00:00:47.760> later<00:00:48.120> play<00:00:48.719> it's<00:00:49.050> not

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
it's kind of a later play it's not

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.170 
it's kind of a later play it's not
something<00:00:49.440> you<00:00:49.620> can<00:00:49.739> rush<00:00:50.039> early<00:00:50.399> on<00:00:50.430> but

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
something you can rush early on but

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.360 
something you can rush early on but
anyway<00:00:51.510> I've<00:00:51.660> handful<00:00:52.260> of<00:00:52.320> raisin<00:00:52.829> Ravens

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
anyway I've handful of raisin Ravens

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.540 
anyway I've handful of raisin Ravens
here<00:00:53.579> now<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.239> seeker<00:00:54.719> missile<00:00:55.050> is<00:00:55.550> 125

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
here now the seeker missile is 125

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.360 
here now the seeker missile is 125
energy<00:00:57.120> to<00:00:57.270> use<00:00:57.629> it<00:00:58.289> says<00:00:58.590> it<00:00:58.710> chases<00:00:59.190> its

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
energy to use it says it chases its

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.520 
energy to use it says it chases its
target<00:00:59.850> down<00:01:00.059> and<00:01:00.329> has<00:01:00.449> enough<00:01:00.750> fuel<00:01:00.899> for<00:01:00.989> 15

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
target down and has enough fuel for 15

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.939 
target down and has enough fuel for 15
seconds<00:01:02.010> deals<00:01:02.520> up<00:01:02.760> to<00:01:03.059> 100<00:01:03.750> area<00:01:04.080> damage<00:01:04.320> if

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
seconds deals up to 100 area damage if

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.980 
seconds deals up to 100 area damage if
it<00:01:05.100> doesn't<00:01:05.430> sound<00:01:05.610> very<00:01:05.939> good<00:01:06.090> but<00:01:06.600> I<00:01:06.900> guess

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
it doesn't sound very good but I guess

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.530 
it doesn't sound very good but I guess
against<00:01:07.470> group

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:08.540 
against group

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.840 
against group
a<00:01:08.570> group<00:01:09.020> of<00:01:09.200> hydras<00:01:10.160> and<00:01:10.190> stuff<00:01:10.610> it<00:01:10.760> would

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
a group of hydras and stuff it would

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:12.610 
a group of hydras and stuff it would
work<00:01:11.000> well<00:01:11.240> but<00:01:11.510> I<00:01:11.570> think<00:01:11.630> against<00:01:12.380> later

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:12.620 
work well but I think against later

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:15.730 
work well but I think against later
ganger<00:01:13.160> that's<00:01:13.430> like<00:01:13.580> Thor's<00:01:13.940> colossi<00:01:14.930> things

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:15.740 
ganger that's like Thor's colossi things

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.550 
ganger that's like Thor's colossi things
like<00:01:15.920> that<00:01:16.070> it<00:01:16.310> wouldn't<00:01:16.550> be<00:01:16.640> too<00:01:16.880> good<00:01:17.320> but<00:01:18.320> it

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
like that it wouldn't be too good but it

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.410 
like that it wouldn't be too good but it
could<00:01:18.740> be<00:01:18.890> used<00:01:19.100> for<00:01:19.220> working<00:01:19.670> harassment<00:01:20.240> so

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 
could be used for working harassment so

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.810 
could be used for working harassment so
let's<00:01:20.630> see<00:01:20.780> how<00:01:20.810> well<00:01:21.080> it<00:01:21.170> does<00:01:21.430> I'm<00:01:22.430> also

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820 
let's see how well it does I'm also

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.660 
let's see how well it does I'm also
aware<00:01:23.120> that<00:01:23.360> it<00:01:23.780> shoots<00:01:24.050> air<00:01:24.350> so<00:01:25.100> you<00:01:25.190> can<00:01:25.430> use

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
aware that it shoots air so you can use

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:27.220 
aware that it shoots air so you can use
it<00:01:25.700> against<00:01:26.030> muta<00:01:26.420> lists<00:01:26.750> and<00:01:26.900> things<00:01:27.080> like

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:27.230 
it against muta lists and things like

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:29.140 
it against muta lists and things like
that<00:01:27.290> I<00:01:27.680> think<00:01:28.130> it's<00:01:28.280> going<00:01:28.729> to<00:01:28.820> be<00:01:29.030> an

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:29.150 
that I think it's going to be an

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.290 
that I think it's going to be an
effective<00:01:29.479> tool<00:01:29.930> against<00:01:30.620> the<00:01:30.920> zerg<00:01:31.460> but<00:01:32.090> not

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:32.300 
effective tool against the zerg but not

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.980 
effective tool against the zerg but not
so<00:01:32.600> much<00:01:32.810> Protoss<00:01:33.760> perhaps<00:01:34.760> Terran<00:01:35.390> marine

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
so much Protoss perhaps Terran marine

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:37.780 
so much Protoss perhaps Terran marine
and<00:01:36.229> monitor<00:01:36.680> you<00:01:36.950> can<00:01:37.100> use<00:01:37.280> it<00:01:37.310> against<00:01:37.700> them

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:37.790 
and monitor you can use it against them

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.380 
and monitor you can use it against them
but<00:01:38.660> because<00:01:39.050> it's<00:01:39.500> 125<00:01:40.100> energy<00:01:40.700> you<00:01:41.119> can<00:01:41.270> only

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
but because it's 125 energy you can only

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.440 
but because it's 125 energy you can only
shoot<00:01:41.630> one<00:01:42.020> per<00:01:42.380> raven<00:01:42.920> which<00:01:43.580> I'm<00:01:43.790> surprised

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
shoot one per raven which I'm surprised

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.300 
shoot one per raven which I'm surprised
they<00:01:44.600> didn't<00:01:44.869> make<00:01:44.960> it<00:01:45.020> 100<00:01:45.830> but<00:01:46.040> I<00:01:46.070> guess

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
they didn't make it 100 but I guess

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.850 
they didn't make it 100 but I guess
shooting<00:01:46.670> two<00:01:46.970> at<00:01:47.390> a<00:01:47.420> time<00:01:47.570> would<00:01:48.020> be<00:01:48.050> too

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:48.860 
shooting two at a time would be too

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.580 
shooting two at a time would be too
overpowered<00:01:49.550> so<00:01:49.910> already<00:01:50.840> I'm<00:01:51.050> not<00:01:51.259> liking

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
overpowered so already I'm not liking

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.290 
overpowered so already I'm not liking
where<00:01:51.830> this<00:01:51.979> is<00:01:52.130> going<00:01:52.580> but<00:01:52.610> let's<00:01:53.060> see<00:01:53.270> what

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:53.300 
where this is going but let's see what

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.300 
where this is going but let's see what
it<00:01:53.509> does<00:01:53.690> let's<00:01:53.960> see<00:01:54.050> if<00:01:54.290> it<00:01:54.440> does<00:01:54.650> damage<00:01:55.160> to

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
it does let's see if it does damage to

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.850 
it does let's see if it does damage to
buildings<00:01:55.670> here<00:01:56.180> and<00:01:56.540> you<00:01:57.170> cannot<00:01:57.530> target

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
buildings here and you cannot target

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.690 
buildings here and you cannot target
that<00:01:58.220> it<00:01:58.340> so<00:01:58.520> target<00:01:59.030> lien<00:01:59.240> fester<00:02:00.400> and<00:02:01.400> there

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
that it so target lien fester and there

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:06.070 
that it so target lien fester and there
it<00:02:01.820> goes<00:02:01.850> ok<00:02:02.690> so<00:02:03.050> one<00:02:03.560> shots<00:02:03.920> and<00:02:04.280> fester<00:02:05.080> one

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:06.080 
it goes ok so one shots and fester one

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.410 
it goes ok so one shots and fester one
shots<00:02:06.410> of<00:02:06.590> Hydra<00:02:07.070> there's<00:02:07.580> kind<00:02:07.790> of<00:02:07.880> a<00:02:07.970> delay

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
shots of Hydra there's kind of a delay

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.120 
shots of Hydra there's kind of a delay
as<00:02:08.660> you<00:02:08.780> can<00:02:08.959> see<00:02:09.170> it<00:02:09.290> shoots

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
as you can see it shoots

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.330 
as you can see it shoots
it's<00:02:11.670> going<00:02:12.330> going<00:02:12.690> and<00:02:13.200> you<00:02:13.860> don't<00:02:14.040> even<00:02:14.130> get

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
it's going going and you don't even get

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.140 
it's going going and you don't even get
vision<00:02:14.880> of<00:02:15.090> the<00:02:15.360> area<00:02:16.310> kind<00:02:17.310> of<00:02:17.430> looks<00:02:17.910> like<00:02:18.030> a

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
vision of the area kind of looks like a

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.610 
vision of the area kind of looks like a
long<00:02:18.540> delay<00:02:19.050> before<00:02:19.710> it<00:02:20.150> does<00:02:21.150> anything<00:02:21.620> but

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
long delay before it does anything but

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.340 
long delay before it does anything but
it<00:02:22.740> does<00:02:23.010> look<00:02:23.040> like<00:02:23.430> it<00:02:23.580> does<00:02:23.790> Splash<00:02:24.240> Damage

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.350 
it does look like it does Splash Damage

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:30.830 
it does look like it does Splash Damage
area<00:02:25.350> of<00:02:25.410> effect<00:02:25.530> damage<00:02:25.920> so<00:02:26.520> let's<00:02:26.730> see<00:02:29.840> takes

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
area of effect damage so let's see takes

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.420 
area of effect damage so let's see takes
at<00:02:31.020> least<00:02:31.050> two<00:02:31.560> to<00:02:31.800> kill<00:02:32.010> clean<00:02:33.950> let's<00:02:34.950> see<00:02:35.130> how

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
at least two to kill clean let's see how

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.880 
at least two to kill clean let's see how
it<00:02:35.460> does<00:02:35.610> against

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:42.309 

wait<00:02:40.100> a<00:02:40.130> bit<00:02:40.400> get<00:02:40.670> some<00:02:40.700> energy<00:02:40.970> back

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:42.319 
wait a bit get some energy back

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:54.990 
wait a bit get some energy back
two

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.979 

have<00:02:55.480> not<00:02:55.750> addressed

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
have not addressed

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:03.690 
have not addressed
so<00:02:59.340> as<00:03:00.340> you<00:03:00.609> can<00:03:00.790> see<00:03:01.090> it's<00:03:01.980> not<00:03:02.980> as<00:03:03.189> effective

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
so as you can see it's not as effective

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.330 
so as you can see it's not as effective
as<00:03:03.819> I<00:03:03.939> thought<00:03:04.120> it<00:03:04.299> was<00:03:04.359> going<00:03:04.569> to<00:03:04.629> be<00:03:04.840> here

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
as I thought it was going to be here

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.289 
as I thought it was going to be here
prophecy<00:03:06.340> was<00:03:06.370> suggesting<00:03:06.999> would<00:03:07.090> be<00:03:07.269> a

00:03:07.289 --> 00:03:07.299 
prophecy was suggesting would be a

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:09.899 
prophecy was suggesting would be a
really<00:03:07.590> interesting<00:03:08.590> idea<00:03:09.099> to<00:03:09.249> rush<00:03:09.519> for<00:03:09.790> them

00:03:09.899 --> 00:03:09.909 
really interesting idea to rush for them

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:12.089 
really interesting idea to rush for them
or<00:03:10.090> here<00:03:10.719> I<00:03:10.749> have<00:03:10.989> more<00:03:11.290> let's<00:03:11.560> see<00:03:11.709> if<00:03:11.769> it<00:03:11.920> does

00:03:12.089 --> 00:03:12.099 
or here I have more let's see if it does

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:17.270 
or here I have more let's see if it does
splash<00:03:12.489> damage<00:03:12.790> against

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:24.479 

there<00:03:18.280> was<00:03:18.370> nothing<00:03:18.579> besides<00:03:23.069> this<00:03:24.069> is<00:03:24.219> kind

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:24.489 
there was nothing besides this is kind

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:26.369 
there was nothing besides this is kind
of<00:03:24.549> frustrating<00:03:24.730> because<00:03:25.359> the<00:03:25.569> computer<00:03:26.019> AI

00:03:26.369 --> 00:03:26.379 
of frustrating because the computer AI

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:28.319 
of frustrating because the computer AI
kind<00:03:27.010> of<00:03:27.099> sucks<00:03:27.430> he<00:03:27.640> doesn't<00:03:27.879> really<00:03:28.030> have

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:28.329 
kind of sucks he doesn't really have

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:31.110 
kind of sucks he doesn't really have
anything<00:03:28.659> halfway<00:03:29.609> there's<00:03:30.609> a<00:03:30.700> couple<00:03:30.939> of

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
anything halfway there's a couple of

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:32.429 
anything halfway there's a couple of
minutes<00:03:31.239> together<00:03:31.629> let's<00:03:32.079> see<00:03:32.290> how<00:03:32.409> it

00:03:32.429 --> 00:03:32.439 
minutes together let's see how it

00:03:32.439 --> 00:03:36.929 
minutes together let's see how it
doesn't<00:03:32.889> means<00:03:33.040> that<00:03:34.829> it<00:03:35.829> is<00:03:35.859> area<00:03:36.730> of<00:03:36.819> effect

00:03:36.929 --> 00:03:36.939 
doesn't means that it is area of effect

00:03:36.939 --> 00:03:39.240 
doesn't means that it is area of effect
so<00:03:37.450> it<00:03:37.540> does<00:03:37.750> hit<00:03:37.989> all<00:03:38.139> of<00:03:38.170> them<00:03:38.409> so<00:03:38.920> anyway

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
so it does hit all of them so anyway

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:42.030 
so it does hit all of them so anyway
that's<00:03:39.519> the<00:03:39.760> secret<00:03:40.090> missile<00:03:40.569> for<00:03:40.810> you<00:03:40.989> as<00:03:41.859> you

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
that's the secret missile for you as you

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.459 
that's the secret missile for you as you
can<00:03:42.189> see<00:03:42.370> that<00:03:42.639> ninety<00:03:43.329> health<00:03:43.569> it<00:03:43.750> died<00:03:43.989> so<00:03:44.379> it

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:44.469 
can see that ninety health it died so it

00:03:44.469 --> 00:03:46.860 
can see that ninety health it died so it
does<00:03:44.650> a<00:03:44.680> hundred<00:03:45.129> damage<00:03:45.549> I'm<00:03:46.180> not<00:03:46.389> bad<00:03:46.659> you

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
does a hundred damage I'm not bad you

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.649 
does a hundred damage I'm not bad you
cannot<00:03:47.349> target<00:03:47.739> buildings<00:03:48.370> I'm<00:03:48.970> curious<00:03:49.269> if

00:03:49.649 --> 00:03:49.659 
cannot target buildings I'm curious if

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:51.509 
cannot target buildings I'm curious if
it<00:03:49.810> will<00:03:49.959> damage<00:03:50.260> buildings<00:03:51.040> though<00:03:51.280> if<00:03:51.400> you

00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:51.519 
it will damage buildings though if you

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:53.699 
it will damage buildings though if you
shooting<00:03:51.909> at<00:03:52.239> these<00:03:52.419> beside<00:03:52.900> the<00:03:53.200> lawyers<00:03:53.560> of

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:53.709 
shooting at these beside the lawyers of

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:58.470 
shooting at these beside the lawyers of
us<00:03:56.340> yes<00:03:57.340> well<00:03:57.639> the<00:03:57.730> layer<00:03:57.939> is<00:03:58.150> a<00:03:58.180> little

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480 
us yes well the layer is a little

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.050 
us yes well the layer is a little
damaged<00:03:58.900> and<00:03:59.139> so<00:03:59.409> is<00:03:59.590> the<00:03:59.799> extractor<00:04:00.370> so<00:04:00.939> it

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060 
damaged and so is the extractor so it

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.470 
damaged and so is the extractor so it
does<00:04:01.329> do<00:04:01.689> damage<00:04:02.169> to<00:04:02.200> buildings<00:04:02.530> and<00:04:03.480> that's

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:04.480 
does do damage to buildings and that's

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.839 
does do damage to buildings and that's
