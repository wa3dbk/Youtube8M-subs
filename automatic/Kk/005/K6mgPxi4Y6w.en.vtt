00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:21.150
 Hello today on thl v8 review 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.920
 Biont this smartphone 9 millimeters 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.130
 thick 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:29.220
 151 grams made of plastic can be 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.689
 two colors white and graphite this 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.360
 the case of graphite and me personally more 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:37.559
 I like this color 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:38.880
 fingerprints seize well 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.010
 on the screen and on a glossy surface 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:44.879
 covers 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:48.050
 let's turn it on it turns on but 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:51.980
 very long unlike in 200 of you there 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:55.289
 there is also such a bumper 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:01:05.010
 the book is also made in the same 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:07.680
 colors and so the screen is 5 inches on my 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:10.830
 the most optimal view to 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:13.229
 fit in the hand and it was possible 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.340
 quietly surf the internet or 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.340
 watch films 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:20.670
 and of course the games on this smartphone 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:23.150
 it will look great colors pretty 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:29.580
 clear 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:31.800
 saturated viewing angle are excellent let's 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:35.070
 let's see the performance 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:36.480
 here he gave me 15,500 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.560
 a thousand less than that 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:42.980
 200 of the smartphone's firmware version 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:49.650
 android 4 2 1 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:53.100
 1000 x 544 mp2 graphics processor 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:55.320
 horse screens device memory 4 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:59.930
 gigabyte internal 10 with the possibility 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:07.530
 solutions up to 64 gigabytes ram 1 gigabyte 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:11.610
 mtk mt65xx processor model so right now 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:15.750
 it's a half gigahertz density 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:17.000
 480 pixels rear camera 13 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.999
 megapixels 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:24.140
 good enough frontally again 

00:02:19.999 --> 00:02:28.400
 will be great when chatting on Skype 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.400
 let's see the work dynamics 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:03:00.510
 they deliver quite clearly and loudly 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:03:00.510
 I personally I would have him on a padded jacket 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:11.810
 Well, actually the work of this smartphone 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:12.430
 no battery brakes 2000 milliampere 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.319
 o'clock 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:19.190
 what is enough for five hundred and forty minutes of voice 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:22.090
 chat or 480 hours standby 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:24.470
 spare battery available 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:28.489
 principle of long hikes can 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:31.489
 bail out and so the price of this unit 288 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:33.830
 dollars great smartphone 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:38.209
 relatively inexpensive I recommend to 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:41.680
 buying on it i have all thanks for 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:41.680
