00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:06.100
 welcome to the east end college bunschoten 

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:09.450
 the entrepreneur the school and with that in mind the students had class 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.659
 a project week for a number of months 

00:00:11.659 --> 00:00:14.829
 entrepreneurial project reynders 

00:00:14.829 --> 00:00:17.900
 but then what is an entrepreneurial project work 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.610
 the students are challenged to continue during this project week 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:23.349
 look through field research through collaboration 

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:26.349
 to get a better picture of business 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.509
 maybe my teachers play better 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:33.509
 when the count 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.080
 6 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.890
 as sixth 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.780
 no 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:13.690
 and maybe inspiring words in your pocket money is the song 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:16.930
 but i think i know where to be 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:17.730
 and what you want 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:21.200
 the bottom goes 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.320
 how much if the media project group 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.229
 it is on the other side of the operation entering the dutch institute 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:29.360
 for image and sound in Hilversum 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.360
 and a bit of media, of course, wanted to do it themselves 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:45.770
 9 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.110

 10 the road to bunschoten when it is resistant to building 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.299
 researchers have them as if these ladies are gentlemen 2 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.780
 have 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.680
 the rest there is no question 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.909
 very first race is done carefully 

00:02:09.909 --> 00:02:11.199
 there can be 

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:12.369
 the field 

00:02:12.369 --> 00:02:13.579
 there is important 

00:02:13.579 --> 00:02:16.579
 we get 

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:21.199
 the area 

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:25.489
 the scottish project group has been pregnant thereby having the environment of 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:26.689
 street furniture 

00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:29.449
 like those very black guys 

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:32.219
 after 

00:02:32.219 --> 00:02:35.189

00:02:37.119 --> 00:02:38.229
 via email

 presentation style the pressure created by judges who still have unknown men 

00:02:42.889 --> 00:02:45.889
 and made because of her schoolwork points 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:50.519
 media law complies with the finishing touches 

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:54.279
 and then the time has come 

00:02:54.279 --> 00:02:58.209
 everything points to a clearly visible backwards and it is not deductible 

00:02:58.949 --> 00:03:01.949
 most people are at the door again 

00:03:04.509 --> 00:03:09.089
 the auditorium of the east and it is raining full of people a pilot project 

00:03:09.089 --> 00:03:12.089
 media attracts full halls 

00:03:14.999 --> 00:03:17.999

00:03:31.749 --> 00:03:32.570
 9 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:35.570
 and in the roadside what do you think of the work of these young people 

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:38.179
 morello 

00:03:38.179 --> 00:03:42.579

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:43.299
 House 

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:46.299
