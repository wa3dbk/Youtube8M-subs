00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:34.970 
one it was now and once the canadian

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:36.939 
one it was now and once the canadian
dollar<00:05:35.000> got<00:05:35.660> higher<00:05:35.900> I<00:05:35.930> kind<00:05:36.410> of<00:05:36.470> dropped<00:05:36.680> it

00:05:36.939 --> 00:05:36.949 
dollar got higher I kind of dropped it

00:05:36.949 --> 00:05:39.610
