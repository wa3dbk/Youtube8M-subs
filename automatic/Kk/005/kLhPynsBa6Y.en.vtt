minecraft tutorial today we are going

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.720 
minecraft tutorial today we are going
over<00:00:04.859> mobs<00:00:05.850> despawning<00:00:06.950> once<00:00:07.950> the<00:00:08.189> chunks

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
over mobs despawning once the chunks

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.390 
over mobs despawning once the chunks
unload<00:00:09.300> so<00:00:10.110> for<00:00:10.320> example<00:00:10.740> you<00:00:10.889> have<00:00:11.040> a<00:00:11.070> zombie

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
unload so for example you have a zombie

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.509 
unload so for example you have a zombie
summoned<00:00:12.269> you<00:00:12.840> get<00:00:13.080> out<00:00:13.259> of<00:00:13.410> the<00:00:13.500> chunk<00:00:13.740> range

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
summoned you get out of the chunk range

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.260 
summoned you get out of the chunk range
the<00:00:15.450> chunk<00:00:15.839> that<00:00:15.900> the<00:00:16.139> zombie<00:00:16.500> is<00:00:16.590> in<00:00:17.270> despond

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
the chunk that the zombie is in despond

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.390 
the chunk that the zombie is in despond
the<00:00:18.779> zombie<00:00:19.170> is<00:00:19.289> gone<00:00:19.529> when<00:00:19.800> you<00:00:19.890> go<00:00:20.039> back<00:00:20.250> to

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
the zombie is gone when you go back to

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.580 
the zombie is gone when you go back to
the<00:00:20.490> chunk<00:00:20.789> and<00:00:21.029> it's<00:00:21.630> a<00:00:21.750> very<00:00:21.930> simple<00:00:22.380> way<00:00:22.560> to

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
the chunk and it's a very simple way to

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.310 
the chunk and it's a very simple way to
prevent<00:00:23.160> this<00:00:23.400> from<00:00:23.580> happening<00:00:24.050> through<00:00:25.050> this

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
prevent this from happening through this

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.320 
prevent this from happening through this
someone<00:00:25.619> just<00:00:25.769> commands<00:00:26.550> so<00:00:26.910> we<00:00:27.029> have<00:00:27.119> 2

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
someone just commands so we have 2

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.570 
someone just commands so we have 2
zombies<00:00:27.750> here<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.410> one<00:00:28.619> on<00:00:28.769> the<00:00:28.890> left<00:00:29.130> does

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
zombies here the one on the left does

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.170 
zombies here the one on the left does
not<00:00:29.910> have<00:00:31.130> the<00:00:32.130> special<00:00:32.550> thing<00:00:32.820> you<00:00:32.969> put<00:00:33.149> in

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
not have the special thing you put in

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.600 
not have the special thing you put in
here<00:00:33.510> it's<00:00:34.350> just<00:00:34.410> a<00:00:34.620> summons<00:00:34.980> Amba<00:00:35.280> command

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
here it's just a summons Amba command

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.270 
here it's just a summons Amba command
and<00:00:35.820> this<00:00:36.090> one<00:00:36.300> does<00:00:36.660> so<00:00:37.020> if<00:00:37.710> you<00:00:37.800> look<00:00:37.980> in<00:00:38.129> here

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
and this one does so if you look in here

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.709 
and this one does so if you look in here
very<00:00:38.550> closely<00:00:39.649> persistence<00:00:40.649> required<00:00:41.280> 1<00:00:42.059> so

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
very closely persistence required 1 so

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.540 
very closely persistence required 1 so
that<00:00:42.870> means<00:00:42.930> that<00:00:43.649> that<00:00:43.829> entity<00:00:44.280> will<00:00:44.520> be

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
that means that that entity will be

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.690 
that means that that entity will be
there<00:00:44.969> when<00:00:45.690> we<00:00:45.870> come<00:00:46.110> back<00:00:46.350> ok<00:00:47.280> so<00:00:47.309> we've<00:00:47.670> got

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
there when we come back ok so we've got

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.910 
there when we come back ok so we've got
our<00:00:47.850> two<00:00:48.090> zombies<00:00:48.300> they<00:00:49.230> are<00:00:49.379> both<00:00:49.649> standing

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
our two zombies they are both standing

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.920 
our two zombies they are both standing
there<00:00:50.309> and<00:00:51.050> let's<00:00:52.050> fly<00:00:52.620> away<00:00:53.420> out<00:00:54.420> of<00:00:54.780> the

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
there and let's fly away out of the

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.720 
there and let's fly away out of the
chunk<00:00:55.170> range<00:00:55.410> so<00:00:55.829> we're<00:00:55.980> going<00:00:56.070> to<00:00:56.129> go<00:00:56.250> back<00:00:56.430> to

that<00:01:29.100> we<00:01:29.220> gave<00:01:29.400> persistence<00:01:30.119> required<00:01:30.720> to<00:01:31.110> and

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640 
that we gave persistence required to and

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.819 
that we gave persistence required to and
look<00:01:32.640> that<00:01:33.329> zombies<00:01:33.810> gone<00:01:34.020> but<00:01:34.439> this<00:01:34.590> one

to keep hostile entities in chunks that

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.660 
to keep hostile entities in chunks that
are<00:01:45.229> generated<00:01:46.229> and<00:01:46.439> then<00:01:47.009> loaded<00:01:47.549> and

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
are generated and then loaded and

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.760
