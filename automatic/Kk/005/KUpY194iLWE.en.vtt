purely<00:01:30.840> because<00:01:30.960> they're<00:01:31.200> closer<00:01:31.409> range<00:01:31.650> I

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
purely because they're closer range I

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.580 
purely because they're closer range I
didn't<00:01:32.009> see<00:01:32.100> that<00:01:32.130> guy<00:01:32.400> sauna<00:01:33.590> interesting

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
didn't see that guy sauna interesting

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.940 
didn't see that guy sauna interesting
and<00:01:35.390> so<00:01:36.390> what<00:01:36.780> we're<00:01:37.049> using<00:01:37.259> a<00:01:37.470> gun<00:01:37.770> that's

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
and so what we're using a gun that's

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.710 
and so what we're using a gun that's
great<00:01:38.220> close<00:01:38.460> range<00:01:38.759> that<00:01:39.360> means<00:01:39.540> you<00:01:39.600> can

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
great close range that means you can

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.300 
great close range that means you can
rush<00:01:39.869> into<00:01:40.020> enemy<00:01:40.350> spawn<00:01:40.650> you<00:01:40.860> can<00:01:40.979> be<00:01:41.070> close

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
rush into enemy spawn you can be close

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.100 
rush into enemy spawn you can be close
to<00:01:41.460> them<00:01:41.579> and<00:01:41.790> by<00:01:41.909> being<00:01:42.479> close<00:01:42.570> to<00:01:42.810> them<00:01:42.960> and

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
to them and by being close to them and

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.690 
to them and by being close to them and
killing<00:01:43.290> them<00:01:43.409> from<00:01:44.100> a<00:01:44.130> close<00:01:44.310> friend<00:01:44.610> you

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
killing them from a close friend you

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.130 
killing them from a close friend you
have<00:01:44.850> a<00:01:44.909> much<00:01:45.090> more<00:01:45.270> higher<00:01:45.540> chance<00:01:45.869> of

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
have a much more higher chance of

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.510 
have a much more higher chance of
letting<00:01:46.439> those<00:01:46.680> stacks<00:01:46.920> of<00:01:47.070> using<00:01:47.340> something

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
letting those stacks of using something

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.870 
letting those stacks of using something
like<00:01:47.610> a<00:01:48.030> sniper<00:01:48.689> rifle<00:01:48.899> nmg<00:01:49.649> time<00:01:50.130> I<00:01:50.250> five<00:01:50.520> a<00:01:50.549> CI

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
like a sniper rifle nmg time I five a CI

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.370 
like a sniper rifle nmg time I five a CI
maybe<00:01:51.270> kill<00:01:51.450> him<00:01:51.570> a<00:01:51.600> bit<00:01:51.780> further<00:01:52.020> across<00:01:52.200> the

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
maybe kill him a bit further across the

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.780 
maybe kill him a bit further across the
map<00:01:52.560> and<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:52.860> chance<00:01:53.070> of<00:01:53.189> you<00:01:53.250> getting<00:01:53.549> that

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
map and the chance of you getting that

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.850 
map and the chance of you getting that
tag<00:01:54.149> there<00:01:54.299> will<00:01:54.390> be<00:01:54.509> much<00:01:54.720> much<00:01:54.930> slower<00:01:55.110> of

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
tag there will be much much slower of

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.620 
tag there will be much much slower of
course<00:01:56.070> that's<00:01:56.189> the<00:01:56.310> jet<00:01:56.969> to<00:01:57.060> risk<00:01:57.210> of<00:01:57.420> this

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
course that's the jet to risk of this

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.420 
course that's the jet to risk of this
game<00:01:57.810> mode<00:01:57.990> so<00:01:58.170> it's<00:01:58.320> it's<00:01:59.040> definitely<00:01:59.340> the

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
game mode so it's it's definitely the

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.149 
game mode so it's it's definitely the
way<00:01:59.520> to<00:01:59.549> go<00:01:59.729> is<00:02:00.149> using<00:02:00.810> a<00:02:01.049> shotgun<00:02:01.829> up<00:02:02.070> the

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
way to go is using a shotgun up the

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.130 
way to go is using a shotgun up the
strike<00:02:02.430> which<00:02:02.670> is<00:02:02.820> the<00:02:03.119> fantastic<00:02:03.479> companion

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140

striker you blink you'll confirm

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.509 
striker you blink you'll confirm
especially<00:02:50.200> on<00:02:50.260> a<00:02:50.290> map<00:02:50.440> like<00:02:50.590> dome<00:02:50.829> it<00:02:51.040> worked

00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:51.519 
especially on a map like dome it worked

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:53.880 
especially on a map like dome it worked
out<00:02:51.640> really<00:02:51.700> well<00:02:51.879> but<00:02:52.720> some<00:02:52.959> if<00:02:53.590> you<00:02:53.650> want<00:02:53.739> to

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
out really well but some if you want to

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:54.960 
out really well but some if you want to
rank<00:02:53.980> it<00:02:54.099> really<00:02:54.280> quickly<00:02:54.489> then<00:02:54.640> use

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:18.220 
I lose all three of those tags because

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:19.800 
I lose all three of those tags because
the<00:04:18.370> enemy<00:04:18.489> would<00:04:18.729> decline<00:04:19.120> and<00:04:19.389> deny<00:04:19.780> them

of<00:04:22.360> being<00:04:22.479> plus<00:04:22.719> three<00:04:23.050> would<00:04:23.380> be<00:04:23.409> minus<00:04:23.710> one

00:04:24.089 --> 00:04:24.099 
of being plus three would be minus one

00:04:24.099 --> 00:04:26.250 
of being plus three would be minus one

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:41.710 
because you'll die so much and

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:44.100 
because you'll die so much and
ultimately<00:04:42.070> you<00:04:42.520> won't<00:04:42.730> be<00:04:42.910> doing<00:04:43.600> as<00:04:43.900> well<00:04:44.050> as

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:46.720 
you may be thinking however do go tags

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.110 
you may be thinking however do go tags

in a good situation we're not going to
die<00:04:50.680> quite<00:04:50.980> as<00:04:51.070> much<00:04:51.280> but<00:04:52.030> still<00:04:52.180> be

aggressive<00:04:52.870> it<00:04:53.080> was<00:04:53.620> the<00:04:53.800> way<00:04:53.890> I<00:04:53.920> like<00:04:54.100> to<00:04:54.130> play

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:54.340 
aggressive it was the way I like to play

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:57.810 
aggressive it was the way I like to play
now<00:04:55.300> third<00:04:55.510> of<00:04:55.630> all<00:04:55.690> want<00:04:55.960> to<00:04:56.020> talk<00:04:56.170> about<00:04:56.640> is<00:04:57.640> a

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:57.820 
now third of all want to talk about is a

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:59.070 
now third of all want to talk about is a
cheap<00:04:58.090> tacit<00:04:58.450> you<00:04:58.510> can<00:04:58.600> use<00:04:58.720> if<00:04:58.840> you<00:04:58.900> want<00:04:58.930> to

00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.080 
cheap tacit you can use if you want to

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:00.540 
cheap tacit you can use if you want to
rank<00:04:59.200> it<00:04:59.320> really<00:04:59.500> quickly<00:04:59.680> us<00:04:59.860> using<00:05:00.190> takn

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:00.550 
rank it really quickly us using takn

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:03.270 
rank it really quickly us using takn
surgeons<00:05:01.060> and<00:05:01.360> because<00:05:01.810> basically<00:05:02.020> if<00:05:02.800> you

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:03.280 
surgeons and because basically if you

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.460 
surgeons and because basically if you
die<00:05:03.520> you<00:05:03.850> obviously<00:05:04.480> drop<00:05:04.630> a<00:05:04.660> tag<00:05:04.930> and<00:05:05.140> if<00:05:05.230> you

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:05.470 
die you obviously drop a tag and if you

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:08.250 
die you obviously drop a tag and if you
decline<00:05:06.010> your<00:05:06.070> own<00:05:06.400> tank<00:05:06.790> you<00:05:06.970> get<00:05:07.090> plus<00:05:07.330> 250

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:08.260 
decline your own tank you get plus 250

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.800 
decline your own tank you get plus 250
which<00:05:08.590> is<00:05:08.680> the<00:05:08.770> same<00:05:08.890> as<00:05:09.120> collecting<00:05:10.120> five

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:10.810 
which is the same as collecting five

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:13.440 
which is the same as collecting five
normal<00:05:11.110> tags<00:05:11.410> are<00:05:11.560> getting<00:05:11.740> five<00:05:11.980> kills<00:05:12.340> so<00:05:13.240> if

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:13.450 
normal tags are getting five kills so if

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:15.120 
normal tags are getting five kills so if
you<00:05:13.540> takn<00:05:13.960> surgeons<00:05:14.440> at<00:05:14.560> the<00:05:14.650> shoot<00:05:14.920> in<00:05:15.100> the

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:15.130 
you takn surgeons at the shoot in the

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:17.430 
you takn surgeons at the shoot in the
air<00:05:15.250> or<00:05:15.520> something<00:05:15.730> like<00:05:15.790> that<00:05:15.850> and<00:05:16.270> you<00:05:17.200> die

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:17.440 
air or something like that and you die

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:18.960 
air or something like that and you die
as<00:05:17.680> soon<00:05:17.710> as<00:05:17.950> you<00:05:18.010> spawn<00:05:18.250> your<00:05:18.400> spawn<00:05:18.700> on<00:05:18.850> your

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:18.970 
as soon as you spawn your spawn on your

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:21.180 
as soon as you spawn your spawn on your
tag<00:05:19.180> meaning<00:05:19.510> it<00:05:19.630> plus<00:05:19.990> 250<00:05:20.560> and<00:05:20.890> if<00:05:20.980> you<00:05:21.040> do

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:21.190 
tag meaning it plus 250 and if you do

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:22.830 
tag meaning it plus 250 and if you do
that<00:05:21.340> 10<00:05:21.550> times<00:05:21.820> in<00:05:21.970> the<00:05:22.030> game<00:05:22.240> that's<00:05:22.720> like

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:22.840 
that 10 times in the game that's like

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:24.510 
that 10 times in the game that's like
getting<00:05:22.960> 25<00:05:23.560> kills<00:05:23.860> without<00:05:24.100> getting<00:05:24.370> any

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:24.520 
getting 25 kills without getting any

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:26.700 
getting 25 kills without getting any
kills<00:05:24.790> you<00:05:25.210> had<00:05:25.330> 20<00:05:25.450> times<00:05:25.750> like<00:05:25.960> 50<00:05:26.470> kills

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:26.710 
kills you had 20 times like 50 kills

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:28.440 
kills you had 20 times like 50 kills
that's<00:05:27.370> a<00:05:27.430> cheap<00:05:27.640> tactic<00:05:27.940> if<00:05:28.060> you<00:05:28.150> really<00:05:28.330> want

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:28.450 
that's a cheap tactic if you really want

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:29.850 
that's a cheap tactic if you really want
to<00:05:28.510> rank<00:05:28.600> up<00:05:28.720> quickly<00:05:28.960> and<00:05:29.230> you<00:05:29.620> wanna<00:05:29.770> be

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:47.530 
them but it's basically as possible but

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:48.720 
them but it's basically as possible but
that<00:05:47.590> last<00:05:47.830> point<00:05:48.040> if<00:05:48.220> you<00:05:48.280> didn't<00:05:48.490> get<00:05:48.610> it

that last point if you didn't get it

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:51.420 
that last point if you didn't get it
basically<00:05:49.480> em<00:05:49.720> you<00:05:50.590> have<00:05:50.710> 50<00:05:50.980> points<00:05:51.220> for

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:51.430

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:53.260 
collecting tags and you get 50 points

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.500 
collecting tags and you get 50 points
for<00:05:53.500> a<00:05:53.530> declining<00:05:54.160> tag<00:05:54.460> if<00:05:54.910> you<00:05:55.120> decline<00:05:55.450> your

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:55.510 
for a declining tag if you decline your

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:57.480 
for a declining tag if you decline your
own<00:05:55.810> tag<00:05:56.140> so<00:05:56.320> when<00:05:56.470> you<00:05:56.560> die<00:05:56.710> you<00:05:56.770> drop<00:05:57.070> attack

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:57.490 
own tag so when you die you drop attack

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:00.090 
own tag so when you die you drop attack
if<00:05:57.640> you<00:05:57.730> decline<00:05:57.970> your<00:05:58.030> own<00:05:58.300> one<00:05:58.450> yet<00:05:59.050> plus<00:05:59.320> 250

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:00.100 
if you decline your own one yet plus 250

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:02.340 
if you decline your own one yet plus 250
s<00:06:00.310> less<00:06:00.520> so<00:06:00.700> it's<00:06:00.880> like<00:06:01.030> declining<00:06:01.720> or<00:06:01.960> gaining

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:02.350 
s less so it's like declining or gaining

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:05.160 
s less so it's like declining or gaining
five<00:06:02.710> tags<00:06:03.010> so<00:06:03.790> by<00:06:03.970> using<00:06:04.030> takn<00:06:04.780> surgeons

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:05.170 
five tags so by using takn surgeons

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:06.930 
five tags so by using takn surgeons
