00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:17.490
 To pick up a suitcase and cuia not to return 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.570
 Thank God it turned out the way I did. 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.900
 I wanted the way it was that everyone wanted 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:25.080
 crowd

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.500
 want to waste a lot of time premiere when 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.629
 I sold the pussy 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.040

 paulo a cbf enter recess until friday 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:49.780
 I'm trying to figure out how it 's going there. 

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:52.000
 they will 1 believe the athletic 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.190
 will rush them along with the 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.370
 entrepreneur but I do not think he will 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:01:00.519
 nothing wrong today, it's not back to bh 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:05.710
 We always stick in his tail in return. 

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:08.050
 To go home to spend time, a lot of music. 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:11.050
 anxiety to get to the 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:13.540
 Relaxation is in the review with king 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:15.430
 Very good dad, there's a lot of history. 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:18.430
 Let's see if they are coming already when the 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:20.560
 plane landed and on twitter he saw the 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:25.360
 party outside 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:28.690
 the pack came in every corridor 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:30.789
 he passed it was impossible to walk 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:32.800
 table easier to enter the field in the 

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:35.289
 Today's Third Queen Classic 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:37.990
 Beautiful, it's nice , I already saw the 

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:41.800
 the madness began with the 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:45.819
 employees to pick up the suitcase was 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:46.539
 ground photos and more photos of monsanto 

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:49.420
 emotion 

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:52.319
 after a long time he went to the 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.319
 pasta arms 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:03.049
 I think it's cool on the max pole was the 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:05.479
 idol is a hero of the idol 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:07.340
 eternal is that the athletic today has several 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:09.530
 idols you have ronaldinho gaucho and 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.870
 has Bernardo as he says given a mine of 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.790
 gold tardelli back means a 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.280
 team that for some time only Uncle Max today 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.020
 has three great idols divided né 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.500
 there responsibility is not what it is 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:23.450
 Nice to have you split your 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.400
 responsibilities a departure is decided 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.830
 You give the ball to someone who knows 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.230
 receive a good day in the face of the goal and if 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.360
 a strong team that way I think it will 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:35.330
 arrive at an important moment power 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:37.070
 play shoved like you like suddenly 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.810
 making that game function a little 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:40.459
 more open on the right side 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.590
 The cuca will know in the best way 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:44.480
 use it so it can grow 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:47.110
 along with tim gives to play Diego ball 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.110
 tardelli jô 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:52.489
 I believe it is possible but the cuca 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.750
 will not risk and put both 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:56.989
 I think he will end up choosing between 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:58.459
 Jazz and I think 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:01.010
 that he will push the tardelli to the 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:02.900
 right right there doing that role 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.730
 Suddenly the game in front of me 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:09.019
 I think he's going to make a square and 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:10.430
 ronaldinho bernard 18 the idea of animals 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:13.579
 because if you have a dangerous attacker 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:15.680
 as it is difficult to see the 

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:17.870
 opponent will rain in the city is the 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:19.940
 side will support both he will not 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.620
 need to run far behind that 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:23.450
 sector will be even more ready to 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:25.280
 attack do not think it is possible to play 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:28.160
 adopted in 2009 was 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:30.500
 sensational 2010 was not as good tava 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:33.019
 wanting to get out was negotiated now back 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.549
 It's four years of contract is thinking of 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:36.560
 Brazilian team is thinking about cup 

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:37.910
 of the world has a chance that the felipão will 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.250
 open chances mainly for 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:42.230
 experienced players so I guess 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:44.209
 he has the knife and the cheese in the hand the athlete 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:46.370
 has a great team is the current vice 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:48.680
 Brazilian champion has grace 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:50.930
 liberators was the first game to 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:53.420
 The crowd got to know but it 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:55.790
 analyze a team by a match 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:57.049
 cruise I found it was spectacular the 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:59.180
 athletic was lousy 

00:03:57.049 --> 00:04:00.530
 but neither athletic nor cruise can we 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:02.180
 take a parameter like I said I will 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:03.829
 analyze from April when the 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:05.390
 teams get the team isport the athletic 

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:07.340
 can you see why you're going to get stuck? 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:09.510
 Paul has a liberator, it's for you. 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:11.159
 analyze with a little more discretion 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:12.989
 already the cruise did not take in the 

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:13.739
 brazil championship in the context of the 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:15.720
 classic 

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:17.519
 can not analyze from April 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.440
 but I'm really enjoying the posture of the 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:21.209
 Cruise team that now has group and 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.889
 has bank has team has bank 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:25.470
 hence the athletic to leave with the strength to 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:26.729
 You play well there, tardelli is 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:29.280
 doubt will not have chance in the selection 

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:32.130
 even because the felipão is looking for 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.660
 that missing 9 shirt is missing you 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:35.789
 also did not find it 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:37.560
 so much that damião in that new piece 

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:40.110
 placement was left out 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:42.180
 already faced with luis fabiano then is 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:43.770
 open on that shirt 9 who knows the day 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:45.570
 with a large campaign and can have a 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:49.190
 new opportunity depends on him, right? 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:49.190
 only depends on it just depends on it
