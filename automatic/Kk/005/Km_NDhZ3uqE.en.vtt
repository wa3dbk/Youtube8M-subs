00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:55.450 
around tracks how do you think an SUV is

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:57.210 
around tracks how do you think an SUV is
going<00:00:55.630> to<00:00:55.690> go<00:00:55.810> on<00:00:55.960> a<00:00:55.990> similar<00:00:56.410> surface<00:00:56.620> you

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:57.220 
going to go on a similar surface you

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:58.980 
going to go on a similar surface you
can't<00:00:57.430> really<00:00:57.640> be<00:00:57.760> expecting<00:00:58.180> too<00:00:58.300> much<00:00:58.330> at<00:00:58.900> a

00:00:58.980 --> 00:00:58.990 
can't really be expecting too much at a

can't really be expecting too much at a
racetrack<00:00:59.170> I<00:00:59.620> suppose<00:01:00.100> we<00:01:00.220> better<00:01:00.310> get<00:01:00.520> you

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:00.580 
racetrack I suppose we better get you

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:02.700 
racetrack I suppose we better get you
behind<00:01:01.270> the<00:01:01.360> steering<00:01:01.600> wheel<00:01:01.750> and<00:01:02.020> let<00:01:02.620> you

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:02.710 
behind the steering wheel and let you

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:04.109 
behind the steering wheel and let you
take<00:01:02.860> it<00:01:02.980> out<00:01:03.100> for<00:01:03.220> a<00:01:03.310> spin<00:01:03.460> huh<00:01:03.700> absolutely

00:01:04.109 --> 00:01:04.119 
take it out for a spin huh absolutely

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:10.080 
take it out for a spin huh absolutely
let's<00:01:04.689> do<00:01:04.809> it

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:10.090 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.150 

definitely<00:01:11.090> got<00:01:11.240> a<00:01:11.270> sports<00:01:11.960> car<00:01:12.320> feel<00:01:12.740> about

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:13.160 
definitely got a sports car feel about

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:19.360 
definitely got a sports car feel about
that<00:01:13.370> but<00:01:13.850> turning<00:01:14.210> off<00:01:14.630> center<00:01:18.250> doesn't<00:01:19.250> get

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:19.370 
that but turning off center doesn't get

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:20.920 
that but turning off center doesn't get
that<00:01:19.520> understeer<00:01:20.000> that<00:01:20.240> you'd<00:01:20.360> expect<00:01:20.510> from

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:20.930 
that understeer that you'd expect from

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.250 
that understeer that you'd expect from
an<00:01:21.080> SUV<00:01:21.230> I<00:01:22.450> think<00:01:23.450> we're<00:01:23.570> going<00:01:23.660> to<00:01:23.750> go<00:01:23.870> faster

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:24.260 
an SUV I think we're going to go faster

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:29.050 
an SUV I think we're going to go faster
and<00:01:24.290> faster<00:01:24.440> in<00:01:24.890> this<00:01:25.010> thing<00:01:27.550> so<00:01:28.550> how<00:01:28.700> is<00:01:28.850> that

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060 
and faster in this thing so how is that

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.630 
and faster in this thing so how is that
song<00:01:29.330> like<00:01:30.110> the<00:01:30.260> car<00:01:30.410> was<00:01:30.620> impressive<00:01:31.130> it's

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640 
song like the car was impressive it's

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.150 
song like the car was impressive it's
going<00:01:31.820> to<00:01:31.880> bring<00:01:32.300> chassis<00:01:32.810> and<00:01:32.960> it's<00:01:33.500> agility

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:34.160 
going to bring chassis and it's agility

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:35.860 
going to bring chassis and it's agility
through<00:01:34.370> the<00:01:34.490> corners<00:01:34.910> it<00:01:35.090> feels<00:01:35.540> really

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:35.870 
through the corners it feels really

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:38.440 
through the corners it feels really
positive<00:01:36.320> what<00:01:36.680> I'd<00:01:36.770> like<00:01:36.980> to<00:01:37.130> do<00:01:37.280> is<00:01:37.550> for

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
positive what I'd like to do is for

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.990 
positive what I'd like to do is for
basic<00:01:38.840> tests<00:01:39.310> where<00:01:40.310> we<00:01:40.400> set<00:01:40.580> up<00:01:40.610> some<00:01:40.790> cones

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
basic tests where we set up some cones

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.540 
basic tests where we set up some cones
we<00:01:41.150> need<00:01:41.300> to<00:01:41.420> do<00:01:41.540> a<00:01:41.810> slalom<00:01:42.320> test<00:01:42.710> where<00:01:43.460> we

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:43.550 
we need to do a slalom test where we

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:45.070 
we need to do a slalom test where we
weave<00:01:43.790> in<00:01:44.030> and<00:01:44.150> out<00:01:44.270> to<00:01:44.510> test<00:01:44.720> the<00:01:44.900> the

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:45.080 
weave in and out to test the the

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.710 
weave in and out to test the the
cornering<00:01:45.410> agility<00:01:45.950> and<00:01:46.130> the<00:01:46.190> sharp<00:01:46.490> turns<00:01:46.820> go

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
cornering agility and the sharp turns go

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:48.310 
cornering agility and the sharp turns go
to<00:01:47.780> whoa

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:48.320 
to whoa

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.770 
to whoa
so<00:01:48.580> accelerate<00:01:49.580> up<00:01:49.700> to<00:01:49.729> 100k<00:01:50.210> an<00:01:50.450> hour<00:01:50.600> and

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
so accelerate up to 100k an hour and

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:52.270 
so accelerate up to 100k an hour and
then<00:01:50.870> stop<00:01:51.140> again<00:01:51.380> and<00:01:51.590> then<00:01:51.890> also<00:01:52.130> a

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
then stop again and then also a

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.310 
then stop again and then also a
high-speed<00:01:52.760> corner<00:01:53.150> test<00:01:53.360> to<00:01:53.960> see<00:01:54.140> how

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320 
high-speed corner test to see how

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.410 
high-speed corner test to see how
balanced<00:01:54.920> the<00:01:55.040> car<00:01:55.250> is<00:01:55.430> and<00:01:55.580> how<00:01:55.670> natural<00:01:56.330> it

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
balanced the car is and how natural it

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:16.300 
pretty good but then the stopping

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:17.940

and you know the more steering you gave

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:36.960 
and you know the more steering you gave
it<00:05:34.870> the<00:05:35.020> easier<00:05:35.440> it<00:05:35.470> turns<00:05:35.770> and<00:05:36.100> I<00:05:36.310> was<00:05:36.790> really

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:36.970 
it the easier it turns and I was really

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:39.210 
it the easier it turns and I was really
