I don't know I don't know but you know
it<00:04:31.500> could<00:04:31.650> be<00:04:31.680> true<00:04:31.889> because<00:04:32.010> the<00:04:32.130> airbags<00:04:32.460> are

would<00:04:36.570> that<00:04:36.720> really<00:04:36.960> activate<00:04:37.580> the<00:04:38.580> airbags

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:39.510 
would that really activate the airbags

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:41.150 
would that really activate the airbags
