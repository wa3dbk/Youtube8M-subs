00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:02.730 
not only can you align an image in a

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:04.400 
not only can you align an image in a
single<00:00:03.030> line<00:00:03.149> of<00:00:03.270> text<00:00:03.419> but<00:00:03.689> you<00:00:03.750> can<00:00:03.899> float<00:00:04.230> it

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:04.410 
single line of text but you can float it

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:06.530 
single line of text but you can float it
out<00:00:04.529> in<00:00:04.740> a<00:00:04.799> paragraph<00:00:05.130> and<00:00:05.609> then<00:00:06.089> one<00:00:06.330> way<00:00:06.480> to

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
out in a paragraph and then one way to

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.530 
out in a paragraph and then one way to
do<00:00:06.779> that<00:00:06.810> is<00:00:07.319> to<00:00:08.160> just<00:00:08.490> place<00:00:08.730> it<00:00:08.760> in<00:00:09.059> there<00:00:09.330> and

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
do that is to just place it in there and

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.169 
do that is to just place it in there and
use<00:00:09.960> alignment<00:00:10.530> and<00:00:10.679> so<00:00:11.099> our<00:00:11.309> paragraph<00:00:11.820> we

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
use alignment and so our paragraph we

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.230 
use alignment and so our paragraph we
have<00:00:12.330> it<00:00:12.420> set<00:00:12.599> to<00:00:12.660> align<00:00:13.080> left<00:00:13.380> in<00:00:13.710> our<00:00:14.610> div<00:00:14.910> tag

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
have it set to align left in our div tag

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.660 
have it set to align left in our div tag
but<00:00:16.109> I'm<00:00:16.260> going<00:00:16.379> to<00:00:16.440> take<00:00:16.650> that<00:00:16.859> out<00:00:16.920> so<00:00:17.490> I<00:00:17.550> can

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
but I'm going to take that out so I can

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.730 
but I'm going to take that out so I can
show<00:00:18.029> you<00:00:18.090> how<00:00:18.390> that<00:00:18.600> has<00:00:18.779> kind<00:00:19.199> of<00:00:19.289> nothing<00:00:19.650> to

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
show you how that has kind of nothing to

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.590

equals quotation marks left and save and

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.060 
equals quotation marks left and save and
then<00:00:57.570> if<00:00:57.719> we<00:00:57.809> go<00:00:57.840> over<00:00:57.989> here<00:00:58.379> and<00:00:58.440> preview<00:00:59.039> it

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
then if we go over here and preview it

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:06.480 
then if we go over here and preview it
so<00:00:59.940> it's<00:01:00.059> not<00:01:00.180> picking<00:01:00.539> up<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.840> flower

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:06.490

careful<00:01:09.290> with<00:01:09.410> code<00:01:10.180> so<00:01:11.180> we'll<00:01:11.330> go<00:01:11.480> over<00:01:11.510> here

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:15.010 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:20.380 

refresh

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.620 

flower

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.800 

let's<00:01:25.110> compare<00:01:25.469> that<00:01:25.619> to<00:01:25.680> our<00:01:25.950> actual<00:01:26.719> see<00:01:27.719> I'd

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
let's compare that to our actual see I'd

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:34.010 
let's compare that to our actual see I'd
miss<00:01:28.140> build<00:01:28.350> it<00:01:28.469> in<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.649> flour<00:01:32.720> there's<00:01:33.720> the

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
miss build it in the flour there's the

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.529 
miss build it in the flour there's the
correct<00:01:34.320> file<00:01:34.530> name<00:01:34.740> so<00:01:34.950> we'll<00:01:35.070> save<00:01:35.340> that<00:01:35.610> now

00:01:36.529 --> 00:01:36.539 
correct file name so we'll save that now

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:38.960 
correct file name so we'll save that now
we'll<00:01:36.689> go<00:01:36.840> over<00:01:36.869> and<00:01:37.380> preview<00:01:38.189> it<00:01:38.220> and<00:01:38.429> it's

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
we'll go over and preview it and it's

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.359 
we'll go over and preview it and it's
staying<00:01:39.780> up<00:01:39.960> here<00:01:40.140> flush<00:01:40.469> line<00:01:40.740> with<00:01:40.890> the<00:01:40.979> text

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
staying up here flush line with the text

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:42.859 
staying up here flush line with the text
but<00:01:41.700> if<00:01:41.789> we<00:01:41.909> were<00:01:42.030> to<00:01:42.090> just<00:01:42.360> put<00:01:42.570> an<00:01:42.659> image

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
but if we were to just put an image

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.690 
but if we were to just put an image
within<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.560> paragraph<00:01:44.130> this<00:01:44.429> is<00:01:44.549> what

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
within the paragraph this is what

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.510 
within the paragraph this is what
happened<00:01:45.149> would<00:01:45.479> happen<00:01:45.899> if<00:01:45.990> we<00:01:46.110> hadn't

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
happened would happen if we hadn't

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.510 
happened would happen if we hadn't
defined<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:47.759> alignment<00:01:48.890> so<00:01:49.890> we'll<00:01:49.979> save<00:01:50.250> that

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
defined the alignment so we'll save that

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.120 
defined the alignment so we'll save that
and<00:01:50.789> refresh<00:01:51.210> it<00:01:51.360> over<00:01:51.539> here<00:01:51.810> and<00:01:51.990> now<00:01:52.409> it's

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
and refresh it over here and now it's

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.249 
and refresh it over here and now it's
doing<00:01:53.490> the<00:01:53.520> automatic<00:01:54.149> thing<00:01:54.360> or<00:01:54.569> it<00:01:54.659> lines<00:01:55.049> up

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
doing the automatic thing or it lines up

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.260 
doing the automatic thing or it lines up
at<00:01:55.409> the<00:01:55.500> bottom<00:01:55.829> of<00:01:55.920> the<00:01:56.039> text<00:01:56.429> and<00:01:56.579> that<00:01:57.090> just

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
at the bottom of the text and that just

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.749 
at the bottom of the text and that just
doesn't<00:01:57.299> look<00:01:57.659> good<00:01:57.810> and<00:01:58.349> so<00:01:58.979> I<00:01:59.189> really<00:01:59.580> like

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
doesn't look good and so I really like

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.209 
doesn't look good and so I really like
it<00:01:59.939> when
