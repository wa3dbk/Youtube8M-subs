00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:07.340
 the program goes 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.880
 with the support of the company pure protein 

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:11.660
 Athletic Club 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.660
 diamond 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:30.430
 A and Bond vaccine vial socket 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:40.230
 levon yes here's the boys hands cyclone then 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:55.700
 as I understand it, another one is waiting for me 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:57.920
 exercise yes kirill correctly we did 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.750
 at the beginning of your workout with extensions 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.850
 you will have 100 block hands 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:04.670
 this exercise will be repeated but will 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:06.170
 small but there will also be a hand extension 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.730
 his block but reverse grip 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:11.360
 for this we take here such 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:13.280
 the handle she sets a clear angle here 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.500
 about 30 degrees to where are you 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.150
 you can actually 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:20.240
 work more already on the natural part 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:23.090
 that is, you looked at me and decided that 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:26.509
 you need to apply her problems 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:28.970
 but yes well come on, we are already in the amount of 3 st 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:32.560
 compliance we will be determined immediately 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:35.450
 their work approaches load here 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.340
 less much than from in classic 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:42.910
 exercises in the usual classic grip 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:42.910
 so I think put 5 tiles 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:49.399
 dangerous to do dangerous adhered to 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.390
 when the exercise technique is perfect 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:53.750
 identical 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:55.399
 that of Mikhail their feet shoulder-width apart on 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.280
 peanut put the legs either parallel 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:59.259
 there was a little apart in the direction of their legs 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.179
 put up 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:04.670
 often put a little one by one and 

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:07.009
 because you're worth to me that's more tightly 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:10.250
 so comfortable when yes let's get up a little bit 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:13.880
 take a closer look but your knees will dry us up a little 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:16.540
 back chest forward before the shoulders go away immediately 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:19.069
 back and elbows pressed against the body 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:22.970
 now fix the position completely 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:23.870
 so grab the handle and why 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.060
 exactly reverse grip 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.940
 why he not things it was impossible just 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:31.310
 the usual grip that matter I am direct yes 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:33.040
 because in the first exercise 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.030
 Cyril French press show and 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.830
 accordingly there is also loaded 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.569
 Of course in a complex already mainly 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:41.330
 entire triceps lateral part and 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:43.010
 the longest stretch of triceps is here 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.980
 the focus is already shifted to the lateral bundle 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:48.690
 triceps and 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:51.790
 accentuated work in more detail 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:53.709
 what is the feeling of the whole and the work well I 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:56.080
 I felt that I was not involved 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:58.599
 one muscle besides triceps here somewhere 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:00.519
 gave back from behind for a powerful blow 

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:01.780
 more but here at the moment accent 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:04.239
 shifted to the back 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.640
 that is, on a long bundle a should have 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:08.370
 it's all ok individually here 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.450
 no it's not that individual 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.370
 load will be period first 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:13.930
 shift and emphasize where 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.640
 most developed villa 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:17.620
 many people feel themselves at once 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.510
 face such a problem that sort of 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.480
 according to the technique they do not do everything 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:25.390
 right but do not find work on this 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:27.250
 a group of men in just three weeks 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:28.329
 if the technique starts correctly 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:30.790
 feel it is not worth it 

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:32.950
 getting upset starting with many people 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:35.049
 come in general the first three weeks in general 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:37.269
 feels no exactly what that hurts 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:39.790
 they but when they train they don't feel 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:41.890
 need shorter simple words feels 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:44.920
 the muscle that they have more than the first 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:47.019
 time is precisely in tone in tone well yes yes 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:50.169
 better muscle blood flow the greater its 

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:54.639
 blood oxygen equipment equipping the 

00:03:50.169 --> 00:03:56.590
 better of course this zone is felt by everyone 

00:03:54.639 --> 00:03:59.169

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:36.280
 because many photos were without it 

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:38.740
