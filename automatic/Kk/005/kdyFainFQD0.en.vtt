bring bought board into Todd like 14
obvious<00:00:39.270> not<00:00:39.420> 100%<00:00:39.960> confirmation<00:00:40.440> but<00:00:40.620> it's

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
obvious not 100% confirmation but it's

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.260 
obvious not 100% confirmation but it's
pretty<00:00:41.100> much<00:00:41.399> they<00:00:41.610> wouldn't<00:00:41.820> just<00:00:41.969> tweet<00:00:42.149> out

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
pretty much they wouldn't just tweet out

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.360 
pretty much they wouldn't just tweet out
stuff<00:00:42.480> and<00:00:42.690> say<00:00:42.780> oh<00:00:42.809> we<00:00:43.230> we<00:00:43.620> just<00:00:43.800> laid<00:00:43.920> against

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
stuff and say oh we we just laid against

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.650 
stuff and say oh we we just laid against
that<00:00:44.489> in<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.700> end<00:00:44.789> so<00:00:45.059> that's<00:00:45.210> just<00:00:45.300> not<00:00:45.570> how

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
that in the end so that's just not how

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:46.639 
that in the end so that's just not how
it's<00:00:45.750> going<00:00:45.870> to<00:00:45.899> work<00:00:45.960> so<00:00:46.260> this<00:00:46.350> is<00:00:46.500> pretty

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
it's going to work so this is pretty

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:47.990 
it's going to work so this is pretty
much<00:00:46.770> confirmation<00:00:47.430> of<00:00:47.550> pictures<00:00:47.879> being

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
much confirmation of pictures being

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.100 
much confirmation of pictures being
brought<00:00:48.210> boards<00:00:48.480> into<00:00:48.570> one<00:00:48.750> point<00:00:48.930> four<00:00:49.079> point

two<00:00:49.500> of<00:00:49.680> straight<00:00:49.890> one<00:00:50.010> point<00:00:50.160> three<00:00:50.190> point

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
two of straight one point three point

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.170 
two of straight one point three point
one<00:00:50.520> or<00:00:50.940> till<00:00:51.210> I<00:00:51.239> did<00:00:51.420> 14<00:00:51.629> for<00:00:52.079> xbox<00:00:52.469> and<00:00:52.649> ps3<00:00:53.180> so

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
one or till I did 14 for xbox and ps3 so

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.299 
one or till I did 14 for xbox and ps3 so
this<00:00:54.480> is<00:00:54.510> an<00:00:54.660> exciting<00:00:54.930> thing<00:00:55.350> and<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:56.070> first

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
this is an exciting thing and the first

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.250 
this is an exciting thing and the first
picnic<00:00:56.579> thing<00:00:56.969> I'd<00:00:57.090> cover<00:00:57.300> is<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.780> anvil

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
picnic thing I'd cover is the anvil

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.540 
picnic thing I'd cover is the anvil
because<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.559> anvil<00:00:58.829> is<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.100> best<00:00:59.309> feature

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
because the anvil is the best feature

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.369 
because the anvil is the best feature
there<00:00:59.820> and<00:01:00.510> it's<00:01:00.629> in<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:00.780> bottom<00:01:00.989> screen<00:01:01.170> shot

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
there and it's in the bottom screen shot

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:02.810 
there and it's in the bottom screen shot
just<00:01:01.559> kind<00:01:01.710> of<00:01:01.770> chilling<00:01:02.010> in<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.309> you<00:01:02.699> know

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
just kind of chilling in the you know

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.520 
just kind of chilling in the you know
the<00:01:02.940> sand<00:01:03.210> and<00:01:03.480> you<00:01:03.539> might<00:01:03.690> mind<00:01:04.110> um<00:01:04.229> notice<00:01:04.439> at

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
the sand and you might mind um notice at

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.350 
the sand and you might mind um notice at
first<00:01:04.559> but<00:01:04.860> now<00:01:04.920> you<00:01:05.070> probably<00:01:05.339> can<00:01:05.580> anyway<00:01:05.909> so

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
first but now you probably can anyway so

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.530 
first but now you probably can anyway so
basically<00:01:07.070> the<00:01:08.070> anvil<00:01:08.400> is<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.790> most<00:01:09.000> exciting

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
basically the anvil is the most exciting

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.090 
basically the anvil is the most exciting
of<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.659> new<00:01:09.840> items<00:01:10.110> coming<00:01:10.320> in<00:01:10.439> with<00:01:10.650> 3.1

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
of the new items coming in with 3.1

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.649 
of the new items coming in with 3.1
because<00:01:11.760> it<00:01:11.850> actually<00:01:11.970> came<00:01:12.210> out<00:01:12.270> one<00:01:12.479> point

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
because it actually came out one point

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.149 
because it actually came out one point
four<00:01:12.780> point<00:01:12.810> two<00:01:13.170> and<00:01:13.409> was<00:01:13.680> probably<00:01:14.010> one<00:01:14.130> of

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
four point two and was probably one of

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.980 
four point two and was probably one of
the<00:01:14.369> bureau<00:01:14.580> keep<00:01:14.820> each<00:01:14.970> took<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.240> update<00:01:15.509> if

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
the bureau keep each took the update if

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.359 
the bureau keep each took the update if
you're<00:01:16.110> wondering<00:01:16.200> whether<00:01:16.590> list<00:01:16.860> it's<00:01:17.070> for<00:01:17.340> a

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
you're wondering whether list it's for a

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.399 
you're wondering whether list it's for a
couple<00:01:17.640> reasons<00:01:17.670> and<00:01:18.240> let's<00:01:18.900> kill<00:01:19.080> instant

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
couple reasons and let's kill instant

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.560 
couple reasons and let's kill instant
now<00:01:19.530> so<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.250> anvil<00:01:20.490> is<00:01:20.610> a<00:01:20.640> late<00:01:20.939> game<00:01:21.210> item

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
now so the anvil is a late game item

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.539 
now so the anvil is a late game item
it's<00:01:21.780> not<00:01:22.110> one<00:01:22.409> you<00:01:22.590> can<00:01:22.770> just<00:01:22.950> do<00:01:23.130> know<00:01:23.220> build

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
it's not one you can just do know build

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:24.980 
it's not one you can just do know build
it<00:01:23.729> in<00:01:23.820> five<00:01:24.030> minutes<00:01:24.360> of<00:01:24.540> starting<00:01:24.720> world

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
it in five minutes of starting world

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.539 
it in five minutes of starting world
it's<00:01:25.320> probably<00:01:25.680> one<00:01:26.009> that<00:01:26.040> you're<00:01:26.310> not<00:01:26.369> going

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
it's probably one that you're not going

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:27.740 
it's probably one that you're not going
to<00:01:26.610> happen<00:01:26.700> till<00:01:26.909> about<00:01:27.000> two<00:01:27.240> hours<00:01:27.360> in<00:01:27.600> it's

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
to happen till about two hours in it's

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.840 
to happen till about two hours in it's
one<00:01:27.960> per<00:01:28.140> unit<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.470> deep<00:01:28.680> world<00:01:28.979> you<00:01:29.490> can<00:01:29.670> make

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
one per unit the deep world you can make

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.399 
one per unit the deep world you can make
one<00:01:30.030> early<00:01:30.270> on<00:01:30.360> but<00:01:30.750> it's<00:01:30.900> basically<00:01:31.200> a<00:01:31.290> waste

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
one early on but it's basically a waste

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.020 
one early on but it's basically a waste
because<00:01:31.619> it<00:01:31.860> takes<00:01:32.040> free<00:01:32.400> blocks<00:01:32.670> of<00:01:32.850> buying

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
because it takes free blocks of buying

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.380 
because it takes free blocks of buying
and<00:01:33.409> for<00:01:34.409> n<00:01:34.560> ingots<00:01:34.890> to<00:01:35.040> make<00:01:35.189> which<00:01:35.460> if<00:01:35.939> you<00:01:36.210> do

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
and for n ingots to make which if you do

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.420 
and for n ingots to make which if you do
the<00:01:36.509> math<00:01:36.540> then<00:01:36.960> that's<00:01:37.140> actually<00:01:37.710> 31

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
the math then that's actually 31

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:39.800 
the math then that's actually 31
individual<00:01:39.150> iron<00:01:39.270> ingots<00:01:39.540> because<00:01:39.689> obviously

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
individual iron ingots because obviously

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.990 
individual iron ingots because obviously
triblock<00:01:40.409> takes<00:01:40.680> nine<00:01:40.920> of<00:01:41.040> them<00:01:41.189> which<00:01:41.850> is<00:01:41.880> a

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
triblock takes nine of them which is a

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.639 
triblock takes nine of them which is a
big<00:01:42.240> investment<00:01:42.390> early<00:01:42.960> ganks<00:01:43.140> that's<00:01:43.439> enough

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
big investment early ganks that's enough

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.740 
big investment early ganks that's enough
to<00:01:43.770> make<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.189> lion<00:01:44.369> armor<00:01:44.820> or<00:01:45.000> you<00:01:45.630> know

which<00:01:59.549> it's<00:01:59.759> not<00:01:59.820> necessary<00:02:00.420> for<00:02:00.479> anyway

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
free things the ambulant more definite

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.070 
free things the ambulant more definite
so<00:02:20.489> but<00:02:20.640> the<00:02:20.970> first<00:02:21.360> thing<00:02:21.599> that<00:02:21.840> most<00:02:21.989> people

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
so but the first thing that most people

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.589 
so but the first thing that most people
know<00:02:22.500> it<00:02:22.620> for<00:02:22.860> but<00:02:23.099> if<00:02:23.220> they've<00:02:23.400> played<00:02:23.700> pc<00:02:24.090> is

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:24.599 
know it for but if they've played pc is

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:25.820 
know it for but if they've played pc is
that<00:02:24.810> you<00:02:24.870> can<00:02:24.959> actually<00:02:25.019> rename<00:02:25.470> your<00:02:25.590> item

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
that you can actually rename your item

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
so i can name this weapon GM if I wanted

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.559 
so i can name this weapon GM if I wanted
to<00:02:28.260> I'm<00:02:28.769> not<00:02:29.190> entirely<00:02:29.760> sure<00:02:29.910> this<00:02:30.150> be<00:02:30.269> on<00:02:30.360> xbox

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
to I'm not entirely sure this be on xbox

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:32.059 
to I'm not entirely sure this be on xbox
I<00:02:30.900> would<00:02:31.110> actually<00:02:31.230> imagine<00:02:31.620> is<00:02:31.739> because<00:02:31.980> it

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
I would actually imagine is because it

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:34.070 
I would actually imagine is because it
involves<00:02:32.670> complex<00:02:32.910> black<00:02:33.450> Steve<00:02:33.660> if<00:02:33.810> you<00:02:33.900> look

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
involves complex black Steve if you look

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.509 
involves complex black Steve if you look
there<00:02:34.349> now<00:02:34.470> my<00:02:34.650> sword<00:02:34.890> would<00:02:35.010> be<00:02:35.099> called<00:02:35.280> Jim

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:35.519 
there now my sword would be called Jim

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:37.430 
there now my sword would be called Jim
if<00:02:35.610> I<00:02:35.700> paid<00:02:35.910> the<00:02:36.030> same<00:02:36.180> quaint<00:02:36.720> I'm<00:02:36.989> not<00:02:37.230> going

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
picture I'm not entirely sure we're

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.410 
picture I'm not entirely sure we're
making<00:02:44.040> it<00:02:44.310> the<00:02:44.489> able<00:02:44.640> to<00:02:44.730> definitely<00:02:44.970> will<00:02:45.269> be

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
making it the able to definitely will be

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.630 
making it the able to definitely will be
which<00:02:46.200> are<00:02:46.440> basically<00:02:46.769> first<00:02:47.340> of<00:02:47.459> all<00:02:47.519> the

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
which are basically first of all the

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.250 
which are basically first of all the
ability<00:02:47.970> to<00:02:48.090> repair<00:02:48.390> items<00:02:48.569> which<00:02:48.959> as<00:02:49.110> you<00:02:49.200> can

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
ability to repair items which as you can

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.559 
ability to repair items which as you can
see<00:02:49.380> if<00:02:50.040> you<00:02:50.130> put<00:02:50.280> one<00:02:50.519> of<00:02:50.700> the<00:02:50.849> type<00:02:51.090> of<00:02:51.120> item

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:51.569 
see if you put one of the type of item

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:53.690 
see if you put one of the type of item
the<00:02:51.690> letters<00:02:51.959> in<00:02:52.200> there<00:02:52.470> so<00:02:52.680> if<00:02:52.829> it's<00:02:52.980> a<00:02:53.069> sword

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
the letters in there so if it's a sword

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.059 
the letters in there so if it's a sword
you<00:02:54.269> know<00:02:54.390> piece<00:02:54.660> of<00:02:54.750> armor<00:02:54.989> whatever<00:02:55.260> if<00:02:55.980> you

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:56.069 
you know piece of armor whatever if you

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:57.650 
you know piece of armor whatever if you
put<00:02:56.220> the<00:02:56.310> item<00:02:56.579> the<00:02:56.790> type<00:02:56.940> of<00:02:56.970> item<00:02:57.299> it<00:02:57.360> is<00:02:57.390> in

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
put the item the type of item it is in

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.600 
put the item the type of item it is in
there<00:02:57.900> it<00:02:58.140> will<00:02:58.319> fully<00:02:58.650> repair<00:02:59.010> the<00:02:59.160> item<00:02:59.190> at

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
there it will fully repair the item at

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:00.949 
there it will fully repair the item at
the<00:02:59.640> cost<00:02:59.879> of<00:03:00.000> one<00:03:00.180> in<00:03:00.269> challenge<00:03:00.629> which<00:03:00.810> is

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
the cost of one in challenge which is

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:02.360 
the cost of one in challenge which is
very<00:03:01.260> little<00:03:01.470> when<00:03:01.739> you<00:03:01.829> consider<00:03:02.129> the

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
very little when you consider the

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.699 
very little when you consider the
savings<00:03:02.790> and<00:03:03.390> see<00:03:03.599> if<00:03:03.660> that<00:03:03.690> was<00:03:03.900> 30<00:03:04.230> red<00:03:04.440> one

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
savings and see if that was 30 red one

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:06.470 
savings and see if that was 30 red one
you<00:03:05.129> left<00:03:05.400> it<00:03:05.790> basically<00:03:06.180> gives<00:03:06.329> you<00:03:06.450> a

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
you left it basically gives you a

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.240 
you left it basically gives you a
whole<00:03:06.660> new<00:03:06.720> sword<00:03:07.079> at<00:03:07.560> the<00:03:07.680> cost<00:03:07.890> of<00:03:08.010> one

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
whole new sword at the cost of one

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.220 
whole new sword at the cost of one
diamond<00:03:08.670> damn<00:03:08.790> one<00:03:08.970> XP<00:03:09.329> as<00:03:09.569> opposed<00:03:09.870> to<00:03:10.049> two

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
diamond damn one XP as opposed to two

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.020 
diamond damn one XP as opposed to two
diamonds<00:03:10.530> or<00:03:10.769> in<00:03:11.069> the<00:03:11.220> chase<00:03:11.400> which<00:03:11.519> case<00:03:11.849> for

save is a Titans even it's a big big big
saving<00:03:17.220> and<00:03:17.549> it's<00:03:17.940> definitely<00:03:18.450> worth<00:03:18.750> doing

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
saving and it's definitely worth doing

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:20.360 
saving and it's definitely worth doing
if<00:03:19.230> you<00:03:19.410> know<00:03:19.709> it's<00:03:19.859> worth<00:03:19.980> getting<00:03:20.130> is<00:03:20.280> to

if you know it's worth getting is to

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.430 
if you know it's worth getting is to
help<00:03:20.489> doing<00:03:20.760> especially<00:03:21.540> for<00:03:21.959> enchanted

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
help doing especially for enchanted

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.280 
help doing especially for enchanted
items<00:03:22.560> because<00:03:23.069> um<00:03:23.540> that's<00:03:24.540> a<00:03:24.720> nothing<00:03:25.079> you<00:03:25.170> do

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
items because um that's a nothing you do

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:26.960 
items because um that's a nothing you do
this<00:03:25.470> because<00:03:25.620> in<00:03:25.889> the<00:03:26.040> one<00:03:26.250> point<00:03:26.459> 4.2<00:03:26.940> update

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
this because in the one point 4.2 update

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.150 
this because in the one point 4.2 update
which<00:03:27.329> I'd<00:03:27.510> imagine<00:03:28.049> this<00:03:28.739> is<00:03:28.889> something<00:03:29.130> that

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
which I'd imagine this is something that

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.490 
which I'd imagine this is something that
bring<00:03:29.400> forward<00:03:29.670> because<00:03:30.120> obviously<00:03:30.599> it<00:03:30.989> break

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
bring forward because obviously it break

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.140 
bring forward because obviously it break
it<00:03:31.530> takes<00:03:31.799> one<00:03:31.980> of<00:03:32.069> the<00:03:32.130> users<00:03:32.400> vandals<00:03:32.760> but

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
it takes one of the users vandals but

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.479 
it takes one of the users vandals but
basically<00:03:33.329> you<00:03:34.170> can<00:03:34.349> enchant<00:03:34.530> books<00:03:35.130> in<00:03:35.370> in

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489 
basically you can enchant books in in

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:37.550 
basically you can enchant books in in
charmin<00:03:35.849> table<00:03:36.209> and<00:03:36.359> whatever<00:03:37.019> in<00:03:37.139> xiamen<00:03:37.470> the

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
charmin table and whatever in xiamen the

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.080 
charmin table and whatever in xiamen the
book<00:03:37.709> gets<00:03:37.980> which<00:03:38.190> it<00:03:38.370> can<00:03:38.579> be<00:03:38.609> completely

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
book gets which it can be completely

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.319 
book gets which it can be completely
random<00:03:39.389> which<00:03:39.480> is<00:03:39.630> I<00:03:39.720> guess<00:03:39.750> downside<00:03:41.239> it<00:03:42.239> will

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:42.329 
random which is I guess downside it will

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:44.000 
random which is I guess downside it will
basically<00:03:42.480> turn<00:03:43.079> it<00:03:43.200> into<00:03:43.319> a<00:03:43.440> book<00:03:43.680> which<00:03:43.980> is

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
basically turn it into a book which is

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:45.949 
basically turn it into a book which is
kind<00:03:44.430> of<00:03:44.489> exciting<00:03:44.730> so<00:03:45.180> then<00:03:45.630> what<00:03:45.810> you<00:03:45.930> have

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
kind of exciting so then what you have

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:48.080 
kind of exciting so then what you have
these<00:03:46.290> books<00:03:46.620> you<00:03:46.919> can<00:03:47.099> then<00:03:47.280> put<00:03:47.579> them<00:03:47.760> on

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
these books you can then put them on

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:49.970 
these books you can then put them on
stuff<00:03:48.599> which<00:03:48.870> which<00:03:49.319> actual<00:03:49.620> email<00:03:49.739> allows

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
stuff which which actual email allows

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:51.349 
stuff which which actual email allows
for<00:03:50.190> combinations<00:03:50.609> which<00:03:50.760> should<00:03:50.880> exist<00:03:51.150> such

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:51.359 
for combinations which should exist such

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:53.750 
for combinations which should exist such
as<00:03:51.389> I'm<00:03:51.630> breaking<00:03:52.139> on<00:03:52.290> the<00:03:52.349> sword<00:03:52.799> for<00:03:52.950> it<00:03:53.639> this

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
as I'm breaking on the sword for it this

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.039 
as I'm breaking on the sword for it this
is<00:03:53.940> actually<00:03:54.180> something<00:03:54.299> that<00:03:54.450> you<00:03:54.599> can't<00:03:54.810> get

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:55.049 
is actually something that you can't get

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:57.710 
is actually something that you can't get
until<00:03:55.709> this<00:03:55.980> update<00:03:56.370> and<00:03:56.609> basically<00:03:57.359> put<00:03:57.599> a

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
until this update and basically put a

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.210 
until this update and basically put a
few<00:03:57.900> intron<00:03:58.260> the<00:03:58.380> book<00:03:58.500> you<00:03:58.650> get<00:03:58.799> on<00:03:58.889> breaking

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
few intron the book you get on breaking

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:00.740 
few intron the book you get on breaking
on<00:03:59.340> the<00:03:59.370> book<00:03:59.639> you<00:03:59.790> can<00:03:59.910> then<00:04:00.060> put<00:04:00.269> that<00:04:00.299> Brooke

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750 
on the book you can then put that Brooke

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:02.809 
on the book you can then put that Brooke
in<00:04:00.930> the<00:04:01.169> anvil<00:04:01.530> with<00:04:01.709> the<00:04:01.859> sword<00:04:02.099> and<00:04:02.250> put<00:04:02.730> it

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:02.819 
in the anvil with the sword and put it

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:04.069 
in the anvil with the sword and put it
on<00:04:02.910> the<00:04:02.940> sword<00:04:03.209> so<00:04:03.450> that's<00:04:03.630> one<00:04:03.840> of<00:04:03.900> the<00:04:03.959> cool

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:04.079 
on the sword so that's one of the cool

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:05.629 
on the sword so that's one of the cool
things<00:04:04.139> you<00:04:04.319> can<00:04:04.410> do<00:04:04.590> there<00:04:04.799> and<00:04:05.400> now<00:04:05.519> I've

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:05.639 
things you can do there and now I've

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:07.370 
things you can do there and now I've
gone<00:04:05.730> on<00:04:05.790> breaking<00:04:06.359> free<00:04:06.630> sword<00:04:06.959> which<00:04:07.200> is

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:07.380 
gone on breaking free sword which is

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.020 
gone on breaking free sword which is
some<00:04:07.590> of<00:04:07.650> you<00:04:07.739> don't<00:04:07.950> have<00:04:08.130> I<00:04:08.310> can<00:04:08.730> then<00:04:08.819> put<00:04:08.940> it

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
some of you don't have I can then put it

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:10.729 
some of you don't have I can then put it
back<00:04:09.060> on<00:04:09.180> the<00:04:09.359> book<00:04:09.660> if<00:04:09.840> you<00:04:09.959> put<00:04:10.169> out<00:04:10.260> so<00:04:10.500> yeah

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 
back on the book if you put out so yeah

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:13.370 
back on the book if you put out so yeah
I<00:04:11.030> forgot<00:04:12.030> about<00:04:12.180> that<00:04:12.239> I<00:04:12.630> think<00:04:13.079> you<00:04:13.139> can<00:04:13.290> put

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:13.380 
I forgot about that I think you can put

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:14.720 
I forgot about that I think you can put
it<00:04:13.470> back<00:04:13.530> on<00:04:13.590> the<00:04:13.709> book<00:04:13.919> it<00:04:14.099> doesn't<00:04:14.459> seem<00:04:14.579> you

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
it back on the book it doesn't seem you

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:16.250 
it back on the book it doesn't seem you
can<00:04:14.940> I<00:04:15.120> don't<00:04:15.660> think<00:04:15.870> something<00:04:16.200> else

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
can I don't think something else

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.020 
can I don't think something else
basically<00:04:16.560> you<00:04:17.130> can<00:04:17.280> then<00:04:17.430> use<00:04:17.609> this<00:04:17.789> sword

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
basically you can then use this sword

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:19.879 
basically you can then use this sword
with<00:04:18.269> the<00:04:18.299> you<00:04:19.049> know<00:04:19.169> the<00:04:19.289> new<00:04:19.380> and<00:04:19.530> shamans

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:19.889 
with the you know the new and shamans

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:21.560 
with the you know the new and shamans
and<00:04:20.010> you<00:04:20.160> can<00:04:20.310> do<00:04:20.400> its<00:04:20.519> cool<00:04:20.700> things<00:04:20.880> and<00:04:21.120> even

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
and you can do its cool things and even

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:22.909 
and you can do its cool things and even
once<00:04:21.810> you've<00:04:21.959> used<00:04:22.140> it<00:04:22.289> up<00:04:22.349> you<00:04:22.590> can<00:04:22.740> then

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:22.919 
once you've used it up you can then

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:25.040 
once you've used it up you can then
reinsert<00:04:23.669> you<00:04:23.760> can<00:04:23.940> then<00:04:24.090> use<00:04:24.510> the<00:04:24.659> prepare

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050 
reinsert you can then use the prepare

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:26.810 
reinsert you can then use the prepare
feature<00:04:25.260> and<00:04:25.590> then<00:04:26.190> what<00:04:26.370> you<00:04:26.490> know<00:04:26.610> you've

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 
feature and then what you know you've

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:27.550 
feature and then what you know you've
got<00:04:26.969> your<00:04:27.090> sword

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:27.560 
got your sword

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:29.290 
got your sword
breaking<00:04:27.830> free<00:04:28.010> all<00:04:28.190> the<00:04:28.280> way<00:04:28.340> back<00:04:28.550> so<00:04:28.940> it

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:29.300 
breaking free all the way back so it

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.030 
breaking free all the way back so it
obviously<00:04:29.450> cost<00:04:29.780> more<00:04:30.080> to<00:04:30.260> do<00:04:30.410> the<00:04:30.560> stuff<00:04:30.800> with

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:31.040 
obviously cost more to do the stuff with

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:32.350 
obviously cost more to do the stuff with
the<00:04:31.160> insurance<00:04:31.280> to<00:04:31.760> make<00:04:31.910> up<00:04:32.060> for<00:04:32.090> the<00:04:32.330> fact

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.360 
the insurance to make up for the fact

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:33.850 
the insurance to make up for the fact
that<00:04:32.690> you're<00:04:32.900> getting<00:04:32.930> a<00:04:33.260> lot<00:04:33.380> more<00:04:33.410> outfit

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:33.860 
that you're getting a lot more outfit

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:35.440 
that you're getting a lot more outfit
but<00:04:34.250> it's<00:04:34.370> still<00:04:34.580> definitely<00:04:34.910> definitely

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:35.450 
but it's still definitely definitely

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:37.810 
but it's still definitely definitely
worth<00:04:35.840> it<00:04:36.080> I<00:04:36.200> think<00:04:36.530> anyway<00:04:36.919> so<00:04:37.520> it's<00:04:37.669> a<00:04:37.700> way<00:04:37.790> to

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:37.820 
worth it I think anyway so it's a way to

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:39.909 
worth it I think anyway so it's a way to
renew<00:04:38.180> in<00:04:38.270> Charlotte's<00:04:38.660> basically<00:04:39.110> a<00:04:39.290> really

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:39.919 
renew in Charlotte's basically a really

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:41.409 
renew in Charlotte's basically a really
really<00:04:40.100> cool<00:04:40.220> late-game<00:04:40.669> item<00:04:41.270> that's

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:41.419 
really cool late-game item that's

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:44.350 
really cool late-game item that's
definitely<00:04:42.110> worth<00:04:42.260> using<00:04:42.590> in<00:04:42.800> my<00:04:42.919> opinion<00:04:43.360> and

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:44.360 
definitely worth using in my opinion and

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.090 
definitely worth using in my opinion and
let's<00:04:45.230> just<00:04:45.260> quickly<00:04:45.500> discussed<00:04:45.950> the

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:46.100 
let's just quickly discussed the

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:47.800 
let's just quickly discussed the
degradation<00:04:46.580> because<00:04:47.060> I<00:04:47.240> put<00:04:47.360> out<00:04:47.510> all<00:04:47.630> free

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:47.810 
degradation because I put out all free

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:49.540 
degradation because I put out all free
to<00:04:47.840> show<00:04:48.080> that<00:04:48.260> because<00:04:48.919> this<00:04:49.040> might<00:04:49.190> confuse

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:49.550 
to show that because this might confuse

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:51.070 
to show that because this might confuse
people<00:04:49.820> at<00:04:49.910> first<00:04:50.060> because<00:04:50.300> it<00:04:50.419> is<00:04:50.690> almost

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:51.080 
people at first because it is almost

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:53.590 
people at first because it is almost
random<00:04:52.040> it's<00:04:52.250> randomly<00:04:52.669> how<00:04:52.910> it<00:04:53.030> works<00:04:53.240> and<00:04:53.450> it

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:53.600 
random it's randomly how it works and it

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.300 
random it's randomly how it works and it
might<00:04:53.750> seem<00:04:53.990> entirely<00:04:54.320> random<00:04:54.560> people<00:04:55.070> using

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:55.310 
might seem entirely random people using

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:57.550 
might seem entirely random people using
it<00:04:55.370> so<00:04:56.060> basically<00:04:56.570> there<00:04:57.020> are<00:04:57.050> three<00:04:57.139> stages

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:57.560 
it so basically there are three stages

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:59.230 
it so basically there are three stages
off<00:04:57.830> the<00:04:57.919> anvil<00:04:58.250> this<00:04:58.430> is<00:04:58.610> the<00:04:58.820> one<00:04:58.970> you<00:04:59.000> may

00:04:59.230 --> 00:04:59.240 
off the anvil this is the one you may

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:00.820 
off the anvil this is the one you may
get<00:04:59.630> when<00:04:59.780> you<00:04:59.900> build<00:05:00.139> it<00:05:00.290> straight<00:05:00.530> from<00:05:00.560> the

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:00.830 
get when you build it straight from the

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:03.430 
get when you build it straight from the
crafting<00:05:01.160> bench<00:05:01.310> this<00:05:02.270> is<00:05:02.419> lon<00:05:02.660> that<00:05:03.020> you<00:05:03.229> get

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:03.440 
crafting bench this is lon that you get

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:06.040 
crafting bench this is lon that you get
after<00:05:03.680> a<00:05:03.950> random<00:05:04.460> number<00:05:04.669> of<00:05:04.729> uses<00:05:05.030> it<00:05:05.270> happens

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:06.050 
after a random number of uses it happens

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:07.390 
after a random number of uses it happens
is<00:05:06.229> a<00:05:06.260> ranch<00:05:06.470> on<00:05:06.620> slapping<00:05:06.860> each<00:05:06.919> time<00:05:07.220> you

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:07.400 
is a ranch on slapping each time you

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:08.770 
is a ranch on slapping each time you
could<00:05:07.610> actually<00:05:07.729> two<00:05:08.030> could<00:05:08.270> take<00:05:08.389> one<00:05:08.600> use

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:08.780 
could actually two could take one use

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:10.180 
could actually two could take one use
between<00:05:08.900> that<00:05:09.139> and<00:05:09.229> nap<00:05:09.350> listen<00:05:09.770> this<00:05:09.919> so<00:05:10.130> you

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:10.190 
between that and nap listen this so you

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:11.890 
between that and nap listen this so you
could<00:05:10.310> get<00:05:10.460> free<00:05:10.729> uses<00:05:11.030> a<00:05:11.090> pure<00:05:11.270> Ambo<00:05:11.510> you

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:11.900 
could get free uses a pure Ambo you

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:13.330 
could get free uses a pure Ambo you
could<00:05:12.139> get<00:05:12.320> literally<00:05:12.860> hundreds<00:05:13.250> of

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:13.340 
could get literally hundreds of

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:14.920 
could get literally hundreds of
thousands<00:05:13.820> it's<00:05:13.970> completely<00:05:14.419> chance<00:05:14.630> based

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:14.930 
thousands it's completely chance based

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:16.690 
thousands it's completely chance based
but<00:05:15.560> then<00:05:15.710> eventually<00:05:15.800> alternate<00:05:16.460> this

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:16.700 
but then eventually alternate this

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:18.370 
but then eventually alternate this
there's<00:05:16.970> no<00:05:17.150> actual<00:05:17.570> functional<00:05:18.080> difference

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:18.380 
there's no actual functional difference

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:19.629 
there's no actual functional difference
between<00:05:18.620> that<00:05:18.710> one<00:05:18.830> over<00:05:18.950> then<00:05:19.130> this<00:05:19.310> one<00:05:19.490> as

00:05:19.629 --> 00:05:19.639 
between that one over then this one as

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:21.610 
between that one over then this one as
I'll<00:05:20.060> show<00:05:20.090> you<00:05:20.330> right<00:05:20.510> here<00:05:20.570> it's<00:05:20.960> cost<00:05:21.470> the

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:21.620 
I'll show you right here it's cost the
