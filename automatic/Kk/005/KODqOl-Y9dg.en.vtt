waist video which displays very very

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.830 
waist video which displays very very
bright<00:00:10.469> as<00:00:10.679> you<00:00:10.800> can<00:00:11.040> see<00:00:11.570> compared<00:00:12.570> to<00:00:12.719> the

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
bright as you can see compared to the

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.099 
bright as you can see compared to the
Gibby<00:00:13.200> a<00:00:13.230> micro<00:00:13.799> screen<00:00:14.360> also<00:00:15.360> the<00:00:15.630> size<00:00:15.870> is

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
Gibby a micro screen also the size is

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.560 
Gibby a micro screen also the size is
much<00:00:16.410> much<00:00:16.680> better<00:00:16.980> to<00:00:17.310> play<00:00:17.580> than<00:00:18.150> to<00:00:18.420> give

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
much much better to play than to give

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.810 
much much better to play than to give
you<00:00:18.690> a<00:00:18.720> micro<00:00:19.260> a<00:00:19.289> bit<00:00:19.680> too<00:00:19.949> small<00:00:20.310> for<00:00:20.640> my

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
you a micro a bit too small for my

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.259 
you a micro a bit too small for my
opinion<00:00:21.560> but<00:00:22.560> at<00:00:22.949> least<00:00:23.160> for<00:00:23.430> my<00:00:23.580> big<00:00:23.820> hands

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
opinion but at least for my big hands

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.019 
opinion but at least for my big hands
maybe<00:00:25.109> it's<00:00:25.320> we<00:00:25.529> did<00:00:25.710> for<00:00:25.980> you<00:00:26.460> or<00:00:26.699> for<00:00:26.730> other

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
maybe it's we did for you or for other

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.779 
maybe it's we did for you or for other
children<00:00:27.320> so<00:00:28.320> you<00:00:28.800> can<00:00:29.010> see<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:29.400> displays

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
children so you can see the displays

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.510

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
ok if I go direct into the camera that's

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.819 
ok if I go direct into the camera that's
not<00:00:58.620> possible<00:00:58.829> but<00:00:59.100> I<00:01:00.199> played<00:01:01.199> in<00:01:01.440> direct

sunlight and if you have a bit shadow

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.390 
sunlight and if you have a bit shadow
which<00:01:03.870> is<00:01:04.080> enough<00:01:04.379> from<00:01:04.619> your<00:01:04.769> head<00:01:04.979> then<00:01:05.220> you

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
which is enough from your head then you

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.520 
which is enough from your head then you

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
will also have some inner run a sound

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.219 
will also have some inner run a sound
when<00:01:12.659> I<00:01:12.720> run<00:01:13.080> something<00:01:14.150> let<00:01:15.150> me<00:01:15.360> see<00:01:15.720> what<00:01:16.080> do

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
when I run something let me see what do

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.350 
when I run something let me see what do
we<00:01:16.409> have<00:01:16.650> here<00:01:17.659> there's<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:20.150> got<00:01:21.150> some

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
we have here there's the got some

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:28.690 
we have here there's the got some
emulators<00:01:21.659> here<00:01:22.409> for<00:01:23.040> sure<00:01:24.409> temper<00:01:26.119> which<00:01:27.119> is

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700 
emulators here for sure temper which is

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:33.830 
emulators here for sure temper which is
nice<00:01:29.700> pc<00:01:30.479> engine<00:01:30.630> emulator<00:01:32.390> let's<00:01:33.390> play<00:01:33.659> a

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
nice pc engine emulator let's play a

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:41.080 
nice pc engine emulator let's play a
parasol<00:01:34.380> stars<00:01:34.560> is<00:01:34.799> a<00:01:34.829> nice<00:01:35.070> game<00:01:35.340> actually<00:01:37.490> so

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:46.350 

you<00:01:42.090> see<00:01:42.420> how<00:01:42.689> well<00:01:42.930> it<00:01:42.960> works<00:01:43.380> on<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:44.250> boys

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:46.360 
you see how well it works on the boys

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:51.550 
you see how well it works on the boys
the<00:01:47.360> first<00:01:48.130> better<00:01:49.130> version<00:01:49.610> but<00:01:50.140> as<00:01:51.140> you<00:01:51.350> can

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
the first better version but as you can

00:01:51.560 --> 00:02:04.060 
the first better version but as you can
see<00:01:52.750> your<00:01:53.750> spine<00:02:00.610> so<00:02:01.610> working<00:02:01.880> nicely<00:02:02.210> for<00:02:03.070> the

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
see your spine so working nicely for the

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:08.109 
see your spine so working nicely for the
engine<00:02:04.580> I<00:02:04.700> guess

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:10.449 

as<00:02:08.720> I'm<00:02:08.899> playing<00:02:09.110> with<00:02:09.409> those<00:02:09.590> problems<00:02:10.250> is

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:10.459 
as I'm playing with those problems is

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:14.500 
as I'm playing with those problems is
now<00:02:10.670> much<00:02:10.909> better<00:02:10.940> than<00:02:11.540> the<00:02:12.489> d-pad<00:02:13.489> that<00:02:14.299> it's

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
now much better than the d-pad that it's

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.430 
now much better than the d-pad that it's
not<00:02:14.750> pre-process<00:02:15.379> any<00:02:15.590> more<00:02:15.890> about<00:02:16.220> a<00:02:17.440> several

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
not pre-process any more about a several

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:25.449 
not pre-process any more about a several
buttons<00:02:18.980> much<00:02:19.790> bit<00:02:20.060> of<00:02:20.180> a<00:02:20.299> plane<00:02:21.970> okay<00:02:24.459> another

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:25.459 
buttons much bit of a plane okay another

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:28.750 
buttons much bit of a plane okay another
game<00:02:25.670> I<00:02:25.700> had<00:02:26.000> problems<00:02:26.480> with<00:02:26.950> at<00:02:27.950> the<00:02:28.190> GP<00:02:28.579> to

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
game I had problems with at the GP to

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.860 
game I had problems with at the GP to

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
expose my utopia which ran very slow i

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.729 
expose my utopia which ran very slow i
had<00:02:33.140> no<00:02:33.379> idea<00:02:33.409> why<00:02:34.750> but<00:02:35.750> this<00:02:36.079> one<00:02:36.290> is<00:02:36.440> also

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:36.739 
had no idea why but this one is also

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:40.070 
had no idea why but this one is also
running<00:02:36.860> fine<00:02:37.340> here

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:57.530 

you

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:04.039 

so<00:02:58.079> I<00:02:58.760> again<00:02:59.760> to<00:02:59.909> show<00:03:00.360> the<00:03:00.569> screen<00:03:02.659> very<00:03:03.659> very

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:04.049 
so I again to show the screen very very

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:11.599 
so I again to show the screen very very
good<00:03:04.260> viewing<00:03:04.829> angle<00:03:06.230> really<00:03:07.230> works<00:03:07.469> good<00:03:10.609> so

emulate<00:03:31.349> games<00:03:31.650> is<00:03:31.859> definitely<00:03:32.489> Marble

emulate games is definitely Marble

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.369

00:03:39.679 --> 00:03:39.689 
weeks as far as I remember where is it

00:03:39.689 --> 00:03:45.619 
weeks as far as I remember where is it
there<00:03:40.230> it<00:03:40.409> is<00:03:43.459> runs<00:03:44.459> pretty<00:03:44.760> well<00:03:44.909> already<00:03:45.209> on

00:03:45.619 --> 00:03:45.629 
there it is runs pretty well already on

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:49.970

the<00:03:45.750> base<00:03:45.930> in<00:03:46.169> my<00:03:46.560> opinion<00:03:48.379> still<00:03:49.379> a<00:03:49.409> bit<00:03:49.650> slow

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
the base in my opinion still a bit slow

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:51.830 
the base in my opinion still a bit slow
but<00:03:50.639> you<00:03:50.790> can<00:03:50.939> you<00:03:51.030> end<00:03:51.180> the<00:03:51.269> sound<00:03:51.540> but

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
but you can you end the sound but

00:03:51.840 --> 00:04:04.770 
but you can you end the sound but
definitely<00:03:52.909> playable

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:04.780
