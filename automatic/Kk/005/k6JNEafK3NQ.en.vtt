00:00:19.749 --> 00:00:19.759 
that a minecart with the chest will pop

00:00:19.759 --> 00:00:21.999 
that a minecart with the chest will pop
out<00:00:19.939> right<00:00:20.390> in<00:00:20.570> front<00:00:20.599> of<00:00:20.900> us<00:00:21.020> and<00:00:21.230> we<00:00:21.830> can

00:00:21.999 --> 00:00:22.009 
out right in front of us and we can

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:24.820 
out right in front of us and we can
check<00:00:22.160> out<00:00:22.340> the<00:00:22.490> inventory<00:00:22.730> inside<00:00:23.599> it<00:00:23.779> and<00:00:24.020> if

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:24.830 
check out the inventory inside it and if

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:26.920 
check out the inventory inside it and if
we<00:00:25.009> press<00:00:25.189> this<00:00:25.400> button<00:00:25.610> once<00:00:26.119> again<00:00:26.239> it<00:00:26.660> will

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:26.930 
we press this button once again it will

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:28.810 
we press this button once again it will
completely<00:00:27.320> disappear<00:00:27.560> in<00:00:28.099> front<00:00:28.369> of<00:00:28.460> us<00:00:28.610> I

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:28.820 
completely disappear in front of us I

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.659 
completely disappear in front of us I
just<00:00:29.270> made<00:00:29.989> this<00:00:30.230> project<00:00:30.590> wait<00:00:30.919> cast<00:00:31.310> from

00:00:31.659 --> 00:00:31.669 
just made this project wait cast from

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:34.150 
just made this project wait cast from
the<00:00:31.820> mazuma<00:00:32.329> channel<00:00:32.630> and<00:00:32.960> we<00:00:33.649> are<00:00:33.770> ready<00:00:33.980> to

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:34.160 
the mazuma channel and we are ready to

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.720 
the mazuma channel and we are ready to
check<00:00:34.340> out<00:00:34.399> the<00:00:34.640> Redstone<00:00:35.059> behind<00:00:35.090> it<00:00:36.460> so<00:00:37.460> as

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:37.730 
check out the Redstone behind it so as

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.270 
check out the Redstone behind it so as
you<00:00:37.760> can<00:00:38.030> see<00:00:38.270> it's<00:00:38.570> amazingly<00:00:39.380> compact<00:00:39.920> it's

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:40.280 
you can see it's amazingly compact it's

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.940 
you can see it's amazingly compact it's
almost<00:00:40.610> piston<00:00:41.059> layout<00:00:41.329> size<00:00:41.570> and<00:00:41.960> the

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:42.950 
almost piston layout size and the

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:44.920 
almost piston layout size and the
principle<00:00:43.460> behind<00:00:43.760> it<00:00:43.970> is<00:00:44.150> that<00:00:44.210> we<00:00:44.540> have<00:00:44.720> this

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:44.930 
principle behind it is that we have this

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:46.930 
principle behind it is that we have this
trapdoor<00:00:45.200> here<00:00:45.620> and<00:00:45.800> once<00:00:46.250> we<00:00:46.430> press<00:00:46.640> this

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:46.940 
trapdoor here and once we press this

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.410 
trapdoor here and once we press this
button<00:00:47.590> this<00:00:48.590> slime<00:00:49.130> blocks<00:00:49.460> is<00:00:49.700> going<00:00:50.090> to

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:50.420 
button this slime blocks is going to

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.900 
button this slime blocks is going to
launch<00:00:50.870> the<00:00:51.110> minecart<00:00:51.560> up<00:00:51.740> and<00:00:52.130> it's<00:00:52.610> going<00:00:52.820> to

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:52.910 
launch the minecart up and it's going to

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.690 
launch the minecart up and it's going to
catch<00:00:53.180> it<00:00:53.390> once<00:00:53.690> it<00:00:53.870> goes<00:00:54.260> down<00:00:54.530> so<00:00:55.160> if<00:00:55.640> we

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:55.700 
catch it once it goes down so if we

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.910 
catch it once it goes down so if we
press<00:00:56.090> this<00:00:56.300> button<00:00:56.510> once<00:00:57.020> again<00:00:57.320> as<00:00:57.710> you<00:00:57.770> can

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:57.920 
press this button once again as you can

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.730 
press this button once again as you can
see<00:00:58.040> the<00:00:58.310> pulse<00:00:58.550> is<00:00:59.329> going<00:00:59.780> to<00:00:59.900> be<00:01:00.079> this<00:01:00.530> way<00:01:00.680> to

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:00.740 
see the pulse is going to be this way to

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:02.590 
see the pulse is going to be this way to
happen<00:01:01.130> before<00:01:01.310> the<00:01:01.610> minecarts<00:01:02.150> down<00:01:02.360> there

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:02.600 
happen before the minecarts down there

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.590 
happen before the minecarts down there
so<00:01:02.870> it<00:01:03.079> will<00:01:03.290> catch<00:01:03.530> up<00:01:03.610> with<00:01:04.610> the<00:01:05.239> minecart

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:05.600 
so it will catch up with the minecart

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.429 
so it will catch up with the minecart
falling<00:01:06.020> so<00:01:06.909> the<00:01:07.909> next<00:01:08.090> thing<00:01:08.329> we<00:01:08.930> try<00:01:09.140> to<00:01:09.200> do

00:01:09.429 --> 00:01:09.439 
falling so the next thing we try to do

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:12.249 
falling so the next thing we try to do
is<00:01:09.680> to<00:01:10.009> stick<00:01:10.369> a<00:01:10.610> lamp<00:01:10.909> inside<00:01:11.210> this<00:01:11.689> block<00:01:11.960> so

00:01:12.249 --> 00:01:12.259 
is to stick a lamp inside this block so

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:16.450 
is to stick a lamp inside this block so
it<00:01:12.530> would<00:01:12.740> look<00:01:12.950> even<00:01:13.330> more<00:01:14.330> awesome<00:01:14.659> so<00:01:15.460> this

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
it would look even more awesome so this

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.340 
it would look even more awesome so this
was<00:01:16.880> the<00:01:17.060> design<00:01:17.180> that<00:01:17.510> we<00:01:17.720> could<00:01:17.900> came<00:01:18.170> up

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:18.350 
was the design that we could came up

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.740 
was the design that we could came up
with<00:01:18.620> and<00:01:18.920> this<00:01:19.340> is<00:01:19.520> also<00:01:19.700> pretty<00:01:20.030> amazing<00:01:20.479> the

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
with and this is also pretty amazing the

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.170 
with and this is also pretty amazing the
the<00:01:21.440> other<00:01:21.590> design<00:01:21.979> was<00:01:22.220> thirty<00:01:22.490> six<00:01:22.820> blocks

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.180 
the other design was thirty six blocks

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.210 
the other design was thirty six blocks
talked<00:01:23.630> about<00:01:23.840> in<00:01:23.900> volume<00:01:24.290> and<00:01:24.440> this<00:01:24.740> one<00:01:24.979> is

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:25.220 
talked about in volume and this one is

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.000 
talked about in volume and this one is
40<00:01:25.640> blocks<00:01:25.820> but<00:01:26.479> still<00:01:26.990> pretty<00:01:27.229> cool<00:01:27.409> and<00:01:27.680> the

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:28.010 
40 blocks but still pretty cool and the

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:30.430 
40 blocks but still pretty cool and the
system<00:01:28.340> is<00:01:28.520> even<00:01:28.970> more<00:01:29.150> amazing<00:01:29.720> if<00:01:29.990> we<00:01:30.200> click

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:30.440 
system is even more amazing if we click

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.300 
system is even more amazing if we click
this<00:01:30.560> button<00:01:30.620> you<00:01:31.430> will<00:01:31.580> see<00:01:31.640> that<00:01:32.710> the<00:01:33.710> basic

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
this button you will see that the basic

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.050 
this button you will see that the basic
principle<00:01:34.729> is<00:01:34.909> the<00:01:35.120> same<00:01:35.330> but<00:01:35.799> the<00:01:36.799> the<00:01:37.729> piston

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
principle is the same but the the piston

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.480 
principle is the same but the the piston
work<00:01:38.210> is<00:01:38.479> much<00:01:38.750> more<00:01:38.960> complicated<00:01:39.290> if<00:01:40.220> you<00:01:40.340> pay

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
work is much more complicated if you pay

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.640 
work is much more complicated if you pay
attention<00:01:40.580> to<00:01:41.090> this<00:01:41.479> vertical<00:01:41.930> piston<00:01:42.440> here

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:42.650 
attention to this vertical piston here

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:45.010 
attention to this vertical piston here
you'll<00:01:42.920> see<00:01:43.100> that<00:01:43.280> it<00:01:43.880> will<00:01:44.210> have<00:01:44.690> quite<00:01:44.990> a

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
you'll see that it will have quite a

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.980 
you'll see that it will have quite a
trip<00:01:45.380> to<00:01:46.280> make<00:01:46.460> it<00:01:46.610> work<00:01:46.820> and<00:01:47.240> let's<00:01:47.600> check

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
trip to make it work and let's check

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.440 
trip to make it work and let's check
that<00:01:48.140> out<00:01:48.260> again<00:01:48.290> and<00:01:48.740> yeah<00:01:49.520> guys<00:01:49.729> I<00:01:50.060> think

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
that out again and yeah guys I think

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.330 
that out again and yeah guys I think
that<00:01:50.750> this<00:01:50.930> is<00:01:51.049> a<00:01:51.080> pretty<00:01:51.350> nice<00:01:51.590> project<00:01:52.159> and

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
that this is a pretty nice project and

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.380 
that this is a pretty nice project and
we<00:01:52.850> are<00:01:52.880> ready<00:01:53.270> for<00:01:53.510> the<00:01:53.689> tutorial<00:01:55.000> yeah<00:01:56.000> so<00:01:56.330> to

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
we are ready for the tutorial yeah so to

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.960 
we are ready for the tutorial yeah so to
start<00:01:56.930> things<00:01:57.170> off<00:01:57.350> we<00:01:57.710> want<00:01:57.950> to<00:01:58.310> have<00:01:58.460> our

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:58.970 
start things off we want to have our

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:01.210 
start things off we want to have our
lamp<00:01:59.450> and<00:01:59.689> decide<00:01:59.990> where<00:02:00.530> it's<00:02:00.710> going<00:02:00.950> to<00:02:01.040> be

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:01.220 
lamp and decide where it's going to be

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.649 
lamp and decide where it's going to be
and<00:02:01.520> we<00:02:02.240> can<00:02:02.270> place<00:02:02.630> one<00:02:03.619> stick<00:02:03.950> based<00:02:04.220> on<00:02:04.369> here

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:05.659 
and we can place one stick based on here

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:09.850 
and we can place one stick based on here
those<00:02:06.499> two<00:02:07.070> sig<00:02:07.310> pistols<00:02:07.490> are<00:02:07.999> going<00:02:08.390> to<00:02:08.860> move

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
those two sig pistols are going to move

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.750 
those two sig pistols are going to move
that<00:02:10.039> block<00:02:10.280> and<00:02:10.989> our<00:02:11.989> input<00:02:12.530> is<00:02:13.220> going<00:02:13.400> to<00:02:13.610> be

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
that block and our input is going to be

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.369 
that block and our input is going to be
right<00:02:14.390> here<00:02:14.420> with<00:02:14.959> the<00:02:15.319> redstone<00:02:15.830> torch<00:02:16.099> and

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:17.379 
right here with the redstone torch and

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:22.020 
right here with the redstone torch and
here<00:02:18.379> also<00:02:18.680> a<00:02:19.370> repeater<00:02:20.239> on<00:02:20.480> two<00:02:21.230> ticks<00:02:21.470> and

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
here also a repeater on two ticks and

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:26.530 
here also a repeater on two ticks and
another<00:02:23.030> solid<00:02:23.930> block<00:02:24.140> so<00:02:24.830> down<00:02:25.370> here<00:02:25.640> we<00:02:25.849> can

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
another solid block so down here we can

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.009 
another solid block so down here we can
have<00:02:26.750> a<00:02:27.200> redstone<00:02:27.769> line<00:02:28.010> going<00:02:28.970> like<00:02:29.420> this<00:02:29.660> and

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:30.019 
have a redstone line going like this and

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:33.880 
have a redstone line going like this and
a<00:02:30.980> repeater<00:02:31.370> on<00:02:31.580> one<00:02:32.450> tick<00:02:32.690> here<00:02:32.959> and<00:02:33.170> another

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
a repeater on one tick here and another

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.030 
a repeater on one tick here and another
piece<00:02:34.129> of<00:02:34.160> redstone<00:02:34.489> dust<00:02:34.700> right<00:02:35.629> here<00:02:36.349> so

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
piece of redstone dust right here so

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.550 
piece of redstone dust right here so
beneath<00:02:37.879> those<00:02:38.209> Pistons<00:02:38.629> you<00:02:38.870> just<00:02:39.110> place<00:02:39.349> a

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
beneath those Pistons you just place a

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.210 
beneath those Pistons you just place a
redstone<00:02:39.769> torch<00:02:40.099> and<00:02:41.170> here<00:02:42.170> we<00:02:42.379> will<00:02:42.620> need<00:02:42.860> a

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
redstone torch and here we will need a

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.550 
redstone torch and here we will need a
regular<00:02:43.730> piston<00:02:43.940> so<00:02:44.390> now<00:02:44.840> a<00:02:44.870> sticky<00:02:45.230> piston

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
regular piston so now a sticky piston

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.750 
regular piston so now a sticky piston
here<00:02:45.829> and<00:02:46.129> break<00:02:46.970> this<00:02:47.120> block<00:02:47.329> place<00:02:47.930> another

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
here and break this block place another

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.839 
here and break this block place another
sticky<00:02:49.760> piston<00:02:50.120> right<00:02:50.930> here<00:02:51.260> and<00:02:51.579> aslan<00:02:52.579> block

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:52.849 
sticky piston right here and aslan block

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:56.680 
sticky piston right here and aslan block
yep<00:02:53.810> so<00:02:54.349> if<00:02:55.069> we<00:02:55.280> now<00:02:55.400> switch<00:02:55.670> over<00:02:55.879> inventory

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
yep so if we now switch over inventory

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:00.009 
yep so if we now switch over inventory
with<00:02:57.379> a<00:02:57.410> bit<00:02:57.709> of<00:02:57.829> magic<00:02:58.099> we<00:02:58.940> if<00:02:59.090> you<00:02:59.120> are

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:00.019

00:03:34.059 --> 00:03:34.069 
again the minecart is out yeah so this

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:38.710 
again the minecart is out yeah so this
is<00:03:34.220> how<00:03:34.340> it<00:03:34.489> works<00:03:34.730> guys<00:03:35.000> and<00:03:35.540> also<00:03:36.489> this<00:03:37.720> some

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
people may claim that this is not the

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:42.580 
people may claim that this is not the
most<00:03:40.190> compact<00:03:40.519> design<00:03:40.700> ever<00:03:41.419> made<00:03:41.720> so<00:03:42.290> we

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
most compact design ever made so we

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:45.039 
most compact design ever made so we
decided<00:03:42.889> to<00:03:42.980> show<00:03:43.250> this<00:03:43.730> one<00:03:44.060> which<00:03:44.419> is<00:03:44.599> even

00:03:45.039 --> 00:03:45.049 
decided to show this one which is even

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:50.259 
decided to show this one which is even
more<00:03:45.290> compact<00:03:45.739> it's<00:03:46.040> like<00:03:46.549> 2<00:03:47.450> by<00:03:47.780> 3<00:03:48.410> by<00:03:48.889> 3<00:03:49.269> but

00:03:50.259 --> 00:03:50.269 
more compact it's like 2 by 3 by 3 but

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:51.909 
more compact it's like 2 by 3 by 3 but
if<00:03:50.540> you<00:03:50.690> press<00:03:50.930> this<00:03:51.049> button<00:03:51.109> now<00:03:51.440> you<00:03:51.709> will

if you press this button now you will
see<00:03:52.220> that<00:03:52.489> it<00:03:52.880> shows<00:03:52.940> the<00:03:53.269> top<00:03:53.660> of<00:03:53.930> the

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:54.139 
see that it shows the top of the

00:03:54.139 --> 00:03:57.400 
see that it shows the top of the
minecart<00:03:54.560> with<00:03:55.220> chest<00:03:55.250> so<00:03:55.790> we<00:03:56.389> sort<00:03:56.870> of<00:03:56.959> solved

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:57.410 
minecart with chest so we sort of solved

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:59.440 
minecart with chest so we sort of solved
this<00:03:57.620> problem<00:03:57.829> with<00:03:58.190> this<00:03:58.370> design<00:03:58.519> and<00:03:58.970> also

00:03:59.440 --> 00:03:59.450 
this problem with this design and also

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:01.629 
this problem with this design and also
it<00:03:59.540> pops<00:03:59.900> out<00:04:00.079> of<00:04:00.260> the<00:04:00.410> floor<00:04:00.620> how<00:04:01.010> amazing

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:01.639 
it pops out of the floor how amazing

00:04:01.639 --> 00:04:04.839 
it pops out of the floor how amazing
that<00:04:01.819> can<00:04:02.000> be<00:04:02.260> so<00:04:03.260> guys<00:04:03.530> this<00:04:04.069> is<00:04:04.220> basically<00:04:04.549> it
