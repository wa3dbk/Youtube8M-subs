00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:04.440
 good guys that give very good 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.569
 welcome back to the channel 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.820
 welcome back to a new video 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.170
 of call of duty advanced warfare we are 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.660
 when you play a duel for teams with 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.920
 the hb teatres insanity is a game 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.529
 that I have kept for some 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.060
 few days on the computer and that you 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.029
 I say when I have something interesting that 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:24.000
 tell them something you want them to know that 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.470
 it is important to take the gameplay and 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.880
 I'll use it to tell you what I have 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.260
 a few things to say no 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.539
 only one I have a few things 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.450
 what to say to you and I think all of them 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.700
 are going to like this environment better one that 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.140
 it has already happened that what has happened 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.850
 I'll start with the bad guys you could 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.090
 say yesterday he uploaded the fifa video with 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.530
 Ã¡lex playing 2 versus 2 and he looked good 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.750
 pixelated what is it that happened that I 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.059
 I had to go to Madrid the index the video 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.640
 I raised it, prepare it, you know what it does 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.020
 time since I was pixelated seeing that 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.530
 happened then that unintentionally had the 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.699
 render from pixel to pixel or the video and not 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.170
 I could change it and when they happen to me 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.930
 things and then I take it change what 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.370
 prepare everything at once so that it is 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.500
 ok the video but I can not do it 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.270
 because I went to Madrid and it became all 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.340
 crazy happened to me 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.990
 the milk obtained with the salted biopic 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.710
 so I apologize for that but 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.969
 well there was once only that it is 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.950
 that I could not change it because 

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:18.810
 I had to go to Madrid and there I did not have 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.119
 the video could not do anything what is it 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.710
 I want to comment and I told you ago 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.630
 a few days I was going to return a series to 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.979
 colombia channel of advance warfare with 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.630
 the call of duty in general but let's go 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.069
 state of vanguard nationality that was 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.270
 he directed it I lose a lot you tell me that 

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:32.039
 because he has not brought him back yet 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.509
 so much so well then just 

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:37.469
 when he was going to bring her, both of them came out 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:40.470
 packages these the 50000 packs 

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:43.170
 of the fifa and 35,000 and 200 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.310
 tropecientosmil and obviously he had 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.810
 to make a payment print that all 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.069
 days too so you have to know 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.349
 that with all the variety that I am 

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:51.750
 bringing to the channel like fifa with call of 

00:01:49.349 --> 00:01:53.819
 duty with the password farc with black ops 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:57.270
 2 that we also have to grab you 

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:58.649
 5 free mode to fifa parties to snapper 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.710
 perkins opening supplies there are many 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.750
 things 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:03.820
 you have to have a control so how 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:06.040
 the steps come out and expire in a day or 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.810
 So something will record me that 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:10.000
 have the pack or verin that this is something 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.590
 of pic and do not worry because in 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.350
 these coming days come back you say me 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.700
 I lose and another thing that I have to tell you 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:18.060
 apart from that I'm like the one is 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.810
 continue very much and will return 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:25.709
 and I think I 've found the shape 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:27.989
 to be able to do streaming on eye console 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:30.540
 what I just said streaming in 720 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:32.430
 streaming in 720 make direct in the 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:35.310
 channel who wants to say this that the 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.349
 openings pack opening supplies 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.670
 not everything stays I like to do the 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:40.260
 shipments edit them a little bit like that with 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.390
 little girl, please tell me the truth 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:45.300
 like those videos of making tracing my 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.470
 film myself but occasionally 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:50.519
 a live in a special education 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:51.959
 because it can happen can happen so that 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:53.400
 you know I 'm trying the tweets 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:55.319
 that you follow me on twitter and facebook 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.390
 I already told you one night I put there a 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:59.010
 little tranquility 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.209
 another activity and with some 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.430
 subscribers I do not know if we're talking 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:03.599
 a thousand and a half only we are not only 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.450
 many people but go when I do 

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:07.739
 even many more but these forms what 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.299
 We were already testing and the truth is that 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:11.459
 it looked good I kept asking me 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:14.130
 I felt that it looked good that it was a 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:16.049
 pretty decent quality and it was constant 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:18.390
 I did not have any I do not know not European go the 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:21.720
 ceips the frames I did not miss anything 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:23.010
 Well, I think I can stream 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.140
 console 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:27.989
 yes I know we were still a long time 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:29.760
 waiting for him tpc I can not make direct 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:30.989
 unfortunately because the ping is super 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.000
 art a connection that I have to be able to 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:34.769
 make them so unfortunately not 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.659
 I can do them I started damn it but 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:37.890
 good for something you start with the 

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:39.299
 we started finding a solution for 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:42.390
 to be able to make us in console that is something 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:44.190
 so probably in the future I do not know 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:46.709
 why do not I know when but I'll say it 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:48.360
 here you have some direct from some 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:50.280
 epic thing or just because I 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:52.230
 project want something because you have 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.129
 youtube or anything other things 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:55.680
 that I am going to tell you now that you are 

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:57.480
 ending the video and you know that 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:00.269
 as I said and it will be another night a 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:02.760
 direct in tweets we open envelopes we play 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:05.010
 to whites 2 we did a handful of 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.690
 things like that implant tranqui if from time to time 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:08.670
 when when I feel like it better 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:10.680
 late night he heard that one day by the 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:12.150
 late when you want to like that in a plan that is not 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.159
 give me time to make a video for visas 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.659
 for youtube or any story because 

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:17.370
 I know that later you get angry because it does not warn 

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:19.739
 did not warn face and live on 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:21.570
 tweets then get lost by good you have 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:23.610
