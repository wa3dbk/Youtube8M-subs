onboard<00:00:31.560> system<00:00:31.949> here<00:00:32.160> my<00:00:32.730> charge<00:00:33.030> is<00:00:33.360> a<00:00:33.410> group

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
onboard system here my charge is a group

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.290 
onboard system here my charge is a group
of<00:00:34.590> lightweight<00:00:34.980> portable<00:00:35.219> chargers<00:00:35.850> with

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
of lightweight portable chargers with

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.690 
of lightweight portable chargers with
all<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.600> cords<00:00:36.870> built-in<00:00:37.290> we<00:00:38.190> even<00:00:38.370> have<00:00:38.670> a

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
all the cords built-in we even have a

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.330 
all the cords built-in we even have a
little<00:00:39.180> two<00:00:39.540> prong<00:00:39.840> plug<00:00:39.870> for<00:00:40.620> fast<00:00:40.860> recharge

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
little two prong plug for fast recharge

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.520 
little two prong plug for fast recharge
so<00:00:42.149> you'll<00:00:42.329> see<00:00:42.570> we<00:00:42.960> have<00:00:43.050> three<00:00:43.260> different

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
so you'll see we have three different

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.590 
so you'll see we have three different
devices<00:00:43.739> right<00:00:44.160> here<00:00:44.460> we<00:00:44.969> have<00:00:45.120> a<00:00:45.149> nine

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
devices right here we have a nine

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.180 
devices right here we have a nine
thousand<00:00:46.020> milliamp<00:00:46.289> and<00:00:46.590> I'll<00:00:46.649> pull<00:00:46.860> this<00:00:46.980> up

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
thousand milliamp and I'll pull this up

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.920 
thousand milliamp and I'll pull this up
so<00:00:47.370> you<00:00:47.399> guys<00:00:47.610> can<00:00:47.850> see<00:00:48.090> it<00:00:48.210> and<00:00:48.390> what<00:00:48.809> makes

so you guys can see it and what makes

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.740 
so you guys can see it and what makes
this<00:00:49.170> really<00:00:49.289> cool<00:00:49.559> is<00:00:49.800> that<00:00:50.250> all<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:51.180> devices

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
this really cool is that all the devices

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.569 
this really cool is that all the devices
all<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.289> connectors<00:00:52.770> are<00:00:52.980> built-in<00:00:53.309> right

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
all the connectors are built-in right

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.869 
all the connectors are built-in right
here<00:00:53.940> for<00:00:54.600> easy<00:00:54.780> charging<00:00:55.500> you<00:00:56.190> have<00:00:56.370> a<00:00:56.399> micro

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
here for easy charging you have a micro

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.229 
here for easy charging you have a micro
you<00:00:57.390> have<00:00:57.649> the<00:00:58.649> new<00:00:58.829> lightning<00:00:59.430> connector<00:00:59.609> and

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
you have the new lightning connector and

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.479 
you have the new lightning connector and
of<00:01:00.600> course<00:01:00.899> if<00:01:01.199> neither<00:01:01.829> of<00:01:01.980> these<00:01:02.100> help<00:01:02.399> you

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
of course if neither of these help you

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.840 
of course if neither of these help you
or<00:01:02.579> you<00:01:02.699> have<00:01:02.820> two<00:01:03.030> iOS<00:01:03.480> devices<00:01:04.489> you<00:01:05.489> can<00:01:05.670> use

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
or you have two iOS devices you can use

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.850 
or you have two iOS devices you can use
the<00:01:06.060> USB<00:01:06.510> port<00:01:07.020> here<00:01:07.049> on<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.350> bottom<00:01:07.680> so<00:01:07.799> you

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
the USB port here on the bottom so you

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.740 
the USB port here on the bottom so you
can<00:01:07.950> actually<00:01:08.130> charge<00:01:08.430> your<00:01:08.640> iPad<00:01:09.000> and<00:01:09.330> you

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
can actually charge your iPad and you

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.750 
can actually charge your iPad and you
can<00:01:09.930> charge<00:01:10.170> your<00:01:10.470> iPhone<00:01:10.979> at<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.250> same<00:01:11.460> time

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
can charge your iPhone at the same time

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.880 
can charge your iPhone at the same time
so<00:01:12.000> it's<00:01:12.150> an<00:01:12.240> all-in-one<00:01:13.020> basically<00:01:13.710> it's

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
so it's an all-in-one basically it's

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.499 
so it's an all-in-one basically it's
really<00:01:14.010> an<00:01:14.189> all-in-one<00:01:14.490> for<00:01:14.850> anybody<00:01:15.240> who<00:01:15.390> has

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
if you're you know you have a Wi-Fi unit

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.380 
if you're you know you have a Wi-Fi unit
and<00:01:19.380> you<00:01:19.470> have<00:01:19.650> two<00:01:20.009> iOS<00:01:20.400> devices<00:01:20.729> guilty

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
and you have two iOS devices guilty

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.390 
and you have two iOS devices guilty
exactly<00:01:22.320> this<00:01:22.619> is<00:01:22.740> exactly<00:01:23.100> what<00:01:23.280> you<00:01:23.369> need

perspective this is our current my

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.490 
perspective this is our current my
charge<00:01:27.270> solution<00:01:27.659> right<00:01:27.750> now<00:01:27.810> all<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.229> courts

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
charge solution right now all the courts

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.499 
charge solution right now all the courts
are<00:01:28.619> built<00:01:28.799> in<00:01:28.950> three<00:01:29.729> thousand<00:01:30.060> million<00:01:30.299> this

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
are built in three thousand million this

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.240 
are built in three thousand million this
is<00:01:30.659> the<00:01:30.780> 3000<00:01:31.290> milliamp<00:01:31.560> and<00:01:31.829> it<00:01:31.920> has<00:01:32.070> the

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
is the 3000 milliamp and it has the

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.289 
is the 3000 milliamp and it has the
30-pin<00:01:32.670> now<00:01:33.770> this<00:01:34.770> is<00:01:34.979> how<00:01:35.100> small<00:01:35.460> we've<00:01:36.119> made

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
30-pin now this is how small we've made

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.510 
30-pin now this is how small we've made
the<00:01:36.479> new<00:01:36.600> 3000<00:01:37.259> milliamp<00:01:37.470> so<00:01:37.829> its<00:01:37.979> own<00:01:38.159> those

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
the new 3000 milliamp so its own those

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.069 
the new 3000 milliamp so its own those
are<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.820> same<00:01:39.060> basically<00:01:39.630> but<00:01:39.750> this<00:01:39.900> is<00:01:39.990> the

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
are the same basically but this is the

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.499 
are the same basically but this is the
new<00:01:40.200> one<00:01:40.380> exactly<00:01:41.130> and<00:01:41.610> this<00:01:41.820> all<00:01:42.060> has<00:01:42.329> the

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
new one exactly and this all has the

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.510 
new one exactly and this all has the
cords<00:01:42.810> built<00:01:43.020> in<00:01:43.200> you<00:01:43.380> have<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.710> micro<00:01:44.100> here

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
cords built in you have the micro here

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.789 
cords built in you have the micro here
and<00:01:44.700> you<00:01:44.790> have<00:01:45.000> them<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.720> lightning<00:01:46.229> here<00:01:46.590> and
