think<00:01:30.750> that<00:01:31.079> was<00:01:31.170> pretty<00:01:31.350> interesting<00:01:31.710> once<00:01:32.070> i

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
think that was pretty interesting once i

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.819 
think that was pretty interesting once i
started<00:01:32.579> using<00:01:32.850> and<00:01:33.150> going<00:01:34.079> into<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.500> files

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
started using and going into the files

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.130 
started using and going into the files
and<00:01:35.220> a<00:01:35.369> couple<00:01:35.820> of<00:01:36.030> menus<00:01:36.210> here<00:01:36.540> but<00:01:36.840> that<00:01:36.990> was

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
and a couple of menus here but that was

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.569 
and a couple of menus here but that was
just<00:01:37.170> something<00:01:37.590> that<00:01:37.770> really<00:01:38.070> got<00:01:38.340> me<00:01:38.549> going

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
just something that really got me going

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.120 
just something that really got me going
so<00:01:39.479> let's<00:01:39.630> jump<00:01:39.869> in<00:01:40.020> it<00:01:40.170> and<00:01:40.320> see<00:01:40.590> what's<00:01:40.799> going

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
so let's jump in it and see what's going

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.010

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
youtube vimeo or flash you would have

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:48.889 
youtube vimeo or flash you would have
those<00:01:47.369> options<00:01:47.610> right<00:01:47.970> here<00:01:48.030> which<00:01:48.720> of<00:01:48.869> course

those options right here which of course

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.039 
those options right here which of course
i<00:01:49.350> wouldn't<00:01:49.710> recommend<00:01:50.630> personally<00:01:51.630> because

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
i wouldn't recommend personally because

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.230 
i wouldn't recommend personally because

full exporting you know resolution if

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.420 
full exporting you know resolution if
you<00:01:57.299> were<00:01:57.450> to<00:01:57.600> do<00:01:57.719> 1080p<00:01:58.229> for<00:01:58.590> example<00:01:59.040> you

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.550 
whatever corresponds to the resolutions
and<00:03:05.730> the<00:03:05.820> dimensions<00:03:06.330> that<00:03:06.840> you<00:03:06.990> put<00:03:07.260> in<00:03:07.440> the

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
and the dimensions that you put in the

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.980 
and the dimensions that you put in the
last<00:03:07.800> viewing<00:03:08.430> when<00:03:08.850> you're<00:03:09.000> about<00:03:09.150> to<00:03:09.420> export

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:09.990 
last viewing when you're about to export

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:11.270 
last viewing when you're about to export
your<00:03:10.020> video<00:03:10.200> that's<00:03:10.680> what's<00:03:10.950> going<00:03:11.160> to<00:03:11.250> show

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
your video that's what's going to show

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.250 
your video that's what's going to show
up<00:03:11.430> in<00:03:11.610> the<00:03:11.700> dimensions<00:03:12.180> of<00:03:12.330> your<00:03:12.600> resolution

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
up in the dimensions of your resolution

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:14.600 
up in the dimensions of your resolution
so<00:03:13.380> that<00:03:13.440> may<00:03:13.620> have<00:03:13.740> been<00:03:13.830> confusing<00:03:14.310> but<00:03:14.490> i'll

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
so that may have been confusing but i'll

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:15.740 
so that may have been confusing but i'll
show<00:03:14.760> you<00:03:14.820> what<00:03:14.970> that<00:03:15.000> means<00:03:15.120> in<00:03:15.390> just<00:03:15.630> a

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
show you what that means in just a

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.540 
show you what that means in just a
minute<00:03:15.900> here<00:03:16.020> well<00:03:16.650> go<00:03:16.770> ahead<00:03:16.890> and<00:03:17.070> just

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:17.550 
minute here well go ahead and just

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:19.760 
minute here well go ahead and just
explore<00:03:18.090> so<00:03:18.360> this<00:03:18.750> is<00:03:18.870> also<00:03:19.050> going<00:03:19.290> to<00:03:19.350> be<00:03:19.500> how

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:19.770 
explore so this is also going to be how

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:22.370 
explore so this is also going to be how
you<00:03:20.209> typically<00:03:21.209> want<00:03:21.330> to<00:03:21.480> export<00:03:21.930> your<00:03:22.020> videos

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
you typically want to export your videos

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:23.570 
you typically want to export your videos
for<00:03:22.560> the<00:03:22.620> best<00:03:22.800> quality<00:03:23.040> because<00:03:23.430> i've<00:03:23.550> been

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:23.580 
for the best quality because i've been

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:25.490 
for the best quality because i've been
using<00:03:24.180> it<00:03:24.450> and<00:03:24.540> playing<00:03:24.720> around<00:03:24.870> with<00:03:25.140> it<00:03:25.200> if

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
using it and playing around with it if

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.610 
using it and playing around with it if
you<00:03:25.830> want<00:03:25.980> to<00:03:26.040> view<00:03:26.360> h.264<00:03:27.360> that<00:03:27.660> is<00:03:27.870> mainly

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
you want to view h.264 that is mainly

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.000 
you want to view h.264 that is mainly
the<00:03:29.480> regular<00:03:30.480> way<00:03:30.750> of<00:03:30.930> exporting<00:03:31.440> video<00:03:31.620> but

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
the regular way of exporting video but

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.400 
the regular way of exporting video but
as<00:03:32.190> i<00:03:32.340> said<00:03:32.370> i<00:03:32.640> have<00:03:33.000> done<00:03:33.240> other<00:03:33.510> resolutions

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
as i said i have done other resolutions

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.590 
as i said i have done other resolutions
before<00:03:34.950> as<00:03:35.310> you<00:03:35.459> can<00:03:35.580> see<00:03:35.700> i<00:03:35.730> have<00:03:35.820> a<00:03:35.910> bunch<00:03:36.240> set

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
before as you can see i have a bunch set

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:40.100 
before as you can see i have a bunch set
here<00:03:36.990> but<00:03:37.620> i<00:03:37.650> also<00:03:37.890> use<00:03:38.190> the<00:03:38.510> x264<00:03:39.510> encoder<00:03:39.660> now

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.110 
here but i also use the x264 encoder now

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:41.900 
here but i also use the x264 encoder now
I<00:03:40.140> did<00:03:40.410> a<00:03:40.440> video<00:03:40.620> on<00:03:40.770> this<00:03:41.100> you<00:03:41.580> could<00:03:41.700> go<00:03:41.880> ahead

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
I did a video on this you could go ahead

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:43.430 
I did a video on this you could go ahead
and<00:03:42.090> check<00:03:42.360> it<00:03:42.510> out<00:03:42.630> and<00:03:42.870> it's<00:03:42.959> really<00:03:43.110> built

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
and check it out and it's really built

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.550 
and check it out and it's really built
on<00:03:43.650> the<00:03:43.860> H<00:03:44.010> dot<00:03:44.310> 264<00:03:44.989> infrastructure<00:03:45.989> but<00:03:46.440> it

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
on the H dot 264 infrastructure but it

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.110 
on the H dot 264 infrastructure but it
lets<00:03:46.709> you<00:03:46.860> go<00:03:47.040> into<00:03:47.250> the<00:03:47.340> option<00:03:47.760> so<00:03:47.940> if<00:03:48.000> we're

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
lets you go into the option so if we're

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:53.270 
lets you go into the option so if we're
good<00:03:48.239> to<00:03:48.510> go<00:03:48.540> ahead<00:03:48.900> go<00:03:49.680> back<00:03:50.010> to<00:03:51.380> h.264<00:03:52.380> you'll

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
good to go ahead go back to h.264 you'll

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.070 
good to go ahead go back to h.264 you'll
see<00:03:53.489> that<00:03:53.700> option<00:03:53.940> tab<00:03:54.420> that<00:03:54.660> was<00:03:54.810> just

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:55.080 
see that option tab that was just

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:56.900 
see that option tab that was just
previously<00:03:55.709> there<00:03:56.010> is<00:03:56.220> not<00:03:56.430> there<00:03:56.670> anymore

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
previously there is not there anymore

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:58.550 
previously there is not there anymore
and<00:03:57.330> you<00:03:57.540> basically<00:03:57.690> have<00:03:58.080> the<00:03:58.110> surface

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
and you basically have the surface

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.040 
and you basically have the surface
options<00:03:59.070> for<00:03:59.250> keyframes<00:03:59.700> data<00:04:00.030> rate<00:04:00.270> quality

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:01.050 
options for keyframes data rate quality

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:03.320 
options for keyframes data rate quality
compressor<00:04:01.590> and<00:04:01.650> etc<00:04:01.920> let's<00:04:02.610> go<00:04:02.760> ahead<00:04:02.910> and<00:04:03.060> go

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:03.330 
compressor and etc let's go ahead and go

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:06.199 
compressor and etc let's go ahead and go
back<00:04:03.360> to<00:04:03.950> x264<00:04:04.950> and<00:04:05.250> you'll<00:04:05.489> see<00:04:05.670> an<00:04:05.760> options

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:06.209 
back to x264 and you'll see an options

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:09.170 
back to x264 and you'll see an options
tab<00:04:06.450> came<00:04:06.720> in<00:04:06.900> which<00:04:07.050> a<00:04:07.170> bunch<00:04:07.590> of<00:04:07.920> new<00:04:08.190> you

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
tab came in which a bunch of new you

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:10.370 
tab came in which a bunch of new you
know<00:04:09.300> settings<00:04:09.690> and<00:04:09.840> this<00:04:09.930> is<00:04:10.050> really<00:04:10.170> going

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:10.380 
know settings and this is really going

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.110 
know settings and this is really going
under<00:04:10.709> the<00:04:10.830> hood<00:04:11.010> so<00:04:11.190> i'll<00:04:11.640> give<00:04:11.820> you<00:04:11.910> guys<00:04:12.060> a

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
under the hood so i'll give you guys a

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.060 
under the hood so i'll give you guys a
snapshot<00:04:12.600> right<00:04:13.050> here<00:04:13.350> as<00:04:13.440> you<00:04:13.560> can<00:04:13.620> see<00:04:13.770> of

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:14.070 
snapshot right here as you can see of

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:15.530 
snapshot right here as you can see of
what<00:04:14.340> the<00:04:14.489> settings<00:04:14.850> are<00:04:15.000> instead<00:04:15.300> of<00:04:15.360> me

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
what the settings are instead of me

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.449 
what the settings are instead of me
going<00:04:15.570> through<00:04:15.989> them<00:04:16.140> you<00:04:16.919> know<00:04:17.040> single<00:04:17.370> by

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
going through them you know single by

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:19.460 
going through them you know single by
single<00:04:17.730> click<00:04:18.120> so<00:04:18.780> you<00:04:18.870> can<00:04:19.020> see<00:04:19.200> what<00:04:19.320> the

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
single click so you can see what the

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:22.460 
single click so you can see what the
best<00:04:19.650> settings<00:04:20.010> are<00:04:20.220> when<00:04:20.640> using<00:04:21.109> x264<00:04:22.109> it

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
best settings are when using x264 it

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.159 
best settings are when using x264 it
really<00:04:22.830> gives<00:04:22.979> it<00:04:23.220> a<00:04:23.340> more<00:04:23.640> sharper<00:04:24.270> touch<00:04:24.900> to

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:25.169 
really gives it a more sharper touch to

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:25.730 
really gives it a more sharper touch to
the<00:04:25.289> video

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 
the video

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:27.890 
the video
and<00:04:25.889> it<00:04:26.370> actually<00:04:26.610> enhances<00:04:27.000> the<00:04:27.449> colors<00:04:27.750> as

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 
and it actually enhances the colors as

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.680 
and it actually enhances the colors as
well<00:04:27.930> so<00:04:28.229> that's<00:04:28.319> why<00:04:28.560> i<00:04:28.590> like<00:04:28.860> doing<00:04:29.240> x264<00:04:30.240> but

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:30.690 
well so that's why i like doing x264 but

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:32.390 
well so that's why i like doing x264 but
for<00:04:30.810> everyone<00:04:31.080> doing<00:04:31.380> a<00:04:31.470> standard<00:04:31.919> encode<00:04:32.280> i'm

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 
for everyone doing a standard encode i'm

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:33.770 
for everyone doing a standard encode i'm
going<00:04:32.550> to<00:04:32.610> show<00:04:32.699> you<00:04:32.729> how<00:04:32.940> it<00:04:33.090> goes<00:04:33.240> right<00:04:33.449> here

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:33.780 
going to show you how it goes right here

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:34.790 
going to show you how it goes right here
we're<00:04:34.020> going<00:04:34.139> to<00:04:34.229> click<00:04:34.349> the<00:04:34.530> framerate

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 
we're going to click the framerate

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.490 
we're going to click the framerate
current<00:04:35.699> and<00:04:35.849> not<00:04:36.030> really<00:04:36.240> change<00:04:36.599> that<00:04:36.780> or<00:04:36.990> go

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500 
current and not really change that or go

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.100 
current and not really change that or go
to<00:04:37.560> automatic<00:04:38.250> keyframes<00:04:38.819> go<00:04:39.509> almost<00:04:39.870> to

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.110 
to automatic keyframes go almost to
