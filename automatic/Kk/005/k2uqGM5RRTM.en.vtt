00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:10.669
 It is Kuroshio Town, Kochi Prefecture 

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:13.959
 It is located in three ranks of five thousand points from now on 

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:16.029
 In March 2006 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:20.669
 It was marked that the kitchen town and the former Saga town merged and were born 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:27.770
 Such as abundant agricultural, forestry and fisheries resources and nationally-designed sports facilities 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:30.770
 It is a region with regional resources 

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:34.660
 However 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:40.720
 The population according to the 2005 census is 13,003 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.370
 771 compared to 2000 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.340
 Australia's .4% decrease 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.670
 On top of that, the severe situation of severe employment in the area is wide 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.670
 It has become 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.500
 To build the foundation for the realization of these dreams 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.110
 Mr. Aoi of Kuroshio Town Industry Promotion Office 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.040
 We have promoted the business to realize the creation of employment 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.100
 It is a plan to start with only business employment statistics on that 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.510
 1.3 at excel 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:28.990
 I think it was 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.180
 In such a situation, still among the townspeople's slow questionnaires 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:33.810
 Also 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.340
 Mind to do the top priority as administration 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.790
 It's about creating a place to work 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:42.450
 There were so many opinions to say 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.060
 We are promoting a variety of initiatives so far 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.580
 Even though 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.600
 There is no effective hand 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.049
 I couldn't put it in a book, but also surprisingly 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:54.650
 The word that the business of the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare can also be introduced 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:57.650
 Because there was so actively 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.580
 Business was removed for package, but let's realize this creation business 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.810
 There is a tendency to work true for the implementation of 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.559
 And to create place of employment in this business 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:15.449
 As well as using the blessings of the Kuroshio if it is bonito 

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:23.539
 Kuroshio Town is large enough to maintain the natural environment and .pa citrus products 

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:24.789
 Groove etc 

00:02:24.789 --> 00:02:29.439
 The basics of Japanese food combined with one year high 

00:02:29.439 --> 00:02:32.439
 I tried to add value 

00:02:33.339 --> 00:02:34.589
 That also 

00:02:34.589 --> 00:02:39.009
 Chairman of NGK Insulators, making use of the government's creditworthiness and the mobility of the private sector 

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:42.389
 I say it's a body 

00:02:42.389 --> 00:02:46.349
 Mr. Yamanaka of the council in charge of this business said 

00:02:46.969 --> 00:02:50.290
 In the package where you will hire activities 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.219
 I thought to make it happen 

00:02:53.219 --> 00:02:55.799
 It is also the Teshiogawa 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:59.790
 It is a survey of 851,000 people while collaborating with other universities 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:00.839
 Investigate the ingredients 

00:03:00.839 --> 00:03:04.769
 We will hold a seminar for commentators First year nationwide 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:10.189
 The first collaboration exhibition of the country's first collaboration exhibition to gather Katsura intellectuals 

00:03:10.189 --> 00:03:13.109
 We did it by a broken person last year 

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:16.859
 With regard to the part of product development that resumed 

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:17.949
 Is up 

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:19.639
 Make things 

00:03:19.639 --> 00:03:22.739
 I understand that you eat really raw from your family 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:26.479
 Though I was in contact with the sliding town 

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:29.589
 What was the purpose to do one pr to have you see that 

00:03:29.589 --> 00:03:32.589
 I'm thinking about trying to make 

00:03:32.589 --> 00:03:34.649
 I just came 

00:03:34.649 --> 00:03:35.729
 During that 

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:38.849
 The effect was steadily appearing 

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:43.799
 It is introduced in the bonito seahorse stand limitation, and the date after the next day enters. 

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:46.019
 What 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:49.289
 And in the product development of Mr. Furo 51 

00:03:49.289 --> 00:03:52.889
 In one work 57:00 developed in one year 

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:57.159
 We developed by combining Mr. Kuroshio's late husband sugarcane etc. 

00:03:57.159 --> 00:04:00.159
 It will only be sold as a pharmaceutical 

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:07.379
 Kuroshio data is Kato Kirin 

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:11.029
 It will be adopted in the gorilla of Tokyo Station not first aid duty 

00:04:11.029 --> 00:04:14.029
 I raised the second one by the judgment 

00:04:18.439 --> 00:04:21.659
 From such product development and expansion of sales channels 

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:24.259
 Employment has also been born 

00:04:24.259 --> 00:04:28.849
 Kuroshio Ichiban-kan and Isujuku Masayuki from Hyogo Prefecture are also one of them. 

00:04:29.809 --> 00:04:32.199
 There is an estimate that I love surfing 

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:35.499
 What was the reason I wanted to work in this town? 

00:04:35.499 --> 00:04:37.719
 Maybe the sea is beautiful 

00:04:37.719 --> 00:04:40.969
 There are a lot of that remarks 

00:04:40.969 --> 00:04:44.469
 But with that as it has fallen 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.449
 friendly 

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:50.389
 This summer 

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:51.789
 Do you want to live forever 

00:04:51.789 --> 00:04:56.400
 Implementing preservation and resignation, goals from the protesters and the future 

00:04:56.399 --> 00:04:58.409
 Also about 

00:04:58.409 --> 00:04:59.470
 this time 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:04.970
 When making concrete products in the business of the Econo Ming 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:09.490
 First of all, study the software business of what to do 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:12.580
 So what does it mean that you are making products 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:15.830
 In a sense, that means 50/50 training 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:17.469
 I came to this house 

00:05:17.469 --> 00:05:21.749
 Such an incident can be sung enough next time 

00:05:21.749 --> 00:05:26.319
 People who have the consciousness after all 

00:05:26.319 --> 00:05:28.699
 The human resources who are going to work on such a thing 

00:05:28.699 --> 00:05:32.820
 Esso is coming and you will not lose this 

00:05:32.819 --> 00:05:36.289
 It will not be our administration's role to connect three 

00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:38.960
 I think 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:42.490
 Konno announced three more flights in the market 

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:45.430
 Development of regional brand products 

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:49.740
 Attracting sports camps and developing experience-based tourism programs 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:51.719
 By using 

00:05:51.719 --> 00:05:54.499
 We plan activation of related industry 

00:05:54.499 --> 00:05:57.369
 It aims to increase employment opportunities
