he's visiting and he was doing a little
work<00:01:37.869> out<00:01:38.079> in<00:01:38.200> the<00:01:38.229> yard<00:01:38.499> to<00:01:38.679> help<00:01:38.829> out<00:01:39.039> and<00:01:39.420> he

work out in the yard to help out and he

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.239 
work out in the yard to help out and he
he<00:01:40.959> was<00:01:41.079> shoveling<00:01:41.409> because<00:01:41.799> we're<00:01:41.979> like

00:01:42.239 --> 00:01:42.249 
he was shoveling because we're like

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:44.429 
he was shoveling because we're like
cutting<00:01:42.549> down<00:01:42.670> a<00:01:42.700> tree<00:01:43.229> you<00:01:44.229> know<00:01:44.319> I<00:01:44.350> was

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:44.439 
cutting down a tree you know I was

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:46.980 
cutting down a tree you know I was
getting<00:01:44.679> too<00:01:44.829> big<00:01:45.039> and<00:01:45.280> the<00:01:46.270> I<00:01:46.299> guess<00:01:46.630> this<00:01:46.780> is

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:46.990 
getting too big and the I guess this is

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:48.209 
getting too big and the I guess this is
the<00:01:47.020> internet<00:01:47.499> wire<00:01:47.709> you<00:01:47.950> know<00:01:48.069> that

00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:48.219 
the internet wire you know that

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:50.249 
the internet wire you know that
obviously<00:01:48.399> provides<00:01:49.030> the<00:01:49.179> internet<00:01:49.539> was<00:01:49.990> like

00:01:50.249 --> 00:01:50.259 
obviously provides the internet was like

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:52.349 
obviously provides the internet was like
six<00:01:50.649> inches<00:01:50.799> under<00:01:51.340> the<00:01:51.490> ground<00:01:51.700> or<00:01:52.060> something

00:01:52.349 --> 00:01:52.359 
six inches under the ground or something

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:54.359 
six inches under the ground or something
I've<00:01:52.749> arise<00:01:53.200> in<00:01:53.439> the<00:01:53.529> you<00:01:53.590> know<00:01:53.649> file<00:01:54.009> so<00:01:54.340> I

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:54.369 
I've arise in the you know file so I

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:56.519 
I've arise in the you know file so I
have<00:01:54.490> a<00:01:54.549> good<00:01:54.700> internet<00:01:54.850> company<00:01:55.479> but<00:01:55.659> it<00:01:56.409> was

00:01:56.519 --> 00:01:56.529 
have a good internet company but it was

00:01:56.529 --> 00:01:58.949 
have a good internet company but it was
kind<00:01:56.709> of<00:01:56.740> it<00:01:57.039> was<00:01:57.100> really<00:01:57.429> stupid<00:01:57.759> but<00:01:58.659> anyway

00:01:58.949 --> 00:01:58.959 
kind of it was really stupid but anyway

00:01:58.959 --> 00:02:01.050 
kind of it was really stupid but anyway
so<00:01:59.020> with<00:01:59.350> a<00:01:59.380> shovel<00:01:59.709> basically<00:02:00.639> just<00:02:00.670> split

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
so with a shovel basically just split

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:02.459 
so with a shovel basically just split
the<00:02:01.149> thing<00:02:01.329> in<00:02:01.479> half<00:02:01.630> so<00:02:02.020> that's<00:02:02.259> why<00:02:02.439> I

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:02.469 
the thing in half so that's why I

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:03.749 
the thing in half so that's why I
haven't<00:02:02.709> been<00:02:02.829> uploading<00:02:03.069> the<00:02:03.310> past<00:02:03.490> couple

haven't been uploading the past couple

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:06.179 
haven't been uploading the past couple
days<00:02:03.999> is<00:02:04.469> obviously<00:02:05.469> because<00:02:05.709> I've<00:02:05.859> had<00:02:06.039> no

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:06.189 
days is obviously because I've had no

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:08.639

basically<00:03:28.270> what<00:03:28.540> I've<00:03:28.630> been<00:03:28.720> trying<00:03:28.900> to<00:03:29.080> do

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200

four before she became game commentaries

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:39.000 
four before she became game commentaries
because<00:03:37.210> that<00:03:37.420> would<00:03:37.540> be<00:03:37.570> a<00:03:37.690> blast<00:03:38.080> but<00:03:38.530> I

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:16.779 
actually the reason I bought a capture
card<00:06:15.050> way<00:06:15.469> back<00:06:15.709> about<00:06:16.039> a<00:06:16.099> year<00:06:16.369> and<00:06:16.639> a<00:06:16.759> half

00:06:16.779 --> 00:06:16.789 
card way back about a year and a half

00:06:16.789 --> 00:06:18.999 
card way back about a year and a half
ago<00:06:17.059> or<00:06:17.389> so<00:06:17.599> that's<00:06:18.169> that's<00:06:18.559> the<00:06:18.770> main<00:06:18.979> reason

00:06:18.999 --> 00:06:19.009 
ago or so that's that's the main reason

00:06:19.009 --> 00:06:20.889 
ago or so that's that's the main reason
I<00:06:19.490> bought<00:06:19.699> ones<00:06:19.969> because<00:06:20.240> i<00:06:20.330> got<00:06:20.449> bored<00:06:20.509> with

00:06:20.889 --> 00:06:20.899 
I bought ones because i got bored with

00:06:20.899 --> 00:06:23.109 
I bought ones because i got bored with
rank<00:06:21.169> you<00:06:22.039> know<00:06:22.129> if<00:06:22.219> they<00:06:22.339> had<00:06:22.490> a<00:06:22.520> reup<00:06:22.909> mode

00:06:23.109 --> 00:06:23.119 
rank you know if they had a reup mode

00:06:23.119 --> 00:06:24.669 
rank you know if they had a reup mode
maybe<00:06:23.389> i<00:06:23.539> would<00:06:23.749> not<00:06:23.869> even<00:06:24.050> record<00:06:24.499> you<00:06:24.649> know

00:06:24.669 --> 00:06:24.679 
maybe i would not even record you know

00:06:24.679 --> 00:06:26.499 
maybe i would not even record you know
because<00:06:24.979> i<00:06:25.069> might<00:06:25.399> have<00:06:25.550> still<00:06:25.939> been<00:06:25.999> content

00:06:26.499 --> 00:06:26.509 
because i might have still been content

00:06:26.509 --> 00:06:28.239 
because i might have still been content
with<00:06:26.599> playing<00:06:26.899> ranked<00:06:27.259> but<00:06:27.439> i<00:06:27.619> think<00:06:28.129> it's

00:06:28.239 --> 00:06:28.249 
with playing ranked but i think it's

00:06:28.249 --> 00:06:30.009 
with playing ranked but i think it's
going<00:06:28.369> to<00:06:28.490> make<00:06:28.550> it<00:06:28.699> a<00:06:28.759> lot<00:06:28.939> better<00:06:28.969> for<00:06:29.479> you

00:06:30.009 --> 00:06:30.019 
going to make it a lot better for you

00:06:30.019 --> 00:06:32.259 
going to make it a lot better for you

00:06:33.999 --> 00:06:34.009 
again cuz like I said I've tone that

00:06:34.009 --> 00:06:35.799 
again cuz like I said I've tone that
down<00:06:34.069> a<00:06:34.249> little<00:06:34.339> been<00:06:34.759> playing<00:06:35.029> this<00:06:35.149> gb<00:06:35.569> and

00:06:35.799 --> 00:06:35.809 
down a little been playing this gb and

00:06:35.809 --> 00:06:37.629 
down a little been playing this gb and
everything<00:06:36.199> but<00:06:36.709> I<00:06:36.769> i<00:06:36.919> might<00:06:37.309> play<00:06:37.399> a<00:06:37.490> little

00:06:37.629 --> 00:06:37.639 
everything but I i might play a little

00:06:37.639 --> 00:06:38.949 
everything but I i might play a little
bit<00:06:37.789> more<00:06:37.939> ranked<00:06:38.330> and<00:06:38.419> everything<00:06:38.749> and<00:06:38.869> I

00:06:38.949 --> 00:06:38.959 
bit more ranked and everything and I

00:06:38.959 --> 00:06:40.149 
bit more ranked and everything and I
think<00:06:39.169> it'll<00:06:39.319> just<00:06:39.469> make<00:06:39.589> it<00:06:39.649> more<00:06:39.889> fun<00:06:40.129> for

00:06:40.149 --> 00:06:40.159 
think it'll just make it more fun for

00:06:40.159 --> 00:06:41.919 
think it'll just make it more fun for
everyone<00:06:40.519> else<00:06:40.819> to<00:06:41.059> have<00:06:41.629> some<00:06:41.809> more

00:06:41.919 --> 00:06:41.929 
everyone else to have some more

00:06:41.929 --> 00:06:44.409 
everyone else to have some more
replayability<00:06:42.529> but<00:06:43.219> anyways<00:06:43.490> so<00:06:43.699> really

00:06:44.409 --> 00:06:44.419
