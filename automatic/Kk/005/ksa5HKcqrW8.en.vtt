why this one is better is we can put it

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:39.189 
why this one is better is we can put it
in<00:03:34.829> coca-cola<00:03:35.430> Nutella<00:03:36.299> it<00:03:36.690> has<00:03:37.440> protection

00:03:39.189 --> 00:03:39.199 
in coca-cola Nutella it has protection

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:43.219 
in coca-cola Nutella it has protection
that<00:03:40.199> but<00:03:41.099> she<00:03:41.340> say<00:03:41.579> no<00:03:41.970> but<00:03:42.959> it<00:03:43.109> has

00:03:43.219 --> 00:03:43.229 
that but she say no but it has

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
protection it is water-resistant and it

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.849 
protection it is water-resistant and it
will<00:03:47.609> probably<00:03:47.909> survive<00:03:48.500> even<00:03:49.500> though<00:03:49.739> it's

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:49.859 
will probably survive even though it's

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:51.199 
will probably survive even though it's
not<00:03:49.949> guaranteed<00:03:50.370> because<00:03:50.549> you<00:03:50.760> can<00:03:50.909> move<00:03:51.030> the

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
not guaranteed because you can move the

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:53.629 
not guaranteed because you can move the
back<00:03:51.419> but<00:03:51.840> if<00:03:52.590> you<00:03:52.829> are<00:03:52.949> careful<00:03:53.220> it's

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:53.639 
back but if you are careful it's

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:55.039 
back but if you are careful it's
probably<00:03:54.090> going<00:03:54.209> to<00:03:54.269> survive<00:03:54.479> water<00:03:54.840> pretty

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:55.049 
probably going to survive water pretty

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:58.610 
probably going to survive water pretty
