 as you were but I fell but the 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:29.329
 classificatory is it returns the red to 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.480
 these FIFA World Cup qualifiers 

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:33.710
 brazil of 2014 and we are precisely 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:36.910
 with one of the players who also 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:39.400
 come back remember after the remembered and 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:42.140
 baptized that gonzalo jara gonzalo 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:44.030
 thank you for receiving us hello good 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.850
 afternoons now the first thing is to ask you 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:48.440
 how does this return to the national team take you 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:51.440
 Chilean, you could talk to your 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:53.089
 colleagues with the coaching staff well the 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:56.379
 I'm really happy to come back 

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:56.379
 to the selection 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:02.450
 one tries to hope to be a contribution in what 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.190
 which is the one in this tie that we 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:05.660
 they have first now not only did you have 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:08.600
 possibility we know that 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:10.130
 you spoke previously with the body 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.180
 technician you could talk to them now 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.920
 with your classmates how was the 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.770
 receiving them rationing 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.810
 the best obviously here we have a great 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.920
 friendship with everything for the fact that we 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.330
 we know from a young age most 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.220
 and the rest with the coaching staff 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:27.310
 spoke what is it that we were going to be today 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:29.590
 day and this week not only if we could 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:32.680
 evaluate how this process was outside 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:34.600
 the selection and how did you take it how 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.430
 you lived and how this return takes you 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.409
 I also imagine important for you 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.960
 career and for you personally why 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:44.049
 difficult for me it was difficult to return to what 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:46.770
 that was the selection and get back to being 

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:49.109
 Outside Selection 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.480
 and happy obviously to get back from being 

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:53.280
 well to go back to 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:55.890
 and mainly because of the fact that 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:59.040
 one suffers a lot because of the family 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:01.650
 what happened to me so it's already happened 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.840
 is and tries to be nothing now 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:05.870
 with just was difficult documented 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.790
 previously the conversion that we had 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:12.720
 how do I pick up this selection again? 

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:14.520
 I imagine more mature taking all the 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.340
 licenses to not commit this kind of 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.530
 irregularities in future calls 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.630
 if obviously one reads to me in what 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:24.810
 personal experience serves me what 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:28.140
 it happened but calm nothing else as you 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:30.660
 I say it helped me a lot to think about being 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.310
 out the truth that I suffer a lot 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:35.190
 being watching matches by 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.840
 television and all that so nothing to be 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.630
 here and be contribution as I said before 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.550
 not only did you have the possibility to give 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:44.790
 with claudio borghi his coaching staff 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:46.740
 after all this happened , a 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.570
 mea culpa publicly such as that 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:49.800
 conference to security conference 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:52.500
 what there was in 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:54.570
 your moment is done would be an apology 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.770
 there is repentance 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:58.530
 I read with the technical staff obviously 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:02.010
 out there we clarify things 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:03.450
 saying that I personally do not 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:06.050
 what we had done is missing 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:09.060
 press conference and that nothing else that 's 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:09.990
 what is given them confidence again 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.260
 for the third time 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:14.870
 Claudio Borghi decides to give him free 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:18.510
 these days they will concentrate only 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:20.520
 in two days how does that take you? 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.890
 trust that deposits again 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:24.360
 claudio borghi despite they have been 11 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:27.800
 disenfranchised players of the elections 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.800
 of six qualifying dates 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:32.300
 mainly I think it's good 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:33.230
 we each know what what 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:36.650
 he does in his personal life 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:40.240
 outside obviously I think the skin does not 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:41.860
 ratify the trust 

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:43.600
 to what the players are I think it is 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:44.800
 which is that it is well beyond its 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.740
 Claudia has always been the same way 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:49.690
 I had it in colo colo too and for 

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:52.000
 there speaks very well of the fact that it is 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:55.000
 that does not change because of the way he is 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.800
 the very close to us and already apart 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
 for the subject of us personally 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.530
 now in this same sense 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.510
 personally there will be a care 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:03.140
 special in you not to commit this 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:05.540
 this kind of 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:07.610
 personally, I do not have to do what 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:09.500
 I do out of my personal life 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:11.330
 I have a problem beyond what I have 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:13.880
 past us how is it 

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:16.070
 this selection with a view to this this 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:18.920
 party in front of colombia how is the 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:20.150
 group like this group and I think it has 

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:22.820
 been well since the beginning of 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:25.310
 eliminator we are first 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:26.860
 and that's not a reason for relaxation either 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:29.409
 what 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:31.120
 now we are not waiting for others 

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:34.599
 comrades that arrive and already start 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:36.129
 train with everything and think what 

00:04:34.599 --> 00:04:38.349
 comes that Colombia is a very rival 

00:04:36.129 --> 00:04:40.060
 hard as palencia in the defense 

00:04:38.349 --> 00:04:42.430
 specifically because we have not been 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:44.349
 count on playing like jose red because 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:45.819
 they were disaffected from the selection by 

00:04:44.349 --> 00:04:47.800
 this topic with chile university how 

00:04:45.819 --> 00:04:50.110
 are you the personal you see yourself as the owner 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:52.110
 how is this in your club has not come 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:54.510
 playing in these last matches 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:56.040
 the truth that I think they asked me 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:58.020
 just also all the players that 

00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:00.690
 what defense do you ask me 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:02.490
 are that have been summoned in this in 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:05.160
 this time they are all to play and 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:08.040
 to have the option to play beyond 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:09.630
 of whoever decides the teacher out there 

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:12.360
 obviously we all have the same 

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:16.230
 advantage so I think it will continue 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:18.060
 watching this week on the good team 

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:20.040
 then are the words of gonzález 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:21.780
 for one who returns to the selection 

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:23.700
 Chilean to make contribution of course to 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:25.620
 this selection of claudio borghi that no 

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:27.690
 will have most of your 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:30.390
 defenses remember why this is 

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:31.530
 decision of the same color and is to affect 

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:33.480
 some college players from 

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:34.800
 Chile mainly to two defenses that 

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:37.020
 I had chance to play will be 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:38.910
 Gonzalo Jara will continue here 

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:40.500
 players up a few more minutes and already 

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:42.480
 have left some to have free 

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:44.850
 as we said before the concentration 

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:47.190
 of tomorrow in double shift they go to work 

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:48.660
 Tuesday and Thursday are going to 

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:49.770
 play against the U-20 a friendly 

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:50.940
 remember that they will not play for 

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:52.440
 FIFA World Cup qualifiers to 

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:55.009
 seventh mainly affects because they go 

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:56.869
 to be free and on Tuesday 

00:05:55.009 --> 00:05:58.909

00:05:56.869 --> 00:06:01.279
 monomeric stadium verónica well
