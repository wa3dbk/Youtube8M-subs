modern<00:02:57.300> Pratt<00:02:57.570> really<00:02:58.400> they<00:02:59.400> work<00:02:59.580> well<00:02:59.850> when

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
modern Pratt really they work well when

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.120 
modern Pratt really they work well when
they<00:03:00.240> work<00:03:00.420> but<00:03:00.750> then<00:03:00.930> when<00:03:01.590> they<00:03:01.709> don't<00:03:01.860> work
