00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
actually considered matte black but it's

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.279 
actually considered matte black but it's
a<00:00:58.559> it's<00:00:59.160> a<00:00:59.280> finish<00:00:59.640> that<00:00:59.899> isn't<00:01:00.899> quite<00:01:01.109> as

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
a it's a finish that isn't quite as

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.920 
a it's a finish that isn't quite as
shiny<00:01:01.559> as<00:01:02.149> other<00:01:03.149> stuff<00:01:03.390> kind<00:01:03.629> of<00:01:03.690> makes<00:01:03.809> it

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
shiny as other stuff kind of makes it

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.299 
shiny as other stuff kind of makes it
look<00:01:04.049> a<00:01:04.110> little<00:01:04.199> bit<00:01:04.409> sinister<00:01:04.739> if<00:01:05.040> you<00:01:05.129> will

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
look a little bit sinister if you will

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.080 
look a little bit sinister if you will
so<00:01:06.439> it<00:01:07.439> definitely<00:01:07.680> gives<00:01:08.010> a<00:01:08.310> different<00:01:08.820> look

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090

new<00:04:07.230> one<00:04:07.320> called<00:04:07.560> smoke<00:04:07.890> which<00:04:08.459> is<00:04:08.610> really

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
new one called smoke which is really

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.400 
new one called smoke which is really
neat<00:04:08.940> it's<00:04:09.090> intriguing<00:04:09.360> you<00:04:09.870> might<00:04:10.049> see<00:04:10.260> that

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
neat it's intriguing you might see that

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:13.310 
neat it's intriguing you might see that
on<00:04:10.560> my<00:04:10.650> vehicle<00:04:10.830> pretty<00:04:11.160> soon<00:04:11.370> and<00:04:12.269> there's<00:04:13.260> a

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:13.320 
on my vehicle pretty soon and there's a

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.050 
on my vehicle pretty soon and there's a
classifier<00:04:13.920> which<00:04:14.190> is<00:04:14.340> really<00:04:14.549> neat<00:04:14.700> so<00:04:14.910> that

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
classifier which is really neat so that

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:18.469 
classifier which is really neat so that
makes<00:04:15.209> it<00:04:15.890> shinier<00:04:16.890> so<00:04:17.160> it<00:04:17.640> still<00:04:18.180> has<00:04:18.330> that

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:18.479 
makes it shinier so it still has that

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:20.180 
makes it shinier so it still has that
finish<00:04:18.750> but<00:04:19.080> it'll<00:04:19.410> be<00:04:19.440> a<00:04:19.500> little<00:04:19.590> bit<00:04:19.739> shinier

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
finish but it'll be a little bit shinier

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:21.770 
finish but it'll be a little bit shinier

know of my own I found this stunt

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:09.040 
know of my own I found this stunt
yourself<00:05:07.100> for<00:05:07.310> exactly<00:05:07.850> exactly<00:05:08.210> now<00:05:08.870> this

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:09.050 
yourself for exactly exactly now this

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:12.670 
yourself for exactly exactly now this
stuff<00:05:09.320> is<00:05:09.530> a<00:05:09.620> twill<00:05:10.430> carbon<00:05:11.030> fiber<00:05:11.270> as<00:05:12.170> you<00:05:12.530> see

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:12.680 
stuff is a twill carbon fiber as you see

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:15.640 
stuff is a twill carbon fiber as you see
two<00:05:13.340> by<00:05:13.490> two<00:05:13.550> so<00:05:13.910> you<00:05:13.940> see<00:05:14.330> it<00:05:14.450> comes<00:05:14.660> in<00:05:14.900> a<00:05:15.110> full

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:15.650 
two by two so you see it comes in a full
