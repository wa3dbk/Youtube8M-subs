00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
consider a good bit of running on them

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.170 
consider a good bit of running on them
and<00:01:40.009> what<00:01:41.009> it<00:01:41.159> features<00:01:41.400> to<00:01:41.549> this<00:01:41.640> one<00:01:41.909> and<00:01:42.060> so

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
a kind of like it's pretty self doesn't

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.270 
a kind of like it's pretty self doesn't
yeah<00:02:09.580> I<00:02:09.610> love<00:02:09.759> it<00:02:09.790> kind<00:02:10.150> of<00:02:10.950> these<00:02:11.950> runs<00:02:12.160> from

yeah I love it kind of these runs from

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:13.740 
yeah I love it kind of these runs from
so<00:02:12.460> many<00:02:12.610> pairs<00:02:12.880> obviously<00:02:13.270> you'd<00:02:13.360> expect<00:02:13.660> to

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
so many pairs obviously you'd expect to

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.150 
so many pairs obviously you'd expect to
get<00:02:13.870> a<00:02:13.930> reason<00:02:14.290> good<00:02:14.470> soul<00:02:14.710> and<00:02:14.860> you<00:02:14.920> can<00:02:15.040> see

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
get a reason good soul and you can see

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.100 
get a reason good soul and you can see
that<00:02:15.310> it's<00:02:15.610> a<00:02:15.700> memory<00:02:16.030> type<00:02:16.240> source<00:02:16.570> or<00:02:16.900> this

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
that it's a memory type source or this

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.530 
that it's a memory type source or this
or<00:02:17.290> it<00:02:17.950> gives<00:02:18.310> it<00:02:18.460> a<00:02:18.550> that<00:02:18.730> extra<00:02:19.360> bit<00:02:19.480> of

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
or it gives it a that extra bit of

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.690 
or it gives it a that extra bit of
caution<00:02:20.050> and<00:02:20.140> on<00:02:20.290> your<00:02:20.440> feet<00:02:20.620> so<00:02:20.860> it<00:02:20.980> does<00:02:21.160> so

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
caution and on your feet so it does so

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.460 
caution and on your feet so it does so
which<00:02:21.910> is<00:02:22.060> pretty<00:02:22.300> good<00:02:22.540> so<00:02:22.720> you<00:02:22.840> have<00:02:22.990> the<00:02:23.230> the

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
which is pretty good so you have the the

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.050 
which is pretty good so you have the the
soul<00:02:23.890> which<00:02:24.040> give<00:02:24.220> me<00:02:24.340> a<00:02:24.370> bit<00:02:24.520> of<00:02:24.610> caution<00:02:24.820> and

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
soul which give me a bit of caution and

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:26.520 
soul which give me a bit of caution and
then<00:02:25.150> you've<00:02:25.240> got<00:02:25.390> a<00:02:25.420> deed<00:02:25.690> talking<00:02:26.170> theory

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
then you've got a deed talking theory

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.770 
then you've got a deed talking theory
here<00:02:26.770> which<00:02:26.920> is<00:02:27.040> this<00:02:27.160> new<00:02:27.400> design<00:02:27.820> and<00:02:28.060> if<00:02:28.690> you

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
here which is this new design and if you

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.540 
here which is this new design and if you
go<00:02:28.930> onto<00:02:29.050> YouTube<00:02:29.500> you<00:02:29.830> can<00:02:29.950> see<00:02:30.070> carry<00:02:30.370> more

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550 
go onto YouTube you can see carry more

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:32.880 
go onto YouTube you can see carry more
actually<00:02:30.880> has<00:02:31.060> a<00:02:31.090> video<00:02:31.450> of<00:02:31.510> that<00:02:31.890> decoding

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
actually has a video of that decoding

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.190 
actually has a video of that decoding
material<00:02:33.340> exactly<00:02:34.210> what<00:02:34.600> it<00:02:34.780> doesn't<00:02:34.960> want

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
material exactly what it doesn't want

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.500 
material exactly what it doesn't want
its<00:02:35.350> feature<00:02:35.500> so<00:02:36.070> we<00:02:36.100> have<00:02:36.400> here<00:02:36.760> we<00:02:37.330> have<00:02:37.360> here

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
its feature so we have here we have here

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.930 
its feature so we have here we have here
on<00:02:37.870> the<00:02:37.960> knees<00:02:38.170> we<00:02:38.560> also<00:02:38.740> got<00:02:39.130> there<00:02:39.370> the<00:02:39.670> gel

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
on the knees we also got there the gel

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:41.970 
on the knees we also got there the gel
is<00:02:39.970> all<00:02:40.300> incorporated<00:02:40.720> into<00:02:41.320> it<00:02:41.530> here<00:02:41.710> so<00:02:41.860> we

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
is all incorporated into it here so we

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.220 
is all incorporated into it here so we
have<00:02:42.130> a<00:02:42.160> word<00:02:42.460> and<00:02:42.700> we've<00:02:43.300> got<00:02:43.510> a<00:02:43.540> bit<00:02:43.840> of<00:02:43.960> gel

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
have a word and we've got a bit of gel

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.800 
have a word and we've got a bit of gel
here<00:02:44.500> rain<00:02:44.770> in<00:02:44.830> the<00:02:44.920> front<00:02:45.270> is<00:02:46.270> where<00:02:46.330> and

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
here rain in the front is where and

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.860 
here rain in the front is where and
we've<00:02:47.530> got<00:02:47.709> a<00:02:47.740> very<00:02:48.100> robust<00:02:48.910> then<00:02:49.270> what<00:02:49.720> would

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
we've got a very robust then what would

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.810 
we've got a very robust then what would
you<00:02:49.930> call<00:02:50.050> it<00:02:50.110> tight<00:02:50.440> plastic<00:02:51.220> rubber

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:51.820 
you call it tight plastic rubber

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:54.210 
you call it tight plastic rubber
material<00:02:51.940> here<00:02:52.630> we've<00:02:53.020> got<00:02:53.230> good<00:02:53.530> sources<00:02:54.010> are

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
material here we've got good sources are

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.160 
material here we've got good sources are
not<00:02:54.310> fever<00:02:54.640> and<00:02:54.850> sold<00:02:55.060> right<00:02:55.240> here<00:02:55.300> but<00:02:55.990> the

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:30.640 
what's happening here as you can see

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.210 
what's happening here as you can see
that<00:03:31.030> it<00:03:31.209> it<00:03:31.390> has<00:03:31.630> started<00:03:31.930> to<00:03:32.470> wear<00:03:32.650> if<00:03:32.860> it

on me so I'm actually delay the other

00:06:40.449 --> 00:06:41.939 
on me so I'm actually delay the other
one<00:06:40.569> with<00:06:40.719> the<00:06:40.810> nine<00:06:40.960> and<00:06:41.169> not<00:06:41.289> initially<00:06:41.800> not

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:43.360 
the year and a half even though the nine

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:46.369 
the year and a half even though the nine
doesn't<00:06:43.719> give<00:06:43.810> me<00:06:43.930> that<00:06:44.050> much<00:06:44.289> more<00:06:44.560> space<00:06:45.310> and

00:06:46.369 --> 00:06:46.379 
doesn't give me that much more space and

00:06:46.379 --> 00:06:49.170 
doesn't give me that much more space and
so<00:06:47.379> it<00:06:48.069> starts<00:06:48.370> going<00:06:48.490> away<00:06:48.639> from<00:06:48.879> the<00:06:48.969> point

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:49.180

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:51.719 
so it starts going away from the point
there<00:06:49.360> compared<00:06:49.780> to<00:06:49.990> an<00:06:50.289> asset<00:06:51.250> groans<00:06:51.580> not
