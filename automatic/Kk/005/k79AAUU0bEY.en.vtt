espresso<00:00:21.029> machines<00:00:21.390> have<00:00:21.570> a<00:00:21.600> pre<00:00:21.990> infusion

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
espresso machines have a pre infusion

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.070 
espresso machines have a pre infusion
process<00:00:22.710> and<00:00:23.220> that<00:00:23.789> occurs<00:00:24.119> as<00:00:24.449> a<00:00:24.480> result<00:00:24.869> of

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
process and that occurs as a result of

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.109 
process and that occurs as a result of
the<00:00:25.230> dual<00:00:25.500> wall<00:00:25.920> filtered<00:00:26.460> if<00:00:26.640> you<00:00:26.910> take<00:00:27.090> a

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
the dual wall filtered if you take a

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.790 
the dual wall filtered if you take a
closer<00:00:27.480> look<00:00:27.599> at<00:00:27.810> your<00:00:27.900> filter<00:00:28.289> you'll<00:00:28.529> see

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
closer look at your filter you'll see

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.950 
closer look at your filter you'll see
multiple<00:00:29.580> holes<00:00:29.849> on<00:00:30.119> the<00:00:30.269> inner<00:00:30.480> wall<00:00:30.660> and

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
multiple holes on the inner wall and

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.709 
multiple holes on the inner wall and
then<00:00:31.470> if<00:00:31.590> you<00:00:31.710> turn<00:00:31.949> it<00:00:32.099> over<00:00:32.279> or<00:00:32.820> hold<00:00:33.510> it<00:00:33.630> up

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
then if you turn it over or hold it up

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.330 
then if you turn it over or hold it up
to<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:33.960> light<00:00:34.110> you'll<00:00:34.320> see<00:00:34.380> one<00:00:34.770> exit<00:00:35.160> hole

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
to the light you'll see one exit hole

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.639 
to the light you'll see one exit hole
and<00:00:35.640> what<00:00:36.149> that<00:00:36.390> does<00:00:36.600> it<00:00:36.840> actually<00:00:36.989> increases

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
and what that does it actually increases

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.069 
and what that does it actually increases
pressure<00:00:38.129> inside<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:39.059> brew<00:00:39.270> head<00:00:39.450> and<00:00:39.690> that

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
pressure inside the brew head and that

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.990 
pressure inside the brew head and that
increased<00:00:40.680> back<00:00:40.980> pressure<00:00:41.280> is<00:00:41.579> going<00:00:41.730> to<00:00:41.790> get

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
increased back pressure is going to get

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.779 
increased back pressure is going to get
more<00:00:42.530> extraction<00:00:43.530> of<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:43.680> natural<00:00:44.250> oils<00:00:44.550> from

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
more extraction of the natural oils from

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.360 
more extraction of the natural oils from
the<00:00:44.879> espresso<00:00:45.570> you<00:00:46.020> can<00:00:46.170> get<00:00:46.350> more<00:00:46.649> crema<00:00:47.100> on

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
the espresso you can get more crema on

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:48.979 
the espresso you can get more crema on
your<00:00:47.520> espresso<00:00:47.940> and<00:00:48.120> that's<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.450> sign<00:00:48.719> of<00:00:48.750> a

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
your espresso and that's the sign of a

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.979 
your espresso and that's the sign of a
good<00:00:49.140> espresso<00:00:49.940> much<00:00:50.940> like<00:00:51.210> an<00:00:51.420> ice<00:00:51.660> cream

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989

after<00:00:54.210> its<00:00:54.510> use<00:00:54.750> it's<00:00:55.379> a<00:00:55.500> really<00:00:55.829> good<00:00:55.949> idea<00:00:56.070> to

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
after its use it's a really good idea to

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.160 
after its use it's a really good idea to
get<00:00:56.489> in<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.670> habit<00:00:56.850> of<00:00:57.059> cleaning<00:00:57.600> your<00:00:57.750> dual

you<00:01:01.350> run<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.680> risk<00:01:01.890> of<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.670> filter<00:01:03.000> becoming

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
you run the risk of the filter becoming

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.479 
you run the risk of the filter becoming

the<00:01:11.490> correct<00:01:11.820> espresso<00:01:12.450> grind<00:01:12.750> so<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.650> best

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
the correct espresso grind so the best

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.890 
the correct espresso grind so the best
way<00:01:13.979> to<00:01:14.010> do<00:01:14.369> that<00:01:14.520> is<00:01:14.700> to<00:01:14.850> actually<00:01:14.909> feel<00:01:15.450> it<00:01:15.479> if

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
way to do that is to actually feel it if

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.649 
way to do that is to actually feel it if
you<00:01:16.140> grind<00:01:16.409> it<00:01:16.530> to<00:01:16.770> fine<00:01:17.040> it<00:01:17.280> comes<00:01:17.520> much<00:01:18.360> like

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
you grind it to fine it comes much like

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.260 
you grind it to fine it comes much like
flour<00:01:19.049> or<00:01:19.500> powder<00:01:19.920> so<00:01:20.400> what<00:01:20.580> that's<00:01:20.850> gonna<00:01:21.000> do

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
flour or powder so what that's gonna do

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.990 
flour or powder so what that's gonna do
inside<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:21.990> filter<00:01:22.259> it'll<00:01:23.159> trap<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.790> water

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
inside the filter it'll trap the water

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.460 
inside the filter it'll trap the water
and<00:01:24.210> it<00:01:24.270> won't<00:01:24.450> be<00:01:24.540> able<00:01:24.750> to<00:01:24.840> pass<00:01:25.110> through<00:01:25.380> the

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
and it won't be able to pass through the

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.499 
and it won't be able to pass through the
brew<00:01:25.740> head<00:01:25.950> and<00:01:26.220> then<00:01:26.850> if<00:01:26.970> you<00:01:27.060> do<00:01:27.210> it<00:01:27.240> too

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
brew head and then if you do it too

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.100 
brew head and then if you do it too
coarse<00:01:27.840> like<00:01:28.799> this<00:01:29.100> then<00:01:30.090> what<00:01:30.630> is<00:01:30.780> just<00:01:30.990> gonna

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
coarse like this then what is just gonna

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.170 
coarse like this then what is just gonna
flush<00:01:31.680> straight<00:01:32.009> through<00:01:32.369> the<00:01:32.490> brew<00:01:32.670> head<00:01:32.880> and

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
flush straight through the brew head and

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.120 
flush straight through the brew head and
it's<00:01:33.630> gonna<00:01:33.720> be<00:01:33.960> under<00:01:34.170> extracted<00:01:34.860> and<00:01:35.009> have

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
it's gonna be under extracted and have

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.399 
it's gonna be under extracted and have
no<00:01:35.280> flavor<00:01:35.610> so<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.479> best<00:01:36.720> consistency<00:01:37.619> is

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:38.409 
no flavor so the best consistency is

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:42.029 
no flavor so the best consistency is
have<00:01:38.590> a<00:01:38.890> sand-like<00:01:40.229> granular<00:01:41.229> consistency

00:01:42.029 --> 00:01:42.039 
have a sand-like granular consistency

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:44.190 
have a sand-like granular consistency
which<00:01:42.520> will<00:01:42.759> stay<00:01:43.299> in<00:01:43.359> your<00:01:43.539> fingers<00:01:43.869> but<00:01:44.079> it's

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
which will stay in your fingers but it's

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.779 
which will stay in your fingers but it's
still<00:01:44.439> going<00:01:44.590> to<00:01:44.619> have<00:01:44.829> that<00:01:44.979> granulated

00:01:45.779 --> 00:01:45.789 
still going to have that granulated

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:47.969 
still going to have that granulated
result<00:01:46.210> and<00:01:46.479> that's<00:01:46.960> gonna<00:01:47.140> pass<00:01:47.469> through<00:01:47.799> the

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:47.979 
result and that's gonna pass through the

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:50.130 
result and that's gonna pass through the
brew<00:01:48.189> head<00:01:48.369> at<00:01:48.549> the<00:01:48.700> correct<00:01:49.179> rate<00:01:49.450> and<00:01:49.990> you're

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 
brew head at the correct rate and you're

straight<00:02:10.910> after<00:02:11.240> extraction<00:02:11.660> you<00:02:11.930> may<00:02:12.170> notice

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
straight after extraction you may notice

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.010 
straight after extraction you may notice
that<00:02:12.890> your<00:02:13.160> puck<00:02:13.460> is<00:02:13.640> wet<00:02:13.970> and<00:02:14.000> stop<00:02:14.480> it<00:02:14.660> but

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
that your puck is wet and stop it but

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.230 
that your puck is wet and stop it but
this<00:02:15.140> is<00:02:15.290> completely<00:02:16.100> normal<00:02:16.310> and<00:02:16.670> as<00:02:17.210> a

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:17.240 
this is completely normal and as a

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.450 
this is completely normal and as a
result<00:02:17.720> of<00:02:17.960> the<00:02:18.140> dual<00:02:18.470> wall<00:02:18.650> filter<00:02:19.130> because

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:19.460 
result of the dual wall filter because

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:20.890 
result of the dual wall filter because
there<00:02:19.610> hasn't<00:02:19.760> been<00:02:19.910> enough<00:02:20.240> time<00:02:20.480> for<00:02:20.780> the

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
there hasn't been enough time for the

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.080 
there hasn't been enough time for the
water<00:02:21.110> to<00:02:21.530> drip<00:02:21.740> through<00:02:21.980> the<00:02:22.100> filter<00:02:22.430> so<00:02:22.940> it's

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
water to drip through the filter so it's

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:24.550 
water to drip through the filter so it's
a<00:02:23.150> really<00:02:23.360> good<00:02:23.630> habit<00:02:23.810> to<00:02:23.960> get<00:02:24.170> into<00:02:24.230> to

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
a really good habit to get into to

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.040 
a really good habit to get into to
actually<00:02:25.160> clean<00:02:25.520> your<00:02:25.550> filter<00:02:26.360> and<00:02:26.570> your

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050 
actually clean your filter and your

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:28.570 
actually clean your filter and your
showerhead<00:02:27.380> after<00:02:27.920> each<00:02:28.070> use

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
showerhead after each use

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:33.550 
showerhead after each use
so<00:02:29.000> simply<00:02:31.210> clean<00:02:32.210> it<00:02:32.450> out<00:02:32.690> and<00:02:32.930> then<00:02:33.350> just

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
so simply clean it out and then just

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.820 
so simply clean it out and then just

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
wipe it down with a damp cloth and then

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:38.620 
wipe it down with a damp cloth and then
just<00:02:37.160> put<00:02:37.370> it<00:02:37.460> on<00:02:37.580> like<00:02:37.790> you'd<00:02:38.000> normally<00:02:38.150> do<00:02:38.510> if

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
just put it on like you'd normally do if

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:43.240
