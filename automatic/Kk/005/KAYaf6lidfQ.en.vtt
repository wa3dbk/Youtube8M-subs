00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:03.750 
what's going on guys got a couple of

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.490 
what's going on guys got a couple of
envelopes<00:00:03.899> here<00:00:04.560> they<00:00:05.160> were<00:00:05.220> fed<00:00:05.759> ex<00:00:05.970> delivery

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:06.500 
envelopes here they were fed ex delivery

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:09.440 
envelopes here they were fed ex delivery
so<00:00:07.500> I'm<00:00:07.620> hoping<00:00:07.919> these<00:00:08.099> will<00:00:08.340> be<00:00:08.490> the<00:00:08.790> Michael

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
so I'm hoping these will be the Michael

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.540 
so I'm hoping these will be the Michael
Jordan's<00:00:09.809> that<00:00:09.990> we've<00:00:10.110> been<00:00:10.260> waiting<00:00:10.559> for<00:00:10.769> so

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
Jordan's that we've been waiting for so

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.890 
Jordan's that we've been waiting for so
I<00:00:11.990> wanted<00:00:12.990> to<00:00:13.110> open<00:00:13.230> them<00:00:13.469> on<00:00:13.590> here<00:00:13.860> so<00:00:14.190> that<00:00:14.900> if

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
I wanted to open them on here so that if

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.359 
I wanted to open them on here so that if
I<00:00:16.020> get<00:00:16.170> some<00:00:16.320> kind<00:00:16.500> of<00:00:16.529> nasty<00:00:16.740> fat<00:00:17.160> I<00:00:17.340> have

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
I get some kind of nasty fat I have

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.029 
I get some kind of nasty fat I have
proof<00:00:17.820> it<00:00:18.090> will<00:00:18.510> do<00:00:18.720> it<00:00:18.869> because<00:00:19.080> apparently

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
proof it will do it because apparently

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.439 
proof it will do it because apparently
bgs<00:00:20.580> is<00:00:20.789> not<00:00:21.769> grading<00:00:22.769> nice<00:00:23.490> patches<00:00:24.029> anymore

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
bgs is not grading nice patches anymore

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.810 
bgs is not grading nice patches anymore
so<00:00:24.810> this<00:00:25.680> way<00:00:25.830> i<00:00:25.859> would<00:00:26.039> have<00:00:26.130> proof<00:00:26.490> that<00:00:26.519> it

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
so this way i would have proof that it

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.609 
so this way i would have proof that it
was<00:00:26.910> real<00:00:27.119> let's<00:00:27.750> hope<00:00:27.840> we<00:00:27.960> get<00:00:28.080> serial<00:00:28.439> number

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
was real let's hope we get serial number

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.179 
was real let's hope we get serial number
23<00:00:29.599> alright<00:00:30.599> this<00:00:30.720> is<00:00:30.779> going<00:00:31.019> to<00:00:31.080> be<00:00:31.230> the<00:00:31.410> auto

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
23 alright this is going to be the auto

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
patch so I'm going to cover that up for

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.560 
patch so I'm going to cover that up for
now<00:00:34.649> I'm<00:00:35.640> going<00:00:35.730> to<00:00:35.880> keep<00:00:36.000> it<00:00:36.149> sitting<00:00:36.450> right

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
now I'm going to keep it sitting right

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.380 
now I'm going to keep it sitting right
in<00:00:36.660> front<00:00:36.780> of<00:00:36.899> those<00:00:37.820> cameras<00:00:38.820> so<00:00:39.000> that<00:00:39.030> they

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
in front of those cameras so that they

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.270 
in front of those cameras so that they
can't<00:00:39.600> think<00:00:39.780> that<00:00:39.989> somehow<00:00:40.290> i<00:00:40.440> magically<00:00:40.950> put

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
can't think that somehow i magically put

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.720 
can't think that somehow i magically put
a<00:00:41.309> fix<00:00:41.579> patch<00:00:41.820> in<00:00:42.059> there<00:00:42.239> i<00:00:42.950> do<00:00:43.950> all<00:00:44.160> this<00:00:44.309> among

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
a fix patch in there i do all this among

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.130 
a fix patch in there i do all this among
and<00:00:44.879> then<00:00:44.969> it<00:00:45.120> gets<00:00:45.239> to<00:00:45.480> one<00:00:45.690> color<00:00:45.899> patches

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
and then it gets to one color patches

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.250 
and then it gets to one color patches
that's<00:00:47.539> still<00:00:48.539> going<00:00:48.600> to<00:00:48.719> be<00:00:48.780> a<00:00:48.809> nice<00:00:48.960> part

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
that's still going to be a nice part

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.590 
that's still going to be a nice part
either<00:00:49.379> way<00:00:49.590> so<00:00:50.600> right<00:00:51.600> here<00:00:52.520> we<00:00:53.520> have<00:00:53.760> the

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
either way so right here we have the

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.290

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
we got multiple colors did not get

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.789 
we got multiple colors did not get
number<00:01:27.020> 23<00:01:28.880> will<00:01:29.880> get<00:01:30.000> number<00:01:30.240> 25<00:01:31.140> 15<00:01:31.619> out<00:01:31.770> of

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
number 23 will get number 25 15 out of

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:37.130 
number 23 will get number 25 15 out of
25<00:01:32.600> so<00:01:33.600> if<00:01:34.110> you'll<00:01:34.259> see<00:01:34.500> their<00:01:35.570> duel<00:01:36.570> to<00:01:36.840> color

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
25 so if you'll see their duel to color

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.100 
25 so if you'll see their duel to color
looks<00:01:37.470> like<00:01:37.619> name<00:01:38.009> plates<00:01:38.720> which<00:01:39.720> are<00:01:39.840> nice

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
three color breaks and then there's four

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.340 
three color breaks and then there's four

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
color brakes on that one so very very

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.760
