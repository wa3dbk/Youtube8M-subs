00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
step up to the front so when we're very

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
surf like this for a moment okay it's

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.480 
surf like this for a moment okay it's
going<00:01:54.659> to<00:01:54.720> feel<00:01:54.930> awkward<00:01:54.960> at<00:01:55.439> first<00:01:55.470> but<00:01:55.890> over

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
going to feel awkward at first but over

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:57.710

time you're going to get comfortable we

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.359 
time you're going to get comfortable we
can<00:01:57.840> actually<00:01:57.990> learn<00:01:58.259> to<00:01:58.439> surf<00:01:58.740> like<00:01:58.950> this<00:01:59.130> and

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
can actually learn to surf like this and

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.460 
can actually learn to surf like this and
trim<00:01:59.670> down<00:01:59.700> the<00:02:00.000> wave<00:02:00.149> and<00:02:00.450> find<00:02:01.079> the<00:02:01.170> proper

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:01.470 
trim down the wave and find the proper

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:03.830 
trim down the wave and find the proper
section<00:02:02.100> of<00:02:02.220> the<00:02:02.340> wave<00:02:02.520> to<00:02:02.729> continue<00:02:03.149> on<00:02:03.329> up<00:02:03.570> to

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
section of the wave to continue on up to

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.330 
section of the wave to continue on up to
the<00:02:03.960> nose<00:02:04.140> of<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.350> board<00:02:04.500> insert<00:02:04.950> and

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
the nose of the board insert and

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.130 
the nose of the board insert and
continue<00:02:05.790> our<00:02:05.820> nose<00:02:06.119> ride<00:02:06.390> so<00:02:06.899> we<00:02:07.020> can

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
continue our nose ride so we can

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.069 
continue our nose ride so we can
continue<00:02:07.469> walking<00:02:07.799> up<00:02:08.479> all<00:02:09.479> the<00:02:09.720> way<00:02:09.810> to<00:02:09.869> the

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:10.079 
continue walking up all the way to the

00:02:10.079 --> 00:02:11.559 
continue walking up all the way to the
nose

another<00:02:12.379> thing<00:02:12.620> to<00:02:12.709> keep<00:02:12.860> in<00:02:12.980> mind<00:02:13.219> is<00:02:13.430> we

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:13.579 
another thing to keep in mind is we

00:02:13.579 --> 00:02:15.190 
another thing to keep in mind is we
don't<00:02:13.730> want<00:02:13.849> a<00:02:14.030> shuffle<00:02:14.480> step<00:02:14.689> now<00:02:14.900> shuffle

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
don't want a shuffle step now shuffle

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.069 
don't want a shuffle step now shuffle
stepping<00:02:15.799> it<00:02:16.370> is<00:02:16.609> effective<00:02:17.269> but<00:02:17.659> it's<00:02:17.810> bad

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:18.079 
stepping it is effective but it's bad

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:20.500 
stepping it is effective but it's bad
style<00:02:18.469> it's<00:02:18.709> bad<00:02:18.890> form<00:02:19.219> and<00:02:19.459> it<00:02:19.909> kind<00:02:20.150> of<00:02:20.239> slows

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
style it's bad form and it kind of slows

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.630 
style it's bad form and it kind of slows
us<00:02:20.719> down<00:02:20.920> when<00:02:21.920> people<00:02:22.069> I<00:02:22.250> mean<00:02:22.519> myself

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
us down when people I mean myself

us down when people I mean myself
stepping<00:02:23.090> people<00:02:23.450> shuffle<00:02:23.810> step<00:02:23.959> through<00:02:24.079> the

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
stepping people shuffle step through the

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:25.990 
stepping people shuffle step through the
nose<00:02:24.349> and<00:02:24.530> they<00:02:24.620> reach<00:02:24.859> way<00:02:25.099> out<00:02:25.280> and<00:02:25.489> it's

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
nose and they reach way out and it's

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.420 
nose and they reach way out and it's
just<00:02:26.120> bad<00:02:26.390> form<00:02:26.750> and<00:02:27.019> we<00:02:27.620> start<00:02:27.950> doing<00:02:28.129> bad

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
just bad form and we start doing bad

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.250 
just bad form and we start doing bad
habits<00:02:28.849> early<00:02:28.939> on<00:02:29.180> it's<00:02:29.480> really<00:02:29.689> hard<00:02:30.019> to<00:02:30.079> fix

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
habits early on it's really hard to fix

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.160 
habits early on it's really hard to fix
down<00:02:30.439> the<00:02:30.560> line<00:02:30.739> so<00:02:31.780> remember<00:02:32.780> if<00:02:32.870> we<00:02:32.930> want<00:02:33.109> to

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
down the line so remember if we want to

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.520 
down the line so remember if we want to
start<00:02:33.319> learning<00:02:33.439> on<00:02:33.650> a<00:02:33.680> cross<00:02:33.920> step<00:02:34.689> up<00:02:35.689> we<00:02:36.290> set

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
start learning on a cross step up we set

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.679 
start learning on a cross step up we set
our<00:02:36.650> line<00:02:36.859> you<00:02:37.459> can<00:02:37.579> practice<00:02:37.970> this<00:02:38.060> at<00:02:38.239> home<00:02:38.420> I

00:02:38.679 --> 00:02:38.689 
our line you can practice this at home I

00:02:38.689 --> 00:02:40.479 
our line you can practice this at home I
suppose<00:02:39.170> just<00:02:39.349> take<00:02:39.500> that<00:02:39.650> first<00:02:39.889> step<00:02:40.220> here

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:40.489 
suppose just take that first step here

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:43.030 
suppose just take that first step here
so<00:02:41.060> next<00:02:41.239> time<00:02:41.450> you're<00:02:41.599> out<00:02:41.659> surfing<00:02:42.170> practice

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
so next time you're out surfing practice

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.069 
so next time you're out surfing practice
holding<00:02:43.370> that<00:02:43.579> first<00:02:43.849> step<00:02:44.150> and<00:02:44.329> then

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:45.079 
holding that first step and then

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:46.750 
holding that first step and then
stepping<00:02:45.560> back<00:02:45.739> and<00:02:46.159> then<00:02:46.370> let<00:02:46.489> the<00:02:46.609> wave

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
stepping back and then let the wave

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.420 
stepping back and then let the wave
reform<00:02:47.269> in<00:02:47.420> front<00:02:47.689> of<00:02:47.810> you<00:02:47.900> and<00:02:48.769> step<00:02:49.129> forward

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
reform in front of you and step forward

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.970 
reform in front of you and step forward
again<00:02:49.959> one<00:02:50.959> of<00:02:50.989> my<00:02:51.079> favorite<00:02:51.470> things<00:02:51.620> to<00:02:51.680> do<00:02:51.829> is

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
again one of my favorite things to do is

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.039 
again one of my favorite things to do is
the<00:02:52.129> parking<00:02:52.639> blocks<00:02:52.909> you<00:02:53.120> have<00:02:53.329> and<00:02:53.540> probably

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:54.049 
the parking blocks you have and probably

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:55.449 
the parking blocks you have and probably
the<00:02:54.260> parking<00:02:54.620> lot<00:02:54.769> of<00:02:54.859> your<00:02:54.980> favorite<00:02:55.280> surf

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:55.459 
the parking lot of your favorite surf

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:57.250 
the parking lot of your favorite surf
spot<00:02:55.790> those<00:02:56.000> big<00:02:56.209> yellow<00:02:56.450> blocks<00:02:56.870> that<00:02:57.049> mark

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
spot those big yellow blocks that mark

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.140 
spot those big yellow blocks that mark
the<00:02:57.349> beginning<00:02:57.500> of<00:02:57.680> the<00:02:57.859> parking<00:02:58.189> spot<00:02:58.430> I<00:02:58.669> will

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
the beginning of the parking spot I will

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.270 
the beginning of the parking spot I will
actually<00:02:59.480> stand<00:02:59.840> on<00:03:00.019> it's<00:03:00.290> a<00:03:00.319> real<00:03:00.560> narrow<00:03:00.919> and

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
actually stand on it's a real narrow and

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.559 
actually stand on it's a real narrow and
I'll<00:03:02.090> walk<00:03:02.359> back<00:03:03.109> and<00:03:03.319> forth<00:03:03.409> on<00:03:03.769> them<00:03:03.889> and

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:04.569 
I'll walk back and forth on them and

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:07.929 
I'll walk back and forth on them and
just<00:03:05.569> practice<00:03:05.989> my<00:03:06.169> balance<00:03:06.639> these<00:03:07.639> little

00:03:07.929 --> 00:03:07.939 
just practice my balance these little

00:03:07.939 --> 00:03:09.520 
just practice my balance these little
