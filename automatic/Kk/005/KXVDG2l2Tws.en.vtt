we<00:02:12.590> come<00:02:13.010> up<00:02:13.100> with<00:02:13.160> an<00:02:13.280> idea<00:02:13.400> to<00:02:13.580> paint<00:02:13.820> like<00:02:13.940> a

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
we come up with an idea to paint like a

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.490 
we come up with an idea to paint like a
frame<00:02:14.300> around<00:02:14.450> it<00:02:14.720> and<00:02:14.840> because<00:02:15.320> originally

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
frame around it and because originally

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:16.390 
frame around it and because originally
it<00:02:15.740> said<00:02:15.860> buoy

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
it said buoy

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.780 
it said buoy
it's<00:02:16.610> a<00:02:16.850> buoy<00:02:17.480> up<00:02:17.660> here<00:02:17.900> and<00:02:18.080> that<00:02:18.260> it's<00:02:18.380> a<00:02:18.790> 79

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
it's a buoy up here and that it's a 79

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.180 
it's a buoy up here and that it's a 79
down<00:02:20.000> here<00:02:20.300> and<00:02:20.540> over<00:02:20.750> the<00:02:20.840> years<00:02:21.050> 79<00:02:21.950> turned

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
down here and over the years 79 turned

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.070 
down here and over the years 79 turned
into<00:02:22.310> 80<00:02:22.790> and<00:02:22.910> people<00:02:23.150> scratching<00:02:23.420> it<00:02:23.630> off<00:02:23.780> and

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
into 80 and people scratching it off and

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.400 
into 80 and people scratching it off and
so<00:02:24.440> it's<00:02:24.560> changed<00:02:24.980> throughout<00:02:25.610> the<00:02:25.670> years<00:02:25.790> but

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410
