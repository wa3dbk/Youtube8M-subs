 The years he directed today makes him introduce again a headset 

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:07.939
 and if they get into the net 

00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:11.989
 Thus, the ESC has its entire period striking on Tierra del Fuego 

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:17.560
 we did not know for sure what's on tuesday 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.269
 and since when is actually more full 

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:23.069
 with Scania and you can take pictures 

00:00:23.069 --> 00:00:26.489
 Companies with such effects we can do everything here now 

00:00:26.489 --> 00:00:26.970
 path 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.710
 in just a little bit of retro or other effects that can easily turn around 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:31.720
 to lead him 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.420
 Also upload companies directly to the Internet on their mobile phones 

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:40.069
 You can often follow people on window frames or even 

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:44.249
 you follow other people by ten years has the pictures of those 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.330
 Yassir four times to the actual service in Stockholm 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:51.330
 Under the year now most of these markets 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:56.330
 Year of Greg Meyer with ten individual functions to which has its partner 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:00.300
 Rail Kettling we already here she is the first category is the FID 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.220
 So all the photos that have been uploaded by yourself 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.899
 you can harm Shaun and his 

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:10.969
 There are comments and around years very simple information here 

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:12.460
 For this 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.290
 Nature on the move the category Popular 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.509
 yes and upper class just the 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:22.119
 to see the latest uploaded photos, too, was the most pleasurable comment 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:24.270
 and as far as they have 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.790
 You can of course also say no to it then again and again 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:29.710
 new ones displayed 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:34.290
 Century copier text has the deal the most used at the time 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.500
 Tracks and if their authenticity is just to take a look I wanted to 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:39.430
 almost on it 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:42.600
 and if they apply here then the photos 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.690
 contain these copywriters 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:48.710
 14 - so what if any one percent you follow her around 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.470
 postum principle mass is yes 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.070
 we do or still have some information on all profiled 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.170
 that all photos Johanna so far different view here 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.130
 in this regard, for example, delete also delete if the couple 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:02.470
 not on it anymore 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:07.580
 Bayreuth and me here next to her have not been so active so far 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:08.910
 to force them on them 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.519
 especially me too 

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:14.620
 in that program irritates and of course because then here are also full 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.299
 appropriate 

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:20.209
 yes because you just here again on this partner's side I can 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:24.819
 show you what you can do then in the once insight 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:28.319
 Yahoo with son Noah picture in single please just watch 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:33.110
 Once loaded Tamara Skela border and it has drizzle biggest view 

00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:36.489
 So I think that's very nice, for example, is just here 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:40.019
 with these in the federal and bit the leather from seven also here ministers 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:43.840
 Profile but I think the program is a very nice design 

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:48.539
 the scene here of course now for a picture then it has here 

00:02:48.539 --> 00:02:50.399
 Description formats or 

00:02:50.399 --> 00:02:52.769
 this has an NDR 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:55.800
 so we would like to follow the Riesenbakken children 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.750
 So if that does not happen in the moment, do not stop here 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:03.910
 she would have to order at which this user does not want to do so now 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:07.020
 of course, the Terrex the Comments of the kitchen and after but be one 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.819
 write 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:12.219
 and we can see where everything has added to the favorites 

00:03:12.219 --> 00:03:15.919
 under the year here and now also a few functional and that is as I said 

00:03:15.919 --> 00:03:19.059
 only if the user leaves it that way 

00:03:19.059 --> 00:03:23.519
 to find out the neck of service contracts to send the whole by e-mail 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:27.329
 In the evening download or open in a view and of course 

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:30.709
 Now here's the next picture from the balcony 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:34.029
 At that time, it only works if it works 

00:03:34.029 --> 00:03:37.689
 and why the Masters has discontinued that there is not this function 

00:03:37.689 --> 00:03:40.569
 a reception just not last 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:43.349
 yes, also a nice feature called sheer 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:46.289
 if this is easier then he can give up 

00:03:46.289 --> 00:03:51.359
 then efficiency without full screen Slideshow Euro next to it the whole photos of my 

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:57.029
 No, there are still some wm medals here 

00:03:57.029 --> 00:03:59.190
 transition with use and be older 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:02.269
 as you can directly order it in full screen 

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:05.679
 to join two sisters 

00:04:05.679 --> 00:04:09.529
 yes other natural also the function Â«Find user can easily 

00:04:09.529 --> 00:04:14.389
 because here once user name registered mail and then at the next episode or his 

00:04:14.389 --> 00:04:17.029
 Pictures are to be seen 

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:20.889
 he sat there and was already of interest on the whole 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:24.670
 all the windows of his program are not here right now 

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:27.560
 it depends on whether the round how much he 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:29.460
 min first corner the time 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:30.979
 um for people who just 

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:34.389
 Of course, if you're using it often, it's very convenient because you have it 

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:36.720
 then on a Mac, too 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.650
 and the respective passion is not like that yet 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:42.820
 a well built stearns this explains here 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:44.610
 much more practical 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:48.500
 The link to Eckert is supposed to be in the description and Finance Committee 10 and 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:49.850
 Chester it for the next time
