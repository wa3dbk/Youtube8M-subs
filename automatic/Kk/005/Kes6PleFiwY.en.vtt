00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 hello everyone in this little video we're going 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.600
 to talk about a cube that came to me 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.870
 recently and that I really like is the 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:13.769
 type 1.0 let's get it out of the box 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:16.379
 first of all and we see it in detail 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.869
 I bought it at hk nahuel store for 40 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.449
 dollars is a pretty expensive bucket there is 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:24.150
 recognize it is of quality but it is very 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.430
 expensive fixes that comes with a support what 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.170
 which is very good since it is a cube 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.349
 spherical good is a sphere here what 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.630
 let's see how nice it is not a 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.399
 Perfect sphere that does not deform 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.500
 there is also a version this is the 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:41.309
 version 1.0 there is another version that is the 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:44.059
 2.0 with another color pattern well here 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:48.600
 we have it this cube this cube that is 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:51.660
 because this cube or sphere is a rex cube 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:55.680
 after all, fix 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:59.100
 I have here a rex cube here we have it and 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:02.640
 You see these petals here as they are 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:05.280
 same as those of the cube rex petals by 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.140
 here petals here with its center and 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.290
 its four petals and these pieces of 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.770
 here the edges are these here the 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.719
 white 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:16.359
 they just do not have colors they do not have 

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:18.280
 stickers are white here this is 

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:21.070
 blue yellow because here there is not this 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:23.289
 division and it's all white and it's also been 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:26.679
 transformed into a sphere not then 

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:29.289
 it's a rex cube put in the shape of a sphere 

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:31.539
 no edges with blank edges 

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:33.789
 ok let's see a bit how this tour 

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:35.560
 cube let's remove the support that is 

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:38.020
 very well the truth because if not the 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.299
 spheres you already know that they fall you do not know 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:43.990
 they remain in a fixed position to rotate 

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:48.720
 so we have to do so 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:48.720
 and it has a click mechanism fijaros 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:55.540
 You have heard the click is separated 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:58.420
 now it turns completely loose and in 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:01.680
 As hooked to click again if 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:05.100
 there is not the click done for example 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.120
 if I have this like that and it's still not 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.550
 the click 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:11.880
 I can not run another turn you have to 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:14.730
 what to click teachers is good 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:17.430
 it rotates quite well, you just have to 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.680
 Be careful with aligning it well before 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.170
 to make the next turn we go to 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:25.709
 mess up a little and so you see how it is 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:27.959
 fijaros fact that how good tour 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:29.970
 pretty well the truth and once you 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:31.830
 is undone is very good time 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.920
 I am very happy very happy with this 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.959
 with this cube 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.360
 as you have observed there are no stickers 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:40.280
 the plastic is dyed directly so 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.930
 not to worry because 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.330
 lift and it's fine since this area of 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.280
 here it is curved and it is also very 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:48.230
 close and I think it would be very 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.940
 likely that this would get up 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.410
 the truth is this cube is quite big 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:54.530
 look here I have a 3 x 3 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:57.530
 unda yen sanchis and notice is much more 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:59.239
 big then in the hands as it has 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.220
 has consistency has has body and 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:03.680
 I like that a lot and this cube is very 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.300
 difficult good if you know how to solve the cube 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.739
 Reich, of course, it's not difficult anymore 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.840
 which is the same and also you do not have 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:10.250
 to worry about the edges if you do not know 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.260
 solve the good because it can cost you 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:13.970
 a little but as soon as you find a 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.709
 algorithm that allows you three petals 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:16.940
 for example you already know how to solve it 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:18.590
 I've done used the same algorithm all 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:21.350
 the time simply that applied it many 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:22.880
 Sometimes it allows me three petals to be 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:25.660
 ok here it is here it is here and what 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:29.350
 applied it applied until it is resolved 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:31.450
 then what disadvantages life this 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:33.130
 cube what effects I see good at first 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:36.100
 place the price is pretty clear 40 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:37.570
 dollars is a lot of money for a bucket in 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:39.970
 second place but well this is already a 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:42.730
 personal thing you see that in the part 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:46.600
 white put me kind of written here 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:48.820
 around here and with relief do not notice you have 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:50.440
 it has a lot of relief then to me that 

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:53.500
 it bothers me a little I do not like it much 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:55.780
 how is it I would put it as much in 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.760
 a white part the name of the cube I 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:59.410
 kind because in all I do not like much 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.550
 how it stays the same here is not appreciated 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:02.530
 pretty but when you have it at 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:03.730
 hands will constantly view 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:05.560
 these letters and it seems to me that 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:07.330
 aesthetically a little bit remains a 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:09.400
 bit wrong and what do I like 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:11.290
 this cube because to like its size is a 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.630
 big cube with consistency I like 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:15.340
 you have to have this size the 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:17.620
 I really like it a lot also 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:19.510
 a sphere I have so many cubes that from time to time 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:22.060
 in when a geometry a little bit 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:23.830
 different is appreciated and I also like 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.270
 how it works out I really like how it works 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.650
 solves the cube racks then this one 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:28.360
 well, I also like it as not 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:30.190
 has the edges because it is a little 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:32.980
 more simple and faster 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:35.320
 is a cube that I recommend man have 

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:37.660
 in mind that it costs 40 dollars I think 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:39.730
 that only makes sense to buy it 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:41.200
 if you really like a lot I had already 

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:42.790
 enough desire to buy me from 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:44.770
 long ago and said come let's go buy 

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:46.450
 but what if I do not think that for 40 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:49.330
 dollars you can buy before many 

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:51.130
 other cubes in fact this the cube rex to 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:52.750
 this one cost me 20 dollars and 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:54.730
 surely there are other places where 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:56.140
 it's a lot cheaper than 20 

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:58.270
 dollars then if you want to solve a 

00:04:56.140 --> 00:05:00.820
 cube of style rex type you buy 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:02.050
 this for $ 20 or less or if not 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:04.480
 for 40 dollars you can buy 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:06.400
 a lot of other cubes we go cubes for 

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:08.710
 six dollars for seven dollars for eight 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.720
 dollars but good if you really like 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:12.910
 So much ahead, no, and you can 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:15.070
 allow then why not good here 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:16.990
 the biotype remains and we are going to leave it in its 

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:18.550
 support so you can see how it is 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:20.590
 we leave with his partner the cube rex 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:22.120
 this video has been a bit brief but 

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:23.770
 well I wanted to talk a little 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:26.290
 about this on this sphere because I 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:27.700
 I really like the truth because I do not expect anything 

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:30.660
 that this video you liked and we 

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:30.660
 we see in another see you later
