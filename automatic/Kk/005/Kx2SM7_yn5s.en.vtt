to treat her like a princess
actually<00:01:38.340> that's<00:01:38.430> not<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:38.790> case<00:01:38.939> at<00:01:39.150> all<00:01:39.180> they

which is amazing I love that there is

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.139 
which is amazing I love that there is
one<00:01:44.100> instance<00:01:44.460> later<00:01:44.670> on<00:01:44.880> in<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.060> episode

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
one instance later on in the episode

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.090 
one instance later on in the episode
because<00:01:45.720> of<00:01:45.899> you<00:01:46.020> know<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.439> situation<00:01:46.979> that's

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
because of you know the situation that's

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.069 
because of you know the situation that's
going<00:01:47.340> on<00:01:47.549> the<00:01:48.090> girls<00:01:48.329> start<00:01:48.720> worrying<00:01:49.049> about

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
going on the girls start worrying about

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.899 
going on the girls start worrying about
Twilight<00:01:49.470> not<00:01:49.799> just<00:01:49.979> because<00:01:50.310> she's<00:01:50.549> a<00:01:50.579> friend

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
Twilight not just because she's a friend

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.580 
Twilight not just because she's a friend
of<00:01:51.119> theirs<00:01:51.329> but<00:01:51.840> because<00:01:52.140> she's<00:01:52.320> a<00:01:52.350> princess

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
of theirs but because she's a princess

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.100 
of theirs but because she's a princess
of<00:01:52.939> Equestria<00:01:53.939> now<00:01:54.090> so<00:01:54.420> I<00:01:54.450> mean<00:01:54.810> there<00:01:54.990> is<00:01:55.079> that

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
of Equestria now so I mean there is that

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.319 
of Equestria now so I mean there is that
fear<00:01:55.560> that<00:01:55.590> they<00:01:55.920> had<00:01:56.100> kind<00:01:56.790> of<00:01:56.909> contradicts

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
fear that they had kind of contradicts

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.450 
fear that they had kind of contradicts
what<00:01:57.420> I<00:01:57.479> said<00:01:57.659> before<00:01:57.719> but<00:01:57.930> it's<00:01:58.890> reasonable

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
what I said before but it's reasonable

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.069 
what I said before but it's reasonable
within<00:01:59.700> the<00:01:59.850> standards<00:02:00.450> of<00:02:00.540> what's<00:02:00.689> going<00:02:00.840> on

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
within the standards of what's going on

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.649 
within the standards of what's going on
now<00:02:01.619> aside<00:02:02.159> from<00:02:02.189> that<00:02:02.430> another<00:02:03.299> thing<00:02:03.570> I

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
now aside from that another thing I

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:04.850

episode<00:03:03.169> was<00:03:03.739> that<00:03:03.889> we<00:03:04.010> didn't<00:03:04.189> have<00:03:04.459> a<00:03:04.730> big

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
episode was that we didn't have a big

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.539 
episode was that we didn't have a big
bad<00:03:05.389> villain<00:03:05.719> for<00:03:06.530> once<00:03:06.739> the<00:03:07.129> villain<00:03:07.459> is

00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:07.549 
bad villain for once the villain is

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:09.459 
bad villain for once the villain is
actually<00:03:07.969> just<00:03:08.120> the<00:03:08.359> force<00:03:08.659> or<00:03:09.079> you<00:03:09.319> know

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:09.469 
actually just the force or you know

00:03:09.469 --> 00:03:10.839 
actually just the force or you know
something<00:03:09.829> a<00:03:09.889> little<00:03:10.040> bit<00:03:10.159> more<00:03:10.189> and<00:03:10.579> I<00:03:10.639> won't

00:03:10.839 --> 00:03:10.849 
something a little bit more and I won't

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:13.959 
something a little bit more and I won't
say<00:03:11.000> what<00:03:11.120> it<00:03:11.239> is<00:03:11.269> but<00:03:12.189> we<00:03:13.189> don't<00:03:13.310> have<00:03:13.639> an<00:03:13.790> end

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:13.969 
say what it is but we don't have an end

00:03:13.969 --> 00:03:15.550 
say what it is but we don't have an end
we<00:03:14.209> have<00:03:14.359> an<00:03:14.450> eminent<00:03:14.840> threat<00:03:14.900> but<00:03:15.260> I'm<00:03:15.379> not<00:03:15.530> a

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
we have an eminent threat but I'm not a

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.140 
we have an eminent threat but I'm not a
physical<00:03:15.889> nature<00:03:16.189> and<00:03:16.760> that's<00:03:16.909> kind<00:03:17.120> of

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
physical nature and that's kind of

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:18.610 
physical nature and that's kind of
interesting<00:03:17.569> to<00:03:17.659> see<00:03:17.690> how<00:03:17.900> the<00:03:17.959> girls<00:03:18.290> react

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
interesting to see how the girls react

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.409 
interesting to see how the girls react
to<00:03:18.799> that<00:03:18.949> rather<00:03:19.129> than<00:03:19.340> dealing<00:03:19.849> with<00:03:20.030> it<00:03:20.150> foe

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:20.419 
to that rather than dealing with it foe

00:03:20.419 --> 00:03:22.300 
to that rather than dealing with it foe
and<00:03:20.569> adversary<00:03:21.049> and<00:03:21.169> kind<00:03:21.290> of<00:03:21.319> like<00:03:21.440> a<00:03:21.500> monster

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
and adversary and kind of like a monster

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:23.949 
and adversary and kind of like a monster
of<00:03:22.430> the<00:03:22.549> week<00:03:22.579> kind<00:03:23.030> of<00:03:23.120> situation<00:03:23.690> which<00:03:23.870> I

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:23.959 
of the week kind of situation which I

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:27.159 
of the week kind of situation which I
kind<00:03:24.229> of<00:03:24.319> hated<00:03:24.560> in<00:03:24.829> a<00:03:24.919> sense<00:03:25.159> but<00:03:25.430> which<00:03:26.389> draws

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:27.169 
kind of hated in a sense but which draws

00:03:27.169 --> 00:03:29.199 
kind of hated in a sense but which draws
me<00:03:27.379> into<00:03:27.500> my<00:03:27.829> cons<00:03:28.280> about<00:03:28.699> the<00:03:28.879> actual

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 
me into my cons about the actual

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:31.839 
me into my cons about the actual
episodes<00:03:29.810> which<00:03:30.139> I<00:03:30.590> don't<00:03:31.250> know<00:03:31.340> why<00:03:31.519> throw

00:03:31.839 --> 00:03:31.849 
episodes which I don't know why throw

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:33.309 
episodes which I don't know why throw
the<00:03:31.970> entire<00:03:32.090> episode

00:03:33.309 --> 00:03:33.319 
the entire episode

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:35.740 
the entire episode
it<00:03:33.709> just<00:03:33.979> felt<00:03:34.189> lackluster<00:03:34.819> didn't<00:03:35.180> feel<00:03:35.389> that

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
it just felt lackluster didn't feel that

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.530 
it just felt lackluster didn't feel that
you<00:03:36.019> know<00:03:36.109> um<00:03:36.319> fee<00:03:36.650> and<00:03:36.949> my<00:03:37.819> only<00:03:38.090> theory<00:03:38.359> about

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 
you know um fee and my only theory about

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.089 
you know um fee and my only theory about
this<00:03:38.810> is<00:03:38.959> that<00:03:39.139> maybe<00:03:39.470> because<00:03:39.709> we<00:03:39.889> didn't

00:03:40.089 --> 00:03:40.099 
this is that maybe because we didn't

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:42.759 
this is that maybe because we didn't
have<00:03:40.129> a<00:03:40.220> physical<00:03:41.180> imminent<00:03:41.780> threat<00:03:42.109> by

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:42.769 
have a physical imminent threat by

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:43.839 
have a physical imminent threat by
physical<00:03:43.280> is<00:03:43.340> something<00:03:43.549> that<00:03:43.639> we<00:03:43.729> can

00:03:43.839 --> 00:03:43.849 
physical is something that we can

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:46.780 
physical is something that we can

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:08.419 
nice but that kind of made it lackluster

00:04:08.419 --> 00:04:10.030 
nice but that kind of made it lackluster
too<00:04:08.540> just<00:04:08.720> didn't<00:04:09.109> make<00:04:09.229> it<00:04:09.379> so<00:04:09.590> exciting

a few seconds blows up and become

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:53.330 
a few seconds blows up and become
something<00:04:52.410> big<00:04:52.680> that's<00:04:52.890> actually<00:04:53.160> kind<00:04:53.280> of

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340 
something big that's actually kind of

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:56.930 
something big that's actually kind of
great<00:04:53.750> anyways<00:04:54.920> overall<00:04:55.920> season<00:04:56.490> through

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:56.940 
great anyways overall season through

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:58.730 
great anyways overall season through
season<00:04:57.420> fours<00:04:57.600> opener<00:04:58.110> of<00:04:58.290> the<00:04:58.380> first<00:04:58.590> two

00:04:58.730 --> 00:04:58.740 
season fours opener of the first two

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:00.800 
season fours opener of the first two
episodes<00:04:59.100> wasn't<00:04:59.640> that<00:04:59.730> bad<00:04:59.970> in<00:05:00.510> fact<00:05:00.690> I

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:00.810 
episodes wasn't that bad in fact I

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:01.880 
episodes wasn't that bad in fact I
actually<00:05:00.870> think<00:05:01.110> it's<00:05:01.260> better<00:05:01.320> than<00:05:01.680> season

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:01.890 
actually think it's better than season

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:05.060 
actually think it's better than season
three's<00:05:02.250> opener<00:05:02.790> but<00:05:03.120> not<00:05:04.110> by<00:05:04.320> much<00:05:04.560> I<00:05:04.710> still

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:05.070 
three's opener but not by much I still

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:06.920 
three's opener but not by much I still
rub<00:05:05.280> I<00:05:05.460> still<00:05:05.850> think<00:05:06.030> that<00:05:06.060> season<00:05:06.420> 2<00:05:06.570> 1<00:05:06.780> and

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:06.930 
rub I still think that season 2 1 and

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:08.510 
rub I still think that season 2 1 and
2's<00:05:07.110> are<00:05:07.260> pretty<00:05:07.500> much<00:05:07.590> on<00:05:07.830> the<00:05:08.010> top<00:05:08.190> tier<00:05:08.490> and

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:08.520 
2's are pretty much on the top tier and

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.300 
2's are pretty much on the top tier and
the<00:05:08.820> other<00:05:09.000> needs<00:05:09.420> recent<00:05:09.810> -<00:05:09.900> or<00:05:10.410> on<00:05:10.560> bond<00:05:10.770> but

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:11.310 
the other needs recent - or on bond but

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:11.990 
the other needs recent - or on bond but
not<00:05:11.430> that<00:05:11.610> bad

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:12.000 
not that bad

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.350 
not that bad

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:27.570 
not really I know how to consider this I

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:29.300 
not really I know how to consider this I
always<00:05:28.020> think<00:05:28.200> is<00:05:28.260> like<00:05:28.380> all<00:05:28.650> these<00:05:28.919> two<00:05:29.100> part

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:29.310

always think is like all these two part
of<00:05:29.370> there's<00:05:29.490> just<00:05:29.520> one<00:05:29.820> episode<00:05:30.210> but<00:05:30.240> in

00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:30.419 
of there's just one episode but in

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:32.810 
of there's just one episode but in
reality<00:05:30.600> it<00:05:30.930> doesn't<00:05:31.080> help<00:05:31.350> that<00:05:31.560> way<00:05:31.680> so<00:05:32.070> I'll

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:32.820
