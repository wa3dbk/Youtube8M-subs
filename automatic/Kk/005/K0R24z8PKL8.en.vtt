with paper yet if you see here they

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:29.730 
with paper yet if you see here they
start<00:02:25.900> the<00:02:26.020> glue<00:02:26.230> right<00:02:26.560> there<00:02:26.830> in<00:02:27.160> and<00:02:28.740> then

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:29.740 
start the glue right there in and then

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:33.960 
start the glue right there in and then
glue<00:02:30.670> the<00:02:30.850> paper<00:02:30.970> on<00:02:31.270> and<00:02:31.450> I've<00:02:31.570> done<00:02:31.840> and<00:02:32.970> this

other<00:02:37.270> than<00:02:38.140> a<00:02:38.410> collection<00:02:38.920> of<00:02:39.280> it<00:02:39.520> okay<00:02:40.920> but

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
other than a collection of it okay but

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:49.680
