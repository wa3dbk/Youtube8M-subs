think it was Henry David Thoreau's last

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.360 
think it was Henry David Thoreau's last
words<00:02:09.280> and<00:02:09.670> they<00:02:10.060> were<00:02:11.069> fencepost

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
words and they were fencepost

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:18.059

moose<00:02:13.330> or<00:02:14.140> something<00:02:14.200> like<00:02:14.650> that<00:02:16.920> so<00:02:17.920> maybe

00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:18.069 
moose or something like that so maybe

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:21.060 
moose or something like that so maybe
that's<00:02:18.310> what<00:02:18.459> I'll<00:02:18.550> say<00:02:18.580> at<00:02:18.760> the<00:02:18.879> end
