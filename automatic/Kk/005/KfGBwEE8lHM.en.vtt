00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.979
 What I normally do is make a post 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:54.830
 in which a video is included in the 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:58.550

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:19.850
 now from the blog the truth that so far 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:22.580
 I had to stop a bit because the 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:24.260
 work or the organization of the wedding and 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:26.660
 well everyone has joined me a little 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:28.580
 but I'm a lot calmer 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:31.670
 much happier 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:34.460
 and I can dedicate more time to blog like this 

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:37.790
 what we are going to do is try 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:40.640
 post one-two-day tutorials 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:44.240
 or every day what we are doing 

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:46.310
 because this has a job behind very 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:48.200
 great then what can we go 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:51.080
