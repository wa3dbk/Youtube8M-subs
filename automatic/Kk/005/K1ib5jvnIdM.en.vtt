 talk are mateus or matheus blog 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.690
 haunted dot com bring a 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.760
 news for you, I'll tell you when 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.700
 there are tunnels underneath the surface 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:22.920
 that lunar where you can live being 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:26.939
 only the shadow sticker is the 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:30.420
 next there are scientists on the moon 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:32.369
 already know that there are some tunnels only 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.180
 now a new study there in 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.670
 texas 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.770
 presented at the science conference 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.840
 planetary and lunar shown that it can 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.420
 tunes with larger diameters of 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.940
 one kilometer that they are stable the 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.219
 sufficient to allow a dwelling 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.690
 permanent in it so that as soon as 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.600
 means this 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.730
 can not have holes very low 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.940
 of large lunar surface caves that 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:59.190
 are stable and make it possible to 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.260
 example establishes a city within 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.840
 Of these holes, you understand. 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.420
 interesting news including 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.770
 scientists detect 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.680
 lunar surface that they call 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.750
 also skylights this image here 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.210
 but there is no way to see it inside the 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:19.409
 tunnel that is why the scientist who 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:21.930
 did the oo study since score 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:24.900
 he suggests we send probes to the 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:27.060
 amount that will come up 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.229
 clear good display on what was inside 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.270
 of this tunnel 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.950
 he used to publish such studies and 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.900
 simulations with the singer, right? 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.840
 he put the data on the computer was 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:39.150
 It was estimated that he found that there is 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.610
 the largest possible diameter of a tunnel 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.979
 of the moon is 5 miles in five 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.720
 kilometers each a very large city 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.119
 in the case of him showed a poster that the 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:51.780
 philadelphia city inside a tunnel 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:53.970
 now the question is haunted the will be 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:57.380
 what extraterrestrials is now for the 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:02:00.540
 conspiracy theory do not use these 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:02.980
 skylights and tunnels as a base 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.510
 lunar from there that comes out nothing 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:07.720
 because there are several 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:09.820
 UFO records on the moon for the 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:12.430
 filming you just run the internet I do not 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:14.710
 my site that we founded the b point that 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.930
 has in the category squid will have much 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:20.230
 interesting thing that has several 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:22.780
 it's also photographs on the moon posting 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:26.170
 some interesting things 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.940
 will they live and text in those clear 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.370
 in those tunnels there 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:32.770
 and will it be that we humans can 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.840
 also living inside these 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:39.250
 tunnels because it is a good 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:41.470
 they protect us we will protect from 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.840
 radiation of the universe of the 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:46.720
 temperature on the moon is also 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.910
 of the impact of meteorites the moon suffers 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.720
 bombard the actress while it is full 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:51.850
 of notebook 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:56.250
 then a pump underneath the surface 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:56.250
 and not on its surface 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:01.960
 since we are talking about the moon and they 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:06.070
 nor if I'm going to bring two products here 

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:07.630
 today the dvd and plants the girls and a 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:09.610
 book that pretty clearly that the citizen 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:13.470
 He lived in my store for a long time. 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:16.630
 is a book here of the sun kasper dino 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:23.410
 brown sugar contact with UFOs 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:25.959
 - castle second edition of 1957 is 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:27.280
 Difficult gcm who wants nobody is 70 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:29.050
 real 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.300
 but you're going to have an excellent book 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:32.709
 still your library 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:34.780
 to know more about your products 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:37.090
 access here the shop is natural point 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:38.830
 com in the description plus the music 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:41.020
 digital bit of the title would be 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:44.380
 summary will read and will have a little trick 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:46.840
 of a trailer of this documentary here 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:48.760
 it's worth it and personal tip mateus 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.800
 So that's it, I hope you have 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:53.980
 liked to know this news story 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:56.170
 that tunnels can have before the 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:59.440
 large enough to sustain 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:01.420
 permanently life there on the moon 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:04.780
 Will I live under the earth? 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:06.340
 on the moon leaves and on the opinions 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:08.080
 what do you think 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:11.110
 Would you like to live in one of these? 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:13.709
 studies only there on the moon even more
