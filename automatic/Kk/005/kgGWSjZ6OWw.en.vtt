so<00:01:40.090> you<00:01:40.180> develop<00:01:40.480> that<00:01:40.810> carmelization<00:01:41.470> all

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:41.980 
so you develop that carmelization all

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:44.040 
so you develop that carmelization all
the<00:01:42.430> way<00:01:42.580> through<00:01:42.910> not<00:01:43.120> just<00:01:43.180> on<00:01:43.540> the<00:01:43.660> outside

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:44.050

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590 
you're in a hurry slice them caramelize

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:48.960 
you're in a hurry slice them caramelize
them<00:01:47.770> on<00:01:47.860> the<00:01:47.980> outside<00:01:48.400> and<00:01:48.610> call<00:01:48.790> it<00:01:48.940> good

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:48.970

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.500 
being done if you start to dry out what

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.030 
being done if you start to dry out what
happens<00:01:56.920> is<00:01:57.480> the<00:01:58.480> moisture<00:01:59.320> keeps<00:01:59.590> coming<00:01:59.890> out

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:00.040 
happens is the moisture keeps coming out

happens is the moisture keeps coming out
of<00:02:00.130> the<00:02:00.220> onions<00:02:00.610> whenever<00:02:01.120> they<00:02:01.270> start<00:02:01.540> to<00:02:01.660> dry
