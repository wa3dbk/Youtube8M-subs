00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:13.860
 you guys are still here on the 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.859
 samsung unpacked event at ifa 2014 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.470
 and we are now looking to talk 

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:22.020
 Samsung Galaxy S to the new smart watch 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.279
 from samsung , they are now one 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.539
 a little bit much glitter that needs 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.500
 not to be afraid it exists 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.900
 of course without them 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.730
 swarovski crystals that's one 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.960
 special edition de very much bling 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.450
 Bling should bring 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.940
 i find must be exaggerated but be it 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.129
 The clock itself is the first one 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.360
 Samsung watch with a curved display 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.969
 You are here from the side even 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.719
 bent relatively strong 

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:45.000
 Of course he sees that a bit 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.530
 Better ID on the wrist because of it 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.420
 It was better for the poor 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.149
 But the clock is also very big for that 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:54.120
 advised the display diagonal of 2 inches 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.190
 that's relatively a lot for smart watch 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.530
 He last greed I think 16 inches 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.289
 and that is a lot more 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.059
 Awesome amoled displays is bent over what 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.619
 actually looks very nice of the 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.960
 Contrast yes of the color representation 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.850
 I like that 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.369
 smartphones rose gs is actually 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.290
 Constantly that means she has in principle 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.100
 it works without a smartphone 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.150
 even if it is for some things 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.280
 must be connected 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.420
 for that you need a sim card and you 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.540
 is sitting down here 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.460
 besides , we are still the heart rate 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.960
 readers who already know of the greedy fit 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.170
 and lift load contacts you have to 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.560
 again a peel a clips here 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.970
 bottom name even in central home button 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.130
 which in the case the display on and 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.840
 otherwise it only switches off the clock 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.520
 go over again and do it 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.300
 the page itself the notifications 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.380
 that I have 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:45.289
 They are sorted by time and just 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.340
 summarized after apps it goes 

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:48.539
 of course, the dial can I 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.490
 change as I want that looks then 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:52.170
 very classic if I just that 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.640
 but still wants to get here 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.740
 example with tabs displayed how many 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.409
 run today and is busy 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.720
 the date in the other direction second 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:03.420
 For example , I get apps from here 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.830
 my fitness counter or the news app 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.610
 what can be read in the world by reading 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.530
 happens 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.840
 that also works very well 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.190
 he reacts very fluently because you can 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.049
 do not say anything I like that 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.370
 very well 

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:15.840
 The processor inside is a dual core 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.420
 processor with 1 gigahertz if I have 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:21.480
 the same amount of 512 gb ram and 4 gigabytes 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.459
 internal memory but actually enough 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.560
 for this completely out you can now 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:27.390
 also up here second and comes 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.980
 then not in such an android completely 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.480
 menu and see that here 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.040
 actually can do a lot 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.890
 what I do with my smartphone too 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.210
 can make 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.440
 For example, in the messages 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:38.780
 go and then you see how the whole 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:43.340
 I will be served here write times 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:45.110
 is she maybe writing an answer 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.740
 no answer i can not do it 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:47.480
 answer write 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:50.260
 but that's what I'm allowed to do here 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:53.690
 actually a qwerty keyboard 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:55.190
 what I do not know if that is faded in 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.410
 good service knows you have to go in the 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:59.840
 practice times 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:01.070
 Hi well it goes but whether that so good 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.570
 is of course the small display 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:05.360
 is the question but of course you can 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:06.410
 Everything via svs with language control 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.720
 for example, the text for such a 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:10.280
 enter message 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.390
 that is the galaxy go there first so 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.459
 very short overview 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:14.660
 I'm curious is relatively big 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:17.180
 As I said from the smart watch yet 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:19.010
 not easy but of course 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.510
 bent and independently with its own 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:22.370
 this is already a step forward 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:25.670
 in my eyes maybe there is more 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:27.590
 use as a discussion partner 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:29.390
 that was really together us 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:31.750
 created adoration mobile thanks a lot 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:31.750
 for watching
