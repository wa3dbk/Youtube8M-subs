so um downloaded it and gave it a shot

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:26.529 
so um downloaded it and gave it a shot
it<00:00:22.439> looks<00:00:22.769> pretty<00:00:22.980> good<00:00:23.310> it's<00:00:24.619> it's<00:00:25.619> fast<00:00:25.980> it's

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:26.539 
it looks pretty good it's it's fast it's

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:31.759 
it looks pretty good it's it's fast it's
it's<00:00:27.539> not<00:00:27.720> overly<00:00:28.170> fast<00:00:28.680> like<00:00:30.140> some<00:00:31.140> roms<00:00:31.470> out

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
it's not overly fast like some roms out

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.770 
it's not overly fast like some roms out
there<00:00:32.009> it's<00:00:32.570> more<00:00:33.570> of<00:00:33.899> a<00:00:34.170> graceful<00:00:34.950> fast<00:00:35.780> well

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
there it's more of a graceful fast well

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.810 
there it's more of a graceful fast well
that's<00:00:37.200> what<00:00:37.410> I<00:00:37.440> think<00:00:38.989> it<00:00:39.989> feels<00:00:40.739> good<00:00:41.070> to<00:00:41.430> use

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
that's what I think it feels good to use

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:48.560 
that's what I think it feels good to use
and<00:00:42.360> it's<00:00:42.660> very<00:00:42.989> smooth<00:00:45.620> like<00:00:47.030> you<00:00:48.030> don't<00:00:48.239> see

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
and it's very smooth like you don't see

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.520 
and it's very smooth like you don't see
it<00:00:48.899> going<00:00:49.550> right<00:00:50.550> into<00:00:51.199> something<00:00:52.199> else<00:00:52.320> it

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
it going right into something else it

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.680 
it going right into something else it
will<00:00:52.620> take<00:00:52.829> its<00:00:53.039> time<00:00:53.309> but<00:00:54.270> not<00:00:54.570> in<00:00:54.870> a<00:00:54.960> way<00:00:54.989> that

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:56.690 
will take its time but not in a way that

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.020 
will take its time but not in a way that
that<00:00:57.690> makes<00:00:58.050> it<00:00:58.230> feel<00:00:58.500> like<00:00:58.530> it's<00:00:58.829> lagging<00:00:59.370> so

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
that makes it feel like it's lagging so

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.260 
that makes it feel like it's lagging so
I<00:01:00.500> can't<00:01:01.500> appreciate<00:01:01.829> that<00:01:02.280> it<00:01:02.640> feels<00:01:03.000> nice

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
I can't appreciate that it feels nice

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.780
