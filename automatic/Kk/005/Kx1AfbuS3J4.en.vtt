00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
going to stamp these at an angle you can

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.080 
going to stamp these at an angle you can
stamp<00:02:28.440> them<00:02:28.620> however<00:02:28.800> you<00:02:29.099> want<00:02:29.129> in<00:02:29.610> fact<00:02:29.849> I

probably would try to do different
angles<00:02:34.620> on<00:02:34.860> different<00:02:35.190> fingers<00:02:35.519> just<00:02:35.760> sort<00:02:36.060> of

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
angles on different fingers just sort of

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.089 
angles on different fingers just sort of
try<00:02:36.269> to<00:02:36.330> make<00:02:36.540> it<00:02:36.660> somewhat<00:02:37.260> random<00:02:37.769> or<00:02:37.980> you

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:38.099 
try to make it somewhat random or you

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:40.460

can actually I just realized I did every
other<00:02:40.500> one<00:02:40.830> no<00:02:41.480> and<00:02:42.480> since<00:02:43.019> I<00:02:43.260> have<00:02:43.290> a<00:02:43.470> little

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
other one no and since I have a little

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:45.380 
other one no and since I have a little
blank<00:02:43.950> spot<00:02:44.190> up<00:02:44.310> there<00:02:44.340> you<00:02:44.760> could<00:02:44.940> leave<00:02:45.209> it

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
blank spot up there you could leave it

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.090 
blank spot up there you could leave it
if<00:02:45.690> you<00:02:45.870> like<00:02:46.080> the<00:02:46.200> way<00:02:46.290> that<00:02:46.470> looks<00:02:46.530> or<00:02:46.980> you

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
if you like the way that looks or you

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.980 
if you like the way that looks or you
can<00:02:47.250> add

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:47.990 
can add

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:52.450 
can add
the<00:02:48.560> edge<00:02:48.740> of<00:02:49.040> a<00:02:49.160> flower<00:02:50.140> ok<00:02:51.140> so<00:02:52.100> now<00:02:52.220> i<00:02:52.250> have<00:02:52.280> a

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:52.460 
the edge of a flower ok so now i have a

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:54.940 
the edge of a flower ok so now i have a
partial<00:02:52.760> flower<00:02:53.150> which<00:02:53.630> probably<00:02:54.440> looks<00:02:54.860> a

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
partial flower which probably looks a

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:56.380 
partial flower which probably looks a
little<00:02:55.160> strange<00:02:55.370> at<00:02:55.700> the<00:02:55.790> moment<00:02:56.210> just

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
little strange at the moment just

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:59.460
