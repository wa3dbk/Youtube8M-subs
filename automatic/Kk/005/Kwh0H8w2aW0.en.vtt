00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:07.080
 hello youtube friends this time I'm going to 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:12.769
 explain how the tablet connects 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:16.949
 galaxy note 8 with an android version of 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:20.910
 4.1.2 good the previous time already had 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:23.220
 done with the 10 with the galaxy not 10 and 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.570
 this time it is with the 8 is one of the 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.330
 newer versions that is 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.550
 currently in the market and I'm going to 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.009
 explain how it connects to the 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.120
 television ok 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.910
 good 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.260
 the connection cable 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.879
 is 3 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:46.089
 1 the usb port the other one that goes 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:48.280
 directly to the tablet and here and this 

00:00:46.089 --> 00:00:51.789
 which is what television is for 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:55.000
 which is what gives the high definition ok and 

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:57.220
 as you will already know the galaxy not because it brings the 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:02.560
 weight 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:04.900
 or pencil ok ok first we're going to 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:07.510
 connect what is the tablet or is the 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:09.550
 port of entry of the tablet port 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:13.500
 of the antara tablet because everyone knows 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:13.500
 it connects here 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:22.680
 there are connected then 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:25.740
 the port is I saw that this is going to go to what 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.870
 what is the connection or the connection 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.410
 what is 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:35.940
 which is the one that produces the load the tablet 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:38.410
 then when when you connect this 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:40.810
 again the table will produce a 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:43.150
 sound has to produce a sound of 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:45.790
 the tablet like it's loading like 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:46.930
 who is holding energy ok 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:49.720
 so I 'm going to upload a bit of 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:52.140
 volume to be heard and I'm going to 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.140
 connect 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:59.290
 there that's not ok 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.870
 the only problem they're going to have with the 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:04.630
 cable is that the connection to 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:06.790
 outlet and USB port is 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.380
 too short to reach the 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:11.260
 televisions that are sometimes 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:14.150
 towards the top right now 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:16.459
 I will connect what is 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:19.980
 in the high definition input to the 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:24.060
 television not without first showing them 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:25.500
 and on the tablet it produces there in the icon 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.239
 of cargo that is loading that 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.000
 means that it is connected that is 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:32.240
 well connected good now I'm going to 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.650
 connect what is 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:39.329
 the high definition input on the tv 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:39.329
 and we are going to do it here 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:47.959
 and the tablet is going to give that is what 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:50.400
 it says stereo or envelope because it 's 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:52.020
 stereo is the best way for the 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.780
 sound tablet would be in the 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:56.569
 television and I'm going to put it on 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.810
 okay 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:03.160
 and already doing that 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:04.950
 let's select I'll select in 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.660
 television 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:10.990
 what it is 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:15.330
 the input the number 2 or the entry number 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:15.330
 2 and let's do that 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:24.420
 there it is connected to the 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:27.319
 television and you can turn the 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:30.090
 do it like that and there 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:34.790
 automatically you can do your 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:34.790
 games play if they want 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:41.960
 well this takes a little bit for 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:44.390
 load up but well there is that 

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:47.270
 we're going to give this one out let's see 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:49.400
 You can also play from the 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:51.410
 tablet can play their games 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:54.440
 auto cars what you want 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:56.060
 almost everything can be done if you will see it there 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.810
 I already have this game pre selected 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:00.860
 to play 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:03.180
 so it is that there is so you 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:08.390
 they can automatically play as if 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:08.390
 they were playing in a play station ok 

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:17.510
