00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:08.069
 hello to all these would stay 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:11.730
 today I am with mambo hi and 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.349
 with him open hi and we wished 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.750
 tell you about the new openness of 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.400
 the recruitment phase of members on 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:21.330
 red hood because we recruit new from 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.980
 people yes indeed so we decided this 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.580
 it would be different from both 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.740
 last time 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.029
 we wanted to simply propose 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.560
 possibility to join redwood at 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.750
 any time and this for a 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.090
 duration for the moment indeterminate so 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.340
 we will close that when we have enough 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.809
 of people that we will not want to 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.579
 to add two members pass roughly 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.860
 the same thing of the group so suddenly the 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.020
 unfolding will be similar almost 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.680
 at the old session so I leave 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.719
 yeuse pretty much explain it so we 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.430
 are you judging mainly on two 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.410
 things so the first one it's a 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.930
 little presentation video not too much 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.640
 long on why is that wanted 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.390
 join the server and your experience 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:02.820
 on minecraft is also a small text 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:05.159
 in which you are not going to talk to us 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.909
 a little bit of 2 how are you approaching 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:11.520
 youtube and what you do on 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.320
 youtube what's your goal pretty much what 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.439
 kind of things and you go 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.820
 mainly judged on it and we will 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.840
 ask you for three more 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.390
 information to be able to you 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:25.020
 recontact but overall it's that 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.189
 that you are asked then this time by 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.909
 against compared to the last time 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:31.170
 if by chance you would never 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.700
 makes video on youtube 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.770
 no adventure followed this case the last 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.450
 time we asked it is not serious 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.950
 you could do from the moment 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.750
 where did you see this candidacy this 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.909
 video have told you about counterfeit bills 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.509
 studies since as said number 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.979
 low 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.780
 we have no limit in time so 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.119
 we will judge you on what you did 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:51.750
 and country formerly nicknamed 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:55.380
 this is it yeah so it's really 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:57.060
 that's the principle we want to want 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.259
 set up this time it's 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.729
 really give it a chance 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.829
 world so that's why you have 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.840
 all the time you want so you 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:05.670
 do not rush it's useless and it's 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.960
 the same if you ever say after 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.489
 two days that you have posted your 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.840
 candidacy yeah why I always 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.550
 no answer it's perfectly normal 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.569
 it's simply because we want 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.159
 see closely 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:16.620
 follow you to see if you get to 

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:18.450
 for example to keep pace with 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.230
 post a video every week where 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.090
 every two weeks 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.280
 it's useless to post 50 videos a 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.480
 same day how do we look 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.920
 it's on the long run but it's 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.950
 especially low power for example 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:31.200
 you're comfortable on video or what and 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.620
 so low you respect a little bit 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.060
 that we recommend on the server vaduz 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.370
 so if you want to join the server 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:41.450

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:44.700
 the description of the youtube video 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:47.519
 no I think we said everything there I 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.569
 think it's pretty much everything yeah good bah 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:50.430
 if you did not understand something 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:52.049
 was not to go back in the 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.909
 video and feel free to share this

 video for going to live the adventures of 

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:57.540
 at most possible world 

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:59.459
 Well, I think we can 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.629
 say goodbye from there ok hi
