00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.340 

oh<00:00:01.580> it's<00:00:02.580> a<00:00:02.790> bigger<00:00:03.090> moment<00:00:03.330> I<00:00:03.600> think<00:00:03.810> for<00:00:04.080> Team

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:04.350 
oh it's a bigger moment I think for Team

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:11.150 
oh it's a bigger moment I think for Team
USA<00:00:04.529> than<00:00:05.220> it<00:00:05.339> is<00:00:05.490> France<00:00:09.650> having<00:00:10.650> already<00:00:10.800> got

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
USA than it is France having already got

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.079 
USA than it is France having already got
the<00:00:11.370> one<00:00:11.820> game<00:00:12.090> in<00:00:12.360> the<00:00:12.480> bank<00:00:13.940> it<00:00:14.940> is

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
the one game in the bank it is

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.710 
the one game in the bank it is
imperative<00:00:15.509> that<00:00:16.880> the<00:00:17.880> Americans<00:00:18.390> win<00:00:18.600> this

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
imperative that the Americans win this

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.840 
imperative that the Americans win this
one<00:00:18.930> otherwise<00:00:19.380> they<00:00:19.710> will<00:00:19.859> go<00:00:20.070> down<00:00:20.310> to

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
one otherwise they will go down to

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:30.950 
one otherwise they will go down to
defeat<00:00:21.240> in<00:00:21.480> the<00:00:21.600> opening<00:00:21.900> singles<00:00:22.350> match<00:00:29.960> more

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
defeat in the opening singles match more

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.440 
defeat in the opening singles match more
looking<00:00:31.679> for<00:00:31.859> the<00:00:31.949> fourth<00:00:32.189> goal<00:00:32.489> there<00:00:33.329> is

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
looking for the fourth goal there is

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.299 
looking for the fourth goal there is
always<00:00:33.719> such<00:00:33.899> a<00:00:33.930> buzz<00:00:34.320> when<00:00:34.649> you<00:00:34.739> get<00:00:34.860> 24<00:00:35.219> first

00:00:37.299 --> 00:00:37.309 
always such a buzz when you get 24 first

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:40.549 
always such a buzz when you get 24 first
just<00:00:38.309> heaps<00:00:38.579> that<00:00:38.760> little<00:00:39.180> bit<00:00:39.300> more<00:00:39.559> pressure

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
just heaps that little bit more pressure

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.950 
just heaps that little bit more pressure
on<00:00:40.800> your<00:00:41.040> opponent<00:00:43.969> but<00:00:44.969> will<00:00:45.120> it<00:00:45.239> be<00:00:45.360> Santos

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
on your opponent but will it be Santos

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:52.110 
on your opponent but will it be Santos
is<00:00:47.660> able<00:00:48.660> to<00:00:48.809> do<00:00:48.960> that<00:00:49.140> yes<00:00:49.469> it<00:00:49.680> is

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:52.120 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:57.869 

now<00:00:52.629> what's<00:00:53.050> the<00:00:53.260> decision<00:00:53.559> here<00:00:56.850> well<00:00:57.850> I

00:00:57.869 --> 00:00:57.879 
now what's the decision here well I

00:00:57.879 --> 00:00:59.430 
now what's the decision here well I
think<00:00:58.000> the<00:00:58.270> goal<00:00:58.420> may<00:00:58.690> have<00:00:58.870> been<00:00:59.019> disallowed

00:00:59.430 --> 00:00:59.440 
think the goal may have been disallowed

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.819 
think the goal may have been disallowed
they're<00:01:00.000> not<00:01:01.000> one<00:01:01.329> second<00:01:01.750> both<00:01:02.320> hands<00:01:02.620> on<00:01:02.800> the

00:01:02.819 --> 00:01:02.829 
they're not one second both hands on the

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:06.780 
they're not one second both hands on the
table<00:01:04.110> okay<00:01:05.110> well<00:01:05.830> I<00:01:05.860> think<00:01:06.070> the<00:01:06.400> decision

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:06.790 
table okay well I think the decision

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:12.200 
table okay well I think the decision
there<00:01:07.180> was<00:01:07.450> maybe<00:01:07.690> that<00:01:07.900> he<00:01:07.990> shook<00:01:08.950> the<00:01:09.070> table

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.950 

so<00:01:13.210> we<00:01:13.240> will<00:01:13.570> continue<00:01:15.509> with<00:01:16.509> the<00:01:16.690> school

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960 
so we will continue with the school

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.210 
so we will continue with the school
reset<00:01:17.530> at<00:01:17.740> three<00:01:18.009> all<00:01:19.080> that<00:01:20.220> controversial

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:21.220 
reset at three all that controversial

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:26.249 
reset at three all that controversial
moment<00:01:21.880> it<00:01:22.119> did<00:01:22.720> not<00:01:22.810> really<00:01:23.440> seem<00:01:23.770> as<00:01:23.979> if<00:01:25.259> he

00:01:26.249 --> 00:01:26.259 
moment it did not really seem as if he

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:28.410 
moment it did not really seem as if he
had<00:01:26.470> moved<00:01:26.710> the<00:01:26.830> table<00:01:27.039> and<00:01:27.310> I<00:01:27.369> think<00:01:27.420> big

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:28.420 
had moved the table and I think big

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.240 
had moved the table and I think big
welder<00:01:28.660> center<00:01:29.170> Slott<00:01:29.440> certainly<00:01:30.039> didn't

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250 
welder center Slott certainly didn't

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.290 
welder center Slott certainly didn't
like<00:01:30.399> the<00:01:30.550> decision<00:01:31.030> that<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:33.880> referee

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:34.300 
like the decision that the referee

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:44.530 
like the decision that the referee
absolutely<00:01:34.840> adamant

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:44.540 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.530 

well<00:01:45.170> mercifully<00:01:45.860> perhaps<00:01:46.310> most<00:01:47.210> of<00:01:47.390> all<00:01:47.480> for

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:47.540 
well mercifully perhaps most of all for

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.210 
well mercifully perhaps most of all for
the<00:01:47.780> referee<00:01:48.140> that<00:01:48.500> one<00:01:48.620> didn't<00:01:48.920> go<00:01:49.040> in

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:49.220 
the referee that one didn't go in

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.230 
the referee that one didn't go in
because<00:01:50.860> it'll<00:01:51.860> be<00:01:51.920> very<00:01:52.190> controversial<00:01:52.850> if

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
because it'll be very controversial if

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.510 
because it'll be very controversial if
the<00:01:53.780> USA<00:01:54.200> had<00:01:54.320> taken<00:01:54.680> lead<00:01:54.890> as<00:01:55.070> a<00:01:55.100> direct

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
the USA had taken lead as a direct

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:04.780 
the USA had taken lead as a direct
result<00:01:55.670> of<00:01:55.940> the<00:01:56.000> disallowed<00:01:56.480> goal<00:02:03.520> no<00:02:04.520> more

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:04.790 
result of the disallowed goal no more

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:09.040 
result of the disallowed goal no more
we'll<00:02:05.000> get<00:02:05.270> another<00:02:05.540> go<00:02:07.810> looking<00:02:08.810> for<00:02:08.899> the

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
we'll get another go looking for the

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:24.000 
we'll get another go looking for the
rollover<00:02:09.560> finish<00:02:09.860> once<00:02:10.070> again<00:02:14.410> good<00:02:15.410> save

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.500 

little<00:02:25.010> lucky<00:02:25.340> to<00:02:25.489> get<00:02:25.610> that<00:02:25.670> one<00:02:25.940> back<00:02:26.209> magh

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
little lucky to get that one back magh

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:31.420 
little lucky to get that one back magh
well<00:02:28.390> then<00:02:29.390> he<00:02:29.480> did<00:02:29.690> eventually<00:02:30.430> lose

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
well then he did eventually lose

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.479 
well then he did eventually lose
possession<00:02:31.700> he<00:02:32.090> was<00:02:32.209> trying<00:02:32.480> the<00:02:32.659> spray<00:02:33.049> pass

long range effort that he specializes in

long range effort that he specializes in
although<00:02:50.360> that<00:02:50.690> one<00:02:50.870> took<00:02:51.079> a<00:02:51.230> mighty

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
although that one took a mighty

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:57.789 
although that one took a mighty
deflection<00:02:52.459> off<00:02:52.579> the<00:02:53.269> French<00:02:53.510> five<00:02:53.780> bar<00:02:56.799> so
