didn't feel pretty it was not enjoyable

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:45.940 
didn't feel pretty it was not enjoyable
um<00:02:43.840> but<00:02:44.840> it's<00:02:44.990> worth<00:02:45.170> it<00:02:45.320> I<00:02:45.530> mean<00:02:45.800> it's

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
um but it's worth it I mean it's

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:47.020 
um but it's worth it I mean it's
definitely<00:02:46.340> worth<00:02:46.459> it<00:02:46.610> to<00:02:46.730> have<00:02:46.850> it<00:02:47.000> done

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030
