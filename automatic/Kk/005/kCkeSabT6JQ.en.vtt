00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.879
 Tell me guys, this is the file. 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:07.859
 today is April 22, 2015 and why 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:11.250
 I made a point of saying the date because 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:15.269
 Yesterday, the 21st of the year, 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.800
 version of adobe light on and up to this 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.240
 I found no tutorial in 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.810
 Portuguese then you probably 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.160
 watching this tutorial that I 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.680
 I will introduce you to a new 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.320
 light 16 function and be 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.609
 probably the first Brazilians to 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:32.300
 listen or watch a tutorial on 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.300
 Portuguese 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.980
 I recorded a video for about a 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:47.610
 six months ago saying talking about the 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:50.190
 hdr or false lightroom already had 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.890
 a very good potential to work 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:56.100
 with dynamic range with an image ro 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:59.100
 but now it 's in Haiti 16 and it's possible 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:02.220
 you actually do the real hdr or 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:05.070
 whether with multiple exposures and the 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:08.370
 you use a 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:12.360
 file ró you merging three files 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:14.850
 after you make the master for hdr the 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.950
 file still goes the I do not know 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:20.280
 no other software that makes this 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:22.830
 Okay, well, come on, I did the 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.320
 download here three images of the own 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.150
 adobe website made available these 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.100
 three pictures so we can 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.750
 so that we could really do 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.630
 the test know a little more of this 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.220
 function inside the light where you are 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.770
 so it's very simple with you three 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.570
 selected photos can be made with 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.580
 three more photos also depends a lot on the 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.080
 your exposure is highly dependent on 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:46.050
 true to your photograph 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:48.000
 you click with the right mix 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:50.539
 hdr photo 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.789
 the other option is also to see photo 

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:58.170
 merge hdr photo 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:02:01.770
 hdrs panel opens it reads 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:04.800
 is the creation of hdr and in a magic trick 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:07.259
 it already already speaks overlap 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:09.479
 of the three images is here on the side 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.709
 right you have some options 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.200
 we have the alignment part 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:14.610
 automatic and if this part is very useful 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.170
 this very useful function if you do not 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.480
 have taken a picture with the tripod 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:21.209
 example, you can do it with alignment. 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:25.440
 actually aligning the photos is the 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:28.680
 Tomato, what are you going to ask for? It's a 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.930
 suggestion for Haiti is to make a 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:34.050
 ultramarathon for you a suggestion one 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:37.020
 automation of tones is in the 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:39.209
 However as I said the lighting itself 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.470
 will you save this photo in rome then we 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:43.890
 We can also process 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:46.020
 here is the part of the intensity of the 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:48.480
 The ghost is not going to have that much difference 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:49.930
 in this example because the photos she 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.879
 we do not have both 1 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.680
 both the distortion so show 

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:55.480
 the ghost overlap if you 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.730
 want to see where he applied for goals 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.700
 In this ghost photo 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:04.480
 he practically applied here is a 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:06.099
 base that's here and you're a lord, I do not think so. 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.909
 that's right he's in the area of 

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:10.359
 shadows 

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:14.859
 so if you put the debut 0 realize 

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:17.680
 that we do not have is an alignment 

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:18.849
 I need it right here if you put the 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.609
 low business 

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:24.909
 Can you visualize a bit? 

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:30.069
 here of detail in this photograph're 

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:35.379
 good, let's hope, light 1 is to generate 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:39.400
 viewing and merge right light or is 

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:43.049
 Merge these photos here 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:45.669
 we have three photos in ng is 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:48.219
 remembering that these photos were downloaded 

00:03:45.669 --> 00:03:50.590
 inside the sun of the adobe site you 

00:03:48.219 --> 00:03:53.260
 You can also download it there 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:54.370
 If you want to take a test I found 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.199
 easier because I have enough 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:58.510
 photos here is from r 

00:03:56.199 --> 00:04:00.819
 only then my personal files is 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:03.609
 I do not use hdr at weddings 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:05.199
 So it's until I find I think 

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:07.060
 take a while to save this 

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:09.099
 tutorial then I really decided to do the 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:13.090
 download the examples of the images that the 

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:14.680
 own adobe available on the site is a 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:15.939
 process that takes a little bit 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.039
 seconds these three images 

00:04:15.939 --> 00:04:20.560
 He probably lives there for almost a minute. 

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:23.320
 as she renames it as the adobe 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:28.870
 renames she names the following she 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:31.840
 puts the file name trace hdr looks 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:34.419
 how cool is still on and I mg 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:38.470
 I do not know of any other software that 

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:40.509
 you are easy hdr in roni still mg and 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:42.490
 with remain mg 

00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:44.650
 the great adobe life one balcony 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:47.380
 bring this to haiti where are you 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:50.229
 still working in bng 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:53.229
 or be a roll yourself even after the 

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:55.750
 merge the bdr you still have a rock 

00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:58.800
 and this is really cool because we can 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:02.430
 have a really good post yet 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:04.889
 hdr né every photographer who works with 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:07.080
 the style of treatment is not 

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:10.560
 but here I realize we have an exhibition 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:12.750
 is a more middle position substance and 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:14.970
 a more exposed exhibition and here 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:16.349
 we have the final hdr 

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:18.810
 I hope you have enjoyed a 

00:05:16.349 --> 00:05:21.210
 supersimple function within the lat long 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:22.740
 but I really did insist because it goes 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:24.960
 make our work a lot easier today 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:27.270
 We will not need to steal the 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:29.699
 photographs and created the dr within a 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:31.349
 another application to watch the next 

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:33.479
 video that I'll tell you too 

00:05:31.349 --> 00:05:37.759
 of an evil function that is the panorama 

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:37.759
 inside the light on up 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.090
 Hmm
