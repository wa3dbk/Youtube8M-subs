00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.850
 God other friends or more because they are very 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.770
 Well, well, I bring you a 

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:12.030
 new opinion and this time it's about the 

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:13.650
 route so I hope you like it and 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.450
 we started if you have not seen the previous 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.619
 opinion that was about you see the slide 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.480
 some part of the screen of the 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.880
 description of the video and who will sign 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.920
 that his videos is for people who know 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.859
 that is a personal opinion about an hour 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.539
 I am for people without sand ready now 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.490
 yes with that we can start the route is 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.650
 one of my favorite series that always 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.900
 I said, I really like this series 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.610
 I come back and I say I did not put it in the top 10 of 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:37.390
 my favorite animals because never 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.489
 I put in mixed 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:42.190
 in such famous animals or beers 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:44.500
 famous and well I'll give my 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:46.780
 personal opinion in this video and I already said 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.760
 for me the route is a very good series 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.070
 It has a very good story but 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.739
 Naruto is one of the directions as 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.989
 that more criticism and then people have 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:58.210
 reason to criticize sometimes we go to 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:01.510
 start with the anime naruto anime 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:03.100
 like about three years ago when I resumed 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.720
 the series because I the sedena I started 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.640
 to see in cardboard of guard does a lot 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.320
 time when I was little and I followed 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.960
 Keep watching until the end of 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:13.270
 first season of naruto that then not 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:16.030
 I knew that half to fill then 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.470
 that's why it did not cause me so much effect and so 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.509
 I did not see her again and I do not think I 'll see her 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:21.399
 because what laziness and then I started with 

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:23.380
 the broken shippuden in the anime I was 

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:25.509
 Likewise I was not very 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.700
 familiar with the filling yet what 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:30.440
 I kept watching until things came 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.750
 like a little crazy 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.400
 the filling and that's when I started 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:38.720
 realize that the naruto anime does not 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:41.810
 mames for me is very very very bad 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:44.360
 animate the mood of the anime the animation of 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.040
 Naruto I do not like at all I do not like 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.020
 the naruto animation I would dare to 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.450
 say that there are animes that are much more 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.550
 criticized that in the animation that 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.950
 naruto and for me have a better 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:56.480
 animation I do not like the animation of 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.060
 Naruto I do not like Naruto stuffing 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:00.650
 I do not like what they do with things 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.870
 of naruto that 's one reason why 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:04.940
 which he did not see again in the ims if not 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:08.899
 what I saw from a year ago and 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:10.580
 I do not even remember very well 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:14.000
 I liked nothing what I was looking at 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:15.770
 anime asia do not stop seeing it and then 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.960
 obviously I continued with the command that is like this 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:19.520
 it's something I like quite a lot now 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:22.850
 let's go with the man also send me 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:24.470
 love is one of my favorite brands to 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:26.180
 Sometimes it's my favorite manga sometimes it 's 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.220
 real e one piece practically when 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.140
 one is better than the other because I like it 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.060
 more that manga for a while or something like that 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.819
 but usually I leave these two 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:37.010
 as in the same position 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:39.829
 and well the naruto manga is a manga that 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:42.859
 I like it a lot for me kishimoto 

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:45.260
 he's a genius he's a genius but that 

00:02:42.859 --> 00:02:47.239
 genius at times like you take it out 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.950
 much profit and ends up winning in 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:50.930
 some occasions in the manga we can 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.480
 see things very effectively or we can also 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:55.760
 see very stupid things and that's a 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.290
 problem that I see kishimoto I think 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.090
 which is one of the few problems that I 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.250
 I see him I would not call him so much 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:04.159
 improvisation but if we wanted 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:06.530
 some ideas that sometimes you do not know about 

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:09.049
 where he takes it out and that's a double weapon 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:11.719
 edge because sometimes comes out very well and 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:14.000
 Sometimes it comes out lousy, it does not come out 

00:03:11.719 --> 00:03:16.969
 very bad example I could be when 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:21.169
 happened the thing about the cocales I stayed what the 

00:03:16.969 --> 00:03:23.780
 fuck no mames for god anything else can 

00:03:21.169 --> 00:03:26.840
 be something recent for example with what the 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:28.000
 sex with what cabuya me that no more 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.100
 need 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.930
 for me that was a waste of almost 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:34.360
 two years of war to end in 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:36.430
 this then those things like people 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.610
 he calls it improvisation here if 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.250
 motorcycle 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:42.110
 sometimes it works out sometimes it goes wrong 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:44.540
 it usually works well but there 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:47.600
 Sometimes I always say that if I ride and 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:49.460
 I have are the craziest mangakas that 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.950
 I have seen in my normal life that 

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:54.590
 they get some ideas that you do not know about 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:56.690
 where he takes them out ends up going well 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:58.310
 it ends up going wrong but the 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:59.900
 they end up pulling out in a way that one 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:02.430
 do not know how with an adult I also 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:04.890
 something similar could be happening 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:07.319
 wampis concordia of the fans of the 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:10.799
 fanboys and all that, however, the 

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:12.359
 tone did not change with as many fans as in 

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:14.459
 one piece then that's why this does not 

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:17.039
 it happens so much but I started like this and I 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:18.780
 I find one or another fan way that 

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:20.340
 stresses and makes me want to slap not to 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:21.720
 I really like the soundtrack that 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:24.389
 have to the point I think only my 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:27.449
 favorite soldiers I did not put it in the 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:30.240
 top of me are favorite tracks because 

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:32.280
 obviously that's unanimously famous and everything 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:34.050
 that then for that reason to the buses 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.849
 but this are undoubtedly Naomi's are three 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:38.400
 favorites in this myopic state ni 

00:04:35.849 --> 00:04:41.130
 favorite are 9006 mix favorites then 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:43.919
 is a back of this anime if I highlight it 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:45.330
 enough but up there the one is what 

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:47.260
 only I can highlight the anime 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:49.960
 why 

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:51.880
 I do not like it at all I do not know if it has now 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:53.950
 improved the animation had already done 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:57.010
 in a past video that I had looked at 

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:58.780
 a bit a part that was a video that 

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:01.810
 They went on Facebook for an episode 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:05.860
 past that was what happened to anyone 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:08.110
 So far I have not seen more and for me my 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:08.980
 it seems I saw it the same I did not see any 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:12.070
 change 

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:14.320
 I follow just as bad animation what I 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:16.390
 I saw do not know if it will have changed will have been 

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:18.670
 improved a bit I do not know I do not think about it 

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:21.160
 even to see why I continue with the manga 

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:23.740
 and it would be a waste of time to see the 

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:24.010
 anime coming out I already know what is going to 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:26.020
 happen 

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:28.750
 Naruto conclusion is a very good series 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:31.180
 a very good manga I quite like the 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:33.430
 manga as I said there are good nineties there 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:35.170
 bad times but usually the 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:37.330
 moments that go well with kiss and 

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:39.340
 motorcycles are fucking mothers are too 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:41.020
 good I love everything you have to 

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:43.570
 see with us is not one of my first 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:46.030
 animes but the first one who lives in shape 

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:47.980
 It would be since I knew it was anime 

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:49.780
 so that's why I can also have you 

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:51.640
 a little affection and I do not have in 

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:53.289
 practically much more to say if you 

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:55.419
 do you want to give your opinion on naruto 

00:05:53.289 --> 00:05:57.129
 what do you think if you like it if you do not like it 

00:05:55.419 --> 00:05:59.939

00:05:57.129 --> 00:06:02.589
 the manga but please increase your

 opinions comment your opinions of what 

00:06:02.589 --> 00:06:06.939
 that I already told you because there are many people 

00:06:04.839 --> 00:06:09.099
 that leaves the subject a bit and starts to 

00:06:06.939 --> 00:06:11.379
 say meaningless things thinking that 

00:06:09.099 --> 00:06:12.520
 they have the meaning and not what 

00:06:11.379 --> 00:06:14.319
 they have and well then well practically 

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:16.029
