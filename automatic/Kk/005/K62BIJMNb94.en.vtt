me to say a few words at his funeral and
I<00:01:32.409> kind<00:01:33.340> of<00:01:34.290> wasn't<00:01:35.290> really<00:01:35.680> up<00:01:35.800> to<00:01:36.010> it<00:01:36.040> I<00:01:36.370> kind

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:37.180 
I kind of wasn't really up to it I kind

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.880 
I kind of wasn't really up to it I kind
of<00:01:37.240> jammed<00:01:37.510> out<00:01:37.980> and

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
of jammed out and

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.520 
of jammed out and
and<00:01:41.310> it's<00:01:41.460> thought<00:01:41.760> that<00:01:41.790> was<00:01:42.060> frequently

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
and it's thought that was frequently

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:49.340 
and it's thought that was frequently
that<00:01:43.530> I<00:01:45.590> thought<00:01:46.590> I<00:01:46.680> didn't<00:01:46.980> do<00:01:47.100> that<00:01:48.260> but<00:01:49.260> I

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
that I thought I didn't do that but I

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.150 
that I thought I didn't do that but I
thinking<00:01:49.770> I<00:01:50.040> can't<00:01:50.700> have<00:01:50.790> spent<00:01:51.090> a<00:01:51.270> few<00:01:51.480> days

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:52.160 
thinking I can't have spent a few days

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.890 
thinking I can't have spent a few days
getting<00:01:53.160> some<00:01:53.460> ideas<00:01:53.850> together<00:01:54.060> and<00:01:54.330> I<00:01:54.570> wrote

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:54.900 
getting some ideas together and I wrote

00:01:54.900 --> 00:02:01.390 
getting some ideas together and I wrote
some<00:01:54.930> of<00:01:55.260> those<00:01:55.350> thoughts<00:01:56.070> down<00:01:56.370> and<00:02:00.170> and

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:01.400 
some of those thoughts down and and

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:06.100 
some of those thoughts down and and
eventually<00:02:02.400> after<00:02:03.380> after<00:02:04.380> a<00:02:04.410> while<00:02:04.620> I

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
eventually after after a while I

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.669 
eventually after after a while I
gathered<00:02:07.110> up<00:02:07.260> those<00:02:07.470> pieces<00:02:07.740> of<00:02:08.040> paper<00:02:08.070> and

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 
gathered up those pieces of paper and

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:12.110 
gathered up those pieces of paper and
and<00:02:10.679> then<00:02:10.800> I<00:02:10.830> started<00:02:11.190> to<00:02:11.310> organize<00:02:11.760> it<00:02:11.970> into

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
and then I started to organize it into

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.210 
and then I started to organize it into
the<00:02:12.660> bigger<00:02:12.840> story<00:02:15.560> and<00:02:16.560> then<00:02:16.709> it<00:02:16.830> just<00:02:16.950> became

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
the bigger story and then it just became

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.180 
the bigger story and then it just became
this<00:02:17.400> book<00:02:17.610> you<00:02:18.180> know<00:02:18.330> once<00:02:18.989> I<00:02:19.350> started

working<00:02:20.250> on<00:02:20.700> it<00:02:20.760> then<00:02:21.750> it<00:02:22.620> just<00:02:22.890> didn't<00:02:23.160> stop

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
working on it then it just didn't stop

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:28.729 
working on it then it just didn't stop
and<00:02:26.360> it'll<00:02:27.360> be<00:02:27.540> almost<00:02:27.750> a<00:02:28.020> year<00:02:28.260> that<00:02:28.680> I

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:28.660 
for me like the the ultimate you know
the<00:03:26.630> ultimate<00:03:27.080> goal<00:03:27.410> is<00:03:27.860> to<00:03:28.160> make<00:03:28.310> a<00:03:28.340> short

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:28.670 
the ultimate goal is to make a short

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:32.110 
the ultimate goal is to make a short
film<00:03:28.910> and<00:03:29.090> the<00:03:29.990> book<00:03:30.020> is<00:03:30.490> kind<00:03:31.490> of<00:03:31.670> reflects

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
film and the book is kind of reflects

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.130 
film and the book is kind of reflects
one<00:03:32.540> part<00:03:32.840> of<00:03:32.990> the<00:03:33.140> of<00:03:34.100> the<00:03:34.790> of<00:03:35.030> the<00:03:35.240> animation

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:36.140 
one part of the of the of the animation

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:40.650 
one part of the of the of the animation
process<00:03:37.360> but<00:03:38.360> the<00:03:38.480> two<00:03:38.690> should<00:03:39.070> you<00:03:40.070> know<00:03:40.190> I'm

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:40.660 
process but the two should you know I'm

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:42.699 
process but the two should you know I'm
always<00:03:41.660> interested<00:03:41.930> in<00:03:42.200> this<00:03:42.320> kind<00:03:42.560> of

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:42.709 
always interested in this kind of

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:47.020 
always interested in this kind of
interchange<00:03:43.670> between<00:03:44.570> the<00:03:45.430> book<00:03:46.430> and<00:03:46.459> the

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.030 
interchange between the book and the

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:57.400 
interchange between the book and the
film<00:03:55.330> you<00:03:56.330> know<00:03:56.360> that<00:03:56.570> middle<00:03:56.810> ground<00:03:57.080> between

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:57.410 
film you know that middle ground between

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:06.960 
film you know that middle ground between
those<00:03:57.740> two<00:03:57.950> things

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:06.970 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:09.780 

it's<00:04:07.970> a<00:04:08.060> lot<00:04:08.240> easier<00:04:08.270> than<00:04:08.690> you<00:04:08.750> an<00:04:08.930> animation

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:09.790 
it's a lot easier than you an animation

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:14.110 
it's a lot easier than you an animation
but<00:04:11.860> you<00:04:12.860> know<00:04:12.950> this<00:04:13.160> room<00:04:13.430> I'm<00:04:13.760> trying<00:04:14.060> to
