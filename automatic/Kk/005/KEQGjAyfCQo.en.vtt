more further up and I really like to
where<00:02:35.540> that<00:02:35.720> was<00:02:35.930> going<00:02:36.020> to<00:02:36.530> so<00:02:36.830> I<00:02:36.860> kind<00:02:37.160> of

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
where that was going to so I kind of

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.490 
where that was going to so I kind of
went<00:02:37.370> up<00:02:37.670> and<00:02:38.030> up<00:02:38.390> and<00:02:38.660> up<00:02:38.810> and<00:02:39.050> then<00:02:39.230> I<00:02:39.260> just

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
went up and up and up and then I just

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.010 
went up and up and up and then I just
started<00:02:39.830> feathering<00:02:40.220> some<00:02:41.000> strokes<00:02:41.480> of<00:02:41.720> red

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:42.020 
started feathering some strokes of red

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:44.500 
started feathering some strokes of red
in<00:02:42.260> and<00:02:42.680> I<00:02:43.190> kind<00:02:43.400> of<00:02:43.430> just<00:02:43.640> played<00:02:44.060> with<00:02:44.300> it

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
in and I kind of just played with it

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:50.710 
in and I kind of just played with it
really

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.830 

so<00:02:51.260> just<00:02:51.620> lightly<00:02:52.040> flicking<00:02:52.820> the<00:02:52.970> red<00:02:53.240> up<00:02:53.450> and

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
so just lightly flicking the red up and

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.470 
so just lightly flicking the red up and
giving<00:02:54.290> it<00:02:54.410> really<00:02:54.740> nice<00:02:54.920> pain<00:02:55.370> strokes<00:02:55.880> as<00:02:56.210> if

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
giving it really nice pain strokes as if

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:05.400 
giving it really nice pain strokes as if
I<00:02:56.600> really<00:02:56.900> have<00:02:57.080> lived<00:02:57.530> in<00:02:57.770> that<00:02:57.980> red<00:02:58.220> for<00:02:58.520> days

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:08.250 

for<00:03:06.070> the<00:03:06.190> lower<00:03:06.400> lashline<00:03:07.030> I'm<00:03:07.300> also<00:03:07.810> taking

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
for the lower lashline I'm also taking

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.650 
for the lower lashline I'm also taking
that<00:03:08.470> read<00:03:08.860> again<00:03:09.130> and<00:03:09.400> the<00:03:09.790> lowest<00:03:10.150> person

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
that read again and the lowest person

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.650 
that read again and the lowest person
you<00:03:10.750> want<00:03:10.930> to<00:03:10.990> be<00:03:11.110> on<00:03:11.290> the<00:03:11.620> sides<00:03:12.040> of<00:03:12.280> your<00:03:12.340> eyes

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
you want to be on the sides of your eyes

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.090 
you want to be on the sides of your eyes
so<00:03:13.660> the<00:03:13.870> lowest<00:03:14.050> portion<00:03:14.350> is<00:03:14.740> going<00:03:14.950> to<00:03:15.010> be

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:15.100 
so the lowest portion is going to be

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:16.410 
so the lowest portion is going to be
sort<00:03:15.370> of<00:03:15.460> where<00:03:15.640> you<00:03:15.760> normally<00:03:16.270> would

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
sort of where you normally would

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.410 
sort of where you normally would
highlight<00:03:16.990> and<00:03:17.410> just<00:03:17.440> make<00:03:18.220> it<00:03:18.340> really<00:03:18.520> lived

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.420 
highlight and just make it really lived

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.840 
highlight and just make it really lived
in<00:03:19.720> and<00:03:19.960> sunk<00:03:20.290> in<00:03:20.560> and<00:03:20.830> just<00:03:21.010> really<00:03:21.610> bad

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:21.850 
in and sunk in and just really bad

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:26.280 
in and sunk in and just really bad
really

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.979
