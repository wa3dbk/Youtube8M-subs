00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
thing I like about this is a little bit

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.679 
thing I like about this is a little bit
thinner<00:01:22.320> I<00:01:22.590> feel<00:01:23.159> like<00:01:23.280> this<00:01:23.549> protection<00:01:24.360> here

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
thinner I feel like this protection here

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.300 
thinner I feel like this protection here
is<00:01:24.750> a<00:01:24.780> little<00:01:25.080> over<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.500> top<00:01:25.530> and<00:01:25.950> probably

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
is a little over the top and probably

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.819 
is a little over the top and probably
not<00:01:26.549> necessary<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:27.659> thing<00:01:27.900> with<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.380> ipod

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
not necessary the thing with the ipod

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.890 
not necessary the thing with the ipod
touch<00:01:29.100> is<00:01:29.130> it's<00:01:29.490> so<00:01:29.700> light<00:01:30.000> so<00:01:30.030> that<00:01:30.360> even<00:01:30.810> if

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
touch is it's so light so that even if

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.810 
touch is it's so light so that even if
it<00:01:31.049> does<00:01:31.229> drop<00:01:31.560> it's<00:01:31.799> not<00:01:32.009> going<00:01:32.610> to<00:01:32.729> be

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
it does drop it's not going to be

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.670 
it does drop it's not going to be
hitting<00:01:33.090> real<00:01:33.540> hard<00:01:33.810> it's<00:01:34.049> not<00:01:34.140> like<00:01:34.470> you're

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
hitting real hard it's not like you're

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.910 
hitting real hard it's not like you're
dropping<00:01:35.070> a<00:01:35.159> macbook<00:01:35.640> or<00:01:35.880> an<00:01:36.090> ipad<00:01:36.780> it's<00:01:37.680> so

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
dropping a macbook or an ipad it's so

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.190 
dropping a macbook or an ipad it's so
light<00:01:38.159> that<00:01:38.189> it's<00:01:38.520> really<00:01:38.729> i<00:01:39.090> feel<00:01:39.900> like<00:01:40.020> this

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
light that it's really i feel like this

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.560 
light that it's really i feel like this
is<00:01:40.380> a<00:01:40.409> little<00:01:40.740> bit<00:01:40.860> of<00:01:40.979> overkill<00:01:41.310> sure<00:01:42.210> if<00:01:42.420> you

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
is a little bit of overkill sure if you

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.210 
is a little bit of overkill sure if you
feel<00:01:42.780> like<00:01:42.810> you<00:01:43.110> really<00:01:43.140> need<00:01:43.619> it<00:01:43.770> this<00:01:43.950> could

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
feel like you really need it this could

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.700 
feel like you really need it this could
be<00:01:44.399> a<00:01:44.430> good<00:01:44.610> option<00:01:45.079> but<00:01:46.079> the<00:01:46.200> grip<00:01:46.350> covers

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
be a good option but the grip covers

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.170 
be a good option but the grip covers
nice<00:01:46.890> that<00:01:47.189> it<00:01:47.280> has<00:01:47.430> these<00:01:47.640> little<00:01:47.850> grip

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
nice that it has these little grip

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.050 
nice that it has these little grip
designs<00:01:49.140> on<00:01:49.350> the<00:01:49.470> back<00:01:49.649> it<00:01:49.890> isn't<00:01:50.490> so<00:01:50.670> thick

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
designs on the back it isn't so thick

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.249 
designs on the back it isn't so thick
and<00:01:51.500> just<00:01:52.500> feel<00:01:52.680> like<00:01:52.860> the<00:01:53.450> fit<00:01:54.450> there<00:01:55.110> you<00:01:55.200> can

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
and just feel like the fit there you can

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.499 
and just feel like the fit there you can
see<00:01:55.409> this<00:01:55.770> case<00:01:56.040> is<00:01:56.250> much<00:01:56.460> more<00:01:56.729> squared<00:01:57.270> out

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
see this case is much more squared out

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.289 
see this case is much more squared out
and<00:01:57.920> bulkier<00:01:58.920> so<00:01:59.640> really<00:01:59.850> it's<00:02:00.060> kind<00:02:00.210> of

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
and bulkier so really it's kind of

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:01.520 
and bulkier so really it's kind of
whatever<00:02:00.570> you're<00:02:00.659> looking<00:02:00.719> for<00:02:00.930> like<00:02:01.290> I<00:02:01.380> say
