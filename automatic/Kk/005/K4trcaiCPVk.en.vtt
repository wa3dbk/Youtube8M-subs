then there's this push button piece here

00:01:13.109 --> 00:01:16.099 
then there's this push button piece here
this<00:01:13.380> is<00:01:13.499> just<00:01:13.649> like<00:01:13.920> am<00:01:14.719> what<00:01:15.719> I<00:01:15.749> don't<00:01:15.960> what

twist it and then you can pull out the

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.630 
twist it and then you can pull out the
rest<00:01:21.299> of<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.479> way<00:01:21.600> it<00:01:21.990> should<00:01:22.049> come<00:01:22.579> right<00:01:23.579> out

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
just like that that will release this

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:28.700 
just like that that will release this
trim<00:01:27.600> piece<00:01:27.780> now<00:01:27.990> it<00:01:28.140> says<00:01:28.319> in<00:01:28.469> the<00:01:28.530> manual

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
there's two of them ones at the very top

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.719 
there's two of them ones at the very top
they're<00:02:06.779> kind<00:02:06.959> of<00:02:07.020> hard<00:02:07.139> to<00:02:07.170> get<00:02:07.319> to<00:02:07.380> but<00:02:07.740> you

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
they're kind of hard to get to but you

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.780 
they're kind of hard to get to but you

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
know I just basically hold back on this

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.120 
know I just basically hold back on this
piece<00:02:12.090> pulled<00:02:12.810> back<00:02:12.990> on<00:02:13.020> this<00:02:13.260> carpet<00:02:13.800> piece

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
piece pulled back on this carpet piece

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.640 
piece pulled back on this carpet piece
and<00:02:14.370> then<00:02:14.490> just<00:02:14.840> reached<00:02:15.840> up<00:02:16.020> in<00:02:16.200> here<00:02:16.470> and

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
and then just reached up in here and

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.809 
and then just reached up in here and
grabbed<00:02:17.459> it<00:02:17.670> now<00:02:18.150> if<00:02:18.390> they<00:02:18.420> do<00:02:18.599> happen<00:02:18.810> to<00:02:19.019> fall

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:19.819 
grabbed it now if they do happen to fall

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:22.280 
grabbed it now if they do happen to fall
when<00:02:20.819> you're<00:02:20.970> unscrewing<00:02:21.659> them<00:02:21.870> don't<00:02:22.080> worry

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
when you're unscrewing them don't worry

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.730 
when you're unscrewing them don't worry

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:27.830 
here so you'll have to worry about them
getting<00:02:26.400> stuck<00:02:26.820> inside<00:02:26.970> the<00:02:27.210> car<00:02:27.390> the<00:02:27.570> bumper

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
getting stuck inside the car the bumper

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:33.680 
getting stuck inside the car the bumper
or<00:02:27.930> anything<00:02:28.080> else<00:02:28.320> like<00:02:28.470> that<00:02:31.790> so<00:02:32.790> that<00:02:33.000> well

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
or anything else like that so that well

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.320 
or anything else like that so that well
then<00:02:33.810> release<00:02:34.220> the<00:02:35.220> brake<00:02:35.430> lamp<00:02:35.610> just<00:02:36.180> like

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
then release the brake lamp just like

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.810 
then release the brake lamp just like
that<00:02:36.540> and<00:02:37.440> again<00:02:37.710> I<00:02:37.980> have<00:02:38.310> an<00:02:38.460> aftermarket

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
that and again I have an aftermarket

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:42.080 
that and again I have an aftermarket
brake<00:02:39.510> assembly<00:02:40.170> so<00:02:40.560> yours<00:02:41.490> may<00:02:41.700> be<00:02:41.760> a<00:02:41.850> bit

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
brake assembly so yours may be a bit

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.950 
brake assembly so yours may be a bit
different<00:02:42.270> but<00:02:42.570> essentially<00:02:43.290> you<00:02:43.920> just<00:02:44.960> twist

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:45.960 
different but essentially you just twist

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:51.800 
different but essentially you just twist
these<00:02:46.470> two<00:02:46.770> bulbs<00:02:49.130> counterclockwise<00:02:50.810> these

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
these two bulbs counterclockwise these

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.260 
these two bulbs counterclockwise these
aren't<00:02:51.960> actually<00:02:52.760> involved<00:02:53.760> as<00:02:53.880> you<00:02:53.970> can<00:02:54.090> see

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.270 
aren't actually involved as you can see

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:56.780 
aren't actually involved as you can see
here<00:02:54.480> it's<00:02:54.630> actually<00:02:54.750> LEDs<00:02:55.410> so<00:02:56.190> the<00:02:56.400> circuitry

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
here it's actually LEDs so the circuitry

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:57.920 
here it's actually LEDs so the circuitry
for<00:02:57.000> me<00:02:57.150> I'm<00:02:57.270> just<00:02:57.390> going<00:02:57.570> to<00:02:57.630> have<00:02:57.780> to

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
for me I'm just going to have to

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.320 
for me I'm just going to have to
actually<00:02:58.620> unplug<00:02:59.100> it<00:02:59.280> from<00:02:59.340> this<00:02:59.580> point<00:02:59.880> here

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
actually unplug it from this point here

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.930 
actually unplug it from this point here
but<00:03:00.570> if<00:03:00.840> you<00:03:01.020> did<00:03:01.230> have<00:03:01.440> the<00:03:02.070> standard<00:03:02.460> lamps

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
but if you did have the standard lamps

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.510 
but if you did have the standard lamps
you<00:03:03.120> would<00:03:03.440> just<00:03:04.440> unscrew<00:03:04.830> the<00:03:04.950> bulbs<00:03:05.280> and

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:05.520 
you would just unscrew the bulbs and

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:06.620 
you would just unscrew the bulbs and
then<00:03:05.610> you<00:03:05.730> would<00:03:05.850> take<00:03:06.000> the<00:03:06.120> whole<00:03:06.270> assembly

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
then you would take the whole assembly

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.370 
then you would take the whole assembly
with<00:03:06.780> you<00:03:06.900> so<00:03:07.830> for<00:03:08.370> me<00:03:08.490> it's<00:03:08.610> a<00:03:09.110> little<00:03:10.110> easier

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
with you so for me it's a little easier

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.530 
with you so for me it's a little easier
actually
