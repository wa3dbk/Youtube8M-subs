00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:25.009 

hi<00:00:22.529> guys<00:00:22.769> as<00:00:23.160> you<00:00:23.340> can<00:00:23.460> see<00:00:23.760> i<00:00:24.000> made<00:00:24.480> a<00:00:24.510> random

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
hi guys as you can see i made a random

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.300 
hi guys as you can see i made a random
number<00:00:25.289> generator<00:00:25.710> or<00:00:25.980> RNG<00:00:27.500> that<00:00:28.500> is<00:00:28.650> 4<00:00:28.980> bits

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
number generator or RNG that is 4 bits

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.709 
number generator or RNG that is 4 bits
so<00:00:30.240> you<00:00:30.359> can<00:00:30.599> see<00:00:30.840> 1<00:00:31.650> 2<00:00:31.679> 3<00:00:31.980> 4<00:00:32.369> dispensers<00:00:33.300> and

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
so you can see 1 2 3 4 dispensers and

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.690 
so you can see 1 2 3 4 dispensers and
it's<00:00:34.620> a<00:00:34.770> four<00:00:35.190> digit<00:00:35.880> number<00:00:36.570> as<00:00:36.780> an<00:00:37.170> output

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:37.700 
it's a four digit number as an output

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:42.530 
it's a four digit number as an output
this<00:00:38.700> is<00:00:38.879> 0<00:00:39.210> 1<00:00:39.540> 1<00:00:39.780> 1<00:00:39.809> and<00:00:40.350> there<00:00:41.250> are<00:00:41.670> a<00:00:41.700> total<00:00:42.149> of

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
this is 0 1 1 1 and there are a total of

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.729 
this is 0 1 1 1 and there are a total of
sixteen<00:00:43.230> possible<00:00:45.140> combinations<00:00:46.140> in<00:00:46.620> the

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
sixteen possible combinations in the

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.360 
sixteen possible combinations in the
output<00:00:47.100> so<00:00:47.760> this<00:00:47.910> is<00:00:47.940> really<00:00:48.690> useful<00:00:49.370> for

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
output so this is really useful for

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.279 
output so this is really useful for
larger<00:00:50.850> redstone<00:00:51.800> projects<00:00:52.800> and<00:00:53.930> yeah<00:00:54.930> so

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
larger redstone projects and yeah so

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.380 
larger redstone projects and yeah so
time<00:00:56.039> to<00:00:56.219> show<00:00:56.370> you<00:00:56.430> how<00:00:56.640> to<00:00:56.730> build<00:00:56.910> it<00:00:57.120> it's

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
time to show you how to build it it's

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.470 
time to show you how to build it it's
pretty<00:00:57.660> simple<00:00:58.460> determine<00:00:59.460> how<00:01:00.030> many<00:01:00.090> bits

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
pretty simple determine how many bits

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.420 
pretty simple determine how many bits
you<00:01:00.690> want<00:01:00.930> I'll<00:01:01.469> just<00:01:01.680> make<00:01:01.920> one<00:01:02.129> that's<00:01:02.340> three

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
you want I'll just make one that's three

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.990 
you want I'll just make one that's three
bits<00:01:02.850> so<00:01:03.600> three<00:01:03.870> dispensers<00:01:04.439> spaced<00:01:05.430> out<00:01:05.670> one

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
bits so three dispensers spaced out one

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.890 
bits so three dispensers spaced out one
air<00:01:06.360> space<00:01:06.990> between<00:01:07.380> each<00:01:07.680> and<00:01:08.040> then<00:01:08.939> sticky

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
air space between each and then sticky

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.770 
air space between each and then sticky
pistons<00:01:10.320> in<00:01:10.590> front<00:01:10.950> of<00:01:11.040> each<00:01:11.159> dispenser<00:01:11.780> locks

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
pistons in front of each dispenser locks

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.780 
pistons in front of each dispenser locks
in<00:01:12.960> front<00:01:13.200> of<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.380> sticky<00:01:13.740> pistons<00:01:14.250> and<00:01:14.490> then

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
in front of the sticky pistons and then

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.649 
in front of the sticky pistons and then
redstone<00:01:15.330> torches<00:01:15.840> below<00:01:16.380> each<00:01:16.680> block<00:01:17.040> and

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:17.659 
redstone torches below each block and

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:21.920 
redstone torches below each block and
then<00:01:18.659> those<00:01:19.290> lead<00:01:19.770> out<00:01:19.920> to<00:01:19.950> your<00:01:20.310> output<00:01:20.930> you

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
then those lead out to your output you

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.109 
then those lead out to your output you
can<00:01:22.080> just<00:01:22.200> drag<00:01:22.560> out<00:01:22.770> from<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.369> torches<00:01:23.820> and

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
can just drag out from the torches and

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.870 
can just drag out from the torches and
then<00:01:24.450> hook<00:01:24.780> up<00:01:24.960> to<00:01:25.110> whatever<00:01:25.290> you<00:01:25.680> want<00:01:25.920> in<00:01:26.130> my

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
then hook up to whatever you want in my

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.399 
then hook up to whatever you want in my
case<00:01:27.110> just<00:01:28.110> redstone<00:01:28.680> lamps<00:01:30.079> so<00:01:31.079> once<00:01:31.259> that's

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
case just redstone lamps so once that's

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.730 
case just redstone lamps so once that's
done<00:01:31.799> surround<00:01:32.579> this<00:01:33.570> little<00:01:33.930> pocket<00:01:34.170> with

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
done surround this little pocket with

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.390 
done surround this little pocket with
blocks<00:01:35.960> making<00:01:36.960> sure<00:01:36.990> to<00:01:37.439> leave<00:01:37.650> a<00:01:37.680> space<00:01:38.100> at

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
blocks making sure to leave a space at

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:45.710 
blocks making sure to leave a space at
the<00:01:38.520> end<00:01:38.759> just<00:01:40.850> like<00:01:41.850> this<00:01:42.409> and<00:01:44.210> then<00:01:45.210> fill<00:01:45.540> in

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
the end just like this and then fill in

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:51.670 
the end just like this and then fill in
the<00:01:46.170> air<00:01:46.320> with<00:01:46.950> water<00:01:48.560> okay<00:01:49.560> so<00:01:49.890> solid<00:01:50.369> water

then<00:01:53.390> at<00:01:54.860> the<00:01:55.860> end<00:01:55.890> point<00:01:56.369> put<00:01:56.790> a<00:01:56.820> torch<00:01:57.619> block

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
then at the end point put a torch block

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.179 
then at the end point put a torch block
on<00:01:58.829> top<00:01:58.860> and<00:01:59.430> then<00:01:59.700> extend<00:02:00.000> a<00:02:00.270> redstone<00:02:00.600> line

pistons with redstone torches above
above<00:02:08.009> each<00:02:08.640> dispenser<00:02:09.440> okay<00:02:11.270> hook<00:02:12.270> up<00:02:12.450> your

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
above each dispenser okay hook up your

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.730 
above each dispenser okay hook up your
input<00:02:13.140> to<00:02:13.379> this

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
input to this

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:21.800 
input to this
torch<00:02:13.890> and<00:02:15.350> test<00:02:16.350> it<00:02:16.560> up<00:02:18.800> right<00:02:20.090> okay<00:02:21.090> so<00:02:21.780> I
