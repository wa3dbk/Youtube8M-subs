00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:08.790
 yesterday to enjoy today along 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.790
 spirit we would want sleeves to cook it 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.139
 this wonderful oriental sweetness and 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:15.509
 Believe you have it turned out only with 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.119
 the second time and yesterday it turned out 100 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.550
 percent before we did we did not 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.080
 it turned out absolutely 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:27.029
 because we didnâ€™t say it specifically 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:29.010
 and taking into account the mistakes yesterday everything turned out 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:32.910
 it turned out very well turned out 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:35.219
 delicious i was even some point 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.190
 surprised what happened both like 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:41.489
 the store is even better but slightly possible 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.710
 no pressure is possible somewhere in the factory 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.489
 they do a little bit longer 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.180
 carpenters 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:50.449
 as sushi is young but in general everything is very 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.610
 delicious, I recommend you to cook 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:56.160
 try and be as pleased as 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.750
 we are singing for making Turkish delight out 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.000
 the main ingredients we need 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.609
 of course sugar is of course starch in 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.229
 In our case, this is not a potato 

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:05.880
 preferably corn course 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.189
 water but unfortunately it did not fit 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.380
 at the table half a teaspoon of lemon 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:13.110
 acids and today we decided to try 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.670
 add a pinch of vanillin but it's in the very 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.850
 late though it is optional 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:21.210
 ingredient from helping other inventory 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:24.450
 deeper cooking pot 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.310
 utensils on for boiling Turkish delight of course 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.080
 same spoon so this whole body get in the way and 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.640
 thermometer 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.650
 Let's start with the fact that ridiculous lemon sugar 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.329
 acid with water we will substitute syrup cooks 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.130
 and at this time we prepare starch 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.909
 worth it fill it with water and let him wait 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.100
 your finest hour 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.320
 we cook the syrup before the test for solid 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.930
 the ball in other words it is 130 degrees u 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.810
 we are still 126 and growing at this time. 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.549
 just the same at 100 25-26 degrees on 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.420
 start cooking starch it makes for 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:52.829
 so that syrup is ready 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.049
 now pour the starch with syrup and 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.369
 knead until homogeneous mass this thing 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.530
 not so simple therefore 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.540
 use the helper and boil down 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.170
 Turkish delight to woodstock vegetables consistency then 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.270
 eat for a year 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.310
 it takes about 40 minutes 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.200
 possible to particularly want to bow 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.090
 turned out more solid as a store 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:19.620
 by the way do not forget it constantly 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:21.360
 stir not to burn a bow to you 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.010
 need to be sprinkled with something as 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:27.080
 powdered powdered sugar 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.080
 funny fear small one to one 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:33.860
 mix the powder and mix the starch 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.860
 all the dressing is ready 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:18.790
 on pharmacy 11 real cube only 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:24.760
 a little bit of perspective fragrance 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:24.760
 unique image of the present 11 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:44.570
 yesterday on the zombie tour but as long as there 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:50.210
 ran because the hardest part is 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:04:07.520
 run away and to not burnt well no 

00:03:50.210 --> 00:04:11.090
 neither 42 models I have 3000 and 5000 m. 

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:17.930
 we shoot it that way too, and stage 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:21.130
 correctly start very tasty champing 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:21.130
 talk cocaine gorgeous 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:38.449
 responsibly 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:42.260
 like real and cheaper times all for 

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:46.340
 hour of your time behind the stove 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:46.340
 some sugar some starch 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:54.229
 tip and a little such comment on 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:56.760
 lastly maybe what are I 

00:04:54.229 --> 00:04:59.039
 I wondered how I was preparing well 

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:03.210
 missed two recipes in the first recipe 

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:06.120
 it is figuratively speaking that everything is mixed and 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:08.250
 boiled down to a thick consistency in 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:09.840
 the second option is how we cooked 

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:12.389
 initially boil jelly 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:17.550
 and cook separately syrup mix everything and 

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:19.440
 boiled down also to a thick state in 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:23.070
 the second way I found a big 

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:24.930
 advantage of this time saving 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:27.389
 Overall, we did not save time, but we 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:29.700
 saved time by stirring and we 

00:05:27.389 --> 00:05:32.250
 rid their hands of the set 

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:35.310
 painful corns while you interfere 

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:39.080
 Ashdol's thick mixture is needed so that it does not 

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:41.370
 burned it took us 40 minutes 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:45.349
 although it was still a little and 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:47.789
 boil 1 you already so much 

00:05:45.349 --> 00:05:50.419
 this is probably such 

00:05:47.789 --> 00:05:52.860
 the main point you can try 

00:05:50.419 --> 00:05:54.810
 in different ways I am some ways 

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:57.060
 met that adds dosushit already 

00:05:54.810 --> 00:06:00.110
 Latina this 

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:04.020
 on for more loosening effect 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:06.240
 the current is not me but the presence of gelatin 

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:07.620
 This as well as generally personal leisure mind because 

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:11.880
 that he is not bad anyway 

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:13.680
 perhaps this is all possible 

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:15.720
 if you have any questions 

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:17.550
 if I have answers to them 

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:21.570
 ask in the comments I will 

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:23.760
 I will answer thanks on the necessary meetings 

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:27.410
 likes subscribe bye 

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:27.410
