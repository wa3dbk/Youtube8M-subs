00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
he's ready to a fight and I'll put a

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.710 
he's ready to a fight and I'll put a
image<00:01:22.500> of<00:01:22.650> a<00:01:22.799> cobra<00:01:23.189> in<00:01:23.400> this<00:01:24.030> position<00:01:24.509> on

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
image of a cobra in this position on

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.240 
image of a cobra in this position on
screen<00:01:25.049> right<00:01:25.229> now<00:01:25.259> he<00:01:25.380> has<00:01:25.590> to<00:01:25.710> also<00:01:25.860> see<00:01:26.070> that

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
screen right now he has to also see that

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.249 
screen right now he has to also see that
the<00:01:27.030> kind<00:01:27.270> of<00:01:27.390> resemblance<00:01:27.720> and<00:01:27.930> why<00:01:28.080> it's

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
the kind of resemblance and why it's

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.170 
the kind of resemblance and why it's
called<00:01:28.470> the<00:01:28.590> Cobra<00:01:29.100> glitch<00:01:29.400> but<00:01:29.939> I<00:01:30.000> mean<00:01:30.090> guys

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
called the Cobra glitch but I mean guys

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.460 
called the Cobra glitch but I mean guys
it's<00:01:30.420> very<00:01:30.479> simple<00:01:30.930> and<00:01:31.140> here<00:01:31.350> is<00:01:31.439> a

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
it's very simple and here is a

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.080 
it's very simple and here is a
first-person<00:01:31.920> view<00:01:32.220> so<00:01:32.820> he's<00:01:32.970> basically

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
first-person view so he's basically

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.580 
first-person view so he's basically
doing<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.509> stinking<00:01:33.840> glitch<00:01:34.020> in<00:01:34.350> a

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
doing the stinking glitch in a

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.260 
doing the stinking glitch in a
stationary<00:01:35.040> position<00:01:35.189> while<00:01:35.640> shooting<00:01:35.939> and

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
stationary position while shooting and

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.609 
stationary position while shooting and
this<00:01:36.659> will<00:01:36.840> make<00:01:36.930> him<00:01:37.079> look<00:01:37.229> like<00:01:37.380> he's<00:01:37.590> a

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
this will make him look like he's a

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.830 
this will make him look like he's a
Cobra<00:01:37.979> ready<00:01:38.159> to<00:01:38.280> attack<00:01:38.549> so<00:01:38.850> it's<00:01:39.570> a<00:01:39.659> very

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
Cobra ready to attack so it's a very

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.359 
Cobra ready to attack so it's a very
easy<00:01:39.869> glitch<00:01:40.320> guys<00:01:40.530> once<00:01:40.860> you<00:01:40.950> get<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.220> hang

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
easy glitch guys once you get the hang

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.580

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
glitch the sneaking glitch then it might

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.030 
glitch the sneaking glitch then it might
be<00:01:45.810> a<00:01:45.840> little<00:01:45.930> bit<00:01:46.140> more<00:01:46.380> difficult<00:01:46.799> for<00:01:46.950> you
