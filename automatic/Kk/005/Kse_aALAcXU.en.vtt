couple<00:00:15.309> videos<00:00:15.459> on<00:00:15.910> how<00:00:16.120> to<00:00:16.289> recrystallize

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:17.289 
couple videos on how to recrystallize

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:21.120 
couple videos on how to recrystallize
them<00:00:18.010> using<00:00:18.520> a<00:00:18.789> an<00:00:19.060> electric<00:00:19.599> skillet<00:00:19.869> and<00:00:20.320> you

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:21.130 
them using a an electric skillet and you

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:25.800 
them using a an electric skillet and you
know<00:00:21.279> I<00:00:22.349> do<00:00:23.349> like<00:00:23.560> the<00:00:23.859> K<00:00:24.279> NSU<00:00:24.760> propellant<00:00:25.330> but

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:25.810 
know I do like the K NSU propellant but

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:28.169 
know I do like the K NSU propellant but
it's<00:00:26.050> really<00:00:26.380> hot<00:00:26.740> when<00:00:27.039> casting<00:00:27.580> it<00:00:27.759> hardens

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:28.179 
it's really hot when casting it hardens

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:29.790 
it's really hot when casting it hardens
really<00:00:28.449> fast<00:00:28.720> and<00:00:29.320> there's<00:00:29.500> a<00:00:29.560> lot<00:00:29.710> of

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:29.800 
really fast and there's a lot of

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.349 
really fast and there's a lot of
properties<00:00:30.189> about<00:00:30.400> it<00:00:30.580> that<00:00:30.789> are<00:00:31.029> not

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:31.359 
properties about it that are not

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:33.740 
properties about it that are not
preferable<00:00:31.599> especially<00:00:32.529> brittleness<00:00:33.070> and

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
preferable especially brittleness and

preferable especially brittleness and
the<00:00:34.750> hydroscopic<00:00:35.640> now<00:00:36.640> I'm<00:00:36.910> I'm<00:00:37.240> gonna<00:00:37.590> show

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:38.590 
the hydroscopic now I'm I'm gonna show

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:41.850 
the hydroscopic now I'm I'm gonna show
you<00:00:38.650> a<00:00:39.070> propellant<00:00:39.550> that<00:00:39.730> is<00:00:40.060> not<00:00:40.570> as<00:00:40.860> brittle

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:41.860 
you a propellant that is not as brittle

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.530 
you a propellant that is not as brittle
and<00:00:42.100> is<00:00:42.970> not<00:00:43.210> doesn't<00:00:43.780> need<00:00:43.900> to<00:00:43.990> be<00:00:44.080> as<00:00:44.230> hot<00:00:44.590> to

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:45.540 
and is not doesn't need to be as hot to

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:49.730 
and is not doesn't need to be as hot to
form<00:00:46.540> it<00:00:46.690> the<00:00:47.550> potassium<00:00:48.550> nitrate<00:00:49.270> and

brittle it does not require any water in

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:02.880 
brittle it does not require any water in
the<00:00:59.950> process<00:01:00.400> of<00:01:00.520> making<00:01:00.730> it<00:01:01.060> actually<00:01:01.890> all

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:02.890 
the process of making it actually all

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:05.160 
the process of making it actually all
you<00:01:03.310> do<00:01:03.430> is<00:01:03.580> melt<00:01:03.850> the<00:01:04.030> sorbitol<00:01:04.510> and<00:01:04.570> add<00:01:04.960> in

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.170 
you do is melt the sorbitol and add in

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.380 
you do is melt the sorbitol and add in
the<00:01:05.379> potassium<00:01:05.799> nitrate<00:01:06.369> weigh<00:01:07.180> out<00:01:07.360> your

just<00:01:26.679> that<00:01:26.799> amount<00:01:27.009> it's<00:01:27.219> really<00:01:27.520> not<00:01:27.880> even

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.030 
just that amount it's really not even

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.880 
just that amount it's really not even
them<00:01:28.240> that<00:01:28.390> way<00:01:29.170> able<00:01:29.409> now<00:01:29.939> and<00:01:31.590> just<00:01:32.590> in<00:01:32.710> real

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 
them that way able now and just in real

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.929 
them that way able now and just in real
well<00:01:34.710> you're<00:01:35.710> gonna<00:01:35.829> get<00:01:36.130> it's<00:01:36.429> just<00:01:36.700> a<00:01:36.789> little

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:36.939 
well you're gonna get it's just a little

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:42.059 
well you're gonna get it's just a little
pinkish<00:01:37.719> powder<00:01:40.049> it<00:01:41.049> took<00:01:41.229> the<00:01:41.319> sorbitol<00:01:41.740> from

00:01:42.059 --> 00:01:42.069 
pinkish powder it took the sorbitol from

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:44.489 
pinkish powder it took the sorbitol from
the<00:01:42.249> and<00:01:43.030> I<00:01:43.749> put<00:01:43.929> it<00:01:44.020> in<00:01:44.140> here<00:01:44.259> with<00:01:44.380> the

00:01:44.489 --> 00:01:44.499 
the and I put it in here with the

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:46.260 
the and I put it in here with the
potassium<00:01:44.710> nitrate<00:01:45.249> there's<00:01:45.850> no<00:01:45.969> problem

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:46.270 
potassium nitrate there's no problem

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.870 
potassium nitrate there's no problem
doing<00:01:46.450> it<00:01:46.509> this<00:01:46.659> way<00:01:46.889> just<00:01:47.889> mix<00:01:48.340> it<00:01:48.520> all<00:01:48.609> in

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
doing it this way just mix it all in

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.879 
doing it this way just mix it all in
real<00:01:49.119> nice<00:01:49.329> before<00:01:50.229> you<00:01:50.289> pour<00:01:50.469> it<00:01:50.560> down<00:01:50.710> onto

00:01:50.879 --> 00:01:50.889 
real nice before you pour it down onto

00:01:50.889 --> 00:01:51.660 
real nice before you pour it down onto
the<00:01:51.009> skillet

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
the skillet

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.910 
the skillet
okay<00:01:52.299> the<00:01:52.450> skillet<00:01:52.719> is<00:01:52.869> up<00:01:53.049> to<00:01:53.229> heat<00:01:53.469> so<00:01:53.770> I'm

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:53.920 
okay the skillet is up to heat so I'm

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.399 
okay the skillet is up to heat so I'm
gonna<00:01:54.009> go<00:01:54.219> ahead<00:01:54.399> and<00:01:54.520> put<00:01:55.270> on<00:01:55.479> my<00:01:56.020> first

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:56.409 
gonna go ahead and put on my first

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:00.630 
gonna go ahead and put on my first
amount

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:06.530 

that

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:27.830 

turn<00:02:07.540> it<00:02:07.660> down

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:41.400 

just<00:02:28.349> like<00:02:28.470> this<00:02:29.720> nice<00:02:30.720> and<00:02:30.930> easy

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:46.600 

so<00:02:42.410> basically<00:02:43.390> what<00:02:44.390> I'm<00:02:44.510> doing<00:02:44.930> is<00:02:45.650> is<00:02:46.069> I'm

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
so basically what I'm doing is is I'm

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:47.080 
so basically what I'm doing is is I'm
drawing

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
drawing

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:48.850 
drawing
I'm<00:02:47.180> putting<00:02:47.480> the<00:02:47.599> dry<00:02:47.840> mixture<00:02:48.140> down<00:02:48.410> on<00:02:48.650> to

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
I'm putting the dry mixture down on to

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.190 
I'm putting the dry mixture down on to
the<00:02:49.099> hot<00:02:49.370> skillet<00:02:49.640> and<00:02:50.000> letting<00:02:50.629> the<00:02:50.750> skillet

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
the hot skillet and letting the skillet

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.500 
the hot skillet and letting the skillet
heat<00:02:51.739> it<00:02:51.890> to<00:02:52.160> a<00:02:52.489> melting<00:02:53.120> point<00:02:53.299> of<00:02:53.450> the

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
heat it to a melting point of the

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.170 
heat it to a melting point of the
sorbitol<00:02:54.080> and<00:02:54.379> the<00:02:55.040> sorbitol<00:02:55.519> is<00:02:55.730> actually

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
sorbitol and the sorbitol is actually

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.600 
sorbitol and the sorbitol is actually
liquid<00:02:56.450> enough<00:02:56.900> to<00:02:57.739> make<00:02:57.950> the<00:02:58.129> propellant

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
liquid enough to make the propellant

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:02.699 
liquid enough to make the propellant
global<00:03:00.310> horrible<00:03:01.310> actually<00:03:01.730> I<00:03:01.910> meant<00:03:02.360> to<00:03:02.480> say

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709 
global horrible actually I meant to say

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:05.770 
global horrible actually I meant to say
it's<00:03:03.709> actually<00:03:04.250> horrible<00:03:05.120> we<00:03:05.299> can<00:03:05.450> actually

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
it's actually horrible we can actually

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:18.979 
it's actually horrible we can actually
perform<00:03:05.959> this<00:03:06.349> into<00:03:06.920> our<00:03:06.950> cast<00:03:07.310> or<00:03:07.670> two

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:23.330 

at<00:03:19.560> last<00:03:19.739> America<00:03:21.829> we're<00:03:22.829> gonna<00:03:22.950> tie<00:03:23.189> it<00:03:23.250> up

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
at last America we're gonna tie it up

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:28.039 
at last America we're gonna tie it up
just<00:03:23.579> a<00:03:23.640> little<00:03:23.670> bit<00:03:26.450> you<00:03:27.450> see<00:03:27.480> how<00:03:27.750> that<00:03:27.870> works

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:28.049 
just a little bit you see how that works

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:39.310 
just a little bit you see how that works
just<00:03:28.170> like<00:03:28.650> that

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:39.320 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:04:13.900 

now<00:03:41.750> we<00:03:42.750> pour<00:03:43.050> it<00:03:45.440> okay<00:03:46.440> so<00:03:47.190> we<00:03:47.340> unplug<00:03:47.730> it

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:13.910 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:20.360 

no<00:04:14.910> I'm<00:04:15.090> good<00:04:18.470> so<00:04:19.470> I<00:04:19.500> poured<00:04:19.799> it<00:04:19.889> into<00:04:20.070> here

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
no I'm good so I poured it into here

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:21.890 
no I'm good so I poured it into here
let's<00:04:20.670> see<00:04:20.790> if<00:04:20.850> you<00:04:20.940> can<00:04:21.090> see<00:04:21.269> that<00:04:21.419> I<00:04:21.450> hope<00:04:21.720> you

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
let's see if you can see that I hope you

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:25.850 
let's see if you can see that I hope you
can't<00:04:22.139> I<00:04:23.330> poured<00:04:24.330> it<00:04:24.389> into<00:04:24.600> that<00:04:25.500> guy<00:04:25.650> right

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
can't I poured it into that guy right

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:27.129 
can't I poured it into that guy right
there

00:04:27.129 --> 00:04:27.139 
there

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:29.300 
there
the<00:04:28.139> rest<00:04:28.350> of<00:04:28.500> it<00:04:28.590> I'm<00:04:28.680> just<00:04:28.800> gonna<00:04:28.950> go<00:04:29.190> ahead

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
the rest of it I'm just gonna go ahead

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:43.300 
the rest of it I'm just gonna go ahead
and<00:04:29.460> pour<00:04:30.270> into<00:04:30.570> you<00:04:31.350> know<00:04:31.470> something<00:04:31.919> else

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:43.310 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:46.840 

you

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:46.850 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:49.600 

so<00:04:47.180> it<00:04:48.080> actually<00:04:48.590> after<00:04:48.830> the<00:04:48.920> first<00:04:49.130> day<00:04:49.310> it'll

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:49.610 
so it actually after the first day it'll

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:52.570 
so it actually after the first day it'll
be<00:04:49.730> quite<00:04:50.330> solid<00:04:50.540> and<00:04:50.900> then<00:04:51.020> it<00:04:51.650> takes<00:04:51.890> one<00:04:52.430> to

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:52.580 
be quite solid and then it takes one to

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:54.340 
be quite solid and then it takes one to
two<00:04:52.730> days<00:04:52.880> after<00:04:53.210> that<00:04:53.360> to<00:04:53.600> actually<00:04:54.020> get<00:04:54.170> to

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:54.350 
two days after that to actually get to

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:56.650 
two days after that to actually get to
the<00:04:54.470> hard<00:04:54.770> solid<00:04:55.730> rocky<00:04:55.910> fuel<00:04:56.210> state<00:04:56.450> so<00:04:56.600> I'm

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:56.660 
the hard solid rocky fuel state so I'm

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:58.720 
the hard solid rocky fuel state so I'm
going<00:04:56.780> to<00:04:56.810> give<00:04:56.960> you<00:04:57.050> a<00:04:57.080> test<00:04:57.410> but<00:04:58.220> you<00:04:58.520> have<00:04:58.640> to

00:04:58.720 --> 00:04:58.730 
going to give you a test but you have to

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:00.970 
going to give you a test but you have to
keep<00:04:58.850> in<00:04:59.000> mind<00:04:59.120> that<00:04:59.270> this<00:04:59.480> fuel<00:05:00.260> is<00:05:00.440> still<00:05:00.710> in

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:00.980 
keep in mind that this fuel is still in

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:04.870 
keep in mind that this fuel is still in
a<00:05:01.100> liquid<00:05:01.490> not<00:05:02.120> liquid<00:05:02.360> but<00:05:02.570> still<00:05:03.050> in<00:05:03.790> in<00:05:04.790> a

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:04.880 
a liquid not liquid but still in in a

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:06.820 
a liquid not liquid but still in in a
clay-like<00:05:05.240> state

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:06.830 
clay-like state

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:19.700 
clay-like state

you

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:43.370 

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:54.780 

it's<00:05:44.370> good<00:05:44.520> for<00:05:44.730> smoke<00:05:44.940> bombs<00:05:45.210> too
