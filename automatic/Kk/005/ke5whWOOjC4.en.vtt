bowl<00:02:26.459> I'm<00:02:26.549> not<00:02:26.700> really<00:02:26.820> sure<00:02:27.060> but<00:02:27.329> they<00:02:27.450> sell

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
it and then people just drink it because

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.069 
it and then people just drink it because
they<00:02:29.910> don't<00:02:30.060> have<00:02:30.209> time<00:02:30.450> to<00:02:30.510> drink<00:02:30.870> like

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:31.079

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
medicine and things like that or make it

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.460 
medicine and things like that or make it
because<00:02:33.420> it<00:02:33.510> takes<00:02:33.690> a<00:02:33.780> really<00:02:33.930> long<00:02:34.170> time<00:02:34.410> to

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
because it takes a really long time to

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.479

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
here they don't have a Home Depot so

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:46.640
