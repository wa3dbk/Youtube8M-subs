the end don't really actually go to the

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.870 
the end don't really actually go to the
very<00:01:41.729> end<00:01:41.909> you'll<00:01:42.090> see<00:01:42.210> the<00:01:42.299> cards<00:01:42.689> so<00:01:43.470> just

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
very end you'll see the cards so just

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.609 
very end you'll see the cards so just
kind<00:01:44.880> of<00:01:44.909> just<00:01:45.090> go<00:01:45.270> slow<00:01:46.110> down<00:01:46.290> a<00:01:46.320> little<00:01:46.470> bit

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
kind of just go slow down a little bit

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.030 
kind of just go slow down a little bit
and<00:01:46.770> don't<00:01:47.009> really<00:01:47.189> show<00:01:47.310> in<00:01:47.399> the<00:01:47.490> back<00:01:47.640> and

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.040 
and don't really show in the back and

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.330 
and don't really show in the back and
that's<00:01:50.040> we<00:01:50.220> turn<00:01:50.579> it<00:01:50.700> over<00:01:50.820> and<00:01:51.890> you<00:01:52.890> do<00:01:53.310> a

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
that's we turn it over and you do a

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.969 
that's we turn it over and you do a
double<00:01:53.880> lift<00:01:54.119> so<00:01:55.020> a<00:01:55.049> double<00:01:55.409> lift<00:01:55.530> is<00:01:55.740> what<00:01:55.890> it

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
double lift so a double lift is what it

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.280 
double lift so a double lift is what it
sounds<00:01:56.219> like<00:01:56.399> but<00:01:56.700> for<00:01:56.969> you<00:01:57.030> lift<00:01:57.899> up<00:01:58.049> two

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
sounds like but for you lift up two

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.060 
sounds like but for you lift up two
cards<00:01:58.829> so<00:01:59.700> you<00:01:59.729> get<00:02:00.290> first<00:02:01.290> you<00:02:01.469> need<00:02:01.590> a<00:02:01.649> pinkie

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
cards so you get first you need a pinkie

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.649 
cards so you get first you need a pinkie
break<00:02:02.250> for<00:02:02.430> that<00:02:02.579> so<00:02:02.850> pink<00:02:03.090> break<00:02:03.329> makes<00:02:03.570> it

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
break for that so pink break makes it

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:04.999 
break for that so pink break makes it
much<00:02:03.750> more<00:02:03.930> easy<00:02:04.140> for<00:02:04.259> you<00:02:04.469> to<00:02:04.530> just<00:02:04.680> grab<00:02:04.860> the

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
much more easy for you to just grab the

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.230 
much more easy for you to just grab the
two<00:02:05.130> cards<00:02:05.399> you<00:02:05.460> want<00:02:05.640> instead<00:02:05.820> of<00:02:06.000> having<00:02:06.119> to

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
two cards you want instead of having to

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.389 
two cards you want instead of having to
you<00:02:06.780> know<00:02:06.810> tamper<00:02:07.590> with<00:02:07.680> it<00:02:07.740> a<00:02:07.890> lot<00:02:08.069> and<00:02:08.160> stuff

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
you know tamper with it a lot and stuff

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.410 
you know tamper with it a lot and stuff
so<00:02:09.259> you<00:02:10.259> can<00:02:10.410> do<00:02:10.500> a<00:02:10.530> pinkie<00:02:10.619> break<00:02:11.099> lift<00:02:12.030> up<00:02:12.180> two

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
so you can do a pinkie break lift up two

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.490 
so you can do a pinkie break lift up two
cards

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
cards

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.680 
cards
so<00:02:13.590> that<00:02:13.740> will<00:02:13.890> leave<00:02:14.070> the<00:02:14.310> eighth<00:02:14.580> they<00:02:15.510> will

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
so that will leave the eighth they will

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:16.880 
so that will leave the eighth they will
see<00:02:15.840> the<00:02:15.930> ACE<00:02:16.110> and<00:02:16.140> don't<00:02:16.500> think<00:02:16.680> that's<00:02:16.830> the

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
see the ACE and don't think that's the

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.000 
see the ACE and don't think that's the
top<00:02:17.130> part<00:02:17.660> but<00:02:18.660> the<00:02:18.780> wrong<00:02:18.960> that<00:02:19.410> we<00:02:19.590> flip<00:02:19.890> it

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
top part but the wrong that we flip it

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:21.500 
top part but the wrong that we flip it
over<00:02:20.160> then<00:02:20.730> you<00:02:20.850> give<00:02:21.000> them<00:02:21.090> the<00:02:21.120> top<00:02:21.330> card
