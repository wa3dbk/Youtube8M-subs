00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
mother the story itself is just really

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:20.930 
mother the story itself is just really
really<00:02:19.500> touching<00:02:20.069> because<00:02:20.190> you<00:02:20.610> get<00:02:20.730> to<00:02:20.790> see

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
really touching because you get to see

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.650 
really touching because you get to see
so<00:02:21.390> much<00:02:21.540> of<00:02:21.800> devices<00:02:22.800> vulnerability<00:02:23.700> and<00:02:23.940> the

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
so much of devices vulnerability and the

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.020 
so much of devices vulnerability and the
way<00:02:24.840> he<00:02:25.170> thinks<00:02:25.200> about<00:02:25.709> certain<00:02:26.340> things<00:02:26.370> and

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
way he thinks about certain things and

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.750 
way he thinks about certain things and
it's<00:02:27.390> just<00:02:27.750> so<00:02:28.260> refreshing<00:02:28.530> and<00:02:29.069> insightful

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
it's just so refreshing and insightful

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.449 
it's just so refreshing and insightful
and<00:02:30.209> addicting<00:02:31.080> I<00:02:31.319> personally<00:02:32.069> think<00:02:32.220> there's

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
and addicting I personally think there's

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:34.640 
and addicting I personally think there's
a<00:02:32.550> very<00:02:32.880> distinct<00:02:33.750> difference<00:02:34.260> between

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
a very distinct difference between

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.500 
a very distinct difference between

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
of view jess is one of you is more

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.570 
of view jess is one of you is more
choppy<00:02:38.430> and<00:02:38.640> short<00:02:39.269> and<00:02:39.540> a<00:02:40.260> bit<00:02:40.560> dry<00:02:41.010> i<00:02:41.040> think

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
choppy and short and a bit dry i think

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.150 
choppy and short and a bit dry i think
because<00:02:42.060> of<00:02:42.450> the<00:02:42.540> abnegation<00:02:43.170> mindset<00:02:43.980> she

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
because of the abnegation mindset she

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.400 
because of the abnegation mindset she
was<00:02:44.310> raised<00:02:44.549> in<00:02:44.879> Tobias's<00:02:45.810> point<00:02:46.049> of<00:02:46.170> view

was raised in Tobias's point of view

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.430 
was raised in Tobias's point of view
however<00:02:46.769> is<00:02:47.310> more<00:02:47.910> flowing<00:02:48.510> I<00:02:48.840> think<00:02:49.110> and<00:02:49.290> it's

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
however is more flowing I think and it's

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.890 
however is more flowing I think and it's
more<00:02:49.680> emotionally<00:02:50.400> driven<00:02:50.640> it's<00:02:50.970> so<00:02:51.540> great

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
more emotionally driven it's so great

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.580 
more emotionally driven it's so great

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
especially compared to Tristan I thought

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.309 
especially compared to Tristan I thought
some<00:02:57.299> of<00:02:57.360> the<00:02:57.450> most<00:02:57.569> interesting<00:02:58.140> things

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.230 
actually kind of underwhelming but I

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:53.380 
actually kind of underwhelming but I
