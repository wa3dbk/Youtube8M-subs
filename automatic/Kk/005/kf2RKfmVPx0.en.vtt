intake<00:00:41.940> manifold<00:00:42.449> gaskets<00:00:42.960> leaking<00:00:43.050> so<00:00:43.500> we're

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
intake manifold gaskets leaking so we're

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.950 
intake manifold gaskets leaking so we're
gonna<00:00:43.739> check<00:00:44.010> that<00:00:44.280> first<00:00:44.550> so<00:00:45.420> we'll<00:00:45.540> take<00:00:45.720> off

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
gonna check that first so we'll take off

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.130 
gonna check that first so we'll take off
this<00:00:46.110> plastic<00:00:46.320> cover<00:00:47.690> and<00:00:48.690> this<00:00:48.870> is<00:00:49.019> the

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
this plastic cover and this is the

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.410 
this plastic cover and this is the
intake<00:00:49.440> manifold<00:00:49.949> here<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.730> gaskets<00:00:51.270> are

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
intake manifold here the gaskets are

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.150 
intake manifold here the gaskets are
down<00:00:51.600> inside<00:00:52.050> here<00:00:52.350> and<00:00:52.440> they'll<00:00:52.590> often<00:00:52.770> leak

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
down inside here and they'll often leak

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.430 
down inside here and they'll often leak
and<00:00:53.399> here's<00:00:53.579> how<00:00:53.700> to<00:00:53.760> check<00:00:54.059> them<00:00:54.260> just<00:00:55.260> get<00:00:55.410> a

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
and here's how to check them just get a

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.250 
and here's how to check them just get a
can<00:00:55.649> of<00:00:55.680> carburetor<00:00:56.219> spray<00:00:56.579> cleaner<00:00:57.079> and<00:00:58.079> with

can of carburetor spray cleaner and with

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.020 
can of carburetor spray cleaner and with
the<00:00:58.379> engine<00:00:58.739> running<00:00:58.770> spray<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.850> cleaner

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
the engine running spray the cleaner

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.499 
the engine running spray the cleaner
where<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:00.840> gaskets<00:01:01.350> are

00:01:05.499 --> 00:01:05.509 

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:07.749 

and<00:01:06.049> if<00:01:06.170> the<00:01:06.289> engine<00:01:06.649> starts<00:01:07.039> to<00:01:07.100> own<00:01:07.310> a<00:01:07.340> weird

00:01:07.749 --> 00:01:07.759 
and if the engine starts to own a weird

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:10.029 
and if the engine starts to own a weird
go<00:01:07.969> up<00:01:08.180> and<00:01:08.420> down<00:01:08.570> like<00:01:08.899> this<00:01:09.079> one<00:01:09.289> did<00:01:09.530> it

00:01:10.029 --> 00:01:10.039 
go up and down like this one did it

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:11.499 
go up and down like this one did it
means<00:01:10.250> there's<00:01:10.460> a<00:01:10.549> leak<00:01:10.759> and<00:01:10.969> it<00:01:11.060> needs<00:01:11.270> new

00:01:11.499 --> 00:01:11.509 
means there's a leak and it needs new

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:14.499 
means there's a leak and it needs new
intake<00:01:11.899> manifold<00:01:12.380> gaskets<00:01:12.950> they<00:01:13.939> don't<00:01:14.299> cost

00:01:14.499 --> 00:01:14.509 
intake manifold gaskets they don't cost

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:16.209 
intake manifold gaskets they don't cost
much<00:01:14.840> but<00:01:14.869> you<00:01:15.170> gotta<00:01:15.350> take<00:01:15.590> some<00:01:15.619> stuff<00:01:16.009> off

00:01:16.209 --> 00:01:16.219 
much but you gotta take some stuff off

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:17.410 
much but you gotta take some stuff off
so<00:01:16.250> here<00:01:16.789> goes

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
so here goes

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.630 
so here goes
we'll<00:01:18.229> move<00:01:18.380> the<00:01:18.590> wiring<00:01:19.039> home<00:01:19.219> out<00:01:19.429> of<00:01:19.460> the

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:19.640 
we'll move the wiring home out of the

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.990 
we'll move the wiring home out of the
way<00:01:20.829> and<00:01:21.829> pull<00:01:22.069> it<00:01:22.189> up<00:01:22.310> so<00:01:22.520> we<00:01:22.610> can<00:01:22.729> get<00:01:22.789> to<00:01:22.909> the

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000 
way and pull it up so we can get to the

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.480 
way and pull it up so we can get to the
bolts<00:01:23.329> that<00:01:23.420> hold<00:01:23.539> the<00:01:23.659> manifold<00:01:24.200> on<00:01:24.490> then

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:25.490 
bolts that hold the manifold on then

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:26.980 
bolts that hold the manifold on then
we'll<00:01:25.640> get<00:01:25.759> the<00:01:25.850> throttle<00:01:26.299> body<00:01:26.479> out<00:01:26.780> of<00:01:26.810> the

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
we'll get the throttle body out of the

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.940 
we'll get the throttle body out of the
way<00:01:27.170> take<00:01:28.069> the<00:01:28.250> air<00:01:28.369> duct<00:01:28.700> out<00:01:28.909> of<00:01:29.060> the<00:01:29.119> way

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950 
way take the air duct out of the way

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.800 
way take the air duct out of the way
then<00:01:30.950> we<00:01:31.130> on<00:01:31.280> both<00:01:31.549> the<00:01:31.700> throttle<00:01:31.969> body<00:01:32.299> itself

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
then we on both the throttle body itself

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.760 
then we on both the throttle body itself
and<00:01:33.140> move<00:01:33.229> it<00:01:33.439> out<00:01:33.560> of<00:01:33.679> the<00:01:33.740> way<00:01:35.469> then<00:01:36.469> we<00:01:36.590> take

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
and move it out of the way then we take

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.559 
and move it out of the way then we take
all<00:01:36.950> the<00:01:37.100> bolts<00:01:37.399> off<00:01:37.549> to<00:01:37.759> hold<00:01:37.970> the<00:01:38.090> manifold

00:01:38.559 --> 00:01:38.569 
all the bolts off to hold the manifold

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:42.309 
all the bolts off to hold the manifold
in<00:01:38.810> place<00:01:40.630> then<00:01:41.630> whole<00:01:41.810> manifold<00:01:42.289> just

00:01:42.309 --> 00:01:42.319 
in place then whole manifold just

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:47.380 
in place then whole manifold just
Wiggles<00:01:42.950> and<00:01:43.099> comes<00:01:43.280> up<00:01:45.490> and<00:01:46.490> as<00:01:46.610> y'all<00:01:46.849> gasket

covered<00:01:49.069> on<00:01:49.189> oil<00:01:49.490> it's<00:01:50.299> just<00:01:50.479> time<00:01:50.689> for<00:01:50.720> new

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
covered on oil it's just time for new

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.469 
covered on oil it's just time for new
one<00:01:51.259> now<00:01:52.069> the<00:01:52.130> new<00:01:52.340> one<00:01:52.549> only<00:01:52.670> goes<00:01:52.909> on<00:01:53.060> one<00:01:53.119> way

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
one now the new one only goes on one way

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:55.600 
one now the new one only goes on one way
there's<00:01:53.750> tangs<00:01:54.079> and<00:01:54.439> the<00:01:54.500> tangs<00:01:54.770> fit<00:01:55.489> in

little holes that only go one way now

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:00.819 
little holes that only go one way now
when<00:01:59.090> you<00:01:59.179> look<00:01:59.329> at<00:01:59.479> the<00:01:59.569> new<00:01:59.689> gaskets<00:02:00.289> you<00:02:00.649> can

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:00.829 
when you look at the new gaskets you can

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:02.979 
when you look at the new gaskets you can
see<00:02:01.009> they<00:02:01.159> sit<00:02:01.459> much<00:02:01.700> higher<00:02:02.000> the<00:02:02.329> old<00:02:02.479> gaskets

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:02.989 
see they sit much higher the old gaskets

00:02:02.989 --> 00:02:04.929 
see they sit much higher the old gaskets
had<00:02:03.140> gone<00:02:03.319> flush<00:02:03.709> and<00:02:04.250> we're<00:02:04.429> leaking<00:02:04.610> air

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:04.939 
had gone flush and we're leaking air

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:07.120

these<00:02:05.149> high<00:02:05.329> sitting<00:02:05.689> ones<00:02:05.989> will<00:02:06.619> seed<00:02:06.890> and

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
these high sitting ones will seed and

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:08.620
