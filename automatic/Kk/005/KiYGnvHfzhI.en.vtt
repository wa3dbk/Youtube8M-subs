I'm<00:00:50.250> deep<00:00:50.489> point<00:00:50.850> cutting<00:00:51.120> it's<00:00:51.420> great<00:00:51.600> for

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
I'm deep point cutting it's great for

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.720 
I'm deep point cutting it's great for
thick<00:00:52.050> hair<00:00:52.079> because<00:00:52.530> it<00:00:52.680> removes<00:00:52.980> weight<00:00:53.340> but

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
thick hair because it removes weight but

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.459 
thick hair because it removes weight but
it's<00:00:53.850> also<00:00:54.000> great<00:00:54.270> for<00:00:54.329> curly<00:00:54.870> hair<00:00:55.079> because

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
it's also great for curly hair because

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.830 
it's also great for curly hair because
it<00:00:55.770> softens<00:00:56.250> it<00:00:56.430> when<00:00:57.270> you're<00:00:57.390> deep<00:00:57.570> point

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
it softens it when you're deep point

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.209 
it softens it when you're deep point
cutting<00:00:58.170> it<00:00:58.289> creates<00:00:58.559> longer<00:00:58.920> and<00:00:59.039> shorter

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
cutting it creates longer and shorter

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.660 
cutting it creates longer and shorter
pieces<00:01:00.469> if<00:01:01.469> you<00:01:01.620> think<00:01:01.829> about<00:01:02.010> cutting<00:01:02.250> curly

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
pieces if you think about cutting curly

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.700 
pieces if you think about cutting curly
hair<00:01:02.910> bluntly<00:01:03.390> or<00:01:03.629> with<00:01:03.750> a<00:01:03.780> heavy<00:01:04.019> line<00:01:04.290> how

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
hair bluntly or with a heavy line how

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.190 
hair bluntly or with a heavy line how
will<00:01:04.890> its<00:01:05.040> it<00:01:05.339> since<00:01:06.210> curls<00:01:06.510> sit<00:01:06.720> on<00:01:06.810> top<00:01:07.020> of

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
will its it since curls sit on top of

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.620 
will its it since curls sit on top of
each<00:01:07.320> other<00:01:07.500> it<00:01:07.770> will<00:01:07.890> sit<00:01:08.130> quite<00:01:08.400> heavy<00:01:08.670> by

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
each other it will sit quite heavy by

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.359 
each other it will sit quite heavy by
deep<00:01:09.869> point<00:01:10.170> cutting<00:01:10.560> and<00:01:10.740> different

deep point cutting and different

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.490 
deep point cutting and different
techniques<00:01:11.729> of<00:01:11.880> texturizing<00:01:12.479> it<00:01:13.020> will<00:01:13.200> remove

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
techniques of texturizing it will remove

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.039 
techniques of texturizing it will remove
weight<00:01:13.830> and<00:01:14.070> soften<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.610> overall<00:01:14.970> look<00:01:15.240> with

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
weight and soften the overall look with

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.210 
weight and soften the overall look with
the<00:01:16.140> curly<00:01:16.439> hair<00:01:16.650> if<00:01:16.740> there's<00:01:16.950> a<00:01:17.040> piece

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
the curly hair if there's a piece

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.910 
the curly hair if there's a piece
sticking<00:01:17.520> out<00:01:17.790> so<00:01:18.330> be<00:01:18.540> it<00:01:18.689> if<00:01:19.530> you<00:01:19.680> can<00:01:19.799> get

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
sticking out so be it if you can get

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.499 
sticking out so be it if you can get
caught<00:01:20.130> in<00:01:20.159> a<00:01:20.340> wind<00:01:20.520> tunnel<00:01:20.580> it'll<00:01:21.180> still<00:01:21.479> look

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
caught in a wind tunnel it'll still look

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:43.440 
caught in a wind tunnel it'll still look
good

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.460 

these<00:01:44.450> are<00:01:44.600> some<00:01:44.780> of<00:01:44.810> the<00:01:44.900> other<00:01:45.050> techniques

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 
these are some of the other techniques

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.680 
these are some of the other techniques
that<00:01:45.680> I'm<00:01:45.770> talking<00:01:45.980> about<00:01:46.160> texturizing<00:01:46.850> now

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:47.690 
that I'm talking about texturizing now

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:49.390 
that I'm talking about texturizing now
I'm<00:01:47.870> slide<00:01:48.260> cutting<00:01:48.680> the<00:01:48.770> perimeter

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:49.400 
I'm slide cutting the perimeter

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.910 
I'm slide cutting the perimeter
this<00:01:50.180> will<00:01:50.360> create<00:01:50.540> longer<00:01:51.500> and<00:01:51.770> shorter

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
this will create longer and shorter

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.920 
this will create longer and shorter
pieces<00:01:52.310> along<00:01:52.880> the<00:01:53.030> perimeter<00:01:53.450> creating<00:01:53.840> that

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:53.930 
pieces along the perimeter creating that

00:01:53.930 --> 00:02:46.150 
pieces along the perimeter creating that
perfect<00:01:54.200> hockey<00:01:54.620> player<00:01:54.920> hair

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160

on<00:02:47.160> the<00:02:48.090> top<00:02:48.330> a<00:02:48.360> section<00:02:48.930> from<00:02:49.050> ear<00:02:49.350> to<00:02:49.410> ear<00:02:49.530> is

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
on the top a section from ear to ear is

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.400 
on the top a section from ear to ear is
taken<00:02:50.310> the<00:02:50.730> top<00:02:51.000> is<00:02:51.270> connected<00:02:51.750> only<00:02:52.200> in<00:02:52.319> the

taken the top is connected only in the

00:02:52.410 --> 00:03:18.650 
taken the top is connected only in the
back<00:03:16.310> now<00:03:17.310> putting<00:03:17.580> in<00:03:17.700> a<00:03:17.819> center<00:03:18.180> profile
