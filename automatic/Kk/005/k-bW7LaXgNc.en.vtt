00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 Welcome to the first right mob 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.000
 Presentation of the match models will be yours 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.470
 pretty clear for the first kadel 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.210
 Say the golems from the place 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.920
 decided and it should be around today 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.920
 small and big ones go 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.690
 and I would say we catch as always 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.610
 will not be a little smaller so with 

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:29.550
 karls belly but it with the smaller ones 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:31.140
 golems this little golem spawn is 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.460
 at night in the world 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.100
 even in dark places like in one 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.989
 cave or in your house if the no 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.640
 has put facts differently than the 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.960
 big green eyes these no blocks 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.580
 but take the highest tours 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.809
 Throw on you, we'll go then 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:44.760
 short in the game mode and you will 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.860
 to see red, that is to say, he is 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.080
 Attack aggressiveness mode lifts 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.400
 blog on and act on us this grass 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:52.409
 can hurt who would have thought 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:55.530
 we just have to talk to myself and 

00:00:52.409 --> 00:00:57.059
 kill him and he does not hold much 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.250
 is just getting off with three punches 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.780
 Beer man sword then leaves 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.790
 but little experience is missing 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.440
 items the only one maybe 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:05.970
 more interesting the mini golems is that 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.500
 These lift the blocks after one 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.390
 let it be known that they speak 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.490
 making it relatively easy without a win touch 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.740
 blocks like ice grass or something else 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.020
 can drive but now is synonymous 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:20.040
 interesting part and that the big ones 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.030
 aim the big golems I think the one 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.380
 or others of you will be in 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.240
 announcement video have already seen 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.010
 that this possible makes it a bell 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.720
 this will help you and become yours 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:29.640
 do a lot of harm and yours 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.110
 but you have to destroy the world first 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.900
 He is already smiling 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.640
 so i think first we'll look 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.190
 but at times what these monsters into blocks 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.630
 cancel because I think it is 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:41.190
 interesting to know if these monsters 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.480
 your world your house or whatever 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:43.860
 completely destroy whether you have this 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.670
 should exhibit or if you whole times 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.960
 can play with them 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.160
 respawn now just a few 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.050
 different positions which of 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:51.630
 this golems and look something on items 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:55.020
 the normally pick up only with grass 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.470
 and sand and stones will appetite on tnt 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.750
 took 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.730
 but you were standing there like crates 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.410
 let this coal even take glass 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:04.080
 I think you can see that most of them 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:04.620
 poland for the most part from dirt or grass 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.510
 consist 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:08.069
 and now maybe the question how 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:10.019
 cut them apart from you before you 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.560
 me her whole approaching block to head 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:12.599
 to pop 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.760
 that's not so difficult and it is 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:16.290
 easier than it looks like a gold 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.849
 to defeat is not difficult at all 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.440
 for example a diamond sword 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:20.700
 or even an iron sword it still has to 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.860
 not even joking a simple one 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.230
 be a log cabin and skin on these golems 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.760
 depending on how valuable powerful 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.080
 your weapon is or whatever in 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.370
 the hand holds how much the blocks the 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.990
 the Golem has used to you 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.280
 created and which 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:35.320
 difficulty level you have selected 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.720
 then who determines this bean 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:39.490
 fall apart the more force 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.140
 expends and the less force both 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:42.340
 im just in his back has all the more 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.950
 one of the blocks will break 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.360
 impact as seen here though 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.800
 These blocks are gradually found and 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.180
 this blog on the front of it all 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:52.720
 time turns this probably around the 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:54.340
 red is in the air it will hurt 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.880
 take it for it will be an aura color 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.410
 change 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.640
 the normal golem first sam one 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.070
 yellow aura when they create themselves 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.540
 have a blue aura and build 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:03.070
 if you have some deciding one 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.820
 orange on these stones you 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:05.590
 expel 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:07.900
 after the orange aura follows sometime 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.130
 the red and the red are called running around her 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.720
 live because I have everyone now 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:11.920
 Blocks 1 and then explodes and will 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.480
 all possible directions one blocks 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:17.770
 so that you can do a lot 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:19.630
 maybe it takes the damage 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:20.890
 ask what drops these golems differently 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:22.780
 than the million in the dry this 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:24.580
 namely something and something very nice 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.230
 is worth a lot depending on which 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:27.490
 block repetition power is like that 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.470
 this one from a diamond blog 

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:30.670
 drop this blog and one 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.680
 all other blocks from which they made 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:34.989
 are talking to this customer a lot 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:37.630
 earth a little sand and in the end believe 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:38.739
 I am a diamond blog the whole 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:40.420
 I'll demonstrate you again fast 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:43.830
 here in the allgÃ¤u it consists of one 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:43.830
 Diamond block and a lot of earth 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:53.530
 now he explodes here are now the 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:55.150
 blocks and also a someone blog like that 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.950
 there was also something these boys could do 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.750
 make them are pretty annoying opponents 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:00.430
 you have to say because they can yours 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.930
 The whole world even actually disfigures 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:04.120
 more than a war or whatever 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:05.320
 as the next time would already 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.400
 I am happy if we leave the comments 

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:07.450
 write which monster with his 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.950
 should treat next 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:10.150
 if that is not like the golems 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:12.250
 there will be several monsters left 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.930
 there are precipitates because of this 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:15.940
 are also very extensive exactly 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:17.229
 like the horses over there but something like that 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:19.359
 like the deer the bears the 

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:20.830
 wild boars and co are too big 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:22.450
 and does not deserve a complete own 

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:24.550
 video as well as these golems or just those 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:26.229
 a monster did not enumerate 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:27.490
 So then I would say thank you 

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:28.990
 has to watch for I would like 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.759
 I am very happy with a thumbs up 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:32.650
 and even if over the next part of 

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:34.389
 I want to stay abo then you will 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:38.310
 tell her to write until next time 

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:38.310
 or animals and their comments and cici
