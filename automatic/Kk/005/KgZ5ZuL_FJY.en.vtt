 volume and define at the same time 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.970
 we have to select, of course, the 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.640
 appropriate supplements four supplements 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.530
 that mixed together are ideal for 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.960
 achieve on my part and experience 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.400
 these two goals with a diet 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.620
 training of course and rest 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.690
 appropriate these that I have here today and that 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:54.000
 I tell you pay attention right now 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:55.680
 we started with this supplement that I have 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.900
 selected that is part of this 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.600
 muscle definition volume pack 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:02.610
 at the same time that this mtx creatine 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.840
 food creatina power with which 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.910
 we will increase our muscular strength 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.740
 especially during short periods of 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:09.810
 perfect maximum yields for 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.760
 gain muscle volume during our 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.130
 Workouts are 400 grams of 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.800
 creatine mont or hydrates with a 99 for 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:19.140
 100% purity you will have for 40 days 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.600
 approximately I take this creatine 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:24.300
 5 grams before training and others 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.770
 5 just at the end I mix it with juice 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.290
 because it's good to mix them with 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:30.360
 fast absorption carbohydrates because 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.990
 it is much better assimilated by the body 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.450
 and to continue 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:36.270
 gaining muscle mass and especially for 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:39.060
 maintain the volume of muscles that 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:41.430
 we have already worked I have selected from 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:43.770
 of course this same brand of this 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:46.860
 remastered classic mtx brand 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:49.290
 some branched amino acids that without 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:52.500
 they are going to help us metabolize 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:54.480
 much better proteins and everything 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:57.300
 part of this goal of winning 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.610
 volume and also muscle definition at 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.710
 same time are the ceat hardcore 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.780
 which are 120 capsules filled with leucine 

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:05.580
 isoleucine and balin to amino acids 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.290
 most important essentials and that 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.360
 make up almost a third of the 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.880
 muscles of the human body its role is 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.500
 the synthesis of proteins that is 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.750
 very important in addition to the synthesis of 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.730
 glutamine that is also part of 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:21.000
 this bread and that I'm going to present to you 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:23.220
 then I take six capsules right 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.080
 before my training they are going to 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:27.600
 provide fantastic support 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.850
 nitrogen at the muscular level to have 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.040
 much more strength in training and 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:32.890
 of course to maintain the volume 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:36.010
 muscular the worked 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:38.380
 days ago and also of course six 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:40.090
 capsules of these times just at 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:43.000
 finish the daily training that 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:45.640
 that will help me is to better synthesize the 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.580
 glutamine and also the protein that 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:50.680
 I will take at the same time in this objective 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:53.530
 of reaching muscle mass volume 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:56.560
 muscle and definition at the same time 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:59.410
 now it's time to take glutamine 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:01.930
 Also course of this brand me re 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:03.610
 x 500 grams of more abundant lamination 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:05.560
 in the skeletal body we will take it 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:07.750
 after our training mixed with 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:09.160
 the water and ultra filtered of mtx that 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:10.270
 right now I'm going to introduce you and the 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.160
 that I'm going to talk to you about 

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:13.630
 seconds the glutamine forms the cells 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:15.580
 muscles and rebuild the fibers 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:17.169
 muscles so it's your role in the 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:18.970
 development and muscle growth is 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:20.890
 fundamental helps to fill the 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:22.480
 muscle glycogen deposits after 

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:24.460
 our training and together with a 

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:26.440
 minimum amount of carbohydrates is 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:28.690
 function is maximized I recommend it 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:31.540
 of course and it will be easy to fulfill by 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:34.510
 the minimum dose that 100% whey carries 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:37.510
 protein also to put x I have done 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:41.830
 of health is mined two teaspoons of 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:44.980
 next to this super and the supreme protein 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:47.260
 also from mx that I have here and that is 

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:49.240
 one of the fundamental pillars of this 

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:51.820
 Volume pack and mass definition 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:53.140
 muscle at the same time is a protein 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:54.640
 of whey that has the highest 

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:57.610
 biological value of all proteins 

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:59.110
 known and this classic in particular and 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:00.340
 only tied and concentrated ultra filtered 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:03.340
 with a profile of essential amino acids 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:04.840
 and non-essentials that complete it and for 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:06.670
 supposedly without aspartame or fat or 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:08.440

 of amino acids and as I always tell you 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:22.570
 I usually take one gram of protein per 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:24.760
 kilogram of body weight mixed by 

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:26.950
