hey everybody dusty here from Dynojet
research<00:00:11.340> today<00:00:11.820> we're<00:00:11.940> going<00:00:12.059> to<00:00:12.120> show<00:00:12.269> you

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
research today we're going to show you

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.930 
research today we're going to show you
how<00:00:12.480> to<00:00:12.540> install<00:00:12.960> the<00:00:13.410> linear<00:00:13.740> sensor<00:00:14.160> the

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
how to install the linear sensor the

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.820 
how to install the linear sensor the
linear<00:00:15.240> sensor<00:00:15.630> is<00:00:15.750> used<00:00:15.780> on<00:00:16.020> applications

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
linear sensor is used on applications

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.010 
linear sensor is used on applications
that<00:00:17.010> do<00:00:17.190> not<00:00:17.369> have<00:00:17.580> a<00:00:17.609> shift<00:00:18.029> linkage<00:00:18.210> this

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
that do not have a shift linkage this

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.290 
that do not have a shift linkage this
particular<00:00:19.380> bike<00:00:19.710> has<00:00:20.010> a<00:00:20.039> shifter<00:00:20.580> mounted

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
particular bike has a shifter mounted

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.450 
particular bike has a shifter mounted
directly<00:00:21.420> to<00:00:21.779> the<00:00:21.960> shift<00:00:22.199> shaft<00:00:22.410> so<00:00:23.039> therefore

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
directly to the shift shaft so therefore

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.580 
directly to the shift shaft so therefore
we<00:00:23.580> have<00:00:23.670> to<00:00:23.789> use<00:00:23.820> the<00:00:24.750> linear<00:00:24.990> sensor<00:00:25.410> and

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
we have to use the linear sensor and

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.220 
we have to use the linear sensor and
this<00:00:26.130> type<00:00:26.369> of<00:00:26.400> situation<00:00:26.900> so<00:00:27.900> we'll<00:00:28.050> need<00:00:28.170> to

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
this type of situation so we'll need to

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.929 
this type of situation so we'll need to
mount<00:00:28.529> this<00:00:28.710> to<00:00:28.890> the<00:00:28.980> shifter<00:00:29.400> itself<00:00:29.490> and

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
mount this to the shifter itself and

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.749 
mount this to the shifter itself and
somewhere<00:00:30.630> on<00:00:30.779> the<00:00:31.170> chassis<00:00:31.410> of<00:00:31.679> the<00:00:31.800> bike<00:00:31.980> now

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
somewhere on the chassis of the bike now

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.880 
somewhere on the chassis of the bike now
you<00:00:32.820> could<00:00:33.300> drill<00:00:33.660> and<00:00:33.809> tap<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:34.140> frame<00:00:34.410> some

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
you could drill and tap the frame some

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.770 
you could drill and tap the frame some
people<00:00:35.160> don't<00:00:35.340> care<00:00:35.399> for<00:00:35.730> that<00:00:35.790> or<00:00:36.149> you<00:00:36.510> could

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
people don't care for that or you could

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.450 
people don't care for that or you could
use<00:00:37.020> like<00:00:37.230> an<00:00:37.350> adhesive<00:00:37.770> mount<00:00:37.980> that<00:00:38.160> we<00:00:38.280> also

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
use like an adhesive mount that we also

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.420 
use like an adhesive mount that we also
carry<00:00:38.879> this<00:00:39.570> particular<00:00:40.079> application<00:00:40.860> we're

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
carry this particular application we're

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.430 
carry this particular application we're
going<00:00:41.460> to<00:00:41.760> mount<00:00:41.940> it<00:00:42.149> directly<00:00:42.329> to<00:00:43.320> the

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
going to mount it directly to the

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.680 
going to mount it directly to the
sprocket<00:00:43.890> cover<00:00:44.149> so<00:00:45.149> we're<00:00:45.270> going<00:00:45.360> to<00:00:45.420> need<00:00:45.539> to

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
sprocket cover so we're going to need to

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.510 
sprocket cover so we're going to need to
take<00:00:45.809> this<00:00:45.989> cover<00:00:46.230> off<00:00:46.350> we're<00:00:46.980> going<00:00:47.070> to<00:00:47.129> drill

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
take this cover off we're going to drill

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.310 
take this cover off we're going to drill
this<00:00:48.329> cover<00:00:48.660> and<00:00:48.809> we're<00:00:48.930> going<00:00:49.050> to<00:00:49.110> mount<00:00:49.200> to

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
this cover and we're going to mount to

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.840 
this cover and we're going to mount to
here<00:00:49.940> with<00:00:50.940> one<00:00:51.149> of<00:00:51.239> our<00:00:51.329> spacers<00:00:51.809> so<00:00:52.850> before

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
here with one of our spacers so before

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.520 
here with one of our spacers so before
you<00:00:53.940> remove<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.149> sprocket<00:00:54.690> cover<00:00:54.719> you<00:00:55.260> need

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
you remove the sprocket cover you need

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.130 
you remove the sprocket cover you need
to<00:00:55.649> make<00:00:55.770> some<00:00:55.980> marks<00:00:56.329> here<00:00:57.329> and<00:00:57.420> here<00:00:57.960> where

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
to make some marks here and here where

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.869 
to make some marks here and here where
it<00:00:58.170> mounts<00:00:58.559> now<00:00:59.010> these<00:00:59.190> two<00:00:59.430> marks<00:00:59.730> are

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
it mounts now these two marks are

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.510 
it mounts now these two marks are
critical<00:01:00.329> in<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.629> travel<00:01:01.109> of<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.320> sensor<00:01:01.710> so

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
critical in the travel of the sensor so

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.509 
critical in the travel of the sensor so
first<00:01:02.789> thing<00:01:02.969> we<00:01:03.090> need<00:01:03.270> to<00:01:03.300> do<00:01:03.539> is<00:01:03.949> we<00:01:04.949> need<00:01:05.100> the

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
first thing we need to do is we need the

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.730 
first thing we need to do is we need the
first<00:01:05.790> mounting<00:01:06.270> point<00:01:06.510> to<00:01:06.720> be<00:01:06.810> 7<00:01:07.320> to<00:01:07.500> 10

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
first mounting point to be 7 to 10

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.580 
first mounting point to be 7 to 10
millimeters<00:01:08.340> in<00:01:08.549> travel<00:01:09.360> movement<00:01:09.750> so<00:01:10.439> we've

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
millimeters in travel movement so we've

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.500 
millimeters in travel movement so we've
raised<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:10.950> bike<00:01:11.130> up<00:01:11.340> we<00:01:11.850> can<00:01:12.000> spin<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.360> rear

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
raised the bike up we can spin the rear

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.380 
raised the bike up we can spin the rear
wheel<00:01:12.750> we're<00:01:13.470> in<00:01:13.590> second<00:01:14.070> gear<00:01:14.220> right<00:01:14.460> now<00:01:14.490> we

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
wheel we're in second gear right now we

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.990 
wheel we're in second gear right now we
want<00:01:15.600> to<00:01:15.720> shift<00:01:15.780> from<00:01:16.320> second<00:01:16.799> to<00:01:16.950> third<00:01:17.159> we

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
want to shift from second to third we

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.240 
want to shift from second to third we
want<00:01:18.180> to<00:01:18.390> be<00:01:18.509> between<00:01:18.810> 7<00:01:19.350> and<00:01:19.530> 10<00:01:19.710> millimeters

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
want to be between 7 and 10 millimeters

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.969 
want to be between 7 and 10 millimeters
of<00:01:20.430> movement<00:01:21.080> so<00:01:22.080> we<00:01:22.200> hold<00:01:22.409> it<00:01:22.560> somewhere<00:01:22.920> in

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
of movement so we hold it somewhere in

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.090 
of movement so we hold it somewhere in
the<00:01:23.040> center<00:01:24.409> and<00:01:25.409> we're<00:01:25.560> looking<00:01:25.799> for<00:01:25.979> that

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
the center and we're looking for that

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.789 
the center and we're looking for that
kind<00:01:26.310> of<00:01:26.369> travel

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:29.799 

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:35.520 

so<00:01:30.369> once<00:01:30.490> we<00:01:30.579> find<00:01:30.850> out

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:43.289 

go<00:01:35.950> ahead<00:01:36.070> and<00:01:36.190> mark<00:01:36.400> that<00:01:38.340> just<00:01:39.340> verify

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:43.299 

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:46.160 

that's<00:01:43.930> where<00:01:44.109> our<00:01:44.140> bottom<00:01:44.469> mount<00:01:44.649> will<00:01:44.799> be

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
that's where our bottom mount will be

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.090 
that's where our bottom mount will be
okay<00:01:47.170> first<00:01:47.409> thing<00:01:47.560> we're<00:01:47.649> going<00:01:47.740> to<00:01:47.799> do<00:01:47.979> is

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
okay first thing we're going to do is

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.859 
okay first thing we're going to do is
we're<00:01:48.189> going<00:01:48.280> to<00:01:48.369> drill<00:01:49.060> the<00:01:49.149> hole<00:01:49.329> for<00:01:49.780> the

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:49.869 
we're going to drill the hole for the

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:56.370 
we're going to drill the hole for the
bottom<00:01:50.469> out<00:01:50.649> of<00:01:50.829> this<00:01:51.070> shift<00:01:51.280> Center<00:01:55.380> we're

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
bottom out of this shift Center we're

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.230 
bottom out of this shift Center we're
going<00:01:56.500> to<00:01:56.560> simply<00:01:56.890> just<00:01:57.069> bolt<00:01:57.670> the<00:01:57.819> bottom<00:01:58.119> of

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:15.630 
top part so what we're looking for is in
the<00:02:12.760> mounted<00:02:13.120> position<00:02:13.920> 15<00:02:14.920> millimeters<00:02:15.519> from

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
the mounted position 15 millimeters from

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.179 

so<00:02:22.540> that's<00:02:22.719> what<00:02:22.900> we're<00:02:23.019> looking<00:02:23.260> for<00:02:23.290> now<00:02:23.680> we

00:02:24.179 --> 00:02:24.189 
so that's what we're looking for now we

00:02:24.189 --> 00:02:30.780 
so that's what we're looking for now we
have<00:02:24.340> to<00:02:24.430> find<00:02:24.640> them<00:02:24.790> out<00:02:24.939> on<00:02:25.950> here<00:02:29.670> now<00:02:30.670> we're

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
have to find them out on here now we're

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.309 
have to find them out on here now we're
going<00:02:30.879> to<00:02:30.939> remove<00:02:31.120> this<00:02:31.299> cover<00:02:31.510> we're<00:02:32.200> going

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:32.319 
going to remove this cover we're going

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:33.959 
going to remove this cover we're going
to<00:02:32.379> drill<00:02:32.650> that<00:02:32.769> hole<00:02:32.950> put<00:02:33.430> a<00:02:33.459> nut<00:02:33.760> on<00:02:33.790> the

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:33.969 
to drill that hole put a nut on the

00:02:33.969 --> 00:02:46.820 
to drill that hole put a nut on the
backside<00:02:34.150> and<00:02:34.629> we<00:02:34.749> should<00:02:34.930> be<00:02:35.049> good

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.710 

to<00:02:47.830> be<00:02:47.950> able<00:02:48.190> to<00:02:48.340> get<00:02:48.460> the<00:02:48.580> cover<00:02:48.880> off<00:02:49.120> and<00:02:49.600> on

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
to be able to get the cover off and on

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.110 
to be able to get the cover off and on
we<00:02:50.350> need<00:02:50.470> to<00:02:50.620> have<00:02:50.800> the<00:02:50.950> top<00:02:51.250> of<00:02:51.520> the<00:02:51.640> linear

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
we need to have the top of the linear

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.060 
we need to have the top of the linear
sensor<00:02:52.510> bolted<00:02:53.170> to<00:02:53.290> this<00:02:53.440> so<00:02:53.830> we're<00:02:53.920> going<00:02:54.010> to

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.070 
sensor bolted to this so we're going to

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:56.130 
sensor bolted to this so we're going to
remove<00:02:54.400> it<00:02:54.520> from<00:02:54.610> the<00:02:54.760> bottom<00:02:55.060> bolt<00:02:55.720> it<00:02:55.930> to<00:02:56.050> the

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
remove it from the bottom bolt it to the

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:01.410 
remove it from the bottom bolt it to the
top<00:02:56.350> and<00:02:56.650> put<00:02:57.010> everything<00:02:57.250> back<00:02:57.520> on<00:03:00.270> now<00:03:01.270> we've

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
top and put everything back on now we've

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.690 
top and put everything back on now we've
got<00:03:01.540> the<00:03:01.660> cover<00:03:01.870> back<00:03:02.110> on<00:03:02.350> with<00:03:02.890> the<00:03:03.070> linear

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
got the cover back on with the linear

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.440 
got the cover back on with the linear
sensor<00:03:04.090> attached<00:03:04.390> I'm<00:03:05.200> going<00:03:05.350> to<00:03:06.330> remount<00:03:07.330> the

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
sensor attached I'm going to remount the

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.310 
sensor attached I'm going to remount the
bottom<00:03:07.810> part<00:03:08.020> of<00:03:08.140> it<00:03:09.840> now<00:03:10.840> that<00:03:10.990> we<00:03:11.080> have<00:03:11.200> the

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:11.320 
bottom part of it now that we have the

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.200 
bottom part of it now that we have the
basic<00:03:11.650> installation<00:03:12.220> done<00:03:12.400> you<00:03:12.790> just<00:03:12.970> want<00:03:13.150> to

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:13.210 
basic installation done you just want to

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:15.000 
basic installation done you just want to
verify<00:03:13.420> that<00:03:13.840> nothing's<00:03:14.140> going<00:03:14.290> to<00:03:14.470> interfere

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
verify that nothing's going to interfere

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:16.710 
verify that nothing's going to interfere
with<00:03:15.130> the<00:03:15.250> movement<00:03:15.640> of<00:03:15.700> the<00:03:15.820> sensor<00:03:16.210> this

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
with the movement of the sensor this

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.230 
with the movement of the sensor this
part<00:03:17.080> will<00:03:17.200> be<00:03:17.290> stationed<00:03:17.740> stationary<00:03:18.730> this

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:19.240 
part will be stationed stationary this

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:22.410 
part will be stationed stationary this
part<00:03:19.540> of<00:03:19.660> course<00:03:19.870> will<00:03:19.990> be<00:03:20.080> moving<00:03:21.210> so<00:03:22.210> what

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
part of course will be moving so what

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.150 
part of course will be moving so what
you<00:03:22.540> need<00:03:22.690> to<00:03:22.750> do<00:03:22.990> is<00:03:23.230> to<00:03:23.620> do<00:03:23.770> some<00:03:23.800> final

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160 
you need to do is to do some final

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:25.830 
you need to do is to do some final
adjustments<00:03:24.340> and<00:03:24.970> this<00:03:25.330> is<00:03:25.450> going<00:03:25.630> to<00:03:25.720> be

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
adjustments and this is going to be

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.450 
adjustments and this is going to be
somewhat<00:03:26.230> trial<00:03:26.500> and<00:03:26.650> error<00:03:26.800> so<00:03:27.040> you're<00:03:27.340> going

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:27.460 
somewhat trial and error so you're going

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:28.860 
somewhat trial and error so you're going
to<00:03:27.490> have<00:03:27.640> to<00:03:27.730> go<00:03:27.850> out<00:03:27.970> and<00:03:28.150> ride<00:03:28.300> the<00:03:28.420> bike<00:03:28.600> and

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
to have to go out and ride the bike and

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:30.390 
to have to go out and ride the bike and
if<00:03:29.170> you<00:03:29.290> feel<00:03:29.560> that<00:03:29.740> it's<00:03:29.860> shifting<00:03:30.220> a<00:03:30.250> little

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
if you feel that it's shifting a little

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.550 
if you feel that it's shifting a little
bit<00:03:30.490> too<00:03:30.610> hard<00:03:30.880> or<00:03:31.180> if<00:03:31.600> it's<00:03:31.750> shifting<00:03:32.530> a

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
bit too hard or if it's shifting a

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.370 
bit too hard or if it's shifting a
little<00:03:32.710> bit<00:03:32.800> too<00:03:32.950> early<00:03:33.870> there's<00:03:34.870> quite<00:03:35.110> a<00:03:35.140> bit

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:35.380 
little bit too early there's quite a bit

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:37.650 
little bit too early there's quite a bit
of<00:03:35.560> adjustment<00:03:35.980> right<00:03:36.820> here<00:03:37.120> and<00:03:37.270> the<00:03:37.420> shift

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:37.660 
of adjustment right here and the shift

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:39.540 
of adjustment right here and the shift
shaft<00:03:37.900> so<00:03:38.440> you<00:03:38.500> can<00:03:38.650> move<00:03:38.800> this<00:03:38.950> in<00:03:39.130> and<00:03:39.310> out<00:03:39.400> as

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:39.550 
shaft so you can move this in and out as

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:42.090 
shaft so you can move this in and out as
necessary<00:03:40.350> so<00:03:41.350> go<00:03:41.500> ahead<00:03:41.590> and<00:03:41.740> play<00:03:41.980> around

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:42.100 
necessary so go ahead and play around

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:43.410 
necessary so go ahead and play around
with<00:03:42.310> that<00:03:42.430> a<00:03:42.490> little<00:03:42.610> bit<00:03:42.820> and<00:03:43.330> you<00:03:43.390> should

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:43.420 
with that a little bit and you should

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:44.580 
with that a little bit and you should
have<00:03:43.570> a<00:03:43.660> really<00:03:43.870> good<00:03:43.990> shifting<00:03:44.320> bike<00:03:44.440> when

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
have a really good shifting bike when

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:49.400 
have a really good shifting bike when
you're<00:03:44.710> all<00:03:44.800> done
