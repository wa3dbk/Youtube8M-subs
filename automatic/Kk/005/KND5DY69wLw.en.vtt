00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:08.809
 and that happens to be a vÃ©lez here if I rob the 

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:11.840
 speak already we are to Friday, May 10, 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:16.200
 2013 and good I'll present you to the new 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:18.270
 character that is called atrox with two ace 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:21.210
 and it's the new character that he's going to see in 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.730
 he is worth it is not in the pvd yet but 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.950
 they have leaked has already said their 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.110
 skills his story he 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:31.140
 and all of it is worth 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:32.880
 you know that I usually teach them the 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.250
 new characters making a spotlight 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.380
 on TV but as it is not available 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.000
 I can not teach you yet, but I can 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.620
 that I can advance you what are the 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.620
 skills of this character according 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.140
 going back to what he said of the new 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.420
 champion 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.680
 the use in video a few days ago of a 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.610
 possible new champion that was called 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.930
 They looked like I told you if it was real or I fake 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.110
 I do not think it's a fake I think it's going to 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.750
 be the next champion 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:01.400
 the one that I will explain today atrox yes that 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.380
 is going to be the champion that will come out now 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:06.050
 the next but after this I think 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:08.000
 that is going to be the other I do not think it's 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:09.830
 a fake maybe I'm wrong but 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.020
 well let's go on what is the 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:15.050
 new champion that is atrox and good 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:17.810
 basically they tell us how good their 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:22.230
 passive the trox idea passive tells us 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:25.050
 that while doing skills 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:26.910
 the capacity is made bloody well 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:30.270
 valley while you are using your 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:32.850
 skills is stored in a 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.860
 part of the cost of living of the 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.840
 skills that you use because the 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:40.290
 This character's abilities seems to be 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:44.010
 that will cost life and cheekbone type zag 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:47.400
 is going to be stored in the well and the 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:49.980
 amount of output is worth that also that 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:52.230
 amount of life is going to be reduced 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:56.010
 on a base and while you're out of 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:58.260
 combat as it is like being against 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:59.850
 combat you recover lives because you will go 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.229
 losing life from the little follow-up if 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.350
 you are out of combat 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:07.170
 then what is the use of the passive 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.060
 basically it serves so that when atrox 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.300
 loses all life is to say when what 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.630
 kill 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:15.160
 go to that bloody well to all 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:19.030
 that life that has accumulated is the one that 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:21.880
 be there is not a have not said a cap 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.319
 and then he will recover that life he does not know 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.380
 he knows how he will recover 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:29.470
 that is to say when he dies he leaves the 4 slugs 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.190
 as you already know nidia when you die 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.400
 the flower 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:35.170
 this is not known how it will come out what 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.780
 what's going to happen but what will he recover 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:39.740
 the life that is stored in the well 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:42.350
 bloody according 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:45.440
 then we pass to the skill the curve 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:47.930
 of the crosses and it's called dark angle and 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:50.660
 tells us that atrox is going to jump towards the 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:53.750
 air and it will hit the target area worth 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:55.940
 we will throw ourselves to a to a site and the 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:59.300
 enemies that are in the impact zone 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:01.840
 of atrox will be receive ribados and 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:04.700
 will receive damage and nearby enemies 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:08.290
 they will only receive damage they will not be knocked down 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:11.500
 in agreement this will be the q of approx 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:14.219
 then we go to the w w that is the 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.219
 thirst for blood 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:25.410
 basically I will say that every three attacks 

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:25.410
 is going to cure atrox life is worth 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:34.690
 when we activate the bloodlust 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:36.340
 active the bloody price is worth the 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:39.280
 bloody price is the second part of 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:42.420
 the w of agreement that makes the price 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:45.819
 bloody then every three attacks 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:48.040
 strokes what he will do is inflict damage 

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:50.880
 additional instead of healing it will leave 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:53.790
 to heal and also harm 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:56.670
 and also says that using the price 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:04:00.360
 bloody atrox will lose life in function 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:02.550
 of the damage it inflicts worth after 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:04.620
 we have the key will be the swords of 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:06.870
 torment is called agreement and says that 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:08.550
 will launch an online attack that inflicts 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:11.150
 damage and slow down the enemies that 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:11.150
 find your way 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.989
 and it also tells us that others receive the 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:18.199
 part of the cost of living if the swords 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:20.970
 of the torment hit a champion 

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:22.590
 enemy champion 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:25.350
 and finally we have the ultimate r 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:28.680
 that is called massacre and good when the 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:30.240
 we activate atrox is going to do a damage of 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.979
 instantaneous way to all enemies 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.610
 around you is going to be like a 

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:36.870
 ultimate 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:39.419
 in area and during the duration of 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:42.210
 the ultimate atrox trek massacre 

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:44.190
 will get attack speed and reach 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:47.240
 additional is the scope of their 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:50.110
 abilities on the damage will increase 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:50.110
 in agreement 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:56.600
 and good important also tells us that 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:59.780
 the use of the ultimate has no cost 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:03.409
 According lives so like vw 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:07.429
 and yes we will cost 

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:09.619
