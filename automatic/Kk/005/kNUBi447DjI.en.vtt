00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.290
 a 300 call of duty node would not be 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.620
 really one two three years went we got 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.500
 law 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:19.199
 call of duty advanced warfare otherwise 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.699
 said the war really advanced the elected 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.800
 that no how does this materialize in 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.210
 the facts we could not play the game 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.550
 for the moment we have just right to 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.369
 level demos it shows up 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.710
 obviously first by an exoskeleton 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.079
 which offers plenty of opportunities for a 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.630
 share jumped really hard to resist a little 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.010
 more at the ball and also we saw the 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.540
 possibility of closing quai de 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.020
 disappear become completely 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:45.030
 transparent so we have in mind that we did not 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.500
 could not really play we do not know what 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.110
 are the limitations but in any case we 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.420
 found that the kind of masks 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.190
 masks of veil lasts long enough 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.020
 it's almost a little cheated a little 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.399
 shit and we miss out on the enemies 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.590
 light us with the man of their lamp 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.390
 torch and we do not see so we advance 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.930
 like that quietly that's one of 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.309
 first things 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.589
 there is also after at the level of 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.720
 arming an armament that is a lot 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.990
 more 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:11.000
 advance with a grenade laical grenade 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.460
 where we actually turn and we find a little 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.190
 the menu you want to destroy 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:18.410
 robots either to make an explosion 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:20.450
 classic either for them to avoid and 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:22.310
 to whom and then you opponents 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.710
 around her so here we have a 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:27.410
 armament that evolves and then especially the 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:30.650
 big novelty of this new 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:33.950
 call of duty next gen it's the 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:36.560
 graphics then the power and where we 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.180
 tells us active vision visibly 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.060
 from a graphical point of view the arrival of 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:43.400
 the xbox one and the playstation 4 irons 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.350
 brought true leap forward graphically 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.460
 it's pretty good so we're still 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.680
 far enough I'm going out in November 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.960
 is far from the exit but it's already 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.340
 prettier than anything we've seen until 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.450
 present on a call of duty and it's not 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.520
 so amazing considering that the engine 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.869
 begins to age in this case so 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.100
 again news engine 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:01:58.670
 performance we do not know on which 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.650
 machine 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.840
 the demo we've seen turn a priori 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:04.790
 pc quite muscular even though we have seen 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.920
 buttons that seem rather buttons 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.780
 xbox one but good after we can 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.250
 call me buttons of two joysticks 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.709
 so we do not know too much about the supports 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:15.890
 it was anyway this call 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:17.840
 of duty should have a little gameplay 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.880
 enriched by the novelties of which 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.290
 the exoskeleton after for the story 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.420
 obviously it's way too early for 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.430
 to pronounce in any case the colovic 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.730
 this year to be a big jump in 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.390
 before 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.390
 we are waiting for him
