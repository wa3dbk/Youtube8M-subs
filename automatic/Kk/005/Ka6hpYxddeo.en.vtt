00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
didn't go as far as I wanted to 14.2

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.900 
didn't go as far as I wanted to 14.2
miles<00:00:07.130> started<00:00:08.130> dimming<00:00:08.400> halfway<00:00:08.730> on<00:00:08.849> my

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
miles started dimming halfway on my

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.650 
miles started dimming halfway on my
controller<00:00:09.950> but<00:00:10.950> you<00:00:11.730> know<00:00:11.820> as<00:00:12.059> you<00:00:12.120> know<00:00:12.360> my

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
controller but you know as you know my

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.350 
controller but you know as you know my
turning<00:00:13.559> meters<00:00:13.830> I<00:00:14.130> know<00:00:14.519> go<00:00:14.700> anymore<00:00:14.969> it's

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
turning meters I know go anymore it's

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.939 
turning meters I know go anymore it's
completely<00:00:15.839> shattered<00:00:16.320> so<00:00:17.100> I'm<00:00:17.940> kind<00:00:18.300> of<00:00:18.390> a

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:18.949 
completely shattered so I'm kind of a

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:20.840 
completely shattered so I'm kind of a
dreading<00:00:19.949> it<00:00:20.010> but<00:00:20.189> I'm<00:00:20.310> going<00:00:20.460> to<00:00:20.520> put<00:00:20.609> it<00:00:20.699> back

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
dreading it but I'm going to put it back

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.330 
dreading it but I'm going to put it back
in<00:00:21.180> the<00:00:21.240> garage<00:00:21.420> and<00:00:21.630> you<00:00:22.619> know<00:00:22.740> take<00:00:23.039> it<00:00:23.100> off

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
in the garage and you know take it off

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.990 
in the garage and you know take it off
wire<00:00:23.939> it<00:00:24.119> without<00:00:24.269> it<00:00:24.510> so<00:00:24.960> let's<00:00:25.500> get<00:00:25.619> to<00:00:25.680> it

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:26.000 
wire it without it so let's get to it

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.550 
wire it without it so let's get to it
there's<00:00:27.000> a<00:00:27.090> good<00:00:27.240> snapshot<00:00:27.510> once<00:00:28.080> it<00:00:28.230> goes<00:00:28.349> in

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
there's a good snapshot once it goes in

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.220 
there's a good snapshot once it goes in
the<00:00:28.710> dark<00:00:29.490> you<00:00:29.939> can<00:00:30.090> the<00:00:30.449> backlight<00:00:30.929> still

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
the dark you can the backlight still

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.200 
the dark you can the backlight still
lights<00:00:31.439> up<00:00:31.679> and<00:00:32.340> you<00:00:32.460> can<00:00:32.579> just<00:00:32.700> see<00:00:32.790> that<00:00:32.910> it's

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
lights up and you can just see that it's

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.860 
lights up and you can just see that it's
completely<00:00:33.570> shattered<00:00:34.079> so<00:00:35.010> it's<00:00:35.309> coming<00:00:35.610> out

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:35.870 
completely shattered so it's coming out

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.180 
completely shattered so it's coming out
all<00:00:36.870> rights<00:00:37.140> while<00:00:37.500> I<00:00:37.559> was<00:00:37.770> waiting<00:00:37.860> for<00:00:38.100> my

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
all rights while I was waiting for my

all rights while I was waiting for my
soldering<00:00:38.579> iron<00:00:38.760> to<00:00:38.820> heat<00:00:38.910> up<00:00:39.059> so<00:00:39.300> I<00:00:39.329> can<00:00:39.480> start

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
soldering iron to heat up so I can start

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.150 
soldering iron to heat up so I can start
fixing<00:00:39.899> my<00:00:40.200> connections<00:00:40.710> and<00:00:40.860> take<00:00:41.010> this

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
turning meter off of the bike I took my

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.029 
turning meter off of the bike I took my
dremel<00:00:44.730> and<00:00:44.850> poked<00:00:45.120> a<00:00:45.239> hole<00:00:45.360> through<00:00:46.039> this

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
dremel and poked a hole through this

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.440 
dremel and poked a hole through this
rubber<00:00:47.309> roof<00:00:47.550> here<00:00:47.820> so<00:00:48.000> I<00:00:48.059> could<00:00:48.120> find<00:00:48.329> out

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
rubber roof here so I could find out

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.360 
rubber roof here so I could find out
where<00:00:48.570> my<00:00:48.600> charging<00:00:49.110> port<00:00:49.320> was<00:00:49.500> and<00:00:50.129> I<00:00:50.190> just

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
where my charging port was and I just

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.680 
where my charging port was and I just
snipped<00:00:50.640> it<00:00:50.730> out<00:00:50.879> with<00:00:51.030> my<00:00:51.180> favorite<00:00:51.539> little

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690

electrician scissors here and you know
it's<00:00:55.170> not<00:00:55.320> perfect<00:00:55.800> they're<00:00:56.160> pretty<00:00:56.399> but

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
it's not perfect they're pretty but

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.700 
it's not perfect they're pretty but
it'll<00:00:57.090> let<00:00:57.239> me<00:00:57.329> plug<00:00:57.539> in<00:00:57.570> my<00:00:57.690> port<00:00:58.050> and<00:00:58.230> keep

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
it'll let me plug in my port and keep

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.220

this<00:00:59.270> temporary<00:01:00.270> cover<00:01:00.539> in<00:01:00.690> place<00:01:00.809> I<00:01:01.079> might

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
this temporary cover in place I might

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.660 
this temporary cover in place I might
purchase<00:01:01.469> a<00:01:01.680> new<00:01:01.710> one<00:01:01.920> eventually<00:01:02.219> but<00:01:02.550> you

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
purchase a new one eventually but you

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.320 
purchase a new one eventually but you
never<00:01:02.879> know<00:01:03.710> so<00:01:04.710> I<00:01:05.010> got<00:01:05.519> it<00:01:05.640> temporarily

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
never know so I got it temporarily

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.700 
never know so I got it temporarily
opened<00:01:06.750> up<00:01:06.840> over<00:01:07.049> here<00:01:07.229> and<00:01:07.409> i'm<00:01:07.470> going<00:01:07.619> to

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
opened up over here and i'm going to

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.590 
opened up over here and i'm going to
start<00:01:08.340> taking<00:01:08.490> apart<00:01:08.670> all<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:09.000> connections

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.060 

epoxy<00:01:12.600> i<00:01:12.630> used<00:01:12.840> is<00:01:12.990> pretty<00:01:13.290> darn<00:01:13.500> strong<00:01:13.830> they

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
epoxy i used is pretty darn strong they

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.649 
epoxy i used is pretty darn strong they
can't<00:01:14.280> get<00:01:14.430> it<00:01:14.520> off<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.850> thin<00:01:15.119> part<00:01:15.150> of<00:01:15.570> the

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
can't get it off the thin part of the

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.080 
can't get it off the thin part of the
controller<00:01:16.580> they<00:01:17.580> might<00:01:17.759> have<00:01:17.820> to<00:01:17.909> do<00:01:18.060> a

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
controller they might have to do a

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.990 
controller they might have to do a
little<00:01:18.180> dremel<00:01:18.750> into<00:01:19.020> it<00:01:19.140> later<00:01:19.320> but<00:01:19.650> a<00:01:20.000> tour

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
little dremel into it later but a tour

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.820 
little dremel into it later but a tour
off<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.330> turning<00:01:21.659> meter<00:01:21.810> i'm<00:01:22.619> going<00:01:22.740> to

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
off the turning meter i'm going to

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.609 
off the turning meter i'm going to
rewrite<00:01:22.950> these<00:01:23.280> uh<00:01:23.689> positive<00:01:24.689> negative<00:01:24.900> leads

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
rewrite these uh positive negative leads

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.109 
rewrite these uh positive negative leads
out<00:01:25.860> of<00:01:25.979> my<00:01:26.070> controller<00:01:26.460> then<00:01:26.759> i'm<00:01:26.880> going<00:01:27.030> to

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
out of my controller then i'm going to

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.760 
out of my controller then i'm going to
bring<00:01:27.240> down<00:01:27.420> connect<00:01:27.990> to<00:01:28.110> my<00:01:28.200> battery<00:01:28.619> down

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
bring down connect to my battery down

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.280 
bring down connect to my battery down
here<00:01:29.130> but<00:01:29.850> as<00:01:30.659> well<00:01:30.960> as<00:01:31.170> doing<00:01:31.350> that<00:01:31.470> i<00:01:31.920> am

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:33.290 
here but as well as doing that i am

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:35.359 
here but as well as doing that i am
mentioned<00:01:34.290> earlier<00:01:34.590> in<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:34.740> day<00:01:34.950> that<00:01:34.979> I<00:01:35.220> have

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
mentioned earlier in the day that I have

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:36.859 
mentioned earlier in the day that I have
these<00:01:35.520> conium<00:01:35.970> cells<00:01:36.210> that<00:01:36.450> I<00:01:36.540> was<00:01:36.630> thinking

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
these conium cells that I was thinking

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.420 
these conium cells that I was thinking
about<00:01:36.990> building<00:01:37.170> a<00:01:37.290> 48<00:01:37.680> volt<00:01:37.860> pack<00:01:38.070> out<00:01:38.280> of

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
about building a 48 volt pack out of

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.390 
about building a 48 volt pack out of
finally<00:01:38.850> so<00:01:39.659> what<00:01:39.780> I'm<00:01:39.869> going<00:01:39.990> to<00:01:40.049> do<00:01:40.259> is<00:01:40.530> while

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
finally so what I'm going to do is while

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.859 
finally so what I'm going to do is while
I'm<00:01:41.520> making<00:01:41.670> these<00:01:41.970> connections<00:01:42.329> i'm<00:01:42.720> just

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
I'm making these connections i'm just

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.969 
I'm making these connections i'm just
going<00:01:42.990> to<00:01:43.020> run<00:01:43.200> a<00:01:43.229> 12<00:01:43.619> gauge<00:01:44.490> set<00:01:44.970> of<00:01:45.200> wires<00:01:46.200> out

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
going to run a 12 gauge set of wires out

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.920 
going to run a 12 gauge set of wires out
toward<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:47.490> back<00:01:47.670> here<00:01:48.060> where<00:01:48.689> i<00:01:48.720> could

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
toward the back here where i could

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.870 
toward the back here where i could
either<00:01:49.049> plug<00:01:49.350> it<00:01:49.439> into<00:01:49.560> a<00:01:49.649> battery<00:01:49.890> bacpac<00:01:50.520> or

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
either plug it into a battery bacpac or

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.170 
either plug it into a battery bacpac or
maybe<00:01:51.149> later<00:01:51.360> put<00:01:51.720> maybe<00:01:51.990> a<00:01:52.560> rear<00:01:53.549> rack<00:01:53.790> on<00:01:54.119> the

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
maybe later put maybe a rear rack on the

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.160 
maybe later put maybe a rear rack on the
back<00:01:54.840> with<00:01:55.110> them<00:01:55.320> during<00:01:56.159> extended<00:01:56.670> range<00:01:57.170> and

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
back with them during extended range and

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.709 
back with them during extended range and
as<00:01:59.009> you<00:01:59.130> can<00:01:59.280> see<00:01:59.310> my<00:01:59.640> charging<00:02:00.299> port<00:02:00.540> down

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
as you can see my charging port down

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:04.730 
as you can see my charging port down
there<00:02:00.930> charging<00:02:01.680> away<00:02:03.320> well<00:02:04.320> I'm<00:02:04.560> going<00:02:04.680> to

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
there charging away well I'm going to

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.670 
there charging away well I'm going to
get<00:02:04.920> started<00:02:05.280> on<00:02:05.490> doing<00:02:05.700> that<00:02:06.380> you<00:02:07.380> know<00:02:07.500> what

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
get started on doing that you know what

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.219 
get started on doing that you know what
after<00:02:07.860> i<00:02:08.270> get<00:02:09.270> set<00:02:09.479> up<00:02:09.509> here<00:02:09.629> to<00:02:09.929> do<00:02:10.110> my

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
after i get set up here to do my

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.650 
after i get set up here to do my
soldering<00:02:10.649> i<00:02:11.009> decided<00:02:11.910> against<00:02:12.270> running<00:02:12.360> the

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
soldering i decided against running the

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.260 
soldering i decided against running the
12<00:02:12.900> gauge

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
12 gauge

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.900 
12 gauge
buyers<00:02:13.420> for<00:02:13.840> my<00:02:13.990> extended<00:02:14.440> range<00:02:14.620> pack<00:02:14.980> I

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
buyers for my extended range pack I

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:17.820 
buyers for my extended range pack I
didn't<00:02:16.630> even<00:02:16.690> build<00:02:16.960> the<00:02:17.050> pack<00:02:17.230> yet<00:02:17.500> so<00:02:17.710> I'm

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
didn't even build the pack yet so I'm

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:19.440 
didn't even build the pack yet so I'm
not<00:02:17.920> worried<00:02:18.190> about<00:02:18.250> it<00:02:18.430> it's<00:02:19.030> probably<00:02:19.210> going

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
not worried about it it's probably going

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.630 
not worried about it it's probably going
to<00:02:19.510> be<00:02:19.600> at<00:02:19.870> least<00:02:19.900> a<00:02:20.290> week<00:02:20.590> or<00:02:20.740> two<00:02:20.860> out<00:02:21.040> so<00:02:21.430> I

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
to be at least a week or two out so I

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.720 
to be at least a week or two out so I
can<00:02:22.330> always<00:02:22.540> just<00:02:23.070> get<00:02:24.070> back<00:02:24.250> to<00:02:24.400> this<00:02:24.520> point

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
can always just get back to this point

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.990 
can always just get back to this point
fairly<00:02:25.150> easy<00:02:25.390> just<00:02:25.780> take<00:02:25.960> my<00:02:26.340> tape<00:02:27.340> off<00:02:27.550> of<00:02:27.580> my

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
fairly easy just take my tape off of my

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.880 
fairly easy just take my tape off of my
splice<00:02:28.330> connections<00:02:28.870> and<00:02:29.020> just<00:02:29.200> solder<00:02:29.800> a

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
splice connections and just solder a

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:31.620 
splice connections and just solder a
little<00:02:30.160> 12<00:02:30.490> gauge<00:02:30.640> wire<00:02:30.850> on<00:02:31.030> to<00:02:31.150> it<00:02:31.270> it'll<00:02:31.480> be

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
little 12 gauge wire on to it it'll be

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.170 
little 12 gauge wire on to it it'll be
easy<00:02:31.750> enough<00:02:31.990> to<00:02:32.050> do<00:02:32.260> later<00:02:32.500> so<00:02:33.370> I'm<00:02:33.940> just

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
easy enough to do later so I'm just

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.780 
easy enough to do later so I'm just
going<00:02:34.360> to<00:02:34.420> connect<00:02:34.750> these<00:02:34.870> normally<00:02:35.680> the<00:02:36.670> way

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
going to connect these normally the way

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.790 
going to connect these normally the way
I<00:02:36.820> would<00:02:37.120> the<00:02:37.810> way<00:02:37.930> I<00:02:37.960> did<00:02:38.170> before<00:02:38.200> with<00:02:38.650> my

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 
I would the way I did before with my

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.150 
I would the way I did before with my
without<00:02:39.190> my<00:02:39.280> turning<00:02:39.610> meter<00:02:40.770> all<00:02:41.770> right<00:02:41.980> and

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
without my turning meter all right and

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.310 
without my turning meter all right and
didn't<00:02:42.790> take<00:02:42.850> as<00:02:43.000> long<00:02:43.090> as<00:02:43.210> I<00:02:43.270> thought<00:02:43.480> we<00:02:43.810> took

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320 
didn't take as long as I thought we took

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:47.610 
didn't take as long as I thought we took
about<00:02:44.530> 30<00:02:44.800> minutes<00:02:45.100> to<00:02:45.190> do<00:02:45.370> it<00:02:45.400> all<00:02:45.640> and<00:02:46.530> get<00:02:47.530> it

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
about 30 minutes to do it all and get it

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.100 
about 30 minutes to do it all and get it
all<00:02:47.710> back<00:02:48.160> together<00:02:48.420> as<00:02:49.420> you<00:02:49.510> can<00:02:49.600> see<00:02:49.840> I<00:02:49.870> still

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
all back together as you can see I still

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:51.540 
all back together as you can see I still
have<00:02:50.230> the<00:02:50.380> little<00:02:50.650> hole<00:02:50.800> there<00:02:50.830> from<00:02:51.040> before

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:51.550 
have the little hole there from before

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:54.960 
have the little hole there from before
where<00:02:51.760> I<00:02:51.790> put<00:02:52.090> my<00:02:52.150> little<00:02:52.420> red<00:02:52.600> key<00:02:52.870> now<00:02:53.580> but<00:02:54.580> it

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
where I put my little red key now but it

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:56.640 
where I put my little red key now but it
looks<00:02:55.180> like<00:02:55.450> now<00:02:55.720> all<00:02:55.900> I<00:02:55.990> have<00:02:56.080> to<00:02:56.140> do<00:02:56.260> is<00:02:56.380> clean

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
looks like now all I have to do is clean

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:00.980 
looks like now all I have to do is clean
up<00:02:56.680> that<00:02:57.010> epoxy<00:02:57.760> on<00:02:58.000> top<00:02:58.360> of<00:02:58.480> the<00:02:58.540> controller

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:00.990 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:03.150 

and<00:03:01.990> I<00:03:02.200> guess<00:03:02.380> I'm<00:03:02.530> going<00:03:02.680> to<00:03:02.740> get<00:03:03.010> to<00:03:03.130> that

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160 
and I guess I'm going to get to that

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.840 
and I guess I'm going to get to that
while<00:03:03.580> the<00:03:03.910> bike<00:03:04.300> still<00:03:04.570> charged<00:03:04.810> him<00:03:04.960> back<00:03:05.110> up

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
while the bike still charged him back up

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:08.160 
while the bike still charged him back up
alright<00:03:06.850> I<00:03:06.880> just<00:03:06.910> raised<00:03:07.300> up<00:03:07.480> my<00:03:07.600> seat<00:03:07.810> post<00:03:08.050> a

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
alright I just raised up my seat post a

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.400 
alright I just raised up my seat post a

and did a little dremel in up here man
is<00:03:23.260> that<00:03:23.380> epoxy<00:03:23.650> make<00:03:23.920> a<00:03:23.950> mess<00:03:24.250> there's

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:24.580 
is that epoxy make a mess there's

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:27.390 
is that epoxy make a mess there's
shavings<00:03:25.150> all<00:03:25.660> over<00:03:26.020> the<00:03:26.110> place<00:03:26.320> got<00:03:27.100> it<00:03:27.190> down

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
shavings all over the place got it down

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.460 
shavings all over the place got it down
to<00:03:27.700> the<00:03:27.880> fin<00:03:28.120> shaved<00:03:28.600> in<00:03:28.780> the<00:03:28.870> fins<00:03:29.080> a<00:03:29.230> little

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
to the fin shaved in the fins a little

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:31.680 
to the fin shaved in the fins a little
bit<00:03:29.670> got<00:03:30.670> it<00:03:30.760> off<00:03:30.850> the<00:03:30.970> best<00:03:31.150> they<00:03:31.300> could<00:03:31.360> I'm

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
bit got it off the best they could I'm

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:33.870 
bit got it off the best they could I'm
probably<00:03:31.900> going<00:03:32.320> to<00:03:32.410> end<00:03:32.440> up<00:03:32.620> you<00:03:33.550> know<00:03:33.580> maybe

that's all i'm going to do today
probably<00:03:52.300> gonna<00:03:52.390> let<00:03:52.570> this<00:03:52.660> charge<00:03:52.930> up<00:03:53.200> and

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:53.709 
probably gonna let this charge up and

clean<00:03:54.190> up<00:03:54.340> in<00:03:54.459> here<00:03:54.490> a<00:03:54.640> bit<00:03:54.820> and<00:03:54.940> probably<00:03:55.270> go

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:55.360 
clean up in here a bit and probably go

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.570 
clean up in here a bit and probably go
for<00:03:55.450> another<00:03:55.570> spin<00:03:56.040> see<00:03:57.040> how<00:03:57.130> it<00:03:57.310> all<00:03:57.370> holds

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:57.580 
for another spin see how it all holds

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:59.130 
for another spin see how it all holds
together<00:03:57.820> without<00:03:58.180> the<00:03:58.360> tourney<00:03:58.570> meter<00:03:58.840> that
