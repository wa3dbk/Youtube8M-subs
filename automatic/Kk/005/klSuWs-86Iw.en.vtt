 perfectly put a couple of tablespoons of sugar 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:07.150
 It will cost a little more because they have a license to return it until they continue 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.150
 struggling 

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:22.170
 comes to laredo mossa origin more or less I put all teaspoons or good

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:34.049
 macerate mint leaves a little 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:40.790
 exert a little pressure to get a little bit of the aroma 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:47.099
 to the leaflets not titled too much because if we crush them too much 

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:52.239
 expo when we are going to take it with the sip we are going to cover it up, it is noticeable and not even 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:53.479

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:56.689
 well only in mind 

00:02:56.689 --> 00:03:00.360
 a little bit and now we are going to make this reality and pride 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.360

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:08.159
 as if he or she is easy to use 3 the judge explains that you only get there soon 

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:11.649
 but let's be the next 

00:03:11.649 --> 00:03:13.609

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:21.750
 the mortar 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.759
 one thing I did not tell him 

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:27.969
 if you do not have the mortar because not everyone has good mortar is not known yet 

00:03:27.969 --> 00:03:29.449
 stick of ccoo-a

 it will serve you 

00:03:32.669 --> 00:03:35.169
 to macerate a little the leaves in the glass 

00:03:35.169 --> 00:03:37.099
 and what they do is 

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:40.499
 they hit you a little bit yesterday or maybe it broke 

00:03:40.499 --> 00:03:41.929
 peace does not have to be 

00:03:41.929 --> 00:03:44.929
 totally ground but small houses 

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:47.939
 to use it 

00:03:47.939 --> 00:03:50.299
 in this work 

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:53.529
 well I only have be here soon what we are going to do is 

00:03:53.529 --> 00:03:55.519
 and it

 to the top 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:01.639
 remember that it is a typically Cuban drink 

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:06.239
 if it takes a lot 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:09.519
 If someday you have the opportunity to go to Cuba

 very refreshing remember sword 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:20.739
 those summers 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:23.710
 It is estimated that Cuba has 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:26.539
 so much fiscal 

00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:29.909
 this is a very refreshing drink also of low alcohol content 

00:04:29.909 --> 00:04:32.909

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:36.909
 white rum 

00:04:40.809 --> 00:04:44.069
 a half white rum no white rice are more or less 

00:04:44.069 --> 00:04:47.069
 about 50 cubic centimeters 

00:04:50.939 --> 00:04:54.889
 as I always tell you if you prefer it softer you were added if 

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:55.530

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:06.389
 tessio that the guerr 

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:09.389
