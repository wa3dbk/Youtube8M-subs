I'm<00:03:33.459> not<00:03:33.640> quite<00:03:34.060> satisfied<00:03:34.300> with<00:03:34.660> this<00:03:34.870> color

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.170 
I'm not quite satisfied with this color

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:41.720 
I'm not quite satisfied with this color
so<00:03:35.349> I'm<00:03:35.410> going<00:03:35.590> to<00:03:35.650> darken<00:03:36.040> it

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.820 

and<00:03:42.730> now<00:03:42.940> the<00:03:43.600> entire<00:03:43.930> drawing<00:03:44.230> seems<00:03:44.680> a

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:44.830 
and now the entire drawing seems a

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:46.770 
and now the entire drawing seems a
little<00:03:44.950> bit<00:03:45.190> too<00:03:45.430> light<00:03:45.700> so<00:03:46.390> I'm<00:03:46.450> going<00:03:46.720> to

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
little bit too light so I'm going to

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:51.540 
little bit too light so I'm going to
take<00:03:47.050> a<00:03:47.320> gray<00:03:49.230> just<00:03:50.230> to<00:03:50.650> disperse<00:03:51.130> this<00:03:51.280> color

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:51.550 
take a gray just to disperse this color

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:53.730 
take a gray just to disperse this color
more<00:03:51.790> and<00:03:51.910> I'm<00:03:52.000> going<00:03:52.180> to<00:03:52.270> cover<00:03:52.510> over<00:03:52.810> all<00:03:53.620> of

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:53.740 
more and I'm going to cover over all of

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:57.600 
more and I'm going to cover over all of
it<00:03:55.560> and<00:03:56.560> I<00:03:56.620> don't<00:03:56.770> think<00:03:57.010> I'll<00:03:57.100> be<00:03:57.250> adding<00:03:57.430> a

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:57.610 
it and I don't think I'll be adding a

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:59.040 
it and I don't think I'll be adding a
background<00:03:58.120> to<00:03:58.300> this<00:03:58.450> drawing

00:03:59.040 --> 00:03:59.050 
background to this drawing

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:01.020 
background to this drawing
it<00:03:59.230> just<00:03:59.500> looks<00:03:59.710> pretty<00:04:00.100> simple<00:04:00.370> and<00:04:00.700> it<00:04:00.820> looks

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030 
it just looks pretty simple and it looks

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:03.810 
it just looks pretty simple and it looks
even<00:04:01.210> better<00:04:01.450> like<00:04:01.750> this<00:04:02.070> and<00:04:03.070> here<00:04:03.430> is<00:04:03.580> my

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:03.820 
even better like this and here is my

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:07.020 
even better like this and here is my
finished<00:04:04.120> drawing<00:04:04.480> of<00:04:04.690> Volta<00:04:05.050> poi<00:04:05.910> like<00:04:06.910> I

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030 
finished drawing of Volta poi like I

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:09.240 
finished drawing of Volta poi like I
said<00:04:07.210> before<00:04:07.360> it's<00:04:07.660> pretty<00:04:07.930> simple<00:04:08.290> I<00:04:08.590> kind<00:04:09.190> of

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250 
said before it's pretty simple I kind of

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:11.130 
said before it's pretty simple I kind of
like<00:04:09.400> how<00:04:09.550> it<00:04:09.580> turned<00:04:09.820> out<00:04:09.970> especially<00:04:10.870> since

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:11.140 
like how it turned out especially since

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:12.750 
like how it turned out especially since
it<00:04:11.440> is<00:04:11.470> kind<00:04:11.830> of<00:04:11.920> the<00:04:11.980> first<00:04:12.160> time<00:04:12.280> drawing<00:04:12.640> it

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:12.760 
it is kind of the first time drawing it

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.150 
it is kind of the first time drawing it
but<00:04:12.940> hey<00:04:13.330> it's<00:04:13.570> a<00:04:13.630> pretty<00:04:13.840> easy<00:04:14.020> character<00:04:14.500> if

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:15.160 
but hey it's a pretty easy character if

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:16.770 
but hey it's a pretty easy character if
you're<00:04:15.400> a<00:04:15.430> beginning<00:04:15.700> Drive<00:04:16.000> I<00:04:16.030> recommend

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:19.270 
this I had a little bit of fun drawing

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:21.000 
this I had a little bit of fun drawing
this<00:04:19.540> but<00:04:19.720> my<00:04:19.840> eyes<00:04:20.020> were<00:04:20.260> sort<00:04:20.500> of<00:04:20.560> acting<00:04:20.860> up

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.010 
this but my eyes were sort of acting up

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:23.850 
this but my eyes were sort of acting up
so<00:04:21.540> apparently<00:04:22.540> I'm<00:04:22.720> wondering<00:04:23.200> about<00:04:23.440> my
