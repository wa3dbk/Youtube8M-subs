00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
this amp uh it's you know like I said in

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.550 
this amp uh it's you know like I said in
the<00:01:44.750> previous<00:01:45.260> video<00:01:45.680> it's<00:01:46.190> got<00:01:47.110> 150<00:01:48.110> watts<00:01:48.350> of

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
it right now to say try to hang on to

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.069 
it right now to say try to hang on to
this<00:03:22.549> this<00:03:23.549> piece<00:03:23.849> of<00:03:24.060> equipment<00:03:24.120> if<00:03:24.599> you<00:03:24.750> can

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:25.079 
this this piece of equipment if you can

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:28.460 
this this piece of equipment if you can
and<00:03:26.569> because<00:03:27.569> that's<00:03:27.750> what<00:03:27.989> I'm<00:03:28.110> going<00:03:28.380> to

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
and because that's what I'm going to

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.880 
and because that's what I'm going to
almost<00:03:28.860> make<00:03:29.040> the<00:03:29.310> mistake<00:03:29.670> of<00:03:29.700> putting<00:03:30.769> it<00:03:31.769> on

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
almost make the mistake of putting it on

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:35.870 
almost make the mistake of putting it on
the<00:03:32.130> market<00:03:33.000> to<00:03:33.150> sell<00:03:33.389> it<00:03:33.600> and<00:03:34.489> so<00:03:35.489> I<00:03:35.519> put<00:03:35.850> on

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
the market to sell it and so I put on

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.910 
the market to sell it and so I put on
one<00:03:36.180> of<00:03:36.239> them<00:03:36.420> like<00:03:36.630> trading<00:03:37.049> newspaper<00:03:37.620> so

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
one of them like trading newspaper so

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.309 
one of them like trading newspaper so
some<00:03:38.190> somebody<00:03:38.730> called<00:03:39.060> call<00:03:39.660> me<00:03:39.900> about<00:03:40.109> it

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:40.319 
some somebody called call me about it

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:42.259 
some somebody called call me about it
and<00:03:40.470> I<00:03:41.100> told<00:03:41.340> them<00:03:41.430> you<00:03:41.579> know<00:03:41.609> the<00:03:41.850> list<00:03:42.090> of

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
and I told them you know the list of

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:45.259 
and I told them you know the list of
what<00:03:42.510> power<00:03:42.750> which<00:03:43.049> is<00:03:43.230> 150<00:03:43.829> watts<00:03:44.090> which<00:03:45.090> is

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:45.269 
what power which is 150 watts which is

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:48.650 
what power which is 150 watts which is
incredible<00:03:45.959> that<00:03:46.400> how<00:03:47.400> you<00:03:48.329> know<00:03:48.450> I'm<00:03:48.630> sure

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
incredible that how you know I'm sure

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.990 
incredible that how you know I'm sure
nowadays<00:03:49.440> they're<00:03:49.739> they<00:03:50.639> can<00:03:50.819> really

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
nowadays they're they can really

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.050 
nowadays they're they can really
engineer<00:03:51.569> engineer<00:03:51.989> that<00:03:52.769> size<00:03:53.489> amp<00:03:53.819> with

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
engineer engineer that size amp with

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.240 
engineer engineer that size amp with
that<00:03:54.209> much<00:03:54.389> power<00:03:54.630> much<00:03:55.049> easier<00:03:55.440> now<00:03:55.680> they<00:03:55.920> did

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
that much power much easier now they did

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:58.970 
that much power much easier now they did
then<00:03:56.519> but<00:03:57.299> that's<00:03:57.480> a<00:03:57.600> remarkable<00:03:58.319> feat

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
then but that's a remarkable feat

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:02.000 
then but that's a remarkable feat
because<00:03:59.190> most<00:03:59.639> of<00:03:59.910> amp<00:04:00.239> that<00:04:00.650> would<00:04:01.650> equal

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
because most of amp that would equal

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.490 
because most of amp that would equal
that<00:04:02.280> much<00:04:02.880> power<00:04:03.150> would<00:04:03.510> usually<00:04:03.750> be<00:04:03.989> like

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
that much power would usually be like

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:08.000 
that much power would usually be like
the<00:04:04.680> cabinet<00:04:05.220> with<00:04:05.370> a<00:04:05.569> header<00:04:06.569> put<00:04:06.930> on<00:04:07.109> it<00:04:07.290> to

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
the cabinet with a header put on it to

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:11.210 
the cabinet with a header put on it to
put<00:04:08.489> that<00:04:08.670> type<00:04:08.880> of<00:04:08.910> water<00:04:09.299> in<00:04:09.480> it<00:04:09.630> but<00:04:10.040> to<00:04:11.040> have

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
put that type of water in it but to have

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:12.920 
put that type of water in it but to have
it<00:04:11.340> all<00:04:11.489> in<00:04:11.519> one<00:04:11.730> like<00:04:12.060> that<00:04:12.090> I'm<00:04:12.480> not<00:04:12.660> saying

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
it all in one like that I'm not saying

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:15.379 
it all in one like that I'm not saying
this<00:04:13.109> was<00:04:13.349> the<00:04:13.470> only<00:04:13.590> one<00:04:13.980> that<00:04:14.970> was<00:04:15.150> around

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:15.389 
this was the only one that was around

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:19.759 
this was the only one that was around
then<00:04:15.750> but<00:04:16.639> for<00:04:17.639> the<00:04:17.729> quality<00:04:18.329> and<00:04:18.590> to<00:04:19.590> have

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:19.769 
then but for the quality and to have

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:23.659 
then but for the quality and to have
that<00:04:20.010> strength<00:04:20.880> in<00:04:21.389> it<00:04:21.599> is<00:04:22.530> a<00:04:22.590> remarkable<00:04:23.370> feat

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:23.669 
that strength in it is a remarkable feat

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:26.659 
that strength in it is a remarkable feat
of<00:04:23.700> Engineering<00:04:24.630> and<00:04:24.919> I'm<00:04:25.919> just<00:04:26.250> wanting<00:04:26.639> to

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:26.669 
of Engineering and I'm just wanting to

called and I was telling about our
talking<00:04:39.930> over<00:04:40.169> phone<00:04:40.470> I<00:04:40.770> told<00:04:41.280> about<00:04:41.669> the

00:04:42.439 --> 00:04:42.449 
talking over phone I told about the

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:44.989 
talking over phone I told about the
Zann<00:04:42.749> pieces<00:04:43.289> well<00:04:43.499> he<00:04:44.189> says<00:04:44.430> that<00:04:44.610> sounds

00:04:44.989 --> 00:04:44.999 
Zann pieces well he says that sounds

00:04:44.999 --> 00:04:48.769 
Zann pieces well he says that sounds
awfully<00:04:45.590> awfully<00:04:46.590> small<00:04:47.370> for<00:04:47.430> and<00:04:47.999> afters

00:04:48.769 --> 00:04:48.779 
awfully awfully small for and afters

00:04:48.779 --> 00:04:51.379 
awfully awfully small for and afters
power<00:04:49.080> and<00:04:49.409> on<00:04:49.919> average<00:04:50.189> it<00:04:50.520> is<00:04:50.669> a<00:04:50.699> small<00:04:51.120> ant

00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:51.389 
power and on average it is a small ant
