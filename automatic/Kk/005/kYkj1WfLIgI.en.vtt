00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:15.130
 official friends 

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:22.359
 obviously when 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:24.280
 and in a lesson and they spend a lot of 

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:26.890
 circumstances 

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:29.860
 convert is always a relief today I 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:31.780
 It's about being a substitute and I said what I 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:34.180
 touch play I will try to do the best and 

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:35.980
 I will try to support the team and that 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:38.290
 I try to work every day 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.790
 He gave a lot of this profession 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.470
 and every day I want to be a better professional 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:43.480
 with I have not done words 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:44.700
 thanks for the people I think 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.880
 do not 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.750
 I sometimes wonder why both 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:52.280
 sweetie 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.280
 I think I try to give my best 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.700
 every time I enter the court I try to 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.700
 defend a dead this beach 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.219
 I think we were slightly superior 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.799
 in the process of the match and 

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:28.200
 fortunately we could reflect it in 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:30.240
 the score almost at the end I think they win 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.479
 his justice a football match and 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.369
 football very even but one 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.610
 again the character the determination the 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:40.590
 they would take out their players they tipped it to 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.619
 our necessary favor we carry 8 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.750
 matches won in a row followed who 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:48.209
 yes, the thing is going well but we believe in 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:51.030
 the same we do not take off the feet of the floor 

00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:53.069
 we know that the important thing is how 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.840
 we come to the line and in that we do not 

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:56.939
 we lose sight and we do not lose 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.079
 view that we have to always have the 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:00.079
 feet on the floor 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:29.920
 If I had to put a rating 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:32.420
 departure that the public 76 and a half 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:35.090
 I already wanted to approach entrepreneurs 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.440
 zero to zero I think it's a day that 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.819
 came when we had a position to 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.950
 ball us and they spend all the 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:42.560
 line half of the slapping all 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.750
 unemployed the 11 we saw study 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.220
 waters whose sole is a team that 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.950
 adds little but has very good 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:51.920
 players and you see a very compact team 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.420
 at the time of defending and we had spoken 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.980
 that we had to have a lot of mobility and 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.959
 a lot of position of the balls that do not 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:01.010
 we did all the time I insist that 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:03.879
 things a worthy fire of the three 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:03.879
 equal points 

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:08.620
 but this already reach us common
