00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:12.240
 or the pity friends of the web an enemy of 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.610
 rome asks me today a question of those 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.070
 curious that is if it is true that the juice of 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.410
 grapefruit increases the power of viagra 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.699
 well the grapefruit juice of course 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.470
 also the grapefruit of the juice yes 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.000
 concentrate the components of acts vi 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.099
 I said grapefruit juice and one of 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.230
 those foods that need to be 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.820
 particularly careful in the field of 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.759
 interactions with drugs because 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.500
 actually contains phytochemicals which 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.860
 inhibit various detoxifying enzymes 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:40.620
 and first of all a group of enzymes of 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.059
 phase 1 of the cytochrome p450 which are the 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.969
 most important class of enzymes 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.200
 involved in drug metabolism the 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.480
 their involvement consists 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.760
 mainly in the action si of 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.649
 these molecules that therefore lose the 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.289
 their function then come further 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.420
 that is to say catalyzed and finally dismantled 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.579
 eliminated from the body and is normal 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.559
 that is how it is when we hire a 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.049
 drug we don't want her to play 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.519
 action to infinity we want it to do 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.189
 what you have to do in a given 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.140
 time interval and then come 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.299
 degraded and eliminated from ours 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.729
 organism and detoxifying enzymes 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.390
 have exactly this task 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.729
 cleaning 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.680
 now we can easily imagine though 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.720
 that if we inhibit these enzymes there 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.220
 let's work less like it happens 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.140
 drinking grapefruit juice but also 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.509
 with some air ball i products like the 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.850
 kymco biloba is good indeed I work have 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.400
 the less the drug is not degraded as 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.439
 should but more slowly therefore stay in 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.570
 more and perform more action 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:38.640
 powerful than we expected even the 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.409
 plays longer and when we say more 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.960
 powerful can also be many times 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:45.240
 more powerful five times more per 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.770
 some drugs such as viagra but 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.860
 also some statins some antibiotics 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.700
 like some cyclosporin 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.520
 some oral contraceptives 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.190
 certain anticoagulants drugs 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.290
 hypertensives such as channel blockers 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:59.120
 attention football can also happen 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:01.160
 otherwise that is, there are foods and 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:03.200
 of herbs such as perico extract 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:05.840
 lefebre liquorice that on the contrary 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.070
 induce the activity of these in 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.229
 sinni and therefore produce the effect 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.270
 exactly the opposite is the drug 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.430
 it is inactivated too much this time 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:16.460
 hurry and therefore risks not succeeding 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:18.740
 even to carry out his action or 

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:21.170
 do it inadequately 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:23.000
 how easy it is to imagine both of these 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.830
 situations can be a lot 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.380
 dangerous imagine taking a 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:29.540
 anticoagulant and cold blood chips 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.760
 with a strength five times stronger than 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.310
 how much did you expect to risk the 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.680
 bleed or otherwise take 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:39.050
 the antibiotic and in half the power 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.930
 or the contraceptive pill then 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:44.030
 reduce the contraceptive effect better 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:45.680
 no now in the case of viagra 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.780
 there is some popular literature that 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.670
 play around with this knowledge then 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.650
 someone says oh well if with the juice of 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.480
 grapefruit I can triple the power of 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.460
 viagra now i take a third of the 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.410
 tablet that with what they cost e 

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:59.900
 is also comfortable then tripled 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.310
 power and therefore to the same effect 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.600
 and this line of reasoning by 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.260
 principle can also work 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:07.910
 obviously it's not a formally thing 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.560
 something else is recommended instead 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:12.230
 that of taking grapefruit juice 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:14.090
 more without decreasing the dose of 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.739
 drug but only to say strengthens 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.590
 further the effect and then who me 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:20.120
 obviously this is still the case 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:22.160
 dangerous because it can bring the drug 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.200
 far beyond its range of 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.959
 optimal operation can therefore be 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:29.120
 look for side effects from a 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:31.400
 simple headache up to variations 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.000
 you don't want the pressure of 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.190
 blood 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.620
 the true moral of the whole speech 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:38.690
 instead it is the following during therapies 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:41.120
 pharmacological that have interactions 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:43.550
 known with certain foods or certain products 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:45.860
 herbalists is best avoided 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:47.600
 combination and therefore every possible 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:48.700
 risk of interactions so if 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.140
 we have to take a new drug 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:53.120
 let us inform ourselves of his possibilities 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:54.770
 interactions and if we are taking some 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.630
 supplements or products 

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:59.300
 special herbalists do not 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:59.780
 never forget to tell ours 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:03.790
 doctor 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:03.790
 all the reforms are clear
