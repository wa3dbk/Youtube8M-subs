00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:51.389 
there no one likes to see that oh I

00:02:51.389 --> 00:02:54.589 
there no one likes to see that oh I
can't<00:02:51.659> get<00:02:51.870> it<00:02:51.959> all<00:02:52.049> off<00:02:52.260> right<00:02:52.500> now<00:02:52.680> but<00:02:53.599> as

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:54.599 
can't get it all off right now but as

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:57.679 
can't get it all off right now but as
you<00:02:54.720> can<00:02:54.840> see<00:02:55.169> it's<00:02:55.409> not<00:02:56.120> not<00:02:57.120> a<00:02:57.150> whole<00:02:57.510> lot

00:02:57.679 --> 00:02:57.689 
you can see it's not not a whole lot

00:02:57.689 --> 00:02:59.990 
you can see it's not not a whole lot
smaller<00:02:58.109> than<00:02:58.379> the<00:02:58.680> the<00:02:59.010> delica<00:02:59.400> blade<00:02:59.609> I<00:02:59.790> mean

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
smaller than the the delica blade I mean

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.770 
smaller than the the delica blade I mean
what<00:03:00.659> is<00:03:00.750> that<00:03:04.970> maybe<00:03:05.970> a<00:03:06.120> quarter<00:03:06.510> of<00:03:06.599> an<00:03:06.659> inch

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780
