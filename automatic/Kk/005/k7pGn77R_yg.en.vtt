like i said this first time I really had
a<00:05:22.320> week<00:05:22.560> a<00:05:22.800> wheat<00:05:23.460> style<00:05:24.030> beer<00:05:24.240> and<00:05:24.890> I'm<00:05:25.890> gonna

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:26.040 
a week a wheat style beer and I'm gonna

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:28.940 
a week a wheat style beer and I'm gonna
have<00:05:26.220> to<00:05:26.310> try<00:05:26.490> some<00:05:26.700> more<00:05:27.020> i<00:05:28.020> think<00:05:28.770> i<00:05:28.830> would

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:28.950 
have to try some more i think i would

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:31.010 
have to try some more i think i would
definitely<00:05:29.400> gravitate<00:05:29.730> towards<00:05:30.510> a<00:05:30.720> wheat

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:31.020 
definitely gravitate towards a wheat

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:32.920 
definitely gravitate towards a wheat
beer<00:05:31.260> or<00:05:31.530> at<00:05:31.620> least<00:05:31.770> this<00:05:31.920> particular<00:05:32.370> one

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:32.930 
beer or at least this particular one

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:35.240 
beer or at least this particular one
even<00:05:33.930> more<00:05:34.050> so<00:05:34.350> than<00:05:34.530> like<00:05:34.710> a<00:05:34.740> corona<00:05:35.130> or

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:35.250 
even more so than like a corona or

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:37.030 
even more so than like a corona or
something<00:05:35.580> like<00:05:35.640> that<00:05:35.700> or<00:05:35.970> the<00:05:36.120> stella<00:05:36.330> artois

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:37.040 
something like that or the stella artois

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:39.980 
something like that or the stella artois
really<00:05:38.040> really<00:05:38.250> good<00:05:38.400> very<00:05:38.610> subtle<00:05:38.990> they're

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:39.990 
really really good very subtle they're

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:41.990 
really really good very subtle they're
just<00:05:40.020> really<00:05:40.410> like<00:05:40.680> almost<00:05:40.920> no<00:05:41.190> bitterness<00:05:41.640> to

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:42.000 
just really like almost no bitterness to

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.580 
just really like almost no bitterness to
this<00:05:42.180> like<00:05:42.900> i<00:05:42.990> said<00:05:43.050> i<00:05:43.170> know<00:05:43.260> this<00:05:43.440> is<00:05:43.500> very

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:43.590 
this like i said i know this is very

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:45.380 
this like i said i know this is very
off-putting<00:05:43.860> for<00:05:44.250> people<00:05:44.760> who<00:05:44.880> tried<00:05:45.210> beer

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:45.390 
off-putting for people who tried beer

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:47.000 
off-putting for people who tried beer
and<00:05:45.540> didn't<00:05:45.720> like<00:05:45.780> it<00:05:45.840> because<00:05:46.230> i<00:05:46.530> got<00:05:46.650> bitter

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:47.010 
and didn't like it because i got bitter

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:50.300 
and didn't like it because i got bitter
the<00:05:47.880> hops<00:05:48.090> too<00:05:48.330> strong<00:05:48.570> or<00:05:48.780> the<00:05:48.840> barley<00:05:49.200> or<00:05:49.310> you
