00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
weapons okay you big server but it can

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.580 
weapons okay you big server but it can
become<00:00:46.530> even<00:00:46.950> bigger<00:00:47.570> when<00:00:48.570> you<00:00:48.660> have<00:00:48.870> good

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
become even bigger when you have good

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.510 
become even bigger when you have good
technique<00:00:50.690> this<00:00:51.690> is<00:00:51.870> what<00:00:52.110> every<00:00:52.980> good<00:00:53.160> server

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
technique this is what every good server

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.569 
technique this is what every good server
has<00:00:53.879> to<00:00:54.149> have<00:00:55.160> look<00:00:56.160> at<00:00:56.280> that<00:00:56.370> traffic

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
has to have look at that traffic

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:02.740 
has to have look at that traffic
decision<00:00:57.180> here<00:00:57.420> and<00:00:58.379> look<00:00:58.559> at<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:58.800> tip<00:00:59.070> okay

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:02.750 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:04.910 

keeping<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:03.840> head<00:01:03.989> of<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.170> racket<00:01:04.530> always

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
keeping the head of the racket always

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.800 
keeping the head of the racket always
talk<00:01:06.560> right<00:01:07.560> now<00:01:08.030> we<00:01:09.030> take<00:01:09.240> a<00:01:09.299> look<00:01:09.570> at<00:01:09.689> your

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
talk right now we take a look at your

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:16.249 
talk right now we take a look at your
serve<00:01:13.010> this<00:01:14.010> is<00:01:14.189> not<00:01:14.430> that<00:01:14.640> bad<00:01:14.939> but<00:01:15.360> it<00:01:15.930> can<00:01:16.110> be

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
serve this is not that bad but it can be

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:22.179 
serve this is not that bad but it can be
better<00:01:16.530> right<00:01:16.860> it<00:01:17.400> can<00:01:17.610> be<00:01:17.759> more<00:01:18.650> like<00:01:19.650> this

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:22.189 

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:25.640 

right<00:01:23.270> so<00:01:24.270> you<00:01:24.330> can<00:01:24.600> launch<00:01:24.900> yourself<00:01:25.080> and<00:01:25.530> hit

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
right so you can launch yourself and hit

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.020 
right so you can launch yourself and hit
the<00:01:25.740> ball<00:01:25.920> higher<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.520> higher<00:01:26.670> you<00:01:26.820> get<00:01:26.970> the

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
the ball higher the higher you get the

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.899 
the ball higher the higher you get the
voltage<00:01:27.450> is<00:01:27.509> going<00:01:27.750> to<00:01:27.869> get<00:01:28.490> put<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.610> ball<00:01:29.790> in

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
voltage is going to get put the ball in

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:35.230 
voltage is going to get put the ball in
the<00:01:29.939> box<00:01:30.270> now<00:01:32.210> you<00:01:33.210> work<00:01:33.450> with<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:33.750> hip

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
the box now you work with the hip

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.960 
the box now you work with the hip
alright<00:01:36.240> it's<00:01:36.720> a<00:01:36.840> lot<00:01:37.079> of<00:01:37.110> work<00:01:37.640> as<00:01:38.640> well<00:01:38.939> as

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
alright it's a lot of work as well as

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:45.260 
alright it's a lot of work as well as
keeping<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:39.750> head<00:01:39.930> of<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.110> racket<00:01:40.439> oh<00:01:40.590> yeah

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.840 

right<00:01:46.270> here<00:01:46.630> okay<00:01:47.619> it's<00:01:48.280> just<00:01:48.399> a<00:01:48.610> more

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 
right here okay it's just a more

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:50.969 
right here okay it's just a more
explosive<00:01:49.350> form<00:01:50.350> of<00:01:50.530> getting<00:01:50.770> the<00:01:50.860> ball

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:50.979 
explosive form of getting the ball

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:54.960 
explosive form of getting the ball
that's<00:01:51.250> the<00:01:51.369> most<00:01:51.579> efficient<00:01:52.119> way<00:01:53.700> why<00:01:54.700> do<00:01:54.759> we

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:54.970 
that's the most efficient way why do we

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:58.800 
that's the most efficient way why do we
want<00:01:55.090> to<00:01:55.299> keep<00:01:55.479> out<00:01:55.920> here<00:01:57.330> that's<00:01:58.330> where<00:01:58.780> our

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
want to keep out here that's where our

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:00.929 
want to keep out here that's where our
power<00:01:59.350> is<00:01:59.530> going<00:01:59.710> to<00:01:59.770> concentrate<00:02:00.100> from<00:02:00.850> a

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:00.939 
power is going to concentrate from a

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:04.919 
power is going to concentrate from a
discussion<00:02:01.570> on<00:02:02.049> the<00:02:02.710> legs<00:02:02.950> point<00:02:03.630> from<00:02:04.630> down

00:02:04.919 --> 00:02:04.929 
discussion on the legs point from down

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:08.580 
discussion on the legs point from down
up<00:02:05.320> and<00:02:05.530> the<00:02:05.979> shoulder<00:02:06.429> rotation<00:02:07.090> okay<00:02:08.019> so<00:02:08.470> we

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
up and the shoulder rotation okay so we

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:09.900 
up and the shoulder rotation okay so we
definitely<00:02:08.830> want<00:02:09.160> to<00:02:09.220> work<00:02:09.369> with<00:02:09.429> that<00:02:09.700> catch

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
definitely want to work with that catch

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:13.259 
definitely want to work with that catch
a<00:02:10.090> little<00:02:10.330> bit<00:02:10.420> more<00:02:10.539> as<00:02:10.660> we<00:02:10.780> go<00:02:10.899> back<00:02:11.080> home<00:02:12.269> all
