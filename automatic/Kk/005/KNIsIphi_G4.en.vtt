00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.200 
children around age six and up and it's
basically<00:00:22.529> a<00:00:23.210> platform<00:00:24.210> that<00:00:24.300> contains<00:00:24.869> a

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:26.210 
basically a platform that contains a

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:31.400 
basically a platform that contains a
stage<00:00:27.210> a<00:00:27.570> puppet<00:00:28.320> stage<00:00:28.619> which<00:00:29.039> is<00:00:30.410> connected

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
stage a puppet stage which is connected

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.930 
stage a puppet stage which is connected
to<00:00:31.800> this<00:00:31.949> controller<00:00:32.489> so<00:00:33.420> the<00:00:33.989> controller<00:00:34.469> is

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:34.940 
to this controller so the controller is

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.200 
to this controller so the controller is
can<00:00:35.940> control<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:37.020> movement<00:00:37.440> of<00:00:37.590> the<00:00:37.649> puppets

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:38.210 
can control the movement of the puppets

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.410 
can control the movement of the puppets
the<00:00:39.210> lighting<00:00:39.800> yeah<00:00:40.800> like<00:00:41.010> that<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.579> lighting

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
the lighting yeah like that the lighting

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.660 
the lighting yeah like that the lighting
it<00:00:42.750> can<00:00:43.020> can<00:00:43.559> turn<00:00:43.770> off<00:00:44.010> and<00:00:44.280> turn<00:00:44.340> on<00:00:44.610> the

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
it can can turn off and turn on the

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.729 
it can can turn off and turn on the
lights<00:00:44.969> and<00:00:45.450> you<00:00:45.570> have<00:00:45.719> different<00:00:46.410> colors<00:00:46.710> of

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
lights and you have different colors of

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.330 
lights and you have different colors of
the<00:00:46.980> lighting<00:00:47.370> and<00:00:47.960> also<00:00:48.960> each<00:00:49.469> card<00:00:49.860> kit

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
the lighting and also each card kit

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.740 
the lighting and also each card kit
contains<00:00:51.350> the<00:00:52.350> special<00:00:53.190> circuitry<00:00:53.850> that<00:00:54.030> can

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
contains the special circuitry that can

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.660 
contains the special circuitry that can
be<00:00:54.930> also<00:00:55.350> controlled<00:00:55.949> from<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.250> controller

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
be also controlled from the controller

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.840 
be also controlled from the controller
so<00:00:57.360> if<00:00:57.539> you<00:00:57.690> curse<00:00:57.930> a<00:00:58.140> here<00:00:58.800> you<00:00:59.460> can<00:00:59.640> see<00:00:59.820> that

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
so if you curse a here you can see that

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.570 
so if you curse a here you can see that
the<00:01:00.030> LED<00:01:00.539> is<00:01:00.739> lighting<00:01:01.739> up<00:01:03.110> so<00:01:04.110> basically<00:01:05.010> this

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
the LED is lighting up so basically this

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.450 
the LED is lighting up so basically this
story<00:01:05.880> was<00:01:06.180> designed<00:01:06.600> to<00:01:06.930> encourage

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.460 
story was designed to encourage

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.770 
story was designed to encourage

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
so how did you make this so the the main

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.520 
so how did you make this so the the main
brain<00:01:48.000> of<00:01:48.270> this<00:01:48.420> thing<00:01:48.689> is<00:01:48.930> Arduino

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
brain of this thing is Arduino

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.550 
brain of this thing is Arduino
and<00:01:52.330> basically<00:01:53.330> that's<00:01:53.750> it<00:01:53.990> Arduino

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
and basically that's it Arduino

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.490 
and basically that's it Arduino
connected<00:01:55.040> to<00:01:55.159> a<00:01:55.190> computer<00:01:55.960> after<00:01:56.960> you<00:01:57.290> make

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
connected to a computer after you make

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.500 
connected to a computer after you make
