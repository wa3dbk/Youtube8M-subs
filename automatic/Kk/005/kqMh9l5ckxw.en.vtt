the<00:00:23.340> vessel<00:00:23.880> loops<00:00:24.090> definitely<00:00:24.689> go<00:00:25.380> check<00:00:25.410> it

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
the vessel loops definitely go check it

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.130 
the vessel loops definitely go check it
out<00:00:25.920> I'm<00:00:26.640> a<00:00:26.760> big<00:00:26.970> fan<00:00:27.180> of<00:00:27.210> SL<00:00:27.660> loops<00:00:27.840> I<00:00:27.960> got

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
out I'm a big fan of SL loops I got

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.779 
out I'm a big fan of SL loops I got
about<00:00:28.320> three<00:00:28.560> or<00:00:28.590> four<00:00:28.710> colorways<00:00:29.189> now<00:00:29.490> and

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
about three or four colorways now and

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.609 
about three or four colorways now and
this<00:00:30.480> one's<00:00:30.720> a<00:00:30.810> little<00:00:30.900> different<00:00:31.019> this<00:00:31.410> one

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
this one's a little different this one

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.180 
this one's a little different this one
is<00:00:31.769> more<00:00:31.949> of<00:00:32.070> like<00:00:32.099> an<00:00:32.309> outdoors<00:00:32.759> more<00:00:33.750> rugged

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:34.190 
is more of like an outdoors more rugged

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.190 
is more of like an outdoors more rugged
SL<00:00:35.190> loop<00:00:35.370> because<00:00:35.579> of<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:35.910> bottom<00:00:36.270> so<00:00:36.989> you<00:00:37.050> can

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
SL loop because of the bottom so you can

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.690 
SL loop because of the bottom so you can
see<00:00:37.350> that<00:00:37.380> traction<00:00:37.829> is<00:00:38.160> totally<00:00:38.550> different

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
see that traction is totally different

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.250 
see that traction is totally different
from<00:00:38.910> all<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.149> other<00:00:39.360> SL<00:00:39.780> loops<00:00:39.930> that<00:00:40.050> I<00:00:40.110> have

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
from all the other SL loops that I have

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.819 
from all the other SL loops that I have
it<00:00:40.920> has<00:00:41.100> more<00:00:41.399> of<00:00:41.550> a<00:00:42.410> there's<00:00:43.410> like<00:00:43.559> a<00:00:43.590> lot<00:00:43.800> of

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
it has more of a there's like a lot of

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.380 
it has more of a there's like a lot of
different<00:00:44.190> triangles<00:00:44.610> and<00:00:44.910> things<00:00:45.149> in<00:00:45.300> it

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
different triangles and things in it

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.360 
different triangles and things in it
which<00:00:46.020> is<00:00:46.230> you<00:00:46.530> know<00:00:46.559> which<00:00:46.770> allows<00:00:47.039> for<00:00:47.250> more

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
which is you know which allows for more

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.580 
which is you know which allows for more
traction<00:00:47.730> so<00:00:48.300> some<00:00:49.020> definitely<00:00:49.410> different

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
traction so some definitely different

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.279 
traction so some definitely different
kind<00:00:50.280> of<00:00:50.309> seems<00:00:50.579> like<00:00:50.640> a<00:00:50.730> boot<00:00:51.090> to<00:00:51.329> me<00:00:51.480> by<00:00:52.110> like
