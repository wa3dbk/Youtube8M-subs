00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.580
 we are going against a brand that 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.860
 has really bet very strongly for the 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.740
 club and from the first moment we 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:21.900
 have shown not only not just words 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.910
 but also but also facts 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:28.169
 true that today here is the beginning of 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.489
 a collaboration that commented 

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:31.020
 manolos of four years but I wish 

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:33.450
 continue for many because that 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:35.250
 will mean that the two both days 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.860
 how are we happy with this 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.960
 coloring for our speak opens 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.649
 a very important commercial development 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.910
 at the end from the beginning from what 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.079
 we have clear in this club are the desire 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.269
 that we have to work and the desire that 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.249
 we have to go forward and I think 

00:00:48.269 --> 00:00:51.749
 than with one with a brand as comfort 

00:00:50.249 --> 00:00:54.089
 we have a development a development 

00:00:51.749 --> 00:00:56.039
 very important commercial that as of 

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:58.519
 those of the days will go will be shaped 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:01.019
 well a shirt that has been designed 

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:02.519
 only and exclusively for the club and 

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:04.559
 that has been that has been with the 

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:06.510
 guidelines that have been marked since 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.670
 from the club attending also to the 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.560
 tips to advice to diaz we leave 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.510
 to the market and we find that at 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.119
 final the club is a very interesting club 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.110
 for many trademarks we 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.500
 we had 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:22.140
 eight written offers of brands that 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.270
 they have presented us to dress the claret 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.580
 and things one of those eight brands with 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.470
 our analyzes and with our with 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.050
 our studies of the variables then 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.030
 in the end we bet we bet on 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:35.190
 adidas the contract between adidas and 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.320
 we on behalf of the club are very 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:39.660
 happy is a contract that we believe that 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.620
 it's important and from there we say 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:42.870
 to work 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:44.280
 we are going to develop the same 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:45.390
 also in conjunction with adidas 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.400
 all that is all that is the 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.530
 own club collection in which 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.210
 therefore logically includes clothing not only 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.560
 is the game clothes of the first one is a 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.490
 performance of the goalkeepers the clothes of 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.090
 ride the travel clothes the clothes of 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.160
 Warm up training clothes 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.470
 that is to say that there is a line in a line 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:03.090
 own club very broad 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:06.450
 that we will know and that the 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:09.149
 we will present and that you will have it from 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.860
 from there also with help there will be in the 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.860
 there will be in the store then all the 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:16.730
 part of adidas collection from 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:19.010
 many many sports lines that 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.900
 they have since walk from footwear 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.340
 say that here there are many things for the 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.290
 clothes when troops have a collection 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.300
 very broad simply us here 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.310
 we have come very well we have sold very 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.960
 well then it was also one of the 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.090
 requests by commercial 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:34.100
 our to associate with a club that 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:37.040
 logically has the radio that has a 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:39.110
 club founded in 1920 as 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.030
 logically it was a bit to unite 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.920
 synergies on the one hand 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.060
 logically sponsor a club 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.220
 first division that gives you the 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.660
 visibility that the other hand gives you 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.989
 level of sales that we have 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:53.000
 here and that has been the reason and really 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:55.130
 the truth I would also like to emphasize 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.520
 the reception we have had on the part of 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:03:00.170
 of the club and the professionals who have 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:03.260
 been at all times we have played 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:05.920
 logically with the colors and with the 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:08.390
 design jointly with the club 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.220
 All designs have been approved 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:12.170
 logically the club with the different 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.120
 possibilities that we have 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:16.160
 proposed and there are things with which 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.080
 we are very happy that it is the color 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.300
 really from the shirt 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:22.880
 very elegant and perfectly reflects the 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:24.980
 colors of the athletic club's shield 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:27.110
 osasuna the red has been very good in 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:29.210
 the sole has remained perfect 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:31.700
 exactly as in the shield 

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:33.710
 and we have put a polo neck that 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:38.420
 gives a retro look that we want that fits 

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:41.209
 perfectly with the philosophy of the club 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:42.860
 for now this is the shirt another thing 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:45.410
 that I would like to highlight is in terms of 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:47.000
 technology the technology that we use 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:48.410
 is the best technology that exists in the 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.599
 market that is a technology that is 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:52.700
 flame dida is climacool that what 

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:56.080
 allows is to always keep the 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:58.970
 cool players is to say lets 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:00.680
 evaporate the sweat so more 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:02.330
 fast after the sweat of the part 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:05.060
 internal part of the garment the external part of 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:07.670
 the garment so that it evaporates 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:09.769
 more quickly getting the 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:13.700
 players are always fresh and dry 

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:15.860
 and that we increase the performance 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:19.639
 we have used the best technology that 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:22.550
 we have for one of the most clubs 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:24.050
 historical of the Spanish league and here 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:26.210
 You can also see some more details 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:28.270
 in the back with shield 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:28.270
 Navarre 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:33.960
 and this is basically the shirt with the 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:35.789
 that we wish you the 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:38.759
 that all the objectives of the 

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:40.080
 club and sure it's going to be like that I hope 

00:04:38.759 --> 00:04:41.669
 that this year see if we suffer a little 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:44.039
 less now that we are happy to 

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:46.530
 work with such a great people 

00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:49.080
 professional who have given us facilities 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:51.780
 from the first moment with which he has 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:53.729
 everything has been very easy and we are very 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:58.169
 happy and the second thing that I 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:05:00.509
 would like to highlight is a bit the values 

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:02.099
 that transmits this house and that transmits 

00:05:00.509 --> 00:05:05.160
 this stadium that transmits the salari that 

00:05:02.099 --> 00:05:08.789
 transmits the love of the osasuna of 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:10.919
 honesty delivery of effort 

00:05:08.789 --> 00:05:13.979
 passion are really values â€‹â€‹that 

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:16.979
 we also share fully in adidas 

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:18.690
 and with the brand philosophy that we 

00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:20.400
 we have to say that nothing is impossible 

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:23.099
 we are convinced that with those values 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:25.680
 and this union we can get any 

00:05:23.099 --> 00:05:27.720
 any challenge I'm convinced that it's going to 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:30.690
 be a very beneficial agreement to for 

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:33.610
 both parties as we have commented is for 

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:35.530
 now it 's a is a four-year agreement 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:38.110
 on our part we want in 

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:40.000
 long- term relationships since 

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:41.620
 I am convinced that being a relationship 

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.659
 that will be so beneficial 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:45.659
 we will continue for many years
