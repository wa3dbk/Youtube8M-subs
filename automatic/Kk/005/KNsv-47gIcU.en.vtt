00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
could also be genetic there are a number

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.110 
could also be genetic there are a number

loss it's also a good source of biotin
which<00:01:27.990> is<00:01:28.140> very<00:01:28.320> important<00:01:28.860> in<00:01:29.450> maintaining

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
broccoli also is in that group if you

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.530 
broccoli also is in that group if you
you<00:01:37.590> need<00:01:37.799> protein<00:01:38.430> a<00:01:38.640> good<00:01:39.180> source<00:01:39.420> of

you need protein a good source of

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.800 
you need protein a good source of
protein<00:01:39.900> and<00:01:39.990> Salman<00:01:40.680> is<00:01:41.070> particularly<00:01:41.810> good

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
protein and Salman is particularly good

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.870 
protein and Salman is particularly good
for<00:01:43.350> hair<00:01:44.220> maintenance

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
for hair maintenance

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.190 
for hair maintenance
it<00:01:45.450> contains<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.380> essential<00:01:46.670> oil<00:01:47.670> called

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 
it contains the essential oil called

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.050 
it contains the essential oil called
omega-3<00:01:49.399> that's<00:01:50.399> what<00:01:50.579> you<00:01:50.700> just<00:01:50.729> talked

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
omega-3 that's what you just talked

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.840 
omega-3 that's what you just talked
about<00:01:51.180> but<00:01:51.960> it's<00:01:52.560> also<00:01:52.740> a<00:01:52.890> good<00:01:53.430> thing<00:01:53.490> to<00:01:53.729> have

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
about but it's also a good thing to have

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.660 
about but it's also a good thing to have
for<00:01:54.090> hair<00:01:54.299> because<00:01:54.659> the<00:01:54.869> omega-3<00:01:55.670> contributes

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
for hair because the omega-3 contributes

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.670 
for hair because the omega-3 contributes
to<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:56.969> oil<00:01:57.450> coating<00:01:57.990> of<00:01:58.049> the<00:01:58.170> hair<00:01:58.380> which
