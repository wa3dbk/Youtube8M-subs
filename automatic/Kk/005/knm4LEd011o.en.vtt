 being used for nothing 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:40.850
 Finally, in the end there is still one more 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.620
 another option here is the option is 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:45.450
 applications that who analyze and it 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.550

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.350
 applications that you are no longer 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:51.900
 using what you do not want to connect what 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:53.310
 shows that using the application shows 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.970
 the goals you use the most 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:59.640

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.019
 applications at once then by 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.540

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.160
 applications you are not using the 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.019
