 Hi, I'm Eugenie. 

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:09.610
 Today I am making a 5-element lemon parmesan noodle. 

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:13.960
 For this recipe, you will need to: 

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:17.980
 Pasta, heavy cream, butter, lemon, and parmesan. 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:23.980
 First, cook 4 ounces of pasta as directed by the package. And drain the pasta. 

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:28.900
 In the same pan, melt 1 tablespoon of butter on low heat. 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:36.940
 Mix in 1/4 cup of heavy cream, lemon peel, lemon juice and 1/2 lemon. 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:55.740
 Mix in freshly grated Parmesan cheese as much as you like. 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:01.740
 Finally taste and season with salt and pepper. 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:07.510
 Voila, quick and healthy lemon parmesan pasta. 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:12.580
 When I was a student, this is one of the first pasta I made along with the blue cheese pasta. 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:14.830
 This will make a quick lunch for lemon lovers. 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:20.630
 The side dish will be perfect for turkey or chicken. 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:22.160
 Bon appetite. 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:26.000
 The lemon flavor and parmesan are perfect for me. 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.090
 I simply love this pasta. 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.610
