attention to detail you know it seems as

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.010 
attention to detail you know it seems as
if<00:01:37.820> they've<00:01:38.000> gone<00:01:38.180> to<00:01:38.360> great<00:01:38.540> lengths<00:01:38.899> to

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 
if they've gone to great lengths to

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:40.359 
if they've gone to great lengths to

that with little little chrome fittings
and<00:01:42.500> whatnot<00:01:42.820> it's<00:01:43.820> designed<00:01:44.240> for<00:01:44.420> the<00:01:44.539> kind

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
and whatnot it's designed for the kind

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:46.690 
and whatnot it's designed for the kind
of<00:01:45.140> person<00:01:45.470> that<00:01:45.500> wants<00:01:45.890> to<00:01:45.920> ride<00:01:46.190> rather<00:01:46.490> than

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
spend a lot of time in their bike I

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:50.050 
spend a lot of time in their bike I
think<00:01:48.320> as<00:01:48.890> you<00:01:49.039> look<00:01:49.190> at<00:01:49.310> it<00:01:49.340> it's<00:01:49.610> got<00:01:49.759> a<00:01:49.789> shaft

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
think as you look at it it's got a shaft

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:51.370 
think as you look at it it's got a shaft
drive<00:01:50.210> so<00:01:50.690> there's<00:01:50.869> very<00:01:51.050> little<00:01:51.140> maintenance

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
drive so there's very little maintenance

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.680 
drive so there's very little maintenance
involved<00:01:52.009> there<00:01:52.190> and<00:01:52.429> I<00:01:52.670> guess<00:01:53.240> this<00:01:53.450> type<00:01:53.659> of

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:53.690 
involved there and I guess this type of

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:55.120 
involved there and I guess this type of
detailing<00:01:54.170> with<00:01:54.380> lots<00:01:54.560> of<00:01:54.679> nice<00:01:54.830> chrome

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
fittings and things like that it doesn't

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:57.820 
fittings and things like that it doesn't
require<00:01:56.720> a<00:01:56.929> lot<00:01:57.170> of<00:01:57.259> time<00:01:57.440> and<00:01:57.619> maintenance

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:57.830 
require a lot of time and maintenance

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:03.910

and<00:01:58.340> even<00:01:58.819> cleaning<00:01:59.030> it<00:01:59.210> up<00:02:02.500> this<00:02:03.500> engines<00:02:03.860> a

and even cleaning it up this engines a

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.830 
and even cleaning it up this engines a
lot<00:02:04.100> quieter<00:02:04.460> especially<00:02:05.210> at<00:02:05.300> the<00:02:05.390> top<00:02:05.539> end

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.350 
really often didn't matter what year you
were<00:03:32.709> in<00:03:32.830> if<00:03:33.010> you<00:03:33.130> gave<00:03:33.340> it<00:03:33.459> the<00:03:33.489> gas<00:03:33.760> it<00:03:34.060> would

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:34.360 
were in if you gave it the gas it would

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.170 
were in if you gave it the gas it would
respond<00:03:34.780> well<00:03:35.019> and<00:03:35.549> that<00:03:36.549> seemed<00:03:36.850> to<00:03:36.940> be<00:03:37.000> the

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180 
respond well and that seemed to be the

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.240 
respond well and that seemed to be the
thing<00:03:37.360> that<00:03:37.390> I<00:03:37.540> came<00:03:37.750> away<00:03:37.870> with<00:03:38.170> most<00:03:38.920> of<00:03:39.069> all

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
thing that I came away with most of all

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:42.569 
thing that I came away with most of all
was<00:03:40.000> how<00:03:40.630> well<00:03:40.840> it<00:03:40.930> responded<00:03:41.500> power<00:03:41.950> wise<00:03:42.220> and

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:42.579 
was how well it responded power wise and

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:44.160 
was how well it responded power wise and
that's<00:03:42.850> important<00:03:43.329> to<00:03:43.420> me<00:03:43.570> and<00:03:43.690> anybody<00:03:43.900> who

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:44.170 
that's important to me and anybody who

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:47.069 
that's important to me and anybody who
likes<00:03:44.320> big<00:03:45.130> v-twins<00:03:45.609> clutch<00:03:46.600> traction<00:03:46.959> is

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:47.079 
likes big v-twins clutch traction is

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:48.569 
likes big v-twins clutch traction is
actually<00:03:47.109> quite<00:03:47.590> good<00:03:47.620> it's<00:03:48.040> a<00:03:48.280> hydraulic

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:48.579 
actually quite good it's a hydraulic

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:50.190 
actually quite good it's a hydraulic
clutch<00:03:48.820> you<00:03:49.450> can<00:03:49.600> see<00:03:49.720> with<00:03:49.840> a<00:03:49.900> master

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:50.200 
clutch you can see with a master

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:51.900 
clutch you can see with a master
cylinder<00:03:50.320> here<00:03:50.650> and<00:03:50.709> the<00:03:50.859> leaver<00:03:51.310> is<00:03:51.400> a<00:03:51.459> dogleg

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:51.910 
cylinder here and the leaver is a dogleg

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:53.310 
cylinder here and the leaver is a dogleg
so<00:03:52.180> their<00:03:52.299> reach<00:03:52.420> isn't<00:03:52.720> so<00:03:52.840> high<00:03:52.989> and<00:03:53.260> of

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:53.320 
so their reach isn't so high and of

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.440 
so their reach isn't so high and of
course<00:03:53.500> the<00:03:53.650> leverage<00:03:53.950> is<00:03:54.400> very<00:03:54.730> very<00:03:54.940> light<00:03:55.209> I

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.450 
course the leverage is very very light I

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:58.349 
course the leverage is very very light I
like<00:03:55.989> the<00:03:56.109> controls<00:03:56.440> as<00:03:56.590> well<00:03:56.620> Larry<00:03:57.130> I<00:03:57.640> found

00:03:58.349 --> 00:03:58.359 
like the controls as well Larry I found

00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:00.599 
like the controls as well Larry I found
that<00:03:58.540> the<00:03:59.079> clutch<00:03:59.290> and<00:03:59.470> the<00:03:59.530> brake<00:03:59.769> were<00:04:00.040> were

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:00.609 
that the clutch and the brake were were

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:03.060 
that the clutch and the brake were were
much<00:04:00.850> easier<00:04:00.880> than<00:04:01.750> than<00:04:02.530> the<00:04:02.709> Harley

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:03.070 
much easier than than the Harley

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:05.039 
much easier than than the Harley
equivalent<00:04:03.790> there<00:04:04.420> seem<00:04:04.570> to<00:04:04.600> be<00:04:04.690> lots<00:04:04.930> of

00:04:05.039 --> 00:04:05.049 
equivalent there seem to be lots of

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:07.530 
equivalent there seem to be lots of
braking<00:04:05.380> power<00:04:05.530> yeah<00:04:06.100> it's<00:04:07.060> not<00:04:07.209> the<00:04:07.329> kind<00:04:07.420> of

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
braking power yeah it's not the kind of

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:08.910 
braking power yeah it's not the kind of
bike<00:04:07.690> that<00:04:07.720> you<00:04:07.930> just<00:04:08.109> use<00:04:08.320> two<00:04:08.500> fingers<00:04:08.799> on

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:08.920 
bike that you just use two fingers on

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:10.319 
bike that you just use two fingers on
the<00:04:09.010> front<00:04:09.190> brake<00:04:09.400> and<00:04:09.430> that's<00:04:09.760> it<00:04:09.970> I<00:04:10.150> mean

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:10.329 
the front brake and that's it I mean

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:12.479 
the front brake and that's it I mean
with<00:04:10.870> these<00:04:10.989> types<00:04:11.260> of<00:04:11.320> bikes<00:04:11.500> typically<00:04:11.980> you

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:12.489 
with these types of bikes typically you

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:14.069 
with these types of bikes typically you
use<00:04:12.519> both<00:04:12.910> the<00:04:13.060> front<00:04:13.299> and<00:04:13.390> the<00:04:13.660> back<00:04:13.780> brake

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:14.079 
use both the front and the back brake

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:15.930 
use both the front and the back brake
together<00:04:14.440> and<00:04:14.650> quite<00:04:15.190> heavily<00:04:15.459> to<00:04:15.730> get<00:04:15.850> the

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:15.940 
together and quite heavily to get the

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:19.050 
together and quite heavily to get the
bike<00:04:16.120> to<00:04:16.239> stop<00:04:16.450> but<00:04:16.720> it<00:04:16.989> stopped<00:04:17.320> it<00:04:17.470> does

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.060 
bike to stop but it stopped it does

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:20.520 
bike to stop but it stopped it does
question<00:04:19.810> the<00:04:19.900> bike<00:04:20.080> is<00:04:20.260> an<00:04:20.380> eye-catcher
