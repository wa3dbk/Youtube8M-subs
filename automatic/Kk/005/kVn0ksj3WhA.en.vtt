00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 What the fuck did I make this video 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:07.319
 because I did an interview with speed and 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.300
 son you go lotus so enjoy that you 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:12.030
 inspired to create your YouTube channel 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.250
 then several aspects first the want 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.320
 express myself and currently youtube is a 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.560
 good medium plus spiderman is 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.760
 something that I've been passionate about for years 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.780
 adding that I like the world of 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:26.360
 computer and that's what I want to do 

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:28.880
 which spiderman prefers is the 2002 or 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:30.980
 the recent then momentarily that of 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:34.579
 2002 because it was who marked my childhood 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:36.620
 and I identify with his personality 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:39.890
 which other hero do you like besides 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:42.739
 spiderman another hero that I like let's see 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.750
 many like captain america or iron man and 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:47.570
 hulk but none to such a degree as 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:50.510
 spiderman since art started to 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:52.460
 like spiderman since I was 4 years old 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.619
 started to like spiderman de iu to the 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:57.710
 series of the 90s and I never missed it 

00:00:54.619 --> 00:01:00.589
 I always expected it to be 2 pm to 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.539
 turn on the TV and see which one you think 

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:05.299
 that is the worst series or caricature of 

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:07.520
 spiderman of spectacular spiderman no 

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:10.490
 is that it's bad but the other series 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:13.039
 have liked more here how long you take 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:16.069
 editing your videos because I take 3 to 

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:18.220
 5 hours elaborating the dialogues and as 2 

00:01:16.069 --> 00:01:22.039
 or a little less to edit the video 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:24.310
 and what programs do you use movie maker nothing 

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:26.899
 new and I'm looking at using sony vegas 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:29.600
 which of your videos is the most time 

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:31.549
 that has taken editing the part 3 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.740
 because I had everything ready but the day 

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:35.869
 that I had to upload the video appeared the 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.080
 spider poster with the three villains and 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:40.240
 I had to start again 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:42.880
 which one do you think is the worst movie of 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.500
 spidey definitely the 3 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.510
 I think it will do and I was more interested in 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.370
 marketing that tracking the 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:50.200
 Peter's story I did not go into a 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:52.870
 very bad time and the worst is that only 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:55.510
 it was stuffed and what do you think is the 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:58.030
 best movie the 1 is very emotional 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:59.290
 excellent cast the good suit of me 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.790
 liked but is not with the one 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:03.890
 we identify the original 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:05.750
 good last question what is the 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.390
 movie that you most expect this year 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.970
 obviously the amazing spiderman 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.000
 2 I think we'll finally see what it is 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:15.920
 made in drew to be spiderman 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.810
