00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 and good condition, that is, an error is 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:07.740
 comments I bring gameplay from black ops 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:10.410
 2 playing with the shotgun with the m-12 16 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.280
 om 12 14 good any of these a 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.500
 insurance number that I have done well 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.759
 sure but sure then good 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.650
 let's say you are using this 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.750
 competed is a second part of 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.800
 domain and good is pretty 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.140
 entertaining for what I have to 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.660
 tell you and it's good that you know that 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.369
 come out too much information since 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:28.320
 let's say the e3 is finished does thing 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.240
 of a month the only thing that has been seen new 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.940
 of increase has been as I commented to you ago 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.469
 thing of a six or five days I do not know 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.670
 exactly when that is obvious in 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.829
 videos when he explained that there was a 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.920
 new map that for the purpose is a 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.420
 dynamic map which they were going to draw 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.530
 when I reserved the game because only 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.760
 enter and sell to the people you book 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.890
 the game so if you have not seen 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.629
 I recommend that sometimes the eye and 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.250
 good to remember about the cooperative 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.430
 apparently it has been confirmed the 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.770
 cooperative is to say one of the girls 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.740
 who works in 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:59.990
 in infinity ward when I was yesterday in 

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:01.400
 angels as well say that this 

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:03.320
 girl said I ask a question 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.970
 connection by twitter hey I said 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.200
 exactly how the cooperative is going to be 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.580
 or is going to see cooperative to see some 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.950
 special operations as in the 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.270
 other pigs for example and insurance has 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.370
 said that yes to have cooperative but 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:16.640
 that of increase has not announced anything what 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:18.050
 which means that obviously not 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.810
 you know nothing but yes to see the way 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:23.540
 cooperative is something that at least I 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.340
 I have done enough let's say that in lack 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.900
 in modern warfare 3 more than anything because 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.330
 the modern warfare2 missions were 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.580
 quite pretty entertaining to me 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.990
 I personally did not like the way 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.060
 survival I think it was a 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:37.460
 failure but a real failure but 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.660
 however the mode let's say they seemed 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.310
 special in mode by the way I was 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:41.210
 very entertaining was to play with a 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.440
 friend 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.180
 There are some social operations that 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.590
 they were very complicated and let's say 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.660
 they remain as cooperative missions that 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.340
 in quotation marks they had or did not have anything 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:50.509
 what to do with the story but simply 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.190
 it was a little bit like playing with a 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:53.509
 friend I'm not asking for a way 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:55.729
 cooperative campaign that would win a 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:57.920
 I've always said, but if something 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:00.740
 cooperative gives us better let's say that 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:03.380
 as I tell you an ad nothing 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.149
 weird or anything else innovative or 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.330
 the same are special new who 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:09.770
 know what increase was one thing we have 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.390
 we have known about this but what 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:13.880
 Yes, it is known that there is a new way 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.980
 cooperative some people speculate with 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.180
 that if you are going to be playing and one of one 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.830
 of them is going to be the dog is to say you 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.930
 you are going to control the character and you 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.970
 partner to control the dog or who 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.830
 he knows how to increase nothing has been said 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.560
 which means that obviously 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:30.230
 will confirm or be displayed in the gamescom 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.390
 or at the latest in September 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.190
 eurogamer is that I think it's called and 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.390
 there is how very late they go to 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.970
 announce it but good if I remember correctly 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:40.040
 in the other time they taught cooperative 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.720
 etcetera in gamescom or in august and 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.360
 was where the official launch exists 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.700
 not as it showed the 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.590
 call of the multiplayer revelation 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.350
 duty black ops' you can know 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.730
 surely it is the black targets who 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:54.140
 know if we have hope then but 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.390
 At least we know that the cooperative 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:59.239
 that is quite important 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:00.860
 question is what will they do on the one hand says 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:02.239
 its all that good and because when 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:04.370
 you have even fear saying my mother 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:06.320
 what will do to you do not fit or remain 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.400
 bad or a little bit of the two things I do not know what 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:09.650
 is what you think you see 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:12.379
 the dog seems funny but I 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:13.909
 I would like them to put some plan 

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:15.829
 special operations I would not mind 

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:17.629
 I do not think it's pretty 

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:19.159
 entertained and also preach by 

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:20.599
 example make videos and upload to youtube and 

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:22.159
 others but that can be quite 

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:24.620
 interesting special operations 

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:25.879
 with someone so nothing here I leave you the 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.319
 video I hope you 're always liked 

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:30.849
 with the competed and see you in the 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:30.849
 next not only everyone and we had
