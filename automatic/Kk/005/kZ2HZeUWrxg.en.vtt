00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.929 
over here is helping me hold the other
two<00:01:06.320> I'm<00:01:07.320> using<00:01:07.530> this<00:01:07.650> little<00:01:07.830> cardboard<00:01:08.640> here

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
two I'm using this little cardboard here

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.690 
two I'm using this little cardboard here
just<00:01:09.210> so<00:01:09.710> they<00:01:10.710> don't<00:01:10.740> roll<00:01:11.040> away<00:01:11.189> on<00:01:11.549> my

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
just so they don't roll away on my

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.520 
just so they don't roll away on my
display<00:01:11.909> so<00:01:12.780> I'm<00:01:12.869> going<00:01:12.990> to<00:01:13.049> crack<00:01:13.229> these<00:01:13.380> open

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
display so I'm going to crack these open

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:14.600 
display so I'm going to crack these open
we're<00:01:13.950> going<00:01:14.070> to<00:01:14.130> take<00:01:14.250> a<00:01:14.280> look<00:01:14.430> at<00:01:14.549> the

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
we're going to take a look at the

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.240 
we're going to take a look at the
different<00:01:14.909> figures<00:01:15.500> so<00:01:16.500> here<00:01:16.680> they<00:01:16.830> are<00:01:16.950> all

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
different figures so here they are all

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.030 
different figures so here they are all
opened<00:01:17.700> up<00:01:17.850> now<00:01:18.630> before<00:01:19.350> I<00:01:19.380> pick<00:01:19.590> these<00:01:19.710> up<00:01:19.770> I

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
opened up now before I pick these up I

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.550 
opened up now before I pick these up I
read<00:01:20.220> theories<00:01:20.640> online<00:01:21.119> about<00:01:21.840> how<00:01:22.080> specific

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
read theories online about how specific

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.609 
read theories online about how specific
colors<00:01:23.280> lead<00:01:23.820> to<00:01:24.090> specific<00:01:24.600> characters<00:01:25.200> or

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
colors lead to specific characters or

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.210 
colors lead to specific characters or
how<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.430> certain<00:01:27.090> chase<00:01:27.390> figures<00:01:27.840> would<00:01:28.829> lead

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
how the certain chase figures would lead

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.850 
how the certain chase figures would lead
with<00:01:29.610> certain<00:01:30.000> colors<00:01:30.210> and<00:01:30.720> all<00:01:31.350> kinds<00:01:31.799> of

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
with certain colors and all kinds of

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.840 
with certain colors and all kinds of
stuff<00:01:32.390> so<00:01:33.390> to<00:01:34.290> kind<00:01:34.500> of<00:01:34.619> figure<00:01:35.369> out<00:01:35.520> that

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
stuff so to kind of figure out that

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.260 
stuff so to kind of figure out that
theory<00:01:36.299> I<00:01:36.479> first<00:01:37.470> bought<00:01:37.680> one<00:01:38.579> of<00:01:38.759> every<00:01:39.000> color

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
theory I first bought one of every color

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.899 
theory I first bought one of every color
and<00:01:39.619> oddly<00:01:40.619> enough<00:01:40.680> I<00:01:41.040> got<00:01:41.400> one<00:01:41.670> of<00:01:41.790> each

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
and oddly enough I got one of each

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.569 
and oddly enough I got one of each
character<00:01:42.360> mind<00:01:43.200> you<00:01:43.320> there's<00:01:43.590> 10<00:01:43.890> in<00:01:44.040> total<00:01:44.399> I

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
character mind you there's 10 in total I

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:49.010 
character mind you there's 10 in total I
have<00:01:44.640> only<00:01:45.210> 6<00:01:45.540> here<00:01:45.810> so<00:01:46.560> clearly<00:01:47.420> if<00:01:48.420> I<00:01:48.600> got<00:01:48.780> two

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
have only 6 here so clearly if I got two

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.609 
have only 6 here so clearly if I got two
Reds<00:01:49.320> I<00:01:49.619> wouldn't<00:01:50.369> get<00:01:50.430> the<00:01:50.579> same<00:01:50.790> spider-man

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:51.619 
Reds I wouldn't get the same spider-man

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:53.690 
Reds I wouldn't get the same spider-man
because<00:01:52.619> there<00:01:52.890> would<00:01:53.009> have<00:01:53.100> to<00:01:53.250> be<00:01:53.340> some<00:01:53.549> way

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
because there would have to be some way

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.700 
because there would have to be some way
that<00:01:53.729> I<00:01:53.909> would<00:01:54.090> get<00:01:54.210> Iron<00:01:54.420> Man<00:01:54.689> or<00:01:54.930> one<00:01:55.530> of<00:01:55.649> the

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
that I would get Iron Man or one of the

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.480 
that I would get Iron Man or one of the
other<00:01:55.880> characters<00:01:57.409> so<00:01:58.409> at<00:01:58.649> least<00:01:58.799> that<00:01:58.979> theory

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
other characters so at least that theory

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.219 
other characters so at least that theory
