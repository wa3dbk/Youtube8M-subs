 so obviously it seems to you all 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:13.460
 stupid but really stupid for those 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:14.990
 who are used to doing that but for 

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:16.970
 beginners and well listen it's a 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:17.930
 little bit more complicated so that's 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:19.030
 really a tutorial that addresses 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:21.110
 beginners 

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:22.730
 so I guess you are often 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:23.900
 found in this kind of situation you 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.940
 wander on the internet 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.289
 you see a movie that you like so 

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:29.510
 obviously you want to download it 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:31.940
 so you click on the link that you 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:33.410
 leads to downloading and there you 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:35.930
 find with this kind of file 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:39.440

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:43.010
 hop in torrent format here we can 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:44.420
 see below here and obviously it's 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.070
 not your movie so what are you 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.110
 make this file is absolutely nothing 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.540
 so I'm going to explain 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.309
 precisely how to how to 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:54.500
 use this file there we will need 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:56.390
 to download a little software that 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.920
 is called transmission then obviously 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.210
 there are several torrent client but 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.640
 less personal I advise you that the 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.230
 transmission is the one I use 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.479
 have it really works great 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:08.259
 so why not use that one 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:10.280
 so we go on google chrome 

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:13.270
 I will put you the link in the 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:17.299

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:38.359
 there perfect and we only have to slide 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:40.759
 high school so transmission in your 

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:42.439

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.979
 what are we gonna do 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.110
 reiterated the action agrees to do just 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.740
 before that is to say you walk on 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.840
