right it does have a solar panel and the
solar<00:02:00.490> panel<00:02:00.970> is<00:02:01.149> when<00:02:01.329> the<00:02:01.450> vehicle<00:02:01.659> is

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
solar panel is when the vehicle is

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.590 
solar panel is when the vehicle is
parked<00:02:02.170> in<00:02:02.409> a<00:02:02.890> parking<00:02:03.159> lot<00:02:03.700> on<00:02:04.000> a<00:02:04.030> hot<00:02:04.330> day

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
parked in a parking lot on a hot day

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.160 
parked in a parking lot on a hot day
that<00:02:05.380> solar<00:02:05.679> panel<00:02:06.100> will<00:02:06.340> turn<00:02:06.610> on<00:02:06.850> a<00:02:07.270> fan<00:02:07.960> in

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
that solar panel will turn on a fan in

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:09.719 
that solar panel will turn on a fan in
the<00:02:08.259> rear<00:02:08.470> which<00:02:08.709> will<00:02:08.890> pull<00:02:09.039> all<00:02:09.250> of<00:02:09.280> the<00:02:09.519> hot

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
the rear which will pull all of the hot

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:11.370 
the rear which will pull all of the hot
air<00:02:09.940> out<00:02:10.149> of<00:02:10.179> the<00:02:10.330> inside<00:02:10.630> of<00:02:10.660> the<00:02:10.810> vehicle<00:02:11.019> so

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
air out of the inside of the vehicle so

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:12.960 
air out of the inside of the vehicle so
when<00:02:11.530> you<00:02:11.620> come<00:02:11.830> into<00:02:12.040> your<00:02:12.190> vehicle<00:02:12.610> it

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
when you come into your vehicle it

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:14.430 
when you come into your vehicle it
should<00:02:13.239> be<00:02:13.360> about<00:02:13.450> the<00:02:13.720> same<00:02:13.930> temperature<00:02:14.410> as

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
should be about the same temperature as

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.570 
should be about the same temperature as
the<00:02:14.560> ambient<00:02:15.160> temperature<00:02:15.220> outside<00:02:17.459> look<00:02:18.459> if

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
the ambient temperature outside look if

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.470 
the ambient temperature outside look if
you<00:02:18.700> can<00:02:18.880> get<00:02:19.230> in<00:02:20.230> a<00:02:20.290> plug-in<00:02:20.530> hybrid<00:02:20.709> version

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
you can get in a plug-in hybrid version

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.059 
you can get in a plug-in hybrid version
the<00:02:22.480> equivalent<00:02:22.750> of<00:02:23.019> 20<00:02:23.290> 50<00:02:23.530> miles<00:02:23.739> per<00:02:23.890> gallon

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:24.069 
the equivalent of 20 50 miles per gallon

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:26.160 
the equivalent of 20 50 miles per gallon
Saturday's<00:02:24.580> and<00:02:25.450> these<00:02:25.840> people<00:02:26.140> are

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
Saturday's and these people are

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.590 
Saturday's and these people are
demonstrating<00:02:26.860> it<00:02:27.010> then<00:02:27.700> obviously<00:02:28.030> this<00:02:28.450> is

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
demonstrating it then obviously this is

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.240 
demonstrating it then obviously this is
not<00:02:28.630> the<00:02:28.870> technology<00:02:29.170> to<00:02:29.440> the<00:02:29.590> future<00:02:29.920> this<00:02:30.100> is

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
not the technology to the future this is

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.100 
not the technology to the future this is
technology<00:02:30.549> that's<00:02:30.850> here<00:02:31.060> now<00:02:31.239> and<00:02:31.690> we<00:02:31.989> should

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
technology that's here now and we should

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:33.330 
technology that's here now and we should
be<00:02:32.170> doing<00:02:32.319> on<00:02:32.500> a<00:02:32.530> big<00:02:32.739> scale<00:02:32.950> there's<00:02:33.220> no

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
be doing on a big scale there's no

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.640 
be doing on a big scale there's no
excuse
