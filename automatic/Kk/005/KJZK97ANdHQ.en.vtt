00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.259
 and so friends hello to all he decided to take off 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.429
 Here is a video because again was 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:14.880
 the question itself was such a question 

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:19.439
 Does the engine fit up to 15 of us 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:22.830
 generator substations on the motoblock here 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.420
 after a while, let's say, well, just 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.180
 motoblock its own engine on the motoblock already 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:31.349
 did but after the time I purchased here 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:33.739
 such a new engine d15b tu over kudos 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.940
 defense you are clearly in color 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:38.059
 such engines were installed on 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.280
 all kinds of motor pumps 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:42.440
 in the military so let's say the technique on 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.059
 generators 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:47.100
 Well acquired such a brand new 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:51.480
 engine engine 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:56.010
 Now I will show you the sign here 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:01:05.369
 plate is the engine where 15 4 uniform 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:08.970
 force 3000 rpm year release 1986 at 85 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:13.110
 86 before this engine is older than me alone 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:15.960
 year so but that's not the engine 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.030
 brand new it all works 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.520
 fully equipped 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.280
 factory I did not climb anywhere 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:33.360
 would plant but just be a question now 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:38.460
 try to explain but at d15b 25 this 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:40.740
 here is the seat they have on the same 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:44.130
 all engines 15-25 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:47.729
 all this is similar to ut-1 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.920
 and ud-2 is completely different here vd1 and 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:54.500
 vd2 to about motor-block, too, is no longer 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:59.000
 put on long or 15 or 25 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:02.399
 because here it is this place is similar 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.100
 happens on some engines at me 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.750
 even there stands beams in it 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.849
 inside flywheel and starter 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.000
 but it is exactly on the generators 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:14.120
 it don't know moore spomb from where 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.770
 the engine was also calling there too 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:19.670
 removes the entire cone on their shafts 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:22.370
 all the same 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:25.400
 the engine can even be put on mb 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:29.810
 Well, on a simple walk-up tractor , such as 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:32.330
 For example, they are even nominally for what I 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.400
 I wonâ€™t say exactly what kind of tiller 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:37.280
 set to 15 but I know for sure that 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:39.920
 this engine was installed even 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:43.090
 you can now with this pulley easily 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:45.590
 put us this wog in mb 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.970
 nmt for naturally here it is necessary to remove the pulley 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:50.209
 put the basket 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.750
 same it freely will approach on the motor-block 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:53.330
 mts 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:57.680
 in my practice was a case that at 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:03:01.430
 motoblock mts 12 in my opinion to 12 put 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:03.400
 engine with a 100 generator 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.989
 generators purchased the engine and 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:10.970
 put everything fit everything works everything 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:13.820
 clearly so friends if something like that 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:15.560
 motor i think even they are so much 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:18.080
 let's say better because excuse me on 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:21.230
 defense all went all the most so clear 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:24.410
 and everything else with a marriage with small 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:26.090
 there with elevated gaps already going on 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:27.739
 all sorts of enterprises on the defense as 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:33.110
 the rule goes absolutely perfect 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:39.500
 engine and so here's an engine 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:42.560
 I purchased a brand new one and not at all 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:44.239
 I do not regret the steering wheel which engine but 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.420
 now me stock whether he can in 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:49.519
 I will put it on my walker 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:55.820
 maybe somewhere else but I'm very honest 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:59.450
 I will say glad such a purchase price of the issue is not 

00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:02.150
 very big but I have not announced it so 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:04.220
 will then say all sorts of comments 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:05.690
 but honestly what's the price for this 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:10.990
 the engine is very small 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:17.500
 where he bought it here 

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:22.420
 we all work today too 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:25.170
 it works everything works so something 

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:29.850
 do so thank you all for watching 

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:29.850
 all health and all the luck
