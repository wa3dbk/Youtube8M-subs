schedule with other things
so<00:00:26.689> today<00:00:27.689> I've<00:00:28.320> made<00:00:28.529> a<00:00:29.250> scar<00:00:30.090> hybrid<00:00:30.869> I<00:00:31.109> am

so today I've made a scar hybrid I am

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.330 
so today I've made a scar hybrid I am
calling<00:00:32.700> today<00:00:32.910> hybrid<00:00:33.450> because<00:00:34.200> it<00:00:34.559> is<00:00:34.739> more

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
calling today hybrid because it is more

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.330 
calling today hybrid because it is more
of<00:00:35.460> a<00:00:35.520> mix<00:00:35.760> between<00:00:35.910> an<00:00:36.270> assault<00:00:36.780> rifle<00:00:37.170> and<00:00:37.380> an

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
of a mix between an assault rifle and an

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:44.299 
of a mix between an assault rifle and an
SMG<00:00:39.559> so<00:00:41.120> the<00:00:42.120> reason<00:00:42.480> for<00:00:42.510> that<00:00:42.809> is<00:00:43.230> I<00:00:43.649> planned

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
SMG so the reason for that is I planned

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.160 
SMG so the reason for that is I planned
for<00:00:44.840> just<00:00:45.840> regular<00:00:46.410> scars<00:00:47.039> I<00:00:47.340> saw<00:00:47.879> a<00:00:47.910> rifle<00:00:48.360> but

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.360 
for just regular scars I saw a rifle but
I<00:00:49.200> messed<00:00:49.680> up<00:00:49.890> in<00:00:50.160> some<00:00:50.840> measuring<00:00:51.840> and<00:00:52.370> some

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
I messed up in some measuring and some

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.450 
I messed up in some measuring and some
pieces<00:00:53.760> and<00:00:54.030> stuff<00:00:54.539> and<00:00:55.410> it<00:00:55.559> came<00:00:55.829> out<00:00:56.010> a<00:00:56.039> lot

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
pieces and stuff and it came out a lot

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.479 
pieces and stuff and it came out a lot
smaller<00:00:56.910> than<00:00:57.149> intended<00:00:57.660> so<00:00:58.530> like<00:00:59.010> right<00:00:59.280> here

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
smaller than intended so like right here

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.619 
smaller than intended so like right here
on<00:00:59.609> screen<00:01:00.320> like<00:01:01.320> that's<00:01:01.739> what<00:01:02.039> I<00:01:02.070> had<00:01:02.430> and<00:01:03.030> I'm

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
on screen like that's what I had and I'm

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.630 
on screen like that's what I had and I'm
like<00:01:03.809> this<00:01:04.019> is<00:01:04.260> way<00:01:04.470> too<00:01:04.530> small<00:01:05.040> being<00:01:05.369> sawed

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
like this is way too small being sawed

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.859 
like this is way too small being sawed
Highfill<00:01:06.119> so<00:01:07.850> just<00:01:08.850> call<00:01:09.150> it<00:01:09.330> a<00:01:09.390> hybrid<00:01:09.600> I

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
Highfill so just call it a hybrid I

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.670 
Highfill so just call it a hybrid I
guess<00:01:10.130> but<00:01:11.130> uh<00:01:11.810> it's<00:01:12.810> got<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.140> feel<00:01:13.320> of<00:01:13.380> both

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
guess but uh it's got the feel of both

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:14.270 
guess but uh it's got the feel of both
worlds

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
worlds

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.840 
worlds
