bottle of water issue fighting messily
in<00:01:42.430> Michigan<00:01:43.430> and<00:01:43.670> I<00:01:44.240> just<00:01:44.570> felt<00:01:44.869> after<00:01:45.410> some

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
in Michigan and I just felt after some

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:46.840 
in Michigan and I just felt after some
time<00:01:45.740> that<00:01:45.950> I<00:01:46.009> was<00:01:46.100> on<00:01:46.190> the<00:01:46.250> wrong<00:01:46.369> side<00:01:46.700> the

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:46.850 
time that I was on the wrong side the

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.050 
time that I was on the wrong side the
issue<00:01:46.970> and<00:01:47.869> so<00:01:47.900> I<00:01:48.110> thought<00:01:48.500> maybe<00:01:48.820> get<00:01:49.820> some

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
issue and so I thought maybe get some

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.270 
issue and so I thought maybe get some
kind<00:01:50.330> of<00:01:50.360> perspective<00:01:50.570> on<00:01:50.960> this<00:01:51.140> yes<00:01:51.979> it'd<00:01:52.160> be

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
kind of perspective on this yes it'd be
