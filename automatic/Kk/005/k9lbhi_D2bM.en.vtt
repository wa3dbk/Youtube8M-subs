00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:14.860 
battery is very good now if i had the

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:16.920 
battery is very good now if i had the
stock<00:03:15.190> battery<00:03:15.550> in<00:03:15.880> this<00:03:16.030> thing<00:03:16.090> i<00:03:16.630> would

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
stock battery in this thing i would

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:18.420 
stock battery in this thing i would
definitely<00:03:17.410> not<00:03:17.590> have<00:03:17.650> gotten<00:03:17.980> the<00:03:18.100> battery

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
definitely not have gotten the battery

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:20.789 
definitely not have gotten the battery
life<00:03:18.580> that<00:03:18.820> I<00:03:18.850> got<00:03:19.209> out<00:03:19.420> of<00:03:19.450> this<00:03:19.750> then<00:03:20.140> if<00:03:20.170> I

00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:20.799 
life that I got out of this then if I

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:24.360 
life that I got out of this then if I
had<00:03:20.980> just<00:03:21.130> the<00:03:21.250> stock<00:03:21.489> better<00:03:21.790> so<00:03:22.239> I<00:03:23.130> do<00:03:24.130> like

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
had just the stock better so I do like

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:26.520 
had just the stock better so I do like
that<00:03:24.400> I<00:03:24.940> think<00:03:25.480> that<00:03:25.690> my<00:03:25.840> favorite<00:03:26.110> feature

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
that I think that my favorite feature

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:29.970 
that I think that my favorite feature
this<00:03:26.860> whole<00:03:27.040> setup<00:03:27.280> is<00:03:27.519> that<00:03:27.790> this<00:03:28.299> case<00:03:28.980> it's

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
this whole setup is that this case it's

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.940 
this whole setup is that this case it's
it's<00:03:30.459> probably<00:03:31.120> the<00:03:31.299> best<00:03:31.540> case<00:03:31.900> that<00:03:32.709> you're

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
it's probably the best case that you're

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:36.060 
it's probably the best case that you're
going<00:03:33.070> to<00:03:33.160> get<00:03:33.370> for<00:03:33.700> an<00:03:33.790> extended<00:03:34.209> battery<00:03:35.070> no

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:11.920 
have to get the dialects but you're

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:14.699 
have to get the dialects but you're

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:22.660 
that we're used to on the note 3 now it

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:25.320 
that we're used to on the note 3 now it
does<00:04:22.840> add<00:04:23.140> some<00:04:23.470> bulk<00:04:23.910> but<00:04:24.910> I<00:04:24.940> mean<00:04:25.210> that's

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.330 
does add some bulk but I mean that's

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:26.950 
does add some bulk but I mean that's
almost<00:04:25.539> to<00:04:25.750> be<00:04:25.870> expected<00:04:25.900> you<00:04:26.470> haven't

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 
almost to be expected you haven't

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.050 
almost to be expected you haven't
standard<00:04:27.259> battery<00:04:27.620> everything<00:04:28.520> works<00:04:28.880> out

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:29.060 
standard battery everything works out

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.770 
standard battery everything works out
really<00:04:29.300> well<00:04:29.419> you<00:04:30.259> got<00:04:30.410> access<00:04:30.830> to<00:04:30.889> the<00:04:31.100> s<00:04:31.250> pen

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:31.780 
really well you got access to the s pen

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:34.480 
really well you got access to the s pen
it's<00:04:32.780> really<00:04:32.930> used<00:04:33.139> to<00:04:33.229> get<00:04:33.440> to<00:04:33.650> I<00:04:33.919> mean<00:04:34.220> full

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:42.080 
suffocation it's not too hard to put

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.339 
suffocation it's not too hard to put
back<00:04:42.199> on<00:04:43.120> you<00:04:44.120> just<00:04:44.240> put<00:04:44.360> it<00:04:44.539> back<00:04:44.690> on<00:04:44.870> like<00:04:45.319> a

00:04:45.339 --> 00:04:45.349 
back on you just put it back on like a

00:04:45.349 --> 00:04:48.249 
back on you just put it back on like a
silicon<00:04:45.889> layer<00:04:46.449> and<00:04:47.449> I<00:04:47.630> had<00:04:47.780> to<00:04:47.870> do<00:04:47.990> this<00:04:48.110> a<00:04:48.169> few

00:04:48.249 --> 00:04:48.259 
silicon layer and I had to do this a few

00:04:48.259 --> 00:04:50.980 
silicon layer and I had to do this a few
times<00:04:48.440> just<00:04:48.740> to<00:04:48.889> get<00:04:49.039> to<00:04:49.130> my<00:04:49.220> SD<00:04:49.400> card<00:04:49.849> and<00:04:50.120> I'm

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:18.080 
combo I think it's a good deal it's a

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:19.810 
combo I think it's a good deal it's a
little<00:06:18.320> bit<00:06:18.409> more<00:06:18.500> pricey<00:06:18.800> than<00:06:19.039> some<00:06:19.669> of<00:06:19.729> the

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:19.820 
little bit more pricey than some of the

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:22.120 
little bit more pricey than some of the
other<00:06:20.030> manufacturers<00:06:20.960> out<00:06:21.139> there<00:06:21.199> but<00:06:21.860> i

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:22.130 
other manufacturers out there but i

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:24.279 
other manufacturers out there but i
think<00:06:22.759> the<00:06:22.849> deal<00:06:23.030> breaker<00:06:23.509> and<00:06:23.750> the<00:06:23.960> big

00:06:24.279 --> 00:06:24.289 
think the deal breaker and the big

00:06:24.289 --> 00:06:26.290 
think the deal breaker and the big
difference<00:06:25.280> between<00:06:25.610> the<00:06:25.729> rest<00:06:25.909> of<00:06:26.060> them<00:06:26.210> is

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:26.300 
difference between the rest of them is

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:30.909 
difference between the rest of them is
the<00:06:26.509> case<00:06:26.780> the<00:06:27.590> case<00:06:27.830> is<00:06:28.099> what<00:06:28.400> i<00:06:29.740> would<00:06:30.740> say

00:06:30.909 --> 00:06:30.919 
the case the case is what i would say

00:06:30.919 --> 00:06:32.770 
the case the case is what i would say
would<00:06:31.070> be<00:06:31.130> the<00:06:31.340> selling<00:06:31.759> point<00:06:32.030> of<00:06:32.270> this<00:06:32.570> whole
