00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:15.650
 she greets everyone knows pitt I 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:17.540
 do not know if you're already laying the 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:20.119
 question but are you already 

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:23.390
 asked what is the perspective of a 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:26.930
 very funny sphere of question is this 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:28.610
 not a sphere so that of course 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:31.400
 that a perspective like any object in 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:33.440
 the space the problem is that when we 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.730
 see a sphere we show them its share 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.559
 a circle and a circle 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.390
 well it means absolutely nothing to say 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:41.420
 we in the questions represent a 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:43.760
 cube to the already it speaks to us more because 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:47.380
 that these more three-dimensional jobs ya 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:49.550
 already more dar es you already feel more 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:51.530
 the vanishing lines 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:56.930
 the vanishing points and deformation of 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:01:00.579
 the space so in fact the best it is 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:04.339
 to represent a cube around a sphere 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:08.479
 it's this cube that will determine which 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:09.920
 is the perspective so 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:12.259
 from the moment you see a 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.369
 sphere says you have I will try to 

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:17.050
 represent a cube and I will give 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:17.050
 an orientation to his sister 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.130
 no 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:39.240
 I did exactly the same thing 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:43.950
 now with a cube seen in saas and 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:45.270
 an under-dive so I represent the 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.220
 sphere inside that's going to be a 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:52.979
 little bit oval but you understood 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:55.380
 the idea so there I actually in late 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:02:04.530
 account I just returned the cube 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:06.860
 around the sphere and if I want 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.860
 now 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.760
 to use something else to determine 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.790
 the orientation of a sphere and well that's 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:19.460
 very simple I will use an ellipse 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:21.210
 inside the sphere so 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:22.770
 the ellipse that I'm going to represent at 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:26.030
 the inside of the sphere is actually 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:29.970
 as a cross section 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:34.140
 the ellipse will cut the sphere in half 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:35.280
 equal parts in the perspective so 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.670
 the books inside a sphere 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:40.709
 can also be used to determine the 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:43.580
 direction of light when we want 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:45.450
 represent the values ​​of a greenhouse 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:47.040
 that was the advice of the day 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.110
 I hope it served you 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:52.130
 and then I tell you very quickly for a 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.130
 other video lease
