young<00:02:54.540> prospect<00:02:55.200> but<00:02:55.380> i<00:02:55.440> would<00:02:55.590> say<00:02:55.740> he's<00:02:56.520> more

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
young prospect but i would say he's more

box<00:02:57.090> to<00:02:57.450> box<00:02:57.690> then<00:02:58.110> defensive-minded

00:02:58.700 --> 00:02:58.710 
box to box then defensive-minded

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:00.710 
box to box then defensive-minded
midfielder<00:02:59.640> and<00:02:59.760> I<00:02:59.820> think<00:03:00.030> that<00:03:00.150> matic<00:03:00.510> is<00:03:00.660> a

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
midfielder and I think that matic is a

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.020 
midfielder and I think that matic is a
player<00:03:01.140> that<00:03:01.170> we<00:03:01.470> need<00:03:01.710> and<00:03:01.950> that<00:03:02.010> you<00:03:02.910> know<00:03:03.000> I

player that we need and that you know I

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:04.010 
player that we need and that you know I

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:04.020 
think we need something that can dictate

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:06.050 
think we need something that can dictate
the<00:03:04.320> pace<00:03:04.350> you<00:03:04.740> can<00:03:04.890> make<00:03:05.040> the<00:03:05.160> great<00:03:05.400> passes

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
the pace you can make the great passes

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.090 
the pace you can make the great passes
that<00:03:06.390> can<00:03:06.540> you<00:03:06.660> know<00:03:06.690> unlock<00:03:07.350> defences<00:03:07.560> and

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
that can you know unlock defences and

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.300 
that can you know unlock defences and
okay<00:03:08.970> and<00:03:09.000> can<00:03:09.450> be<00:03:09.630> very<00:03:09.990> very<00:03:10.320> solid<00:03:10.860> in<00:03:11.010> front

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310

at<00:03:11.400> the<00:03:11.430> back<00:03:11.700> for<00:03:12.150> I<00:03:12.420> think<00:03:12.930> that<00:03:13.050> he's

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
at the back for I think that he's

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.440 
at the back for I think that he's
everything<00:03:14.040> that<00:03:14.220> Chelsea<00:03:14.820> needs<00:03:15.060> and<00:03:15.300> any

everything that Chelsea needs and any

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.150 
everything that Chelsea needs and any
chance<00:03:15.810> he<00:03:15.990> find<00:03:16.230> that<00:03:16.350> things<00:03:16.530> different<00:03:17.040> a

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
chance he find that things different a

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.020 
chance he find that things different a
stupid<00:03:17.910> because<00:03:18.320> he<00:03:19.320> is<00:03:19.620> what<00:03:20.070> we<00:03:20.190> need<00:03:20.220> he<00:03:20.760> is

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
stupid because he is what we need he is

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.750
