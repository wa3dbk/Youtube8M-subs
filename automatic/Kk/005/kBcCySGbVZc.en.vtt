00:02:21.649 --> 00:02:21.659 
mentally demanding people just kind of

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:23.449 
mentally demanding people just kind of
naturally<00:02:22.170> have<00:02:22.319> a<00:02:22.349> sense<00:02:23.010> of<00:02:23.129> how<00:02:23.250> to<00:02:23.280> work

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
naturally have a sense of how to work

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:26.059 
naturally have a sense of how to work
with<00:02:23.519> sticks<00:02:23.969> and<00:02:24.239> once<00:02:24.900> you<00:02:25.109> you<00:02:25.799> get<00:02:25.950> the

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
with sticks and once you you get the

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:29.300 
with sticks and once you you get the
style<00:02:26.340> of<00:02:26.609> what<00:02:27.090> he's<00:02:27.239> working<00:02:27.450> with<00:02:27.659> it<00:02:28.439> seems

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
style of what he's working with it seems

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.770 
style of what he's working with it seems
kind<00:02:29.579> of<00:02:29.670> natural<00:02:30.030> to<00:02:30.239> to<00:02:30.719> do<00:02:30.840> the<00:02:30.959> process<00:02:32.780> all

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
kind of natural to to do the process all

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.539 
kind of natural to to do the process all
the<00:02:33.900> wood<00:02:34.019> came<00:02:34.200> from<00:02:34.379> st.<00:02:34.620> John's<00:02:34.829> Arboretum

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:35.549 
the wood came from st. John's Arboretum

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:38.360 
the wood came from st. John's Arboretum
so<00:02:35.819> we<00:02:35.909> harvest<00:02:36.239> it<00:02:36.359> all<00:02:36.480> on-site<00:02:37.159> the<00:02:38.159> willow

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
so we harvest it all on-site the willow

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.640 
so we harvest it all on-site the willow
it<00:02:38.909> replenished<00:02:39.480> itself<00:02:39.810> very<00:02:40.079> quickly<00:02:40.319> and

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
it replenished itself very quickly and

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.649 
it replenished itself very quickly and
so<00:02:41.250> we<00:02:41.519> wanted<00:02:41.730> to<00:02:41.819> get<00:02:41.909> it<00:02:42.060> from<00:02:42.180> as<00:02:42.299> close<00:02:42.359> as

00:02:42.649 --> 00:02:42.659 
so we wanted to get it from as close as

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:44.240 
so we wanted to get it from as close as
we<00:02:42.780> could<00:02:42.959> and<00:02:43.200> the<00:02:43.409> Ironwood<00:02:43.769> we<00:02:43.950> actually

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
we could and the Ironwood we actually

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:45.679 
we could and the Ironwood we actually
wanted<00:02:44.489> to<00:02:44.639> thin<00:02:44.849> out<00:02:45.000> so<00:02:45.180> that<00:02:45.329> different

00:02:45.679 --> 00:02:45.689 
wanted to thin out so that different

00:02:45.689 --> 00:02:47.839 
wanted to thin out so that different
trees<00:02:45.930> could<00:02:46.139> take<00:02:46.319> root<00:02:46.500> in<00:02:46.680> that<00:02:46.709> area<00:02:47.159> so<00:02:47.730> we

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:47.849 
trees could take root in that area so we

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:49.250 
trees could take root in that area so we
were<00:02:47.909> helping<00:02:48.150> them<00:02:48.359> fulfill<00:02:48.569> their<00:02:48.750> mission

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
were helping them fulfill their mission

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.659 
were helping them fulfill their mission
but<00:02:49.590> if<00:02:49.709> they<00:02:49.859> were<00:02:49.950> helping<00:02:50.189> us<00:02:50.489> fulfill

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:50.669 
but if they were helping us fulfill

00:02:50.669 --> 00:02:54.319 
but if they were helping us fulfill
hours<00:02:51.799> it<00:02:52.799> took<00:02:53.040> a<00:02:53.189> long<00:02:53.430> time<00:02:53.459> to<00:02:53.819> gather<00:02:54.090> all

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:54.329 
hours it took a long time to gather all

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:56.690 
hours it took a long time to gather all
those<00:02:54.510> materials<00:02:54.689> we<00:02:55.500> had<00:02:55.620> over<00:02:55.829> ten<00:02:56.069> loads<00:02:56.250> in

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
those materials we had over ten loads in

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.360 
those materials we had over ten loads in
a<00:02:56.879> tractor<00:02:57.209> trailer<00:02:57.530> that<00:02:58.530> we<00:02:58.889> weighed<00:02:59.069> one<00:02:59.280> of

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
a tractor trailer that we weighed one of

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.879 
a tractor trailer that we weighed one of
them<00:02:59.489> that<00:02:59.669> was<00:02:59.819> 3,300<00:03:00.569> pounds<00:03:00.959> so<00:03:01.260> there's

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:01.889 
them that was 3,300 pounds so there's

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:04.009 
them that was 3,300 pounds so there's
over<00:03:02.099> 15<00:03:02.519> tons<00:03:02.849> of<00:03:03.030> material<00:03:03.540> in<00:03:03.840> that

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
over 15 tons of material in that

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:07.009 
over 15 tons of material in that
structure<00:03:04.730> it<00:03:05.730> was<00:03:05.849> dusty<00:03:06.209> it<00:03:06.629> was<00:03:06.750> dirty

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
structure it was dusty it was dirty

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:09.289 
structure it was dusty it was dirty
we're<00:03:07.650> sweating<00:03:08.010> it<00:03:08.189> was<00:03:08.280> hot<00:03:08.459> humid<00:03:08.730> out<00:03:09.000> and

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:09.299 
we're sweating it was hot humid out and

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:11.449 
we're sweating it was hot humid out and
at<00:03:10.019> the<00:03:10.200> end<00:03:10.319> of<00:03:10.409> those<00:03:10.500> two<00:03:10.769> days<00:03:10.919> we<00:03:11.219> thought

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
at the end of those two days we thought

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:13.429 
at the end of those two days we thought
the<00:03:11.909> hard<00:03:12.090> part's<00:03:12.359> over<00:03:12.480> thank<00:03:12.870> God<00:03:12.989> we<00:03:13.169> can<00:03:13.290> go

00:03:13.429 --> 00:03:13.439 
the hard part's over thank God we can go

00:03:13.439 --> 00:03:15.319 
the hard part's over thank God we can go
take<00:03:14.129> it<00:03:14.159> easy<00:03:14.430> and<00:03:14.700> work<00:03:14.849> with<00:03:15.000> the<00:03:15.090> sticks

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:15.329 
take it easy and work with the sticks

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:18.140 
take it easy and work with the sticks
on-site<00:03:15.750> now<00:03:15.959> and<00:03:16.319> then<00:03:16.829> that's<00:03:17.790> when<00:03:18.120> I

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
on-site now and then that's when I

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:19.939 
on-site now and then that's when I
realized<00:03:18.599> that<00:03:18.840> the<00:03:19.319> hard<00:03:19.500> part<00:03:19.680> was<00:03:19.799> just

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:19.949 
realized that the hard part was just

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:24.280 
realized that the hard part was just
beginning<00:03:22.129> we're<00:03:23.129> bending<00:03:23.400> sticks<00:03:23.970> and

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 
beginning we're bending sticks and

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:26.390 
beginning we're bending sticks and
oftentimes<00:03:25.290> these<00:03:25.500> are<00:03:25.560> Ironwood<00:03:26.099> that<00:03:26.280> are

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
oftentimes these are Ironwood that are

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.369 
oftentimes these are Ironwood that are
three<00:03:26.879> inches<00:03:27.150> around<00:03:27.299> and<00:03:27.750> trying<00:03:28.109> to<00:03:28.199> bend

00:03:28.369 --> 00:03:28.379 
three inches around and trying to bend

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:31.550 
three inches around and trying to bend
those<00:03:28.590> through<00:03:28.919> so<00:03:29.609> it<00:03:29.760> was<00:03:29.879> it<00:03:30.389> was<00:03:30.449> hard<00:03:30.780> it's

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
those through so it was it was hard it's

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.150 
those through so it was it was hard it's
called<00:03:31.859> stick<00:03:32.129> work<00:03:32.310> Bertie

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:34.160 
called stick work Bertie

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.460 
called stick work Bertie
to<00:03:35.160> give<00:03:35.310> it<00:03:35.430> the<00:03:35.640> the<00:03:35.970> leaning<00:03:36.330> structure<00:03:37.050> we

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
to give it the the leaning structure we

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:39.140 
to give it the the leaning structure we
would<00:03:37.650> tie<00:03:37.860> the<00:03:37.920> Ironwood<00:03:38.550> to<00:03:38.970> the

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
would tie the Ironwood to the

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.960 
would tie the Ironwood to the
scaffolding<00:03:39.660> with<00:03:40.320> twine<00:03:40.860> so<00:03:41.550> we<00:03:41.670> ended<00:03:41.910> up

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
scaffolding with twine so we ended up

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:43.790 
scaffolding with twine so we ended up
using<00:03:42.030> quite<00:03:42.420> a<00:03:42.450> bit<00:03:42.600> swine<00:03:42.870> just<00:03:43.560> to<00:03:43.650> give<00:03:43.770> it

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:43.800 
using quite a bit swine just to give it

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.370 
using quite a bit swine just to give it
that<00:03:43.920> leaning<00:03:44.430> look<00:03:44.670> and<00:03:44.940> then<00:03:45.420> once<00:03:45.660> we<00:03:46.170> put

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
that leaning look and then once we put

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:48.170 
that leaning look and then once we put
in<00:03:46.530> lots<00:03:47.010> of<00:03:47.100> other<00:03:47.280> Ironwood<00:03:47.850> and<00:03:47.880> more

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
in lots of other Ironwood and more

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.510 
in lots of other Ironwood and more
willow<00:03:48.510> the<00:03:49.380> tension<00:03:49.800> held<00:03:49.980> it<00:03:50.070> together<00:03:50.190> and

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:50.520 
willow the tension held it together and

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:55.520 
willow the tension held it together and
we<00:03:50.610> removed<00:03:50.940> all<00:03:51.060> the<00:03:51.180> twine<00:03:54.170> it's<00:03:55.170> a<00:03:55.320> very

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
we removed all the twine it's a very

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.500 
we removed all the twine it's a very
solid<00:03:55.860> structure<00:03:56.250> I'm<00:03:56.820> pretty<00:03:57.030> confident<00:03:57.390> you

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
solid structure I'm pretty confident you

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 
could drive a truck into it and it would

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.130 
could drive a truck into it and it would
not<00:03:59.280> move<00:03:59.520> the<00:04:00.390> only<00:04:00.540> thing<00:04:00.690> I'll<00:04:00.840> take<00:04:01.050> it

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 
not move the only thing I'll take it

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:08.300 
not move the only thing I'll take it
down<00:04:01.260> this<00:04:01.440> time<00:04:06.200> the<00:04:07.200> reaction<00:04:08.040> from<00:04:08.220> the

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:39.360 
connected it too and they all had

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.630 
connected it too and they all had
questions<00:04:39.510> about<00:04:40.050> how<00:04:40.140> did<00:04:40.290> we<00:04:40.380> do<00:04:40.530> it<00:04:40.640> what

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:41.640 
questions about how did we do it what

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:43.400 
questions about how did we do it what
kind<00:04:41.850> of<00:04:41.940> wood<00:04:42.120> was<00:04:42.390> it<00:04:42.600> so<00:04:42.900> I<00:04:42.930> felt<00:04:43.170> like<00:04:43.260> they

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:43.410 
kind of wood was it so I felt like they

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:45.050 
kind of wood was it so I felt like they
were<00:04:43.440> learning<00:04:43.740> about<00:04:43.950> issues<00:04:44.910> of

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:45.060 
were learning about issues of

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:47.570 
were learning about issues of
sustainability<00:04:45.690> and<00:04:46.020> art<00:04:46.230> in<00:04:46.590> this<00:04:46.980> indirect

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:47.580 
sustainability and art in this indirect

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:50.060 
sustainability and art in this indirect
way<00:04:47.960> it<00:04:48.960> didn't<00:04:49.200> really<00:04:49.470> hit<00:04:49.620> me<00:04:49.680> until<00:04:49.800> I

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:50.070 
way it didn't really hit me until I

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:52.580 
way it didn't really hit me until I
could<00:04:50.340> step<00:04:50.580> back<00:04:50.820> at<00:04:51.270> the<00:04:51.390> very<00:04:51.570> end<00:04:51.780> just<00:04:52.020> how

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:52.590 
could step back at the very end just how

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:54.890 
could step back at the very end just how
big<00:04:52.920> this<00:04:53.160> was<00:04:53.430> not<00:04:54.120> only<00:04:54.270> as<00:04:54.480> a<00:04:54.510> large

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:54.900 
big this was not only as a large

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:56.630 
big this was not only as a large
sculpture<00:04:55.410> but<00:04:55.620> that<00:04:55.860> we<00:04:56.250> were<00:04:56.370> getting

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:56.640 
sculpture but that we were getting

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:58.430 
sculpture but that we were getting
people<00:04:56.940> involved<00:04:57.330> in<00:04:57.540> the<00:04:57.630> arts<00:04:57.900> through<00:04:58.320> this

00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:58.440 
people involved in the arts through this

00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:59.900 
people involved in the arts through this
that<00:04:58.770> otherwise<00:04:59.040> maybe<00:04:59.340> never<00:04:59.580> would<00:04:59.790> have

00:04:59.900 --> 00:04:59.910 
that otherwise maybe never would have

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:03.710 
that otherwise maybe never would have
stopped<00:05:00.210> and<00:05:00.480> paused<00:05:00.960> to<00:05:01.290> look<00:05:01.410> at<00:05:02.450> to<00:05:03.450> me<00:05:03.600> the

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:03.720 
stopped and paused to look at to me the

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:06.230 
stopped and paused to look at to me the
significance<00:05:04.230> of<00:05:04.380> lean<00:05:04.590> on<00:05:04.740> me<00:05:04.920> is<00:05:05.240> evidence

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.240 
significance of lean on me is evidence

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.650 
significance of lean on me is evidence
of<00:05:06.510> the<00:05:07.050> way<00:05:07.260> that<00:05:07.710> we<00:05:08.490> maybe<00:05:08.910> aren't<00:05:09.240> as<00:05:09.360> far

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:09.660 
of the way that we maybe aren't as far

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:12.440 
of the way that we maybe aren't as far
from<00:05:10.020> the<00:05:10.260> process<00:05:10.740> of<00:05:10.920> building<00:05:11.430> beauty<00:05:12.180> out

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:12.450 
from the process of building beauty out

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:14.000 
from the process of building beauty out
of<00:05:12.480> materials<00:05:13.080> around<00:05:13.260> us<00:05:13.470> as<00:05:13.650> we<00:05:13.800> might<00:05:13.980> think

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:14.010 
of materials around us as we might think

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:16.520 
of materials around us as we might think
we<00:05:14.250> are<00:05:14.490> we<00:05:15.120> can<00:05:15.390> go<00:05:15.570> and<00:05:15.810> just<00:05:16.020> make<00:05:16.320> these

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:16.530 
we are we can go and just make these

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:18.500 
we are we can go and just make these
amazing<00:05:17.130> beautiful<00:05:17.400> things<00:05:17.760> and<00:05:18.060> I<00:05:18.120> think<00:05:18.180> it

amazing beautiful things and I think it

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:20.570 
amazing beautiful things and I think it
inspires<00:05:18.900> everyone<00:05:19.650> who<00:05:19.830> sees<00:05:20.040> it<00:05:20.220> to<00:05:20.400> think

inspires everyone who sees it to think

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:23.399 
inspires everyone who sees it to think
of<00:05:20.669> what<00:05:20.790> they<00:05:20.940> might<00:05:21.120> make<00:05:21.360> around<00:05:22.140> them

00:05:23.399 --> 00:05:23.409
