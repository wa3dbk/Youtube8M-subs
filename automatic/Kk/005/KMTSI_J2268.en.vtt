have a ton of experience with just yet

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.210 
have a ton of experience with just yet
mainly<00:02:34.200> due<00:02:34.319> the<00:02:34.440> fact<00:02:34.650> that<00:02:34.709> you<00:02:34.890> play<00:02:35.099> has

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
mainly due the fact that you play has

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:36.740 
mainly due the fact that you play has
been<00:02:35.340> going<00:02:35.549> up<00:02:35.700> and<00:02:35.909> down<00:02:36.030> up<00:02:36.239> and<00:02:36.450> down<00:02:36.510> which

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
been going up and down up and down which

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.780 
been going up and down up and down which
basically<00:02:37.019> makes<00:02:37.290> multiplayer<00:02:37.799> unplayable<00:02:38.430> I

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
basically makes multiplayer unplayable I

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.339 
basically makes multiplayer unplayable I
was<00:02:39.120> able<00:02:39.239> to<00:02:39.329> get<00:02:39.480> a<00:02:39.510> couple<00:02:39.720> matches<00:02:40.109> in<00:02:40.230> on

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:40.349 
was able to get a couple matches in on

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:41.809 
was able to get a couple matches in on
the<00:02:40.440> first<00:02:40.620> day<00:02:40.799> and<00:02:40.950> basically<00:02:41.609> my

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:41.819 
the first day and basically my

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:42.979 
the first day and basically my
impression<00:02:42.209> so<00:02:42.329> far<00:02:42.540> is<00:02:42.629> that<00:02:42.659> it's<00:02:42.840> something

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
impression so far is that it's something

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:45.080 
impression so far is that it's something
very<00:02:43.379> similar<00:02:43.799> to<00:02:44.040> Dark<00:02:44.220> Souls<00:02:44.519> where<00:02:44.730> the

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
very similar to Dark Souls where the

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.849 
very similar to Dark Souls where the
game<00:02:45.269> is<00:02:45.450> still<00:02:45.659> a<00:02:45.720> single-player<00:02:46.290> game<00:02:46.409> for

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:46.859 
game is still a single-player game for

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:48.349 
game is still a single-player game for
the<00:02:46.950> most<00:02:47.159> part<00:02:47.459> but<00:02:47.609> there's<00:02:47.760> multiplayer

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:48.359 
the most part but there's multiplayer

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:50.000 
the most part but there's multiplayer
components<00:02:48.840> that<00:02:48.900> are<00:02:49.019> integrated<00:02:49.379> into<00:02:49.709> it

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
components that are integrated into it

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.920 
components that are integrated into it
where<00:02:50.489> you<00:02:50.579> can<00:02:50.730> basically<00:02:50.909> invade<00:02:51.780> other

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
where you can basically invade other

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.390 
where you can basically invade other

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
automatically built-in way of doing this

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:24.800 
automatically built-in way of doing this
that<00:03:23.459> doesn't<00:03:23.730> affect<00:03:24.030> your<00:03:24.150> wanted<00:03:24.510> rating

multiplayer<00:03:38.699> matches<00:03:38.910> before<00:03:39.449> I<00:03:39.569> can<00:03:39.750> really

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
multiplayer matches before I can really

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:41.390 
multiplayer matches before I can really
weigh<00:03:40.230> in<00:03:40.440> and<00:03:40.620> give<00:03:40.709> you<00:03:40.829> as<00:03:40.980> my<00:03:41.129> final

weigh in and give you as my final

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:42.920 
weigh in and give you as my final
thought<00:03:41.760> on<00:03:41.970> the<00:03:42.060> game<00:03:42.209> but<00:03:42.389> I<00:03:42.419> can't<00:03:42.690> tell<00:03:42.810> you

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
thought on the game but I can't tell you

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:44.930 
thought on the game but I can't tell you
that<00:03:42.959> so<00:03:43.260> far<00:03:43.290> I<00:03:43.650> really<00:03:43.829> am<00:03:44.280> enjoying<00:03:44.400> it<00:03:44.730> but

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
that so far I really am enjoying it but

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.309 
that so far I really am enjoying it but
I<00:03:44.970> wouldn't<00:03:45.209> say<00:03:45.329> that<00:03:45.449> I'm<00:03:45.569> loving<00:03:45.930> it<00:03:46.019> just

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:46.319 
I wouldn't say that I'm loving it just

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:48.319 
I wouldn't say that I'm loving it just
yet<00:03:46.590> as<00:03:46.829> I<00:03:47.250> said<00:03:47.430> earlier<00:03:47.669> driving<00:03:48.120> is<00:03:48.209> an

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:48.329 
yet as I said earlier driving is an

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:50.089 
yet as I said earlier driving is an
absolute<00:03:48.660> pain<00:03:48.959> and<00:03:49.230> the<00:03:49.470> gun<00:03:49.650> mechanics

00:03:50.089 --> 00:03:50.099 
absolute pain and the gun mechanics

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:51.409 
absolute pain and the gun mechanics
could<00:03:50.220> also<00:03:50.370> use<00:03:50.609> a<00:03:50.639> little<00:03:50.730> bit<00:03:50.970> of<00:03:51.060> work<00:03:51.209> but

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:51.419 
could also use a little bit of work but

00:03:51.419 --> 00:03:53.330 
could also use a little bit of work but
on<00:03:51.540> the<00:03:51.629> upside<00:03:51.989> I<00:03:52.260> really<00:03:52.829> like<00:03:52.980> the<00:03:53.069> way<00:03:53.190> the

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
on the upside I really like the way the

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:54.740 
on the upside I really like the way the
game<00:03:53.459> is<00:03:53.489> handled<00:03:53.849> stealth<00:03:54.150> in<00:03:54.329> a<00:03:54.389> free<00:03:54.599> roam

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
game is handled stealth in a free roam

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:56.509 
game is handled stealth in a free roam
game<00:03:54.780> and<00:03:55.290> there<00:03:55.530> are<00:03:55.620> so<00:03:55.829> many<00:03:56.010> different

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:56.519 
game and there are so many different

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:57.619 
game and there are so many different
things<00:03:56.639> to<00:03:56.879> do<00:03:57.000> for<00:03:57.209> character<00:03:57.480> progression

00:03:57.619 --> 00:03:57.629 
things to do for character progression

00:03:57.629 --> 00:03:59.300 
things to do for character progression
that<00:03:58.260> it<00:03:58.349> looks<00:03:58.500> like<00:03:58.590> it'll<00:03:58.739> keep<00:03:58.919> you<00:03:59.040> really

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
that it looks like it'll keep you really

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:00.920 
that it looks like it'll keep you really
busy<00:03:59.459> especially<00:04:00.299> if<00:04:00.389> you<00:04:00.449> want<00:04:00.540> to<00:04:00.629> go<00:04:00.750> full

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
busy especially if you want to go full

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:02.899 
busy especially if you want to go full
completionist<00:04:01.560> on<00:04:01.680> it<00:04:01.859> all-in-all<00:04:02.459> so<00:04:02.699> far

00:04:02.899 --> 00:04:02.909 
completionist on it all-in-all so far

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:04.789 
completionist on it all-in-all so far
it's<00:04:03.000> fun<00:04:03.269> but<00:04:03.569> just<00:04:03.629> not<00:04:03.810> exactly<00:04:04.169> amazing

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:04.799 
it's fun but just not exactly amazing

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:06.409 
it's fun but just not exactly amazing
just<00:04:05.099> yet<00:04:05.370> we'll<00:04:05.730> just<00:04:05.970> see<00:04:06.060> how<00:04:06.150> it<00:04:06.180> maintains

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:06.419 
just yet we'll just see how it maintains
