00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060
 Welcome to the reviews 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:04.470
 today there is the second trailer of 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.819
 Lucy and then I would say look 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.470
 take a quick look at this trailer 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.470
 a short mainz 

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:15.780
 I was vulnerable just like you 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:17.850
 uncertain he is afraid of death 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.810
 then everything has changed just before 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.810
 twelve hours 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:34.230
 I do not know I did not do anything 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:36.030
 I implore you we have one 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.620
 package with something very special yours 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.520
 also used and they will be there for 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.440
 transported us 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.989
 follow the rules and it will 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.350
 nobody hurt i'm not in 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.350
 Mood 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.050
 It says we only use ten people 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.140
 percent of our cerebral skills 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.140
 but 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.670
 What if there is a way to access 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.879
 one hundred percent of our brain too 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:14.590
 gain 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:15.850
 what would we be capable of then i have theirs 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.350
 research on the human 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.930
 Brain there are a few gaps 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:23.830
 what i am on the right track 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:27.789
 Thank you I am capable of doing you 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:29.080
 Never before have I felt everything 

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:30.700
 and i can handle the elements around me 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:36.569
 controlled possible to check 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:36.569
 we have to force ourselves believe me 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:43.939
 The chemical allows her new areale 

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:48.109
 capabilities brain unlock their 

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:51.450
 it must not fall into the wrong hands 

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:56.909
 We should not make any moves 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:58.679
 please put the hands up, we 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.799
 include capacity grows with everyone 

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:00.799
 minute 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.970
 what happens if you are the 100 right 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:11.679
 I have no idea 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:17.620
 but she is the key to everything 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:24.740
 I drive 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.740
 no, this is a police car 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.069
 yes and in the movie it will be about it 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.510
 that triggers the chosen woman is and 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:36.430
 Although in her body becomes a drug 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.590
 smuggled package and it comes to it 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.270
 an accident and the drug substances 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.800
 get into the bloodstream and thus becomes 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:43.510
 lucy to a killer machine the 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.100
 besides still one is intelligent 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.170
 looks here meanwhile cut that 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:49.120
 morgan freeman here as a scientist 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.320
 found out that sugar is only ten 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.690
 percent of the human brain 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:55.150
 really be used too and lucy it 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:56.830
 then a very special woman in the 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.660
 film then somehow than 20 percent then 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:59.980
 30 and then more and more of their 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:01.810
 can use real brain power 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.190
 with it developed supernatural powers 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.590
 and just one by the way 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:07.209
 killermaschine is and would not be there 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.500
 that funny feeling i did too 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:11.170
 Trailers already trend among the fans 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.480
 if i had this basic scenario 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.620
 quite interesting not 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.150
 that human really only ten 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.860
 percent of his brain power care 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.840
 used that is such an information has 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:20.800
 you've heard it here and there and on 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.390
 I find that a very exciting 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.890
 consideration for I what would be my 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:25.180
 really if you use 100 percent 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:26.290
 you could and should be at all 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:28.480
 still going to school there would be 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.830
 the stuff is really what you do 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.970
 what does one have to learn or do somehow have? 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:32.650
 Everything already his head and you can 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:33.880
 learn everything quickly and learn 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.950
 maybe you can even read 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.480
 somehow I know a thousand things 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.769
 at the same time I know as I do 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.299
 I find a super interesting thing 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:43.060
 But then I have this 

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:44.530
 strange feeling that the whole trader like that 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.370
 a bit too, or more generally 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:46.900
 if somehow the movies 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:48.910
 physical laws again so 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:51.130
 bit spoiling and then people say 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:53.170
 no matter now we'll do it now 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:54.940
 totally supernatural things here and that 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:57.190
 is for me personally such a point where 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:58.780
 I always think comes from me 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:00.730
 can be creative from me there completely 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:03.280
 a lot of cool ideas come in though 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:05.440
 please leave a reason a reason 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.420
 net and son basic structure there if it 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:08.920
 Realism is easy and there 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:10.360
 maybe the physical laws 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:12.190
 at least somehow still leave 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:13.750
 because then maybe you have somewhere 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:15.940
 also a foundation where then you need 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:17.140
 then any other most creative 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:18.220
 ideas here can put it to 

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:19.989
 Example that somehow I know 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:22.060
 not totally fast what can do that 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:23.229
 you somehow read incredibly fast 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:24.940
 learn whatever come 

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:26.800
 well, the whole thing might not be that way 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:28.120
 very exciting but I think so a few 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:30.370
 You could maybe do things here and there 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.810
 let's get stuck and thus I hope 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:34.090
 times that the software is not too much 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:35.530
 but it is turned off so that the 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:37.060
 trailer me otherwise relatively well 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:37.599
 and I are looking forward to the 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:38.270
 whole movie 

00:04:37.599 --> 00:04:39.650
 and so 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:41.390
 this trailer gets six of me 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:43.040
 ten possible points in the trailer 

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:44.060
 evaluation and now I am on yours 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:45.380
 I'm curious to write yours 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:47.030
 Opinion in the comments 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:48.620
 and otherwise we were under 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:50.390
 Ask twitter.com and trader below 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:52.160

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:53.540
 facebook page and including also the 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.340
 Survey on the film I am on 

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:56.300
 Most will be happy in may in any case 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:57.920
 I would be very happy to participate 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:59.630
 I would help myself otherwise 

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:01.220
 happy if you my video a thumbs 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:02.660

 Of course I would be glad if you 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:06.410

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:07.850
 Being there and having a nice day 

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:09.230
 I have new internet connection and 

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:11.660
 thus can the videos within 

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:12.020
 Pretty city of an hour or what 

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:14.840
 always 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:17.270
 and that's why it's always on time 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:19.550
 Given low and everything I look forward to 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:21.260
 me huge and yet has already said 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:23.560
 and I want to say it's the next one 

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.560
 times
