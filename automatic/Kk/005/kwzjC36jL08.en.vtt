00:01:39.099 --> 00:01:39.109 
stay on one knee is just so I have some

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:40.749 
stay on one knee is just so I have some
of<00:01:39.139> the<00:01:39.259> pivot<00:01:39.560> I<00:01:39.649> like<00:01:40.340> it<00:01:40.460> did<00:01:40.639> that's

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:40.759 
of the pivot I like it did that's

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:44.020 
of the pivot I like it did that's
benefit<00:01:41.359> so<00:01:42.289> I<00:01:42.350> come<00:01:42.590> around<00:01:42.729> and<00:01:43.729> it's<00:01:43.969> just

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 
benefit so I come around and it's just

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:45.849 
benefit so I come around and it's just
it's<00:01:44.509> just<00:01:44.600> a<00:01:44.810> little<00:01:44.960> bit<00:01:45.139> easier<00:01:45.289> to<00:01:45.499> get<00:01:45.740> the

00:01:45.849 --> 00:01:45.859 
it's just a little bit easier to get the

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:47.800 
it's just a little bit easier to get the
angle<00:01:46.130> then<00:01:46.609> this<00:01:46.759> would<00:01:46.880> be<00:01:46.969> actually<00:01:47.090> under

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
angle then this would be actually under

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.230 
angle then this would be actually under
that's<00:01:48.049> a<00:01:48.170> pressure<00:01:48.860> okay<00:01:49.369> so<00:01:49.790> there's<00:01:50.030> on<00:01:50.119> my

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
that's a pressure okay so there's on my

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.980 
that's a pressure okay so there's on my
step<00:01:50.540> hop

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
step hop

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:55.270 
step hop
