00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:13.090
 It's friends the Wednesday starts with 

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:14.650
 that bitter taste of defeat and not 

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:17.830
 a defeat or a defeat 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:20.109
 shameful 7 to 1 playing at home who 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:21.939
 could imagine even the most pessimistic 

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:24.279
 I think I could imagine a 

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:25.810
 Such a bad result for a cup 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:28.269
 played at home but for us it's 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:30.159
 difficult to deal with some children is 

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:32.410
 Even worse, it is on this subject that the 

00:00:30.159 --> 00:00:33.790
 People talk to the educator, huh? 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:35.530
 to try to understand a little bit 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:36.940
 I confess that I want some tips and 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:38.980
 other children but that works for me 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:40.990
 also because I was also very annoyed 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:42.940
 well with the nonconformist but for the 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:44.350
 children have a question of time, do not 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.990
 I can not see that in four years 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:50.020
 coppe between such landmarks where good day 

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:51.850
 mother because it is really quite difficult to 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:53.050
 explain to the children but the 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:55.540
 first thing we need 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:59.410
 to understand is that right now 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:01.780
 there is the right to sadness let cry 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:04.540
 let it be sad, you can enjoy it 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:06.100
 in this moment of sadness because it is 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.900
 fair is justifiable 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.580
 We are sad, yes we have the 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:12.070
 Right to be sad, I have the 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.960
 right to cry even then what 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.420
 We talk about the child, he says so. 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.920
 cry my son embrace your son lets 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.110
 cry out available 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.510
 We are also angry that he is with 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:24.550
 Hill anger thing we did all 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:26.320
 already an analysis of what happened and 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:27.250
 we are in this way then this is the 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.580
 first moment 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:32.290
 the second moment is now from here 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.479
 What are we going to do? 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:37.990
 so we need to learn 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:41.350
 with mistakes and the greater our 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:43.510
 greater expectation may be ours. 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:46.000
 frustration the fall 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:47.710
 so if you expect too much you can 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.270
 fall so high then what we people 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:52.600
 I hope you hoped that we would win 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:54.400
 we were going to win, maybe not 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.799
 be quiet but surely we 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:59.409
 I was going to win this is our expectation 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:01.840
 nobody thought it could take 17 years 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:03.850
 is this imagined then how do we 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.630
 Did not expect that, the fall is enough. 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:09.340
 big frustration comes and it's e 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.140
 resistance to frustration is one of 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.480
 feelings more important for the 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.610
 human maturity because there are people who 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.070
 did not support this frustration does 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:21.160
 but does not break breaks and screams scurrilous 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:23.800
 Someone wants to kill someone are absurd. 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:26.710
 of the absurd that comes when frustration 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.990
 is not supported then we have to 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:31.990
 also in the child now that 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:34.270
 It's not just football that a country does not 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:36.490
 only play with a game, it's time to 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:38.620
 invest back to invest real 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:40.630
 in other areas mainly education 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.910
 that we talk so much then we can 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:43.600
 yes now use all this to evaluate 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:45.820
 best 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:48.250
 and from now on, what to do is 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:51.250
 three basic things to teach the 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:53.709
 child first to succeed has 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:55.810
 have to plan this in all 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:58.959
 areas of our lives will not depend on 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:01.840
 lucky I will succeed will depend on 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:03.580
 you wear a yellow-green underwear or 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.700
 anything like superstitions 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:08.950
 can use can have superstition 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.600
 No problem, but that's what will 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:13.150
 lead to victory not each planning 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.890
 second place has to have strategy 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:17.560
 Do you want to get ahead in front of my son? 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:21.549
 you'll have to do now today as 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:23.950
 time and 3rd place training gives 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:26.170
 people use for example and all this to 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:28.810
 the vestibular you want to vestibular in 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:30.580
 what area planning strategy and 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:33.760
 training is what will get you there 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:36.910
 Give it to me on the day, I asked God to help. 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.950
 But if you're just thinking about what God 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:40.780
 will you pass the test on you? 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:42.670
 Pass does not go forward. 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:45.340
 now but is usually associated with 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:48.610
 issue of sport in general with this 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:51.250
 The question of overcoming is 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:53.080
 good examples only that we have 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:54.700
 examples just as you are quoting and 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.840
 You can give too many things too. 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.209
 lessons 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:00.910
 a lesson that may also be 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:03.190
 the parents' disposal is that the pain 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:05.200
 greater than a father can have is precisely 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:07.600
 see your child suffering for something that 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:09.190
 it is not his fault it is not because the child 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:10.120
 Maybe you have to understand that she made the 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:12.850
 part of it 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:14.829
 As a supporter, it has existed if 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:17.890
 who did not do the part that should 

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:19.900
 were players and the coach is 

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:22.030
 true he means each one has his 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:24.039
 share of guilt in life situations 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:25.599
 you also need to know how to take 

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:27.400
 Your fault for the fault of others is also 

00:04:25.599 --> 00:04:30.340
 perfect sun call us 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:32.830
 It's crazy the control interns this and 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:35.380
 summarizing so you bring in 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:37.389
 you act liability is not the responsibility of 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:39.729
 other than that of other days the country 

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:42.310
 It depends on me, it's up to you and it 's yours. 

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:44.139
 Semmler and transferring it to other 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:47.500
 areas returned produced for example 

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:50.169
 a contest does not depend on your 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:52.600
 victory does not just depend on your training alone 

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:54.460
 Are you prepared not to depend on 

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:55.330
 also how much others are 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:56.860
 prepared 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:58.780
 so we had a good team more 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:01.510
 we lost because for another much better 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:03.550
 so it does not just depend on us, that's it 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:05.770
 that we can teach your child the 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:07.660
 Son you lost but it 's not because you 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:09.940
 It's bad because the other was better people. 

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:12.370
 can also teach you to lose on that 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:14.830
 coping with frustration is important and 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:16.900
 such but lose with dignity with head 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:20.169
 erect can cry can be frustrated 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:23.680
 You may regret it but you can not say it without staying. 

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:25.300
 wanting to find guilty, I also think that 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:28.090
 It takes dignity not to lose it. 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:30.070
 this dignity comes and 10 of them 

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:31.900
 recognition the other was better 

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:35.139
 people were not well prepared 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:37.870
 we is not we have terrible failures 

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:39.940
 all this led to this result then 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:43.419
 when we teach our children to 

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:45.400
 recognize that errors should be seen 

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:48.669
 as an opportunity to grow 

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:50.680
 to recognize is to be to transform 

00:05:48.669 --> 00:05:53.050
 own reality to go there 

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:54.970
 front to hit that is what we have 

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:57.130
 that make us just look 

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:59.320
 to error as the great misfortune of 

00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:00.940
 life and we could never have 

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:03.070
 past this shame 

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:05.560
 if we stop there we one 

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:07.090
 very large gift of money is very 

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:09.550
 even heavy with our children 

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:12.130
 Do not give it to us to use this moment. 

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:14.229
 it's heavy it's sad it can cry but it gives 

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:17.830
 to use it to grow up like 

00:06:14.229 --> 00:06:19.510
 nation and as children as education but 

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:22.270
 now to what extent this reaction of 

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:24.699
 sadness and frustration is it should be 

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:26.080
 acceptable is not especially the 

00:06:24.699 --> 00:06:27.849
 difference between children and adolescents 

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:29.139
 I remember, for example, with nine years of 

00:06:27.849 --> 00:06:32.110
 age when Brazil lost to the 

00:06:29.139 --> 00:06:34.000
 italy nor in the 82 for 3 to 2 I cried 

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:38.210
 almost a week 

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.620
 But anyway, that's right, it's a time in 

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:42.169
 some moment will pass but what is the 

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:44.810
 extent that there be attentive team up 

00:06:42.169 --> 00:06:46.849
 what extent it is we call it just 

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:49.310
 of resilience is what is its capacity 

00:06:46.849 --> 00:06:52.250
 to return to its previous state is the 

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:54.560
 natural state then is is a concept of 

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:56.449
 when you squeeze a metal 

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:59.449
 it returns to its natural state because 

00:06:56.449 --> 00:07:02.240
 He has a residence so we suffer. 

00:06:59.449 --> 00:07:04.789
 much now it hurts too much we cry 

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:07.009
 What is your ability to return to 

00:07:04.789 --> 00:07:08.479
 take the sadness and touch life to 

00:07:07.009 --> 00:07:09.740
 in front of the residence 

00:07:08.479 --> 00:07:11.990
 So we have to teach for the 

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:15.050
 child that she has at other times 

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:16.849
 lost and got now is here 

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:18.379
 also worked 

00:07:16.849 --> 00:07:20.300
 Last year you did not win the gift. 

00:07:18.379 --> 00:07:22.340
 that you wanted to be here today, you? 

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:24.169
 Got it, we'll show it to you. 

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:26.509
 the child to focus on the 

00:07:24.169 --> 00:07:28.009
 defeat and we have to respect the 

00:07:26.509 --> 00:07:31.099
 difference of children has a child 

00:07:28.009 --> 00:07:33.199
 It takes a week another one month another're already 

00:07:31.099 --> 00:07:35.629
 joking, you do not give a shit about football 

00:07:33.199 --> 00:07:38.089
 then these differences are part of the 

00:07:35.629 --> 00:07:40.969
 personality respect of his son he 

00:07:38.089 --> 00:07:47.560
 There's his time to go around 

00:07:40.969 --> 00:07:47.560
 Up the ball forward Brazil is here.
