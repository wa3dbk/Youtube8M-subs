00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:08.809
 the seven ways to extinguish the race 

00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:11.570
 human according to the organization 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:13.940
 environmentalist in the last 40 years the 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:18.110
 number of species of wild animals 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:20.509
 Scientists have decreased by 52% 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:23.149
 they speak of the sixth mass extinction in 

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:26.360
 the planet will be humans the 

00:00:23.149 --> 00:00:29.000
 following in disappearing humans 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:31.640
 we believe in dominating the planet but our 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.590
 apparently privileged condition not 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.649
 it guarantees our survival as 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:39.199
 sort a series of scenarios all 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:40.929
 them direct or indirect consequence 

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:44.359
 of our impact on the planet 

00:00:40.929 --> 00:00:47.530
 could end with humanity the 

00:00:44.359 --> 00:00:50.449
 food crisis in several ecosystems 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:53.420
 one of the most crucial roles what 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:55.879
 large predators play the 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:58.100
 absence of these types of animals could 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:00.739
 cause an increase in the population of 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:03.920
 rodents which in turn would trigger the 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:06.290
 level of morbidity experts see 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.960
 also with alarm the acceleration in 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:11.450
 the disappearance of the invertebrates one 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.310
 that could seriously affect the 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.500
 food production at the level 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:17.750
 planetary since the insects 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.060
 they play an important role in the cycle 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:23.570
 of nutrients as well as in the 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:26.690
 pollination of 75% of crops 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:29.930
 food of the world convert the 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:31.880
 land in a new venus the amount of 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:34.909
 carbon dioxide in our atmosphere 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:37.850
 Constantly increases the presence 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:40.509
 of carbon dioxide in the air affects 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:44.119
 the heat transfer on the planet 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:46.580
 in this sense the tyler climatologists 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:48.590
 robinson and colin goldblatt predict that 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:50.539
 could come a moment from the 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:53.539
 which the temperature of the earth does not 

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:56.300
 will stop increasing this effect you can 

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:58.280
 observe in venus whose atmosphere is so 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:01.580
 hot that on the planet does not fall 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:05.060
 no precipitation changes in the 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:07.700
 cyclicality of the monsoons as 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:10.250
 the climate heats the mechanisms that 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.830
 cause seasonal wet winds in 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.420
 asia africa and south america can 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.810
 be altered 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:19.250
 as a result, regions of the planet 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.989
 fundamental for agriculture and that 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.270
 are home to almost half of the 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:26.360
 human population could be left without 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:28.819
 rainfall due to variations in 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.950
 cyclicality of the monsoons the desert 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:33.230
 of the sahara could become a 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:36.200
 tropical forest while the jungle 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:38.959
 amazonian on the contrary it would transform 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:41.450
 in an arid steppe many others 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:45.190
 weather factors immediately 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:48.680
 they would change causing a domino effect 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:51.050
 diseases such as Ebola virus the 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.510
 Ebola in its current form is not so 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:55.790
 dangerous as the press says 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.799
 that the infection is only possible if 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:00.590
 there is contact with fluids 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:04.040
 body blood vomit sweat 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:06.680
 carrier however if the virus mutates and 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.810
 begins to be transmitted through the air 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:12.400
 the possibilities of unleashing a 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:15.530
 pandemic will multiply bioterrorism 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:17.720
 advances in the fields of biology 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:20.060
 molecular and genetic 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:22.299
 enable new types of development 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:25.159
 of weapons 

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:26.920
 currently many scientists try 

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:30.769
 understand a biochemical process 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:33.409
 complex apoptosis is death 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:35.719
 programmed cell if you learn to 

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:39.230
 control the apoptosis humanity 

00:03:35.719 --> 00:03:42.829
 you will get a new powerful cyber weapon 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:45.620
 weapons the computer weapons also 

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:48.230
 can lead to the end of the world the 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:50.599
 stuxnet computer virus attacked the 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:52.939
 Iran's nuclear facilities and a 

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:55.189
 computer network of a Russian reactor 

00:03:52.939 --> 00:03:58.189
 that they were not even connected to 

00:03:55.189 --> 00:04:00.769
 internet about the world expert 

00:03:58.189 --> 00:04:03.319
 in antivirus ergen and kaspersky said what 

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:05.540
 that we have seen is just the beginning and 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:06.859
 I think that this can actually cause 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:10.780
 World's End 

00:04:06.859 --> 00:04:13.730
 I'm afraid of technological uniqueness 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:15.400
 According to scientists, there is no need 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:18.440
 rule out that technological progress 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:20.750
 become so fast and complex that 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:23.539
 escape from control and understanding 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:26.000
 humans some opinions point 

00:04:23.539 --> 00:04:27.950
 that when humanity manages to create 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.170
 artificial intelligence 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:32.450
 Chinese self replicating humans and 

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:34.040
 the computers will be integrated or the 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:36.980
 human brain capabilities 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:40.040
 will increase significantly at expense 

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:42.440
 of biotechnology is also possible 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:44.750
 that the robots try to eradicate the 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:46.820
 humans for considering them creatures 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:50.110
 imperfect and inefficient 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:50.110
 hamper progress 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:02.519
