00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:06.060
 hello to all so today we get 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.280
 find for me to show you the 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:12.000
 glitch of norton so to access the 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.620
 prologue mode in the 1.08 patch so 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.509
 always such a job is the mission 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.010
 of the prologue so you see there I have to 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.770
 hardly launched the mission I accept 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:23.550
 the invitation of my friend who is 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.019
 found partly private so rockstar 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.340
 we are told that with their update 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:32.189
 1.18 he had not touched mark hampton 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:34.020
 and I discover to my surprise that 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.660
 did not patch it to property that did not 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.760
 not succeeded in the patch so oif was 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.710
 still pretty happy I you you 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.790
 I like to have fun there 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.200
 you saw I did two races 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.870
 there and I have fun doing the 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.520
 stunt compilations there too because 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.079
 it's always funnier to go 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.730
 have fun doing jumps with 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.800
 vehicles first in a lot more than 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:57.180
 two jumps to do while in the 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:59.760
 low city that's it remains a villa was 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.820
 not done to do stunts and 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:08.760
 so that's it in the first place I'm going 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:13.400
 go get a plane so here is so 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.400
 always the same kiskun in the same place 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:22.530
 go so little hurry a little 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:24.979
 would arrange me well so here we go 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.979
 to take off 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:33.290
 and you'll see that barely I 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:35.690
 did not follow yet arrived there that we 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:39.830
 already sees the mountains that have this 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:43.420
 foal so here you see norton is 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:46.520
 always accessible from patch 1.8 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.990
 sachets do not believe what was said 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.150
 in the update etc 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.530
 certainly I say not the opposite there is 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:54.320
 a lot of things that have been patched 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.580
 I was even amazed a week later 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.120
 updating a point c is another 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:58.910
 update 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:59.979
 finally rockstar brief was quickly on this 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:02.750
 blow there they exceeded us 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:03.979
 so anyway do not worry 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.830
 not for that there will always be 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:08.210
 new beach 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:09.700
 soon we just need the 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:11.570
 time to find them 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.100
 because you see I had found a 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:16.700
 glitch right at the end of the update 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:18.050
 1.7 no luck for me there would be 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.070
 it take before I find it so 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:21.230
 it was still a clichÃ© 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:22.280
 interesting but do not talk about it anymore we do not 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.380
 longer can do to the foot 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:27.170
 vehicles but not returned from their 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:29.930
 box it's useless so as you see 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.670
 we arrive in northampton always 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.250
 the same will not change I'll feel you 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.300
 I do not want to dwell on it just saw 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.260
 to make you see that we can always 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:40.430
 access that we can always go 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:41.930
 to walk on it and so it's about 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:45.140
 the rumors this city on investigations 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:47.180
 has been deleted it's not true some 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.520
 people said that there would be a dlc 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.900
 I do not believe that either 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:52.820
 because when we see the quality 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.450
 graphic of buildings that makes us 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:55.090
 really scared 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.800
 so here I am going to try to ask myself 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.330
 the osteria I crashed so do not 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.740
 believe did not think to have a dlc there 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.780
 on it and I do not think there will be 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:06.980
 the graphics is not even worth it 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:11.030
 to think about it and to gta under the snow it's 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:13.280
 do not see masses so here I am 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:17.030
 you see in the options that 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:19.480
 this is the update 1.18 here and 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:21.410
 I will meet up with another friend 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.610
 so here we see we can always there 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:23.780
 so go in any case I hope that 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:26.890
 this video will please you and I tell you 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:26.890
 to the next go hi
