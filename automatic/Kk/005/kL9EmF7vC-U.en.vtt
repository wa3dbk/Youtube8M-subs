what we had done is little dirt bike
ground<00:00:31.590> down<00:00:31.859> maybe<00:00:32.189> about<00:00:32.460> a<00:00:33.059> little<00:00:33.329> more

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
ground down maybe about a little more

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.560 
ground down maybe about a little more
than<00:00:33.630> an<00:00:33.719> eighth<00:00:33.899> of<00:00:34.079> an<00:00:34.170> inch<00:00:34.290> and<00:00:34.880> then<00:00:35.880> put

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
than an eighth of an inch and then put

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.479 
than an eighth of an inch and then put
this<00:00:36.750> fiberglass<00:00:37.410> tape<00:00:37.890> on<00:00:38.129> there<00:00:38.309> let<00:00:38.460> me

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
this fiberglass tape on there let me

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.930 
this fiberglass tape on there let me
show<00:00:38.700> you<00:00:38.760> that<00:00:38.969> as<00:00:39.120> we<00:00:39.300> take<00:00:39.480> it<00:00:40.700> yeah

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.270 
show you that as we take it yeah
quarters<00:00:42.329> fiberglass<00:00:42.840> tape<00:00:43.170> or<00:00:43.770> this<00:00:44.070> is<00:00:44.250> a

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
quarters fiberglass tape or this is a

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.029 
quarters fiberglass tape or this is a
fiberglass<00:00:44.940> and<00:00:45.329> big<00:00:45.539> wound<00:00:46.530> up<00:00:46.680> on<00:00:46.770> a<00:00:46.860> big

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
fiberglass and big wound up on a big

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:47.779 
fiberglass and big wound up on a big
thing<00:00:47.219> like<00:00:47.370> that

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
thing like that

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.350 
thing like that
but<00:00:48.570> anyway<00:00:48.899> and<00:00:49.289> they<00:00:49.410> mixed<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:50.360> fiberglass

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
but anyway and they mixed the fiberglass

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.529 
but anyway and they mixed the fiberglass
resin<00:00:51.870> and<00:00:52.829> then<00:00:53.340> these<00:00:53.579> hoods<00:00:54.090> are<00:00:54.239> made<00:00:54.270> in

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
resin and then these hoods are made in

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:55.880 
resin and then these hoods are made in
actually<00:00:54.840> two<00:00:54.989> pieces<00:00:55.410> you<00:00:55.440> know<00:00:55.620> you<00:00:55.710> got<00:00:55.800> the

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
actually two pieces you know you got the

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.950 
actually two pieces you know you got the
top<00:00:56.070> piece<00:00:56.309> in<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.489> bottom<00:00:56.820> piece<00:00:57.030> and<00:00:57.210> that

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
top piece in the bottom piece and that

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.660 
top piece in the bottom piece and that
was<00:00:58.079> all<00:00:58.230> separated<00:00:58.829> so<00:00:58.980> he<00:00:59.129> actually<00:00:59.520> had<00:00:59.640> to

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
was all separated so he actually had to

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.490 
was all separated so he actually had to
use<00:00:59.760> the<00:01:00.090> fiberglass<00:01:00.449> to<00:01:00.780> glue<00:01:00.930> it<00:01:01.050> together

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
use the fiberglass to glue it together

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.280 
use the fiberglass to glue it together
and<00:01:01.649> then<00:01:02.550> put<00:01:02.760> this<00:01:02.879> piece<00:01:03.120> on<00:01:03.300> because<00:01:03.780> this

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
and then put this piece on because this

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.280 
and then put this piece on because this
was<00:01:04.769> all<00:01:04.890> cracked<00:01:05.189> and<00:01:05.400> stuff<00:01:05.900> but<00:01:06.900> any<00:01:07.080> Wes

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
was all cracked and stuff but any Wes

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.859 
was all cracked and stuff but any Wes
where<00:01:07.530> he<00:01:07.619> is<00:01:07.740> and<00:01:08.070> he<00:01:08.310> sanded<00:01:09.090> down<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.450> area

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
where he is and he sanded down the area

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.690 
where he is and he sanded down the area
here<00:01:10.049> so<00:01:10.080> many<00:01:10.439> when<00:01:11.130> he<00:01:11.159> primes<00:01:11.490> and

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
here so many when he primes and

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.719 
here so many when he primes and
everything<00:01:12.119> all<00:01:12.330> everything<00:01:12.750> it<00:01:12.869> will<00:01:13.439> adhere

and when he does some of the bodywork so
we're<00:01:19.470> gonna<00:01:19.619> continue<00:01:19.799> on<00:01:20.130> and<00:01:20.310> see<00:01:20.430> how<00:01:20.460> he

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
we're gonna continue on and see how he

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.520 
we're gonna continue on and see how he
does<00:01:20.960> all<00:01:21.960> right<00:01:23.299> all<00:01:24.299> right<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:25.080> dirt<00:01:25.320> bike

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
does all right all right the dirt bike

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.730 
does all right all right the dirt bike
is<00:01:25.650> gonna<00:01:25.830> try<00:01:26.009> and<00:01:26.130> trim<00:01:26.340> this<00:01:26.490> here<00:01:26.700> with<00:01:26.909> the

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
is gonna try and trim this here with the

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.410 
is gonna try and trim this here with the
Dremel<00:01:28.740> get<00:01:29.430> to<00:01:29.579> get<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:29.970> overhang<00:01:30.299> off

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
Dremel get to get the overhang off

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.319 
Dremel get to get the overhang off
because<00:01:30.570> you<00:01:30.720> don't<00:01:30.869> need<00:01:30.930> all<00:01:31.259> that<00:01:32.090> yes<00:01:33.090> yeah
