00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:06.140
 hello to all so today I'm going 

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:08.540
 show you the renault scenic iii so 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:10.309
 of 2009 jade finish I explained to you 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:11.540
 a little all the options will not be this 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:14.750
 that we can do with obviously not 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:15.830
 rolled like all cars so 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:17.359
 then so I when I told you it's 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:21.949
 the jade finish so you have them 

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:27.349
 leather car seats with a key 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:28.880
 usb auxiliary input the bluetooth so 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:30.349
 to be able to call and do as well 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.090
 streaming your music so there is 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:37.640
 on your phone 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:38.989
 therefore, when lighting you you us 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.300
 have mirrors that folds 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:43.039
 automatically fellowship has not lived the 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:48.620
 are now doing good you can put 

00:00:43.039 --> 00:00:51.370
 on the way also the gps so here is 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:56.059
 the gps carminat tomtom 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:01:00.170
 so if I can do you after a 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:01.100
 small little explanation will suffice to 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:01.969
 put in your comments if you 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.160
 do I show you a little 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:06.890
 explanation for the update of the 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:10.190
 so obviously legal gps 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:12.950
 so leather interior jade finish so 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:16.550
 there it is with the chocolate color 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:19.400
 so I have the option of the sunroof so 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:21.640
 you can open so I want to start 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.640
 engine 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.900
 so here is the then you have several 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:29.320
 either the roof opens like that or so 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:33.180
 it opens completely with the little 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:34.430
 net for insects 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.940
 closes 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:40.840
 then in the back also you have the 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:44.390
 roof but it does not open 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:51.260
 it stays fixed but you can not see 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:55.729
 so at the rear vents so 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:58.670
 the gps that a gpm gps tomtom so in fact 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:00.800
 very simple you have the order here 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.170
 so you press menu 7 you 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:05.030
 get to the homepage navigate 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.820
 to then either you go to the 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.020
 recent destinations domicile here 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:09.910
 it's really simple it's very 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.940
 intuitive 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:15.730
 this is for example address then either 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:19.100
 it's street number either by postal code 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:21.950
 a crossing an intersection where 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:25.780
 downtown so let's admit I 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.780
 will take the green this Thursday north 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:37.310
 wait I tend towards this destination 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:43.610
 where who calculates what she wants and I have 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:45.709
 actually took calculated route 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.720
 good frankly this gps is not bad so 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:48.950
 hardware evolved with the live function 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.120
 so I'm not it but the function 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:51.950
 live actually allows you to have the 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.980
 traffic jams in real time that's 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.090
 really a plus compared to that one 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:58.700
 whereas with regard to the painting 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.380
 board so you have several can 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.420
 choose then for example if we 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.680
 includes tolls do you want them 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.080
 avoid at their expense any yes or no 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.510
 so here I have no and then here you are 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.549
 done done it's gone so I have 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:20.000
 therefore disabled the sound you 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:21.150
 can reactivate here it does not work finally 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.180
 good 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:26.349
 this is our investments I had 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:30.190
 in a stalemate by cumulating had to do 

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:30.819
 turn around then the car radio so at 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:32.379
 Steering wheel controls 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:33.760
 obviously you have all the 

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:35.680
 orders by then so here it is 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:40.989
 increase the volume and decrease the 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:42.190
 volume loria yield so mp3 and 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:44.739
 frankly on time this is the 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:46.480
 arkamys sincerely the month lesson scion 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:48.430
 compared to my scenic 2 that I had 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.590
 before is really great all 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.640
 just great so I'm not going to you 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:55.090
 listen because obviously you 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:56.849
 will not hear anything compared to with a 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:01.630
 Youtube 

00:03:56.849 --> 00:04:04.269
 so you can choose then you 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:05.950
 then choose either the cd or the 

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:07.690
 auxiliary source so the cemac the bsb 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:08.980
 and then in the usb key so with these 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:13.780
 two goals we wanted her back in 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:16.630
 back and sort the records my son 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:17.889
 is there you choose soual usb be 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:20.380
 so that's my phone I do not have 

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:21.639
 connected so that's mostly both 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:22.960
 that these auxiliaries after with my 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:24.669
 phone I can very well if the 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.320
 music on the car radio valley 

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:28.539
 read without problem 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:30.580
 after good there I resume usb so and 

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:34.690
 you choose your file clearly 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:36.910
 the 80 here is the records so 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:41.230
 that they go in but there you 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:44.440
 choose the titles here 

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:47.310
 then the audio settings are there this 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:49.900
 button has it when you press it 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:53.470
 so on this here you come so be 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:55.240
 on phone settings 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:56.620
 system audio settings for example lo 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:59.560
 musical atmosphere 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:02.160
 so there you have several are 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.160
 possible then
