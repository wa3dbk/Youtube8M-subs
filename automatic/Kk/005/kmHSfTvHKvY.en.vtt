while<00:00:32.040> to<00:00:32.340> get<00:00:32.430> done<00:00:32.610> because<00:00:32.790> this<00:00:33.090> game<00:00:33.270> is

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
while to get done because this game is

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.840 
while to get done because this game is
incredibly<00:00:33.630> hard<00:00:34.440> when<00:00:35.370> I<00:00:35.399> beat<00:00:35.579> it<00:00:35.670> on<00:00:35.730> normal

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
incredibly hard when I beat it on normal

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.610 
incredibly hard when I beat it on normal
it<00:00:36.180> took<00:00:36.300> a<00:00:36.329> long<00:00:36.570> ass<00:00:36.630> time<00:00:36.960> to<00:00:37.110> get<00:00:37.230> done<00:00:37.350> and

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
it took a long ass time to get done and

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.819 
it took a long ass time to get done and
when<00:00:37.739> i<00:00:37.770> was<00:00:37.920> playing<00:00:38.100> this<00:00:38.280> on<00:00:38.430> chaos<00:00:39.829> the

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
when i was playing this on chaos the

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.190 
when i was playing this on chaos the
boss<00:00:41.129> of<00:00:41.340> this<00:00:41.520> video<00:00:42.000> is<00:00:42.420> actually<00:00:42.690> really

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
boss of this video is actually really

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.270 
boss of this video is actually really
hard<00:00:43.440> but<00:00:43.800> I<00:00:43.860> nail<00:00:44.399> down<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.700> strategy<00:00:46.190> now<00:00:47.190> as

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
hard but I nail down the strategy now as

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.200 
hard but I nail down the strategy now as
you<00:00:47.340> can<00:00:47.460> see<00:00:47.520> this<00:00:47.700> video<00:00:47.820> is<00:00:47.940> kind<00:00:48.149> of

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
you can see this video is kind of

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.139 
you can see this video is kind of
disjointed<00:00:48.690> because<00:00:49.879> there's<00:00:50.879> a<00:00:50.940> bunch<00:00:51.090> of

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
disjointed because there's a bunch of

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:58.430 
disjointed because there's a bunch of
cutscenes<00:00:51.480> they've<00:00:51.750> all<00:00:51.840> been<00:00:51.960> taken<00:00:52.079> out<00:00:57.440> so

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
this first area over here is pretty easy

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.290 
this first area over here is pretty easy
just<00:01:00.359> a<00:01:00.600> slice<00:01:01.500> everything<00:01:01.890> up<00:01:02.120> if<00:01:03.120> you're

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300

then move to the other side and rinse

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.430 
then move to the other side and rinse
repeat<00:02:10.950> until<00:02:11.430> we<00:02:11.790> go<00:02:11.910> underneath<00:02:12.350> now<00:02:13.350> the

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
repeat until we go underneath now the

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.660 
repeat until we go underneath now the
controls<00:02:13.800> for<00:02:13.860> this<00:02:14.070> part<00:02:14.310> are<00:02:14.430> pretty

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
controls for this part are pretty

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.750 
controls for this part are pretty
awkward<00:02:15.770> I'm<00:02:16.770> going<00:02:16.920> to<00:02:17.010> hold<00:02:17.280> up<00:02:17.430> on<00:02:17.640> your

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
awkward I'm going to hold up on your

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.070 
awkward I'm going to hold up on your
left<00:02:17.910> analog<00:02:18.300> stick<00:02:18.330> and<00:02:18.630> that's<00:02:18.750> gonna<00:02:18.870> put

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
left analog stick and that's gonna put

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.320 
left analog stick and that's gonna put
you<00:02:19.170> next<00:02:19.290> to<00:02:19.470> him<00:02:19.620> so<00:02:20.610> now<00:02:20.730> he<00:02:20.790> has<00:02:20.940> two

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
you next to him so now he has two

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.190 
you next to him so now he has two
attacks<00:02:21.720> a<00:02:22.140> left<00:02:23.120> crab<00:02:24.120> leg<00:02:24.390> stomp<00:02:24.870> and<00:02:25.080> a

right<00:02:25.440> crab<00:02:25.770> like<00:02:26.010> stomp<00:02:26.340> so<00:02:26.970> you<00:02:27.660> should<00:02:27.870> see

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
right crab like stomp so you should see

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.920 
right crab like stomp so you should see
when<00:02:28.650> you<00:02:28.739> see<00:02:28.920> um<00:02:29.390> the<00:02:30.390> arm<00:02:30.600> on<00:02:30.720> the<00:02:30.750> right

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
when you see um the arm on the right

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.259 
when you see um the arm on the right
side<00:02:31.170> go<00:02:31.650> up<00:02:31.799> into<00:02:32.160> the<00:02:32.340> left<00:02:32.580> and<00:02:32.790> see<00:02:32.970> now<00:02:33.090> I'm

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
side go up into the left and see now I'm

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:36.640 
side go up into the left and see now I'm
on<00:02:33.360> the<00:02:33.450> left<00:02:33.630> side<00:02:33.780> go<00:02:33.959> up<00:02:34.110> onto<00:02:34.320> the<00:02:34.530> right

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
on the left side go up onto the right

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.009 
on the left side go up onto the right
two<00:02:37.650> hits<00:02:37.680> on<00:02:37.980> this<00:02:38.130> side<00:02:38.340> will<00:02:38.549> kill<00:02:38.790> you<00:02:39.019> two

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019 
two hits on this side will kill you two

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:41.960 
two hits on this side will kill you two
hits<00:02:40.260> from<00:02:40.470> these<00:02:40.709> claws<00:02:41.010> even<00:02:41.549> when<00:02:41.820> you're

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
hits from these claws even when you're

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.820 
hits from these claws even when you're
upright<00:02:42.360> will<00:02:42.780> kill<00:02:42.959> you<00:02:43.110> as<00:02:43.230> well<00:02:43.410> so<00:02:43.769> it

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
upright will kill you as well so it

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:48.960 
upright will kill you as well so it
needs<00:02:44.040> to<00:02:44.100> be<00:02:44.190> really<00:02:44.430> careful

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:50.630 

so<00:02:49.540> after<00:02:49.660> enough<00:02:49.960> damage<00:02:50.260> has<00:02:50.380> been<00:02:50.440> done

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
so after enough damage has been done

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.130 
so after enough damage has been done
you'll<00:02:51.640> go<00:02:51.790> right<00:02:51.820> side<00:02:52.360> up<00:02:52.510> a<00:02:52.630> little<00:02:52.870> bit<00:02:52.960> too

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
you'll go right side up a little bit too

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.140 
you'll go right side up a little bit too
now<00:02:53.260> you're<00:02:53.410> climbing<00:02:53.740> and<00:02:54.190> you<00:02:54.850> have<00:02:55.000> to

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
now you're climbing and you have to

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.240 
now you're climbing and you have to
fight<00:02:55.330> this<00:02:55.480> thing<00:02:55.740> the<00:02:56.740> same<00:02:56.950> rules<00:02:57.130> apply

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
fight this thing the same rules apply

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.280 
fight this thing the same rules apply
except<00:02:57.940> now<00:02:58.090> there's<00:02:58.300> the<00:02:58.540> cloth<00:02:58.810> stomp<00:02:59.140> and

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
except now there's the cloth stomp and

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.450 
except now there's the cloth stomp and
the<00:02:59.650> water<00:02:59.860> spit<00:03:01.740> so<00:03:02.740> be<00:03:02.890> aware<00:03:03.010> of<00:03:03.070> the<00:03:03.220> claws

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:03.460 
the water spit so be aware of the claws

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:05.310 
the water spit so be aware of the claws
now<00:03:04.060> if<00:03:04.180> you<00:03:04.300> see<00:03:04.480> this<00:03:04.570> thing<00:03:04.780> rear<00:03:05.050> its<00:03:05.230> head

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:05.320 
now if you see this thing rear its head

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:06.780 
now if you see this thing rear its head
back<00:03:05.620> and<00:03:05.890> you<00:03:05.980> don't<00:03:06.100> see<00:03:06.310> one<00:03:06.430> of<00:03:06.520> the<00:03:06.580> claws

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
back and you don't see one of the claws

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:07.920 
back and you don't see one of the claws
go<00:03:07.000> up<00:03:07.060> in<00:03:07.180> the<00:03:07.240> air<00:03:07.390> and<00:03:07.420> that<00:03:07.630> means<00:03:07.810> the

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
go up in the air and that means the

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:09.900 
go up in the air and that means the
water<00:03:08.110> is<00:03:08.320> coming<00:03:08.470> so<00:03:08.890> just<00:03:09.130> move<00:03:09.340> to<00:03:09.400> whatever

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
water is coming so just move to whatever

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:18.400 
water is coming so just move to whatever
side<00:03:10.150> you<00:03:10.180> can

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:20.470 

I<00:03:18.530> actually<00:03:19.130> got<00:03:19.400> really<00:03:19.430> lucky<00:03:19.940> that<00:03:20.120> was

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 
I actually got really lucky that was

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.130 
I actually got really lucky that was
pretty<00:03:20.630> close<00:03:22.390> so<00:03:23.390> when<00:03:23.720> you've<00:03:23.870> done<00:03:23.990> enough

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.140 
pretty close so when you've done enough

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:26.800 
pretty close so when you've done enough
damage<00:03:24.440> to<00:03:24.770> this<00:03:24.890> thing<00:03:25.460> again<00:03:25.810> you're

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
damage to this thing again you're

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:28.330 
damage to this thing again you're
finally<00:03:27.170> going<00:03:27.320> to<00:03:27.410> go<00:03:27.500> back<00:03:27.680> to<00:03:27.830> your<00:03:27.950> feet

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340 
finally going to go back to your feet

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.850 
finally going to go back to your feet
where<00:03:29.030> they'll<00:03:29.960> have<00:03:30.080> the<00:03:30.170> same<00:03:30.350> attacks<00:03:30.680> it

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:30.860 
where they'll have the same attacks it

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:32.980 
where they'll have the same attacks it
has<00:03:31.010> now<00:03:31.250> so<00:03:31.970> use<00:03:32.180> whatever<00:03:32.390> magic<00:03:32.690> you<00:03:32.900> have

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:32.990 
has now so use whatever magic you have

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:36.940 
has now so use whatever magic you have
if<00:03:33.260> you<00:03:33.380> want<00:03:33.590> that's<00:03:34.220> pretty<00:03:34.400> effective<00:03:35.950> this

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:36.950 
if you want that's pretty effective this

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:51.250 
if you want that's pretty effective this
kind<00:03:37.250> of<00:03:37.370> a<00:03:38.020> whirlwind<00:03:39.100> thing<00:03:49.870> same<00:03:50.870> rules<00:03:51.050> for

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:51.260 
kind of a whirlwind thing same rules for

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:52.480 
kind of a whirlwind thing same rules for
a<00:03:51.290> tax<00:03:51.500> apply<00:03:51.800> the<00:03:51.860> only<00:03:52.100> thing<00:03:52.250> is<00:03:52.370> you're

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:52.490 
a tax apply the only thing is you're

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:53.770 
a tax apply the only thing is you're
kind<00:03:52.760> of<00:03:52.790> on<00:03:52.880> this<00:03:53.030> weird<00:03:53.240> angle<00:03:53.600> and<00:03:53.720> you

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
kind of on this weird angle and you

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.200 
kind of on this weird angle and you
can't<00:03:54.020> manipulate<00:03:54.200> the<00:03:54.590> camera<00:03:55.030> just<00:03:56.030> keep

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:56.210 
can't manipulate the camera just keep

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:57.190 
can't manipulate the camera just keep
slicing<00:03:56.480> away<00:03:56.720> at<00:03:56.870> this<00:03:56.990> thing<00:03:57.170> and

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 
slicing away at this thing and

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.470 
slicing away at this thing and
eventually<00:03:57.770> it'll<00:03:57.950> be<00:03:58.010> dead<00:03:58.250> and<00:03:59.000> i'll<00:03:59.300> see

00:03:59.470 --> 00:03:59.480 
eventually it'll be dead and i'll see

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.350 
eventually it'll be dead and i'll see
you<00:03:59.510> in<00:03:59.720> the<00:03:59.870> next<00:04:00.020> video
