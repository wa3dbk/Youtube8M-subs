00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:43.720 
but which just almost touching the other

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:48.510 
but which just almost touching the other
tip<00:01:45.360> then<00:01:46.360> you<00:01:46.450> take<00:01:46.689> it<00:01:47.070> beste<00:01:48.070> but<00:01:48.310> that's

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:48.520

tip then you take it beste but that's
the<00:01:48.640> bar<00:01:50.159> and<00:01:51.159> then<00:01:51.340> you<00:01:51.970> fold<00:01:52.210> it<00:01:52.420> like<00:01:53.080> a

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
the bar and then you fold it like a

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.850 
the bar and then you fold it like a
regular<00:01:53.649> airplane<00:01:54.070> and<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:56.200> trick<00:01:56.530> with<00:01:56.679> this

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:56.860 
regular airplane and the trick with this

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.460 
regular airplane and the trick with this
airplane<00:01:57.189> is<00:01:57.549> you<00:01:57.759> have<00:01:57.880> to<00:01:58.060> get<00:01:58.240> this<00:01:59.110> part

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470 
airplane is you have to get this part

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.880 
airplane is you have to get this part
right<00:01:59.530> here<00:02:00.509> really<00:02:01.509> really<00:02:01.810> low<00:02:02.049> otherwise

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
right here really really low otherwise

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:20.400 
right here really really low otherwise
it's<00:02:03.130> going<00:02:03.460> to<00:02:03.549> look<00:02:03.700> right

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.520 

like<00:02:21.410> that<00:02:22.540> then<00:02:23.540> you<00:02:23.660> take<00:02:23.840> the<00:02:23.900> side<00:02:24.260> right

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
like that then you take the side right

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:31.930 
like that then you take the side right
here<00:02:26.650> fold<00:02:27.650> them<00:02:27.800> up<00:02:27.860> just<00:02:28.070> a<00:02:28.220> little<00:02:28.370> bit<00:02:30.940> so

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
here fold them up just a little bit so

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.400 
here fold them up just a little bit so
you<00:02:32.030> have<00:02:32.180> these<00:02:33.490> extra<00:02:34.490> wings<00:02:35.080> and<00:02:36.080> then<00:02:36.290> you

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
you have these extra wings and then you

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.190 
you have these extra wings and then you
tear<00:02:36.650> a<00:02:36.680> little<00:02:37.040> slit<00:02:37.310> right<00:02:37.460> here<00:02:37.960> or<00:02:38.960> you<00:02:39.170> can

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
tear a little slit right here or you can

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.520 
tear a little slit right here or you can
cut<00:02:39.560> it<00:02:39.590> with<00:02:39.680> scissors<00:02:40.990> let<00:02:41.990> me<00:02:42.110> fold<00:02:42.350> that

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
cut it with scissors let me fold that

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.740 
cut it with scissors let me fold that
right<00:02:42.740> there<00:02:43.040> that's<00:02:43.310> going<00:02:44.000> to<00:02:44.060> control<00:02:44.540> the

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
right there that's going to control the

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.820 
right there that's going to control the
way<00:02:44.930> here<00:02:45.340> plane<00:02:46.340> flips<00:02:47.180> and<00:02:47.660> you<00:02:48.470> can<00:02:48.620> pull

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:48.830 
way here plane flips and you can pull

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:51.550 
way here plane flips and you can pull
them<00:02:48.950> down<00:02:49.010> or<00:02:49.580> put<00:02:49.790> one<00:02:50.000> up<00:02:50.210> and<00:02:50.540> then<00:02:51.380> one

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
them down or put one up and then one

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.430 
them down or put one up and then one
down<00:02:51.860> make<00:02:52.580> it<00:02:52.730> turn<00:02:53.000> and<00:02:53.360> do<00:02:53.720> cool<00:02:54.050> stuff<00:02:54.290> like
