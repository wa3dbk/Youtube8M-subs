retro compared to the last time they
retro<00:00:45.090> them<00:00:45.239> and<00:00:45.930> I'll<00:00:46.050> get<00:00:46.289> into<00:00:46.440> that<00:00:46.710> and

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
thinner in comparison to these and it's

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.229 
thinner in comparison to these and it's
some<00:03:19.140> that<00:03:19.260> you<00:03:19.380> can<00:03:19.500> maybe<00:03:19.620> feel<00:03:20.209> more<00:03:21.209> than

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
you can see but it's just too different

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:30.229 
you can see but it's just too different
just<00:03:27.299> just<00:03:27.750> completely<00:03:28.170> different<00:03:29.239> levels

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
just just completely different levels

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:32.479 
just just completely different levels
and<00:03:30.450> kind<00:03:30.690> of<00:03:30.810> it<00:03:31.049> almost<00:03:31.530> I<00:03:31.739> like<00:03:32.070> the<00:03:32.250> way<00:03:32.370> the

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
and kind of it almost I like the way the

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:35.360 
and kind of it almost I like the way the
padding<00:03:32.820> was<00:03:33.030> and<00:03:33.390> these<00:03:34.019> Crazy<00:03:34.440> Eights<00:03:34.709> so<00:03:35.310> it

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
padding was and these Crazy Eights so it

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.160 
padding was and these Crazy Eights so it
was<00:03:35.459> almost<00:03:35.670> kind<00:03:36.030> of<00:03:36.060> off-putting<00:03:36.299> when<00:03:36.930> I've

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
was almost kind of off-putting when I've

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:41.870 
was almost kind of off-putting when I've
tried<00:03:37.739> these<00:03:37.920> on<00:03:37.980> you<00:03:38.940> know<00:03:39.120> but<00:03:39.690> still<00:03:40.880> still
