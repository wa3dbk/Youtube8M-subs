it's quite addictive as well which

00:06:00.389 --> 00:06:02.439 
it's quite addictive as well which
offers<00:06:00.810> after<00:06:01.110> which<00:06:01.440> I<00:06:01.589> find<00:06:01.830> really<00:06:02.099> good

00:06:02.439 --> 00:06:02.449 
offers after which I find really good

00:06:02.449 --> 00:06:07.610

and<00:06:05.029> the<00:06:06.029> purple<00:06:06.389> and<00:06:06.509> black<00:06:06.750> I<00:06:07.080> think<00:06:07.529> is

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:07.620 
and the purple and black I think is

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:10.969 
and the purple and black I think is
really<00:06:07.650> nice<00:06:09.110> color<00:06:10.110> scheme<00:06:10.500> that<00:06:10.650> the<00:06:10.770> hover

00:06:10.969 --> 00:06:10.979 
really nice color scheme that the hover

00:06:10.979 --> 00:06:14.320 
really nice color scheme that the hover
on<00:06:11.400> their<00:06:11.580> skin<00:06:11.789> is<00:06:12.210> really<00:06:12.419> appealing

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:14.330 
on their skin is really appealing

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:16.670 
on their skin is really appealing
sometimes<00:06:15.330> if<00:06:15.629> you're<00:06:15.870> playing<00:06:16.139> it<00:06:16.349> on<00:06:16.500> the

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:16.680 
sometimes if you're playing it on the

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:18.980 
sometimes if you're playing it on the
iphone<00:06:16.949> I've<00:06:17.940> got<00:06:18.150> it<00:06:18.240> on<00:06:18.360> the<00:06:18.449> ipod<00:06:18.810> he

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:18.990 
iphone I've got it on the ipod he

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:21.320 
iphone I've got it on the ipod he
obviously<00:06:19.319> on<00:06:19.589> the<00:06:20.099> iphone<00:06:20.610> they<00:06:21.120> haven't

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:21.330 
obviously on the iphone they haven't

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:26.619 
obviously on the iphone they haven't
been<00:06:21.569> smaller<00:06:22.279> the<00:06:23.279> purple<00:06:23.909> and<00:06:25.069> the<00:06:26.069> black

00:06:26.619 --> 00:06:26.629 
been smaller the purple and the black

00:06:26.629 --> 00:06:29.510 
been smaller the purple and the black
look<00:06:27.629> very<00:06:27.930> similar<00:06:28.289> to<00:06:28.469> me<00:06:28.800> that's<00:06:29.250> one<00:06:29.490> thing

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:29.520 
look very similar to me that's one thing

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:32.390 
look very similar to me that's one thing
I<00:06:29.759> think<00:06:29.969> maybe<00:06:30.120> the<00:06:30.800> the<00:06:31.800> designers<00:06:32.279> are

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:32.400 
I think maybe the the designers are

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:33.649 
I think maybe the the designers are
going<00:06:32.520> to<00:06:32.610> have<00:06:32.729> to<00:06:32.849> look<00:06:33.000> at<00:06:33.120> maybe<00:06:33.270> change

00:06:33.649 --> 00:06:33.659 
going to have to look at maybe change

00:06:33.659 --> 00:06:35.149 
going to have to look at maybe change
your<00:06:33.870> color<00:06:34.080> scheme<00:06:34.259> to<00:06:34.620> something<00:06:34.979> that's

00:06:35.149 --> 00:06:35.159 
your color scheme to something that's

00:06:35.159 --> 00:06:37.760 
your color scheme to something that's
not<00:06:35.430> as<00:06:35.639> sort<00:06:36.569> of<00:06:36.630> difficult<00:06:37.080> to<00:06:37.349> read<00:06:37.620> when

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:37.770 
not as sort of difficult to read when

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:40.360 
not as sort of difficult to read when
it's<00:06:37.949> on<00:06:38.069> such<00:06:38.279> a<00:06:38.310> small<00:06:38.520> screen<00:06:38.669> as<00:06:39.089> the<00:06:39.120> eye

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:40.370 
it's on such a small screen as the eye

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:43.670 
it's on such a small screen as the eye
okay<00:06:41.370> and<00:06:41.610> the<00:06:42.330> only<00:06:42.659> sort<00:06:43.110> of<00:06:43.199> problem<00:06:43.529> are

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:43.680 
okay and the only sort of problem are

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:47.269 
okay and the only sort of problem are
found<00:06:44.189> with<00:06:44.430> the<00:06:44.580> game<00:06:44.789> and<00:06:45.059> usability<00:06:45.719> is<00:06:46.279> if

00:06:47.269 --> 00:06:47.279 
found with the game and usability is if

00:06:47.279 --> 00:06:50.779 
found with the game and usability is if
you<00:06:47.759> if<00:06:48.059> you<00:06:48.240> have<00:06:48.330> misplaced<00:06:48.839> the<00:06:49.199> tile<00:06:49.789> which

00:06:50.779 --> 00:06:50.789 
you if you have misplaced the tile which

00:06:50.789 --> 00:06:52.850 
you if you have misplaced the tile which
it<00:06:50.999> obviously<00:06:51.120> won't<00:06:51.509> let<00:06:51.839> you<00:06:51.960> play<00:06:52.229> take

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:52.860 
it obviously won't let you play take

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:54.769 
it obviously won't let you play take
your<00:06:53.009> move<00:06:53.219> when<00:06:53.879> you<00:06:53.999> try<00:06:54.180> to<00:06:54.210> move<00:06:54.449> it<00:06:54.599> back

00:06:54.769 --> 00:06:54.779 
your move when you try to move it back

00:06:54.779 --> 00:06:56.600 
your move when you try to move it back
I've<00:06:55.020> had<00:06:55.289> the<00:06:55.409> odd<00:06:55.499> occasion<00:06:55.529> where<00:06:56.069> it<00:06:56.279> will

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:56.610 
I've had the odd occasion where it will

00:06:56.610 --> 00:06:58.730 
I've had the odd occasion where it will
not<00:06:56.909> move<00:06:57.150> back<00:06:57.479> and<00:06:57.719> it's<00:06:57.990> take<00:06:58.229> me<00:06:58.439> several

00:06:58.730 --> 00:06:58.740 
not move back and it's take me several

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:00.860 
not move back and it's take me several
attempts<00:06:59.279> to<00:06:59.430> get<00:06:59.550> it<00:06:59.699> get<00:07:00.029> the<00:07:00.180> icon<00:07:00.599> back

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:00.870
