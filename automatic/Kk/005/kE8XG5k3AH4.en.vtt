this<00:00:01.620> is<00:00:01.770> a<00:00:01.800> tutorial<00:00:02.100> video<00:00:02.550> to<00:00:02.790> make<00:00:03.090> a<00:00:03.300> rapid

00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:03.959 
this is a tutorial video to make a rapid

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.030 
this is a tutorial video to make a rapid
fire<00:00:05.150> arrow<00:00:06.150> dispenser<00:00:06.990> that<00:00:07.410> is<00:00:07.560> triggered

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
fire arrow dispenser that is triggered

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.900 
fire arrow dispenser that is triggered
so<00:00:08.189> it<00:00:08.280> doesn't<00:00:08.580> empty<00:00:08.849> itself<00:00:09.290> very<00:00:10.290> quickly

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:10.910 
so it doesn't empty itself very quickly

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:13.400 
so it doesn't empty itself very quickly
first<00:00:11.910> of<00:00:12.059> all<00:00:12.150> you<00:00:12.389> will<00:00:12.660> want<00:00:12.870> to<00:00:12.990> make<00:00:13.139> three

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
first of all you will want to make three

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.530 
first of all you will want to make three
rapid<00:00:13.980> pulses<00:00:14.400> which<00:00:14.730> is<00:00:14.880> what's<00:00:15.059> in<00:00:15.210> front<00:00:15.389> of

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
rapid pulses which is what's in front of

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.170 
rapid pulses which is what's in front of
me<00:00:15.719> they're<00:00:16.590> each<00:00:16.770> made<00:00:17.100> with<00:00:17.430> two<00:00:17.850> redstone

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
me they're each made with two redstone

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.550 
me they're each made with two redstone
torches<00:00:18.840> and<00:00:20.390> redstone<00:00:21.390> behind<00:00:22.260> them<00:00:22.380> like

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
torches and redstone behind them like

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.820 
torches and redstone behind them like
that<00:00:22.590> and<00:00:23.130> on<00:00:23.340> top<00:00:23.369> and<00:00:24.050> leading<00:00:25.050> out<00:00:25.170> like

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
that and on top and leading out like

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.970 
that and on top and leading out like
that<00:00:27.500> as<00:00:29.300> you<00:00:30.300> can<00:00:30.390> see<00:00:30.660> they<00:00:30.960> just<00:00:31.380> rapidly

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
that as you can see they just rapidly

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.100 
that as you can see they just rapidly
pulsate<00:00:32.850> which<00:00:33.270> is<00:00:33.420> why<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:33.600> corporate

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
pulsate which is why the corporate

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.520 
pulsate which is why the corporate
pulsars<00:00:35.510> you'll<00:00:36.510> want<00:00:36.750> to<00:00:36.840> connect<00:00:37.380> them

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
pulsars you'll want to connect them

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.190 
pulsars you'll want to connect them
directly<00:00:37.950> to<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.370> arrow<00:00:39.090> dispenser<00:00:39.750> you<00:00:40.079> will

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
directly to the arrow dispenser you will

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.010 
directly to the arrow dispenser you will
also<00:00:40.440> want<00:00:40.620> to<00:00:41.070> have<00:00:41.399> a<00:00:41.820> redstone<00:00:42.480> torch<00:00:42.600> by

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
also want to have a redstone torch by

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.470 
also want to have a redstone torch by
itself<00:00:43.379> also<00:00:44.219> connected<00:00:45.120> to<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.329> arrow

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
itself also connected to the arrow

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.880 
itself also connected to the arrow
dispenser<00:00:47.960> you'll<00:00:48.960> want<00:00:49.170> arrows<00:00:49.559> and<00:00:49.739> ups

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
dispenser you'll want arrows and ups

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.830 
dispenser you'll want arrows and ups
I'll<00:00:50.250> just<00:00:50.460> load<00:00:50.700> this<00:00:50.879> up<00:00:51.059> now<00:00:51.300> with<00:00:51.539> a<00:00:51.570> whole

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
I'll just load this up now with a whole

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.229 
I'll just load this up now with a whole
bunch<00:00:54.770> now<00:00:55.770> sometimes<00:00:56.309> when<00:00:56.430> constructing

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
bunch now sometimes when constructing

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.720 
bunch now sometimes when constructing
this<00:00:57.390> it<00:00:57.899> will<00:00:58.199> fire<00:00:58.559> by<00:00:58.800> itself<00:00:59.219> until<00:00:59.579> it's

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
this it will fire by itself until it's

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.389 
this it will fire by itself until it's
until<00:01:00.480> you<00:01:00.570> finish<00:01:00.870> building<00:01:01.079> it<00:01:01.289> so<00:01:01.980> leave

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
until you finish building it so leave

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:08.390 
until you finish building it so leave
the<00:01:02.609> arrows<00:01:02.879> out<00:01:03.090> until<00:01:03.539> it's<00:01:04.140> finished<00:01:07.400> this

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
the arrows out until it's finished this

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.340 
the arrows out until it's finished this
redstone<00:01:08.850> here<00:01:09.210> leads<00:01:09.540> to<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:10.020> pressure

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
redstone here leads to the pressure

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.530 
redstone here leads to the pressure
plate<00:01:10.560> which<00:01:10.830> is<00:01:10.860> on<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.130> inside<00:01:11.310> which<00:01:12.299> would

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
plate which is on the inside which would

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.609 
plate which is on the inside which would
trigger<00:01:12.780> it<00:01:13.130> if<00:01:14.130> it<00:01:14.790> was<00:01:14.880> connected

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:15.619 
trigger it if it was connected

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:17.480 
trigger it if it was connected
thankfully<00:01:16.619> it's<00:01:16.740> not<00:01:16.830> otherwise<00:01:17.159> I'd<00:01:17.400> be

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
thankfully it's not otherwise I'd be

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.050 
thankfully it's not otherwise I'd be
dead<00:01:17.670> right<00:01:17.700> now<00:01:19.369> connecting<00:01:20.369> it<00:01:20.729> it<00:01:20.909> will

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
dead right now connecting it it will

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.039 
dead right now connecting it it will
usually<00:01:21.299> fire<00:01:22.880> one<00:01:23.880> arrow<00:01:23.909> maybe<00:01:24.600> not<00:01:24.780> mus

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
usually fire one arrow maybe not mus

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:30.190 
usually fire one arrow maybe not mus
case<00:01:25.259> and<00:01:26.659> as<00:01:27.659> you<00:01:27.810> can<00:01:27.960> see<00:01:27.990> if<00:01:28.229> I<00:01:28.350> trigger<00:01:28.650> it

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200 
case and as you can see if I trigger it

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.710 
case and as you can see if I trigger it
fires<00:01:31.200> a<00:01:31.350> few<00:01:31.680> but<00:01:31.890> not<00:01:32.009> many<00:01:32.240> so<00:01:33.240> ice<00:01:33.329> to<00:01:33.479> stand

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
fires a few but not many so ice to stand

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.510 
fires a few but not many so ice to stand
there<00:01:33.840> however<00:01:34.939> i'd<00:01:35.939> be<00:01:36.119> very<00:01:36.150> dead<00:01:36.600> and<00:01:37.520> as

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
there however i'd be very dead and as

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.039 
there however i'd be very dead and as
you<00:01:38.670> can<00:01:38.790> see<00:01:38.820> it<00:01:39.030> stops<00:01:39.299> itself<00:01:39.659> as<00:01:39.810> soon<00:01:39.960> as

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
you can see it stops itself as soon as

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.639 
you can see it stops itself as soon as
your<00:01:40.200> off<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.650> pressure<00:01:41.220> plate<00:01:42.350> if<00:01:43.350> you<00:01:43.500> have

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
your off the pressure plate if you have

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.249 
your off the pressure plate if you have
any<00:01:43.740> questions<00:01:44.340> or<00:01:44.700> comments<00:01:45.479> just<00:01:45.810> post<00:01:46.049> them
