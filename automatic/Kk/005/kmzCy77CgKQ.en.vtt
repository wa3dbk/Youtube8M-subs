00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
not a hard process it's not something

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.480

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
that I when I first learned about this a

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.680 
that I when I first learned about this a
few<00:02:54.020> years<00:02:54.140> ago<00:02:54.380> I<00:02:54.800> got<00:02:54.980> I<00:02:55.550> just<00:02:56.270> it's<00:02:56.450> the

to<00:03:40.280> 18<00:03:40.640> months<00:03:40.670> and<00:03:41.140> you<00:03:42.140> replace<00:03:42.470> the<00:03:42.650> filter

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:42.950 
to 18 months and you replace the filter

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:45.250 
to 18 months and you replace the filter
inside<00:03:43.100> here<00:03:43.880> and<00:03:44.090> that's<00:03:44.780> about<00:03:44.900> thirty

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.260 
inside here and that's about thirty

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.800 
inside here and that's about thirty
dollars<00:03:45.440> so<00:03:45.830> sixty<00:03:46.400> dollars<00:03:46.700> start<00:03:47.360> with<00:03:47.510> and

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
dollars so sixty dollars start with and

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:49.930 
dollars so sixty dollars start with and
then<00:03:47.900> after<00:03:48.350> a<00:03:48.380> year<00:03:48.440> each<00:03:49.430> year<00:03:49.489> thirty

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:49.940 
then after a year each year thirty

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:51.640 
then after a year each year thirty
dollars<00:03:50.239> for<00:03:50.270> the<00:03:50.510> filter<00:03:50.810> so<00:03:51.050> to<00:03:51.410> me<00:03:51.530> that's

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
dollars for the filter so to me that's

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:53.440 
dollars for the filter so to me that's
not<00:03:51.890> bad<00:03:52.130> there<00:03:52.430> are<00:03:52.610> other<00:03:52.820> filters<00:03:53.270> out

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:53.450 
not bad there are other filters out

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:55.990 
not bad there are other filters out
there<00:03:53.690> that<00:03:54.380> are<00:03:54.560> more<00:03:54.770> expensive<00:03:55.160> and<00:03:55.730> some

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
there that are more expensive and some

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.280 
there that are more expensive and some
that<00:03:56.090> are<00:03:56.209> even<00:03:56.239> cheaper<00:03:56.600> than<00:03:56.900> this<00:03:57.050> so<00:03:57.260> you

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 
that are even cheaper than this so you

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:59.470 
that are even cheaper than this so you
really<00:03:57.739> just<00:03:57.770> have<00:03:58.010> to<00:03:58.130> find<00:03:58.400> which<00:03:59.270> one<00:03:59.300> that

00:03:59.470 --> 00:03:59.480 
really just have to find which one that

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.510 
really just have to find which one that
works<00:03:59.780> for<00:04:00.050> your<00:04:00.110> budget<00:04:00.470> and<00:04:00.650> go<00:04:01.370> with<00:04:01.489> that

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:01.520 
works for your budget and go with that

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:03.460 
works for your budget and go with that
one<00:04:01.760> the<00:04:02.180> main<00:04:02.360> thing<00:04:02.570> I<00:04:02.660> look<00:04:02.870> for<00:04:02.900> is<00:04:03.230> just

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:03.470 
one the main thing I look for is just

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:05.290 
one the main thing I look for is just
which<00:04:04.370> one<00:04:04.400> is<00:04:04.640> going<00:04:04.730> to<00:04:04.790> get<00:04:04.940> out<00:04:05.030> the<00:04:05.120> most

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:05.300 
which one is going to get out the most

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:07.090 
which one is going to get out the most
chlorine<00:04:05.660> from<00:04:05.870> your<00:04:05.989> water<00:04:06.170> mine<00:04:06.560> says<00:04:06.920> it

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:07.100 
chlorine from your water mine says it

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:10.540 
chlorine from your water mine says it
can<00:04:07.220> get<00:04:07.340> out<00:04:07.459> about<00:04:07.580> 95%<00:04:08.270> of<00:04:08.810> the<00:04:09.650> chlorine

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:10.550 
can get out about 95% of the chlorine

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:12.580 
can get out about 95% of the chlorine
from<00:04:10.880> the<00:04:11.060> water<00:04:11.239> so<00:04:11.600> that's<00:04:12.110> a<00:04:12.260> pretty<00:04:12.410> big

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:12.590 
from the water so that's a pretty big

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:16.510 
from the water so that's a pretty big
thing<00:04:12.830> for<00:04:13.040> me<00:04:13.989> let<00:04:14.989> me<00:04:15.020> show<00:04:15.110> you<00:04:15.320> how<00:04:16.250> I'm

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:16.520 
thing for me let me show you how I'm

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:19.750 
thing for me let me show you how I'm
going<00:04:16.580> to<00:04:16.700> install<00:04:17.150> the<00:04:17.359> filter<00:04:17.510> and<00:04:18.549> get<00:04:19.549> my

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:19.760 
going to install the filter and get my

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.090 
going to install the filter and get my
plumbing<00:04:20.570> skills<00:04:21.080> handy<00:04:21.530> here<00:04:21.710> let's<00:04:21.919> see<00:04:22.010> if

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:22.100 
plumbing skills handy here let's see if

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:22.810 
plumbing skills handy here let's see if
I<00:04:22.220> can<00:04:22.400> do<00:04:22.550> that

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:22.820 
I can do that

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:25.330 
I can do that
or<00:04:23.030> so<00:04:23.300> here<00:04:23.540> I<00:04:23.600> go<00:04:23.780> I'm<00:04:23.900> putting<00:04:24.200> on<00:04:24.320> my<00:04:24.560> shower

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:25.340 
or so here I go I'm putting on my shower

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:26.980 
or so here I go I'm putting on my shower
filter<00:04:25.640> you're<00:04:25.970> just<00:04:26.150> going<00:04:26.390> to<00:04:26.540> hook<00:04:26.660> it<00:04:26.810> onto

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:26.990 
filter you're just going to hook it onto

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:29.800 
filter you're just going to hook it onto
the<00:04:27.730> fixture<00:04:28.730> part<00:04:29.000> of<00:04:29.210> the<00:04:29.330> wall

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:29.810 
the fixture part of the wall

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:33.270 
the fixture part of the wall
and<00:04:29.900> then<00:04:30.170> just<00:04:30.470> twist<00:04:30.650> it<00:04:30.800> on<00:04:31.990> until<00:04:32.990> it's

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280 
and then just twist it on until it's

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.650 
and then just twist it on until it's
tight<00:04:34.280> I<00:04:34.580> think<00:04:34.940> it<00:04:35.030> says<00:04:35.210> maybe<00:04:35.480> the

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:35.660 
tight I think it says maybe the

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:40.570 
tight I think it says maybe the
directions<00:04:36.020> not<00:04:36.370> overly<00:04:37.370> tight<00:04:38.830> just<00:04:39.830> twist

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:40.580 
directions not overly tight just twist

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:42.310 
directions not overly tight just twist
it<00:04:40.700> on<00:04:40.790> so<00:04:41.120> here<00:04:41.360> as<00:04:41.600> I<00:04:41.720> said<00:04:41.780> this<00:04:42.020> is<00:04:42.080> the

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:42.320 
it on so here as I said this is the

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:44.290 
it on so here as I said this is the
filter<00:04:42.500> part<00:04:42.920> and<00:04:43.310> this<00:04:43.670> is<00:04:43.730> the<00:04:43.880> showerhead

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:44.300 
filter part and this is the showerhead

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:48.430 
filter part and this is the showerhead
so<00:04:44.630> I<00:04:44.980> think<00:04:45.980> we<00:04:46.340> are<00:04:46.490> good<00:04:46.820> to<00:04:46.970> go<00:04:47.000> I<00:04:47.450> did<00:04:48.050> it<00:04:48.230> I

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:48.440 
so I think we are good to go I did it I

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:52.300 
so I think we are good to go I did it I
installed<00:04:49.130> it<00:04:49.370> you<00:04:49.970> can<00:04:50.210> do<00:04:50.390> it<00:04:50.510> too<00:04:51.070> let's<00:04:52.070> see

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:52.310 
installed it you can do it too let's see

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:53.160 
installed it you can do it too let's see
if<00:04:52.370> it<00:04:52.520> works

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:53.170 
if it works

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:56.370 
if it works
yay<00:04:54.170> it<00:04:54.710> works

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:56.380 
yay it works

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:59.200 
yay it works
we<00:04:57.380> have<00:04:57.560> filtered<00:04:58.040> water<00:04:58.610> because<00:04:59.090> that

00:04:59.200 --> 00:04:59.210 
we have filtered water because that

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:01.360 
we have filtered water because that
pretty<00:04:59.360> much<00:04:59.540> sums<00:04:59.810> up<00:05:00.050> how<00:05:00.890> to<00:05:00.950> filter<00:05:01.340> your

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:01.370 
pretty much sums up how to filter your

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:04.030 
pretty much sums up how to filter your
shower<00:05:01.790> water<00:05:02.090> to<00:05:02.750> soften<00:05:03.140> your<00:05:03.380> hair<00:05:03.500> soften

your skin and to decrease the toxins in
your<00:05:06.290> body<00:05:06.500> I<00:05:06.800> hope<00:05:07.370> that<00:05:07.610> maybe<00:05:07.940> you<00:05:08.420> will

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:08.510
