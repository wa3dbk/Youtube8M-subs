00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:15.460
 hello my name is denis this plot 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.230
 continuation of the show connection dear 

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:19.869
 Thai diagnostic equipment to 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:22.270
 car ford galaxy '95 release with 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:24.130
 2 liter gasoline engine in this 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:26.290
 parts we will see what shows 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.630
 autocom cdp plus in modes a b d and 

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:31.360
 search for errors in all blocks view 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:35.380
 parameters start from the top click on 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:38.290
 rim button tester initiation 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:40.840
 or rather it would be initialization 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:45.450
 sounds just to be connected and she 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:47.920
 The first item was connected 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.870
 top shows information about 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.890
 lamp status protocol 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:57.940
 malfunctions and total errors 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:59.800
 bottom right readiness tests answer from 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.079
 engine control unit for question 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:04.960
 scanner from which monitoring system i 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:07.300
 I will receive information to the standard obd2 block 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.430
 answers about the few who are 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:11.440
 due to the failure of the initial conditions 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.630
 test results for lambda test 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.280
 and and heating is missing that is here 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.590
 no error report control unit 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.180
 engine about the number of systems that 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.880
 he tracks the results of passing 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:23.950
 tests of these systems for passing the test 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.810
 bullet where you only need to ride on 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.390
 the city until at least once 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.520
 obd2 driving test will not be completed 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:33.329
 sure sign of the ride 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.770
 no warning p1000 test 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:38.380
 short insertion from video to 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:41.079
 which all tests with this pay 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:43.590
 attention whenever 1000 no lambda tests 

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:43.590
 passed 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.330
 smoothly proceed to reading errors as in 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.250
 the previous paragraph, the data is duplicated 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.500
 because the engine control unit and 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.600
 obd2 module fix the same 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.970
 so in fact errors are exactly two 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:03.030
 times less their decoding we are called in 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:03.479
 the next part erase errors until 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.549
 will be 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.530
 move on to the point that should 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:10.080
 show us the life date provided 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.090
 obd2 standard will not be a new date 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.640
 reasons see 2 not full support 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.530
 data stream cars 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.230
 the inability of the scanner to read the data in 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.180
 In this mode, the next item is the frieze frame. 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.160
 frozen frames with errors and 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:26.160
 the parameters at which they arose 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:28.350
 no further test lamda control module 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.000
 engine has in the arsenal means 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:32.010
 monitoring the testing of major 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.980
 engine systems as well as preservation 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.269
 test monitor results 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.640
 own and the results of these tests we 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:40.769
 observed in the unit readiness tests for 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.600
 a good test is essentially a response block 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:44.700
 motor control to scanner question 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:47.459
 you remembered how much the last trip 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:52.410
 made the minimum voltage lambda 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:56.480
 and the maximum and switching time 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:58.140
 between rich and poor mix and back 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.420
 unit responds 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.820
 I either did not remember because of the full 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:05.070
 support b2 standards either request 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:05.700
 some kind of incorrect data therefore not 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:07.530
 will show 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.989
 not unlocking will be able to show 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:12.060
 programmed 450 millivolts 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:15.359
 voltage corresponding to the ideal 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:17.670
 air fuel ratio of 14cm 

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:19.380
 seventies to one also given 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:21.150
 the stress performs the delimiting 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:24.329
 the function is all that higher 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:26.040
 rich mixture of everything below poor was 

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:28.980
 would be interesting to see the main thing in it 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:31.350
 300 millivolt switching time test 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:34.350
 up to 600 millivolts is the switching time 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:36.959
 between poor and rich mix and back 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:38.959
 switching from 600 to 300 millivolts 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:41.160
 between rich and poor mix 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:43.709
 maximum switching time should 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:46.200
 exceed 100 milliseconds if more then 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:48.900
 an umbrella is considered to be lazy and tired 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.790
 life also remembers the minimum 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.079
 and the maximum voltage of the lambda 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:55.110
 observations on a warm car 

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:57.319
 voltage varies from 100 to 700 5000 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:59.810
 idle which is pretty good 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:01.909
 the numbers you see now are not quite 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:04.730
 clearly reflect reality 

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:06.730
 because of the full support and can obd2 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:09.620
 the scanner is unable to read data 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:11.510
 the next item is the answer to the scanner question 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:14.090
 retrieving system test data 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:15.620
 egr catalyst lambda probe system 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:18.079
 fuel tank ventilation 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:20.329
 this mode is not supported by cars 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:22.160
 next test initialization 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:23.360
 actuators also 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:25.430
 a warning appears 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:27.590
 unavailable mode and the last of 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:29.810
 inaccessible information like 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:30.889
 one mileage code and other information 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:32.630
 reference character 

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:34.490
 all available not available modes 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:36.979
 considered time to return to 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:41.090
 the main menu is on the queue all point 

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:45.500
 system to activate it you need to click 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:47.210
 the corresponding button on the big 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:49.400
 account is a global search for errors 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:51.289
 selected program control blocks 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.820
 need to tell the type of engine to remove 

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:55.960
 ticks from the blocks which is in this 

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:55.960
 car missing 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:07.879
 by pressing a button like play and 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:13.370
 additional confirmation will begin 

00:05:07.879 --> 00:05:15.020
 search for errors in all blocks of the process 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:18.259
 take more than a minute and watch it 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:20.060
 so there is no special meaning 

00:05:18.259 --> 00:05:22.009
 I cut out the excess now you will see 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:23.900
 last seconds of the search which 

00:05:22.009 --> 00:05:26.620
 ends with a plate of execution 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:29.479
 procedure 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:31.460
 click on the icon forward and we see 

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:34.069
 errors in the central locking unit 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:38.150
 the driver's door apparently did not want 

00:05:34.069 --> 00:05:41.629
 it didnâ€™t open again 

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:43.580
 in the tab is marked in gray hidden 

00:05:41.629 --> 00:05:45.590
 list of components in which the scanner 

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:48.229
 addressed during the search for errors but 

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:50.449
 received no response that naturally 

00:05:48.229 --> 00:05:52.009
 since there are no such components and 

00:05:50.449 --> 00:05:54.020
 the most multifunctional unit 

00:05:52.009 --> 00:05:55.879
 to which they belong come back 

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:59.090
 back in the pillow control box 

00:05:55.879 --> 00:06:01.280
 security see one mistake at the very 

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:03.110
 This is not a mistake but information about 

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:04.729
 no errors exactly the same 

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:07.090
 warnings are recorded in blocks 

00:06:04.729 --> 00:06:09.979
 immobilizer and tidy 

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:12.940
 out in the engine control unit found 

00:06:09.979 --> 00:06:12.940
 a whole bunch of mistakes 

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:17.620
 we will analyze them in the next part 

00:06:22.639 --> 00:06:27.650
 at the bottom are the error removal buttons 

00:06:25.159 --> 00:06:30.050
 go to parameter scan mode 

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:32.599
 engine save printing 

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:34.849
 errors and the button further which now is not 

00:06:32.599 --> 00:06:36.979
 active but active back button 

00:06:34.849 --> 00:06:40.490
 which will return to the block selection menu for 

00:06:36.979 --> 00:06:42.499
 scanning from this me already nothing 

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:43.279
 required and needed to return to the most 

00:06:42.499 --> 00:06:45.020
 Main menu 

00:06:43.279 --> 00:06:47.419
 in the next part we will select the block 

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:49.729
 engine management estimate lacquer date and 

00:06:47.419 --> 00:06:52.599
 run the test and thanks for watching 

00:06:49.729 --> 00:06:52.599
 and wish you all the best
