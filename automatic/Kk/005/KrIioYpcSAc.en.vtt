00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:14.480
 hello dear hungry panna cotta is yes 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:17.060
 especially as an Italian very 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:19.430
 known, however, can we see about 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:20.900
 can also be good for a pie 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:23.000
 and if they are with one 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.400
 fruity 12 is provided she comes 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.410
 also visually good and that the whole without 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.830
 Baking does not work out well 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:30.460
 damage 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:33.820
 we need it 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:36.250
 a vanilla pod sugar board and 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.930
 you can gelatinised leaf or leaf 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.910
 like I use statins immediately 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:42.100
 Vegans just better an active 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.870
 However, the variant would have to be too 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.300
 the butter we still need through 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:48.309
 margarine and the cream through 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.589
 example so yazan replace works 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:53.470
 but we also need martini 

00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:55.659
 this delicious coat biscuits and red 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:57.729
 either make ready or make them 

00:00:55.659 --> 00:00:59.860
 even how it works is easy 

00:00:57.729 --> 00:01:02.730
 is there a video on it from her? 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:04.929
 end and in the infobox is linked 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.860
 First we cut with one as possible 

00:01:04.929 --> 00:01:07.990
 sharp knife 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:11.410
 The vanilla pod is lengthwise and has 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:15.280
 the mark out now we go into one 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:17.979
 pot the cream the sugar that was nice 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:21.179
 and even the school itself would be everything 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:23.740
 go through and let it boil 

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:26.200
 then under low heat 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.659
 Stir occasionally for about 15 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.569
 Simmer minutes then from the stove 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:32.830
 take and allow to cool slightly 

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:35.890
 we never put diamanti in one 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:37.600
 Freezer bags open up to this 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:40.479
 knock the biscuits a bit with the 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:44.009
 dough roller and then work it up 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:44.009
 they are crumbling really fine 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.200
 then we give it to the liquid 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:52.010
 butter and mix everything thoroughly 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:54.409
 have a baking mold with me 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:56.720
 a diameter of 18 cm becomes light 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:59.509
 Greased given the biscuit mass 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:01.550
 distribute this to the floor and press 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:03.619
 Then firmly with your hands 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:05.030
 then the shape for about half 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:07.340
 hour cool 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.979
 Incidentally, panna cotta means cooked 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:12.590
 cream and we pour this through now 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:14.150
 strainer into a suitable tube and tube 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.130
 then the gelatin 1 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.870
 You should use gelatine or magazines 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:19.580
 then use it after the 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.680
 Instructions on the pack everything 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.570
 Mix thoroughly with each other and then 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.580
 first set aside until the mass 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:27.830
 to gel in the meantime begins 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.959
 Let's enter the other half of the room 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.000
 a suitable vessel and beat it 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:34.069
 Stiff the cooked and with gelantine 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.380
 his mass starts to mix 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:38.840
 it will take time to lose vigorously 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:40.160
 Add the whipped cream and 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.920
 to lift these under 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:45.260
 and this mixture is now on the 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.390
 meanwhile recovered crumb soil 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.160
 how to distribute the weight they emphasize 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.410
 smooth as a small palette knife 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:53.180
 is perfect but could be 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:54.470
 use another or a spoon 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.690
 especially since it is not at all 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:59.120
 arrives that everything is particularly smooth 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:01.370
 because it's still going on and on 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.079
 Let's take part of the red short 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:06.380
 and work with them earlier 

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:09.620
 died after that we give her in blots 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:11.959
 spoonful on the saale mass and 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:14.329
 pull through this streak with shaped 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:16.549
 a fork and you can more or 

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:19.310
 At least that's what makes it less intense 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:20.840
 it is precisely this world optic that arises 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:23.180
 if he have done this give the 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:25.609
 pie again for three to four hours 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.630
 in the fridge and then you can 

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:28.910
 be served 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:30.680
 give in from the remaining red groats in 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:32.870
 the middle will be today or enough 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.910
 In any case, we have separately 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:37.519
 then a very tasty tasting otte 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:40.790
 I wish you a lot of fun with the 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:43.219
 preparation and a pretty good appetite 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:44.900
 and if you want to see it again 

00:03:43.219 --> 00:03:45.799
 red groats just made by yourself 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.810
 can be 

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:50.060
 or you shoot over the new minutes 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:52.010
 for which also red groats is needed 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:54.769
 wants to prepare then look 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:56.269
 just go into these videos and 

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:58.640
 if not done, I am glad 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:04:00.439
 me, of course, very much about yours but me 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:00.890
 remains to be said until the next 

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:03.909
 times 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:03.909
 bye Bye
