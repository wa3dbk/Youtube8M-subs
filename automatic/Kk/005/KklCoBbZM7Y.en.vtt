00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
unique opportunity to see how both work

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:34.899 
unique opportunity to see how both work
synergistically<00:01:28.630> go<00:01:29.630> ahead<00:01:33.520> you<00:01:34.520> want<00:01:34.670> to<00:01:34.729> try

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:34.909 
synergistically go ahead you want to try

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:39.810 
synergistically go ahead you want to try
and<00:01:35.119> go<00:01:35.270> half<00:01:35.659> swing<00:01:35.960> yeah<00:01:36.320> there<00:01:36.530> you<00:01:36.619> go<00:01:37.990> now

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:39.820 
and go half swing yeah there you go now

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.430 
and go half swing yeah there you go now
when<00:01:40.820> you<00:01:40.940> come<00:01:41.180> down<00:01:41.450> when<00:01:41.930> you<00:01:42.080> come<00:01:42.289> back

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:42.440 
when you come down when you come back

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.210 
when you come down when you come back
down<00:01:42.680> this<00:01:42.830> way<00:01:42.890> a<00:01:43.490> stroke<00:01:44.450> survivor<00:01:45.220> loses

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:46.220 
down this way a stroke survivor loses

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.190 
down this way a stroke survivor loses
the<00:01:47.210> ability<00:01:47.659> to<00:01:48.440> control<00:01:49.399> the<00:01:49.640> affected<00:01:50.119> limb

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200 
the ability to control the affected limb

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.230 
the ability to control the affected limb
it's<00:01:51.200> not<00:01:51.350> that<00:01:51.560> the<00:01:51.679> limits<00:01:52.009> week<00:01:52.250> is<00:01:52.580> that

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
it's not that the limits week is that

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.600 
it's not that the limits week is that
the<00:01:53.360> wiring<00:01:53.929> to<00:01:54.229> that<00:01:54.470> limb<00:01:54.710> has<00:01:54.950> been<00:01:55.220> severed

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 
the wiring to that limb has been severed

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:00.580 
the wiring to that limb has been severed
or<00:01:56.479> damaged<00:01:56.899> and<00:01:58.630> the<00:01:59.630> not<00:02:00.020> only<00:02:00.140> do<00:02:00.319> you<00:02:00.380> lose

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
or damaged and the not only do you lose

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.520 
or damaged and the not only do you lose
control<00:02:00.920> that<00:02:01.610> you<00:02:01.729> lose<00:02:01.970> sensation<00:02:02.240> and<00:02:02.899> so<00:02:03.500> a

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
control that you lose sensation and so a

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.559 
control that you lose sensation and so a
stroke<00:02:03.920> survivor<00:02:04.130> would<00:02:04.700> never<00:02:04.970> be<00:02:05.299> able<00:02:05.420> to

00:02:05.559 --> 00:02:05.569 
stroke survivor would never be able to

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:09.190 
stroke survivor would never be able to
do<00:02:05.810> this<00:02:06.909> okay<00:02:07.909> right<00:02:08.299> with<00:02:08.479> the<00:02:08.569> affected<00:02:08.989> leg

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
do this okay right with the affected leg

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.430 
do this okay right with the affected leg
lower<00:02:10.130> themselves<00:02:10.580> down<00:02:11.239> right<00:02:11.870> I<00:02:11.900> simply

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
lower themselves down right I simply

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.350 
lower themselves down right I simply
haven't<00:02:12.650> got<00:02:12.950> this<00:02:13.130> be<00:02:13.489> the<00:02:13.940> ability<00:02:14.299> to

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
haven't got this be the ability to

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.840 
haven't got this be the ability to
control<00:02:14.690> away<00:02:14.959> and<00:02:15.680> so<00:02:16.010> one<00:02:16.310> of<00:02:16.340> the<00:02:16.459> problems

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.850 
control away and so one of the problems

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:22.180 
control away and so one of the problems
is<00:02:16.970> that<00:02:17.030> they<00:02:17.239> end<00:02:17.420> up<00:02:17.600> doing<00:02:17.900> this<00:02:20.980> right<00:02:21.980> and

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
is that they end up doing this right and

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.970 
is that they end up doing this right and
romantically<00:02:22.340> right<00:02:23.060> now<00:02:23.209> holding<00:02:23.780> on<00:02:23.959> and<00:02:24.769> so

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
romantically right now holding on and so

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.580 
romantically right now holding on and so
forth<00:02:25.220> abundantly<00:02:25.430> the<00:02:28.299> mechanism<00:02:29.299> of<00:02:29.359> action

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
forth abundantly the mechanism of action

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.069 
forth abundantly the mechanism of action
is<00:02:30.590> to<00:02:30.650> try<00:02:31.100> to<00:02:31.130> help<00:02:31.489> the<00:02:31.790> brain<00:02:32.120> reconnect

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:33.079 
is to try to help the brain reconnect

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:35.979 
is to try to help the brain reconnect
with<00:02:33.380> the<00:02:33.530> affected<00:02:33.980> limb<00:02:34.720> so<00:02:35.720> we're<00:02:35.870> not

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:35.989 
with the affected limb so we're not

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:37.870 
with the affected limb so we're not
trying<00:02:36.320> to<00:02:36.560> adjust<00:02:36.829> for<00:02:37.070> the<00:02:37.190> strength<00:02:37.579> of<00:02:37.820> the

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
trying to adjust for the strength of the

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.449 
trying to adjust for the strength of the
patient<00:02:38.329> here<00:02:38.630> we're<00:02:39.350> trying<00:02:39.620> to<00:02:39.799> create<00:02:40.010> a

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 
patient here we're trying to create a

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:44.289 
patient here we're trying to create a
set<00:02:40.880> of<00:02:41.000> stimuli<00:02:41.570> from<00:02:41.989> the<00:02:42.320> leg<00:02:42.560> that<00:02:43.519> travels

00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:44.299 
set of stimuli from the leg that travels

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:46.240 
set of stimuli from the leg that travels
to<00:02:44.510> the<00:02:44.660> brain<00:02:44.840> and<00:02:45.230> the<00:02:45.590> reigns<00:02:45.799> is<00:02:45.980> all<00:02:46.100> wait

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
to the brain and the reigns is all wait

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.370 
to the brain and the reigns is all wait
a<00:02:46.340> minute<00:02:46.549> that's<00:02:46.730> a<00:02:46.820> leg<00:02:47.000> over<00:02:47.180> there<00:02:47.480> let<00:02:48.200> me

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
a minute that's a leg over there let me

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.710 
a minute that's a leg over there let me
see<00:02:48.560> like<00:02:48.769> in<00:02:48.950> controller<00:02:49.340> and<00:02:49.730> so<00:02:50.209> part<00:02:50.510> of

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
see like in controller and so part of

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.870 
see like in controller and so part of
that<00:02:50.930> is<00:02:51.170> doing<00:02:51.530> things<00:02:51.769> physiologically<00:02:52.730> and

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880 
that is doing things physiologically and

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.270 
that is doing things physiologically and
functionally<00:02:53.420> correct<00:02:53.630> so<00:02:54.590> now<00:02:54.799> I<00:02:54.829> want<00:02:55.250> you

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
functionally correct so now I want you

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.580 
functionally correct so now I want you
to<00:02:55.459> lead<00:02:55.700> with<00:02:55.880> your<00:02:56.090> good<00:02:56.269> leg<00:02:56.590> lowering

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
to lead with your good leg lowering

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:01.270 
to lead with your good leg lowering
yourself<00:02:57.799> with<00:02:58.130> your<00:02:58.310> affected<00:02:58.790> leg

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:09.640 

then<00:03:01.970> swing<00:03:02.300> through<00:03:07.000> yeah<00:03:08.000> feel<00:03:08.630> that<00:03:08.720> it's

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
then swing through yeah feel that it's

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:12.520 
then swing through yeah feel that it's
given<00:03:09.890> me<00:03:09.920> a<00:03:10.010> lot<00:03:10.160> more<00:03:11.050> resistance<00:03:12.050> as<00:03:12.350> I

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
given me a lot more resistance as I

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:15.280 
given me a lot more resistance as I
unfledged<00:03:13.130> on<00:03:13.610> my<00:03:14.150> right<00:03:14.360> leg<00:03:14.510> that's<00:03:14.930> karai

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
unfledged on my right leg that's karai

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.380 
unfledged on my right leg that's karai
it's<00:03:15.860> slowing<00:03:16.100> you<00:03:16.280> down<00:03:16.310> kind<00:03:17.000> of<00:03:17.060> providing

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:17.390 
it's slowing you down kind of providing

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:19.090 
it's slowing you down kind of providing
some<00:03:17.660> feedback<00:03:17.989> that's<00:03:18.319> correct<00:03:18.680> that's

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.100 
some feedback that's correct that's

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.910 
some feedback that's correct that's
correct<00:03:19.340> Eddie<00:03:20.260> and<00:03:21.260> just<00:03:21.380> go<00:03:21.500> ahead<00:03:21.620> and<00:03:21.800> do

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 
correct Eddie and just go ahead and do

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:28.050 
correct Eddie and just go ahead and do
that<00:03:21.980> again<00:03:22.280> yeah<00:03:22.459> and<00:03:25.720> so<00:03:26.720> a<00:03:26.989> stroke<00:03:27.440> survivor

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
that again yeah and so a stroke survivor

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.240 
that again yeah and so a stroke survivor
we<00:03:29.060> don't<00:03:29.300> want<00:03:29.630> even<00:03:29.840> training<00:03:30.230> pathologic<00:03:31.160> I

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.250 
we don't want even training pathologic I

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:33.640 
we don't want even training pathologic I
could<00:03:31.700> never<00:03:31.850> figure<00:03:32.840> out<00:03:32.989> how<00:03:33.320> to<00:03:33.380> get

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
could never figure out how to get

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:36.850 
could never figure out how to get
anything<00:03:34.300> okay<00:03:35.300> in<00:03:35.780> fact<00:03:36.019> that<00:03:36.230> you<00:03:36.380> know<00:03:36.410> it's

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:36.860 
anything okay in fact that you know it's

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:39.250 
anything okay in fact that you know it's
all<00:03:37.010> compensatory<00:03:37.610> strategies<00:03:38.110> but<00:03:39.110> they

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260 
all compensatory strategies but they

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.560 
all compensatory strategies but they
would<00:03:39.410> keep<00:03:39.590> which<00:03:40.459> is<00:03:40.640> just<00:03:40.850> get<00:03:41.060> yourself<00:03:41.180> up

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:41.570 
would keep which is just get yourself up

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:43.150 
would keep which is just get yourself up
the<00:03:41.690> stairs<00:03:41.930> laughter<00:03:42.380> like<00:03:42.590> that<00:03:42.769> right

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:43.160 
the stairs laughter like that right

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.280 
the stairs laughter like that right
right<00:03:43.489> and<00:03:43.850> so<00:03:43.970> what<00:03:44.120> happens<00:03:44.600> is<00:03:44.750> the<00:03:44.900> patient

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.290 
right and so what happens is the patient

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.850 
right and so what happens is the patient
never<00:03:45.470> really<00:03:45.800> improves<00:03:46.160> functionally
