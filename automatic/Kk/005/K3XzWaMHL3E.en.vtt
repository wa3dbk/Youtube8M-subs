00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:40.490
 hello friends useful Chachi 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:41.840
 guitarists that such instants today we are going 

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:43.850
 to make a video a little different 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.050
 because throughout these years he has 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.150
 there were many questions that have 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.370
 repeated and we have decided to make a video 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.870
 putting together some of them for a little 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.400
 solve the although maybe already 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.440
 we have talked about them in different 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.330
 videos with our facebook but here 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.920
 we are going to comment on them and that's how we got everything 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:59.059
 of doubts because they are pretty things 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.550
 simple to solve 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:04.420
 let's see 7 questions that we 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:06.850
 you ask if 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.619
 we are self-taught that is not 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.170
 it means that we have not studied 

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:12.790
 because we have studied a lot but for 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.880
 our account and the material that we 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:17.890
 I was interested in the 90s before 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.270
 We learned in our adolescence 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.190
 we did not have the facilities that there are 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.229
 now with so much youtube with so much 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:25.780
 understand with so much material continues for 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:28.420
 which it lasted example by institutes 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:30.520
 it was this kind of thing the hard boards 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.920
 tablature books hundreds and hundreds 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.000
 of them the truth is that a little 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.240
 our influences in the area 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.979
 they were pretty from galleys what 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.780
 which was good enough to polish the 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:43.390
 technique one of the things that I 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:46.330
 used although they were a bit expensive in 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:48.039
 truth was to buy vhs that were bought 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:51.159
 by catalog and sent by the 

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:53.440
 mail from absent guitarists or are we going 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:56.520
 to make that jacket a vhs so you see 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.520
 youth what was 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:07.620
 original are 33 hours to death in addition to 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.479
 the great advantage that thank god 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:11.730
 this one also had on windows when the 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.820
 video you learned enough english yo 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:19.170
 I think that Englishman thanks to this 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:21.000
 another thing but it was more like to 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.950
 letting go with English so everything was 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.379
 lie 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.390
 it depends on your goals if you want 

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:29.670
 to play like kurt cobain because he hears with 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:32.310
 four chords you can get very very 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.200
 away and elio lopez a lot but if 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.269
 you want to play because I 'm like jimi 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.700
 hendrix or inn and you need 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:40.890
 much more time much easier and about 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.530
 much more practice also the approach of 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.880
 the years does not have much logic if you 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.950
 many years go by but if you practice 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.440
 much sitting on the sofa not set that 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.989
 spend years you will not touch better things 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.930
 how much time do you invest in practicing each 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:58.560
 day for example I think that one hour to 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:00.750
 day five days a week and things a 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.610
 aÃ±ito you are going to play very cool but clear whether 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:05.310
 no no no it's not for years of people saying 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:08.040
 well I five years son of lotus commented 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:12.330
 basile well as they are not the years 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:14.760
 time you're practicing me and patience 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:17.880
 this is not asked often and I 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:19.800
 I wonder why not try them and support 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:22.020
 a video with an electric and you have 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:24.690
 an acoustic or a classic as it freezes 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:26.760
 and see if it sounds and would be a brete itself 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.960
 but if you took it out of doubt you can 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.550
 play practically everything 

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:31.080
 regardless of whether one is 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:33.390
 playing with distortion and that you do not have 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:35.610
 distortions just like the notes are the 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:37.260
 notes and the techniques are going to sound that is 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:39.540
 what will not sound like this guy 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.010
 of guitar those sold do not go to any 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:43.170
 side stretch the rope and it is not 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:45.800
 going up in no tone then you ask 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:49.530
 it's impossible they do not come out they can not be touched 

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:53.120
 linked with acoustic or classical 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.120
 Spanish clear that you can 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:58.770
 it was pretty strong 

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:08.590
 you can donate so give it a shot 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:08.590
 there is no problem the classical 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:12.640
 you know the notes of the guitar is very 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:14.440
 well I would not put it as a goal 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.420
 put you to broil the notes of 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:18.640
 where to go if you like the guitar and 

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:19.989
 practices will end up knowing about the I 

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:21.940
 I think I know it and where I 'm at 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:25.400
 all and it's never hard for me to memorize 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:27.710
 between the system that has octaves 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.770
 things are repeated and that from 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:32.630
 a fret 12 everything comes to be the same 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:34.789
 if you get to touch it ends up coming out 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:36.680
 the notes with time but neither do you 

00:04:34.789 --> 00:04:40.460
 overwhelms that nothing happens that you reason is 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:42.050
 the best and without masters as they come out 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:43.759
 Well, if you like our videos 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:45.800
 usual the games we have in 

00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:48.199
 our website are very similar but with 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:50.599
 more information everything more explained with 

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:54.229
 more calm and you are accompanying for 

00:04:50.599 --> 00:04:56.479
 be able to practice and in general content 

00:04:54.229 --> 00:04:58.880
 a wider one and not just get to 

00:04:56.479 --> 00:05:00.830
 touch the examples we teach but 

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:03.380
 then also how can I use this 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:05.030
 kind of examples scales and resources for 

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:08.169
 then be able to make your own songs 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:08.169
 and your own solos 

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:12.839
 the part of the team that you do not see is 

00:05:10.499 --> 00:05:14.099
 quite simple because I think that 

00:05:12.839 --> 00:05:15.809
 really because of economic limitations 

00:05:14.099 --> 00:05:18.839
 we have always had a simple team 

00:05:15.809 --> 00:05:21.749
 and you end up getting used to it and as big 

00:05:18.839 --> 00:05:23.039
 pedals amps of many options yo 

00:05:21.749 --> 00:05:24.930
 I think it takes a little bit of pain out of 

00:05:23.039 --> 00:05:26.490
 head and in the end it 's a mess and it's a 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:28.650
 little stress because you spend more 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:30.569
 time setting up that touching the 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:32.069
 guitar, I also feel lazy 

00:05:30.569 --> 00:05:34.050
 end you get used to take out the sounds 

00:05:32.069 --> 00:05:36.839
 more for the way you play than for the 

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:38.490
 kind of career that yes I think if 

00:05:36.839 --> 00:05:40.559
 we had the budget would not delay 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:42.210
 have a lot of this reason but as 

00:05:40.559 --> 00:05:44.789
 we have not got used to if we play with 

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:46.830
 one use 15 watt line valves 

00:05:44.789 --> 00:05:48.960
 the damage should be limit a broad 

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:50.639
 quite economic and there is the majority 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:53.069
 of our sound we need 

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:54.539
 overdrive channel distortion that does not 

00:05:53.069 --> 00:05:56.249
 clean and a little bit of blacksmith who has the 

00:05:54.539 --> 00:05:58.750
 own and if we're going to poke at a 

00:05:56.249 --> 00:06:01.330
 little we sell you a v skyrim the pedal 

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:04.120
 this classic of everything from a little more 

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:06.070
 of chicha to quite tralla and then by 

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:09.550
 there we have here we have a live on 

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:13.240
 line 6 the classic one is l 4 and for 

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:15.820
 record bases to teach are the philis 

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:19.030
 we use in the box rc2 which is the 

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:20.560
 classic looper that treads this record and so 

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:22.920
 you no longer have a base to be able to 

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:22.920
 over 

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:28.900
 is an American stratocaster fender with 

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:31.360
 the electronics 

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:33.220
 is a brand that makes electric chops 

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:36.310
 but it also makes this kind of 

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:38.530
 electronic with your pills singles and 

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:41.740
 this is the make - up model try and 

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:44.950
 mail and that's why it has more special roll 

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:47.170
 that the potentiometers are like that more 

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:49.870
 retro with this a bit pearly and then 

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:51.280
 has the three pivots that are not for 

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:53.110
 other than to change pills 

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:55.720
 which allows you in many options 

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:57.310
 because they have as phase change in 

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:59.380
 normal position and inverted position 

00:06:57.310 --> 00:07:01.420
 but it's also a little more balls 

00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:04.330
 much easier to see a panic of 

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:06.130
 these that have three in position plan 

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:07.900
 on position off position 

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:10.420
 inverted but one has many more 

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:12.840
 sound actions too 

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:12.840
 how 

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:15.870
 Y
