00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:06.270
 video of me bastian the moon prince 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.410
 I am very pleased that we join today 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.420
 this video the sun in the face 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.860
 seems because we are on the sea ​​and indeed 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.259
 to be precise in scharbeutz 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.089
 I thought of my video today topic 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.640
 I just had to go to the sea that was 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.720
 just fits like a fist on the eye 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.800
 I came to the topic through mine 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.810
 sister she was in last year 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.340
 Florida and I asked her me 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.970
 but please very special scented candles 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.230
 bring 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.910
 because they do not in Germany 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.529
 There are bath &amp; body works out there 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.050
 Just not here and she brought me 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:34.230
 so small with and one of them was 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:37.020
 I have a lot of tiki beach in big now 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.760
 and I am super happy that that 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.550
 my happy hall is my current because 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.840
 with mia courses we have two of my 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.460
 favorite of bath body works 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.180
 brought to Germany that is how it is 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.500
 not here again so one is said 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:54.360
 very cool action and that we have her 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:55.949
 tiki tiki beach is a coconut fragrance so 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.500
 a fruity coconut that smells like 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.699
 such a cocktail with coconut is in it 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.530
 So it would be a bit fruity 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.660
 it should definitely be lively 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.939
 ticket beach takes the whole is a 3 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.610
 but the doctors that is the advantage 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.439
 here is just that the wax up to 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.060
 edge becomes much faster fluid 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.979
 and it burns much more evenly 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.890
 as part of a candle with only one 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:19.290
 single village is very nice looking forward 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.860
 with over that is one of the scent direction 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:26.100
 in my peppi hall and then we have 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:27.330
 have a coconut too 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.560
 he's a bit creamier and has it 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.850
 a bit like being there with me 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.140
 say it is so vanilla coconut and 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.610
 smells a bit more noble 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.040
 here is also country clubs world 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.570
 So it's exactly who coconuts are 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.490
 little nobler the whole does not want 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.979
 quite as tangy fruity takes on 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.390
 shape every case and that would be one 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.600
 a bit stronger trade more exotic 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:48.180
 because in the ticket these are my current 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.159

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.360
