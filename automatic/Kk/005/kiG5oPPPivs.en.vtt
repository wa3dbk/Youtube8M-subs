00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:58.000 
started this year are on a on a grill
mat<00:03:56.390> and<00:03:56.720> that's<00:03:57.020> that's<00:03:57.320> definitely<00:03:57.590> made<00:03:57.980> a

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.010 
mat and that's that's definitely made a

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:03.130 
mat and that's that's definitely made a
difference<00:03:58.390> heating<00:03:59.390> pad<00:03:59.630> and<00:04:01.870> boy<00:04:02.870> things

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:03.140 
difference heating pad and boy things

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
difference heating pad and boy things
just<00:04:03.380> just<00:04:03.890> jump<00:04:04.220> on<00:04:04.370> the<00:04:04.489> ground<00:04:04.730> with<00:04:04.880> that

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.160 
just just jump on the ground with that

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.440 
just just jump on the ground with that
so<00:04:07.160> the<00:04:07.280> onions<00:04:07.580> are<00:04:07.700> new<00:04:07.820> I've<00:04:08.090> never<00:04:08.270> grown

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:08.450 
so the onions are new I've never grown

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:10.150 
so the onions are new I've never grown
before<00:04:08.600> they<00:04:08.959> look<00:04:09.080> like<00:04:09.200> they've<00:04:09.380> done<00:04:09.620> okay

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:10.160 
before they look like they've done okay

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:14.110 
before they look like they've done okay
and<00:04:11.090> I<00:04:12.020> guess<00:04:12.350> you<00:04:12.470> can<00:04:12.590> just<00:04:12.910> when<00:04:13.910> they<00:04:13.970> get

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:14.120 
and I guess you can just when they get

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.520 
and I guess you can just when they get
long<00:04:14.360> I<00:04:14.540> guess<00:04:14.690> you<00:04:14.810> can<00:04:14.930> just<00:04:15.110> trim<00:04:15.350> them<00:04:15.500> back

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:15.530 
long I guess you can just trim them back

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:19.570 
long I guess you can just trim them back

this<00:06:08.070> year<00:06:08.250> is<00:06:08.370> to<00:06:08.520> get<00:06:08.610> to<00:06:08.850> get<00:06:09.150> a<00:06:09.180> larger<00:06:09.810> root

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:10.050 
this year is to get to get a larger root

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:12.950 
this year is to get to get a larger root
ball<00:06:10.669> so<00:06:11.669> they<00:06:11.970> can<00:06:12.150> once<00:06:12.510> I<00:06:12.600> get<00:06:12.750> them<00:06:12.870> in<00:06:12.930> the

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:12.960 
ball so they can once I get them in the

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:14.570 
ball so they can once I get them in the
ground<00:06:13.169> they<00:06:13.289> can<00:06:13.440> really<00:06:13.710> take<00:06:14.010> off<00:06:14.220> they<00:06:14.430> got

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:14.580 
ground they can really take off they got

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:16.940 
ground they can really take off they got
that<00:06:14.820> root<00:06:15.150> structure<00:06:15.660> with<00:06:15.840> a<00:06:15.870> really<00:06:16.680> really

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:16.950 
that root structure with a really really

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:21.290 
that root structure with a really really
go<00:06:17.130> and<00:06:17.780> get<00:06:18.780> an<00:06:18.870> earlier<00:06:19.169> crop<00:06:19.530> I<00:06:20.180> like<00:06:21.180> to

00:06:25.909 --> 00:06:25.919 
as long as i season as I can zone five

00:06:25.919 --> 00:06:28.490 
as long as i season as I can zone five
not<00:06:26.789> really<00:06:27.180> all<00:06:27.330> that<00:06:27.510> great<00:06:27.960> about<00:06:28.260> a

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:28.500 
not really all that great about a

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:32.510 
not really all that great about a
growing<00:06:29.100> season<00:06:29.460> up<00:06:29.580> here<00:06:29.960> so<00:06:30.960> I<00:06:31.440> cheat<00:06:32.070> every

way I can and this is I'm going to try

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:37.339 
way I can and this is I'm going to try
this<00:06:35.130> year<00:06:35.310> this<00:06:35.550> year<00:06:36.020> idea<00:06:37.020> comes<00:06:37.289> from

00:06:37.339 --> 00:06:37.349 
this year this year idea comes from

00:06:37.349 --> 00:06:41.810 
this year this year idea comes from
Eliot<00:06:37.830> Coleman<00:06:38.780> he's<00:06:39.780> up<00:06:39.930> in<00:06:40.020> Maine<00:06:40.520> and<00:06:41.520> a<00:06:41.700> lot

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:41.820 
Eliot Coleman he's up in Maine and a lot

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:42.559 
Eliot Coleman he's up in Maine and a lot
of<00:06:41.909> great<00:06:42.090> books

00:06:42.559 --> 00:06:42.569 
of great books

00:06:42.569 --> 00:06:45.709 
of great books
check<00:06:43.229> them<00:06:43.349> out<00:06:43.469> do<00:06:44.159> a<00:06:44.189> search<00:06:44.429> on<00:06:44.639> Google<00:06:44.719> and

00:06:45.709 --> 00:06:45.719 
check them out do a search on Google and

00:06:45.719 --> 00:06:47.929 
check them out do a search on Google and
that's<00:06:46.169> what<00:06:46.319> he<00:06:46.409> uses<00:06:46.649> he<00:06:46.919> recommends<00:06:47.399> a<00:06:47.550> four

00:06:47.929 --> 00:06:47.939 
that's what he uses he recommends a four

00:06:47.939 --> 00:06:49.579 
that's what he uses he recommends a four
inch<00:06:48.119> going<00:06:48.509> to<00:06:48.629> a<00:06:48.659> floor<00:06:48.869> and<00:06:48.990> she<00:06:49.110> used<00:06:49.289> soil

00:06:49.579 --> 00:06:49.589 
inch going to a floor and she used soil

00:06:49.589 --> 00:06:52.820 
inch going to a floor and she used soil
blocks<00:06:49.889> but<00:06:50.360> pot<00:06:51.360> will<00:06:51.599> be<00:06:52.259> nearly<00:06:52.469> the<00:06:52.619> same

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:52.830 
blocks but pot will be nearly the same

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:56.049 
blocks but pot will be nearly the same
thing<00:06:53.129> so<00:06:53.879> hopefully<00:06:54.869> that<00:06:55.020> works<00:06:55.199> well<00:06:55.499> I'm

00:06:56.049 --> 00:06:56.059 
thing so hopefully that works well I'm

00:06:56.059 --> 00:06:58.309 
thing so hopefully that works well I'm
just<00:06:57.059> by<00:06:57.270> the<00:06:57.330> looks<00:06:57.599> of<00:06:57.689> it<00:06:57.809> this<00:06:57.990> day<00:06:58.199> it's

00:06:58.309 --> 00:06:58.319 
just by the looks of it this day it's

00:06:58.319 --> 00:06:59.779 
just by the looks of it this day it's
doing<00:06:58.589> quite<00:06:58.619> well<00:06:58.860> I<00:06:59.039> think<00:06:59.219> it'll<00:06:59.520> blow<00:06:59.729> away

00:06:59.779 --> 00:06:59.789 
doing quite well I think it'll blow away

00:06:59.789 --> 00:07:03.139 
doing quite well I think it'll blow away
