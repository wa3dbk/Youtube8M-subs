gonna go in and try to get it more
thicker<00:00:42.990> at<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:43.290> bottom<00:00:43.410> but<00:00:43.920> but<00:00:44.310> you<00:00:44.400> can

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
thicker at the bottom but but you can

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.180 
thicker at the bottom but but you can
keep<00:00:44.700> up<00:00:45.030> at<00:00:45.240> the<00:00:45.330> top<00:00:45.660> area<00:00:46.320> right<00:00:46.950> in<00:00:47.070> this

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
keep up at the top area right in this

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.760 
keep up at the top area right in this
area<00:00:47.400> kind<00:00:48.270> of<00:00:48.420> gentle<00:00:49.110> you<00:00:49.380> don't<00:00:49.560> want<00:00:49.710> to

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
area kind of gentle you don't want to

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.410 
area kind of gentle you don't want to
have<00:00:49.890> to<00:00:50.160> think<00:00:50.190> of<00:00:50.700> a<00:00:50.790> line<00:00:51.000> there<00:00:51.240> so

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
have to think of a line there so

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.050 
have to think of a line there so
basically<00:00:52.320> you<00:00:52.800> want<00:00:53.010> to<00:00:53.040> take<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.760> first

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:54.060 
basically you want to take the the first

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:56.030 
basically you want to take the the first
coat<00:00:54.480> go<00:00:54.780> here<00:00:55.170> and<00:00:55.290> then<00:00:55.410> the<00:00:55.500> second<00:00:55.890> coat

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:56.040 
coat go here and then the second coat

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.850 
coat go here and then the second coat
would<00:00:56.190> go<00:00:56.370> kind<00:00:56.820> of<00:00:56.940> like<00:00:57.090> right<00:00:57.360> under<00:00:57.780> it<00:00:57.930> so

00:00:58.850 --> 00:00:58.860 
would go kind of like right under it so

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:01.940 
would go kind of like right under it so
that<00:00:59.070> you<00:00:59.190> don't<00:00:59.340> have<00:00:59.520> a<00:00:59.579> real<00:00:59.850> thick<00:01:00.239> and<00:01:00.950> see

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:01.950 
that you don't have a real thick and see

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:03.189 
that you don't have a real thick and see
like<00:01:02.399> that

00:01:03.189 --> 00:01:03.199 
like that

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
I'm gonna finish okay now with a gray

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.580 
I'm gonna finish okay now with a gray
and<00:01:09.150> gold<00:01:09.950> I'm<00:01:10.950> taking<00:01:11.840> I'm<00:01:12.840> taking<00:01:12.900> a<00:01:13.380> line

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
and gold I'm taking I'm taking a line

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.280 
and gold I'm taking I'm taking a line
and<00:01:13.950> I've<00:01:14.580> painted<00:01:15.120> across<00:01:15.750> the<00:01:15.990> nail<00:01:16.140> like

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
and I've painted across the nail like

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.890 
and I've painted across the nail like
this<00:01:16.560> and<00:01:16.950> then<00:01:17.700> I'm<00:01:17.909> going<00:01:18.090> to<00:01:18.240> go<00:01:18.510> through

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
this and then I'm going to go through

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.500 
this and then I'm going to go through
with<00:01:19.440> my<00:01:19.500> striking<00:01:20.010> brush<00:01:20.220> and<00:01:21.000> just<00:01:21.210> kind<00:01:21.420> of

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:21.510 
with my striking brush and just kind of

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:26.270 
with my striking brush and just kind of
go<00:01:22.140> I'm<00:01:22.409> just<00:01:23.060> edging<00:01:24.060> in<00:01:25.040> all<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.159> way

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
go I'm just edging in all the way

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.390 
go I'm just edging in all the way
through<00:01:26.659> so<00:01:27.659> it's<00:01:27.780> just<00:01:28.020> kind<00:01:28.890> of<00:01:28.950> sweeping

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
through so it's just kind of sweeping

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.760 
through so it's just kind of sweeping
across<00:01:30.290> okay<00:01:31.580> and<00:01:32.580> I'll<00:01:32.700> do<00:01:32.850> one<00:01:33.060> more<00:01:33.710> let<00:01:34.710> me

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
across okay and I'll do one more let me

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.890 
across okay and I'll do one more let me
see<00:01:34.920> that<00:01:34.950> other<00:01:35.190> new<00:01:35.390> got<00:01:36.390> to<00:01:36.510> keep<00:01:36.630> them<00:01:36.810> the

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
see that other new got to keep them the

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.100 
see that other new got to keep them the
same<00:01:37.369> I'm<00:01:38.369> a<00:01:38.400> perfectionist<00:01:38.820> so<00:01:39.510> here<00:01:39.900> we<00:01:39.990> go

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
same I'm a perfectionist so here we go

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:46.399 
same I'm a perfectionist so here we go
like<00:01:40.320> that<00:01:41.299> around<00:01:42.299> and<00:01:42.659> see<00:01:42.900> how<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:45.409> the

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
like that around and see how the the

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.219 
like that around and see how the the
branches<00:01:47.220> are<00:01:47.939> going<00:01:48.180> kind<00:01:48.600> of<00:01:48.750> through<00:01:49.080> the

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
branches are going kind of through the

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.200 
branches are going kind of through the
line<00:01:49.470> so<00:01:50.070> that's<00:01:50.280> why<00:01:50.400> you<00:01:50.460> don't<00:01:50.670> need<00:01:50.850> a

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
line so that's why you don't need a

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.410 
line so that's why you don't need a
bunch<00:01:51.720> of<00:01:52.369> neat<00:01:53.369> green<00:01:53.700> to<00:01:53.939> like<00:01:54.119> the<00:01:54.299> odd

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
bunch of neat green to like the odd

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:55.969 
bunch of neat green to like the odd
bubbled<00:01:54.840> up<00:01:54.900> right<00:01:55.170> here<00:01:55.380> you<00:01:55.560> kind<00:01:55.710> of<00:01:55.830> just

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
bubbled up right here you kind of just

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.969 
bubbled up right here you kind of just
want<00:01:56.040> it<00:01:56.280> to<00:01:56.340> be<00:01:57.020> layered<00:01:58.020> so<00:01:58.500> that<00:01:58.650> I<00:01:58.710> can<00:01:58.860> go

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
want it to be layered so that I can go

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.960 
want it to be layered so that I can go
right<00:01:59.189> over<00:01:59.220> the<00:01:59.490> top<00:01:59.700> with<00:01:59.909> the<00:02:00.090> branches

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:01.970 
right over the top with the branches

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.460 
right over the top with the branches
okay<00:02:02.970> now<00:02:03.420> I'm<00:02:03.869> going<00:02:04.020> to<00:02:04.110> show<00:02:04.229> you<00:02:04.290> my
