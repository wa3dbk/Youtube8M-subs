00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:09.360
 we have a review of my run star wars each 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:12.269
 captain rex in the second phase of armor and so 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:16.080
 We look as a background for today 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:20.070
 captain rex as such is strange and so 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:23.150
 my captain rex here are 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.150
 flowed on the helmet 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:30.529
 Kiev decals on the body in my arms 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.289
 did decal 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:36.680
 such a skirt which I also made from 

00:00:34.289 --> 00:00:39.449
 then the skirt that was in the set 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:44.719
 fighter engine primacy this 

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:49.859
 we set 75 and 018 have such wildly Do 

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:52.289
 something branch sunny with us so then 

00:00:49.859 --> 00:00:56.390
 such a blue striped skirt is like 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:01:00.120
 there must be such prints on the horns and 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:02.670
 face what could and also vizar 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.339

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:11.100
 this one I did in using 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:13.409
 costama who did the last time so well 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.100
 Now we will look at how they should 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:19.650
 to look like 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:22.409
 its comparison and custom and trace how 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:27.630

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:37.890
 hands are on 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:41.860
 weather is probably poorly visible there and 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.990
 drawing of course for someone like a helmet 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:48.840

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:48.840

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:56.590
 so my rest is not gloster and here they are 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:58.380
 already more close to normal so 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:02.860

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:04.990

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:19.900
