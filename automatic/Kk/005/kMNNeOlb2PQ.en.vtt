00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:49.340 
to locate the pulse now this is not

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:51.549 
to locate the pulse now this is not
necessarily<00:00:49.520> the<00:00:50.090> easiest<00:00:50.239> place<00:00:51.079> especially

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:51.559 
necessarily the easiest place especially

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:54.790 
necessarily the easiest place especially
on<00:00:52.039> a<00:00:52.070> larger<00:00:52.670> or<00:00:52.879> even<00:00:53.269> obese<00:00:53.600> animal<00:00:54.140> so
