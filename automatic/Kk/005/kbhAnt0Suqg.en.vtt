00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.039 
and then just kind of work it around or
what<00:01:07.140> I<00:01:07.170> do<00:01:07.409> actually<00:01:08.280> when<00:01:08.729> i<00:01:08.760> use<00:01:09.299> i<00:01:09.630> have<00:01:10.020> a

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
what I do actually when i use i have a

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.250 
what I do actually when i use i have a
separate<00:01:10.470> one<00:01:10.619> but<00:01:11.280> i<00:01:11.580> use<00:01:12.270> this<00:01:12.450> also<00:01:12.720> for<00:01:13.140> my

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
separate one but i use this also for my

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.770 
separate one but i use this also for my
client<00:01:13.770> because<00:01:14.010> it's<00:01:14.549> a<00:01:14.760> lot<00:01:15.060> more<00:01:15.090> sanitary

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
client because it's a lot more sanitary

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.060 
client because it's a lot more sanitary
than<00:01:16.909> anything<00:01:17.909> creamy<00:01:18.299> or<00:01:18.689> gel<00:01:19.110> or<00:01:19.439> actual

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
than anything creamy or gel or actual

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.140 
than anything creamy or gel or actual
liquid<00:01:20.340> liner<00:01:20.790> because<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.990> powder<00:01:22.619> or<00:01:23.189> this

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
liquid liner because the powder or this

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.830 
liquid liner because the powder or this
will<00:01:24.420> always<00:01:24.720> dry<00:01:25.759> completely<00:01:26.759> dry<00:01:27.450> so<00:01:27.810> it

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
will always dry completely dry so it

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.800 
will always dry completely dry so it
doesn't<00:01:28.320> retain<00:01:28.890> like<00:01:29.490> hardcore<00:01:30.000> bacteria

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
doesn't retain like hardcore bacteria

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.319 
doesn't retain like hardcore bacteria
like<00:01:31.140> a<00:01:31.350> gel<00:01:31.680> would<00:01:31.950> so<00:01:32.340> sometimes<00:01:32.790> I<00:01:32.939> put<00:01:33.180> the

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
like a gel would so sometimes I put the

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.749 
like a gel would so sometimes I put the
water<00:01:33.509> on<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:34.110> mirror<00:01:34.530> and<00:01:34.770> then<00:01:35.130> just<00:01:35.400> keep

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
back and forth sofurry now because I

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.920 
back and forth sofurry now because I
don't<00:01:38.400> have<00:01:38.549> my<00:01:38.759> little<00:01:38.939> cupping<00:01:39.329> water<00:01:39.570> I'm

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:12.910 
thick because then it won't glide across
like<00:02:11.030> you<00:02:11.180> want<00:02:11.420> it<00:02:11.569> to<00:02:11.780> go<00:02:12.230> just<00:02:12.470> takes<00:02:12.739> a

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
like you want it to go just takes a

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.150 
like you want it to go just takes a
little<00:02:13.129> getting<00:02:13.250> used<00:02:13.849> to<00:02:14.030> I'm<00:02:14.450> using<00:02:14.870> a<00:02:15.410> small

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
little getting used to I'm using a small

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.390 
little getting used to I'm using a small
mirror<00:02:16.910> just<00:02:17.269> in<00:02:17.420> my<00:02:17.569> hand<00:02:17.870> and<00:02:18.110> it<00:02:18.769> helps<00:02:19.129> to

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
mirror just in my hand and it helps to

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.330 
mirror just in my hand and it helps to
look<00:02:19.610> down<00:02:20.000> for<00:02:20.390> me<00:02:20.450> I<00:02:20.629> find<00:02:21.050> it<00:02:21.319> helps<00:02:21.830> to<00:02:22.129> look

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
look down for me I find it helps to look

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.009 
look down for me I find it helps to look
down<00:02:22.670> so<00:02:23.060> you<00:02:23.150> don't<00:02:23.330> have<00:02:23.420> to<00:02:23.569> like<00:02:23.720> go<00:02:23.989> like

more study it helps to rest your arm on
something<00:02:30.860> more<00:02:31.069> even<00:02:31.430> your<00:02:31.549> elbow<00:02:32.000> so<00:02:32.420> I'm

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
something more even your elbow so I'm

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.539 
something more even your elbow so I'm
looking<00:02:32.660> down<00:02:33.019> into<00:02:33.049> my<00:02:33.410> mare<00:02:33.680> and<00:02:33.950> then<00:02:34.190> as

00:02:34.539 --> 00:02:34.549 
looking down into my mare and then as

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:38.650 
looking down into my mare and then as
close<00:02:35.330> as<00:02:35.810> possible<00:02:35.870> to<00:02:36.799> my<00:02:37.069> lashline<00:02:37.660> it

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
close as possible to my lashline it

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.150 
close as possible to my lashline it
doesn't<00:02:38.989> matter<00:02:39.079> you<00:02:39.470> don't<00:02:39.650> have<00:02:39.769> to<00:02:39.890> start

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
doesn't matter you don't have to start

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.030 
doesn't matter you don't have to start
in<00:02:40.280> the<00:02:40.370> front<00:02:40.549> or<00:02:41.060> the<00:02:41.090> end<00:02:41.930> or<00:02:42.319> whatever<00:02:42.709> I

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
in the front or the end or whatever I

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.350 
in the front or the end or whatever I
just<00:02:43.130> kind<00:02:43.579> of<00:02:43.670> wipe<00:02:44.090> it<00:02:44.360> across<00:02:46.150> until<00:02:47.150> it's

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
just kind of wipe it across until it's

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:59.990 
just kind of wipe it across until it's
where<00:02:47.900> and<00:02:48.230> how<00:02:48.410> I<00:02:48.440> want<00:02:48.950> it

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.590 

and<00:03:00.090> also<00:03:00.870> like<00:03:01.590> let's<00:03:01.950> say<00:03:02.070> I<00:03:02.160> do<00:03:02.790> mess<00:03:03.210> up<00:03:03.390> at

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
and also like let's say I do mess up at

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.900 
and also like let's say I do mess up at
times<00:03:03.900> like<00:03:04.200> sometimes<00:03:04.710> I'll<00:03:04.890> make<00:03:05.100> it<00:03:05.250> to<00:03:05.550> six

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
times like sometimes I'll make it to six

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.980 
times like sometimes I'll make it to six
or<00:03:07.280> it'll<00:03:08.280> all<00:03:08.550> get<00:03:08.730> a<00:03:08.790> little<00:03:08.850> bump<00:03:09.330> in<00:03:09.480> it<00:03:09.630> the

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:09.990 
or it'll all get a little bump in it the

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:12.080 
or it'll all get a little bump in it the
best<00:03:10.260> thing<00:03:10.500> that<00:03:10.650> I<00:03:10.680> can<00:03:10.830> do<00:03:11.190> to<00:03:11.370> fix<00:03:11.610> it<00:03:11.820> is<00:03:12.060> to

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
best thing that I can do to fix it is to

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.230 
best thing that I can do to fix it is to
just<00:03:12.510> immediately<00:03:13.170> put<00:03:13.830> eyeshadow<00:03:14.040> on<00:03:14.730> over

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:15.240 
just immediately put eyeshadow on over

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.120 
just immediately put eyeshadow on over
it<00:03:15.330> to<00:03:15.480> help<00:03:15.690> him<00:03:15.900> feel<00:03:16.170> it<00:03:16.350> a<00:03:16.380> bit<00:03:16.470> more<00:03:16.860> and

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
it to help him feel it a bit more and

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:20.449 
it to help him feel it a bit more and
then<00:03:17.690> continue<00:03:18.690> back<00:03:18.900> on<00:03:19.140> with<00:03:19.530> your<00:03:19.890> liquid

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
then continue back on with your liquid

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:23.510 
then continue back on with your liquid
liner<00:03:20.730> or<00:03:21.120> cake<00:03:21.450> liner<00:03:21.750> for<00:03:22.200> the<00:03:22.260> wing<00:03:22.650> actions

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:23.520 
liner or cake liner for the wing actions

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:26.480 
liner or cake liner for the wing actions
that<00:03:24.030> I<00:03:24.060> usually<00:03:24.510> do<00:03:24.720> I'll<00:03:25.110> start<00:03:25.650> from<00:03:26.100> the

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:26.490 
that I usually do I'll start from the

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:28.670 
that I usually do I'll start from the
bottom<00:03:26.700> here<00:03:27.270> almost<00:03:27.510> at<00:03:27.870> the<00:03:28.020> lower<00:03:28.260> lash

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
bottom here almost at the lower lash

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:33.229 
bottom here almost at the lower lash
line<00:03:30.500> and<00:03:31.500> make<00:03:32.040> one<00:03:32.310> little<00:03:32.520> line<00:03:32.880> like<00:03:33.209> that

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
line and make one little line like that

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:37.490 
line and make one little line like that
and<00:03:33.780> then<00:03:34.140> kind<00:03:34.410> of<00:03:34.560> halfway<00:03:34.920> up<00:03:35.640> the<00:03:36.500> little

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
and then kind of halfway up the little

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:43.699 
and then kind of halfway up the little
mark<00:03:37.950> I<00:03:41.480> just<00:03:42.480> draw<00:03:42.690> another<00:03:42.959> one<00:03:43.230> and<00:03:43.380> connect

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
mark I just draw another one and connect

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:52.820 
mark I just draw another one and connect
it<00:03:43.860> and<00:03:45.500> then<00:03:46.500> just<00:03:46.739> fill<00:03:46.980> it<00:03:47.190> in<00:03:51.440> when<00:03:52.440> I<00:03:52.530> step

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:52.830 
it and then just fill it in when I step

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:55.400 
it and then just fill it in when I step
and<00:03:53.070> of<00:03:53.760> course<00:03:54.060> you<00:03:54.270> want<00:03:54.450> to<00:03:54.540> try<00:03:54.810> to<00:03:54.870> make<00:03:55.380> it

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
and of course you want to try to make it

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:59.890 
and of course you want to try to make it
as<00:03:56.150> even<00:03:57.150> as<00:03:57.420> possible<00:03:58.320> with<00:03:59.040> the<00:03:59.070> other<00:03:59.400> eye

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
as even as possible with the other eye

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.960 
as even as possible with the other eye
so<00:04:00.900> and<00:04:01.230> again<00:04:01.350> also<00:04:02.070> since<00:04:02.430> this<00:04:02.700> is

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
so and again also since this is

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:06.020 
so and again also since this is
activated<00:04:03.870> with<00:04:04.019> water<00:04:04.290> it's<00:04:05.010> going<00:04:05.160> to<00:04:05.790> be

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
activated with water it's going to be

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:08.509 
activated with water it's going to be
wet<00:04:06.299> on<00:04:06.570> your<00:04:07.110> lips<00:04:07.410> so<00:04:07.799> give<00:04:08.160> it<00:04:08.190> a<00:04:08.370> little

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:08.519 
wet on your lips so give it a little

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:11.240 
wet on your lips so give it a little
time<00:04:08.760> to<00:04:08.820> dry<00:04:09.180> it<00:04:09.239> before<00:04:09.690> you<00:04:10.650> start<00:04:10.950> curling

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
time to dry it before you start curling

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:15.009 
time to dry it before you start curling
your<00:04:11.430> lashes<00:04:12.260> and<00:04:13.260> that's<00:04:14.250> pretty<00:04:14.580> much<00:04:14.730> it

00:04:15.009 --> 00:04:15.019 
your lashes and that's pretty much it

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:19.969 
your lashes and that's pretty much it
that's<00:04:16.019> how<00:04:16.470> I<00:04:16.530> do<00:04:16.799> it<00:04:17.040> and<00:04:17.870> again<00:04:18.870> it's<00:04:19.560> just<00:04:19.799> a

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:19.979 
that's how I do it and again it's just a

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:23.180 
that's how I do it and again it's just a
matter<00:04:20.280> of<00:04:20.430> practice<00:04:21.090> there's<00:04:21.750> no<00:04:22.130> there's<00:04:23.130> no

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
matter of practice there's no there's no

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.460 
matter of practice there's no there's no
right<00:04:23.550> or<00:04:23.580> wrong<00:04:23.940> way<00:04:24.180> to<00:04:24.210> put<00:04:24.630> it<00:04:24.660> on<00:04:24.870> as<00:04:25.260> long

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
right or wrong way to put it on as long

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:28.460 
right or wrong way to put it on as long
as<00:04:25.500> it<00:04:25.800> looks<00:04:25.979> as<00:04:26.340> even<00:04:27.150> and<00:04:27.479> balanced<00:04:27.960> as<00:04:28.260> you

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:28.470 
as it looks as even and balanced as you

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:30.350 
as it looks as even and balanced as you
could<00:04:28.710> possibly<00:04:28.950> get<00:04:29.610> it<00:04:29.790> that's<00:04:30.060> all<00:04:30.180> that

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360 
could possibly get it that's all that
