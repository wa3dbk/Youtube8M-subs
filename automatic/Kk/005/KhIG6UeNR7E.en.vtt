00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
i do an ok job of this what I'm meaning

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.330 
i do an ok job of this what I'm meaning
is<00:00:17.670> whether<00:00:17.940> you're<00:00:18.210> self-employed<00:00:18.690> or<00:00:19.340> just

is whether you're self-employed or just

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.670 
is whether you're self-employed or just
how<00:00:20.550> you<00:00:20.609> let<00:00:21.000> other<00:00:21.180> people<00:00:21.570> treat<00:00:21.810> you<00:00:21.990> too

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
how you let other people treat you too

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.650 
how you let other people treat you too
often<00:00:22.920> we<00:00:23.160> let<00:00:23.460> other<00:00:23.670> people<00:00:24.060> determine<00:00:24.539> our

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
often we let other people determine our

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.060 
often we let other people determine our
value<00:00:25.140> and<00:00:25.670> don't<00:00:26.670> set<00:00:27.390> the<00:00:27.720> expectation<00:00:28.710> that

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
value and don't set the expectation that

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.060 
value and don't set the expectation that
our<00:00:29.250> value<00:00:29.609> be<00:00:29.820> as<00:00:30.029> high<00:00:30.300> as<00:00:30.330> it<00:00:30.660> should<00:00:31.019> be<00:00:31.230> so

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
our value be as high as it should be so

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.740 
our value be as high as it should be so
the<00:00:32.219> best<00:00:32.430> example<00:00:32.910> that<00:00:32.940> I<00:00:33.059> can<00:00:33.239> give<00:00:33.390> of<00:00:33.570> that

the best example that I can give of that

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.410

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
think we all really need to value

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.109 
think we all really need to value
ourselves<00:01:45.810> first<00:01:46.470> and<00:01:46.799> set<00:01:47.340> that<00:01:47.549> expectation

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
ourselves first and set that expectation

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.130 
ourselves first and set that expectation
very<00:01:48.869> high<00:01:49.170> and<00:01:49.560> very<00:01:49.619> clearly<00:01:50.340> in<00:01:50.759> how<00:01:51.329> we

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
very high and very clearly in how we

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.800 
very high and very clearly in how we
have<00:01:52.710> other<00:01:52.890> people<00:01:53.250> treat<00:01:53.549> us<00:01:53.579> and<00:01:54.000> what<00:01:54.780> we

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
have other people treat us and what we

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.190
