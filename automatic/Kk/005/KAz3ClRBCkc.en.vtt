00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:06.005
 Legend tells of legendary knowledge manager 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.723
 His knowledge management was really legendary 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.962
 He wandered from city to city to seek more hidden knowledge 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:30.180
 I see you love knowledge. How about getting more from my fist! 

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:34.567
 The manager was silent because his mouth was full 

00:00:34.567 --> 00:00:37.716
 Then he swallowed and said 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.218
 enough. Come find out more ... 

00:00:40.218 --> 00:00:41.593
 Unseen knowledge! 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.831
 He was so deadly, 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.537
 Whose enemies were blinded by his pure, hidden knowledge 

00:00:50.537 --> 00:00:52.630
 - my eyes ! - So pure! 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.397
 - So handsome! - How do you do that? 

00:00:55.397 --> 00:00:57.760
 You should learn knowledge management. 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.800
 It really helps. Oooh. 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.062
 Google ! 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.130
 No matter how attacked, 

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:07.977
 He was above them all. 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.824
 There was never a panda he ran so well knew! And they loved him so much! 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.456
 Even China's top managers, 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.030
 The five sages, 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.975
 They bowed respectfully before the great manager. 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.600
 ? What's App 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:37.360
 Twitter. 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.481
 But to connect to the Internet, 

00:01:42.481 --> 00:01:46.917
 We had to go through all the haters and the many enemies of management, 

00:01:46.917 --> 00:01:49.678
 And there's only one thing that's important to know, and that's ... 

00:01:50.158 --> 00:01:51.672
 Fu! Wake up! 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.443
 Go to school! 

00:01:53.443 --> 00:01:54.702
 what? 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.864
 Fu! Wake up! 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.658
 Fu! you're late! You want after? 

00:02:22.658 --> 00:02:23.902
 OK! 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.091
 I am! wants to! Learn! Management! knowledge! is very! 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.785
 Fu! Faster! Go to school! 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.165
 I'm coming! 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:53.526
 Sorry, Dad. 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.433
 Come help me. 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.846
 What are you lying there? What's going on? 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.371
 is nothing. I had a dream. 

00:03:01.371 --> 00:03:02.588
 What? 

00:03:02.588 --> 00:03:04.152
 What did you dream about? 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:05.684
 What's happening? ... 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.231
 I dreamed of ... 

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:12.009
 Knowledge Management... 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.674
 Knowledge Management? Did you really dream about knowledge management? 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.280
 Yes. What else can you dream about? 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.708
 Caution! This soup is hot. 

00:03:20.708 --> 00:03:23.588
 or! What a beauty! 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:27.502
 My son, dreaming of knowledge management! 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.713
 You do not know how much I waited for that day. 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.560
 That's important, Po. 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.320
 why is it important? 

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:40.880
 Soon you will be able to save, share, and update any knowledge 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.120
 Even hidden knowledge. 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:48.227
 Then you can fulfill your destiny and become a great knowledge manager! 

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:51.721
 As I have become after my father, and my father will be after his father ... 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.400
 ... who stole his friend's knowledge. 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.040
 Dad, Dad, Dad, it's just a dream. - laughter - 

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:59.818
 No, that's the dream. 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.401
 We are knowledge managers. The management flows in our blood. 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:07.280
 But Dad, how do I, I do not know, learn it? 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.083
 Where will I get the knowledge to manage? 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.055
 The truth is, you have to go to a course. 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:16.080
 This is called a knowledge management course. It is very important. 

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:17.200
 It is difficult? 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:18.957
 I managed to get through. 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:24.476
 And you should start with it! - laughter - 

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:26.160
 it's fun! 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.520
 Come on. Everyone has his place. 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.080
 Mine here, and yours ... 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:33.308
 I know, in class. 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:36.612
 Right, here's some more food 

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:38.880
 And go with the smile!
