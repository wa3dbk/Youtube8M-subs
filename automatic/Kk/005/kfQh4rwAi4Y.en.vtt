kind<00:03:22.200> of<00:03:22.260> coated<00:03:22.590> and<00:03:22.799> it<00:03:23.400> covered<00:03:23.760> the<00:03:23.940> gray

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
kind of coated and it covered the gray

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
it really didn't cover and I made a

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.780 
it really didn't cover and I made a
tremendous<00:03:42.840> effort<00:03:43.380> where<00:03:44.099> my<00:03:44.250> part<00:03:44.549> was<00:03:44.730> to

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
tremendous effort where my part was to

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.059 
tremendous effort where my part was to
make<00:03:45.690> sure<00:03:45.720> that<00:03:46.049> I<00:03:46.079> covered<00:03:46.650> that<00:03:46.829> well

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:47.069 
make sure that I covered that well

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:48.650 
make sure that I covered that well
because<00:03:47.549> I<00:03:47.639> wanted<00:03:47.910> to<00:03:48.060> see<00:03:48.269> whether<00:03:48.450> it

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
because I wanted to see whether it

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.690 
because I wanted to see whether it
worked<00:03:48.870> I<00:03:49.139> think<00:03:49.739> this<00:03:49.919> is<00:03:50.010> a<00:03:50.040> great<00:03:50.340> product

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700
