the only bad thing that I don't like
about<00:00:43.590> these<00:00:43.920> is<00:00:43.980> they're<00:00:44.520> not<00:00:44.760> hostile<00:00:45.300> which

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
about these is they're not hostile which

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.510 
about these is they're not hostile which
is<00:00:45.960> also<00:00:46.140> a<00:00:46.320> good<00:00:46.530> thing<00:00:46.739> too<00:00:46.950> if<00:00:47.160> your<00:00:47.340> lower

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
is also a good thing too if your lower

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.010 
is also a good thing too if your lower
level<00:00:47.879> because<00:00:48.030> you<00:00:48.120> can<00:00:48.270> kill<00:00:48.450> one<00:00:48.600> at<00:00:48.690> a<00:00:48.750> time

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
level because you can kill one at a time

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.560 
level because you can kill one at a time
or<00:00:49.340> if<00:00:50.340> you're<00:00:50.730> a<00:00:50.760> higher<00:00:50.910> level<00:00:51.210> you<00:00:51.270> can<00:00:51.420> just

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
or if you're a higher level you can just

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.920 
or if you're a higher level you can just
a<00:00:51.690> 0<00:00:51.719> e<00:00:51.809> and<00:00:52.050> kill<00:00:52.199> them<00:00:52.350> all<00:00:52.440> at<00:00:52.530> once<00:00:53.090> so<00:00:54.090> it's

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
a 0 e and kill them all at once so it's
