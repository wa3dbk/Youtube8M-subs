length<00:00:37.770> design<00:00:38.100> so<00:00:38.430> we<00:00:39.210> didn't<00:00:39.420> invent<00:00:39.660> the

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
length design so we didn't invent the

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.840 
length design so we didn't invent the
Watts<00:00:39.989> link<00:00:40.260> concept<00:00:40.770> but<00:00:41.070> we've<00:00:41.250> adapted<00:00:41.520> it

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
Watts link concept but we've adapted it

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.460 
Watts link concept but we've adapted it
to<00:00:41.970> an<00:00:42.059> off-road<00:00:42.450> application<00:00:43.140> and<00:00:43.290> in<00:00:43.379> this

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:43.470 
to an off-road application and in this

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:48.500 
to an off-road application and in this
particular<00:00:43.650> case<00:00:44.150> Jeep<00:00:45.150> JK<00:00:45.680> which<00:00:47.390> well<00:00:48.390> it's

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
particular case Jeep JK which well it's

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.450 
particular case Jeep JK which well it's
a<00:00:48.570> nice<00:00:48.750> driving<00:00:49.350> vehicle<00:00:49.739> to<00:00:49.800> begin<00:00:50.070> with<00:00:50.280> as

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
a nice driving vehicle to begin with as

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.060 
a nice driving vehicle to begin with as
you<00:00:50.760> begin<00:00:51.090> to<00:00:51.390> lift<00:00:51.690> it<00:00:51.930> and<00:00:52.199> different

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
you begin to lift it and different

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.210 
you begin to lift it and different
stresses<00:00:53.520> on<00:00:53.940> track<00:00:54.780> bar<00:00:55.050> brackets<00:00:55.530> and<00:00:55.739> so<00:00:56.010> on

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:56.220 
stresses on track bar brackets and so on

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:58.550 
stresses on track bar brackets and so on
you<00:00:56.520> have<00:00:56.670> problems<00:00:57.149> with<00:00:57.210> durability<00:00:57.690> this

00:00:58.550 --> 00:00:58.560 
you have problems with durability this

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.770 
you have problems with durability this
eliminates<00:00:59.100> all<00:00:59.310> those<00:00:59.460> issues<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:00.300> it<00:01:00.630> makes

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
eliminates all those issues and it makes

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.310 
eliminates all those issues and it makes
a<00:01:00.890> significant<00:01:01.890> improvement<00:01:02.670> in<00:01:02.850> terms<00:01:03.540> of<00:01:03.899> on

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
a significant improvement in terms of on

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.130 
a significant improvement in terms of on
Center<00:01:05.160> Drive<00:01:05.790> field<00:01:06.180> something<00:01:06.899> that

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
Center Drive field something that

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.870 
Center Drive field something that
creates<00:01:07.410> a<00:01:07.500> constant<00:01:07.890> role<00:01:08.130> Center<00:01:08.340> geometry

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
creates a constant role Center geometry

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.120 
creates a constant role Center geometry
so<00:01:09.060> if<00:01:09.300> totally<00:01:09.690> eliminates<00:01:10.110> any<00:01:10.410> rear

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
so if totally eliminates any rear

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.660 
so if totally eliminates any rear
