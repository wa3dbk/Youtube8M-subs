00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:32.080
 here and Spain lost was surprised by 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:37.390
 Slovakia already has a great impact on the 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:41.920
 country that was the champion of the 2010 cup 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:43.899
 brazil and south africa 2010 from the hand of 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.840
 vicente del bosque and with many others 

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:50.020
 figures now yes there is a replacement 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:52.360
 Spanish team but fell against 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:54.960
 Slovakia was surprised that he arrived 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:01:00.449
 many times he could not specify 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:03.059
 the one that takes the red the first as much of the 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.970
 party but it is divided looks for the 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.700
 player of the genre álex word and genoa el 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:12.240
 Brand midfielder who releases 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:14.509
 also has pretty good punch but 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.580
 surprised because it was a free throw 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:19.440
 weak I would say where it was located 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.970
 squares clearly for good but 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.280
 because the historic archer the real 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:27.330
 madrid that is also pointing 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:30.200
 in some digital newspapers the goalkeeper 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:35.550
 the captain to the capi as they say 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:38.759
 the goal is passed to the ball on the side 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:42.539
 iker's right and it did not have a good 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:45.220
 response to the 82 marked step to cancer 

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:49.420
 the tie entering 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:52.630
 of 9 for with the right with the left 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.350
 stick left of thing click and at 87 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:55.960
 it's touch 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:59.760
 this player who was the technician's son 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:02.590
 in the mold to God's ica 2010 marks the 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.880
 goal that gives victory after here 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.540
 the first time in history that you 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:09.910
 wins to Spain in five games that 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:12.760
 crossed thus creating at least 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:16.340
 Local he clarified if I had heard good 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:19.760
 much more the ball fails where it could 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:22.610
 to make the goal and make more goals a 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:25.550
 good performance of the archer of the 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:28.340
 several things that covered 25 balls very 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:30.769
 interesting and some errors in the 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.510
 definition still can not put it in diego 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:34.790
 Costa still has no luck and no 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.590
 ask him to search well at least with 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:39.260
 the Spanish team in the premier 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:42.910
 league is the scorer is a crack that is 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:46.590
 9 and they want everyone after but 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:49.140
 its great jump 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:51.390
 the great critic father 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.640
 but here in Spain it costs a lot to get you 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.140
 make a precise pass that puts paco 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.650
 Alcacer that had entered thus 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:01.470
 He had left the coast moments later 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:03.630
 that had left age and silva today was 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:06.990
 holder raúl albiol course sense 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:08.810
 so that grows pedro was like holder 

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:13.320
 contract pierre entered santi cazorla 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:16.290
 tried to change the variants a little and 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:19.530
 make it much more offensive to the team 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:21.569
 and slovakia 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:23.790
 all tucked back and with the most games 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:27.359
 known as for example scaling 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:29.519
 hamsik ikuska I try to keep the 

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:32.790
 result of the and they came out of pure 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:34.349
 chance we could say so saying 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.239
 this with ceilings and down on the part 

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:38.310
 description you have the imported oak 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:39.840
