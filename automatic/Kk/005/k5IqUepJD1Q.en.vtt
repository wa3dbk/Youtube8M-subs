years and years and one of the things I
love<00:00:55.140> about<00:00:55.170> them<00:00:55.590> is<00:00:55.740> they're<00:00:56.040> a<00:00:56.070> harder<00:00:56.640> lid

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.120 
so when you want to do details like the

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:04.410 
get that done because the pencil will

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:06.950 
get that done because the pencil will
stay<00:01:04.710> sharp<00:01:05.130> since<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.640> harder<00:01:05.940> led<00:01:06.180> it<00:01:06.720> won't

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
stay sharp since the harder led it won't

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
let me show you another really cool

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.830 
let me show you another really cool
technique<00:02:08.729> for<00:02:08.940> using<00:02:09.269> the<00:02:09.360> water-soluble

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
technique for using the water-soluble

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:17.340 
technique for using the water-soluble
pencil

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:20.730 

I<00:02:18.240> love<00:02:19.240> to<00:02:19.420> work<00:02:19.600> with<00:02:19.630> graphite<00:02:20.290> pencils

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:20.740 
I love to work with graphite pencils

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:22.650 
I love to work with graphite pencils
because<00:02:20.920> there's<00:02:21.310> not<00:02:21.520> anything<00:02:21.790> scary<00:02:22.420> about

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
because there's not anything scary about

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:24.930 
because there's not anything scary about
that<00:02:22.810> it's<00:02:23.200> not<00:02:23.380> intimidating<00:02:24.130> you<00:02:24.580> only<00:02:24.730> have

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
that it's not intimidating you only have

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:26.220 
that it's not intimidating you only have
to<00:02:25.060> deal<00:02:25.210> with<00:02:25.330> black<00:02:25.570> and<00:02:25.780> white<00:02:25.840> instead<00:02:26.140> of

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
to deal with black and white instead of

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.290 
to deal with black and white instead of
dealing<00:02:26.470> with<00:02:26.620> color<00:02:26.950> so<00:02:27.550> one<00:02:27.760> way<00:02:27.910> to<00:02:27.940> kind<00:02:28.240> of

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 
dealing with color so one way to kind of

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:29.820 
dealing with color so one way to kind of
sneak<00:02:28.540> up<00:02:28.750> on<00:02:28.870> a<00:02:28.900> watercolor<00:02:29.440> pencil

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
sneak up on a watercolor pencil

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:31.500 
sneak up on a watercolor pencil
technique<00:02:29.980> is<00:02:30.340> to<00:02:30.490> take<00:02:30.670> a<00:02:30.700> graphite<00:02:31.240> drawing

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
technique is to take a graphite drawing

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.120 
technique is to take a graphite drawing
that<00:02:31.690> you<00:02:31.750> have<00:02:31.960> and<00:02:32.170> wash<00:02:32.680> it<00:02:32.890> with<00:02:33.010> the

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
that you have and wash it with the

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:35.010 
that you have and wash it with the
watercolor<00:02:33.610> pencil<00:02:34.090> I'm<00:02:34.450> going<00:02:34.600> to<00:02:34.780> show<00:02:34.960> you

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.020 
watercolor pencil I'm going to show you

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:36.300 
watercolor pencil I'm going to show you
how<00:02:35.200> to<00:02:35.230> do<00:02:35.470> that<00:02:35.620> in<00:02:35.740> just<00:02:35.890> a<00:02:35.980> minute<00:02:36.070> but

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
how to do that in just a minute but

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:37.830 
how to do that in just a minute but
first<00:02:36.490> of<00:02:36.730> all<00:02:36.820> I<00:02:36.910> want<00:02:37.090> to<00:02:37.180> talk<00:02:37.360> about<00:02:37.630> a

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
first of all I want to talk about a

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.870 
first of all I want to talk about a
companion<00:02:38.710> for<00:02:38.890> the<00:02:38.980> watercolor<00:02:39.430> pencil

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
companion for the watercolor pencil

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.270 
companion for the watercolor pencil
called<00:02:40.060> water<00:02:40.420> soluble<00:02:40.900> graphite<00:02:41.380> it's

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
called water soluble graphite it's

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.460 
called water soluble graphite it's
actually<00:02:42.730> a<00:02:42.760> graphite<00:02:43.240> pencil<00:02:43.300> but<00:02:44.230> when<00:02:44.380> you

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
actually a graphite pencil but when you

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.140 
actually a graphite pencil but when you
add<00:02:44.590> water<00:02:44.860> to<00:02:45.070> it<00:02:45.190> it<00:02:45.340> does<00:02:45.700> the<00:02:45.850> same<00:02:46.090> thing

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
add water to it it does the same thing

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.960 
add water to it it does the same thing
that<00:02:46.570> watercolor<00:02:46.900> pencils<00:02:47.500> do<00:02:47.740> let<00:02:48.700> me<00:02:48.820> show

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
that watercolor pencils do let me show

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.840 
that watercolor pencils do let me show
you<00:02:49.030> how<00:02:49.210> that<00:02:49.240> works<00:02:50.160> this<00:02:51.160> is<00:02:51.340> a<00:02:51.520> water

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850 
you how that works this is a water

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:53.760 
you how that works this is a water
soluble<00:02:52.180> graphite<00:02:52.570> joined<00:02:53.170> that<00:02:53.320> I<00:02:53.380> did<00:02:53.620> of<00:02:53.740> my

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:53.770 
soluble graphite joined that I did of my

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:55.470 
soluble graphite joined that I did of my
cousin<00:02:54.340> Rachel<00:02:54.760> and<00:02:54.970> you<00:02:55.030> can<00:02:55.180> see<00:02:55.360> it's

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
cousin Rachel and you can see it's

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.150 
cousin Rachel and you can see it's
really<00:02:55.750> pretty<00:02:55.900> easy<00:02:56.200> to<00:02:56.440> do<00:02:56.620> because<00:02:56.770> all<00:02:57.070> you

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
really pretty easy to do because all you

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:58.920 
really pretty easy to do because all you
have<00:02:57.250> to<00:02:57.370> do<00:02:57.490> is<00:02:57.640> put<00:02:57.850> in<00:02:57.970> a<00:02:58.060> few<00:02:58.270> of<00:02:58.360> the<00:02:58.480> values

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
have to do is put in a few of the values

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:00.720 
have to do is put in a few of the values
and<00:02:58.960> wash<00:02:59.350> things<00:02:59.680> in<00:02:59.890> and<00:03:00.280> actually<00:03:00.580> came

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
and wash things in and actually came

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:02.370 
and wash things in and actually came
back<00:03:00.850> with<00:03:01.060> a<00:03:01.090> dry<00:03:01.390> graphite<00:03:01.810> pencil<00:03:02.140> to<00:03:02.230> put

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:02.380 
back with a dry graphite pencil to put

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.500 
back with a dry graphite pencil to put
in<00:03:02.500> the<00:03:02.590> detail<00:03:02.950> in<00:03:03.100> her<00:03:03.220> hair<00:03:03.490> the<00:03:04.150> other<00:03:04.270> day

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
in the detail in her hair the other day

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.330 
in the detail in her hair the other day
I<00:03:04.540> was<00:03:04.780> at<00:03:04.990> the<00:03:05.080> pet<00:03:05.290> shop<00:03:05.560> and<00:03:05.860> I<00:03:05.950> saw<00:03:06.190> this

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
I was at the pet shop and I saw this

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.040 
I was at the pet shop and I saw this
wonderful<00:03:06.640> little<00:03:07.120> bloodhound<00:03:07.780> that<00:03:07.900> looked

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:08.050 
wonderful little bloodhound that looked

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:09.540 
wonderful little bloodhound that looked
like<00:03:08.110> he<00:03:08.320> really<00:03:08.590> wanted<00:03:08.980> to<00:03:09.070> go<00:03:09.190> home<00:03:09.370> with

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:09.550 
like he really wanted to go home with

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
somebody he looked like he was looking

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.630 
somebody he looked like he was looking
for<00:03:10.900> a<00:03:10.930> best<00:03:11.170> friend<00:03:11.500> so<00:03:11.950> I<00:03:12.010> snapped<00:03:12.280> a<00:03:12.430> picture

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
for a best friend so I snapped a picture

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.370 
for a best friend so I snapped a picture
of<00:03:12.820> him<00:03:12.940> and<00:03:13.090> I<00:03:13.120> did<00:03:13.270> a<00:03:13.300> graphite<00:03:13.780> drawing<00:03:14.110> and

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
of him and I did a graphite drawing and

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.620 
of him and I did a graphite drawing and
I<00:03:14.860> showed<00:03:15.100> that<00:03:15.340> on<00:03:15.460> another<00:03:15.730> video<00:03:15.940> but<00:03:16.540> I'm

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630 
I showed that on another video but I'm

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:17.850 
I showed that on another video but I'm
going<00:03:16.780> to<00:03:16.810> show<00:03:17.020> you<00:03:17.080> a<00:03:17.200> new<00:03:17.380> technique<00:03:17.800> for

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:17.860 
going to show you a new technique for

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:19.650 
going to show you a new technique for
working<00:03:18.370> with<00:03:18.490> that<00:03:18.610> particular<00:03:18.940> drawing<00:03:19.360> I

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660 
working with that particular drawing I

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.720 
working with that particular drawing I
actually<00:03:20.110> took<00:03:20.440> that<00:03:20.680> graph<00:03:20.920> I<00:03:21.100> joined<00:03:21.400> and<00:03:21.640> I

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
actually took that graph I joined and I

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:24.240 
actually took that graph I joined and I
photocopied<00:03:22.510> it<00:03:22.600> onto<00:03:23.080> watercolor<00:03:23.650> paper<00:03:23.950> and

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
photocopied it onto watercolor paper and

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:25.860 
photocopied it onto watercolor paper and
then<00:03:24.730> I'm<00:03:24.850> going<00:03:25.030> to<00:03:25.060> wash<00:03:25.300> it<00:03:25.330> with<00:03:25.660> water

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
then I'm going to wash it with water

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:27.570 
then I'm going to wash it with water
here's<00:03:26.140> the<00:03:26.350> example<00:03:26.740> of<00:03:26.980> the<00:03:27.100> graphite

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:27.580 
here's the example of the graphite

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:29.220 
here's the example of the graphite
drawing<00:03:27.910> that<00:03:28.060> I<00:03:28.120> did<00:03:28.210> this<00:03:28.840> was<00:03:28.990> through<00:03:29.140> the

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230 
drawing that I did this was through the

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:30.510 
drawing that I did this was through the
copier<00:03:29.590> and<00:03:29.680> I<00:03:29.740> got<00:03:29.890> all<00:03:30.010> these<00:03:30.190> wonderful

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:30.520 
copier and I got all these wonderful

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:32.370 
copier and I got all these wonderful
values<00:03:31.090> and<00:03:31.330> I'm<00:03:31.660> going<00:03:31.780> to<00:03:31.840> show<00:03:32.020> you<00:03:32.050> how<00:03:32.350> I

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:32.380 
values and I'm going to show you how I

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:34.890 
values and I'm going to show you how I
would<00:03:32.530> tint<00:03:32.830> that<00:03:32.980> now<00:03:33.220> what<00:03:34.150> I<00:03:34.180> do<00:03:34.300> is<00:03:34.600> I<00:03:34.690> take

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900 
would tint that now what I do is I take

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:36.480 
would tint that now what I do is I take
my<00:03:34.960> watercolor<00:03:35.590> pencil<00:03:36.070> and<00:03:36.220> I'm<00:03:36.310> actually

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:36.490 
my watercolor pencil and I'm actually

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:38.340 
my watercolor pencil and I'm actually
going<00:03:36.730> to<00:03:36.820> build<00:03:37.060> this<00:03:37.210> on<00:03:37.450> another<00:03:37.810> sheet<00:03:38.290> of

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:38.350 
going to build this on another sheet of

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:41.220 
going to build this on another sheet of
paper<00:03:38.730> so<00:03:39.730> I'm<00:03:40.090> going<00:03:40.300> to<00:03:40.360> create<00:03:40.600> a<00:03:40.660> cake<00:03:40.990> for

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
paper so I'm going to create a cake for

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:42.810 
paper so I'm going to create a cake for
myself<00:03:41.590> remember<00:03:41.950> this<00:03:42.070> is<00:03:42.250> a<00:03:42.280> technique<00:03:42.760> that

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:42.820 
myself remember this is a technique that

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:45.060 
myself remember this is a technique that
we<00:03:43.060> showed<00:03:43.270> a<00:03:43.300> little<00:03:43.420> bit<00:03:43.660> earlier<00:03:44.080> I'm<00:03:44.830> going

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:45.070 
we showed a little bit earlier I'm going

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:47.480 
we showed a little bit earlier I'm going
to<00:03:45.130> build<00:03:45.280> up<00:03:45.460> a<00:03:45.580> little<00:03:45.760> bit<00:03:45.940> of<00:03:46.090> watercolor

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:47.490 
to build up a little bit of watercolor

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:49.680 
to build up a little bit of watercolor
pigment<00:03:48.490> for<00:03:48.610> myself<00:03:49.030> and<00:03:49.270> then<00:03:49.570> I'm<00:03:49.660> just

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
pigment for myself and then I'm just

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:51.120 
pigment for myself and then I'm just
going<00:03:49.990> to<00:03:50.020> take<00:03:50.230> this<00:03:50.410> and<00:03:50.620> I'm<00:03:50.680> going<00:03:50.800> to<00:03:50.890> wash

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.130 
going to take this and I'm going to wash

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:54.510 
going to take this and I'm going to wash
it<00:03:51.160> over<00:03:51.760> this<00:03:52.270> graphite<00:03:52.840> drawing<00:03:53.230> and<00:03:54.040> you

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:54.520 
it over this graphite drawing and you

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:56.430 
it over this graphite drawing and you
can<00:03:54.730> see<00:03:54.970> that<00:03:55.180> I<00:03:55.210> immediately<00:03:56.020> have<00:03:56.230> this

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:56.440 
can see that I immediately have this

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.460 
can see that I immediately have this
full<00:03:56.890> range<00:03:57.310> of<00:03:57.520> values<00:03:57.940> without<00:03:58.840> having<00:03:59.380> to

00:03:59.460 --> 00:03:59.470 
full range of values without having to

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:02.130 
full range of values without having to
put<00:03:59.680> any<00:03:59.920> of<00:04:00.220> that<00:04:00.250> in<00:04:00.460> there<00:04:00.940> so<00:04:01.120> I<00:04:01.810> don't<00:04:02.050> have

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:02.140 
put any of that in there so I don't have

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:04.740 
put any of that in there so I don't have
to<00:04:02.290> come<00:04:02.470> back<00:04:02.650> and<00:04:03.010> do<00:04:03.760> all<00:04:03.820> that<00:04:03.940> gradating

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:04.750 
to come back and do all that gradating

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:07.830 
to come back and do all that gradating
and<00:04:04.870> so<00:04:05.050> forth<00:04:05.580> that<00:04:06.580> makes<00:04:06.790> it<00:04:07.000> so<00:04:07.270> fast<00:04:07.630> and

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 
and so forth that makes it so fast and

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.750 
and so forth that makes it so fast and
so<00:04:08.050> easy<00:04:08.080> this<00:04:08.560> is<00:04:08.620> a<00:04:08.740> really<00:04:09.070> fun<00:04:09.280> technique<00:04:09.460> I

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760 
so easy this is a really fun technique I

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:11.910 
so easy this is a really fun technique I
like<00:04:09.910> doing<00:04:10.180> this<00:04:10.270> for<00:04:10.570> greeting<00:04:11.230> cards<00:04:11.260> and
