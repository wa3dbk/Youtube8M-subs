00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
to the input of tank circuit now let see

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.800 
to the input of tank circuit now let see
how<00:03:13.800> these<00:03:13.980> three<00:03:14.310> blocks<00:03:14.610> are<00:03:15.060> implemented

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
how these three blocks are implemented

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.270 
how these three blocks are implemented
in<00:03:16.050> the<00:03:16.430> magnetostriction<00:03:17.430> oscillator<00:03:18.230> okay

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 
in the magnetostriction oscillator okay

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.910 
in the magnetostriction oscillator okay
so<00:03:20.600> the<00:03:21.600> first<00:03:21.900> requirement<00:03:22.410> is<00:03:22.800> a

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
so the first requirement is a

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.550 
so the first requirement is a
ferromagnetic<00:03:23.550> role<00:03:23.910> of<00:03:24.480> suitable<00:03:25.380> length

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
ferromagnetic role of suitable length

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.050 
ferromagnetic role of suitable length
plates<00:03:25.980> in<00:03:26.160> the<00:03:26.220> length<00:03:26.459> of<00:03:26.670> the<00:03:26.880> rod<00:03:27.000> is

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
plates in the length of the rod is

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:31.729 
plates in the length of the rod is
capital<00:03:27.780> L<00:03:28.340> the<00:03:29.340> second<00:03:29.670> thing<00:03:30.440> the<00:03:31.440> rod<00:03:31.709> can

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
capital L the second thing the rod can

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:35.630 
capital L the second thing the rod can
vibrate<00:03:32.220> along<00:03:32.760> X<00:03:33.030> as<00:03:33.239> well<00:03:33.540> as<00:03:33.600> Y<00:03:34.080> axis<00:03:34.290> but<00:03:35.130> we

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
vibrate along X as well as Y axis but we

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.820 
vibrate along X as well as Y axis but we
have<00:03:35.910> to<00:03:36.060> avoid<00:03:36.480> the<00:03:36.690> vertical<00:03:37.140> vibration<00:03:37.290> of

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:37.830 
have to avoid the vertical vibration of

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:41.030 
have to avoid the vertical vibration of
the<00:03:37.950> rod<00:03:38.130> hence<00:03:38.880> we<00:03:39.510> will<00:03:39.690> clamp<00:03:40.260> the<00:03:40.560> road<00:03:40.830> at

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
the rod hence we will clamp the road at

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.570 
the rod hence we will clamp the road at
the<00:03:41.220> center

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:43.580 
the center

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:45.890 
the center
now<00:03:44.580> this<00:03:44.820> clamping<00:03:45.300> will<00:03:45.450> avoid<00:03:45.690> the

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
now this clamping will avoid the

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.110 
now this clamping will avoid the
vertical<00:03:46.350> vibration<00:03:46.620> of<00:03:47.130> the<00:03:47.280> rod<00:03:47.459> so<00:03:47.910> now<00:03:48.060> the

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
vertical vibration of the rod so now the

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.570 
vertical vibration of the rod so now the
rod<00:03:48.510> is<00:03:48.780> restricted<00:03:49.500> to<00:03:49.650> vibrate<00:03:49.980> only<00:03:50.160> along

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:50.580 
rod is restricted to vibrate only along

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:55.130 
rod is restricted to vibrate only along
x<00:03:50.910> axis<00:03:51.770> second<00:03:52.770> thing<00:03:52.980> I<00:03:53.160> require<00:03:53.640> a<00:03:54.360> coil<00:03:54.810> and

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:47.180 

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:51.270 

then<00:05:47.750> you<00:05:48.290> require<00:05:48.620> a<00:05:49.040> high-tension<00:05:49.550> Bible

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:51.280 
then you require a high-tension Bible

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:54.850 
then you require a high-tension Bible
okay<00:05:52.280> so<00:05:52.639> this<00:05:52.820> is<00:05:53.030> HD<00:05:53.660> that<00:05:53.960> is<00:05:54.110> high<00:05:54.440> ancient

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:54.860 
okay so this is HD that is high ancient

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:57.730 
okay so this is HD that is high ancient
Bible<00:05:55.040> this<00:05:55.639> is<00:05:55.850> the<00:05:56.030> switch-case<00:05:56.470> now<00:05:57.470> if<00:05:57.620> you

00:05:57.730 --> 00:05:57.740 
Bible this is the switch-case now if you

00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:59.020 
Bible this is the switch-case now if you
place<00:05:58.100> the<00:05:58.340> switch

00:05:59.020 --> 00:05:59.030 
place the switch

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:01.080 
place the switch
okay<00:05:59.570> the<00:05:59.720> current<00:06:00.110> will<00:06:00.320> enter<00:06:00.710> in<00:06:00.889> the

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:01.090 
okay the current will enter in the

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:05.590 
okay the current will enter in the
capacitor<00:06:02.090> so<00:06:02.479> capacitor<00:06:03.110> gets<00:06:03.350> charged<00:06:04.570> okay

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:05.600 
capacitor so capacitor gets charged okay

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:09.400 
capacitor so capacitor gets charged okay
so<00:06:06.320> due<00:06:07.160> to<00:06:07.190> the<00:06:07.430> charging<00:06:07.910> of<00:06:08.060> capacitor<00:06:08.410> you

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:09.410 
so due to the charging of capacitor you

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:11.550 
so due to the charging of capacitor you
will<00:06:09.590> get<00:06:09.770> this<00:06:10.070> kind<00:06:10.280> of<00:06:10.520> a<00:06:10.639> charging<00:06:10.970> curve

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:11.560 
will get this kind of a charging curve

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:14.170 
will get this kind of a charging curve
after<00:06:12.560> certain<00:06:13.160> instant<00:06:13.580> of<00:06:13.669> time<00:06:13.729> the

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:14.180 
after certain instant of time the

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:17.469 
after certain instant of time the
capacitor<00:06:14.330> will<00:06:14.810> get<00:06:15.020> fully<00:06:15.380> charged<00:06:15.650> now<00:06:16.550> the

00:06:17.469 --> 00:06:17.479 
capacitor will get fully charged now the

00:06:17.479 --> 00:06:19.300 
capacitor will get fully charged now the
discharging<00:06:18.110> of<00:06:18.199> the<00:06:18.260> capacitor<00:06:18.380> will<00:06:19.070> start

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:19.310 
discharging of the capacitor will start

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:22.029 
discharging of the capacitor will start
so<00:06:19.760> that<00:06:19.789> capacitor<00:06:20.780> we<00:06:20.930> can<00:06:20.960> discharge<00:06:21.320> the

00:06:22.029 --> 00:06:22.039 
so that capacitor we can discharge the

00:06:22.039 --> 00:06:25.090 
so that capacitor we can discharge the
current<00:06:22.940> will<00:06:23.539> now<00:06:23.720> start<00:06:24.080> flowing<00:06:24.740> through

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:25.100 
current will now start flowing through

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:28.750 
current will now start flowing through
the<00:06:25.190> coil<00:06:25.400> a<00:06:25.669> -<00:06:26.080> okay<00:06:27.080> now<00:06:27.320> this<00:06:27.500> DKA<00:06:28.190> will<00:06:28.520> not

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:28.760 
the coil a - okay now this DKA will not

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:31.540 
the coil a - okay now this DKA will not
be<00:06:29.000> the<00:06:29.630> sudden<00:06:30.050> the<00:06:30.320> decay<00:06:30.650> will<00:06:30.860> be<00:06:31.070> like

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:31.550 
be the sudden the decay will be like

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:35.320 
be the sudden the decay will be like
this<00:06:32.320> okay<00:06:33.320> so<00:06:33.919> as<00:06:34.220> a<00:06:34.250> result<00:06:34.760> the<00:06:34.940> current

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:35.330 
this okay so as a result the current

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:37.810 
this okay so as a result the current
flowing<00:06:35.600> through<00:06:35.810> l2<00:06:36.470> will<00:06:37.010> be<00:06:37.160> an<00:06:37.280> AC<00:06:37.669> current

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:37.820 
flowing through l2 will be an AC current

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:41.830 
flowing through l2 will be an AC current
okay<00:06:38.810> so<00:06:39.590> this<00:06:40.070> AC<00:06:40.639> current<00:06:41.090> will<00:06:41.570> also

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:41.840 
okay so this AC current will also

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:44.980 
okay so this AC current will also
produce<00:06:42.740> a<00:06:43.190> variable<00:06:44.000> magnetic<00:06:44.449> field<00:06:44.690> in<00:06:44.840> the

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:44.990 
produce a variable magnetic field in the

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:47.529 
produce a variable magnetic field in the
