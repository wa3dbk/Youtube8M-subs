juice inside this this freezer bag and I
do<00:00:33.300> want<00:00:33.660> to<00:00:33.780> keep<00:00:34.170> that<00:00:34.410> juice<00:00:35.360> but<00:00:36.360> I<00:00:36.390> also

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
do want to keep that juice but I also

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:37.910 
do want to keep that juice but I also
want<00:00:36.870> to<00:00:36.930> strain<00:00:37.200> it<00:00:37.230> through<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:37.620> straining

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920

straight<00:00:40.739> into<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.100> bag<00:00:41.280> and<00:00:41.579> it<00:00:41.969> will<00:00:42.090> go

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
straight into the bag and it will go

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.020 
straight into the bag and it will go
right<00:00:42.390> past<00:00:42.600> right<00:00:42.989> through<00:00:43.579> it'll<00:00:44.579> strain<00:00:44.850> it

right past right through it'll strain it

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:54.369 
right past right through it'll strain it
and<00:00:45.300> it<00:00:45.420> will<00:00:45.510> go<00:00:45.660> right<00:00:45.809> in<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:46.110> fermenter

00:00:54.369 --> 00:00:54.379 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:56.630 

supposed<00:00:55.379> to<00:00:55.440> be<00:00:55.559> calls<00:00:55.739> for<00:00:55.980> three<00:00:56.309> to<00:00:56.430> four

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
supposed to be calls for three to four

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.939 
supposed to be calls for three to four
pounds<00:00:56.879> of<00:00:57.120> red<00:00:57.270> raspberries<00:00:57.840> and<00:00:58.020> I<00:00:58.199> am<00:00:58.379> using

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
pounds of red raspberries and I am using

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:23.210 
pounds of red raspberries and I am using
four<00:00:59.309> pounds

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.719 

camera<00:01:24.220> can't<00:01:24.460> show<00:01:24.850> you<00:01:26.100> can't<00:01:27.100> smell<00:01:27.400> the

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:27.729 
camera can't show you can't smell the

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:35.880 
camera can't show you can't smell the
camera<00:01:28.150> on<00:01:28.479> 50<00:01:28.960> draft<00:01:29.290> rights<00:01:29.590> no<00:01:34.770> okay<00:01:35.770> and

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:35.890 
camera on 50 draft rights no okay and

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.090 
camera on 50 draft rights no okay and
once<00:01:36.010> I've<00:01:36.130> dumped<00:01:36.310> them<00:01:36.460> all<00:01:36.550> in<00:01:37.950> I'm<00:01:38.950> going

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 
once I've dumped them all in I'm going

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:44.580 
once I've dumped them all in I'm going
to<00:01:40.560> type<00:01:41.560> up<00:01:41.710> the<00:01:41.830> bag<00:01:43.259> string<00:01:44.259> it<00:01:44.350> over<00:01:44.500> the

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 
to type up the bag string it over the

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.380 
to type up the bag string it over the
side<00:01:44.800> now<00:01:45.250> I<00:01:45.280> usually<00:01:45.460> just<00:01:45.820> kind<00:01:46.000> of<00:01:46.090> tie<00:01:46.330> it

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:46.390 
side now I usually just kind of tie it

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:57.230 
side now I usually just kind of tie it
to<00:01:46.630> the<00:01:46.720> pail<00:01:48.180> the<00:01:49.180> time<00:01:49.420> being

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:19.560 

so<00:01:58.240> make<00:01:58.360> sure<00:01:58.390> it<00:01:58.600> doesn't<00:01:59.020> plop<00:01:59.289> in<00:02:18.390> and<00:02:19.390> you

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:19.570 
so make sure it doesn't plop in and you

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:28.199 
so make sure it doesn't plop in and you
can<00:02:19.720> see<00:02:20.340> nice<00:02:21.340> looking<00:02:21.700> as<00:02:21.820> Brady's<00:02:22.299> in<00:02:22.330> there

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:30.610 

and<00:02:29.209> my<00:02:29.330> next<00:02:29.569> step<00:02:29.599> is<00:02:29.870> to<00:02:29.930> add<00:02:30.409> my

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
and my next step is to add my

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.170 
and my next step is to add my
ingredients<00:02:30.890> and<00:02:33.519> dump<00:02:34.519> them<00:02:34.640> right<00:02:34.700> into<00:02:35.000> the

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
ingredients and dump them right into the

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:41.500 
ingredients and dump them right into the
juice<00:02:35.360> try<00:02:35.750> not<00:02:35.900> to<00:02:35.989> get<00:02:36.079> it<00:02:36.200> on<00:02:36.319> the<00:02:36.439> bag<00:02:40.510> okay

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
juice try not to get it on the bag okay

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:42.580 
juice try not to get it on the bag okay
you<00:02:41.569> can<00:02:41.780> see<00:02:41.930> here<00:02:42.110> I've<00:02:42.200> measured<00:02:42.379> about

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
you can see here I've measured about

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.360 
you can see here I've measured about
half<00:02:42.860> a<00:02:42.980> pound<00:02:43.159> of<00:02:43.400> sugar<00:02:44.980> and<00:02:45.980> I'm<00:02:46.190> going<00:02:46.220> to

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
half a pound of sugar and I'm going to

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:47.979 
half a pound of sugar and I'm going to
go<00:02:46.430> ahead<00:02:46.489> and<00:02:46.700> add<00:02:46.760> that<00:02:46.819> now<00:02:47.540> it<00:02:47.840> doesn't

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:47.989 
go ahead and add that now it doesn't

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:50.649 
go ahead and add that now it doesn't
have<00:02:48.170> to<00:02:48.290> be<00:02:48.409> exact<00:02:48.890> in<00:02:49.519> Mary's<00:02:49.940> recipes<00:02:50.420> book

00:02:50.649 --> 00:02:50.659 
have to be exact in Mary's recipes book

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:53.470 
have to be exact in Mary's recipes book
does<00:02:51.049> have<00:02:51.290> some<00:02:52.000> convergent<00:02:53.000> conversion

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
does have some convergent conversion

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.780 
does have some convergent conversion
factors<00:02:53.870> so<00:02:54.049> you<00:02:54.140> could<00:02:54.319> leave<00:02:55.159> it's<00:02:55.340> like<00:02:55.519> two

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
factors so you could leave it's like two

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:57.420 
factors so you could leave it's like two
and<00:02:55.940> a<00:02:55.970> half<00:02:56.090> cups<00:02:56.390> of<00:02:56.599> sugar<00:02:56.659> there's<00:02:57.290> a

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
and a half cups of sugar there's a

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.500 
and a half cups of sugar there's a
approximately<00:02:58.430> equivalent<00:02:58.609> to<00:02:58.939> half<00:02:59.239> a<00:02:59.329> pound

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
approximately equivalent to half a pound

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:04.360 
approximately equivalent to half a pound
so<00:03:00.260> you<00:03:00.349> could<00:03:00.470> go<00:03:00.650> that<00:03:00.829> route<00:03:01.010> and<00:03:03.370> it

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
so you could go that route and it

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:06.009 
so you could go that route and it
doesn't<00:03:04.700> need<00:03:04.790> to<00:03:04.879> be<00:03:04.940> exact<00:03:05.329> because<00:03:05.510> later

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:06.019 
doesn't need to be exact because later

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:07.360 
doesn't need to be exact because later
on<00:03:06.170> you're<00:03:06.319> going<00:03:06.349> to<00:03:06.560> test<00:03:06.769> the<00:03:06.950> specific

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
on you're going to test the specific

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.490 
on you're going to test the specific
gravity<00:03:07.549> and<00:03:07.879> add<00:03:08.090> water<00:03:08.359> or<00:03:08.540> sugar<00:03:08.959> as<00:03:09.139> needed

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
gravity and add water or sugar as needed

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.280 
gravity and add water or sugar as needed
to<00:03:09.650> get<00:03:09.920> to<00:03:10.069> the<00:03:10.720> specific<00:03:11.720> gravity<00:03:11.900> that<00:03:12.139> you

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
to get to the specific gravity that you

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:16.599 
to get to the specific gravity that you
need<00:03:14.019> now<00:03:15.019> don't<00:03:15.950> look<00:03:16.040> at<00:03:16.190> the<00:03:16.250> side<00:03:16.400> of<00:03:16.489> my

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:16.609 
need now don't look at the side of my

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:20.710 
need now don't look at the side of my
bucket<00:03:17.209> here<00:03:18.879> and<00:03:19.879> I've<00:03:20.000> got<00:03:20.150> these<00:03:20.269> markings

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
bucket here and I've got these markings

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.490 
bucket here and I've got these markings
okay<00:03:21.409> I<00:03:21.590> need<00:03:22.579> to<00:03:22.760> go<00:03:23.239> ahead<00:03:23.389> and<00:03:23.480> fill<00:03:23.690> this<00:03:23.870> to

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
okay I need to go ahead and fill this to

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.800 
okay I need to go ahead and fill this to
one<00:03:25.069> gallon<00:03:25.310> of<00:03:25.519> water<00:03:25.810> now<00:03:26.810> I'm<00:03:27.530> kind<00:03:27.829> of<00:03:27.889> a

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
one gallon of water now I'm kind of a

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.360 
one gallon of water now I'm kind of a
old-fashioned<00:03:29.810> and<00:03:30.049> I<00:03:30.440> don't<00:03:31.069> like<00:03:31.159> to<00:03:31.250> use

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
old-fashioned and I don't like to use

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:33.129 
old-fashioned and I don't like to use
the<00:03:31.519> softened<00:03:31.970> water<00:03:32.090> on<00:03:32.329> my<00:03:32.480> tap<00:03:32.750> I<00:03:32.989> actually

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:33.139 
the softened water on my tap I actually

00:03:33.139 --> 00:03:35.580 
the softened water on my tap I actually
like<00:03:33.440> to<00:03:33.590> use<00:03:33.620> water<00:03:34.310> from<00:03:34.760> the<00:03:34.970> faucet

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
like to use water from the faucet

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.170 
like to use water from the faucet
outside<00:03:36.590> because<00:03:37.430> it<00:03:37.549> doesn't<00:03:37.819> go<00:03:37.879> through<00:03:38.060> my

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
outside because it doesn't go through my

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:39.699 
outside because it doesn't go through my
water<00:03:38.419> softening<00:03:38.900> system<00:03:39.290> so<00:03:39.440> I'm<00:03:39.500> going<00:03:39.650> to

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:39.709 
water softening system so I'm going to

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:41.559 
water softening system so I'm going to
go<00:03:39.769> ahead<00:03:39.859> and<00:03:40.069> get<00:03:40.310> the<00:03:40.879> water<00:03:41.090> that<00:03:41.299> I<00:03:41.359> need

00:03:41.559 --> 00:03:41.569

nine<00:05:30.210> five<00:05:30.630> okay<00:05:31.440> so<00:05:32.340> what<00:05:32.669> I<00:05:32.729> need<00:05:32.759> to<00:05:33.000> do<00:05:33.120> is

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:33.770 
nine five okay so what I need to do is

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:36.830 
nine five okay so what I need to do is
take<00:05:34.770> this<00:05:34.919> instrument<00:05:35.419> put<00:05:36.419> it<00:05:36.509> inside<00:05:36.720> the

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:36.840 
take this instrument put it inside the

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:48.350 
take this instrument put it inside the
beaker<00:05:38.659> siphon<00:05:39.659> off<00:05:39.780> some<00:05:39.810> juice

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:48.360 

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:56.520 

and<00:05:49.360> fill<00:05:49.900> the<00:05:50.080> beaker<00:05:50.200> with<00:05:50.410> juice<00:05:55.530> until

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:56.530 
and fill the beaker with juice until

00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:10.650 
and fill the beaker with juice until
that<00:05:56.830> instrument<00:05:57.400> starts<00:05:57.670> to<00:05:57.880> rise<00:06:09.420> look<00:06:10.420> at

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:10.660 
that instrument starts to rise look at

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:13.020 
that instrument starts to rise look at
the<00:06:11.410> level<00:06:11.800> and<00:06:12.190> I<00:06:12.340> can<00:06:12.370> see<00:06:12.700> that<00:06:12.820> were

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:13.030 
the level and I can see that were

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:18.390 
the level and I can see that were
already<00:06:13.210> way<00:06:13.510> low<00:06:13.840> on<00:06:14.050> this<00:06:15.450> this<00:06:16.450> is<00:06:16.690> 1.0<00:06:17.470> 3<00:06:18.130> 5

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:18.400 
already way low on this this is 1.0 3 5

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:21.030 
already way low on this this is 1.0 3 5
or<00:06:18.430> so<00:06:18.990> so<00:06:19.990> I'm<00:06:20.110> going<00:06:20.230> to<00:06:20.260> need<00:06:20.410> to<00:06:20.620> add<00:06:20.770> quite

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:21.040 
or so so I'm going to need to add quite

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:24.560 
or so so I'm going to need to add quite
a<00:06:21.100> bit<00:06:21.250> of<00:06:21.370> sugar<00:06:21.400> to<00:06:21.700> get<00:06:21.820> this<00:06:21.910> up<00:06:22.120> to<00:06:22.150> 1.0<00:06:22.930> 9<00:06:23.170> 5

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:24.570 
a bit of sugar to get this up to 1.0 9 5

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:29.430 
a bit of sugar to get this up to 1.0 9 5
ok<00:06:25.570> we<00:06:25.810> are<00:06:25.840> up<00:06:26.320> to<00:06:26.500> 1.09<00:06:27.370> 5<00:06:27.750> and<00:06:28.750> then<00:06:29.020> add

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:29.440
