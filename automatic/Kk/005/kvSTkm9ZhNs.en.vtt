00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 Hi , I'm already networking again here 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.600
 I thought it would take and two days 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.220
 go back up something else will call same 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.830
 poster and he told me he had a notice 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.150
 to pick up a sack of potatoes because no 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:16.260
 I know why but they walk me in sack 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:18.240
 potatoes this kind of boxes once finished 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.789
 to arrive I hope that you influence 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.859
 nothing in what is inside 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:26.449
 now the directions and we're going to open it 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.449
 because I already know what it is 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:31.390
 4 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.559
 I already did the blue tooth once and 

00:00:36.359 --> 00:00:39.559
 he left one in the attempt 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:49.270
 over here we have the new script guide 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:49.270
 the limited edition 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:55.120
 now I will erase this that comes out here the 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.120
 information 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.370
 and we are going to do 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:16.780
 come do not put it 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:16.780
 own one's own 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:28.350
 other cardboard 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:31.130
 and we are going to open this 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.130
 on the side 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:34.260
 to see the interior 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:47.580
 there we see what it brings 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:47.580
 includes the post 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.409
 but you can see 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:58.390
 you will have to delete the codes that 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.390
 after they have seen 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.659
 it's a bum dayz 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:10.860
 half finger 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:13.970
 of coarse compared to the first 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.970
 edition here we have it 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.650
 there you see the difference in size 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:25.739
 if this by itself was already gross 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.329
 here she is even more so although the 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:29.689
 design of the first one I like more than the 

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:29.689
 other 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.530
 this is a one just a little 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:41.670
 I do not like I do not have to convince 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.569
 remove this from the middle 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.569
 for that for me back 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:52.450
 this track a lot the truth 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.450
 here we have your bustamente 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:00.170
 to leave it there I will take the camera that 

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:00.170
 it's going to be easier 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.760
 on the beauty page also 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.370
 Do you sell 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:11.319
 this 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:14.100
 as if it were a lithograph 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:15.960
 the tablet well 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:18.710
 but they do not say they're limited or anything 

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:18.710
 stretched normal 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:22.239
 let's go to more things 

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:36.440
 let's take the content 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:48.230
 because they are a lot a lot of 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:51.489
 pages 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:51.489
 here I take the light 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:04.010
 who likes to see that 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.010
 now you have 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:11.819
 and here comes what is the guide 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:22.440
 this checks not all whole because if not 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:25.330
 I can throw a life here some 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:29.289
 pages to give you an idea 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:31.149
 already has the separators as in the other 

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:34.499
 the houses that already touch a little there 

00:04:31.149 --> 00:04:34.499
 but not with a little weight 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.840
 ah 

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:16.510
 a lot of information from the 

00:05:13.849 --> 00:05:18.810
 in the places 

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:21.919
 as you can see is 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:21.919
 super of 8 

00:05:36.009 --> 00:05:40.379
 here on the game map 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:55.940
 Today we can see that we are going through the page 

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:58.460
 of 1,117 

00:05:55.940 --> 00:06:00.670
 let's put the 1117 because the rest 

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:00.670
 it is already 

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:08.960
 as the end of them 

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:11.030
 the guide of the places in case you get lost 

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:13.009
 the more you look here is where you are and 

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:15.370
 tells you the pages where those are 

00:06:13.009 --> 00:06:15.370
 missions 

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:22.729
 the truth is that it is a very big guide 

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:30.770
 the position is well grasped what happens 

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:33.350
 I'm not going to take it away, you 'd have to break the 

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:36.290
 little dots this is there 

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:40.900
 rather it is a kind of mega unboxing 

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:40.900
 quick so you can see how in the guide 

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:46.680
 legendary edition 

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:53.240
 moving a lot of government this is already 

00:06:51.849 --> 00:06:56.110
 recording 

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:58.490
 with the official collector's edition 

00:06:56.110 --> 00:07:00.650
 This is the first shipment they took 

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:02.569
 Then they took out a second consignment that 

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:05.210
 put the second well 

00:07:02.569 --> 00:07:06.600
 my mother has fallen to shake the 

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:08.860
 crystal 

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:10.870
 and what he said 

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:12.370
 this the first remittance that they took out later 

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:14.650
 they took out one that I will be with addition 

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:16.900
 down here 

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:19.330
 well it is so for now it has not been 

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:22.000
 exhausted can still be caught I have 

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:23.970
 taken for 30 dollars with shipping from 

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:27.160
 america because I had a discount coupon 

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:28.990
 because they did it with one with one 

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:30.610
 collector's edition with this email 

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:32.889
 and since they could not send it to me 

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:36.689
 they gave that discount and marcel is a lot 

00:07:32.889 --> 00:07:39.539
 cheaper than asking you in amazon uk 

00:07:36.689 --> 00:07:42.239
 and well I hope you liked a 

00:07:39.539 --> 00:07:46.589
 sort of quick view because it's 

00:07:42.239 --> 00:07:48.389
 impossible to make a careful 

00:07:46.589 --> 00:07:51.870
 quietly to see I can throw 

00:07:48.389 --> 00:07:55.020
 here as I said before an eternity 

00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:59.130
 who has doubts that he does not have them if 

00:07:55.020 --> 00:08:01.410
 more or less predominates is English or what 

00:07:59.130 --> 00:08:03.360
 you understand meza for her because she deserves 

00:08:01.410 --> 00:08:07.340
 very much worth it 

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:07.340
 and well that's all until the view
