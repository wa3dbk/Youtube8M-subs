have NASA that explores they may have a
NASA<00:01:57.990> of<00:01:58.290> their<00:01:58.470> sort<00:01:58.830> that<00:01:59.100> explores<00:01:59.700> I<00:02:00.410> think

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:01.410 
NASA of their sort that explores I think

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:03.380 
NASA of their sort that explores I think
they're<00:02:01.530> so<00:02:01.710> amazed<00:02:02.100> at<00:02:02.400> us<00:02:02.550> because<00:02:03.030> we're

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
they're so amazed at us because we're

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.750 
they're so amazed at us because we're
such<00:02:06.320> primitive<00:02:07.490> compared<00:02:08.490> to<00:02:08.610> their

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:08.760 
such primitive compared to their

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:10.520 
such primitive compared to their
standards<00:02:09.360> and<00:02:09.510> I<00:02:09.630> think<00:02:09.869> he's<00:02:10.050> kinda<00:02:10.260> like<00:02:10.320> us

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
standards and I think he's kinda like us

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.380 
standards and I think he's kinda like us
watching<00:02:10.860> an<00:02:11.100> ant<00:02:11.280> farm<00:02:11.370> I<00:02:11.820> think<00:02:12.060> that's<00:02:12.240> the

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
watching an ant farm I think that's the

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.160 
watching an ant farm I think that's the
way<00:02:12.480> they're<00:02:12.690> doing<00:02:12.840> this<00:02:14.330> in<00:02:15.330> Dublin<00:02:15.870> senator
