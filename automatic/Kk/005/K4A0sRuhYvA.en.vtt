our<00:04:21.060> intercepts<00:04:21.570> in<00:04:22.259> the<00:04:22.380> event<00:04:22.590> of<00:04:22.740> a<00:04:23.070> major

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:23.669 
our intercepts in the event of a major

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:27.499 
our intercepts in the event of a major
nuclear<00:04:24.270> conflict<00:04:25.310> the<00:04:26.310> second<00:04:26.699> thing<00:04:26.849> is<00:04:27.150> is

00:04:27.499 --> 00:04:27.509 
nuclear conflict the second thing is is

00:04:27.509 --> 00:04:29.779 
nuclear conflict the second thing is is
that<00:04:27.930> when<00:04:28.259> they<00:04:28.470> die<00:04:28.650> they<00:04:28.949> don't<00:04:29.070> die<00:04:29.400> like

00:04:29.779 --> 00:04:29.789 
that when they die they don't die like

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:32.810 
that when they die they don't die like
we<00:04:30.570> do<00:04:30.780> and<00:04:31.080> they<00:04:31.830> don't<00:04:31.919> regard<00:04:32.340> their<00:04:32.520> bodies

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:32.820 
we do and they don't regard their bodies

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:33.950 
we do and they don't regard their bodies
like<00:04:33.000> we<00:04:33.120> did<00:04:33.270> their<00:04:33.419> bodies<00:04:33.690> are<00:04:33.810> like<00:04:33.900> a

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
like we did their bodies are like a

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.960 
like we did their bodies are like a
shell<00:04:34.289> to<00:04:34.320> them<00:04:34.680> and<00:04:35.099> when<00:04:35.370> they<00:04:35.490> die<00:04:35.699> they

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:35.970 
shell to them and when they die they

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:38.779 
shell to them and when they die they
just<00:04:36.169> get<00:04:37.169> a<00:04:37.199> new<00:04:37.409> body<00:04:37.650> they<00:04:37.949> just<00:04:38.190> they<00:04:38.400> don't

00:04:38.779 --> 00:04:38.789 
just get a new body they just they don't

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:40.640 
just get a new body they just they don't
forget<00:04:39.090> and<00:04:39.419> they<00:04:39.509> just<00:04:39.690> kind<00:04:39.960> of<00:04:40.080> say<00:04:40.289> okay<00:04:40.620> I

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:40.650 
forget and they just kind of say okay I

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:42.290 
forget and they just kind of say okay I
need<00:04:40.770> a<00:04:40.889> new<00:04:41.039> body<00:04:41.159> this<00:04:41.400> one's<00:04:41.580> done<00:04:41.820> and<00:04:42.150> they

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300 
need a new body this one's done and they

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:45.200 
need a new body this one's done and they
go<00:04:42.479> and<00:04:43.219> incarnate<00:04:44.219> themselves<00:04:44.760> into<00:04:44.969> a<00:04:45.000> new

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210 
go and incarnate themselves into a new

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:46.260 
go and incarnate themselves into a new
body<00:04:45.419> so<00:04:45.690> there's<00:04:45.840> no

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:46.270 
body so there's no

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:50.430 
body so there's no
in<00:04:46.569> in<00:04:47.289> what<00:04:47.830> we<00:04:47.949> call<00:04:48.160> death<00:04:48.789> in<00:04:49.259> what<00:04:50.259> some

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:50.440 
in in what we call death in what some

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:51.990 
in in what we call death in what some
people<00:04:50.560> call<00:04:50.860> reincarnation<00:04:51.100> which<00:04:51.639> I<00:04:51.789> happen

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 
people call reincarnation which I happen

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.450 
people call reincarnation which I happen
to<00:04:52.030> believe<00:04:52.180> in<00:04:52.470> so<00:04:53.470> do<00:04:53.770> you<00:04:53.860> think<00:04:54.100> did<00:04:54.340> this

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:54.460 
to believe in so do you think did this

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:56.760 
to believe in so do you think did this
really<00:04:54.849> change<00:04:55.150> your<00:04:55.330> life<00:04:55.539> in<00:04:55.960> the<00:04:56.110> 1980s

really change your life in the 1980s

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:58.110 
really change your life in the 1980s
when<00:04:56.979> you<00:04:57.069> were<00:04:57.160> involved<00:04:57.430> in<00:04:57.699> this<00:04:57.880> oh

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:58.120 
when you were involved in this oh

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.540 
when you were involved in this oh
absolutely<00:04:59.020> it<00:04:59.650> changed<00:04:59.949> my<00:05:00.069> spirituality

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:00.550 
absolutely it changed my spirituality

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:03.330 
absolutely it changed my spirituality
and<00:05:00.970> my<00:05:01.180> I<00:05:01.780> always<00:05:02.380> had<00:05:02.590> this<00:05:02.710> idea<00:05:02.860> because<00:05:03.250> I

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:03.340 
and my I always had this idea because I

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:06.960 
and my I always had this idea because I
went<00:05:04.090> to<00:05:04.210> a<00:05:04.240> real<00:05:04.710> conservative<00:05:05.710> Church<00:05:05.979> and<00:05:06.310> I

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:06.970 
went to a real conservative Church and I

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:09.480 
went to a real conservative Church and I
was<00:05:07.330> really<00:05:07.569> hard<00:05:07.690> to<00:05:07.750> swallow<00:05:08.050> what<00:05:08.620> the<00:05:08.800> what

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:09.490 
was really hard to swallow what the what

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:11.879 
was really hard to swallow what the what
the<00:05:09.520> father<00:05:09.849> the<00:05:10.330> Reverend<00:05:11.139> had<00:05:11.229> to<00:05:11.349> say<00:05:11.560> and<00:05:11.830> I

00:05:11.879 --> 00:05:11.889 
the father the Reverend had to say and I

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:12.930 
the father the Reverend had to say and I
thought<00:05:12.069> it<00:05:12.220> just<00:05:12.430> got<00:05:12.550> to<00:05:12.669> be<00:05:12.729> something

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:12.940 
thought it just got to be something

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:14.700 
thought it just got to be something
something's<00:05:13.539> wrong<00:05:13.780> here<00:05:14.110> this<00:05:14.289> can<00:05:14.440> be<00:05:14.500> all

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:14.710 
something's wrong here this can be all

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:17.159 
something's wrong here this can be all
there<00:05:14.830> is<00:05:14.919> to<00:05:15.069> life<00:05:15.099> and<00:05:15.630> when<00:05:16.630> I<00:05:16.660> finally<00:05:16.960> had

00:05:17.159 --> 00:05:17.169 
there is to life and when I finally had

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:20.010 
there is to life and when I finally had
my<00:05:17.289> assignment<00:05:17.860> it<00:05:17.949> was<00:05:18.039> like<00:05:18.220> okay<00:05:18.880> now<00:05:19.810> we're

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:20.020 
my assignment it was like okay now we're

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:21.200 
my assignment it was like okay now we're
getting<00:05:20.110> somewhere

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:21.210 
getting somewhere

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:23.790 
getting somewhere
unbeknownst<00:05:22.210> to<00:05:22.270> them<00:05:22.720> you<00:05:22.960> were<00:05:23.050> actually<00:05:23.289> a

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:23.800 
unbeknownst to them you were actually a

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.939 
unbeknownst to them you were actually a
UFO<00:05:24.479> aficionado<00:05:25.479> in<00:05:25.900> some<00:05:26.169> ways<00:05:26.349> during<00:05:26.680> those

00:05:26.939 --> 00:05:26.949 
UFO aficionado in some ways during those

00:05:26.949 --> 00:05:30.689 
UFO aficionado in some ways during those
days<00:05:27.190> oh<00:05:27.520> I<00:05:28.180> was<00:05:28.570> in<00:05:29.500> my<00:05:29.620> teens<00:05:29.889> I<00:05:30.190> was

00:05:30.689 --> 00:05:30.699 
days oh I was in my teens I was

00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:33.120 
days oh I was in my teens I was
interested<00:05:31.090> interested<00:05:31.720> in<00:05:32.139> and<00:05:32.410> read<00:05:32.979> as

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:33.130 
interested interested in and read as

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:36.330 
interested interested in and read as
much<00:05:33.340> as<00:05:33.460> I<00:05:33.550> could<00:05:33.789> and<00:05:34.440> yeah<00:05:35.440> definitely<00:05:36.160> just

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:36.340 
much as I could and yeah definitely just

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:38.580 
much as I could and yeah definitely just
a<00:05:36.490> long<00:05:36.759> time<00:05:37.090> before<00:05:37.270> and<00:05:37.900> can<00:05:38.320> you<00:05:38.409> say

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:38.590 
a long time before and can you say

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:41.610 
a long time before and can you say
something<00:05:38.889> about<00:05:39.220> how<00:05:39.820> you<00:05:40.449> were<00:05:40.750> told<00:05:41.020> or<00:05:41.409> how

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:41.620 
something about how you were told or how

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:44.129 
something about how you were told or how
the<00:05:41.680> documentation<00:05:42.610> told<00:05:42.909> you<00:05:43.120> that<00:05:43.780> we<00:05:44.020> were

00:05:44.129 --> 00:05:44.139 
the documentation told you that we were

00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:47.430 
the documentation told you that we were
engineered<00:05:44.800> there<00:05:45.639> was<00:05:45.819> words<00:05:46.150> like<00:05:46.780> created

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:47.440 
engineered there was words like created

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:50.249 
engineered there was words like created
now<00:05:47.680> given<00:05:48.669> our<00:05:48.759> science<00:05:49.240> I<00:05:49.509> think<00:05:49.599> those<00:05:50.080> two

00:05:50.249 --> 00:05:50.259 
now given our science I think those two

00:05:50.259 --> 00:05:53.129 
now given our science I think those two
kids<00:05:50.560> equate<00:05:51.370> to<00:05:51.400> one<00:05:51.669> another<00:05:51.940> did<00:05:52.780> you<00:05:52.960> know

00:05:53.129 --> 00:05:53.139 
kids equate to one another did you know

00:05:53.139 --> 00:05:55.770 
kids equate to one another did you know
who<00:05:53.320> was<00:05:53.349> writing<00:05:53.979> the<00:05:54.099> documentation<00:05:54.729> it<00:05:55.599> was

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:55.780 
who was writing the documentation it was

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:58.770 
who was writing the documentation it was
a<00:05:55.810> combination<00:05:56.349> of<00:05:56.919> stuff<00:05:57.370> that<00:05:57.580> was<00:05:57.780> relayed

00:05:58.770 --> 00:05:58.780 
a combination of stuff that was relayed

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:01.320 
a combination of stuff that was relayed
to<00:05:58.810> us<00:05:58.990> by<00:05:59.349> the<00:05:59.409> greys<00:05:59.710> and<00:06:00.099> other<00:06:00.970> stuff<00:06:01.300> that

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:01.330 
to us by the greys and other stuff that

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:03.420 
to us by the greys and other stuff that
was<00:06:01.539> written<00:06:01.690> by<00:06:01.900> scientists<00:06:02.590> I<00:06:02.710> would<00:06:03.219> guess

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:03.430 
was written by scientists I would guess

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:05.070 
was written by scientists I would guess
employed<00:06:03.789> by<00:06:03.940> the<00:06:04.000> government<00:06:04.449> and<00:06:04.570> signed<00:06:04.900> by
