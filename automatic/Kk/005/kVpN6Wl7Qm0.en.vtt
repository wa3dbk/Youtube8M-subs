well is is the context in the history of
the<00:05:21.840> architectural<00:05:22.880> legacy<00:05:23.880> there<00:05:24.450> is<00:05:24.870> very

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:25.740 
the architectural legacy there is very

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:28.940 
the architectural legacy there is very
very<00:05:26.010> strong<00:05:26.400> this<00:05:26.670> great<00:05:27.680> architecture<00:05:28.680> and

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:28.950 
very strong this great architecture and

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:31.970 
very strong this great architecture and
design<00:05:29.180> that<00:05:30.180> has<00:05:30.450> been<00:05:30.690> present<00:05:31.140> generation

design that has been present generation
after<00:05:32.130> generation<00:05:32.780> so<00:05:33.780> any<00:05:33.990> approach<00:05:34.440> I<00:05:34.680> think

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:34.710 
after generation so any approach I think

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:39.080 
after generation so any approach I think
to<00:05:35.580> really<00:05:36.540> try<00:05:36.810> to<00:05:36.870> value<00:05:37.460> the<00:05:38.460> existing

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:39.090

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:40.830 
buildings that are there look for every

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:43.910 
buildings that are there look for every
way<00:05:41.000> to<00:05:42.000> try<00:05:42.210> to<00:05:42.240> save<00:05:42.570> and<00:05:42.900> preserve<00:05:43.110> them<00:05:43.590> and

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:43.920 
way to try to save and preserve them and

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:46.610 
way to try to save and preserve them and
weave<00:05:44.160> them<00:05:44.460> into<00:05:44.940> the<00:05:45.570> development<00:05:46.260> I<00:05:46.350> don't

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:46.620 
weave them into the development I don't

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:52.670 
weave them into the development I don't
think<00:05:46.800> that<00:05:46.950> means<00:05:47.270> being<00:05:49.100> sort<00:05:50.100> of<00:05:51.680> nostalgic

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:52.680 
think that means being sort of nostalgic

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:56.750 
think that means being sort of nostalgic
or<00:05:54.380> recreating<00:05:55.380> the<00:05:55.860> same<00:05:56.040> architectural

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:56.760 
or recreating the same architectural

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:58.490 
or recreating the same architectural

00:05:58.490 --> 00:05:58.500 
style over and over the other thing I

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:03.070 
style over and over the other thing I
think<00:05:58.590> that's<00:05:58.890> this<00:05:59.270> absolutely<00:06:00.270> critical<00:06:00.900> is

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:03.080 
think that's this absolutely critical is

I think the need for a job strategy of

I think the need for a job strategy of
