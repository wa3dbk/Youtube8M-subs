 could shoot in 1080p with 60 images 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.780
 per second whereas before we did not

 interesting moments in your sequence

 during post production in order to better 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.979
 understand what it is I invite you to 

00:01:56.689 --> 00:01:58.790
 click on the small image that 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:00.830
 appears on the screen 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:02.930
 finally the hero gopro is yielded will you 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.250

 interesting sequences this is going you 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:09.800
 facilitate post production work 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:12.050
 this compo will be available on 12 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.040
 July and the price is still unclear in 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.390
 effect we just know that america 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.310
 was going to propose around 200 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.080
 dollars in my opinion if you have a 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.610
 waffle to the hero this makes only a few 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.800
 time you have it then nothing serves 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.000
 to change to go to this one there 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.380
 better get used to it and 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.700
 perfectly control your camera 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:27.650
 before thinking about changing it 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.230
 but if you have a waffle 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:32.060
 to the hero 3 or 3 + wade edition then the 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.459
 gopro hero plus lcd can you be 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.080
 helpful why am I telling you this and fine if 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:37.640
 you buy the white edition where the aero 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.440
 you start in the field 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.269
 of the video is so nothing serves 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.280
 to have something too pushed from the beginning 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:44.870
 if you have a waffle at 03 or 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.220
 three plus white edition normally 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.510
 it's been a while since you've got it 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.160
 and so you are already a little bit 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.480
 less beginners and you will appreciate 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.609
 all the more the best abilities 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.230
 that offers the hero more gopro to yield 

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:55.730
 that's all for the presentation of 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.350
 this camera I hope you liked it 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.760

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:59.900
