00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
a little bit oily looking especially if

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.660

powder<00:02:02.610> that<00:02:03.090> it<00:02:03.329> comes<00:02:03.600> with<00:02:04.250> it<00:02:05.250> turns<00:02:05.729> it

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
powder that it comes with it turns it

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.540 
powder that it comes with it turns it
into<00:02:06.240> like<00:02:06.600> a<00:02:06.810> matte<00:02:07.439> finish<00:02:07.710> and<00:02:08.099> I<00:02:08.190> can<00:02:08.369> wear

the poor top we will tend to pour out

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.070

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
really don't like about this foundation

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.770 
really don't like about this foundation
is<00:02:34.680> that<00:02:34.710> you<00:02:35.550> can't<00:02:35.850> try<00:02:36.150> all<00:02:36.330> in<00:02:36.420> the<00:02:36.510> shades

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
is that you can't try all in the shades

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.290 
is that you can't try all in the shades
most<00:02:37.470> drugstore<00:02:37.950> foundations<00:02:38.520> it's<00:02:38.730> hard<00:02:39.090> to

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
most drugstore foundations it's hard to

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.200 
most drugstore foundations it's hard to
find<00:02:39.570> your<00:02:39.780> match<00:02:40.020> because<00:02:40.500> you<00:02:40.910> can't<00:02:41.910> really

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:42.210 
find your match because you can't really

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:44.600 
find your match because you can't really
get<00:02:42.450> hands-on<00:02:42.870> with<00:02:43.350> it<00:02:43.560> so<00:02:43.950> you<00:02:44.010> just<00:02:44.130> have<00:02:44.340> to

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
get hands-on with it so you just have to

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.920 
get hands-on with it so you just have to
kind<00:02:44.880> of<00:02:45.000> go<00:02:45.180> about<00:02:45.330> searching<00:02:46.230> on<00:02:47.190> videos

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
kind of go about searching on videos

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.990 
kind of go about searching on videos
bring<00:02:48.930> it<00:02:49.110> home<00:02:49.320> and<00:02:49.650> if<00:02:50.400> the<00:02:50.520> store<00:02:50.760> allow<00:02:50.940> you

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
bring it home and if the store allow you

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.610 
bring it home and if the store allow you
to<00:02:51.210> bring<00:02:51.330> it<00:02:51.480> back<00:02:51.630> if<00:02:51.780> it<00:02:51.900> don't<00:02:52.050> match<00:02:52.290> so

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
to bring it back if it don't match so

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.740 
to bring it back if it don't match so
yeah<00:02:53.280> other<00:02:53.790> than<00:02:53.880> that<00:02:54.060> I<00:02:54.180> think<00:02:54.480> this<00:02:54.600> is<00:02:54.720> a

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
yeah other than that I think this is a

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.720 
yeah other than that I think this is a
really<00:02:55.140> great<00:02:55.380> foundation<00:02:55.650> for<00:02:56.070> anyone<00:02:56.550> who

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
really great foundation for anyone who

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.070 
really great foundation for anyone who
likes<00:02:57.030> a<00:02:57.300> glow<00:02:58.290> or<00:02:58.760> who<00:02:59.760> likes<00:03:00.030> the<00:03:00.480> dewy<00:03:00.720> look

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
likes a glow or who likes the dewy look

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.410 
likes a glow or who likes the dewy look
and<00:03:01.830> if<00:03:02.250> you<00:03:02.340> don't<00:03:02.610> like<00:03:02.760> to<00:03:02.880> do<00:03:03.030> it<00:03:03.150> look<00:03:03.300> you

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
and if you don't like to do it look you

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.140 
and if you don't like to do it look you
can<00:03:03.600> pay<00:03:03.860> about<00:03:04.860> nine<00:03:05.160> dollars<00:03:05.610> for<00:03:05.640> this<00:03:05.880> and

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
can pay about nine dollars for this and

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.510 
can pay about nine dollars for this and
then<00:03:06.420> I<00:03:06.660> think<00:03:06.990> twelve<00:03:07.350> dollars<00:03:08.220> for<00:03:08.460> the

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:08.520 
then I think twelve dollars for the

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:09.980 
then I think twelve dollars for the
powder<00:03:08.730> and<00:03:09.030> you<00:03:09.090> can<00:03:09.240> set<00:03:09.510> it<00:03:09.630> and<00:03:09.750> make<00:03:09.960> it

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:09.990 
powder and you can set it and make it

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:12.050 
powder and you can set it and make it
more<00:03:10.410> of<00:03:10.710> okay<00:03:11.250> so<00:03:11.400> now<00:03:11.670> I'm<00:03:11.760> going<00:03:11.880> to<00:03:11.940> be

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.500 
start with the pros that I removed like
about<00:03:31.020> this<00:03:31.170> foundation<00:03:31.880> for<00:03:32.880> one<00:03:33.090> I<00:03:33.120> like

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
about this foundation for one I like

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:35.240 
about this foundation for one I like
that<00:03:33.780> this<00:03:33.959> foundation<00:03:34.140> does<00:03:34.530> come<00:03:34.980> with<00:03:35.100> the

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
that this foundation does come with the

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.190 
that this foundation does come with the
pump<00:03:35.550> unlike<00:03:35.820> the<00:03:36.000> nearly<00:03:36.360> naked<00:03:36.600> foundation

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
pump unlike the nearly naked foundation

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.110 
pump unlike the nearly naked foundation
my<00:03:37.290> Revlon<00:03:37.680> so<00:03:37.890> it<00:03:38.010> makes<00:03:38.190> it<00:03:38.310> more<00:03:38.580> easier<00:03:39.030> to

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
my Revlon so it makes it more easier to

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.259 
my Revlon so it makes it more easier to
use<00:03:39.390> and<00:03:39.630> you<00:03:39.750> waste<00:03:39.989> less<00:03:40.320> product<00:03:41.239> the<00:03:42.239> other

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
use and you waste less product the other

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:44.060 
use and you waste less product the other
thing<00:03:42.570> I<00:03:42.660> like<00:03:42.900> how<00:03:43.200> much<00:03:43.410> easier<00:03:43.739> to<00:03:43.860> find

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:44.070 
thing I like how much easier to find

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:45.800 
thing I like how much easier to find
onto<00:03:44.400> my<00:03:44.550> match<00:03:44.760> with<00:03:44.790> this<00:03:45.120> foundation<00:03:45.660> and

nearly naked where I had to like really

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.820 
nearly naked where I had to like really

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
match but not a perfect match this

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.140 
match but not a perfect match this
foundation<00:03:58.860> does<00:03:58.890> give<00:03:59.310> you<00:03:59.489> a<00:03:59.519> really<00:03:59.670> great

gonna find that this foundation works
really<00:04:06.600> well<00:04:06.900> because<00:04:07.709> it<00:04:08.040> gives<00:04:08.220> off<00:04:08.430> of<00:04:08.640> a

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 
really well because it gives off of a

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:10.759 
really well because it gives off of a
matte<00:04:08.940> finish<00:04:09.239> it's<00:04:09.959> like<00:04:10.230> a<00:04:10.410> liquid

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:10.769 
matte finish it's like a liquid

bottle this foundation does cost about
thirty<00:04:16.019> five<00:04:16.290> dollars<00:04:16.830> I<00:04:16.980> believe

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:17.420 
thirty five dollars I believe

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:19.849 
thirty five dollars I believe
35/36<00:04:18.420> I'm<00:04:18.540> not<00:04:18.690> sure<00:04:18.930> exactly<00:04:19.350> the<00:04:19.680> amount

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
35/36 I'm not sure exactly the amount

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:21.800 
35/36 I'm not sure exactly the amount
but<00:04:20.040> it's<00:04:20.160> in<00:04:20.250> the<00:04:20.310> 30s<00:04:20.519> if<00:04:21.269> you<00:04:21.359> pay<00:04:21.510> for<00:04:21.570> the

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
but it's in the 30s if you pay for the

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:23.840 
but it's in the 30s if you pay for the
wraparound<00:04:22.079> nearly<00:04:22.470> Nikki<00:04:22.650> and<00:04:22.980> the<00:04:23.190> powder

go<00:04:24.240> with<00:04:24.420> it<00:04:24.630> you'll<00:04:24.780> probably<00:04:24.960> pay<00:04:25.380> about<00:04:25.669> $27

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:26.669
