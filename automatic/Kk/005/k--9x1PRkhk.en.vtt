00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 Hello guys with you creative and today 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.830
 monday hard day accordingly 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:09.269
 after a wild stormy weekend in my head 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:11.460
 a bunch of everything was laid 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.099
 something useful something not very 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.960
 exactly useful i wanted today 

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:18.210
 share with you because in a week 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.920
 Cooper accumulates in my head just 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.199
 crazy amount of information 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.210
 percent 70 of it is just useless 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.789
 but nevertheless you are piling up a bunch 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.890
 questions I have accumulated a bunch of answers and 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.619
 I just miss two hands 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.899
 to answer all these questions cleanly 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.570
 physically they don't have time yes to them 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:39.629
 actually if I answer every 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:42.360
 a day for every question i will your pricing 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:45.170
 I probably do not know sleep, only with closer 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:48.450
 by morning this is part of a half 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:50.399
 so today is super super serious 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.289
 prepared as usual I have 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.539
 a brilliant flyer on which 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.699
 Actually I will read the whole thing 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.370
 The first topic with which we will begin probably 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:02.039
 it 's still a milestone of 7,000 subscribers 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.439
 which we recently overcome I certainly 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:07.380
 I will not do any super 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:09.570
 celebrations for every thousand because 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.100
 probably with 20 I already completely out 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.650
 everybody's out of my imagination and 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.320
 Actually there is no need to do on 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.299
 every thousand some super 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:21.090
 congratulations you know that i am each of 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:24.420
 I strongly appreciate each subscriber on weight 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.970
 gold and I we just just appreciate what 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.829
 you do when the figure is seven thousand 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.810
 the city's subscribers rang on my 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.610
 the channel on youtube and I was at that 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:36.030
 time is far from civilization in its 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:38.340
 personal affairs and there was no computer 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.979
 They were nothing like some 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:44.220
 no internet for which accounted for 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:46.290
 here and so pull up the phone in 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.290
 heaven to catch at least some 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.899
 signal so i looked i was glad 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:55.460
 but to me this way to note 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:57.120
 I could not but pour beer in the evening 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:00.300
 here 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:02.640
 and about fifa street 3 street which 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:05.370
 you liked a very strong 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:08.610
 be sure then I'll write down my nerves today 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:11.370
 Today I will write down a couple of career parts 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.890
 I will issue two issues each 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.740
 probably a week actually but when i 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:19.530
 came here i found wild for myself 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:22.650
 wild misfortune broke in my 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:25.020
 favorite headphones right hand therefore 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.010
 I now have to drive off and so on 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.320
 deeds well 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:31.110
 I will go to choose a new one probably not if 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:33.030
 I will not find anything normal buy alla 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:36.060
 again the same again and not break 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:38.670
 Six months later I'm going to buy again 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:42.120
 the third couple these will go in the trash they 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:44.490
 served their reason why I was unlikely 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.770
 I will do super super cool 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:50.480
 headphones which is very unlikely because I 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:54.350
 very greedy about the rest of ritos 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:57.150
 good courses that's all and the other I 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:03:00.090
 I will definitely write under you noticed that 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.620
 the last three days just a video came out 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.260
 in small quantities because I don't 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:07.020
 It was in place I put them as 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:10.800
 planned so they were released 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:12.750
 without my participation so i write down 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:15.030
 last days could not because simply 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:17.459
 simply was not here for this box 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:19.800
 actually friends on my list 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:21.800
 I will end up with more so far 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:24.959
 thoughts are not enough because more 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:27.060
 deep morning and thoughts are not particularly 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:29.100
 formed but I need to be now 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:31.140
 from traveling on business but more likely 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:34.440
 time to write this podcast will not be me 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:36.870
 I hope I brought it all to everyone for everything 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:38.760
 I wanted to like friends I 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.650
 each separately thanks to some 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.180
 way shows life on our channel 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:44.550
 who stand huge thumbs up then 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.650
 helps me to go for the goal 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:48.269
 who subscribes to the channel who 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:50.760
 watching videos somehow them 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:52.470
 comments on the support of his own life 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.620
 I really appreciate it 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:58.140
 thank you everyone huge in general 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:00.269
 Persians black water today will be recorded 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:02.820
 more than that though i have wild here 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:06.510
 backlight will i don't know i'm in 

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:10.260
 Paradise is still very cloudy outside the window I 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:13.380
 for shutting up the windows by going through the cliffs black 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:14.820
 water then probably figure it out and everything 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:17.400
 I'll write down the part too 

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:20.310
 in fact everything will all go out in volume 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:22.740
 same rhythm that exactly the previous one 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:24.720
 week he except weekends i'm still 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:27.180
 once I say thank you all and 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:29.280
 Finally, I would like to sit on 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.570
 shell helped me dial a little 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.710
 many fingers up 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:33.710
 conch shell
