00:00:24.829 --> 00:00:30.509
 she is resting and there is a little tutorial on the euros envelopes the time when the 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:33.270
 rule refusing to stop 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.660
 so think about his elderly mother but he believes 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.219
 m 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:46.390
 the user experience the finance board 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:51.440
 the next day they voted for a long time in the real world no one 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:56.370
 did not want to launch a new method the usa issued an opinion on 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:57.070
 all 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:01.940
 a better sound so we will return to the track thousands and we already say 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.120
 but for philippe delusinne cnt 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:08.650
 great unconscious music 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.320
 here you have warned lievremont 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.840
 to offer what will interest us the elected 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:30.040
 alger and in the 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:31.950
 read our guide 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.550
 so we will press this point 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:35.070
 they too encompass 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.760
 and if I am directly offered three years blog directly 20% of ecms subsidiary 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.310
 in the public she who is the author he said 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:51.570
 so far madrid 5 if you do not have it to have the comic triumphant 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.300
 here 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:57.890
 if it means 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.890
 to this method is not the right one 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.650
 I see nothing 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:08.519
 Noah 

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:10.669
 here is the desert 

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:14.019
 so I'm going to visit a region 

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:15.409
 Thursday 

00:02:15.409 --> 00:02:18.409
 did you react when 

00:02:19.109 --> 00:02:23.819
 moratti related to the world of u20 by pressing on the spot and if you see that 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:25.419
 you were going to 

00:02:25.419 --> 00:02:28.809
 a drawing point much better illizi 

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:30.239
 much more accurate 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:33.239
 here are the scenes 

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:48.469
 yes the room was guaranteed a bit strange and weird on the territory 

00:02:48.469 --> 00:02:52.389
 ousted en bloc but suddenly it returns to 0 so we will evolve tomorrow 

00:02:52.929 --> 00:02:55.319
 already several years 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:58.359
 you have to designate the laureates will devolve% this file 

00:03:00.039 --> 00:03:03.039
 belleville we find him and himself 

00:03:06.249 --> 00:03:09.369
 that's apart from any change in volume 

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:28.129
 for that the boss of the blue line the ancient way he went to confession 

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:34.439
 it will provide direct access to levallois him in the world the right 

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:38.529
 we could draw something 

00:03:38.529 --> 00:03:41.529
 like that 

00:03:42.679 --> 00:03:47.779
 here are the activists the left to the right the other 

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:03.980
 1 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:08.510
 eve title cancel my humble opinion the pacers have apparently valid 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:12.310
 as a look-alike and he intends to use in the mixer that's how we had 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:16.289
 direct access to strikes to volumes only to panoramic 

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:18.469
 if I have to say 

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:24.399
 the world is mobilized also rejected the request is not all 

00:04:24.399 --> 00:04:26.270
 settings 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:27.659
 nexus 

00:04:27.659 --> 00:04:30.659
 that we will reappear if at times 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:32.789
 here 

00:04:32.789 --> 00:04:35.789
 so for example 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:41.180
 but happiness 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:43.099
 note 6 

00:04:43.099 --> 00:04:45.789
 at the same time 

00:04:45.789 --> 00:04:48.409
 here 

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:51.409
 and we had to play and if we want 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:54.759
 hoots 

00:04:54.759 --> 00:04:57.759
 this is for example 

00:04:58.279 --> 00:05:00.589
 the top 

00:05:00.589 --> 00:05:03.909
 she read but 

00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:06.909
 he is free 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:11.500
 here you are told 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:14.500
 you will see their army 

00:05:27.499 --> 00:05:30.499
 so I can do the same thing with other parameters 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.680
 here is the lake at metz 

00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:41.469
 the goal is simple 

00:05:44.339 --> 00:05:47.339
 army and police 

00:06:01.419 --> 00:06:06.500
 so that's all the settings will be them real buzz too its envelope 

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:12.110
 and then get more details from Highway 10 here several newspapers 

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:15.740
 so that's very handy he explains how his 32 elected 

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:17.939
 morning thursday 

00:06:17.939 --> 00:06:19.650
 obama london 

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:21.210
 for example 

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:24.210
 good 

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:26.029
 annie measure 

00:06:26.029 --> 00:06:27.610
 so we double 

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:29.449
 the solution 

00:06:29.449 --> 00:06:31.879
 measured 

00:06:31.879 --> 00:06:34.949
 that's like a lookalike 

00:06:34.949 --> 00:06:35.960
 disunited 

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:37.230
 m here 

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:40.009
 then during the month of December 

00:06:40.009 --> 00:06:42.289
 I do not know what happens to him the day 

00:06:42.289 --> 00:06:45.289
 yes but here 

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:48.210
 in these difficult times 

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:50.189
 this part 

00:06:50.189 --> 00:06:53.189
 that's antic right 

00:06:54.469 --> 00:06:56.189
 how to say 

00:06:56.189 --> 00:06:57.550
 here 

00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:00.550
 we position ourselves 

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:02.729
 right here 

00:07:02.729 --> 00:07:04.960
 in 2003 

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:05.999
 cholet 

00:07:05.999 --> 00:07:09.479
 and so if we want to evolve then what's the use then certainly we can 

00:07:09.479 --> 00:07:12.479
 call it small modifications 

00:07:14.369 --> 00:07:17.719
 these mainly targeted 

00:07:18.879 --> 00:07:21.879
 tomorrow 

00:07:22.539 --> 00:07:24.569
 which will allow Montpellier 

00:07:24.569 --> 00:07:27.229
 once with this English of the fourth measure 

00:07:27.229 --> 00:07:29.889
 she was cold 

00:07:29.889 --> 00:07:32.010
 the guide will not be relayed 

00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:33.560
 we will have an envelope 

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:36.319
 difference 

00:07:36.319 --> 00:07:39.319
 here I am going to air 

00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:42.930
 when it's necessary 

00:07:58.550 --> 00:08:01.629
 this is hypnosis 1% in the euro zone 

00:08:02.179 --> 00:08:06.990
 according to the newspaper, it's called in the summer and nothing else tells us 

00:08:06.990 --> 00:08:08.230
 friendly didier
