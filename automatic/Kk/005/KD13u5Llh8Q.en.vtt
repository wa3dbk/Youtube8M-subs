actually playing okay let's start off by
just<00:02:24.060> plucking<00:02:24.600> our<00:02:24.720> E<00:02:24.840> string

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:26.960 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:30.560 

and<00:02:27.960> I<00:02:28.260> could<00:02:28.410> see<00:02:28.560> on<00:02:28.710> my<00:02:28.830> tuner<00:02:29.100> up<00:02:30.090> here<00:02:30.480> in

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
the right-hand corner that has shown me

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.900 
the right-hand corner that has shown me
that<00:02:32.400> that's<00:02:32.730> an<00:02:32.850> a<00:02:33.060> note<00:02:33.950> but<00:02:34.950> the<00:02:35.220> needle

that that's an a note but the needle
indicator<00:02:36.360> if<00:02:36.990> you<00:02:37.200> see<00:02:37.410> it<00:02:37.560> right<00:02:37.740> over<00:02:37.920> here

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
indicator if you see it right over here

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.750 
indicator if you see it right over here
it's<00:02:38.700> to<00:02:39.000> the<00:02:39.120> right<00:02:39.680> now<00:02:40.680> when<00:02:40.890> on<00:02:41.100> a<00:02:41.160> tuner

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
it's to the right now when on a tuner

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.370 
it's to the right now when on a tuner
like<00:02:42.000> this<00:02:42.300> that<00:02:42.600> means<00:02:42.750> that<00:02:42.900> our<00:02:43.110> note<00:02:43.230> is

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
like this that means that our note is

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.200 
like this that means that our note is
sharp<00:02:43.410> and<00:02:43.980> it<00:02:44.100> needs<00:02:44.310> to<00:02:44.460> come<00:02:44.670> back<00:02:44.850> down<00:02:45.150> a

sharp and it needs to come back down a

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:48.320 
sharp and it needs to come back down a
little<00:02:45.630> bit<00:02:45.900> to<00:02:46.530> be<00:02:46.650> in<00:02:46.770> tune<00:02:47.040> so<00:02:47.700> I'm<00:02:48.210> gonna

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
little bit to be in tune so I'm gonna

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.410 
little bit to be in tune so I'm gonna
hit<00:02:48.480> the<00:02:48.600> string<00:02:48.870> again<00:02:49.020> and<00:02:49.940> take<00:02:50.940> the<00:02:51.090> tuning

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
hit the string again and take the tuning

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.410 
hit the string again and take the tuning
peg<00:02:51.600> and<00:02:51.810> crank<00:02:52.050> it<00:02:52.140> down<00:02:52.320> a<00:02:52.350> bit<00:02:53.420> keep

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
peg and crank it down a bit keep

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.030 
peg and crank it down a bit keep
plucking<00:02:54.630> the<00:02:54.840> string<00:02:55.140> so<00:02:55.710> you<00:02:55.770> can<00:02:55.890> tell

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
plucking the string so you can tell

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.700 
plucking the string so you can tell
where<00:02:56.160> you<00:02:56.250> are<00:02:56.510> and<00:02:57.510> you'll<00:02:57.660> notice<00:02:57.870> this<00:02:58.140> the

00:02:58.700 --> 00:02:58.710 
where you are and you'll notice this the

where you are and you'll notice this the
needle<00:02:59.100> is<00:02:59.250> moving<00:02:59.280> towards<00:02:59.940> the<00:03:00.090> middle<00:03:00.390> and

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:02.960 

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:05.570 

on<00:03:03.960> this<00:03:04.110> particular<00:03:04.290> tuner<00:03:04.890> when<00:03:05.160> the<00:03:05.280> guitar

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
on this particular tuner when the guitar

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.490 
on this particular tuner when the guitar
is<00:03:05.670> in<00:03:05.700> tune<00:03:05.850> the<00:03:06.750> needle<00:03:07.020> will<00:03:07.110> be<00:03:07.140> right<00:03:07.470> in

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
is in tune the needle will be right in

is in tune the needle will be right in
the<00:03:07.710> middle<00:03:07.860> and<00:03:08.390> there<00:03:09.390> will<00:03:09.480> be<00:03:09.510> a<00:03:09.630> green

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
the middle and there will be a green

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:15.290 
the middle and there will be a green
light<00:03:10.260> that<00:03:10.710> appears<00:03:12.530> just<00:03:13.530> like<00:03:13.680> that<00:03:14.300> so

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 
light that appears just like that so

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:16.760 
light that appears just like that so
let's<00:03:15.450> go<00:03:15.600> to<00:03:15.660> the<00:03:15.870> next<00:03:15.990> string<00:03:16.380> our<00:03:16.530> a<00:03:16.560> string

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:16.770 
let's go to the next string our a string

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:19.920 
let's go to the next string our a string
hit<00:03:17.730> that<00:03:17.910> string

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
hit that string

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.330 
hit that string
okay<00:03:20.930> on<00:03:21.050> this<00:03:21.200> particular<00:03:21.710> string<00:03:22.040> the

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
okay on this particular string the

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.120 
okay on this particular string the
needle<00:03:22.610> is<00:03:22.760> way<00:03:22.970> off<00:03:23.000> to<00:03:23.360> the<00:03:23.390> left<00:03:23.830> but<00:03:24.830> it

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
needle is way off to the left but it

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:27.100 
needle is way off to the left but it
does<00:03:25.430> say<00:03:25.670> that<00:03:25.700> we<00:03:26.000> have<00:03:26.210> an<00:03:26.330> a<00:03:26.480> note<00:03:26.870> right

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810 
here so that's good because that string

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:32.350 
here so that's good because that string
should<00:03:29.960> be<00:03:30.020> an<00:03:30.200> a<00:03:30.520> so<00:03:31.520> what<00:03:31.670> we're<00:03:31.760> gonna<00:03:31.820> do<00:03:32.090> is

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:32.360 
should be an a so what we're gonna do is

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.510 
should be an a so what we're gonna do is
come<00:03:32.870> crank<00:03:33.170> our<00:03:33.290> tuning<00:03:33.590> peg<00:03:33.800> for<00:03:34.250> our<00:03:34.370> a

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:34.520 
come crank our tuning peg for our a

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:37.900 
come crank our tuning peg for our a
string<00:03:34.880> up<00:03:36.040> until<00:03:37.040> the<00:03:37.130> needle<00:03:37.280> moves<00:03:37.580> to<00:03:37.820> the

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:37.910 
string up until the needle moves to the

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:44.979 
string up until the needle moves to the
middle

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:44.989 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:47.240 

so<00:03:45.989> that's<00:03:46.170> good<00:03:46.409> right<00:03:46.560> there<00:03:46.590> and<00:03:47.069> let<00:03:47.159> me

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.250 
the neighborhood's going to come all the
way<00:03:53.069> back<00:03:53.159> over<00:03:53.519> to<00:03:53.609> the<00:03:53.700> right<00:03:53.939> and<00:03:54.299> we<00:03:55.140> need

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
way back over to the right and we need

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.619 
way back over to the right and we need
to<00:03:55.379> move<00:03:55.560> it<00:03:55.680> back<00:03:55.980> down<00:03:56.459> to<00:03:57.299> where<00:03:57.420> it's<00:03:57.540> in

00:03:57.619 --> 00:03:57.629 
to move it back down to where it's in

00:03:57.629 --> 00:04:05.680 
to move it back down to where it's in
the<00:03:57.719> center

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:05.690 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:08.020 

so<00:04:06.680> there<00:04:06.830> you<00:04:06.920> go<00:04:07.100> you're<00:04:07.310> a<00:04:07.340> strings<00:04:07.730> into

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030 
so there you go you're a strings into

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:12.460 
so there you go you're a strings into
now<00:04:08.240> let's<00:04:08.540> go<00:04:08.690> to<00:04:08.750> the<00:04:08.990> de

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:12.470 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:15.250 

we<00:04:12.920> see<00:04:13.070> this<00:04:13.220> one's<00:04:13.400> a<00:04:13.460> little<00:04:13.610> bit<00:04:13.820> sharp<00:04:14.260> it

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:15.260 
we see this one's a little bit sharp it

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.259 
we see this one's a little bit sharp it
is<00:04:15.320> a<00:04:15.500> denote<00:04:16.010> that's<00:04:16.550> good<00:04:16.880> because<00:04:17.000> that's

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:17.269 
is a denote that's good because that's

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:19.120 
is a denote that's good because that's
our<00:04:17.360> D<00:04:17.510> string<00:04:17.680> so<00:04:18.680> we're<00:04:18.800> gonna<00:04:18.890> come<00:04:19.100> down

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.130 
our D string so we're gonna come down

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:27.370 
our D string so we're gonna come down
just<00:04:19.550> a<00:04:19.700> bit

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:27.380 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:30.409 

okay<00:04:28.380> that<00:04:28.560> one's<00:04:28.710> good<00:04:28.949> to<00:04:29.040> go<00:04:29.460> next<00:04:30.240> to<00:04:30.330> the

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:30.419 
okay that one's good to go next to the

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:33.760 
okay that one's good to go next to the
g-string

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:33.770 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:36.040 

and<00:04:34.250> this<00:04:34.460> one's<00:04:34.639> almost<00:04:34.910> in<00:04:35.270> tune<00:04:35.509> it<00:04:35.810> is

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.050 
and this one's almost in tune it is

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:38.589 
and this one's almost in tune it is
indeed<00:04:36.440> a<00:04:36.470> G<00:04:36.860> so<00:04:37.759> we<00:04:37.819> just<00:04:37.910> need<00:04:38.090> to<00:04:38.150> come<00:04:38.330> up<00:04:38.449> a

00:04:38.589 --> 00:04:38.599 
indeed a G so we just need to come up a

00:04:38.599 --> 00:04:49.090 
indeed a G so we just need to come up a
little<00:04:38.660> bit<00:04:39.169> it's<00:04:39.650> a<00:04:39.680> little<00:04:39.919> bit<00:04:40.039> flat

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:49.100 

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:52.070 

okay<00:04:50.100> that's<00:04:50.310> good<00:04:50.580> now<00:04:51.210> go<00:04:51.360> to<00:04:51.419> our<00:04:51.540> b-string

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 
okay that's good now go to our b-string

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.879 
okay that's good now go to our b-string
our<00:04:52.470> second<00:04:52.860> string<00:04:53.100> hit<00:04:53.820> that<00:04:54.620> that's<00:04:55.620> way

00:04:55.879 --> 00:04:55.889 
our second string hit that that's way

00:04:55.889 --> 00:05:00.080 
our second string hit that that's way
flat<00:04:56.220> to<00:04:56.730> B<00:04:56.940> flat<00:04:56.970> instead<00:04:57.630> of<00:04:57.720> a<00:04:57.780> B<00:04:57.990> note<00:04:59.000> so<00:05:00.000> we

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.090 
flat to B flat instead of a B note so we

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:08.020 
flat to B flat instead of a B note so we
need<00:05:00.210> to<00:05:00.300> come<00:05:00.449> up<00:05:03.050> quite<00:05:04.050> a<00:05:04.080> way<00:05:04.260> he's<00:05:04.530> a

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:08.030

00:05:13.189 --> 00:05:13.199 
little more okay we got a green light

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:15.620 
little more okay we got a green light
and<00:05:13.560> the<00:05:13.770> needle<00:05:14.040> is<00:05:14.100> in<00:05:14.190> the<00:05:14.220> middle<00:05:14.520> so<00:05:14.669> let's

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:15.630 
and the needle is in the middle so let's

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:17.560 
and the needle is in the middle so let's
go<00:05:15.810> to<00:05:15.870> our<00:05:16.229> high<00:05:16.410> E<00:05:16.440> string<00:05:16.560> our<00:05:16.949> last<00:05:17.220> string

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:17.570 
go to our high E string our last string

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:20.390 
go to our high E string our last string
see<00:05:18.570> what<00:05:18.690> that<00:05:18.810> is<00:05:18.870> that's<00:05:19.320> an<00:05:19.440> E<00:05:19.530> flat<00:05:19.919> it

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:20.400 
see what that is that's an E flat it

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.340 
see what that is that's an E flat it
says<00:05:20.699> and<00:05:21.030> that<00:05:21.210> needs<00:05:21.360> to<00:05:21.479> be<00:05:21.510> an<00:05:21.690> e<00:05:21.840> so<00:05:22.260> we

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:22.350 
says and that needs to be an e so we

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:23.840 
says and that needs to be an e so we
need<00:05:22.500> to<00:05:22.590> come<00:05:22.800> up<00:05:22.919> quite<00:05:23.160> a<00:05:23.190> ways<00:05:23.400> on<00:05:23.550> this<00:05:23.700> one

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:23.850 
need to come up quite a ways on this one

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:34.129 
need to come up quite a ways on this one
as<00:05:23.970> well

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:38.249 

okay<00:05:35.139> now<00:05:35.319> our<00:05:35.349> guitar<00:05:35.710> is<00:05:35.800> in<00:05:35.830> tune<00:05:37.169> now<00:05:38.169> if

00:05:38.249 --> 00:05:38.259 
okay now our guitar is in tune now if

00:05:38.259 --> 00:05:39.390 
okay now our guitar is in tune now if
that<00:05:38.349> seemed<00:05:38.590> a<00:05:38.650> little<00:05:38.830> bit<00:05:38.949> difficult<00:05:39.129> for

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:39.400 
that seemed a little bit difficult for

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:42.179 
that seemed a little bit difficult for
you<00:05:39.669> to<00:05:39.939> find<00:05:40.150> out<00:05:40.330> what<00:05:41.050> pitches<00:05:41.529> belong

00:05:42.179 --> 00:05:42.189 
you to find out what pitches belong

00:05:42.189 --> 00:05:43.679 
you to find out what pitches belong
where<00:05:42.550> don't<00:05:42.939> worry<00:05:43.150> about<00:05:43.300> it

00:05:43.679 --> 00:05:43.689 
where don't worry about it

00:05:43.689 --> 00:05:45.269 
where don't worry about it
the<00:05:43.870> more<00:05:44.080> you<00:05:44.199> experiment<00:05:44.499> with<00:05:44.770> your<00:05:44.979> tuner

00:05:45.269 --> 00:05:45.279 
the more you experiment with your tuner

00:05:45.279 --> 00:05:48.209 
the more you experiment with your tuner
and<00:05:45.490> the<00:05:45.969> more<00:05:46.180> you<00:05:46.419> exposed<00:05:47.349> to<00:05:47.770> stuff<00:05:48.129> like

00:05:48.209 --> 00:05:48.219 
and the more you exposed to stuff like

and the more you exposed to stuff like
the<00:05:48.430> major<00:05:48.639> scale<00:05:49.029> and<00:05:49.300> your<00:05:49.509> training<00:05:49.990> your

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:50.110 
the major scale and your training your

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:52.049 
the major scale and your training your
ear<00:05:50.319> to<00:05:50.499> hear<00:05:50.650> notes<00:05:50.949> it'll<00:05:51.550> become<00:05:51.639> a<00:05:51.759> lot

00:05:52.049 --> 00:05:52.059 
ear to hear notes it'll become a lot

00:05:52.059 --> 00:06:00.690 
ear to hear notes it'll become a lot
easier<00:05:52.479> for<00:05:52.719> you
