that's fantastic it's good for Edinburgh
good<00:01:49.470> for<00:01:49.650> Scotland<00:01:50.100> but<00:01:50.790> it's<00:01:50.970> also<00:01:51.479> good<00:01:51.750> for

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
good for Scotland but it's also good for

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.600 
good for Scotland but it's also good for
the<00:01:52.020> relationship<00:01:52.890> between<00:01:53.009> the<00:01:53.340> train<00:01:53.580> and

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
the relationship between the train and

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.429 
the relationship between the train and
Scott<00:01:53.970> and<00:01:54.119> that's<00:01:54.180> important<00:01:54.840> in<00:01:54.960> terms<00:01:54.990> of

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
Scott and that's important in terms of

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.190 
Scott and that's important in terms of
Education<00:01:56.369> and<00:01:56.460> research<00:01:56.939> it's<00:01:57.299> important<00:01:57.840> in

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
Education and research it's important in

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.530 
Education and research it's important in
terms<00:01:58.500> of<00:01:58.799> the<00:01:58.979> economy<00:01:59.400> so<00:01:59.909> I<00:02:00.210> really

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
terms of the economy so I really

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.030 
terms of the economy so I really
significantly<00:02:01.110> and<00:02:01.380> we<00:02:01.439> look<00:02:01.710> forward<00:02:01.920> to

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
significantly and we look forward to

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.560 
significantly and we look forward to
having<00:02:02.220> the<00:02:02.460> pandas<00:02:02.790> here<00:02:02.909> for<00:02:03.119> the<00:02:03.180> next<00:02:03.390> ten

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
having the pandas here for the next ten

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.600 
having the pandas here for the next ten
years
