00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.639
 Hello 

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:19.119
 It was never so true in Brazil. 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:22.029
 how much in these days a phrase that I did 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:24.100
 issue of putting on the cover of my book 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:29.830
 doves and hawks 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:34.199
 I say there that the naive are in the 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:34.199
 malicious food chain 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.590
 so it can not be a naive book 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:41.559
 deal with it 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:42.909
 if we do not observe reality 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:46.299
 Brazilian 

00:00:42.909 --> 00:00:50.199
 we'll see how evil has gone 

00:00:46.299 --> 00:00:53.170
 intentions as they did well when 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:56.019
 say that they have ended poverty 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.580
 had extraordinary victories over the 

00:00:56.019 --> 00:01:00.309
 poverty 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:03.519
 I keep thinking that maybe they are 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:05.680
 thinking more about themselves because they 

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:08.110
 they did very well 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:10.600
 however when going to the periphery of 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:13.650
 our cities and we see the poverty that 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:16.240
 being we'll see the balloon continues 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:19.210
 continue running sewage 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:21.730
 sanitary conditions are terrible there 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:25.930
 a poor school that the 

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:29.980
 health care is a serious drag problem 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:34.570
 the ravine ravine that collapses and trails 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:38.590
 the huts remain in the problems 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:42.180
 characteristics of poverty and at the same 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:46.180
 time we live in the middle of a crisis 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:48.250
 perfectly announced to 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:50.170
 surveillance 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.790
 making an analogy here with who 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.760
 I was paying attention to what was coming 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:57.250
 happening in recent years who saw the 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:02:01.360
 surveillance cameras did not know what 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:04.840
 it was happening was what was in 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:07.630
 course in Brazil was a crime announced 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:10.629
 and when you contemplate reality, 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:13.390
 clearly see everywhere 

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:15.580
 the fingerprints of those responsible 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:19.390
 who played Brazil in this crisis in which 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:22.280
 Inflation bored try the drilled the floor 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:26.670
 unemployment increases 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:30.290
 unfavorable conditions are combined and are 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:33.450
 perceived mainly by the naive 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:35.850
 by those who believed in the 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:39.060
 promises and the lies they took 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:42.120
 yanick comes out the biggest price 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:43.980
 that is where the higher price of the 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.640
 unemployment of poor quality of services 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.640
 public 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:52.350
 therefore it is an absolute truth that 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:55.380
 no one is out of politics unless 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:57.930
 want to live in the woods and hide 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:01.170
 reality does not participate 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.790
 it would be naive in this process to 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.250
 a disservice to oneself 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:08.220
 so this is the time to 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:11.540
 participation because Brazil was for 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:13.440
 This is a crisis that 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:16.230
 I had to pass 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:18.330
 there is no justification other than the 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:21.540
 guilty fault 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:23.550
 this is the clear Brazilian reality that 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:26.010
 the whole world recognizes why the world 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:27.200
 13 whole will grow 6 percent this 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.330
 year 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:32.430
 In Brazil, the Brazilian economy will 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:35.900
 decrease 1% 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:39.060
 so it's good to stop with naivety 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:42.600
 not to be devoured by 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:44.820
 guardians because they are well and 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:47.100
 continue very well, thank you 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:50.070
 and the history of corruption of the latter 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:52.920
 years shows this with an abundance of 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:55.489
 examples intolerable to the whole 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:04:00.470
 well- formed awareness 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:04:00.470
 think about it and participate
