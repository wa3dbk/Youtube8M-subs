00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:18.390

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:24.390
 difficult and now I want to point out to you 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:25.099
 one thing wait now for it to rise 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.189

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:30.210

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:36.350
 wait is the psycho type so we use 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.350

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:47.039
 then now look don't remember 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:52.050

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:58.170
 platinum 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:01:00.180
 In my opinion, that is, she will be the first to me 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:04.070
 Once I saw it it seemed to me 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:06.630
 very strange as we run black pulsar 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:19.380
 passive type then the dark and super 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:23.340
 effective though or not good now since 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:26.960
 you want to use thunder let's see if you can 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.960

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:45.920
 good scissors hicks that is very slow though 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:52.250
 it is an influence ok va sicilia of type 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:53.510
 flying psycho flying psycho but maybe 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.690
 knows a few moves capable of 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:02:01.820
 damage ex catheters then it 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:05.660
 we keep to the ex capri while we use 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:06.860
 landslide to usa sky ray but so much us 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:14.750
 we have the steel type there 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:19.390
 super effective scissors landslide reward 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.390

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:46.240
 by perfect and half of his team 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:46.240
 psycho type already on stage always yes 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:54.230
 he knows he has a grass state move 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:57.950
 we use hicks scissors weaken the 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:03:01.370
 a little psychic is not very effective 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:04.460
 about us and the events pozzaglio the 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:07.100
 scissors hicks from but it's too easy me 

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:12.590
 I remember well pokémon black for ds already 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:14.330
 I struggled with a well-known casino 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:17.260
 seems psychic, however, this time 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:17.260
 I want to use a little 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:22.110

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.690
 let's see what we can do with a 

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:43.120
 black pulsar 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:43.120
 no fucking nothing 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.150
 it would have been better if I had kept 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.489
 in fact explaining it now 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:54.709
 we forgive but this night is 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:04:02.599
 it was very easy 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:04:04.580
 I have to say by or with good and also 

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:09.200
 the third superquadro really is 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:13.610

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:32.200

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:43.580
