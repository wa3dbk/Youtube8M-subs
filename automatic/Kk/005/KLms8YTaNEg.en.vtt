00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
jumping up the whole way thumb ramp is

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.140 
jumping up the whole way thumb ramp is
for<00:03:23.910> a<00:03:23.940> fencing<00:03:24.570> type<00:03:24.870> thrust<00:03:25.530> and<00:03:26.150> what's

this<00:03:27.360> jumping<00:03:27.900> for<00:03:28.230> that's<00:03:29.160> actually<00:03:29.670> for<00:03:29.910> the

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
this jumping for that's actually for the

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.860

great<00:03:38.160> thing<00:03:38.400> about<00:03:38.550> this<00:03:38.940> knife<00:03:39.440> the<00:03:40.440> blade

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
great thing about this knife the blade

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.310 
great thing about this knife the blade
length<00:03:41.070> it's<00:03:41.400> an<00:03:41.550> intermediate<00:03:42.300> length<00:03:42.600> three

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:43.320 
length it's an intermediate length three

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:47.680 
length it's an intermediate length three
point<00:03:43.620> six<00:03:43.890> inches<00:03:45.380> which<00:03:46.380> to<00:03:46.739> me<00:03:46.890> means<00:03:47.100> that

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.690 
point six inches which to me means that

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:51.199 
point six inches which to me means that
unlike<00:03:48.690> some<00:03:49.020> other<00:03:49.200> Emerson<00:03:49.800> models<00:03:50.220> this<00:03:50.970> is

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
unlike some other Emerson models this is

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:55.130 
unlike some other Emerson models this is
a<00:03:51.350> reasonable<00:03:52.350> length<00:03:52.590> for<00:03:53.400> even<00:03:54.140> civilians

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
a reasonable length for even civilians

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:58.400 
a reasonable length for even civilians
