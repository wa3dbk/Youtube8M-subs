 says that in 1,829 roses and valleys 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:24.680
 have put together on the part everything with 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:27.110
 this fifth of roses the lavalle killing 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:29.590
 he came very tired to the fifth then 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:32.030
 walk for several hours on horseback 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.770
 immediately entered and look for roses 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.229
 to be able to make peace but he himself does not 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:39.140
 I was so took advantage of this shooter 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:41.570
 min a while this attitude was seen by 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.640
 the maid of roses that by identifying him 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.650
 as the enemy was quickly warn him 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.500
 to the guards actually or in the fire the 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:51.020
 milk that is basically in milk and 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:53.990
 mixed sugar to sweeten the 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.930
 mate roses finally arrived and he asked 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:58.270
 the maid that brings the grout 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:00.340
 at this point she realized that 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:03.100
 he had left it on fire for many 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:06.070
 minutes and running to the kitchen to 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:09.369
 find an extensive and brown liquid 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:11.860
 but the remarkable flavor and so on this 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:15.700
 patriotic context was born the sweet of 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:17.800
 milk and lie a lethal drag tone 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.840
 more than bitter is what the people of 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.520
 that time he wrote and second 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.890
 right of the forest a long time in 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:27.580
 the fire is burning is more I dare 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.900
 say and I fear right 2 my country that does not 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.290
 to be made possible is a monument 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.290
 Chilean 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.720
 we found the records in Mendoza 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:40.020
 where you see imports of dulce de leche 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:44.030
 since 2006 90 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:44.030
 long before thousand eight so many 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:53.250
 let's move on to crumble 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:56.210
 lava start so now let's put 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:59.770
 hands to the dough 

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:59.770
 the reds all well chiquitito 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:11.500
 bird shacks 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.659
 in this particular case I use this 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.400
 because the reservation is my girlfriends but 

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:17.920
 how can you use any other type 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:20.379
 of artist perfect character with latex 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.810
 It is not the dulce de leche if 

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:25.150
 you have more within reach what would be the 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:30.870
 again new peanut butter 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:34.069
 it could also be more eye in sight 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.069
 who clicks 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:38.300
 it's similar to 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:42.040
 platform 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:46.080
 the big one like these friends 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:50.090

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:50.090

00:03:55.460 --> 00:04:00.030
 yes of course that studied cooking a 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:02.520
 Couple of years 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:04.550
 we hear what you can do is cover 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:09.290
 of the chocolate bath and that way 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:09.290
 same calories and flavor 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:18.720
 now we have in the spring in the 

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:22.120
 heat or black over passion where the 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:24.979
 people are relocating cold 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:27.669
 in an economic way and be able to do 

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:27.669
 chocolates 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:33.460
 what time who else have overturned with your 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:37.030
 own hands any turn to a 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:39.820
 bakery this as we can see here a 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:42.820
 amount of air chapped are moments of 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:46.530
 milk candy or stain or mark 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:46.530
 white or sweet cajeta 

00:04:56.409 --> 00:05:01.250
 or not 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:01.250
 it's something that's going to happen 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:11.080
 today I cut my finger 

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:19.020
 in the food 

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:19.020
 with pressure to give tears 

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:28.950
 or 

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:35.350
 Everything that happened 

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:40.140
 It has been an obvious 2011 if you want to do it 

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:40.140
 so about tastes there is nothing written 

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:49.290
 what's initially going to happen for 

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:49.290
 the world a little ball like the ass 

00:05:50.789 --> 00:05:53.789

 one click the presentation is impeccable and 

00:05:59.129 --> 00:06:03.539
 the grana does not finish I do not have explanations 

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:07.470
 to achieve it is passed through chemicals 

00:06:03.539 --> 00:06:09.629
 they are also pieces of cable and 

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:12.169
 also many guys that these are 

00:06:09.629 --> 00:06:12.169
