00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
 because that's the right way to make money 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:08.599
 Market covers but pays dearly 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:11.490
 unused printer toner left over 

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:13.049
 cartridges with less and less ink 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.030
 then even with trickery 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.770
 printed pages let the manufacturers 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.350
 a lot of things come to mind about the money 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.119
 to come to your customers 

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:23.519
 the market is in the price segment 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.060
 contested and it is about every inch 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.590
 through the price policy of the manufacturer 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:30.660
 the cartridges are completely overpriced the 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.710
 Printer manufacturers are not printers at all 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:36.630
 sellers but cartridges sales 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:38.879
 mark spectator wolfgang herrndorf vor 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.969
 his laser printer in the display says it 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:44.129
 Change toner cartridges black 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.809
 For two years he has been with this 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.059
 message regularly the toner too 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.219
 swapped the costs just under 60 euros 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:54.710
 but last was the doctor of chemistry 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:57.180
 suspicious there was a report in the ndr 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.859
 Market data you showed as with 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.660
 ink cartridges so the 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:04.080
 ink jet printer according to the 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.580
 people will look cheated, so to speak 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.290
 Of course, they are interested in how they do it 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.210
 laser printers from happening it there 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.590
 just like that 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.869
 he takes the seemingly empty one 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:16.110
 carton in front of it and apart 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:18.540
 looks to the gram he spooned the 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.490
 sound coming out more and more for 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.920
 the fore 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.340
 in total, wolfgang herrndorf 64 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.100
 gram 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:29.250
 I criticize the thing that here 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:32.430
 I'm going to pay for the toner inside 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.950
 but does not have to use 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.470
 to print in which the printer tells me 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.440
 the cartouche is empty though she is 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.500
 definitely not empty 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:44.150
 as many as 3,000 pages could 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.130
 wolfgang herrndorf with this crowd 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:49.490
 additionally print toner 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:51.680
 i could with the price in for the 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:54.020
 Cartridge pay 60 percent more 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:58.330
 namely print 8000 pages 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.330
 instead of the specified 5000 times 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:04.090
 typically, tanner thinks of the 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.979
 trade magazine ct he has common and 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.440
 smaller laser printer for the private 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:10.479
 user tested often enough 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.970
 toner in the cartridge though the pressure 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:24.900
 worse is his tip simply the 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:24.900
 All in all, everything is good 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:35.080
 about 100 pages 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:41.110
 but you can get 10 10 percent after all 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:42.880
 or cash at three to four cents 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:44.709
 per page makes a few quick 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.540
 euro the trick with shaking 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:48.190
 the manufacturers do not point this out 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:51.480
 the user should be the cartouche 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:54.700
 replace a new buy money spend 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:58.230
 who earn money as well 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:01.350
 Throw away the more money it earns 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.350
 clearly 

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:06.550
 wolfgang herrndorf complains 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.500
 manufacturer brother over the left 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:10.900
 remained restaurant only after 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.640
 several emails try the hint 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.110
 Please take the cartouche once 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.300
 shake it up in it 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:19.890
 the toner loosens up 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:22.060
 simple tip only after a lot of effort 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:24.190
 also the users of ink cartridges 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:26.230
 be tricked says wilfried 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:28.510
 tail owner of an ink after 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:30.850
 He shows us the ink in 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:34.450
 the cartridges is becoming less and less an example 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:37.690
 Epson these cartridges this about five 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:39.760
 Years old were the opening then sees 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:42.450
 one very beautiful cartridge was full 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:46.810
 then she arrived with the next cartridge 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:49.270
 you can already see what is missing here 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:53.040
 she arrived with the next cartridge and 

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:55.420
 then you see it will be even less 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:58.060
 But prices do not go up accordingly 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:00.970
 down as it gets less with the ink 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:03.370
 so now the sharks had on this 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:06.100
 cartridges have such a lid on it 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:09.490
 you could lose weight then you have seen 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:11.560
 So it does not have much ink in it 

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:13.090
 I fill more ink rhein main die 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:15.190
 just make a black foil 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:17.200
 so that you do not see how 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:19.510
 there is little in there in such a cartridge 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:20.670
 so and then they come with the next 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:24.000
 cartridge 

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:27.880
 there is still less ink in it 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:30.370
 epson writes us because of 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:32.290
 varying pressure behavior of customers 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:36.040
 offers Epson cartridges with 

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:40.120
 different reach at the back 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:42.520
 collapse as a customer request, for example 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:44.560
 hewlett packard here are sponges with 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:46.960
 ink filled this one still fills the 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:49.480
 whole cartridges chamber out of the only 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:52.450
 half of the next sponge is missing 

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:53.700
 below what and fits only in one 

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:55.980
 tiny chamber 

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:58.560
 why those inks want that 

00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:00.450
 This time we know from hp for the 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:02.100
 customers are crucial information 

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:04.590
 not the milliliter but the 

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:06.630
 communicated pages reach writes 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:08.970
 the manufacturer and why less 

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:10.650
 so also hp does not answer less 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:12.960
 Ink in the cartridge is one thing 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:15.650
 problem the confusing pages given 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:19.260
 on the packaging the next 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:21.060
 for example, these kodak ink cartridges here 

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:24.720
 stand on it with this black cartridge 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:26.610
 There are 770 pages to print normally 

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:29.040
 will reach the pages with a 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:31.740
 so-called color iso-norm measured 

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:33.240
 this standard test printing with it 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:35.370
 the manufacturers determine the pages 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:39.450
 Reach your ink cartridges only 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:42.810
 Kodak does it differently 

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:44.760
 all on the vbs document and assign 

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:48.210
 Thus the reach of the black and the 

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:50.850
 cartridges off and kodak just takes 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:52.830
 additionally for the black cartridge the 

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:55.080
 black so document for laser printer 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:57.540
 and thus achieves a higher range 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:06:00.420
 for the patron saint it works 

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:03.270
 problem so the 770 pages reached 

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:06.150
 kodak not with this standard iso standard 

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:08.310
 but with this one actually applies 

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:10.440
 only for black laser printer not for 

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:12.780
 inkjet printer the actual iso 

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:14.910
 Document for color prints whose range 

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:16.890
 is in the flow text and then it is 

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:18.660
 only 440 pages worth just this 

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:20.700
 I need to make with others 

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:22.590
 or other black cartridges 

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:25.560
 to be able to compare women on it 

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:27.030
 so there are about 770 pages to deal with 

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:28.860
 to compare other cartridges 

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:31.260
 the customer must here in the small print 

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:34.080
 look the actual comparable 

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:37.020
 range here is very small 440th 

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:39.300
 pages kodak cheats on one stop 

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:41.729
 higher range and 

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:45.360
 thus, perhaps, faces each other 

00:06:41.729 --> 00:06:47.060
 another slightly better kodak writes us 

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:49.800
 on demand 

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:51.720
 kodak represents the point of view that one 

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:53.520
 pure text page as the basis for the 

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:55.319
 range test of a black cartridge 

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:58.080
 the greatest expressiveness for the 

00:06:55.319 --> 00:07:00.409
 has consumer and continues in 

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:01.979
 The foreground of action is with kodak 

00:07:00.409 --> 00:07:05.509
 transparency in a very 

00:07:01.979 --> 00:07:05.509
 create an opaque market 

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:10.810
 That's what Kodak looks like 

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:19.430
 fight each drop every drop of ink 

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:21.530
 every gram of toner for the consumer 

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:23.110
 stays exactly in sight and not 

00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:25.730
 to put up with everything 

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:28.180
 maybe relaxation on the 

00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:28.180
 ship
