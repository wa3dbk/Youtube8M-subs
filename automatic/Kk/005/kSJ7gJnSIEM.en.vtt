00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.830
 we come to the sporting highlight of the 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.870
 day in thuringia more than led 

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:09.719
 10,000 spectators jena serious abbe 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.460
 stadium for the quarterfinal match around the 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.580
 thÃ¼ringenpokal between titleholders 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.670
 FC Carl Zeiss Jena and third division red 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.160
 knows erfurt 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:21.110
 Awesome mood in every stadium 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.750
 well filled like no longer 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:25.189
 against Bayer Leverkusen in the first 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:27.680
 dfb-cup were not that many 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:30.170
 windows like today and they are visible 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:32.840
 very exciting derby that hardly 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:34.910
 wishes let red-white erfurt with 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.879
 the better start after eight minutes 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:40.550
 subtracts dominick drexler from the left 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:43.190
 penal border and indicates with it 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.960
 We want our favorite role here 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:48.199
 to live up to everyone 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.280
 but alois black knows everyone can 

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:50.390
 in the meantime again a bit 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.190
 football play the last 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.320
 success experiences in the regionalliga 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.330
 have given confidence and tino 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.739
 schmidt leaves the stadium for the first time 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:59.629
 get really loud 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:01.760
 There was not much missing as well 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:04.010
 grow before the committee dominique 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.780
 the red and white played in the 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:07.729
 follow a slight overweight what is 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.830
 also reflected in the basin and stands 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:12.320
 the fourth is like really dangerous 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:14.479
 For the gate of Tino Berkig merkel 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.640
 only hits the outside post 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:19.000
 So the host has a shower that he 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.229
 not left behind here 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.479
 the best chance in the first half 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:26.780
 but the red white came through 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:29.149
 dominick drexler in the 33 minute yet 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:32.119
 tino berbig reacts in jena tor 

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:34.429
 Great and keeps his box clean 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:36.710
 with a slightly happy for everyone 0 

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:39.020
 it goes to 0 in the half-time break 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:41.299
 then again red white erfurt with more 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.310
 single-minded to the goal and has two goals 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:44.330
 kevin ewald the chance of the third division 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.570
 to lead 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:49.460
 But it does not matter that keeps jena 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:52.369
 in the game the regional alligist will leave the 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:54.290
 60 minutes more courageous and lets the great 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:56.390
 ball again tino schmidt with the 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:58.520
 Schusschance after nice play by 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.860
 Marcel Schlosser plays both teams 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.240
 now at eye level but a goal is missing 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.960
 That's why it brings you back after a long time 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.830
 injury break morabit during jena 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.050
 injury to center-back 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.640
 roche has to do without the 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.739
 Ankle has broken without strangers 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.750
 this effect causes unrest in the 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:16.640
 jenaer defense and as everything already 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.500
 set to an extension there 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.260
 the one decisive ball comes up 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:24.470
 mio tunjic and that hits in the 89th 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:26.120
 minute one to zero for erfurt and how 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.920
 the derby is the last time 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.410
 literally last minute 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.750
 decided this time but for the fc 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:34.880
 red-white accordingly dejected 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.550
 the mood when groping when well 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.530
 On the other hand, I think so briefly 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:41.840
 then excrete before closing 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.480
 Of course, it takes a completely different course 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.860
 the emotional state of the winner I think 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.540
 that we actually over 90 minutes 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:49.040
 best team we were many 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.780
 good opportunities now has her after 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.100
 none for 90 minutes daily 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.090
 had one hundred percent goal shot and 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.890
 that we really do not care for anything 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.810
 admitted and therefore pulls 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:59.120
 does not deserve an undeserved semifinals 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:03.489
 one as well as meuselwitz today 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.489
 13 0 was successful in Geratal
