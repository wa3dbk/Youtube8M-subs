to<00:02:06.550> do<00:02:06.670> is<00:02:06.700> to<00:02:06.850> learn<00:02:07.120> some<00:02:07.480> new<00:02:08.170> little<00:02:08.470> shapes

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:08.800 
to do is to learn some new little shapes

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.670 
to do is to learn some new little shapes
here<00:02:09.070> firstly<00:02:09.940> we<00:02:10.630> start<00:02:10.960> off<00:02:11.140> with<00:02:11.320> the<00:02:11.350> index

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
here firstly we start off with the index

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.350 
here firstly we start off with the index

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
finger on the 5th fret of the treble E

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.080 
finger on the 5th fret of the treble E
string<00:02:16.630> and<00:02:16.900> our<00:02:17.200> middle<00:02:18.010> finger<00:02:18.040> on<00:02:18.370> the<00:02:18.430> 6th

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
string and our middle finger on the 6th

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.830 
string and our middle finger on the 6th
fret<00:02:19.330> of<00:02:19.540> the<00:02:19.600> g<00:02:19.750> or<00:02:20.320> 3rd<00:02:20.680> string<00:02:21.540> I'm<00:02:22.540> going<00:02:22.750> to

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
fret of the g or 3rd string I'm going to

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.510 
fret of the g or 3rd string I'm going to
play<00:02:22.990> them<00:02:23.230> with<00:02:23.350> the<00:02:23.530> right<00:02:23.710> fingers<00:02:24.250> on<00:02:24.400> the

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
play them with the right fingers on the

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.310 
play them with the right fingers on the
right<00:02:24.550> hand<00:02:24.760> which<00:02:25.210> means<00:02:25.450> the<00:02:25.600> index<00:02:25.930> finger

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:26.320 
right hand which means the index finger

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:27.690 
right hand which means the index finger
and<00:02:26.350> the<00:02:26.500> ring<00:02:26.590> finger<00:02:26.800> because<00:02:27.490> we're

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
and the ring finger because we're

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.270 
and the ring finger because we're
sticking<00:02:28.030> to<00:02:28.180> our<00:02:28.210> rules<00:02:28.630> of<00:02:28.870> the<00:02:29.020> study<00:02:29.350> so

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
sticking to our rules of the study so

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.880 
sticking to our rules of the study so
we've<00:02:30.400> gone<00:02:30.550> back<00:02:30.820> to<00:02:30.970> the<00:02:31.060> rules

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
we've gone back to the rules

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.800 
we've gone back to the rules
so<00:02:33.890> our<00:02:34.370> thumb<00:02:34.760> plays<00:02:35.090> the<00:02:35.330> a<00:02:35.360> string<00:02:35.780> of

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
so our thumb plays the a string of

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:36.910 
so our thumb plays the a string of
course<00:02:36.110> because<00:02:36.290> we're<00:02:36.470> in<00:02:36.560> the<00:02:36.680> key<00:02:36.860> right

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
course because we're in the key right

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.590 
course because we're in the key right
and<00:02:37.220> we're<00:02:37.310> using<00:02:37.520> a<00:02:37.730> technique<00:02:38.090> here<00:02:38.390> that's

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:38.600 
and we're using a technique here that's

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.230 
and we're using a technique here that's
sort<00:02:38.840> of<00:02:39.070> more<00:02:40.070> or<00:02:40.220> less<00:02:40.370> what's<00:02:40.640> called<00:02:40.910> dead

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:41.240 
sort of more or less what's called dead

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:44.220 
sort of more or less what's called dead
thumb<00:02:41.600> where<00:02:42.050> we<00:02:42.230> just<00:02:42.980> playing<00:02:43.250> on<00:02:43.490> the<00:02:43.640> one

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
thumb where we just playing on the one

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.930 
thumb where we just playing on the one
bass<00:02:45.230> string<00:02:45.590> instead<00:02:45.920> of<00:02:46.070> alternating<00:02:46.610> like

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
bass string instead of alternating like

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:48.610 
bass string instead of alternating like
we<00:02:47.120> were<00:02:47.330> in<00:02:47.480> shallow<00:02:47.720> creek<00:02:48.020> blues<00:02:48.260> because

00:02:58.950 --> 00:02:58.960 
that independence so again thumb index

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:02.530 
that independence so again thumb index
ring<00:02:59.960> index<00:03:00.650> finger<00:03:01.220> index<00:03:01.610> ring<00:03:02.000> on<00:03:02.360> that
