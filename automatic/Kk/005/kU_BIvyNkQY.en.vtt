00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
deformable tool um and this tool is

now<00:01:16.259> what's<00:01:16.470> happening<00:01:16.860> is<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.040> bombs

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
now what's happening is the bombs

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:18.800 
now what's happening is the bombs
exploding<00:01:17.790> but<00:01:18.090> it's<00:01:18.210> not<00:01:18.360> actually

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
anything what we want to do is make this

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.359 
anything what we want to do is make this
sphere<00:01:26.820> get<00:01:27.540> hit<00:01:27.720> by<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:27.960> bombs<00:01:28.110> explosion<00:01:28.740> if

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
sphere get hit by the bombs explosion if

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.090 
sphere get hit by the bombs explosion if
you<00:01:29.460> can<00:01:29.640> imagine<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:30.119> bomb<00:01:30.979> exploding<00:01:31.979> like

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
you can imagine the bomb exploding like

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.859 
you can imagine the bomb exploding like
a<00:01:32.130> normal<00:01:32.460> bomb<00:01:32.579> it<00:01:32.790> goes<00:01:32.970> out<00:01:33.150> in<00:01:33.479> a<00:01:33.570> spherical

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
a normal bomb it goes out in a spherical

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.340 
a normal bomb it goes out in a spherical
shape<00:01:34.590> so<00:01:35.430> right<00:01:35.970> now<00:01:36.180> where<00:01:36.540> a<00:01:36.570> bomb<00:01:36.840> is<00:01:37.079> in

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
shape so right now where a bomb is in

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.080 
shape so right now where a bomb is in
relation<00:01:37.770> to<00:01:37.799> our<00:01:37.979> sphere<00:01:38.250> it<00:01:38.460> will<00:01:38.610> come<00:01:38.880> and

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
relation to our sphere it will come and

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.390 
relation to our sphere it will come and
explode<00:01:40.079> and<00:01:40.290> our<00:01:40.710> whole<00:01:40.920> sphere<00:01:41.189> will

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
explode and our whole sphere will

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.639 
explode and our whole sphere will
explode<00:01:41.790> to<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.060> right<00:01:42.329> if<00:01:43.049> we<00:01:43.200> move<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.500> bomb

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
explode to the right if we move the bomb

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.630 
explode to the right if we move the bomb
to<00:01:43.799> the<00:01:43.920> other<00:01:44.040> side<00:01:44.340> by<00:01:45.329> pressing<00:01:45.360> W<00:01:45.930> and

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640 
to the other side by pressing W and

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.880 
to the other side by pressing W and
dragging<00:01:47.640> here<00:01:47.909> now<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:48.689> bombs<00:01:48.990> explosion

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
dragging here now the bombs explosion

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.569 
dragging here now the bombs explosion
will<00:01:50.070> force<00:01:50.340> it<00:01:50.490> evolve<00:01:50.790> to<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.180> left<00:01:52.579> go

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
will force it evolve to the left go

will force it evolve to the left go
ahead<00:01:53.700> and<00:01:53.820> put<00:01:53.939> that<00:01:54.060> back<00:01:54.210> on<00:01:54.509> where<00:01:54.899> do<00:01:54.960> you

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
ahead and put that back on where do you

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.539 
ahead and put that back on where do you
know<00:01:55.790> basically<00:01:56.790> what<00:01:57.060> a<00:01:57.090> bomb<00:01:57.649> does<00:01:58.649> in<00:01:59.040> 3ds

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
know basically what a bomb does in 3ds

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.030 
know basically what a bomb does in 3ds
max<00:01:59.880> is<00:02:00.180> it<00:02:00.479> rips<00:02:00.719> apart<00:02:00.899> every<00:02:01.380> polygon<00:02:01.710> and

to explode if we zoom out here and press

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:59.460 
to explode if we zoom out here and press
play<00:02:49.770> it<00:02:50.770> explodes<00:02:53.190> right<00:02:56.550> explode<00:02:58.230> in<00:02:59.230> fact

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
play it explodes right explode in fact

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.620 
play it explodes right explode in fact
you<00:02:59.620> can<00:02:59.770> play<00:02:59.980> around<00:03:00.100> with<00:03:00.310> it<00:03:00.630> the

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630 
you can play around with it the

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:05.970 
you can play around with it the
simulation<00:03:02.140> keeps<00:03:02.320> running<00:03:02.620> and<00:03:04.740> if<00:03:05.740> we<00:03:05.860> go

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
simulation keeps running and if we go

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:07.830 
simulation keeps running and if we go
inside<00:03:06.160> the<00:03:06.340> bomb<00:03:06.640> of<00:03:06.820> course<00:03:07.060> it<00:03:07.300> is<00:03:07.390> going<00:03:07.540> to

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
inside the bomb of course it is going to

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:08.730 
inside the bomb of course it is going to
explode

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:08.740 
explode

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:12.630

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:20.169 
adulthood into etc but this gives us a

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:23.700 
adulthood into etc but this gives us a

chaos<00:04:32.900> is<00:04:33.170> just<00:04:33.410> a<00:04:33.530> random<00:04:34.960> explosion<00:04:35.960> thing

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:36.290 
chaos is just a random explosion thing

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:40.300 
chaos is just a random explosion thing
it<00:04:36.650> makes<00:04:36.860> it<00:04:37.270> more<00:04:38.270> chaotic<00:04:38.900> seed<00:04:39.740> also<00:04:40.010> does

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:40.310 
it makes it more chaotic seed also does

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:42.850 
it makes it more chaotic seed also does
that<00:04:40.520> so<00:04:40.850> we're<00:04:40.940> gonna<00:04:41.060> add<00:04:41.270> point<00:04:41.930> two<00:04:42.500> to

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:42.860 
that so we're gonna add point two to

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:48.010 
that so we're gonna add point two to
seed<00:04:43.130> and<00:04:43.550> I<00:04:44.650> guess<00:04:45.730> one<00:04:46.730> seed<00:04:47.090> and<00:04:47.330> 1k<00:04:47.900> on

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:48.020 
seed and I guess one seed and 1k on

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:51.910 
seed and I guess one seed and 1k on
point<00:04:48.770> Q<00:04:49.010> chaos<00:04:49.310> sir<00:04:50.020> the<00:04:51.020> detonation<00:04:51.440> is<00:04:51.740> the

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:51.920 
point Q chaos sir the detonation is the

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:53.170 
point Q chaos sir the detonation is the
amount<00:04:52.220> of<00:04:52.310> frames<00:04:52.520> that<00:04:52.670> have<00:04:52.790> to<00:04:53.000> pass

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:53.180 
amount of frames that have to pass

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:55.180 
amount of frames that have to pass
before<00:04:53.390> it<00:04:53.660> explodes<00:04:54.020> so<00:04:54.560> right<00:04:54.740> now<00:04:54.860> it's<00:04:55.040> at

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:55.190 
before it explodes so right now it's at

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:56.860 
before it explodes so right now it's at
five<00:04:55.460> which<00:04:55.790> means<00:04:56.000> five<00:04:56.240> frames<00:04:56.540> passed

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:56.870 
five which means five frames passed

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:59.620 
five which means five frames passed
before<00:04:57.230> explodes<00:04:58.090> what<00:04:59.090> we're<00:04:59.210> gonna<00:04:59.300> do<00:04:59.510> is

00:04:59.620 --> 00:04:59.630 
before explodes what we're gonna do is

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:02.320 
before explodes what we're gonna do is
set<00:04:59.750> this<00:04:59.930> to<00:05:00.370> 10<00:05:01.370> and<00:05:01.700> that<00:05:01.970> will<00:05:02.090> give<00:05:02.180> us<00:05:02.240> a

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:02.330 
set this to 10 and that will give us a

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:04.030 
set this to 10 and that will give us a
little<00:05:02.450> bit<00:05:02.570> of<00:05:02.690> delay<00:05:03.110> before<00:05:03.350> it<00:05:03.590> explodes

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:04.040 
little bit of delay before it explodes

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:07.420 
little bit of delay before it explodes
with<00:05:04.810> our<00:05:05.810> bomb<00:05:05.990> all<00:05:06.290> set<00:05:06.650> up<00:05:06.770> we<00:05:07.010> can<00:05:07.070> go<00:05:07.280> back

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:07.430 
with our bomb all set up we can go back

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:10.000 
with our bomb all set up we can go back
to<00:05:07.460> find<00:05:07.760> a<00:05:07.880> space<00:05:08.060> work<00:05:08.330> up<00:05:08.570> here<00:05:08.860> click<00:05:09.860> on

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:10.010 
to find a space work up here click on

to find a space work up here click on
the<00:05:10.130> bond<00:05:10.750> click<00:05:11.750> on<00:05:11.900> his<00:05:12.020> head<00:05:12.260> and<00:05:13.210> we<00:05:14.210> can

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:14.390 
the bond click on his head and we can

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:26.750 
the bond click on his head and we can
get<00:05:14.540> a<00:05:14.720> better<00:05:14.900> angle<00:05:15.250> by<00:05:16.250> rotating<00:05:16.640> like<00:05:16.880> this

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:26.760 

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:30.380 

now<00:05:27.270> when<00:05:27.510> we<00:05:28.040> scroll<00:05:29.040> the<00:05:29.250> wheel<00:05:29.370> lane<00:05:29.730> you

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:30.390 
now when we scroll the wheel lane you

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:34.970 
now when we scroll the wheel lane you
can<00:05:30.540> see<00:05:30.750> a<00:05:31.580> ten<00:05:32.580> gets<00:05:33.240> fragmented<00:05:33.660> and<00:05:34.020> he

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:34.980 
can see a ten gets fragmented and he

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:38.560 
can see a ten gets fragmented and he
explodes<00:05:35.730> outwards<00:05:36.090> into<00:05:36.720> the<00:05:36.810> camera

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:38.570 
explodes outwards into the camera

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:40.550 
explodes outwards into the camera
this<00:05:39.570> looks<00:05:39.780> really<00:05:39.900> cool<00:05:40.080> if<00:05:40.200> you<00:05:40.290> render<00:05:40.470> it

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:40.560 
this looks really cool if you render it

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:43.880 
this looks really cool if you render it
and<00:05:40.800> if<00:05:40.860> we<00:05:40.980> zoom<00:05:41.010> out<00:05:41.280> play<00:05:42.470> you<00:05:43.470> can<00:05:43.620> see<00:05:43.740> that

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:43.890 
and if we zoom out play you can see that

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:45.680 
and if we zoom out play you can see that
that<00:05:43.950> chaos<00:05:44.250> and<00:05:44.490> strength<00:05:45.000> really<00:05:45.420> made<00:05:45.570> it

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:45.690 
that chaos and strength really made it

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:48.620 
that chaos and strength really made it
explode<00:05:45.960> a<00:05:46.020> lot<00:05:46.200> more<00:05:46.380> than<00:05:46.530> that<00:05:46.650> sphere<00:05:47.600> so<00:05:48.600> I

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:48.630 
explode a lot more than that sphere so I

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:49.880 
explode a lot more than that sphere so I
hope<00:05:48.780> you<00:05:48.870> enjoyed<00:05:49.110> learning<00:05:49.140> how<00:05:49.650> to<00:05:49.680> do

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:49.890 
hope you enjoyed learning how to do

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:52.250 
hope you enjoyed learning how to do
bombs<00:05:50.430> and<00:05:50.760> whatnot<00:05:51.090> and<00:05:51.240> I<00:05:51.840> hope<00:05:52.020> you

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:52.260 
bombs and whatnot and I hope you

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.890 
bombs and whatnot and I hope you
continue<00:05:52.470> to<00:05:52.710> use<00:05:53.610> 3ds<00:05:53.940> max<00:05:54.240> for<00:05:54.720> your
