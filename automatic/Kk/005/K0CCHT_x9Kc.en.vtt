00:00:00.769 --> 00:00:03.560
 good evening and welcome to the weather 

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:07.310
 There were already quite a few sections next to denser cumulus clouds and also 

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:08.460
 occasionally showers 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.680
 the air will dry it more and more over the next few days 

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:15.580
 and that means being friendlier and having investors with us 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:18.619
 and they are already the densest wanted to go to the east and tomorrow 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:22.880
 Southeast Germany usually quite friendly with a long time ago 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:24.750
 denser cumulus clouds in the afternoon 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.090
 still the air is relatively humid and there are several times warmer 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:31.360
 because the warm air comes from the southwest and has to be quite a big one 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:35.870
 But it's getting warmer already at the weekend 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:37.680
 Feininger Mauch next week 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.970
 and a lot of sunshine already in the morning, especially in the West 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:41.749
 Along the Rhine 

00:00:41.749 --> 00:00:44.849
 There it is morning mostly in ten to twelve hours direction Saxony 

00:00:44.849 --> 00:00:46.059
 Southern Brandenburg 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:50.559
 and southeastern Bavaria a bit more subdued because usually only 0 to 2 hours 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:51.880
 Sun 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.920
 Now at nightfall, most of the cumulus cums into something together 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.360
 They are more compact in Saxony direction now becomes more important 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.540
 as well as Bavarian Forest and right on the Bavarian Alps there can also 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:03.830
 give a few more shivers 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:07.630
 and above 800 meters are even a few snowflakes here 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.140
 North towards Lower Saxony Schleswig-Holstein in the early 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.009
 Morning hours kind of light shape fog 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:15.180
 otherwise it is usually only partly cloudy and again quite fresh 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.460
 Temperatures go back to plus 6 to minus 2 degrees and ground frost can 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:20.750
 disseminate 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.970
 was in the morning then once a sunny north Stade will be the 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.570
 Dissolve fog fairly quickly 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:29.240
 Dense clouds then still over Saxonia and also in the southeast Bavaria 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.770
 In the course of the afternoon, a bit more springs will be more dense 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:33.929
 Give source clouds 

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:37.759
 the friendliest then with lots of sun on the one hand along the Rhine and to 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:40.300
 others in the extreme north at the north and Baltic Sea 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.990
 Temperatures rise to 10 in the afternoon under the dense clouds 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.800
 until 12 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.820
 otherwise at up to 17 degrees of winter mostly weak from northwestern 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:49.670
 directions 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.619
 in the next few days sunshine and cumulus clouds to rising temperatures 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:57.659
 on Sunday then already highest values â€‹â€‹of 15 to 19 degrees in the dense not more 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:58.770
 have been so cold
