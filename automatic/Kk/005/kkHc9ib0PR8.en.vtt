00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:04.020
 halli hello my dear and sincere 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.210
 Welcome back to a new episode 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.950
 project cars and first of all thanks to over 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.840
 10,000 subscribers 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.190
 old swede has gone that fast 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.380
 Lately there comes with the whole 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.700
 thanks after all with 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.080
 special videos never mind 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.190
 That's why there is not one now 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.480
 do not worry that's not it yet 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.949
 special video is just that 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.689
 test image for calibrating the 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.100
 screens for project cars because of me 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.779
 today, the graphics settings 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.580
 but the station will show a bit 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.090
 videos are two he has right now 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.010
 belongs 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.300
 they will definitely come and that 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.329
 hopefully this week 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.739
 I hope I can start this morning 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.000
 record again normally and there 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.500
 get the rhythm back but you 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.770
 of course it still hears I have a cold 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:43.500
 been and still drinks 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.480
 liters of tea and yes actually the 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.280
 half of the time also chloe and pee 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.390
 But it still has to be 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.980
 bit added therefore are also 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.840
 no gameplay today but just 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.789
 a bit me like me and talk 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.140
 as I show my attitude here 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.969
 we have the optics attitude 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.100
 after calibrating the graph here 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.149
 I'll only do it 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.710
 superficial on the whole things 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.030
 go for more details 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.199
 Executions would have to simply in the 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.640
 description look there I link 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:10.439
 Video of guybrush threepwood of the a 45 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.170
 minutes even virtue and every 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.430
 single thing explains and shows the man 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.509
 can imagine so that will be very 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.310
 interesting and a little bit more 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.720
 have details would should the 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.420
 ideas i explain the attitude today 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:25.920
 how i use my interview 77 40 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:30.259
 70 and my excuses gtx 770 with 2 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:32.659
 gb from nvidia and there you can 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:34.740
 achieve decent value 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:36.060
 These are the visual effects 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.470
 which we look at here 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.350
 Processing filter a blind spot 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.840
 1 infection inside and out everything 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.549
 I like flowers out of them 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.829
 not the effect that is so when he is on 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.210
 his white area if one 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.619
 white area I look and say 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.790
 Do you look at the edge then let it go 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.710
 but still such a shimmer of the sun 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.290
 shine but radiate from the 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.670
 white surface which is very soft like 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.320
 looks yes I have from some 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.149
 Read comments podcast acts 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.409
 sometimes blurred that might be 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.810
 the option will be there for you a bit 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:06.119
 more sharpness gives yes and the whole 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.560
 not look so washed out 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.890
 Leaves yes so you have the sharper 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.390
 at the moment 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.430
 Surfaces have made the experience 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:13.870
 heat company of course as always desert 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.730
 Advanced game reflection always with 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.340
 I have left so much bistum correction 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:20.380
 on 101 of the standard raindrops 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.360
 vignette rays tufts and dirt 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:24.340
 Of course, I make a vignette 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.900
 sometimes when i am so for the 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.240
 repetition you want to be very happy 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.459
 one because yes, it looks a bit 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:33.490
 nice evaluation a bit nobler 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:35.680
 direction noble look we go to the 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:37.420
 Performance a bit if you go there 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:41.020
 At the top are we see that for 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:43.300
 a resolution of 1120 x 1080 pixels 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:44.739
 have the whole on 60 hertz example 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.840
 not in window mode we have one 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:50.769
 High texture resolution 16 times to the 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:52.720
 subtropical texture filter no fist 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:54.700
 and your ultimate goal is to high and low 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.019
 here then the smc on high 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.470
 You could also be a bit higher 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:59.560
 put 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:00.640
 but that is also a bit adapted 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.350
 I say because of course I do not have 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.900
 the best graphic has high reflections 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:06.850
 environment mapping highs details 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.440
 Ultra because I sometimes find it cool if dare 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:09.820
 I want to look good stretch details 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:13.120
 also very high have the shadow of 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:15.370
 23 I had actually also on 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.890
 advise on guybrush threepwood 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:20.019
 set low so that the shadows 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:22.450
 did not know so hot otherwise 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:23.440
 otherwise the picture wobbles is for 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:25.930
 for example if you since baumreihe 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.910
 past moored and the shadow 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:31.000
 burns directly on your retina 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:32.380
 so to speak, yes you can also useful 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.329
 Why is ultra wise now? 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:35.049
 I may not be there yet 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:37.420
 maybe a bit higher here 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:38.290
 I have to look again is always 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:40.090
 Try a little bit 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:42.100
 The best way to get a program is what you 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:44.110
 the fps number of characters because yes 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:46.510
 always what changes what 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:47.500
 how does the fps number change when i am 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:48.820
 go to play 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.799
 after I changed what setting 

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:52.420
 yes, yes, of course, is a bit much 

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:53.920
 but if you do it all right 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:55.420
 has also looked damn good 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:58.299
 I used to always have those 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:00.400
 motion blur was issued no 

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:01.989
 great fan of was just in assetto 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.220
 corse for the musicians, for example from 

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:05.769
 and and stutters a bit too 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.670
 therefore made it out of here 

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:08.440
 I made the experience that 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:10.690
 which looks very tall quite well 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:12.820
 if she stands on medium or high then 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:15.970
 just the replays are getting a lot 

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:18.190
 nice dynamics and that's just great 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:19.330
 Number of pictures I have crime 2 me 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:21.099
 think as there are no large 

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:22.220
 performance differences whether 1 or 2 that 

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:24.590
 just serves a bit of the 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:26.810
 fps stabilization yes if emi strong 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:28.670
 waver fps then just sat up 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:32.330
 two may be more detailed 

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:33.950
 Grass apology detailed grass 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:36.200
 I would like to be a little bit higher 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:37.850
 but that's just about to be released 

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:39.110
 still a bit worried about problems 

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:40.730
 I have that now after release loca 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:43.250
 not tried it I believe there 

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:44.240
 I'll just put it up 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:45.950
 and see how it happens 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.450
 maybe in exchange with the shadow 

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:48.830
 it looks like somehow 

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:50.330
 that works fine no 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:51.560
 Idea particle quality is natural 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:53.000
 the spray of the rain and so on 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:55.370
 one could also play a partie poem 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.290
 here also ok high ultras maximum 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:59.840
 yes you see it's not all that 

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:01.460
 optimally set too high 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:03.650
 set yes that can do however 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:05.180
 do you have that for virtual reality ours 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:08.120
 nonsense but I have now 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:10.820
 Tested this configuration with me 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:13.370
 caution yes bla must reboot after 

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:15.020
 you have changed something 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:16.070
 I now have a short combination 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:18.680
 tested film clean 

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:21.169
 single player on watkins glen and that 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:21.950
 whole with 42 vehicles and the whole in 

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:23.090
 Storm 

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:24.410
 and there I had with these 

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:28.940
 Settings go shopping as well 

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:32.120
 Ultra I had stable 30 fps and one 

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:36.140
 a little over it yes 33 32 so who on 60 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:38.360
 fps does not value and gtx has 470 gtx 

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:40.850
 can adjust it so that rich 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:42.140
 but not me, I have it if not 

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:44.630
 is raining and when we are alone on the 

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:46.280
 route I have so 60 70 ps cfp 

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:47.330
 sca if not more could too 

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:49.550
 always on the track at how good the 

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:51.050
 is optimized because I know it happens 

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:52.490
 a rain race mid with a crowd 

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:54.020
 ki then, of course, the values ​​already 

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:55.460
 a little bit down so I have to 

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:57.620
 as well as a little peek that I am there 

00:05:55.460 --> 00:06:00.380
 at a constant frame rate of 48 or 

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:03.950
 60 fps at best 48 are enough for me 

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:05.540
 I get used to it 

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:07.240
 Of course, that's only possible 

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:10.070
 for the recording and especially now as 

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:11.750
 recording settings then useful for 

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:13.030
 otherwise you'll try it out a bit 

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:14.890
 a little bit 

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:16.720
 why look and try how good 

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:17.920
 may look could indeed because we'll see 

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:19.810
 if you screwed everything up then then 

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:21.400
 See how well it works or sex 

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:23.290
 experience but as I said for 

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:24.790
 detailed execution of this video 

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:26.770
 so to speak simply with guybrush 

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:29.440
 threepwood peering by the description 

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:31.150
 otherwise we look forward to the 

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:32.230
 next day because there will be like special 

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:33.610
 I would just come and watch videos 

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:34.540
 say and I try again so 

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:35.110
 such a small rhythm here 

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:36.370
 bring in 

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:38.170
 that still bothers me a little bit 

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:40.150
 The track thrown can still in bed 

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:42.310
 lie around and race 24 hours 

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:43.870
 look he comes to mix what should I 

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:46.180
 still say exactly we had the podcast 

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:49.120
 hangout by hand of course with the 

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:50.100
 mecki thompson lukas and me too 

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:52.240
 again the link in the description 

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:53.950
 is first time to look at but were synonymous 

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:55.660
 like only three hours a year so you can 

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:57.880
 you would just sit on the toilet 

00:06:55.660 --> 00:07:00.190
 we in the rhine pull over smartphone there 

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:02.830
 no topic is synonymous to the topic 

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:04.690
 progress and the hype was justified 

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:06.730
 And in addition, how are ours 

00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:10.000
 first first experiences now after 

00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:11.410
 release and so on otherwise hope 

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.880
 I give you well and a little 

00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:14.290
 better than me I'm doing already 

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:16.420
 a bit better the medium too 

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:17.230
 Hope to go uphill again 

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:18.610
 I always can, too 

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:20.590
 again constant with the recordings 

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:21.850
 start and replay gameplay videos etc 

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:23.890
 sorry that is a bit laid now 

00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:25.750
 But I hope that you understand me 

00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:28.630
 now times no superman but also 

00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:30.400
 alex ballet papa would have thought 

00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:33.850
 anyway, first follow it then 

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:36.810
 also about cars so that means up 

00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:36.810
 there what good
