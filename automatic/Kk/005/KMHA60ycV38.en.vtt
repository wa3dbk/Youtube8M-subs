00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
is the second most important shot in

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.450 
is the second most important shot in
tennis<00:00:09.300> and<00:00:09.660> it<00:00:10.380> is<00:00:10.530> also<00:00:10.680> a<00:00:10.830> very<00:00:10.890> under

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
tennis and it is also a very under

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.700

practice<00:00:11.910> shot<00:00:12.150> in<00:00:12.330> my<00:00:12.450> opinion<00:00:12.900> I<00:00:12.990> rarely<00:00:13.320> see

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
practice shot in my opinion I rarely see

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.620 
practice shot in my opinion I rarely see
players<00:00:13.950> go<00:00:14.280> out<00:00:14.430> and<00:00:14.700> practice<00:00:14.940> their<00:00:15.300> return

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
players go out and practice their return

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.450 
players go out and practice their return
of<00:00:15.809> serve<00:00:16.049> you'll<00:00:16.650> often<00:00:16.859> see<00:00:17.039> players

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
of serve you'll often see players

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.579 
of serve you'll often see players
practice<00:00:17.970> their<00:00:18.119> serves<00:00:18.480> but<00:00:19.050> usually<00:00:19.409> not

00:00:19.579 --> 00:00:19.589 
practice their serves but usually not

00:00:19.589 --> 00:00:22.040 
practice their serves but usually not
the<00:00:19.740> return<00:00:20.130> of<00:00:20.279> serve<00:00:20.490> and<00:00:20.730> that's<00:00:21.179> a<00:00:21.539> big

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
the return of serve and that's a big

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.319 
the return of serve and that's a big
mistake<00:00:22.199> in<00:00:22.619> my<00:00:22.769> opinion<00:00:23.189> so<00:00:23.970> here's<00:00:24.179> the

00:00:24.319 --> 00:00:24.329 
mistake in my opinion so here's the

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:25.849 
mistake in my opinion so here's the
thing<00:00:24.509> on<00:00:24.659> the<00:00:24.749> return<00:00:25.050> of<00:00:25.079> serve<00:00:25.349> the<00:00:25.619> big

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
thing on the return of serve the big

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.889 
thing on the return of serve the big
mistake<00:00:26.339> that<00:00:26.369> players<00:00:26.849> make<00:00:27.150> is<00:00:27.210> that<00:00:27.509> take

00:00:27.889 --> 00:00:27.899 
mistake that players make is that take

00:00:27.899 --> 00:00:31.040 
mistake that players make is that take
huge<00:00:28.349> swings<00:00:28.919> like<00:00:29.699> this<00:00:29.999> trying<00:00:30.509> to<00:00:30.599> return

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
huge swings like this trying to return

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.979 
huge swings like this trying to return
serves<00:00:31.970> what<00:00:32.970> you<00:00:33.060> want<00:00:33.239> to<00:00:33.329> do<00:00:33.450> on<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:33.690> return

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989

serves what you want to do on the return
of<00:00:34.019> serve<00:00:34.379> is<00:00:34.620> you<00:00:34.710> want<00:00:34.859> to<00:00:34.920> have<00:00:35.039> a<00:00:35.070> short

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
of serve is you want to have a short

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.520 
of serve is you want to have a short
compact<00:00:35.940> motion<00:00:36.210> so<00:00:36.570> you<00:00:36.600> go<00:00:36.809> into<00:00:37.019> your<00:00:37.140> split

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
compact motion so you go into your split

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.889 
compact motion so you go into your split
step<00:00:37.859> you<00:00:38.370> turn<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:38.879> upper<00:00:39.120> body<00:00:39.329> there's

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
step you turn the upper body there's

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.410 
step you turn the upper body there's
very<00:00:40.289> little<00:00:40.559> backswing<00:00:41.219> and<00:00:41.429> then<00:00:42.030> you<00:00:42.210> just

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
very little backswing and then you just

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.729 
very little backswing and then you just
go<00:00:42.629> like<00:00:42.660> that<00:00:43.079> a<00:00:43.109> very<00:00:43.289> short<00:00:44.070> compact<00:00:44.760> motion

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:45.739 
go like that a very short compact motion

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:49.340 
go like that a very short compact motion
of<00:00:46.739> course<00:00:47.640> when<00:00:47.969> you<00:00:48.179> are<00:00:48.210> returning<00:00:48.839> a<00:00:49.019> very

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
of course when you are returning a very

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.250 
of course when you are returning a very
slow<00:00:49.739> serve<00:00:50.129> like<00:00:50.550> a<00:00:50.579> second<00:00:51.059> serve<00:00:51.300> you<00:00:51.960> take

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
slow serve like a second serve you take

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.979 
slow serve like a second serve you take
a<00:00:52.440> bit<00:00:53.010> of<00:00:53.249> a<00:00:53.339> bigger<00:00:53.550> swing<00:00:53.820> but<00:00:54.629> that<00:00:54.780> being

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
a bit of a bigger swing but that being

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.200 
a bit of a bigger swing but that being
said<00:00:55.079> on<00:00:55.559> any<00:00:55.890> good<00:00:56.219> ground<00:00:56.579> stroke<00:00:56.969> you're

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
said on any good ground stroke you're

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.509 
said on any good ground stroke you're
going<00:00:57.329> to<00:00:57.390> have<00:00:57.570> a<00:00:57.600> short<00:00:58.050> compact<00:00:58.499> motion<00:00:58.980> so

00:00:59.509 --> 00:00:59.519 
going to have a short compact motion so

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:01.910 
going to have a short compact motion so
you<00:00:59.550> will<00:00:59.969> never<00:01:00.179> really<00:01:00.780> take<00:01:01.079> a<00:01:01.109> huge<00:01:01.589> swing

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
you will never really take a huge swing

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.399 
you will never really take a huge swing
like<00:01:02.219> this<00:01:02.249> if<00:01:02.820> you<00:01:03.359> have<00:01:03.480> a<00:01:03.510> good<00:01:03.719> forehand<00:01:04.230> or

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
like this if you have a good forehand or

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.650 
like this if you have a good forehand or
a<00:01:04.470> good<00:01:04.949> backhand<00:01:05.220> and<00:01:05.700> that's<00:01:06.270> what's<00:01:06.510> so

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:06.660 
a good backhand and that's what's so

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:08.570 
a good backhand and that's what's so
important<00:01:07.080> on<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.230> return<00:01:07.620> of<00:01:07.650> serve<00:01:07.950> let's

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
important on the return of serve let's

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.400 
important on the return of serve let's
take<00:01:08.820> a<00:01:08.850> look<00:01:09.150> at<00:01:09.390> a<00:01:09.420> super<00:01:09.990> slow-motion

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:10.410 
take a look at a super slow-motion

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:14.150 
take a look at a super slow-motion
comparison<00:01:11.750> okay<00:01:12.750> here<00:01:13.230> you<00:01:13.320> will<00:01:13.470> see<00:01:13.770> me<00:01:13.950> hit

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:14.160 
comparison okay here you will see me hit

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.670 
comparison okay here you will see me hit
two<00:01:14.460> different<00:01:14.970> forehand<00:01:15.540> returns<00:01:16.140> of<00:01:16.410> serve

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
two different forehand returns of serve

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.770 
two different forehand returns of serve
on<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.220> left<00:01:17.460> I<00:01:17.670> will<00:01:17.700> take<00:01:17.970> a<00:01:18.150> very<00:01:18.450> large

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
on the left I will take a very large

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.170 
on the left I will take a very large
backswing<00:01:19.530> and<00:01:19.740> on<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:20.010> right<00:01:20.250> I<00:01:20.580> will<00:01:21.030> keep

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
backswing and on the right I will keep

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.660 
backswing and on the right I will keep
it<00:01:21.360> short<00:01:21.390> and<00:01:21.870> compact<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:23.130> way<00:01:23.310> that<00:01:23.550> it

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
it short and compact the way that it

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.610 
it short and compact the way that it
should<00:01:23.700> be<00:01:23.940> executed<00:01:24.480> take<00:01:25.110> a<00:01:25.140> look<00:01:25.410> right

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:25.620 
should be executed take a look right

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:33.170 
should be executed take a look right
here<00:01:30.410> let's<00:01:31.410> take<00:01:31.620> a<00:01:31.650> look<00:01:32.010> now<00:01:32.040> at<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:32.910> most

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
here let's take a look now at the most

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.060 
here let's take a look now at the most
important<00:01:33.750> elements<00:01:34.230> and<00:01:34.380> slow<00:01:34.650> things<00:01:34.950> down

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
important elements and slow things down

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.480 
important elements and slow things down
even<00:01:35.820> further<00:01:36.560> now<00:01:37.560> on<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:37.860> left<00:01:38.130> you<00:01:38.340> will

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
even further now on the left you will

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.390 
even further now on the left you will
see<00:01:38.520> that<00:01:39.000> I<00:01:39.330> do<00:01:39.390> a<00:01:39.690> big<00:01:40.170> movement<00:01:40.530> with<00:01:40.920> my<00:01:41.160> arm

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
see that I do a big movement with my arm

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.850 
see that I do a big movement with my arm
and<00:01:41.730> on<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.210> right<00:01:42.450> my<00:01:42.720> arm<00:01:42.960> barely<00:01:43.470> moves<00:01:43.710> at

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
and on the right my arm barely moves at

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.190 
and on the right my arm barely moves at
all<00:01:44.010> so<00:01:44.250> I've<00:01:44.340> turned<00:01:44.670> my<00:01:44.910> upper<00:01:45.210> body<00:01:45.360> and<00:01:45.750> the

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
all so I've turned my upper body and the

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.290 
all so I've turned my upper body and the
arm<00:01:46.410> just<00:01:46.740> comes<00:01:47.070> along<00:01:47.370> for<00:01:47.730> the<00:01:47.820> ride<00:01:48.030> and

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:48.300 
arm just comes along for the ride and

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:53.970 
arm just comes along for the ride and
then<00:01:48.450> ends<00:01:48.870> up<00:01:48.960> in<00:01:49.200> this<00:01:49.760> position

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:53.980 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:57.010 

that<00:01:54.980> big<00:01:55.280> swing<00:01:55.610> on<00:01:55.760> the<00:01:55.880> left<00:01:56.150> results<00:01:56.840> in<00:01:56.930> a

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
that big swing on the left results in a

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.170 
that big swing on the left results in a
contact<00:01:57.530> point<00:01:57.830> that<00:01:58.010> is<00:01:58.130> too<00:01:58.370> late<00:01:58.670> as<00:01:58.970> you

00:01:59.170 --> 00:01:59.180 
contact point that is too late as you

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.570 
contact point that is too late as you
can<00:01:59.330> see<00:01:59.570> right<00:01:59.810> here<00:01:59.870> and<00:02:00.410> also<00:02:01.130> I<00:02:01.160> cannot

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:06.440 
you can see that my weight transfers

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.770 
you can see that my weight transfers
forward<00:02:07.160> and<00:02:07.370> diagonally<00:02:07.610> into<00:02:08.540> the<00:02:08.630> court

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
bigger but the swing should definitely

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.319 
bigger but the swing should definitely
