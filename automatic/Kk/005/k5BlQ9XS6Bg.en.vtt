00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:04.489 
prototypes this is not actually the

retail<00:03:04.850> version<00:03:05.030> yet<00:03:06.820> anyhow<00:03:07.820> good<00:03:08.630> at<00:03:08.750> this

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
retail version yet anyhow good at this

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.070 
retail version yet anyhow good at this
battery<00:03:09.440> in<00:03:09.620> so<00:03:09.830> let<00:03:09.980> me<00:03:10.040> install<00:03:10.310> that<00:03:10.670> and

games to check it out I'm quite sure I

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:25.240

out<00:04:14.840> all<00:04:14.990> the<00:04:15.110> buttons<00:04:15.410> now<00:04:15.560> they<00:04:15.770> seem<00:04:16.010> to

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:16.160 
out all the buttons now they seem to

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:20.620 
out all the buttons now they seem to
work<00:04:16.760> pretty<00:04:16.790> well<00:04:18.820> too<00:04:19.820> bad<00:04:19.940> I<00:04:20.030> can't<00:04:20.150> play

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:20.630 
work pretty well too bad I can't play

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:27.510 
work pretty well too bad I can't play
very<00:04:20.810> well<00:04:22.390> anyhow<00:04:23.950> let's<00:04:25.090> switch<00:04:26.090> this<00:04:26.300> off

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520 
very well anyhow let's switch this off

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:34.420 
very well anyhow let's switch this off
try<00:04:28.520> a<00:04:29.260> different<00:04:30.260> game<00:04:32.320> now<00:04:33.320> if<00:04:33.620> any<00:04:34.040> of<00:04:34.220> you

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:34.430 
try a different game now if any of you

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:38.860 
try a different game now if any of you
fans<00:04:34.850> out<00:04:35.150> there<00:04:35.500> have<00:04:36.500> the<00:04:36.680> FC<00:04:37.130> mobile<00:04:37.870> you'll

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:38.870 
fans out there have the FC mobile you'll

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:40.360 
fans out there have the FC mobile you'll

notice in the SE mobile that the game

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:43.270 
notice in the SE mobile that the game
carts<00:04:40.760> are<00:04:40.880> very<00:04:41.120> tight<00:04:41.450> into<00:04:42.050> the<00:04:42.230> unit<00:04:42.650> a

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:43.280 
carts are very tight into the unit a

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.340 
carts are very tight into the unit a
little<00:04:43.850> bit<00:04:43.940> of<00:04:44.030> the<00:04:44.090> same<00:04:44.300> syndrome<00:04:44.660> going<00:04:45.169> on

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:45.350 
little bit of the same syndrome going on

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.850 
little bit of the same syndrome going on
here

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:45.860 
here

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:49.750 
here
kind<00:04:46.400> of<00:04:46.610> kind<00:04:47.060> of<00:04:47.150> tight<00:04:47.390> in<00:04:47.419> there<00:04:48.760> but

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:49.760 
kind of kind of tight in there but

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:52.500 
kind of kind of tight in there but
better<00:04:50.180> tight<00:04:50.540> than<00:04:50.750> Toulouse<00:04:51.110> I<00:04:51.290> would<00:04:51.440> guess

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:52.510 
better tight than Toulouse I would guess

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:59.999 
better tight than Toulouse I would guess
let's<00:04:53.510> try<00:04:53.810> some<00:04:54.370> Donkey<00:04:55.370> Kong<00:04:55.520> Country

00:04:59.999 --> 00:05:00.009 

00:05:00.009 --> 00:05:04.029 

so<00:05:01.210> volumes<00:05:02.210> turned<00:05:02.449> all<00:05:02.570> the<00:05:02.630> way<00:05:02.720> up<00:05:03.039> it's

00:05:04.029 --> 00:05:04.039 
so volumes turned all the way up it's

00:05:04.039 --> 00:05:06.100 
so volumes turned all the way up it's
not<00:05:04.160> exactly<00:05:04.820> super<00:05:05.449> loud<00:05:05.570> but<00:05:05.840> it's<00:05:05.930> not

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:06.110 
not exactly super loud but it's not

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:24.240 
not exactly super loud but it's not
quiet<00:05:06.500> either

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:24.250 

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:26.589 

all<00:05:25.250> right<00:05:25.400> let's<00:05:25.639> check<00:05:25.880> out<00:05:26.030> a<00:05:26.060> little<00:05:26.330> super

00:05:26.589 --> 00:05:26.599 
all right let's check out a little super

00:05:26.599 --> 00:06:08.250 
all right let's check out a little super
Star<00:05:26.870> Wars<00:05:27.169> see<00:05:27.830> how<00:05:27.919> that<00:05:28.130> looks<00:05:28.370> on<00:05:28.550> here

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:08.260 

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:11.440 

hmm<00:06:09.260> now<00:06:10.190> the<00:06:10.250> angle<00:06:10.760> I'm<00:06:10.850> holding<00:06:11.180> this<00:06:11.270> it's

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:11.450 
hmm now the angle I'm holding this it's

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:14.170 
hmm now the angle I'm holding this it's
kind<00:06:11.630> of<00:06:11.660> hard<00:06:11.840> to<00:06:11.870> see<00:06:12.080> what's<00:06:12.260> going<00:06:12.440> on<00:06:13.180> so

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:14.180 
kind of hard to see what's going on so

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:18.330 
kind of hard to see what's going on so
needless<00:06:14.870> to<00:06:14.930> say<00:06:15.020> I'm<00:06:15.260> not<00:06:15.350> doing<00:06:15.500> very<00:06:15.650> well

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:18.340 

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:25.500 

but<00:06:20.530> the<00:06:21.530> game<00:06:21.710> works<00:06:21.950> and<00:06:22.310> it<00:06:22.670> looks<00:06:22.820> nice<00:06:23.090> so

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:25.510 

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:29.710 

I<00:06:26.510> guess<00:06:26.810> what<00:06:27.050> more<00:06:27.230> could<00:06:27.320> you<00:06:27.380> ask<00:06:27.500> for<00:06:28.720> now

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:29.720 
I guess what more could you ask for now

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:32.650 
I guess what more could you ask for now
let's<00:06:29.930> take<00:06:30.140> a<00:06:30.200> closer<00:06:30.740> look<00:06:30.890> at<00:06:31.310> this<00:06:31.660> unit

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:32.660 
let's take a closer look at this unit

pretty solid unit I'm pretty happy with
the<00:07:48.860> prototype<00:07:49.370> here<00:07:49.700> and<00:07:50.240> I<00:07:50.720> can't<00:07:50.960> wait<00:07:51.110> to

the prototype here and I can't wait to

00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:54.720 
the prototype here and I can't wait to
get<00:07:51.770> them<00:07:51.920> in<00:07:52.040> stock<00:07:52.160> I<00:07:52.990> guess<00:07:53.990> this<00:07:54.170> is<00:07:54.320> the
