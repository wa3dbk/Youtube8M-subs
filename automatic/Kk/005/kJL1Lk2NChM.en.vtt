00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:17.740 
those things and I've never seemed to
have<00:06:16.520> many<00:06:16.729> problems<00:06:16.909> throughout<00:06:17.389> any<00:06:17.659> of

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:17.750 
have many problems throughout any of

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:18.730 
have many problems throughout any of
these<00:06:17.810> flights<00:06:18.110> and<00:06:18.259> this<00:06:18.380> was<00:06:18.500> the<00:06:18.590> longest

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:18.740 
these flights and this was the longest

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:23.939 
these flights and this was the longest
one<00:06:19.130> so<00:06:20.229> you<00:06:21.229> know<00:06:21.349> I<00:06:21.380> just<00:06:21.530> may<00:06:22.130> change<00:06:22.370> 85<00:06:22.880> but

00:06:23.939 --> 00:06:23.949 
one so you know I just may change 85 but

00:06:23.949 --> 00:06:27.779 
one so you know I just may change 85 but
in<00:06:24.949> efficiency<00:06:25.610> with<00:06:25.849> holy<00:06:26.289> was<00:06:27.289> pretty<00:06:27.470> good

00:06:27.779 --> 00:06:27.789 
in efficiency with holy was pretty good

00:06:27.789 --> 00:06:35.770 
in efficiency with holy was pretty good
at<00:06:28.789> least<00:06:28.940> in<00:06:29.120> these<00:06:29.270> cases<00:06:34.300> like<00:06:35.300> I<00:06:35.419> said<00:06:35.599> now

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:35.780 
at least in these cases like I said now

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:47.839 
at least in these cases like I said now
he's<00:06:35.960> just<00:06:36.139> out<00:06:36.259> of<00:06:36.380> mana<00:06:36.590> so<00:06:36.889> it's<00:06:37.280> over

00:06:47.839 --> 00:06:47.849 

00:06:47.849 --> 00:06:51.889 

the<00:06:48.360> next<00:06:48.599> one<00:06:48.749> isn't<00:06:48.959> a<00:06:49.490> duel<00:06:50.490> it<00:06:51.270> was<00:06:51.629> in<00:06:51.809> a

00:06:51.889 --> 00:06:51.899 
the next one isn't a duel it was in a

00:06:51.899 --> 00:06:53.629 
the next one isn't a duel it was in a
battleground<00:06:52.229> but<00:06:52.949> it<00:06:53.159> just<00:06:53.309> kind<00:06:53.550> of<00:06:53.580> shows

00:06:53.629 --> 00:06:53.639 
battleground but it just kind of shows

00:06:53.639 --> 00:06:56.929 
battleground but it just kind of shows
you<00:06:53.999> how<00:06:54.149> much<00:06:54.360> damage<00:06:54.809> you<00:06:55.110> can<00:06:55.229> put<00:06:55.409> out<00:06:55.939> with

00:06:56.929 --> 00:06:56.939 
you how much damage you can put out with

00:06:56.939 --> 00:06:59.600 
you how much damage you can put out with
these<00:06:57.059> new<00:06:57.209> things<00:06:57.270> I<00:06:57.809> mean<00:06:58.309> start<00:06:59.309> off<00:06:59.399> with

00:06:59.600 --> 00:06:59.610 
these new things I mean start off with

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:04.699 
these new things I mean start off with
the<00:06:59.639> dots<00:06:59.969> and<00:07:01.819> holy<00:07:02.819> fire<00:07:03.119> into<00:07:03.839> a<00:07:04.169> Holy<00:07:04.559> Word

00:07:04.699 --> 00:07:04.709 
the dots and holy fire into a Holy Word

00:07:04.709 --> 00:07:07.219 
the dots and holy fire into a Holy Word
chastise<00:07:05.219> and<00:07:05.610> then<00:07:06.089> a<00:07:06.119> smite<00:07:06.539> into<00:07:06.929> a<00:07:06.959> shadow

00:07:07.219 --> 00:07:07.229 
chastise and then a smite into a shadow

00:07:07.229 --> 00:07:09.079 
chastise and then a smite into a shadow
where<00:07:07.439> death<00:07:07.619> and<00:07:07.800> his<00:07:08.219> Health's<00:07:08.490> gone<00:07:08.669> this

00:07:09.079 --> 00:07:09.089 
where death and his Health's gone this

00:07:09.089 --> 00:07:14.109 
where death and his Health's gone this
prep<00:07:09.300> palette<00:07:09.569> instead<00:07:11.059> that's<00:07:12.059> all<00:07:12.209> it<00:07:12.300> took

00:07:14.109 --> 00:07:14.119 
prep palette instead that's all it took

00:07:14.119 --> 00:07:18.230 
prep palette instead that's all it took
so<00:07:15.119> anyways<00:07:15.599> there's<00:07:15.899> a<00:07:15.990> few<00:07:16.139> duels<00:07:17.119> you<00:07:18.119> know

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:18.240 
so anyways there's a few duels you know

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:20.480 
so anyways there's a few duels you know
obviously<00:07:18.419> like<00:07:18.749> I<00:07:18.869> said<00:07:19.110> not<00:07:19.409> level<00:07:19.709> 85<00:07:20.069> so

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:20.490 
obviously like I said not level 85 so

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:23.889 
obviously like I said not level 85 so
we'll<00:07:20.849> see<00:07:21.029> what<00:07:21.119> happens<00:07:21.300> in<00:07:21.689> the<00:07:21.749> future<00:07:22.759> but

00:07:23.889 --> 00:07:23.899 
we'll see what happens in the future but

00:07:23.899 --> 00:07:25.850 
we'll see what happens in the future but
things<00:07:24.899> are<00:07:25.050> looking<00:07:25.139> pretty<00:07:25.379> good<00:07:25.619> right<00:07:25.679> now

00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:25.860 
things are looking pretty good right now

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:27.949 
things are looking pretty good right now
so<00:07:26.519> I<00:07:26.580> think<00:07:26.759> I'll<00:07:27.089> continue<00:07:27.479> to<00:07:27.629> try<00:07:27.899> this

00:07:27.949 --> 00:07:27.959 
so I think I'll continue to try this

00:07:27.959 --> 00:07:30.589 
so I think I'll continue to try this
throughout<00:07:28.769> Cataclysm<00:07:29.669> and<00:07:29.819> just<00:07:30.330> see<00:07:30.479> how<00:07:30.509> it

00:07:30.589 --> 00:07:30.599 
throughout Cataclysm and just see how it

00:07:30.599 --> 00:07:34.699 
throughout Cataclysm and just see how it
goes<00:07:31.369> so<00:07:32.369> if<00:07:32.939> you<00:07:33.119> what<00:07:34.080> if<00:07:34.319> you<00:07:34.409> liked<00:07:34.559> this
