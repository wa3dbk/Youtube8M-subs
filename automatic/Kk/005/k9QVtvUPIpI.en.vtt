landfill you know recycling every 15 to

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.540 
landfill you know recycling every 15 to
20<00:00:31.260> years<00:00:31.439> like<00:00:31.590> you<00:00:31.740> would<00:00:31.859> an<00:00:31.949> asphalt<00:00:32.279> based

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
20 years like you would an asphalt based

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.580 
20 years like you would an asphalt based
product<00:00:33.030> also<00:00:33.510> the<00:00:33.750> Sun<00:00:33.960> can't<00:00:34.200> wear<00:00:34.350> it<00:00:34.469> out

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
product also the Sun can't wear it out

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.200 
product also the Sun can't wear it out
like<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:34.920> asphalt<00:00:35.309> and<00:00:35.579> it's<00:00:35.880> energy

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
like the asphalt and it's energy

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.560 
like the asphalt and it's energy
efficient<00:00:36.860> it's<00:00:37.860> very<00:00:38.100> energy<00:00:38.489> efficient<00:00:38.940> has

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
efficient it's very energy efficient has

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.690 
efficient it's very energy efficient has
an<00:00:39.719> airspace<00:00:40.170> under<00:00:40.559> it<00:00:40.680> so<00:00:41.160> that<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.370> hot<00:00:41.520> air

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
an airspace under it so that the hot air

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.549 
an airspace under it so that the hot air
can<00:00:41.850> escape<00:00:41.910> without<00:00:42.899> coming<00:00:43.170> into<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.410> house

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
can escape without coming into the house

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.790 
can escape without coming into the house
so<00:00:43.590> it<00:00:43.860> has<00:00:44.030> 30%<00:00:45.030> less<00:00:45.210> heat<00:00:45.510> transfer<00:00:46.079> so

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
so it has 30% less heat transfer so

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.290 
so it has 30% less heat transfer so
clients<00:00:47.340> we<00:00:47.430> put<00:00:47.610> these<00:00:47.730> on<00:00:47.910> four<00:00:48.120> have

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
particular that's a good question I

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.520 
particular that's a good question I
think<00:01:08.700> what<00:01:09.090> we<00:01:09.180> really<00:01:09.210> focus<00:01:09.750> on<00:01:09.900> is<00:01:10.140> being<00:01:10.320> a

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
think what we really focus on is being a

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.679 
think what we really focus on is being a

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
now or five years from now our goal is

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.700 
now or five years from now our goal is
not<00:01:18.060> to<00:01:18.240> just<00:01:18.570> sell<00:01:18.810> them<00:01:18.990> something<00:01:19.229> is<00:01:19.530> to

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
not to just sell them something is to

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.530 
not to just sell them something is to
find<00:01:19.920> out<00:01:20.040> what<00:01:20.189> solution<00:01:20.700> best<00:01:21.180> fits<00:01:21.390> their

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
find out what solution best fits their

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.499 
find out what solution best fits their
home<00:01:21.780> give<00:01:22.740> them<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.070> information<00:01:23.220> and<00:01:23.790> then

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
home give them the information and then

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.390 
home give them the information and then
they<00:01:24.930> can<00:01:25.080> use<00:01:25.259> that<00:01:25.380> information<00:01:25.560> to<00:01:25.979> make<00:01:26.340> a

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
they can use that information to make a

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.090 
they can use that information to make a
decision<00:01:26.610> based<00:01:27.299> on<00:01:27.509> information<00:01:28.350> rather

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
decision based on information rather

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.550 
decision based on information rather
than<00:01:29.220> speculation<00:01:29.790> and<00:01:30.060> so<00:01:30.689> we<00:01:31.290> like<00:01:31.439> just

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
than speculation and so we like just

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.640 
than speculation and so we like just
provide<00:01:31.890> that<00:01:31.920> information<00:01:33.439> now<00:01:34.439> we<00:01:34.470> were

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
provide that information now we were

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:35.840 
provide that information now we were
here<00:01:34.799> last<00:01:34.950> year<00:01:35.070> our<00:01:35.310> first<00:01:35.430> year<00:01:35.640> was<00:01:35.729> last

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
here last year our first year was last
