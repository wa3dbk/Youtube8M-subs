00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:05.819
 I do not quite understand how we got here where 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.069
 on for vram because you wanted to go 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.380
 to the space department first on the elevator 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.740
 then sand the stairs and 8 somehow 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.289
 miracle in quali here are dinosaurs and dinosaurs 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.310
 skeleton 

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:18.119
 here we actually went to 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.010
 space 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:25.880
 department here in this big dome of sar 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.880
 which previous videos even showed 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:33.009
 back further 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.009
 come on this 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:40.770
 Now imagine what to do 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.270
 express not think okay 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:54.560
 here no one is can not work 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.560
 it should work 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:02.930
 bar time talking okay other places 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:05.030
 working elsewhere decree later 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:07.540
 water let on that country 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.540
 So 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.560
 dinosaur it there big skeletons such 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.630
 healthy 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.320
 acts 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.320
 we will go there 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.250
 from what to clam 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.829
 fine 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.829
 prayed there 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:39.130
 here's a shard head 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:41.659
 here i come who you on wrex 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:47.710
 strain but 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:47.710
 his brain is a little red world 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.259
 so start with the end of the tail so that's me 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.030
 naval ways such tonic tonics 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:01.429
 more and more and the skeleton was just about 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.429
 we have it ready 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.340
 it is written here 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.640
 ok 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.360
 using gathered 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:22.660
 tells and and then we will listen 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.660
 dinosaurs egg 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:29.130
 live it plaster 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.130
 solus 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:35.849
 to deputies and to radiate 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:43.670
 head small body is generally healthy and but 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.400
 such in the forest you will see our time 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.670
 probably afraid that if it is fair and that 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.930
 Who 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:57.980
 And this is the archosaurus of such a small 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:03:00.280
 the size of your head can bite off so let's go 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.280
 farther 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:12.040
 then we see again the skulls are different 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:13.330
 us diplodocus mangus saurus mosquito gives 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.500
 hotel name 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:16.500
 And who is this 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:21.310
 here and asari devices no krasin 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:25.269
 gentis 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:29.250
 these are some latin names like that 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:29.250
 came up with something not in Russian name 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:37.190
 and here is this monster dinosaur here is a picture 

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:41.920
 here is his skeleton probably just a cat 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:45.840
 the skeleton that was in the picture was the year means 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:48.980
 well, the main part will be 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:04:04.580
 the second part will most likely be about 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:04:07.080
 space section work fine 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:10.370
 talking about these things about it 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:10.370
 dinosaur which you are a cube 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:19.389
 cool 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:22.870
 who can be too lazy to read 

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:25.870
 korn ozols royal 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:29.980
 tyrannosaurus 4 of latin 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:34.290
 I do not know give all that 

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:36.820
 in here he plopped on the ground tight there 

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:39.190
 probably fell from the cliff as it sends so 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:41.620
 head straight all back straight mermaid 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:43.330
 Of course, but what to do here is the same 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:43.630
 so much was probably running away from here from 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:46.780
 of this 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:50.800
 tyrannosaurus is not it means that this 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:54.100
 cerato for urs on axis and its eaves until 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:05:00.100
 here it is this skull i will say 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:05:08.280
 and things plowed now once again dive for 

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:13.870
 souls rigs to nothing 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:15.220
 clearly pH and defenses do not remember so well here 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:18.120
 what have we got 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:21.389
 here we have too 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:24.930
 who was fed by whom? 

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:27.750
 ran off just such a stand here but rather 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:32.940
 still interesting let's go further on 

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:35.520
 there are 40 of us skeletons again 

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:38.010
 told as a result of archaeological 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:44.550
 excavations are underway 

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:47.930
 why do they get here some 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:50.520
 the lab is leading me somewhere 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:06:00.080
 door exit 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:06:03.740
 it is not clear how such a fact that the skeleton 

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:03.740
 what to pass he 

00:06:03.949 --> 00:06:11.719
 yes do not end nifiga yourself 

00:06:08.849 --> 00:06:14.669
 only I wanted to finish with this section 

00:06:11.719 --> 00:06:15.590
 heavenly this dinosaur so here more and more 

00:06:14.669 --> 00:06:19.289
 more became 

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:22.849
 here are some parts you can shoot 

00:06:19.289 --> 00:06:27.599
 only the edges of the tone of the skeletons of dinosaurs 

00:06:22.849 --> 00:06:30.509
 various general nightmare really on 

00:06:27.599 --> 00:06:32.550
 this museum needs a lot of time to kill 

00:06:30.509 --> 00:06:34.740
 only one department probably goes the whole 

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:35.250
 wow day don't you see how many turtles 

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:43.500
 stupid 

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:45.750
 straight generally straight all this here it 

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:48.810
 lizard sense is a small lizard for those 

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:51.240
 times probably very small was then 

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:54.360
 there fish fish 

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:56.279
 Generally super teeth such bite 

00:06:54.360 --> 00:07:00.060
 not only out of his hand well, the whole entire 

00:06:56.279 --> 00:07:03.389
 probably 8 probably still ended 

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:05.939
 this section we see a snapshot then how not 

00:07:03.389 --> 00:07:08.260
 will come again here one dollar 

00:07:05.939 --> 00:07:11.290
 why not come and 

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:15.370
 and I will shoot my detail now 

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:17.200
 as if the day and this was now look 

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:19.540
 the second part the second part will be about 

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:24.130
 space and now i'm gonna go back to quiet 

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:26.220
 section here started with you was maxim 

00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:29.170
 Lasithi rock band dot ru 

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:33.750
 We subscribe and watch the second part of a 

00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:33.750
 maybe then the third all all bye
