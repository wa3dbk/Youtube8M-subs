world very often anymore and that's okay
but<00:00:54.070> I<00:00:54.129> hope<00:00:54.399> you'll<00:00:54.640> stop<00:00:54.969> from<00:00:55.359> time<00:00:55.390> to<00:00:55.840> time

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:55.870 
but I hope you'll stop from time to time

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:58.709 
but I hope you'll stop from time to time
and<00:00:56.680> take<00:00:56.920> a<00:00:56.949> look<00:00:57.190> around<00:00:57.309> you

00:00:58.709 --> 00:00:58.719 
and take a look around you

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:00.660 
and take a look around you
because<00:00:59.410> it's<00:00:59.590> the<00:00:59.739> small<00:01:00.039> things<00:01:00.399> that<00:01:00.550> are

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:00.670 
because it's the small things that are

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:05.850 
because it's the small things that are
worth<00:01:00.969> the<00:01:01.180> most<00:01:03.900> feel<00:01:04.900> the<00:01:05.110> grass<00:01:05.350> beneath

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:05.860 
worth the most feel the grass beneath

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.320 
worth the most feel the grass beneath
your<00:01:06.159> feet<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:07.900> sky<00:01:08.200> above<00:01:08.500> you<00:01:08.740> and<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:10.150> air
