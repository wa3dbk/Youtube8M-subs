00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:12.600
 what do you want if something is 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:17.010

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.240

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:25.600
 Cios or not 

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:27.910
 I did not even want to do this myself 

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:32.830
 I wanted to play microsoft 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:35.980

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:40.230
 environment where state been this but 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:40.230
 they told us what they wanted to touch 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:50.050
 to work they wanted to see us 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.050
 well this is my face 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:58.530
 once and nothing more 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.949
 what do you want me to say we love something 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.949
 of your life 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.720

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.350
 people love or pressures 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:26.180
 it does not do anything else 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.509
 I have no reason to keep talking 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:35.549
 I'm just waiting for 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:35.549
 turn off the camera to be able to leave here 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:44.710

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:44.710
 pleasure but I got bored goodbye 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:02:00.200
