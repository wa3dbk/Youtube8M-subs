00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.819
 the next loquendo extracted to you 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.890
 thanks to the new apple tablet now 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:11.040
 if there is no excuse for not having 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:13.980
 good people from youtube here river 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.049
 x tit this time I bring you a 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.380
 video of the video games that in my 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.270
 opinion are the most difficult in the world 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:23.279
 that 's the way of those games that in some 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.119
 At any given moment they piss you off and you finish 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.119
 doing this 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:41.829
 the download links of all these 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:45.629
 games are in the video description 

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:45.629
 good let's start 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.040
 the difficulty of kite are mario world not 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:55.810
 lies properly in its difficulty and 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:58.090
 that with the emulator you can reduce the 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:01.090
 speed and use automatic recordings 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:04.630
 not the difficulty of leaving graphics in 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:06.490
 frustrating you and moving forward in the 

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:08.590
 first level I will have sent the demon to 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:10.990
 game about nine times but I was still 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:12.970
 advancing to the boxer castle of 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:16.110
 which I will not tell you anything for not 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:16.110
 ruin him is the end 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:23.550
 super mario bros 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:27.420
 you are a hack to demand your reflexes 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:29.820
 the most annoying thing about this game 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:33.420
 is to have a single life so if it dies 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:35.340
 your progress is going to the devil if you have 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:39.380
 Several friends can challenge not to know 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.380
 who advances more in this damn game 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:47.720
 to America came this super mariobros 2 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:50.560
 but in Japan a game was sold 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.810
 completely different 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.820
 what attracts the attention of this 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.130
 game is that for the first time we find 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:59.350
 differences between mario and luigi mario 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:01.210
 Jump less high and is simpler to use 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.460
 so it is recommended for 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.530
 novice players while luigi is 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:09.060
 a little more complicated so it is 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.060
 for experienced players 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.200
 yes 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:36.620
 what pisses me off most of the game is 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.620
 this 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.700
 no no 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.480
 and 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:26.360
 and you 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:39.260
 Y 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:48.190
 if you do not have an emulator to play 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:50.110
 these games in the description also 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:52.060
 he left several nes emulators and super 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:54.690
 nesses that support all systems 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:54.690
 operational 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:05.890
 a game whose title is not understood as a 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:09.370
 so fuck you simply 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:11.770
 called bulls or aunts enjoy it in your 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:14.560
 childhood of super mario bros I know it will be 

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:16.239
 very difficult not to fall into their traps what 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:18.370
 what I value most about this game is its 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:22.360
 simplicity that reminds games 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:25.050
 Nintendo classics in the 80s 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.050
 yes 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:40.180
 and now a couple of maps for warcraft 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:48.650
 You are a retard if you lose what you are and 

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:51.050
 if you win you are not a theme 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:53.570
 apparently simple but this game does not 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:55.250
 is what seems to challenge your logic and 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:57.160
 on more than one occasion you will stay 

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:59.530
 locked 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.640
 if you easily get upset when you die for 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:02.860
 crap 

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:04.930
 then do not play this map since 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:07.570
 all the ways for you to die are 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:10.140
 stupid and each one is stupider than 

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:10.140
 the previous one 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:15.360
 a pretty similar game is a map 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:17.970
 stupid and its sequel a stupid map 2 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:20.069
 only this time our character will be 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:22.500
 patricio star and the map will be much 

00:05:20.069 --> 00:05:24.569
 the longest the links of all these 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:27.979
 games are in the video description 

00:05:24.569 --> 00:05:27.979
 so to play 

00:05:33.319 --> 00:05:38.009
 as an extra I leave the link to download 

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:41.220
 the beautiful raffle of the presentation of the 

00:05:38.009 --> 00:05:44.389
 VideoX of tablets you do not like it 

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:44.389
 I also leave the one on an iphone
