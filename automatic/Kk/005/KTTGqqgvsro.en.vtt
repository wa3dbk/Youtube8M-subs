00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:04.290
 hello and welcome my name 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:07.200
 is serious and today there is a small one 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.610
 nikolaus special course for the sixth 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.340
 december and the whole thing will only be accurate 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.049
 it's like this for a day 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.549
 small little sweepstake I have mine 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.520
 at the moment, everyone is really popping 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.470
 big channels things out to go 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.220
 not anymore and I have something for you here 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.350
 prepared 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:26.400
 With friendly support from 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.750
 ubisoft and indeed empty carton so and 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.429
 so that he has not left completely empty 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.960
 I thought we pack from a few 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.759
 things in, I have to stop one 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.309
 little bit over and I thought 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.600
 maybe everybody is in the mood 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.829
 it let's start so different short 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.050
 should keep in the camera 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.149
 Actually, they are totally cool 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.040
 Christmas video will be with snow and 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.899
 Elves that I would have rented and so on 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.510
 I figured that we could get it too 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:53.300
 somehow different than the first time we 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:56.340
 best keep that up here 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:01:00.030
 First of all, 3 t shirt in white creed that 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.829
 here comes in the box ina and then 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.129
 there's again directly fitting to synonymous 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:07.080
 again a model in dark blue me 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.330
 had to practice with the camera 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.450
 dark blue assassin's creed 3 t shirt 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.860
 that's what you get in the carton as well 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.070
 then quite funny when a girlfriend have 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:20.250
 then there is also a ubisoft just 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:23.549
 dance t shirt in current neon colors 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:26.460
 to hop off it also comes in the 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:28.530
 cardboard in apology 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.780
 So then a little something bloody 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.060
 maybe for halloween or something like that 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.500
 might very well find such a 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.860
 a bit of a blood smeared 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:41.400
 that's just a t-shirt 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:45.299
 zombie the current shooter from the 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:48.630
 home ubisoft to view then I have 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:50.790
 here you may know it 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.259
 is the logo of far cry 3 if you like that 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.500
 I've always seen it so 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:57.719
 Loading screen is a cool military 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.909
 colorful shirt with pistols on it 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:02.159
 I thought I would pack you on 3 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.630
 so I have a little petty stuff 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.250
 then I have more solid ribbons here 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.020
 from assassin's creed 3 I'll grab you 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.330
 there are two more pieces in there 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.860
 so snap the far cry 3 of the pack 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.190
 I'll have you in here then I have here 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.810
 may I have a look 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.610
 excuse me but if 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.740
 you want that anyway that's the way it is 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.570
 post-its so little notes you 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:22.370
 so stick to the wall and see them 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:23.900
 just because of why bloodstained plaster 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.590
 that was not really funny I pack 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.430
 not pure either 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.170
 then there is a small one 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.670
 keychains wiener akhs natural 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.530
 also with pure and thus then 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.760
 Finally, the thing is really warm 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:35.120
 I have also shown in the video 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:38.840

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:42.680
 purely 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.320

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:51.770
 raffle because I leave that exactly at 0 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:56.290
