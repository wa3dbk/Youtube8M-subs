00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:11.330
 I stich body 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:13.370
 she is elastic due to the fact that she 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:16.550
 covered with silicone and and strictly speaking 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:17.499
 has a core of more ethereal 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:21.470
 fibers 

00:00:17.499 --> 00:00:23.089
 cloves on this thread they are directed to 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.579
 different sides of what actually 

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:28.220
 gives very good fixation in the tissues 

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:31.039
 fundamental difference from technology 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:33.530
 which we knew so far is 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:35.719
 in that this thread it fastens in soft 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:39.070
 tissues at the expense of these teeth here 

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:41.090
 which army is much stronger 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:43.780
 fundamentally is that they 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:43.780
 form the frame 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.190
 Here we have the patient's name is Elvira 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:01:00.780
 mostly worry that he's disastrous 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:01:02.680
 folds and yes yes mostly tender 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.590
 first thing to do 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:10.200
 look yes where are the fabrics in which 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:16.000
 direction that is what we see 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:19.619
 this reduction here's who of this is how 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:23.080
 would gather no two folds see 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.700
 two folds going if in 3 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.890
 were going to say a lot that is already 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.740
 after the fourth degree 10 comprehend 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:33.929
 Now we are talking about what is just 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:37.840
 Olya 2 3 wall and then naturally there 

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:40.780
 excess dermal how would we see it 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:44.180
 flattened again by the wheel 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:47.570
 pronounced free tab 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:50.530
 but we are actually the first point 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:50.530
 make out 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:02:00.179
 tracks are marked 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:02.030
 distance between exit points here at 

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:04.709
 we will be vocals and somewhere around 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:10.200
 one and a half centimeters can be less 

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:14.720
 accordingly here in this place we 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:17.819
 you make the seals 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:20.010
 well look yes where it has all this 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:22.970
 the matter is where we will lead we 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.989
 see how she pulls up . 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:33.290
 since we will put with you 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:33.290
 the latch will do the cutter length 18 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:45.540
 we draw herbs we make two small 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:48.140
 skin puncture then we will deliver not 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:51.610
 here we will have vocals and 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:54.130
 and the second part yes where 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:57.850
 you will be suspension here this suspension 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:03:03.520
 we will let you down once we then 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:07.950
 let's get my three fifths now 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:07.950
 ideologist you make a small 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:06:38.180
