00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:11.030
 maccarone and what complexity these have 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:12.680
 damn and we've all had disasters 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:13.490
 horrible with them but good we're going to 

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:16.370
 try 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:17.690
 come look sugar icing flour 

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:20.580
 almond 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:22.200
 normal granillo sugar we have here 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.900
 two eggs how are we going to use the two 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:27.869
 clear if they are aged from 24-48 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.510
 you are better still and good coloring in 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:33.780
 gel and powder we already have the flour 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.309
 almond that we are going to make nor is this 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.320
 very important if it is closed twice 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.050
 better than a 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.190
 the icing sugar also sifting the this is 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.400
 so that he wants us surface of the 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.379
 they scored very fine good we have already had 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.519
 and we are mixing one with another good 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.170
 the eggs, as you see, I have 

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:51.570
 forgotten and it has not aged but 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.610
 well I'm telling you 24 48 hours in 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.290
 refrigerator the whites separated from the 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.570
 yolks 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:00.210
 ok now we are raising the whites 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.980
 we raise a little bit we stop and we throw 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.410
 the granillo sugar according 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.700
 we keep raising the whites this is 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:07.320
 one of the complicated tips of up 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.600
 when we are going to raise this face which 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.100
 is the snow point not exactly look 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.230
 the point is that the beige is firm 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.340
 the famous golden peak these little ones we 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:16.340
 it has to be bright 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.420
 and we can use the robot theme 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.000
 better I almost always do it in using the 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.160
 robot you look again at the parrot's beak 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.170
 this one that told you right now we integrate 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:30.330
 the solid phase remember earlier that of 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.530
 almond and sugar see with the phase 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:34.500
 humidity is what the whites are 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.990
 lifted up like we do wrapping 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.360
 no no we do not have to mix like crazy 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.190
 that is going to be something too liquid 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.740
 not carefully we will wrap with 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:45.270
 careful and someone would say good and in what 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.670
 point we leave it good because it is what 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.770
 denominates a point of lava that is to say that 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.869
 it's not too liquid or too much 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.520
 dense 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:55.799
 I believe that the image better than my 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.450
 words true good there are separate in 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.289
 two goals because there are two tonalities 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.600
 different 

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:02.520
 I insist on always mixing with coloring 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.189
 well fine powder helen never liquid 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.460
 because it's going to change the density of the 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:08.649
 mixture 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.970
 colors you want each one 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:11.980
 depending on the cream that goes to 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.330
 use better look at the pastry bag 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.100
 what I do is prevent it from 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.230
 spill what I do then it is a 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.700
 little tourniquet at the tip and 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.720
 this is curious because it is also me 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.760
 I think it's very useful 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.489
 what we do is gather all the mass and 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.560
 so we do not waste using two plates of 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:28.690
 our very very important so that the 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.980
 foot of the maccarone lift well we have 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.500
 have to have that space of heat in the 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.520
 half a template that I have too 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.620
 here at the video you can download it 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:38.080
 well at the beginning we use it so that 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.870
 so that all the macarons are more or 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:43.120
 less of the same measure then you will see 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:45.310
 that with the practice of template and nothing 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:48.060
 you get it like churros and all the same and 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:50.739
 lovely but at first this helps 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:53.140
 As you can see, it is simply the little piquito 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:54.519
 do not worry that it will disappear if 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.730
 you have done well the mixture is already 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:03:00.200
 appears pounding we get the air if not 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:02.629
 then we have warts left there 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.129
 and now we are going to let you dry one hour 

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:06.069
 or depending on a little bit of moisture 

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:08.829
 ambient 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:11.349
 generates about 150 degrees 10 12 minutes and 

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:13.499
 look great you see that the surface 

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:16.299
 smooth that no dots have remained 

00:03:13.499 --> 00:03:18.459
 perfect good now comes the theme of the 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:20.349
 impatience that I want to raise them from 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:22.329
 paper sticks and I leave you 

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:25.090
 half a half scored hooked paper 

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:26.829
 good to have peace of mind and let them 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.810
 You see a little cool has come 

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:30.969
 well surface the foot that told you of 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:32.319
 marked very important this defines a 

00:03:30.969 --> 00:03:34.870
 good marked that have a foot and then 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:36.370
 which are round and smooth the fine 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:40.000
 let's rest a little bit because if 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:42.310
 we can not screw you 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.560
 Well, here you have what we're going 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:46.480
 to do is fill them with that good 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.190
 so with what you want with a cream 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.200
 that you like rainy cream and chocolate 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:52.150
 white as you see to do the one that then 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:55.390
 a desire for white chocolate 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:56.770
 logically I heat the cream I introduce 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:59.230
 the chocolate and how the cream is already 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:02.770
 Warm chocolate and man 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:03.990
 undoes melts in the cream here what 

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:06.390
 you have 

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:09.120
 and now we 're going to let it cool down 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:12.030
 little bit so that it takes a density that 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:14.880
 let us hear fill the macaron 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:16.800
 without problems you see we put the sleeve and 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:18.750
 we put a careful amount that is not 

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:21.060
 spill on the sides that you have to 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:24.660
 to be more or less like that, there you have the 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:26.970
 sir vacaron that some call him soul 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:28.680
 bastard with that I say it quite is 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:31.230
 complicated it is complicated to do this but 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:33.870
 good you have to try it you know that 

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:36.150
 we have put a kind of clinic in 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:38.670
 the macaron in anise for cooking and you have 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:41.340
 a corner where you can see as the 

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:43.710
 most common problems look at the cocoa 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:46.140
 what a good good simply fish 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:48.360
 it will be a brown color cited the strawberry 

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:51.060
 save with the rose and inside we're going to 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:53.520
 put a strawberry cream this guess 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:56.100
 pistachio correct you have successful very 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:57.210
 rich pistachio very rich and this 

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:59.640
 cream and lemon that's the rules 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:01.950
 usual little yellow because his cream goes 

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:03.270
 of lemon good I made different 

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:05.970
 days and done here a small 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:08.160
 collection so you can see a little bit that very 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:09.729
 nice the truth is that but above all 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:12.460
 that are very very rich 

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:14.680
 I would encourage them that in the first failure 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:16.960
 do not put down that I insist that 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:19.419
 go to ice for cooking and there is a corner 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:21.339
 of the lowered what is the clinic and there 

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:24.159
 discounts like how to make them wrong more 

00:05:21.339 --> 00:05:25.809
 what comparisons to a hundred but good and 

00:05:24.159 --> 00:05:27.550
 you will see that there is complexity as they are 

00:05:25.809 --> 00:05:30.550
 so I think that seeing why the 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:33.009
 is going to help you pretty much encouraged 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:36.300
 this recipe is complicated and come 

00:05:33.009 --> 00:05:36.300
 friends, hello, see you
