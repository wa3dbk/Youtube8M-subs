00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:08.100
Welcome to "Is it a Good Idea to 
 Microwave This?" I'm your host, Jory Caron.

00:00:08.777 --> 00:00:17.777
Today, folks, is a special day. It's Martin Luther King's birthday! And in 
 honor of that, we had a light donated by BLH Productions.

00:00:17.667 --> 00:00:19.667
It's an African-American light, so...

00:00:19.333 --> 00:00:21.333
Jon: Jory, don't you mean "black light"?

00:00:21.767 --> 00:00:31.767
Uh, no, they actually don't like to be called that. It's just an African-American light. And you know? 
 I have a dream that this will be in my microwave in the next five minutes!

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.700
Jory: Is it a good idea to microwave this?

00:00:38.067 --> 00:00:48.067
Let's find out! Here at the Jory Caron Laboratory, safety is our number-one concern. That's why we hide 
 behind this giant tin foil shield. It's to protect our nuts, because nobody likes roasted nuts!

00:00:51.167 --> 00:00:53.167
*electricity sound*

00:00:52.524 --> 00:00:59.524
We also have these fans, to circulate the air, and, as always, the 
 Panasonic microwave. Her name is Whoopi. It's not Sharp or anything!

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Jon: It's not Whoopi Goldberg, is it?

00:01:01.833 --> 00:01:03.833
No!

00:01:02.867 --> 00:01:04.867
Jon: We never give any of our microwaves a last name!

00:01:05.367 --> 00:01:07.367
It's "Caron"!

00:01:06.467 --> 00:01:08.467
Jon: "Whoopi Caron"?! 

00:01:08.567 --> 00:01:10.567
Jon: Oh! I just got it!

00:01:11.967 --> 00:01:14.967
I make them take my last name, and then, I kill 'em!

00:01:15.533 --> 00:01:17.533
Jon: Dude, you have more wives than a Mormon!

00:01:16.833 --> 00:01:18.833
They want pre-nups, I'm, like, "No!"

00:01:21.223 --> 00:01:23.223
Jory: Okay, so let's go ahead and put this in there.

00:01:23.833 --> 00:01:27.833
Jon: Oh, yeah! Black light, black light! Wait, wait, wait! African-American light!

00:01:27.233 --> 00:01:31.233
Jory: Yeah, it's an African-American light, and don't ever disrespect them 
 like that again! Or Whoopi will kick your ass!

00:01:32.323 --> 00:01:35.323
Jon: Whoopi's black, too! She knows what this is about! Black power!

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.200
So, I wonder how long I'm gonna put that in there for?

00:01:37.152 --> 00:01:39.152
Jon: Two-and-a-half minutes, dude!

00:01:38.833 --> 00:01:42.830
Riley: Prediction before we go? Instant awesomeness?

00:01:42.446 --> 00:01:44.450
Instant gratification?

00:01:43.561 --> 00:01:47.560
Jon: Yes, just like the black people had when they 
 came to America... Oh, wait! That was slavery!

00:01:49.367 --> 00:01:51.370
Yeah. At least they had jobs, right?

00:01:50.933 --> 00:01:52.930
Jon: (laughs) Hey-hey!

00:01:53.433 --> 00:01:57.430
Jon: Alright, here it goes! Awesome! Nice, dude! 

00:01:57.367 --> 00:02:01.370
Jory: It's like the glow stick! It's like a purple glow stick!

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.700
Jon: Kinda, but, you know, it's a light, so not quite!

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:06.400
Jory: And it's way brighter than it was when it 
was inside the tube. I love how it's pulsating!

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.600
Jon: I think it's pretty sweet that I'm seeing more 
 blue light on camera than I am in person!

00:02:12.067 --> 00:02:14.070
Jory: Really?

00:02:13.333 --> 00:02:15.330
Jon: Which is really interesting!

00:02:14.733 --> 00:02:17.730
Jory: Oh, wow! That's really blue! Does it have a UV filter?

00:02:17.276 --> 00:02:24.280
Jon: I don't know, but it seems like the camera is picking up extra UV rays that we 
can't see with our normal eyes. 'Cause you guys at home are seeing all this blue! 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:28.600
Jon: At home, we're just seeing the light glowing! Awesome stuff, man!

00:02:28.468 --> 00:02:34.470
Jory: Although, at home, do you see it 
pulsating back and forth? (makes electricity-like sounds)

00:02:35.367 --> 00:02:37.370
Jon: Did it just die out on us? Whoa!

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.400
Jory: Oh, a hole definitely opened up into it, I think, though.

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.540
Riley: Oh, great...

00:02:44.676 --> 00:02:46.680
Jon: Did it break? Did it burst?

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Jory: Well, the end looks like it's fire-tastic right now.

00:02:50.467 --> 00:02:52.470
Riley: I think she's shot... Oh, wait! There's fire...

00:02:54.333 --> 00:02:56.330
Jon: Whoa! What was that?!

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.400
Jory: It's on fire now!

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.800
Jon: Awesome!

00:02:58.067 --> 00:03:00.070
Jory: Let's just let this one work itself out.

00:03:01.633 --> 00:03:09.630
Jon: Aw, yeah! African-American light, you have not let us down! Whoever 
 said you were 3/5 of a light, you were dead wrong!

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
Jory: Okay, I think that's probably good for this.

00:03:11.633 --> 00:03:13.630
Jon: Yeah, we can probably cut out the racist jokes, too!

00:03:15.233 --> 00:03:17.230
Jory: Okay, let's see what we did in here!

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.700
Jon: That's a new smell!

00:03:19.134 --> 00:03:21.130
Jory: What's it smell like?

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:26.800
Jon: I don't know! It's actually probably an old smell, but I haven't 
smelt it in awhile, so it feels new! Hey! Everything looks alright!

00:03:26.533 --> 00:03:28.530
Jory: (singing) Everything is gonna be alright!

00:03:28.667 --> 00:03:31.670
Jon: That's probably your problem right there, Jory- you've got 
 a hole in the back of your light!

00:03:32.467 --> 00:03:38.470
Jory: Yeah, probably. So, it looked like when we were microwaving it, it was 
actually brighter than it would be in the fluorescent holder for it.

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:43.900
Jon: So, it actually increased its amplitude! Way to go, Whoopi!

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.500
Yeah! So, if you want to be empowered, stick yourself inside of a microwave!

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
Jon: Yes! Stick your long, fluorescent tube inside Whoopi!

00:03:49.167 --> 00:03:55.170
Jory: I'm gonna say it's a good idea! And that's it for "Is 
it a Good Idea to Microwave This?" I'm your host, Jory Caron.

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:02.500
*end credits play*

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:06.300
Jon: Let's start off close and pull out.

00:04:06.367 --> 00:04:08.370
Oh, yeah! That's what she said!

00:04:09.733 --> 00:04:19.730
Oh, and don't worry- we still have two more episodes in this season, but 
they aren't gonna take place here. Hint, hint! Because it's too dangerous!

00:04:20.807 --> 00:04:22.810
Jon: For the laboratory!

00:04:22.233 --> 00:04:26.230
Oh, oh! Am I feeling some excitement? Is it palpable? Can I taste 
it? I think I can! Can you taste it right now?

00:04:26.833 --> 00:04:28.830
I can taste a LOT of things right now!

00:04:28.733 --> 00:04:30.730
Jon: I think it's the battery acid!

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:34.700
Jory: I think it's the filet of fish 
 right there! That was the worst day!
