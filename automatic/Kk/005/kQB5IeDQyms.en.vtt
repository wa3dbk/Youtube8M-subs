00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:09.580
 very good to all friends of weights rum and 

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:11.500
 welcome to urban legends today 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:13.780
 I want to treat a legend of kennedy that 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:16.000
 is a character that I want to dedicate 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:17.860
 many more videos so between this year 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.240
 and the one that surely comes, let's see more 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:22.030
 kirby things here in the channel does not 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:24.070
 I only dedicate those videos of the 

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:25.060
 twentieth anniversary but that is that you 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:26.800
 I want to dedicate many more things 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.290
 I consider that he is a character that deserves 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:31.240
 much more attention than it has 

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:33.040
 then to begin this cycle we are going 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.510
 to treat a well-known urban legend 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:36.730
 to the people who sent me this 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.260
 legend a whole my thanks but 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.900
 I do not remember your name to it 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.520
 you have been or if you are reading this and 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:45.070
 you have been the ones who have 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:47.350
 transmitted this information put it here 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:50.260
 down in the comments and I'll put you 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:52.750
 the description and I thank you 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.850
 personally, because the help is not a 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:57.579
 Legend that several people have 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.980
 transmitted and we will try right now 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:02.260
 well the legend is called cyber star la 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:05.379
 legend of silver star not as always 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:07.930
 an urban legend is something that has a 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:09.370
 part of mysterious legend or of 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.020
 invention and another part that is 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:12.909
 sustained in something that is true 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.100
 definitely after this you can 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:17.380
 that what you want depends on our 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.670
 maturity depends on how we face these 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.280
 things to me of course that I do not care 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.719
 because games are games and what 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.969
 talk about them because it's one thing 

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:26.770
 of the fans as we are clearly going to see 

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:30.189
 in this case but it does have a part 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:32.170
 which is interesting and why is it 

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:33.909
 it has been done well this well silver star is 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:36.280
 the fifth world of kirby crystal sharp 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:38.679
 I wrote 64 that is to say the one that appeared in 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:42.009
 He tried 64 endings of it 

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:44.319
 end of the cycle of 64 and in the fifth 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:46.539
 world we will see before entering it a 

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:47.649
 very curious planet is a planet that 

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:50.110
 it will sound to many not 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:52.569
 definitely that planet is the earth 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:56.520
 whether we like it or not, that's the land 

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:56.520
 ok since it has the same continents 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.800
 and let us go to america 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.060
 europe africa all the successes of the 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.110
 continents are represented by 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.500
 quite and also has a satellite 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.880
 orbiting around that is the moon 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:11.910
 our famous moon our beloved moon 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:15.570
 then we can believe that silver star 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:18.900
 it is simply a representation 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:20.280
 from the earth well up there everything is 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.860
 right there I do not think there's anyone 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.110
 disagree simply alomejor jal wanted 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.989
 include a nod to our planet and 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:31.350
 How nice that it is a little creature that 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:32.730
 it is traveling by different diverse 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.130
 regions of the universe and so on 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.440
 Maybe they wanted to give a nod to 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:39.450
 our position in space who 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.489
 it tastes good now it's good we have fun 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.230
 and they are the multiple theories that 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:46.230
 they shuffle on the internet that some do not 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.790
 they have waste not well is said a 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:51.180
 of them that is the one for me the most 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.340
 curious that I already tell you that they are theories and 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.800
 is that 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:57.680
 it is said that if lending is the land but 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:00.800
 many years in the future the earth 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:03.470
 totally frozen considered content 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:05.690
 a huge glaciation and it's the earth 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:08.420
 Well, thousands of years later, do not imagine 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:11.989
 the earth that was in the year 10,000 by 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:13.519
 put an example no and well then for the 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:14.989
 decoration of the levels because many 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:17.299
 of them are snowy levels up 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:18.799
 up mountain and of course by the 

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:20.090
 last level that is a factory one 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:23.420
 factory does look pretty 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:25.160
 human, it is often said that the 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:28.340
 earth was abandoned humanity was 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:30.829
 extinguished and proliferated the machines 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:32.120
 that were active in factories and 

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:33.590
 we could develop a kind of 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.840
 civilization be the people have a 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:37.610
 overflowing imagination because all this 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.129
 is that it does not go anywhere and everything 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:42.290
 a local does not appear in the manual 

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:43.760
 nothing and definitely in the game you do not 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:46.160
 they say nothing but good is interesting 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.599
 think that it is the land and the 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:50.450
 humanity present definitely 

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:54.349
 it could be not because not all ways is 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:56.150
 pretty crazy well if we observe 

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:57.470
 is that an interesting thing because if 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:01.190
 we observe 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:03.500
 the last combat of this is the combat 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:05.240
 against the boss of this level which is a 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:07.160
 machine a robot we will see in the background a 

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:10.010
 futuristic pretty pretty city not very 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:12.410
 well done that good is usually 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:13.850
 weird to see what he sees something like that not see 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:16.850
 a futuristic city there was never 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:19.130
 left in one in a game of kivi then 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:22.160
 a city as such not a human city 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:25.880
 and that's what people confuse him 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:28.580
 not so much the level of the factory as the 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:31.580
 boss and his battle scenario more 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:34.040
 little things that also says that the 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:38.120
 factory is to say the last levels 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:40.490
 of the game of this world there is a kind 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:42.110
 of animals stuck in tubes in tubes of 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:44.540
 water in a kind of test tubes 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:47.210
 from laboratory we can see a kind 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:50.150
 of kitty there in the background and good 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:51.950
 he says it's a human factory 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:54.410
 where you experimented with certain 

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:57.050
 animals and so on not in a series of 

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:58.610
 very big follies but there is one thing 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:00.800
 that we can not discuss in all these 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:03.050
 absurd or absurd theories and is that 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:04.070
 indeed, the planet is the 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:06.440
 land 

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:09.620
 earth the explanation of what happened 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:12.560
 is what people invent is not what 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:14.450
 people say but but I can only 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:18.110
 emphasize that it is a nod to 

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:19.790
 our planet well resident the 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:21.700
 Legend does not have much support 

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:23.960
 I could tell more things about it 

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:26.210
 there is definitely not much more than 

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:28.580
 say therefore I want it to be that 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:30.710
 your own conclusions and yes 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:32.960
 it must be said is the only level of 

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:35.390
 I play the only world of chance here that 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:38.270
 this is how it has not been repeated again 

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:40.550
 in no other kirby this not except to 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:43.460
 that the wink level that they have got into the 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:45.950
 kily of 3ds in combat mode write 

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:48.920
 there is a level based on the factory 

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:52.860
 crystal saltz not in the end but they are only 

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:54.750
 children in a little piece of factory no and nothing 

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:56.039
 you believe what you want and I say if a 

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:58.650
 urban housing that does not have much 

00:05:56.039 --> 00:06:00.780
 foundation but at least it is if 

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:03.150
 sustains in visual things that we can 

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:04.949
 appreciate ourselves when I play the 

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:06.870
 first time I went into this one for real 

00:06:04.949 --> 00:06:08.759
 I did not notice I did not even notice that the 

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:10.979
 level could be the frozen land or the 

00:06:08.759 --> 00:06:13.349
 land after a glaciation or 

00:06:10.979 --> 00:06:15.840
 land after a war between 

00:06:13.349 --> 00:06:18.990
 machines and humans or a war between 

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:21.150
 the humans themselves or a post situation 

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:23.610
 apocalyptic or so is not a thing that 

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:25.340
 I want to simply sell the game and 

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:28.800
 I did not pay much attention either 

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:29.909
 one more detail that we have in sight and 

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:31.830
 nothing to put the comments what 

00:06:29.909 --> 00:06:33.419
 you think this legend please with 

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:35.430
 Regarding the colleagues that want 

00:06:33.419 --> 00:06:36.870
 argue your own theories and also 

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:38.849
 Out of respect for skeptics 

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:40.259
 that they have to have them in 

00:06:38.849 --> 00:06:42.900
 all this of course I am also 

00:06:40.259 --> 00:06:45.150
 pretty skeptical I'm not a model so 

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:46.830
 nothing a big hug and we're leaving 

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:50.360
 seeing throughout this month that I'm going to 

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:50.360
 upload more things a hug
