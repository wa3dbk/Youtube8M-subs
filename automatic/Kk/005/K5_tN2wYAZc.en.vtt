00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.210
 j today i'm going to show you how you can make it as thick as yourself 

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:09.320
 which may be a smaller yes colored picture actually that you put on your nails 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:10.609
 can apply 

00:00:10.609 --> 00:00:13.939
 and I will show you how you can make stamps yourself 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.290
 in this example this is cute angel 

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:21.820
 in fourteen years I use sweat 18 and this stamp card for this 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.390
 Scraping with a silicone can be a stamp and the benefit of this 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:28.390
 city ​​that is a flat back so that you can now put it down 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:33.320
 for the first part of the door of the stamping I use the black 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:34.840
 voice problems 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.840
 this expresses itself disappointing on the stamp 

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:41.339
 on the first degreasing got into the game 

00:00:41.339 --> 00:00:45.350
 then think of some of the pitch on everyone's square 

00:00:45.349 --> 00:00:48.349
 like water to the distribution and bushes 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:53.470
 and grab the money that you put that cold on and then switch off excess and would 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:54.680
 from 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.990
 a little while and kids that is last night 

00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:59.780
 a package inkpad 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.720
 and if this is the end plate on the stamp percent 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:06.570
 so you can now also have a number of votes but you want a colored one and then 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.480
 makes the first one so has 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:09.539
 after about 

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:13.289
 ten seconds on the bullet for the interior of the that you can use 

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:16.690
 Eric a newspaper as a job owner can work there 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:20.860
 and brown and laxity of persie cheese mood disagree 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:25.380
 and this week I use the essence after the strong collective strong new policy 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.050
 I can use the chance that it sounds 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:31.909
 and from the demo is Jane Lynch 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:34.450
 is imminent wk in a few weeks 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.860
 a very small plot of cigarette butts is in the picture 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.860
 actually in the colors 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.789
 the stakes when you are actually completely ready though 

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:00.920
 if you see it that way, you already know what a gang 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.770
 it now goes very dry for a minute or a minute and then I go to their shop 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.220
 to oversee that we are now going on a tour past disorders over a ticket because 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.379
 that's how it should be in that language 

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:16.069
 I have you on the road with those abroad 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:19.949
 for that you just have to put therapy on second place 

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:23.029
 a little bit nothing comes with a little bit 

00:02:23.029 --> 00:02:25.479
 sp is able 

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:28.089
 and now he doesn't let it dry up at all 

00:02:28.089 --> 00:02:31.659
 and then you can i can take it off and then it becomes such a picture 

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:35.639
 well how you can insist this chance on your nails i show in the 

00:02:35.639 --> 00:02:36.700
 next video 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.479
 This is only about making the chance 

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:43.279
 but really about half an hour until you get this and from 

00:02:43.279 --> 00:02:44.589
 otherwise it is work 

00:02:44.589 --> 00:02:47.609
 at the top coat not yet hard enough and then your picture would tear 

00:02:49.249 --> 00:02:52.440
 I hope this is a nice technique for you and m 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.850
 and you can vary endlessly with lots of different pictures 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:56.939
 of course 

00:02:56.939 --> 00:02:58.930
 I hope you and you 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.329
 to give a bit of an idea of ​​how you can make that chance yourself 

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:06.029
 and I had the feeling that I appointed you a bit with this method because 

00:03:06.029 --> 00:03:06.659
 it is real 

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:11.279
 very contagious to do and with a lot of different pictures 

00:03:12.339 --> 00:03:17.320
 I'll see you again in the next video for this one that I nail to the walls 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:21.220
 and for now thank you for watching don't forget to subscribe and I see 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:22.820
