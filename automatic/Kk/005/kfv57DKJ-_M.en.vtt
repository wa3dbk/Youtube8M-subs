00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.450
 very good and welcome to a new 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.240
 video of the geek truck driver channel today 

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:09.690
 let's compare the sizes of the bq 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:13.259
 aquarium 5 the full hd the 2 gigas of 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:15.480
 ram against the engine or the moto g of 2014 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.840
 both terminals have a screen of 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.840
 5 inches 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:24.240
 as you can see 

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:26.070
 today I have come an update of 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.380
 firmware 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.289
 to download we have later and as 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.970
 you can see, it pretty much has a 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.010
 5 inch screen the two blocks 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:38.220
 bq what good it has is that it has the 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.800
 buttons out then like that 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:42.660
 take a little more the screen and 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.950
 that the button of the nexus will make them 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.780
 nexus of the model the forgiveness 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:49.560
 you eat a little bit of the screen of the 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:52.410
 5 of the 5 inches it has 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:54.480
 it's a little more ergonomic this 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.760
 motorola 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.760
 but let's go with how light is the bq 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:02.060
 nothing much 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:06.460
 as you can check in height 

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:06.460
 and take a good piece of the bq 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:14.770
 it's a little thinner that's also the bq 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:14.770
 the bq is also lighter 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:22.170
 if we put them on top of each other 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:22.170
 they are practically as wide 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:31.110
 and high you can see that it's a 

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:31.110
 little higher in the q 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:37.850
 both one and the other go pretty well in 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.909
 the hand this block is very light and this 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:42.630
 because it is very ergonomic 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:42.630
 so 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:56.270
 so you may be interested in sizes 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:02:00.310
 of these two devices here you have 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:03.259
 this good video 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:07.000
 I hope you liked this video and 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:07.000
 nothing more a greeting and until the next
