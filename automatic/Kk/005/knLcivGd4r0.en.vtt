00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:17.900 
the reason that it works with any eye
shape<00:00:16.109> is<00:00:16.379> because<00:00:16.949> you're<00:00:17.310> using<00:00:17.550> those

00:00:21.249 --> 00:00:21.259 
basic principles of light and dark and

00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:25.099 
basic principles of light and dark and
