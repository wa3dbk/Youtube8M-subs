00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:02.480 

so<00:00:00.810> I'd<00:00:01.079> like<00:00:01.319> to<00:00:01.469> show<00:00:01.650> you<00:00:01.680> the<00:00:02.040> problem<00:00:02.220> I'm

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:02.490 
so I'd like to show you the problem I'm

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:08.089 
so I'd like to show you the problem I'm
having<00:00:02.700> with<00:00:02.909> the<00:00:03.890> ITV<00:00:04.890> net<00:00:05.730> stream<00:00:06.180> dtt<00:00:07.170> and

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
having with the ITV net stream dtt and

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:10.820 
having with the ITV net stream dtt and
the<00:00:08.340> problem<00:00:08.670> occurs<00:00:08.940> when<00:00:09.269> viewing<00:00:10.170> two

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
the problem occurs when viewing two

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.919 
the problem occurs when viewing two
channels<00:00:11.490> or<00:00:11.820> rather<00:00:11.969> when<00:00:12.269> using<00:00:12.540> both

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
channels or rather when using both

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.570 
channels or rather when using both
tuners<00:00:13.830> of<00:00:14.160> the<00:00:14.670> ITV<00:00:15.000> net<00:00:15.269> stream<00:00:16.400> and<00:00:17.400> the

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
tuners of the ITV net stream and the

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.300 
tuners of the ITV net stream and the
tuners<00:00:17.940> are<00:00:18.180> set<00:00:18.480> to<00:00:18.750> different<00:00:19.350> frequencies

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
tuners are set to different frequencies

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.939 
tuners are set to different frequencies
so<00:00:21.029> what<00:00:21.240> I've<00:00:21.359> got<00:00:21.539> here<00:00:21.750> on<00:00:21.900> the<00:00:21.990> screen<00:00:22.170> are

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
so what I've got here on the screen are

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.300 
so what I've got here on the screen are
two<00:00:23.010> channels<00:00:23.880> Discovery<00:00:24.869> Channel's<00:00:25.289> and<00:00:25.590> TCN

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
two channels Discovery Channel's and TCN

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.060 
two channels Discovery Channel's and TCN
and<00:00:26.609> they<00:00:27.240> are<00:00:27.390> both<00:00:27.689> on<00:00:28.550> the<00:00:29.550> same<00:00:29.849> frequency

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:31.070 
and they are both on the same frequency

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:36.020 
and they are both on the same frequency
562<00:00:32.070> megahertz<00:00:32.700> and<00:00:33.110> if<00:00:34.110> I<00:00:34.350> change<00:00:35.010> one<00:00:35.460> of

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
562 megahertz and if I change one of

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.369 
562 megahertz and if I change one of
these<00:00:36.180> channels<00:00:36.980> to<00:00:38.120> a<00:00:39.230> channel<00:00:40.230> on<00:00:40.350> a

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
these channels to a channel on a

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.319 
these channels to a channel on a
different<00:00:40.829> frequency<00:00:41.239> we<00:00:42.239> can<00:00:42.480> see<00:00:42.780> that<00:00:44.329> the

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
different frequency we can see that the

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.100 
different frequency we can see that the
image<00:00:45.600> is<00:00:45.780> great<00:00:46.410> on<00:00:46.770> this<00:00:47.399> SBT<00:00:48.180> one<00:00:48.480> channel

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
image is great on this SBT one channel

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.970 
image is great on this SBT one channel
but<00:00:49.890> it's<00:00:50.219> really<00:00:50.640> poor<00:00:50.910> on<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.500> TCM<00:00:52.500> channel

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
but it's really poor on the TCM channel

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.910 
but it's really poor on the TCM channel
it<00:00:53.219> starts<00:00:53.579> to<00:00:53.730> stutter<00:00:54.030> and<00:00:54.800> occasionally<00:00:55.800> it

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
it starts to stutter and occasionally it

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.170 
it starts to stutter and occasionally it
also<00:00:56.100> pixel<00:00:56.820> aids<00:00:56.969> and<00:00:57.829> if<00:00:58.829> I<00:00:59.010> change<00:00:59.370> it<00:00:59.670> back

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
also pixel aids and if I change it back

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.509 
also pixel aids and if I change it back
to<00:01:02.809> Discovery<00:01:03.809> Channel<00:01:04.229> you<00:01:05.040> will<00:01:05.189> see<00:01:05.369> that

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
to Discovery Channel you will see that

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:11.590 
to Discovery Channel you will see that
they<00:01:05.880> both<00:01:06.270> run<00:01:06.930> smoothly<00:01:07.439> again<00:01:07.950> and<00:01:09.979> it'll

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
they both run smoothly again and it'll

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.750 
they both run smoothly again and it'll
be<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.750> same<00:01:13.020> if<00:01:13.320> I<00:01:13.530> were<00:01:13.560> to<00:01:14.010> change<00:01:14.310> this

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
be the same if I were to change this

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:20.480 
be the same if I were to change this
channel<00:01:15.200> to<00:01:16.549> another<00:01:18.650> then<00:01:19.650> you<00:01:19.680> can<00:01:20.070> see<00:01:20.280> the

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
channel to another then you can see the

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.789 
channel to another then you can see the
Discovery<00:01:21.360> Channel<00:01:21.750> starts<00:01:22.680> to<00:01:23.070> stutter<00:01:23.610> and

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:24.799 
Discovery Channel starts to stutter and

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:28.070 
Discovery Channel starts to stutter and
occasionally<00:01:25.799> pixelate<00:01:26.369> as<00:01:26.610> well<00:01:27.030> and<00:01:27.750> I'd

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
occasionally pixelate as well and I'd

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:34.249 
occasionally pixelate as well and I'd
like<00:01:28.350> to<00:01:28.560> show<00:01:28.829> you<00:01:28.890> that<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:30.979> Preferences<00:01:33.259> on

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
like to show you that the Preferences on

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.429 
like to show you that the Preferences on
the<00:01:34.560> display<00:01:34.979> tab<00:01:35.820> are<00:01:36.150> set<00:01:36.540> to<00:01:36.780> progressive

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
the display tab are set to progressive

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.490 
the display tab are set to progressive
scan<00:01:38.040> and<00:01:38.520> they<00:01:39.180> have<00:01:39.360> always<00:01:39.540> been<00:01:39.930> in<00:01:40.200> my

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
scan and they have always been in my

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.210 
scan and they have always been in my
setup<00:01:42.110> so<00:01:43.110> that's<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.500> problem<00:01:43.740> one<00:01:44.040> that

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
setup so that's the problem one that

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.649 
setup so that's the problem one that
when<00:01:44.820> when<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.390> two<00:01:46.049> tuners<00:01:46.710> in<00:01:47.040> the<00:01:47.670> ITV<00:01:48.390> net

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
when when the two tuners in the ITV net

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.560 
when when the two tuners in the ITV net
stream<00:01:49.049> are<00:01:49.290> set<00:01:50.100> two<00:01:50.250> channels<00:01:50.790> on<00:01:51.030> different

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
stream are set two channels on different

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:57.109 
stream are set two channels on different
frequencies<00:01:53.720> one<00:01:54.720> or<00:01:55.020> both<00:01:55.350> of<00:01:55.409> them<00:01:56.119> show

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
frequencies one or both of them show

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.910 
frequencies one or both of them show
these<00:01:57.360> problems<00:01:57.930> with<00:01:58.290> stuttering<00:01:58.979> image<00:01:59.520> or

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:00.920 
these problems with stuttering image or

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.459 
these problems with stuttering image or
pixelation<00:02:01.939> so<00:02:02.939> just<00:02:03.509> to<00:02:03.659> show<00:02:03.840> you<00:02:03.899> again<00:02:04.049> if

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
pixelation so just to show you again if

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.789 
pixelation so just to show you again if
I<00:02:04.619> go<00:02:04.649> back<00:02:05.070> to<00:02:05.119> TCM<00:02:06.119> which<00:02:07.020> is<00:02:07.229> on<00:02:07.380> the<00:02:07.500> same

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
I go back to TCM which is on the same

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.369 
I go back to TCM which is on the same
frequency<00:02:08.369> as<00:02:08.489> Discovery<00:02:08.940> Channel<00:02:09.330> they<00:02:10.080> both

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
frequency as Discovery Channel they both

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.339 
frequency as Discovery Channel they both
flow

00:02:12.339 --> 00:02:12.349 
flow

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:15.729 
flow
or<00:02:12.890> play<00:02:13.220> smoothie<00:02:13.670> again<00:02:14.360> so<00:02:15.290> that's<00:02:15.530> the

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:15.739 
or play smoothie again so that's the

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:17.980 
or play smoothie again so that's the
problem
