00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.869 
write research papers okay let's say
that<00:02:08.459> students<00:02:09.270> will<00:02:09.450> use<00:02:10.310> research<00:02:11.310> methods

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
that students will use research methods

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.430 
that students will use research methods
appropriately<00:02:12.629> to<00:02:12.959> design

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
appropriately to design

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.490

and<00:02:13.590> carry<00:02:13.860> out<00:02:14.010> research<00:02:14.190> projects<00:02:15.500> very

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
and carry out research projects very

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.610 
and carry out research projects very
good<00:02:17.420> let's<00:02:18.420> try<00:02:18.630> to<00:02:18.690> rephrase<00:02:19.080> another<00:02:19.440> of

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
good let's try to rephrase another of

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.560 
good let's try to rephrase another of

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.380 
sure how to phrase this as an SLO
I<00:02:45.300> mean<00:02:45.720> it<00:02:45.870> can't<00:02:46.110> really<00:02:46.350> be<00:02:46.500> measured<00:02:47.430> so<00:02:48.360> I

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
I mean it can't really be measured so I

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.810 
I mean it can't really be measured so I
