00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:21.660
 rainer glÃ¤ÃŸ a german daniel 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.670
 Gynecology, so to speak, gave us this 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.430
 magic box here brings my 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:29.250
 plates washing machine 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:32.310
 the advantage of this machine is that the 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.860
 les with an ultrasound radios bad 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:37.170
 works and unlike many 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.480
 other plates washing machines for it 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.180
 ensures that even on plates one man 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.860
 from the junk for a euro cheap 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.050
 you shot the possibility 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.539
 really get any dirt out 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.460
 The operation is at the machine 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:54.510
 It's really easy to take 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:57.179
 simply the beehives of iran and 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.969
 pressed the button then it takes approx 

00:00:57.179 --> 00:01:01.920
 five to six minutes to the plate 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.809
 You can clean them in time 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.120
 the cup of coffee or can drink 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.610
 By the way, continue to listen to music because 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:10.110
 the vinyl climate is much lighter than 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.030
 Most flat washers that 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.280
 work with a vacuum cleaner motor 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.470
 the further advantage of the machine 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.470
 namely that the very dry process 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.420
 No extraction but by 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.640
 two fans in front and behind 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.020
 ensures that the plate, so to speak 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.840
 is blown dry 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.460
 the huge advantage is also opposite 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.350
 other machines that the plate 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.600
 absolutely dry except machine that comes 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.010
 can hardly any other plate for 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.200
 for example that really guarantees is 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:38.610
 then the plate directly on the right 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.640
 Place and play the platter or 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.560
 immediately catch up again and thereby that 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.120
 the plate is not sucked off or 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.980
 areas to be worried about will have you too 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:48.120
 no additional static charge 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:50.310
 like many machines still 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:51.570
 happens through the dry through the 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.780
 drying process with the two 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.970
 ventilate the plate absolutely antistatic 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.610
 and therefore also tremendous sound 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:02.340
 Impact so the machine has now 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.150
 just turned off and does not hear 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.030
 simply take the plate by hand 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:10.180
 and how they see is the absolute 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:12.730
 dry and clean and can jump on 

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:14.020
 the platter or in 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.790
 the case will be put on now 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.050
 Do not wait any longer until the plate 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.220
 Dries off like many others 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:20.170
 plates washing machines but this 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.540
 absolutely dry and can be done immediately 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:24.330
 be used or obtained 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.590
 and archived 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.120
 I like to lead him the machine too 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.250
 in our studio before you can 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.440
 like to bring a two slices 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.530
 and I they lacked the earlier times 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.250
 to be heard before 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.380
 determine the great sonic 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.150
 is different and she one 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.790
 uncleaned plate possibly 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.530
 also start something has become against one 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.720
 hear the on this machine comes the 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:49.200
 sound difference is right 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.200
 tried
