00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.860
 the alive and brown 92 

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:09.800
 very good to all vaquitas how are you? 

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:11.600
 you are obviously obviously one time 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.219
 more in minecraft and good I'm in 

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:15.860
 another tutorial in which we are going to 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:18.230
 hide a secret chest do not tell 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:19.970
 nobody will be able to hide a chest 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:21.350
 secret by using the iter 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:23.630
 frame is valid that has come out in the last 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:25.250
 session and nothing guys I hope you like it 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:27.619
 ok he found me in a little house 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:30.080
 ok or some kind of house and well I'll 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:32.000
 to explain what the topic would be like 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.340
 would be the good mechanism you see here the 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.920
 picture that is like how is this this 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.750
 crooked items looking at 45 degrees towards 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.520
 my left then look what happens 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:44.360
 when I what I want where is 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:47.030
 it was here it's worth it if we click on it and 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:49.070
 we put in the same way it's worth 1 2 3 4 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:52.760
 you know face turns in 45 degrees worth 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:56.420
 then when you stay at a tic 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.710
 nor to fresh milk and nothing guys this 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.449
 it would be the tutorial now I'm going to do it 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.760
 from scratch it is very simple to make vale 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:05.769
 what it takes is practically nothing worth 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.769
 and nothing guys we go to the mess wey 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.619
 let's start by placing a framework that 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.360
 is where the activation is going to be 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:14.630
 say the password where you 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:16.340
 you want and obviously inside the box 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.350
 frame voucher we will place widgets 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.219
 anybody is worth me for example a box 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.710
 of milk that he has just taken 

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:23.299
 very fresh from my udders well then this 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.100
 We will leave this item in the 

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:26.990
 second last place because I want you to see 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.969
 how would we leave it here and now we 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.429
 let's go to the back we're going to 

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:34.219
 place a solid block worth and above 

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:36.500
 a comparator is valid as it is so that 

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:38.539
 this way the good mechanism is activated 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.740
 here obviously the signal does not give us the 

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:41.689
 we have to take eight away 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.240
 we take it to the left one 

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:46.220
 two three four five six seven and eight 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.649
 obviously in 9 it is no longer activated 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:51.110
 ok in number 9 we will place a 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:53.360
 items an object any block and 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.340
 let's invest what would be the process 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.380
 It is valid so that when the items are in the 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.750
 Right place is worth the place 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.849
 normal the door is obviously closed 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.500
 ok then we leave it so good a 

00:02:01.849 --> 00:02:05.119
 Once this is done, it's all we have left 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.530
 the door where we want to make the door 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:08.479
 Well, where we believe, I'm going to 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.190
 do here ok we're going to go to the 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.319
 back and let's start 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.849
 placing pistons we are going to place 4 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:15.739
 I already explained it in other tutorials 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:17.480
 it's easy to make a valid one, we put 4 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:18.920
 here they will all go looking towards the 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.840
 inside and in the part on the right 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:24.139
 We do the same process, we put 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:26.030
 4 here 2 it 's good to look from above 

00:02:24.139 --> 00:02:27.950
 as it would look and well now just 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.049
 ok let's place here blocks 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:32.000
 solid 2 2 that what will do that 

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:34.969
 really plug the door and up 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.799
 We also cover this way 

00:02:34.969 --> 00:02:38.269
 what now to determine where I am going to place 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:40.400
 the rest we will place two droplets 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:43.459
 here two droplets here and two droplets here 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:46.069
 it's worth the sides just two 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:48.560
 repeaters one here and another here and you 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:51.379
 we click once each repeater is worth 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.480
 perfect good now and simply 

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:55.099
 join but first you have to do 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.590
 what I'm going to do next is worth 

00:02:55.099 --> 00:03:01.099
 which is to place a last repeater 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:03.290
 here is worth making the watch tachÃ¡n and 

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:04.669
 just now lower the signal we're going to 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.849
 lower it so you can see that it works at 

00:03:04.669 --> 00:03:09.500
 perfection like that if not everything 

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:10.609
 it worked you re rehearse the tutorial 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.840
 because I already tell you that I am 

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:13.519
 explaining one hundred percent is very 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.319
 simple to do is worth now simply 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:17.060
 you will see that when the iter is in its 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:19.610
 initial place 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:22.459
 the door closes and when you read it is 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:24.170
 is in the penultimate place what happens that 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:25.610
 the door opens and we have access to 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:27.319
 our chest that we must place 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:29.569
 because here is worth here simply 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:31.010
 back then we cover that I am very shabby 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:33.200
 and nothing guys I hope you liked it 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:35.660
 the tutorial already digests well of everything 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.580
 This minigame after ourense 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:39.349
 go through here free and fun 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:42.560
 ok and you can download it you know that 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:45.830
 voting a little hand up I'm happy 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:47.330
 I have treated milk for 24 hours and 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:50.680
 everything is better 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:50.680
 Greetings people and see you next time
