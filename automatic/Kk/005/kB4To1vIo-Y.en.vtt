let's go ahead and jump right into it so

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:25.740 
let's go ahead and jump right into it so
to<00:01:24.220> get<00:01:24.310> started<00:01:24.700> what<00:01:24.790> we<00:01:24.910> need<00:01:25.060> to<00:01:25.150> do<00:01:25.330> is<00:01:25.510> dig

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:25.750 
to get started what we need to do is dig

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.620 
to get started what we need to do is dig
out<00:01:25.900> a<00:01:26.010> 3x3<00:01:27.010> area<00:01:27.150> so<00:01:28.150> I'm<00:01:28.240> just<00:01:28.360> gonna<00:01:28.450> go

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:28.630 
out a 3x3 area so I'm just gonna go

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.040 
out a 3x3 area so I'm just gonna go
ahead<00:01:28.690> and<00:01:28.810> dig<00:01:29.080> out<00:01:29.290> three<00:01:29.800> here<00:01:30.220> three<00:01:31.050> down

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:32.050 
ahead and dig out three here three down

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:34.770 
ahead and dig out three here three down
and<00:01:32.470> three<00:01:32.800> wide<00:01:33.040> so<00:01:33.730> obviously<00:01:34.120> we're<00:01:34.540> three

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:34.780 
and three wide so obviously we're three

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.220 
and three wide so obviously we're three
down<00:01:34.960> and<00:01:36.390> there<00:01:37.390> we<00:01:37.570> have<00:01:37.720> ourselves<00:01:37.840> three

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:38.230 
down and there we have ourselves three

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:13.920 
ahead and put some redstone dust behind
here<00:02:10.720> followed<00:02:11.709> by<00:02:11.739> redstone<00:02:12.280> or<00:02:12.879> on<00:02:13.390> top<00:02:13.690> of

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
here followed by redstone or on top of

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.770 
here followed by redstone or on top of
here<00:02:14.290> like<00:02:14.620> so<00:02:15.159> so<00:02:15.909> now<00:02:16.120> you<00:02:16.180> should<00:02:16.299> see<00:02:16.659> that

ahead and we look here we can see
voila<00:02:23.890> the<00:02:23.950> torch<00:02:24.340> is<00:02:24.459> also<00:02:24.790> out<00:02:25.080> now<00:02:26.080> now<00:02:26.500> that

but<00:02:57.430> try<00:02:57.640> not<00:02:57.670> to<00:02:57.790> touch<00:02:57.970> it<00:02:58.120> at<00:02:58.209> all<00:02:58.299> and<00:02:58.540> then

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
but try not to touch it at all and then

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:00.690 
but try not to touch it at all and then
go<00:02:59.290> ahead<00:02:59.410> and<00:02:59.530> come<00:02:59.829> down<00:03:00.010> here<00:03:00.040> and<00:03:00.340> you<00:03:00.549> can

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
go ahead and come down here and you can

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.300 
go ahead and come down here and you can
just<00:03:00.730> stuff<00:03:01.150> this<00:03:01.299> area<00:03:01.660> down<00:03:01.840> here<00:03:01.870> with<00:03:02.829> TNT

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
just stuff this area down here with TNT

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.150 
just stuff this area down here with TNT
up<00:03:03.879> the<00:03:04.510> wazoo<00:03:04.690> now<00:03:05.200> before<00:03:05.620> you<00:03:05.709> go<00:03:05.829> ahead<00:03:05.950> and

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
up the wazoo now before you go ahead and

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:07.860 
up the wazoo now before you go ahead and
you<00:03:06.220> get<00:03:06.340> to<00:03:06.519> kind<00:03:06.700> of<00:03:06.819> crazy<00:03:07.060> putting<00:03:07.480> TNT

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
you get to kind of crazy putting TNT

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:09.599 
you get to kind of crazy putting TNT
down<00:03:08.049> here<00:03:08.319> you<00:03:08.799> want<00:03:08.980> to<00:03:09.069> make<00:03:09.129> sure<00:03:09.370> that<00:03:09.489> you

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:09.609 
down here you want to make sure that you

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:11.339 
down here you want to make sure that you
don't<00:03:09.849> put<00:03:10.060> the<00:03:10.150> TNT<00:03:10.569> next<00:03:10.870> to<00:03:10.930> this<00:03:11.049> redstone

00:03:11.339 --> 00:03:11.349 
don't put the TNT next to this redstone

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:13.470 
don't put the TNT next to this redstone
torch<00:03:11.739> because<00:03:12.310> Alex<00:03:13.000> I<00:03:13.090> guess<00:03:13.239> made<00:03:13.390> it

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
torch because Alex I guess made it

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:14.490 
torch because Alex I guess made it
really<00:03:13.599> really<00:03:13.690> clear<00:03:14.019> that<00:03:14.170> you<00:03:14.230> shouldn't

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
really really clear that you shouldn't

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.319 
really really clear that you shouldn't
do<00:03:14.560> that<00:03:14.680> so<00:03:14.950> I<00:03:15.160> haven't<00:03:15.790> tried<00:03:16.000> it<00:03:16.150> maybe

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:16.329 
do that so I haven't tried it maybe

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:18.900 
do that so I haven't tried it maybe
it'll<00:03:16.510> set<00:03:17.140> it<00:03:17.260> off<00:03:17.379> and<00:03:17.650> yes<00:03:17.829> it<00:03:17.980> does<00:03:18.160> okay<00:03:18.579> so

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
it'll set it off and yes it does okay so

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:19.800 
it'll set it off and yes it does okay so
I'll<00:03:19.060> be<00:03:19.150> right<00:03:19.359> back

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
I'll be right back

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.830 
I'll be right back
because<00:03:20.290> that<00:03:20.470> does<00:03:20.650> set<00:03:20.920> it<00:03:21.040> off<00:03:21.780> okay<00:03:22.780> so

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
because that does set it off okay so

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.360 
because that does set it off okay so
clearly<00:03:23.230> we<00:03:23.410> all<00:03:23.440> just<00:03:23.769> found<00:03:23.920> out<00:03:24.069> together

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
clearly we all just found out together

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:26.610 
clearly we all just found out together
why<00:03:24.670> you<00:03:24.730> don't<00:03:25.269> want<00:03:25.480> to<00:03:25.569> put<00:03:25.720> the<00:03:25.840> TNT<00:03:26.290> next

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
why you don't want to put the TNT next

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.770 
why you don't want to put the TNT next
to<00:03:26.680> the<00:03:26.769> redstone<00:03:27.160> torch<00:03:27.190> and<00:03:27.700> I<00:03:27.730> guess<00:03:28.630> when

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780 
to the redstone torch and I guess when

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:29.909 
to the redstone torch and I guess when
your<00:03:28.870> buddy<00:03:29.079> that<00:03:29.139> does<00:03:29.380> a<00:03:29.410> lot<00:03:29.560> of<00:03:29.620> stuff<00:03:29.739> with

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:29.919 
your buddy that does a lot of stuff with

00:03:29.919 --> 00:03:31.920 
your buddy that does a lot of stuff with
redstone<00:03:30.220> tells<00:03:30.609> a<00:03:30.700> redstone<00:03:30.970> noob<00:03:31.359> not<00:03:31.660> to<00:03:31.780> do

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
redstone tells a redstone noob not to do

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:33.569 
redstone tells a redstone noob not to do
something<00:03:32.319> you<00:03:32.739> really<00:03:32.980> probably<00:03:33.190> should<00:03:33.459> do

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:33.579 
something you really probably should do

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:35.309 
something you really probably should do
it<00:03:33.730> so<00:03:33.910> anyway<00:03:34.389> make<00:03:34.660> sure<00:03:34.690> you<00:03:34.870> don't<00:03:35.079> put<00:03:35.230> the

00:03:35.309 --> 00:03:35.319 
it so anyway make sure you don't put the

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:37.319 
it so anyway make sure you don't put the
TNT<00:03:35.650> next<00:03:35.799> to<00:03:35.919> the<00:03:35.980> torch<00:03:36.220> and<00:03:36.459> just<00:03:37.030> fill<00:03:37.209> up

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:37.329 
TNT next to the torch and just fill up

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:39.330 
TNT next to the torch and just fill up
that<00:03:37.450> area<00:03:37.660> down<00:03:37.989> there<00:03:38.019> and<00:03:38.500> after<00:03:39.160> you<00:03:39.250> go

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
that area down there and after you go

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:40.770 
that area down there and after you go
ahead<00:03:39.579> and<00:03:39.669> do<00:03:39.730> that<00:03:39.760> now<00:03:39.940> we<00:03:40.180> can<00:03:40.480> go<00:03:40.630> ahead

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
ahead and do that now we can go ahead

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:42.720 
ahead and do that now we can go ahead
and<00:03:41.049> place<00:03:41.470> the<00:03:41.650> blocks<00:03:41.859> around<00:03:42.069> and<00:03:42.400> make<00:03:42.519> us

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730 
and place the blocks around and make us

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:45.690 
and place the blocks around and make us
our<00:03:42.940> trap<00:03:43.620> so<00:03:44.620> I<00:03:44.650> just<00:03:44.950> have<00:03:45.099> stone<00:03:45.370> here<00:03:45.609> it

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:45.700 
our trap so I just have stone here it

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:46.949 
our trap so I just have stone here it
really<00:03:45.880> doesn't<00:03:46.120> matter<00:03:46.180> what<00:03:46.389> block<00:03:46.599> you<00:03:46.630> use

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:46.959 
really doesn't matter what block you use

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:48.809 
really doesn't matter what block you use
just<00:03:47.139> make<00:03:47.349> sure<00:03:47.560> that<00:03:48.099> it<00:03:48.250> would<00:03:48.400> look<00:03:48.609> normal

00:03:48.809 --> 00:03:48.819 
just make sure that it would look normal

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:51.120 
just make sure that it would look normal
to<00:03:49.120> have<00:03:49.209> carpet<00:03:49.630> on<00:03:49.720> top<00:03:49.959> of<00:03:50.109> it<00:03:50.230> because<00:03:50.980> you

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.130 
to have carpet on top of it because you

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:53.490 
to have carpet on top of it because you
do<00:03:51.310> have<00:03:51.489> to<00:03:51.609> use<00:03:51.700> carpet<00:03:52.060> for<00:03:52.209> this<00:03:52.329> you<00:03:53.260> can't

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
do have to use carpet for this you can't

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.559 
do have to use carpet for this you can't
use<00:03:53.680> like<00:03:53.889> snow<00:03:54.220> because<00:03:54.880> we<00:03:55.000> use<00:03:55.180> snow<00:03:55.419> it's

00:03:55.559 --> 00:03:55.569 
use like snow because we use snow it's

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:57.150 
use like snow because we use snow it's
gonna<00:03:55.690> update<00:03:55.930> the<00:03:56.200> block<00:03:56.410> and<00:03:56.650> then<00:03:56.799> set<00:03:57.040> off

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:57.160 
gonna update the block and then set off

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.250 
gonna update the block and then set off
that<00:03:57.310> redstone<00:03:57.549> ore<00:03:57.970> so<00:03:58.660> essentially<00:03:59.139> what

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260 
that redstone ore so essentially what

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:00.750 
that redstone ore so essentially what
happens<00:03:59.290> here<00:03:59.769> and<00:03:59.859> how<00:03:59.950> this<00:04:00.069> trap<00:04:00.340> works<00:04:00.519> is

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760 
happens here and how this trap works is

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.030 
happens here and how this trap works is
when<00:04:00.910> you<00:04:01.000> walk<00:04:01.269> over<00:04:01.540> redstone<00:04:02.139> or<00:04:02.349> for<00:04:02.950> those

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.040 
when you walk over redstone or for those

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:04.440 
when you walk over redstone or for those
of<00:04:03.099> you<00:04:03.220> who<00:04:03.340> don't<00:04:03.519> know<00:04:03.669> the<00:04:03.910> block<00:04:04.120> kind<00:04:04.359> of

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:04.450 
of you who don't know the block kind of

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:05.699 
of you who don't know the block kind of
update<00:04:04.720> so<00:04:04.870> you<00:04:04.930> can<00:04:05.079> see<00:04:05.230> here<00:04:05.410> it's<00:04:05.500> doing<00:04:05.560> a

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:05.709 
update so you can see here it's doing a

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:07.770 
update so you can see here it's doing a
little<00:04:05.889> sparkling<00:04:06.310> animation<00:04:06.849> and<00:04:07.030> when<00:04:07.660> it

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:07.780 
little sparkling animation and when it

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:09.330 
little sparkling animation and when it
actually<00:04:07.930> does<00:04:08.230> that<00:04:08.440> one<00:04:08.769> a<00:04:08.799> player<00:04:09.040> walks

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.340 
actually does that one a player walks

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:11.339 
actually does that one a player walks
over<00:04:09.579> it<00:04:09.760> in<00:04:09.849> our<00:04:09.940> trap<00:04:10.239> here<00:04:10.510> it<00:04:10.660> will<00:04:11.169> then

00:04:11.339 --> 00:04:11.349 
over it in our trap here it will then

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:13.409 
over it in our trap here it will then
light<00:04:11.590> up<00:04:11.620> that<00:04:11.859> redstone<00:04:12.069> torch<00:04:12.639> as<00:04:12.879> well<00:04:13.209> as

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:13.419 
light up that redstone torch as well as

00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:15.539 
light up that redstone torch as well as
the<00:04:13.629> dust<00:04:13.900> and<00:04:14.169> it<00:04:14.530> will<00:04:14.650> set<00:04:14.829> off<00:04:14.859> the<00:04:15.069> TNT<00:04:15.459> so

00:04:15.539 --> 00:04:15.549 
the dust and it will set off the TNT so

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:16.529 
the dust and it will set off the TNT so
that's<00:04:15.700> why<00:04:15.790> you<00:04:15.849> need<00:04:15.970> to<00:04:16.000> make<00:04:16.150> sure<00:04:16.269> you<00:04:16.359> do

00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:16.539 
that's why you need to make sure you do

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:19.469 
that's why you need to make sure you do
not<00:04:16.660> touch<00:04:16.930> the<00:04:17.139> redstone<00:04:17.530> or<00:04:18.090> now<00:04:19.090> how<00:04:19.359> do<00:04:19.419> we

00:04:19.469 --> 00:04:19.479 
not touch the redstone or now how do we

not touch the redstone or now how do we
put<00:04:19.690> blocks<00:04:19.870> around<00:04:20.049> this<00:04:20.289> you<00:04:20.440> ask<00:04:20.590> well<00:04:20.829> to

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:21.039 
put blocks around this you ask well to

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:22.620 
put blocks around this you ask well to
do<00:04:21.160> that<00:04:21.310> you<00:04:21.430> just<00:04:21.459> need<00:04:21.609> to<00:04:21.760> make<00:04:21.910> sure<00:04:21.940> that

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:22.630

when<00:04:22.810> you<00:04:22.900> place<00:04:23.139> blocks<00:04:23.440> around<00:04:23.620> this<00:04:23.889> that

00:04:24.089 --> 00:04:24.099 
when you place blocks around this that

00:04:24.099 --> 00:04:25.350 
when you place blocks around this that

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.360 
you don't actually look at it when you

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:26.580 
you don't actually look at it when you
put<00:04:25.510> the<00:04:25.599> blotter<00:04:25.840> when<00:04:26.080> you<00:04:26.169> put<00:04:26.320> the<00:04:26.410> blocks

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:26.590 
put the blotter when you put the blocks

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:28.830 
put the blotter when you put the blocks
down<00:04:26.830> you<00:04:27.430> look<00:04:27.639> at<00:04:27.849> the<00:04:27.970> blocks<00:04:28.180> around<00:04:28.360> it

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:28.840 
down you look at the blocks around it

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.750 
down you look at the blocks around it
and<00:04:28.960> put<00:04:29.110> the<00:04:29.169> blocks<00:04:29.410> down<00:04:29.620> so<00:04:29.949> as<00:04:30.130> you<00:04:30.639> can

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:30.760

00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:35.979 
a block and then we're just going to go

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:36.820 
a block and then we're just going to go
ahead<00:04:36.219> and<00:04:36.400> put<00:04:36.550> down

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:57.020 
we can see how that works and when we go

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:58.750

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:37.420 
what's that what's that sparkling down
there<00:05:35.390> and<00:05:35.570> now<00:05:36.320> it's<00:05:36.560> about<00:05:36.650> to<00:05:36.890> be<00:05:37.010> our<00:05:37.160> death

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:37.430 
there and now it's about to be our death

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:39.310 
there and now it's about to be our death
so<00:05:37.670> you<00:05:37.700> can<00:05:37.910> see<00:05:38.060> boom<00:05:38.420> boom<00:05:38.660> boom<00:05:38.900> we<00:05:39.170> go

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:39.320 
so you can see boom boom boom we go

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:42.130 
so you can see boom boom boom we go
sky-high<00:05:39.680> and<00:05:40.220> we<00:05:40.970> are<00:05:41.180> deader<00:05:41.900> than<00:05:41.990> a

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:42.140 
sky-high and we are deader than a

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:42.790 
sky-high and we are deader than a
doorknob

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:42.800 
doorknob

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.890 
doorknob
so<00:05:42.950> that<00:05:43.520> is<00:05:43.700> how<00:05:43.820> you<00:05:43.880> make<00:05:44.090> a<00:05:44.330> completely

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:44.900 
so that is how you make a completely

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:46.840 
so that is how you make a completely
undetectable<00:05:45.530> TNT<00:05:45.980> trap<00:05:46.220> you<00:05:46.340> can<00:05:46.490> see<00:05:46.640> here

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:46.850 
undetectable TNT trap you can see here

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:48.730 
undetectable TNT trap you can see here
I've<00:05:47.000> made<00:05:47.240> a<00:05:47.270> couple<00:05:47.510> this<00:05:48.110> was<00:05:48.350> the<00:05:48.440> epic

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:48.740 
I've made a couple this was the epic

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:50.890 
I've made a couple this was the epic
failure<00:05:49.130> because<00:05:49.880> we<00:05:50.060> we<00:05:50.360> went<00:05:50.510> ahead<00:05:50.600> and<00:05:50.840> we

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:50.900 
failure because we we went ahead and we

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:52.660 
failure because we we went ahead and we
put<00:05:51.110> the<00:05:51.260> the<00:05:51.290> TNT<00:05:51.830> in<00:05:51.950> the<00:05:51.980> wrong<00:05:52.160> spot<00:05:52.490> and

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:52.670 
put the the TNT in the wrong spot and

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:54.640 
put the the TNT in the wrong spot and
then<00:05:52.760> I<00:05:52.790> was<00:05:52.970> just<00:05:53.000> one<00:05:53.210> right<00:05:53.330> there<00:05:53.530> so<00:05:54.530> it's

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:54.650 
then I was just one right there so it's

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:56.800 
then I was just one right there so it's
a<00:05:54.740> very<00:05:54.920> very<00:05:55.070> simple<00:05:55.550> trap<00:05:55.820> to<00:05:55.970> build<00:05:56.180> but

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:56.810 
a very very simple trap to build but

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:58.420 
a very very simple trap to build but
it's<00:05:56.960> completely<00:05:57.170> undetectable<00:05:58.070> if<00:05:58.220> you<00:05:58.340> have

00:05:58.420 --> 00:05:58.430 
it's completely undetectable if you have

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:00.430 
it's completely undetectable if you have
the<00:05:58.520> carpet<00:05:58.760> all<00:05:59.030> the<00:05:59.180> same<00:05:59.360> color<00:05:59.630> like<00:06:00.230> if<00:06:00.350> I

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:00.440 
the carpet all the same color like if I

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:02.320 
the carpet all the same color like if I
had<00:06:00.590> this<00:06:00.680> thing<00:06:00.860> inside<00:06:01.190> of<00:06:01.310> my<00:06:01.400> house<00:06:01.640> there

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:02.330 
had this thing inside of my house there

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:03.910 
had this thing inside of my house there
and<00:06:02.510> I<00:06:02.630> had<00:06:02.780> carpet<00:06:03.140> all<00:06:03.230> over<00:06:03.410> the<00:06:03.500> place<00:06:03.680> you

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:03.920 
and I had carpet all over the place you

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:05.710 
and I had carpet all over the place you
would<00:06:04.040> have<00:06:04.070> no<00:06:04.370> idea<00:06:04.400> that<00:06:04.850> oh<00:06:05.210> wow<00:06:05.480> there's

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:05.720 
would have no idea that oh wow there's

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:08.260 
would have no idea that oh wow there's
that<00:06:05.840> and<00:06:06.080> boom<00:06:06.320> TNT<00:06:06.890> trap<00:06:07.100> dead<00:06:07.280> and<00:06:07.460> gone<00:06:08.000> but

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:08.270
