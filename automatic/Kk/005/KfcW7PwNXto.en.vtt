all<00:02:47.160> right<00:02:47.250> there<00:02:47.490> we<00:02:47.580> go<00:02:48.030> budget<00:02:48.810> x-pipe<00:02:50.540> it's

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
all right there we go budget x-pipe it's

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.410 
all right there we go budget x-pipe it's
not<00:02:51.660> very<00:02:51.900> rare<00:02:52.170> into<00:02:52.410> performance<00:02:52.860> world<00:02:53.420> it

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
not very rare into performance world it

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.580 
not very rare into performance world it
actually<00:02:54.600> is<00:02:55.020> all<00:02:55.170> the<00:02:55.290> time<00:02:57.350> your<00:02:58.350> honor<00:02:58.380> they

so it should give the truck a nice tone
and<00:03:05.040> help<00:03:05.820> the<00:03:05.910> performance<00:03:06.120> by<00:03:06.960> equalizing

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:07.850 
and help the performance by equalizing

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:57.920 
and help the performance by equalizing
