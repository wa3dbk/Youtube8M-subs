but it isn't the five shell this case
was<00:00:29.600> $15<00:00:30.260> it<00:00:30.410> for<00:00:30.560> yourself<00:00:30.920> and<00:00:31.100> let<00:00:31.220> me<00:00:31.280> just

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:31.310 
was $15 it for yourself and let me just

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.389 
was $15 it for yourself and let me just
say<00:00:31.520> it's<00:00:31.730> a<00:00:31.790> great<00:00:32.000> case<00:00:32.710> and<00:00:33.710> compared<00:00:34.100> to

00:00:34.389 --> 00:00:34.399 
say it's a great case and compared to

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:36.130 
say it's a great case and compared to
all<00:00:34.730> my<00:00:34.969> three<00:00:35.300> different<00:00:35.600> kinds<00:00:35.750> of<00:00:35.960> water

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:36.140 
all my three different kinds of water

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:41.410 
all my three different kinds of water
boxes<00:00:37.510> I'll<00:00:38.510> just<00:00:39.050> say<00:00:39.350> I<00:00:40.060> don't<00:00:41.060> use<00:00:41.210> these

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:41.420 
boxes I'll just say I don't use these

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.660 
boxes I'll just say I don't use these
anymore<00:00:41.810> and<00:00:41.990> the<00:00:42.079> reason<00:00:42.350> why<00:00:42.470> this<00:00:42.800> still

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:43.670 
anymore and the reason why this still

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.350 
anymore and the reason why this still
protects<00:00:44.090> well<00:00:44.510> and<00:00:44.980> it<00:00:45.980> also<00:00:46.280> has<00:00:46.730> great

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:47.360 
protects well and it also has great

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.160 
protects well and it also has great
style<00:00:47.720> and<00:00:47.960> I<00:00:48.380> find<00:00:48.650> it<00:00:48.739> very<00:00:48.800> comfortable<00:00:50.170> so

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.170 
style and I find it very comfortable so

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.290 
style and I find it very comfortable so
it's<00:00:51.320> going<00:00:51.500> to<00:00:51.560> have<00:00:51.649> and<00:00:52.070> it's<00:00:52.880> going<00:00:53.060> to<00:00:53.149> go

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:53.300 
it's going to have and it's going to go

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.120 
it's going to have and it's going to go
over<00:00:53.329> the<00:00:53.720> screen<00:00:53.930> for<00:00:54.260> example<00:00:54.739> just<00:00:54.950> let<00:00:55.040> me

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:55.130 
over the screen for example just let me

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:57.580 
over the screen for example just let me
get<00:00:55.280> something<00:00:56.170> let's<00:00:57.170> say<00:00:57.320> this<00:00:57.530> is

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:57.590 
get something let's say this is

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.069 
get something let's say this is
something<00:00:58.160> if<00:00:58.420> because<00:00:59.420> it's<00:00:59.450> raised<00:00:59.809> over

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:00.079 
something if because it's raised over

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:01.420 
something if because it's raised over
top<00:01:00.290> of<00:01:00.320> the<00:01:00.440> screen<00:01:00.620> and<00:01:00.980> put<00:01:01.190> it<00:01:01.280> down<00:01:01.370> like

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:01.430 
top of the screen and put it down like

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.450 
top of the screen and put it down like
that<00:01:01.780> won't<00:01:02.780> scratch<00:01:03.140> the<00:01:03.440> screen<00:01:03.559> because<00:01:04.250> it

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.460 
that won't scratch the screen because it

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.810 
that won't scratch the screen because it
has<00:01:04.610> this<00:01:04.759> over<00:01:05.149> it<00:01:05.210> I<00:01:06.100> have<00:01:07.100> a<00:01:07.130> screen
