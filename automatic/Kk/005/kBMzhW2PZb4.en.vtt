00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:08.770
 inside a room 

00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:11.600
 hermetically closed there is a light bulb 

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:14.240
 and outside the room there are three 

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:16.430
 switches only one of the three 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.380
 turn on the light bulb while the door 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:20.839
 is closed you can press the 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:23.330
 switches as many times as you want but 

00:00:20.839 --> 00:00:24.919
 when opening the door it is necessary to say which of 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:27.490
 the three switches is the one 

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:27.490
 turn on the light bulb 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:33.370
 let's see let's imagine that we keep 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:36.070
 pressed two switches on 1 and 2 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:38.200
 we open the door and the light bulb is 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:40.150
 off it's worth that would mean that the 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.890
 good switch the 3 but if the 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:43.450
 curious the bastard a few cited next to not to 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:44.680
 when we will not know if the 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:45.940
 good switch in a moment to 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.079
 be watching our cars for not 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:51.219
 leave a trace 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:51.219
 let's concentrate 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:56.910
 yes but there is one thing that does not fit what 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:57.960
 would have happened if I did not solve the 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.130
 Enigma of the invitation 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.870
 the numbers in alphabetical order and the 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:03.690
 I solved on the go no one helps you 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.140
 an arrest not even a clue 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.180
 do not 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:11.200
 the books you use leave them sorted 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.200
 in your critical area 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.040
 let's see let's focus on the 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.240
 switches and the bulb the time is 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.770
 just 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.290
 because he fermat this is taking 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:27.120
 so much trouble in getting revenge on you 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:27.120
 but it's with you, enough is enough 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:39.260
 I do not know about us from the matero will think 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.660
 that the simplest method for 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.950
 get it with this room to see me 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:44.510
 I have a theory about what he wants 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.020
 our site please before we go to 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:47.020
 solve the problem 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:54.509
 Y 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.509
 what was missing in the dark 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:16.500
 What you anything 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.330
 you've taken 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.280
 the trick is in the temperature of the 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.200
 light bulbs light a switch on 1 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.209
 we let it pulsate for a while then what 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.040
 we shut down that we face without two we open 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:33.049
 the door if the bulb is on 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.430
 the good switch is 20 if the 

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:35.780
 nozzle was off and warm the 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.489
 switch good health what I know is that 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:39.709
 we have let a little while if the 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:41.480
 Light bulb is off and cold and good are 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:43.580
 3 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.690
 Solved case 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.690
 and there is the solution
