00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.220
 the law continued but my 85 74 when 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.559
 the end 

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:07.729
 one last thing this mission is 

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:09.530
 unlocks immediately after the 

00:00:07.729 --> 00:00:11.200
 previous mission of special someone in 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:13.219
 where jimmy theory is not going to call us 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.350
 telling us that something has gone very 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:16.820
 important and we have to go see it 

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:19.070
 to port tour 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.570
 specifically in the club striptease of 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:22.220
 junkers the club although those who already 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:26.119
 we know this is one of the missions 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:29.300
 most important of gta 4 is a mission 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:32.270
 very very important more than mission is a 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:34.790
 cinematic a little bit long but it's very 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:37.700
 very transcendental in the history of 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:40.580
 game as you realize we are already close to 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:45.110
 the letter j that is from jean and pego ring 

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:48.430
 Well then now we go good 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:50.750
 let's go in to chat with james 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:53.630
 Calm bodyguard is Carmen 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:55.640
 in short when the fed which is the last 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:59.240
 thing that will ask us if I hit queen 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:02.990
 good and we see that he is asking for a glass 

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:05.390
 of vodka and there it is there or as I say 

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:07.159
 this mission is very important as and 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:10.409
 As I repeat, it's not a mission, it's 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:12.929
 a cinematic then I'll let you 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.469
 the dialogues because it is very important what 

00:01:12.929 --> 00:01:15.469
 who are going to talk 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.650
 does not exist 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:25.619
 santa 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.619
 do not 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.790
 ah 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.920
 there is a home 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.530
 Y 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:55.289
 cambric 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.580
 in her 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:11.190
 there is no need to be in the money habit 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.440
 d 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.260
 w 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:41.070
 but no 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.980
 this way 'of october 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:59.830
 good as other accounts and hit me r and no 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:04.120
 he has asked nico to work with 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:06.400
 the Russians something that is very difficult to 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.920
 assimilate that's why I told you that 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:11.050
 this mission is very important because it is 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.270
 very difficult what we have been asked very 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:15.580
 difficult for nico since nico was 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:17.650
 decided to eliminate all Russians in 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:19.810
 special to resign rush carlos but 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:22.510
 well let's call roman for 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:26.050
 tell him about this problem to tell you 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:29.920
 what jimmy has asked us and in passing 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:33.370
 give us your point of view or your advice 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:35.050
 then he tells him that Jimmy has 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:39.160
 asked to work again with 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:41.620
 I resigned and as if roman loose something 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:46.480
 release another possibility of account that 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:49.360
 resigned this x cook and that nico already 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:51.730
 I forgive everything and it is with the whereabouts of 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:54.850
 resign as my armor where 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:57.610
 it opens another window has the 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:59.890
 possibility of helping jimmy 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:02.680
 on the one hand and now has the possibility 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:05.760
 to eliminate dignity that knows its 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:09.700
 current whereabouts is something very complicated 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:12.220
 it's a very very important decision like that 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:14.750
 that I'm going to go to a place a little bit 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:19.790
 contributed or go to bojan 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:21.570
 to be able to think well yes so I'm going 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:23.610
 for that destiny 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:25.740
 it's a mission like I was telling you 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:29.250
 very important since it is a mission of 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:32.670
 decision a decision that will mark the 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:35.260
 end of the game's story or the 

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:37.510
 end of the history of gta 4 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:40.170
 good after the call of roman 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:44.070
 we are also going to call kate to 

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:46.380
 ask him also his point of view 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:48.690
 and the decision to help him a little 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:52.730
 clarify or clarify what you have in your 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:56.040
 head since on the one hand there is money 

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:57.600
 so you'll be paid very well and for 

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:59.940
 another side are the nikko principles 

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:02.960
 true all that revenge I wanted 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:02.960
 do against 

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:08.140
 and credible says that not to continue with 

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:10.060
 its principles and that you do not need 

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:11.980
 money then on the one hand roman wants 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:14.050
 to work with resigns because having 

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:16.240
 much more money but on the other hand is 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:17.920
 Kate who says no because she does not need 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:23.180
 serving a party says that it never goes 

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:25.669
 to know about it then they are decisions 

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:27.409
 and we have to take now we receive a 

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:29.620
 roman message 

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:31.540
 which does not say that 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:35.260
 and well he says good he tried us 

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:40.380
 convince that we choose to work with 

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:40.380
 resigned with the Russians because it will be 

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:49.870
 after another little time we are going to 

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:52.060
 receive another text message other 

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:55.840
 roman message 

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:59.590
 let's say again that we choose the 

00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:01.510
 money are two truth then Roman 

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:03.940
 your week is quite with this but 

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:06.040
 well then seeing the map has two 

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:08.680
 dollar sign options that is the 

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:09.730
 trafficker and the sword sign that is the 

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:13.720
 revenge 

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:16.990
 then the choice is yours if you 

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:19.450
 you decide money or revenge the choice is 

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:23.580
