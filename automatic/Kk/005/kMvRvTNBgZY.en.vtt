00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:23.600
 our goal is the world record he and 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:25.490
 set up posters with the sls select 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.890
 We want to prove that we 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:29.029
 the fastest lap time space 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:31.130
 The challenge for me will be 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:32.960
 that I will without a trial before 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.699
 the first round absolutely at the limit 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.410
 can drive and prove that this 

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:38.120
 car is really fast the range 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.170
 from the father will light up several 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.030
 to drive round 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:44.090
 but after high stress the 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.710
 heat up the batteries and wait a long time 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.540
 and less power 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.340
 of course, we have only one attempt to 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:51.290
 to test the full performance full time 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.520
 if that works today with the 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:54.500
 weather conditions you have to 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:58.000
 look the car in principle is under 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.000
 subject to good circumstances 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:50.640
 The goal is definitely reached 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.100
 any competitors clearly 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.439
 distanced and me 7 and required 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.549
 for 108 minutes that's it 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.549
 knight beat from the supercar
