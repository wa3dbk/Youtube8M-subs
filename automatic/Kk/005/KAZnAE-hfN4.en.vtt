00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.420
 allow the pastry cream 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.729

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:02.100
 governed in fact graded you put a 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.540
 little third of the milk gently and you 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.570

 the street this pan agreement and in 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:20.760
 that suddenly it the hottest and 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:24.920
 wait she sits boiling the gie 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.920
 shuddering there we did well alive 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.300

 good mix of egg yolk and potting soil 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:37.910
 Sugar milk you know well come 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:39.410
 great to come here by contract and from 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.300
 blow that allows what custody magistrate

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:51.350
 bad taste health that the cream starts 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:52.640
 to thicken to thicken either we remove this 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:54.380
 is not used to getting a little bit of 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.630
 I jotna fire at the center of the lumps 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:58.100
 here we whip and we put back on the 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:59.810
 more than conscious jean de gaulle did 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.300
 it allows the starch to explode 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:04.130
 to absorb the water from the milk in fact he's getting 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:13.300
 to make a stir in my hair at 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:16.600
 by the so well done to act cooked 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:18.230
 here is a little boiling online 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.880
 why why it takes 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:21.560
 important as well as with a confectioner 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:27.110
 already for conservation 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:28.730
 that's not good and then we 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:29.900
 comes the little taste of flour eggs or 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:31.730
 millions who can sometimes 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:35.750
 unpleasant that's a minute ago 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:40.220

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:42.890
 already moisturize the press and it comes well 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:45.130
 after his lawyers for not to put any 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:48.860

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:50.450
 a little bit of gelatin they do well 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:53.239
 obviously instantly with the 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:55.250
