00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
top of that I this is a lot of headings

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.000 
top of that I this is a lot of headings
it's<00:02:28.910> a<00:02:29.000> lot<00:02:29.150> of<00:02:29.300> bottling<00:02:29.810> and<00:02:29.870> thus<00:02:30.770> the

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
it's a lot of bottling and thus the

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.880 
it's a lot of bottling and thus the
South<00:02:31.250> championship<00:02:31.820> isn't<00:02:32.150> I<00:02:32.560> we<00:02:33.560> have<00:02:33.680> nine
