previous<00:01:51.730> years<00:01:51.940> before<00:01:52.210> that<00:01:52.330> one<00:01:52.480> more

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:53.320 
previous years before that one more

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.700 
previous years before that one more
pressure<00:01:53.590> as<00:01:53.860> the<00:01:54.310> champion<00:01:54.700> coming<00:01:54.910> here<00:01:55.150> I
