00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.640
 hello welcome once again to the is the 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:53.769
 star 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.260
 we followed with irene we made a video 

00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:59.079
 previous where we have applied the 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:01.329
 makeup on stick the skin fundation 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:03.220
 stick the new definitive boy brown 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:09.040
 that I love for photography to 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:11.080
 we have applied natural corrector 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.150
 with filler and we have also applied 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.850
 lots of transparent powder 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:17.229
 because irene had some brands of 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.580
 imperfections in the skin that with the 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:21.310
 stick we have put a lot of 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:23.320
 we have used the full cover this 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.930
 brush for maximum coverage and has been 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:29.350
 Super've already made enough skin 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:31.900
 pretty pretty and perfect well this 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:35.650
 product that I present now is the new 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:37.390
 for the base of eyes is a long wear 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:38.050
 Long lasting about 8 hours we 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.930
 It allows 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:42.400
 that we hold the eye shadows to 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:44.500
 through instagram a lot of many of 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:47.230
 you ask what are the tones 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.120
 what is the tone that suits me 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:50.320
 I always recommend visiting the stand 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:53.410
 bobby braun because that's where 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:56.320
 you're really going to see what your color is with 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:57.640
 this camera we are going to test the skin and 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:01.270
 then we will go to his 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:04.909
 perfect this for example I do not know if yes what 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:08.560
 can see is medium in dark 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:11.020
 let's put to contrast 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:15.569
 this is the line would be for an eyelid 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:18.989
 for a very clear and good eye 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:22.290
 only three colors have come out three 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:25.410
 toned this is the medium 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:28.300
 and as I say it is being tested 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:30.610
 dermatologically if you have eyes 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:33.640
 sensitive that will come great because 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:37.069
 on the contrary, it will calm you down 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:39.499
 explain how to apply it 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:43.299
 look good to this camera irene we close 

00:02:39.499 --> 00:02:43.299
 the eye I put a quantity 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:49.819
 as you see the format is very easy you can 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:53.060
 apply it easily with the yolk of the 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:55.130
 finger I'm going to extend it with this I get 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.690
 balance the whole eye if we have 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:59.420
 redness will be completely 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:01.430
 hidden and will help me a lot because 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:02.989
 for what I said a long duration 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.750
 in the eyeshadows in both matte 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:08.060
 as spark law as a shine is worth me 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:10.489
 you can look up ok we look at the camera the 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.860
 difference the tone in medium is the 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:14.930
 perfect for irene as you see is how not 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:18.900
 it takes absolutely nothing 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:22.769
 to this camera we see 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:24.930
 it's super nice the three tones but each 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:26.549
 person needs a different one who 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.980
 have very clear skin we will go to like 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:31.079
 and I have in the middle skin we go to the middle 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:33.269
 and maybe for a more tanned skin more 

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:34.110
 darker toast we will put in the middle 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:35.640
 a tulle arch 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:39.650
 let's apply it also in the other eye 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.650
 we look at this camera irene thanks 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:45.640
 as is 

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:45.640
 with the tip of the finger 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.859
 we apply it in the whole eye 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:58.180
 now if you can look here we make a 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:58.180
 general plan 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:23.650
 and here with this pre-base of eyes 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:25.480
 Long wear long lasting as we have 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:27.460
 said about 8 hours we will not 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:29.050
 the eye shadows are split with 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:31.150
 our friend irene 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:32.800

 part of the termination in the next 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:47.530
