and what I generally do is I say as I

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.700 
and what I generally do is I say as I
round<00:01:01.980> them<00:01:02.190> up<00:01:02.340> and<00:01:02.699> then<00:01:03.260> I'll<00:01:04.260> pull<00:01:04.559> out<00:01:04.589> my

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
get out as fast as I

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.940 
get out as fast as I
I<00:01:11.280> think<00:01:11.670> I<00:01:11.729> get<00:01:11.790> a<00:01:11.990> wad<00:01:12.990> of<00:01:13.020> clients<00:01:13.680> just<00:01:13.770> from

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
I think I get a wad of clients just from

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.490 
I think I get a wad of clients just from

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.670 

and<00:01:16.940> these<00:01:17.940> guns<00:01:18.240> aren't<00:01:18.510> pack<00:01:19.410> up<00:01:19.560> on

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:23.010 
strengthen right now so I'm just kind of

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:27.200 
strengthen right now so I'm just kind of
spraying<00:01:23.490> and<00:01:24.260> letting<00:01:25.260> the<00:01:25.380> bullet<00:01:26.030> kick<00:01:27.030> not

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
it's only level 15 it's not that hard to

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.780 
it's only level 15 it's not that hard to
kill<00:01:33.000> without<00:01:33.180> pack<00:01:33.540> a<00:01:33.570> punch<00:01:34.460> but<00:01:35.460> when<00:01:35.700> you

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
kill without pack a punch but when you

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.950 
kill without pack a punch but when you
get<00:01:35.910> into<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.390> higher<00:01:36.600> levels<00:01:38.120> it<00:01:39.120> becomes<00:01:39.660> a

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
get into the higher levels it becomes a

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.610 
get into the higher levels it becomes a
lot<00:01:40.140> harder<00:01:40.350> and<00:01:41.240> my<00:01:42.240> favorite<00:01:42.870> setup<00:01:43.380> or

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
I have right here and I know that mp40

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.390 
I have right here and I know that mp40
is<00:01:55.530> not<00:01:55.650> gonna<00:01:55.740> kill<00:01:56.070> them<00:01:56.280> after<00:01:57.180> like<00:01:57.330> round

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
points because if you're just spraying

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.560 
points because if you're just spraying
all<00:02:08.460> your<00:02:08.610> bullets<00:02:08.850> into<00:02:09.210> them<00:02:09.330> you're<00:02:09.450> going

levels<00:02:25.860> you're<00:02:26.130> gonna<00:02:26.220> need<00:02:26.459> a<00:02:26.520> lot<00:02:26.820> of<00:02:26.850> funds

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
levels you're gonna need a lot of funds

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.740 
levels you're gonna need a lot of funds
because<00:02:27.739> once<00:02:28.739> you<00:02:28.860> get<00:02:28.950> past<00:02:29.250> like<00:02:29.520> 45<00:02:30.120> and<00:02:30.330> 50

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
because once you get past like 45 and 50

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.380 
because once you get past like 45 and 50
you<00:02:30.959> have<00:02:31.140> to<00:02:31.350> start<00:02:31.620> using<00:02:31.739> the<00:02:32.040> turret<00:02:32.459> in<00:02:33.030> a

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
you have to start using the turret in a

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.440 
you have to start using the turret in a
combo<00:02:33.840> with<00:02:34.080> whatever<00:02:34.920> gun<00:02:35.880> you<00:02:36.030> have<00:02:36.209> whether

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
combo with whatever gun you have whether

combo with whatever gun you have whether
it<00:02:36.690> be<00:02:36.840> the<00:02:37.020> regen<00:02:37.890> or<00:02:38.250> the<00:02:38.959> Thunder<00:02:39.959> gun<00:02:40.110> you

it be the regen or the Thunder gun you

it be the regen or the Thunder gun you
have<00:02:40.650> to<00:02:41.120> be<00:02:42.120> gonna<00:02:42.270> have<00:02:42.390> to<00:02:42.510> use<00:02:42.660> the<00:02:42.959> turret

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
have to be gonna have to use the turret

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:49.310 
have to be gonna have to use the turret
right<00:02:43.500> there<00:02:45.019> to<00:02:47.330> kill<00:02:48.330> them<00:02:48.480> because<00:02:48.660> you're

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
right there to kill them because you're

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:52.520 
right there to kill them because you're
gonna<00:02:49.410> run<00:02:49.620> an<00:02:49.769> ammo<00:02:50.040> way<00:02:50.220> too<00:02:50.280> fast<00:02:50.670> and<00:02:51.530> the

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
gonna run an ammo way too fast and the

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.600 
gonna run an ammo way too fast and the
gun<00:02:52.709> that<00:02:52.739> becomes<00:02:53.250> plyos<00:02:53.700> to<00:02:53.820> do<00:02:53.970> that<00:02:54.560> but

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 
gun that becomes plyos to do that but

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:57.949 
gun that becomes plyos to do that but
that<00:02:56.610> that<00:02:57.090> right<00:02:57.239> there<00:02:57.450> is<00:02:57.540> probably<00:02:57.720> the

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
that that right there is probably the

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:01.250 
that that right there is probably the
fastest<00:02:58.560> and<00:02:58.650> easiest<00:02:59.040> way<00:03:00.030> to<00:03:00.180> make<00:03:00.570> money<00:03:00.840> is

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
fastest and easiest way to make money is

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.460 
fastest and easiest way to make money is
just<00:03:01.470> to<00:03:01.680> pick<00:03:02.070> up<00:03:02.250> an<00:03:02.580> mp40<00:03:03.209> or<00:03:03.660> something

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
just to pick up an mp40 or something

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
mp5 right there I just cost for the mp40

mp5 right there I just cost for the mp40
it's<00:03:16.650> the<00:03:16.709> best<00:03:16.920> loans<00:03:17.190> because<00:03:17.870> they're

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
it's the best loans because they're

a pack of punch them you just want to

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.100 
a pack of punch them you just want to
spray<00:03:23.400> so<00:03:24.269> you<00:03:24.330> can<00:03:24.480> get<00:03:24.600> the<00:03:24.720> point

and<00:03:25.860> I<00:03:26.640> know<00:03:26.760> the<00:03:27.030> mp40<00:03:27.540> is<00:03:27.660> not<00:03:27.840> in<00:03:28.020> Ascension

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
and I know the mp40 is not in Ascension

and I know the mp40 is not in Ascension
and<00:03:28.980> I<00:03:29.490> doubt<00:03:29.670> it'll<00:03:29.940> be<00:03:30.090> in<00:03:30.180> the<00:03:30.270> new<00:03:30.420> zombie

map that comes out next week but for

map that comes out next week but for

00:03:37.309 --> 00:03:37.319 
those ones for senton the best one to

those ones for senton the best one to

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:41.580 
use besides the since the mp40 is not

use besides the since the mp40 is not
there<00:03:41.760> is<00:03:41.910> the<00:03:42.240> mp5k<00:03:43.280> which<00:03:44.280> is<00:03:44.550> like<00:03:45.140> the<00:03:46.140> next

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
there is the mp5k which is like the next

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.470 
there is the mp5k which is like the next
gun<00:03:47.250> that<00:03:47.400> you<00:03:47.459> can<00:03:47.580> get<00:03:47.700> after<00:03:48.090> you<00:03:48.209> get<00:03:48.360> out

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
gun that you can get after you get out

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.650 
gun that you can get after you get out
of<00:03:48.510> the<00:03:48.600> first<00:03:48.870> room<00:03:49.170> so<00:03:49.440> it's<00:03:49.620> it's<00:03:50.100> easy<00:03:50.760> to

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
of the first room so it's it's easy to

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:56.230 
of the first room so it's it's easy to
get<00:03:51.810> and<00:03:52.050> I<00:03:53.270> know<00:03:54.270> the<00:03:54.480> MPL<00:03:55.080> is<00:03:55.500> on<00:03:55.830> that<00:03:55.980> map

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:56.240 
get and I know the MPL is on that map

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:59.510 
get and I know the MPL is on that map
but<00:03:57.240> it's<00:03:57.420> just<00:03:57.690> a<00:03:57.870> waste<00:03:58.050> you'll<00:03:58.920> run<00:03:59.340> out<00:03:59.490> of

00:03:59.510 --> 00:03:59.520 
but it's just a waste you'll run out of

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:03.170 
but it's just a waste you'll run out of
ammo<00:04:00.000> way<00:04:00.540> too<00:04:00.600> fast<00:04:01.050> and<00:04:01.610> it<00:04:02.610> just<00:04:02.910> becomes

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
ammo way too fast and it just becomes

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:07.460 
ammo way too fast and it just becomes
inconvenient<00:04:03.930> to<00:04:04.170> have<00:04:04.200> the<00:04:04.470> gun<00:04:04.650> but<00:04:06.470> this

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
inconvenient to have the gun but this

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.710 
inconvenient to have the gun but this
this<00:04:07.980> is<00:04:08.130> how<00:04:08.250> I<00:04:08.280> make<00:04:08.550> a<00:04:08.850> lot<00:04:09.150> of<00:04:09.180> money<00:04:09.420> doing

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
this is how I make a lot of money doing

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:15.199 
this is how I make a lot of money doing
it<00:04:10.040> for<00:04:11.040> points<00:04:11.550> I<00:04:11.670> guess<00:04:12.170> and<00:04:13.790> this<00:04:14.790> strategy

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209 
it for points I guess and this strategy

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:18.289 
it for points I guess and this strategy
right<00:04:15.780> here<00:04:16.049> this<00:04:16.349> I<00:04:16.789> wouldn't<00:04:17.789> start<00:04:18.120> out

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
right here this I wouldn't start out

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:20.420 
right here this I wouldn't start out
trying<00:04:18.599> to<00:04:18.690> do<00:04:18.840> this<00:04:19.020> I<00:04:19.380> would<00:04:19.470> run<00:04:19.770> around<00:04:19.979> the

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
trying to do this I would run around the

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:23.240 
trying to do this I would run around the
whole<00:04:20.640> stage<00:04:21.060> and<00:04:21.539> round<00:04:21.840> them<00:04:21.959> up<00:04:22.160> after<00:04:23.160> you

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
whole stage and round them up after you

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:26.390 
whole stage and round them up after you
get<00:04:23.400> that<00:04:23.610> one<00:04:23.880> down<00:04:24.060> you<00:04:24.330> can<00:04:24.539> go<00:04:24.660> back<00:04:24.870> to<00:04:25.400> you

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
get that one down you can go back to you

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:27.650 
get that one down you can go back to you
can<00:04:26.550> go<00:04:26.700> to<00:04:26.760> this<00:04:27.000> one<00:04:27.210> where<00:04:27.450> you're<00:04:27.630> just

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:27.660 
can go to this one where you're just

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:29.390 
can go to this one where you're just
grounding<00:04:28.140> them<00:04:28.200> on<00:04:28.380> the<00:04:28.500> front<00:04:28.740> part<00:04:29.010> and<00:04:29.310> it

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:29.400 
grounding them on the front part and it

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.880 
grounding them on the front part and it
just<00:04:29.580> keeps<00:04:29.820> them<00:04:29.910> in<00:04:30.030> a<00:04:30.120> tighter<00:04:30.390> group<00:04:30.890> it's

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:31.890 
just keeps them in a tighter group it's

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:34.640 
just keeps them in a tighter group it's
a<00:04:32.010> little<00:04:32.220> bit<00:04:32.340> more<00:04:32.490> difficult<00:04:33.000> but<00:04:33.470> when<00:04:34.470> you

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.650 
a little bit more difficult but when you

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:37.460 
a little bit more difficult but when you
it<00:04:35.160> becomes<00:04:35.580> a<00:04:35.669> lot<00:04:36.050> easier<00:04:37.050> after<00:04:37.169> you<00:04:37.349> get
