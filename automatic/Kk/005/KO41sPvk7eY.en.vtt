 puntocom now I'm going to show you the 

00:00:05.439 --> 00:00:09.490
 shake that I make almost every morning 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:13.480
 we are in November has started the 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:16.270
 autumn and they no longer sell watermelon but good 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:19.060
 the pineapple is a bit growing now here 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:21.690
 but they do it well I can not find it 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:25.390
 then messi must use the watermelon 

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:27.580
 I use the pineapple and it does even a 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:29.260
 little bit richer then now I'm going to 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:30.880
 show how to make material for some 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:34.320
 person 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:36.890
 and simply 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.890
 cut 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:39.899
 bits 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.790
 well of pineapple and a banana 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:55.450
 I took off the quickie shell I took 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:58.000
 the time but it's a few minutes that I 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:59.490
 I take care to prepare my castilla every 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.280
 morning 

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:06.060
 is what I do on the beach to train 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:08.610
 every morning about nine thirty I 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:14.480
 I meet my friend and my granddaughter 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:18.740
 accompanies us we train together 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:20.870
 I train that he lives there 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.420
 sometimes he stays a little longer and then he 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:26.990
 they have a coffee but I come home 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:29.980
 I prepare my milkshake this came to me part 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.500
 in 2008 like this 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:33.390
 much 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:41.850
 and later 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:41.850
 with this and the following water 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:51.760
 emotions up here either about two 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:54.670
 centimeters you notice the water then what 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:57.820
 that I never do is measure is worked 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:00.730
 with spoonfuls teaspoons we achieve and 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:05.200
 I simply go to the eye and to taste 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:09.750
 then a calculation that is a spoonful 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.750
 more or less ok for a person 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:19.800
 and then what was done to me and also 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:22.540
 it's very little but it changes the flavor 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:27.209
 He also calculated one more spoonful or 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.209
 less if it is more 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:35.220
 and now I show you 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:56.060
 do not 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:03:00.099
 20 seconds 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:05.319
 and they leave little if they do not like it in excess 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:05.319
 they throw a little more water 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:13.760
 one more lap 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:17.870
 and even delicious milkshake who believes that 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:20.150
 fattening a piece of pineapple or banana 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.630
 a spoonful of protein a spoonful 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:25.670
