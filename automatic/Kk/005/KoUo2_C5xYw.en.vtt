00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:47.320 

is<00:03:38.500> just

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:47.330 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:48.880 

again<00:03:47.600> switching<00:03:47.930> over<00:03:48.140> to<00:03:48.290> her<00:03:48.470> left<00:03:48.680> hand

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.140 

I<00:03:52.650> think<00:03:52.890> she<00:03:52.980> has<00:03:53.099> to<00:03:53.129> hit<00:03:53.370> this<00:03:53.519> with<00:03:53.670> the

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
I think she has to hit this with the

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.740 
I think she has to hit this with the
side<00:03:54.540> spin<00:03:54.780> as<00:03:54.930> well

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
side spin as well

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:00.370 
side spin as well
gutsy<00:03:57.530> call<00:03:57.740> there<00:03:58.630> gutsy<00:03:59.630> call<00:03:59.840> to<00:04:00.020> play<00:04:00.170> that

left-handed and then bumped a the three

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:03.820 
left-handed and then bumped a the three
that's<00:04:02.420> quite<00:04:02.750> asking<00:04:03.170> quite<00:04:03.320> a<00:04:03.350> lot<00:04:03.590> there

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:03.830 
that's quite asking quite a lot there

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:06.800 
that's quite asking quite a lot there

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:14.280 
pocket
these<00:04:13.209> are<00:04:13.360> a<00:04:13.390> little<00:04:13.480> smaller<00:04:13.900> this<00:04:14.110> is<00:04:14.260> a

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:14.290 
these are a little smaller this is a

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:18.050 
these are a little smaller this is a
little<00:04:14.410> small<00:04:14.739> pocket<00:04:15.130> to<00:04:15.220> shoot<00:04:15.430> out<00:04:15.580> here

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.449 

I<00:04:18.150> think<00:04:18.630> before<00:04:18.810> will<00:04:19.350> pass<00:04:19.680> the<00:04:19.950> six<00:04:20.220> ball

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
I think before will pass the six ball

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:27.590 
I think before will pass the six ball
though

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.890 

pass<00:04:27.930> to<00:04:28.140> six

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:29.900 
pass to six

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:34.620 
pass to six

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:36.210 

no<00:04:34.750> you<00:04:34.810> heard<00:04:35.080> me<00:04:35.200> say<00:04:35.380> this<00:04:35.410> before<00:04:35.560> but<00:04:36.100> this

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:36.220 
no you heard me say this before but this

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:39.129 
no you heard me say this before but this
is<00:04:36.370> a<00:04:36.400> wide<00:04:36.700> open<00:04:36.730> rack

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:39.139 
is a wide open rack

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:47.970 
is a wide open rack
we<00:04:39.259> anticipate<00:04:39.680> any<00:04:40.189> problems

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:47.980 

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:51.950 

oh<00:04:48.070> she<00:04:48.280> played<00:04:48.580> the<00:04:48.610> combination

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:51.960 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:53.930 

it's<00:04:52.500> hard<00:04:52.800> for<00:04:52.979> us<00:04:53.069> to<00:04:53.100> see<00:04:53.370> those<00:04:53.550> angles

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:53.940 
it's hard for us to see those angles

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:55.189 
it's hard for us to see those angles
from<00:04:54.030> up<00:04:54.180> here<00:04:54.419> because<00:04:54.660> that's<00:04:54.840> all<00:04:54.960> the<00:04:55.080> way

00:04:55.189 --> 00:04:55.199

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:54.130 
I think she wanted to go higher and she

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:55.650 
I think she wanted to go higher and she
sat<00:05:54.460> in<00:05:54.490> the<00:05:54.670> corner<00:05:54.910> she<00:05:55.090> may<00:05:55.240> have<00:05:55.390> to<00:05:55.420> shoot

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:55.660

00:05:58.110 --> 00:05:58.120 
27 she's looking right now at the corner

00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:59.490 
27 she's looking right now at the corner
she's<00:05:58.630> probably<00:05:58.750> gonna<00:05:58.990> look<00:05:59.140> at<00:05:59.200> the<00:05:59.290> side

00:05:59.490 --> 00:05:59.500 
she's probably gonna look at the side

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:03.370 
she's probably gonna look at the side
pocket<00:05:59.920> too

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:03.380 

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:05.050 

she's<00:06:03.650> kind<00:06:03.860> of<00:06:03.920> we<00:06:04.130> call<00:06:04.310> it<00:06:04.400> the<00:06:04.430> 50-yard

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:05.060 
she's kind of we call it the 50-yard

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:06.760 
she's kind of we call it the 50-yard
line<00:06:05.270> as<00:06:05.570> to<00:06:05.810> whether<00:06:06.320> you<00:06:06.530> shoot<00:06:06.710> that

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:06.770 
line as to whether you shoot that

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:08.679 
line as to whether you shoot that
quarter<00:06:07.430> of<00:06:07.520> the<00:06:07.610> side

00:06:08.679 --> 00:06:08.689 
quarter of the side

00:06:08.689 --> 00:06:10.269 
quarter of the side

00:06:10.269 --> 00:06:10.279 
I would take the corner I think it's a

00:06:10.279 --> 00:06:12.070

much<00:06:10.459> easier<00:06:10.489> shot<00:06:11.119> in<00:06:11.360> that<00:06:11.449> small<00:06:11.809> side

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:12.080 
much easier shot in that small side

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:14.800 
much easier shot in that small side
