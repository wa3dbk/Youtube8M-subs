bit a fret buzz
in<00:01:34.050> one<00:01:34.500> of<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.680> strings<00:01:35.040> and<00:01:35.430> I'm<00:01:36.180> going<00:01:36.390> to

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
in one of the strings and I'm going to

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.960 
in one of the strings and I'm going to
talk<00:01:36.630> to<00:01:36.870> the<00:01:37.020> store<00:01:37.320> no<00:01:38.190> fixing<00:01:38.640> that<00:01:38.760> because

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
talk to the store no fixing that because

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.250 
talk to the store no fixing that because
I<00:01:39.060> think<00:01:39.120> it<00:01:39.300> has<00:01:39.390> to<00:01:39.450> do<00:01:39.600> with<00:01:39.750> saddle

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:40.260 
I think it has to do with saddle

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.220 
I think it has to do with saddle
thinking<00:01:40.560> maybe<00:01:40.680> fix<00:01:41.010> not<00:01:41.280> make<00:01:41.550> it<00:01:41.700> less<00:01:42.230> just

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:43.230 
thinking maybe fix not make it less just

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:44.780 
thinking maybe fix not make it less just
because<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.500> actions<00:01:43.980> really<00:01:44.340> really<00:01:44.580> low<00:01:44.760> on

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
because the actions really really low on

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.980 
because the actions really really low on
so<00:01:45.420> you<00:01:45.870> can<00:01:46.050> see<00:01:47.090> that's<00:01:48.090> pretty<00:01:48.450> low<00:01:48.660> for<00:01:48.690> an

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
so you can see that's pretty low for an

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:56.210 
so you can see that's pretty low for an
acoustic<00:01:52.400> yeah<00:01:53.840> so<00:01:54.840> anyways<00:01:55.229> now<00:01:55.740> I'm<00:01:55.770> gonna
