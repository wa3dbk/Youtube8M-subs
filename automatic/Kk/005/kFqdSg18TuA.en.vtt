there now we talked about the all-season
capabilities<00:00:56.940> but<00:00:57.180> if<00:00:57.300> we<00:00:57.390> look<00:00:57.510> at<00:00:57.629> it<00:00:57.690> from<00:00:57.780> a

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
capabilities but if we look at it from a

capabilities but if we look at it from a
handling<00:00:58.289> standpoint<00:00:58.800> its<00:00:58.949> using<00:00:59.160> a<00:00:59.219> couple

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
handling standpoint its using a couple

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.910 
handling standpoint its using a couple
key<00:00:59.640> features<00:00:59.670> here<00:01:00.180> from<00:01:00.750> even<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.649> front

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
key features here from even the front

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.470 
key features here from even the front
tire<00:01:02.070> is<00:01:02.160> gonna<00:01:02.309> be<00:01:02.399> a<00:01:02.430> mono<00:01:02.670> compound<00:01:03.180> single

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
tire is gonna be a mono compound single

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.939 
tire is gonna be a mono compound single
compound<00:01:03.840> throughout<00:01:04.530> it's<00:01:04.680> gonna<00:01:04.769> be<00:01:04.920> a

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
compound throughout it's gonna be a

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.320 
compound throughout it's gonna be a
medium<00:01:05.309> compound<00:01:05.760> and<00:01:05.909> again<00:01:06.090> you're<00:01:06.240> getting

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
medium compound and again you're getting

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.929 
medium compound and again you're getting
a<00:01:06.540> balance<00:01:07.200> of<00:01:07.320> performance<00:01:07.439> and<00:01:07.830> mileage<00:01:08.280> out

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
a balance of performance and mileage out

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.399 
a balance of performance and mileage out
of<00:01:09.210> this<00:01:09.420> tire<00:01:09.630> it's<00:01:09.810> gonna<00:01:09.930> be<00:01:10.049> a<00:01:10.080> step<00:01:10.290> up

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
of this tire it's gonna be a step up

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.109 
of this tire it's gonna be a step up
from<00:01:10.500> something<00:01:10.860> like<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.100> Azzaro<00:01:11.460> moving

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
from something like the Azzaro moving

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.190 
from something like the Azzaro moving
into<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.330> rear<00:01:12.479> now<00:01:12.659> we're<00:01:12.810> in<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:12.990> dual

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
into the rear now we're in the dual

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.630 
into the rear now we're in the dual
compound<00:01:13.650> land<00:01:13.920> is<00:01:14.040> actually<00:01:14.189> three

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
compound land is actually three

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.249 
compound land is actually three
compounds<00:01:15.119> and<00:01:15.240> it's<00:01:15.360> interesting<00:01:15.600> how

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
compounds and it's interesting how

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:17.330 
compounds and it's interesting how
they've<00:01:16.470> laid<00:01:16.680> them<00:01:16.860> out<00:01:16.950> so<00:01:17.130> you<00:01:17.189> have<00:01:17.250> a

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
they've laid them out so you have a

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.910 
they've laid them out so you have a
stiffer<00:01:17.610> more<00:01:17.880> firm<00:01:18.119> compound<00:01:18.600> for<00:01:19.200> mileage

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
stiffer more firm compound for mileage

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.560 
stiffer more firm compound for mileage
across<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.640> center<00:01:20.850> of<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.030> tire<00:01:21.210> so<00:01:21.240> you<00:01:21.450> can

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
across the center of the tire so you can

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.270 
across the center of the tire so you can
get<00:01:21.689> better<00:01:21.869> longevity<00:01:22.080> as<00:01:22.500> you<00:01:22.860> move<00:01:23.009> to<00:01:23.159> the

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
get better longevity as you move to the

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.320 
get better longevity as you move to the
shoulder<00:01:23.580> you're<00:01:23.729> gonna<00:01:23.820> get<00:01:24.000> more<00:01:24.180> of<00:01:24.270> a

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
shoulder you're gonna get more of a

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.510 
shoulder you're gonna get more of a
medium-firm<00:01:24.720> compound<00:01:25.470> which<00:01:25.860> really<00:01:26.130> you

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
medium-firm compound which really you

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.910 
medium-firm compound which really you
know<00:01:26.640> it's<00:01:26.820> it's<00:01:27.090> it's<00:01:27.509> not<00:01:27.659> quite<00:01:27.900> as<00:01:28.470> firm<00:01:28.770> as

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
know it's it's it's not quite as firm as

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.499 
know it's it's it's not quite as firm as
what<00:01:29.159> the<00:01:29.250> front<00:01:29.460> is<00:01:29.610> throughout<00:01:30.030> but<00:01:30.420> the

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
what the front is throughout but the

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:31.640 
what the front is throughout but the
nice<00:01:30.659> part<00:01:30.869> about<00:01:30.900> this<00:01:31.110> tire<00:01:31.290> is<00:01:31.439> there's<00:01:31.590> a

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
nice part about this tire is there's a

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.109 
nice part about this tire is there's a
third<00:01:31.920> compound<00:01:32.369> that<00:01:32.460> kind<00:01:32.640> of<00:01:32.700> marries<00:01:33.000> the

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
third compound that kind of marries the

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.609 
third compound that kind of marries the
two<00:01:33.270> and<00:01:33.390> lives<00:01:33.570> behind<00:01:33.900> so<00:01:34.229> what<00:01:34.320> you<00:01:34.409> get<00:01:34.590> is

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
two and lives behind so what you get is

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.109 
two and lives behind so what you get is
as<00:01:34.829> you<00:01:34.920> transition<00:01:35.430> off<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:35.729> center<00:01:35.970> of<00:01:36.060> the

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
as you transition off the center of the

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.160 
as you transition off the center of the
tire<00:01:36.270> onto<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.689> shoulder<00:01:36.960> of<00:01:37.049> that

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
tire onto the shoulder of that

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.170 
tire onto the shoulder of that
transversal<00:01:37.890> area<00:01:38.220> you<00:01:38.579> get<00:01:38.729> a<00:01:38.759> smoother

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
transversal area you get a smoother

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.490 
transversal area you get a smoother
transition<00:01:39.659> you're<00:01:39.750> gonna<00:01:39.840> feel<00:01:40.110> it<00:01:40.229> a<00:01:40.320> little

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
transition you're gonna feel it a little

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.740 
transition you're gonna feel it a little
less<00:01:40.680> it's<00:01:41.100> also<00:01:41.250> variable<00:01:42.000> belting<00:01:42.479> so<00:01:42.600> what

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
less it's also variable belting so what

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:43.730 
less it's also variable belting so what
that<00:01:42.869> allows<00:01:43.079> you<00:01:43.200> to<00:01:43.259> do<00:01:43.380> is<00:01:43.500> have<00:01:43.560> different

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
that allows you to do is have different

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.410 
that allows you to do is have different
areas<00:01:43.979> of<00:01:44.130> stiffness<00:01:44.399> on<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:44.790> tire<00:01:44.970> so<00:01:45.390> that

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
areas of stiffness on the tire so that

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.389 
areas of stiffness on the tire so that
as<00:01:45.720> you're<00:01:45.990> leaning<00:01:46.409> and<00:01:46.560> as<00:01:46.950> you're<00:01:47.189> as

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
as you're leaning and as you're as

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.399
