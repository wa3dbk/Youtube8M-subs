battle phase so maybe one or two copies
I<00:03:45.570> think<00:03:45.959> two's<00:03:46.200> bit<00:03:46.410> of<00:03:46.500> reach<00:03:46.709> but<00:03:47.280> you<00:03:47.730> could

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
I think two's bit of reach but you could

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:49.699 
I think two's bit of reach but you could
probably<00:03:48.090> do<00:03:48.330> it<00:03:48.360> playing<00:03:48.840> one<00:03:49.260> of<00:03:49.440> I<00:03:49.650> don't

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
probably do it playing one of I don't

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:51.740 
probably do it playing one of I don't
think<00:03:50.010> it<00:03:50.160> really<00:03:50.430> hurts<00:03:50.790> that<00:03:50.910> much<00:03:51.150> to<00:03:51.540> play

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
think it really hurts that much to play

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.470 
think it really hurts that much to play
it<00:03:51.900> and<00:03:52.110> it<00:03:52.620> is<00:03:52.769> an<00:03:52.980> eternity<00:03:53.340> barrier<00:03:53.700> anytime

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
it and it is an eternity barrier anytime

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.180 
it and it is an eternity barrier anytime
during<00:03:54.720> the<00:03:54.870> battle<00:03:55.110> phase<00:03:55.230> period<00:03:55.860> it<00:03:56.100> could

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
during the battle phase period it could

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:58.190 
during the battle phase period it could
be<00:03:56.280> anything<00:03:56.549> and<00:03:56.970> honest<00:03:57.540> whatever

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
be anything and honest whatever

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:02.509 
be anything and honest whatever

consistently<00:04:18.750> I<00:04:18.900> know<00:04:19.080> I<00:04:19.440> tried<00:04:19.709> it<00:04:19.859> out<00:04:19.979> just

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:20.640 
consistently I know I tried it out just

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:21.110 
consistently I know I tried it out just
a<00:04:20.760> little<00:04:20.789> bit

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 
a little bit

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.520 
a little bit

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.210 
there and if they do something that

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:42.150 
there and if they do something that
their<00:04:40.570> archetype<00:04:41.200> supposed<00:04:41.620> to<00:04:41.770> do<00:04:41.919> when<00:04:42.070> they

do it consistently you can still die
like<00:04:45.370> that<00:04:45.580> doesn't<00:04:46.360> change<00:04:46.660> just<00:04:47.320> because

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:47.530 
like that doesn't change just because

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:49.440 
like that doesn't change just because
net<00:04:48.160> crows<00:04:48.400> was<00:04:48.580> apparently<00:04:48.940> the<00:04:49.060> best<00:04:49.240> deck

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:49.450 
net crows was apparently the best deck

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:52.920 
net crows was apparently the best deck
like<00:04:50.430> battlin<00:04:51.430> boxer<00:04:51.880> could<00:04:52.360> still<00:04:52.600> punch

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:11.320 
this crap you get in it this is what I'm

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:12.090 
this crap you get in it this is what I'm
talking<00:05:11.740> about<00:05:11.800> right

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:12.100 
talking about right

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:15.210 
talking about right
this<00:05:12.640> set<00:05:13.390> is<00:05:13.660> something<00:05:14.470> that<00:05:14.890> should<00:05:15.070> happen

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:15.220 
this set is something that should happen

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:17.610 
this set is something that should happen
more<00:05:15.760> often<00:05:15.970> but<00:05:16.360> then<00:05:16.570> I<00:05:16.600> guess<00:05:16.990> if<00:05:17.290> they

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:17.620 
more often but then I guess if they

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:20.460 
more often but then I guess if they
didn't<00:05:18.010> give<00:05:18.460> us<00:05:18.640> shitty<00:05:19.330> cards<00:05:19.750> in<00:05:19.900> sets

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:20.470 
didn't give us shitty cards in sets

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:22.200 
didn't give us shitty cards in sets
perhaps<00:05:21.310> we<00:05:21.460> wouldn't<00:05:21.639> be<00:05:21.880> able<00:05:22.000> to

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:22.210 
perhaps we wouldn't be able to

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:25.590 
perhaps we wouldn't be able to
appreciate<00:05:22.510> it<00:05:22.810> so<00:05:24.030> like<00:05:25.030> everybody<00:05:25.240> watch
