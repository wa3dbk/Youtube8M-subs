00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:09.700
 hit here and hello to all men use today we deal 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.700
 with its own theme namely Davos 

00:00:13.869 --> 00:00:16.679
 I know you are something you get used to 

00:00:16.679 --> 00:00:18.140
 delicate topics 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:20.039
 Fitz us not so my specialty 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.679
 but today I have seen a video that fascinates and fascinates me so much 

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:27.759
 he also has not too easy with HarmoS and parts must actually synonymous 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:30.460
 as I said, safer 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:32.800
 Linked to SPD OV 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.150
 in the information window 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:39.110
 you can even tell her it was very neat 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:41.560
 even find 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:43.960
 that is mandatory dpa 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.890
 in this world 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:47.900
 Spoorendonk 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.900
 since they themselves turn off requirement for 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:54.830
 the hands on this video is based around 

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:57.830
 to have seen the other video just mentioned 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.760
 constantly one sets for the topic and question you 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.140
 Do you believe what useful room zertert 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:11.010
 or do you think 8 at the latest to black hair 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.730
 the gifted songwriter day my personal opinion is allowed 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:19.110
 that he is telling the truth I see no reason why should 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:21.430
 because he 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.549
 from renting there is still nothing about the 

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:28.880
 Credibility of a person but especially since he is qualified something to 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.280
 judge 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.460
 and so it is also likely that the government is such a 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.870
 rebirth 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:37.200
 secret project 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.990
 Another question that opens up is angry 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.000
 Do you think that was really built from the outside? 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.110
 or the program 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.180
 that were from the government there 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.180
 unlike Blatter of course in Bamberg at all 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:56.260
 My opinion here is of course again that agree with the organic 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.890
 because yes 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.159
 I can not imagine that the technology of humanity in secret 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:05.840
 has progressed so far 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.840
 that it could be expanded so far 

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:14.089
 As I said, everything is possible I could not imagine 

00:02:15.389 --> 00:02:18.389
 what is your opinion on this after watching the video? 

00:02:19.429 --> 00:02:21.629
 soft is totally 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:23.489
 excited 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:25.049
 Korntal 

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:26.929
 just inside 

00:02:26.929 --> 00:02:30.249
 because that this technology really exists 

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:35.149
 that's just fantastic 

00:02:35.149 --> 00:02:38.819
 if you imagine that a gravitational field is actually created and 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:39.709
 that then 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:43.980
 so raise a swiping subject and when he does not call her to the job also Klose 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:45.609
 and then 

00:02:45.609 --> 00:02:47.299
 to become that too 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:49.749
 flexible maneuvers is capable 

00:02:49.749 --> 00:02:52.649
 What a ban for swimmers that is resolved 

00:02:52.649 --> 00:02:55.929
 hikes 

00:02:55.929 --> 00:02:58.929
 on condition that she believes she saw Bucher 

00:02:59.969 --> 00:03:02.689
 what do you think 

00:03:02.689 --> 00:03:05.939
 what this and all ufo-sighting are on the move 

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:08.349
 are that this 

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:11.679
 Hagen gave the stored 

00:03:11.679 --> 00:03:12.530
 Info 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:14.909
 one of these trees post 

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:16.669
 to be tested 

00:03:16.669 --> 00:03:18.709
 or Centers 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:19.609
 perhaps 

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:21.839
 he's aliens right now 

00:03:21.839 --> 00:03:23.579
 visit the earth 

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:27.599
 came to the skeptics and I would like to say that also Popper Sarpei and 

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:28.989
 the kicker was 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:31.729
 previously project has been allocated 

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:34.729
 if you want to give them the believe 

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:42.299
 seen to death or crushed with your own eyes already 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:45.870
 but he tells is just so believable and percent noted 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:49.279
 Fourth and explains the whole process so logically 

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:53.949
 Im simply having to believe in Meiningen 

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:55.889
 my Hannover 

00:03:55.889 --> 00:03:58.200
 that's why you should really watch the video 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.489
 if it has not done yet 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:05.199
 for those of you the songs I do not have power I have 

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:08.359
 also with the Protestants in German it probably also like that 

00:04:10.529 --> 00:04:13.199
 this topic area this 

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:15.439
 this experience he had 

00:04:15.439 --> 00:04:18.439
 his work how this technology works 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:21.379
 comment 

00:04:21.379 --> 00:04:23.710
 that was in shape for me 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:25.400
 commerce 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.400
 Resident of a video 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.990
 not to hear what has been achieved 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:34.879
 and why 

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:35.860
 if you keep your eyes open
