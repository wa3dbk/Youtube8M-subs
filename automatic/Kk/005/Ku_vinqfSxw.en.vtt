 besides him, nothing else to put 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:33.960

 pores it is really so cream pretty 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.799
 good but for mature skin he 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.689
 probably not fit well stereo 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:55.079
 really hung us on young skin 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:58.320
 it dries a little dries the skin 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:02:07.539
 this is the lightest shade 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:09.179
 so what shade is it not written it 

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:14.410

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:18.340
 he is such a beige no 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:20.349
 pink effects he does not give a little he 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.940
 get on the skin but with careful 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:27.879
 feathering it all out 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:29.640
 masks well even some defects 

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:32.880
 skin he's good 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:37.209
 disguise and come true very smoothly and 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:39.239
 unnoticed for its price it is 159 rubles 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:43.030

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:48.910
 best quality fits further 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:51.730
 faberlic firebird in tonal series 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.860
 cream do not think that he is more so for 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:56.349
 aged skin 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:03:00.430
 his hue goes to a pink tone 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:03:05.530
 a bit so a little not bad it 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:07.870
 Of course, but with a one-time camera 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:11.769
 of course does not pass absolutely to 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:15.090
 Sorry so this cream is pretty 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:18.790
 bold so i only use it 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:21.910
 me a period of time in the cold on so 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:26.980
 pink cheeks he also does these things 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:29.370
 copes well with matting and bottom 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:32.410
 covering 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:34.680
 we also masks some i well 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:34.680
 tuoi 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:41.799
 but after a while the skin is oily 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:46.690
 I have a shine that is oil in which 

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:49.419
 enter so much concealer probably 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:52.030
 here are the oils and he will not overhear completely 

00:03:49.419 --> 00:03:55.780
 the round will give up the shine you need 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:59.470
 enjoy the powder tusnya and 4 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:03.099
 inside Ayrton with moisturizing oxygen 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:04.900
 complex not jojoba oil vitamins and 

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:07.200
 that's what jojoba oil i'm not 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:09.750
 noticed first but 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:13.410
 and very much in vain because the cream is very 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:16.139
 very greasy and immediately after application it 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:21.650
 you push will also create 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:25.919
 film and it's pretty dark even 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:29.700
 leaves here you can even see here this one 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:33.080
 kremchik firebird cargo and this and even more so 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:35.700
 Here goes to the fact that someone is pink 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:38.400
 cold pink tone is generally cold 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:40.650
 pink tone it gives very greasy for 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:43.320
 oily skin unsuitable for a long time its not 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:45.540
 I use the t-zone at all afraid of 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:49.650
 It does not seem to apply just any there 

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:51.750
 probably a couple of clogs though this 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:55.010
 was not observed but it is fat on just 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:58.050
 however, he has spf20 that is 

00:04:55.010 --> 00:05:00.229
 sunny day dadesh what sun 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:02.880
 Nick is a summer day 

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:05.970
 not suitable because fat well 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:09.000
 probably in the fall and spring 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:12.560
 to heighten the moisture somehow 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.940

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:18.090
