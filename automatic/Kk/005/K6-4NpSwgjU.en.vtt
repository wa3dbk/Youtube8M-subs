00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
really horrible of getting these kill

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.560 
really horrible of getting these kill
streaks<00:00:52.260> on<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:53.100> repair<00:00:53.520> or<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:54.000> ac-130

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
streaks on the repair or the ac-130

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.319

what's<00:00:55.530> going<00:00:55.649> to<00:00:55.710> be<00:00:55.770> doing<00:00:55.920> so<00:00:56.280> well<00:00:56.460> yeah

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
what's going to be doing so well yeah

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.420 
what's going to be doing so well yeah
definitely<00:00:57.930> see<00:00:58.260> town<00:00:58.500> is<00:00:58.680> a<00:00:58.710> really<00:00:59.070> cool<00:00:59.219> map

I<00:00:59.579> think<00:00:59.730> it's<00:00:59.820> one<00:00:59.940> of<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.090> more<00:01:00.440> balanced

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
I think it's one of the more balanced

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.650 
I think it's one of the more balanced
ones<00:01:01.710> it's<00:01:02.039> not<00:01:02.190> really<00:01:02.550> that<00:01:02.699> bad<00:01:03.000> but<00:01:03.420> for

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
ones it's not really that bad but for

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.600 
ones it's not really that bad but for
killstreaks<00:01:04.140> it<00:01:04.379> is<00:01:04.559> really<00:01:04.949> really<00:01:05.100> bad<00:01:05.220> I've

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.380 
noticed that as well but you know where
you<00:01:08.070> really<00:01:08.340> need<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.580> killstreaks<00:01:09.060> to<00:01:09.180> get

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
I've been to the extent that they did

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.800 
I've been to the extent that they did
and<00:02:49.770> also<00:02:50.190> it<00:02:50.640> kind<00:02:50.940> of<00:02:51.000> shows<00:02:51.209> like<00:02:51.390> you<00:02:51.690> know

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
and also it kind of shows like you know

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.840 
and also it kind of shows like you know
the<00:02:52.020> developers<00:02:52.500> definitely<00:02:53.010> do<00:02:53.220> realize

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
the developers definitely do realize

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.050 
the developers definitely do realize
when<00:02:54.090> certain<00:02:54.360> guns<00:02:54.690> are<00:02:54.990> super<00:02:55.500> far<00:02:55.740> off

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
when certain guns are super far off

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.699 
when certain guns are super far off
balance<00:02:57.060> wise<00:02:57.240> from<00:02:57.600> other<00:02:57.750> ones<00:02:58.020> which<00:02:58.470> makes

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
balance wise from other ones which makes

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:00.500 
balance wise from other ones which makes
me<00:02:58.830> wonder<00:02:59.040> why<00:02:59.400> like<00:02:59.700> you<00:02:59.910> know<00:03:00.000> I<00:03:00.240> think<00:03:00.420> it's

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
me wonder why like you know I think it's

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.840 
me wonder why like you know I think it's
like<00:03:00.630> the<00:03:00.780> PM<00:03:01.620> 9<00:03:01.860> or<00:03:02.160> something<00:03:02.370> like<00:03:02.430> that<00:03:02.490> is

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
like the PM 9 or something like that is

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:04.490 
like the PM 9 or something like that is
even<00:03:03.090> in<00:03:03.240> the<00:03:03.360> game<00:03:03.540> it's<00:03:03.810> like<00:03:03.900> an<00:03:03.959> SMG<00:03:04.350> I

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
even in the game it's like an SMG I

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.230 
even in the game it's like an SMG I
think<00:03:04.830> that<00:03:04.950> might<00:03:05.070> be<00:03:05.130> the<00:03:05.250> weapon<00:03:05.490> but<00:03:05.760> don't

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:06.240 
think that might be the weapon but don't

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:09.110 
think that might be the weapon but don't
you<00:03:06.330> get<00:03:06.450> like<00:03:06.600> right<00:03:06.720> before<00:03:06.870> the<00:03:07.260> mp7<00:03:08.190> yeah

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
you get like right before the mp7 yeah

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.940 
you get like right before the mp7 yeah

but<00:03:26.489> I<00:03:26.519> think<00:03:26.850> I<00:03:26.910> tried<00:03:27.209> each<00:03:27.390> of<00:03:27.570> them<00:03:27.690> out<00:03:27.840> for

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 
but I think I tried each of them out for

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:29.900 
but I think I tried each of them out for
a<00:03:28.110> couple<00:03:28.320> games<00:03:28.620> and<00:03:28.920> just<00:03:29.250> decided<00:03:29.610> like

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
a couple games and just decided like

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.310

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.320 
really early on that they were all

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.050 
really early on that they were all
terrible<00:03:31.890> someone<00:03:32.250> just<00:03:32.400> you<00:03:32.610> know<00:03:32.700> tweeted

thought of it for a little bit little
bit<00:03:37.800> and<00:03:38.130> in<00:03:38.250> all<00:03:38.459> the<00:03:38.730> other<00:03:38.760> games<00:03:39.120> literally

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
bit and in all the other games literally

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.570 
bit and in all the other games literally
all<00:03:39.870> the<00:03:40.050> other<00:03:40.200> call<00:03:40.410> duty<00:03:40.590> games<00:03:40.890> there<00:03:41.370> was

all the other call duty games there was

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:44.900 
all the other call duty games there was
a<00:03:42.080> time<00:03:43.080> like<00:03:43.470> a<00:03:43.500> certain<00:03:44.280> position<00:03:44.549> where

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
a time like a certain position where

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:47.090 
a time like a certain position where
liking<00:03:45.180> the<00:03:45.269> LMGs<00:03:45.720> seem<00:03:46.080> to<00:03:46.230> be<00:03:46.380> the<00:03:46.860> better

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
liking the LMGs seem to be the better

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:48.650 
liking the LMGs seem to be the better
weapon<00:03:47.549> to<00:03:47.670> use<00:03:47.700> where<00:03:48.209> they<00:03:48.299> were<00:03:48.360> useful

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
weapon to use where they were useful

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.479 
weapon to use where they were useful
when<00:03:49.560> they<00:03:49.680> you<00:03:49.860> know<00:03:49.890> how<00:03:50.070> to<00:03:50.130> certain

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
when they you know how to certain

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:52.220 
when they you know how to certain
specific<00:03:51.000> role<00:03:51.239> that<00:03:51.540> made<00:03:51.720> you<00:03:51.870> want<00:03:51.900> to<00:03:52.110> use

the<00:04:45.070> best<00:04:45.220> one<00:04:45.460> but<00:04:45.670> it's<00:04:45.880> just<00:04:45.940> not<00:04:46.210> there<00:04:46.420> for

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:46.690 
the best one but it's just not there for

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:48.750
