and then the whole device comes off and
we<00:01:52.049> are<00:01:52.170> done<00:01:52.320> I<00:01:52.619> think<00:01:52.950> it's<00:01:53.100> clear<00:01:53.490> that<00:01:53.790> this

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
we are done I think it's clear that this

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.090 
we are done I think it's clear that this
is<00:01:54.299> far<00:01:54.720> superior<00:01:54.930> than<00:01:55.320> the<00:01:55.619> old<00:01:55.770> way<00:01:56.040> to
