00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.300
 segmented 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:02.810

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:33.350
 partnership with bloggers this year 

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:37.429

 hair but forget to take a rest 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:28.510
 You have to give it a shot at everything.

 It happens, I even thought my hair is 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:40.240
 extremely smooth 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:42.160
 after I did this moisturizing did not

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.700

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:26.520
 The moisturizer has strong to maintain color 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:27.940
 of the laurels ' copper to 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:31.630

 to be blond for every day and today 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.540
 very interesting to redhead in my case 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:59.050
 I also did not know said he thought only 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:02.010

 the cold people do not want to repeat that 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:32.790
 boring thing and table is thus not 

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:34.860
 stay looking for the points because of the 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:40.710

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:42.810
 and now he has a kit for the very 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:44.730
 interesting that is what coexists with 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:52.620
 candy poetry composed of four 

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:54.360
 a hygienizing anti-AIDS product that 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:57.510
 It's a renovator, right? 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:05:02.220
 in January of the mobile phone an outline of the 

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:05.970
 eyes are important and a first people 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:07.740
 look how fantastic here each of 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:11.490
 You, but I'm going to start with the plague that 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:14.400
 that the most interesting is how to look for 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:17.370
 makeup and you want her to 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:19.410
 Wonderful make-up of ipor hours 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:22.169
 I was going to perspire to show pores 

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:26.250
 dilated and show lines and 

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:27.900
 without accumulating basic roll is has on 

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:31.320
 expression lines 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:33.000
 what you do uses the first 

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:36.570
 this first one here we are as if 

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.900
 It was the purest it's incredible to spend 

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:43.290
 it looks like same wall dough 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:44.430
 passes through the skin and even comes with touch 

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:46.980
 velvety 

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:47.760
 It's wonderful to wait to dry one. 

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:51.000
 a little 

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:54.210
 one minute and do the normal one for 

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:56.480
 up wearing makeup lasts for at least 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:59.400
 six hours 

00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:02.580
 wonderful here for those who have enough 

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:04.650
 in the expression that is fantastic makes a 

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:08.750
 time transformation 

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:10.919
 the jenison dye lotion who observes of 

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:12.750
 I was a make-up artist too. 

00:06:10.919 --> 00:06:14.689
 impressed with this here because in the 

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:17.869
 Truth It Is A Lotion To Make 

00:06:14.689 --> 00:06:22.789
 against the anti shake pink analyzer based on 

00:06:17.869 --> 00:06:24.799
 herbs and macedo aquilante her spirit 

00:06:22.789 --> 00:06:26.989
 cotton the first time I used it 

00:06:24.799 --> 00:06:28.099
 and I spent my kilos of makeup 

00:06:26.989 --> 00:06:31.939
 In the eye 

00:06:28.099 --> 00:06:34.629
 I passed by at once it was all gone 

00:06:31.939 --> 00:06:37.669
 deeply cleanses the skin without believing 

00:06:34.629 --> 00:06:39.499
 and small detail people and if nobody me 

00:06:37.669 --> 00:06:43.639
 said but I realized I found it a lot 

00:06:39.499 --> 00:06:45.439
 cool this smells like herbs because 

00:06:43.639 --> 00:06:46.909
 usually from marylande it smells of 

00:06:45.439 --> 00:06:49.219
 old product 

00:06:46.909 --> 00:06:51.050
 I think it smells like makeup 

00:06:49.219 --> 00:06:52.759
 old yes of old product 

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:55.329
 this gym that smells like herbs is 

00:06:52.759 --> 00:06:55.329
 very good 

00:06:55.429 --> 00:06:59.599
 the full gynecological goal for that 

00:06:58.249 --> 00:07:02.179
 Makeup for those who do not wear makeup 

00:06:59.599 --> 00:07:04.429
 have to use a cellular regenerator 

00:07:02.179 --> 00:07:06.169
 because the skin unfortunately goes 

00:07:04.429 --> 00:07:08.509
 aging time goes on to 

00:07:06.169 --> 00:07:10.449
 the whole world then you have to have 

00:07:08.509 --> 00:07:15.079
 Night care, right? 

00:07:10.449 --> 00:07:18.559
 complicated and cool that is milk 

00:07:15.079 --> 00:07:21.079
 contour of the eyes that happens where the 

00:07:18.559 --> 00:07:23.599
 People wear eye makeup. 

00:07:21.079 --> 00:07:25.489
 even if it is only a lapse the river is the 

00:07:23.599 --> 00:07:28.849
 eye area that is attacked right 

00:07:25.489 --> 00:07:32.479
 so you have to have an eye contour 

00:07:28.849 --> 00:07:35.239
 in but I can not use the old one on 

00:07:32.479 --> 00:07:38.149
 eye area to protect and can not 

00:07:35.239 --> 00:07:41.059
 because because time of the eyes and the mouth is 

00:07:38.149 --> 00:07:42.739
 mucosa is a different type of skin that 

00:07:41.059 --> 00:07:45.110
 absorbs a different type of product 

00:07:42.739 --> 00:07:48.469
 then usually the mucous products 

00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:52.099
 which is the mouth of the mouth around the 

00:07:48.469 --> 00:07:55.729
 eyes is uncertain what a product had 

00:07:52.099 --> 00:07:59.829
 finally have high absorption and the face 

00:07:55.729 --> 00:08:03.050
 as in the mucosa it absorbs a little more 

00:07:59.829 --> 00:08:05.629
 is not as sensitive as the 

00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:06.619
 mucous membranes can be a normal product 

00:08:05.629 --> 00:08:08.899
 slightly dense 

00:08:06.619 --> 00:08:12.679
 I hope you have enjoyed seeing the 

00:08:08.899 --> 00:08:15.529
 favorite video gives a young and if you like and 

00:08:12.679 --> 00:08:18.129
 sign in to the channel a kiss and until the 

00:08:15.529 --> 00:08:18.129
 next video
