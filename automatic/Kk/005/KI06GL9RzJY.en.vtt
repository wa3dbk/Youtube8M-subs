00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
my nerdy air guitar mousse but we're

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.830 
my nerdy air guitar mousse but we're
moving<00:00:20.189> into<00:00:20.520> another<00:00:20.640> room<00:00:21.060> here<00:00:21.390> and<00:00:21.630> this

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
moving into another room here and this

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.870 
moving into another room here and this
is<00:00:21.960> a<00:00:21.990> very<00:00:22.289> special<00:00:22.769> place<00:00:22.920> this<00:00:23.340> is<00:00:23.519> a<00:00:23.550> place

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
is a very special place this is a place

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.150 
is a very special place this is a place
where<00:00:24.660> some<00:00:25.199> metal<00:00:25.439> strings<00:00:25.769> get<00:00:26.010> together

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
where some metal strings get together

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.670 
where some metal strings get together
with<00:00:26.670> a<00:00:26.699> couple<00:00:27.480> of<00:00:27.570> magnets<00:00:28.019> and<00:00:28.349> together

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
with a couple of magnets and together

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.670 
with a couple of magnets and together
what<00:00:29.099> they<00:00:29.220> produce<00:00:29.429> is<00:00:30.230> pretty<00:00:31.230> electrifying

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:33.680 
what they produce is pretty electrifying

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.860 
what they produce is pretty electrifying
so<00:00:34.680> how<00:00:35.010> does<00:00:35.070> all<00:00:35.579> this<00:00:35.640> become<00:00:36.210> electric

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
so how does all this become electric

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.530 
so how does all this become electric
well<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.800> answer<00:00:38.219> begins<00:00:38.399> with<00:00:38.850> magnets

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
well the answer begins with magnets

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.680 
well the answer begins with magnets
inside<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.230> body<00:00:40.440> of<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:40.710> guitar<00:00:41.450> this<00:00:42.450> has

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
inside the body of the guitar this has

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:43.970 
inside the body of the guitar this has
always<00:00:43.020> stumped<00:00:43.710> me

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
always stumped me

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:50.990 
pickup how does it work exactly
you<00:00:49.890> really<00:00:50.129> are<00:00:50.219> generating<00:00:50.700> electricity

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
you really are generating electricity

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.090 
you really are generating electricity
with<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:51.449> vibration<00:00:51.960> of<00:00:52.110> string<00:00:52.410> and<00:00:52.860> it's

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
with the vibration of string and it's

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.420 
with the vibration of string and it's
done<00:00:53.309> magnetically<00:00:54.710> inside<00:00:55.710> every<00:00:56.010> pickup

so<00:01:29.700> our<00:01:29.850> les<00:01:30.150> ball<00:01:30.480> is<00:01:30.810> nearing<00:01:31.410> its<00:01:31.680> final

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:32.160 
so our les ball is nearing its final

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.760 
so our les ball is nearing its final
destination<00:01:32.940> and<00:01:33.810> it's<00:01:34.020> just<00:01:34.230> about<00:01:34.350> to<00:01:34.620> make

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
destination and it's just about to make

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.410 
destination and it's just about to make
beautiful<00:01:34.920> music<00:01:35.160> right<00:01:35.610> Kirby<00:01:35.820> that's<00:01:36.150> right

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420

beautiful music right Kirby that's right
now<00:01:36.660> and<00:01:36.780> they<00:01:36.840> call<00:01:37.050> you<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.290> stringer<00:01:37.710> now

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
now and they call you the stringer now

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.740 
now and they call you the stringer now
wonder<00:01:38.430> what<00:01:38.580> you<00:01:38.730> do<00:01:38.910> here<00:01:39.150> Kearney<00:01:39.450> beats

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
wonder what you do here Kearney beats

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.600 
wonder what you do here Kearney beats
well<00:01:41.270> this<00:01:42.270> is<00:01:42.770> this<00:01:43.770> is<00:01:44.010> the<00:01:44.070> tailpiece

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
well this is this is the tailpiece

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.870 
well this is this is the tailpiece
alright<00:01:45.120> and<00:01:46.100> you<00:01:47.100> basically<00:01:47.310> just<00:01:47.520> in

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
alright and you basically just in

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.850 
alright and you basically just in
advance<00:01:48.210> feed<00:01:48.870> these<00:01:49.050> frames<00:01:49.410> through<00:01:49.680> there

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
advance feed these frames through there

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.350 
advance feed these frames through there
so<00:01:50.040> you<00:01:50.100> can<00:01:50.280> just<00:01:50.460> in<00:01:50.550> this<00:01:50.640> assembly<00:01:50.970> just

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
so you can just in this assembly just

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.730 
so you can just in this assembly just
pop<00:01:51.570> it<00:01:51.750> on<00:01:51.840> there<00:01:52.110> and<00:01:52.200> give<00:01:52.350> it<00:01:52.470> on<00:01:52.530> down<00:01:52.650> the

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
pop it on there and give it on down the

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.860 
pop it on there and give it on down the
line<00:01:52.920> exactly<00:01:53.400> just<00:01:54.030> tightening<00:01:54.450> them<00:01:54.630> up<00:01:54.780> a

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:54.870 
line exactly just tightening them up a

00:01:54.870 --> 00:02:00.859 
line exactly just tightening them up a
little<00:01:55.050> bit<00:01:56.210> well<00:01:57.210> ah<00:01:59.450> now<00:02:00.450> there<00:02:00.600> are<00:02:00.660> three

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
little bit well ah now there are three

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.210 
little bit well ah now there are three
things<00:02:01.080> that<00:02:01.229> determine<00:02:01.770> the<00:02:01.860> pitch<00:02:02.040> for

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:02.220 
things that determine the pitch for

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.480 
things that determine the pitch for
guitar<00:02:02.520> string<00:02:02.820> the<00:02:03.240> first<00:02:03.479> is<00:02:03.840> its<00:02:04.080> inertia

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
guitar string the first is its inertia

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.400 
guitar string the first is its inertia
the<00:02:05.490> more<00:02:05.729> inertia<00:02:06.030> of<00:02:06.210> the<00:02:06.300> string<00:02:06.570> has<00:02:06.810> the

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:07.410 
the more inertia of the string has the

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:11.500 
the more inertia of the string has the
slower<00:02:07.800> it<00:02:07.950> vibrates<00:02:08.550> the<00:02:09.030> lower<00:02:09.060> the<00:02:09.420> pitch

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
slower it vibrates the lower the pitch

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.650 
slower it vibrates the lower the pitch
second<00:02:12.510> pitch<00:02:13.320> is<00:02:13.770> tension<00:02:14.400> as<00:02:14.910> you<00:02:15.000> turn<00:02:15.450> the

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
second pitch is tension as you turn the

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:21.490 
second pitch is tension as you turn the
key<00:02:15.900> here<00:02:16.350> and<00:02:16.550> tighten<00:02:17.550> the<00:02:17.640> string<00:02:17.940> up

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
finally there's the length of the string

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.630 
finally there's the length of the string

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
shortening the string so it vibrates
