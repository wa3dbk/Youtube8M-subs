00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
so for the protein I've got some frozen

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.880 
so for the protein I've got some frozen
salmon<00:01:23.100> got<00:01:23.909> some<00:01:24.150> tins<00:01:24.450> of<00:01:24.600> beans<00:01:24.840> got<00:01:25.650> eggs

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
protein sources you've got the salmon

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.530 
protein sources you've got the salmon
which<00:01:32.009> can<00:01:32.220> be<00:01:32.340> frozen<00:01:32.729> this<00:01:33.060> is<00:01:33.210> already

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
which can be frozen this is already

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.539 
which can be frozen this is already
frozen<00:01:33.990> so<00:01:34.680> I'll<00:01:34.740> just<00:01:34.799> leave<00:01:35.100> that<00:01:35.310> in<00:01:35.460> the

freezer and then any time that I run out

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.109 
freezer and then any time that I run out
of<00:01:37.439> protein<00:01:37.979> or<00:01:38.130> I<00:01:38.189> need<00:01:38.250> a<00:01:38.400> high-protein<00:01:38.880> meal

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
of protein or I need a high-protein meal

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.780 
of protein or I need a high-protein meal
I'll<00:01:39.750> just<00:01:40.140> stick<00:01:40.380> to<00:01:40.650> these<00:01:40.860> on<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.250> pan<00:01:41.490> with

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
I'll just stick to these on the pan with
