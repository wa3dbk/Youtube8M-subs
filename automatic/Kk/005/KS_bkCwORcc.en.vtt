here we have our input list we have our
pattern<00:00:37.210> which<00:00:37.720> we're<00:00:37.960> going<00:00:38.110> to<00:00:38.199> work<00:00:38.320> from

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:38.830 
pattern which we're going to work from

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:42.479 
pattern which we're going to work from
we<00:00:39.309> have<00:00:39.580> scissors<00:00:40.360> we<00:00:40.629> have<00:00:40.750> a<00:00:40.780> bag<00:00:41.170> and<00:00:41.830> we

we have scissors we have a bag and we

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:46.320 
we have scissors we have a bag and we
have<00:00:42.699> our<00:00:43.860> knob<00:00:44.860> which<00:00:45.460> we<00:00:45.640> use<00:00:45.820> as<00:00:46.000> a<00:00:46.030> size

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:46.330 
have our knob which we use as a size

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:48.149 
have our knob which we use as a size
reference<00:00:46.570> and<00:00:47.199> we're<00:00:47.440> gonna<00:00:47.530> work<00:00:47.710> on<00:00:47.949> making

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:48.159 
reference and we're gonna work on making

00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:51.750 
reference and we're gonna work on making
the<00:00:48.430> boot<00:00:48.989> pattern<00:00:49.989> out<00:00:50.620> of<00:00:50.830> this<00:00:51.010> plastic<00:00:51.339> bag

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:51.760 
the boot pattern out of this plastic bag

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.000 
the boot pattern out of this plastic bag
so<00:00:52.180> we'll<00:00:52.269> go<00:00:52.420> over<00:00:52.540> how<00:00:52.870> to<00:00:52.900> actually<00:00:53.170> do<00:00:53.650> that

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.010 
so we'll go over how to actually do that

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.820 
so we'll go over how to actually do that
here<00:00:54.820> I'm<00:00:54.970> using<00:00:55.000> a<00:00:55.449> plastic<00:00:55.690> bag<00:00:56.140> from<00:00:56.500> a

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:56.830 
here I'm using a plastic bag from a

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:59.729 
here I'm using a plastic bag from a
normal<00:00:57.250> retail<00:00:57.489> store<00:00:58.120> in<00:00:58.449> order<00:00:58.750> to<00:00:59.019> use<00:00:59.530> the

00:00:59.729 --> 00:00:59.739 
normal retail store in order to use the

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:04.469 
normal retail store in order to use the
foundation<00:01:01.199> for<00:01:02.199> building<00:01:02.799> my<00:01:03.370> pattern<00:01:03.790> so<00:01:04.449> I

00:01:04.469 --> 00:01:04.479 
foundation for building my pattern so I

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:07.530

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:07.540 
kind of parked the bag and start to lay

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:12.080 
kind of parked the bag and start to lay
out<00:01:07.750> and<00:01:08.670> take<00:01:09.670> one<00:01:10.270> of<00:01:10.390> these<00:01:10.570> sections<00:01:10.960> to

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
out and take one of these sections to

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.670 
out and take one of these sections to
the<00:01:13.090> pattern<00:01:13.540> that<00:01:13.930> I'm<00:01:14.110> going<00:01:14.259> to<00:01:14.320> be<00:01:14.469> using

for making this handbrake boot I tape

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.920 
for making this handbrake boot I tape
one<00:01:19.899> side<00:01:20.200> down<00:01:20.560> and<00:01:20.890> then<00:01:21.450> start<00:01:22.450> flipping

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:22.930 
one side down and then start flipping

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:24.779 
one side down and then start flipping
over<00:01:23.079> the<00:01:23.259> piece<00:01:23.500> in<00:01:23.740> my<00:01:23.770> hand<00:01:23.890> while<00:01:24.399> trying

across both the top and the bottom of
the<00:01:30.490> piece<00:01:30.789> that<00:01:31.090> I'm<00:01:31.390> designing<00:01:31.600> a<00:01:32.140> pattern

00:01:32.639 --> 00:01:32.649 
the piece that I'm designing a pattern

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:38.450 
the piece that I'm designing a pattern
based<00:01:33.159> on

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.719 

once<00:01:39.460> traced<00:01:40.090> I<00:01:40.450> cut<00:01:41.200> a<00:01:41.380> little<00:01:41.439> bit<00:01:41.770> past<00:01:42.430> the

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:42.729 
once traced I cut a little bit past the

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:44.999 
once traced I cut a little bit past the
pattern<00:01:43.180> to<00:01:43.479> give<00:01:43.659> me<00:01:43.780> enough<00:01:44.020> room<00:01:44.200> to<00:01:44.799> fold

00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:45.009 
pattern to give me enough room to fold

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:47.219 
pattern to give me enough room to fold
over<00:01:45.340> the<00:01:45.460> material<00:01:46.030> and<00:01:46.240> do<00:01:46.750> the<00:01:46.930> kind<00:01:47.140> of

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:47.229 
over the material and do the kind of

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:49.380 
over the material and do the kind of
double<00:01:47.560> stitch<00:01:47.830> to<00:01:48.130> get<00:01:48.310> the<00:01:48.490> look<00:01:48.759> that<00:01:49.030> I

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390 
double stitch to get the look that I

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.300 
double stitch to get the look that I
want<00:01:49.509> to<00:01:49.930> in<00:01:50.200> the<00:01:50.500> end<00:01:50.650> piece

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 
want to in the end piece

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.740 
want to in the end piece
so<00:01:52.030> after<00:01:52.299> untape<00:01:52.810> ness<00:01:53.229> I<00:01:53.940> trace<00:01:54.940> out<00:01:55.180> around

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:55.750 
so after untape ness I trace out around

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.830 
so after untape ness I trace out around
the<00:01:55.990> pattern<00:01:56.380> with<00:01:56.619> the<00:01:56.649> scissors<00:01:57.190> and<00:01:57.840> repeat

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 
the pattern with the scissors and repeat

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.230 
the pattern with the scissors and repeat
the<00:01:58.990> process<00:01:59.289> for<00:01:59.590> the<00:01:59.920> other<00:02:00.100> side<00:02:00.490> after

the sewing machine I have is not

anywhere near a heavy-duty kind of

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:02.109 
sewing machine that I would need in

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:04.610 
sewing machine that I would need in
order<00:03:02.200> to<00:03:02.380> be<00:03:02.590> able<00:03:02.680> to<00:03:02.859> sew<00:03:03.130> leather<00:03:03.910> boots

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
order to be able to sew leather boots

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.530 
order to be able to sew leather boots
effectively<00:03:05.620> this<00:03:06.280> leather<00:03:06.549> is<00:03:06.760> just<00:03:06.790> even

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
effectively this leather is just even

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.509 
effectively this leather is just even
though<00:03:07.630> it's<00:03:07.780> a<00:03:07.870> nice<00:03:08.049> soft<00:03:08.350> leather<00:03:08.590> it's

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:09.519 
though it's a nice soft leather it's

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:12.870 
though it's a nice soft leather it's
just<00:03:10.150> too<00:03:10.480> tough<00:03:10.930> and<00:03:11.320> too<00:03:11.530> thick<00:03:11.980> a<00:03:12.250> material

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:12.880 
just too tough and too thick a material

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:15.180 
just too tough and too thick a material
for<00:03:13.209> a<00:03:13.239> little<00:03:13.510> sewing<00:03:13.720> machine<00:03:14.170> to<00:03:14.560> work<00:03:14.920> with

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:15.190 
for a little sewing machine to work with

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:18.240 
for a little sewing machine to work with
so<00:03:15.970> it's<00:03:16.540> not<00:03:16.750> that<00:03:16.810> bad<00:03:17.200> to<00:03:17.530> do<00:03:17.680> the<00:03:17.799> work<00:03:17.980> by

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
so it's not that bad to do the work by

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.729 
so it's not that bad to do the work by
hand<00:03:18.640> it<00:03:19.239> just<00:03:19.299> takes<00:03:19.810> a<00:03:19.930> lot<00:03:20.049> of<00:03:20.109> time<00:03:20.440> and<00:03:20.650> you

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:20.739 
hand it just takes a lot of time and you

00:03:20.739 --> 00:04:32.650 
hand it just takes a lot of time and you
have<00:03:20.829> to<00:03:20.950> be<00:03:21.070> careful

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:32.660 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:38.870 

you

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.120 

here<00:04:39.450> you<00:04:39.630> can<00:04:39.810> see<00:04:40.080> it<00:04:40.290> to<00:04:40.530> get<00:04:40.680> the<00:04:40.860> double

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:51.140 
results and this was far less expensive
than<00:06:50.280> me<00:06:50.550> I<00:06:50.580> think
