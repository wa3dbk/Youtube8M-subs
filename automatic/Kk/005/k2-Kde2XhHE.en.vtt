priced<00:01:18.450> this<00:01:18.600> palette<00:01:19.020> at<00:01:19.140> around<00:01:19.380> forty

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
priced this palette at around forty

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.679 
priced this palette at around forty
dollars<00:01:19.979> because<00:01:20.220> your<00:01:20.490> competitor's<00:01:21.060> price

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
dollars because your competitor's price

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.780 
dollars because your competitor's price
there<00:01:21.990> pellets<00:01:22.409> at<00:01:22.560> forty<00:01:22.920> dollars<00:01:23.220> so<00:01:23.460> this

there pellets at forty dollars so this

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.640 
there pellets at forty dollars so this
makes<00:01:24.030> it<00:01:24.210> just<00:01:24.479> as<00:01:24.630> desirable<00:01:25.110> if<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.409> box

I felt like for me I can definitely get

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:11.219 
I felt like for me I can definitely get
away<00:05:08.830> with<00:05:09.009> contouring<00:05:09.610> with<00:05:09.940> shadow<00:05:10.690> play<00:05:10.990> if

00:05:11.219 --> 00:05:11.229 
away with contouring with shadow play if

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:13.710 
away with contouring with shadow play if
I<00:05:11.440> wanted<00:05:11.740> just<00:05:11.949> a<00:05:12.070> very<00:05:12.250> light<00:05:13.030> wash<00:05:13.360> of

I wanted just a very light wash of
contour<00:05:14.349> but<00:05:15.039> it<00:05:15.280> serves<00:05:15.639> best<00:05:16.090> for<00:05:16.389> me<00:05:16.509> as<00:05:16.690> a

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:16.720 
contour but it serves best for me as a

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:19.050 
contour but it serves best for me as a
bronzing<00:05:17.500> powder<00:05:17.740> and<00:05:18.130> you<00:05:18.639> guys<00:05:18.820> already

hadn't hadn't worked great and then I
pick<00:05:26.289> up<00:05:26.409> subconscious<00:05:27.130> and<00:05:27.159> I<00:05:27.310> use<00:05:27.520> that<00:05:27.550> to

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:27.970 
pick up subconscious and I use that to

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:29.700 
pick up subconscious and I use that to
contour<00:05:28.509> my<00:05:28.539> face<00:05:28.690> and<00:05:29.139> again<00:05:29.409> as<00:05:29.560> I<00:05:29.680> mentioned

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:32.560 
you just need very little of this so

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:35.430 
you just need very little of this so
don't<00:05:33.400> feel<00:05:33.580> like<00:05:33.930> subconscious<00:05:34.930> is<00:05:35.080> too

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:35.440 
don't feel like subconscious is too

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:37.350 
don't feel like subconscious is too
intimidating<00:05:36.340> or<00:05:36.460> would<00:05:36.699> be<00:05:36.820> too<00:05:37.000> harsh<00:05:37.300> for

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:37.360 
intimidating or would be too harsh for

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:40.409 
intimidating or would be too harsh for
your<00:05:37.599> skin<00:05:37.960> although<00:05:38.680> it<00:05:38.860> can<00:05:39.159> be<00:05:39.430> as<00:05:39.699> long<00:05:40.210> as

you use it very very lightly on your

you use it very very lightly on your
face<00:05:43.509> you<00:05:43.930> can<00:05:44.080> actually<00:05:44.229> get<00:05:44.590> away<00:05:44.860> with<00:05:45.039> it<00:05:45.190> I

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:45.220 
face you can actually get away with it I

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:48.300 
face you can actually get away with it I
actually<00:05:45.460> used<00:05:46.060> the<00:05:46.930> RO<00:05:47.500> Techniques<00:05:48.130> contour

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:48.310 
actually used the RO Techniques contour

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:51.060 
actually used the RO Techniques contour
brush<00:05:49.150> with<00:05:49.389> that<00:05:49.570> or<00:05:49.840> that<00:05:49.960> the<00:05:50.110> brush<00:05:50.380> that

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:51.070 
brush with that or that the brush that

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:53.249 
brush with that or that the brush that
come<00:05:51.280> on<00:05:51.490> D<00:05:51.639> brought<00:05:52.270> out<00:05:52.419> with<00:05:52.630> this<00:05:52.810> palette

00:05:53.249 --> 00:05:53.259 
come on D brought out with this palette

00:05:53.259 --> 00:05:55.409 
come on D brought out with this palette
is<00:05:53.409> really<00:05:54.310> kind<00:05:54.580> of<00:05:54.699> a<00:05:54.789> waste<00:05:54.969> of<00:05:55.210> money

00:05:55.409 --> 00:05:55.419 
is really kind of a waste of money

00:05:55.419 --> 00:05:57.300 
is really kind of a waste of money
because<00:05:55.990> you<00:05:56.500> can<00:05:56.710> find<00:05:56.949> a<00:05:57.009> cheaper

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:57.310 
because you can find a cheaper

00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:58.830 
because you can find a cheaper
alternative<00:05:57.370> and<00:05:58.000> it's<00:05:58.120> exactly<00:05:58.270> the<00:05:58.630> same

00:05:58.830 --> 00:05:58.840 
alternative and it's exactly the same

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:00.240 
alternative and it's exactly the same
then<00:05:59.080> I<00:05:59.139> took<00:05:59.199> sombra<00:05:59.740> and<00:05:59.919> use<00:06:00.070> that<00:06:00.099> to

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:00.250 
then I took sombra and use that to

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:03.330 
then I took sombra and use that to
contour<00:06:00.909> my<00:06:00.940> nose<00:06:01.300> because<00:06:02.229> I<00:06:02.500> feel<00:06:02.710> like<00:06:02.740> cool

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:03.340 
contour my nose because I feel like cool

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:06.149 
contour my nose because I feel like cool
tone<00:06:03.729> contours<00:06:04.479> just<00:06:04.780> work<00:06:04.960> best<00:06:05.289> for<00:06:06.039> the

00:06:06.149 --> 00:06:06.159 
tone contours just work best for the

00:06:06.159 --> 00:06:07.830 
tone contours just work best for the
center<00:06:06.400> of<00:06:06.430> my<00:06:06.580> face<00:06:06.789> and<00:06:07.030> on<00:06:07.120> my<00:06:07.150> nose<00:06:07.479> I<00:06:07.690> don't

center of my face and on my nose I don't
know<00:06:07.900> and<00:06:08.169> then<00:06:08.259> of<00:06:08.380> course<00:06:08.409> I<00:06:08.770> took<00:06:08.830> lyric<00:06:09.400> and

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:09.550 
know and then of course I took lyric and

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:34.860 
which to be completely honest at first I
was<00:06:33.729> like<00:06:33.789> what<00:06:34.150> am<00:06:34.270> I<00:06:34.330> gonna<00:06:34.479> do<00:06:34.719> with<00:06:34.839> this

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:34.870 
was like what am I gonna do with this

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:36.600 
was like what am I gonna do with this
peachy<00:06:35.439> highlight<00:06:35.800> like<00:06:35.949> it's<00:06:36.099> just<00:06:36.249> gonna<00:06:36.370> go

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:36.610 
peachy highlight like it's just gonna go

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:38.579 
peachy highlight like it's just gonna go
to<00:06:36.639> waste<00:06:36.879> and<00:06:37.210> then<00:06:37.689> I<00:06:37.719> watched<00:06:38.050> my<00:06:38.349> good

00:06:38.579 --> 00:06:38.589 
to waste and then I watched my good

00:06:38.589 --> 00:06:40.529 
to waste and then I watched my good
friend<00:06:38.919> what<00:06:39.219> would<00:06:39.339> Lizzie<00:06:39.520> do<00:06:39.819> Lizzie<00:06:40.360> was

00:06:40.529 --> 00:06:40.539 
friend what would Lizzie do Lizzie was

00:06:40.539 --> 00:06:42.390 
friend what would Lizzie do Lizzie was
the<00:06:40.719> good<00:06:40.960> and<00:06:41.199> in<00:06:41.409> her<00:06:41.589> review<00:06:41.800> I<00:06:42.039> think<00:06:42.339> it

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:42.400 
the good and in her review I think it

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:44.040 
the good and in her review I think it
was<00:06:42.490> a<00:06:42.520> review<00:06:42.819> or<00:06:42.879> a<00:06:43.029> halt<00:06:43.330> she<00:06:43.629> used<00:06:43.809> every

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:44.050 
was a review or a halt she used every

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:46.110 
was a review or a halt she used every
single<00:06:44.379> shade<00:06:44.650> in<00:06:44.889> this<00:06:45.009> palette<00:06:45.370> as<00:06:45.460> well<00:06:45.699> she

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:46.120 
single shade in this palette as well she

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:48.269 
single shade in this palette as well she
showed<00:06:46.330> that<00:06:46.389> she<00:06:46.689> used<00:06:47.110> levitation<00:06:47.919> to

00:06:48.269 --> 00:06:48.279 
showed that she used levitation to

00:06:48.279 --> 00:06:50.730 
showed that she used levitation to
reverse<00:06:48.729> contour<00:06:49.389> her<00:06:49.569> face<00:06:49.810> so<00:06:50.139> that's

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:50.740 
reverse contour her face so that's

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:52.290 
reverse contour her face so that's
exactly<00:06:50.949> what<00:06:51.460> I<00:06:51.490> did<00:06:51.789> and<00:06:51.999> reverse

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:52.300 
exactly what I did and reverse

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:54.239 
exactly what I did and reverse
contouring<00:06:52.900> is<00:06:53.169> pretty<00:06:53.469> much<00:06:53.589> highlighting

00:06:54.239 --> 00:06:54.249 
contouring is pretty much highlighting

00:06:54.249 --> 00:06:56.219 
contouring is pretty much highlighting
your<00:06:54.279> contour<00:06:54.909> so<00:06:55.270> if<00:06:55.629> that<00:06:55.810> kind<00:06:55.960> of<00:06:56.050> makes

00:06:56.219 --> 00:06:56.229 
your contour so if that kind of makes

00:06:56.229 --> 00:06:58.679 
your contour so if that kind of makes
sense<00:06:56.439> so<00:06:56.979> after<00:06:57.219> I<00:06:57.279> did<00:06:57.490> my<00:06:57.520> contour<00:06:58.240> I<00:06:58.479> took

00:06:58.679 --> 00:06:58.689 
sense so after I did my contour I took

00:06:58.689 --> 00:07:01.110 
sense so after I did my contour I took
levitation<00:06:59.620> and<00:06:59.740> I<00:06:59.860> highlighted<00:07:00.370> right<00:07:00.759> under

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:01.120 
levitation and I highlighted right under

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:03.420 
levitation and I highlighted right under
that<00:07:01.150> to<00:07:01.870> enhance<00:07:02.680> it<00:07:02.830> a<00:07:02.889> little<00:07:02.919> bit<00:07:03.249> so

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:03.430 
that to enhance it a little bit so

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:04.739 
that to enhance it a little bit so
that's<00:07:03.610> what<00:07:03.729> I<00:07:03.789> did<00:07:03.849> and<00:07:04.029> it<00:07:04.270> worked<00:07:04.389> really

00:07:04.739 --> 00:07:04.749 
that's what I did and it worked really

00:07:04.749 --> 00:07:06.360 
that's what I did and it worked really
really<00:07:04.900> well<00:07:05.169> I<00:07:05.439> thought<00:07:05.889> that<00:07:06.039> it<00:07:06.159> was<00:07:06.249> going

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:06.370 
really well I thought that it was going

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:08.399 
really well I thought that it was going
to<00:07:06.430> be<00:07:06.610> a<00:07:06.639> little<00:07:06.819> again<00:07:07.300> to<00:07:07.539> Ashley<00:07:08.110> for<00:07:08.319> my

00:07:08.399 --> 00:07:08.409 
to be a little again to Ashley for my

00:07:08.409 --> 00:07:11.189 
to be a little again to Ashley for my
skin<00:07:08.710> tone<00:07:08.999> but<00:07:09.999> it<00:07:10.120> works<00:07:10.270> really<00:07:10.419> nice<00:07:10.689> so<00:07:10.960> if

00:07:11.189 --> 00:07:11.199 
skin tone but it works really nice so if

00:07:11.199 --> 00:07:13.769 
skin tone but it works really nice so if
you<00:07:11.319> are<00:07:11.409> medium<00:07:11.680> to<00:07:12.129> tan<00:07:12.430> skin<00:07:12.819> you<00:07:13.419> can<00:07:13.629> use

00:07:13.769 --> 00:07:13.779 
you are medium to tan skin you can use

00:07:13.779 --> 00:07:15.749 
you are medium to tan skin you can use
limitation<00:07:14.439> to<00:07:14.559> reverse<00:07:14.860> contours<00:07:15.460> that<00:07:15.520> is

00:07:15.749 --> 00:07:15.759 
limitation to reverse contours that is

00:07:15.759 --> 00:07:17.369 
limitation to reverse contours that is
basically<00:07:16.240> everything<00:07:16.689> I<00:07:16.779> have<00:07:16.960> to<00:07:16.990> tell<00:07:17.259> you
