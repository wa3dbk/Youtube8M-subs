scoreboard here you're going to need
several<00:00:41.040> strips<00:00:41.610> of<00:00:41.850> paper<00:00:42.140> now<00:00:43.140> since<00:00:43.440> this

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
several strips of paper now since this

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.490 
several strips of paper now since this
opening<00:00:44.399> is<00:00:44.520> less<00:00:45.030> than<00:00:45.239> four<00:00:45.510> inches<00:00:45.539> wide<00:00:46.140> I

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
opening is less than four inches wide I

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.950 
opening is less than four inches wide I
know<00:00:46.890> that<00:00:47.610> each<00:00:47.879> of<00:00:48.090> these<00:00:48.210> piece<00:00:48.539> of<00:00:48.719> paper

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
know that each of these piece of paper

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.880 
know that each of these piece of paper
they<00:00:49.950> need<00:00:50.190> to<00:00:50.520> be<00:00:51.230> less<00:00:52.230> than<00:00:52.260> four<00:00:52.860> inches

they need to be less than four inches
wide<00:00:53.579> doubled<00:00:54.270> so<00:00:54.629> each<00:00:54.960> needs<00:00:55.590> to<00:00:55.860> be<00:00:56.070> too

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
wide doubled so each needs to be too

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.740 
wide doubled so each needs to be too
because<00:00:57.329> I'm<00:00:57.510> going<00:00:57.600> to<00:00:57.660> make<00:00:57.840> a<00:00:57.870> circle<00:00:58.530> so

00:00:59.740 --> 00:00:59.750 
because I'm going to make a circle so

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.660 
because I'm going to make a circle so
it's<00:01:00.750> hard<00:01:01.020> to<00:01:01.109> say<00:01:01.410> exactly<00:01:01.559> how<00:01:02.039> much<00:01:02.370> paper

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
it's hard to say exactly how much paper

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.549 
it's hard to say exactly how much paper
you're<00:01:02.969> going<00:01:03.120> to<00:01:03.180> need<00:01:03.449> let's<00:01:04.110> just<00:01:04.320> start

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
you're going to need let's just start

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.710 
you're going to need let's just start
out<00:01:04.739> with<00:01:04.949> three<00:01:05.280> or<00:01:05.430> so<00:01:05.670> strips<00:01:06.090> and<00:01:06.270> then<00:01:06.330> add

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
out with three or so strips and then add

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.420 
out with three or so strips and then add
on<00:01:06.930> if<00:01:06.960> you<00:01:07.320> need<00:01:08.390> so<00:01:09.390> I<00:01:09.750> have<00:01:10.470> my<00:01:10.920> scoreboard

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
on if you need so I have my scoreboard

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.190 
on if you need so I have my scoreboard
here<00:01:11.939> and<00:01:12.260> for<00:01:13.260> this<00:01:13.710> I<00:01:14.180> typically<00:01:15.200> score

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
here and for this I typically score

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:25.580 
here and for this I typically score
every<00:01:17.210> quarter<00:01:18.210> of<00:01:18.390> an<00:01:18.540> inch<00:01:19.310> so<00:01:22.970> and<00:01:23.970> it<00:01:24.590> goes

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
every quarter of an inch so and it goes

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:31.940 
every quarter of an inch so and it goes
pretty<00:01:25.890> quickly<00:01:26.280> actually<00:01:26.610> so<00:01:30.560> we'll<00:01:31.560> do<00:01:31.740> that

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
pretty quickly actually so we'll do that

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.060 
pretty quickly actually so we'll do that
all<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.250> way<00:01:32.430> across<00:01:32.640> and<00:01:33.619> then<00:01:34.619> when<00:01:34.799> i<00:01:34.829> get

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
all the way across and then when i get

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.039 
all the way across and then when i get
that<00:01:35.220> done<00:01:35.549> i'll<00:01:35.850> have<00:01:36.210> something<00:01:36.689> that<00:01:37.020> looks

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
that done i'll have something that looks

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.359 
that done i'll have something that looks
like<00:01:37.409> this<00:01:37.790> and<00:01:38.790> so<00:01:39.780> you'll<00:01:40.290> just<00:01:40.470> start<00:01:40.829> to

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
put adhesive on each end so that I can

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:30.220 
put adhesive on each end so that I can
marry<00:02:23.900> my<00:02:24.230> strips<00:02:24.680> together<00:02:25.480> so<00:02:28.750> you<00:02:29.750> do<00:02:29.959> that

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
marry my strips together so you do that

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:40.150 
marry my strips together so you do that

for this you're going to need some

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:09.490 
for this you're going to need some
pretty<00:03:06.290> aggressive<00:03:07.300> adhesive<00:03:08.300> so<00:03:09.230> i'm<00:03:09.470> just

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
pretty aggressive adhesive so i'm just

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.470 
pretty aggressive adhesive so i'm just
going<00:03:09.890> to<00:03:09.950> lay<00:03:10.130> down<00:03:10.160> right<00:03:10.760> in<00:03:10.940> the<00:03:11.090> center<00:03:11.450> of

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
going to lay down right in the center of

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:17.020 
going to lay down right in the center of
my<00:03:11.720> card<00:03:14.380> the<00:03:15.380> piece<00:03:15.709> of<00:03:15.920> this<00:03:16.070> red<00:03:16.430> sticky

my card the piece of this red sticky
tape<00:03:17.239> i<00:03:17.860> probably<00:03:18.860> could<00:03:19.310> have<00:03:19.340> put<00:03:19.640> it<00:03:19.760> just<00:03:19.970> a

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
tape i probably could have put it just a

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.570 
tape i probably could have put it just a
little<00:03:20.180> bit<00:03:20.630> higher<00:03:21.140> i'm<00:03:21.980> going<00:03:22.280> to<00:03:22.370> have<00:03:22.550> a

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:14.990 
ribbon that's going to go across the

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:16.540 
ribbon that's going to go across the
bottom<00:04:15.170> on<00:04:15.380> a<00:04:15.410> kind<00:04:15.770> of<00:04:15.920> start<00:04:16.190> at<00:04:16.280> the<00:04:16.370> bottom

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:16.550 
bottom on a kind of start at the bottom

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:28.020 
bottom on a kind of start at the bottom
and<00:04:18.310> eyeball<00:04:19.310> this

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.030 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:52.860 

you

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:52.870 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:56.310 

okay<00:04:53.860> it's<00:04:54.400> a<00:04:54.670> little<00:04:54.850> bit<00:04:55.060> fiddly<00:04:55.870> but<00:04:56.260> i

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:56.320 
okay it's a little bit fiddly but i

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.410 
okay it's a little bit fiddly but i
think<00:04:56.800> that<00:04:56.920> i<00:04:57.070> have<00:04:57.490> it<00:04:57.670> the<00:04:57.790> way<00:04:57.910> I<00:04:57.940> want<00:04:58.300> it

00:04:58.410 --> 00:04:58.420 
think that i have it the way I want it

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:03.690 
think that i have it the way I want it
and<00:04:58.890> so<00:04:59.890> actually<00:05:00.520> when<00:05:00.670> I<00:05:00.730> put<00:05:01.420> my<00:05:02.100> card<00:05:03.100> over

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:03.700 
and so actually when I put my card over

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:07.320 
and so actually when I put my card over
it<00:05:03.880> you<00:05:04.600> can<00:05:04.810> see<00:05:05.110> that<00:05:05.610> i'm<00:05:06.610> going<00:05:06.820> to<00:05:06.880> hit<00:05:07.060> all

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:07.330 
it you can see that i'm going to hit all

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:13.350 
it you can see that i'm going to hit all
the<00:05:07.570> spots<00:05:09.630> and<00:05:11.280> then<00:05:12.280> this<00:05:12.550> is<00:05:12.760> my<00:05:13.030> last

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:13.360 
the spots and then this is my last

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.680 
the spots and then this is my last
element<00:05:13.990> that<00:05:14.530> is<00:05:14.950> going<00:05:15.850> to<00:05:15.910> go<00:05:16.030> in<00:05:16.150> place<00:05:16.360> i

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:16.690 
element that is going to go in place i

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:18.240 
element that is going to go in place i
still<00:05:17.050> have<00:05:17.140> a<00:05:17.230> little<00:05:17.410> bit<00:05:17.530> of<00:05:17.680> adjustment

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:18.250 
still have a little bit of adjustment

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:20.630 
still have a little bit of adjustment
that<00:05:18.580> I<00:05:18.610> need<00:05:18.880> to<00:05:18.910> do<00:05:19.150> but<00:05:19.330> you<00:05:19.480> can<00:05:19.690> see<00:05:19.990> that<00:05:20.020> I

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:20.640 
that I need to do but you can see that I

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:27.840 
that I need to do but you can see that I
that<00:05:21.640> I'm<00:05:21.760> very<00:05:22.180> very<00:05:22.450> close<00:05:23.580> and<00:05:26.490> this<00:05:27.490> is<00:05:27.700> the

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:27.850 
that I'm very very close and this is the

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:31.700 
that I'm very very close and this is the
last<00:05:28.060> layer<00:05:28.450> that's<00:05:28.750> going<00:05:29.020> to<00:05:29.080> go<00:05:29.260> in<00:05:29.290> there

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:31.710 
last layer that's going to go in there

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:38.940 
last layer that's going to go in there
so<00:05:32.710> it's<00:05:32.920> just<00:05:33.070> a<00:05:33.250> matter<00:05:33.280> of<00:05:37.110> adjusting<00:05:38.110> it<00:05:38.740> so

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:38.950 
so it's just a matter of adjusting it so

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:41.330 
so it's just a matter of adjusting it so
that<00:05:39.130> my<00:05:39.280> hole<00:05:39.610> on<00:05:39.910> the<00:05:40.030> bottom<00:05:40.210> doesn't<00:05:40.720> show

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:41.340 
that my hole on the bottom doesn't show

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:48.870 
that my hole on the bottom doesn't show
so<00:05:42.340> i<00:05:42.370> think<00:05:42.490> i<00:05:42.730> will<00:05:42.790> pull<00:05:43.240> that<00:05:43.480> down<00:05:47.490> okay<00:05:48.490> so

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:48.880 
so i think i will pull that down okay so
