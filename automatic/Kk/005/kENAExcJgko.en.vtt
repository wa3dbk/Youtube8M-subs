00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.090 
thing applies with the d7 just a larger

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:39.840 
thing applies with the d7 just a larger
version<00:01:37.479> of<00:01:37.630> it<00:01:37.829> and<00:01:38.829> a<00:01:39.039> little<00:01:39.159> hefty<00:01:39.399> R<00:01:39.610> so

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:39.850 
version of it and a little hefty R so

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.389 
version of it and a little hefty R so
falls<00:01:40.090> through<00:01:40.360> food<00:01:40.630> a<00:01:40.780> little<00:01:40.990> faster<00:01:41.439> has<00:01:42.250> a

00:01:42.389 --> 00:01:42.399 
falls through food a little faster has a

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:45.060 
falls through food a little faster has a
lot<00:01:42.610> more<00:01:42.640> heft<00:01:42.939> to<00:01:43.240> it<00:01:43.390> so<00:01:43.929> it<00:01:44.049> really<00:01:44.259> takes<00:01:44.920> a

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.070 
lot more heft to it so it really takes a

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:52.109 
lot more heft to it so it really takes a
beating<00:01:45.399> better<00:01:46.470> nice<00:01:47.470> tomato<00:01:47.829> slices<00:01:48.189> there

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:52.119 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:55.459 

again<00:01:52.840> you<00:01:52.960> can<00:01:53.079> still<00:01:53.350> use<00:01:53.469> the<00:01:53.590> back

00:01:55.459 --> 00:01:55.469 
again you can still use the back

00:01:55.469 --> 00:02:00.149 
again you can still use the back
the<00:01:55.979> chopping<00:01:56.429> like<00:01:56.609> that

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:00.159 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:03.359 

and<00:02:00.369> come<00:02:00.820> around<00:02:01.770> you<00:02:02.770> know<00:02:02.860> the<00:02:02.979> longer<00:02:03.280> it

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:03.369 
and come around you know the longer it

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:06.899 
and come around you know the longer it
is<00:02:03.460> obviously<00:02:03.850> the<00:02:04.030> easier<00:02:04.299> it<00:02:04.390> is<00:02:04.479> to<00:02:04.539> do<00:02:04.780> that

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:06.909 
is obviously the easier it is to do that

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:09.779 
is obviously the easier it is to do that
