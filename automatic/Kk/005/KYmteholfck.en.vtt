interface<00:03:47.690> so<00:03:48.650> anytime<00:03:49.070> you<00:03:49.670> have<00:03:49.880> like<00:03:50.240> all

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 
interface so anytime you have like all

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:54.280 
interface so anytime you have like all
this<00:03:51.680> adjusted<00:03:52.400> and<00:03:52.820> you<00:03:53.600> have<00:03:53.780> some<00:03:54.020> of<00:03:54.140> these

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.290 
this adjusted and you have some of these

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:56.560 
this adjusted and you have some of these
moved<00:03:54.680> around<00:03:55.010> anytime<00:03:55.700> you<00:03:56.030> want<00:03:56.209> to<00:03:56.330> get<00:03:56.450> it

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:56.570 
moved around anytime you want to get it

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:59.770 
moved around anytime you want to get it
back<00:03:56.720> to<00:03:57.520> how<00:03:58.520> should<00:03:58.790> we<00:03:58.850> say<00:03:59.030> like<00:03:59.209> standard

00:03:59.770 --> 00:03:59.780 
back to how should we say like standard

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:01.810 
back to how should we say like standard
in<00:03:59.959> order<00:04:00.650> to<00:04:00.830> do<00:04:00.890> that<00:04:01.130> you<00:04:01.459> just<00:04:01.490> go<00:04:01.700> to

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:01.820 
in order to do that you just go to

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:05.560 
in order to do that you just go to
button<00:04:02.300> and<00:04:02.540> then<00:04:03.500> you<00:04:03.590> go<00:04:03.709> to<00:04:03.770> new<00:04:04.100> or<00:04:04.940> excuse

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:05.570 
button and then you go to new or excuse

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:06.040 
button and then you go to new or excuse
me

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:06.050 
me

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:09.310 
me
reset<00:04:07.180> right<00:04:08.180> there<00:04:08.420> and<00:04:08.630> it<00:04:08.930> says<00:04:08.959> do<00:04:09.260> you

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:09.320 
reset right there and it says do you

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:11.320 
reset right there and it says do you
really<00:04:09.650> want<00:04:09.800> to<00:04:09.860> reset<00:04:10.370> and<00:04:10.520> press<00:04:10.790> yes<00:04:11.090> and

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:11.330 
really want to reset and press yes and

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:13.390 
really want to reset and press yes and
look<00:04:11.959> at<00:04:12.080> that<00:04:12.230> it<00:04:12.500> rearranged

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:13.400 
look at that it rearranged

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.640 
look at that it rearranged
every<00:04:13.730> single<00:04:14.000> thing<00:04:14.120> all<00:04:14.570> your<00:04:14.959> panels<00:04:15.410> and

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:15.650 
every single thing all your panels and

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:17.380 
every single thing all your panels and
brings<00:04:15.950> them<00:04:16.100> back<00:04:16.250> to<00:04:16.520> like<00:04:16.670> you<00:04:16.790> just<00:04:16.820> open

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:17.390 
brings them back to like you just open

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:20.229 
brings them back to like you just open
your<00:04:17.510> program<00:04:17.989> so<00:04:18.710> again<00:04:18.979> a<00:04:19.130> new<00:04:19.460> pretty<00:04:20.060> much

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 
your program so again a new pretty much

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:22.420 
your program so again a new pretty much
just<00:04:20.419> gives<00:04:20.660> you<00:04:20.780> a<00:04:20.810> new<00:04:21.049> file<00:04:21.380> but

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:22.430 
just gives you a new file but

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:25.029 
just gives you a new file but
reset<00:04:22.789> it<00:04:22.970> makes<00:04:23.630> the<00:04:23.780> interface<00:04:24.289> change<00:04:24.770> back

00:04:25.029 --> 00:04:25.039 
reset it makes the interface change back

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:27.100 
reset it makes the interface change back
to<00:04:25.160> the<00:04:25.220> standard<00:04:25.699> interface<00:04:26.180> so<00:04:26.360> that's<00:04:26.570> why

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110 
to the standard interface so that's why

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:29.110 
to the standard interface so that's why
those<00:04:27.350> two<00:04:27.380> are<00:04:27.680> separate<00:04:28.070> and<00:04:28.220> yes<00:04:28.580> they<00:04:29.060> do

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.120 
those two are separate and yes they do

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:31.779 
those two are separate and yes they do
actually<00:04:29.479> do<00:04:29.840> two<00:04:30.050> different<00:04:30.199> things<00:04:30.789> so

00:04:31.779 --> 00:04:31.789 
actually do two different things so

00:04:31.789 --> 00:04:34.330 
actually do two different things so
aside<00:04:32.330> from<00:04:32.570> this<00:04:32.810> anytime<00:04:33.740> you<00:04:33.889> want<00:04:34.130> to<00:04:34.190> open

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340 
aside from this anytime you want to open

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.580 
aside from this anytime you want to open
a<00:04:34.820> file<00:04:35.210> that<00:04:35.479> you've<00:04:35.630> already<00:04:35.930> been<00:04:36.199> working

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:36.590 
a file that you've already been working

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:39.249 
a file that you've already been working
on<00:04:36.860> you<00:04:37.610> could<00:04:37.759> probably<00:04:37.940> guess<00:04:38.270> I<00:04:38.509> just<00:04:39.050> got<00:04:39.229> a

00:04:39.249 --> 00:04:39.259 
on you could probably guess I just got a

00:04:39.259 --> 00:04:42.670 
on you could probably guess I just got a
file<00:04:39.590> and<00:04:39.979> then<00:04:40.310> open<00:04:40.789> but<00:04:41.660> sometimes<00:04:42.229> people

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:42.680 
file and then open but sometimes people

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:44.710 
file and then open but sometimes people
have<00:04:42.949> like<00:04:43.160> a<00:04:43.190> file<00:04:43.520> like<00:04:43.789> that<00:04:43.940> teapot<00:04:44.360> file

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:44.720 
have like a file like that teapot file

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.810 
have like a file like that teapot file
and<00:04:45.050> say<00:04:45.860> I<00:04:45.889> already<00:04:46.190> have<00:04:46.430> a<00:04:46.460> couple<00:04:46.639> of

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:46.820 
and say I already have a couple of

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:48.370 
and say I already have a couple of
shapes<00:04:47.030> here<00:04:47.300> that<00:04:47.509> I<00:04:47.539> want<00:04:47.810> to<00:04:47.870> keep<00:04:47.990> as<00:04:48.169> well

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:48.380 
shapes here that I want to keep as well

well<00:04:49.130> if<00:04:49.250> I<00:04:49.400> go<00:04:49.610> to<00:04:49.669> open<00:04:50.210> like<00:04:50.990> I<00:04:51.139> want<00:04:51.320> to

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:51.410 
well if I go to open like I want to

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:53.230 
well if I go to open like I want to
incorporate<00:04:51.919> that<00:04:52.100> teapot<00:04:52.520> into<00:04:52.880> this<00:04:53.000> new

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:53.240

one it's just going to open the teapot

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:58.120 
one it's just going to open the teapot
file<00:04:55.490> alone<00:04:56.150> on<00:04:56.360> itself<00:04:56.720> but<00:04:57.440> if<00:04:57.560> I<00:04:57.740> want<00:04:58.009> to

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:09.830 
here and I need to go to merge and what

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:12.159 
here and I need to go to merge and what
merge<00:05:10.130> is<00:05:10.430> going<00:05:10.639> to<00:05:10.699> do<00:05:10.940> is<00:05:11.180> bring<00:05:11.930> those

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:12.169 
merge is going to do is bring those

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:15.430 
merge is going to do is bring those
objects<00:05:12.970> from<00:05:13.970> another<00:05:14.360> file<00:05:14.690> into<00:05:15.289> the

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:15.440 
objects from another file into the

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.920 
objects from another file into the
current<00:05:15.919> file<00:05:16.280> so<00:05:16.970> it's<00:05:17.120> going<00:05:17.210> to<00:05:17.270> merge<00:05:17.570> two

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:17.930 
current file so it's going to merge two

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:21.610 
current file so it's going to merge two
files<00:05:18.259> into<00:05:18.590> one<00:05:18.740> so<00:05:19.669> don't<00:05:20.599> if<00:05:20.900> you<00:05:21.289> want<00:05:21.500> to

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:21.620 
files into one so don't if you want to

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:23.710 
files into one so don't if you want to
use<00:05:22.130> another<00:05:22.250> file<00:05:22.789> in<00:05:23.060> the<00:05:23.300> file<00:05:23.479> you're

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:23.720 
use another file in the file you're

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:25.719 
use another file in the file you're
working<00:05:24.020> on<00:05:24.110> you<00:05:24.590> can't<00:05:24.889> use<00:05:25.099> open<00:05:25.490> you<00:05:25.610> have

00:05:25.719 --> 00:05:25.729 
working on you can't use open you have

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:28.659 
working on you can't use open you have
to<00:05:25.849> go<00:05:25.970> to<00:05:26.030> import<00:05:26.539> merge<00:05:27.289> and<00:05:27.680> we'll<00:05:28.280> be<00:05:28.400> doing

00:05:28.659 --> 00:05:28.669 
to go to import merge and we'll be doing

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:31.839 
to go to import merge and we'll be doing
that<00:05:28.699> in<00:05:28.849> next<00:05:29.270> tutorial<00:05:29.720> Oh<00:05:29.840> actually<00:05:30.849> we

00:05:31.839 --> 00:05:31.849 
that in next tutorial Oh actually we

00:05:31.849 --> 00:05:33.610 
that in next tutorial Oh actually we
will<00:05:32.030> be<00:05:32.180> making<00:05:32.419> objects<00:05:33.169> in<00:05:33.289> the<00:05:33.409> next

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:33.620 
will be making objects in the next

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:36.279 
will be making objects in the next
tutorial<00:05:33.949> but<00:05:34.130> we<00:05:34.310> may<00:05:34.490> use<00:05:34.729> that<00:05:34.940> as<00:05:35.090> well<00:05:35.289> so

00:05:36.279 --> 00:05:36.289 
tutorial but we may use that as well so

00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:37.689
