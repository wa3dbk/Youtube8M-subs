back<00:02:17.580> wing<00:02:17.700> against<00:02:17.850> more<00:02:18.060> and<00:02:18.330> wow<00:02:18.630> okay<00:02:18.810> we

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
back wing against more and wow okay we

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:20.660 
back wing against more and wow okay we
are<00:02:19.380> super<00:02:19.830> lucky<00:02:20.070> before<00:02:20.190> it<00:02:20.400> took<00:02:20.460> me<00:02:20.580> like

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
are super lucky before it took me like

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.880 
are super lucky before it took me like
eight<00:02:20.850> sticks<00:02:21.210> to<00:02:21.870> like<00:02:22.050> and<00:02:22.260> as<00:02:22.500> you<00:02:22.740> can<00:02:22.860> see

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
eight sticks to like and as you can see

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.200 
eight sticks to like and as you can see
every<00:02:23.130> time<00:02:23.250> you<00:02:23.340> tap<00:02:23.490> the<00:02:23.670> stick<00:02:23.850> disappear

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.210 
every time you tap the stick disappear

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:26.030 
every time you tap the stick disappear
so<00:02:24.330> I<00:02:24.360> guess<00:02:24.480> that's<00:02:24.630> the<00:02:24.660> sacrifice<00:02:24.900> you<00:02:25.770> must

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
so I guess that's the sacrifice you must

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.220 
so I guess that's the sacrifice you must
make<00:02:26.310> for<00:02:26.820> fish<00:02:27.180> as<00:02:27.450> you<00:02:27.780> can<00:02:27.870> see<00:02:27.990> here<00:02:28.110> we
