 well-kept nails are the a and o 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.520
 Of course, they are particularly ingenious 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:41.350
 Unfortunately, I do not have enough time to do it regularly 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.820
 to go to a makeshift but that 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:44.440
 I do not have to deal with art deco anymore 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.629
 Can I sew the tough ones 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.920
 very easy to get home yourself before 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:50.019
 I start my nails 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.670
 of course, I have prepared perfectly 

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:53.199
 They filed the desired shape into the shape 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.760
 pushed back and one 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:57.250
 protective underlay applied 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.879
 Ingenious is that every color used 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.470
 can be 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:01.360
 so I'm wearing my favorite today 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:03.400
 the kind of cultural yummy i put in 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:05.049
 two layers have been applied 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.460
 I took care that I did not 

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:08.260
 explain to the north edge 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.630
 now the varnish has dried and it 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:13.710
 can start now to the most important 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.710
 led jacob co 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.150
 I start with my left hand 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.320
 take care that I do not get the top 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.940
 Apply to the skin 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.320
 if only I can do it with one 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.360
 remove rosewood chopsticks 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.860
 very important also the tip of the nails 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.480
 cover the best for the 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.910
 needle point with a thin line of 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:32.500
 one side to the other seal 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:34.240
 like the pro I would have the top coat 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.650
 with the help of the LED lamp she is 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:39.610
 easy to use and is per 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:41.380
 button press for 30 seconds enabled now 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:44.110
 I hold my thumbs under the led 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.640
 lamp for a total of 60 seconds afterwards 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.130
 I repeat the whole thing with the other one 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.229
 I can hand for better durability 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.940
 now another layer the led Jacob 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:53.880
 Apply briefly and cure again 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:56.500
 to let 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.570
 when curing always creates a kind 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.250
 protective layer these do not quite remove 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:02.649
 easy with the kremser ago led the 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.210

 Cleaning fluid waiting for you 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:08.649

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:11.560
 then wash your hands with water for a short time 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:13.300

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.190
 Nails in the dell lures you are now 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:18.130
 perfectly hardened with brilliant shine 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.780

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:21.100
 new look I can do the g'schicht too 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.200
 just remove yourself 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.820
 with the professional file I rough the upper one 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.680
 First coat something on it up 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:28.510
 no longer shines this pretreatment 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.920
 is very important so can the 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.209
 subsequent remover liquid 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.310
 bring in better and the insulating layer 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:34.420
 to solve 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:37.000
 great are the ones specifically for this 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:39.340
 developed racing overalls raps this 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.680
 first with the renova trout dj great 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.660
 stretch and place on the nail 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.220
 Now I put the film over the 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:47.690
 fingertip and wrap the entire 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.190
 fingertip firmly 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.660
 I'll do that to the others now 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.560
 finger and leave it for about five minutes 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.900
 influence 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.400
 dj mass is now viscous and I can 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.700
 remove them easily by removing the 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:00.410
 Alu pads with light pressure share to 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:03.910
 maybe close the nails 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:05.890
 clean and rid of remnants 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:08.240
 as if nothing had happened 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:10.850
 it's that easy to conjure a gel look 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:12.110
 which lasts up to ten days and on request 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:14.230
 I can easily return to them 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.230
