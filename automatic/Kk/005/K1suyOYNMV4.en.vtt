achievable with all of the settings by

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.130 
achievable with all of the settings by
default<00:00:50.030> you<00:00:51.030> will<00:00:51.180> then<00:00:51.360> be<00:00:51.390> able<00:00:51.629> to<00:00:51.780> tweak

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
default you will then be able to tweak

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.779 
default you will then be able to tweak
the<00:00:52.170> results<00:00:52.739> to<00:00:52.920> obtain<00:00:53.219> a<00:00:53.250> much<00:00:53.550> better

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
the results to obtain a much better

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.510 
the results to obtain a much better
quality<00:00:54.590> so<00:00:55.590> let's<00:00:55.770> take<00:00:55.949> a<00:00:56.010> look<00:00:56.280> at<00:00:56.399> this

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
quality so let's take a look at this

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.209 
quality so let's take a look at this
default<00:00:57.000> animation<00:00:57.770> with<00:00:58.770> voice-o-matic

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
default animation with voice-o-matic

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.090 
default animation with voice-o-matic
create<00:01:00.000> quality<00:01:00.239> lip-sync<00:01:00.870> in<00:01:01.050> a<00:01:01.469> snap<00:01:01.829> with

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
create quality lip-sync in a snap with

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:10.520 
voice-o-matic create quality lip-sync in
a<00:01:04.949> snap<00:01:07.310> ok<00:01:08.310> so<00:01:09.119> analyzing<00:01:09.780> what<00:01:09.930> we<00:01:10.049> just<00:01:10.229> saw

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
a snap ok so analyzing what we just saw

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.710 
a snap ok so analyzing what we just saw
the<00:01:10.860> first<00:01:11.430> pass<00:01:11.640> of<00:01:11.850> animation<00:01:12.360> had<00:01:12.600> our

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
the first pass of animation had our

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.630 
the first pass of animation had our
friend<00:01:12.990> whip<00:01:13.260> switch<00:01:13.619> from<00:01:13.860> one<00:01:14.070> mouth<00:01:14.310> to

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
friend whip switch from one mouth to

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.870 
friend whip switch from one mouth to
another<00:01:15.000> in<00:01:15.210> a<00:01:15.299> rather<00:01:15.540> sharp<00:01:16.110> manner<00:01:16.880> this

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
another in a rather sharp manner this

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.060 
another in a rather sharp manner this
can<00:01:18.090> easily<00:01:18.360> be<00:01:18.630> resolved<00:01:19.290> by<00:01:19.439> enabling<00:01:19.680> the

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
can easily be resolved by enabling the

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.800 
can easily be resolved by enabling the
waiting<00:01:20.520> option<00:01:23.150> moving<00:01:24.150> on<00:01:24.299> we<00:01:24.509> can<00:01:24.659> go<00:01:24.750> to

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
waiting option moving on we can go to

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.649 
waiting option moving on we can go to
the<00:01:24.990> phony<00:01:25.259> mapping<00:01:25.920> section<00:01:26.220> and<00:01:26.549> select<00:01:27.390> the

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
the phony mapping section and select the

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.550 
the phony mapping section and select the
UW<00:01:28.500> q<00:01:28.770> mouth<00:01:29.070> position<00:01:29.610> if<00:01:30.229> you<00:01:31.229> look<00:01:31.350> at<00:01:31.530> the

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
UW q mouth position if you look at the

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.890 
UW q mouth position if you look at the
bottom<00:01:31.979> left<00:01:32.220> corner<00:01:32.490> of<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.939> section<00:01:33.420> you

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
bottom left corner of the section you

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.539 
bottom left corner of the section you
will<00:01:33.990> see<00:01:34.229> that<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.560> intensity<00:01:35.189> of<00:01:35.400> this

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
will see that the intensity of this

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.300 
will see that the intensity of this
visine<00:01:36.090> is<00:01:36.270> of<00:01:36.420> two<00:01:36.659> instead<00:01:37.229> of<00:01:37.290> one<00:01:37.409> the

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
visine is of two instead of one the

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.060 
visine is of two instead of one the
reason<00:01:38.700> for<00:01:38.729> this<00:01:38.939> is<00:01:39.060> that<00:01:39.329> by<00:01:39.720> default

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
reason for this is that by default

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.649 
reason for this is that by default
voice-o-matic<00:01:41.070> is<00:01:41.490> set<00:01:41.670> to<00:01:41.850> exaggerate<00:01:42.509> the

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
voice-o-matic is set to exaggerate the

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.289 
voice-o-matic is set to exaggerate the
you<00:01:42.899> mouth<00:01:43.140> position<00:01:43.649> as<00:01:44.060> typically<00:01:45.060> in<00:01:45.270> the

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
you mouth position as typically in the

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:46.969 
you mouth position as typically in the
English<00:01:45.659> language<00:01:45.689> you<00:01:46.619> will<00:01:46.770> naturally

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
English language you will naturally

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.950 
English language you will naturally
exaggerate<00:01:47.939> the<00:01:48.060> puckering<00:01:48.450> of<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:48.750> lips

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
exaggerate the puckering of the lips

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.700 
exaggerate the puckering of the lips
when<00:01:49.259> speaking<00:01:50.780> so<00:01:51.780> I<00:01:51.810> will<00:01:52.079> reduce<00:01:52.439> that<00:01:52.649> to

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
when speaking so I will reduce that to

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.370 
when speaking so I will reduce that to
one<00:01:53.220> and<00:01:53.520> lower<00:01:54.119> the<00:01:54.329> intensity<00:01:54.659> of<00:01:55.049> the<00:01:55.170> mouth

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
one and lower the intensity of the mouth

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.709 
one and lower the intensity of the mouth
opening<00:01:55.829> as<00:01:56.009> well<00:01:56.219> so<00:01:57.060> instead<00:01:57.390> of<00:01:57.540> keeping

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
opening as well so instead of keeping

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.260 
opening as well so instead of keeping
the<00:01:58.020> a<00:01:58.049> at<00:01:58.530> one<00:01:58.860> hundred<00:01:59.040> percent<00:01:59.219> I<00:01:59.820> will<00:02:00.060> keep

the a at one hundred percent I will keep

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.840 
the a at one hundred percent I will keep
it<00:02:00.390> at<00:02:00.509> seventy<00:02:00.899> percent<00:02:01.079> like<00:02:01.500> this<00:02:01.740> and<00:02:02.040> i

exception of the th mouth position that
is<00:03:20.100> weighted<00:03:21.739> now<00:03:22.739> another<00:03:23.010> thing<00:03:23.130> that<00:03:23.520> is

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:23.550 
is weighted now another thing that is

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:26.570 
is weighted now another thing that is
very<00:03:23.850> cool<00:03:24.090> is<00:03:24.330> that<00:03:24.930> in<00:03:25.230> 3ds<00:03:25.620> max<00:03:25.739> we<00:03:26.250> can<00:03:26.430> use

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580 
very cool is that in 3ds max we can use

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.610 
very cool is that in 3ds max we can use
the<00:03:26.790> keyframes<00:03:27.390> tool<00:03:27.750> to<00:03:28.140> adjust<00:03:28.260> the

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
keyframes so let's change the

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:33.170 
keyframes so let's change the
interpolation<00:03:31.350> of<00:03:31.770> the<00:03:31.890> keyframes<00:03:32.370> like<00:03:32.940> this

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
interpolation of the keyframes like this

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.110 
interpolation of the keyframes like this
and<00:03:33.420> click<00:03:34.020> create<00:03:34.260> keys<00:03:34.820> you<00:03:35.820> can<00:03:35.970> now<00:03:36.090> see

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
and click create keys you can now see

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.120 
and click create keys you can now see
that<00:03:36.390> all<00:03:36.780> of<00:03:36.959> the<00:03:37.080> keys<00:03:37.350> and<00:03:37.680> all<00:03:37.860> of<00:03:38.010> the

completely change the style of this

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:06.160 
completely change the style of this
animation<00:04:03.690> I<00:04:04.020> could<00:04:04.680> use<00:04:04.890> step<00:04:05.310> keyframes

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:06.170

step<00:04:07.170> keyframes<00:04:07.800> would<00:04:08.190> make<00:04:08.370> the<00:04:08.520> animation

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 
step keyframes would make the animation

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:13.580 
step keyframes would make the animation
look<00:04:09.239> very<00:04:09.540> claymation<00:04:10.170> esque<00:04:12.590> with

what<00:04:22.080> we<00:04:22.229> want<00:04:22.260> though<00:04:22.680> right<00:04:22.950> we<00:04:23.940> really<00:04:24.210> want

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:24.510 
what we want though right we really want

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:26.770 
what we want though right we really want
something<00:04:24.840> smooth<00:04:25.350> and<00:04:25.650> natural

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.780 
something smooth and natural

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:30.230 
something smooth and natural
so<00:04:27.780> going<00:04:28.110> back<00:04:28.290> to<00:04:28.350> the<00:04:28.650> curve<00:04:28.860> editor<00:04:29.070> we<00:04:30.060> can
