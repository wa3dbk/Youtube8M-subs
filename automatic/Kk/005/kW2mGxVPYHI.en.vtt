00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:09.010
 hi to all if axel mobile.fr tests 

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:12.140
 g 

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:14.420
 the eyes the hasselbeck but at mwc 2 

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:15.320
 13 and yes I had already presented it to you 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:18.770
 during these ms 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:20.450
 but since it has evolved a little 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:23.300
 then not at the level of the specs one has 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:23.840
 still here is a giant screen 6.1 inches 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.080
 etc. 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.759
 it was a big quad core of the house 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:31.880
 which is interesting is rather to 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:34.280
 inside at the interface level 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.600
 to the new version actually makes 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.220
 yoann machines and that I wanted you 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.900
 introduce quickly on the guy in 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:40.700
 particular since as you will see 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:43.790
 there are features finally there are 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:45.590
 an exclusive omate feature we're going 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:47.270
 say two small features that I 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:48.440
 will show you right away so we 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:50.260
 will start first by actually a little 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.460
 tower in the overlay 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.410
 the deer in this latest version 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:56.440
 which is the same we will find on the 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:58.690
 p2 on the beginning so then we're going 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:02.229
 start with what we have the drawer of 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:06.009
 notifications that is customizable 

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:07.210
 hop here with this system there we can 

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:08.740
 organize things you want 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:12.280
 display in the notification tyrol 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:16.259
 at the level of rapid access control 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.259
 parameters we have this widget there 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.729
 that's because I wanted to do it the 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:24.820
 master not very well yet the one who 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:24.820
 is here to stay to do everything 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:30.110
 so that's where I was there actually 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.880
 it's a blog we can on the screen 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.649
 which allows you to insert 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.110
 Minimal g in for you to be a little 

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:38.780
 square for example I have to remove that I 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:41.350
 will say that I'll put it this 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.350
 will not do it 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:48.350
 good I put it back here it is also 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:53.869
 chose an album finally yesterday morning 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:54.619
 I take it off to make a contact etc 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:57.350
 etc. 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:58.430
 this is for this widget dropped some 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:01.100
 something new is something 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:03.170
 we have here we have no main menu 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:06.680
 since it's spirit here are two 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:09.140
 emissions one also has systems of 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:11.480
 folders etc which are pretty well done 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.950
 with the possibility to choose the 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.750
 applications that we want to add to the 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.750
 folder and that's it it's this little 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:20.120
 party there it's nice and last thing 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:23.269
 finally not last thing is looking for me 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:25.459
 look for themes and we have a system the 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:29.150
 theme that makes me personally 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:31.040
 a lot of thought to me actually makes it a 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.209
 launcher with which his partner I 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.160
 am ready I do not know the name of the young 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:37.580
 but you'll probably see it 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.870
 over time we should we should 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.489
 know it test time anyway 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.720
 so is there you have themes that 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:44.090
 you apply a tower theme and then 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.950
 customize the theme and say i want 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.269
 icons of such themes etc etc 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:52.280
 So it really reminds me put 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:54.579
 turn so it's pretty nice ok and 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:57.120
 then last little thing we have that then 

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:59.950
 that's an element 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:02.260
 activate there it's called stand autumn 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.819
 and it just makes it possible to have 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:08.769
 it's like a system of micro apps 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:11.680
 and sony or application systems at 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:13.900
 content at samsung by 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:18.790
 example up I display the calculation the 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:19.989
 wrestler the sad caccia I can 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.540
 send a new message to someone 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:27.790
 very quickly that way there etc. 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:30.060
 etc 1 and its also that allows in 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.060
 made 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:36.430
 of links posted that way so 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:39.510
 yes that's a lot like thinking about 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:42.780
 found for example at samsung but 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:45.340
 but I think that it goes well 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:47.050
 here and his little ones this little round there 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:49.240
 can be disabled and you can 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:51.430
 also move it where you want 

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:54.010
 on the sides what fortis likes the least 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.870
 possible last thing I wanted 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:04:00.360
 to talk to you maybe forgets them 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:00.360
 things there are also 

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:05.330
 these elements there so it's for 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:10.430
 make it easy to use one hand I 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:12.620
 sue cochet so skeptical mans 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:14.400
 these passages do it I'm going to send a 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.840
 message 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:19.840
 at the port not necessarily besides a 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:22.660
 stage here is where we have the keyboard 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:26.160
 of basic android if I rock on the 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:26.160
 huawei keyboard 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:34.880
 here we have what are displayed like that 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:35.600
 with the ability to switch right 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.370
 or left 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:39.380
 of course you have azerty keyboard do not 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:40.640
 do not worry he's I do not know 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:42.320
 for you but he's somewhere by 

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:44.770
 the 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:47.570
 this is for this keyboard there and then 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:52.150
 you also have this system there for 

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:52.150
 the composition number here 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:56.590
 facilitate one-handed use by 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:58.870
 the a75 and last thing 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:59.880
 gold it's fabulous if for sam just so 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:02.560
 you put a password is normal 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:05.380
 if I'm not mistaken so here I am 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:07.180
 wish for the small preview of the mail 

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:08.650
 with the latest version of the overlay 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:12.099
 and machet is there that I really find 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:14.139
 nice rent is it is original in 

00:05:12.099 --> 00:05:16.090
 tortel after she borrows elements 

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:17.129
 to different different devices on 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:18.449
 inch 

00:05:17.129 --> 00:05:20.159
 the na who sees there are some who 

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:23.190
 will prove that it looks like for a 

00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:25.800
 man is that it's a bit for a 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:27.090
 a myth or finally here but in the end I 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:28.710
 find that it brings value 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:29.580
 to the products on a screen this 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:30.990
 size there all these little ones 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:31.530
 features it's really 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:33.930
 nice 

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:36.510
 so here I hope that this little 

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:41.720
 second one will say grips gates 

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:41.720
 for the guy you'll like soon
