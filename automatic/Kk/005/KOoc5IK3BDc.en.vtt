security issues on Windows PCs for the

security issues on Windows PCs for the
last<00:00:25.470> two<00:00:25.679> years<00:00:25.949> so<00:00:26.640> since<00:00:27.179> the<00:00:27.359> Windows<00:00:27.689> 7

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019

last two years so since the Windows 7
flash<00:00:28.589> player<00:00:29.039> is<00:00:29.070> such<00:00:29.460> an<00:00:29.609> integral<00:00:29.910> part<00:00:30.060> of

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
flash player is such an integral part of

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.250 
flash player is such an integral part of
using<00:00:31.169> websites<00:00:32.130> I<00:00:32.460> thought<00:00:33.240> I<00:00:33.480> would<00:00:33.750> talk

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
using websites I thought I would talk

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.370 
using websites I thought I would talk
about<00:00:34.320> that<00:00:34.620> from<00:00:34.829> a<00:00:35.070> security<00:00:35.550> standpoint

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:36.380 
about that from a security standpoint

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:40.310 
about that from a security standpoint
so<00:00:37.940> essentially<00:00:38.940> adobe<00:00:39.480> are<00:00:39.719> pushing<00:00:39.989> out

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
so essentially adobe are pushing out

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.670 
so essentially adobe are pushing out
these<00:00:41.039> days<00:00:41.280> updates<00:00:42.270> continual<00:00:43.230> updates<00:00:43.350> to

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
you'll see here that actually we've got

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.160 
you'll see here that actually we've got
two<00:01:22.890> different<00:01:23.100> versions<00:01:23.670> of<00:01:23.880> flash<00:01:24.840> running

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
two different versions of flash running

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.960 
two different versions of flash running
on<00:01:25.380> here<00:01:25.620> and<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.220> reason<00:01:26.460> out<00:01:26.580> is<00:01:26.760> they've

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
on here and the reason out is they've

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.800 
on here and the reason out is they've
just<00:01:27.000> rolled<00:01:27.510> out<00:01:27.690> version<00:01:28.620> 11<00:01:29.250> and<00:01:29.810> the

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
just rolled out version 11 and the

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.240 
just rolled out version 11 and the
plug-in<00:01:31.020> version<00:01:31.260> on<00:01:31.530> this<00:01:31.680> machine<00:01:31.830> hasn't

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
plug-in version on this machine hasn't

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.550 
plug-in version on this machine hasn't
caught<00:01:32.550> up<00:01:32.760> yet<00:01:33.000> so<00:01:33.420> let<00:01:33.690> me<00:01:33.780> just<00:01:33.930> explain<00:01:34.260> the

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
caught up yet so let me just explain the

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.410 
caught up yet so let me just explain the
difference<00:01:34.860> between<00:01:34.920> ActiveX<00:01:35.700> and<00:01:35.940> the

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
difference between ActiveX and the

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.320 
difference between ActiveX and the
plug-in<00:01:36.930> versions<00:01:37.730> essentially<00:01:38.730> the<00:01:38.940> active

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:39.330 
plug-in versions essentially the active

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:43.610 
plug-in versions essentially the active
X<00:01:39.540> version<00:01:40.050> is<00:01:40.230> the<00:01:40.980> flash<00:01:41.730> technology<00:01:42.690> that's

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:43.620 
X version is the flash technology that's

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:46.520 
X version is the flash technology that's
being<00:01:43.830> used<00:01:44.190> in<00:01:44.460> Windows<00:01:45.270> Internet<00:01:45.870> Explorer

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
being used in Windows Internet Explorer

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.840 
being used in Windows Internet Explorer
now<00:01:47.970> Internet<00:01:48.420> Explorer<00:01:48.780> uses<00:01:49.140> ActiveX<00:01:49.850> no

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
now Internet Explorer uses ActiveX no

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.700 
now Internet Explorer uses ActiveX no
other<00:01:51.030> browser<00:01:51.300> does<00:01:51.630> and<00:01:51.930> the<00:01:52.410> core

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
other browser does and the core

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.670 
other browser does and the core
operating<00:01:53.310> system<00:01:53.730> doesn't<00:01:54.360> for<00:01:54.720> any

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
operating system doesn't for any

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.580 
operating system doesn't for any
programs<00:01:56.130> it's<00:01:56.340> running<00:01:56.610> so<00:01:57.350> we<00:01:58.350> therefore

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
programs it's running so we therefore

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.590 
programs it's running so we therefore
have<00:01:58.920> two<00:01:59.100> versions<00:01:59.340> of<00:01:59.640> flash<00:01:59.850> in<00:02:00.120> one<00:02:00.450> for

have two versions of flash in one for

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.120 
have two versions of flash in one for
Internet<00:02:00.900> Explorer<00:02:01.320> and<00:02:01.560> then<00:02:01.680> one<00:02:01.860> for

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
Internet Explorer and then one for

Firefox Mozilla Netscape and opera then

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.520 
Firefox Mozilla Netscape and opera then
it<00:02:40.210> should<00:02:40.420> also<00:02:40.570> be<00:02:40.750> running<00:02:41.110> that<00:02:41.290> version

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
it should also be running that version

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.449 
it should also be running that version
as<00:02:41.890> well<00:02:41.970> so<00:02:42.970> I'm<00:02:43.090> going<00:02:43.240> to<00:02:43.300> close<00:02:43.420> down<00:02:43.690> and

as well so I'm going to close down and
I'm<00:02:45.459> going<00:02:45.610> to<00:02:45.640> go<00:02:45.730> ahead<00:02:45.820> and<00:02:46.150> open<00:02:46.360> up<00:02:47.370> my<00:02:48.370> Fox

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
I'm going to go ahead and open up my Fox

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:51.210 
I'm going to go ahead and open up my Fox
because<00:02:49.030> that's<00:02:49.180> the<00:02:49.420> other<00:02:49.870> browser<00:02:50.770> I<00:02:50.980> run

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
because that's the other browser I run

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:55.440 
because that's the other browser I run
on<00:02:51.340> here<00:02:52.860> now<00:02:53.860> in<00:02:54.130> Firefox<00:02:54.610> I<00:02:54.850> can<00:02:55.030> come<00:02:55.209> along

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
on here now in Firefox I can come along

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:01.190 
on here now in Firefox I can come along
and<00:02:55.660> go<00:02:56.620> to<00:02:56.680> add-ons<00:02:58.590> and<00:02:59.590> if<00:03:00.340> I<00:03:00.459> scroll<00:03:00.820> down

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
and go to add-ons and if I scroll down

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.870 
and go to add-ons and if I scroll down
so<00:03:02.200> it's<00:03:02.350> the<00:03:02.440> shockwave<00:03:02.800> flash<00:03:02.950> and<00:03:03.520> I<00:03:03.730> can

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
so it's the shockwave flash and I can

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.640 
so it's the shockwave flash and I can
see<00:03:04.030> yet<00:03:04.239> it's<00:03:04.420> running<00:03:04.750> the<00:03:04.780> older<00:03:05.290> version

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
see yet it's running the older version

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.190 
see yet it's running the older version

Internet
in<00:03:11.770> Firefox<00:03:14.190> it<00:03:15.190> will<00:03:15.459> automatically<00:03:16.090> sense

in Firefox it will automatically sense

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:18.990 
in Firefox it will automatically sense
that<00:03:17.709> I've<00:03:17.800> got<00:03:17.950> an<00:03:18.040> outdated<00:03:18.310> version<00:03:18.880> of

that I've got an outdated version of

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.580 
that I've got an outdated version of
flash<00:03:19.239> because<00:03:19.780> it<00:03:19.959> will<00:03:20.050> communicate<00:03:20.230> with

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
flash because it will communicate with

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.430 
flash because it will communicate with
the<00:03:20.739> website<00:03:21.209> and<00:03:22.209> it<00:03:22.780> will<00:03:22.900> then<00:03:23.049> go<00:03:23.200> ahead

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440 
the website and it will then go ahead

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.770 
the website and it will then go ahead
and<00:03:23.560> ask<00:03:23.739> me<00:03:24.040> do<00:03:24.190> I<00:03:24.220> want<00:03:24.549> to<00:03:24.760> go<00:03:25.239> ahead<00:03:25.360> and

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
and ask me do I want to go ahead and

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.920 
and ask me do I want to go ahead and
install<00:03:26.250> but<00:03:27.250> I<00:03:27.280> can<00:03:27.459> also<00:03:27.580> manually<00:03:28.120> go<00:03:28.630> ahead

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
install but I can also manually go ahead

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:30.870 
install but I can also manually go ahead
and<00:03:29.110> install<00:03:29.410> that<00:03:29.440> by<00:03:29.799> in<00:03:29.860> Firefox<00:03:30.370> going<00:03:30.700> to

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:30.880 
and install that by in Firefox going to

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.120 
and install that by in Firefox going to
Adobe<00:03:31.239> Flash<00:03:31.450> Player<00:03:31.690> plugin<00:03:32.350> website<00:03:32.830> and

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
Adobe Flash Player plugin website and

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.370 
Adobe Flash Player plugin website and
downloading<00:03:33.820> the<00:03:34.630> download<00:03:34.959> from<00:03:35.080> there<00:03:35.260> and

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:35.380 
downloading the download from there and

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:36.720 
downloading the download from there and
I<00:03:35.410> think<00:03:35.470> it's<00:03:35.650> about<00:03:35.769> 3<00:03:35.980> megabyte<00:03:36.340> download

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
I think it's about 3 megabyte download

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:40.770 
I think it's about 3 megabyte download
so<00:03:37.739> this<00:03:38.739> is<00:03:38.860> where<00:03:39.070> we<00:03:39.430> basically<00:03:40.030> check<00:03:40.570> for

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
so this is where we basically check for

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:42.870 
so this is where we basically check for
updates<00:03:41.080> automatically<00:03:41.620> but<00:03:42.280> remember<00:03:42.670> if

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:42.880 
updates automatically but remember if

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:43.830 
updates automatically but remember if
they're<00:03:43.030> rolling<00:03:43.299> out<00:03:43.390> a<00:03:43.420> new<00:03:43.510> version

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.840 
they're rolling out a new version

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.300 
they're rolling out a new version
currently<00:03:44.170> which<00:03:44.500> they<00:03:44.650> are<00:03:44.739> at<00:03:44.860> the<00:03:44.950> moment

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
currently which they are at the moment

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:47.699 
currently which they are at the moment
then<00:03:45.820> you<00:03:46.180> might<00:03:46.450> have<00:03:46.780> a<00:03:47.049> versioning

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 
then you might have a versioning

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:49.410 
then you might have a versioning
difference<00:03:48.070> between<00:03:48.459> internet<00:03:48.820> explorer<00:03:49.239> and

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:49.420 
difference between internet explorer and

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:52.199 
difference between internet explorer and
your<00:03:50.140> other<00:03:50.350> browser<00:03:50.709> plugins<00:03:51.190> and<00:03:51.459> we've

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:52.209 
your other browser plugins and we've

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:54.300 
your other browser plugins and we've
also<00:03:52.360> just<00:03:52.510> discussed<00:03:53.110> as<00:03:53.320> what<00:03:53.650> ActiveX<00:03:54.100> is

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
also just discussed as what ActiveX is

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:56.880 
also just discussed as what ActiveX is
is<00:03:54.549> really<00:03:54.790> just<00:03:55.030> Internet<00:03:55.360> Explorer<00:03:55.890> and

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:56.890 
is really just Internet Explorer and

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:58.949 
is really just Internet Explorer and
then<00:03:57.070> we<00:03:57.220> have<00:03:57.400> plug-in<00:03:57.940> versions<00:03:58.330> here<00:03:58.750> and

00:03:58.949 --> 00:03:58.959 
then we have plug-in versions here and

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:00.030 
then we have plug-in versions here and
this<00:03:59.230> is<00:03:59.350> going<00:03:59.440> to<00:03:59.530> be<00:03:59.620> for<00:03:59.769> Chrome<00:04:00.010> and

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
this is going to be for Chrome and

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.840 
this is going to be for Chrome and
Safari<00:04:00.400> and<00:04:01.209> Firefox<00:04:01.290> etc<00:04:02.340> so<00:04:03.340> hopefully

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:03.850 
Safari and Firefox etc so hopefully

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:05.310 
Safari and Firefox etc so hopefully
that's<00:04:04.000> been<00:04:04.209> useful<00:04:04.390> for<00:04:04.630> you

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:05.320 
that's been useful for you

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:07.500 
that's been useful for you
flash<00:04:05.739> is<00:04:06.010> certainly<00:04:06.430> something<00:04:06.670> I<00:04:06.970> would

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510
