00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:10.139
 It is not motivating to start 

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:12.520
 winning a match even if friendly 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.430
 of course 

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:17.500
 that has to do with what we call a 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:19.360
 process that takes you to a result that 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.640
 it came to you in a product and if it was 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:24.400
 important to start winning but a lot 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:27.100
 more important is what we have looked at 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:29.870
 the distinction between what was the first 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:34.100
 time and the second 

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:38.990
 what data do you withdraw more towards the future 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:41.510
 to face that distinction first the 

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:42.690
 fundamental point for us has to 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.879
 watch 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.579
 we ourselves have supported our 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.769
 team like antonio then you get 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:53.940
 you support the team as the whole does not 

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:56.610
 you can relax for a single second what 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:00.120
 be a 2003 player because today in the 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:03.120
 current football if a player is 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.220
 outside he only plays when he wants the team 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:09.830
 it's going to happen badly against anyone 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.830
 then that is the most important point 

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:27.860
 and 889 players want to do it not only 

00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:27.860
 the other team has left it 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:37.860
 a team as a real team has 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:40.140
 done a lot of respect then that's a 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.780
 most important point the whole that is the 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.030
 team is always but always much more 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.800
 important that the event was walking 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.020
 well then more happy with this 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.909
 concept of everything there in the face of 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.179
 first tournament start 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:58.140
 look you have a long time still there 

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:59.909
 many things to improve but you're already 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.539
 looking at many of the principles and you 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:06.719
 like staring say that in the first 

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:08.849
 half has had more difficulties because 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:12.239
 not all have more control over 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:14.459
 the ball if you notice and you ask 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:16.110
 to the Altamira players that 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:19.349
 they played the first second half when 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:21.269
 you have been more tired something will be 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:24.200
 been in the second I say why 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:24.200
 did not have the ball 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:39.080
 a very long way to travel up to 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.240
 that they reach 5 as they want 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:43.160
 teacher no particular because he does in 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:44.720
 this type of matches behind closed doors 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.030
 There are some 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.360
 time and specific no no theme 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.360
 none 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.710
 almost in the same space as you 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.170
 you train 

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:05.510
 almost with the same number of people that 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:07.840
 they watch them training to make a 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:10.010
 change transfer to say that the 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:13.340
 demand and the demand that we put is 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:15.800
 different is different but we're going 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.930
 doing space for example I can you 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:20.030
 to say also that what he touches is 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:22.190
 adversary we did not know and in a 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:24.050
 official match if you have to 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:26.660
 know it then as you go 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:29.270
 approaching and that you have more matches 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:31.520
 friendly you are putting it putting 

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:33.920
 open for you to have public and 

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:35.720
 you also have a knowledge of 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.150
 adversary so that the game is more 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:40.750
 next of what is life 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:43.130
 you want to put when you're in the tournament 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:45.950
 teacher 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:47.510
 they are three more parties 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:48.920
 and there goes the team running 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:50.959
 but I would like to talk about the players 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.660
 today that what they tell me they highlighted 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:55.970
 néstor calderón and andres rentería how 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:58.910
 they go loose because they are new 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:01.220
 He says to you 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:03.950
 I made the distinction between the dual ibi 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:07.070
 and the winch and everything is for me what 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:09.560
 it's more important I do not do it now and not 

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:12.050
 I will do it in what touches situations 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:13.740
 individual because it would be unfair to 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:16.519
 others 

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:19.009
 even better renteria 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:21.019
 and Calderón are the two who have been in 

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:22.480
 the second has not made the step and another the 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:24.700
 good center 

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:27.370
 they only have done it because the team 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:29.170
 allowed them to do it then not what 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:31.300
 I will comment on the subject of individual 

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:33.460
 but I will tell you that we have many and 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:35.080
 good options that will allow us 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:36.580
 always have a very strong whole 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.890
 I understand the concept of everything but in order 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:40.110
 of accounts since everything is articulated 

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:43.080
 by individuality 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:45.420
 yes but if you are taking the 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:48.240
 individual how do you do it here two 

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:50.880
 material players do not do anything are 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:52.530
 important we like very much the 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:54.750
 players the quality that they have the 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:56.010
 competition they have but you have to see 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:58.530
 look at it alone 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:00.720
 everything is important and they can make you 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:03.690
 the distinction and the difference in a 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:05.460
 party but always with the support of the 

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:07.530
 next matches will be equal to doors 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:09.860
 closed giving them a space they are not going to 

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:09.860
 change 

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:17.390
 they will have the information we give when
