directly into the garden what you do is

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.600 
directly into the garden what you do is
just<00:03:04.120> dig<00:03:04.450> a<00:03:04.480> hole<00:03:05.250> large<00:03:06.250> enough<00:03:06.340> to

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:08.709 
accommodate the size of the tuber so

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:10.320 
accommodate the size of the tuber so
place<00:03:08.890> your<00:03:08.920> two<00:03:09.130> were<00:03:09.250> in<00:03:09.370> the<00:03:09.489> hole<00:03:09.640> cover<00:03:10.150> it

different ways to stake your Dahlia one
simple<00:04:00.790> solution<00:04:01.329> is<00:04:01.600> using<00:04:02.049> a<00:04:02.139> bamboo<00:04:02.530> cane

00:04:02.789 --> 00:04:02.799 
simple solution is using a bamboo cane

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:06.020 
simple solution is using a bamboo cane
and<00:04:03.070> some<00:04:03.970> twine

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
and some twine

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:13.080 
and some twine
so<00:04:07.030> I<00:04:07.090> place<00:04:07.330> the<00:04:07.569> cane<00:04:11.400> sort<00:04:12.400> of<00:04:12.549> behind<00:04:12.909> the

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.090 
so I place the cane sort of behind the

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:15.960 
so I place the cane sort of behind the
Dahlia<00:04:13.480> plant<00:04:13.920> and<00:04:14.920> I'm<00:04:15.010> going<00:04:15.159> to<00:04:15.220> be<00:04:15.370> pushing

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:15.970 
Dahlia plant and I'm going to be pushing

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:19.080 
Dahlia plant and I'm going to be pushing
the<00:04:16.150> stake<00:04:16.720> into<00:04:16.989> the<00:04:17.199> ground<00:04:17.729> push<00:04:18.729> the<00:04:18.880> stake

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.090 
the stake into the ground push the stake

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:22.590 
the stake into the ground push the stake
in<00:04:19.919> so<00:04:20.919> the<00:04:21.070> stake<00:04:21.310> is<00:04:21.609> really<00:04:21.820> secure<00:04:22.210> in<00:04:22.479> the

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:22.600 
in so the stake is really secure in the

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.230 
in so the stake is really secure in the
ground<00:04:23.370> remember<00:04:24.370> though<00:04:24.520> there's<00:04:24.790> a<00:04:24.850> tuber

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.240

ground remember though there's a tuber
down<00:04:25.419> there<00:04:25.630> so<00:04:25.870> you<00:04:25.930> want<00:04:26.260> to<00:04:26.410> just<00:04:26.560> make<00:04:26.710> sure

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 
down there so you want to just make sure

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:27.960 
down there so you want to just make sure
you're<00:04:26.949> pushing<00:04:27.100> your<00:04:27.310> stake<00:04:27.520> into<00:04:27.760> the<00:04:27.850> earth

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:27.970 
you're pushing your stake into the earth

you're pushing your stake into the earth
not<00:04:28.330> through<00:04:28.570> your<00:04:28.690> tuber<00:04:29.050> I<00:04:29.229> use<00:04:30.389> this<00:04:31.389> green

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:31.660 
not through your tuber I use this green

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:41.270 
not through your tuber I use this green
twine<00:04:37.380> and<00:04:38.490> I<00:04:39.490> tie<00:04:39.699> each<00:04:39.970> some<00:04:40.240> of<00:04:40.389> the<00:04:40.479> plant

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:41.280 
twine and I tie each some of the plant

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:46.469 
twine and I tie each some of the plant
to<00:04:42.280> that<00:04:42.490> stake<00:04:44.699> it's<00:04:45.699> a<00:04:45.760> simple<00:04:46.090> method<00:04:46.419> of

00:04:46.469 --> 00:04:46.479 
to that stake it's a simple method of

to that stake it's a simple method of
tying<00:04:46.720> I<00:04:47.050> go<00:04:47.289> around<00:04:47.410> the<00:04:47.590> stem<00:04:48.000> make<00:04:49.000> a<00:04:49.030> cross

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360 
tying I go around the stem make a cross

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:56.100 
tying I go around the stem make a cross
over<00:04:49.860> of<00:04:50.860> the<00:04:50.979> strings<00:04:51.310> go<00:04:51.610> behind<00:04:52.419> the<00:04:52.510> stake

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:56.110 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:06.510 

we've<00:04:57.110> tried<00:04:57.320> to<00:04:58.960> tie<00:04:59.960> a<00:04:59.990> knot<00:05:00.200> back<00:05:00.500> there

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:09.270 

I<00:05:06.580> will<00:05:07.210> continue<00:05:07.479> to<00:05:07.780> tie<00:05:07.960> in<00:05:08.199> the<00:05:08.229> stems<00:05:08.620> of

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:09.280 
I will continue to tie in the stems of
