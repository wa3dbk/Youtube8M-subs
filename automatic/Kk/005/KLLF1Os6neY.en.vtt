in<00:00:18.300> Delta<00:00:18.690> because<00:00:18.990> it<00:00:19.140> needed<00:00:19.320> a<00:00:19.680> la<00:00:19.859> mota<00:00:20.369> and

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
in Delta because it needed a la mota and

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.599 
in Delta because it needed a la mota and
it's<00:00:21.330> a<00:00:21.510> high<00:00:21.630> go<00:00:21.900> city<00:00:22.199> of<00:00:22.380> full<00:00:22.949> meters<00:00:23.369> and

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
it's a high go city of full meters and

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.609 
it's a high go city of full meters and
to<00:00:24.210> make<00:00:24.390> a<00:00:24.420> papyrus<00:00:24.810> sheet<00:00:24.960> to<00:00:25.260> use<00:00:25.410> the<00:00:25.529> only

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
to make a papyrus sheet to use the only

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.769 
to make a papyrus sheet to use the only
system<00:00:26.010> concept<00:00:26.460> map<00:00:26.670> we<00:00:27.150> cut<00:00:27.330> it<00:00:27.480> will<00:00:27.689> be

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
system concept map we cut it will be

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:36.950 
system concept map we cut it will be
emphasized<00:00:28.320> and

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.470 

as<00:00:37.380> you<00:00:37.620> see<00:00:37.830> this<00:00:37.980> is<00:00:38.160> a<00:00:38.190> powerful<00:00:38.460> system<00:00:38.790> and

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
as you see this is a powerful system and

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.570 
as you see this is a powerful system and
it<00:00:39.930> contained<00:00:40.350> two<00:00:40.410> parts<00:00:40.800> a<00:00:40.890> green<00:00:41.100> part<00:00:41.400> and

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:41.580 
it contained two parts a green part and

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:44.270 
it contained two parts a green part and
the<00:00:41.850> inner<00:00:42.000> part<00:00:42.360> first<00:00:43.200> we'll<00:00:43.620> cut<00:00:43.830> this<00:00:44.010> tree

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
the inner part first we'll cut this tree

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:51.770 
the inner part first we'll cut this tree
part<00:00:46.130> and<00:00:49.310> this<00:00:50.310> is<00:00:50.370> green<00:00:50.730> party<00:00:51.240> so<00:00:51.450> strong

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
part and this is green party so strong

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.440 
part and this is green party so strong
so<00:00:52.470> the<00:00:52.680> ancient<00:00:53.130> Egyptian<00:00:53.700> used<00:00:53.910> it<00:00:54.090> to<00:00:54.300> make

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:54.450 
so the ancient Egyptian used it to make

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:58.010 
so the ancient Egyptian used it to make
pass<00:00:54.750> key<00:00:54.990> codes<00:00:55.320> and<00:00:55.650> sometimes<00:00:56.280> if<00:00:57.090> after

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
pass key codes and sometimes if after

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.800 
pass key codes and sometimes if after
that<00:00:58.260> you<00:00:58.800> can<00:00:59.010> just<00:00:59.220> enter<00:00:59.430> part<00:00:59.880> do<00:01:00.570> step

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:00.810 
that you can just enter part do step

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:12.480 
that you can just enter part do step
slices

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:12.490 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:15.180 

and<00:01:13.120> that<00:01:13.479> center<00:01:13.930> part<00:01:14.170> it's<00:01:14.740> so<00:01:14.890> easy<00:01:15.070> to

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:15.190 
and that center part it's so easy to

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:19.039 
and that center part it's so easy to
freak<00:01:15.549> because<00:01:15.909> it<00:01:16.030> containers<00:01:16.630> come<00:01:16.869> out<00:01:17.909> so

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
freak because it containers come out so

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.640 
freak because it containers come out so
we<00:01:20.049> were<00:01:20.200> related<00:01:20.440> to<00:01:21.690> get<00:01:22.690> the<00:01:22.840> water<00:01:22.990> out<00:01:23.170> and

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:23.650 
we were related to get the water out and

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:30.719 
we were related to get the water out and
make<00:01:23.920> it<00:01:23.950> more<00:01:24.100> clicks<00:01:28.920> after<00:01:29.920> you<00:01:30.220> finish<00:01:30.520> all

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:30.729 
make it more clicks after you finish all

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:32.760 
make it more clicks after you finish all
the<00:01:31.030> slices<00:01:31.270> like<00:01:31.600> that<00:01:31.659> we'll<00:01:32.080> put<00:01:32.290> it<00:01:32.440> into

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
the slices like that we'll put it into

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.700 
the slices like that we'll put it into
pure<00:01:32.979> water<00:01:33.250> for<00:01:33.909> 60<00:01:34.450> days<00:01:34.600> to<00:01:34.869> get<00:01:35.290> the<00:01:35.470> light

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:35.710 
pure water for 60 days to get the light

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:38.790 
pure water for 60 days to get the light
sheet<00:01:35.979> and<00:01:36.190> 12<00:01:36.880> days<00:01:37.180> to<00:01:37.390> get<00:01:37.570> the<00:01:37.720> power<00:01:37.960> okay

sheet and 12 days to get the power okay

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.320 
sheet and 12 days to get the power okay
this<00:01:39.310> is<00:01:39.490> natural<00:01:39.670> water

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:40.330 
this is natural water

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.570 
this is natural water
we<00:01:40.450> don't<00:01:40.659> use<00:01:40.840> any<00:01:41.020> chemical<00:01:41.680> and<00:01:42.009> the

so strong and is to write upon it you

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:22.610 
so strong and is to write upon it you
can<00:02:13.300> feel<00:02:13.510> it

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.750 

that's<00:02:23.430> true

as<00:03:28.520> you<00:03:28.670> see<00:03:28.880> if<00:03:29.120> you<00:03:29.270> would<00:03:29.450> eat<00:03:29.600> the<00:03:29.780> slices

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
as you see if you would eat the slices

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:31.960 
as you see if you would eat the slices
the<00:03:30.800> sheet<00:03:31.010> under<00:03:31.340> the<00:03:31.520> lash

Nancy's a wrestler and presenter once

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:36.370 
Nancy's a wrestler and presenter once
and<00:03:34.280> that's<00:03:34.940> mean<00:03:35.240> it's<00:03:35.390> original<00:03:35.990> ones

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.380 
and that's mean it's original ones

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:40.420 
and that's mean it's original ones
it<00:03:37.720> also<00:03:38.720> the<00:03:39.020> brown<00:03:39.260> one<00:03:39.560> you<00:03:39.680> can<00:03:39.860> see<00:03:40.010> pointy

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
it also the brown one you can see pointy

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:48.600 
it also the brown one you can see pointy
side<00:03:43.120> another<00:03:44.120> side

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:48.610 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:50.490 

that's<00:03:49.180> how<00:03:49.390> it<00:03:49.510> may<00:03:49.630> go<00:03:49.750> by<00:03:50.020> the<00:03:50.080> street<00:03:50.380> to

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
that's how it may go by the street to
