the<00:02:52.220> drawings<00:02:52.670> is<00:02:53.140> depending<00:02:54.140> on<00:02:54.260> the<00:02:54.380> way<00:02:54.500> you

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
the drawings is depending on the way you

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.650 
the drawings is depending on the way you
draw<00:02:54.890> the<00:02:54.950> axe<00:02:55.280> it<00:02:55.580> actually<00:02:56.000> matters<00:02:56.209> in<00:02:56.420> the

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
draw the axe it actually matters in the

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.170 
draw the axe it actually matters in the
gameplay<00:02:56.870> so<00:02:57.440> if<00:02:57.560> I<00:02:57.739> draw<00:02:57.980> a<00:02:58.010> really<00:02:58.430> small<00:02:58.820> axe

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
gameplay so if I draw a really small axe

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.410 
gameplay so if I draw a really small axe
it's<00:02:59.630> actually<00:03:00.350> going<00:03:00.560> to<00:03:01.060> take<00:03:02.060> much<00:03:02.390> longer

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
it's actually going to take much longer

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.130 
it's actually going to take much longer
for<00:03:03.110> me<00:03:03.260> to<00:03:03.500> though<00:03:04.370> that's<00:03:04.670> great

the X lash mushroom yeah it's going to

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.860 
the X lash mushroom yeah it's going to
take<00:03:08.989> much<00:03:09.410> longer<00:03:09.860> for<00:03:10.070> me<00:03:10.250> to<00:03:10.720> hit<00:03:11.720> these

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
take much longer for me to hit these

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.290 
take much longer for me to hit these
rocks<00:03:12.200> let's<00:03:12.620> see<00:03:13.160> how<00:03:13.280> quickly<00:03:13.520> it<00:03:13.730> came<00:03:14.060> down

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:14.300 
rocks let's see how quickly it came down

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:17.199 
rocks let's see how quickly it came down
oh<00:03:14.540> yeah<00:03:14.750> and<00:03:15.050> that's<00:03:15.110> just<00:03:15.350> one<00:03:15.560> example<00:03:16.209> and

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:17.209 
oh yeah and that's just one example and

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:19.870 
oh yeah and that's just one example and
so<00:03:17.810> at<00:03:17.930> this<00:03:18.049> point<00:03:18.350> you'll<00:03:18.980> you<00:03:19.400> know<00:03:19.519> kind<00:03:19.790> of

so at this point you'll you know kind of

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.560 
so at this point you'll you know kind of
be<00:03:20.450> given<00:03:20.780> a<00:03:20.840> task<00:03:21.370> so<00:03:22.370> he's<00:03:22.549> kind<00:03:22.760> of<00:03:22.820> talking

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:23.570 
be given a task so he's kind of talking

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:25.180 
be given a task so he's kind of talking
you<00:03:23.660> through<00:03:23.690> that<00:03:24.140> he<00:03:24.320> needs<00:03:24.530> these<00:03:24.769> jewels
