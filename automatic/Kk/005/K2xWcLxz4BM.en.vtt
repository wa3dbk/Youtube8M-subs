00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:04.210
 yea 

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:07.640
 to play just say that it is a team that will happen but he can either 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:11.670
 finally putting their hands on one of them so eagerly awaited 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.400
 the first thing to notice this modality is marketed where 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:19.220
 is very thin with the whole body in aluminum following the line of macbooks 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:20.539
 pro player 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:23.589
 on the sides you will find very few details as input to 

00:00:23.589 --> 00:00:28.179
 Earphone with microphone On / Off button came in with 

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:33.260
 move on the screen and by talking on its huge subject that plane b with 7 inches 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.710
 comments like 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.110
 the only most important alviverde in augmented version 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.550
 more or less in truth, it is possible to realize that it offers much 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.579
 more than just browsing the internet listening to music or watching movies 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.079
 Tony asks for 680 grams 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:54.390
 she understands how you are going to keep yourself supported by 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:55.550
 one hand 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.980
 You have a few minutes to start thinking it's not so light 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.410
 surf the internet to see photos or something like that until you can be happy with 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:04.350
 just a hand 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:05.980
 just write messages 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:07.310
 instead of typing texts 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:12.040
 the best use position is on a table or bench to be able to use the 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.120
 two hands 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.200
 It's okay that the fourth cd has a processor developed by the 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.980
 apple ball with 1 gigabit speed 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:23.210
 the divine capacity in addition to keeping in secret by the designers of the apparatus 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:27.010
 but most experts risk saying that this memory should spin in 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:30.130
 around 512 megabytes 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.380
 the steering team of 16 32 or 64 gigs 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.560
 these first units have only punishment is more father and we fans 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.490
 concluded but next month the US market has begun to receive 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.670
 those with connection capability 3g 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.810
 coming back to talk a little more about the screen 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.140
 the idea of â€‹â€‹using capacitive technology while their iphones are 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.149
 which are recognized as being of the protocol and are extremely positive 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:01.620
 in guessing the user's intent and giving an immediate response to commands 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:06.110
 and it is precisely there that it will lose points the use experience is very 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.940
 you can hardly find those typical 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.200
 press the screen location and there is no answer 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.200
 browsing the web pages in your house in trancoso 

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:20.809
 texts have a certain learning curve until the 

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:24.040
 user gets used to who I talk about trash but anyway 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.780
 again it is the interaction the pleasant simple use experience 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.610
 intuitive who else is going to have to be so passionate right at the first dick 

00:02:34.179 --> 00:02:38.629
 if you have an iphone to operate mpd it will seem more of the same 

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:43.040
 because they both have the same operating system but even 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.080
 never touched it 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.530
 it is all very simple to reverse the negative trend and credit matheus 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.180
 my eight-year-old nephew in an hour he already knows how to handle everything 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:56.069
 was a little bit about the critical points of this apparatus at first 

00:02:56.889 --> 00:02:58.950
 does not have ability for many talents 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.330
 If you're playing video games, do not just listen to music, but defend. 

00:03:03.149 --> 00:03:07.249
 I was the one who loved doing this, the same happens with other applications but in 

00:03:07.249 --> 00:03:08.040
 compensation 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.460
 This makes it possible for the processor and RAM to 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:14.750
 there is only one task, ie 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:16.530
 he does one thing at a time 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.549
 but at least it does well 

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:23.719
 It is also worth noting that in a short time Apple will launch the West Four 

00:03:23.719 --> 00:03:26.380
 for maikon milk that is already multitasking 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.260
 so it is not hard to expect that soon enough it will also happen with more 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:31.469
 Danger 

00:03:31.469 --> 00:03:35.469
 another criticism kleber has received is that unfortunately it does not perform 

00:03:35.469 --> 00:03:36.529
 flash files 

00:03:36.529 --> 00:03:40.629
 this translates to were example do not present some internet pages 

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:43.049
 with all its functionalities 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:47.589
 if coalitions are sold at the risk of appearing 

00:03:47.589 --> 00:03:49.629
 Blank square on the spot 

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:53.249
 but leaving this aside the device brings an innovative inter party to 

00:03:53.249 --> 00:03:55.169
 reading digital books 

00:03:55.169 --> 00:03:58.909
 As you may have noticed, the attacker does not have the right side for me. 

00:03:58.909 --> 00:04:03.399
 in a plantation wherever you turn up to one did you know what your 

00:04:03.399 --> 00:04:04.419
 position 

00:04:04.419 --> 00:04:07.999
 wendel also takes advantage of that effort from there you can see the list 

00:04:07.999 --> 00:04:10.859
 was a summary of the selected message 

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:14.789
 pointing upright at his message being worried about the earth 

00:04:15.539 --> 00:04:18.669
 Fernandes is cool and has great quality but it's a shame that 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:21.329
 aspect ratio is not 16 by 9 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:25.710
 the 35 ortega image or the placement of bars to keep the original format 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:30.419
 the same applies to my club the resolution can 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:35.710
 720p on a screen biscuit to May offers incredible experience are pictures 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:37.499
 crystalline 

00:04:37.499 --> 00:04:42.019
 but there are still plenty of other applications like traditional itunes for 

00:04:42.019 --> 00:04:43.969
 listen to music contacts calendar 

00:04:43.969 --> 00:04:48.289
 already the ones with sensibility of movements a touch on the screen google map and it gains 

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:51.289
 more functionality when 3g models hit the market 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:57.020
 all the almost 150,000 iphone applications the group will also ask for 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:01.020
 just access the app store only for those that matter most 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:05.720
 pedestrians with this tricolor that would be your version of microsoft office 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:10.569
 programs are easy and simple to use but surprisingly difficult to 

00:05:10.569 --> 00:05:11.770
 make yourself understood 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:15.770
 when you need to save the document made available for use in 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:16.960
 another machine 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:20.210
 as it does not have a place for navigation within the system with a 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:24.069
 director, the only way we 

00:05:24.069 --> 00:05:25.419
 through itunes 

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:29.160
 these crimes but one can imagine that it will soon reward a way of solving 

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:30.159
 that 

00:05:30.159 --> 00:05:33.879
 battery that this side can not be removed from the 

00:05:33.879 --> 00:05:37.129
 we can only say that it lasts exactly 

00:05:37.129 --> 00:05:41.389
 about ten hours of uninterrupted use what is one 

00:05:41.389 --> 00:05:45.139
 device that constantly defends the sentence 

00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:46.449
 impressive 

00:05:46.449 --> 00:05:50.169
 check out more information the product has both the br 

00:05:52.249 --> 00:05:53.479
 these
