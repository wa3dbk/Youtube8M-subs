00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:07.010
 welcome ladies and gentlemen to this 

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.930
 exciting emission 

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:11.660
 I am knoxville and today I present the 

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:14.110
 Did you know that de recsa and the excavator 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:14.110
 empty 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:24.270
 number 1 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:25.930
 reid was designed by big bounce beef 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:27.760
 unfortunately I did not get more 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:30.099
 information about him so he can be 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:32.400
 that straight is the only champion that has 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:32.400
 designed 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.970
 number 2 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:41.610
 really the recsa size is little more 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.040
 big than a house 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.080
 this was changed and they did it a little 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.170
 larger than a human to maintain 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:52.160
 the balance within the game 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.650
 number 3 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:57.620
 for now there are only five 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:01:02.120
 champions born of the vacuum being these 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:04.729
 played with almost warlike and rex there and 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:07.310
 although you can not believe it king if it is 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:11.290
 female which makes it the first 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:14.680
 creature of emptiness that is female 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:17.530
 number 4 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.750
 King is the first champion who does not speak 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:22.690
 just growl that's why he does not have 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:26.260
 benders the second would be bard this 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:28.860
 communicates through melodies number 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.860
 5 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:34.090
 unlike the other champions of the 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:36.070
 empty rec side is not a creature with 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:39.340
 an intelligence comparable to that of a 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:41.590
 human is more like a beast this 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.570
 it could be the reason why it does not have 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.680
 communication method more than those 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:48.970
 grunts 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.970
 number 6 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:54.890
 in its summery aspect we can see how 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:57.409
 using his definitive rex when riding a 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.060
 jet ski to the marked tunnel instead of 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:00.820
 go underground as you would in other 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:04.140
 aspects 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.140
 number 7 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.700
 it is well known by the users that 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.039
 play network side that being low 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.110
 land we can see the vibrations of 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:15.629
 Neutral enemies or monsters 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:19.019
 although we have no vision about these 

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:21.480
 but this detection ability also 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:24.000
 you will share it with your allies or 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:28.370
 they can see the vibrations of the 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.370
 enemies when you use rex eye 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.840
 number 8 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.440
 king is a champion who lived in the 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:38.660
 desert of its rhyme for many 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:41.390
 decades destroying many cities 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:43.430
 during this time thanks to this we 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.530
 we can realize that rex there is the 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:48.210
 creature of the void that has lived the most 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:51.410
 time on a land 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:51.410
 number 9 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:56.220
 something that we can appreciate in the recall 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:59.190
 of summer booking is that the 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:01.080
 Little George Frog This Suicidal Little Frog 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.709
 on the red side of the map that is pulled by 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.709
 an abyss 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.480
 number 10 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:12.620
 pray and is probably inspired by 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:15.440
 the creatures of the movie tremors 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:18.380
 this movie in latin spanish is called 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:20.480
 terror under the earth even this is the 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:23.050
 same name that received the kinematics 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:25.820
 where it appears for the first time recsa and 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:27.830
 On the other hand we can realize 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:32.230
 that has certain similarities with a 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:34.930
 champion canceled this is called humnt 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:37.379
 and until here ends you knew that of 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:37.379
 straight 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.920
 you know that if you liked the video you can 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:46.260

 calm to find here we only have 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:13.780
 What to think as a scam I'm an idiot badger 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:15.290
 and I put mushrooms all day on the bus 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:17.810
