00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:39.140 
thing out like that didn't hurt so I'm

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:42.060 
thing out like that didn't hurt so I'm
seriously<00:04:39.680> considering<00:04:40.040> just<00:04:40.340> getting<00:04:41.300> it

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:42.070 
seriously considering just getting it

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:46.810 
seriously considering just getting it
scalpel<00:04:43.070> instead<00:04:43.490> of<00:04:45.340> industry<00:04:46.340> I<00:04:46.520> don't<00:04:46.730> know

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:46.820 
scalpel instead of industry I don't know

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:48.400 
scalpel instead of industry I don't know
but<00:04:47.030> at<00:04:47.120> the<00:04:47.210> same<00:04:47.390> time<00:04:47.540> I<00:04:47.930> kind<00:04:48.110> of<00:04:48.200> want<00:04:48.350> to

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:48.410 
but at the same time I kind of want to

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:51.100 
but at the same time I kind of want to
continue<00:04:48.770> with<00:04:49.520> binding<00:04:50.000> because<00:04:50.150> it<00:04:50.750> costs

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:51.110 
continue with binding because it costs

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:53.830 
continue with binding because it costs
three<00:04:51.290> hundred<00:04:51.560> dollars<00:04:51.860> to<00:04:52.070> get<00:04:52.190> 10<00:04:52.550> that's<00:04:53.540> a

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:53.840 
three hundred dollars to get 10 that's a

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:58.180 
three hundred dollars to get 10 that's a
lot<00:04:54.290> of<00:04:54.320> money<00:04:54.620> so<00:04:56.290> I<00:04:57.290> don't<00:04:57.560> know<00:04:57.620> comment

00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:58.190
