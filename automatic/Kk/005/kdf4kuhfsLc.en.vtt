00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:11.820
 Tomorrow I am welcome to steffen 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.200
 to a new video magnesium this 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.109
 video I want you just the times 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:19.830
 imagine rocket launcher of the pioneer 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:21.210
 the start makes it loose the mbt the 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.000
 first rocket launcher which it for the 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.039
 pioneer gives and this kind finds 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.900
 actually also his goal if you have something 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.789
 misses it is called I came up 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.689
 The vehicle can have air as well as on the ground 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.149
 be a vehicle 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.579
 and if the rocket flies a bit off 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.670
 actually, she always follows 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.750
 still the goal on the vehicle 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:42.840
 decides even if I directly 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.370
 it always shoots on the end 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.590
 the same place arrive their 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.230
 chain flies so vehicle pulls then 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.850
 mostly upwards and beats up 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.309
 in the vehicle, for example, at 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:56.399
 crawfish and if I eg on the armor so 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.530
 then I do 21 damage it is 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.270
 but pretty much it does not matter if I'm from behind 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.920
 come from the side eventually becomes 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.920
 pull up the rocket shortly before 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.170
 and can do the 21 harm as well 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.900
 the thing also as a local weapon 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.210
 use that is only possible if a goal 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.420
 before with the laser was marked 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.340
 then i can also target with mbt law 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:20.130
 shoot down and your chain will be like that 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.200
 or so then pursue your goal and a 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.299
 meet the next beetle is one way or the other 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.330
 a lock on weapon though is that the 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:29.189
 javelin which can be ground targets or ground 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.350
 better always aim at vehicles 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.509
 and against air targets would have that you 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.400
 you were the target by a laser 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.409
 marked by a pld for example 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.990
 The javelin is against his armor 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.930
 25 damage done me if the tank 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.130
 still marked by a laser 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:45.659
 the damage increases on the next hit 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.030
 he is definitely higher than you do not 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.860
 would use reader and if you with 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.290
 the javelin shoots this logon 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:55.619
 that means I shoot 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:57.659
 must then in the visor of the javelin on 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.579
 otherwise my goal is to fly 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.329
 the travelers namely up and away 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.460
 does not meet anymore 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:05.320
 but then afterwards after after 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.630
 has scored again in the field scored 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.220
 makes the javelin up the air one 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.690
 turn and still be the target 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.870
 You could meet for example in the 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:16.300
 armor even two devils at a time ripe 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:18.459
 daisy pitcher is the apg makes even 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.980
 the highest damage can be at the tank 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:24.310
 from the front so around 23 from the side 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:26.080
 the 34 buzz back around the 55 i 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.060
 say extra about that because there is one 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.280
 difference between the direct 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.320
 hit and son angled if yours 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.370
 chain at a slight angle hits the target 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.890
 then the damage is also 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:38.640
 different from the small 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:41.770
 currently exists in that the apg 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.959
 slower flies and definitely around 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:46.060
 more exactly after the shot with apg can the 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:47.350
 good and happy really makes a nice 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.880
 Pull piece to the left to the right 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:51.070
 which has no straight trajectory and 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.140
 This time, however, has a straight trajectory 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:55.510
 flies stop faster and makes it faster 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.769
 but also always say minimal less 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:58.480
 hurt one notices the difference 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:02:59.860
 really only so you back in 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.320
 skistars the big difference between 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:05.110
 efficiency more weaker this time 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:07.060
 But she is also something for that 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.470
 just a trajectory if you stop to 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:11.320
 example mobile phones wants to complete 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.760
 this time there is something better there 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.140
 the saw 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.880
 this is a rocket you can do in the 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:17.320
 After all, it is still like steering 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:19.420
 a kind the four come out of bed the 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:21.730
 two or just such a theory 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.410
 lounges or ski and can in 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.320
 afterwards, by moving my mouse 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:28.120
 is control stick I can still do that 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:30.730
 the orbit of the rocket change something and 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:32.739
 so even my committee to correct 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:35.500
 but remember it when I shoot 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:37.239
 and then the cranes will be the trajectory of the 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.640
 rocket is still changing and can 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:41.769
 So good and like to be that I turn 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:43.120
 me away from the tank and suddenly 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:44.380
 the rocket also turns away and 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.190
 it does not really work anymore you always have to 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:48.130
 pay a little attention 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:50.560
 the damage the fc rw is about 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:52.750
 same with the smart and the srg can 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.850
 be marked laser but is 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.750
 synonymous only if just 1 pld to 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:56.320
 Example used for a vehicle 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:58.720
 has been 

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:00.160
 then you can also sew as a kind 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.019
 lures and use weapon 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:04.140
 the next rocket launcher is the sticker 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:07.570
 the side attract weapon opposite 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:08.590
 Aircraft and you can shoot 

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:10.690
 and in the process 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:12.549
 then just turn away that will 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:14.350
 still find your goal at the end 

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:16.870
 which does a little less harm than in the 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:18.310
 battlefield 3 but ensures at all 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:21.530
 for son 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:24.560
 mobility is the name of the rotor, for example 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:26.000
 of the helicopter skips short and too 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:27.830
 if that does less harm if 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.530
 stop the rotor of the helicopter touches down 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:32.660
 he can do that against a guy somewhere 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:34.610
 crack and break the ehcler 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:37.190
 does a little more harm than this 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:39.320
 but has the disadvantage that you on 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:40.640
 I have to stay on top of that too 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:43.010
 so i have to shoot it off im 

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:44.780
 Stay tuned and continue to be mine 

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:46.940
 helicopter my plane which goal 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:48.230
 keep pursuing it, too 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:49.400
 Stop it for the damage 

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:52.130
 just a little bit higher 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:54.380
 yes these were the seven selectable ones 

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:55.550
 rocket launcher of the pioneer, hopefully 

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:57.620
 did you like the video? 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:59.150
 twitter as well as facebook links 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:00.350
 her description in the car she still 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:01.760
 I'll give you two more videos 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:05.050
 can recommend and see you at 

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:05.050
 this video hides three people
