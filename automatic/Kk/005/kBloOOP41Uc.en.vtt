on<00:02:20.960> I<00:02:21.230> don't<00:02:21.380> think<00:02:21.470> that<00:02:21.650> it<00:02:21.980> is<00:02:22.040> addictive<00:02:22.820> if

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:23.270 
on I don't think that it is addictive if

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:25.030 
on I don't think that it is addictive if
you're<00:02:23.480> on<00:02:23.600> every<00:02:23.930> day<00:02:24.080> it<00:02:24.290> just<00:02:24.320> depends<00:02:24.920> on

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
you're on every day it just depends on

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.520 
you're on every day it just depends on
how<00:02:25.220> long<00:02:25.490> you're<00:02:25.760> on<00:02:25.910> it<00:02:26.180> on<00:02:26.420> youtube<00:02:27.290> every

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
how long you're on it on youtube every

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.790 
how long you're on it on youtube every
day<00:02:27.800> and<00:02:28.090> yeah<00:02:29.090> I<00:02:29.450> guess<00:02:29.750> it<00:02:29.930> can<00:02:30.140> be<00:02:30.320> addictive

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:30.800 
day and yeah I guess it can be addictive

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.130 
day and yeah I guess it can be addictive
and<00:02:31.040> if<00:02:31.459> anyone<00:02:31.790> does<00:02:32.180> take<00:02:32.450> it<00:02:32.600> to<00:02:32.720> that<00:02:32.750> point

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
and if anyone does take it to that point

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:36.310 
and if anyone does take it to that point
where<00:02:33.350> they're<00:02:34.130> constantly<00:02:34.760> on<00:02:35.150> like<00:02:35.570> like<00:02:36.200> I

thought of this because we're actually
watching<00:02:54.769> a<00:02:55.040> short<00:02:55.310> film<00:02:55.550> on<00:02:55.760> our<00:02:56.660> in<00:02:56.959> class<00:02:57.260> in

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
basically how social media took over

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.150 
basically how social media took over
