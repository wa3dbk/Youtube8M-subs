mechanics<00:01:24.360> Bob<00:01:24.869> me<00:01:25.530> definitely<00:01:26.450> has<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.479> key

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
mechanics Bob me definitely has the key

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.830 
mechanics Bob me definitely has the key

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
to the entrance to address city to go

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.780 
to the entrance to address city to go
from<00:01:31.020> this<00:01:31.140> facility<00:01:31.290> to<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:31.829> city<00:01:32.040> is<00:01:32.310> good

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
from this facility to the city is good

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.850 
from this facility to the city is good

so<00:01:35.840> basically<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:36.990> mechanics<00:01:37.350> are<00:01:37.409> getting

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
so basically the mechanics are getting

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.219 
so basically the mechanics are getting
fixed<00:01:37.829> the<00:01:37.890> reactor<00:01:38.250> got<00:01:38.759> turned<00:01:39.329> into<00:01:39.450> plant

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
fixed the reactor got turned into plant

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.289 
fixed the reactor got turned into plant
food<00:01:40.350> no<00:01:41.009> not<00:01:41.159> plan<00:01:41.369> for<00:01:41.400> that<00:01:41.670> was<00:01:41.790> stupid

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
food no not plan for that was stupid

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.999 
food no not plan for that was stupid
dinosaur<00:01:43.110> food<00:01:44.869> probably<00:01:45.869> by<00:01:46.049> Nessie<00:01:46.530> maybe

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
dinosaur food probably by Nessie maybe

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:54.620 
dinosaur food probably by Nessie maybe
something<00:01:47.310> bigger<00:01:47.610> um<00:01:51.500> now<00:01:52.500> first<00:01:52.860> shop<00:01:53.630> or

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
something bigger um now first shop or

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.770 
something bigger um now first shop or
maybe<00:01:54.899> maybe<00:01:55.079> small<00:01:55.350> what's<00:01:55.920> new<00:01:56.540> missile<00:01:57.540> pod

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
maybe maybe small what's new missile pod

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.730 
maybe maybe small what's new missile pod

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.660 
double manhunt single men hand
single-handed<00:02:01.740> it's<00:02:02.729> a<00:02:02.909> heavy<00:02:03.180> machine<00:02:03.659> gun

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
single-handed it's a heavy machine gun

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.660 
single-handed it's a heavy machine gun
what<00:02:05.670> they<00:02:05.759> do<00:02:05.850> cost<00:02:06.090> a<00:02:06.210> lot<00:02:06.329> suppose<00:02:07.670> recovery

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
what they do cost a lot suppose recovery

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.820 
what they do cost a lot suppose recovery
what<00:02:08.970> more<00:02:09.119> like<00:02:09.270> I<00:02:12.020> don't<00:02:13.020> have<00:02:13.200> any

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
what more like I don't have any

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:21.880 
what more like I don't have any
that's<00:02:14.010> why<00:02:14.790> not<00:02:15.470> nope<00:02:16.470> I<00:02:16.620> guess<00:02:16.830> yes<00:02:19.460> magazine

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
that's why not nope I guess yes magazine

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:29.810 
that's why not nope I guess yes magazine
charge<00:02:22.890> it<00:02:23.130> let's<00:02:24.120> put<00:02:24.330> it<00:02:24.420> on<00:02:24.510> my<00:02:24.570> tab<00:02:28.820> tools

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
charge it let's put it on my tab tools

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.480 
charge it let's put it on my tab tools
or<00:02:30.540> what's<00:02:30.780> that<00:02:30.930> a<00:02:31.200> power<00:02:31.710> battery<00:02:32.130> or<00:02:32.280> what's

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.490 
or what's that a power battery or what's

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:40.040 
or what's that a power battery or what's
that<00:02:33.260> ApS<00:02:34.260> a<00:02:34.440> look<00:02:34.560> at<00:02:37.220> what's<00:02:38.220> that<00:02:39.050> power

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
that ApS a look at what's that power

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:41.630 
that ApS a look at what's that power
during<00:02:40.590> the<00:02:40.710> stun<00:02:40.920> gun<00:02:41.130> who<00:02:41.280> wants<00:02:41.490> one<00:02:41.610> of

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
during the stun gun who wants one of

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.010 
during the stun gun who wants one of
them<00:02:41.910> I<00:02:43.580> easy<00:02:44.580> it's<00:02:44.790> one<00:02:44.970> stun<00:02:45.660> gun<00:02:45.870> upgrades

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020 
them I easy it's one stun gun upgrades

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:49.700 
them I easy it's one stun gun upgrades
like<00:02:46.470> rubbish<00:02:46.920> I<00:02:47.160> mean<00:02:47.280> machete<00:02:47.670> yeah<00:02:48.620> but<00:02:49.620> the

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:49.710 
like rubbish I mean machete yeah but the

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:52.970 
like rubbish I mean machete yeah but the
stupid<00:02:50.010> song<00:02:50.310> and<00:02:50.490> do<00:02:50.850> anything<00:02:51.800> right<00:02:52.800> so

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
stupid song and do anything right so

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.220
