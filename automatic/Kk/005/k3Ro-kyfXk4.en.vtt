 hello everyone 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:11.360
 lovers of knife topics here I want 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:16.830
 talk a little bit about key chains 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:19.230
 made these calls metal exists 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.760
 such an opinion that the knife is made of 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:26.939
 cutting file 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:30.359
 rust quickly does not hold very bad 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:33.140
 cutting edge well and doubt how 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.850
 says wrong 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:40.920
 distinguishable to prepare a knife from his file 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:45.840
 you need to properly thermal treat as 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:47.740
 I do this I take the old gardens flat 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.890
 files 

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:53.340
 first we make vacation then 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:56.310
 previously 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:01:00.610
 honing but do I deduce form 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:05.170
 pre-do down Perry 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:08.740
 stabbing hardness 5089 units 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:11.400
 order and further processing of psychol to 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.400
 polishing 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:15.880
 But with such a follower all 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:18.810
 processing 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:23.740
 but getting pretty strong 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:25.050
 keeps the blade well polished 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:32.780
 knife 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:36.540
 not so corrosive of course 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:38.580
 preferably done on the type of carazin and 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:43.530
 cover not which form one 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:45.930
 have the opportunity to do the blueing 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:49.670
 various chemical ladies ways 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:51.870

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:15.210
 cheaper more expensive 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:19.170
 applied to the metal is obtained as it were 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:22.130
 inventory for metal goes it pretty 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.130
 goes deep 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:30.120
 metal passes far and very long 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:33.150
