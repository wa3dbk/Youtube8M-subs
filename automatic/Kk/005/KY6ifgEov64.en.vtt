why I just don't like it so I always

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.330 
why I just don't like it so I always
like<00:00:51.809> to<00:00:51.930> leave<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.230> laces<00:00:52.530> hanging<00:00:53.010> out<00:00:53.100> so<00:00:53.280> I

like to leave the laces hanging out so I

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.189 
like to leave the laces hanging out so I
kind<00:00:53.550> of<00:00:53.610> like<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:53.940> way<00:00:54.090> I<00:00:54.360> have<00:00:54.870> them<00:00:55.020> hanging

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
kind of like the way I have them hanging

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.439 
kind of like the way I have them hanging
out<00:00:55.379> almost<00:00:55.590> like<00:00:55.770> my<00:00:56.010> Paden<00:00:56.430> folds<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:57.270> lace

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
steps kind of hang out in front I think

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.340 
steps kind of hang out in front I think
that<00:00:58.920> adds<00:00:59.100> a<00:00:59.280> little<00:00:59.399> touch<00:00:59.730> but<00:01:00.329> overall<00:01:00.870> I

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
that adds a little touch but overall I

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.619 
that adds a little touch but overall I
really<00:01:02.280> like<00:01:02.430> this<00:01:02.579> black<00:01:02.850> colorway<00:01:03.239> that
