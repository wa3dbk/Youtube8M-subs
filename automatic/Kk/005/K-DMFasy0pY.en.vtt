00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:10.900
 hello, I am vittorio di dio the focaccia 

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:12.370
 blog with video recipes 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:15.070
 makes bread 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:17.170
 at home today we continue the series of 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:18.939
 video dedicated to baking bread 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:20.590
 of the pizza focaccia in the oven a 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:23.590
 alpha wood pizza 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:26.200
 today I propose a recipe for making the 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:29.759
 bread ciabatta in less than two hours 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.759
 cooked in a wood oven 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:39.150
 choose the yeast in the water 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:42.540
 environment we add pumpkin or honey e 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:56.160
 we mix add three quarters of the 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:57.780
 flour and begin to stir after 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.290
 not even a minute when the flour 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.730
 absorbed we add the salt in this 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:04.010
 so the salt comes into direct contact with it 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.410
 with yeast 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:11.369
 we love salt 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:15.509
 now we add the remaining flour e 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:17.910
 we resume mixing after two minutes 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.890
 you don't even see the flour is absorbed 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:21.600
 this is the very hydrated dough not 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.490
 need to knead it a lot because then the 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.340
 gluten develops during 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.259
 leavening now we discover the 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.270
 we put in a place far from 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.130
 drafts to rise 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:34.380
 I especially put my own in winter 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.940
 leavened meals in the oven off with 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.080
 the light on that had no temperature 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.080
 plus or minus 30 degrees 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:54.640
 we light an oven making a pyre of 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:02:03.490
 paper and small wood we are waiting for 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:06.100
 two thirds big seats above a few 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.780
 second there is a beautiful flame 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.550
 now we add other pieces that 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:13.000
 will be used to create the embers and then 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:14.530
 will be the one that bakes the bread a 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.540
 difference when you can if the pizza 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.549
 where there is still a living flame is needed 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.299
 to keep the bottom on 400 degrees for 

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:22.450
 to bake bread 

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:25.000
 heat well in the oven maybe on the 250 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.799
 300 degrees and then we create the embers 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.650
 let it cool down more or 

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:31.569
 less on the 200 220 and then we bake the bread 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:34.870
 without a living flame otherwise it burns 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:37.569
 after a few minutes in the oven at 300 degrees 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.940
 now we put the oven door 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:42.250
 in front so leaving space to enter 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.680
 air is the oxygen to feed the 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.060
 flame is that the smoke can pass the 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.160
 cane in this way 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.690
 we keep heat and carry it in 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.519
 temperature while embers form 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:53.650
 look at the oven after twenty minutes e 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:55.930
 very hot 500 degrees the ideal now 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:58.780
 it would move the embers do two three 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:00.070
 pizzas and then let it cool to make 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.140
 bread today as we do alone 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:03.970
 urban we opened the door like this 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:06.430
 let's start to let it cool a little while 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:08.320
 the embers continue to form now 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:15.010
 we find the embers from the center of forio la 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:16.930
 we move to one side there is no more firm 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:18.280
 alive in the oven but still too much 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.140
 hot we let it go down a little longer 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.420
 of temperature in the meantime we put 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:24.579
 little pot of water in fashion hold 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:26.609
 the most humid environment is the wood-burning oven 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:28.780
 tends to be a very dry environment 

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:30.069
 when we bake important bread 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.840
 put a saucepan of boiling water 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:34.030
 some even within the later expelled 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.220
 water vaporized to increase the grade 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:37.690
 of humidity during the beginning of the phase 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:39.700
 initial of cooking 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:41.590
 this means that the 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.150
 carbon dioxide crust 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:45.549
 inside the dough has the 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:47.739
 possibility to expand with heat vi 

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:50.340
 grow bread and you will get a 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:50.340
 fantastic result 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:55.160
 the mixture of this joy and much 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:57.110
 hydrated so very sticky 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:59.200
 then I'll show you a trick for 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:03.280
 handle the dough without touching it 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.280
 forced water on the work table 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:08.569
 then put a strip of 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:09.920
 transparent film 

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:13.730
 as the table when wet 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:17.829
 the transparent apricaia does not slip now 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:21.260
 let's put another one next to it now 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:24.200
 sprinkle the surface of the film 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:26.930
 well evenly with flour 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:28.389
 here is the beautiful uniform flour on 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:31.160
 transparent film 

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:33.830
 look at how it grew after more or less 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:36.139
 90 minutes if the environment is colder 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:38.030
 you have to let it rise until when 

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:39.380
 not nearly tripled at least volume 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:42.169
 doubles in volume 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:43.520
 now spilled pasta making 

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:48.590
 be careful that it does not fold back on itself 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:50.060
 same detaching it with a spatula more 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:53.479
 important that we do not know itself 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:56.300
 otherwise it depends too strong not 

00:04:53.479 --> 00:04:59.020
 ethics at the center of the film 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:59.020
 transparent 

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:06.890
 Now the huge sale place 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:09.200
 attacks on trusted hands a form more 

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:11.210
 already beaten so walks to the account 

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:15.500
 above that if they don't come it wants too much 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:18.229
 big here is now prepare a pan 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:22.010
 with the selas oven paper sprinkle with 

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:24.950
 polenta africa the turkish besides avoiding 

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:26.990
 what relationship is attached to the pan does 

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:30.530
 so that it remains an air cushion 

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:32.600
 below that cooks it better is not 

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:34.490
 been saying that excess flour are 

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:37.220
 a lighthouse dried up to reuse it 

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:39.470
 since we are from Genoa take the 

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:41.710
 ciabatta and in one blow you have to 

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:45.020
 overturn on the baking sheet 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:48.200
 Now I adjusted a little form so 

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:50.479
 so that the form ty and Saturday 

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:52.280
 come back immediately and the oven has fallen 

00:05:50.479 --> 00:05:55.720
 more or less 220 than the temperature 

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:55.720
 right to bake this bread 

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:01.930
 we are a little bit 

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:06.820
 of water to create more steam e 

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:09.790
 let's fire away from the embers then 

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:12.760
 we always close the door leaving a 

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:14.919
 little space otherwise everything remains 

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:17.200
 smoked if by chance the bread comes 

00:06:14.919 --> 00:06:18.850
 too much color because the bottom is too much 

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:20.980
 hot you can put a paper price 

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:21.630
 foil above to protect the 

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:23.710
 surface 

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:26.290
 look where ten minutes like cabbage 

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:29.410
 grilled there again with the saucepan 

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:31.510
 of water but without flame we hope the 

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:34.030
 door ajar otherwise I will 

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:37.210
 cools too much the bottom has settled 

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:39.070
 just above 200 grams always leads 

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:42.850
 ajar 

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:46.050
 about halfway through cooking do and do 

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:50.169
 so that it is received evenly 

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:52.419
 and here our fantastic is there 

00:06:50.169 --> 00:06:54.580
 batta cooked in a wood oven you see 

00:06:52.419 --> 00:06:57.610
 how beautiful empty really inside 

00:06:54.580 --> 00:07:05.790
 show we do the cutting test 

00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:05.790
 to see the relative torino that does 

00:07:08.309 --> 00:07:14.830
 wow beautiful beautiful adventure 

00:07:12.809 --> 00:07:16.569
 clearly with a leavening 

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:19.419
 fast enough it has no bubbles 

00:07:16.569 --> 00:07:21.699
 very big but respectable 

00:07:19.419 --> 00:07:23.080
 I recommend you always cool down 

00:07:21.699 --> 00:07:26.110
 the bread on a grill so that 

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:28.059
 air passed around and moisture not 

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:30.039
 it made me die one came 

00:07:28.059 --> 00:07:33.309
 fantastic ciabatta are right 

00:07:30.039 --> 00:07:35.080
 pleased he has an exceptional fragrance 

00:07:33.309 --> 00:07:37.210
 See you for the next recipe 

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:39.719
 on my blog viva the focaccia dot com 

00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:39.719
 Hello
