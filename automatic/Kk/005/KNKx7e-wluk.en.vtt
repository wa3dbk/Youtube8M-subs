00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.270
 the temperature changes associated with 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:08.519
 The child's natural phenomenon is the cause 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.410
 of the unusual penetration of the sea in 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:14.860
 low areas of the Pacific coasts 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:17.020
 as it happens in put it already and the peñitas 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:18.850
 the strong waves recorded starting 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:20.619
 of the weekend have caused the 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:22.930
 destruction of ramadas and part of the 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:24.759
 square imposes the today to the commune 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:26.800
 Leon is already filling with 

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:29.560
 select material volcanic damage 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:32.460
 caused in the retaining wall part 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.460
 of nature 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:44.110
 the 13 here right now the tides are 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.120
 the danger of too who 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:49.480
 put it and this side 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:52.190
 the tide are high and there is a current 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:54.969
 how dangerous it is to go 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.969
 and that's out there 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:03.040
 you do not tell the canvas 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.830
 You have never really seen this but 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.690
 nowadays good has to meet the 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:09.729
 Word of God that says that the sea 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:11.700
 will recover what is yours your time 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:14.350
 the same here 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.810
 this mitigation 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.460
 close 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.860
 commonly as it is told in these 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.570
 bumps and also we are also 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.460
 filling with select material 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.840
 volcanic the diskette was damaged 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.450
 product of 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.640
 or those that commonly do not exist I do not know 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:33.009
 the civil defense authorities 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:35.350
 provide some recommendations for 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:37.360
 population and fishermen in the unit 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.340
 it is ending now by the tide 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.310
 how high today is precisely the 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:44.590
 last day half tide of 88 and peak 8 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:47.289
 stone and then that comes also going to 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:49.810
 increase the strong waves in addition to the 

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:51.909
 winds that I tank that I know 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:54.039
 they associate or the swell occurs but if 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:56.049
 is within the framework of normal is not 

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:57.490
 nothing extraordinary simple simply 

00:01:56.049 --> 00:02:00.369
 as I tell you about a tide that is 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.689
 within periods of high tide 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:04.630
 so far has not registered 

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:06.549
 no human harm according to the ineter these 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.049
 events will increase for their part the 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:10.539
 authorities of the lion department 

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:13.390
 will be aware of the waves in the 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:18.060
 costs to put it already and the peñitas from 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:18.060
 lion to you more back only that you live
