mounts so now the question is where when
I<00:02:22.549> might<00:02:22.790> consider<00:02:23.239> and<00:02:23.599> how<00:02:23.629> might<00:02:24.439> I<00:02:24.469> want<00:02:24.739> to

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
I might consider and how might I want to

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.920 
I might consider and how might I want to

extension kit or faceplate right we

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:03.339 
extension kit or faceplate right we
might<00:03:01.700> want<00:03:01.879> to<00:03:01.939> consider<00:03:02.060> a<00:03:02.540> vertical<00:03:02.900> mount

00:03:03.339 --> 00:03:03.349 
might want to consider a vertical mount

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:05.619 
might want to consider a vertical mount
right<00:03:03.620> next<00:03:04.040> to<00:03:04.129> it<00:03:04.159> so<00:03:04.459> we<00:03:04.579> can<00:03:04.760> actually<00:03:04.879> do

00:03:05.619 --> 00:03:05.629 
right next to it so we can actually do

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:07.899 
right next to it so we can actually do
the<00:03:05.810> power<00:03:05.989> connections<00:03:06.560> and<00:03:06.709> snake<00:03:07.579> all<00:03:07.819> the

00:03:07.899 --> 00:03:07.909 
the power connections and snake all the

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:11.199 
the power connections and snake all the
component<00:03:08.419> cables<00:03:08.719> inside<00:03:09.620> the<00:03:09.799> wall<00:03:10.040> if<00:03:10.849> not

component cables inside the wall if not

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:14.409 
component cables inside the wall if not
a<00:03:11.540> nice<00:03:12.409> clean<00:03:12.829> horizontal<00:03:13.730> mount<00:03:13.939> might<00:03:14.180> work

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:14.419 
a nice clean horizontal mount might work

00:03:14.419 --> 00:03:16.509 
a nice clean horizontal mount might work
as<00:03:14.599> well<00:03:14.840> so<00:03:15.109> I'm<00:03:15.709> just<00:03:15.889> giving<00:03:16.219> you<00:03:16.310> these

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:16.519 
as well so I'm just giving you these

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:18.879 
as well so I'm just giving you these
four<00:03:17.030> ideas<00:03:17.569> as<00:03:17.870> to<00:03:17.930> when<00:03:18.319> you're<00:03:18.560> doing<00:03:18.859> your

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:18.889 
four ideas as to when you're doing your

00:03:18.889 --> 00:03:22.659 
four ideas as to when you're doing your
installation<00:03:19.790> now<00:03:20.409> very<00:03:21.409> simply<00:03:21.859> you're

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:22.669 
installation now very simply you're

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:24.240 
installation now very simply you're
going<00:03:22.849> to<00:03:22.909> be<00:03:23.030> cutting<00:03:23.419> the<00:03:23.540> hole<00:03:23.720> in<00:03:23.870> the<00:03:23.959> wall

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
going to be cutting the hole in the wall

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.319 
going to be cutting the hole in the wall
you're<00:03:25.250> going<00:03:25.370> to<00:03:25.459> be<00:03:25.549> using<00:03:25.970> so<00:03:26.209> it's

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:26.329 
you're going to be using so it's

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:27.969 
you're going to be using so it's
included<00:03:26.690> in<00:03:26.900> the<00:03:26.989> kit<00:03:27.409> which<00:03:27.650> is<00:03:27.799> your

00:03:27.969 --> 00:03:27.979 
included in the kit which is your

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:31.210 
included in the kit which is your
electrical<00:03:28.400> monkey<00:03:28.699> boxes<00:03:29.349> your<00:03:30.349> six<00:03:30.709> feet<00:03:31.040> of

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
electrical monkey boxes your six feet of

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:34.830 
electrical monkey boxes your six feet of
romics<00:03:31.760> cable<00:03:32.949> connect<00:03:33.949> it<00:03:34.069> down<00:03:34.220> to<00:03:34.400> the<00:03:34.489> base

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
romics cable connect it down to the base

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:39.729 
romics cable connect it down to the base
so<00:03:35.840> if<00:03:35.900> we<00:03:35.989> take<00:03:36.169> a<00:03:36.229> look<00:03:36.439> at<00:03:36.620> the<00:03:36.739> base<00:03:38.560> we<00:03:39.560> have

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:39.739 
so if we take a look at the base we have

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:41.800 
so if we take a look at the base we have
our<00:03:39.919> secondary<00:03:40.459> faceplate<00:03:41.150> that<00:03:41.389> we<00:03:41.510> mount

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:41.810 
our secondary faceplate that we mount

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:44.530 
our secondary faceplate that we mount
and<00:03:42.019> in<00:03:42.109> this<00:03:42.229> instance<00:03:42.470> I<00:03:43.000> would<00:03:44.000> probably

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
and in this instance I would probably

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:48.550 
and in this instance I would probably
choose<00:03:44.750> to<00:03:44.810> mount<00:03:45.109> it<00:03:46.000> horizontally<00:03:47.290> the<00:03:48.290> last

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 
choose to mount it horizontally the last

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.839 
choose to mount it horizontally the last
and<00:03:48.829> final<00:03:49.009> stage<00:03:49.519> is<00:03:50.079> your<00:03:51.079> simple<00:03:51.849> your

00:03:52.839 --> 00:03:52.849 
and final stage is your simple your

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:55.629 
and final stage is your simple your
power<00:03:53.060> cable<00:03:53.590> simply<00:03:54.590> connect<00:03:55.009> it<00:03:55.189> once<00:03:55.430> it's

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:55.639 
power cable simply connect it once it's

00:03:55.639 --> 00:03:58.390 
power cable simply connect it once it's
mounted<00:03:55.790> on<00:03:56.150> the<00:03:56.540> wall<00:03:56.919> now<00:03:57.919> keep<00:03:58.220> in<00:03:58.370> mind
