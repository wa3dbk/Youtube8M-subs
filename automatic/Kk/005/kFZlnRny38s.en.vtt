so<00:00:10.210> here<00:00:10.570> we<00:00:10.690> are<00:00:10.719> again<00:00:11.080> on<00:00:11.110> the<00:00:11.469> site<00:00:11.679> of<00:00:11.830> the

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:11.920 
so here we are again on the site of the

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:14.490 
so here we are again on the site of the
geologic<00:00:12.490> prototype<00:00:13.059> last<00:00:14.019> time<00:00:14.230> we<00:00:14.379> were

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:14.500 
geologic prototype last time we were

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.710 
geologic prototype last time we were
here<00:00:14.830> we<00:00:15.010> were<00:00:15.039> pouring<00:00:15.430> concrete<00:00:15.580> in<00:00:16.450> our

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:16.720 
here we were pouring concrete in our

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.010 
here we were pouring concrete in our
footings<00:00:17.259> and<00:00:17.610> since<00:00:18.610> then<00:00:18.939> we<00:00:19.210> have<00:00:19.480> filled

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:20.020 
footings and since then we have filled

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.220 
footings and since then we have filled
in<00:00:20.200> the<00:00:20.259> inside<00:00:20.830> of<00:00:21.279> the<00:00:21.580> footings<00:00:21.939> with

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
in the inside of the footings with

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.370 
in the inside of the footings with
gravel<00:00:23.230> and<00:00:23.820> now<00:00:24.820> we<00:00:24.880> are<00:00:25.330> going<00:00:25.689> vertical<00:00:26.170> and

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:26.380 
gravel and now we are going vertical and

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:28.800 
gravel and now we are going vertical and
to<00:00:27.220> do<00:00:27.369> that<00:00:27.550> we<00:00:27.730> are<00:00:27.880> using<00:00:28.060> some<00:00:28.390> locally

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:28.810 
to do that we are using some locally

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.499 
to do that we are using some locally
sawn<00:00:29.109> and<00:00:29.560> harvested<00:00:30.429> Timbers<00:00:30.880> some<00:00:31.330> white

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:31.509 
sawn and harvested Timbers some white

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:33.540 
sawn and harvested Timbers some white
pine<00:00:31.779> timbers<00:00:32.290> that<00:00:32.980> are<00:00:33.070> going<00:00:33.160> to<00:00:33.220> form<00:00:33.460> the

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:33.550 
pine timbers that are going to form the

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:35.970 
pine timbers that are going to form the
timber<00:00:33.940> frame<00:00:34.210> for<00:00:34.839> the<00:00:34.960> building<00:00:35.290> that<00:00:35.830> will

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:35.980 
timber frame for the building that will

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.520 
timber frame for the building that will
hold<00:00:36.129> all<00:00:36.309> the<00:00:36.640> load-bearing<00:00:37.570> structure<00:00:38.290> and

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:38.530 
hold all the load-bearing structure and

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.280 
hold all the load-bearing structure and
that's<00:00:39.370> what's<00:00:39.550> going<00:00:39.760> on<00:00:39.879> behind<00:00:40.239> us<00:00:40.390> and<00:00:40.629> we

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:41.290 
that's what's going on behind us and we

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:43.979 
that's what's going on behind us and we
can<00:00:41.409> get<00:00:41.530> a<00:00:41.559> little<00:00:41.799> closer<00:00:42.100> and<00:00:42.659> see<00:00:43.659> some<00:00:43.900> of

00:00:43.979 --> 00:00:43.989 
can get a little closer and see some of

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:46.049 
can get a little closer and see some of
the<00:00:44.049> details<00:00:44.350> so<00:00:45.190> last<00:00:45.519> time<00:00:45.670> we<00:00:45.820> were<00:00:45.909> here

00:00:46.049 --> 00:00:46.059 
the details so last time we were here

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:48.930 
the details so last time we were here
we're<00:00:46.269> placing<00:00:46.750> concrete<00:00:47.440> into<00:00:48.159> this<00:00:48.339> footing

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:48.940 
we're placing concrete into this footing

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.270 
we're placing concrete into this footing
here<00:00:49.180> which<00:00:49.360> is<00:00:49.479> like<00:00:49.690> a<00:00:49.720> big<00:00:49.960> grade<00:00:50.619> beam<00:00:50.920> and

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:51.280 
here which is like a big grade beam and

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.079 
here which is like a big grade beam and
we've<00:00:51.940> done<00:00:52.180> that<00:00:52.420> and<00:00:53.339> then<00:00:54.339> we<00:00:54.519> put<00:00:54.760> on<00:00:54.909> the

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:55.089 
we've done that and then we put on the

00:00:55.089 --> 00:00:57.960 
we've done that and then we put on the
mud<00:00:55.269> sill<00:00:55.540> here<00:00:56.400> pressure-treated<00:00:57.400> and<00:00:57.850> then

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:57.970 
mud sill here pressure-treated and then

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:01.049 
mud sill here pressure-treated and then
a<00:00:58.000> second<00:00:58.479> plate<00:00:59.470> here<00:00:59.890> which<00:01:00.100> we'll<00:01:00.339> use<00:01:00.820> to

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:01.059 
a second plate here which we'll use to

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:04.049 
a second plate here which we'll use to
attach<00:01:01.510> the<00:01:02.290> structural<00:01:03.220> insulated<00:01:03.489> panels

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:04.059 
attach the structural insulated panels

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:07.109 
attach the structural insulated panels
to<00:01:04.269> there<00:01:04.540> out<00:01:04.689> in<00:01:04.869> this<00:01:05.019> plane<00:01:05.379> and<00:01:06.130> we<00:01:06.880> have

00:01:07.109 --> 00:01:07.119 
to there out in this plane and we have

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:10.950 
to there out in this plane and we have
here<00:01:07.810> the<00:01:08.260> Timbers<00:01:08.710> that<00:01:09.210> are<00:01:10.210> the<00:01:10.570> locally

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:10.960 
here the Timbers that are the locally

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.130 
here the Timbers that are the locally
sawn<00:01:11.260> and<00:01:11.740> planed<00:01:12.310> white<00:01:12.700> pine<00:01:13.140> native

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:14.140 
sawn and planed white pine native

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.719 
sawn and planed white pine native
species<00:01:14.439> come<00:01:15.310> came<00:01:15.850> from<00:01:16.149> Oh<00:01:17.219> 15<00:01:18.219> miles<00:01:18.460> away

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:18.729 
species come came from Oh 15 miles away

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:21.690 
species come came from Oh 15 miles away
from<00:01:18.789> here<00:01:19.210> and<00:01:19.679> it's<00:01:20.679> a<00:01:20.740> very<00:01:20.920> simple<00:01:21.219> timber

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:21.700 
from here and it's a very simple timber

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.849 
from here and it's a very simple timber
frame<00:01:22.000> we're<00:01:22.750> not<00:01:22.899> doing<00:01:23.320> traditional

00:01:23.849 --> 00:01:23.859 
frame we're not doing traditional

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:27.239 
frame we're not doing traditional
joinery<00:01:24.609> we're<00:01:25.030> doing<00:01:25.329> basically<00:01:25.950> bolts<00:01:26.950> and

00:01:27.239 --> 00:01:27.249 
joinery we're doing basically bolts and

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:29.340 
joinery we're doing basically bolts and
plates<00:01:27.520> to<00:01:27.939> hold<00:01:28.119> it<00:01:28.270> together<00:01:28.600> which<00:01:29.049> saves

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:29.350 
plates to hold it together which saves

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.730 
plates to hold it together which saves
time<00:01:29.710> but<00:01:30.490> it<00:01:30.999> still<00:01:31.149> will<00:01:32.079> look<00:01:32.289> really<00:01:32.469> nice

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:32.740 
time but it still will look really nice

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.429 
time but it still will look really nice
and<00:01:33.219> it<00:01:33.729> is<00:01:33.759> the<00:01:34.630> structure<00:01:35.049> of<00:01:35.170> the<00:01:35.259> building

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:35.439 
and it is the structure of the building

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:37.980 
and it is the structure of the building
but<00:01:36.009> we<00:01:36.100> actually<00:01:36.219> have<00:01:36.670> a<00:01:37.119> couple<00:01:37.689> of

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990 
but we actually have a couple of

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.800 
but we actually have a couple of
different<00:01:38.439> systems<00:01:39.219> for<00:01:39.640> walls<00:01:40.030> happening

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
different systems for walls happening

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.649 
different systems for walls happening
here<00:01:41.079> we<00:01:41.229> have<00:01:41.409> the<00:01:42.069> sawn<00:01:42.340> timber<00:01:43.090> frame<00:01:43.359> and

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:43.659 
here we have the sawn timber frame and

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:46.410 
here we have the sawn timber frame and
we<00:01:43.749> have<00:01:43.929> some<00:01:44.289> engineered<00:01:45.249> lumber<00:01:45.460> this<00:01:46.210> is

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420 
we have some engineered lumber this is

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.620 
we have some engineered lumber this is
like<00:01:47.460> plywood<00:01:48.460> basically<00:01:49.240> that's<00:01:49.420> very

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630 
like plywood basically that's very

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.739 
like plywood basically that's very
strong<00:01:49.990> it's<00:01:50.259> laminated<00:01:50.950> lumber<00:01:51.759> and<00:01:51.969> we're

00:01:52.739 --> 00:01:52.749 
strong it's laminated lumber and we're

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:54.830 
strong it's laminated lumber and we're
using<00:01:53.020> this<00:01:53.319> in<00:01:53.380> this<00:01:53.679> application<00:01:54.520> because

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
using this in this application because

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.870 
using this in this application because
we<00:01:55.840> want<00:01:56.170> to<00:01:56.289> bury<00:01:57.039> it<00:01:57.159> in<00:01:57.280> the<00:01:57.310> wall<00:01:57.549> this<00:01:57.819> is

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
we want to bury it in the wall this is

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.879 
we want to bury it in the wall this is
the<00:01:57.999> kitchen<00:01:58.569> and<00:01:58.810> we<00:01:58.869> didn't<00:01:59.109> want<00:01:59.259> to<00:01:59.319> have<00:01:59.560> a

00:01:59.879 --> 00:01:59.889 
the kitchen and we didn't want to have a

00:01:59.889 --> 00:02:03.029 
the kitchen and we didn't want to have a
timber<00:02:00.810> element<00:02:01.810> sticking<00:02:02.439> into<00:02:02.590> the<00:02:02.740> kitchen

00:02:03.029 --> 00:02:03.039 
timber element sticking into the kitchen

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:05.399 
timber element sticking into the kitchen
cabinets<00:02:03.579> so<00:02:03.850> we're<00:02:04.420> using<00:02:04.630> this<00:02:04.929> it's<00:02:05.289> the

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:05.409 
cabinets so we're using this it's the

cabinets so we're using this it's the
same<00:02:05.649> strength<00:02:06.159> as<00:02:06.630> the<00:02:07.630> six<00:02:07.869> by<00:02:08.050> six<00:02:08.380> pine<00:02:08.649> but

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:09.459 
same strength as the six by six pine but

of<00:02:17.260> the<00:02:17.380> house<00:02:18.000> this<00:02:19.000> is<00:02:19.060> the<00:02:19.390> entryway

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
of the house this is the entryway

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:21.800 
of the house this is the entryway
mudroom

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
mudroom

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.980 
mudroom
and<00:02:21.900> this<00:02:22.200> will<00:02:22.380> have<00:02:22.590> a<00:02:23.130> shed<00:02:23.580> roof<00:02:23.850> and<00:02:24.209> back

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
and this will have a shed roof and back

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:28.010 
and this will have a shed roof and back
here<00:02:25.290> what<00:02:25.500> we've<00:02:25.650> done<00:02:25.920> is<00:02:26.340> used<00:02:26.760> a<00:02:27.180> typical

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
here what we've done is used a typical

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.830 
here what we've done is used a typical
2x4<00:02:28.920> stud<00:02:29.280> wall<00:02:29.459> which<00:02:30.000> is<00:02:30.090> very<00:02:30.180> inexpensive

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
2x4 stud wall which is very inexpensive

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.730 
2x4 stud wall which is very inexpensive
we<00:02:31.830> have<00:02:32.069> a<00:02:32.880> lot<00:02:33.450> of<00:02:33.480> storage<00:02:33.990> back<00:02:34.290> here<00:02:34.319> so

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
we have a lot of storage back here so

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:36.260 
we have a lot of storage back here so
the<00:02:34.860> timber<00:02:35.130> frame<00:02:35.340> wasn't<00:02:35.670> going<00:02:35.819> to<00:02:35.910> be<00:02:36.060> a

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
the timber frame wasn't going to be a

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:38.240 
the timber frame wasn't going to be a
very<00:02:36.630> useful<00:02:36.780> aesthetic<00:02:37.470> element<00:02:37.890> so<00:02:38.100> we're

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
very useful aesthetic element so we're

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.059 
very useful aesthetic element so we're
just<00:02:38.280> using<00:02:38.610> a<00:02:39.000> standard<00:02:39.330> 2x4<00:02:39.840> wall<00:02:40.470> here<00:02:40.920> and

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:41.069 
just using a standard 2x4 wall here and

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:43.550 
just using a standard 2x4 wall here and
then<00:02:41.819> the<00:02:41.940> way<00:02:42.090> all<00:02:42.660> these<00:02:43.080> walls<00:02:43.350> are<00:02:43.470> going

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
then the way all these walls are going

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.820 
then the way all these walls are going
to<00:02:43.620> be<00:02:43.739> put<00:02:43.950> together<00:02:44.100> is<00:02:45.170> on<00:02:46.170> the<00:02:46.350> outboard

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830

systems<00:04:08.910> we<00:04:09.060> do<00:04:09.180> that<00:04:09.359> we'll<00:04:09.450> talk<00:04:09.600> about

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
systems we do that we'll talk about

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:14.090 
systems we do that we'll talk about
later<00:04:10.340> so<00:04:11.340> on<00:04:11.459> this<00:04:11.640> wall<00:04:11.910> we<00:04:12.570> have<00:04:12.810> the<00:04:13.769> timber

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:14.100 
later so on this wall we have the timber

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:16.940 
later so on this wall we have the timber
post<00:04:14.370> we<00:04:15.209> have<00:04:15.510> we<00:04:15.720> will<00:04:15.840> have<00:04:15.989> a<00:04:16.019> 2<00:04:16.229> by<00:04:16.380> 4<00:04:16.410> stud

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:16.950 
post we have we will have a 2 by 4 stud

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:19.279 
post we have we will have a 2 by 4 stud
wall<00:04:17.130> that<00:04:17.519> we'll<00:04:17.669> use<00:04:17.700> to<00:04:17.850> run<00:04:18.209> wiring<00:04:18.959> in

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:19.289 
wall that we'll use to run wiring in

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:21.860 
wall that we'll use to run wiring in
we'll<00:04:19.919> also<00:04:20.100> insulate<00:04:20.729> that<00:04:20.760> with<00:04:21.359> cellulose

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
we'll also insulate that with cellulose

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:23.779 
we'll also insulate that with cellulose
and<00:04:22.140> then<00:04:22.680> we'll<00:04:22.830> have<00:04:23.010> the<00:04:23.430> structural

00:04:23.779 --> 00:04:23.789 
and then we'll have the structural

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:26.990 
and then we'll have the structural
insulated<00:04:24.030> panel<00:04:24.620> outboard<00:04:25.620> of<00:04:25.740> that<00:04:25.919> and<00:04:26.220> as

which save on labor cost and it gives a
very<00:05:14.900> high<00:05:15.230> our<00:05:15.680> value<00:05:16.310> which<00:05:16.700> makes<00:05:17.000> for<00:05:17.330> a

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:17.360 
very high our value which makes for a

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.950 
very high our value which makes for a
very<00:05:17.570> efficient<00:05:17.990> building<00:05:18.260> and<00:05:19.600> we<00:05:20.600> use<00:05:20.780> the

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:20.960 
very efficient building and we use the

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:24.280 
very efficient building and we use the
timber<00:05:21.230> frame<00:05:21.470> in<00:05:21.680> this<00:05:21.830> case<00:05:23.050> partly<00:05:24.050> for

timber frame in this case partly for

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:26.440 
timber frame in this case partly for
costs<00:05:25.250> because<00:05:25.550> it's<00:05:25.730> a<00:05:25.820> fairly<00:05:26.180> simple

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:26.450 
costs because it's a fairly simple

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:27.850 
costs because it's a fairly simple
system<00:05:26.930> to<00:05:26.990> put<00:05:27.110> together<00:05:27.230> and<00:05:27.590> it<00:05:27.680> gives<00:05:27.710> us

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:27.860 
system to put together and it gives us

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:30.100 
system to put together and it gives us
our<00:05:27.950> structure<00:05:28.430> relatively<00:05:29.000> quickly<00:05:29.210> but<00:05:29.990> we

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:30.110 
our structure relatively quickly but we

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:32.080 
our structure relatively quickly but we
also<00:05:30.230> do<00:05:30.440> it<00:05:30.560> for<00:05:30.830> aesthetics<00:05:31.460> if<00:05:31.700> we<00:05:31.880> wanted

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:32.090 
also do it for aesthetics if we wanted

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:34.960 
also do it for aesthetics if we wanted
to<00:05:32.150> build<00:05:32.330> the<00:05:32.480> absolutely<00:05:33.340> cheapest<00:05:34.340> wall<00:05:34.550> we

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:34.970 
to build the absolutely cheapest wall we

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:37.930 
to build the absolutely cheapest wall we
would<00:05:35.150> use<00:05:35.330> a<00:05:35.360> traditional<00:05:36.350> stud<00:05:36.980> wall<00:05:37.160> frame

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:37.940 
would use a traditional stud wall frame

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:42.130 
would use a traditional stud wall frame
so<00:05:39.190> we're<00:05:40.190> not<00:05:40.280> trying<00:05:40.640> to<00:05:40.750> use<00:05:41.750> any<00:05:41.960> one

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:42.140 
so we're not trying to use any one

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:44.500 
so we're not trying to use any one
particular<00:05:42.380> system<00:05:43.280> exclusively<00:05:43.550> we're
