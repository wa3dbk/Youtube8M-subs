00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:37.400
 my father's pilot watched him 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.080
 activities 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:42.329
 always wanted to be like us 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:45.809
 actually here after school went to 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.760
 flight school in general all our pilots 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.559
 finish mostly state 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.180
 educational institution has always been there and 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.839
 a rather high standard remains 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:57.120
 pilot training pilots are many young 

00:00:54.839 --> 00:00:59.460
 go from school we do not end with 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:04.220
 they are engaged in full on 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.220
 full volume no concessions 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.270
 you now saw how the crew did 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.920
 visual approach and forced 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:34.979
 were to go to the second round due to the fact that 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.390
 the strip was occupied by another plane 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:40.090
 then they worked remembered as 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:42.369
 correctly bypass thunderstorms it is their 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.860
 it turned out but unfortunately caught fire 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:46.570
 engine number two they put it out 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:53.460
 now landing on one 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:55.810
 engine prepared for all kinds 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.000
 aircraft failures to all 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.250
 difficult weather 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.869
 to all kinds of special cases in flight 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:05.910
 so some such difficult situations 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:05.910
 in the air on the plane I can't call
