what<00:00:01.020> are<00:00:01.140> the<00:00:01.230> pros<00:00:01.380> and<00:00:01.589> cons<00:00:01.800> of<00:00:02.040> using

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:02.190 
what are the pros and cons of using

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:04.100 
what are the pros and cons of using
electrolysis<00:00:02.760> to<00:00:03.060> treat<00:00:03.449> unwanted<00:00:03.959> facial

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:04.110 
electrolysis to treat unwanted facial

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.079 
electrolysis to treat unwanted facial
hair<00:00:04.560> well<00:00:05.250> let's<00:00:05.430> talk<00:00:05.580> first<00:00:05.819> about<00:00:05.940> what

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089 
hair well let's talk first about what

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:08.990 
hair well let's talk first about what
electrolysis<00:00:06.779> is<00:00:07.140> if<00:00:07.470> you<00:00:08.189> think<00:00:08.220> of<00:00:08.610> the<00:00:08.760> hair

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
electrolysis is if you think of the hair

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.940 
electrolysis is if you think of the hair
follicle<00:00:09.570> and<00:00:09.719> the<00:00:09.900> hair<00:00:10.139> coming<00:00:10.440> out<00:00:10.650> of<00:00:10.830> the

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
follicle and the hair coming out of the

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.669 
follicle and the hair coming out of the
shaft<00:00:11.219> the<00:00:12.210> growth<00:00:12.480> in<00:00:12.809> the<00:00:12.990> hair<00:00:13.230> follicle

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
shaft the growth in the hair follicle

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.589 
shaft the growth in the hair follicle
takes<00:00:13.920> place<00:00:14.190> down<00:00:14.519> here<00:00:14.790> in<00:00:14.880> the<00:00:15.000> bulb<00:00:15.240> deep

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
takes place down here in the bulb deep

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.609 
takes place down here in the bulb deep
within<00:00:15.929> the<00:00:16.199> follicle<00:00:17.480> electrolysis<00:00:18.480> uses<00:00:19.289> an

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
within the follicle electrolysis uses an

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.820 
within the follicle electrolysis uses an
electrical<00:00:20.310> charge<00:00:21.029> to<00:00:21.660> destroy<00:00:22.289> that<00:00:22.560> hair

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
electrical charge to destroy that hair

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.189 
electrical charge to destroy that hair
follicle<00:00:23.070> that<00:00:23.699> bulb<00:00:24.150> at<00:00:24.449> the<00:00:24.630> base<00:00:24.900> of<00:00:25.140> the

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
follicle that bulb at the base of the

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.980 
follicle that bulb at the base of the
hair<00:00:25.350> follicle<00:00:25.830> so<00:00:26.099> the<00:00:26.789> way<00:00:27.119> that<00:00:27.150> it<00:00:27.420> is<00:00:27.689> done

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
hair follicle so the way that it is done

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.769 
hair follicle so the way that it is done
is<00:00:28.230> that<00:00:28.470> a<00:00:28.500> needle<00:00:28.830> is<00:00:29.250> is<00:00:29.939> inserted

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
is that a needle is is inserted

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.370 
is that a needle is is inserted
alongside<00:00:31.439> the<00:00:31.920> hair<00:00:32.130> shaft<00:00:32.460> down<00:00:33.200> into<00:00:34.200> the

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
alongside the hair shaft down into the

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.520 
alongside the hair shaft down into the
hair<00:00:34.649> follicle<00:00:34.920> and<00:00:35.550> a<00:00:36.000> an<00:00:36.540> electrical<00:00:37.230> charge

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
hair follicle and a an electrical charge

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.549 
hair follicle and a an electrical charge
delivered<00:00:38.399> and<00:00:38.640> that<00:00:39.270> electrical<00:00:39.750> charge<00:00:40.140> the

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
delivered and that electrical charge the

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.729 
delivered and that electrical charge the
intent<00:00:40.950> is<00:00:41.219> for<00:00:41.250> it<00:00:41.700> to<00:00:41.730> destroy<00:00:42.360> that<00:00:42.739> hair

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
intent is for it to destroy that hair

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.459 
intent is for it to destroy that hair
follicle<00:00:44.129> bulb<00:00:44.730> and<00:00:45.000> thus<00:00:45.600> any<00:00:46.079> further

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
follicle bulb and thus any further

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.400 
follicle bulb and thus any further
growth<00:00:46.829> that<00:00:47.070> would<00:00:47.190> come<00:00:47.460> from<00:00:47.489> that<00:00:47.789> hair<00:00:48.410> so

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
growth that would come from that hair so

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.160 
growth that would come from that hair so
the<00:00:49.980> question<00:00:50.460> then<00:00:50.610> becomes<00:00:51.059> what<00:00:51.539> about<00:00:51.840> the

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
the question then becomes what about the

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.990 
the question then becomes what about the
pros<00:00:52.860> and<00:00:53.100> cons<00:00:53.480> first<00:00:54.480> of<00:00:54.660> all<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:54.870> pros<00:00:55.110> the

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:56.000 
pros and cons first of all the pros the

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.860 
pros and cons first of all the pros the
advantage<00:00:57.000> one<00:00:57.210> of<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.420> significant

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
advantage one of the significant

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.779 
advantage one of the significant
advantages<00:00:58.410> is<00:00:58.770> its<00:00:59.010> safety<00:00:59.280> it's<00:00:59.609> been

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
advantages is its safety it's been

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.110 
advantages is its safety it's been
around<00:01:00.059> for<00:01:00.559> over<00:01:01.559> a<00:01:01.590> hundred<00:01:01.710> years<00:01:02.120> 125

years now and has quite a significant
safety<00:01:07.290> record<00:01:07.860> so<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.189> safety<00:01:08.430> is<00:01:08.760> well

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
prevent recurring hair growth

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.390 
prevent recurring hair growth
the<00:01:18.740> downside<00:01:19.740> of<00:01:19.770> using<00:01:21.890> electrolysis<00:01:22.890> is

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
the downside of using electrolysis is

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.030 
the downside of using electrolysis is
that<00:01:23.820> of<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.900> discomfort<00:01:25.530> if<00:01:25.680> you<00:01:25.830> think

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
that of the discomfort if you think

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.760 
that of the discomfort if you think
about<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:26.640> needle<00:01:27.509> going<00:01:27.750> in<00:01:27.960> and<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.380> and

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
about the needle going in and the and
