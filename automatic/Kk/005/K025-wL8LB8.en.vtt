underhyped<00:05:14.440> classic<00:05:14.980> that<00:05:15.130> I<00:05:15.160> think<00:05:15.400> that<00:05:15.550> you

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:15.640 
underhyped classic that I think that you

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:18.240

represent<00:05:18.430> Canada<00:05:18.880> because<00:05:19.270> I<00:05:19.330> don't<00:05:19.480> think

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:19.630 
represent Canada because I don't think

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:21.750 
represent Canada because I don't think
Canada<00:05:19.990> gets<00:05:20.170> enough<00:05:20.410> classics<00:05:20.860> out<00:05:20.980> there<00:05:21.220> so
