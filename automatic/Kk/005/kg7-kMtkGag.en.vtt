What did he want to ask me at this time?

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:27.020
I actually have something to ask you. You said you like someone else when Sang-jun told you he likes him, do I know that person as well?

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:35.560
Question 2. When the person you likes asks you if the person you like is someone he knows, how would you react?

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:39.340
(Choice #1). You tell him that you told him like that because you were so embarrassed at that time. 
(Choice #2). You confess him that the person you like is him!

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:44.240
Choice #3. You ask him carefully, ‘Why are you curious about that?’
Choice #4. You express how sad you are by saying, ‘Why are you a slow-witted person?’

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:58.100
He would react to Choice #1, saying that 'How can you say like that to make an excuse at that moment? Love is kind of serious thing. Tut tut. Let's just drink!' (-20)

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:23.600
He would react to Choice #1, saying that 'What? I was about to say that first to you! You feel good to win over seonbae? Then, I'll speak to you now. Even if it's so strange, please listen to what I'm saying.' (+20)

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:42.900
He would react to Choice #3, saying that "Right, why am I curious about that? Do I like you?"(+10)

00:01:43.260 --> 00:02:01.660
He would react to Choice #4, saying that "Oh, my god. Why are you crying? I'm sorry. Everyone is looking at us, but I think you are also a slow-witted person.Let's stop eating and go out."(+0)
