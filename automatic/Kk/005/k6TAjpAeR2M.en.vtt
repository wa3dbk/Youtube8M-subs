get out to the street you actually see

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.680 
get out to the street you actually see
that<00:02:00.530> were<00:02:00.710> 45<00:02:01.550> feet<00:02:01.760> below<00:02:01.940> the<00:02:02.090> water<00:02:02.420> table

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:02.690 
that were 45 feet below the water table

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:04.900 
that were 45 feet below the water table

of the New York Harbor the major
challenges<00:02:05.660> that<00:02:05.900> Stantec<00:02:06.410> faced<00:02:06.680> were<00:02:06.979> in

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
challenges that Stantec faced were in

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.250 
challenges that Stantec faced were in
fact<00:02:07.370> that<00:02:07.729> the<00:02:08.060> whole<00:02:08.810> design<00:02:09.229> and

fact that the whole design and
construction<00:02:09.770> schedule<00:02:10.340> were<00:02:10.429> compressed

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:10.880 
construction schedule were compressed

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.570 
construction schedule were compressed
into<00:02:11.090> a<00:02:11.210> 27<00:02:11.990> month<00:02:12.200> period<00:02:12.620> normally<00:02:13.400> this

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
into a 27 month period normally this

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:14.470 
into a 27 month period normally this
probably<00:02:13.880> would<00:02:14.030> have<00:02:14.090> been<00:02:14.210> about<00:02:14.420> a

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
probably would have been about a

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.260 
probably would have been about a
six-year<00:02:15.020> project<00:02:15.290> Stan<00:02:16.280> Tech's<00:02:16.550> design<00:02:16.970> was

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
six-year project Stan Tech's design was

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.780 
six-year project Stan Tech's design was
done<00:02:17.480> within<00:02:17.750> a<00:02:18.050> nine-month<00:02:18.650> timeframe<00:02:19.250> and

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
done within a nine-month timeframe and

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.150 
done within a nine-month timeframe and
not<00:02:20.300> only<00:02:20.450> was<00:02:20.720> the<00:02:20.870> design<00:02:21.230> done<00:02:21.890> in<00:02:22.070> a

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
not only was the design done in a

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.620 
not only was the design done in a
nine-month<00:02:22.580> timeframe<00:02:22.760> but<00:02:23.030> we<00:02:23.150> also<00:02:23.300> got

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
nine-month timeframe but we also got

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:25.300 
nine-month timeframe but we also got
many<00:02:23.900> approvals<00:02:24.440> they<00:02:24.650> were<00:02:24.709> probably<00:02:25.010> a

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
many approvals they were probably a

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.040 
many approvals they were probably a
total<00:02:25.550> of<00:02:25.790> 20<00:02:26.120> different<00:02:26.270> approvals<00:02:26.810> that<00:02:26.930> we

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050 
total of 20 different approvals that we

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:28.960 
total of 20 different approvals that we
had<00:02:27.200> to<00:02:27.350> get<00:02:27.530> before<00:02:28.100> the<00:02:28.220> construction<00:02:28.640> could

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
had to get before the construction could

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.860 
had to get before the construction could
start

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.140 

this<00:02:34.870> is<00:02:35.110> basically<00:02:35.710> a<00:02:35.860> vast<00:02:36.490> improvement

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
this is basically a vast improvement

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.060 
this is basically a vast improvement
over<00:02:37.210> what<00:02:37.480> was<00:02:37.630> here<00:02:37.900> before<00:02:37.930> the<00:02:38.740> tracks

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.070 
over what was here before the tracks

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:40.920 
over what was here before the tracks
over<00:02:39.310> our<00:02:39.670> head<00:02:39.880> which<00:02:40.090> were<00:02:40.240> the<00:02:40.360> old<00:02:40.540> station

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
over our head which were the old station

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.290 
over our head which were the old station
in<00:02:41.620> fact<00:02:41.920> we're<00:02:42.130> loop<00:02:42.400> tracks<00:02:42.760> and<00:02:43.060> they<00:02:43.180> only

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.300 
in fact we're loop tracks and they only

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.870 
in fact we're loop tracks and they only
process<00:02:43.840> about<00:02:44.080> 20<00:02:44.530> trains<00:02:44.860> an<00:02:45.070> hour<00:02:45.220> the

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
process about 20 trains an hour the

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.160 
process about 20 trains an hour the
improvements<00:02:46.450> here<00:02:46.570> with<00:02:46.750> what<00:02:46.900> we<00:02:46.960> call<00:02:47.140> a

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
improvements here with what we call a

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.160 
improvements here with what we call a
stub<00:02:47.710> ended<00:02:48.040> station<00:02:48.820> allows<00:02:49.540> us<00:02:49.810> to<00:02:49.930> process

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
stub ended station allows us to process

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.890 
stub ended station allows us to process
roughly<00:02:50.680> 25<00:02:51.250> trains<00:02:51.670> an<00:02:51.880> hour<00:02:52.030> also<00:02:52.540> what<00:02:52.810> we

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
roughly 25 trains an hour also what we

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.300 
roughly 25 trains an hour also what we
have<00:02:53.080> here<00:02:53.320> is<00:02:53.470> the<00:02:53.680> signal<00:02:53.980> at<00:02:54.190> the

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
have here is the signal at the

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:55.950 
have here is the signal at the
southernmost<00:02:54.730> end<00:02:55.240> of<00:02:55.420> the<00:02:55.510> station

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:55.960 
southernmost end of the station

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:58.200 
southernmost end of the station
this<00:02:56.440> signal<00:02:56.950> is<00:02:57.160> basically<00:02:57.640> an<00:02:57.850> indication

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:58.210 
this signal is basically an indication

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:00.300 
this signal is basically an indication
to<00:02:58.390> the<00:02:58.600> train<00:02:59.080> operator<00:02:59.530> this<00:02:59.890> is<00:03:00.070> where<00:03:00.250> he

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
to the train operator this is where he

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:01.610 
to the train operator this is where he
needs<00:03:00.490> to<00:03:00.550> bring<00:03:00.730> the<00:03:00.790> train<00:03:01.060> to<00:03:01.120> a<00:03:01.330> stop

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
needs to bring the train to a stop

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.660 
needs to bring the train to a stop
however<00:03:02.620> there<00:03:02.770> are<00:03:02.920> times<00:03:03.190> that<00:03:03.460> for

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
however there are times that for

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:04.980 
however there are times that for
whatever<00:03:03.820> reason<00:03:04.030> the<00:03:04.390> train<00:03:04.600> might<00:03:04.780> get

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:04.990 
whatever reason the train might get

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:06.990 
whatever reason the train might get
beyond<00:03:05.380> this<00:03:05.590> thing<00:03:05.800> and<00:03:06.070> you<00:03:06.459> can<00:03:06.610> see<00:03:06.760> in<00:03:06.880> the

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
beyond this thing and you can see in the

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.120 
beyond this thing and you can see in the
distance<00:03:07.180> here<00:03:07.630> the<00:03:07.990> hydraulic<00:03:08.530> bumper<00:03:08.920> block

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.130 
distance here the hydraulic bumper block

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:10.680 
distance here the hydraulic bumper block
that<00:03:09.370> prevents<00:03:09.700> the<00:03:09.850> train<00:03:10.060> from<00:03:10.209> going<00:03:10.540> any

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
that prevents the train from going any

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:12.750 
that prevents the train from going any
further<00:03:11.020> so<00:03:11.560> that<00:03:11.590> it<00:03:11.890> won't<00:03:12.010> crash<00:03:12.340> into<00:03:12.670> the

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:18.070 
subway structure one of the bigger

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:19.890 
subway structure one of the bigger
challenges<00:03:18.340> we<00:03:18.730> had<00:03:18.850> on<00:03:19.000> this<00:03:19.150> project<00:03:19.570> was<00:03:19.720> in

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
challenges we had on this project was in

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.380 
challenges we had on this project was in
fact<00:03:20.110> the<00:03:20.410> age<00:03:21.070> rate<00:03:21.400> you<00:03:21.640> see<00:03:21.820> here<00:03:22.030> is<00:03:22.180> the

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:22.390 
fact the age rate you see here is the

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:24.870 
fact the age rate you see here is the
lower<00:03:22.630> edge<00:03:22.930> of<00:03:23.230> the<00:03:23.340> tunnel<00:03:24.340> that<00:03:24.459> takes<00:03:24.700> the

lower edge of the tunnel that takes the
trains<00:03:25.180> into<00:03:25.900> Brooklyn<00:03:26.050> you<00:03:26.260> can<00:03:26.380> hear<00:03:26.470> that

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
trains into Brooklyn you can hear that

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:28.020 
trains into Brooklyn you can hear that
noise<00:03:26.800> in<00:03:27.010> the<00:03:27.100> background<00:03:27.310> that's<00:03:27.730> actually

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
noise in the background that's actually

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:29.970 
noise in the background that's actually

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
the train running over our head we had

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:31.830 
the train running over our head we had

maintaining<00:03:35.560> them<00:03:35.830> during<00:03:36.220> the<00:03:36.310> entire<00:03:36.850> 27

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:37.630 
maintaining them during the entire 27

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:39.270 
maintaining them during the entire 27
months<00:03:37.840> worth<00:03:38.019> of<00:03:38.230> construction<00:03:38.980> and<00:03:39.130> design

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
months worth of construction and design

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.180 
months worth of construction and design
was<00:03:39.910> a<00:03:39.940> huge<00:03:40.269> challenge<00:03:40.660> but<00:03:41.590> in<00:03:41.709> fact<00:03:41.860> we're

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.190 
was a huge challenge but in fact we're

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:44.310 
was a huge challenge but in fact we're
able<00:03:42.400> to<00:03:42.580> overcome<00:03:42.940> it<00:03:43.000> by<00:03:43.300> drilling<00:03:44.080> a<00:03:44.260> hole

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:44.320 
able to overcome it by drilling a hole

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.410 
able to overcome it by drilling a hole
through<00:03:44.890> the<00:03:45.100> tunnel<00:03:45.580> up<00:03:45.700> above<00:03:45.970> us<00:03:46.150> in

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:46.420 
through the tunnel up above us in

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:48.479 
through the tunnel up above us in
selected<00:03:47.230> spots<00:03:47.500> so<00:03:47.650> that<00:03:47.800> we<00:03:47.920> can<00:03:48.100> support<00:03:48.370> it

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:48.489 
selected spots so that we can support it

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:50.040 
selected spots so that we can support it
in<00:03:48.610> place<00:03:48.820> while<00:03:49.060> we<00:03:49.239> built<00:03:49.510> these<00:03:49.660> tunnels

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:50.050 
in place while we built these tunnels

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:52.470 
in place while we built these tunnels
around<00:03:50.200> it

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 
around it

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.910 
around it
another<00:03:53.480> benefit<00:03:53.900> of<00:03:53.960> this<00:03:54.200> project<00:03:54.650> was<00:03:54.770> in

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:54.920 
another benefit of this project was in

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.580 
another benefit of this project was in
fact<00:03:55.100> the<00:03:55.400> relatively<00:03:56.390> straight<00:03:56.750> platform

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
fact the relatively straight platform

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:58.750 
fact the relatively straight platform
that<00:03:57.710> you<00:03:57.800> see<00:03:57.980> here<00:03:58.160> in<00:03:58.280> front<00:03:58.340> of<00:03:58.640> you

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:58.760 
that you see here in front of you

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.030 
that you see here in front of you
provides<00:03:59.540> a<00:03:59.660> very<00:03:59.870> minimal<00:04:00.260> gas<00:04:00.530> between<00:04:00.830> the

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.040

train<00:04:01.460> and<00:04:01.490> the<00:04:01.790> platform<00:04:02.260> on<00:04:03.260> the<00:04:03.320> old

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:03.620 
train and the platform on the old

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:05.500 
train and the platform on the old
station<00:04:03.950> which<00:04:04.340> is<00:04:04.460> above<00:04:04.700> our<00:04:04.790> heads<00:04:05.030> that<00:04:05.240> it

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:05.510 
station which is above our heads that it

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:07.510 
station which is above our heads that it
had<00:04:05.600> a<00:04:05.630> sharp<00:04:05.960> curvature<00:04:06.590> to<00:04:06.770> the<00:04:06.890> platform

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:07.520 
had a sharp curvature to the platform

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:09.700 
had a sharp curvature to the platform
and<00:04:07.670> in<00:04:08.120> fact<00:04:08.270> there<00:04:08.690> was<00:04:08.750> large<00:04:09.020> gaps<00:04:09.440> and

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:09.710 
and in fact there was large gaps and

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:11.680 
and in fact there was large gaps and
those<00:04:09.830> casts<00:04:10.190> were<00:04:10.280> bridged<00:04:11.030> by<00:04:11.330> what<00:04:11.570> we

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:11.690 
those casts were bridged by what we

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:13.000 
those casts were bridged by what we
called<00:04:11.900> moveable<00:04:12.290> platforms<00:04:12.830> where

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.010 
called moveable platforms where

turned out to be a great success the

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:40.750 
turned out to be a great success the
fact<00:04:39.350> that<00:04:39.410> we<00:04:39.560> got<00:04:39.710> the<00:04:39.830> project<00:04:40.010> designed<00:04:40.580> in

fact that we got the project designed in
9<00:04:41.030> months<00:04:41.300> not<00:04:41.780> only<00:04:41.810> did<00:04:42.140> we<00:04:42.230> get<00:04:42.350> it<00:04:42.470> designed

that's<00:04:49.760> a<00:04:49.910> major<00:04:50.120> challenge<00:04:50.570> we<00:04:51.050> were<00:04:51.200> able<00:04:51.320> to

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:51.670 
that's a major challenge we were able to

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:54.100 
that's a major challenge we were able to
have<00:04:52.670> the<00:04:52.850> construction<00:04:53.360> go<00:04:53.480> so<00:04:53.750> smoothly
