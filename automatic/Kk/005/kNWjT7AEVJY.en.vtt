00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.860 
see that people I just say this again
really<00:00:31.740> that's<00:00:32.640> why<00:00:32.759> they<00:00:32.910> still<00:00:33.390> sell<00:00:33.630> a

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
really that's why they still sell a

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.080 
really that's why they still sell a
bazillion<00:00:34.380> trillion<00:00:34.829> copies<00:00:35.160> but<00:00:35.430> I<00:00:35.640> think

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
bazillion trillion copies but I think

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.880 
bazillion trillion copies but I think
the<00:00:36.270> the<00:00:36.540> global<00:00:36.930> perception<00:00:37.200> is<00:00:37.530> more<00:00:37.559> like

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
the the global perception is more like

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.069

that when they want the same thing again

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:11.960

what<00:01:11.130> are<00:01:11.189> you<00:01:11.250> even<00:01:11.369> supposed<00:01:11.460> to<00:01:11.610> do<00:01:11.820> at<00:01:11.939> that

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
what are you even supposed to do at that

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.760 
what are you even supposed to do at that
point<00:01:12.299> but<00:01:12.600> going<00:01:12.720> back<00:01:12.869> to<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.080> question<00:01:13.470> yes

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
point but going back to the question yes

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.950 
point but going back to the question yes
I<00:01:14.010> think<00:01:14.130> Call<00:01:14.400> of<00:01:14.430> Duty<00:01:14.850> it<00:01:15.060> can't<00:01:15.509> keep<00:01:15.810> the

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
I think Call of Duty it can't keep the

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.560 
I think Call of Duty it can't keep the
momentum<00:01:16.380> forever<00:01:16.619> it's<00:01:17.220> impossible<00:01:17.820> despite

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
momentum forever it's impossible despite

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.060 
momentum forever it's impossible despite
the<00:01:18.900> fact<00:01:19.110> that<00:01:19.170> they<00:01:19.320> do<00:01:19.380> so<00:01:19.650> well<00:01:19.770> every<00:01:20.040> year

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
the fact that they do so well every year

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.969 
the fact that they do so well every year
eventually<00:01:20.820> it's<00:01:21.479> gonna<00:01:21.720> need<00:01:22.110> because

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
eventually it's gonna need because

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.649 
eventually it's gonna need because
something<00:01:23.759> that's<00:01:23.880> going<00:01:23.970> to<00:01:24.060> overtake<00:01:24.479> it

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
something that's going to overtake it

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.219 
something that's going to overtake it
because<00:01:24.990> it<00:01:25.830> wasn't<00:01:26.340> always<00:01:26.520> Cod<00:01:26.880> it<00:01:27.299> was<00:01:27.479> when

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
because it wasn't always Cod it was when

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.690 
because it wasn't always Cod it was when
the<00:01:28.320> when<00:01:28.650> modern<00:01:28.920> warfare<00:01:29.040> 1<00:01:29.280> came<00:01:29.490> out<00:01:29.610> there

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
the when modern warfare 1 came out there

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.760 
the when modern warfare 1 came out there
became<00:01:29.880> a<00:01:29.939> huge<00:01:30.299> super<00:01:30.810> mega<00:01:31.020> franchise<00:01:31.229> it

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
became a huge super mega franchise it

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.530 
became a huge super mega franchise it
wasn't<00:01:32.009> before<00:01:32.130> them<00:01:32.520> and<00:01:33.030> even<00:01:33.150> that<00:01:33.299> I<00:01:33.329> don't

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
wasn't before them and even that I don't

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:34.760 
wasn't before them and even that I don't
think<00:01:33.659> that<00:01:33.780> was<00:01:33.930> that<00:01:34.350> wasn't<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:34.650> way<00:01:34.740> it

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
think that was that wasn't the way it

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.740 
think that was that wasn't the way it
was<00:01:34.860> one<00:01:35.009> of<00:01:35.070> my<00:01:35.250> fed<00:01:35.400> to<00:01:35.579> God<00:01:36.299> I'm<00:01:36.360> talking<00:01:36.659> so

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:07.640 
much more to say than that the thing is
I<00:03:06.480> can't<00:03:06.870> really<00:03:06.990> be<00:03:07.140> wrong<00:03:07.320> with<00:03:07.500> this

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
I can't really be wrong with this

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.830 
I can't really be wrong with this
because<00:03:07.860> it's<00:03:08.550> gonna<00:03:08.760> happen<00:03:09.090> eventually<00:03:09.180> and

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
because it's gonna happen eventually and

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.270 
because it's gonna happen eventually and
if<00:03:10.080> it<00:03:10.200> doesn't<00:03:10.410> happen<00:03:10.530> eventually<00:03:11.070> then<00:03:11.220> you

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
if it doesn't happen eventually then you

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:12.380 
if it doesn't happen eventually then you
can<00:03:11.400> go<00:03:11.490> back<00:03:11.640> to<00:03:11.700> this<00:03:11.760> video<00:03:11.880> and<00:03:12.270> I'll<00:03:12.360> be

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
can go back to this video and I'll be

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:13.970 
can go back to this video and I'll be
saying<00:03:12.720> it's<00:03:13.080> gonna<00:03:13.170> happen<00:03:13.290> eventually<00:03:13.530> so

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
saying it's gonna happen eventually so

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.230 
saying it's gonna happen eventually so
you'll<00:03:14.130> keep<00:03:14.280> waiting<00:03:14.850> for<00:03:14.880> it<00:03:15.090> to<00:03:15.120> be

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:15.240 
you'll keep waiting for it to be

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.060 
you'll keep waiting for it to be
happening<00:03:15.630> and<00:03:15.780> then<00:03:16.290> it<00:03:16.380> won't<00:03:16.470> happen<00:03:16.710> but

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070 
happening and then it won't happen but

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:18.410 
happening and then it won't happen but
then<00:03:17.160> if<00:03:17.280> it<00:03:17.370> does<00:03:17.490> happen<00:03:17.670> then<00:03:17.970> I<00:03:18.030> win<00:03:18.240> either

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420
