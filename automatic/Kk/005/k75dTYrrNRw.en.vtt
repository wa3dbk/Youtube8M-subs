it<00:00:43.460> all<00:00:44.460> you<00:00:44.579> need<00:00:44.760> to<00:00:44.910> do<00:00:45.090> is<00:00:45.539> give<00:00:46.260> her<00:00:46.350> about

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
it all you need to do is give her about

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.560 
it all you need to do is give her about
a<00:00:46.620> half<00:00:46.920> a<00:00:47.070> turn<00:00:47.280> there<00:00:47.579> you<00:00:47.969> know<00:00:48.090> it's

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
a half a turn there you know it's

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.430 
a half a turn there you know it's
probably<00:00:50.270> more<00:00:51.270> than<00:00:51.420> adequate<00:00:51.899> there<00:00:52.110> maybe

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
probably more than adequate there maybe

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.189 
probably more than adequate there maybe
three-quarters<00:00:53.100> of<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.280> turn<00:00:53.489> and<00:00:53.960> make<00:00:54.960> sure

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
three-quarters of the turn and make sure

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.389 
three-quarters of the turn and make sure
that<00:00:55.670> pole<00:00:56.670> is<00:00:57.059> not<00:00:57.510> touching<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.980> tips<00:00:59.250> of

that pole is not touching the tips of

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.250 
that pole is not touching the tips of
the<00:00:59.489> cup<00:00:59.699> there's<00:01:00.120> a<00:01:00.210> fair<00:01:00.480> amount<00:01:00.570> of<00:01:00.780> play<00:01:00.989> if

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
the cup there's a fair amount of play if

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.030 
the cup there's a fair amount of play if
your<00:01:01.469> table<00:01:01.829> is<00:01:02.039> um<00:01:03.229> fairly<00:01:04.229> level<00:01:04.409> it<00:01:04.799> should

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
your table is um fairly level it should

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.450 
your table is um fairly level it should
be<00:01:05.189> just<00:01:05.400> fine<00:01:05.489> and<00:01:06.140> if<00:01:07.140> not<00:01:07.350> you<00:01:07.770> could<00:01:08.100> put<00:01:08.430> a

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
be just fine and if not you could put a

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.940 
be just fine and if not you could put a
shim<00:01:08.909> of<00:01:09.150> like<00:01:09.330> a<00:01:09.360> dime<00:01:09.689> or<00:01:10.020> something<00:01:10.439> to<00:01:10.710> help

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
shim of like a dime or something to help

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.380 
shim of like a dime or something to help
lift<00:01:11.760> up<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.180> base<00:01:12.360> on<00:01:12.750> this<00:01:12.930> one<00:01:13.970> to<00:01:14.970> prevent

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
lift up the base on this one to prevent

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.240 
lift up the base on this one to prevent
the<00:01:16.040> post<00:01:17.040> from<00:01:17.369> touching<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.820> cup<00:01:18.090> and<00:01:19.250> you

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
the post from touching the cup and you

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:26.600 
the post from touching the cup and you
can<00:01:20.369> set<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:20.729> hands<00:01:21.860> on<00:01:22.860> this<00:01:23.570> minute<00:01:24.570> hand

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
can set the hands on this minute hand

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.390 
can set the hands on this minute hand
just<00:01:27.300> like<00:01:27.510> so<00:01:27.750> might<00:01:28.380> here<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.740> fork<00:01:29.040> flutter

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
just like so might here the fork flutter

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.140 
just like so might here the fork flutter
there<00:01:29.670> that's<00:01:29.970> no<00:01:30.150> big<00:01:30.720> deal

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:32.150 
there that's no big deal

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:35.060 
there that's no big deal
it's<00:01:33.150> pretty<00:01:33.570> well<00:01:33.780> regulated<00:01:34.500> if<00:01:34.680> you<00:01:34.890> need

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
it's pretty well regulated if you need

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.110 
it's pretty well regulated if you need
to<00:01:35.190> regulate<00:01:35.520> it<00:01:35.850> this<00:01:36.060> serrated<00:01:36.740> disk<00:01:37.740> here

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:38.120 
to regulate it this serrated disk here

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.120 
to regulate it this serrated disk here
is<00:01:39.120> what<00:01:39.720> regulates<00:01:40.050> it<00:01:40.440> and<00:01:40.650> there<00:01:40.770> are<00:01:40.890> some

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
is what regulates it and there are some

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.690 
is what regulates it and there are some
markings<00:01:41.610> with<00:01:41.850> an<00:01:41.970> arrow<00:01:42.240> just<00:01:42.780> above<00:01:43.140> it

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
markings with an arrow just above it

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.930 
markings with an arrow just above it
there's<00:01:44.700> a<00:01:44.820> plus<00:01:45.180> and<00:01:45.510> the<00:01:45.780> minus<00:01:46.640> it's<00:01:47.640> quite

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:47.940 
there's a plus and the minus it's quite

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.930 
there's a plus and the minus it's quite
close<00:01:48.540> I<00:01:48.900> wouldn't<00:01:49.350> move<00:01:49.500> it<00:01:49.680> more<00:01:49.979> than<00:01:50.340> maybe

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:50.940 
close I wouldn't move it more than maybe

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.350 
close I wouldn't move it more than maybe
just<00:01:51.270> a<00:01:51.420> sixteenth<00:01:52.410> of<00:01:52.530> an<00:01:52.650> inch<00:01:52.740> at<00:01:52.950> a<00:01:53.010> time

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:53.360 
just a sixteenth of an inch at a time

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.140 
just a sixteenth of an inch at a time
and<00:01:54.360> you<00:01:54.540> would<00:01:54.690> grab<00:01:54.960> the<00:01:55.290> pendulum<00:01:55.950> and<00:01:56.190> move

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:57.150 
and you would grab the pendulum and move

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.560 
and you would grab the pendulum and move
this<00:01:57.990> serrated<00:01:58.830> disc<00:01:59.310> in<00:01:59.700> the<00:02:00.030> direction<00:02:00.330> you

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
this serrated disc in the direction you

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.800 
this serrated disc in the direction you
to<00:02:00.690> go<00:02:00.979> this<00:02:01.979> direction<00:02:02.270> for<00:02:03.270> speeding<00:02:03.720> the

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
to go this direction for speeding the

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.469 
to go this direction for speeding the
clock<00:02:04.050> up<00:02:04.320> or<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:05.550> other<00:02:05.670> direction<00:02:06.000> to<00:02:06.240> slow

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
clock up or the other direction to slow

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.109 
clock up or the other direction to slow
down<00:02:06.720> and<00:02:07.470> that<00:02:07.590> brings<00:02:07.890> the<00:02:07.979> balls<00:02:08.280> closer<00:02:08.729> in

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
down and that brings the balls closer in

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.990 
down and that brings the balls closer in
to<00:02:09.450> speed<00:02:09.720> it<00:02:09.840> up<00:02:09.929> or<00:02:10.250> it<00:02:11.250> moves<00:02:11.459> them<00:02:11.730> further

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
to speed it up or it moves them further

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.290 
to speed it up or it moves them further
out<00:02:12.150> to<00:02:12.510> slow<00:02:12.750> it<00:02:12.900> down<00:02:12.930> and<00:02:14.060> here's<00:02:15.060> where<00:02:15.239> you

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
out to slow it down and here's where you

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.300 
out to slow it down and here's where you
wind<00:02:15.510> it<00:02:15.690> on<00:02:15.810> the<00:02:15.900> back<00:02:16.080> and<00:02:16.410> it<00:02:17.100> lines

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
wind it on the back and it lines

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.760 
wind it on the back and it lines
counterclockwise<00:02:18.290> so<00:02:19.290> I'm<00:02:19.380> going<00:02:19.560> to<00:02:19.620> wipe

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
counterclockwise so I'm going to wipe

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.560 
counterclockwise so I'm going to wipe
would<00:02:20.190> wind<00:02:20.370> it<00:02:20.520> this<00:02:20.640> way<00:02:20.880> it<00:02:21.090> has<00:02:21.239> a<00:02:21.270> full

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
would wind it this way it has a full

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:26.449 
would wind it this way it has a full
wind<00:02:21.840> on<00:02:22.050> it<00:02:22.170> right<00:02:22.350> now<00:02:22.380> and<00:02:24.500> that's<00:02:25.500> about<00:02:25.770> it

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
wind on it right now and that's about it

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:29.930 
wind on it right now and that's about it
so<00:02:27.390> add<00:02:27.660> if<00:02:27.930> ever<00:02:28.290> transporting<00:02:29.190> it<00:02:29.340> you<00:02:29.730> need

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
so add if ever transporting it you need

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:35.570 
so add if ever transporting it you need
to<00:02:29.970> lock<00:02:30.330> it<00:02:30.570> again<00:02:30.810> I<00:02:33.260> like<00:02:34.260> to<00:02:34.370> put<00:02:35.370> my<00:02:35.549> finger

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
to lock it again I like to put my finger

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.330 
to lock it again I like to put my finger
stop<00:02:36.180> the<00:02:36.360> pendulum<00:02:36.870> and<00:02:37.019> raise<00:02:37.530> up<00:02:37.799> that<00:02:37.830> cup

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
stop the pendulum and raise up that cup

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.350 
stop the pendulum and raise up that cup
so<00:02:39.269> that<00:02:39.890> there's<00:02:40.890> no<00:02:41.100> tension<00:02:41.610> on<00:02:42.000> the<00:02:42.150> thin

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
so that there's no tension on the thin

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.840 
so that there's no tension on the thin
wire<00:02:42.600> there<00:02:42.900> a<00:02:42.930> fragile<00:02:43.230> wire<00:02:43.580> that's<00:02:44.580> about

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
wire there a fragile wire that's about

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.630 
wire there a fragile wire that's about
it<00:02:45.120> thank<00:02:45.540> you
