00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.449
 Let's see her. 

00:00:01.449 --> 00:00:04.820
 one of the most important features of cgt 

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:07.120
 what is the impression 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:11.590
 of the payment card I say more important because this option of 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:13.559
 carnet printing 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.559
 she does not simply print the license 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:20.470
 the cattle generated in this impression of eating 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:22.769
 and automatically launched 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.089
 not financial 

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:27.179
 or the associate's registry 

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:29.429
 is updated with this information 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.169
 in your financial statement with all sides 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:33.480
 of this parcel 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.170
 for a future consultation of a collection of the world 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:37.460
 of the box then 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.970
 this is a complete option 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:41.600
 so come on 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.790
 and still have the move option 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:46.580
 car generation 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:49.580
 or by pressing the f11 key 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.680
 I have to inform the associate code if I do not get on the podium of the 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:55.460
 associated 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.210
 the same way that I have here in Europe 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.450
 digit part of the name of the associate mikhlif mohammed 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.870
 giving a touch it will be transported 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:08.860
 back to the inter 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:13.180
 the initial installment but this one I want to print the card of 12 parcels 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.760
 the first installment is a 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:20.280
 the second last installment will be the one of its own way of 12 parcels 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.180
 nothing interested print out the six-part credit card, a credit card of 24 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:26.370
 plots 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:29.670
 the date of maturity of the first installment 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.780
 Let's put it here. 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.409
 please note that no one has appeared here 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:38.140
 the plane that is disassociated 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.000
 the value 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
 This plot of land in the well will also have 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:44.700
 the base 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.520
 A.D 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:47.630
 this collor 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.050
 this basis here 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:52.780
 it is different from that base will have the registration of the associate 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.000
 this basis here 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.010
 it's the color sequence let's imagine a carney 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.350
 a contract that I decided to close in 2008 and March 2008 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.340
 probably this segment is the first path that the dam 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.989
 ended in March 2009 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.629
 March 2010 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:14.670
 Excuse me now it's more 2009 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.769
 we will be doing base 2 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:21.450
 we are going to leave for a contract that was signed in June 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:24.529
 on july 2008 

00:02:24.529 --> 00:02:28.370
 if the customer is coming pay his last installment and it's worth vale5 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:33.649
 the new carnet then that carney would be base two because it's his second kane 

00:02:33.649 --> 00:02:38.649
 this is a rule that we adopt in the printing of plots of the sixers but 

00:02:38.649 --> 00:02:40.709
 you can adopt your own rule 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:42.760
 for example you can put here 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:47.250
 that the basis of this eating is how it's come to do the carnage now in 2009 if 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.479
 put 11 9 

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:51.099
 eleven years 

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:52.399
 whatever 

00:02:52.399 --> 00:02:55.099
 put basic here 

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:59.569
 you will click here just know what to record or not in the financial 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:02.619
 notice that the generate button did not appear 

00:03:02.619 --> 00:03:04.259
 because of this here 

00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:07.589
 why do we have that financial record 

00:03:07.589 --> 00:03:11.889
 examples a girl that you print a ram had a lamb 

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:15.639
 previously informed the system 

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:20.699
 but for some reason having a printer error on the printer paper moscow paper 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:24.989
 in the end inside the problems 

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:27.589
 did not leave the paper 

00:03:27.589 --> 00:03:31.599
 much more the system recorded charged financial states 

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:35.179
 you're not going, you can tell him he's not going again 

00:03:35.179 --> 00:03:36.130
 inform him 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:38.629
 in works for the financial 

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:42.019
 because we already have the recordings armed duplicity 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:45.870
 even because the system will not accept to legalize already have this parcel 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:49.069
 registered but are time you will lose 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:51.090
 It's okay, let's say we do not 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.139
 in this case now I have to form singh 

00:03:54.139 --> 00:03:56.479
 command to generate note that the 

00:03:56.479 --> 00:04:01.339
 generate appeared but the print continued off it remains paid because not 

00:04:01.339 --> 00:04:02.949
 has nothing at all 

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:04.909
 but now I'm going to generate 

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:06.599
 I froze the button after 

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:08.319
 generate erased 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:09.879
 because I already gave 

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:11.829
 and lit print button 

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:15.169
 here are the plots I've got you asked for 

00:04:15.679 --> 00:04:20.199
 even so lucena can come here to make tracer than you cyclist who changed 

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:22.629
 Who said expiration date? 

00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:26.999
 and makes exit operation to imagine that in the first installment here you 

00:04:26.999 --> 00:04:31.619
 who discussed value giving of the part of membership that is 60 reais you place 

00:04:31.619 --> 00:04:33.279
 120 

00:04:33.279 --> 00:04:35.469
 send print 

00:04:35.469 --> 00:04:36.580
 Oh yes 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:41.879
 will appear on the screen the carnet five holds firm the first parcel 120 

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:44.129
 and the remaining 60 

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:45.439
 done that 

00:04:45.439 --> 00:04:47.930
 you can be participation 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:52.720
 will have three vans staging three sheets with four parcels each 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:53.290
 an 

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:55.789
 With your passing done that 

00:04:55.789 --> 00:04:57.949
 send print 

00:04:57.949 --> 00:04:59.919
 the same way first week others
