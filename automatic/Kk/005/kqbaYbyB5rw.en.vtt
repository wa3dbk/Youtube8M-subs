band<00:03:15.010> together<00:03:15.190> and<00:03:15.430> ask<00:03:15.700> for<00:03:15.940> that<00:03:16.090> because

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
band together and ask for that because

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.080 
band together and ask for that because
that's<00:03:17.500> generally<00:03:18.250> considered<00:03:18.910> good

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
that's generally considered good

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:20.970 
that's generally considered good
