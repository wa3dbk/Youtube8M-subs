00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 Hello dear friends with you 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:06.200
 Moscow some new here we 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.389
 pyshechka when 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:12.389
 admin decided stupidly to raise and recoup 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:15.269
 on us they somehow go and fuck everyone 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.400
 kerach how are you trying to do here 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.949
 it is necessary to hold on to someone who dreams of 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.439
 dude sitting doesn't move like u 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.000
 someone already does not remain but 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.250
 remember still like no one has never 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.720
 got here will take place at depth shoots 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.359
 by all here stay alive but it 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.189
 new more accurate under hawke sights behind him behind 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.050
 this with such and without the pale over there 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.309
 some kind of log sits by the way they can either 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.300
 either score more often 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:41.360
 I'll get a clear fucking couple of times and probably 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:44.160
 the easiest way was to take a parachute 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:47.129
 no helicopter to fly 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.930
 Well here I am fucking mascara to not 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:54.030
 It turned out how you can stand on 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:58.559
 place to run and then what have you Paul 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:01.320
 have seen what he does yes ok even with 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.120
 runaway is distributed on of course into the crowd then 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.489
 easier to get on most likely even with anyone 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.950
 for then super prepared 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.810
 professional fighters are so much so that they 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.600
 will be able to get capture you run here 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.460
 give me some shelter 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.740
 from that edge shoots years us us us 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.439
 no we have when Nina shoot like this 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.270
 put warrior huyaku I'm the only one 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.780
 Now think that I am gm or other 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:28.970
 fuck 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:32.650
 but actually i'm a defiant kind of blanche 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:35.030
 defiant kind of homeless who can still 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:37.460
 run away I can't run fast no I can 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:41.330
 can all of you are ok ok 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:44.360
 fill up this padla from filled up 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:46.730
 piled up spoon par rarahra ra ra pa 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:49.580
 da da da na na frames 

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:53.660
 what about when you target someone separately 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:57.050
 this is it mayhem comrades 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:58.250
 chaos going on some new 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.800
 place chosen but here apparently 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:03.170
 still a little bigger ground 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:06.110
 how much scourge left 50 pieces 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.340
 I need more than you even why they 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:13.010
 me all the same 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:15.320
 it is in my opinion not really win here 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:18.709
 he is alone or not two 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:19.250
 i'm tired wait i should rest 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:23.780
 relax 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:26.270
 they individually target the homeless 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:29.030
 but how can you not really you should 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:33.230
 shoot into the crowd and aim someone along 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:36.850
 one someone pushed me arrogant type 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:41.770
 I was able to push to run faster 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:41.770
 should everyone stopped 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.569
 while someone stops they too 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:49.030
 stop for generally conceived people 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:49.709
 the country has long disappeared enough i am not to 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.450
 that ran up 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:55.690
 how he washed away reached my enough 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:58.830
 not seen in some crowd finish off 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:01.510
 everyone and do not give a chance to someone to escape 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:05.530
 all of me for the first time finally hit 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:08.290
 but more precisely it is even a minus now everything 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:10.209
 I got this one okay 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:14.580
 here everybody laid down everybody leave me in 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:14.580
 alone stop beating me 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:22.439
 one-two warm-up the longer you run 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:24.090
 faster jump joke but the opposite 

00:03:22.439 --> 00:03:26.400
 the faster you run him you jump further 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:29.040
 but really no I'm not tired and why 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:32.939
 then don't run a damn let's go here 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:35.850
 here still crowd here not to run yet 

00:03:32.939 --> 00:03:39.180
 give me a flash around me 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:42.630
 you need to understand who stayed here for this 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:46.140
 things shoot a minus another minus further 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:48.180
 but still I am the penultimate to me 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:51.420
 it is cut down by the admin runs for sure 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:53.370
 checks who is here 4 what padla 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:55.650
 most likely that Hurwitz because 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:59.010
 he is dishonest he is from a gang to you only 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:00.990
 always honest and look for the law 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:03.270
 goes stupid to him and wants to endure it but 

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:04.260
 most likely his gun broke either 

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:06.570
 even easier 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:09.540
 and he will not be able to track down this 

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:10.140
 I went missing but now I just run 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:14.340
 here and there 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:18.110
 either he is aiming and this is a swap exchange 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:22.080
 Which can not get on the skin apparently 

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:25.100
 this is the kind left homeless which 

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:28.190
 survives any conditions and no he won 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:30.870
 everything has changed everything now I understand who 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:33.420
 now aiming will be aiming 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:39.540
 this was aiming me all over me now 

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:41.490
 exactly me so dishonest pablo i have to 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:42.889
 he probably did not see it, but rather 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:44.629
 just me now 

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:47.960
 and where do I have the dough at the beginning 

00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:50.569
 spent 2 that's pure for me straight 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:53.419
 I recovered but still I stayed though 

00:04:50.569 --> 00:04:56.479
 somehow there is the penultimate dinner 

00:04:53.419 --> 00:05:00.229
 bart would also not have kneaded me 

00:04:56.479 --> 00:05:02.060
 nothing attempt was honest so here 

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:07.460
 this man was also taken out for sure 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:13.759
 Opachki opachki those in eblet on dough at me 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:14.389
 answered the same in general almost immediately as I 

00:05:13.759 --> 00:05:17.220
 I will be a pine 

00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:19.080
 as well as a taxi 

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:21.840
 how much is on duty here 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:24.600
 how much to pay on honest ovens 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:27.420
 uh, wow, what a pretty little joke 

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:31.430
