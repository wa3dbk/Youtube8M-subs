00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:16.090
 the lip home office marcelo nilo was 

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:18.519
 This is another video from our channel. 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:20.259
 I brought you a tool today. 

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:23.470
 extremely versatile for you 

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:24.999
 know the rascal is there are many people who 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:28.359
 Do not you know, I'd say a lot of people 

00:00:24.999 --> 00:00:30.880
 even the rasp is a tool for 

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:32.020
 roughing for roughing 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.840
 wood 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:38.010
 she is she looks like a file 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:42.219
 but it has some differences 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.809
 aaaah lima the rasp has bigger teeth and 

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:47.019
 more spaced 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:49.120
 so if you fix your teeth they are 

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:51.250
 they are very aggressive 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:54.489
 it is precisely to wear the wood 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:58.539
 even it is manufactured in three formats 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:01:00.699
 I have different here that it is boring 

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:03.280
 is half cane one side and straight another side 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:06.760
 half a cane and there's this one that's 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:10.870
 round you make more details of it 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:14.440
 car or not, right? 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:16.660
 but she also has a 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:21.250
 aggressive texture that is precisely for 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:25.510
 wearing the wood is the rascal you 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:29.680
 use the way you hold rasp 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:32.830
 with both hands and will make a 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:35.920
 movement you want in the wood or 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:37.720
 will be inducing to rasp 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.740
 wear the way you want 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.470
 wear 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:44.350
 then you will necessarily go you will 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:47.440
 work with both hands and across the 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:49.510
 extension of it there you will ask 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:52.630
 because it has this crepe tape wrapped in the 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:55.210
 tip of the drug is this tape is rolled up 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:57.850
 that just like a tip for you 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:00.880
 that it is not to hurt the hand because as 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:04.329
 you use both hands 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:06.280
 It's interesting you have a protection. 

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:08.319
 I have here some examples where I 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.190
 I used the rasp to make some 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:10.690
 parts 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.730
 so here's why here for example 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:16.390
 an area of wood for you to use 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:19.540
 with the chisel is included is on our site 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:21.280
 have a tutorial showing one step to 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.800
 step of making this image 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:27.330
 May this was done is wearing 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:30.310
 excess with the serrano chisel and shiver 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:36.010
 rounded or that is what God really 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:37.989
 the shape in the piece was to gloss again 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:41.110
 I repeat the rasp will not finish 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:44.250
 fine she will give to shape and there 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:47.080
 then you sand and give the fine finish 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.870
 another another piece that is also 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:53.680
 here is also a video our site is 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:56.560
 Planing that this path is was made 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:59.739
 a piece that is massive and to be more 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:04.720
 anatomical this piece was all round with 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:06.910
 11 one a rascal and then was lynched and 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:09.100
 finally a joke that I did 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.660
 here I got a wood stump one 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.870
 square tokens 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:16.900
 I made a 45 degree mark in all 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:20.920
 creating a spiral and then used 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:23.859
 I used to have half a cane and I went 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:28.000
 making this spiral this spiral made 

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:30.250
 this spiral is achieved in this format 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.739
 so you can see the versatility of 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:35.380
 a rasp to wear wood 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:37.510
 logically here I made the wear of 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:39.510
 thing I scratched to get a texture 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.620
 thinner 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:45.310
 so it's a tool there 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:47.650
 extremely versatile and it 's cheap to 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:50.319
 you have in your workshop and you will 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:53.940
 realize that it will help you a lot 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:56.590
 hours to wedding date on wood 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:58.829
 Are you guys in the next video a great 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:58.829
 hug
