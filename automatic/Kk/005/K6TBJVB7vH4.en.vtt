00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
 hello with youtube with samsung galaxy 

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:07.529
 168 10 in that short film that I will show you 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.450
 how to edit the photos basically that 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.400
 default phone does not bring any 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.110
 application to edit products by 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.900
 so much sandra we will have to download a 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.210
 application I will recommend the one that 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.820
 I found that it appears as very useful 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.410
 There are several editing options but 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.820
 before I invite you to subscribe to me 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.160
 you can do it by clicking here 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.289
 down do not forget to subscribe and that 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.849
 way all my videos jump on 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.969
 contact me leave me questions 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.710
 comments suggestions we go to the 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:38.240
 first option we have measurements 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:41.330
 basically entering by the camera 

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:43.130
 if we enter the cell phone camera 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:45.770
 have a few options here 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:47.690
 edition that basically consist of 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:50.300
 they applied in very simple effects that 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:54.380
 are for example the black and white cable 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:58.390
 to the photo apply sepia or negative 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:01:00.770
 This makes most phones 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:03.850
 however, if we want to dismantle 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:06.500
 make a much more complete edition 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.550
 basically download a program like 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.620
 I told them 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:14.250
 and this is a program called photo 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:16.710
 editor this is an icon is a program 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.860
 that I recommend you basically enter 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.860
 the 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.759
 and basically the first thing we're going to 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.399
 to do is select the photo that 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:31.689
 suddenly we want to edit say that 

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:31.689
 we want to edit this dragon 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:38.510
 and he has already entered here in this he is 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:40.730
 returning the photo as such here 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:42.440
 We have several editing options as 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:45.850
 in the manipulation of the cones of the 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:48.700
 colors tones saturations of 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:52.160
 Exposure temperature brightness contrast 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:54.400
 among other things we will look at other 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.840
 things this is another option of 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.610
 manipulation of also the shades of 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.060
 the tonalities of the colors for this 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:04.280
 Soon you would have to know a little bit of 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:06.140
 this color chart usually the 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:09.229
 people who manage photoshop know 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:11.330
 interpret it here we can modify by 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:15.710
 example the red ones 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:18.260
 they are very interesting modifications of 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:20.270
 be modifications in the tasks by 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:23.030
 example this dracula is like blue if you 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:25.940
 they estimate we are going to modify the blue 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:28.820
 only the dragon's were to be 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:31.460
 modified only the tonality that 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:34.250
 we are interested and the other tones are 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:36.830
 remain intact other modifications are 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:39.610
 the effects with different effects that 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:42.300
 give us this tool 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:44.070
 as they are enough 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:46.920
 let's see other options for example 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:50.220
 it shows as we can see in this 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:53.820
 option we have too many options like 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:57.990
 degrease text cut clone create 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:03:00.540
 frames is basically set up and 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:02.820
 edit completely the photo is a 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:05.130
 application very good act I recommend you 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:07.770
 again it has more or less good 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:09.300
 millions of downloads so it's the 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:11.220
 first option the best option that I 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.900
 I would give to you in the case that 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:15.540
 would like to edit the photo 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.550
 using the samsung galaxy 168 and it would be 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.440
 practically downloading this 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:21.720
 application the favorite since 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:24.240
 normally if we enter them with the 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:26.670
 multimedia option that are very few 

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:29.370
 the options that we have on this side 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:32.820
 basically only gives the option is cut out 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:35.010
 inspire the image are not many 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:37.290
 options that we have when it comes to wanting 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:40.230
 modify the photo using only 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:42.390
 the cellphone only the corrector 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:45.230
 chaired next to subscribe to invite
