rather<00:02:44.420> not<00:02:45.420> getting<00:02:45.900> a<00:02:45.930> little<00:02:46.050> bit<00:02:46.260> louder

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
rather not getting a little bit louder

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.580 
rather not getting a little bit louder
now<00:02:47.090> if<00:02:48.090> you<00:02:48.269> do<00:02:48.450> develop<00:02:48.630> this<00:02:48.989> noise<00:02:49.260> if<00:02:49.500> you

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
now if you do develop this noise if you

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.860 
now if you do develop this noise if you
give<00:02:49.739> it<00:02:49.830> a<00:02:49.890> little<00:02:50.040> bit<00:02:50.250> rpm<00:02:50.819> which<00:02:51.569> I<00:02:51.720> don't

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
give it a little bit rpm which I don't

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.210 
give it a little bit rpm which I don't
have<00:02:52.019> a<00:02:52.049> second<00:02:52.440> person<00:02:52.739> to<00:02:52.830> do<00:02:52.980> right<00:02:53.190> now

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
have a second person to do right now

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:59.539 
have a second person to do right now
this<00:02:54.120> ticking<00:02:54.900> noise<00:02:55.080> should<00:02:55.290> change<00:02:58.549> there's

00:02:59.539 --> 00:02:59.549 
this ticking noise should change there's

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:03.699 
this ticking noise should change there's
also<00:02:59.880> a<00:03:01.160> BMW<00:03:02.160> Bolton<00:03:02.610> for<00:03:02.790> programming

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:03.709 
also a BMW Bolton for programming

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:07.400 
also a BMW Bolton for programming
related<00:03:04.709> to<00:03:04.860> a<00:03:04.890> ticking<00:03:05.370> noise<00:03:05.870> from<00:03:06.870> the<00:03:07.230> oil

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
related to a ticking noise from the oil

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:12.050 
related to a ticking noise from the oil
pressure<00:03:08.870> cell<00:03:09.870> annoyed<00:03:10.110> so<00:03:10.769> this<00:03:11.250> might<00:03:11.850> be

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
pressure cell annoyed so this might be

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.520 
pressure cell annoyed so this might be
able<00:03:12.209> to<00:03:12.390> be<00:03:12.510> fixed<00:03:12.720> with<00:03:12.900> programming

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
able to be fixed with programming

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.430 
able to be fixed with programming
although<00:03:13.739> it<00:03:13.890> does<00:03:14.069> sound<00:03:14.340> more<00:03:14.730> like<00:03:14.790> a

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
although it does sound more like a

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.130 
although it does sound more like a
lifter<00:03:16.440> tick<00:03:16.709> on<00:03:17.180> the<00:03:18.180> other<00:03:18.480> vehicle<00:03:18.930> that<00:03:19.109> I

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
lifter tick on the other vehicle that I

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.140 
lifter tick on the other vehicle that I
had<00:03:19.410> the<00:03:19.530> same<00:03:19.709> problem<00:03:20.190> on<00:03:20.340> the<00:03:20.700> programming

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
had the same problem on the programming

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.750 
had the same problem on the programming
was<00:03:21.420> done<00:03:21.480> and<00:03:22.019> it<00:03:22.320> did<00:03:22.500> it<00:03:22.980> did<00:03:23.190> not<00:03:23.370> correct

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
was done and it did it did not correct

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.569 
was done and it did it did not correct
the<00:03:23.880> problem<00:03:24.359> it<00:03:25.140> took<00:03:25.320> exhaust<00:03:26.190> lifters

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:26.579 
the problem it took exhaust lifters

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:32.830 
the problem it took exhaust lifters
actually<00:03:27.030> fixed<00:03:27.359> us

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:34.940 

that's<00:03:33.840> actually<00:03:34.200> getting<00:03:34.290> a<00:03:34.440> bit<00:03:34.590> loud<00:03:34.770> if

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
that's actually getting a bit loud if

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:48.040 
that's actually getting a bit loud if
there<00:03:35.160> goes

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:48.050 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:51.920 

you<00:03:49.050> can<00:03:49.230> hear<00:03:49.530> the<00:03:49.800> kick<00:03:50.400> change<00:03:50.850> as<00:03:51.270> it<00:03:51.690> comes

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
you can hear the kick change as it comes

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.059 
you can hear the kick change as it comes
down

00:03:55.059 --> 00:03:55.069 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:57.160 

so<00:03:55.670> this<00:03:55.909> definitely<00:03:56.239> sounds<00:03:56.569> like<00:03:56.750> the<00:03:56.870> same

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:57.170 
so this definitely sounds like the same

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:58.750 
so this definitely sounds like the same
one<00:03:57.379> that<00:03:57.409> I<00:03:57.560> had<00:03:57.799> so<00:03:58.010> this<00:03:58.159> is<00:03:58.280> the<00:03:58.370> second

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:58.760 
one that I had so this is the second

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.300 
one that I had so this is the second
vehicle<00:03:58.969> that<00:03:59.359> sounds<00:03:59.810> like<00:03:59.900> it<00:04:00.049> needs

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.310 
vehicle that sounds like it needs

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:04.300 
vehicle that sounds like it needs
exhaust<00:04:01.310> lifters<00:04:01.909> and<00:04:02.120> rockers<00:04:03.129> there's<00:04:04.129> no

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.310 
exhaust lifters and rockers there's no

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:06.599 
exhaust lifters and rockers there's no

service Bolton on this particular engine
it's<00:04:07.609> too<00:04:07.909> new<00:04:08.150> for<00:04:08.650> this<00:04:09.650> problem<00:04:09.950> but<00:04:10.659> if<00:04:11.659> you

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 
it's too new for this problem but if you

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.649 
it's too new for this problem but if you
do<00:04:12.019> run<00:04:12.230> into<00:04:12.379> this<00:04:12.620> on<00:04:12.829> year<00:04:13.099> and<00:04:13.359> 52

00:04:14.649 --> 00:04:14.659 
do run into this on year and 52

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:18.439 
do run into this on year and 52
T

00:04:18.439 --> 00:04:18.449 

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:20.569 

at<00:04:18.930> least<00:04:19.169> you'll<00:04:19.349> know<00:04:19.469> how<00:04:19.620> to<00:04:19.650> fix<00:04:19.919> it<00:04:20.129> or

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:20.579 
at least you'll know how to fix it or

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:24.820 
at least you'll know how to fix it or
tell<00:04:20.789> your<00:04:20.939> dealer<00:04:21.269> have<00:04:21.449> it<00:04:21.539> fix<00:04:21.749> it

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:24.830 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:26.649 

they'll<00:04:25.460> probably<00:04:25.639> come<00:04:25.970> out<00:04:26.090> with<00:04:26.240> a<00:04:26.270> service

00:04:26.649 --> 00:04:26.659 
they'll probably come out with a service

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:29.650 
they'll probably come out with a service
full<00:04:26.840> turn<00:04:27.050> at<00:04:27.169> some<00:04:27.379> point
