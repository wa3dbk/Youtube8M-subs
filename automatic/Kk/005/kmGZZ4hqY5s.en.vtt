definitely two good options to how I'm
gonna<00:05:36.340> have<00:05:36.640> to<00:05:36.850> decide<00:05:37.630> which<00:05:37.870> striker<00:05:38.200> or

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:38.500 
gonna have to decide which striker or

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:40.140 
gonna have to decide which striker or
maybe<00:05:38.950> I<00:05:39.040> will<00:05:39.130> get<00:05:39.340> a<00:05:39.370> right<00:05:39.610> wing<00:05:39.760> and<00:05:39.910> next

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:40.150 
maybe I will get a right wing and next

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:42.000 
maybe I will get a right wing and next
around<00:05:40.419> when<00:05:40.720> we're<00:05:40.870> getting<00:05:41.080> the<00:05:41.169> informs

go<00:05:43.540> from<00:05:43.720> the<00:05:44.020> kickoff<00:05:44.169> really<00:05:45.100> poor

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:45.280 
go from the kickoff really poor

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:46.710 
go from the kickoff really poor
defending<00:05:45.610> from<00:05:45.910> me<00:05:46.090> but<00:05:46.300> that<00:05:46.419> is<00:05:46.540> how<00:05:46.660> the

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:46.720 
defending from me but that is how the

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:49.740 
defending from me but that is how the
game<00:05:46.960> would<00:05:47.110> finish<00:05:47.580> 74<00:05:48.580> so<00:05:48.820> 11<00:05:49.300> girls<00:05:49.419> in<00:05:49.660> that

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:49.750 
game would finish 74 so 11 girls in that

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:51.390 
game would finish 74 so 11 girls in that
much<00:05:49.990> amazing<00:05:50.530> game<00:05:50.800> you<00:05:50.950> could<00:05:51.070> see<00:05:51.220> they

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:51.400 
much amazing game you could see they

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:52.980 
much amazing game you could see they
already<00:05:51.550> had<00:05:51.760> fainting<00:05:52.150> shots<00:05:52.330> on<00:05:52.450> target<00:05:52.479> I

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:52.990 
already had fainting shots on target I

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:54.780 
already had fainting shots on target I
say<00:05:53.410> only<00:05:53.680> I<00:05:53.740> think<00:05:54.100> we've<00:05:54.310> had<00:05:54.430> games<00:05:54.669> where

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:54.790 
say only I think we've had games where

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:56.430 
say only I think we've had games where
I've<00:05:55.000> had<00:05:55.030> like<00:05:55.210> 15<00:05:55.630> shots<00:05:55.900> on<00:05:56.050> target<00:05:56.080> and

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:56.440 
I've had like 15 shots on target and

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:58.770 
I've had like 15 shots on target and
only<00:05:56.590> scored<00:05:56.830> twice<00:05:57.100> so<00:05:57.790> I<00:05:57.820> mean<00:05:58.180> it<00:05:58.450> can<00:05:58.600> show

00:05:58.770 --> 00:05:58.780 
only scored twice so I mean it can show

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:00.630 
only scored twice so I mean it can show
if<00:05:58.900> you<00:05:58.990> can<00:05:59.140> finish<00:05:59.290> your<00:05:59.410> dinner<00:05:59.830> nicely<00:06:00.490> you

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:00.640 
if you can finish your dinner nicely you

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:02.490 
if you can finish your dinner nicely you
can<00:06:00.669> get<00:06:01.419> some<00:06:01.570> nice<00:06:01.750> phone<00:06:02.020> high-scoring

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:02.500 
can get some nice phone high-scoring

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:04.320 
can get some nice phone high-scoring

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:53.320 
easily and if we want to pick up some of
the<00:06:51.650> more<00:06:51.770> expensive<00:06:51.950> informs<00:06:52.790> I<00:06:52.880> mean<00:06:53.000> I<00:06:53.120> said

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:53.330 
the more expensive informs I mean I said

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:54.610 
the more expensive informs I mean I said
in<00:06:53.450> an<00:06:53.540> episode<00:06:53.750> before<00:06:53.990> that<00:06:54.260> I<00:06:54.290> want<00:06:54.410> to<00:06:54.500> try

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:54.620 
in an episode before that I want to try

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:56.560 
in an episode before that I want to try
and<00:06:54.710> get<00:06:54.830> been<00:06:54.980> offering<00:06:55.310> his<00:06:55.520> informs<00:06:55.970> cost

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:56.570 
and get been offering his informs cost

00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:58.630 
and get been offering his informs cost
about<00:06:57.140> 100k<00:06:57.710> for<00:06:57.920> the<00:06:57.980> best<00:06:58.160> one<00:06:58.280> I<00:06:58.340> think<00:06:58.400> it

00:06:58.630 --> 00:06:58.640 
about 100k for the best one I think it

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:00.760 
about 100k for the best one I think it
isn't<00:06:58.730> about<00:06:58.940> 70<00:06:59.480> but<00:06:59.720> the<00:06:59.840> first<00:07:00.230> lien<00:07:00.470> form

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:00.770 
isn't about 70 but the first lien form

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:03.010 
isn't about 70 but the first lien form
so<00:07:01.100> that's<00:07:01.910> going<00:07:02.120> to<00:07:02.180> take<00:07:02.330> a<00:07:02.510> lot<00:07:02.720> of<00:07:02.780> trading

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:03.020 
so that's going to take a lot of trading

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:04.390 
so that's going to take a lot of trading
to<00:07:03.200> get<00:07:03.350> to<00:07:03.500> but<00:07:03.680> hopefully<00:07:04.100> we'll<00:07:04.190> be<00:07:04.250> able<00:07:04.280> to

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:05.950 
to get to but hopefully we'll be able to
do<00:07:04.490> that<00:07:04.640> we're<00:07:04.790> gonna<00:07:04.850> make<00:07:05.060> some<00:07:05.120> amazing
