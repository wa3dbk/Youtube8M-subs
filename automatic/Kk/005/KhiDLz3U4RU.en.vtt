 really to sell various sneakers and 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.419
 they leave everything is a process of everything has 

00:00:21.329 --> 00:00:26.159
 why do we have here the different 

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:29.279
 materials for example we have the 

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:32.040
 hearts like before it comes out that very

 dirty very fast and the need this 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.840
 process if they are 11 am well because nothing 

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:48.059
 more is to put tension with the law of 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.760
 put forward later he was 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.679

 here a jordan and holograms so that 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.970
 know also the process of what is 

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:04.040
 the part of the 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:05.750
 the merchants are completely 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.630
 dirty 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:11.870
 for you to see the before and the 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:13.420
 then we are going to put a little bit 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:16.869
 to box 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:20.610
 and with the technology that will be given 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:22.770
 how are they really dirty 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.120
 It is important that you know the 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.430
 process we are going to give you here some 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:29.720
 small tips so they can clean and 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:32.260
 your sneakers fit 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.260
 d 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.960
 how is it 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:44.670
 by last 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.670
 the most famous and beloved 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:51.380
 let's start with this really the 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:53.240
 process is very simple we have here with 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.370
 the two types of shampoo sneakers that 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.650
 They are made with simple time products 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:02:00.650
 Mexicans and natives who also help 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:04.160
 not just to clean out they help 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:05.870
 nourish and encourage the publication of materials 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:09.140
 that is important so that nothing 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:10.910
 more is the roller and it is no longer no 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.580
 to give you a performance and have 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:16.250
 a better life three sneakers do not last them 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:18.500
 and they hold more here the first thing we're going 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.840
 to start do with a brush and asia 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:24.200
 same brush that I bring shampoo 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:26.540
 let's go to Seville we're going to brush 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.280
 let's remove the excess dust because 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.840
 because with the same gentleman or even the 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:35.620
 water that falls is going to stain more 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:38.520
 and we will remove excess dust 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:41.430
 why 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:43.170
 and the process is easier we show you 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:46.200
 neither 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:48.090
 They realize it was a little dust and 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.970
 The process of the technique is as follows 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:54.300
 you only need the brush that brings a 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.650
 rag either cotton or a 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:58.530
 Microfiber that is like this 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:05.650
 supposedly so much indicated of this we 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:11.400
 touch this sale is the one we're going to before 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:11.400
 big / process is going to spray 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:18.990
 to take our brush we are going to put it 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:22.800
 water let's shake that is 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:24.200
 important the law we went and we started 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:27.260
 the process 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:30.470
 you do not have to do pumas or ride 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:33.110
 these products are not to do 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:37.000
 foams do not know if you realize 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:39.250
 there is no more 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:43.050
 we can apply 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:43.050
 again sneakers album 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:47.040
 and we are going to do the washing 

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:56.030
 we go back to do entered 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:04.280
 and the company and it is known that it is 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:04.280
 really make circles 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:12.780
 we are going to clean them 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:18.989
 and let's go 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:27.569
 eye here on topics 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:41.639
 materials and it's more difficult 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:52.020
 occasionally shallow so that 

00:04:48.599 --> 00:04:52.020
 appear clean 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:56.280
 and we are 

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:02.570
 we clean 

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:09.670
 and good here is relative we are going to 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:12.480
 explain 

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:12.480
 Now that you are 

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:18.169
 we used to put them on top of 

00:05:16.459 --> 00:05:20.449
 our country 

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:23.079
 we avoid staining the park is in 

00:05:20.449 --> 00:05:23.079
 the bottom part 

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:29.040
 really the process is the simple 

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:37.110
 and well we ended up here with 

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:39.710
 from the first to the block 

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:43.930
 you see the change 

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:43.930
 if we do not even take five minutes 

00:05:45.849 --> 00:05:48.849
 do not 

00:06:00.759 --> 00:06:03.759
 do not 

00:06:12.169 --> 00:06:15.759
 or not
