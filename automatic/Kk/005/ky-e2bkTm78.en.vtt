00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
early on we made the decision that it

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:21.170 
early on we made the decision that it
was<00:01:15.510> just<00:01:15.750> going<00:01:15.930> to<00:01:15.990> be<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.290> three<00:01:16.530> of<00:01:16.620> us<00:01:20.180> you

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
was just going to be the three of us you

was just going to be the three of us you
know<00:01:21.210> we<00:01:21.390> decided<00:01:21.810> to<00:01:21.870> keep<00:01:22.020> leaning<00:01:22.320> in<00:01:22.530> me

know we decided to keep leaning in me
and<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.070> reason<00:01:23.550> we<00:01:23.820> could<00:01:23.970> do<00:01:24.090> that<00:01:24.240> quite

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:24.510 
and the reason we could do that quite

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:29.789 
and the reason we could do that quite
frankly<00:01:24.810> was<00:01:25.110> because<00:01:25.440> the<00:01:25.620> red
