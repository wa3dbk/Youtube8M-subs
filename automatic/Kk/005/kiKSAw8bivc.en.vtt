00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.410
 who was good enough like one 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:11.090
 so on the other hand we were played with 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:15.139
 a team that is a little bit 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:18.340
 we ahead of the number of workouts 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:23.090
 they already have the qualifying game of the Champions League 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:26.869
 didn't play a very good team on 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:29.000
 my players are purely physically you 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:32.830
 seen very very decent we today 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:38.300
 gave much more play 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:40.730
 almost all players but on 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:44.000
 today is like starting 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:45.610
 roster some whole game maximum 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.230
 played 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:50.989
 some 70 minutes more 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:53.360
 got playing time is we 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:55.579
 Planned like this and so very 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.739
 good brain idle talked on such an episode 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:59.809
 turned out in the middle of the first half when 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:02.270
 there was a penalty there order right punch 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:08.240
 fought and leonardo and maxims went 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:11.570
 team first wrong next 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.290
 since we will specifically assign a player 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:17.120
 which the 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:21.750
 will beat altogether here perfectly 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:23.820
 misunderstood leonardo he didn't 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.550
 had to fit a sword and because 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:31.820
 previous or bill maxim he scored 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:35.130
 and don't bother him he already took the sword 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:37.920
 bluetouch punching whining was my mistake 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:43.340
 later they did not nominate the player i wanted 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:47.580
 see how they figure it out and 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:49.560
 see who is more confident at 17 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.960
 meter but if one person takes it 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.390
 the other should not fit and that is 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.970
 football law football rules and 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.950
 pull the gap so short it was 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.990
 between two games and which ones are not 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.400
 changes may be noticed although it is unlikely 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.150
 probably could be replaced 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:06.720
 change big first played better 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:10.619
 it is better 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:16.790
 Veroli already more intense game was 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:20.670
 than previous not bad in my opinion 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:23.910
 coped in defense except here 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:27.620
 of this episode which is of course random 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:33.300
 the ball flew between your legs through filming 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:36.980
 who asked us a goal so than 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:40.370
 positive such mood 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:46.850
 iraq i liked my dedication 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:46.850
 its movement mac I like
