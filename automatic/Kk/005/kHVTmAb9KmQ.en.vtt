like<00:04:48.889> female<00:04:49.370> impersonators<00:04:50.120> playing<00:04:50.419> do<00:04:50.540> I

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:50.660 
like female impersonators playing do I

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:51.879 
like female impersonators playing do I
think<00:04:50.840> that's<00:04:50.990> what<00:04:51.110> he<00:04:51.290> said<00:04:51.530> if<00:04:51.650> you're<00:04:51.860> a

00:04:51.879 --> 00:04:51.889 
think that's what he said if you're a

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:54.400 
think that's what he said if you're a
dame<00:04:52.250> you've<00:04:52.760> got<00:04:53.000> certain<00:04:53.750> kind<00:04:53.930> of<00:04:54.020> feminine

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:54.410 
dame you've got certain kind of feminine

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:56.110 
dame you've got certain kind of feminine
traits<00:04:54.710> or<00:04:54.889> but<00:04:55.070> you<00:04:55.160> know<00:04:55.250> the<00:04:55.400> out<00:04:55.580> the

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:56.120 
traits or but you know the out the

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:58.180 
traits or but you know the out the
outward<00:04:56.510> appearance<00:04:56.540> with<00:04:57.410> the<00:04:57.620> boobs<00:04:57.889> and

00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:58.190 
outward appearance with the boobs and

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:01.330 
outward appearance with the boobs and
the<00:04:58.280> dress<00:04:58.610> but<00:04:59.300> there's<00:04:59.840> a<00:04:59.919> robustness<00:05:00.919> about

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:01.340 
the dress but there's a robustness about

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:03.760 
the dress but there's a robustness about
a<00:05:01.370> day<00:05:01.639> and<00:05:01.880> you're<00:05:02.780> a<00:05:02.810> clown<00:05:03.139> essentially<00:05:03.710> I

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:03.770 
a day and you're a clown essentially I

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:05.710 
a day and you're a clown essentially I
think<00:05:04.130> that's<00:05:04.460> how<00:05:04.550> I<00:05:04.580> play<00:05:04.940> I<00:05:05.180> think<00:05:05.210> although

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:05.720 
think that's how I play I think although

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:07.270 
think that's how I play I think although
you've<00:05:06.169> got<00:05:06.290> women's<00:05:06.530> colors<00:05:06.770> on<00:05:06.860> your<00:05:06.889> are<00:05:07.250> a

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:07.280 
you've got women's colors on your are a

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:10.030 
you've got women's colors on your are a
clam<00:05:07.760> whereas<00:05:08.570> I<00:05:08.660> think<00:05:08.690> in<00:05:09.169> female

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:10.040 
clam whereas I think in female

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:12.520 
clam whereas I think in female
impersonators<00:05:10.419> it's<00:05:11.419> the<00:05:11.690> illusion<00:05:12.380> that

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:12.530 
impersonators it's the illusion that

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:14.529 
impersonators it's the illusion that
