 carambatv represents 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:11.670
 hello friends with you denis semenihin and 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.349
 today I promised to tell you about 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.880
 nutrition in order to manage your 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.300
 physical fitness and nutrition need 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.070
 understand a few basic things first 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:22.470
 energy is contained and carried to human 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.270
 body for all 3 compounds are proteins 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:28.060
 carbohydrates and fats 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:29.380
 proteins is the building material of all 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.940
 human body tissue 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:32.830
 but first of all it is natural muscles 

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:37.020
 proteins are contained in animal products 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:41.559
 origin like eggs curd 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:44.440
 chicken fish poultry meat but it is important to choose 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:45.850
 non-fatty foods that is minimal 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:50.020
 the amount of fat if cottage cheese 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:53.020
 then 0 if eggs then we eat protein 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:55.970
 throw away the yolk 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:58.380
 gram of pure protein 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:00.540
 carbohydrates are the main source of energy 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:03.450
 for the human body is of two types 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:06.330
 simple and complex complex carbohydrates 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:10.400
 all kinds of groups like buckwheat rice 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:12.780
 oats simple carbohydrates are fruits and juices 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.430
 sweets in nutrition need to do 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.000
 necessarily focus specifically on complex 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.820
 carbohydrates 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.190
 and simple carbohydrates to minimize 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.790
 regardless of your goals rule 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:22.790
 always like that 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:30.119
 fats are the most energy-intensive component 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:32.280
 food but energy is bad slow 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.049
 there are so-called healthy fats 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.479
 for example contained in fish or 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.040
 vegetable fats but even their body 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.670
 a person needs only a minimum 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.159
 quantity 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.500
 the golden rule is half a gram in 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.540
 day at 1 kilogram of body weight that is 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.670
 if you weigh 80 kilograms for example then 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.890
 you only need 40 grams per day 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.930
 fat and now let's talk about norms 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.509
 consumption as soon as you start 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.940
 exercise your protein intake in 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.610
 day must be at least one and a half 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.149
 grams per kilogram of body weight is 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.399
 minimum 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.780
 the norm I consider 2 grams of protein per 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.539
 a kilogram of body weight that is for example 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.100
 if you weigh 80 kilograms then your 

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:09.209
 protein intake per day should be 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.280
 160 grams 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.900
 I don't think I need to take more 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.550
 squirrel no matter how active you are 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.050
 but there are people who are not with me 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.730
 agree who believes that you can 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.630
 take and trigram 4 grams per 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.640
 kilogram of body weight 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.500
 guys don't get too squirrels too 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.510
 seriously it can get you sideways i 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.819
 Now I weigh 100 3 kilograms per day 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.590
 eating 200 grams of protein is quite me 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:30.570
 Enough in intense workouts further 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.579
 carbohydrates are friends here and 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:35.070
 contains the key to physical form 

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:36.750
 exactly the amount of carbohydrates you will be 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:38.130
 regulate but consumption rates 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.290
 carbohydrate varies greatly in 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:43.680
 depending on the goal if your goal is set 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:47.190
 muscle mass then carbohydrate intake can 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:49.799
 reach 6 7 grams per day on 1 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.630
 a kilogram of body weight that is my life 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:54.000
 for example there were times when I ate up 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:55.590
 700 grams of carbohydrates per day and then 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.959
 when I tried to increase the maximum 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.820
 weight and weighed 120 kilograms but remember 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:02.160
 that even with such a high reception 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:04.620
 carbohydrate main focus you do 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.450
 it is on complex carbohydrates not on sugar 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.820
 juices and fruits now take another 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.920
 subcutaneous fat burning task 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:13.739
 this task is also achieved by 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:16.500
 carbohydrate in this case you reduce 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:19.290
 carbohydrate intake to two grams per day 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.880
 1 kg of body weight I do not advise you 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.910
 sink below because it is inevitable 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.140
 will cause a slowdown in metabolism and 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:28.109
 lack of energy per se in order 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:29.940
 to exercise remember that any 

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:31.410
 muscle mass look only case 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.640
 minimum amount of fat all 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:36.269
 the rest is nonsense 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:37.260
 extra fats for 8 completely extra thing 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:39.299
 extra legs 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.950
 performs no function beyond that 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:43.950
 that just being able to make you more 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:45.959
 frost sky and so on carbohydrates maximum 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:48.090
 it is 7 grams per kilogram of body weight in 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:49.620
 a day at least 2 grams but for 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.689
 most of you have it will lie 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:53.819
 somewhere around four five grams on 

00:03:51.689 --> 00:03:56.549
 kilogram of body weight in this case you have 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:57.209
 and muscles will grow and fat will not 

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:59.190
 add on 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:00.690
 but if you suddenly notice that in 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:03.510
 the result of the food you 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:04.980
 chose all the same fat grows right there 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.900
 reduce the amount of carbohydrates and 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:08.959
 find your middle ground and still have 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:11.700
 one major rule on carbohydrate 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:13.920
 maximize their reception on the first 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:16.079
 half day easier to put it in the evening 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:18.030
 never gorge on carbohydrates even 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:19.489
 if your goal is muscle gain and 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:21.209
 now let's talk about all sorts of 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:23.100
 food supplements 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:24.930
 if you come to any sports 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:27.389
 the store you will see a huge amount 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:29.669
 all sorts of products a lot of cans 

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:31.310
 which is naturally considering your spicy 

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:33.539
 desire to put yourself in great shape 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:36.000
 it seems that this is all you need to drink and 

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:38.520
 then there will be happiness guys now 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.860
 we will understand in more detail I will tell 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:42.389
 about the main products and you yourself 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:44.490
 decide for yourself what you might be 

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:47.270
 useful and that you are completely useless 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:49.289
 so let's start one of the oldest species 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:50.880
 sports nutrition or supplementary 

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:52.620
 nutrition is the so -called protein 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:54.599
 cocktails are meant for those people 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:56.370
 who for one reason or another cannot 

00:04:54.599 --> 00:04:57.720
 get enough with food 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:00.419
 protein that is can not eat so much 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:00.960
 egg whites or curd or meat or 

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:02.760
 Chicken 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:04.289
 to dial those same 2 grams on 

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:06.030
 kilogram of body weight for those and 

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:08.310
 targeted protein shakes 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:11.460
 then there is such a thing as amino acids 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:13.590
 there are liquid happens in capsules that 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:16.169
 such an amino acid is pre 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:18.150
 split protein molecules so 

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:19.919
 they digest faster 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:21.810
 human body and come faster 

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:24.900
 into working muscles but essentially their 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:26.370
 amino acids are the same proteins further there 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:29.039
 such a thing as all sorts of 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:30.810
 energy capsule is a capsule 

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:32.550
 containing large 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:34.159
 concentrations such components as 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:37.770
 caffeine and taurine 

00:05:34.159 --> 00:05:40.560
 creatine ginseng and a bunch of all sorts of 

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:42.750
 components associated with outliers 

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:44.699
 mental nervous and physical energy 

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:46.889
 in humans, their goal is natural 

00:05:44.699 --> 00:05:47.889
 make the workout more explosive and 

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:50.229
 more 

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:52.300
 energy so let's say I personally do not 

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:53.800
 I feel the effect of these capsules 

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:54.310
 try maybe you somehow it 

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:56.499
 will cheer up 

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:58.479
 then there is another kind of food 

00:05:56.499 --> 00:06:01.389
 called functional nutrition or 

00:05:58.479 --> 00:06:04.539
 the so -called food for life is food 

00:06:01.389 --> 00:06:06.219
 in which in correct or optimal 

00:06:04.539 --> 00:06:08.379
 proportions combine all the components 

00:06:06.219 --> 00:06:10.029
 proteins fats carbohydrates vitamins minerals 

00:06:08.379 --> 00:06:11.860
 remember at the beginning of the video I told you about 

00:06:10.029 --> 00:06:13.719
 the fact that I am now eating 200 grams 

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:15.340
 carbohydrates per day and 200 grams of proteins in 

00:06:13.719 --> 00:06:16.960
 The most interesting day is that this proportion 

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:19.749
 very easy to maintain in the first 

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:21.009
 half day but in the evening observe this 

00:06:19.749 --> 00:06:22.779
 proportions becomes just 

00:06:21.009 --> 00:06:24.879
 catastrophically difficult because 

00:06:22.779 --> 00:06:26.319
 the body is trying to trick me not 

00:06:24.879 --> 00:06:28.360
 any person at all who sits on 

00:06:26.319 --> 00:06:29.830
 diet and you want your hands are drawn to something 

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:31.840
 wrong in this case 

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:34.270
 functional nutrition helps to drink 

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:36.490
 cocktail and know exactly what the proportions are all 

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:38.590
 met correctly and there is no skew 

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:40.810
 towards excess carbohydrates that guys 

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:42.939
 in principle, everything about nutrition you understand 

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:44.979
 in five minutes you will not tell everything in detail 

00:06:42.939 --> 00:06:47.139
 if you have any questions then answers you 

00:06:44.979 --> 00:06:49.569
 find in my book a fitness guide for life 

00:06:47.139 --> 00:06:51.249
 and nutrition training but we haven't 

00:06:49.569 --> 00:06:54.779
 time back to the topics of a healthy way 

00:06:51.249 --> 00:06:54.779
 life in this blog see
