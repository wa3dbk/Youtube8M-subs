00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:08.520
 in this type of chapter games 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.170
 past we have played but now it seems 

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:11.400
 that we have to get into a ship and 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.759
 do some missions and we 're just going 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.759
 to play 

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:26.329
 and basically what he said we're 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:27.860
 gaining our freedom and that is 

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:29.360
 we work with the police to 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:30.410
 it seems they will rid us of all 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:31.759
 our charges that we made of the 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:32.960
 previous games we will be free 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:34.370
 we have four options to enter the 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.739
 aircraft we have to deal with some 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:41.290
 hearing aids a cannon ball a little hand 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:41.290
 sticky and a tail as I know 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:52.909
 me and nobody else because we have 33 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:55.300
 functions today we have the laser although the 

00:00:52.909 --> 00:00:55.300
 First 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.260
 with the rocket 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.630
 I 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.170
 Turbo 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:24.700
 there are thorns that did not work execute me 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:27.820
 john 

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:34.030
 I blow 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:39.420
 because then the one who is here the 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:42.070
 right that it was not related to 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.530
 this as inhabitants 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:47.500
 ok the beats gave me a super power in 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:50.460
 the butt obviously the 20 step because 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.460
 we have the apt 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.990
 that we are occupying technotrans be not 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.679
 I know what the fuck this is like legs 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.679
 electronic 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:10.209
 damn because it's definitely the 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.709
 rocket but leave it to the end because 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:14.190
 I do not think the rocket works but I think 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:14.190
 that will work 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.640
 to the ground to fly 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:25.230
 let's choose the knife as the 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.440
 bombs 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:52.270
 netbooks or as we already have boots with 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.760
 projectiles or something like that we have one thing 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:57.760
 to fly and we have meat or meat like 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.350
 proteins not my muscles or the 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:02.410
 prototypical if they eat a lot of protein that 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:03.730
 explode the leg let's play the jets and 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:07.530
 this is possibly going to be 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.530
 definitely this thing to fly 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.239
 because it was the most obvious 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.959
 the only thing we have to do now is 

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:20.220
 deliver to the damn we have three 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:22.909
 face options to the damn we're going to 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.909
 occupy a missile 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:36.610
 that little helicopter the size of a 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:37.930
 little finger killed every giant plane because 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:39.430
 I think I 'm understanding here there's a 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.409
 line as a divisor walk we will have to 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:43.540
 choose whether to be the bad guys or to be the good guys 

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:45.400
 be and deliver to the bad or convert us 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.569
 the villain I say we become 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:50.749
 in the villain 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:53.090
 then we have like some fake dolls 

00:03:50.749 --> 00:03:55.480
 to distract the tough guys all 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:55.480
 potatoes 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:00.680
 the betrayals I am the king of the 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.680
 villains 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.750
 if we are going to try again the 

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:09.510
 game with different options to see 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:09.510
 what are we going to try on this thing 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:17.139
 Let's try to see what is this a 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:19.209
 is a clock is to create a bomb or a no 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:22.260
 I know what the hell is that we're going to choose the 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:22.260
 most boring option that are expected 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:27.060
 because missions ok we go to the computer 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:29.930
 First 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.930
 secret files 

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:37.610
 and we started playing a game of 

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:40.610
 computer definitely no night watchman 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:40.610
 God 

00:04:40.689 --> 00:04:45.729
 because then we go for the 

00:04:42.519 --> 00:04:46.959
 ventilation I doubt it works 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:49.299
 because basically it says we're going to 

00:04:46.959 --> 00:04:52.229
 cross like this flying with your hands like this 

00:04:49.299 --> 00:04:52.229
 let's choose the magic pencil 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:05:02.539
 this is so right I do not know why I think 

00:04:59.069 --> 00:05:02.539
 that is going to be the right one and I'm going to pa 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:07.360
 because we have a magic capita of more 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:09.430
 of magician 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:12.970
 we have hack the door we can occupy 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:16.830
 a power endurance or we can make a 

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:16.830
 good paper let's try 

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:25.030
 today we are going to hack the door or if 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:25.030
 hacking 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:31.270
 So today let's put the glove 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:31.270
 probably 

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:38.790
 I do not know I do not know what the fuck is this but 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:41.230
 probably good is going to be the right one 

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:43.860
 I'm rewarding 

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:43.860
 gray 

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:50.280
 this logic game or we have three 

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:52.230
 options to steal the diamond now is 

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:54.210
 than grabbing them with tweezers with a 

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:58.070
 shrink now apparently or with a table 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:58.070
 of gravity though the gravity gun 

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:02.740
 it probably works 

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:14.419
 today 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:16.689
 that can rescue what I'm going to die 

00:06:14.419 --> 00:06:21.740
 which we want 

00:06:16.689 --> 00:06:26.360
 a little bit of Mario Bros and I'm safe 

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:26.360
 with the power armor or something like that 

00:06:27.419 --> 00:06:30.419
 3 

00:06:31.889 --> 00:06:36.740
 he served his victory gave less 

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:47.880
 or are struggling because I was a woman 

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:47.880
 fighting there 

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:55.359
 I 

00:06:52.359 --> 00:06:55.359
 I 

00:06:56.689 --> 00:06:59.499
 good because I 

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:09.810
 or they let me go with the diamond 

00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:16.780
 the final two probably there 

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:17.830
 many more endings but we're going to 

00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:21.030
 throw us back but you liked it 

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:21.030
 nothing that many want 

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:29.670
 you can not save her 

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:30.910
 even if you take them out of here then 

00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:34.410
 what 

00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:34.410
 how much will happen before
