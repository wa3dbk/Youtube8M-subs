00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
I can get some new stuff so let's take a

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.789 
I can get some new stuff so let's take a
look<00:00:11.250> at<00:00:11.370> some<00:00:11.519> of<00:00:11.580> the<00:00:11.639> buildings<00:00:12.059> so<00:00:12.840> first

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
look at some of the buildings so first

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.700 
look at some of the buildings so first
of<00:00:13.980> all<00:00:14.099> I<00:00:14.160> can<00:00:14.730> get<00:00:14.940> three<00:00:15.570> more<00:00:15.719> mines<00:00:16.020> which

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
of all I can get three more mines which

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.340 
of all I can get three more mines which
brings<00:00:16.980> the<00:00:17.070> total<00:00:17.100> to<00:00:17.369> 6<00:00:17.670> now<00:00:17.850> and<00:00:18.779> then<00:00:19.050> so

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
brings the total to 6 now and then so

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:20.630 
brings the total to 6 now and then so
I'm<00:00:19.439> just<00:00:19.529> going<00:00:19.680> to<00:00:19.740> place<00:00:20.010> them<00:00:20.310> along<00:00:20.340> the

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
I'm just going to place them along the

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.509 
I'm just going to place them along the
front<00:00:21.119> here<00:00:21.230> which<00:00:22.230> I'll<00:00:22.410> help<00:00:22.619> out<00:00:22.769> with<00:00:23.130> my

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
front here which I'll help out with my

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.080 
front here which I'll help out with my
base<00:00:23.880> defense

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:26.090 
base defense

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:29.450 
base defense
so<00:00:27.090> what<00:00:27.359> servers<00:00:27.720> offline<00:00:28.080> I<00:00:28.500> also<00:00:28.680> have<00:00:29.099> a

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
so what servers offline I also have a

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.420 
so what servers offline I also have a
resource<00:00:30.420> island<00:00:30.990> which<00:00:31.320> brings<00:00:31.650> me<00:00:31.859> more

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
resource island which brings me more

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.049 
resource island which brings me more
wood<00:00:32.700> arm<00:00:33.059> more<00:00:33.930> wood<00:00:34.200> in<00:00:34.440> on<00:00:34.739> a<00:00:34.770> boat<00:00:35.059> which

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
wood arm more wood in on a boat which

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.400 
wood arm more wood in on a boat which
helps<00:00:36.360> out<00:00:36.510> a<00:00:36.540> lot<00:00:36.719> with<00:00:36.899> the<00:00:37.020> cost<00:00:37.230> of

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
helps out a lot with the cost of

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.420 
helps out a lot with the cost of
buildings<00:00:37.800> and<00:00:38.390> so<00:00:39.390> moving<00:00:39.540> on<00:00:40.219> let's<00:00:41.219> take<00:00:41.370> a

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
buildings and so moving on let's take a

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.920 
buildings and so moving on let's take a
look<00:00:41.700> at<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:42.030> new<00:00:42.420> support<00:00:43.370> buildings<00:00:44.370> I<00:00:44.930> can

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
look at the new support buildings I can

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.720 
look at the new support buildings I can
build<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.170> landing<00:00:46.500> craft<00:00:46.770> so<00:00:47.160> I'll<00:00:47.399> go<00:00:47.700> ahead

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
build the landing craft so I'll go ahead

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.619 
build the landing craft so I'll go ahead
and<00:00:48.180> do<00:00:48.539> this<00:00:48.750> now<00:00:49.010> and<00:00:50.010> you<00:00:50.640> may<00:00:51.239> have<00:00:51.329> seen

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
and do this now and you may have seen

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.979 
and do this now and you may have seen
just<00:00:52.050> then<00:00:52.289> that<00:00:52.590> I<00:00:52.770> can<00:00:53.129> also<00:00:53.579> build<00:00:54.059> a<00:00:54.360> Combat

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
just then that I can also build a Combat

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.040 
just then that I can also build a Combat
Academy<00:00:55.500> which<00:00:56.460> is<00:00:56.489> basically<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.750> mapping

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
Academy which is basically the mapping

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.040 
Academy which is basically the mapping
clash<00:00:58.230> of<00:00:58.350> clans<00:00:58.590> and<00:00:59.030> so<00:01:00.030> I'm<00:01:00.390> guessing<00:01:00.780> that

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
clash of clans and so I'm guessing that

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.810 
clash of clans and so I'm guessing that
you<00:01:01.199> can<00:01:01.350> upgrade<00:01:01.500> your<00:01:01.680> troops<00:01:02.399> like<00:01:02.699> the

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
you can upgrade your troops like the

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.170 
you can upgrade your troops like the
heavy<00:01:03.000> and<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.359> rifleman<00:01:03.809> and<00:01:04.909> so<00:01:05.909> I'm<00:01:06.030> just

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
heavy and the rifleman and so I'm just

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.140 
heavy and the rifleman and so I'm just
training<00:01:06.420> some<00:01:06.659> troops<00:01:06.900> for<00:01:07.110> battle<00:01:07.140> now<00:01:08.150> and

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
training some troops for battle now and

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.520 
training some troops for battle now and
you<00:01:09.210> just<00:01:09.479> seen<00:01:09.659> there<00:01:09.840> occasionally<00:01:10.140> on<00:01:10.439> the

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
you just seen there occasionally on the

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.050 
you just seen there occasionally on the
world<00:01:10.710> tab<00:01:10.920> you<00:01:11.070> can<00:01:11.189> find<00:01:11.460> chess<00:01:11.729> with

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
world tab you can find chess with

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.210 
world tab you can find chess with
diamonds<00:01:12.540> in<00:01:12.659> them<00:01:12.840> if<00:01:13.140> you're<00:01:13.770> lucky<00:01:14.010> you<00:01:14.100> can

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
diamonds in them if you're lucky you can

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.420 
diamonds in them if you're lucky you can
get<00:01:14.310> like<00:01:14.490> 20<00:01:15.000> but<00:01:15.450> this<00:01:15.659> time<00:01:15.810> only<00:01:15.900> got<00:01:16.170> 3<00:01:16.430> so

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
get like 20 but this time only got 3 so

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.010 
get like 20 but this time only got 3 so
moving<00:01:17.700> on<00:01:17.820> to<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:17.939> attacks<00:01:18.299> starting<00:01:18.900> with

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
moving on to the attacks starting with

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.320 
moving on to the attacks starting with
this<00:01:19.170> one<00:01:19.229> my<00:01:20.040> aim<00:01:20.189> is<00:01:20.369> to<00:01:20.400> destroy<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:21.030> cannon

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
this one my aim is to destroy the cannon

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.310 
this one my aim is to destroy the cannon
on<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:21.810> right<00:01:22.080> with<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.680> missile<00:01:24.320> otherwise

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
on the right with the missile otherwise

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.590 
on the right with the missile otherwise
it<00:01:25.530> will<00:01:25.650> rip<00:01:25.920> out<00:01:26.100> like<00:01:26.670> it<00:01:26.909> wipe<00:01:27.180> out<00:01:27.420> my

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
it will rip out like it wipe out my

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.080 
it will rip out like it wipe out my
heavy<00:01:27.930> and<00:01:28.200> leave<00:01:28.829> like<00:01:29.040> my<00:01:29.189> rifleman<00:01:29.670> exposed
