alright<00:03:41.810> so<00:03:42.810> I<00:03:43.170> think<00:03:44.130> that's<00:03:44.580> about<00:03:44.850> it<00:03:45.060> what

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870

do have to complain about one thing I

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:55.880 
do have to complain about one thing I
think<00:03:51.870> this<00:03:52.080> is<00:03:52.350> your<00:03:53.190> results<00:03:53.760> may<00:03:53.850> vary<00:03:54.890> if

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
think this is your results may vary if

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:02.000 
think this is your results may vary if
you've<00:03:56.160> noticed<00:03:57.680> Wolverine<00:03:58.700> this<00:03:59.700> hand<00:04:01.010> it

you've noticed Wolverine this hand it
won't<00:04:02.760> swivel<00:04:03.510> I<00:04:03.690> think<00:04:04.170> if<00:04:04.410> I<00:04:04.860> force<00:04:05.280> it<00:04:05.580> I'll

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:06.230 
won't swivel I think if I force it I'll

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:11.360 
won't swivel I think if I force it I'll
probably<00:04:07.230> break<00:04:07.680> it<00:04:09.560> I'm<00:04:10.560> thinking<00:04:10.890> of<00:04:11.220> doing

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
probably break it I'm thinking of doing

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:14.780 
probably break it I'm thinking of doing
