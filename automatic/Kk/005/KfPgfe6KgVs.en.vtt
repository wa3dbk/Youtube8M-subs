00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:14.220
 color here 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:19.769
 It's this color on the side that he's going to 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:25.490
 to be without nothing without nothing 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:27.930
 I took this deal with a 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:30.510
 stiletto 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:33.260

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:39.150
 after I took it I passed that color 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:42.960
 that she is very strong and gives a 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:45.389
 smell musty and have to make a place 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:50.280
 open if it is a closed space. 

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:55.410
 hurt you which is very strong when 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:05:00.630
 boots everything then spreads it with his finger 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:05:03.660
 she will stay retained the glue leaves 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:07.410
 glue to dry a little more 

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:09.680
 little to not let it dry up all 

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:12.330
 will not go wrong in the text that 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:19.039
