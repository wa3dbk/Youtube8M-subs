00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.810

 Hello everybody Today, Apple watch that was released to Korea in 2 months of ALP 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:17.250
 I want to talk to you while I feel the first light. 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:25.750
 Most flags are also in the white box. 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:29.800
 In the case of imported apple worth of sports models long Hmm horizontal angle was used 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:33.969
 On the right side of the box, you will find Apple's name , 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:38.680
 It pointed out that the center has built a written Roach Apple logo on top 

00:00:33.969 --> 00:00:42.400
 And the serial number , serial number, and additional details at the bottom 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:45.670
 One thing to keep in mind is that the more expensive model, Apple , 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:49.840
 It has been close to a square box of books Awakening 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:53.260
 Unopened, like all Apple products, is full. 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:56.050
 You can cut the vinyl and open the box. 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:59.230
 The box is heavy as expected. 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:01.030
 Slide the top cover up and hold the plastic with the Apple watch 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:04.780
 The box will be visible immediately 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:08.229
 I can be a little different from Flor or Apple, but my family model 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:11.470
 Because it is sports, I will tell you based on sports 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:15.580
 Inside the paper that says Apple's designs juicy kid Inkel players 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:16.659
 At the bottom of the package , Apple Roche's wireless charger and charging terminal 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:20.680
 There is 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:25.659
 There I tied plastic wrap off the sticker on the wireless sector, if the charging terminal

 Two-tone magnet charging cradle that is slightly gray and white to be able to check 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:30.400
 There is 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:33.570
 Unlike other big ios their value as Apple put it on the cladding 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.570
 It will charge in the way 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:39.260
 In the case of emotional paper wrapping , a brief description of the chi to Apple as expected 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:43.100
 With the documentation 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:46.310
 There were a lot of papers, but one half of the sports band 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:51.260
 I could not find a representative sticker. 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:54.980
 Of course, these features are also based on the Apple Roche sport model. 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:59.650
 Finally, in the plastic box containing the flot sports body, b 4 c 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:59.650
 If you open it , you can check Apple's sport. 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:09.830
 In case of a plastic box containing an Apple Coach Luxurious suede inside 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:13.910
 It was made of material and the weight of the box itself was considerably heavy. 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:15.110
 I am model of Apple Attract Sport 42mm Space Gray Black Sports 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:20.150
 It's a band. 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:23.930
 I thought the first impression was not as big as 42mm as expected . 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:27.830
 When I first unplugged, I wrapped the body of the plastic serial 4 plug. 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:30.470
 Please remove the sticker on the side of us out as far plus a modern fully 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:34.040
 It will be released. 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:38.030
 Spray the entire body is a little more heart rate measurement in the middle, at the bottom 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:41.600
 A brief on the model and the material of the Apple Watch, which surrounds the sensor and the sensor 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:43.040
 Information is written, and at the bottom of the window you can change the long oval 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:47.270
 There is a home 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:51.620
 Based on the 40mm model, Apple is about 1.5cm hitting Amor Red 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:54.830
 Side panels and a built-in Retina display, you can scroll and zoom revenue 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:59.800
 Digital Crown'll button that acts lies 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:03:03.700
 On the other side there are two rear speakers and one microphone 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:08.170
 For sports liquidation it built basically the same alienated and say jelly 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:09.580
 I did not feel very luxurious, but I felt cheap 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:13.420
 It was not. 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:16.960
 Then bend the flexible sense of well-being that is constantly pulling force to hold 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:20.740
 It seemed that it would not only be in my daily life . 

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:22.950
 It is not worth the price of 65,000 won to sell to such an apple store 

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:22.950
 The same 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:32.030
 Action to secure the insert in a fixed band width ssoereo formula Alternatively 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:36.230
 I do not want to fix it first, but put the rest of the panties in the fixture. 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:40.010
 Since the recent order is not very general and unstable, 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:44.239
 I think it's very likely that you'll drop it to 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:46.340
 The feeling when worn is similar to the usual watch weight, 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:50.510
 I did not think it was heavy . 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:51.950
 In terms of sanctions, it's just like a clock, but it's a smart clock. 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:55.940
 There was no feeling 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:59.959
 To run the flot , you have to have the required iPhone unconditionally . 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:03.980
 flo Model Chen iPhone 5c is available with all 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:06.890
 To turn on the first power, do not press the button at the bottom, but inside the digital crown 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:11.060
 You can hold the focus in five seconds . 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:13.160
 Apple with a very low brightness enough to be hard to see outdoors with the naked eye 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:16.609
 The logo comes up in self-service room 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:20.690
 Open the Apple logo over some time window in which the arm can make language settings 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:25.010
 It supports various languages that are made can also be selected by touch and digital out 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:28.160
 We could have scrolled to the crown and picked one thing. 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:31.789
 It was a very soft, solid feeling with digital cranes. 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:34.990
 When you first set the language and complete the language setting, it only takes about 5 minutes 

00:04:31.789 --> 00:04:34.990
 Loading 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:43.060
 Once the language is set, you should now be able to connect to iPhone 5. 

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:46.690
 Enter the iPhone Apple Watch application, tap Start Connection, 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:47.710
 If you click Start Connection in the Outback, Apple Light will show a little light on the sphere 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:51.310
 Start 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:53.139
 If you recognize it as a two-sphere in the iPhone, you can work with the iPhone 's floor 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:57.350
 Two words are executed for 

00:04:53.139 --> 00:05:00.590
 Of course, Bluetooth must be turned on 

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:05.030
 Because you are purchasing the plug-7 for the first time , 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:09.950
 It was selected after a joiner orientation Terms and apple id kids MESSAGE 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:11.240
 The synchronization between the two end surfaces than both the Location Services setting of the diagnostic password Seals 

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:14.690
 It starts. 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:19.160
 It was slow to feel the synchronization process awkward and about 10 minutes of alienation 

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:24.070
 Do not look directly at the process of releasing it, just release the Apple watch 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:24.070
 I recommend you to wait while doing something else for a while 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:30.600
 After synchronization is complete, the last time a little behind with the clock that is Apple worth screen 

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:32.600
 Come up 

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:32.600
 Ah 

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:41.990
 4 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:46.339
 I 've summarized the opening feeling and the first impression in today's apple and sieve. 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:49.789
 In future reviews, we'll look more closely at Apple's enthusiasm.
