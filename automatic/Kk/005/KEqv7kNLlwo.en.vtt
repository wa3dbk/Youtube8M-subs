00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.110
 because people just talk about this topic 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.110
 someone had the question of the message 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:26.970
 for the first time by profession so different 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.680
 primitive if someone decreases in it 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.150
 so tuned the meat did not eat so 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.529
 or should less of it 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.110
 eat more of the other but it depends 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:38.220
 always by supplementing payment with the 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:40.230
 Customer individually discuss but important 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:43.530
 Well, markus meatier is not me 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.629
 minced meat no finished meat none 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.519
 Can alarm is with 4 with much salt 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.059
 and so far so should not be much 

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:52.370
 be inside 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:55.610
 So little sodium should be very much here 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.810
 have little fat below three percent 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.730
 and of course it should 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:01.030
 high protein facil of the contract 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:04.000
 maybe now that's the same 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:05.250
 we have number one as meat 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.490
 quality 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.290
 good slip many good schnitzel super 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.870
 story on the make me 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.000
 no associations no oil even there 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:16.050
 For example, if I always ask you 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.510
 from the people the nutrition plan 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:19.500
 created in which oil can arise 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:21.000
 Of course, always the nutrition plan 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:25.590
 built and how much can from which oil 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.040
 but even there, the people stop many 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.650
 error 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.390
 I personally do not use oil but 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.800
 a special color has to stop that 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.330
 different about the diet get 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:38.070
 I like that with the heights of the 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:39.600
 market is not enough and yet clear 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.490
 You can also in pensions if you are then 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.660
 then I should use it 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:49.880
 I will definitely not say that 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:49.880
 sun then it continues if here 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:02:01.070
 guti 30 21 23 24 kilo around seven euros 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.450
 at lidl or aldi 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.390
 There would not have to be any 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:09.380
 says so reportings and the 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:11.240
 Ultimate say the 20 euro per animal 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.710
 let you out that is unnecessary here 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.349
 and there, who gets it for her? 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:18.800
 makes euro 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:21.530
 and so the good normal bio quote then 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:24.970
 you also get her chicken breast filet very much 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:29.450
 good sometimes even has more protein tick 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:31.120
 as good as the back of the chest would have 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:34.069
 as well in the advise 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:36.080
 then you have next you have 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:37.340
 the pigs do a lot of things personally 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.489
 very very rare that I do not like it 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:42.459
 but me for myself i dont know why 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:44.840
 it is going to be a little bit 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:48.519
 a little snooty but for me is one 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:52.130
 pig liver like an inferior one 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:54.980
 meat product creature a pig 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:56.870
 are nice love know as price 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.910
 So product as food as 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.470
 food game not good do not know 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:01.420
 how so 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:05.530
 I am not a Muslim but I like it 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:06.970
 just not the only one out of the mark 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.440
 to recommend skill to the people 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:11.050
 I hate it very much too 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.880
 rare lent and pigs are there 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:15.960
 also fits on why just a lot of salt 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:15.960
 and that is 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:21.190
 But at the same time giving is a good 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:24.000
 a lot of people go to school or 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:26.850
 so even if not many people were 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.220
 almost 4 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:33.300
 many people still changes the 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:35.040
 school and school could do it 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:36.210
 meals for the lunch break for the 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.320
 big break and so on 

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:40.080
 put together and there is sometimes 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:41.130
 also possibly ham existed 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.890
 really very fast now 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:45.270
 go is because you also need to 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:51.600
 Buy the right gift then you have to 

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:54.270
 already there and therefore silent conditionally 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:56.460
 But if then fell then beef fillet 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:59.670
 I like it a lot 

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:02.490
 the beef fillet is a thing then 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:04.320
 Also important is soft and red 

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:04.920
 meat is not always differentiated 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.120
 consider 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:08.220
 especially because of supplementation 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:10.700
 body type is as important as with 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:13.830
 different it makes the different 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:15.360
 amino acid profiles are in there 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:19.489
 different compound amine should 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:21.510
 cultivates various compounds 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:25.680
 simply described composite 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:27.450
 nutrients would have to pay attention 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.520
 accumulate more pollutants in 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:29.880
 some less and so on always has to 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.110
 watch 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:33.270
 it always has to be on the whole currency 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:35.610
 would now go beyond the scope you have to 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:38.240
 always so far the red perhaps 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:40.930
 good or is this the good one here 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:44.380
 We are sorry for white meat 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:49.500
 and quite expensive but contains that 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:49.500
 is unbeatable in taste 

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:54.910
 really good same direction 

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:57.770
 and in terms of the variety 

00:04:54.910 --> 00:05:00.840
 because almost everyone 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:07.760
 on the rhine construction area twice the 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:10.170
 week a bus many then you have things 

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:12.630
 I do not want to say anything 

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:16.110
 or pick up her songs but thats her 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:18.510
 to say yes maybe a bit 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:20.640
 but expensive are good things you can 

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:24.090
 should try it the next 

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:25.590
 thing to meat fish is really picture 

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:27.090
 of fat Nehrig with one to two times the 

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:29.700
 week so vinegar for example, also like 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:31.980
 after fishing like salmon or son or 

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:34.140
 or maybe tuna sometimes 

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:36.200
 do not be careful about mercury when 

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:39.150
 Tuna is high in the negative 

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:40.590
 What does a tuna mean ? 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:42.060
 works is a little fish the 

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:43.440
 in turn , say yes for clothes 

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:45.810
 which in turn is a small table of 

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:47.070
 a smaller one for players and there 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:53.100
 subscribe to pollutants 

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:54.840
 that means for some people that 

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:57.600
 also depends on the contact again 

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:58.870
 but some people should give us a look 

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:01.510
 times in the week 

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:05.550
 as out of the box big tuna not 

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:08.640
 because that's pretty unhealthy because of that 

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:11.320
 Pollutant if you change and so on 

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:13.980
 that other stuff in there but yes 

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:16.950
 also salt moderately now 

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:18.960
 but also tuna fish meal here 

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:22.260
 also from time to time when the when the the 

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:23.850
 customer fits I say there you can 

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:28.040
 you ever in his lunch break only on 

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:34.260
 work or do I put you the 

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:38.010
 you has very good position 26 grams 

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:39.660
 tuna otherwise yes you have salmon 

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:44.940
 has the others look different 

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:46.650
 is goodbye to shed by the way there 

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:47.700
 there is another meat there is 

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:48.990
 you can just now you can 

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:51.330
 You can write comments to me 

00:06:48.990 --> 00:07:01.230
 ask exactly that then exactly to that 

00:06:51.330 --> 00:07:02.640
 Meat videos make me into the 

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:06.420
 direction can continue to make videos 

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:08.520
 this is important, we see ourselves equal 

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:10.800
 the next question is pretty 

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:20.390
 hasty zugfahrt to extract from 

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:23.730
 no subscribers at all 

00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:26.550
 but I want to do it the same way 

00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:27.900
 This spot makes it fun is fun 

00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:30.660
 to go with us the discussions 

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:32.940
 accompanied with my agents because I 

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:34.170
 Here's what I am very proud I am 

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:41.550
 proud and subscribers if mine 

00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:43.860
 Subscribers and what people do I have to 

00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:46.349
 rust intelligent 

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:47.669
 I read my comments are here to 

00:07:46.349 --> 00:07:50.479
 think the people who say sometimes 

00:07:47.669 --> 00:07:50.479
 that
