we<00:01:08.520> will<00:01:08.729> lose<00:01:08.909> our<00:01:09.090> horses<00:01:09.570> more<00:01:10.439> creatures<00:01:10.680> I

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
we will lose our horses more creatures I

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.310 
we will lose our horses more creatures I
think<00:01:11.909> that's<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.150> only<00:01:12.240> mod<00:01:12.689> that's<00:01:12.990> not

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
think that's the only mod that's not

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.460 
think that's the only mod that's not
updated<00:01:14.240> because<00:01:15.240> I<00:01:15.450> mean<00:01:15.600> I<00:01:15.689> really<00:01:16.170> wasn't

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
updated because I mean I really wasn't

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.999 
updated because I mean I really wasn't
using<00:01:16.860> many<00:01:17.070> as<00:01:17.280> it<00:01:17.460> was<00:01:17.640> was<00:01:17.880> just<00:01:18.060> an<00:01:18.150> optimum

00:01:18.999 --> 00:01:19.009
