I'm<00:00:02.220> starting<00:00:02.610> here<00:00:02.790> with<00:00:02.939> the<00:00:03.480> final

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:03.810 
I'm starting here with the final

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.079 
I'm starting here with the final
diagnosis<00:00:04.410> and<00:00:04.830> I<00:00:04.920> have<00:00:05.069> everything<00:00:05.700> more<00:00:06.029> or

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089 
diagnosis and I have everything more or

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:09.530 
diagnosis and I have everything more or
less<00:00:06.180> exposed<00:00:07.970> just<00:00:08.970> to<00:00:09.120> give<00:00:09.269> a<00:00:09.300> short

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
less exposed just to give a short

less exposed just to give a short
explanation<00:00:10.580> the<00:00:11.580> cylinder<00:00:11.969> heads<00:00:12.179> with<00:00:12.719> the

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
explanation the cylinder heads with the

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.890 
explanation the cylinder heads with the
valves<00:00:13.639> now<00:00:14.639> all<00:00:14.940> of<00:00:15.059> them<00:00:15.240> properly<00:00:16.139> cleaned

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:17.900 
valves now all of them properly cleaned

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:24.859 
valves now all of them properly cleaned
like<00:00:18.900> this<00:00:22.970> and<00:00:23.970> all<00:00:24.119> of<00:00:24.240> the<00:00:24.330> mechanical<00:00:24.810> and

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
like this and all of the mechanical and

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.900 
like this and all of the mechanical and
hydraulic<00:00:25.199> apart<00:00:27.920> it<00:00:28.920> starts<00:00:29.310> as<00:00:29.460> from<00:00:29.699> here

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
hydraulic apart it starts as from here

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.090 
hydraulic apart it starts as from here
where<00:00:30.300> you<00:00:30.449> have<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:30.830> camshafts<00:00:31.830> running

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:34.100 
where you have the camshafts running

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.900 
where you have the camshafts running
touching<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.540> hydraulic<00:00:36.540> tappets<00:00:37.910> the

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
touching the hydraulic tappets the

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.030 
touching the hydraulic tappets the
interior<00:00:39.390> of<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:40.079> hydraulic<00:00:40.559> tappets<00:00:40.770> you

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
interior of the hydraulic tappets you

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.940 
interior of the hydraulic tappets you
look<00:00:41.190> and<00:00:41.370> see<00:00:41.670> here<00:00:42.260> that<00:00:43.260> is<00:00:43.410> the<00:00:43.530> tappets

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
look and see here that is the tappets

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.400 
look and see here that is the tappets
that<00:00:44.640> is<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:44.879> plunger<00:00:45.270> and<00:00:46.050> that<00:00:46.200> is<00:00:46.320> the

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
that is the plunger and that is the

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.569 
that is the plunger and that is the
regulator<00:00:46.770> that<00:00:47.100> is<00:00:47.610> fixing<00:00:48.180> it<00:00:48.329> inside<00:00:49.579> all

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
regulator that is fixing it inside all

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.100 
regulator that is fixing it inside all
of<00:00:50.700> this<00:00:50.820> I've<00:00:51.000> cleaned<00:00:53.420> so<00:00:54.420> this<00:00:54.989> is

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
of this I've cleaned so this is

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.610 
of this I've cleaned so this is
hydraulically<00:00:55.730> adjusting<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:57.000> clearance

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:57.620 
hydraulically adjusting the clearance

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.290 
hydraulically adjusting the clearance
also<00:00:58.620> make<00:00:58.890> sure<00:00:58.920> that<00:00:59.460> push<00:01:00.300> rod<00:01:00.510> goes<00:01:00.719> up

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.300 
also make sure that push rod goes up

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.170 
also make sure that push rod goes up
touches<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.449> rocker<00:01:03.600> arm<00:01:04.189> which<00:01:05.189> is<00:01:05.369> fixed<00:01:05.640> by

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
touches the rocker arm which is fixed by

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.520 
touches the rocker arm which is fixed by
this<00:01:06.409> bridge<00:01:07.490> on<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:08.670> slender<00:01:09.000> head<00:01:09.180> and<00:01:09.530> on

this bridge on the slender head and on
the<00:01:10.650> other<00:01:10.770> side

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990 
the other side

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:21.410 
the other side
operating<00:01:12.990> valve<00:01:16.400> this<00:01:17.400> is<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:17.640> spring<00:01:20.420> here

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
operating valve this is the spring here

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.460 
operating valve this is the spring here
you<00:01:21.659> see<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:22.200> retainer<00:01:23.450> of<00:01:24.450> two<00:01:24.689> pieces<00:01:25.110> as

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
you see the retainer of two pieces as

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.999 
you see the retainer of two pieces as
you<00:01:25.650> can<00:01:25.799> see<00:01:25.920> here<00:01:26.070> as<00:01:26.189> well<00:01:27.619> they're<00:01:28.619> here

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
you can see here as well they're here

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:34.340 
you can see here as well they're here
two<00:01:29.579> pieces<00:01:29.790> an<00:01:30.920> insight<00:01:31.920> of<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:33.240> spring<00:01:33.659> you

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
two pieces an insight of the spring you

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.710 
two pieces an insight of the spring you
have<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:34.619> oil<00:01:34.770> deflector<00:01:35.490> making<00:01:36.270> sure<00:01:36.479> that

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
have the oil deflector making sure that

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.690 
have the oil deflector making sure that
the<00:01:36.810> oil<00:01:36.840> doesn't<00:01:37.200> enter<00:01:37.560> in<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:37.950> engine

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
the oil doesn't enter in the engine

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.230 
the oil doesn't enter in the engine
compartment<00:01:40.610> now<00:01:41.610> if<00:01:41.729> you<00:01:41.820> make<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.060> full

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
compartment now if you make the full

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.660 
compartment now if you make the full
diagnosis<00:01:42.810> what<00:01:43.170> I<00:01:43.200> noticed<00:01:43.680> is<00:01:43.890> that<00:01:43.920> my

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
diagnosis what I noticed is that my

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.630 
diagnosis what I noticed is that my
false<00:01:44.939> no<00:01:45.450> cleans<00:01:47.990> there's<00:01:48.990> turning<00:01:49.350> walls

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
false no cleans there's turning walls

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.670 
false no cleans there's turning walls
they're<00:01:50.640> moving<00:01:51.000> on<00:01:51.149> as<00:01:51.869> it's<00:01:52.110> supposed<00:01:52.409> to<00:01:52.500> be

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
they're moving on as it's supposed to be

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.039 
they're moving on as it's supposed to be
so<00:01:53.070> no<00:01:53.820> more<00:01:53.970> stick<00:01:54.210> evolves<00:01:54.659> the<00:01:54.840> dust

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
so no more stick evolves the dust

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.950 
so no more stick evolves the dust
problem<00:01:55.439> should<00:01:55.649> be<00:01:55.829> ok<00:01:56.509> however<00:01:57.509> if<00:01:57.719> I<00:01:57.810> would

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
problem should be ok however if I would

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.300 
problem should be ok however if I would
measure<00:01:58.140> you<00:01:58.649> have<00:01:58.740> to<00:01:58.860> do<00:01:58.979> this<00:01:59.100> from<00:01:59.250> the

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
measure you have to do this from the

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.149 
measure you have to do this from the
other<00:01:59.490> side<00:01:59.579> but<00:02:00.000> if<00:02:00.119> I<00:02:00.270> measure<00:02:00.950> evolved<00:02:01.950> to

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
other side but if I measure evolved to

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.420 
other side but if I measure evolved to
stand<00:02:02.430> clearance<00:02:03.799> I'm<00:02:04.799> actually<00:02:05.009> a<00:02:05.189> little

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
stand clearance I'm actually a little

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.559 
stand clearance I'm actually a little
bit<00:02:05.520> beyond<00:02:05.909> what<00:02:07.640> the<00:02:08.640> manual<00:02:08.910> is<00:02:09.149> proposing

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
bit beyond what the manual is proposing

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.520 
bit beyond what the manual is proposing
so<00:02:10.500> in<00:02:10.649> principle<00:02:11.069> I<00:02:11.160> should<00:02:11.660> bore

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
so in principle I should bore

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:21.550 
so in principle I should bore
the<00:02:13.860> for<00:02:14.040> guidance<00:02:14.460> and<00:02:17.120> by<00:02:18.120> oversized<00:02:18.710> force

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
the for guidance and by oversized force

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.400 
the for guidance and by oversized force
then<00:02:22.560> it<00:02:22.680> is<00:02:22.800> best<00:02:22.980> also<00:02:23.370> to<00:02:23.430> change<00:02:24.410> the

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
then it is best also to change the

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.910 
then it is best also to change the
springs<00:02:25.680> I<00:02:26.120> don't<00:02:27.120> even<00:02:27.180> have<00:02:27.360> to<00:02:27.510> change<00:02:27.920> the

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
springs I don't even have to change the

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.430 
springs I don't even have to change the
rocker<00:02:29.160> arms<00:02:30.380> by<00:02:31.380> some<00:02:31.620> you<00:02:31.800> push<00:02:32.250> shots

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
rocker arms by some you push shots

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:39.830 
rocker arms by some you push shots
what<00:02:34.440> you<00:02:34.560> can<00:02:34.710> see<00:02:34.890> as<00:02:35.010> well<00:02:35.220> is<00:02:35.250> that<00:02:38.840> where

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
what you can see as well is that where

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.930 
what you can see as well is that where
the<00:02:40.110> tappets<00:02:41.630> or<00:02:42.630> touching<00:02:43.050> the<00:02:43.200> camshaft<00:02:43.940> it

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
the tappets or touching the camshaft it

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:50.270 
the tappets or touching the camshaft it
is<00:02:45.090> worn<00:02:45.330> out<00:02:45.830> in<00:02:46.830> fact<00:02:47.130> it<00:02:47.250> should<00:02:47.280> be<00:02:47.490> a<00:02:49.280> belt

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
is worn out in fact it should be a belt

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.060 
is worn out in fact it should be a belt
but<00:02:50.820> actually<00:02:51.180> it<00:02:51.300> is<00:02:51.420> kind<00:02:51.720> of<00:02:51.780> a<00:02:51.900> hole<00:02:52.110> and

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
but actually it is kind of a hole and

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:55.850 
but actually it is kind of a hole and
that<00:02:53.310> means<00:02:53.490> these<00:02:54.060> need<00:02:54.360> to<00:02:54.390> be<00:02:54.510> replaced<00:02:54.860> but

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
that means these need to be replaced but

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.890 
that means these need to be replaced but
if<00:02:56.010> you<00:02:56.100> replace<00:02:56.400> these<00:02:56.580> you<00:02:57.360> will<00:02:57.510> have<00:02:57.570> to

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
if you replace these you will have to

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.620 
if you replace these you will have to
replace<00:02:58.110> the<00:02:59.010> camshaft<00:02:59.430> as<00:02:59.640> well<00:02:59.820> if<00:03:00.510> you

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
replace the camshaft as well if you

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.840 
replace the camshaft as well if you
replace<00:03:00.930> the<00:03:01.080> camshaft<00:03:01.530> you<00:03:02.460> obviously

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
replace the camshaft you obviously

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:05.900 
replace the camshaft you obviously
replace<00:03:03.240> the<00:03:03.840> timing<00:03:04.230> chain<00:03:04.430> so<00:03:05.430> this<00:03:05.760> is<00:03:05.880> a

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
replace the timing chain so this is a

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.410 
replace the timing chain so this is a
huge<00:03:06.560> effort<00:03:07.560> here<00:03:08.150> and<00:03:09.150> if<00:03:09.300> you<00:03:09.360> would

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
huge effort here and if you would

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.060 
huge effort here and if you would
consider<00:03:09.720> doing<00:03:09.900> that<00:03:10.050> it<00:03:10.770> would<00:03:10.950> be

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.070 
consider doing that it would be

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:12.800 
consider doing that it would be
recommend<00:03:11.490> to<00:03:11.730> change<00:03:12.030> the<00:03:12.180> cam<00:03:12.360> shot<00:03:12.570> by

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
recommend to change the cam shot by

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.340 
recommend to change the cam shot by
competition<00:03:13.320> camshaft<00:03:13.890> yes<00:03:14.280> especially<00:03:14.940> for

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.350 
competition camshaft yes especially for

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:20.930 
competition camshaft yes especially for
4x4<00:03:17.420> now<00:03:18.980> this<00:03:19.980> is<00:03:20.070> not<00:03:20.190> what<00:03:20.340> I'm<00:03:20.489> going<00:03:20.730> to<00:03:20.760> do

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
4x4 now this is not what I'm going to do

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.330 
4x4 now this is not what I'm going to do
I'm<00:03:21.780> going<00:03:22.020> to<00:03:22.170> put<00:03:22.320> everything<00:03:23.070> back

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
I'm going to put everything back

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:23.949 
I'm going to put everything back
together

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:23.959 
together

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:26.990 
together
all<00:03:24.959> the<00:03:25.170> parts<00:03:25.470> as<00:03:25.650> the<00:03:25.770> world<00:03:26.010> the<00:03:26.760> only

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
all the parts as the world the only

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.180 
all the parts as the world the only
thing<00:03:27.180> that<00:03:27.330> I'm<00:03:27.450> replacing<00:03:28.230> is<00:03:28.620> the<00:03:28.860> pushed

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
thing that I'm replacing is the pushed

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.080 
thing that I'm replacing is the pushed
band<00:03:29.459> rods<00:03:29.670> and<00:03:29.940> do<00:03:30.840> all<00:03:30.959> deflectors

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 
band rods and do all deflectors

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:36.229 
band rods and do all deflectors
so<00:03:33.090> these<00:03:33.330> I<00:03:33.510> will<00:03:33.660> replace<00:03:34.790> because<00:03:35.790> this<00:03:36.120> is

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 
so these I will replace because this is

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:39.320 
so these I will replace because this is
kind<00:03:36.450> of<00:03:36.570> a<00:03:36.780> plastic<00:03:37.850> but<00:03:38.850> I<00:03:38.880> noticed<00:03:39.300> that

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:39.330 
kind of a plastic but I noticed that

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:41.720 
kind of a plastic but I noticed that
it's<00:03:39.570> become<00:03:39.810> very<00:03:39.989> hard<00:03:40.400> it<00:03:41.400> should<00:03:41.459> be<00:03:41.700> a

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
it's become very hard it should be a

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:45.080 
it's become very hard it should be a
little<00:03:41.910> bit<00:03:42.090> flexible<00:03:42.330> and<00:03:43.580> one<00:03:44.580> was<00:03:44.730> broken

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
little bit flexible and one was broken

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.930 
little bit flexible and one was broken
anyway<00:03:45.180> so<00:03:45.720> I<00:03:45.750> better<00:03:46.019> replace<00:03:46.380> those<00:03:46.940> and

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
anyway so I better replace those and

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.020 
anyway so I better replace those and
then<00:03:48.420> I'm<00:03:48.510> going<00:03:48.660> to<00:03:48.750> assemble<00:03:49.200> everything<00:03:49.410> I

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.030 
then I'm going to assemble everything I

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:52.220 
then I'm going to assemble everything I
made<00:03:51.030> my<00:03:51.180> list<00:03:51.360> of<00:03:51.480> everything<00:03:51.989> to<00:03:52.140> be

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
made my list of everything to be

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.210 
made my list of everything to be
replaced<00:03:52.620> and<00:03:54.410> then<00:03:55.410> I<00:03:55.440> hope<00:03:55.680> my<00:03:55.800> engine<00:03:56.070> will

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
replaced and then I hope my engine will

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.670 
replaced and then I hope my engine will
start<00:03:56.430> here
