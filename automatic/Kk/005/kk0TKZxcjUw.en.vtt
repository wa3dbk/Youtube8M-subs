00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:07.680
 bull salzburg won the home game against 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.330
 wiener neustadt the possibility itself 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.290
 prematurely to the austrian champion 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.200
 to choose 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.470
 that also succeeds in the end 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:18.240
 impressive with a clear 5 0 victory 

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:21.870
 but after 16 minutes there is unfortunately one 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.040
 unsightly scene drives against dennis mimm 

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:24.900
 the elbow out 

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.280
 it is an active movement of 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.860
 brazilian the referee 

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:32.129
 he sees must also red 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:35.609
 show completely unnecessary action here 

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:38.339
 from a viennese neustadt stands in the 

00:00:35.609 --> 00:00:42.269
 beginning phase very compact until yes up to 

00:00:38.339 --> 00:00:44.609
 Play 22 and soriano with the top 

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:47.429
 Opportunities speaks for his already 

00:00:44.609 --> 00:00:50.010
 beaten to old practically in the 

00:00:47.429 --> 00:00:51.859
 turn the table leader is wide open 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.159
 the return game with high risk 

00:00:51.859 --> 00:00:57.629
 Thomas Pichlmann with the possibility 

00:00:55.159 --> 00:01:01.409
 but is called back 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.940
 it was in the offside but it was 

00:01:01.409 --> 00:01:06.650
 probably the same height 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.650
 with stefan in st 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.649
 In this phase it hits 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.750
 blow 

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:15.869
 just a minute later the bulls over 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:19.170
 stefan ilsanker with a good eye for 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:21.350
 alarm of the world the rest adjusts to the 1 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.350
 0 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:29.640
 it is not all right with the time 

00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:32.429
 obtained voting day into short eck 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:36.000
 be his 22 and come up with a total of that 

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:39.060
 the salzburger very clever to end and 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.869
 a little relief is logical 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.869
 Also to be considered again 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:46.320
 the guests from Lower Austria where 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.900
 69 in total of the start formation 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.060
 divided city ​​against stefan rakowitz 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.160
 the possibility on the 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.500
 equalizing strike 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:58.340
 neither colucci prevents this but with 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.810
 a good parade 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:03.120
 if the salzburgers are dangerous 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:06.240
 most of the time an actor has his legs in 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:09.420
 game and that is then the vice of 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.280
 coriano uses whimsy technology 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.400
 only second follow hofer prevented 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.400
 worse 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:19.490
 just before the break then the following scene 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:22.470
 the salzburger combine liquid over 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:25.920
 kevin kampl comes back this one the 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.870
 ball of the then captain Soriano in 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:31.430
 the replay time in half one succeeds 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.430
 the spanier the two to zero 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:39.400
 bavaria doing with the great gate to iaa 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:44.140
 with the ideal runway tells dry 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:46.330
 its twenty-sixth season goal it 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:50.790
 is therefore an ideal endpoint for 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:50.790
 the salzburger in the first 45 minutes 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:58.210
 it also returns to the beginning 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:02.980
 playful ease back 57 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:05.890
 play christoph leitgeb looking for something 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:08.850
 makes the featured single power and 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.850
 then the 3 to 0 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:17.950
 light on the scorers that is 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:21.889
 no offside 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:25.040
 tricky fine hook technically strong 

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:27.459
 conclusion with the inside laced 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.459
 a double pack 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.930
 who want to continue to play consistently 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.000
 Forward 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:42.030
 Wiener Neustadt breaks in succession 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:45.900
 apart florian small with space and 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:47.790
 then the ideal template for his 70th 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:52.769
 minute and the next hit for the 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:53.939
 eleven by roger schmidt klein does that 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:57.599
 excellent 

00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:59.250
 these accounts on the man already 

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:00.829
 four to a 3 tenth goal in the current 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:03.719
 competition 

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:06.419
 but that should not have been it yet 

00:04:03.719 --> 00:04:09.209
 three minutes before the end there is still the 

00:04:06.419 --> 00:04:12.959
 the bottom line , as well as contagious 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:16.739
 the one with a triple park and season to 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:19.320
 Number 24 should be perfect 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:22.259
 template everything is planned correctly in the customer 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:24.330
 conclusion the salzburger celebrate the 

00:04:22.259 --> 00:04:25.949
 fifth title of the red bull era it is 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:27.810
 the earliest this decision in the 

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:29.820
 bundesliga history and the 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:32.840
 obligatory beer shower is also available 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:32.840
 still for the coach
