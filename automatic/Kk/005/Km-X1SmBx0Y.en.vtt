another Sims 4 video today I'm actually

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.599 
another Sims 4 video today I'm actually
doing<00:00:03.750> a<00:00:03.990> video<00:00:04.140> that<00:00:04.589> I<00:00:04.620> did<00:00:04.770> probably<00:00:05.460> about

00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:05.609 
doing a video that I did probably about

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:07.519 
doing a video that I did probably about
eight<00:00:06.089> months<00:00:06.359> ago<00:00:06.569> and<00:00:06.779> I'm<00:00:06.899> redoing<00:00:07.290> it

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
eight months ago and I'm redoing it

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:09.350 
eight months ago and I'm redoing it
because<00:00:07.980> there's<00:00:08.400> so<00:00:08.550> much<00:00:08.700> new<00:00:08.760> stuff<00:00:09.059> that

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
because there's so much new stuff that

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:10.759 
because there's so much new stuff that
the<00:00:09.660> Sims<00:00:09.900> 4<00:00:10.080> and<00:00:10.200> I<00:00:10.260> think<00:00:10.290> it<00:00:10.559> would<00:00:10.650> be

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
the Sims 4 and I think it would be

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.640 
the Sims 4 and I think it would be
appropriate<00:00:11.130> to<00:00:11.900> pretty<00:00:12.900> much<00:00:12.960> redo<00:00:13.469> this

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
appropriate to pretty much redo this

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.490 
appropriate to pretty much redo this
video<00:00:13.830> with<00:00:14.160> new<00:00:14.400> ideas<00:00:14.610> and<00:00:14.849> new<00:00:15.030> features<00:00:15.500> so

think it could be a lot of fun and I see

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.930 
think it could be a lot of fun and I see
the<00:00:34.320> potential<00:00:34.649> in<00:00:34.829> it<00:00:34.980> I<00:00:35.070> just<00:00:35.280> I<00:00:35.430> feel<00:00:35.880> like

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
the potential in it I just I feel like

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.330 
the potential in it I just I feel like
online<00:00:36.329> feature<00:00:37.020> if<00:00:37.350> it's<00:00:37.530> obviously<00:00:37.980> I<00:00:38.070> want

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
them to exclude offline and online

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.110 
them to exclude offline and online
entirely<00:00:40.350> I<00:00:40.559> don't<00:00:40.739> want<00:00:40.860> them<00:00:40.980> to<00:00:41.190> conjoin

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
entirely I don't want them to conjoin

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.660 
entirely I don't want them to conjoin
online<00:00:42.719> and<00:00:43.050> offline<00:00:43.350> I<00:00:43.680> want<00:00:44.309> them<00:00:44.399> to<00:00:44.460> make

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
online and offline I want them to make

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.459 
online and offline I want them to make
them<00:00:44.820> two<00:00:45.030> separate<00:00:45.390> features<00:00:45.750> and<00:00:45.960> I<00:00:46.110> really

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
them two separate features and I really

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.190 
them two separate features and I really
think<00:00:46.649> online<00:00:47.129> could<00:00:47.399> be<00:00:47.520> a<00:00:47.550> lot<00:00:47.940> of<00:00:47.969> fun<00:00:48.239> for

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
think online could be a lot of fun for

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.229 
think online could be a lot of fun for
me<00:00:49.260> just<00:00:49.620> imagining<00:00:50.160> playing<00:00:50.520> The<00:00:50.730> Sims<00:00:50.760> with

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
feel like if you just make for a lot of

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.279 
feel like if you just make for a lot of
fun<00:00:59.640> so<00:01:00.030> despite<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:00.719> fact<00:01:00.989> that<00:01:01.020> I<00:01:01.140> know<00:01:01.199> a

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
fun so despite the fact that I know a

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:02.990 
fun so despite the fact that I know a
lot<00:01:01.469> of<00:01:01.500> people<00:01:01.739> probably<00:01:01.890> don't<00:01:02.160> like<00:01:02.399> online

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
lot of people probably don't like online

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.299 
lot of people probably don't like online
in<00:01:03.270> terms<00:01:03.480> of<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.780> sims<00:01:04.049> for<00:01:04.619> me<00:01:04.739> I<00:01:04.979> feel<00:01:05.220> like

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
in terms of the sims for me I feel like

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:06.710 
in terms of the sims for me I feel like
it<00:01:05.430> could<00:01:05.549> be<00:01:05.640> a<00:01:05.670> really<00:01:06.000> awesome<00:01:06.030> new<00:01:06.479> feature

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
it could be a really awesome new feature

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.460 
it could be a really awesome new feature
that<00:01:06.869> could<00:01:07.140> make<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.470> game<00:01:07.680> so<00:01:08.640> much<00:01:08.850> more

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:09.470 
that could make the game so much more

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.149 
that could make the game so much more
replayable<00:01:10.470> so<00:01:11.460> number<00:01:11.820> two<00:01:12.060> is<00:01:12.110> socializing

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:13.159 
replayable so number two is socializing

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:15.440 
replayable so number two is socializing
multitasking<00:01:14.159> and<00:01:14.369> realistic<00:01:14.760> emotions<00:01:15.330> the

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
multitasking and realistic emotions the

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.090 
multitasking and realistic emotions the
reason<00:01:15.840> I'm<00:01:15.960> putting<00:01:16.140> all<00:01:16.380> this<00:01:16.500> together<00:01:16.680> is

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
reason I'm putting all this together is

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.310 
reason I'm putting all this together is
because<00:01:17.640> it's<00:01:18.090> sort<00:01:18.210> of<00:01:18.330> general<00:01:19.080> gameplay

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
because it's sort of general gameplay

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.960 
because it's sort of general gameplay
improvements<00:01:20.159> I<00:01:20.220> could<00:01:20.400> go<00:01:20.520> on<00:01:20.640> about<00:01:20.820> the

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
improvements I could go on about the

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.020 
improvements I could go on about the
gameplay<00:01:21.420> for<00:01:22.229> a<00:01:22.290> very<00:01:22.650> long<00:01:23.070> video<00:01:23.400> um

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
gameplay for a very long video um

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.120 
gameplay for a very long video um
however<00:01:24.450> I'm<00:01:24.720> not<00:01:24.840> going<00:01:24.900> to<00:01:25.049> do<00:01:25.170> that<00:01:25.350> pretty

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
however I'm not going to do that pretty

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.649 
however I'm not going to do that pretty
much<00:01:26.280> these<00:01:26.549> are<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:26.759> three<00:01:27.119> things<00:01:27.390> about

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
much these are the three things about

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.780 
much these are the three things about
the<00:01:27.750> gameplay<00:01:27.960> that<00:01:28.350> I'm<00:01:28.500> excited<00:01:29.189> for<00:01:29.220> most

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
the gameplay that I'm excited for most

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.780 
the gameplay that I'm excited for most

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:18.740 
improved animations physics and graphics

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:20.170 
improved animations physics and graphics
now<00:02:18.980> I<00:02:19.010> know<00:02:19.280> a<00:02:19.430> lot<00:02:19.670> of<00:02:19.700> people<00:02:20.000> have<00:02:20.120> been

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
now I know a lot of people have been

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.150 
now I know a lot of people have been
complaining<00:02:20.690> about<00:02:20.900> the<00:02:21.140> graphics<00:02:21.530> so<00:02:21.710> far<00:02:21.950> I

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
complaining about the graphics so far I

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.130 
complaining about the graphics so far I
did<00:02:22.790> make<00:02:22.940> a<00:02:22.970> separate<00:02:23.390> video<00:02:23.510> about<00:02:23.750> this<00:02:23.900> bit

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
did make a separate video about this bit

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:25.870 
did make a separate video about this bit
honestly<00:02:24.560> for<00:02:24.800> me<00:02:24.920> it's<00:02:25.100> not<00:02:25.280> an<00:02:25.370> issue<00:02:25.520> at<00:02:25.730> all

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
honestly for me it's not an issue at all

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.030 
honestly for me it's not an issue at all
and<00:02:26.150> for<00:02:26.930> me<00:02:27.020> it<00:02:27.200> really<00:02:27.230> does<00:02:27.590> look<00:02:27.650> quite

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
and for me it really does look quite

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.280 
and for me it really does look quite
good<00:02:28.070> of<00:02:28.340> what<00:02:28.430> I've<00:02:28.550> seen<00:02:28.730> so<00:02:28.970> far<00:02:29.140> but<00:02:30.140> just

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
good of what I've seen so far but just

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:31.900 
good of what I've seen so far but just
in<00:02:30.410> general<00:02:30.440> in<00:02:30.830> terms<00:02:30.860> of<00:02:31.160> animations<00:02:31.700> and

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
in general in terms of animations and

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:33.640 
in general in terms of animations and

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
house that was one annoying thing about

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.280 
house that was one annoying thing about
earlier<00:02:37.970> Sims<00:02:38.240> where<00:02:38.420> you'd<00:02:38.540> be<00:02:38.690> they'd<00:02:39.170> be

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
earlier Sims where you'd be they'd be

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:40.630 
earlier Sims where you'd be they'd be
doing<00:02:39.530> this<00:02:39.620> weird<00:02:39.890> sort<00:02:40.100> of<00:02:40.250> robotic

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
doing this weird sort of robotic

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:41.920 
doing this weird sort of robotic
movements<00:02:41.209> and<00:02:41.300> they<00:02:41.360> couldn't<00:02:41.660> get<00:02:41.780> through

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
movements and they couldn't get through

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:43.480 
movements and they couldn't get through
the<00:02:42.020> doors<00:02:42.290> and<00:02:42.530> stuff<00:02:42.650> like<00:02:42.770> that<00:02:43.010> now

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:43.490 
the doors and stuff like that now

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:45.640 
the doors and stuff like that now
they've<00:02:43.670> got<00:02:43.700> like<00:02:44.000> 360<00:02:44.690> degree<00:02:44.990> movement<00:02:45.020> so

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
they've got like 360 degree movement so

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:47.320 
they've got like 360 degree movement so
they'll<00:02:45.800> be<00:02:45.920> constantly<00:02:46.580> like<00:02:46.760> sidestepping

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330 
they'll be constantly like sidestepping

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:48.970 
they'll be constantly like sidestepping
and<00:02:47.690> like<00:02:47.780> brushing<00:02:48.320> past<00:02:48.350> people<00:02:48.890> I<00:02:48.920> don't

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
and like brushing past people I don't

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:50.410 
and like brushing past people I don't
know<00:02:49.130> what<00:02:49.280> they'll<00:02:49.400> be<00:02:49.459> doing<00:02:49.520> but<00:02:49.880> they<00:02:50.240> will

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
know what they'll be doing but they will

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.650 
know what they'll be doing but they will
be<00:02:50.510> avoiding<00:02:50.989> people<00:02:51.320> they<00:02:51.410> won't<00:02:51.500> just<00:02:51.709> be

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
around in a really awkward robotic way

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:59.530 
around in a really awkward robotic way
and<00:02:58.520> there's<00:02:58.670> also<00:02:58.820> a<00:02:58.970> completely<00:02:59.300> new

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
gameplay screen which looks a lot better

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.400 
gameplay screen which looks a lot better
and<00:03:01.610> just<00:03:01.760> in<00:03:01.880> general<00:03:01.910> it<00:03:02.630> looks<00:03:02.870> a<00:03:03.080> lot<00:03:03.230> more

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410

fluid<00:03:04.010> as<00:03:04.190> I've<00:03:04.640> been<00:03:04.760> saying<00:03:04.970> a<00:03:05.030> lot<00:03:05.150> in<00:03:05.239> this

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:05.330

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
video and for me the graphics do look

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:09.280 
video and for me the graphics do look
like<00:03:07.940> a<00:03:07.970> big<00:03:08.209> upgrade<00:03:08.360> and<00:03:08.840> they<00:03:08.930> sort<00:03:09.110> of<00:03:09.170> look

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
like a big upgrade and they sort of look

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.229 
like a big upgrade and they sort of look
like<00:03:09.320> the<00:03:09.560> mix<00:03:09.770> between<00:03:09.950> Sims<00:03:10.340> 2<00:03:10.580> and<00:03:10.790> Sims<00:03:11.060> 3

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:11.239

is<00:03:15.860> the<00:03:15.890> expansions<00:03:16.700> and<00:03:16.850> the<00:03:16.940> possibility

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
is the expansions and the possibility

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:19.600 
is the expansions and the possibility
with<00:03:17.660> them<00:03:17.840> so<00:03:18.110> the<00:03:18.560> sims<00:03:18.799> obviously<00:03:19.400> a<00:03:19.459> really
