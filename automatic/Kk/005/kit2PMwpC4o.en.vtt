to<00:02:03.250> get<00:02:03.399> free<00:02:03.670> yeah<00:02:04.119> I<00:02:04.300> really<00:02:04.750> wouldn't

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:04.869 
to get free yeah I really wouldn't

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:06.330 
to get free yeah I really wouldn't
advise<00:02:05.110> doing<00:02:05.410> that<00:02:05.590> you<00:02:05.679> know<00:02:06.039> there<00:02:06.220> is

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
advise doing that you know there is

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.249 
advise doing that you know there is
plenty<00:02:06.700> of<00:02:06.849> space<00:02:07.060> to<00:02:07.500> run

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
plenty of space to run

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.979 
plenty of space to run
I<00:02:09.289> expect<00:02:10.160> that<00:02:10.280> when<00:02:10.399> people<00:02:10.629> commute<00:02:11.629> they

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:11.989 
I expect that when people commute they

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:14.050 
I expect that when people commute they
should<00:02:12.319> have<00:02:13.129> a<00:02:13.160> basic<00:02:13.550> ability<00:02:13.670> of

00:02:22.089 --> 00:02:22.099 
this guy and you know I understand it so

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:23.470 
this guy and you know I understand it so
speeds<00:02:22.400> he<00:02:22.519> can<00:02:22.670> be<00:02:22.760> harder<00:02:22.970> to<00:02:23.000> control<00:02:23.269> your

how<00:02:26.269> it<00:02:26.390> works<00:02:26.599> and<00:02:26.810> balance<00:02:27.140> is<00:02:27.319> probably

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
how it works and balance is probably

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
as the lights go green so we need to

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:10.809 
as the lights go green so we need to
move<00:03:09.019> into<00:03:09.170> the<00:03:09.410> lane<00:03:09.620> black<00:03:10.370> guy<00:03:10.519> doesn't

like it's a versus form I think it's

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:18.580 
like it's a versus form I think it's
just<00:03:16.940> wise<00:03:17.209> to<00:03:17.600> watch<00:03:17.750> what's<00:03:18.139> going<00:03:18.350> on<00:03:18.470> ahead

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910 
might be right at the start it doesn't

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:26.759

that's<00:04:50.590> it<00:04:50.740> for<00:04:50.890> this<00:04:50.950> week<00:04:51.190> I'll<00:04:52.000> be

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:52.030 
that's it for this week I'll be

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:54.240 
that's it for this week I'll be
continuing<00:04:52.360> the<00:04:52.630> silly<00:04:52.840> cyclists<00:04:53.260> series<00:04:53.560> but

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:54.250 
continuing the silly cyclists series but

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:55.650 
continuing the silly cyclists series but
because<00:04:54.460> it's<00:04:54.610> winter<00:04:54.730> and<00:04:54.850> it's<00:04:55.000> a<00:04:55.180> cyclist

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:55.660 
because it's winter and it's a cyclist

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:57.960 
because it's winter and it's a cyclist
I'll<00:04:55.840> be<00:04:56.140> restricting<00:04:56.710> it<00:04:56.860> to<00:04:56.890> when<00:04:57.730> I<00:04:57.760> get<00:04:57.940> a

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:57.970 
I'll be restricting it to when I get a

00:04:57.970 --> 00:04:58.560 
I'll be restricting it to when I get a
top<00:04:58.180> ten

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:58.570 
top ten

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:00.180 
top ten
so<00:04:58.780> there<00:04:59.260> may<00:04:59.350> not<00:04:59.500> be<00:04:59.560> every<00:04:59.830> week<00:04:59.980> there

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:00.190 
so there may not be every week there

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:01.380 
so there may not be every week there
maybe<00:05:00.280> every<00:05:00.520> two<00:05:00.670> weeks<00:05:00.880> maybe<00:05:01.150> every<00:05:01.360> three

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:01.390 
maybe every two weeks maybe every three

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:03.540 
maybe every two weeks maybe every three
weeks<00:05:01.720> but<00:05:02.020> I'm<00:05:02.710> gonna<00:05:02.920> look<00:05:03.070> at<00:05:03.190> keeping<00:05:03.460> this
