the<00:04:10.880> cost<00:04:11.120> though<00:04:11.389> is<00:04:11.569> a<00:04:11.599> bit<00:04:11.930> of<00:04:12.109> a<00:04:12.200> pause<00:04:12.440> it

the cost though is a bit of a pause it

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:16.029 
the cost though is a bit of a pause it
is<00:04:13.489> $40<00:04:14.269> or<00:04:14.450> 3950<00:04:15.290> depending<00:04:15.680> on<00:04:15.769> where<00:04:15.919> you're

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:16.039

at for about half an ounce which will

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:20.949 
at for about half an ounce which will
last<00:04:18.260> you<00:04:18.470> probably<00:04:18.500> maybe<00:04:19.400> a<00:04:19.579> few<00:04:19.880> weeks<00:04:20.180> at

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:20.959 
last you probably maybe a few weeks at

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:24.129 
last you probably maybe a few weeks at
most<00:04:21.019> so<00:04:22.010> there<00:04:22.250> is<00:04:22.400> some<00:04:22.820> you<00:04:23.330> know<00:04:23.450> some

00:04:24.129 --> 00:04:24.139 
most so there is some you know some

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:26.110 
most so there is some you know some
something<00:04:24.650> to<00:04:24.740> consider<00:04:25.070> there<00:04:25.400> because<00:04:26.000> it

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.120 
something to consider there because it

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:27.070 
something to consider there because it
is<00:04:26.150> a<00:04:26.240> bit<00:04:26.510> spendy

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080 
is a bit spendy

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.519 
is a bit spendy
however<00:04:27.680> as<00:04:27.919> compared<00:04:28.400> to<00:04:28.460> a<00:04:28.580> lot<00:04:28.789> of<00:04:28.820> other

end in terms of cost so that might be a

factor for you maybe not if not this is
certainly<00:04:38.829> an<00:04:39.129> eye<00:04:39.279> cream<00:04:39.339> that<00:04:39.729> you<00:04:39.849> can

00:04:40.109 --> 00:04:40.119 
certainly an eye cream that you can

00:04:40.119 --> 00:04:41.849 
certainly an eye cream that you can

is does have some potential you know for

00:04:55.239 --> 00:04:57.659 
is does have some potential you know for
irritation<00:04:55.629> although<00:04:56.559> the<00:04:57.039> risk<00:04:57.189> is<00:04:57.459> quite

00:04:57.659 --> 00:04:57.669 
irritation although the risk is quite

00:04:57.669 --> 00:04:59.519 
irritation although the risk is quite
low<00:04:58.029> there's<00:04:58.419> not<00:04:58.599> a<00:04:58.629> lot<00:04:58.929> of<00:04:58.959> people<00:04:59.169> who<00:04:59.349> have

00:04:59.519 --> 00:04:59.529 
low there's not a lot of people who have

00:04:59.529 --> 00:05:01.319 
low there's not a lot of people who have
a<00:04:59.559> synthesizing<00:05:00.249> response<00:05:00.609> to<00:05:00.819> rosemary

00:05:01.319 --> 00:05:01.329 
a synthesizing response to rosemary

00:05:01.329 --> 00:05:03.149 
a synthesizing response to rosemary
especially<00:05:02.049> in<00:05:02.139> the<00:05:02.199> low<00:05:02.379> amounts<00:05:02.709> here<00:05:02.919> so

00:05:03.149 --> 00:05:03.159 
especially in the low amounts here so

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:04.859 
especially in the low amounts here so
probably<00:05:03.759> not<00:05:03.849> something<00:05:04.029> to<00:05:04.209> consider<00:05:04.509> but

00:05:04.859 --> 00:05:04.869 
probably not something to consider but

00:05:04.869 --> 00:05:06.719 
probably not something to consider but
again<00:05:05.349> maybe<00:05:05.859> so<00:05:06.099> if<00:05:06.249> you<00:05:06.369> have<00:05:06.519> very

00:05:06.719 --> 00:05:06.729 
again maybe so if you have very

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:09.509 
again maybe so if you have very
sensitive<00:05:06.939> skin<00:05:07.239> if<00:05:07.929> you've<00:05:08.649> tried<00:05:08.979> this<00:05:09.039> and

00:05:09.509 --> 00:05:09.519

00:05:11.969 --> 00:05:11.979 
you've loved it if you hated it or if

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:13.739
