 quite a bit waiting for the introduction bubbles hence it is insisting on the 

00:00:04.509 --> 00:00:07.509
 humanity game involving the mentor of the group that reads this 

00:00:08.239 --> 00:00:11.239
 No 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.009
 8 

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:16.379
 This part of friends was creating his time as a drug building 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:17.520
 very hassle with the week 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.680
 which are together they can know new friends make a chance create ours 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.980
 first acquaintance with the rest of the group yes it is still a bit 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.010
 that you are a bit weird one or two people can commit suicide 

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:31.369
 room work owner 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:35.760
 on the same night out and with it did it but I think it is one 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:36.920
 important role 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.680
 there will come a time this week 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.660
 when you made friends for life 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:44.760
 and in it a sign that is therefore enormously worth the short time 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:47.510
 what do you expect from this week 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.680
 r tackle both indexes 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.250
 it's a great idea 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.250
 utrecht fc twente 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:00.540
 not only are new friends made, it is the first danger of it 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:05.010
 acquainted with a punishment but I have a little but I am even more often 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.610
 vs will be the first time it gets acquainted with the start it is 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.280
 actually a player who is in a tent in the morning to be strong 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.280
 talavera look rewarded for that 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.110
 in the end the position became one 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:19.760
 in tilburg it became 3 2 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:24.020
 All colleges and universities work together when entering into Bree 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.570
 the first meeting there seems to be even more fragmented in organizing Mr 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.380
 pick up all courses think your teeth introduction camp 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.020
 The nice thing is that you are right with the knowledge that gets going that directly in you 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.539
 class 

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:37.929
 The disadvantage is that you still have a small club so he gets the rest of it 

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:41.689
 In the year in tilburg everyone knows each other a little and first 

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:44.759
 all what smaller press releases people have got to know better 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.540
 much better picture of academically the conquest less 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:51.130
 what the other squares with around 13 degrees in the Kempen might also be 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.479
 because I have to start here on day one 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:56.210
 why is there a mid-March 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.280
 yes that moment the side and disappointed 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:59.940
 the game is pushing back 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.390
 with such a motor, several deliver 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:04.270
 time in vancouver 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.270
 people present probably all the way to 

00:02:08.079 --> 00:02:09.229
 that is not possible 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.469
 we have even stronger ones, the circle is not completely round yet i think 

00:02:12.469 --> 00:02:13.769
 that a year earlier 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:16.479
 yes then the chance is greatest 

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:19.049
 but because I don't get out anymore 

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:20.360
 and 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.349
 it seems you like it 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:26.249
 the introduction of these avans students is best for him 

00:02:26.249 --> 00:02:28.789
 the problem 

00:02:28.789 --> 00:02:29.439
