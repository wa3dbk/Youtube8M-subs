that<00:00:23.789> also<00:00:24.060> gives<00:00:24.210> it<00:00:24.300> an<00:00:24.390> extra<00:00:24.539> hour<00:00:24.900> of

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
that also gives it an extra hour of

that also gives it an extra hour of
battery<00:00:25.500> life<00:00:25.619> we're<00:00:25.830> jumping<00:00:26.099> up<00:00:26.189> to<00:00:26.220> 10<00:00:26.460> hour

battery<00:00:26.730> life<00:00:27.060> which<00:00:27.689> is<00:00:27.810> still<00:00:28.019> fantastic<00:00:28.439> so

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
battery life which is still fantastic so

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.099 
battery life which is still fantastic so
you<00:00:29.369> have<00:00:29.609> the<00:00:30.000> new<00:00:30.119> processor<00:00:30.660> which<00:00:30.810> is<00:00:30.840> now

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
you have the new processor which is now

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:32.749 
you have the new processor which is now
going<00:00:31.320> to<00:00:31.380> couple<00:00:31.710> up<00:00:31.830> with<00:00:31.980> the<00:00:32.070> new<00:00:32.189> intel<00:00:32.550> HD

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
going to couple up with the new intel HD

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.630 
going to couple up with the new intel HD
graphics<00:00:33.200> 6100<00:00:34.200> and<00:00:34.350> i<00:00:35.010> think<00:00:35.309> that<00:00:35.430> might<00:00:35.610> be

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
graphics 6100 and i think that might be

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.280 
graphics 6100 and i think that might be
the<00:00:35.880> one<00:00:36.090> of<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.270> most<00:00:36.390> important<00:00:36.899> parts<00:00:37.170> of

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
the one of the most important parts of

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.020 
the one of the most important parts of
this<00:00:37.440> new<00:00:37.649> upgrade<00:00:38.040> is<00:00:38.219> that<00:00:38.610> it<00:00:38.700> has<00:00:38.850> that

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
this new upgrade is that it has that

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.690 
this new upgrade is that it has that
upgraded<00:00:39.540> graphics<00:00:40.020> and<00:00:40.260> in<00:00:40.890> the<00:00:41.070> long<00:00:41.399> haul

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
upgraded graphics and in the long haul

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.819 
upgraded graphics and in the long haul
of<00:00:41.879> owning<00:00:42.149> your<00:00:42.239> Mac<00:00:42.450> you<00:00:43.079> know<00:00:43.200> five<00:00:43.559> years

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
of owning your Mac you know five years

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.400 
of owning your Mac you know five years
later<00:00:44.160> that<00:00:44.789> boost<00:00:45.180> in<00:00:45.390> graphics<00:00:45.930> is<00:00:46.050> going<00:00:46.289> to

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
later that boost in graphics is going to

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.889 
later that boost in graphics is going to
pay<00:00:46.620> off<00:00:46.829> because<00:00:47.340> really<00:00:47.640> websites<00:00:48.629> and

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
pay off because really websites and

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.260 
pay off because really websites and
things<00:00:49.110> that<00:00:49.320> everyone<00:00:49.770> does<00:00:50.100> rely<00:00:50.910> on<00:00:50.940> the

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
things that everyone does rely on the

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.990 
things that everyone does rely on the
ability<00:00:51.390> for<00:00:51.840> graphics<00:00:52.260> to<00:00:52.410> run<00:00:52.770> it<00:00:52.920> so

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:53.000 
ability for graphics to run it so

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.410 
ability for graphics to run it so
processor<00:00:54.000> boost

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
processor boost

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.900 
processor boost
we've<00:00:54.719> got<00:00:54.989> graphics<00:00:55.590> update<00:00:56.010> you<00:00:56.460> also<00:00:56.760> have

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
we've got graphics update you also have

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.520 
we've got graphics update you also have
the<00:00:57.030> new<00:00:57.149> force<00:00:57.420> touch<00:00:57.629> trackpad<00:00:57.690> on<00:00:58.410> the

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
the new force touch trackpad on the

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.220 
the new force touch trackpad on the
bottom<00:00:58.829> here<00:00:59.010> so<00:00:59.399> if<00:00:59.730> you<00:01:00.120> ever<00:01:00.510> had<00:01:00.780> a<00:01:00.809> MacBook

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
you get a great amount of clicking at

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.080 
you get a great amount of clicking at
the<00:01:04.680> bottom<00:01:05.040> but<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.250> top<00:01:05.489> left<00:01:05.760> and<00:01:05.880> top

now<00:01:08.010> they<00:01:08.430> had<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:09.150> new<00:01:09.299> design<00:01:09.659> where<00:01:09.900> it

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
now they had the the new design where it

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.840 
now they had the the new design where it
clicks<00:01:10.350> everywhere<00:01:10.799> there's<00:01:11.220> also<00:01:11.430> haptic

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
clicks everywhere there's also haptic

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.030 
clicks everywhere there's also haptic
feedback<00:01:11.909> if<00:01:12.540> you<00:01:12.630> click<00:01:12.930> down<00:01:13.170> you'll<00:01:13.740> kind

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
feedback if you click down you'll kind

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.460 
feedback if you click down you'll kind
of<00:01:14.130> feel<00:01:14.340> like<00:01:14.610> when<00:01:15.570> you<00:01:15.689> press<00:01:16.200> down<00:01:16.439> a

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
of feel like when you press down a

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.560 
of feel like when you press down a
little<00:01:16.590> further<00:01:17.009> it<00:01:17.490> kind<00:01:17.820> of<00:01:17.880> clicks<00:01:18.450> in

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
little further it kind of clicks in

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.510 
little further it kind of clicks in
again<00:01:18.930> so<00:01:19.229> let's<00:01:19.740> say<00:01:19.860> you<00:01:19.920> have<00:01:20.100> a<00:01:20.130> word<00:01:20.369> you

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
again so let's say you have a word you

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.460 
again so let's say you have a word you
want<00:01:20.700> to<00:01:20.790> define<00:01:21.090> if<00:01:21.360> you<00:01:21.720> click<00:01:21.990> and<00:01:22.229> click

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
want to define if you click and click

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.649 
want to define if you click and click
all<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:22.710> way<00:01:22.830> down<00:01:23.130> that<00:01:23.670> force<00:01:24.090> click<00:01:24.479> they

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
all the way down that force click they

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.090 
all the way down that force click they
call<00:01:24.869> it<00:01:25.080> it's<00:01:25.439> going<00:01:25.590> to<00:01:25.650> throw<00:01:25.950> up<00:01:26.070> the

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
call it it's going to throw up the

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.950 
call it it's going to throw up the
definition<00:01:26.759> for<00:01:26.939> that<00:01:27.000> word<00:01:27.270> so<00:01:27.720> you<00:01:27.750> have<00:01:27.930> a

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
definition for that word so you have a

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.539 
definition for that word so you have a
lot<00:01:28.170> of<00:01:28.320> extra<00:01:28.650> features<00:01:28.829> with<00:01:29.159> the<00:01:29.250> trackpad

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
lot of extra features with the trackpad

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.210 
lot of extra features with the trackpad
extra<00:01:30.240> battery<00:01:30.600> life<00:01:30.810> faster<00:01:31.680> processor

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
extra battery life faster processor
