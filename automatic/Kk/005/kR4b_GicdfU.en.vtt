00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:20.860 
John scary we've got ourselves a nice

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.050 
John scary we've got ourselves a nice
seat<00:01:21.860> cutting<00:01:22.220> here<00:01:22.369> which<00:01:22.490> we've<00:01:22.640> been<00:01:22.820> using

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060 
seat cutting here which we've been using

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.539 
seat cutting here which we've been using
to<00:01:23.479> good<00:01:24.259> success<00:01:24.710> the<00:01:24.890> spring<00:01:25.159> gives<00:01:25.340> a<00:01:25.430> bit

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:25.549 
to good success the spring gives a bit

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:26.950 
to good success the spring gives a bit
of<00:01:25.580> preload<00:01:26.060> and<00:01:26.270> as<00:01:26.390> you<00:01:26.509> see<00:01:26.690> it's<00:01:26.780> ball

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
of preload and as you see it's ball

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.840 
of preload and as you see it's ball
driven<00:01:27.200> so<00:01:27.470> it<00:01:27.530> can<00:01:27.680> self<00:01:27.920> align<00:01:28.250> it's<00:01:28.490> working

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
driven so it can self align it's working

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:30.130 
driven so it can self align it's working
really<00:01:29.000> well<00:01:29.180> should<00:01:29.570> have<00:01:29.659> done<00:01:29.780> this<00:01:29.899> years

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:30.140 
really well should have done this years

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.410 
really well should have done this years
ago<00:01:30.229> even<00:01:30.530> on<00:01:30.680> the<00:01:30.770> road<00:01:30.890> tech<00:01:31.130> needs<00:01:31.420> alright

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420 
ago even on the road tech needs alright

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:37.890 
ago even on the road tech needs alright
fire<00:01:32.750> that<00:01:32.960> up<00:01:33.280> bring<00:01:34.280> it<00:01:34.310> in

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:37.900 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.780 

a<00:01:37.960> little<00:01:38.560> bit<00:01:38.680> of<00:01:38.770> lubrication<00:01:39.280> for<00:01:39.670> the

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:39.790 
a little bit of lubrication for the

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:42.180 
a little bit of lubrication for the
guide<00:01:40.000> and<00:01:40.870> the<00:01:41.140> satans<00:01:41.590> and<00:01:41.740> this<00:01:41.830> would<00:01:41.980> cut

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:42.190 
guide and the satans and this would cut

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.149 
guide and the satans and this would cut
logs<00:01:42.400> silk<00:01:42.760> watch<00:01:42.970> this

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:46.159 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:49.209 

now<00:01:46.640> this<00:01:46.790> cuts<00:01:47.030> three<00:01:47.299> angles<00:01:47.950> the<00:01:48.950> first

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:49.219 
now this cuts three angles the first

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:51.069 
now this cuts three angles the first
angle<00:01:49.460> is<00:01:49.759> released<00:01:50.180> then<00:01:50.479> the<00:01:50.600> second<00:01:50.960> angle

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:51.079 
angle is released then the second angle

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:53.800 
angle is released then the second angle
is<00:01:51.350> the<00:01:51.469> 45<00:01:51.920> for<00:01:52.189> valve<00:01:52.369> seating<00:01:52.850> and<00:01:53.000> then<00:01:53.689> the

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
is the 45 for valve seating and then the

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:55.840 
is the 45 for valve seating and then the
last<00:01:53.990> angle<00:01:54.470> is<00:01:54.590> relief<00:01:54.979> and<00:01:55.189> that's<00:01:55.280> the<00:01:55.640> gas

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 
last angle is relief and that's the gas

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.919 
last angle is relief and that's the gas
flow<00:01:56.380> that's<00:01:57.380> a<00:01:57.500> bit<00:01:57.649> of<00:01:58.130> but<00:01:58.929> that's

00:01:59.919 --> 00:01:59.929 
flow that's a bit of but that's

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:01.060 
flow that's a bit of but that's
how<00:02:00.049> they<00:02:00.229> do<00:02:00.380> it<00:02:00.500> really<00:02:00.829> what<00:02:00.950> we're

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 
how they do it really what we're

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.039 
how they do it really what we're
interesting<00:02:01.369> is<00:02:01.520> a<00:02:01.549> nice<00:02:01.759> concentric<00:02:02.479> 45

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:03.049 
interesting is a nice concentric 45

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:06.039 
interesting is a nice concentric 45
there's<00:02:03.350> the<00:02:03.470> 45<00:02:03.920> coming<00:02:04.310> in<00:02:04.429> now<00:02:04.610> and<00:02:05.049> then

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:06.049 
there's the 45 coming in now and then

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:09.609 
there's the 45 coming in now and then
the<00:02:06.200> last<00:02:06.380> one<00:02:07.720> just<00:02:08.720> kicking<00:02:09.110> in<00:02:09.229> there<00:02:09.410> now

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
the last one just kicking in there now

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:10.419 
the last one just kicking in there now
that's<00:02:09.860> lovely

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
that's lovely

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:16.570 
that's lovely
all<00:02:10.729> right<00:02:10.910> bring<00:02:11.420> it<00:02:11.540> away<00:02:14.950> and<00:02:15.950> that's<00:02:16.310> done

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
all right bring it away and that's done

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:28.750 
all right bring it away and that's done
if<00:02:16.849> you<00:02:16.910> just<00:02:17.060> hang<00:02:17.269> in<00:02:17.420> there<00:02:27.730> we'll<00:02:28.730> just

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
if you just hang in there we'll just

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.820 
if you just hang in there we'll just
make<00:02:29.060> sure<00:02:29.299> that<00:02:29.330> that<00:02:29.510> seems<00:02:29.959> properly<00:02:30.410> and

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
make sure that that seems properly and

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:32.550 
make sure that that seems properly and
then<00:02:31.040> we'll<00:02:31.160> do<00:02:31.250> a<00:02:31.280> proper<00:02:31.610> vacuum<00:02:32.030> test<00:02:32.299> later

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
then we'll do a proper vacuum test later

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.050 
then we'll do a proper vacuum test later
but<00:02:33.560> I<00:02:33.620> can<00:02:33.799> tell<00:02:33.950> you<00:02:34.069> now<00:02:34.220> that<00:02:34.250> valve<00:02:34.730> seat

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
but I can tell you now that valve seat

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:44.470 
but I can tell you now that valve seat
is<00:02:35.209> going<00:02:35.390> to<00:02:35.450> be<00:02:35.569> perfect<00:02:43.269> daylight<00:02:44.269> as<00:02:44.450> a

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
is going to be perfect daylight as a

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:50.650 
is going to be perfect daylight as a
rough<00:02:44.750> check<00:02:45.370> and<00:02:46.370> get<00:02:46.519> anything

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.480 

and<00:02:51.200> then<00:02:51.320> we'll<00:02:51.440> do<00:02:51.530> a<00:02:51.560> vacuum<00:02:51.950> test<00:02:52.220> on<00:02:52.370> at

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:52.490 
and then we'll do a vacuum test on at

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:55.570 
and then we'll do a vacuum test on at
the<00:02:52.580> end<00:02:52.730> that<00:02:52.970> at<00:02:53.060> the<00:02:53.180> end<00:02:53.330> and<00:02:53.570> and<00:02:54.580> then

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:55.580 
the end that at the end and and then

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:57.070 
the end that at the end and and then
we'll<00:02:55.700> move<00:02:55.820> out<00:02:56.030> of<00:02:56.150> the<00:02:56.210> exhaust<00:02:56.450> 6<00:02:56.750> and<00:02:56.990> then

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.080 
we'll move out of the exhaust 6 and then

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:58.660 
we'll move out of the exhaust 6 and then
really<00:02:57.620> there's<00:02:57.830> nothing<00:02:57.950> stopping<00:02:58.340> us<00:02:58.490> from

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
really there's nothing stopping us from

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.170 
really there's nothing stopping us from
letting<00:02:58.790> these<00:02:58.940> heads<00:02:59.210> go<00:02:59.360> out<00:02:59.860> ok<00:03:00.880> bye<00:03:01.880> for

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
letting these heads go out ok bye for

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.210 
letting these heads go out ok bye for
now
