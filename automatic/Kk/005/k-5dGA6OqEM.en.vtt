00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.399 

so<00:01:32.110> I<00:01:32.140> guess<00:01:32.500> my<00:01:32.979> first<00:01:33.310> publication<00:01:34.210> was<00:01:34.720> this

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:47.190 
intrigued with bird photography because

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
intrigued with bird photography because

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:52.869 
there's flight interesting behavior

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:55.920 
there's flight interesting behavior
color<00:01:53.729> there's<00:01:54.729> lots<00:01:54.939> of<00:01:55.060> aspects<00:01:55.630> to<00:01:55.659> burp

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
this idea of being out there in the

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:39.000 
this idea of being out there in the
wilderness<00:02:37.200> catching<00:02:38.200> fish<00:02:38.470> to<00:02:38.620> eat<00:02:38.680> for

biology I began to look for

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:20.899 
biology I began to look for
opportunities<00:03:20.129> to<00:03:20.340> get<00:03:20.430> involved<00:03:20.819> in

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
more just in view I mean the forest is

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:53.179 
more just in view I mean the forest is
is<00:03:48.720> so<00:03:48.989> tall<00:03:49.319> I<00:03:51.439> got<00:03:52.439> a<00:03:52.470> friend<00:03:52.739> to<00:03:52.799> bring<00:03:52.950> out

00:03:53.179 --> 00:03:53.189 
is so tall I got a friend to bring out

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:55.970 
is so tall I got a friend to bring out
some<00:03:53.489> ropes<00:03:53.730> and<00:03:54.060> I<00:03:54.239> was<00:03:54.540> able<00:03:55.139> to<00:03:55.169> climb<00:03:55.859> up

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
some ropes and I was able to climb up

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.009 
some ropes and I was able to climb up
the<00:03:56.099> rope<00:03:56.280> and<00:03:56.519> and<00:03:56.699> get<00:03:57.419> up<00:03:57.540> there<00:03:57.720> and<00:03:57.840> that's

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:58.019 
the rope and and get up there and that's

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:00.050 
the rope and and get up there and that's
kind<00:03:58.229> of<00:03:58.260> what<00:03:58.440> got<00:03:58.470> me<00:03:58.769> started<00:03:59.069> on<00:03:59.280> exploring

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
kind of what got me started on exploring

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:06.170 
kind of what got me started on exploring
the<00:04:00.180> rainforest<00:04:00.659> canopy<00:04:04.849> since<00:04:05.849> few

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
the rainforest canopy since few

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.379 
the rainforest canopy since few
scientists<00:04:06.840> bother<00:04:07.530> to<00:04:07.949> take<00:04:08.729> that<00:04:08.940> difficult

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:09.389 
scientists bother to take that difficult

00:04:09.389 --> 00:04:11.300 
scientists bother to take that difficult
step<00:04:09.629> of<00:04:09.750> climbing<00:04:10.229> up<00:04:10.319> into<00:04:10.530> the<00:04:10.650> treetops<00:04:11.069> it

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
step of climbing up into the treetops it

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:13.460 
step of climbing up into the treetops it
was<00:04:11.400> really<00:04:11.579> kind<00:04:11.790> of<00:04:11.819> a<00:04:11.879> wide-open<00:04:12.150> field<00:04:12.720> of

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
was really kind of a wide-open field of

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:18.500 
was really kind of a wide-open field of
research<00:04:16.010> that<00:04:17.010> canopy<00:04:17.489> level<00:04:17.940> of<00:04:18.030> the<00:04:18.120> forest

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 
research that canopy level of the forest

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:24.720 
research that canopy level of the forest
is<00:04:18.659> really<00:04:18.840> where<00:04:19.320> most<00:04:19.620> of<00:04:19.829> the<00:04:19.919> action<00:04:20.130> is
