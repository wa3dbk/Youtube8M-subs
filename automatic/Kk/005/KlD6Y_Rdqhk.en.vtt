00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
yeast to the controls who was at my

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:29.529 
yeast to the controls who was at my
break<00:04:25.130> what<00:04:26.240> what<00:04:27.240> was<00:04:27.419> that

00:04:29.529 --> 00:04:29.539 
break what what was that

00:04:29.539 --> 00:04:37.080

so has a great big train that don't be
crashing<00:04:40.000> into<00:04:40.210> that<00:04:42.090> and<00:04:43.090> I<00:04:43.180> don't<00:04:43.330> think<00:04:43.570> I'm

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:43.660 
crashing into that and I don't think I'm

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:45.740 
crashing into that and I don't think I'm
doing<00:04:43.860> particularly<00:04:44.860> well<00:04:45.010> at<00:04:45.280> the<00:04:45.340> moment

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:45.750

the<00:05:09.930> graphics<00:05:10.379> are<00:05:10.650> pretty<00:05:11.009> basic<00:05:11.430> but

00:05:11.749 --> 00:05:11.759 
the graphics are pretty basic but

00:05:11.759 --> 00:05:16.640 
the graphics are pretty basic but
they're<00:05:12.180> okay<00:05:12.629> oh<00:05:14.060> that<00:05:15.060> was<00:05:15.210> a<00:05:15.240> bit<00:05:15.479> too<00:05:15.870> fast

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:16.650 
they're okay oh that was a bit too fast

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:19.580 
they're okay oh that was a bit too fast
into<00:05:16.889> the<00:05:17.039> corner<00:05:17.430> ah<00:05:17.990> it's<00:05:18.990> quite<00:05:19.229> easy<00:05:19.349> to

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:19.590 
into the corner ah it's quite easy to

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:22.520 
into the corner ah it's quite easy to
control<00:05:20.240> well<00:05:21.240> it<00:05:21.659> would<00:05:21.870> be<00:05:21.900> if<00:05:22.139> I<00:05:22.289> was<00:05:22.379> any

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:22.530

00:05:25.399 --> 00:05:25.409 
good well let's go the right way there

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:28.670 
good well let's go the right way there
and<00:05:26.719> it<00:05:27.719> looks<00:05:27.900> like<00:05:28.050> it's<00:05:28.199> gonna<00:05:28.289> be<00:05:28.379> a<00:05:28.469> fun

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:28.680 
and it looks like it's gonna be a fun

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:30.559 
and it looks like it's gonna be a fun
little<00:05:28.830> game<00:05:28.979> and<00:05:29.819> I'll<00:05:30.000> be<00:05:30.090> interested<00:05:30.330> to
