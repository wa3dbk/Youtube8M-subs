00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:03.600
 order then dear viewers themselves children 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.130
 continue to revive the godparents module 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.420
 mikroft today we look at the mod 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.010
 which is called the ocean 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.940
 This mod adds a lot to the game. 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.799
 various submarine boats as well 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:14.849
 snorkeling gear 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:17.760
 let's see what if 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.980
 so interesting first body 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.050
 show this super cool boats like 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.789
 it says this boat can all know 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.550
 this is a wooden boat she is very slow 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:29.699
 ate moving as well here added 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:32.940
 two more types of boats is a boat made of iron and 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.649
 boat from atlanta mind than this ore 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.050
 which is added these mods a little later 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.969
 show so here's the first boat which 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.210
 maybe we all know this wooden come on 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:44.640
 put somewhere so let and well today 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.079
 we win somehow tricky needed 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.239
 put these boats something that being on 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.829
 sea level is not just not put so 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.309
 that you need to put them somehow here 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.600
 slightly higher than we are usually 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:57.570
 there is some kind of feast to build or type 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.300
 of that so right now I put them 1 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.940
 this boat is wooden 2 vodka iron 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.189
 this one with Atlanta crazy the boat decided to 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.110
 we are here to climb up so 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.090
 let's check first with what 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.189
 speed our iron boat rides so 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.979
 wait for him for me she is already trying without 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:16.890
 leave me so well, I wouldn't say that 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:19.110
 much so quickly but okay figured out 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.900
 so let's look at the boat from 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.900
 Atlanta mind so she under the eyelids is by 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:28.140
 the idea has to be very soon come on 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.880
 let's go picking up speed too 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.370
 much like a fast so maybe you need 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.070
 turn off flight mode 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:36.890
 so turn off the flight mode we climb in 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:40.220
 he doesn't have a boat now 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:42.020
 same slow and what previous 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.830
 although it may be a little bit faster than 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.770
 iron 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:48.680
 but 4 it also podglyuchivaet so okay not 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.570
 and for that we love this mod and for that 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:55.190
 he adds boats in which you can 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:58.670
 shove a chest here's a boat from atlanta mind 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:01.130
 here is an iron boat here is a wooden boat 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.110
 These boats, in theory, can only be found on 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.980
 bottom of the ocean here are such interesting 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.260
 places 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:08.780
 it's like an underwater observatory now 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:10.790
 I will show you so for a start I climbed in 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.070
 wooden boat in theory it will already be 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:14.540
 much faster yes here's a wooden boat 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:16.700
 it is wooden to develop such 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.310
 mad speed iron boat yet 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.840
 faster at stake let me go back to me 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.900
 somehow laziness lithium so back by 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:26.840
 your iron boat so give us a lift 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:28.820
 gaining momentum let's somehow it 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.890
 a little sausage but speed 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:34.280
 really very, very big way 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:37.130
 jump uhh uhh flew lim just 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:40.700
 mad speed so she runs away from here 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:43.100
 shoo shoo from the shore got settled and 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:47.000
 it is not clear that and to whom we climb into this 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:50.540
 boat say so climb well take me 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:53.239
 take damn mad boat does not want me 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.950
 nowhere to drive so is the boat from atlante 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:57.410
 mono in theory develops at all 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:59.959
 stock exchanges and the lowest speed pancake speed 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:02.600
 after the wall crazy so jump off and 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:04.489
 all 1 rushed so if you happen to be with 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:06.680
 her watch it all may be about what 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:08.630
 you had to climb in 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.430
 inventory of this boat as I show now 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:13.100
 right here to dawn 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:15.320
 Swift the boat you need to hold shift 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:20.200
 and right click on it click 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:23.150
 we click and it doesn't always work out like that 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:25.820
 here finally climbed vintar and here 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:28.670
 it is written that we are in this chest 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:30.830
 atlantic boat general such matters so 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:34.980
 flew see what else of the interesting in 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:37.780
 this is the sea you after all that carried away 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:40.239
 still this mod adds cool blocks 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:42.340
 they are also found in these submarines 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:44.650
 observatories are also still a developer not 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:47.200
 completed the columns like here 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:49.840
 these blocks of them can be done either here 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:51.910
 such bricks or you can craft 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.590
 attacks the column of her for the time being textures 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:55.959
 no, he is only there today 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:58.000
 dopilivat started small today 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:59.470
 update of these submarines 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.340
 there are such observatories 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:02.769
 chests 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.959
 it 's like a spawner chest in it always 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:07.510
 there is some kind of garbage now i'm his 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:09.519
 I put the show's maiden Now put 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:11.680
 and he is already full in it as if randomly 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:14.620
 you can find anything or a boat there 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:17.350
 can find either underwater some 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:19.180
 bathyscaphe there any clothes diamonds need 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:21.190
 and as usual a chest just with 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:24.580
 adding some kind of funny 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:26.820
 buns can still be found in this underwater 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:29.830
 here's an observatory 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:32.290
 atlantic de pulsar which feeds 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:34.540
 the center of pearls and devours the water around 

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:37.090
 Type as before when the sponge worked 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:39.340
 can someone else remember general poke 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:41.140
 he ender pearl ohm and he devours in 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:45.690
 the taste for water at a very long distance 

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:48.120
 and traders appeared here somewhere 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:50.860
 some kind of glitch 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:54.880
 because have not yet decided to kill yourself as a man 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:58.440
 already stop young gay him your 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:05:02.110
 atmosphere from likely due to the fact that 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:04.479
 this block is found from exactly inside 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:06.940
 here these here is gray to the buttock underwater and 

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:09.100
 there are always these builder tusyat and so 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:10.539
 he is most likely just baptized along with 

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:12.580
 Spawner these geeks 

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:14.770
 and if you will put it leave 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:16.000
 neater it guys from spawn and 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:19.750
 flippers stick together 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.970
 In general, this dealt with this mod 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:24.880
 and adds a cool old she 

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:27.580
 more common at the bottom of the ocean though 

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:29.680
 small speech which occurs on the background 

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:32.440
 sand here and so she recovered somewhere 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:34.810
 and and bury so here she see how 

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:38.320
 such a sand color and when I have her 

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:40.330
 also collect you getting work and here are 

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:42.310
 here then you can teach them 

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:45.670
 cool bars that is, look 

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:47.710
 we transform this here about ore 

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:50.470
 on well in the stove just pinch you 

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:52.600
 get roast atlantic after that we 

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:54.910
 we can fry it again 

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:57.100
 atlanta to you from this atlanta and we already 

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:57.690
 we can and there are some cool 

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:00.250
 things 

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:02.350
 let's say that we can craft it 

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:05.650
 can you tell me such a trident 

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:08.890
 awesome for him you need two fried 

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:10.810
 Atlanta and Atlanta in the morning we get 

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:12.430
 such an awesome trident which 

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:15.460
 looks pretty good at him 

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:17.530
 damage 9 but attack 9 and not quite 

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:20.620
 sour under water it will be possible for someone there 

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:22.300
 I do not know for a fig harsh octopus and either 

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:24.250
 if you put some more 

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:26.110
 additionally mod on animals then 

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:29.020
 is pretty shark 

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:32.260
 nice yet this mod adds two 

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:34.720
 awesome stuff is underwater bathysphere 

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:36.640
 and a helmet that allows you to breathe 

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:39.130
 beard more and also you have it 

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:40.450
 imposes the effect of night vision so 

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:42.130
 what can you do under water 

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:43.630
 sees everything much better now we 

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:46.420
 crawled under will I turn it on 

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:49.090
 look in the arena and turn on 1 and see 

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:51.970
 the difference is now without a helmet part 

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:52.480
 wearing a helmet and we just see everything 

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:54.760
 awesome 

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:57.610
 I would also like shaders pack so and so 

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:59.890
 everything is clearly visible but with this helmet it’s just 

00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:02.400
 general beauty and everything can be seen everywhere 

00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:04.840
 let's spawn our batysphere 

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:05.770
 that's so cool we look like being 

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:08.290
 our sphere 

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:10.810
 we can swim say now found 

00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:13.570
 flooded observatory though she is quite 

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:16.750
 not flooded himself he is sitting there too 

00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:19.750
 merchants there spawn a little chest here 

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:22.240
 by the way how do you swim in our helmet checks 

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:25.270
 also looks pretty nice when 

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:27.670
 in this way the helmet floated inside here 

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:31.780
 there is always one approach 

00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:33.940
 which is not flooded general here can 

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:36.490
 inside go here is the merchants with 

00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:38.650
 they can trade this block 

00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:39.250
 who devours the water here stands right 

00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:42.160
 at the entrance 

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:45.100
 so here the water never swims not 

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:48.400
 that is, there are these blocks 

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:50.620
 which are called limestone and their too 

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:52.720
 you can get to make yourself from them attacks 

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:55.210
 masonry principle i don't know but 

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:57.850
 here it looks good to itself so 

00:07:55.210 --> 00:07:59.680
 can make such a temporary base on 

00:07:57.850 --> 00:08:00.430
 the bottom of the ocean float here on your 

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:02.800
 go around the sphere 

00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:04.150
 all pretty pretty in general i 

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:05.949
 I hope you like it for you 

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:07.720
