00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.450
 Y 

00:00:04.509 --> 00:00:07.049
 i 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:14.540
 policies as they are I know that many of 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.730
 you are about to have your parties 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:18.530
 graduations or then you never miss that 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:20.660
 invite some party and you do not know what 

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:22.010
 hairstyle to use in this video I want 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.720
 show you an option that the truth is 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:25.310
 very simple to recreate and I think that you 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.140
 is going to get out of this kind of trouble let's go 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.670
 with the video to start we're going to 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.530
 select the hair that is by the 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:32.780
 part of the front because we're going to leave 

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:34.460
 these millions for the end try that 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.230
 when they select it, they are more or less 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.270
 of the same thickness 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.220
 then in the rest of the mane we are going to 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:42.500
 divide it into two sections also more or 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:44.030
 less than a similar size and in each 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.309
 of these sections we will make a ponytail 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.900
 when it looks like that hair for your 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:50.809
 two pigtails also try not to 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:52.519
 note the division match because at 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:55.180
 final we want all this to shape us 

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:57.100
 a single chongo 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.510
 so that we do not cause trouble 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.550
 hair that we have left loose in the 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:01.990
 opposite we're going to hold it for 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.700
 a little while with the help of some lists 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:05.830
 some pieces or whatever you have there at the 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:07.840
 hand we will have two pigtails in 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:09.880
 the back we're going to start 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.950
 taking one and we're going to divide her 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.600
 once in two sections in each of 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.280
 these two sections we are going to make a 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.290
 braid of three segments of those of the 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.850
 normal the procedure to do 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:20.440
 these braids is going by 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:24.340
 alternately the strands that 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:26.350
 remain on the banks towards middle 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.299
 Once the entire lock is woven we will have 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.009
 to hold with a league of preference 

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:31.630
 of the color of our hair and therefore 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:33.700
 It never hurts to pull sideways 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:37.590
 to make our braid a braid 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.590
 more relaxed and therefore with more personality 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.990
 in the other section of that same queue 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.600
 we will have to do exactly the same 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:02.300
 let's create again a braid of 3 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.250
 segments to the tips we are going to hold it 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.810
 with a color preference league of 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.370
 our hair and we are going to pull it towards 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.820
 the sides again to make it look more 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:09.820
 chubby girl 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.720
 in the other queue where we still have 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.970
 free hair we can do 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.430
 again two braids or if you prefer 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.650
 as in my case I only made one 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.360
 last braid once ready all 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.880
 our braids what we are going to do is 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:32.400
 take an I for example I took the most 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.990
 chubby and I started to mess around 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.670
 of the leagues that are the basis of my 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:37.980
 pigtails well I do not know if I explain myself but 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.900
 the thing is to entangle the around the 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.120
 Legs and hold it with several pins 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.680
 you must ensure that it is very well subject 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.480
 in our hair so as 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.150
 place several pins as well 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.950
 always trying not to be seen and 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:53.060
 also trying that the tips of your 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.060
 braid that well hidden 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.950
 to place my third and last train 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.900
 quote to me has remained let's say like a 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.519
 hollow in the middle portion so 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.440
 I'm going to use it to fill 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:10.540
 this hole and then as I finish 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.519
 forming a chongo in the end again 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:17.010
 before placing my pins I 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:17.010
 I make sure the tips are hidden 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.620
 since we have seen the part 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:26.049
 from behind we will release the strands that 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.730
 we have left in the front 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:30.590
 this we are going to take gently towards 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:32.690
 back as above our chongo 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:35.150
 and we are going to spin gently to form 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:37.069
 a few small rolls when you like 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.830
 the shape of your roll you should put it 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:41.450
 also with the help of some pins 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:42.980
 we will do the same in the other section and if 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:44.959
 you can help you with a little brush 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:46.370
 to make the hair because then 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:48.519
 Now we are already giving the touches 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:48.519
 final 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:57.370
 if you notice, I tried that the tips of 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:59.290
 both strands coincided because in 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:01.689
 these tips I want to create a last 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:03.340
 braid it is again going to take 

00:04:01.689 --> 00:04:07.530
 the strands that stay on the sides 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.530
 towards the middle part alternately 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:23.509
 to this braid, as it is going to be 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:25.009
 our last braid tries to give 

00:04:23.509 --> 00:04:26.479
 as more love when pulling the 

00:04:25.009 --> 00:04:28.000
 strands and cough sideways because 

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:31.539
 we want it to be as well as more 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.539
 pretty the finish 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:43.009
 once you've liked the way 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:44.479
 your braid takes some pins and 

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:48.910
 place them again 

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:48.910
 trying to hide the tips and ready 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:54.810
 I hope you liked this option 

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:56.370
 and this video also you liked and 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:58.140
