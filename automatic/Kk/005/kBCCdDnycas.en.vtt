things like that and I thought I'd be a

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.700 
things like that and I thought I'd be a
bit<00:00:23.970> more<00:00:24.090> classy<00:00:24.510> with<00:00:24.630> it<00:00:24.779> I'm<00:00:24.960> rolling<00:00:25.560> just

proper<00:00:29.010> mind<00:00:29.250> before<00:00:29.400> also<00:00:29.670> do<00:00:30.029> like<00:00:30.359> you<00:00:30.539> know

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
proper mind before also do like you know

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.600 
proper mind before also do like you know
experiments<00:00:31.410> in<00:00:31.470> places<00:00:31.800> if<00:00:31.859> it's<00:00:32.070> got<00:00:32.189> TNT

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
experiments in places if it's got TNT

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.720 
experiments in places if it's got TNT
involved<00:00:33.000> stuff<00:00:33.270> so<00:00:33.600> this<00:00:34.050> is<00:00:34.170> my<00:00:34.260> like

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:34.730 
involved stuff so this is my like

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.569 
involved stuff so this is my like
experimental<00:00:35.730> lab<00:00:36.590> and<00:00:37.590> ice<00:00:38.040> off<00:00:38.219> messed<00:00:38.460> this

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
experimental lab and ice off messed this

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.639 
experimental lab and ice off messed this
up<00:00:38.820> I<00:00:39.059> just<00:00:39.329> know<00:00:39.450> it<00:00:39.719> tastes<00:00:39.960> on<00:00:40.050> TNT<00:00:40.469> we

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
up I just know it tastes on TNT we

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.160 
up I just know it tastes on TNT we
should<00:00:40.770> have<00:00:40.920> a<00:00:40.980> mistake<00:00:41.340> so<00:00:41.730> you<00:00:42.329> know<00:00:42.450> it's

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
should have a mistake so you know it's

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.540 
should have a mistake so you know it's
like<00:00:43.350> broken<00:00:44.149> you<00:00:45.149> know<00:00:45.239> I<00:00:45.270> fix<00:00:45.539> it<00:00:45.660> later<00:00:45.750> so

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:46.550 
like broken you know I fix it later so

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.340 
like broken you know I fix it later so
the<00:00:47.550> topic<00:00:48.059> for<00:00:48.270> this<00:00:48.450> video<00:00:48.629> is<00:00:48.989> actually

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
the topic for this video is actually

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.889 
the topic for this video is actually
could<00:00:49.440> be<00:00:49.469> timers<00:00:50.010> in<00:00:50.789> specifically<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.629> six

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
could be timers in specifically the six

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.889 
could be timers in specifically the six
minute<00:00:52.199> time<00:00:52.410> used<00:00:53.399> in<00:00:53.850> Persia

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
minute time used in Persia

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.240 
minute time used in Persia
so<00:00:55.110> we'll<00:00:55.230> go<00:00:55.350> to<00:00:55.410> the<00:00:55.590> experimental

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
so we'll go to the experimental

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.119 
so we'll go to the experimental
environment<00:00:56.789> which<00:00:56.910> is<00:00:57.030> here<00:00:57.770> basically<00:00:58.770> the

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
environment which is here basically the

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.150 
environment which is here basically the
timer<00:00:59.969> used<00:01:00.449> in<00:01:00.809> predator<00:01:01.410> was<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:01.710> same<00:01:01.920> one

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
timer used in predator was the same one

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.979 
timer used in predator was the same one
that<00:01:02.190> sethbling<00:01:02.730> and<00:01:03.030> hypixel<00:01:03.300> used<00:01:03.660> in<00:01:03.809> their

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
that sethbling and hypixel used in their

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.830 
that sethbling and hypixel used in their
Team<00:01:04.170> Fortress<00:01:04.409> 2<00:01:04.710> map<00:01:04.920> and<00:01:05.299> it<00:01:06.299> was<00:01:06.450> really

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
Team Fortress 2 map and it was really

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.899 
Team Fortress 2 map and it was really
big<00:01:07.170> it<00:01:07.409> was<00:01:07.500> really<00:01:07.950> long<00:01:08.159> it<00:01:08.520> was<00:01:08.670> longer

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
big it was really long it was longer

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.760 
big it was really long it was longer
than<00:01:09.119> this<00:01:09.299> and<00:01:09.659> it<00:01:10.200> worked

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
than this and it worked

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.609 
than this and it worked
slightly<00:01:11.220> but<00:01:11.790> I<00:01:12.000> didn't<00:01:12.570> like<00:01:13.049> it<00:01:13.350> was<00:01:13.470> too

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
slightly but I didn't like it was too

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.039 
slightly but I didn't like it was too
big<00:01:13.860> I<00:01:14.070> wanted<00:01:14.909> to<00:01:14.970> condense<00:01:15.390> it<00:01:15.630> although<00:01:15.810> I'm

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
big I wanted to condense it although I'm

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.120 
big I wanted to condense it although I'm
looking<00:01:16.290> at<00:01:16.350> this<00:01:16.439> there's<00:01:16.619> nothing<00:01:16.710> to<00:01:16.920> do<00:01:17.009> it

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
looking at this there's nothing to do it

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.590 
looking at this there's nothing to do it
this<00:01:17.280> is<00:01:17.430> what<00:01:17.640> I'm<00:01:17.729> supposed<00:01:18.090> to<00:01:18.330> be<00:01:18.390> looking

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
this is what I'm supposed to be looking

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.810 
this is what I'm supposed to be looking
at<00:01:18.720> it<00:01:19.290> was<00:01:19.409> too<00:01:19.560> big<00:01:19.770> and<00:01:19.979> it<00:01:20.340> wasn't<00:01:20.580> as

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
at it was too big and it wasn't as

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.800 
at it was too big and it wasn't as
robust<00:01:21.860> as<00:01:22.860> this<00:01:23.790> one<00:01:24.030> I'll<00:01:24.330> show<00:01:24.390> you<00:01:24.570> I<00:01:24.600> mean

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
robust as this one I'll show you I mean

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.410 
robust as this one I'll show you I mean
basically<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:26.100> way<00:01:26.220> these<00:01:26.400> timers<00:01:26.729> work<00:01:27.060> is

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
basically the way these timers work is

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.179 
basically the way these timers work is
that<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:27.869> minecart<00:01:28.350> will<00:01:28.650> go<00:01:28.770> up<00:01:28.829> to<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:28.979> top

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
that the minecart will go up to the top

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.490 
that the minecart will go up to the top
and<00:01:29.430> will<00:01:29.520> fall<00:01:29.759> through<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.240> cobwebs<00:01:30.780> now

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
and will fall through the cobwebs now

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.620 
and will fall through the cobwebs now
for<00:01:31.650> those<00:01:31.710> who<00:01:31.770> don't<00:01:32.100> know<00:01:32.189> a<00:01:32.549> cobweb<00:01:33.119> well

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
for those who don't know a cobweb well

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.630 
for those who don't know a cobweb well
when<00:01:33.810> a<00:01:33.840> Minecraft<00:01:34.320> minecart<00:01:35.009> false<00:01:35.400> or

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
when a Minecraft minecart false or

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.730 
when a Minecraft minecart false or
cobweb<00:01:36.030> it<00:01:36.180> takes<00:01:36.360> exactly<00:01:36.840> 30<00:01:37.110> seconds<00:01:37.619> to

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
cobweb it takes exactly 30 seconds to

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.310 
cobweb it takes exactly 30 seconds to
travel<00:01:38.009> through<00:01:38.159> it<00:01:38.310> so<00:01:38.939> it'll<00:01:39.689> take<00:01:39.900> a<00:01:39.930> minute

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
travel through it so it'll take a minute

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.050 
travel through it so it'll take a minute
for<00:01:40.530> it<00:01:40.770> to<00:01:40.860> pass<00:01:41.070> through<00:01:41.100> these<00:01:41.430> two<00:01:41.490> that's

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
for it to pass through these two that's

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.100 
for it to pass through these two that's
like<00:01:42.180> a<00:01:42.240> minutes<00:01:42.450> pass<00:01:42.570> through<00:01:42.720> those<00:01:42.869> those

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
like a minutes pass through those those

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.730 
like a minutes pass through those those
those<00:01:43.140> those<00:01:43.380> those<00:01:44.060> six<00:01:45.060> minutes<00:01:45.360> overall

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
those those those six minutes overall

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.770 
those those those six minutes overall
now<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:46.799> way<00:01:47.100> it<00:01:47.189> was<00:01:47.310> split<00:01:47.610> up<00:01:47.759> in<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.240> last

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
now the way it was split up in the last

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.090 
now the way it was split up in the last
time<00:01:49.079> that<00:01:49.110> we<00:01:49.320> used<00:01:49.530> is<00:01:49.740> it<00:01:49.860> was<00:01:49.950> an

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
time that we used is it was an

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.069 
time that we used is it was an
individual<00:01:50.850> just<00:01:51.659> single<00:01:53.689> cobweb<00:01:54.689> so<00:01:54.840> yeah<00:01:54.990> so

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
individual just single cobweb so yeah so

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.690 
individual just single cobweb so yeah so
it<00:01:55.140> goes<00:01:55.259> if<00:01:55.500> falls<00:01:55.710> through<00:01:55.890> one<00:01:56.100> cobweb<00:01:56.490> then

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
it goes if falls through one cobweb then

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:57.859 
it goes if falls through one cobweb then
goes<00:01:56.880> to<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.090> next<00:01:57.299> one<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:57.659> next<00:01:57.689> one

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
goes to the next one the next one

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.990 
goes to the next one the next one
individually<00:01:58.469> so<00:01:59.040> that<00:01:59.070> if<00:01:59.280> the<00:01:59.399> game<00:01:59.579> ends

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
individually so that if the game ends

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.580 
individually so that if the game ends
because<00:02:00.180> most<00:02:00.509> games<00:02:00.750> sprung<00:02:01.079> last<00:02:01.350> six

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
because most games sprung last six

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.980 
because most games sprung last six
minutes<00:02:01.710> when<00:02:02.430> the<00:02:02.520> game<00:02:02.640> ends<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.540> minecart

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
minutes when the game ends the minecart

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.749 
minutes when the game ends the minecart
rather<00:02:04.469> than<00:02:04.590> going<00:02:04.710> into<00:02:04.950> the<00:02:05.070> next<00:02:05.310> cobweb

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
rather than going into the next cobweb

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.190 
rather than going into the next cobweb
or<00:02:05.880> actually<00:02:06.210> hit<00:02:06.360> the<00:02:06.450> track<00:02:06.719> and<00:02:06.869> go<00:02:06.960> back<00:02:07.110> to

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
or actually hit the track and go back to

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.670 
or actually hit the track and go back to
the<00:02:07.290> start

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
the start

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.919 
the start
and<00:02:07.979> so<00:02:08.670> the<00:02:08.759> reason<00:02:08.879> was<00:02:09.090> split<00:02:09.330> up<00:02:09.539> was

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
and so the reason was split up was

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.839 
and so the reason was split up was
because<00:02:10.050> if<00:02:10.319> it<00:02:10.410> was<00:02:10.500> one<00:02:10.649> big<00:02:10.860> drop<00:02:11.220> you

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
because if it was one big drop you

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.490 
because if it was one big drop you
wouldn't<00:02:12.180> be<00:02:12.270> able<00:02:12.360> to<00:02:12.480> get<00:02:12.720> rid<00:02:12.810> of<00:02:12.930> the<00:02:13.080> monk

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
wouldn't be able to get rid of the monk

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.070 
wouldn't be able to get rid of the monk
you'd<00:02:13.920> have<00:02:14.100> to<00:02:14.130> wait<00:02:14.460> six<00:02:14.880> minutes<00:02:15.240> we<00:02:16.050> should

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
you'd have to wait six minutes we should

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.340 
you'd have to wait six minutes we should
be<00:02:16.260> a<00:02:16.410> bit<00:02:16.650> rubbish<00:02:17.460> really<00:02:17.880> but<00:02:18.630> the<00:02:19.080> problem

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
be a bit rubbish really but the problem

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.010 
be a bit rubbish really but the problem
with<00:02:19.470> that<00:02:19.500> timer<00:02:20.010> was<00:02:20.640> that<00:02:20.880> if<00:02:21.300> it<00:02:21.510> just<00:02:21.810> went

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
with that timer was that if it just went

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.940 
with that timer was that if it just went
since<00:02:22.170> an<00:02:22.230> S<00:02:22.350> when<00:02:22.470> you<00:02:22.530> have<00:02:22.650> to<00:02:22.710> wait<00:02:22.830> 30

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
since an S when you have to wait 30

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.610 
since an S when you have to wait 30
seconds<00:02:23.430> to<00:02:23.520> the<00:02:23.550> next<00:02:23.790> game<00:02:23.940> to<00:02:24.090> start<00:02:24.360> so<00:02:25.170> it

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
seconds to the next game to start so it

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.200 
seconds to the next game to start so it
was<00:02:25.740> bitter<00:02:26.040> wish<00:02:26.280> this<00:02:26.670> is<00:02:26.820> a<00:02:26.850> lot<00:02:27.090> more

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:27.210 
was bitter wish this is a lot more

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:31.010 
was bitter wish this is a lot more
compact<00:02:28.170> so<00:02:28.680> if<00:02:28.860> we<00:02:29.040> we<00:02:29.910> start<00:02:30.210> this<00:02:30.420> so<00:02:30.660> the

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
compact so if we we start this so the

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.290 
compact so if we we start this so the
start<00:02:31.380> button<00:02:31.560> here<00:02:31.800> the<00:02:32.790> other<00:02:32.910> downside<00:02:33.240> it

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
start button here the other downside it

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:34.490 
start button here the other downside it
takes<00:02:33.450> a<00:02:33.510> bit<00:02:33.660> of<00:02:33.690> time<00:02:33.870> for<00:02:33.900> the<00:02:34.050> minecart<00:02:34.410> to

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
takes a bit of time for the minecart to

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:35.960 
takes a bit of time for the minecart to
go<00:02:34.590> up<00:02:34.650> to<00:02:34.740> the<00:02:34.800> top<00:02:35.040> but<00:02:35.190> in<00:02:35.340> like<00:02:35.550> presence

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
go up to the top but in like presence

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.090 
go up to the top but in like presence
and<00:02:36.180> stuff<00:02:36.360> it's<00:02:36.990> not<00:02:37.110> a<00:02:37.140> big<00:02:37.470> deal<00:02:37.620> so<00:02:37.890> six

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
and stuff it's not a big deal so six

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.840 
and stuff it's not a big deal so six
minutes<00:02:38.400> remaining

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
minutes remaining

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.630 
minutes remaining
that's<00:02:39.450> that<00:02:39.660> commandblocks<00:02:40.650> days<00:02:40.860> and

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
that's that commandblocks days and

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:42.950 
that's that commandblocks days and
they'll<00:02:41.730> take<00:02:41.910> a<00:02:41.970> minute<00:02:42.300> you'll<00:02:42.450> hit<00:02:42.660> and

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:42.960 
they'll take a minute you'll hit and

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.510 
they'll take a minute you'll hit and
then<00:02:43.260> to<00:02:43.440> activate<00:02:43.770> these<00:02:43.890> I'll<00:02:44.100> hit<00:02:44.280> some

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520 
then to activate these I'll hit some

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.430 
then to activate these I'll hit some
tripwire<00:02:45.180> so<00:02:45.810> that's<00:02:45.959> why<00:02:46.020> there's<00:02:46.200> a<00:02:46.230> gap

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
tripwire so that's why there's a gap

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.500 
tripwire so that's why there's a gap
there<00:02:46.680> you<00:02:46.860> don't<00:02:47.010> have<00:02:47.100> to<00:02:47.340> have<00:02:47.459> the<00:02:47.610> gap<00:02:47.820> if

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
there you don't have to have the gap if

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.210 
there you don't have to have the gap if
you<00:02:48.840> don't<00:02:49.020> want<00:02:49.140> to<00:02:49.200> have<00:02:49.290> it<00:02:49.440> to<00:02:49.590> tell<00:02:50.100> you

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
you don't want to have it to tell you

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.280 
you don't want to have it to tell you
how<00:02:50.400> many<00:02:50.459> minutes<00:02:51.300> are<00:02:51.450> left<00:02:51.510> or<00:02:51.870> any<00:02:52.020> vets

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
how many minutes are left or any vets

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.050 
how many minutes are left or any vets
don't<00:02:52.470> coming<00:02:52.800> out<00:02:52.890> of<00:02:53.040> it<00:02:53.190> you<00:02:53.550> don't<00:02:53.580> need<00:02:53.880> it

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
don't coming out of it you don't need it

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.720 
don't coming out of it you don't need it
but<00:02:54.450> I<00:02:54.510> did<00:02:54.780> so<00:02:55.080> I've<00:02:55.320> added<00:02:55.440> in<00:02:55.709> a<00:02:55.890> bit<00:02:56.670> of

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
but I did so I've added in a bit of

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.480 
but I did so I've added in a bit of
tripwire<00:02:57.570> there<00:02:57.810> so<00:02:58.440> the<00:02:58.860> way<00:02:59.010> you<00:02:59.070> get<00:02:59.310> this

00:02:59.480 --> 00:02:59.490 
tripwire there so the way you get this

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:01.430 
tripwire there so the way you get this
minecart<00:03:00.090> out<00:03:00.209> of<00:03:00.420> it<00:03:00.540> it<00:03:00.660> can<00:03:00.780> play<00:03:00.870> tell<00:03:01.230> to

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
minecart out of it it can play tell to

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.410 
minecart out of it it can play tell to
be<00:03:01.560> honest<00:03:01.770> the<00:03:01.920> Pistons<00:03:02.340> push<00:03:03.060> it<00:03:03.240> out

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
be honest the Pistons push it out

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.300 
be honest the Pistons push it out
although<00:03:03.810> Pistons<00:03:04.350> don't<00:03:04.590> push<00:03:04.890> it<00:03:04.920> out<00:03:05.100> all

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
although Pistons don't push it out all

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:06.890 
although Pistons don't push it out all
the<00:03:05.490> way<00:03:05.640> and<00:03:05.670> push<00:03:06.030> it<00:03:06.120> out<00:03:06.180> a<00:03:06.209> little<00:03:06.420> bit<00:03:06.600> so

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
the way and push it out a little bit so

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.650 
the way and push it out a little bit so
the<00:03:07.530> reset<00:03:07.920> button<00:03:07.950> which<00:03:08.910> is<00:03:09.030> here

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
the reset button which is here

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.870 
the reset button which is here
nice<00:03:10.620> place<00:03:10.800> a<00:03:10.830> clock<00:03:11.250> and<00:03:11.520> he<00:03:11.580> just<00:03:11.700> keeps

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
nice place a clock and he just keeps

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.490 
nice place a clock and he just keeps
pushing<00:03:12.150> at<00:03:12.420> it<00:03:12.570> and<00:03:12.660> so<00:03:12.720> it<00:03:12.840> does<00:03:12.990> fall<00:03:13.260> out

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
pushing at it and so it does fall out

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.790 
pushing at it and so it does fall out
there<00:03:14.400> we<00:03:14.459> go<00:03:14.580> oh<00:03:14.760> no<00:03:15.000> it<00:03:15.060> resets<00:03:15.420> it<00:03:15.680> so<00:03:16.680> that

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 
there we go oh no it resets it so that

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.680 
there we go oh no it resets it so that
is<00:03:16.860> basically<00:03:17.220> the<00:03:17.459> gist<00:03:17.730> of<00:03:17.910> it<00:03:18.030> when<00:03:18.600> the

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
is basically the gist of it when the

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.810 
is basically the gist of it when the
game<00:03:18.810> ends<00:03:19.260> again<00:03:19.620> a<00:03:19.650> predator

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 
game ends again a predator

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.970 
game ends again a predator
it'll<00:03:21.600> just<00:03:21.630> answer<00:03:22.350> these<00:03:22.560> pistons<00:03:22.920> and

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
it'll just answer these pistons and

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.410 
it'll just answer these pistons and
we'll<00:03:23.130> keep<00:03:23.310> pushing<00:03:23.489> it<00:03:23.730> until<00:03:23.820> it<00:03:24.030> does<00:03:24.180> fall

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
we'll keep pushing it until it does fall

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:25.940 
we'll keep pushing it until it does fall
out<00:03:24.630> and<00:03:24.780> then<00:03:24.870> this<00:03:25.050> detector<00:03:25.470> rail<00:03:25.650> will

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
out and then this detector rail will

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.460 
out and then this detector rail will
stop<00:03:26.220> them<00:03:26.400> from<00:03:26.430> pushing<00:03:26.810> so<00:03:27.810> that's<00:03:28.140> really

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
stop them from pushing so that's really

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.830 
stop them from pushing so that's really
all<00:03:29.430> the<00:03:29.610> vistas<00:03:29.910> show<00:03:30.090> to<00:03:30.330> be<00:03:30.420> honest<00:03:30.600> it's<00:03:30.750> a

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
all the vistas show to be honest it's a

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.870 
all the vistas show to be honest it's a
very<00:03:31.019> basic<00:03:31.200> design<00:03:31.680> I'll<00:03:32.160> go<00:03:32.310> through<00:03:32.519> a<00:03:32.580> bit

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
very basic design I'll go through a bit

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.000 
very basic design I'll go through a bit
of<00:03:32.910> the<00:03:33.090> redstone<00:03:33.450> there<00:03:33.480> but<00:03:33.810> all<00:03:34.350> it<00:03:34.530> does<00:03:34.680> is

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
of the redstone there but all it does is

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.160 
of the redstone there but all it does is
rather<00:03:35.340> than<00:03:35.519> it<00:03:35.640> like<00:03:36.510> turning<00:03:36.870> a<00:03:36.930> load<00:03:37.080> of

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
rather than it like turning a load of

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.910 
rather than it like turning a load of
corner<00:03:37.470> trucks

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
corner trucks

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.250 
corner trucks
it<00:03:38.610> just<00:03:38.820> takes<00:03:39.030> all<00:03:39.209> of<00:03:39.239> the<00:03:39.630> comb<00:03:40.080> the

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
it just takes all of the comb the

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.949 
it just takes all of the comb the
cobwebs<00:03:40.650> put<00:03:40.860> onto<00:03:41.040> one<00:03:41.400> pile<00:03:41.760> and<00:03:42.180> then<00:03:42.780> this

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
cobwebs put onto one pile and then this

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:44.479 
cobwebs put onto one pile and then this
also<00:03:43.230> means<00:03:43.500> we<00:03:43.620> don't<00:03:43.739> have<00:03:43.830> to<00:03:43.950> wait<00:03:44.220> 30

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
also means we don't have to wait 30

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:47.180 
also means we don't have to wait 30
seconds<00:03:45.170> to<00:03:46.170> reset<00:03:46.350> the<00:03:46.590> timer<00:03:46.739> we<00:03:46.950> can<00:03:47.070> just

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
seconds to reset the timer we can just

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.009 
seconds to reset the timer we can just
do<00:03:47.280> it<00:03:47.370> instantly<00:03:47.730> near<00:03:48.269> enough<00:03:48.510> anyway<00:03:48.870> a

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:49.019 
do it instantly near enough anyway a

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:52.039 
do it instantly near enough anyway a
couple<00:03:49.830> of<00:03:49.890> seconds<00:03:50.220> and<00:03:50.570> then<00:03:51.570> it<00:03:51.840> will<00:03:51.930> just

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:52.049 
couple of seconds and then it will just

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:54.080 
couple of seconds and then it will just
push<00:03:52.290> it<00:03:52.410> out<00:03:52.500> it<00:03:52.860> should<00:03:52.920> fall<00:03:53.220> next<00:03:53.519> there<00:03:54.030> we

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
push it out it should fall next there we

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.979 
push it out it should fall next there we
go<00:03:54.709> and<00:03:55.709> I<00:03:55.799> just<00:03:56.070> reset<00:03:56.519> the<00:03:56.640> timer<00:03:56.930> now<00:03:57.930> the

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:57.989 
go and I just reset the timer now the

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:00.350 
go and I just reset the timer now the
way<00:03:58.110> this<00:03:58.260> works<00:03:58.530> is<00:03:58.830> the<00:03:59.250> reset<00:03:59.700> is<00:03:59.910> it

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:00.360 
way this works is the reset is it

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:02.000 
way this works is the reset is it
presses<00:04:00.660> the<00:04:00.870> buttons<00:04:01.590> doesn't<00:04:01.769> have<00:04:01.860> to<00:04:01.950> be

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
presses the buttons doesn't have to be

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:03.289 
presses the buttons doesn't have to be
here<00:04:02.160> it<00:04:02.250> was<00:04:02.370> originally<00:04:02.760> there<00:04:02.880> just<00:04:03.150> full

00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:03.299 
here it was originally there just full

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:04.100 
here it was originally there just full
box<00:04:03.510> I'll<00:04:03.690> put<00:04:03.810> it<00:04:03.900> here

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.110 
box I'll put it here

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:05.720 
box I'll put it here
so<00:04:04.440> what<00:04:04.560> about<00:04:04.620> does<00:04:04.890> it<00:04:05.070> doesn't<00:04:05.340> hit<00:04:05.700> the

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
so what about does it doesn't hit the

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:08.390 
so what about does it doesn't hit the
track<00:04:06.120> at<00:04:06.269> all<00:04:06.450> it<00:04:07.140> powers<00:04:07.440> this<00:04:07.620> block<00:04:07.950> here

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
track at all it powers this block here

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.789 
track at all it powers this block here
which<00:04:08.940> powers<00:04:09.180> this<00:04:09.330> redstone<00:04:09.690> this<00:04:10.590> goes

00:04:10.789 --> 00:04:10.799 
which powers this redstone this goes

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:13.670 
which powers this redstone this goes
into<00:04:11.010> an<00:04:11.100> RS<00:04:11.430> nor<00:04:11.670> latch<00:04:11.730> so<00:04:12.570> it<00:04:12.900> saves<00:04:13.350> this

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
into an RS nor latch so it saves this

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.070 
into an RS nor latch so it saves this
state<00:04:14.010> this<00:04:14.250> side<00:04:14.549> turns<00:04:14.910> on<00:04:15.209> the<00:04:15.720> side<00:04:15.930> turned

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:16.080 
state this side turns on the side turned

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:18.080 
state this side turns on the side turned
off<00:04:16.410> and<00:04:16.620> it<00:04:16.739> stays<00:04:16.950> like<00:04:17.100> that<00:04:17.280> since<00:04:17.910> this

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
off and it stays like that since this

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.719 
off and it stays like that since this
had<00:04:18.239> turned<00:04:18.419> off<00:04:18.769> this<00:04:19.769> turns<00:04:20.340> off<00:04:20.459> as<00:04:20.609> well

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:20.729 
had turned off this turns off as well

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:22.820 
had turned off this turns off as well
because<00:04:20.940> let's<00:04:21.060> this<00:04:21.209> torch<00:04:21.570> turn<00:04:21.930> on<00:04:22.140> this<00:04:22.710> is

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
because let's this torch turn on this is

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:24.800 
because let's this torch turn on this is
a<00:04:22.860> clock<00:04:23.340> of<00:04:23.940> course<00:04:24.000> that<00:04:24.360> goes<00:04:24.450> to<00:04:24.599> all<00:04:24.660> the

Pistons it's just that's a clock
the<00:04:26.919> pistons<00:04:27.370> will<00:04:27.490> keep<00:04:27.639> them<00:04:27.789> in<00:04:27.939> out<00:04:28.120> in<00:04:28.150> out

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:28.419 
the pistons will keep them in out in out

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:31.020 
the pistons will keep them in out in out

of this side of the arse knowledge back
on<00:04:35.969> resetting<00:04:36.969> it<00:04:37.120> and<00:04:37.240> stopping<00:04:37.449> that<00:04:37.659> from

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:37.810 
on resetting it and stopping that from

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:40.920 
on resetting it and stopping that from
ticking<00:04:38.400> and<00:04:39.400> that's<00:04:39.639> it's<00:04:40.300> a<00:04:40.389> really<00:04:40.659> simple

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:40.930 
ticking and that's it's a really simple

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:42.779 
ticking and that's it's a really simple
design<00:04:41.050> it<00:04:41.469> doesn't<00:04:41.650> need<00:04:41.770> to<00:04:41.830> be<00:04:41.919> doing<00:04:42.189> 1.5

00:04:42.779 --> 00:04:42.789 
design it doesn't need to be doing 1.5

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:45.149 
design it doesn't need to be doing 1.5
it<00:04:43.030> could<00:04:43.150> be<00:04:43.240> doing<00:04:43.419> 1.4<00:04:43.960> but<00:04:44.740> I<00:04:44.770> just<00:04:44.979> like

00:04:45.149 --> 00:04:45.159 
it could be doing 1.4 but I just like

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:46.890 
it could be doing 1.4 but I just like
the<00:04:45.400> redstone<00:04:46.000> blocks<00:04:46.270> they're<00:04:46.509> just<00:04:46.659> the

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:46.900 
the redstone blocks they're just the

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:49.649 
the redstone blocks they're just the
brilliant<00:04:47.289> well<00:04:48.219> yeah<00:04:48.490> that's<00:04:48.759> going<00:04:49.389> to<00:04:49.539> be

00:04:49.649 --> 00:04:49.659 
brilliant well yeah that's going to be

00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:51.899 
brilliant well yeah that's going to be
in<00:04:49.780> the<00:04:49.870> proto<00:04:50.080> to<00:04:50.379> map<00:04:50.620> a<00:04:50.830> lot<00:04:51.759> of<00:04:51.819> these

00:04:51.899 --> 00:04:51.909 
in the proto to map a lot of these

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:53.459 
in the proto to map a lot of these
videos<00:04:52.090> actually<00:04:52.569> will<00:04:52.719> be<00:04:52.750> showing<00:04:53.110> some<00:04:53.439> of

00:04:53.459 --> 00:04:53.469 
videos actually will be showing some of

00:04:53.469 --> 00:04:55.619 
videos actually will be showing some of
the<00:04:53.620> new<00:04:53.770> things<00:04:54.039> in<00:04:54.340> the<00:04:54.610> pro<00:04:54.759> 2<00:04:55.150> redstone

00:04:55.619 --> 00:04:55.629 
the new things in the pro 2 redstone

00:04:55.629 --> 00:04:57.240 
the new things in the pro 2 redstone
because<00:04:56.259> I've<00:04:56.439> been<00:04:56.530> messing<00:04:56.830> around<00:04:56.860> with<00:04:57.069> it

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:57.250 
because I've been messing around with it

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:59.279 
because I've been messing around with it
1.5<00:04:57.729> stuff<00:04:58.000> and<00:04:58.180> you<00:04:58.240> can<00:04:58.360> do<00:04:58.449> so<00:04:58.659> much<00:04:58.810> with<00:04:58.870> it

00:04:59.279 --> 00:04:59.289 
1.5 stuff and you can do so much with it

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:01.890 
1.5 stuff and you can do so much with it
it's<00:04:59.979> great<00:05:00.250> but<00:05:00.939> I've<00:05:01.330> not<00:05:01.479> actually<00:05:01.719> seen

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:01.900 
it's great but I've not actually seen

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:03.360 
it's great but I've not actually seen
this<00:05:02.080> red<00:05:02.289> I'm<00:05:02.529> not<00:05:02.650> seeing<00:05:02.830> this<00:05:02.919> time<00:05:03.189> with

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:03.370 
this red I'm not seeing this time with

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:07.499 
this red I'm not seeing this time with
design<00:05:03.639> at<00:05:04.029> all<00:05:04.300> anywhere<00:05:06.090> even<00:05:07.090> like<00:05:07.300> the

00:05:07.499 --> 00:05:07.509 
design at all anywhere even like the

00:05:07.509 --> 00:05:08.969 
design at all anywhere even like the
settling<00:05:07.900> and<00:05:08.020> high<00:05:08.110> pixel<00:05:08.409> mouse<00:05:08.560> didn't<00:05:08.889> do

00:05:08.969 --> 00:05:08.979 
settling and high pixel mouse didn't do

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:10.740 
settling and high pixel mouse didn't do
it<00:05:09.099> like<00:05:09.219> this<00:05:09.400> it<00:05:09.580> did<00:05:09.699> it<00:05:09.819> he<00:05:10.300> did<00:05:10.479> it<00:05:10.539> with

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:10.750 
it like this it did it he did it with

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:12.570 
it like this it did it he did it with
separate<00:05:11.139> cobwebs<00:05:11.500> and<00:05:11.680> this<00:05:12.279> could<00:05:12.490> have

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:12.580 
separate cobwebs and this could have

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:14.369 
separate cobwebs and this could have
been<00:05:12.729> done<00:05:12.939> in<00:05:13.180> the<00:05:13.360> time<00:05:13.539> that<00:05:13.599> when<00:05:13.990> they<00:05:14.139> at

00:05:14.369 --> 00:05:14.379 
been done in the time that when they at

00:05:14.379 --> 00:05:16.469 
been done in the time that when they at
the<00:05:14.469> time<00:05:14.650> of<00:05:14.770> them<00:05:14.919> making<00:05:15.250> it<00:05:15.400> so<00:05:15.639> I<00:05:15.849> think

00:05:16.469 --> 00:05:16.479 
the time of them making it so I think

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:17.969 
the time of them making it so I think
they<00:05:16.539> may<00:05:16.659> have<00:05:16.750> overlooked<00:05:17.349> it<00:05:17.560> or<00:05:17.650> something

00:05:17.969 --> 00:05:17.979 
they may have overlooked it or something

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:19.740 
they may have overlooked it or something
like<00:05:18.009> that<00:05:18.099> but<00:05:18.460> it's<00:05:19.360> a<00:05:19.419> really<00:05:19.569> simple

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:19.750 
like that but it's a really simple

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:21.659 
like that but it's a really simple
design<00:05:19.990> a<00:05:20.349> lot<00:05:20.529> more<00:05:20.650> compact<00:05:21.009> and<00:05:21.310> a<00:05:21.520> lot<00:05:21.639> of

00:05:21.659 --> 00:05:21.669 
design a lot more compact and a lot of

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:22.920 
design a lot more compact and a lot of
better<00:05:21.909> since<00:05:22.210> you<00:05:22.270> can<00:05:22.389> stop<00:05:22.659> it<00:05:22.810> whenever

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:22.930 
better since you can stop it whenever

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:25.589 
better since you can stop it whenever
you<00:05:23.110> want<00:05:23.310> for<00:05:24.310> those<00:05:24.460> wondering<00:05:24.939> this<00:05:25.210> timer

00:05:25.589 --> 00:05:25.599 
you want for those wondering this timer

00:05:25.599 --> 00:05:28.830 
you want for those wondering this timer
here<00:05:25.930> is<00:05:26.259> based<00:05:26.740> off<00:05:27.009> high<00:05:27.639> pixels<00:05:28.120> the<00:05:28.599> walls

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:28.840 
here is based off high pixels the walls

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:31.529 
here is based off high pixels the walls
map<00:05:29.259> with<00:05:29.710> the<00:05:29.830> timer<00:05:30.210> except<00:05:31.210> the<00:05:31.300> rest<00:05:31.479> of

00:05:31.529 --> 00:05:31.539 
map with the timer except the rest of

00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:33.390 
map with the timer except the rest of
them<00:05:31.629> behind<00:05:31.750> it<00:05:32.080> is<00:05:32.199> basically<00:05:33.009> the<00:05:33.190> same<00:05:33.339> but

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:33.400 
them behind it is basically the same but

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:34.469 
them behind it is basically the same but
I've<00:05:33.639> remade<00:05:34.120> it

00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:34.479 
I've remade it

00:05:34.479 --> 00:05:35.879 
I've remade it
there's<00:05:34.930> no<00:05:35.050> it's<00:05:35.169> no<00:05:35.289> better<00:05:35.529> it's<00:05:35.830> not

00:05:35.879 --> 00:05:35.889 
there's no it's no better it's not

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:37.829 
there's no it's no better it's not
better<00:05:36.159> I've<00:05:36.520> just<00:05:36.789> remate<00:05:37.360> have<00:05:37.509> you<00:05:37.599> built

00:05:37.829 --> 00:05:37.839 
better I've just remate have you built

00:05:37.839 --> 00:05:40.589 
better I've just remate have you built
it<00:05:37.960> myself<00:05:38.699> all<00:05:39.699> it<00:05:39.879> does<00:05:40.060> is<00:05:40.240> it<00:05:40.389> lets<00:05:40.479> you

00:05:40.589 --> 00:05:40.599 
it myself all it does is it lets you

00:05:40.599 --> 00:05:42.269 
it myself all it does is it lets you
count<00:05:40.870> down<00:05:40.990> it's<00:05:41.259> a<00:05:41.319> really<00:05:41.529> compact<00:05:41.949> way<00:05:42.250> of

00:05:42.269 --> 00:05:42.279 
count down it's a really compact way of

00:05:42.279 --> 00:05:43.499 
count down it's a really compact way of
having<00:05:42.520> a<00:05:42.699> massive<00:05:42.969> timer

00:05:43.499 --> 00:05:43.509 
having a massive timer

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:46.350 
having a massive timer
this<00:05:44.139> is<00:05:44.259> 59<00:05:44.860> minutes<00:05:45.159> 59<00:05:45.460> seconds<00:05:46.029> and<00:05:46.180> if<00:05:46.270> I

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:46.360 
this is 59 minutes 59 seconds and if I

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:48.869 
this is 59 minutes 59 seconds and if I
set<00:05:46.629> this<00:05:46.750> going<00:05:47.580> there's<00:05:48.580> a<00:05:48.610> button

00:05:48.869 --> 00:05:48.879 
set this going there's a button

00:05:48.879 --> 00:05:54.510 
set this going there's a button
somewhere<00:05:51.569> so<00:05:52.569> I<00:05:52.779> go<00:05:53.050> in<00:05:53.199> a<00:05:53.379> lot<00:05:53.800> of<00:05:53.860> Pistons<00:05:54.250> go

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:54.520 
somewhere so I go in a lot of Pistons go

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:57.600 
somewhere so I go in a lot of Pistons go
in<00:05:55.740> okay<00:05:56.740> then<00:05:56.919> it's<00:05:57.159> stopped<00:05:57.370> for<00:05:57.520> some

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:57.610 
in okay then it's stopped for some

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:00.149 
in okay then it's stopped for some
reason

00:06:00.149 --> 00:06:00.159 

00:06:00.159 --> 00:06:04.320 

oh<00:06:01.589> oh<00:06:02.589> yeah<00:06:02.979> I<00:06:03.009> didn't<00:06:03.759> finish<00:06:04.000> that<00:06:04.029> I<00:06:04.180> just

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:04.330 
oh oh yeah I didn't finish that I just

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:09.119 
oh oh yeah I didn't finish that I just
dislike<00:06:06.449> so<00:06:07.449> start<00:06:07.719> counting<00:06:08.110> down<00:06:08.139> and<00:06:08.979> I'll

00:06:09.119 --> 00:06:09.129 
dislike so start counting down and I'll

00:06:09.129 --> 00:06:11.010 
dislike so start counting down and I'll
count<00:06:09.310> now<00:06:09.520> taking<00:06:09.849> power<00:06:10.029> to<00:06:10.270> count<00:06:10.479> now<00:06:10.659> so

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:11.020 
count now taking power to count now so

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:12.600 
count now taking power to count now so
you<00:06:11.080> know<00:06:11.259> it's<00:06:11.500> pretty<00:06:11.529> long<00:06:11.889> time<00:06:12.159> and

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:12.610 
you know it's pretty long time and

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:15.719 
you know it's pretty long time and
pretty<00:06:13.419> compact<00:06:13.870> for<00:06:14.349> an<00:06:14.439> hour<00:06:14.529> I<00:06:14.800> might<00:06:15.370> show

00:06:15.719 --> 00:06:15.729 
pretty compact for an hour I might show

00:06:15.729 --> 00:06:18.059 
pretty compact for an hour I might show
the<00:06:15.849> how<00:06:15.939> to<00:06:16.000> build<00:06:16.270> that<00:06:16.479> book<00:06:16.750> yeah<00:06:17.379> it's

00:06:18.059 --> 00:06:18.069 
the how to build that book yeah it's

00:06:18.069 --> 00:06:19.619 
the how to build that book yeah it's
it's<00:06:18.610> pretty<00:06:19.029> complicated<00:06:19.270> it's<00:06:19.599> not

00:06:19.619 --> 00:06:19.629 
it's pretty complicated it's not

00:06:19.629 --> 00:06:22.079 
it's pretty complicated it's not
complicated<00:06:20.199> it's<00:06:20.409> just<00:06:20.560> condensed<00:06:21.129> but<00:06:22.000> yeah

00:06:22.079 --> 00:06:22.089 
complicated it's just condensed but yeah

00:06:22.089 --> 00:06:23.999 
complicated it's just condensed but yeah
that<00:06:22.689> was<00:06:22.779> the<00:06:22.900> point<00:06:23.050> of<00:06:23.139> this<00:06:23.319> video<00:06:23.650> the<00:06:23.830> six
