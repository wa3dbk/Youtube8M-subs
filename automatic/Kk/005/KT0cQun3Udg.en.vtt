getting ready to dye your hair if you do

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.270 
getting ready to dye your hair if you do
it<00:00:51.120> how<00:00:51.239> I<00:00:51.270> did<00:00:51.719> where<00:00:51.989> it's<00:00:52.170> not<00:00:52.350> just<00:00:52.710> a<00:00:52.860> solid

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
it how I did where it's not just a solid

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.549 
it how I did where it's not just a solid
like<00:00:53.489> chunk<00:00:54.420> sectioned<00:00:54.930> off<00:00:55.079> and<00:00:55.469> then

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
like chunk sectioned off and then

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.340 
like chunk sectioned off and then
colored<00:00:55.980> like<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.280> whole<00:00:56.460> thing<00:00:56.789> it<00:00:57.270> makes<00:00:58.170> it

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
colored like the whole thing it makes it

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.959 
colored like the whole thing it makes it
a<00:00:58.410> bit<00:00:58.590> more<00:00:58.739> difficult<00:00:59.010> when<00:00:59.430> it<00:00:59.579> comes<00:00:59.760> time

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
a bit more difficult when it comes time

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.479 
a bit more difficult when it comes time
to<00:01:00.000> retouch<00:01:00.680> because<00:01:01.680> I<00:01:01.710> did<00:01:02.010> almost<00:01:02.219> like

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
to retouch because I did almost like

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.490 
to retouch because I did almost like
in-between<00:01:02.730> it<00:01:03.090> was<00:01:03.239> like<00:01:03.480> natural<00:01:04.320> hair

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
in-between it was like natural hair

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.580 
in-between it was like natural hair
color<00:01:04.890> natural<00:01:05.549> hair<00:01:05.880> color<00:01:06.260> so<00:01:07.260> that's<00:01:07.439> why

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
color natural hair color so that's why

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.160 
color natural hair color so that's why
you<00:01:07.619> see<00:01:07.830> I'd<00:01:07.920> like<00:01:08.100> these<00:01:08.280> little<00:01:09.170> braided

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
you see I'd like these little braided

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.460 
you see I'd like these little braided
and<00:01:10.320> twisted<00:01:10.710> random<00:01:11.189> bits<00:01:11.520> throughout<00:01:12.470> so

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
and twisted random bits throughout so

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.490 
and twisted random bits throughout so
that<00:01:13.619> I<00:01:13.650> don't<00:01:13.799> get<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.760> color<00:01:14.970> there<00:01:15.409> so<00:01:16.409> it

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
that I don't get the color there so it

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.740 
that I don't get the color there so it
just<00:01:16.530> makes<00:01:16.799> it<00:01:17.070> like<00:01:17.520> just<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.270> sectioning

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
just makes it like just the sectioning

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.880 
just makes it like just the sectioning
off<00:01:18.869> is<00:01:19.200> a<00:01:19.229> bit<00:01:19.470> difficult<00:01:19.650> and<00:01:20.040> it's<00:01:20.159> annoying

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890 
off is a bit difficult and it's annoying

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:28.010 
off is a bit difficult and it's annoying
so<00:01:23.659> I'm<00:01:24.659> going<00:01:25.380> to<00:01:25.439> start<00:01:25.560> with<00:01:26.630> 1<00:01:27.630> section

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020
