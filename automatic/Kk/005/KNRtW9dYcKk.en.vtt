00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:11.120
 hello girls here you have me again this 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:15.030
 time is to bring you a little tutorial 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:17.670
 to know how to sterilize our 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.560
 pending does not matter the type of 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:24.120
 earrings that are can be gold 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:27.540
 silver or if he had radio lead alpaca or 

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:30.520
 in copper whatever because many times 

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:32.439
 it hurts us 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:35.470
 We can not use this type of earrings 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:37.240
 always tells us to and is that I do not 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:39.580
 I put jewelry I only have to 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:42.070
 use good gold because all the earrings 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:44.460
 that you have of another type that is not gold 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:47.150
 that does not hurt you that harms you 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.070
 can you do this trick 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.780
 and good and there are people too who is very 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.540
 sensitive and even up to customers 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.430
 of gold 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:56.800
 and they do not know how to do then I do not know 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:59.230
 they put up nothing is a trick come 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:01.240
 it works perfectly and in fact 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:03.220
 I no longer have injuries and to use everything 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:05.950
 kind of earrings because I've been very 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:07.340
 energetic to the subject of the pending 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:11.030
 imitation jewelry 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:13.600
 and well and so I get to put all the 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:16.659
 you can do it to your 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:20.310
 the first step is going to be soaking with a 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:20.310
 70 degree alcohol if you have 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.619
 and everyone 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.619
 the cotton disk 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:32.850
 once soaked 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:32.850
 I take the part where it will go 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:46.159
 and clean it and immediately we take the 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:49.049
 lighter we let it dry 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:51.390
 with the help of a clothespin I'm going to 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.490
 hold my slope of this that is 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.810
 small 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.880
 A) Yes 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.530
 and thus avoided not burn me but with much 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.259
 be careful because they can also be turned on 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:04.610
 fire the plastic then once 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.610
 wet and soaked 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:13.240
 and so directly because I do not hurt myself 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.460
 because doing this before I burned myself 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:18.520
 the finger caught fire must have 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:20.700
 very much care and put the clamp the 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:24.450
 Life of the clamp is very good 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:30.590
 and if it's metal better because you already know 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:30.590
 what and what it costs more than to catch fire 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:40.620
 well I hope you have forgotten 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:45.200
 ok well a little kiss you do not see me this 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:45.200
 goodbye my goodbye
