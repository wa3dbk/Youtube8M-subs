00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 hardcore team deathmatch hey people here 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.029
 is the kelvin and I still believe 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.790
 I do not know I am actually one 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.620
 photographer image processor trainer for 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.290
 digital image processing and photography 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.549
 yes and by the way I moved about everyone 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.719
 evening one to two hours 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.090
 and I just thought 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.580
 beaten quietly sometimes a 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.189
 little to say how play for 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.180
 all those who are so good 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:24.689
 want to be no I am at all 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.269
 not good 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.609
 at the gameplay now you see it already 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:32.399
 I unpacked the sniper there 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.290
 ever over and the gameplay like that 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.860
 a mix between snipers and 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.450
 to wash 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.040
 I know that many now 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.829
 probably right at the beginning 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:44.879
 come and say hey you fight yes you 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:48.120
 are you just in the corner around so the 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.649
 I quickly leave the professionals I am 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.809
 just have fun with a player 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.239
 It must be short no matter if at the end then said 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:57.180
 will you fight or not me? 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.920
 have games as well as sports and maybe 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.079
 I just play too realistic 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.059
 I myself was at the military for ten years 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.619
 and he will not rush why 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:09.270
 but shit 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:11.400
 I play exactly with this game play 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.710
 on the map overflow and i think so 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.630
 in the end somehow in 21 2 or 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.869
 something I just wanted 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:22.799
 bit sneak armor and have two 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:25.530
 claims more the rear lanes free 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:28.360
 to keep if I want quasi sniper 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.650
 that it has a bit of a rest 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.450
 There were already two fighters 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:35.690
 over the corpse seems to have is 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:38.120
 intended to play like general 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:41.510
 I'm sure I'm playing quietly 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:44.140
 and absolutely the most fun most of the time 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:48.170
 we play with colleagues in the evening 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.460
 and meet us there always around 20 22 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.810
 Clock 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.280
 I will describe in this video 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.410
 sometimes another channel 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:58.010
 link probably more gameplay 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:02:00.890
 generally sees the game here at the game 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:03.229
 sniper i kinda like this svo 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:08.240
 that means you see I do not remember 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:11.480
 just like the guns are called a drone 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:14.300
 I always have it mostly almost always 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.550
 first look at team deathmatch 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.380
 my players where then the enemies are 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:20.300
 and secondly , I'll get it for then 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:22.670
 every other kill my fellow players 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.050
 make another ten points which 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.580
 actually so ne bad you 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.160
 threatened then I believe 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:33.019
 I still like points series lightning 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:34.760
 and reserves the preface in general because 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:36.200
 always a surprise could be in it 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.120
 you will see later too 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.980
 I have this gameplay at the 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.320
 The previous speaker had a bit of luck there 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.060
 already comes the preface now must have 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:47.260
 still 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:48.730
 find space where you can deliver me 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.750
 I thought then that here 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.120
 still a bit further to the 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:57.870
 is brought away and then brings her 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:03:00.120
 demolish the preface of lightning 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:02.110
 I think I will never 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.849
 taken away at the same time I know 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:05.620
 not what probably taken again 

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:07.950
 in the opposite window where again two 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.950
 to hope 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:15.489
 okay I'm not the way, by the way 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:16.060
 no profi comments gameplay tip 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:17.560
 become 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.890
 I just do it this way 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:24.220
 for fun because just a clear the 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:25.930
 consists of 15 to 20 people that they 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.010
 that also masses into the gameplay and that 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.260
 are also some which still hold 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:30.849
 can not have as good as we say 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.680
 are some in our home life 

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:36.819
 player holding out of photography 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:37.690
 bildbearbeitung and that's what you're watching 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:39.220
 look at it now 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:41.850
 I want to get the benefits and then 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:43.830
 he just bangs me off 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:46.080
 he has the second one too 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:48.690
 That's why it's off the lobby 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:50.760
 flown out so I think that 's possible 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:54.410
 hardcore not at hardcore mode 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:56.670
 means enemy bullets and 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:59.070
 own bombardment on your own 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:00.060
 pops the eyes then beats 

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:03.300
 then out sometime 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:04.530
 now I have brought my agr have front 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:07.380
 and at the back nobody deserves that 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:10.070
 can come and then tax the doctor 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:10.070
 almost yourself 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:17.310
 Of course that's a lot of fun 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:17.310
 give people device as it has 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:22.879
 By the way, the graphics also because he is on 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:24.289
 elenas anja battlefield around black ops 

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:25.460
 you play rather than I find 

00:04:24.289 --> 00:04:27.080
 battlefield also collapse already 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:29.509
 gambled but if you stop once 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:32.050
 got used to the whole here with the 

00:04:29.509 --> 00:04:33.919
 shooting series and how it all works 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:36.250
 then it is incredibly difficult 

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:38.539
 to change battlefield or vice versa 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:39.650
 That's why I stay here with black 

00:04:38.539 --> 00:04:43.219
 I am already looking forward to that 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:46.039
 new call of duty frost I'm real times 

00:04:43.219 --> 00:04:47.900
 curious how it will be if they 

00:04:46.039 --> 00:04:48.710
 on the playstation 4 whether the graphics 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:51.250
 will be better 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:53.780
 You can even your opinion and 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:55.280
 the note write if you are too 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:57.469
 then get the new playstation 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:59.629
 you can also love the animals 

00:04:57.469 --> 00:05:01.940
 gamer names founders write if you 

00:04:59.629 --> 00:05:03.560
 I have a say as I currently play 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:05.120
 actually only black ops nothing else 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:05.750
 Another thing every evening one to two 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:09.289
 hours 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:10.789
 if he wanted to save me you see her 

00:05:09.289 --> 00:05:12.680
 my sugar names can be my pleasure 

00:05:10.789 --> 00:05:15.080
 save writes but at the 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:18.169
 Friendship request or at the 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:20.389
 player questioned somehow youtube because 

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:23.050
 Otherwise , not because I always 

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:25.449
 must know where the people come from 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:27.159
 and that can also like to show how 

00:05:25.449 --> 00:05:30.669
 you do not know and how to correctly 

00:05:27.159 --> 00:05:31.690
 so my delicacies ticks while 2 the 

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:33.099
 but it is only there that I am 

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:35.650
 play quietly when I play fast 

00:05:33.099 --> 00:05:36.280
 i am just too bad i just have 

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:38.229
 no chance 

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:39.789
 and that's why I recommend it to everyone 

00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:42.190
 they do not see new ones with the game yet 

00:05:39.789 --> 00:05:44.440
 camp is so good on it 

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:46.330
 the excuse is always the same no matter 

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:49.270
 whether you want it or not so soon 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:50.949
 wins it says you're a camper of 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:53.409
 he does not care so much if the 

00:05:50.949 --> 00:05:56.800
 scold people then give the least 

00:05:53.409 --> 00:05:58.150
 reason and camp then right 

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:01.389
 By the way, I like what I find here 

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:03.129
 the neighbors of the neighbors fight 

00:06:01.389 --> 00:06:05.349
 me differently because I have an outline 

00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:06.759
 it is now in the corner trophy 

00:06:05.349 --> 00:06:09.629
 I will not get rid of that system 

00:06:06.759 --> 00:06:11.620
 can then when the opponent to the white heat 

00:06:09.629 --> 00:06:13.569
 driven and I do not want to know how 

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:16.509
 Many people already have their controllers 

00:06:13.569 --> 00:06:17.770
 who have thrown away but then have to 

00:06:16.509 --> 00:06:19.840
 man beach villas I mean that 's that 

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:21.639
 she also wears games on the people 

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:23.949
 fight if I do not like someone who 

00:06:21.639 --> 00:06:25.750
 Corner sit but can not be 

00:06:23.949 --> 00:06:27.639
 avoid is always so it stays 

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:29.560
 because what would be really cool what 

00:06:27.639 --> 00:06:32.349
 By the way, would also be welcome 

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:34.360
 play mode so anti camp or one 

00:06:32.349 --> 00:06:38.169
 play mode the rapidly highscores made 

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:40.740
 he left the klaus before in rabbits 

00:06:38.169 --> 00:06:40.740
 puts 

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:50.090
 zack will of which he already antique amber 

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:52.430
 Mode is called quickly if you 

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:52.850
 for more than two seconds remains dies 

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:56.620
 you 

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:56.620
 or is the energy broken or up 

00:06:56.980 --> 00:07:00.950
 the inventories is also liked but 

00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:05.390
 I believe it daily over the 

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:07.280
 grapes at 22 3 still two kills his 

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:11.060
 finished 

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:14.540
 and two hurt throat okay, too 

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:17.380
 just once drauflos and babble not 

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:19.669
 There are better and special gameplay 

00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:22.850
 now you are welcome to comment 

00:07:19.669 --> 00:07:25.010
 under the video in general to the game or 

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:27.550
 to whatever in that sense until 

00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:27.550
 next time
