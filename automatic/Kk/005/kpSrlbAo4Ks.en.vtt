dragon from the clan castle cost him a
few<00:04:07.500> units<00:04:07.889> now<00:04:08.099> but<00:04:08.340> much<00:04:08.519> better<00:04:08.730> than

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
few units now but much better than

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.330 
few units now but much better than

having a large pack of them roasted by
that<00:04:11.519> dragon's<00:04:12.030> breath<00:04:12.180> later<00:04:12.569> so<00:04:13.199> the<00:04:13.349> dragon

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
that dragon's breath later so the dragon

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.409 
that dragon's breath later so the dragon
eventually<00:04:14.129> goes<00:04:14.310> down<00:04:14.579> and<00:04:14.760> now<00:04:14.849> the<00:04:14.879> rest<00:04:15.239> of

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820 
notice that dino has brought wall

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
we saw I always like to bring a few just

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:26.390 
we saw I always like to bring a few just
in<00:04:25.380> case<00:04:25.560> of<00:04:25.740> the<00:04:25.800> situation

00:04:39.439 --> 00:04:39.449 
they will get it open but we've still

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:41.659 
they will get it open but we've still

they come the wizard tower goes down
that's<00:04:48.479> going<00:04:48.810> to<00:04:48.870> make<00:04:48.960> things<00:04:49.020> a<00:04:49.289> little<00:04:49.410> bit
