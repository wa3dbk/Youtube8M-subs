00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:09.280
 Yes, let's go. The probability of choosing a committee. What kind of problem is this? 

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:14.200
 When choosing 3 committees out of 32 girls for 8 boys 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:16.670
 Now what about the probability when choosing as follows eg 1 girl is chosen by 2 people 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:23.780
 Probability, such as the Toka Nanboya 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:29.030
 3 people pick you burns a course like that of choosing a particular boys of a Mr. b-kun also whenever the 

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:30.560
 Kind of probability that such such a choice Yeah yeah combination is always chosen say that what happens 

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:35.240
 It is how to ask for 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:37.550
 And as I 've always done, I 've said it over and over, and the probability is that when it comes to everything 

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:42.410
 I asked how I hope in this one all 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:43.770
 I Toka bag is taken out of the ball I'm there is a lot of pattern ASDF Higuto from the ball in such a 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:44.370
 If there are many such things 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:50.910
 We 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:51.540
 The probability to choose this committee also thinks the probability of taking out the ball from the pre-song 9 o'clock or the bag at all 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.640
 is 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:58.469
 When you take r out of this of a after all, ncr is this thought mination 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:02.309
 Was it I was good I use care 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:04.360
 It is reason transience people that say it anymore because you have come all the way also the Tteyuu 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:08.680
 Well I did that two bags 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:10.770
 Please review the video of the probability of pulling out the head and pulling the lottery once again 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:15.539
 Here too it was based 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:19.320
 Three people from among the women three people to put out 8 not take a look will you Son's doing on the assumption that 

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:25.960
 It is a probability that two boys and one girl are chosen when choosing 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:29.049
 And when it comes to the street as before, the probability is to calculate the frontal volume first from the house, and the previous pass is 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:35.560
 It is eventually Thani love from among the 11 people 

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:38.670
 11 men choose 3 out of a total of 11 women's doctors for men 8 but with 3 211 c 3 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:43.740
 It's seen me 165 ways 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.340
 It was the best store how to think about this that two boys and one girl were chosen among them 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:49.439
 is not it 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:51.460
 This is a thing like taking out the winning ticket from whether I hit lottery box retrieve the ball from the bag 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:55.119
 Together after all 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:59.140
 Two men are chosen from eight people 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:02:04.659
 If you choose 8 to 2 people, you think in that way to 8 c. 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:07.899
 Because choose one person from among the three women in everyone's Tteyuu choose one person Women's struck out 1 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:11.920
 So against that そ のstrike against that 1 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:17.410
 Why do you know 84 as calculated by multiplication and that 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:19.430
 So there are 28/55 lopes who took 100 minutes in 84/165. 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:21.210
 It is a flow of 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:27.360
 ok 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:31.260
 Next 34 choices , but if you make sure you choose a a b b, this is already pretty easy 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:36.120
 You're because it Tteyuu a Mr. b-kun also absolutely love eventually remaining What 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.750
 I just choose the one remaining from say and say do you say I choose another two people with equal magnification 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:41.230
 Right 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:45.730
 The remaining What because So if say from what was chosen to a Mr. b-kun 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:51.069
 According to a total of 11 a, a, b b, the rest is 9 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:54.220
 In 1069/15 by qc Ikenomiya street thinking I should I choose one person from the remaining nine 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:57.790
 You should do it like 3/55 like this 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:03:02.560
 We studied about the probability of choosing the good here in the fact that buy 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:06.820
 But how to determine the probability It is together all the time when it becomes like the section of the street I am used to quite various patterns 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:11.550
 I just say it let's it this time I myself after was the probability of choosing a good no 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:11.550
 Let's practice firm to find eons to be able to Tips
