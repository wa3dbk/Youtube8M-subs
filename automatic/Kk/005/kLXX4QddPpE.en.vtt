00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.020
 in fact, this is a black one 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.019

 shape that can be a normal or 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.189
 May

 second and the dreamworld skill then 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.570
 the ability we say hidden that does 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.610
 quite comfortable 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.549
 in fact now we select it then 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.140
 we put Italian as a language and 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:46.740
 see you are responds to the first e 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:50.729
 to make it become a new then the 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:52.470
 pokémon you see from the place that will be born 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.450
 kind of ario look we can now do them 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.420
 poker effect osf wisely from the poor 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.780
 whichever we want now 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:04.290
 we put as a country we put Italy 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:05.770
 here we put Lazio because the good god 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:10.030
 lives in Lazio 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:11.530
 and as the 3ds theme we put europe ok if 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.080
 let's move to the place where we have 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.280
 met this pokémon you see there are 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.550
 various games 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:20.920
 we will put y this is the location 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:24.160
 where we met in this case 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:26.950
 I put in neven site 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.000
 then an event we go later 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.090
 to choose the poké ball 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.650
 say that they are all there 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.799
 we will put it to the ball because we 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:36.549
 we love luca rione di reclamiamo though 

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:38.140
 wellness we choose the level to which it 

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:40.090
 we met and later the 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:45.269
 date when we met I 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:48.400
 I'll put the 3rd of this month in February 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:50.140
 let's move on to the statistics you can 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.510
 see we have the ips column e 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:58.510
 of games 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:03:01.660
 now let's put everything to 31 here it is 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:03.849
 while the and of the run domiziano sees 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:09.099
 have been chosen purely 

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:13.239
 random and you can repeat more times what 

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:16.510
 important the sum of the pd must 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:18.400
 always being 510 goals we hear 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:20.769
 change the screen will become process 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:23.590
 so the pokémon cannot be either 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:25.269
 exchanged used online then 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:27.639
 we are going to put back the two for which the 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:30.790
 510 result would obviously have life 

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:32.920
 also the type of power depending on the i 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.329
 big that then will not have this tool 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.430
 we find the statistics for the races of 

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:38.170
 beauty and let's move on to the attacks here 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.090
 you can put whatever you want 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:44.620
 in practice and now we put in hydrho 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:48.730
 pump we put a thunder it seems to me is it is 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:51.639
 a lick the hang shows an ambiguous e 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:53.319
 a trucks attraction later 

00:03:51.639 --> 00:03:55.959
 here you can see ok the use of 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:59.139
 pp that automatically changes the 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:04:02.970
 note the number of the pp of the moves you see 

00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:05.889
 we are 20 ok let's move to the last card 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:08.859
 then here we will have shores of ours 

00:04:05.889 --> 00:04:14.090
 pokémon we put we put not by chance 

00:04:08.859 --> 00:04:17.090
 we are 3 4 1 1 and also here 2 4 5 11 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:19.220
 perfect then an important thing if 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:21.859
 go and change the shores of the pokémon mi 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:23.600
 it will lose its being shiny even if there 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:25.970
 there is still the icon so we return to 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:29.199
 press the plug and as you can see is 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:32.110
 also returned here on this screen 

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:34.400
 now let's move on to our id in play 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:36.860
 we can go out while you're male 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.630
 female instead we put male and rich 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:40.130
 to be me indeed we make a beautiful 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:43.310
 female or not better than not let's make a 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:45.380
 nice male ok now let's move on 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:48.979
 the push to bring us back to our places 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:50.990
 sib to 31 and here instead we want to put 

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:51.470
 all kinds of medals those who 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:53.330
 want 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:55.639
 I'm putting a pair at random but 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:57.110
 obviously you can put those that 

00:04:55.639 --> 00:04:59.300
 clean other medals here too 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:02.450
 then remember medals press sable 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:02.990
 which friendship itself is not 

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:05.750
 important 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:08.289
 important and perfect press now that 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:11.240
 we have our pokémon we save it 

00:05:08.289 --> 00:05:13.490
 here is how you can see there are 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:15.830
 still the old edicts we have 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:19.570
 distributed a few days ago and we save 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:21.530
 our file as lou cario we save 

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:24.530
 perfect now we can also remove 

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:26.510
 the middle of the program and let's go 

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:30.530
 to open another page that I will put to you 

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:32.479
 always in description here it is e 

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:33.700
 so now let's go and get the 

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:36.860
 our file 

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:41.870
 here it is local or pk 6 and lo 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:43.580
 let's drag the screen inside 

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:47.000
 and here is your qr code was 

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:49.430
 generated perfect guys then this 

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.289
 is the guide in short I recommend us 

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:53.840
 we hope you use them 

00:05:51.289 --> 00:05:55.190
 appropriate and does not create a network 

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:59.150
 de lucaio for example with heathrow 

00:05:55.190 --> 00:06:03.050
 pump or otherwise abused them of this 

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:05.389
 let's call it this bug even if not 

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:07.190
 it's a bug and nothing 

00:06:05.389 --> 00:06:10.370
 let us know if you also want a guide 

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:13.430
 on how to frame the qr codes 

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:15.080
 from here it's all I recommend not used 

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:17.090
 pokemon online because there is always one 

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:18.139
 small possibility that is banned 

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:20.749
 although not 

00:06:18.139 --> 00:06:21.680
 it is not said it is not insured us 

00:06:20.749 --> 00:06:24.620
 however we do not assume any 

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:27.639
 responsibility therefore I lead the whole 

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:27.639
 and the next
