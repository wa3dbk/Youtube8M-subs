00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
come I think it's reverse I may have

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.720 
come I think it's reverse I may have
overs<00:03:46.230> but<00:03:46.680> when<00:03:46.799> the<00:03:46.889> dark<00:03:47.099> fables<00:03:47.459> come<00:03:47.609> out

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
overs but when the dark fables come out

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:49.159 
overs but when the dark fables come out
those<00:03:47.910> will<00:03:48.030> be<00:03:48.060> much<00:03:48.419> much<00:03:48.599> better<00:03:48.810> and<00:03:49.049> the
