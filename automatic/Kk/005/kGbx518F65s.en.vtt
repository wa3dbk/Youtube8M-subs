six months behind them obviously you've

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.510 
six months behind them obviously you've
had<00:00:45.539> perhaps<00:00:46.440> what<00:00:46.620> people<00:00:46.860> can<00:00:46.980> do<00:00:47.129> because

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
had perhaps what people can do because

the<00:00:47.610> games<00:00:47.789> as<00:00:48.660> you<00:00:48.809> say<00:00:48.960> some<00:00:49.260> would<00:00:49.500> consider

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
the games as you say some would consider

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:50.990 
the games as you say some would consider
that<00:00:49.920> but<00:00:50.190> I<00:00:50.219> think<00:00:50.309> every<00:00:50.610> game<00:00:50.789> in<00:00:50.940> the

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
that but I think every game in the

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.319 
that but I think every game in the
Premiership<00:00:51.449> is<00:00:51.570> tough<00:00:52.190> we<00:00:53.190> found<00:00:54.000> that<00:00:54.120> blue

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
Premiership is tough we found that blue

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.799 
Premiership is tough we found that blue
this<00:00:55.079> year<00:00:55.320> with<00:00:55.559> it<00:00:56.309> so<00:00:56.640> Quinn's<00:00:57.210> we<00:00:57.449> won<00:00:57.629> by

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
this year with it so Quinn's we won by

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.049 
this year with it so Quinn's we won by
there<00:00:58.260> was<00:00:58.350> a<00:00:58.379> score<00:00:58.680> in<00:00:58.859> it<00:00:58.980> Gloucester<00:00:59.910> there

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
there was a score in it Gloucester there

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.639 
there was a score in it Gloucester there
was<00:01:00.149> a<00:01:00.180> score<00:01:00.480> in<00:01:00.629> it<00:01:00.780> will<00:01:01.170> go<00:01:01.320> away<00:01:01.440> at

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
was a score in it will go away at

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.529 
was a score in it will go away at
Leicester<00:01:02.070> and<00:01:02.100> it's<00:01:02.460> a<00:01:02.550> draw<00:01:02.760> sit<00:01:03.059> but<00:01:03.210> every

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
Leicester and it's a draw sit but every

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.539 
Leicester and it's a draw sit but every
match<00:01:03.690> is<00:01:03.870> tough<00:01:04.080> and<00:01:04.290> regardless<00:01:05.070> of<00:01:05.250> who<00:01:05.369> you
