so<00:01:15.830> if<00:01:15.979> you<00:01:16.369> begin<00:01:16.550> the<00:01:16.789> maneuver<00:01:17.450> upwind<00:01:17.780> is

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 
so if you begin the maneuver upwind is

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.960 
so if you begin the maneuver upwind is
I'm<00:01:18.140> going<00:01:18.320> to<00:01:18.410> do<00:01:18.530> in<00:01:18.680> this<00:01:18.770> video<00:01:18.979> you<00:01:19.610> start

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:19.970 
I'm going to do in this video you start

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.120 
I'm going to do in this video you start
with<00:01:20.119> the<00:01:20.210> shallowest<00:01:20.630> Bank<00:01:21.020> to<00:01:21.530> maintain<00:01:21.950> our

with the shallowest Bank to maintain our

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:23.950 
with the shallowest Bank to maintain our

when upwind at our shallowest Bank angle
pitch<00:01:31.610> attitude<00:01:31.880> must<00:01:32.420> be<00:01:32.570> raised<00:01:32.900> to

so<00:02:06.159> at<00:02:06.280> 5,500<00:02:07.149> feet<00:02:07.179> we're<00:02:07.420> going<00:02:07.570> to<00:02:07.630> head

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
so at 5,500 feet we're going to head

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.809 
so at 5,500 feet we're going to head
into<00:02:08.080> the<00:02:08.289> slight<00:02:08.739> west<00:02:09.009> wind<00:02:09.280> that<00:02:09.459> we<00:02:09.580> have

into<00:02:36.400> the<00:02:36.670> wind<00:02:36.850> we'll<00:02:37.060> add<00:02:37.210> a<00:02:37.240> little<00:02:37.480> power

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720
