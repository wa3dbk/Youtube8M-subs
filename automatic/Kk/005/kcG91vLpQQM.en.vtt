Raw<00:02:36.930> tonight<00:02:36.989> see<00:02:37.799> if<00:02:37.980> any<00:02:38.189> more<00:02:38.370> friction<00:02:38.669> is

00:02:38.869 --> 00:02:38.879 
Raw tonight see if any more friction is

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:41.989 
Raw tonight see if any more friction is

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:41.999 
caused but really the shield's job all

00:02:41.999 --> 00:02:44.270 
caused but really the shield's job all
nigh<00:02:42.209> was<00:02:42.450> nothing<00:02:42.870> I<00:02:43.049> mean<00:02:43.169> gave<00:02:43.680> it<00:02:43.859> a<00:02:43.980> little

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
nigh was nothing I mean gave it a little

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.459 
nigh was nothing I mean gave it a little
bit<00:02:44.489> of<00:02:44.549> a<00:02:44.579> push<00:02:44.849> towards<00:02:45.060> Dean<00:02:45.810> Ambrose<00:02:46.260> and

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:46.469 
bit of a push towards Dean Ambrose and

00:02:46.469 --> 00:02:49.039 
bit of a push towards Dean Ambrose and
then<00:02:46.919> it<00:02:47.159> didn't<00:02:47.400> make<00:02:47.519> Cain<00:02:47.760> look<00:02:48.000> that<00:02:48.719> week

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:49.049 
then it didn't make Cain look that week

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:51.349 
then it didn't make Cain look that week
so<00:02:49.379> it<00:02:49.500> is<00:02:49.590> expectedly<00:02:50.099> Akane<00:02:50.459> and<00:02:50.669> Dean

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:51.359 
so it is expectedly Akane and Dean

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:52.789 
so it is expectedly Akane and Dean
Ambrose<00:02:51.689> match<00:02:51.870> could<00:02:52.139> carry<00:02:52.409> on<00:02:52.560> for<00:02:52.709> another

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:52.799 
Ambrose match could carry on for another

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:54.800 
Ambrose match could carry on for another
pay-per-view<00:02:53.430> as<00:02:53.639> it<00:02:53.790> did<00:02:53.939> end<00:02:54.120> in<00:02:54.299> a<00:02:54.359> council

have a rematch but to be honest doesn't
really<00:03:06.359> interest<00:03:06.629> me<00:03:06.750> at<00:03:06.900> all<00:03:06.959> it<00:03:07.139> wasn't<00:03:07.290> a

00:03:07.399 --> 00:03:07.409 
really interest me at all it wasn't a

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:09.470 
really interest me at all it wasn't a
very<00:03:07.530> good<00:03:07.620> match<00:03:07.919> and<00:03:08.129> if<00:03:09.060> they<00:03:09.209> did<00:03:09.329> do<00:03:09.449> a

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
very good match and if they did do a

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.330 
very good match and if they did do a
rematch<00:03:09.840> I<00:03:10.019> think<00:03:10.230> they'd<00:03:10.560> have<00:03:10.680> to<00:03:10.859> build<00:03:11.219> a

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
rematch I think they'd have to build a

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.459 
rematch I think they'd have to build a
better<00:03:11.519> story<00:03:11.969> line<00:03:12.150> because<00:03:12.419> it<00:03:12.959> wasn't<00:03:13.319> it

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:13.469
