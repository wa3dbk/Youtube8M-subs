00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:08.010
 hello my name is jeanne the madness 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.990
 will do I give sewing classes that 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:13.070
 is called stung shot and I'll you 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.990
 explain how to put on a machine 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:17.760
 old and a modern here I go 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.600
 you explain the threading then the 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.910
 wire coil mingle here then 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.070
 go right now to the guide son that 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.689
 is called young snaps like that 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.029
 it's the old machine I'm going 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.099
 go down between the two 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.000
 disks and I go back so that goes down that 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:38.579
 luckily I'll hold the wire here 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.340
 to click and that it goes behind the 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.829
 little hook then I go back in the 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.579
 tensioner there is a small form that 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:51.719
 allows to place like that I go down 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:54.780
 still a guide who is below there and 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.489
 still a host this way so the 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.469
 son guide it's different according to the 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.920
 machines that's pretty typical as 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:04.049
 as magic here is the thread comes through 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.090
 two son guides and now I'm going 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:10.260
 thread in the needle is to chÃ¢ble 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.580
 to say the hole I go down the foot and there 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.170
 I have to take my right hand 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.460
 but if put on the side so that 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.750
 you see well here's back and forth 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:21.150
 like this 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:24.479
 I grab in the back I try not to 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:27.960
 do not see there for that movie 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:31.200
 falls right I lift the foot and 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.900
 I can go to the back and now 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.119
 I will put the bobbin the bobbin 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.189
 she puts herself in the place puts so 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.900
 ask over and must be 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.740
 unwind in the opposite direction 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.750
 Clockwise 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.570
 I have not sophie in the little form I 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:49.020
 pull a little bit to the left and I 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:51.119
 remain provisional like that I resume the 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:55.979
 son of the top I'm going to turn the steering wheel 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:02:00.049
 towards me the steering wheel towards me I lai 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:03.659
 supple the son of the top and we see 

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:07.979
 here we see it appear and pop 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:11.600
 I pull on the purple thread and retrieve the 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:14.810
 loop for everything goes underneath 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:16.460
 here is the machine is ready to operate 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.100
 this is a machine 

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:20.500
 modern electronics but there are some 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.520
 also who are not electronic 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.840
 threading is pretty much the same 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:27.050
 thing now on all machines 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:29.600
 so the son always gets here so we 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:32.000
 always starts from the reel by the 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:35.990
 son guide so here I went in 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.980
 below like that I go down next 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:40.190
 the little slit 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:42.950
 there is a little arrow that tells me to 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.630
 so back up the tension block it is at 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:48.140
 inside we do not see it but it 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:50.990
 exists there is the tensioner I 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:54.500
 pulled so that it goes well in the hole 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:56.240
 there in the notch I go down and I 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.400
 find a son guide there is one on 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:00.380
 seven on this machine 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:02.360
 here after to put on a little guillon 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:04.520
 slow net automatically 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:06.650
 but not all machines have I 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:08.600
 go down with the little one 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:13.070
 joystick behind the always cut the 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:14.480
 end to arrive more easily to 

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:18.500
 put it on when you want to do this 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:19.940
 way and I go back to pass 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.980
 below if I lower them all to 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:24.770
 the hour the foot is because it is 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:26.870
 I have more room to put on 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:28.910
 but if i leave it bc i can not 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:29.470
 pull the thread which I am obliged to 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:33.770
 ride up 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:35.120
 this is the top wire and now I 

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:37.670
 will take another color of thread for 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:40.550
 the underside so same thing as for the 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:43.690
 old machine is presented like that 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:47.510
 in the location the can 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:49.730
 I give up I predict that it will be 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:51.220
 in the opposite direction to 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:53.450
 Clockwise 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:55.300
 there is the small notch that is more 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:58.700
 visible only for the old machine 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:01.130
 with an arrow that indicates the meaning I 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:03.890
 pull a little bit I present like this 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:07.010
 here and then there is more than 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:07.820
 go get the son from below we go 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:11.270
 turn the wheel 

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:14.470
 always in that sense and I get back from 

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:14.470
 the bottom loop 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:19.200
 I shoot and we can go all 

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:23.430
 under the foot 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:25.980
 I put the little door like that 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:29.430
 the difference between the two machines 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:31.170
 it's really the tension block that's 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:34.710
 seen in ancient China who 

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:36.000
 is not on the modern machine on a 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:38.220
 new machine is that it's all 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.720
 is signposted so there is only to follow the 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:41.850
 arrows and you can not too much 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:42.990
 deceive it's still the system what 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:45.030
 I say it's the roller coaster 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:47.670
 you come down you go up and you 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:49.860
 go down now you have to know 

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:52.590
 how to net 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:54.180
 two different machines there are still 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:55.889
 other systems but I can not everything 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:58.699
 explain to you that these are the 

00:04:55.889 --> 00:04:58.699
 main
