00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.639 
know going down to the beach where I'm
from<00:00:44.430> in<00:00:44.610> Dorset<00:00:45.059> I'd<00:00:45.750> often<00:00:46.230> go<00:00:46.410> down<00:00:46.530> to<00:00:46.620> the

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
from in Dorset I'd often go down to the

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:47.840 
from in Dorset I'd often go down to the
beach<00:00:46.829> in<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.070> winter<00:00:47.340> and<00:00:47.370> it<00:00:47.550> would<00:00:47.640> be<00:00:47.670> like

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
beach in the winter and it would be like

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.510 
beach in the winter and it would be like
that<00:00:48.059> kind<00:00:48.300> of<00:00:48.390> escapism<00:00:48.899> so<00:00:49.739> for<00:00:49.980> me<00:00:50.070> like<00:00:50.280> the

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
that kind of escapism so for me like the

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.610 
that kind of escapism so for me like the
beat<00:00:50.730> is<00:00:50.820> like<00:00:50.940> a<00:00:50.969> metaphor<00:00:51.750> for<00:00:52.079> you<00:00:52.320> escape

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
beat is like a metaphor for you escape

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.590 
beat is like a metaphor for you escape
so<00:00:52.890> yeah<00:00:53.039> how<00:00:53.520> would<00:00:53.579> you<00:00:53.789> describe<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.420> style

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
so yeah how would you describe the style

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.290 
so yeah how would you describe the style
of<00:00:54.780> music<00:00:55.160> quite<00:00:56.160> emotional<00:00:56.640> and<00:00:56.850> a<00:00:57.030> lot<00:00:57.270> of

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
of music quite emotional and a lot of

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.970 
of music quite emotional and a lot of
it's<00:00:57.480> quite<00:00:57.629> dark<00:00:57.780> I<00:00:58.109> think<00:00:58.350> that's<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.800> kind

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.650 
it's quite dark I think that's the kind
of<00:00:59.010> music<00:00:59.100> I<00:00:59.340> love<00:00:59.550> i<00:00:59.760> really<00:00:59.910> love<00:01:00.149> music<00:01:00.510> that
