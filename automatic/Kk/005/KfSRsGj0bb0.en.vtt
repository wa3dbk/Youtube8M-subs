00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:15.780
 me 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.130
 2 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:37.899
 More than 19,000 people died and were lost 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.899
 One year from the Great East Japan Earthquake 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:46.960
 Mr. Kumagaya, who lives in Rikuzentakata, Iwate Prefecture , lost 12 out of his relatives although his family was safe 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:52.240
 Better was 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:55.110
 It was Yamagata where the big tsunami was different 

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:55.110
 me 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.340
 Buch 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:11.070
 Hmm 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:15.730
 I was in good condition 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:18.210
 Put in an ellipse and 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:20.210
 I saw my own house more 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:26.720
 Yes that crap 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:31.340
 Have surged the most in it from the pound to float Kurama 6 If seafood 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:35.420
 Don't say that the waves coming down are falling It 's awesome 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:39.850
 I mean the creation of a Well Dung Does Nde did different things 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.850
 It was not something like that 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:50.670
 Temporary housing is narrow and cold and people are forced to live inconvenient life 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:59.720
 Under such circumstances, the Japanese Red Cross Society donated so that a comfortable life could be delivered. 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.900
 Kaden is a 6-piece set 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:06.460
 This support came from the overseas Red Cross 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.460
 It is carried out with a relief fund 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:17.040
 Although debris in the affected areas had followed the ground has been removed 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:25.579
 The final destination of the debris has not been decided yet 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:25.579
 It is a long way from the restoration of the whole town though the shops etc. are resumed in the temporary building 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:36.110
 A day to confront reconstruction with the burden of sadness 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:41.330
 Victims cherish the feeling of sharing and supporting neighbors in shelters 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:47.920
 Some people do not realize that they are holding stress 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:53.160
 So what the Japanese Red Cross Society started was a tea ceremony and relaxation at a temporary housing meetinghouse. 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:53.160
 In this way it leads to the care of the mind in a natural way 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:03:02.900
 I lost not only my house but also my job, and after that too much I lost too much to move forward very much 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:07.780
 I can not switch my feelings by 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:07.780
 I think that I need mental care 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:20.260
 Immediately after the earthquake, the Japanese Red Cross Society dispatched nearly 900 teams of 15 teams and became a refuge school and 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:27.040
 We treated approximately 90,000 people in patrol medical treatment 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:30.989
 Many of the affected clinics are now reuniting at the Royal Palace facilities, but adequate medical services 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.989
 It is not an environment that can be provided 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:42.239
 So take advantage of the relief funds from around the world 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:42.239
 We support the reconstruction of hypothesized clinics and hospitals 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:57.160
 The baby is 200 days a day, and the doctor's office is also narrow. 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:04:03.190
 Also that the toilet of the hypothesis that water is also not come in the fiscal surface after and it can be waiting also went narrow of patients 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:04.460
 It is a little patient to see this for a long time just by saying that it is a hypothesis 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:08.900
 In that it takes a burden 

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:14.560
 Also , it may take 3 to 5 years for this section. 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:14.560
 Red Cross's auxiliary got to have decided to build the first of hobbyists 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:26.600
 The next day to the occurrence of an accident in the first nuclear power plant in Fukushima explosion earthquake to 3:30 pm too much 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:30.530
 Evacuation instructions were issued within 20 km 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:34.780
 In spite to many residents fled with only the clothes on their backs 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:34.780
 Only temporary return is allowed 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:47.980
 Yamada from Namie Town 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:54.569
 I took out a photo of memories with my husband who passed away four months before the earthquake when I returned home. 

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:56.529
 Not only anxiety about radiation but also regret that I can not return home 

00:04:54.569 --> 00:04:59.060
 I'd want Monde Le 

00:04:56.529 --> 00:05:02.820
 Since radioactivity is strong 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:07.470
 The number of mountain Mendi to or can not take 

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:11.150
 There is an evacuation order and the place where you evacuated is that the radiation is high 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:11.150
 It was found later that say 

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:20.600
 People are not only based on natural disasters, but also based on more information on accidents like this one 

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:23.920
 It is necessary to keep well 

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:30.030
 To prepare for disasters such as the nuclear accident 

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:30.030
 We will proceed to the national Red Cross together with the fact that we make the international guidelines 

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:42.780
 Parents hesitate to let children play outside even in Fukushima City, which is more than 60 kilometers from the nuclear power plant 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:50.120
 There are many 

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:56.670
 After hearing such voices, the Japanese Red Cross Society installed Smile Park for indoor play. 

00:05:50.120 --> 00:06:01.980
 Here you can see the children doing a vigorous exercise 

00:05:56.670 --> 00:06:06.260
 The Red Cross continues to stay close to the victims and lives and health 

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:06.260
 We will continue our activities to protect dignity 

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:24.530
 2 

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:53.280
 Ah ah ah ah
