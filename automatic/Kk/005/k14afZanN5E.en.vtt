00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:16.029
 the discussion had started with the 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:17.830
 reduced group on what was the nogada 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:19.000
 original chilli stuffed 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:20.980

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.770
 until the fall they had summoned 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:26.560
 lecture on the subject the place is 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:29.560
 millennial some researchers assume 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.330
 its origin in Persia and India - the Greeks 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.760
 they would have taken it to the Mediterranean and 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:36.670
 aroma from where it spread through the 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:38.590
 continent to Spanish walnut is known 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:43.300
 since a tree with a 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:46.030
 long childhood takes 10 to 15 years in

 offer edible fruits and his life 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.809
 exceeds the cycle 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:51.700
 have been found remains of shells of 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:54.430
 the nut in the tombs of Carthage and Lily 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:56.860
 I see the ancient Sicily the fruit of 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:58.540
 walnut has been used as a contribution of 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:00.399
 calories to the armies and during 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:03.640
 many years it was called walnuts 

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:06.580
 generically to the walnut fruit the 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:09.729
 almonds the pistachio nuts and 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:12.310
 even the chestnuts with this 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:14.770
 denomination of nuts were recorded 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.899
 convent recipes on the peninsula and 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.470
 they settled after the conquest in 

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:22.090
 the new spain the Franciscans 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.700
 especially they brought and 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:27.970
 planted in the skirts of popocatépetl 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:31.179
 18th century manuscripts found 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:33.910
 in Mexican convents register a 

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:37.119
 version of nogada reduced to grind 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:40.420

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:46.210
 of bread another asked to toast the is not before 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:50.470
 and ground cheese powder was added 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:53.200
 also the Mexican cook of 1831 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:53.659
 records the salad for the first time 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.479
 lime 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:59.090
 if you're in nogada you remembered the fall 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:01.579
 the text is soaked in warm water the 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:04.069
 amount that is needed according to 

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:06.649
 large walnuts salad and you'll be 

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:09.440
 will remove the skin soak too 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:12.560
 almonds but in less quantity than 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.690
 nuts and peel both are ground 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.360
 in a very clean metate with garlic and 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:19.970
 pepper of luck that excels the 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.819
 flavor of this a crumbed loaf of bread 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:25.420

 stuffed in nogada other where the same 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:36.019
 sauce is recommended for bobo fish 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.480
 one more of beets is in nogada where the 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:41.810
 consistency of the sauce should be 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.970
 as atole and continued his dissertation the 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:46.730
 adventurous knower of not having 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.680
 competition in the group talked about the 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.299
 appearance of the facsimile called new 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:54.590
 Mexican chef in the shape of 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:57.500
 dictionary edited in 1874 in Paris by 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.570
 ballot there the definition of 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:02.270
 nogada 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:06.200
 sauce made from almond nuts or from 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:08.090
 both with spices and oil the 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.390
 document also mentions the nogada 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:12.940
 for chiles rellenos 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:15.420
 the sauce is made by grinding our 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:17.740
 fresh, well-cleaned and skinned 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:20.800
 adding a little bit of pepper and a 

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:22.480
 little bread soaked in vinegar after 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:25.690
 of well-ground everything is seasoned with 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:28.270
 vinegar good throwing after salt and 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:31.330
 oil to eat leaving the caldillo 

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:33.790
 very thick it is noticed that the nogada is 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:37.150
 puts black throwing salt with much 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:39.370
 anticipation to serve the sauce is thrown 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:41.950
 the chiles will heat up and hot 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:45.040
 will spread on a platter and bathe with 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:47.560
 the nogada already seasoned throwing them if 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:50.560
 wants some grains of pomegranate 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:53.080
 to decorate the nogada is made of 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:55.510
 all substances like the nugget the 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:58.300
 almond and others but none is so 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:00.430
 tasty as the nut said the 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:03.609
 recipe book 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:05.799
 more than four had protested then 

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:07.450
 none of the recipes offered by the 

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:10.180
 adventurer corresponded fairly 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:13.420
 known by all and of course there was a reason 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:15.430
 in it said salah cain the recipe 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:19.329
 today known as the nogada is gone 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:20.799
 perfecting after 1831 he reached 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:23.380
 its splendor no doubt in the nascent 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:27.250
 20th century when the cooks hand 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:29.110
 Puebla was reinforced with seasoning and 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:31.000
 the preparation experience 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:34.630
 influenced by French customs 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:37.650
 then he paused the cain room chilli 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:40.599
 in nogada they were for several decades 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:44.349
 exiled from the cookbooks are 

00:04:40.599 --> 00:04:46.570
 considered an imperial dish alien to 

00:04:44.349 --> 00:04:49.050
 the republic of juárez and they were 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:52.740
 reduced to an angelopolitana custom 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:55.110
 practiced secretly from the liberals 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:59.190
 in the poblana cook or book of the 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:05:01.949
 families seventh edition of 1907 by 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:04.710
 blacksmith brothers successors appear the 

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:09.419
 first formal recipes under the 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:12.120
 numbers 1300 78 and 79 of the nogada and 

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:13.860
 nogada for chiles rellenos the first 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:16.620
 suggested by the cookbook for 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:19.919
 stuffed with picadillo 100 are taken 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:22.410
 nuts are assembled from the night and they go 

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:25.530
 throwing in cold water the next day it 

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:28.770
 they grind and since they got off the metate they 

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:31.169
 grinds half fresh cheese 4 separately 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:33.270
 ounces of well-washed pumpkin nugget 

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:35.789
 so that you can remove the green pellejito 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:39.900
 that covers the crumb of a cake 

00:05:35.789 --> 00:05:42.720
 soaked a roasted garlic head 4 or 5 

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:45.569
 nails and what is caught with two fingers 

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:48.270
 cumin and ground is stirred all with 

00:05:45.569 --> 00:05:50.000
 the corresponding salt is denied 

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:53.970
 take with chilli stuffed with hash 

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.650
 but it is served separately adorning it 

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:58.460
 with pomegranate and parsley teeth 

00:05:55.650 --> 00:06:00.949
 leafless said the cookbook 

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:03.800
 as you will see said the adventurer there was 

00:06:00.949 --> 00:06:06.020
 several nogada recipes never a single 

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:08.360
 according to the time the experience the 

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:12.259
 tradition of each family is like 

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:14.330
 nogada evolves or involution over 

00:06:12.259 --> 00:06:17.630
 all if you add ingredients foreign to 

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:20.030
 the castilla nut or substitutes and which 

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:23.660
 is the recipe of your family they asked 

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:27.199
 room I fell and responded is a syncretism 

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:30.830
 derived from the experience of an aunt 

00:06:27.199 --> 00:06:33.380
 great-grandmother and the conventual influence 

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:36.650
 of the late 19th century refined by the 

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:38.389
 aunts and is simple mixing 

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:41.870
 it's not from Castilla with a little 

00:06:38.389 --> 00:06:44.270
 almond both peeled is added a little 

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:46.759
 of salted fresh cheese only for 

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:49.580
 amalgamate a splash of milk to 

00:06:46.759 --> 00:06:52.370
 give volume and lower the salt metate 

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:55.070
 and sugar and a touch of sherry 

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:58.250
 secrets are in how the nut is peeled 

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:59.740
 when and where the nogada is prepared and 

00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:02.410
 how it is served 

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:04.360
 and then I remember those afternoons 

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:07.120
 where the great aunts and several 

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:10.060
 girls were engaged one to crack the 

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:12.910
 other nuts to soak them and change them 

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:16.419
 the water when it turned black and the 

00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:20.349
 more to peel them with a requirement sine qua 

00:07:16.419 --> 00:07:23.620
 they should not stop talking about talking 

00:07:20.349 --> 00:07:24.490
 family stories were told gossip 

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:27.190
 news 

00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:30.940
 all to prevent eating the 

00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:34.000
 freshly peeled walnuts a whole delicacy 

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:37.330
 of the aunts said God gives nuts to whom 

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:39.580
 does not know shells in that environment it 

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:44.699
 they passed the oral traditions of mouth 

00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:44.699
 on the palate in total disuse 100 years later 

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:54.460
 no no 

00:07:56.590 --> 00:07:59.130
 and 

00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:06.050
 or 

00:08:06.870 --> 00:08:09.410
 or
