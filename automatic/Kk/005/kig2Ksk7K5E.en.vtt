00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:08.549
 Good week to you, cashew. 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:11.309
 right in your surgery and the whole brazil 

00:00:08.549 --> 00:00:13.679
 We're hoping that everything will work out. 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:16.230
 You come back healthier with more vision. 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.930
 more willing to continue 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.660
 making your comments, Brazil does not 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.820
 You may run out of them right but we Cajuru 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.590
 starting our program soon talking about 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.020
 Brazilian championship talking about 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:31.950
 palm trees when the crowd of the truth 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:35.070
 think the palm trees will leave the z-4 there 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:37.770
 it's true it stumbles again this time 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.050
 lost to the international and the situation 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.160
 of the palm trees is 50 balloon on the screen 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.580
 for you 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:47.160
 on the seesaw highs and lows on the palm trees 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:50.760
 at the time it was generated by Paul 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:54.030
 the seesaw in this situation 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:59.250
 of the palm trees and could not be 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:02.610
 different could not you from home 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.739
 I wondered what the palm trees got 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.930
 the cruise in araraquara in the interior of 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.860
 Sao Paulo wanted to win from the international 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.860
 in porto alegre 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:16.890
 soon there is the Fluminense is not 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.200
 easy not my friend, can not you? 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.440
 Speak now the palm trees do not lose any more 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.940
 This Brazilian is really a 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:29.100
 seesaw 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:31.229
 you win a game at home you win at 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.280
 times away from home and in the next round 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.220
 you lose 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.510
 depending on the opponent and each game is 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.070
 a story 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:40.350
 the international came from a victory 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.740
 away from home in são januário against 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:47.040
 of the range and at home the inter 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.960
 up because the campaign of inter 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:53.460
 this week I will talk so far is 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:57.420
 vexative then palm trees he needs 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:59.610
 within the kalma field and I believe that 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.740
 this is existing palm trees was 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.540
 winning the goals are there you can see the 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.540
 goals or palm trees was winning the game 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:09.750
 by 1 to 0 by 1 to 0 o international 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.400
 turned the palm trees opened the board with 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:15.359
 Alan 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.990
 now jet off-field the coach of the 

00:02:15.359 --> 00:02:18.870
 palm trees 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:20.300
 gilson kleina this weekend did 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.640
 an outburst 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:25.680
 according to him he even nudged the board 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.760
 your own board your own 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.570
 boss 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:32.070
 according to him the board needs to agree 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:35.730
 and what the palm trees need at this moment 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:38.310
 political force and that it has to 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.830
 She has to do ballet. 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.120
 it's wrong not a team the size 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:45.210
 of the palm trees 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.920
 he has to be present every day he 

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:49.500
 behind the scenes of the confederation 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.270
 brazilian football cbf or house 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.430
 football bandit 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:56.730
 For me it's home football bandit but 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:59.310
 You gotta keep an eye on it. 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.590
 suddenly you are harmed 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.750
 and tomorrow will regret it tomorrow 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:07.740
 cry because you did not go there because you 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:11.850
 was present behind the scenes football 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:13.620
 I already said 70% for me worth the 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:16.920
 outfield 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:24.060
 If you're not careful, you 're 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:26.730
 messed up in the most hurtful way 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:29.060
 it is not possible that happened yes it is 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:32.580
 possible who is your president? 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:36.270
 palm that is your strong man of 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:40.710
 palm trees because the bay that 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:43.440
 is disputing with you is deceiving who 

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:45.000
 Do you think the bay has no strength? 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:50.610
 There's a guy in the football department . 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:54.420
 who knows cbf and cbf rot 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:57.480
 like no one who has certainly done 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:58.590
 things arch-tac-toe in backstage 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.080
 soccer 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:01.770
 I'm talking about paulo angioni I 'm 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:03.810
 wrong 

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:05.190
 Now who is the Angolan paul? 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.990
 palm trees 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:08.550
 I already talked about the situation of the 

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:09.960
 palms and other clubs the cruise 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:14.730
 from Minas 

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:17.970
 I already told you what football is made for 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:20.430
 who is not a virgin because the 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:24.900
 football a brothel Tebol one 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:25.860
 brothel for you to live and know how to have 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:28.350
 force 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:29.460
 not that you need to steal to 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:31.919
 you from a judge 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:35.669
 it will not benefit you not to be 

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:37.560
 stolen so you will not be harmed 

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:39.569
 For this you have to stay there all 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:43.650
 there is someone skilled in it. 

00:04:39.569 --> 00:04:47.819
 someone smart as someone treteiro 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:49.849
 says in the slang and the palm trees have 

00:04:47.819 --> 00:04:53.250
 president of the palm trees is virgin 

00:04:49.849 --> 00:04:56.610
 totally virgin within a 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:57.750
 championship that in this fight for the 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:01.710
 demotion 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:06.479
 oras balls will have to repeat things 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:08.880
 evident arc-of-old expression and 

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:13.910
 to conclude with the attitude of the 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:17.370
 assumption is the least bad 

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:21.449
 this whole story is one of the most 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:24.060
 of this history throughout the 

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:26.430
 assumption came to the public and stated that 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:29.310
 if the palm trees are for the b series he 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:30.240
 will be wearing the palm tree shirt and 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:33.090
 in good 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:34.650
 disputing series b to talk about 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:37.710
 this landmark assumption has already made a 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:39.650
 statement arrives think of series a and each 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:42.419
 game is a story and mainly 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:44.580
 each game is a championship decision 

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:46.789
 for the palmeiras paulo 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:46.789
