in case you're struggling to see from my
muck<00:00:57.319> coordinates<00:00:58.030> next<00:00:59.030> up<00:00:59.179> is<00:00:59.389> the<00:00:59.600> dv8

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:00.049 
muck coordinates next up is the dv8

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:02.259 
muck coordinates next up is the dv8
hatchling<00:01:00.649> and<00:01:00.829> this<00:01:01.100> is<00:01:01.280> found<00:01:01.549> in<00:01:01.699> whaling

00:01:02.259 --> 00:01:02.269 
hatchling and this is found in whaling

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:04.000 
hatchling and this is found in whaling
caverns<00:01:02.690> which<00:01:03.019> is<00:01:03.170> in<00:01:03.319> the<00:01:03.409> Barrens<00:01:03.739> the

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.010 
caverns which is in the Barrens the

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:06.250 
caverns which is in the Barrens the
north<00:01:04.220> bones<00:01:04.540> you<00:01:05.540> can<00:01:05.690> only<00:01:05.810> get<00:01:06.049> it<00:01:06.140> from

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:06.260 
north bones you can only get it from

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.200 
north bones you can only get it from
here<00:01:06.560> and<00:01:06.770> it<00:01:06.860> is<00:01:06.979> a<00:01:07.010> low<00:01:07.340> drop<00:01:07.640> rate<00:01:07.670> from<00:01:08.060> the

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
here and it is a low drop rate from the

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.450 
here and it is a low drop rate from the
dv8<00:01:08.630> dinosaurs<00:01:09.560> in<00:01:09.770> here<00:01:09.950> the<00:01:10.070> deviant

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460 
dv8 dinosaurs in here the deviant

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.380 
dv8 dinosaurs in here the deviant
raptors<00:01:11.170> so<00:01:12.170> the<00:01:13.130> best<00:01:13.340> bet<00:01:13.550> is<00:01:13.700> to<00:01:13.730> just<00:01:13.910> clear

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
raptors so the best bet is to just clear

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:15.910 
raptors so the best bet is to just clear
the<00:01:14.510> Raptors<00:01:14.900> I<00:01:15.020> think<00:01:15.230> there's<00:01:15.410> a<00:01:15.470> tall<00:01:15.710> of

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
the Raptors I think there's a tall of

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.000 
the Raptors I think there's a tall of
between<00:01:16.280> 25<00:01:16.730> to<00:01:16.940> 30<00:01:17.420> Raptors<00:01:17.960> in<00:01:17.990> here<00:01:18.290> and<00:01:18.500> it

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:19.010 
between 25 to 30 Raptors in here and it

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:20.050 
between 25 to 30 Raptors in here and it
comes<00:01:19.160> from<00:01:19.310> the<00:01:19.550> dv8

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 
comes from the dv8

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.920 
comes from the dv8
ravager<00:01:20.780> or<00:01:20.990> the<00:01:21.350> dv8<00:01:21.800> Guardium<00:01:22.750> just<00:01:23.750> kill

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:23.930 
ravager or the dv8 Guardium just kill

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:25.450 
ravager or the dv8 Guardium just kill
out<00:01:24.080> all<00:01:24.260> these<00:01:24.440> and<00:01:24.830> you'll<00:01:24.980> just<00:01:25.130> have<00:01:25.340> to

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
a short period of time so you will have

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.970 
a short period of time so you will have
to<00:01:47.030> wait<00:01:47.210> a<00:01:47.240> while<00:01:47.480> to<00:01:47.780> do<00:01:47.900> more<00:01:48.170> than<00:01:48.350> four<00:01:48.860> or

five rooms depending on how quick you

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.050 
five rooms depending on how quick you
are<00:01:50.659> but<00:01:51.290> you<00:01:51.560> should<00:01:51.740> level<00:01:52.159> 85<00:01:52.640> you<00:01:52.880> should

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 
are but you should level 85 you should

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:54.720 
are but you should level 85 you should
play<00:01:53.300> through<00:01:53.540> this<00:01:53.659> in<00:01:53.840> about<00:01:53.930> five<00:01:54.350> minutes

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:54.730

a lot of times in the Barrens I find

00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:25.479 
a lot of times in the Barrens I find

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:25.489 
this quite frequently so you shouldn't

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:27.880 
this quite frequently so you shouldn't
have<00:02:25.610> too<00:02:25.790> much<00:02:25.939> trouble<00:02:26.000> finding<00:02:26.420> this<00:02:26.890> once

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
have too much trouble finding this once

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:29.110 
have too much trouble finding this once
again<00:02:28.159> there<00:02:28.340> will<00:02:28.400> be<00:02:28.459> a<00:02:28.579> map<00:02:28.819> in<00:02:29.000> the

accurate basically location for each of
the<00:02:34.549> nest<00:02:34.790> but<00:02:35.030> this<00:02:35.209> is<00:02:35.390> the<00:02:35.599> birth

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
the nest but this is the birth

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.819 
the nest but this is the birth
coordinates<00:02:36.709> of<00:02:36.829> each<00:02:36.920> nest<00:02:37.750> and<00:02:38.750> there's<00:02:39.379> one

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:39.829 
coordinates of each nest and there's one

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:41.289 
coordinates of each nest and there's one
of<00:02:39.920> the<00:02:40.010> x<00:02:40.159> so<00:02:40.579> that's<00:02:40.640> what<00:02:40.879> it<00:02:40.970> looks<00:02:41.150> like

00:02:41.289 --> 00:02:41.299 
of the x so that's what it looks like

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:43.390 
of the x so that's what it looks like
you<00:02:41.420> basically<00:02:41.569> just<00:02:41.959> click<00:02:42.140> on<00:02:42.379> it<00:02:42.530> and<00:02:42.620> lude

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
you basically just click on it and lude

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.259 
you basically just click on it and lude
the<00:02:43.549> egg<00:02:43.670> or<00:02:44.420> loop<00:02:45.049> the<00:02:45.280> pendulum<00:02:46.280> and<00:02:46.489> it'll

00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:47.269 
the egg or loop the pendulum and it'll

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:48.819 
the egg or loop the pendulum and it'll
just<00:02:47.390> be<00:02:47.480> the<00:02:47.659> path<00:02:47.840> the<00:02:48.079> next<00:02:48.349> one<00:02:48.500> up<00:02:48.620> is<00:02:48.799> the

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:48.829 
just be the path the next one up is the

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:50.740 
just be the path the next one up is the
reversal<00:02:49.459> -<00:02:49.970> and<00:02:50.120> that<00:02:50.209> one<00:02:50.329> looks<00:02:50.540> pretty

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
reversal - and that one looks pretty

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.589 
reversal - and that one looks pretty

the die in hatchling this is contained
in<00:02:57.799> nests<00:02:59.319> so<00:03:00.319> you<00:03:00.379> have<00:03:00.530> to<00:03:00.620> keep<00:03:00.739> an<00:03:00.920> eye<00:03:01.010> out

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
in nests so you have to keep an eye out

in nests so you have to keep an eye out
for<00:03:01.190> the<00:03:01.400> nests<00:03:01.609> and<00:03:01.940> try<00:03:02.150> and<00:03:02.239> find<00:03:02.389> it<00:03:02.569> now

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
for the nests and try and find it now

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:04.539 
for the nests and try and find it now
the<00:03:02.750> they're<00:03:03.319> all<00:03:03.470> pretty<00:03:03.650> much<00:03:03.799> in<00:03:03.889> the<00:03:04.190> east

00:03:04.539 --> 00:03:04.549 
the they're all pretty much in the east

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:06.099 
the they're all pretty much in the east

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:06.109 
of them Goro creates as you can see on

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:07.899 
of them Goro creates as you can see on
the<00:03:06.200> map<00:03:06.349> and<00:03:06.590> there<00:03:06.799> that's<00:03:07.190> sort<00:03:07.760> of<00:03:07.790> the

rough area for all the nests by I'm

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:11.289

you the exact spawn points and

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.580 
you the exact spawn points and
coordinates<00:03:19.909> from<00:03:20.450> Wow<00:03:20.690> head<00:03:20.959> if<00:03:21.199> you<00:03:21.379> need

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
coordinates from Wow head if you need

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.069 
coordinates from Wow head if you need
basically<00:03:22.280> a<00:03:22.579> more<00:03:22.790> accurate<00:03:22.970> look<00:03:23.840> at<00:03:23.989> the

inside<00:03:44.329> the<00:03:44.540> cave<00:03:44.810> there<00:03:45.769> will<00:03:45.949> be<00:03:45.980> sort<00:03:46.549> of<00:03:46.609> a

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:46.730 
inside the cave there will be sort of a

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:50.229 
inside the cave there will be sort of a
peak<00:03:47.290> there<00:03:48.290> we<00:03:48.379> go<00:03:48.530> and<00:03:48.879> basically<00:03:49.879> on<00:03:50.090> this

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:50.239 
peak there we go and basically on this

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:52.030 
peak there we go and basically on this
little<00:03:50.449> peak<00:03:50.750> you'll<00:03:51.049> find<00:03:51.290> the<00:03:51.379> nest<00:03:51.620> this<00:03:51.889> is

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.040 
little peak you'll find the nest this is

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:53.920 
little peak you'll find the nest this is
the<00:03:52.190> only<00:03:52.430> place<00:03:52.669> in<00:03:53.000> the<00:03:53.150> cave<00:03:53.329> that<00:03:53.540> the<00:03:53.720> nest

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930 
the only place in the cave that the nest

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:55.360 
the only place in the cave that the nest
can<00:03:54.169> spawn<00:03:54.470> so<00:03:54.739> if<00:03:54.799> you're<00:03:54.919> looking<00:03:55.010> for<00:03:55.310> this

pretty much every single mob has a
of<00:04:29.879> dropping<00:04:30.240> them<00:04:30.389> pat<00:04:30.569> but<00:04:31.139> it<00:04:31.289> is<00:04:31.409> a<00:04:31.439> 1<00:04:31.800> in

1000 so the best bet is to pick a nice

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:36.770 
1000 so the best bet is to pick a nice
spot<00:04:35.219> that's<00:04:35.430> got<00:04:35.580> a<00:04:35.610> lot<00:04:35.819> of<00:04:35.849> mobs<00:04:36.180> that<00:04:36.360> have
