so the second thing you want to notice

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.440 
so the second thing you want to notice
is<00:01:26.220> you<00:01:26.340> don't<00:01:26.549> have<00:01:26.729> to<00:01:26.880> lure<00:01:27.090> in<00:01:27.299> this

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
is you don't have to lure in this

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.630 
is you don't have to lure in this
strategy<00:01:27.720> you're<00:01:28.409> bringing<00:01:28.799> 3<00:01:29.070> golems<00:01:29.310> but

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
strategy you're bringing 3 golems but

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.700 
strategy you're bringing 3 golems but
you<00:01:29.729> have<00:01:29.880> plenty<00:01:30.060> of<00:01:30.360> firepower<00:01:30.900> as<00:01:31.200> well<00:01:31.470> a

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
you have plenty of firepower as well a

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.520 
you have plenty of firepower as well a

lot of wizards and witches as well so

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.469

you<00:01:34.950> don't<00:01:35.220> really<00:01:35.490> necessarily<00:01:35.729> need<00:01:36.420> to

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
you don't really necessarily need to

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.270 
you don't really necessarily need to
lure<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:36.869> clan<00:01:37.020> castle<00:01:37.350> if<00:01:37.619> it's<00:01:37.740> very<00:01:37.979> easily

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:26.320 
it in two different locations on the

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.680 
it in two different locations on the
base<00:02:26.560> really<00:02:27.250> opening<00:02:27.670> up<00:02:27.790> the<00:02:27.940> entire<00:02:28.300> base

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
base really opening up the entire base

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.750 
base really opening up the entire base
why<00:02:29.230> are<00:02:29.290> as<00:02:29.560> earthquake<00:02:30.250> although<00:02:30.610> it

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
why are as earthquake although it

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.700 
why are as earthquake although it
doesn't<00:02:31.000> create<00:02:31.390> the<00:02:31.480> lag<00:02:31.870> which<00:02:32.170> is<00:02:32.290> really

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:32.710 
doesn't create the lag which is really

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:35.340 
doesn't create the lag which is really
nice<00:02:32.890> with<00:02:33.160> all<00:02:33.340> these<00:02:33.520> dps<00:02:34.240> units<00:02:34.720> and<00:02:34.960> it

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
nice with all these dps units and it

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:38.490 
nice with all these dps units and it
also<00:02:35.500> opens<00:02:36.040> up<00:02:36.130> a<00:02:36.750> larger<00:02:37.750> amount<00:02:38.080> of<00:02:38.170> walls

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
also opens up a larger amount of walls

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.650 
also opens up a larger amount of walls
which<00:02:39.130> actually<00:02:39.490> helps<00:02:39.790> funnel<00:02:40.210> your<00:02:40.390> attack

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
which actually helps funnel your attack

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.840 
which actually helps funnel your attack
better<00:02:41.050> but<00:02:41.530> the<00:02:41.620> downside<00:02:41.800> is<00:02:42.250> obviously

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:42.850 
better but the downside is obviously

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:45.360 
better but the downside is obviously
you're<00:02:43.060> gonna<00:02:43.180> want<00:02:43.540> to<00:02:43.630> bring<00:02:43.990> those<00:02:44.650> those

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
you're gonna want to bring those those

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
hogs or balloons for the second half of

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.620 
hogs or balloons for the second half of
your<00:02:47.680> attack<00:02:47.950> to<00:02:48.100> get<00:02:48.220> over<00:02:48.490> those<00:02:48.610> walls<00:02:48.940> get

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.630 
your attack to get over those walls get

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:51.660

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
take out the DPS units so anyway you can

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.970 
take out the DPS units so anyway you can
see<00:02:57.400> here<00:02:57.670> the<00:02:58.090> the<00:02:58.600> DPS<00:02:58.990> r2<00:02:59.380> have<00:02:59.560> taken<00:02:59.860> down

see here the the DPS r2 have taken down

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.010 
see here the the DPS r2 have taken down
the<00:03:00.040> dragon<00:03:00.670> the<00:03:01.090> attack<00:03:01.390> at<00:03:01.570> this<00:03:01.720> point

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:02.020 
the dragon the attack at this point

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:03.450 
the dragon the attack at this point
looks<00:03:02.230> like<00:03:02.350> it<00:03:02.470> might<00:03:02.680> be<00:03:02.710> fizzling<00:03:03.280> out<00:03:03.430> a

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:03.460 
looks like it might be fizzling out a

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:04.620 
looks like it might be fizzling out a
little<00:03:03.670> bit<00:03:03.880> but<00:03:04.060> he<00:03:04.120> did<00:03:04.270> bring<00:03:04.390> those

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:04.630 
little bit but he did bring those

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:06.630 
little bit but he did bring those
balloons<00:03:05.080> and<00:03:05.530> he's<00:03:05.740> gonna<00:03:05.860> be<00:03:06.040> very<00:03:06.070> careful

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
balloons and he's gonna be very careful

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.820 
balloons and he's gonna be very careful
to<00:03:06.910> take<00:03:07.090> out<00:03:07.270> as<00:03:07.390> much<00:03:07.660> splash<00:03:08.140> damage<00:03:08.590> as<00:03:08.800> he

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:08.830 
to take out as much splash damage as he

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:11.790 
to take out as much splash damage as he
can<00:03:09.070> because<00:03:10.060> obviously<00:03:10.300> in<00:03:10.780> a<00:03:10.870> gowiwi<00:03:11.260> attack

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:11.800 
can because obviously in a gowiwi attack
