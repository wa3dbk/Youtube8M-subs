00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:06.890 
really glad that I picked it out and

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:08.290 
really glad that I picked it out and
normally<00:04:07.250> I<00:04:07.310> don't<00:04:07.610> like<00:04:07.760> these<00:04:07.910> type<00:04:08.270> of

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:11.090 
toggle clasps but I do find that this

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:15.520 
toggle clasps but I do find that this
ones<00:04:11.710> it's<00:04:12.710> not<00:04:12.980> very<00:04:13.190> easy<00:04:13.430> to<00:04:13.690> put<00:04:14.690> on<00:04:14.720> or<00:04:15.500> I

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:15.530 
ones it's not very easy to put on or I

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:17.650 
ones it's not very easy to put on or I
didn't<00:04:16.489> have<00:04:16.519> too<00:04:16.880> much<00:04:16.970> of<00:04:17.120> our<00:04:17.269> time<00:04:17.299> getting

it off but I do think that it's going to
stay<00:04:20.930> put<00:04:21.260> nicely<00:04:22.040> it's<00:04:22.220> not<00:04:22.400> going<00:04:22.640> to<00:04:22.730> fall
