00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
it so special is not only does react

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.029 
it so special is not only does react
with<00:00:56.670> one<00:00:56.879> two<00:00:57.090> three<00:00:57.420> or<00:00:57.660> five<00:00:57.960> fingers<00:00:58.500> it

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
with one two three or five fingers it

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.740 
with one two three or five fingers it
can<00:00:59.219> actually<00:00:59.340> interact<00:00:59.760> with<00:01:00.090> any<00:01:00.359> fingers

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
that touch the screen so for example if
