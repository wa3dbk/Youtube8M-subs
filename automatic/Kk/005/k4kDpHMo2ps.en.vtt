very fast getting a working prototype
where<00:01:46.649> it<00:01:46.710> before<00:01:47.130> we<00:01:47.850> had<00:01:47.970> to<00:01:48.149> go<00:01:48.329> through<00:01:48.810> the

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
where it before we had to go through the

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.499 
where it before we had to go through the
process<00:01:49.290> of<00:01:49.939> manufacturing<00:01:50.939> and<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.329> real

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
process of manufacturing and the real

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.620 
process of manufacturing and the real
workshop<00:01:52.290> we<00:01:52.439> takes<00:01:52.649> a<00:01:52.740> lot<00:01:52.890> of<00:01:52.920> time<00:01:53.479> and<00:01:54.479> a

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
workshop we takes a lot of time and a

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.499 
workshop we takes a lot of time and a
lot<00:01:54.659> of<00:01:54.780> efforts<00:01:55.290> here<00:01:56.100> we<00:01:56.280> can<00:01:56.460> build<00:01:56.700> we<00:01:57.329> can

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
lot of efforts here we can build we can

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.590 
lot of efforts here we can build we can
test<00:01:57.780> you<00:01:58.170> can<00:01:58.320> see<00:01:58.469> where<00:01:58.619> the<00:01:58.710> failures<00:01:59.159> are

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
test you can see where the failures are

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.240 
test you can see where the failures are
doing<00:02:00.600> scale<00:02:00.899> down<00:02:01.140> of<00:02:01.350> the<00:02:01.469> experiments<00:02:02.130> and

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
doing scale down of the experiments and

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.179 
doing scale down of the experiments and
then<00:02:03.000> go<00:02:03.750> back<00:02:03.960> to<00:02:04.020> our<00:02:04.259> drawing<00:02:04.560> board<00:02:04.860> in<00:02:05.070> our

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
then go back to our drawing board in our

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:06.410 
then go back to our drawing board in our
calculation<00:02:05.790> and

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
calculation and

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.919 
calculation and
improve<00:02:06.930> the<00:02:07.320> design<00:02:07.500> and<00:02:08.060> and<00:02:09.060> of<00:02:09.630> course<00:02:09.660> the

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
improve the design and and of course the

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.750 
improve the design and and of course the

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
doesn't have to think about this anymore

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.350 
doesn't have to think about this anymore
just<00:02:24.830> draw<00:02:25.830> your<00:02:26.069> parts<00:02:26.459> as<00:02:26.670> you<00:02:26.790> think<00:02:27.060> of<00:02:27.209> it

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
just draw your parts as you think of it

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.890 
just draw your parts as you think of it
and<00:02:27.660> you<00:02:28.380> can<00:02:28.530> print<00:02:28.739> it<00:02:28.860> if<00:02:29.040> you<00:02:29.160> have<00:02:29.280> enough

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
and you can print it if you have enough

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.080 
and you can print it if you have enough
experience<00:02:31.310> then<00:02:32.310> even<00:02:32.850> with<00:02:33.000> this

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
experience then even with this

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.370 
experience then even with this
technology<00:02:33.560> you<00:02:34.560> can<00:02:34.680> avoid<00:02:34.980> this<00:02:35.250> this

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
technology you can avoid this this

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:39.890 
technology you can avoid this this
failure<00:02:37.380> points<00:02:37.920> and<00:02:38.069> actually<00:02:38.550> build<00:02:38.900> parts

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.979 
parts millimeters and at the same time
is<00:03:31.560> also<00:03:31.859> print<00:03:32.190> or<00:03:32.370> manufacturing<00:03:33.359> parts

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
is also print or manufacturing parts

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:38.030 
is also print or manufacturing parts
which<00:03:34.140> are<00:03:34.260> large<00:03:34.560> scales<00:03:34.980> and<00:03:36.920> when<00:03:37.920> we

which are large scales and when we

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.440 
which are large scales and when we
looked<00:03:38.250> for<00:03:38.489> this<00:03:38.609> technology<00:03:39.090> we<00:03:39.209> actually

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
looked for this technology we actually

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.470 
looked for this technology we actually
found<00:03:39.570> it<00:03:39.780> object<00:03:40.170> to<00:03:40.350> supply<00:03:40.799> us<00:03:40.980> with<00:03:41.010> this

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:41.480 
found it object to supply us with this

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.599 
found it object to supply us with this

creating multi-material parts can give

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.680 
creating multi-material parts can give
us<00:03:47.160> a<00:03:47.280> great<00:03:47.489> advantage<00:03:47.850> of<00:03:49.609> combining<00:03:50.690> or

you need to get different mechanical

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.310 
you need to get different mechanical
properties<00:04:21.680> then<00:04:21.890> you<00:04:21.950> can<00:04:22.100> avoid<00:04:22.220> using

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:23.320 
properties then you can avoid using

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:28.420 
properties then you can avoid using
third-party<00:04:25.390> parts<00:04:26.390> that<00:04:27.070> this<00:04:28.070> is<00:04:28.220> usually

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:28.430 
third-party parts that this is usually

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:32.020 
third-party parts that this is usually
where<00:04:28.790> the<00:04:29.770> for<00:04:30.770> the<00:04:30.860> failure<00:04:31.220> points<00:04:31.610> are<00:04:31.820> the

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.030 
where the for the failure points are the

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:36.980 
different materials this is what we

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:39.430 
different materials this is what we
usually<00:04:37.580> see<00:04:37.790> where<00:04:38.120> the<00:04:38.240> failure<00:04:38.630> is<00:04:38.870> if<00:04:39.290> you

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:39.440 
usually see where the failure is if you

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.670 
usually see where the failure is if you
can<00:04:39.620> print<00:04:40.040> everything<00:04:40.310> in<00:04:40.580> one<00:04:40.820> shot<00:04:41.020> then<00:04:42.020> it

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:42.680 
can print everything in one shot then it

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:56.480 
can print everything in one shot then it
would<00:04:42.830> be<00:04:42.980> a<00:04:43.010> great<00:04:43.220> advantage<00:04:43.640> for<00:04:43.820> us
