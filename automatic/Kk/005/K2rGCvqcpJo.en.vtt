00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:03.490
 i 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.490
 hi hello how are you today we are going to 

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:12.099
 make a hairstyle that is a bun 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:14.860
 messy at the side is excellent if 

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:17.080
 you are going to dinner or a date 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:21.220
 will love for this the only thing that 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:22.960
 need is ride anti fat free shampoo 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:26.680
 which is a brush to give volume to 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:29.980
 hair a normal comb right now for 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:32.140
 hair and a lot of wineries of the 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:33.800
 big and small ones and now we're going 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.570
 lets start 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.790
 The first thing we are going to do is give it 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.559
 volume to our hair if this is 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:41.629
 optional and if you do not want no 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:43.160
 they have to do it but to me because in 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:45.680
 I generally like that this sector has 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.420
 more volume for this what we're going to 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.890
 do we are going to separate the high part of 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.840
 our hair 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.629
 this is going to be the one that we are going to give more 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:58.010
 volume and I'm going to tie the rest of the 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.010
 tail in the back 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:07.980
 and now I'm going to use the king shampoo 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.980
 to give volume to my hair 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.160
 and now that they moved my hair caught 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.740
 more volume in this sector does not look so 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:29.450
 now we are going to develop the 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.450
 little tail that we have behind 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.900
 and we're going to use the comb and we're not going it and 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:42.380
 let's try to keep the volume 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:46.159
 that we believe if they do not tighten it very 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:48.290
 strong and as you will see I have all my 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:50.390
 hair in a tail on the side what 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:53.840
 let's do is give volume to this 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:57.649
 tail as we do we do it using 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:02:00.770
 the brush if you sow what you have to 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:04.990
 doing is brushing from top to bottom 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.990
 up and down above 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:10.440
 if you do not have one of these brushes you can 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:13.260
 buy can use a normal comb and 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.510
 do the same thing just try to buy if 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.830
 they have a comb on the side where the 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.830
 teeth are more glued 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:30.260
 so I'm giving volume 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:33.140
 only as at 4 at about 3 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:37.090
 centimeters that are closest to the 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:37.090
 line where I tie the tail 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:43.730
 As you can see, I already have my tail 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:46.910
 volume and now what we're going to do is 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.910
 we are going to 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:53.170
 form a messy bun to the face 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.780
 radio 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:08.260
 using a limited color of our 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.260
 hair 

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:28.160
 and now we are going to use a lot of 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.160
 hooks 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.819
 to stick it 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:39.930
 Y 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:46.480
 remember that this is a hairstyle 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.100
 messy I'm the most messy thing that 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.200
 Look better 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:52.690
 Now I 'm going to show you how the 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:57.530
 back side 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:04:00.130
 because I'm destined to the hooks and 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:03.790
 hairspray 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:05.680
 as I saw hairstyle them super easy 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:08.020
 I recommend you use it more as 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:10.900
 go to a restaurant if they have an appointment 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:12.730
 if they have an event where they do not go 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.650
 to move many I do not recommend this 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:17.560
 combed to go dancing because if 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:20.080
 they wear to the disco or something like that 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:23.080
 the little hooks are going to fly by 

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:25.330
 all the places and if they liked the 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:28.330
 video do not forget to subscribe to my 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:29.590

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:35.160
 soon be careful, chao chao 

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:45.320
