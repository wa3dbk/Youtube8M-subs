that<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.490> time<00:01:41.730> management<00:01:42.240> was<00:01:42.660> not<00:01:42.840> exactly

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:43.080 
that the time management was not exactly

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.650 
that the time management was not exactly
my<00:01:43.320> strong<00:01:43.590> suit<00:01:44.070> and<00:01:44.370> so<00:01:44.550> it<00:01:44.850> sounds<00:01:45.240> like<00:01:45.270> in

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:45.660 
my strong suit and so it sounds like in

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:47.000 
my strong suit and so it sounds like in
doing<00:01:45.960> that<00:01:46.050> you<00:01:46.140> might<00:01:46.260> also<00:01:46.290> be<00:01:46.620> a<00:01:46.650> good<00:01:46.710> role

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:47.010
