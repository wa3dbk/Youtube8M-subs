sixty<00:03:27.420> two<00:03:27.540> blocks<00:03:27.780> on<00:03:27.930> me<00:03:28.049> right<00:03:28.170> now<00:03:28.200> so<00:03:28.500> I

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
sixty two blocks on me right now so I

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:30.620 
sixty two blocks on me right now so I
can't<00:03:29.040> really<00:03:29.130> show<00:03:29.280> that<00:03:29.310> but<00:03:29.640> it<00:03:30.120> builds<00:03:30.329> a

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
can't really show that but it builds a

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.170 
can't really show that but it builds a
little<00:03:31.049> Hut<00:03:31.230> so<00:03:31.919> it'll<00:03:32.130> hide<00:03:32.250> you<00:03:32.400> from<00:03:32.609> at

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
you're griefing that's speed hack

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:40.099 
you're griefing that's speed hack
there's<00:03:38.310> x-ray<00:03:38.730> and<00:03:39.180> actually<00:03:39.569> it<00:03:39.900> works

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:40.109 
there's x-ray and actually it works

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:43.550 
there's x-ray and actually it works
obviously<00:03:40.469> so<00:03:41.430> C<00:03:41.700> is<00:03:41.730> X<00:03:42.180> right<00:03:42.359> here<00:03:42.469> there's<00:03:43.469> a

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
obviously so C is X right here there's a

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.679 
obviously so C is X right here there's a
fulbright<00:03:43.980> it<00:03:44.129> has<00:03:44.250> to<00:03:44.400> be<00:03:44.519> dark<00:03:45.000> for<00:03:45.299> that<00:03:45.569> to

00:03:45.679 --> 00:03:45.689 
fulbright it has to be dark for that to

00:03:45.689 --> 00:03:49.429 
fulbright it has to be dark for that to
work<00:03:45.719> on<00:03:46.590> the<00:03:46.920> step<00:03:47.250> back<00:03:48.079> I'll<00:03:49.079> show<00:03:49.260> you<00:03:49.349> what

00:03:49.429 --> 00:03:49.439 
work on the step back I'll show you what

00:03:49.439 --> 00:03:52.520 
work on the step back I'll show you what
that<00:03:49.500> does<00:03:49.680> in<00:03:49.799> a<00:03:49.829> second<00:03:50.359> so<00:03:51.359> as<00:03:51.810> you<00:03:51.870> can<00:03:52.290> see

what's<00:04:49.860> that<00:04:49.919> trees<00:04:50.510> so<00:04:51.510> here's<00:04:51.750> a<00:04:51.810> tree<00:04:52.080> hack

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:52.260 
what's that trees so here's a tree hack

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.520 
what's that trees so here's a tree hack
here<00:04:52.530> I<00:04:53.720> guess<00:04:54.720> there's<00:04:54.900> no<00:04:55.020> trees<00:04:55.289> in<00:04:55.440> the

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:55.530 
here I guess there's no trees in the

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:58.700 
here I guess there's no trees in the
area<00:04:55.560> it'll<00:04:55.889> only<00:04:56.070> show<00:04:56.370> you<00:04:56.430> trees<00:04:57.710> I'm

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:58.710 
area it'll only show you trees I'm

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:00.260 
area it'll only show you trees I'm
obviously<00:04:58.949> not<00:04:59.310> in<00:04:59.639> here<00:04:59.789> here<00:04:59.970> where<00:05:00.120> there's

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:00.270 
obviously not in here here where there's

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:03.020 
obviously not in here here where there's
trees<00:05:00.750> I<00:05:00.990> don't<00:05:01.139> know<00:05:01.260> why<00:05:01.500> I<00:05:01.530> let<00:05:02.400> me<00:05:02.729> turn<00:05:02.849> the

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:03.030 
trees I don't know why I let me turn the

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:08.360 
trees I don't know why I let me turn the
fly<00:05:03.330> um<00:05:06.139> there<00:05:07.139> she<00:05:07.409> hears<00:05:07.680> some<00:05:08.039> treat<00:05:08.220> over

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:08.370 
fly um there she hears some treat over

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:10.010 
fly um there she hears some treat over
there<00:05:08.520> so<00:05:09.030> as<00:05:09.120> you<00:05:09.210> can<00:05:09.270> see<00:05:09.449> why<00:05:09.539> I'm<00:05:09.630> if<00:05:09.840> I<00:05:09.900> hit

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:12.630 
the ground that's all I see the trees if

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:15.499 
the ground that's all I see the trees if
I<00:05:12.750> turn<00:05:12.960> it<00:05:13.080> off<00:05:13.370> then<00:05:14.370> they<00:05:15.000> should<00:05:15.210> be<00:05:15.330> over

00:05:15.499 --> 00:05:15.509 
I turn it off then they should be over

00:05:15.509 --> 00:05:17.420 
I turn it off then they should be over
there<00:05:15.720> this<00:05:16.259> area<00:05:16.560> see<00:05:16.770> and<00:05:17.009> hear<00:05:17.190> all<00:05:17.220> the
