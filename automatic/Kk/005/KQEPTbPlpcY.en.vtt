00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.899
 the theme I insist is the coffee box 3 the 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.790
 information that came to me and what to share 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.349
 here with you and that gerardo more 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.900
 commissioned to spread on twitter that 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:16.020
 you are the king of twitter since in the 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.150
 app let's say municipal presidency of that 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.420
 level there was a lot of concern 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:24.539
 because they had heard that oribe 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:27.090
 peralta was going to leave the team saints yes 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.099
 yes they looked and that's a problem of 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:33.030
 public image but look how 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:40.399
 they handled the player to appear to be 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:42.960
 ridiculous and being that if the link is 

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:45.270
 totally an insult to intelligence 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.860
 of the town if it is an insult to the 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:51.899
 intelligence of the people because if the 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:54.059
 people get upset because they will not win 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.649
 money alejandro iraragorri will win 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.510
 more than 10 million dollars in this 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.600
 transaction and Mr. Peralta is going to 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.660
 earn thousands of pesos a month like that 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.760
 they are thousands of dollars sanz 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:07.880
 and senses please this is a business 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:09.500
 and the insured no no no I do not think so 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.500
 that they had to handle it with a lot 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:15.050
 careful that I only commented last night that 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:18.500
 them in the program 'the the subject is that 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:22.390
 beyond financial constraints or 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.390
 budget of saints that is like this 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:31.820
 first please I told you that to the and 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.979
 notice that I am saying the same thing or 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.960
 regardless of that situation that is real 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:37.550
 because we know that the budget of the 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.770
 saint has come down and they never hid it 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.780
 nobody or nothing hides reality is 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:44.539
 that the one who wants to go or the one who 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.880
 he wanted to go is the player who wanted to be 

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:48.860
 in a team at the level of america or 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.340
 chivas and it 's no sin the level 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.300
 economic yes especially in this 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.890
 competitive is better both in the 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:58.840
 last slow times that follow did not vary 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.840
 the america to america america 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.680
 judge 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:15.390
 It is to disrespect if you like 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:15.390
 offer a television contract 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:24.730

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:27.130
 your own life but only saying 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:29.650

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:33.060

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.060
 I would be volunteering 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:48.070
 and it seems that the forms are not like 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.720

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:52.150

 the ugliest of the america the horrible 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:02.260

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:07.319
 is paco reyes 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:07.319
 but the correct 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:24.489
 two years for the 32 years is a robbery or 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.500
