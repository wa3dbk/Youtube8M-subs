00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:27.470 
away from the so I got all that
water<00:04:22.730> away<00:04:23.730> from<00:04:24.030> the<00:04:25.280> foundation<00:04:26.420> so<00:04:27.420> to

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:27.480 
water away from the foundation so to

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:30.470 
water away from the foundation so to
speak<00:04:28.100> so<00:04:29.100> that's<00:04:29.280> the<00:04:29.490> gutter<00:04:29.700> for<00:04:29.970> that<00:04:30.120> part

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:30.480 
speak so that's the gutter for that part

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.420 
speak so that's the gutter for that part
there<00:04:30.720> and<00:04:30.930> then<00:04:31.050> of<00:04:31.200> course<00:04:31.260> on<00:04:31.650> this<00:04:31.800> side<00:04:31.860> I

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:32.430 
there and then of course on this side I

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:35.310 
there and then of course on this side I
have<00:04:32.790> another<00:04:33.240> gutter

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:35.320 
have another gutter

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:40.200 
have another gutter
here<00:04:36.570> lay<00:04:37.570> down<00:04:37.900> back<00:04:38.680> here<00:04:39.070> and<00:04:39.280> it's<00:04:40.090> the

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.210 
here lay down back here and it's the

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:44.040 
here lay down back here and it's the
same<00:04:41.160> sort<00:04:42.160> of<00:04:42.280> configuration<00:04:42.610> I<00:04:43.330> mean<00:04:43.960> it

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:44.050 
same sort of configuration I mean it

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:47.130 
same sort of configuration I mean it
looks<00:04:44.230> like<00:04:44.290> the<00:04:44.820> the<00:04:45.820> water<00:04:46.630> is<00:04:46.780> going<00:04:46.870> to<00:04:46.930> run

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:47.140 
looks like the the water is going to run

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:49.050 
looks like the the water is going to run
over<00:04:47.350> the<00:04:47.590> gutter<00:04:47.800> but<00:04:48.280> it's<00:04:48.580> kind<00:04:48.880> of<00:04:48.970> an

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:49.060 
over the gutter but it's kind of an

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:51.930 
over the gutter but it's kind of an
illusion<00:04:49.360> actually<00:04:50.020> it's<00:04:50.800> stuck<00:04:51.280> out<00:04:51.490> just

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:51.940 
illusion actually it's stuck out just

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:53.730 
illusion actually it's stuck out just
enough<00:04:52.510> to<00:04:52.750> where<00:04:52.930> when<00:04:53.080> the<00:04:53.140> water<00:04:53.410> comes

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:53.740 
enough to where when the water comes

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.010 
enough to where when the water comes
down<00:04:53.980> it<00:04:54.640> does<00:04:54.910> actually<00:04:55.180> go<00:04:55.480> into<00:04:55.750> the<00:04:55.840> gutter

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:56.020 
down it does actually go into the gutter

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:03.390 
down it does actually go into the gutter
so<00:04:58.560> same<00:04:59.560> thing<00:04:59.590> ever<00:05:00.430> a<00:05:01.710> hose<00:05:02.710> that's<00:05:03.070> going

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:03.400 
so same thing ever a hose that's going

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.840 
so same thing ever a hose that's going
underneath<00:05:03.790> the<00:05:03.940> building<00:05:05.400> and<00:05:06.400> it's<00:05:06.580> going

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:06.850 
underneath the building and it's going

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:10.560 
underneath the building and it's going
all<00:05:07.090> the<00:05:07.540> way<00:05:08.490> under<00:05:09.490> through<00:05:10.210> to<00:05:10.420> the<00:05:10.510> other

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:10.570 
all the way under through to the other

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:13.530 
all the way under through to the other
side<00:05:11.760> so<00:05:12.760> that'll<00:05:13.000> get<00:05:13.120> rid<00:05:13.270> of<00:05:13.300> all<00:05:13.510> that

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:13.540 
side so that'll get rid of all that

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:32.130 
side so that'll get rid of all that
water<00:05:23.310> that<00:05:24.310> I<00:05:24.370> didn't<00:05:24.640> tell<00:05:24.790> you<00:05:24.850> about<00:05:31.140> all

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:32.140 
water that I didn't tell you about all

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:36.420 
water that I didn't tell you about all
right<00:05:32.380> well<00:05:33.300> that's<00:05:34.300> where<00:05:34.630> I'm<00:05:34.720> at<00:05:34.870> now<00:05:35.430> the

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:36.430 
right well that's where I'm at now the

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:40.970 
right well that's where I'm at now the
next<00:05:36.760> stage<00:05:37.000> I<00:05:37.360> think<00:05:37.690> is<00:05:37.870> going<00:05:38.110> to<00:05:38.200> be

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:40.980 

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:44.400 

flooring<00:05:42.660> so<00:05:43.660> I'm<00:05:43.750> going<00:05:43.900> to<00:05:43.930> start<00:05:44.170> getting

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:44.410 
flooring so I'm going to start getting

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:51.000 
flooring so I'm going to start getting
the<00:05:44.500> flooring<00:05:45.540> for<00:05:47.310> the<00:05:48.310> mini<00:05:48.490> home<00:05:48.700> build
