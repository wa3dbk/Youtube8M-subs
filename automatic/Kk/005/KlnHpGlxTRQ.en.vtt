together let's take the screws put the

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:58.320 
together let's take the screws put the
lock<00:01:52.409> washers<00:01:52.860> on<00:01:53.009> each<00:01:53.159> screw

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.330 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.660 

all<00:01:59.290> right<00:01:59.530> we're<00:01:59.860> gonna<00:01:59.950> set<00:02:00.190> aside<00:02:00.460> those

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
all right we're gonna set aside those

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:02.610 
all right we're gonna set aside those
nuts<00:02:01.000> and<00:02:01.210> lock<00:02:01.420> washers<00:02:01.870> now<00:02:02.290> we're<00:02:02.530> gonna

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:02.620 
nuts and lock washers now we're gonna

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:05.280 
nuts and lock washers now we're gonna
lift<00:02:02.860> this<00:02:03.100> wheel<00:02:03.820> up<00:02:04.030> this<00:02:04.180> way<00:02:04.420> so<00:02:05.140> we're

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:05.290 
lift this wheel up this way so we're

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:06.690 
lift this wheel up this way so we're
vertical<00:02:05.680> and<00:02:05.920> we're<00:02:06.040> going<00:02:06.160> to<00:02:06.190> turn<00:02:06.490> this

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 
vertical and we're going to turn this

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.580 
vertical and we're going to turn this
front<00:02:07.600> end<00:02:07.720> around<00:02:07.840> so<00:02:08.229> we<00:02:08.290> can<00:02:08.410> actually

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
front end around so we can actually

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.300 
front end around so we can actually
match<00:02:08.950> those<00:02:09.310> two<00:02:09.520> parts<00:02:09.850> of<00:02:09.910> the<00:02:10.000> joint<00:02:11.310> okay

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
match those two parts of the joint okay

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:17.160 
match those two parts of the joint okay
so<00:02:13.240> here's<00:02:13.600> the<00:02:13.660> joint<00:02:14.020> here<00:02:15.990> you<00:02:16.990> got<00:02:17.140> a

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
so here's the joint here you got a

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:18.780 
so here's the joint here you got a
section<00:02:17.590> from<00:02:17.680> the<00:02:17.860> front<00:02:18.100> end<00:02:18.250> and<00:02:18.430> a<00:02:18.460> section

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
section from the front end and a section

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.490 
section from the front end and a section
from<00:02:18.880> the<00:02:19.000> rear<00:02:19.180> end<00:02:19.330> they<00:02:19.840> have<00:02:19.990> to<00:02:20.080> be<00:02:20.170> mated
