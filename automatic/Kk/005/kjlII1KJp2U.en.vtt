contouring so this will just help to

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.889 
contouring so this will just help to
bring<00:00:53.610> out<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:53.910> definition<00:00:54.449> in<00:00:54.539> your<00:00:54.570> face

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
it's all one color so you're really

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.410

eyeshadows<00:01:49.230> weren't<00:01:49.470> really<00:01:49.740> important<00:01:50.250> so

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
eyeshadows weren't really important so

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.290 
eyeshadows weren't really important so
you<00:01:50.370> don't<00:01:50.580> have<00:01:50.640> to<00:01:50.790> worry<00:01:51.060> about<00:01:51.180> getting

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:51.300 
you don't have to worry about getting

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.750 
you don't have to worry about getting
the<00:01:51.690> exact<00:01:52.110> color<00:01:52.530> if<00:01:52.890> there's<00:01:53.130> any<00:01:53.370> kind<00:01:53.640> of

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:53.760 
the exact color if there's any kind of

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:55.850 
the exact color if there's any kind of
shade<00:01:54.030> that<00:01:54.300> matches<00:01:54.570> your<00:01:55.050> skin<00:01:55.320> tone<00:01:55.470> or<00:01:55.800> is

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
shade that matches your skin tone or is

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.580 
shade that matches your skin tone or is
pretty<00:01:56.250> close<00:01:56.610> go<00:01:57.510> ahead<00:01:57.780> and<00:01:57.810> use<00:01:58.050> that<00:01:58.080> and

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
pretty close go ahead and use that and

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.470 
pretty close go ahead and use that and
that's<00:01:58.860> going<00:01:59.040> to<00:01:59.100> serve<00:01:59.490> as<00:01:59.730> our<00:01:59.820> base<00:02:00.150> color

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:00.480 
that's going to serve as our base color

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.080 
that's going to serve as our base color
so<00:02:00.750> just<00:02:00.930> apply<00:02:01.200> that<00:02:01.410> all<00:02:01.650> over<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.490> lids<00:02:02.760> and

right into the crease here place it in
first<00:02:16.650> and<00:02:16.890> then<00:02:17.010> you<00:02:17.070> can<00:02:17.220> go<00:02:17.250> ahead<00:02:17.460> and

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
strokes don't rush so it's best to start

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:07.670
