00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:09.900
 hello all welcome to our videos 

00:00:08.459 --> 00:00:11.789
 today I am at the internship 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.340
 international dance dancer 6.6 to 

00:00:11.789 --> 00:00:16.439
 the cork opera and I am with joan 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.810
 who is a future professional student 

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:20.220
 future dancer star maybe who's going 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.560
 at the school of the royal ballet of london 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.640
 during his little warm-up routine 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.830
 and great muscular strength 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.090
 we had seen a young man who made 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.350
 abdominal exercises that are not 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.449
 too much in our thinking 

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:32.160
 so she'll go show us me 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.199
 who can think together about the interest 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.760
 to have abdominals for the sake of 

00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:38.519
 power well mobilized precisely its 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:41.280
 abdominals in the dance ok so you can 

00:00:38.519 --> 00:00:43.050
 maybe lying on the side and we 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:47.909
 show what they have as exercise 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:49.829
 usually abdominals I at 15 years 

00:00:47.909 --> 00:00:51.420
 so a worst go all that effort 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.489
 sporty you can see that even as 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.739
 this here if I put my hand on his belly 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.510
 my hand as it comes off I feel very 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:01.260
 clearly that here the grand rights 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.940
 thicken and mounts hockey in the 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.440
 midday dance I'm wrong but we did not 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.909
 not really interesting to go 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.760
 shorten it's always rather and 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.500
 stretches and lengthens it's just so 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.280
 again I do not see well 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.470
 the interest of having to 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.729
 shrink shortened the abs because 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.010
 that we are not going to use this movement 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:18.580
 there in the dance to work it's 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:20.770
 blick 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:25.229
 how is it used to treat mic 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:27.310
 it was that the twists here again 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.560
 I take it we do not often see 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.540
 dancers who shrink and they get 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.920
 I feel we see rather we 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:35.560
 try to get a lot more 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.060
 far always lengthened so still a 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.920
 time this movement is really not 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.110
 appropriate and she's not going to put them 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.940
 in his dance routine nor even in the 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.440
 ballet in itself so we 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:46.210
 A little discussed and had him 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:48.250
 little bit showed our way of thinking 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.840
 so the idea was still 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.640
 strengthen her lap strap by 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.590
 can always keep a car 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.759
 grow on the back is here 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.190
 a good support of the abdominal strap 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:58.720
 so not repression so the exercise 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:01.929
 they were offered it was simply 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:04.360
 alex worse sell it at most if 

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:06.220
 we want to intensify this work could 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.970
 find the sheathing with the watchers 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.950
 boards 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.000
 we can also do the opposite of what we 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:11.080
 usually done with the hands behind 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.130
 the head to put hands 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.440
 behind the head simply 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:16.959
 and instead that it is and hand that carries 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.700
 the head is your head that pushes back 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:20.739
 hands so as if you wanted to come 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.239
 crush my hand here to the carpet not there and 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:24.790
 you breathe and the up 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:26.260
 she sells super hollow the difference of a 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.870
 manager do as you usually do 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:31.209
 Here el Hammam invents if 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.079
 she's trying to come back to her quest 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:34.690
 in my hand right now you want 

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:37.720
 crush my head here is here 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:39.160
 sell it between herman you feel gold here you 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:43.470
 go out just what insult 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:45.640
 publicis and havas ok for the obliques 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.140
 what we can do to not pack 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.820
 for you look and self grow 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:51.290
 know how to do on the side so you 'll 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:53.269
 return to the side 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:55.040
 here is your arm here behind will come 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:56.989
 like it's behind your head 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.180
 thomas little chick are you going to flex 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:00.890
 both legs in front of you your knees 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.299
 come here in front of your job then 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:03.590
 why did people bend 

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:05.030
 simply because in fact chi 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.129
 without the leather man people shattered the 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:08.689
 camber at the back to the box 

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:10.849
 of water stay very straight very stretched 

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:12.829
 we just blow a new wind 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:14.540
 between going back and you're going sovereign 

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:18.069
 little bit knees and feet if you 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:20.359
 ok here we do not work obliquely 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:22.549
 ok it's them who will make you go up 

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:24.109
 get out your belly he's working his hockey 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:25.909
 and we have no shortening has 

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:28.310
 not settle and if its size remains very 

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:29.989
 stretched hockey several levels 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:31.939
 difficulties in doing this exercise 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:34.220
 she could also keep her feet at 

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:37.159
 soil and simply expires show the 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:38.989
 days here it is to sell it back not 

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:40.220
 too much push on the support arm not no 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:42.439
 no longer lean back 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:44.180
 here and here at which my work 

00:03:42.439 --> 00:03:46.310
 of abs so be careful always 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:48.680
 thought by layer it's really first 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:50.780
 the deep abs so I suffer the 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:53.299
 sell between and you go up are you 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:54.650
 boys wind to go back that goes is 

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:56.239
 always kept self growing 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:57.639
 the more the shots column and the more the 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:04:00.319
 abs deep work 

00:03:57.639 --> 00:04:02.720
 ok so of course it's going to make both 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:03.949
 sides this exercise acta do it a little 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:05.750
 little on each side so the number of 

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:07.519
 time we can say pretty much by 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:10.459
 expiratory cycle we can say 5 

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:12.620
 modified crunch expiration and five of 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:15.199
 each side for hobbits his share is 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.699
 what you make the difference yes but 

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:18.530
 I hope this video will have you 

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:20.599
 served thanks to you can participate in 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:21.739
