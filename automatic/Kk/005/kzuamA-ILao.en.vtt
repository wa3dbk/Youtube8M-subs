00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06.810
 now talking about the flute family 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:08.849
 candy 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.500
 in the case of instruments that people with 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.480
 the way we know today that the 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.240
 form of the baroque instruments 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:18.510
 here we have a sweet flute against 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.699
 they are all right and that sweet flutes 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.859
 here is a tenor sweet flute 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.109
 The bigger the instrument, the more I repeat. 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.240
 I need you to attach this unit to him. 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.939
 play a little bit for you to show 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.679
 the difference of these sounds 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.649
 first I'll compare a little with the 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:37.610
 flute ghanassy flute sound 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.610
 renaissance 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.690
 note that the loudness of this 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.940
 instrument is very different from 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.670
 sonority of the baroque instrument because 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.250
 the Renaissance fleet by having a tube 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.530
 cylindrical it has the most serious notes 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.010
 but with a lot of sound volume 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.010
 bigger 

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:15.240
 but silver is actually bursting 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.960
 because it supports that this amount 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.960
 of air, right? 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.750
 she can handle the amount of air 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.210
 because it has a much more tube 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:31.409
 cylindrical and that because in fact the 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:34.780
 Baroque lack has practically everything 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:37.030
 then it has a structure 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.840
 different nationality for that reason 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.840
 very different 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:53.950
 the smaller sound volume is not 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:59.200
 then comparing the sound 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:02:03.220
 of the soprano flute compare then 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:05.530
 with the fault is after her second flute 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:19.480
 sweet contralto that is a little bigger 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:21.190
 a little more serious a sound 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:25.110
 a little more serious 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:25.110
 also as sweet as in the 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:35.990
 there is a very important difference in 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:38.180
 soprano fault that this person is 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:40.459
 sweet contralto is that the sweet flute 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.860
 soprano the most serious note of them is the note 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:44.480
 C is our most serious lack of such 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.060
 contract is the fa note 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:49.209
 so she has a fourth difference there 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.209
 huh 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:59.890
 would be the one that is much sharper in the 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:59.890
 that this fact 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:05.530
 Good there. 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:08.120
 following in the family the bigger the tube 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:11.060
 more severe the instrument 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:13.630
 We are in favor of having tenor become a 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.630
 a little 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:39.470
 much louder the sound and so 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:41.450
 follows the largest flagella and low 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:44.599
 flute with work sought sub 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:47.060
 neighborhood and also lack two sweet flutes 

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:50.120
 smaller is not like the soprano for example 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:51.560
 is a small picture in the case here is a 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:54.250
 Resin form is not a lack of 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.250
 wood is not 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:08.079
 the lesser of all the sharper the 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:08.079
 instrument
