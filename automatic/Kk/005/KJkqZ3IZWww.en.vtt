haven't<00:00:38.399> we<00:00:38.719> yes<00:00:39.719> I<00:00:39.899> think<00:00:39.960> we've<00:00:40.170> been<00:00:40.530> doing

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
haven't we yes I think we've been doing

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.740 
haven't we yes I think we've been doing
some<00:00:40.890> really<00:00:41.040> great<00:00:41.340> stuff<00:00:41.399> and<00:00:41.940> some<00:00:42.360> very

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
some really great stuff and some very

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.779 
some really great stuff and some very
new<00:00:42.989> things<00:00:43.320> from<00:00:43.559> very<00:00:43.829> unique<00:00:44.219> things<00:00:44.550> I

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
new things from very unique things I

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.729 
new things from very unique things I
guess<00:00:45.719> possibly<00:00:46.710> my<00:00:46.980> favorite<00:00:47.610> is<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:48.739> event

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
guess possibly my favorite is the event

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.959 
guess possibly my favorite is the event
based<00:00:49.950> motion<00:00:51.140> that's<00:00:52.140> a<00:00:52.289> really<00:00:52.680> very<00:00:53.489> new

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
based motion that's a really very new

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.880 
based motion that's a really very new
way<00:00:54.180> of<00:00:54.210> looking<00:00:54.449> at<00:00:54.719> solving<00:00:55.350> a<00:00:55.469> very<00:00:55.649> very

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
way of looking at solving a very very

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.560 
way of looking at solving a very very
difficult<00:00:56.100> problem<00:00:56.640> so<00:00:57.180> I<00:00:57.210> think<00:00:57.510> my

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
difficult problem so I think my

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.510 
difficult problem so I think my
customers<00:00:58.050> are<00:00:58.170> going<00:00:58.260> to<00:00:58.379> get<00:00:59.280> a<00:00:59.309> lot<00:00:59.370> of

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
customers are going to get a lot of

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.119 
customers are going to get a lot of
benefit<00:00:59.879> from<00:01:00.090> that<00:01:00.270> awesome<00:01:00.960> so<00:01:01.890> you've<00:01:02.100> been

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.369 
benefit from that awesome so you've been

was<00:01:17.070> part<00:01:17.430> of<00:01:17.990> solidworks<00:01:18.990> and<00:01:19.409> turned<00:01:19.650> into

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770

was part of solidworks and turned into
sort<00:01:20.009> of<00:01:20.040> a<00:01:20.130> simulation<00:01:20.759> i<00:01:21.049> was<00:01:22.049> only<00:01:22.229> there

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
sort of a simulation i was only there

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.770 
sort of a simulation i was only there
for<00:01:22.530> about<00:01:23.220> six<00:01:23.790> months<00:01:24.000> before<00:01:24.210> we<00:01:24.390> were<00:01:24.570> poor

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
for about six months before we were poor

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.160 
for about six months before we were poor
into<00:01:26.000> solidworks<00:01:27.000> and<00:01:27.479> prior<00:01:27.720> to<00:01:27.750> that<00:01:27.900> I<00:01:28.049> was

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
into solidworks and prior to that I was

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.830

a lot of places everyone asked eight

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.929 
a lot of places everyone asked eight
years<00:01:33.270> in<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.780> in<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.049> business<00:01:34.820> so<00:01:35.820> how<00:01:35.909> long

have you actually been here then
been<00:01:38.130> here<00:01:38.460> it's<00:01:38.909> easy<00:01:39.180> six<00:01:39.689> years<00:01:39.960> I<00:01:40.229> just

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
been here it's easy six years I just

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:41.749 
been here it's easy six years I just
have<00:01:40.560> to<00:01:40.619> remember<00:01:40.740> how<00:01:41.009> old<00:01:41.159> my<00:01:41.310> son<00:01:41.340> is

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
have to remember how old my son is

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.840 
have to remember how old my son is
because<00:01:42.090> I<00:01:42.710> month<00:01:43.710> after<00:01:44.189> he<00:01:44.340> was<00:01:44.520> born<00:01:44.700> I

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
because I month after he was born I

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.200 
because I month after he was born I
joined<00:01:45.860> so<00:01:46.860> he'll<00:01:47.220> be<00:01:47.250> a<00:01:47.369> solid<00:01:47.700> or<00:01:47.940> throw<00:01:48.150> in

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
joined so he'll be a solid or throw in

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.840 
joined so he'll be a solid or throw in
Anaheim<00:01:48.750> next<00:01:49.140> year<00:01:49.409> and<00:01:49.560> here<00:01:50.549> you'll<00:01:50.700> be<00:01:50.729> a

one<00:03:06.000> is<00:03:06.269> in<00:03:06.390> a<00:03:06.480> partner<00:03:06.810> pavilion<00:03:07.230> on<00:03:07.380> the<00:03:07.680> sort

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
one is in a partner pavilion on the sort

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.090 
one is in a partner pavilion on the sort
of<00:03:07.950> a<00:03:08.010> booth<00:03:08.370> and<00:03:09.049> for<00:03:10.049> whatever<00:03:10.200> reason<00:03:10.470> I

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
of a booth and for whatever reason I

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.670 
of a booth and for whatever reason I
must<00:03:11.519> have<00:03:11.700> annoyed<00:03:12.180> somebody<00:03:12.660> sometime<00:03:13.410> I'm

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
must have annoyed somebody sometime I'm

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.910 
must have annoyed somebody sometime I'm
always<00:03:14.010> there<00:03:14.609> on<00:03:14.850> the<00:03:15.060> first<00:03:15.239> night<00:03:15.590> from<00:03:16.590> six

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
always there on the first night from six

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.190 
always there on the first night from six
until<00:03:17.160> nine<00:03:17.810> shorts<00:03:18.810> for<00:03:18.989> I<00:03:19.140> should

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
until nine shorts for I should

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.229 
until nine shorts for I should
definitely<00:03:20.130> draw<00:03:20.280> the<00:03:20.340> short<00:03:20.579> straw<00:03:20.730> on<00:03:20.970> that

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
definitely draw the short straw on that

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:22.550 
definitely draw the short straw on that
so<00:03:21.450> I'm<00:03:21.540> probably<00:03:21.720> going<00:03:21.959> to<00:03:22.049> be<00:03:22.140> there<00:03:22.350> then

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
so I'm probably going to be there then

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.270 
so I'm probably going to be there then
or<00:03:23.100> that<00:03:23.609> the<00:03:23.850> like<00:03:24.180> I<00:03:24.209> say<00:03:24.480> the<00:03:24.690> user<00:03:25.280> breakout

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
or that the like I say the user breakout

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:27.830 
or that the like I say the user breakout
sessions<00:03:26.640> the<00:03:26.730> hands-on<00:03:27.060> sessions<00:03:27.480> are<00:03:27.600> most

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
sessions the hands-on sessions are most

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.210 
sessions the hands-on sessions are most
likely<00:03:28.049> to<00:03:28.140> be<00:03:28.320> floating<00:03:28.709> around<00:03:28.769> those<00:03:29.010> areas

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
likely to be floating around those areas

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.180 
likely to be floating around those areas
and<00:03:30.000> of<00:03:30.150> course<00:03:30.239> I'm<00:03:30.630> like<00:03:30.810> my<00:03:31.769> breakout

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
and of course I'm like my breakout

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.849 
and of course I'm like my breakout
