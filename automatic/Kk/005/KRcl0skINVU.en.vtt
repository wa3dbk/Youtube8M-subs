00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:58.850 
continue down but the first thing I

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:00.460 
continue down but the first thing I
would<00:02:58.910> do<00:02:59.239> this<00:02:59.600> is<00:02:59.780> your<00:02:59.900> proper<00:03:00.230> hand

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
would do this is your proper hand

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:02.470

position<00:03:00.650> and<00:03:01.190> you<00:03:01.550> can<00:03:01.700> find<00:03:01.910> fingering

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
position and you can find fingering

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.770 
position and you can find fingering
charts<00:03:02.900> online<00:03:03.700> but<00:03:04.700> first<00:03:05.000> I<00:03:05.239> would<00:03:05.420> just<00:03:05.600> try

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
charts online but first I would just try

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.650 
charts online but first I would just try
to<00:03:05.810> again<00:03:06.320> play<00:03:06.590> without<00:03:07.160> any<00:03:07.700> keys<00:03:08.180> covered

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
to again play without any keys covered

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:10.960 
to again play without any keys covered
working<00:03:09.590> on<00:03:09.709> that<00:03:09.950> and<00:03:10.220> then<00:03:10.340> adding<00:03:10.730> one

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
working on that and then adding one

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:13.330 
working on that and then adding one
finger<00:03:11.420> at<00:03:11.630> a<00:03:11.690> time<00:03:11.870> as<00:03:12.380> you<00:03:12.410> go<00:03:12.709> down<00:03:12.920> so

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
finger at a time as you go down so

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.110 
finger at a time as you go down so
that's<00:03:13.459> how<00:03:13.700> to<00:03:13.730> begin<00:03:14.000> to<00:03:14.450> play<00:03:14.690> the<00:03:14.870> clarinet
