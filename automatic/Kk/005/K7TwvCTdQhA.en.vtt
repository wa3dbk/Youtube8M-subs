00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
on my arm and then I just like wait for

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.300 
on my arm and then I just like wait for
it<00:01:44.159> to<00:01:44.250> dry<00:01:44.430> and<00:01:44.610> put<00:01:44.700> a<00:01:44.790> t-shirt<00:01:45.119> on<00:01:46.100> it's<00:01:47.100> not

as<00:01:47.520> annoying<00:01:47.729> as<00:01:47.939> I<00:01:48.030> thought<00:01:48.180> which<00:01:48.659> is<00:01:48.689> great

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
as annoying as I thought which is great

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.109 
as annoying as I thought which is great
because<00:01:49.649> I'm<00:01:49.920> really<00:01:50.310> scared<00:01:50.610> to<00:01:50.670> go<00:01:50.820> back<00:01:50.970> to

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
because I'm really scared to go back to

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.690 
because I'm really scared to go back to

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
to deal with all of the injection in

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.499

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
androgel a lot of people have been

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.150 
androgel a lot of people have been
saying<00:02:12.180> that<00:02:12.690> if<00:02:13.230> you<00:02:13.379> do<00:02:13.500> android<00:02:13.920> gel

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
saying that if you do android gel

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.890 
saying that if you do android gel
it's<00:02:14.370> not<00:02:14.580> as<00:02:14.730> efficient<00:02:15.390> as<00:02:15.630> doing

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
it's not as efficient as doing

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.680 
it's not as efficient as doing
injections<00:02:16.140> I<00:02:16.590> will<00:02:17.100> be<00:02:17.250> 100%<00:02:17.820> honest<00:02:18.330> I<00:02:18.420> did

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
injections I will be 100% honest I did

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.450 
injections I will be 100% honest I did
think<00:02:18.930> about<00:02:19.170> this<00:02:19.320> when<00:02:19.560> when<00:02:20.040> I<00:02:20.070> first

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.460 
think about this when when I first

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:23.210 
think about this when when I first
started<00:02:20.730> tea<00:02:20.940> in<00:02:21.030> 2010<00:02:21.720> I<00:02:21.960> asked<00:02:22.560> my<00:02:22.650> doctor<00:02:22.710> he

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
started tea in 2010 I asked my doctor he

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.670 
started tea in 2010 I asked my doctor he
was<00:02:23.370> like<00:02:23.520> oh<00:02:24.360> I<00:02:24.750> can<00:02:24.960> put<00:02:25.110> you<00:02:25.200> on<00:02:25.260> the<00:02:25.380> gel<00:02:25.560> is

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
was like oh I can put you on the gel is

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.110 
was like oh I can put you on the gel is
like<00:02:25.800> well<00:02:25.950> don't<00:02:26.070> you<00:02:26.250> get<00:02:26.400> like<00:02:26.550> less<00:02:26.790> teed

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
though the changes come slower if you're

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.770 
though the changes come slower if you're
on<00:02:28.800> the<00:02:28.890> gel<00:02:29.070> absolutely<00:02:29.670> not<00:02:29.880> you<00:02:30.570> get<00:02:30.690> the

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.140 
level out your hormones to like okay
always<00:02:46.950> the<00:02:47.160> same<00:02:47.340> instead<00:02:47.580> of<00:02:47.670> like<00:02:47.760> going<00:02:47.910> up

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
always the same instead of like going up

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.210 
always the same instead of like going up
and<00:02:48.330> down<00:02:48.420> from<00:02:48.570> your<00:02:48.720> injections<00:02:49.170> this<00:02:49.470> level

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
and down from your injections this level

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.820 
and down from your injections this level
up<00:02:50.310> because<00:02:50.460> you<00:02:50.550> do<00:02:50.670> it<00:02:50.700> every<00:02:50.970> day<00:02:51.000> and<00:02:51.830> so

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
up because you do it every day and so

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.110 
up because you do it every day and so
this<00:02:53.010> is<00:02:53.190> like<00:02:53.340> five<00:02:54.020> grams<00:02:55.020> of<00:02:55.410> gel<00:02:55.770> and

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
this is like five grams of gel and

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.610 
this is like five grams of gel and
actually<00:02:57.120> I<00:02:57.150> think<00:02:57.510> it's<00:02:57.660> like<00:02:57.810> five<00:02:58.110> or<00:02:58.350> ten

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
actually I think it's like five or ten

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.340 
actually I think it's like five or ten
times<00:02:58.650> as<00:02:59.400> much<00:02:59.820> tea<00:03:00.450> in<00:03:00.660> here<00:03:00.990> as<00:03:01.200> the

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
times as much tea in here as the

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:03.860 
times as much tea in here as the
injections<00:03:01.890> because<00:03:02.850> some<00:03:03.420> people<00:03:03.690> can

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
injections because some people can

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.900 
injections because some people can
absorb<00:03:04.260> it<00:03:04.410> some<00:03:04.590> people<00:03:04.680> absorb<00:03:05.130> so<00:03:05.640> it's<00:03:05.790> on

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
absorb it some people absorb so it's on

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:07.310 
absorb it some people absorb so it's on
the<00:03:06.000> skin<00:03:06.270> you<00:03:06.450> know<00:03:06.570> it<00:03:06.720> gets<00:03:06.960> into<00:03:07.230> your

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320 
the skin you know it gets into your

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:11.060 
the skin you know it gets into your
hands<00:03:07.590> it<00:03:07.800> has<00:03:07.830> to<00:03:08.070> absorb<00:03:08.340> quickly<00:03:09.470> so<00:03:10.470> it

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.070 
hands it has to absorb quickly so it

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:14.300 
hands it has to absorb quickly so it
does<00:03:11.430> you<00:03:11.760> I<00:03:12.590> think<00:03:13.590> a<00:03:13.650> lot<00:03:13.860> of<00:03:13.890> people<00:03:14.190> it's

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
does you I think a lot of people it's

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.150 
does you I think a lot of people it's
like<00:03:14.430> you<00:03:15.240> absorb<00:03:15.990> less<00:03:16.350> but<00:03:16.650> that's<00:03:16.740> not<00:03:17.010> what

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
like you absorb less but that's not what

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:18.650 
like you absorb less but that's not what
we<00:03:17.280> care<00:03:17.490> about<00:03:17.670> it's<00:03:17.880> like<00:03:17.970> how<00:03:18.180> much<00:03:18.330> tea<00:03:18.570> is

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
we care about it's like how much tea is

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.150 
we care about it's like how much tea is
actually<00:03:18.990> affecting<00:03:19.410> your<00:03:19.530> body<00:03:19.680> and<00:03:20.040> it's

00:03:59.630 --> 00:03:59.640 
the gel there's also the cream and

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:02.660 
the gel there's also the cream and
there's<00:04:00.480> testing<00:04:01.170> which<00:04:01.680> is<00:04:01.709> also<00:04:02.130> the<00:04:02.340> gel

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
there's testing which is also the gel

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:06.170 
there's testing which is also the gel
which<00:04:02.880> I<00:04:03.000> think<00:04:03.510> we<00:04:04.110> have<00:04:04.290> in<00:04:04.410> Canada<00:04:04.650> here<00:04:05.180> and

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
which I think we have in Canada here and

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.570 
which I think we have in Canada here and
that<00:04:06.390> they<00:04:06.540> use<00:04:06.570> in<00:04:07.140> the<00:04:07.380> UK<00:04:07.739> but<00:04:08.280> it's<00:04:08.430> really

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:08.580 
that they use in the UK but it's really

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:09.890 
that they use in the UK but it's really
sticky<00:04:08.970> and<00:04:09.120> I<00:04:09.209> heard<00:04:09.360> people<00:04:09.390> have<00:04:09.660> to<00:04:09.750> put

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
sticky and I heard people have to put

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:11.540 
sticky and I heard people have to put
gloves<00:04:10.230> on<00:04:10.470> and<00:04:10.739> put<00:04:10.890> it<00:04:10.980> on<00:04:11.040> in<00:04:11.130> a<00:04:11.160> week<00:04:11.310> 30

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:11.550 
gloves on and put it on in a week 30

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:12.800 
gloves on and put it on in a week 30
minutes<00:04:11.610> before<00:04:11.910> it<00:04:12.090> drives<00:04:12.300> which<00:04:12.510> just

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
minutes before it drives which just

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:15.500 
minutes before it drives which just
sounds<00:04:13.170> like<00:04:13.230> a<00:04:13.380> mess<00:04:13.860> to<00:04:14.250> me<00:04:14.370> which<00:04:15.300> really

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
sounds like a mess to me which really

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:18.020 
sounds like a mess to me which really
sucks<00:04:16.250> but<00:04:17.250> I<00:04:17.280> think<00:04:17.520> it's<00:04:17.640> cheaper<00:04:18.000> than

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
sucks but I think it's cheaper than

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:20.380 
sucks but I think it's cheaper than
androgel<00:04:18.660> but<00:04:18.840> hydrogel<00:04:19.320> for<00:04:19.500> me<00:04:19.590> is<00:04:19.650> covered

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:20.390 
androgel but hydrogel for me is covered

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:22.610 
androgel but hydrogel for me is covered
there's<00:04:21.390> also<00:04:21.540> the<00:04:21.780> patch<00:04:21.959> but<00:04:22.289> apparently

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
there's also the patch but apparently

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.260 
there's also the patch but apparently
the<00:04:22.800> patch<00:04:22.950> is<00:04:23.130> like<00:04:23.280> this<00:04:23.460> big<00:04:23.729> and<00:04:23.910> the<00:04:24.090> tea

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
the patch is like this big and the tea

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:25.430 
the patch is like this big and the tea
is<00:04:24.390> in<00:04:24.539> the<00:04:24.600> middle<00:04:24.840> and<00:04:24.990> you<00:04:25.140> can<00:04:25.289> get

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
is in the middle and you can get

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.890 
is in the middle and you can get
irritation<00:04:26.280> so<00:04:27.240> that's<00:04:27.419> why<00:04:27.539> I<00:04:27.570> did

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 
irritation so that's why I did

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.680 
irritation so that's why I did
for<00:04:28.169> the<00:04:28.229> patch<00:04:28.410> there's<00:04:28.889> also<00:04:29.240> the<00:04:30.240> deodorant

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:30.690 
for the patch there's also the deodorant

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:32.420 
for the patch there's also the deodorant
which<00:04:30.810> I<00:04:30.990> just<00:04:31.260> learned<00:04:31.470> about<00:04:31.530> because<00:04:32.070> every

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:32.430 
which I just learned about because every

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:36.020 
which I just learned about because every
from<00:04:33.240> trans<00:04:33.479> a<00:04:33.630> steak<00:04:33.870> my<00:04:34.050> friend<00:04:34.320> every<00:04:34.770> he<00:04:35.760> um

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.030 
from trans a steak my friend every he um

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:39.740 
from trans a steak my friend every he um
he<00:04:36.870> used<00:04:37.139> the<00:04:37.470> deodorant<00:04:38.040> to<00:04:38.280> kind<00:04:38.580> a<00:04:39.180> little

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:39.750 
he used the deodorant to kind a little

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:41.780 
he used the deodorant to kind a little
bit<00:04:39.900> for<00:04:40.229> a<00:04:40.260> little<00:04:40.470> while<00:04:40.650> and<00:04:40.919> actually<00:04:41.610> one

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:41.790 
bit for a little while and actually one

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:44.030 
bit for a little while and actually one
of<00:04:41.820> my<00:04:41.970> doctors<00:04:42.570> talked<00:04:43.350> to<00:04:43.470> me<00:04:43.560> about<00:04:43.650> it<00:04:43.770> so<00:04:43.979> I

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:44.040 
of my doctors talked to me about it so I

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.040 
of my doctors talked to me about it so I
think<00:04:44.100> if<00:04:44.910> it's<00:04:45.150> covered<00:04:45.360> by<00:04:45.540> my<00:04:46.020> insurance

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:46.050 
think if it's covered by my insurance

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:48.770 
think if it's covered by my insurance
and<00:04:46.650> my<00:04:46.800> Quebec<00:04:47.070> is<00:04:47.370> insurance<00:04:47.940> I'm<00:04:48.120> gonna<00:04:48.570> try
