00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:41.570
 one of the predominant activities in 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:44.840
 the economy of the Antioquia low Cauca is 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:47.050
 gold mining here a good part of the 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.310
 territory intended for this activity 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.770
 thus generating a remarkable impact 

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:52.970
 environmental conscious of this 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.010
 problematic 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:57.590
 corantioquia through its territorial 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.180
 panzenú designed a comprehensive strategy 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:02.300
 that allows to recover the floors 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:05.300
 degraded by mining so the 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:07.570
 project with acacia manju which has already 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:11.690
 intervened 45 thousand hectares 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:14.630
 reforesting with this kind of art the 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:16.940
 older house was the one we say was the 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.830
 selected species because it has a 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:20.509
 very good soil adaptability that does not 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:22.820
 have we have some requirements in 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:24.620
 about fertility levels 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.720
 it's pretty much what we have left of the 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:29.210
 development of mining activities has 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:31.880
 very short profit turns 8 years 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:34.040
 has fixation potentials 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:37.850
 nitrogen has very good production of 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:41.810
 biomass what we form and in its flowers 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:44.300
 has a very good production of honey 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:48.640
 honeys that favors also let's say the 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:48.640
 beekeeping systems installation 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:55.720
 nowadays the wood was harvested 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:58.420
 gold extraction was done again 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:01.950
 and landscape is being re-planted 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.950
 and it is replanting 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:09.950
 this is the radio river hacienda located in 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.080
 the municipality of tarazá was here where 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.690
 Corantioquia started with the first 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.900
 crops here are called yum as part 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:19.580
 of the soil recovery process 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:22.160
 currently its owner combines the 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.380
 gold exploitation with the crops of 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.810
 this tree that grows in the middle of the 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:28.940
 arid land the production of honey 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.190
 through beekeeping and 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:33.770
 transformation of acacia crops 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:36.230
 in wood products in this soil 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:39.650
 miner here mining was extracted with 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:41.150
 stakes we already generated another company that 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.620
 maybe it's more profitable 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.390
 we have to close the circle already 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.090
 We have been doing it for three years in two years 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:51.200
 we closed that is the beekeeping not you 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:54.950
 We are producing in 45 kilos per 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:57.709
 hive year per hectare we produce about 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:01.590
 150 kilos per hectare now almost to 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:04.290
 mango the kilo is sold at 6 thousand pesos 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:06.800
 and this year we closed the farm with 1500 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.800
 hives 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.250
 the territorial fans in one of 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:20.650
 CORANTIOQUIA is formed by 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:24.640
 municipalities of cáceres caucasia the catfish 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:26.980
 and nechí caras a valdivia and zaragoza here 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:29.319
 the corporation advances processes such as 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.269
 the productive mining units in 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:33.519
 I associate with the University of Antioquia 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:36.220
 the governance and ministry of 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:37.870
 environment and sustainable development 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:40.569
 soil recovery program 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:42.130
 degraded by mining is not only 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:45.220
 composed of reforestation with 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:47.620
 acacia also creates a commissioned unit 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:50.830
 of offering economic alternatives to 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:53.230
 population other than mining and more 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:55.470
 tuned with good practices 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:58.540
 productive the municipality see it 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:00.489
 superbien in the issue of generating 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:02.920
 employment recovery of degraded areas 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:06.069
 by mining and then the municipality also 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:08.860
 is very happy with the topic that 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:11.650
 we can be like in the same 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:14.230
 language with the corporation and then in 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:16.660
 common agreement with our our means 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:18.519
 environment is said an approach to 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:21.190
 institutional part both administration 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:23.050
 municipal as to the communities 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:24.910
 and they got involved in the process of 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:27.460
 production of plant material up to 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:29.890
 the establishment will subsequently be 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:32.650
 gave a permanent control and monitoring 

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:36.750
 to the plantation looking to guarantee that 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:36.750
 will take the final objective 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:48.539
 18 years ago that with antioquia as 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:50.490
 environmental authority initiated the 

00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:53.129
 recovery of degraded soils by 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:55.849
 mining through alternative crops 

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:59.340
 as the acacia in the territorial panzenú 

00:04:55.849 --> 00:05:01.919
 today almost two decades later this 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:03.930
 corporation acts by strengthening the 

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:06.300
 Heritage legality processes 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:08.879
 environmental by increasing the culture 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:11.400
 environmental and strengthening programs that 

00:05:08.879 --> 00:05:14.000
 protect and recover the ecosystems of 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:14.000
 your jurisdiction
