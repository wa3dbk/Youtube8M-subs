i use this editing software called a
pinnacle<00:01:12.119> studio<00:01:12.360> 16<00:01:12.720> ultimate<00:01:13.290> and<00:01:13.470> um<00:01:13.770> you

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
pinnacle studio 16 ultimate and um you

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:15.770 
pinnacle studio 16 ultimate and um you
could<00:01:14.549> zoom<00:01:14.760> in<00:01:14.909> but<00:01:15.030> you<00:01:15.090> can't<00:01:15.299> like<00:01:15.450> zoom<00:01:15.659> in

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
could zoom in but you can't like zoom in

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.780 
could zoom in but you can't like zoom in
the<00:01:15.900> whole<00:01:16.170> thing<00:01:16.470> you<00:01:16.650> can<00:01:16.799> only<00:01:17.009> like<00:01:17.280> zoom

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
in and it kind of looked blurry to

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.950 
in and it kind of looked blurry to

maybe take the picture and zoom in make
it<00:01:24.450> look<00:01:24.720> like<00:01:25.049> better<00:01:25.560> and<00:01:25.890> send<00:01:26.159> me<00:01:26.280> the

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
it look like better and send me the

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:27.649 
it look like better and send me the
video<00:01:26.490> of<00:01:26.820> it<00:01:26.909> or<00:01:27.000> something<00:01:27.090> that'd<00:01:27.390> be<00:01:27.509> cool

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
video of it or something that'd be cool

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.569 
video of it or something that'd be cool
but<00:01:28.200> I've<00:01:28.530> got<00:01:28.590> a<00:01:28.799> couple<00:01:29.009> of<00:01:29.130> theories<00:01:29.280> here

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
but I've got a couple of theories here

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.569 
but I've got a couple of theories here
one<00:01:30.450> theory<00:01:30.689> is<00:01:30.780> that<00:01:30.900> maybe<00:01:31.380> it's<00:01:31.740> a<00:01:32.100> map<00:01:32.549> that

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
one theory is that maybe it's a map that

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.870 
one theory is that maybe it's a map that
we<00:01:32.939> never<00:01:33.150> got<00:01:33.390> such<00:01:33.689> as<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:34.020> Paris<00:01:34.579> map<00:01:35.579> that

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
we never got such as the Paris map that

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:36.980 
we never got such as the Paris map that
maybe<00:01:36.090> it<00:01:36.210> was<00:01:36.299> just<00:01:36.329> something<00:01:36.600> like<00:01:36.810> that

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
maybe it was just something like that

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.359 
maybe it was just something like that
they<00:01:37.140> added<00:01:37.530> and<00:01:37.680> they<00:01:37.740> left<00:01:37.920> in<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.220> game

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
they added and they left in the game

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.190 
they added and they left in the game
just<00:01:38.970> for<00:01:39.150> a<00:01:39.180> little<00:01:39.240> bit<00:01:39.450> of<00:01:39.630> like<00:01:39.780> a<00:01:39.810> little

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
just for a little bit of like a little

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.649 
just for a little bit of like a little
easter<00:01:40.740> egg<00:01:40.829> or<00:01:40.950> something<00:01:41.100> and<00:01:41.460> I<00:01:42.329> don't<00:01:42.540> know

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
easter egg or something and I don't know

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:43.850 
easter egg or something and I don't know
maybe<00:01:42.840> it<00:01:42.960> was<00:01:43.049> just<00:01:43.110> something<00:01:43.350> like<00:01:43.560> that<00:01:43.710> we

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
maybe it was just something like that we

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.190 
maybe it was just something like that we
were<00:01:43.979> just<00:01:44.159> not<00:01:44.430> gonna<00:01:44.729> get<00:01:44.939> it<00:01:45.060> or<00:01:45.270> maybe<00:01:45.570> it's

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
were just not gonna get it or maybe it's

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.810 
were just not gonna get it or maybe it's
a<00:01:46.350> map<00:01:46.530> that<00:01:46.560> we<00:01:46.770> haven't<00:01:47.100> got<00:01:47.280> yet<00:01:47.520> that<00:01:47.729> we

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
a map that we haven't got yet that we

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.539 
a map that we haven't got yet that we
were<00:01:47.939> supposed<00:01:48.210> to<00:01:48.360> get<00:01:48.479> and<00:01:48.770> they're<00:01:49.770> going

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
were supposed to get and they're going

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.160 
were supposed to get and they're going
to<00:01:50.670> give<00:01:50.850> it<00:01:51.000> to<00:01:51.119> us<00:01:51.240> soon<00:01:51.570> maybe<00:01:51.899> it's<00:01:52.079> the

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
to give it to us soon maybe it's the

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.990 
to give it to us soon maybe it's the
next<00:01:52.439> map<00:01:52.619> maybe<00:01:52.890> my<00:01:53.189> other<00:01:53.340> video<00:01:53.610> was<00:01:53.820> wrong

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
next map maybe my other video was wrong

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.370 
next map maybe my other video was wrong
maybe<00:01:54.149> that's<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.630> next<00:01:54.659> map<00:01:55.020> and<00:01:55.229> what's

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
maybe that's the next map and what's

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.310 
maybe that's the next map and what's
going<00:01:55.530> to<00:01:55.560> happen<00:01:56.630> maybe<00:01:57.630> that's<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:58.079> like

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
going to happen maybe that's the like

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.810 
going to happen maybe that's the like
the<00:01:58.409> other<00:01:58.590> left<00:01:58.860> side<00:01:59.100> of<00:01:59.280> it<00:01:59.430> in<00:01:59.549> the<00:01:59.640> right

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
the other left side of it in the right

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.679 
the other left side of it in the right
side<00:02:00.119> is<00:02:01.040> the<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.579> schematic<00:02:03.119> that<00:02:03.149> I<00:02:03.299> had<00:02:03.540> in

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
side is the the schematic that I had in

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.209 
side is the the schematic that I had in
the<00:02:03.719> other<00:02:03.990> video<00:02:04.290> but<00:02:04.500> anyways<00:02:04.799> maybe<00:02:04.979> we're

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
the other video but anyways maybe we're

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.280 
the other video but anyways maybe we're
going<00:02:05.340> to<00:02:05.399> go<00:02:05.490> back<00:02:05.700> in<00:02:05.939> time<00:02:06.180> to<00:02:06.840> before<00:02:06.869> all

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
going to go back in time to before all

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.820 
going to go back in time to before all
these<00:02:07.439> maps<00:02:07.710> happened<00:02:08.250> so<00:02:08.849> maybe<00:02:09.830> before

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
these maps happened so maybe before

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.100 
these maps happened so maybe before
shangri-la<00:02:11.400> before<00:02:11.730> moon<00:02:11.910> before<00:02:12.120> all<00:02:12.660> these

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
shangri-la before moon before all these

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.820 
shangri-la before moon before all these
maps

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
maps

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.030 
maps
so<00:02:14.690> that's<00:02:15.690> a<00:02:15.840> kind<00:02:16.050> of<00:02:16.170> a<00:02:16.260> different<00:02:16.560> theory

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
so that's a kind of a different theory

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.100 
so that's a kind of a different theory
there<00:02:17.400> um<00:02:17.700> I<00:02:18.000> don't<00:02:18.420> know<00:02:18.600> let<00:02:18.810> me<00:02:18.840> know<00:02:18.900> what

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
there um I don't know let me know what

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.530 
there um I don't know let me know what
you<00:02:19.200> guys<00:02:19.350> think<00:02:19.710> if<00:02:20.010> if<00:02:20.520> you<00:02:20.700> think<00:02:20.970> it<00:02:21.060> has

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
you guys think if if you think it has

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.000 
you guys think if if you think it has
some<00:02:21.750> meaning<00:02:21.900> to<00:02:22.050> it<00:02:22.170> if<00:02:22.380> you<00:02:22.500> can<00:02:22.650> read<00:02:22.860> any

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
some meaning to it if you can read any

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.380 
some meaning to it if you can read any
of<00:02:23.070> this<00:02:23.160> stuff<00:02:23.280> on<00:02:23.580> it<00:02:23.610> looks<00:02:24.030> like<00:02:24.180> there's

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
of this stuff on it looks like there's

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.350 
of this stuff on it looks like there's
one<00:02:24.510> part<00:02:24.780> words<00:02:24.960> like<00:02:25.260> has<00:02:25.530> like<00:02:25.770> UN<00:02:26.400> for<00:02:27.180> let

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
one part words like has like UN for let

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.140 
one part words like has like UN for let
me<00:02:27.450> be<00:02:27.570> undead<00:02:28.050> or<00:02:28.260> something<00:02:29.220> like<00:02:29.370> that<00:02:29.460> so<00:02:29.610> I

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
me be undead or something like that so I

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.430 
me be undead or something like that so I
don't<00:02:30.540> know<00:02:30.600> just<00:02:30.750> let<00:02:30.960> me<00:02:31.050> know<00:02:31.170> what<00:02:31.320> you

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
don't know just let me know what you

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.080 
don't know just let me know what you
guys<00:02:31.560> think<00:02:31.860> if<00:02:32.070> you<00:02:32.160> can<00:02:32.340> actually<00:02:32.760> get<00:02:32.880> that

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
guys think if you can actually get that

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.600 
guys think if you can actually get that
picture<00:02:33.330> and<00:02:33.510> zoom<00:02:33.930> in<00:02:34.530> see<00:02:35.130> anything<00:02:35.430> that<00:02:35.580> I

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
picture and zoom in see anything that I

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.460 
picture and zoom in see anything that I
haven't<00:02:35.790> seen<00:02:36.030> send<00:02:36.600> me<00:02:36.720> a<00:02:36.750> message<00:02:37.080> leave<00:02:37.200> a

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
haven't seen send me a message leave a

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.500 
haven't seen send me a message leave a
comment<00:02:37.950> I<00:02:38.100> will<00:02:38.550> check<00:02:38.850> out<00:02:39.030> whatever<00:02:39.240> you

that's<00:02:44.730> a<00:02:44.880> little<00:02:45.030> bit<00:02:45.180> of<00:02:45.330> a<00:02:45.360> theory<00:02:45.720> thing

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 
that's a little bit of a theory thing

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:47.240 
that's a little bit of a theory thing
that<00:02:46.170> no<00:02:46.290> one<00:02:46.320> really<00:02:46.650> has<00:02:46.770> ever<00:02:46.950> seen<00:02:47.220> before

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
that no one really has ever seen before

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.220 
that no one really has ever seen before
if<00:02:47.850> there<00:02:48.000> is<00:02:48.090> a<00:02:48.120> video<00:02:48.330> on<00:02:48.480> it<00:02:48.720> I<00:02:48.810> haven't<00:02:49.020> seen

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
if there is a video on it I haven't seen

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.860 
if there is a video on it I haven't seen
it<00:02:49.410> but<00:02:49.560> um<00:02:50.160> but<00:02:50.400> yeah<00:02:51.390> these<00:02:51.540> are<00:02:51.600> just<00:02:51.780> my
