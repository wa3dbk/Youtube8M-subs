00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.100
 what else did you manage 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:24.109
 team game vsevolod 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:27.109
 principle did not let me create zenith 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:30.369
 one that just coins due to this 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:32.239
 personally for you it is very important 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:35.960
 always nice to win 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:38.360
 some kind of sitting another block club game and 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:41.000
 can claim to knees together 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.589
 building scared now what there torpedoes 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.030
 who will say can not can we 

00:00:42.589 --> 00:00:51.409
 we will play in each group victory 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:52.400
 then you have to look today and say that 

00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:55.420
 we sat down on defense 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:01:02.059
 played we played the score scored 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:14.090
 controlled the course of the game allowed to think and 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:25.009
 today the question is how it requires ps 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:28.009
 forgiveness was not at all played until the end 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:30.320
 everyone thought they had already won by 10 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:36.200
 minutes could miss and 2 and 3 so this 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:39.590
 the fight is so you think we are right 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:41.539
 I think that it seemed so tell 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.500
 honest memory give him a very phrase 

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:48.660
 about cute apples 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:53.460
 decrease say so would you 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:53.460
 my business portals say there 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.660
 provocative questions here two years 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.240
 contrast 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:05.650
 quite managed to talk pumped 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:09.100
 copying will not be wonderful 5 8 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:10.750
 relationship on the field of principle today he 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:14.350
 played in language for red yes what can 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:18.040
 be our rival mode no no 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:26.770
 managed to throw up better 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:28.420
 what physically form a team at first 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:31.450
 everything is already 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.410
 stumbled enough at the beginning already 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.500
 there was nowhere to retreat 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.700
 Setup likely limitations on 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.460
 readiness we did not have and at the beginning 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:43.540
 the problem just might not have succeeded 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:59.380
 so play today the Russian team 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:03:01.770
 10 Russian have changed wonderful one 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.770
 foreign
