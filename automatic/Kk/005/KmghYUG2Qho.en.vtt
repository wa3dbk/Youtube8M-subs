tour<00:00:46.410> it's<00:00:47.160> called<00:00:47.489> surface<00:00:47.879> computing<00:00:48.690> and

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
tour it's called surface computing and

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.779 
tour it's called surface computing and
you<00:00:48.899> can<00:00:49.110> do<00:00:49.289> it<00:00:49.440> without<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:49.980> interface<00:00:50.489> of<00:00:50.520> a

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
you can do it without the interface of a

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.889 
you can do it without the interface of a
mouse<00:00:51.000> so<00:00:51.239> the<00:00:51.539> object<00:00:51.899> recognition<00:00:53.899> how

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
mouse so the object recognition how

credit card divvy up the bill add in the
tip<00:01:07.590> and<00:01:07.890> leave<00:01:08.780> under<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:09.810> screen<00:01:10.229> are

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
tip and leave under the screen are

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.140 
tip and leave under the screen are
cameras<00:01:10.979> that<00:01:11.010> can<00:01:11.280> actually<00:01:11.640> see<00:01:11.939> what

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
cameras that can actually see what

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.460 
cameras that can actually see what
you're<00:01:12.299> touching<00:01:12.750> and<00:01:12.900> then<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.080> computer

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
you're touching and then the computer

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.340 
you're touching and then the computer
reacts<00:01:13.950> creating<00:01:14.640> an<00:01:14.729> image<00:01:15.140> there<00:01:16.140> you<00:01:16.229> go

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
reacts creating an image there you go

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.499 
reacts creating an image there you go
and<00:01:16.979> again<00:01:17.250> you<00:01:17.700> just<00:01:17.820> put<00:01:17.939> it<00:01:18.030> down<00:01:18.119> here<00:01:18.180> and

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
and again you just put it down here and

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.020 
and again you just put it down here and
it<00:01:19.020> spills<00:01:19.229> out<00:01:19.380> photos<00:01:19.920> not<00:01:20.280> a<00:01:20.340> prompt<00:01:20.759> see

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
it spills out photos not a prompt see

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.999 
it spills out photos not a prompt see
it's<00:01:21.390> like<00:01:21.630> they're<00:01:21.810> magically<00:01:22.380> drawn<00:01:22.650> out<00:01:22.860> of

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
it's like they're magically drawn out of

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.910 
it's like they're magically drawn out of
your<00:01:23.130> digital<00:01:23.549> camera<00:01:24.030> into<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.420> box

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920 
your digital camera into the box

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.320 
your digital camera into the box
wirelessly<00:01:25.920> of<00:01:26.159> course<00:01:26.460> so<00:01:26.759> now<00:01:26.939> you<00:01:27.000> can<00:01:27.180> grab

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
wirelessly of course so now you can grab

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.319 
wirelessly of course so now you can grab
photos<00:01:27.750> and<00:01:28.110> I<00:01:28.229> grab<00:01:28.439> photos<00:01:28.770> and<00:01:28.979> we<00:01:29.070> can

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:29.329 
photos and I grab photos and we can

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:33.140 
photos and I grab photos and we can
configure<00:01:30.329> a<00:01:30.650> white<00:01:31.650> table<00:01:32.130> in<00:01:32.250> this<00:01:32.430> case<00:01:32.700> in

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
configure a white table in this case in

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.999 
configure a white table in this case in
this<00:01:33.329> case<00:01:33.570> it<00:01:33.750> is<00:01:33.900> and<00:01:34.170> so<00:01:34.290> we've<00:01:34.470> used<00:01:34.710> those

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
this case it is and so we've used those

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.499 
this case it is and so we've used those
different<00:01:35.369> attributes<00:01:35.880> of<00:01:36.119> surface

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
different attributes of surface
