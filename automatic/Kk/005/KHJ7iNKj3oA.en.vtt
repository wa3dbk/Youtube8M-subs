00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
rubbish so I saw this on the web and I

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:21.769 
rubbish so I saw this on the web and I
could<00:00:20.490> see<00:00:20.640> that<00:00:20.820> it's<00:00:20.970> got<00:00:21.000> a<00:00:21.119> lined<00:00:21.390> hood<00:00:21.630> and

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
could see that it's got a lined hood and

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.230 
could see that it's got a lined hood and
that's<00:00:21.930> why<00:00:22.050> i<00:00:22.080> bought<00:00:22.320> it<00:00:22.560> i<00:00:22.740> mean<00:00:23.430> it's<00:00:23.760> it's

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
that's why i bought it i mean it's it's

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.800 
that's why i bought it i mean it's it's
quite<00:00:24.810> thick<00:00:25.369> why<00:00:26.369> it's<00:00:26.640> got<00:00:26.820> three<00:00:27.240> ways<00:00:27.570> of

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
quite thick why it's got three ways of

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.870 
quite thick why it's got three ways of
closing<00:00:28.019> it<00:00:28.380> all<00:00:28.619> sewn<00:00:29.039> together<00:00:29.250> in<00:00:29.490> one<00:00:29.699> i

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
closing it all sewn together in one i

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.519 
closing it all sewn together in one i
assume<00:00:30.210> that<00:00:30.269> some<00:00:30.599> sort<00:00:30.750> of<00:00:30.840> fashion<00:00:31.170> Satan

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
assume that some sort of fashion Satan

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.479 
assume that some sort of fashion Satan
but<00:00:32.510> so<00:00:33.510> this<00:00:33.660> it's<00:00:33.899> over-engineered<00:00:34.489> it's

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
but so this it's over-engineered it's

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.280 
but so this it's over-engineered it's
nonsense<00:00:35.940> I<00:00:36.149> guess<00:00:36.600> that's<00:00:36.719> fashion<00:00:37.079> so<00:00:37.200> it

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
nonsense I guess that's fashion so it

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.270 
nonsense I guess that's fashion so it
looks<00:00:37.440> as<00:00:37.559> though<00:00:37.590> you<00:00:37.710> got<00:00:37.890> one<00:00:38.070> hoodie

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
inside another which might be a

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.830 

wow<00:01:24.590> it<00:01:25.590> is<00:01:25.860> incredibly<00:01:26.460> salty<00:01:26.840> unbelievably

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
wow it is incredibly salty unbelievably

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:42.190 
wow it is incredibly salty unbelievably
salting<00:01:31.010> which<00:01:32.010> I<00:01:32.190> suppose<00:01:32.550> is<00:01:32.940> what<00:01:33.030> that

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.410 

which<00:01:43.200> I<00:01:43.350> suppose<00:01:43.650> is<00:01:43.950> where<00:01:44.190> the<00:01:44.370> salt<00:01:44.970> them

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
which I suppose is where the salt them

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.960 
which I suppose is where the salt them
with<00:01:45.750> what<00:01:45.900> its<00:01:46.110> own<00:01:46.460> so<00:01:47.460> it<00:01:47.580> doesn't<00:01:47.880> actually

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
with what its own so it doesn't actually

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.550 
with what its own so it doesn't actually
say<00:01:48.330> salt<00:01:48.750> what<00:01:49.140> it<00:01:49.290> says<00:01:49.560> is<00:01:51.290> chicken<00:01:52.290> gravy

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
say salt what it says is chicken gravy

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.460 
say salt what it says is chicken gravy
mix<00:01:53.010> now<00:01:53.400> I<00:01:53.430> don't<00:01:53.760> know<00:01:54.000> what<00:01:54.150> that<00:01:54.180> means<00:01:54.510> so

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
mix now I don't know what that means so

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.140 
mix now I don't know what that means so
this<00:01:55.620> is<00:01:55.650> mostly<00:01:56.100> rice<00:01:56.370> and<00:01:56.700> chicken<00:01:56.910> gravy

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:57.150 
this is mostly rice and chicken gravy

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:06.050 
this is mostly rice and chicken gravy
mix<00:01:58.760> okay<00:01:59.760> I<00:02:04.280> think<00:02:05.280> you<00:02:05.490> can<00:02:05.640> assume<00:02:05.850> though

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
mix okay I think you can assume though

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.430 
mix okay I think you can assume though
the<00:02:06.270> chickens<00:02:06.660> that<00:02:06.780> came<00:02:06.960> from<00:02:07.110> we're<00:02:07.320> not

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:07.440 
the chickens that came from we're not

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:13.260 
the chickens that came from we're not
happy<00:02:07.619> chickens<00:02:08.130> they<00:02:08.760> well<00:02:08.970> sorted<00:02:09.420> chickens

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.940 

but<00:02:14.270> it<00:02:14.390> has<00:02:14.570> mixed<00:02:14.870> up<00:02:15.080> quite<00:02:15.320> well<00:02:15.350> doing<00:02:15.830> it

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
but it has mixed up quite well doing it

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.850 
but it has mixed up quite well doing it
that<00:02:16.070> way<00:02:16.100> in<00:02:16.580> the<00:02:16.640> cup<00:02:16.970> I<00:02:17.680> mean<00:02:18.680> it<00:02:18.740> might

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
that way in the cup I mean it might

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.590 
that way in the cup I mean it might
taste<00:02:19.100> so<00:02:19.280> strong<00:02:19.580> maybe<00:02:20.150> it<00:02:20.270> could<00:02:20.390> do<00:02:20.480> it

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:20.600 
taste so strong maybe it could do it

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:29.630 
taste so strong maybe it could do it
being<00:02:20.810> pinned<00:02:21.050> a<00:02:21.170> bit<00:02:22.450> driver

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.920 

so<00:02:30.640> I've<00:02:30.849> diluted<00:02:31.450> it<00:02:32.939> it's<00:02:33.939> probably<00:02:34.239> a<00:02:34.569> conf

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
so I've diluted it it's probably a conf

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:42.629 
so I've diluted it it's probably a conf
again<00:02:35.200> as<00:02:35.319> dilute<00:02:35.680> as<00:02:35.829> it<00:02:36.010> should<00:02:36.549> be<00:02:36.760> a<00:02:41.639> nice

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:42.639 
again as dilute as it should be a nice

00:02:42.639 --> 00:02:49.010 
again as dilute as it should be a nice
that's<00:02:42.879> pretty<00:02:43.120> good<00:02:43.209> soup

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:03:00.600 

you

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:08.840
