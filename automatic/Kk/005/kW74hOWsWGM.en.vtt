00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
we're going to reboot now let's see if

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:11.960 
we're going to reboot now let's see if
it<00:03:10.079> actually<00:03:10.109> does<00:03:10.470> it<00:03:10.799> good<00:03:11.099> and<00:03:11.310> then<00:03:11.849> what

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
it actually does it good and then what

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:12.890 
it actually does it good and then what
we're<00:03:12.060> gonna<00:03:12.150> do<00:03:12.359> is<00:03:12.480> we're<00:03:12.569> going<00:03:12.660> to<00:03:12.720> take

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
we're gonna do is we're going to take

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.920 
we're gonna do is we're going to take
our<00:03:13.019> t-mobile<00:03:13.379> SIM<00:03:14.209> once<00:03:15.209> this<00:03:15.359> thing<00:03:15.569> reboots

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
our t-mobile SIM once this thing reboots

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:17.210 
our t-mobile SIM once this thing reboots
completely<00:03:16.410> and<00:03:16.590> we're<00:03:16.829> gonna<00:03:16.920> slide<00:03:17.190> a

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
completely and we're gonna slide a

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.180 
completely and we're gonna slide a
t-mobile<00:03:17.459> SIM<00:03:17.819> card<00:03:18.030> into<00:03:18.180> it<00:03:18.829> which<00:03:19.829> we<00:03:20.010> have

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
t-mobile SIM card into it which we have

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:29.080 
t-mobile SIM card into it which we have
here<00:03:20.549> and<00:03:21.180> we're<00:03:21.329> going<00:03:21.450> to<00:03:21.540> see<00:03:21.630> if<00:03:21.720> it<00:03:21.780> works

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.460 

you<00:03:30.090> want<00:03:30.209> to<00:03:30.299> let<00:03:30.419> it<00:03:30.450> boot<00:03:30.720> even<00:03:31.019> without<00:03:31.440> a

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
you want to let it boot even without a

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.440 
you want to let it boot even without a
SIM<00:03:31.709> card<00:03:31.739> in<00:03:32.040> it<00:03:32.130> so<00:03:32.340> it<00:03:32.459> can<00:03:32.609> actually<00:03:33.299> get

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
SIM card in it so it can actually get

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.229 
SIM card in it so it can actually get
its<00:03:33.599> kernel<00:03:34.019> and<00:03:34.200> the<00:03:34.859> respective<00:03:35.549> modem<00:03:35.940> set

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 
its kernel and the respective modem set

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:38.930 
its kernel and the respective modem set
so<00:03:36.419> you<00:03:36.510> see<00:03:36.690> it<00:03:36.750> says<00:03:36.870> no<00:03:37.109> sim<00:03:37.380> that's<00:03:38.190> okay

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
so you see it says no sim that's okay

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.059 
so you see it says no sim that's okay
we're<00:03:39.389> going<00:03:39.510> to<00:03:39.569> let<00:03:39.690> that<00:03:39.840> sit<00:03:40.139> for<00:03:40.349> a<00:03:40.650> second

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:41.069
