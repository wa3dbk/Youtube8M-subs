00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
event one doesn't really do much but as

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.449

you<00:03:20.139> can<00:03:20.260> see<00:03:20.440> when<00:03:20.590> i<00:03:20.620> get<00:03:20.739> to<00:03:20.980> event<00:03:21.190> one

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 
you can see when i get to event one

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:24.780 
you can see when i get to event one
event<00:03:22.030> 0<00:03:22.299> will<00:03:22.480> be<00:03:22.600> passed<00:03:22.870> so<00:03:23.200> this<00:03:23.519> tile<00:03:24.519> will

the up and down arrow keys and it works
and<00:03:52.480> we<00:03:52.599> find<00:03:52.870> a<00:03:53.019> different<00:03:55.859> animation<00:03:56.859> tiles

00:03:57.089 --> 00:03:57.099 
and we find a different animation tiles

00:03:57.099 --> 00:04:02.690 
and we find a different animation tiles
that<00:03:57.220> we<00:03:57.400> can<00:03:57.519> use<00:03:57.549> oh<00:03:57.940> my<00:03:58.450> freaking<00:03:59.079> God

notice that this level tile here is

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:43.800 
notice that this level tile here is
revealed<00:05:41.820> now<00:05:42.820> in<00:05:42.940> disappear<00:05:43.240> again<00:05:43.360> because

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:43.810 
revealed now in disappear again because

we're not in an event frame and check

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:50.460 
we're not in an event frame and check
this<00:05:46.390> this<00:05:46.840> trigger<00:05:47.260> 70<00:05:49.020> so<00:05:50.020> we<00:05:50.140> save<00:05:50.440> our

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:50.470 
this this trigger 70 so we save our

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:55.659 
this this trigger 70 so we save our
overall<00:05:50.860> to<00:05:51.010> rom<00:05:51.160> and<00:05:52.170> that's<00:05:53.170> that

00:05:55.659 --> 00:05:55.669 

00:05:55.669 --> 00:05:58.429 

now<00:05:56.669> let's<00:05:56.879> say<00:05:57.059> for<00:05:57.240> example<00:05:57.270> that<00:05:57.719> if<00:05:58.229> you

00:05:58.429 --> 00:05:58.439 
now let's say for example that if you

00:05:58.439 --> 00:06:01.670 
now let's say for example that if you
open<00:05:58.860> this<00:05:58.889> path<00:05:59.460> button<00:05:59.879> right<00:06:00.029> here<00:06:00.059> and<00:06:00.680> the

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:01.680 
open this path button right here and the

open this path button right here and the
path<00:06:02.129> tiles<00:06:02.550> that<00:06:02.729> you<00:06:02.879> want<00:06:03.029> to<00:06:03.059> use<00:06:03.240> in<00:06:03.389> your

you<00:06:37.919> can<00:06:37.949> actually<00:06:38.400> go<00:06:38.550> in<00:06:38.699> and<00:06:38.969> manipulate

00:06:39.589 --> 00:06:39.599 
you can actually go in and manipulate

00:06:39.599 --> 00:06:41.959 
you can actually go in and manipulate
them<00:06:39.810> however<00:06:40.409> you<00:06:40.680> want<00:06:40.740> and<00:06:41.279> those<00:06:41.520> changes

00:06:41.959 --> 00:06:41.969 
them however you want and those changes

00:06:41.969 --> 00:06:46.249 
them however you want and those changes
will<00:06:42.089> actually<00:06:42.479> appear<00:06:42.629> in<00:06:43.050> this<00:06:43.620> window<00:06:45.259> so

00:06:46.249 --> 00:06:46.259 
will actually appear in this window so

00:06:46.259 --> 00:06:47.300 
will actually appear in this window so
that's<00:06:46.409> something<00:06:46.620> you<00:06:46.830> might<00:06:46.949> want<00:06:47.129> to<00:06:47.189> try

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:47.310 
that's something you might want to try

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:48.920 
that's something you might want to try
if<00:06:47.639> you<00:06:47.759> don't<00:06:47.909> find<00:06:48.120> what<00:06:48.270> you<00:06:48.419> need<00:06:48.569> in<00:06:48.749> there

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:48.930 
if you don't find what you need in there

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:52.969 
if you don't find what you need in there
but<00:06:49.740> note<00:06:49.979> that<00:06:50.360> if<00:06:51.360> you<00:06:51.810> change<00:06:52.110> one<00:06:52.469> of<00:06:52.860> these

00:06:52.969 --> 00:06:52.979 
but note that if you change one of these

00:06:52.979 --> 00:06:55.790 
but note that if you change one of these
frames<00:06:53.339> they<00:06:54.120> will<00:06:54.300> change<00:06:54.569> for<00:06:54.930> all<00:06:55.050> the

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:55.800 
frames they will change for all the

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:58.929 
frames they will change for all the
animations<00:06:56.189> that<00:06:56.610> use<00:06:56.969> that<00:06:57.240> specific<00:06:57.870> frame

00:06:58.929 --> 00:06:58.939 
animations that use that specific frame

00:06:58.939 --> 00:07:08.740 
animations that use that specific frame
very<00:06:59.939> important<00:07:00.629> to<00:07:00.719> be<00:07:00.810> aware<00:07:00.839> of<00:07:01.110> that

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:08.750 

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:10.790

ok so I just want to quickly show you

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:14.090 
ok so I just want to quickly show you
guys<00:07:11.100> how<00:07:11.220> it<00:07:11.490> works<00:07:11.700> and<00:07:12.590> almost<00:07:13.590> like<00:07:13.800> to<00:07:13.920> cut

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:14.100 
guys how it works and almost like to cut

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:15.200 
guys how it works and almost like to cut
out<00:07:14.190> the<00:07:14.340> level<00:07:14.610> because<00:07:14.790> I<00:07:14.880> don't<00:07:15.030> want

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:15.210 
out the level because I don't want

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:17.180 
out the level because I don't want
anyone<00:07:15.510> to<00:07:15.660> see<00:07:15.750> it<00:07:15.780> until<00:07:16.070> everything<00:07:17.070> is

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:17.190 
anyone to see it until everything is

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:19.520 
anyone to see it until everything is
completely<00:07:17.580> finished<00:07:17.790> so<00:07:18.270> it<00:07:18.570> might<00:07:18.810> change

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:19.530 
completely finished so it might change

00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:21.770 
completely finished so it might change
actually<00:07:20.130> i'm<00:07:20.340> not<00:07:20.400> going<00:07:20.610> to<00:07:20.640> show<00:07:20.700> it<00:07:20.790> most

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:21.780 
actually i'm not going to show it most

00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:24.710 
actually i'm not going to show it most
likely<00:07:21.990> just<00:07:22.170> cut<00:07:22.380> it<00:07:22.470> out<00:07:23.450> but<00:07:24.450> i<00:07:24.480> want<00:07:24.690> to

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:24.720 
likely just cut it out but i want to

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:26.120 
likely just cut it out but i want to
show<00:07:24.900> you<00:07:24.930> the<00:07:25.170> ending<00:07:25.440> and<00:07:25.560> i<00:07:25.680> will<00:07:25.830> show<00:07:26.070> you

show you the ending and i will show you
that<00:07:26.250> the<00:07:26.810> animation<00:07:27.810> tiles<00:07:28.050> work<00:07:28.410> as<00:07:28.770> they

00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:28.980 
that the animation tiles work as they

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:34.430 
that the animation tiles work as they
should<00:07:32.030> ok<00:07:33.030> so<00:07:33.090> here<00:07:33.360> we<00:07:33.510> are<00:07:33.660> at<00:07:33.750> the<00:07:33.840> end<00:07:33.930> and

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:34.440 
should ok so here we are at the end and

00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:50.650 
and now we shall see that the animation
works<00:07:48.760> perfect<00:07:49.760> sound<00:07:50.210> effects<00:07:50.540> and
