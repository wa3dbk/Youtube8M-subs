00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:12.980
 equal to everyone the demanded and 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:15.889
 welcome to a very important video 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:18.619
 because I'm finally going to upload guides 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:20.630
 ps3 released on my secondary channel like this 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:23.149
 what will you have in the description of 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:25.220
 this video I have uploaded the video then 

00:00:23.149 --> 00:00:26.720
 presentation and a presentation 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.340
 presentation would be this but here I have 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.410
 uploaded so to speak also a video 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:32.480
 of presentation is different from this one but 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:36.230
 the difference is that he explained there 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:38.570
 then on the released ps3 what is it 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.370
 what it does and everything basic pretty basic 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.199
 I do not explain everything there all because 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.239
 It is not that I know much about the subject but 

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:46.550
 I know the basics and the most important thing for 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:49.070
 to be able to do all of them do 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:51.230
 everything most important and I think it's going to 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:54.350
 Serve enough for people who have 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:56.960
 a ps3 of recently a ps3 released or 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:59.059
 pirated as you want to call and for 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.739
 the people who plan to buy the 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:03.289
 and do not know the truth that I recommend 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:04.820
 but it's pretty messy if you do not know about 

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:06.740
 that's why I'm going to upload those tutorials 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:09.140
 so you can see more or less what would 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.700
 what to do every time we use some 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.860
 thing we want to put a 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.869
 use one thing or another and I'll try 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:18.200
 explain it in the best way 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:20.360
 easiest way several all these 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.369
 types of weird names like for example 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.409
 say I'm going to use a blue to make 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:25.990
 rtm I do not know I do not know how much there is a lot 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:28.189
 people who do not even know what a ps3 is 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.840
 pirated so if we tell you all this 

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:32.030
 kind of things he will not understand 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.979
 but instead a person who knows about 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.990
 issue because you already know what I'm 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:38.450
 talking and everything and good I have decided 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.399
 do this guide because a lot of people in the 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:43.250
 white video 2 east of the impressive 

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:44.750
 hack the moon menu and all this then 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.549
 Many people told me hey, I give to the 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.649
 the button to slash and slash 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:50.149
 I do not see the menu anymore and I have the 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:52.189
 same console that you do not know what is the 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:53.509
 same version and people do not realize 

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:55.159
 that what you have to have is a ps3 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:58.069
 freed looted as you want to call it 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:02:00.679
 and well, that made me quite funny 

00:01:58.069 --> 00:02:02.780
 and since I've decided to do this for 

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:04.459
 that you understand everything in the best way 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.140
 and well, the tutorials are 

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:09.890
 costing some do even though 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:12.019
 they occupy just barely 4 minutes 3 depends and 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.120
 It is very little that I explain but I prefer 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:15.950
 do it like that and quite neatly 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.360
 so that you understand everything at the first 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.370
 without having to explain 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.290
 a thousand things in the same video because a lot 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.390
 people who do not understand or patrÃ¡s the 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.800
 things and I would also be one of those 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.720
 because you see a seven minute video 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.910
 explaining twenty thousand things to me because I do not 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.340
 whole of nothing the truth is worth so I've 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:33.560
 decided to make things step by step 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.840
 Although they are short videos, because 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.060
 least I tried to throw everything away 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.490
 so that you know how to do it step by step like this 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.410
 that I will leave you on my secondary channel a 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:44.690
 guide or a playlist 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.160
 as we are seeing here and nothing else 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.470
 enter my secondary channel that you will have 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.959
 in the description as you enter there and more 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:53.000
 below you will find the list of 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:56.120
 reproduction that there is then I will be putting 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.489
 videos from the moment guide is only 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:01.190
 the presentation but tomorrow morning 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:03.080
 not because tomorrow it's a draw on the channel 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:04.790
 secondary 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:07.520
 I think the sixth or fifth and not me 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:11.060
 agreement is valid and touches the result and everything 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:13.100
 so after that I'll go up then the second 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:16.310
 chapter of the guide and as I say 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:17.989
 I will explain everything everything everything everything there is worth 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:20.630
 all the most important everything that is 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:22.580
 I will explain there for the people who 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:23.810
 he wants to get caught one 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:26.120
 recently 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:28.160
 to be guided at least something so you know 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:30.709
 do the basics that is the most important thing 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:32.930
 and it is what I use and as I said 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:35.330
 before then to be about 20 videos like this 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:37.790
 at the moment I have four engravings good 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:39.200
 commented and all assembled and then 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:42.260
 I have two more that I have already recorded 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:44.330
 but not commented and the rest I have 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.769
 still to be done but well I think that 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:48.349
 you will have daily video on the channel 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:50.630

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:52.880
