futuristic dark though I thought that

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:26.490 
futuristic dark though I thought that

Rebellion's fatigue or in areas that we
may<00:01:37.930> feel<00:01:38.140> uncomfortable<00:01:39.070> and<00:01:39.580> I<00:01:39.640> think

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
may feel uncomfortable and I think

may feel uncomfortable and I think
fashions<00:01:40.570> about<00:01:40.840> tension<00:01:41.350> and<00:01:41.800> if<00:01:41.890> you<00:01:41.979> don't

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130 
fashions about tension and if you don't

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:43.260 
fashions about tension and if you don't
create<00:01:42.460> that<00:01:42.670> kind<00:01:42.850> of<00:01:42.970> uncomfortable

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
create that kind of uncomfortable

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.020 
create that kind of uncomfortable
tension<00:01:44.140> that<00:01:44.740> maybe<00:01:44.979> we<00:01:45.220> haven't<00:01:45.429> really

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 
tension that maybe we haven't really

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:53.980 
tension that maybe we haven't really
gone<00:01:46.780> where<00:01:47.530> we<00:01:47.679> need<00:01:47.890> to<00:01:48.070> go

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.999 

admittedly<00:01:54.890> the<00:01:55.490> witchy<00:01:55.790> theme<00:01:56.689> was<00:01:57.649> fairly

00:01:57.999 --> 00:01:58.009 
admittedly the witchy theme was fairly

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:02.020 
admittedly the witchy theme was fairly
well<00:01:58.280> sublimated<00:01:59.119> by<00:01:59.890> McQueen's<00:02:01.030> usual

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
well sublimated by McQueen's usual

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.840 
well sublimated by McQueen's usual
preoccupations<00:02:02.840> which<00:02:03.020> are<00:02:03.259> cut<00:02:03.890> silhouette

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
preoccupations which are cut silhouette

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.270 
preoccupations which are cut silhouette
and<00:02:05.390> actually<00:02:06.200> just<00:02:06.350> the<00:02:06.470> plain<00:02:06.740> old<00:02:06.979> drama

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
and actually just the plain old drama

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.100 
and actually just the plain old drama
that<00:02:07.640> is<00:02:07.670> essential<00:02:08.270> to<00:02:08.300> everything<00:02:08.810> he<00:02:08.929> does

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
that is essential to everything he does

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.199 
that is essential to everything he does
is<00:02:09.739> the<00:02:09.920> grand<00:02:10.160> scheme<00:02:10.399> of<00:02:10.459> things<00:02:10.580> you<00:02:11.000> feel
