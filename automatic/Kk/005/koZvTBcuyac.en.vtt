00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:08.010
 Hello everyone who watches this video in this 

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:11.139
 video i will tell how i do 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:15.660
 stabilized wood for handles 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:16.810
 and the fact of their knives is that their feet 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.390
 interested in 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:21.180
 what is generally stabilized 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:24.550
 wood stabilized wood 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:27.940
 it is generally wood impregnated 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:31.439
 a certain composition after impregnation 

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:35.860
 this composition wood acquires 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:39.280
 better properties than u like more 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:42.700
 protected comes from all sorts of external 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:45.940
 factors from moisture from the sun but also 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:46.870
 like it will melt more and more stronger 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:53.469
 more durable 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:56.910
 And now I will tell you how I do it myself. 

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:59.700
 at home the thing is that for 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:03.119
 manufactures are stabilized 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:06.670
 wood and not all wood fits 

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:09.159
 but well, in principle, I have not tried different 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:12.429
 trees oh different woods 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:15.069
 but I tried to do as they say 

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:18.999
 stabilized beech wood and 

00:01:15.069 --> 00:01:22.509
 birch as they say is the best 

00:01:18.999 --> 00:01:24.880
 material i consider to make to create 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:27.209
 stabilized wood but it 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:30.549
 epoxy coated grip 

00:01:27.209 --> 00:01:32.259
 but I just showed up for clarity 

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:35.349
 general to make stabilized 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:40.029
 handle for your knife in general take 

00:01:35.349 --> 00:01:45.399
 for example lateral for example or birch 

00:01:40.029 --> 00:01:46.689
 workpiece in general grind and most importantly 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:51.509
 so it was dry 

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:54.490
 and take this as they say glue 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:02:00.009
 This is Chinese super glue 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:02:03.880
 bottled it is liquid like some liquid 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:06.159
 like a little water and after that how are you all tag 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.140
 as they say things are done and found here 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:11.500
 such glue 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:13.160
 richly-profusely and impregnates the handle 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:17.600
 knife with this glue in general 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:18.740
 sparing no glue in general abundantly 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:22.730
 soaked 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:26.450
 pour all that glue 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:30.860
 imbibed the fact that the best 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:33.620
 generally by impregnation this tree is birch 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:37.370
 but god absorbs well but birch is still 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:39.710
 better and the fact is as they say 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:43.030
 super glue it penetrates everything 

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:47.150
 wood fibers completely through and 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:47.870
 as they say when you dry this 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:50.960
 wood 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:53.900
 after such impregnation it will turn out very 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:58.340
 solid and not be afraid there will be no 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:03:01.220
 moisture must be dried by the way such 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.230
 about twenty-four hours 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.670
 then 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:07.070
 machining there you 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:09.980
 it turns out simple stabilized 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:15.920
 wood home 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:19.459
 Chinese glue is worth it as they say no 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:23.660
 so expensive you can even take a small 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:28.060
 a jar as they say 10 of these bottles 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:29.890
 pour out and generally give soak somewhere 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.600
 an hour and a half 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:34.910
 get an even better result possible 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:37.640
 even more other tree species 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:39.560
 use generally so simple 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:42.380
 a way i found how to do 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:44.239
 stabilized wood thank you all
