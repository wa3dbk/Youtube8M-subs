00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.840
 this edge that is the one that I'm going to 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:21.300
 show the bottom of this edge 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:23.130
 it serves for example for a quilt and 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.790
 then they make the bedspread here for 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:33.030
 I made the sample with some 

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:35.640
 needles that are 6.5 millimeters or the 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:39.090
 equivalent to a 10 and a half needle 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:42.839
 American wool is rather thick 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:48.290
 here here is 11 points 

00:00:42.839 --> 00:00:48.290
 so I have 22 points because I did 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:58.170
 two samples here 11 points and from here 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:01:01.260
 for here 11 points mount the 22 points and 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.980
 then start the stitch of the 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.980
 next way 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:10.619
 5 points to the right 1 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.619
 two 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:24.270
 45 points to the right one loop four 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:24.270
 points to the right 1 2 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:31.130
 four points to the right and one 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:34.550
 simple decrease that is spent a point 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:37.760
 he left a point 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:39.170
 of I go back to the nonwoven point on the 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:43.910
 weaving point that is the decrease 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:48.020
 simple and there ends the first bit 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:51.670
 the first reason again 5 points at 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.670
 right 2 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:02:01.640
 45 points to the right one loop four 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.300
 rights 1 2 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.510
 3 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:09.330
 four points to the right a decrease 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:12.110
 simple step a point this point that happened 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:16.950
 I have to take it inside the point 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:20.700
 He passed a point he left a point and I return 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:24.110
 the non-woven on the knitted stitch and there 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:26.930
 I finished the design 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:29.450
 all the races from the back side 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:32.480
 go in reverse point we start the third 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:37.760
 race as we initiate two points 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:39.940
 together in a right point three rights 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:45.830
 one 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:49.720
 23 rights point right a loop a 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:49.720
 right and a loop 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.390
 three points to the right 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:05.010
 He passed a point he left a point and I return 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:07.280
 the non-woven on the fabric and there 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.830
 finished 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:12.680
 the first design should be counting 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:15.080
 the points permanently so that 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.610
 they are going to damage the tissue I repeat 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:19.900
 again 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:19.900
 two photos together 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:24.670
 has a right point 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:29.719
 three rights one 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:36.530
 23 points to the right a loop a 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:41.620
 straight 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:47.230
 a loop three rights one two three 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:49.730
 rights and step a point left a point 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:52.250
 I return the nonwoven on the fabric or 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:54.739
 be a simple decrease next 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:58.790
 race number four on the wrong side 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:04:01.459
 all in reverse point in the race 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:04.989
 number five how are we going to do two 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:04.989
 points together to the right 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:10.600
 two rights 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:19.030
 a loop 

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:21.040
 a right a lazada step a point you 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:23.770
 I leave a point or a decrease 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:29.880
 simple return the fabric on the 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:29.880
 knitted stitch a tie two rights 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:37.580
 step a point left a nonwoven point 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.580
 on the tissue 

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:45.630
 and I repeat it again 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:48.920
 two points together 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:48.920
 in right point 

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:55.560
 rights 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:06.430
 a loop a right a loop a 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:10.750
 point left a point I return the no 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:14.520
 woven on the knitted stitch a loop 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:14.520
 two rights 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:23.040
 and I end up with the simple step decrease 

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:25.350
 I leave the right and back just 

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:28.260
 finish on the wrong side the 

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:30.630
 race number 6 and we move towards the 

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:34.470
 race number 7 on the right side 

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:37.700
 how do I start two points together 

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:37.700
 in right point 

00:05:39.169 --> 00:05:46.759
 a right a lasso twice or is it going 

00:05:43.129 --> 00:05:49.729
 one a right one lazada were two 

00:05:46.759 --> 00:05:53.479
 sometimes not and now I do 

00:05:49.729 --> 00:05:57.070
 twice a simple decrease step one 

00:05:53.479 --> 00:06:00.870
 point left a point 

00:05:57.070 --> 00:06:05.640
 I return it and make a loop 

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:09.270
 passed a point left a point and what 

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:15.570
 I return and I make a loop only we did 

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:19.980
 where is a right passed a point left 

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:21.390
 one point I return it and that's where the 

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:23.340
 design 

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:26.100
 the next race that is the eighth 

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:27.960
 all in reverse points we continue with the 

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:31.320
 career number nine 

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:35.180
 we started the race with two points 

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:39.759
 together to the right 

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:45.430
 we continue with a loop a right 

00:06:39.759 --> 00:06:45.430
 a loop a simple decrease 

00:06:48.030 --> 00:07:00.610
 a loop another simple decrease 

00:06:53.030 --> 00:07:05.690
 it happened yew I return a loop a right 

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:09.950
 a loop a simple decrease yew and 

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:12.230
 I return there already completely finished 

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:17.150
 first says the last race that is the 

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:18.630
 tenth and final obviously goes at a point 

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:22.230
 reverse 

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:23.920
 after being babies I did in 

00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:27.430
 this sample 

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:30.220
 in a jersey right by the right and the 

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:33.630
 reverse for the reverse record asia in my
