00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.819
 Good day to all I offer your 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.799
 re-review of charging from the company 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.809
 phoenix rc2 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.990
 why re because previous 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.910
 version we have for some reason 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:16.920
 some weird job after 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.260
 no charge hybrid element 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.369
 power supply 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:29.699
 today changed the charge on new and 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:31.320
 let's look like last time 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.140
 charging provided for review 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:41.040
 company flashlight equipment 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:43.160
 quite standard cord from 220 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.160
 volt 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:49.430
 instruction more and more we have nothing 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.430
 moreover 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:56.190
 charging keeps constantly in frame to 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:59.280
 nobody thought any dirty tricks 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:06.920
 I opened the packaging on video everything is fine 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:13.490
 see let's see we connect 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:15.150
 the plug is all the channels we have by zeros 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:21.270
 zealous battery 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:23.369
 phoenix incorrect polarity and 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.280
 Appearance features contact 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:31.619
 uniquely installed charging us nothing 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:35.939
 didn't say lithium charge started 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:39.840
 battery fund company flashlight we 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:41.579
 Charged March principle 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:49.200
 nickel metal hydride battery 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:52.290
 Reddit but also March exactly the same 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.899
 just a little bit from another battery 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.880
 build what we see bear charge 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:02:00.000
 batteries let's repeat the procedure 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.219
 pro from last time just rip 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.909
 chains and see how we will have 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:08.729
 respond charge see dropped 8 all 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:11.720
 fine fine 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:16.290
 battery name is also 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:18.319
 excellent start recharge lithium 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.319
 battery 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:30.569
 dropping again works itself therefore 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:33.510
 we can conclude that last time 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:36.980
 we had some kind of internal tank itself 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:40.470
 charger which by 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:43.049
 the end of the charge of the book metals prominent 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.540
 Battery Dallku is incomprehensible 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:47.430
 a mistake now and specially leave 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.840
 charger in this position 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:52.890
 video of course turn off to not 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:55.049
 stretch the viewing time and see 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.569
 the goats from the box office will beat when will end 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:59.790
 keep the battery cells down although they are 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:02.280
 actually full before that they were 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.230
 charged on usa charger int 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.090
 age2 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:09.930
 let's see what will change with us 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:15.889
 achieving full charge and how we 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:21.239
 will start the device next time 

00:03:15.889 --> 00:03:25.079
 there are two channels to break everything please 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:28.230
 normally works well to interrupt 

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:32.790
 our video and after a while I 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:36.510
 turn on again you can specifically put 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:45.599
 hours to see how much time will pass 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:47.489
 time bad wine so it will be better i 

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:51.019
 Now turn off the go whence it will include a look 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:53.190
 when it's over and so five minutes have passed 

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:56.370
 the end of the charge we only happened 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:58.230
 one channel as evidenced 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:01.310
 charge indicator which stands still 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:03.690
 and does not change its position 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:06.030
 The rest we see is still in the process of charging 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:06.959
 but they are already battles in it by 60 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:09.480
 percent 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:11.310
 here we see me a marvelous side 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:13.379
 the little screen is that it is not very informative 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:16.950
 There is no more clear percent 1 

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:17.920
 charge-to- citizen ratio 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:19.750
 battery 

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:21.640
 It would be perfect if at least 5 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:23.320
 segment charge indicator 

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:26.170
 let alone digital 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:30.370
 designation of charge percentage as in the same 

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:33.460
 charging us them let 's wait 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:39.300
 the end of the charge channel 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:46.620
 warta and after that we will say that 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:46.620
 previous time we had a single world 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:54.070
 again interrupt then the video will be 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:58.140
 glued into one and so we see that 

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:58.140
 pour it for us this container window recharged 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:03.430
 one and a half in the mouth 12 volt quart 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:04.740
 it also charged some 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:08.670
 metal hydride 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:10.960
 we can now shortage 

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:12.960
 try to install again let's see 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:15.700
 who we will see that everyone will allow 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:21.340
 for the sake of the purity of the experiment we confuse them 

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:24.340
 channels and see what of it 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:28.300
 it will turn out immediately identified cups 

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:30.250
 charged the rest is similarly that is 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:32.050
 previous case we had a clean 

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:34.720
 glitch of the charger itself 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:36.160
 warranty case this charger 

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:38.500
 device provided for review 

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:40.620
 company flashlight thank you all for 

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:40.620
 Attention
