00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
the performance parts and stuff on how

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.889 
the performance parts and stuff on how
to<00:01:50.369> actually<00:01:50.759> tune<00:01:51.030> it<00:01:51.240> so<00:01:51.479> like<00:01:51.630> do<00:01:51.750> the

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
to actually tune it so like do the

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.600 
to actually tune it so like do the
camera<00:01:52.259> on<00:01:52.350> the<00:01:52.439> wheels<00:01:52.619> get<00:01:52.920> the<00:01:53.040> right<00:01:53.250> like

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610

camera on the wheels get the right like
kind<00:01:54.149> of<00:01:54.240> camera<00:01:54.600> and<00:01:54.720> stuff<00:01:54.840> I<00:01:54.990> so<00:01:55.049> you<00:01:55.259> can

kind of camera and stuff I so you can
keep<00:01:55.560> it<00:01:55.710> drifting

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
keep it drifting

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.520 
keep it drifting
obviously<00:01:57.149> I<00:01:57.180> didn't<00:01:57.750> do<00:01:57.840> an<00:01:57.930> auto<00:01:58.110> upgrade

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
obviously I didn't do an auto upgrade

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.139 
obviously I didn't do an auto upgrade
because<00:01:58.649> I<00:01:58.979> am<00:01:59.100> pacifically<00:01:59.640> choosing

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
because I am pacifically choosing

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.709 
because I am pacifically choosing
certain<00:02:00.540> things<00:02:00.840> like<00:02:01.170> I<00:02:01.680> got<00:02:01.829> to<00:02:01.890> do<00:02:01.979> a

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:02.719 
certain things like I got to do a

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:07.069 
certain things like I got to do a
aspiration<00:02:04.369> my<00:02:05.369> aspiration<00:02:06.060> called<00:02:06.869> a<00:02:06.930> full

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
aspiration my aspiration called a full

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:10.010 
aspiration my aspiration called a full
of<00:02:07.170> the<00:02:07.259> word<00:02:07.700> some<00:02:08.700> modifications<00:02:09.539> sorry<00:02:09.840> the

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
of the word some modifications sorry the

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.400 
of the word some modifications sorry the
minute

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
minute

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.220 
minute
basically<00:02:11.370> changed<00:02:11.819> the<00:02:11.940> turbo

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
basically changed the turbo

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.330 
basically changed the turbo
and<00:02:13.349> we<00:02:14.069> do<00:02:14.220> that<00:02:14.459> so<00:02:15.110> for<00:02:16.110> wheels<00:02:16.379> tires<00:02:16.830> leave

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
and we do that so for wheels tires leave

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.430 
and we do that so for wheels tires leave
your<00:02:17.519> tires<00:02:17.819> standard<00:02:18.480> do<00:02:18.840> not<00:02:19.049> do<00:02:19.200> anything

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
your tires standard do not do anything

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.860 
your tires standard do not do anything
guitarist<00:02:19.950> nor<00:02:20.099> tire<00:02:20.340> with<00:02:20.610> rims<00:02:21.330> obviously

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
guitarist nor tire with rims obviously

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:22.789 
guitarist nor tire with rims obviously
you<00:02:21.930> can<00:02:22.049> choose<00:02:22.230> wherever<00:02:22.409> you<00:02:22.530> want

00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:22.799 
you can choose wherever you want

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:25.160 
you can choose wherever you want
I<00:02:22.890> went<00:02:23.459> with<00:02:23.640> these<00:02:24.060> nice<00:02:24.330> rims<00:02:24.629> here<00:02:24.870> the

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
I went with these nice rims here the

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.680 
I went with these nice rims here the
white<00:02:25.379> rims<00:02:25.680> are<00:02:25.980> six<00:02:26.760> spoke<00:02:27.060> I<00:02:27.330> reckon<00:02:27.599> they

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
white rims are six spoke I reckon they

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.259 
white rims are six spoke I reckon they
look<00:02:27.840> quite<00:02:28.049> nice<00:02:28.260> and<00:02:28.620> then<00:02:29.069> I<00:02:29.190> made<00:02:29.370> the<00:02:29.519> rims

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:30.269 
look quite nice and then I made the rims

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:32.210 
look quite nice and then I made the rims
18-inch<00:02:31.049> because<00:02:31.440> I<00:02:31.500> think<00:02:31.560> now<00:02:31.830> goes<00:02:32.010> really

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
18-inch because I think now goes really

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:33.110 
18-inch because I think now goes really
well<00:02:32.340> together

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
well together

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.089 
well together
so<00:02:33.390> as<00:02:33.660> for<00:02:33.870> rims<00:02:34.080> and<00:02:34.290> stuff<00:02:34.440> I<00:02:34.560> use<00:02:34.980> what

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:35.099 
so as for rims and stuff I use what

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:37.280 
so as for rims and stuff I use what
everyone<00:02:35.400> body<00:02:36.000> care<00:02:36.360> I<00:02:36.599> didn't<00:02:36.959> do<00:02:37.019> a<00:02:37.049> body

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
everyone body care I didn't do a body

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:38.839 
everyone body care I didn't do a body
care<00:02:37.530> anything<00:02:37.739> I<00:02:37.920> think<00:02:38.069> the<00:02:38.220> car<00:02:38.430> looks<00:02:38.640> nice

00:02:38.839 --> 00:02:38.849

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
know on the ins and I think that's good

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.130 
know on the ins and I think that's good
enough<00:02:43.680> for<00:02:43.829> me<00:02:44.010> this<00:02:44.640> car<00:02:45.000> is<00:02:45.299> good<00:02:45.840> at<00:02:45.959> high

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
enough for me this car is good at high

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.220 
enough for me this car is good at high
speed<00:02:46.470> drifting<00:02:46.769> and<00:02:47.220> lose<00:02:47.489> speed<00:02:47.910> is<00:02:48.209> good<00:02:49.049> as

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
speed drifting and lose speed is good as

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:54.319 
speed drifting and lose speed is good as
well<00:02:49.310> I<00:02:50.310> mean<00:02:50.910> you<00:02:51.840> can<00:02:52.069> get<00:02:53.069> it<00:02:53.220> uphill<00:02:54.000> and

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:54.329 
well I mean you can get it uphill and

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:57.140 
well I mean you can get it uphill and
downhill<00:02:54.870> drift<00:02:55.319> in<00:02:55.530> it<00:02:55.650> is<00:02:55.769> pretty<00:02:56.310> crazy<00:02:56.670> so

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
downhill drift in it is pretty crazy so

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:58.910 
downhill drift in it is pretty crazy so
as<00:02:57.660> you<00:02:57.810> can<00:02:57.900> see<00:02:57.959> here<00:02:58.319> and<00:02:58.410> I'm<00:02:58.500> add<00:02:58.680> another
