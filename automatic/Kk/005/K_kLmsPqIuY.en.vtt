00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:13.330 
subject is in the center so I will put
color<00:04:10.640> with<00:04:10.910> netting<00:04:11.240> to<00:04:11.630> this<00:04:11.810> image<00:04:12.170> to<00:04:12.770> get

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:13.340 
color with netting to this image to get

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:16.599 
color with netting to this image to get
more<00:04:13.640> focus<00:04:13.970> in<00:04:14.090> the<00:04:14.180> center<00:04:15.280> minus<00:04:16.280> 11<00:04:16.580> is

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:16.609 
more focus in the center minus 11 is

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:23.800 
more focus in the center minus 11 is
sufficient<00:04:17.180> for<00:04:17.359> this<00:04:17.480> image<00:04:18.190> so<00:04:21.490> and<00:04:22.490> I<00:04:23.419> will

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:23.810 
sufficient for this image so and I will

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:28.300 
sufficient for this image so and I will
check<00:04:24.020> how<00:04:24.740> this<00:04:25.430> tree<00:04:25.730> I<00:04:26.950> will<00:04:27.950> do<00:04:28.100> such

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:28.310 
check how this tree I will do such

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:32.920 
check how this tree I will do such
iterator<00:04:28.610> firstly<00:04:29.980> okay<00:04:30.980> now<00:04:31.760> in<00:04:32.480> tree<00:04:32.750> and

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:32.930 
iterator firstly okay now in tree and

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:37.090 
iterator firstly okay now in tree and
all<00:04:33.169> plants<00:04:33.620> there<00:04:33.940> there<00:04:34.940> is<00:04:35.000> a<00:04:35.030> color<00:04:35.330> yellow

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:37.100 
all plants there there is a color yellow

I want green so I will move this hue

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:41.770 
I want green so I will move this hue
slider

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:41.780 
slider

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:48.490 
slider
through<00:04:43.870> plus<00:04:44.919> 14<00:04:46.270> okay<00:04:47.270> it's<00:04:47.870> working<00:04:48.110> better

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:48.500 
through plus 14 okay it's working better

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:53.340 
through plus 14 okay it's working better
now<00:04:48.830> I<00:04:49.580> will<00:04:50.080> punch<00:04:51.080> highlights<00:04:51.530> for<00:04:51.800> this
