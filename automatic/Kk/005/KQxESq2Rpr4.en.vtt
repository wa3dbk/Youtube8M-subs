of<00:02:30.700> my<00:02:30.790> favorite<00:02:31.209> pastimes<00:02:31.650> anyway<00:02:32.650> this<00:02:33.069> is

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
of my favorite pastimes anyway this is

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.520 
of my favorite pastimes anyway this is
how<00:02:33.310> it<00:02:33.549> works<00:02:33.819> you<00:02:34.150> craft<00:02:34.780> a<00:02:34.930> map<00:02:35.109> from<00:02:35.260> paper

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
how it works you craft a map from paper

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.229 
how it works you craft a map from paper
and<00:02:35.799> make<00:02:36.220> sure<00:02:36.430> that<00:02:36.579> it's<00:02:36.730> somewhere<00:02:37.090> in

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:37.239 
and make sure that it's somewhere in

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:38.940 
and make sure that it's somewhere in
your<00:02:37.299> belt<00:02:37.660> bar<00:02:37.930> because<00:02:38.470> that's<00:02:38.650> the<00:02:38.799> only

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
your belt bar because that's the only

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.099 
your belt bar because that's the only
place<00:02:39.160> where<00:02:39.190> it<00:02:39.400> will<00:02:39.549> be<00:02:39.700> active<00:02:40.090> then<00:02:40.750> you

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:41.109 
place where it will be active then you

00:02:41.109 --> 00:02:42.930 
place where it will be active then you
just<00:02:41.349> simply<00:02:41.500> walk<00:02:41.859> about<00:02:42.099> aimlessly<00:02:42.670> or

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
just simply walk about aimlessly or

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.089 
just simply walk about aimlessly or
otherwise<00:02:43.450> and<00:02:43.900> it<00:02:44.109> will<00:02:44.260> auto<00:02:44.500> magically

00:02:45.089 --> 00:02:45.099 
otherwise and it will auto magically

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:47.309 
otherwise and it will auto magically
fill<00:02:45.340> itself<00:02:45.700> in<00:02:45.880> there's<00:02:46.780> a<00:02:46.870> fog<00:02:47.139> of<00:02:47.170> war

00:02:47.309 --> 00:02:47.319 
fill itself in there's a fog of war

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:49.530 
fill itself in there's a fog of war
effect<00:02:47.980> so<00:02:48.310> you<00:02:48.340> need<00:02:48.670> to<00:02:48.790> have<00:02:48.849> explored<00:02:49.389> an

effect so you need to have explored an

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.080 
effect so you need to have explored an
area<00:02:49.900> first<00:02:50.260> before<00:02:50.590> it<00:02:50.799> will<00:02:51.010> appear<00:02:51.459> but<00:02:51.970> the

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630 
crafting bench it's okay it's just a

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:30.479 
crafting bench it's okay it's just a
palette<00:03:28.989> swaps<00:03:29.260> placeholder<00:03:29.950> for<00:03:30.069> the<00:03:30.160> moment

palette swaps placeholder for the moment

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:33.059

but<00:03:30.940> if<00:03:31.269> we<00:03:31.629> head<00:03:31.780> over<00:03:32.019> to<00:03:32.049> the<00:03:32.169> dev<00:03:32.410> branch<00:03:32.709> we

00:03:33.059 --> 00:03:33.069 
but if we head over to the dev branch we

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:34.440 
but if we head over to the dev branch we
can<00:03:33.220> see<00:03:33.370> what<00:03:33.519> everyone<00:03:33.970> should<00:03:34.000> hopefully

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 
can see what everyone should hopefully

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:37.500 
can see what everyone should hopefully
be<00:03:34.750> getting<00:03:35.169> next<00:03:35.379> week<00:03:35.819> that's<00:03:36.819> better<00:03:37.180> okay

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
be getting next week that's better okay

there's<00:04:26.960> also<00:04:27.260> another<00:04:27.620> secret<00:04:28.520> ammo<00:04:29.000> type<00:04:29.300> in

there's also another secret ammo type in

there's also another secret ammo type in
the<00:04:29.630> works<00:04:29.840> and<00:04:30.110> our<00:04:30.440> only<00:04:30.680> clue<00:04:31.070> so<00:04:31.370> far<00:04:31.670> is

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:31.880 
the works and our only clue so far is

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:34.750 
the works and our only clue so far is
that<00:04:31.940> it's<00:04:32.420> green<00:04:33.040> perhaps<00:04:34.040> it<00:04:34.250> turns<00:04:34.550> people

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:34.760 
that it's green perhaps it turns people

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:36.910 
that it's green perhaps it turns people
into<00:04:35.000> vegetarians<00:04:35.870> and<00:04:36.020> they<00:04:36.170> slowly<00:04:36.470> starve

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:36.920 
into vegetarians and they slowly starve

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:38.350 
into vegetarians and they slowly starve
to<00:04:37.100> death<00:04:37.130> because<00:04:37.580> they<00:04:37.700> can't<00:04:37.910> eat<00:04:38.120> wolf

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:38.360 
to death because they can't eat wolf

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.440 
to death because they can't eat wolf
meat<00:04:38.600> that's<00:04:39.260> my<00:04:39.440> guess<00:04:39.710> and<00:04:40.090> we<00:04:41.090> can<00:04:41.270> now

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:41.450 
meat that's my guess and we can now

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:43.480 
meat that's my guess and we can now
start<00:04:41.510> playing<00:04:42.140> around<00:04:42.380> with<00:04:42.650> the<00:04:42.890> beam<00:04:43.130> can

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:43.490 
start playing around with the beam can

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:51.480 
start playing around with the beam can
grenade<00:04:44.020> sometimes<00:04:45.020> it<00:04:45.170> goes<00:04:45.350> off<00:04:48.970> and

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:51.490 
grenade sometimes it goes off and

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:53.590 
grenade sometimes it goes off and
sometimes<00:04:52.490> it<00:04:52.640> can't<00:04:52.850> be<00:04:52.970> bothered<00:04:53.120> all

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:53.600 
sometimes it can't be bothered all

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.810 
sometimes it can't be bothered all
depending<00:04:54.200> on<00:04:54.320> the<00:04:54.440> ratio<00:04:54.860> of<00:04:55.070> beans<00:04:55.340> to<00:04:55.610> bean

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:55.820 
depending on the ratio of beans to bean

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:58.390 
depending on the ratio of beans to bean
deuce<00:04:56.090> I<00:04:56.300> suppose<00:04:56.770> whether<00:04:57.770> or<00:04:58.010> not<00:04:58.130> it's<00:04:58.310> a

00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:58.400 
deuce I suppose whether or not it's a

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.520 
deuce I suppose whether or not it's a
good<00:04:58.610> idea<00:04:58.790> to<00:04:59.120> pick<00:04:59.330> up<00:04:59.480> ones<00:04:59.720> that<00:04:59.930> failed<00:05:00.230> to

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:00.530 
good idea to pick up ones that failed to

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:03.190 
good idea to pick up ones that failed to
detonate<00:05:00.770> well<00:05:01.760> I'll<00:05:02.180> let<00:05:02.390> you<00:05:02.450> find<00:05:02.810> out<00:05:03.020> for

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:03.200 
detonate well I'll let you find out for

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:06.730 
detonate well I'll let you find out for
yourself<00:05:04.690> lastly<00:05:05.690> I<00:05:05.840> would<00:05:06.140> just<00:05:06.380> like<00:05:06.560> to

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:06.740 
yourself lastly I would just like to

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:08.920 
yourself lastly I would just like to
mention<00:05:06.890> that<00:05:07.250> I<00:05:07.370> asked<00:05:07.970> Gary<00:05:08.300> this<00:05:08.630> week

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:08.930 
mention that I asked Gary this week

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:11.140 
mention that I asked Gary this week
about<00:05:09.110> the<00:05:09.260> possibility<00:05:10.010> of<00:05:10.040> pies<00:05:10.520> in<00:05:10.910> rust

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:11.150 
about the possibility of pies in rust

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:13.870 
about the possibility of pies in rust
and<00:05:11.360> this<00:05:12.050> is<00:05:12.230> what<00:05:12.410> he<00:05:12.530> said<00:05:12.890> now<00:05:13.520> I<00:05:13.760> don't

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:13.880 
and this is what he said now I don't

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.300 
and this is what he said now I don't
want<00:05:14.420> you<00:05:14.450> to<00:05:14.600> get<00:05:14.780> too<00:05:15.020> excited<00:05:15.050> just<00:05:15.860> yet

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:16.310 
want you to get too excited just yet

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:18.280 
want you to get too excited just yet
but<00:05:16.520> I<00:05:16.550> think<00:05:16.670> that<00:05:17.060> might<00:05:17.420> just<00:05:17.450> be<00:05:17.780> a<00:05:17.930> yes

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:18.290 
but I think that might just be a yes

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:22.450 
but I think that might just be a yes
maybe<00:05:20.200> anyway<00:05:21.200> thank<00:05:21.680> you<00:05:21.830> for<00:05:22.010> watching<00:05:22.340> this
