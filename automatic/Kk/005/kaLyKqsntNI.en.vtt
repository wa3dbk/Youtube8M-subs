 car bmw 5231 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:57.230
 there are two cars installed 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:59.710

 will be removed and replaced remind dampers 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:43.440
 the company sleeps removes thermal protection and 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.440
 proceed to remove the catalyst 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:50.560
 cuts the front catalyst case 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:59.049
 to maintain mutual position 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:02:01.030
 parts weld the retainer then 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:05.159
 catalyst filter element 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.159
 finally cut out of the case and 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:19.660
 removed in its place will be installed

 catalyst housing carefully 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:41.190
 I boil it then cut off the senior unnecessary

 welding 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.760
 proceed to remove the second catalyst 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:08.030
 cuts body weld clamps 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:18.510
 then the filter element is finally 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:21.510
 removed from the body in its place will be

 paints the place of welding 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:32.850
 protect the end of the exhaust pipe and such 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:32.850
 catalyst replaced by flame arrester 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:43.500
 remember new exhaust manifolds 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:51.470
 damper set on a regular place

 blende blende called upon to transmit on and 

00:05:11.759 --> 00:05:16.669
 the engine was in good order 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:19.050
 catalyst 

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:20.520
 repair is over and warranty on all 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:23.780
