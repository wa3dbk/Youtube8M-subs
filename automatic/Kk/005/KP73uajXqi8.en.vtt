00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:10.730
 if for example we have a birthday that 

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:12.889
 is perhaps about a friend who 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:15.110
 they want a lot for example joana can 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:17.480
 be called good because you have to treat the 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:19.700
 you have to give her a little love and what better 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.980
 that here with ale have something to put 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:24.410
 on top of a pannacotta or a cake 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:26.480
 exact is a sauce of all and that is going to 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:28.189
 do as an accompaniment to 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.259
 different preparations and only 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:32.480
 they carry three ingredients except which 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:33.140
 we are have granulated common sugar 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.030
 white 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.170
 we have the evaporated milk and we have 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.480
 butter to give a touch of 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.910
 perfect brightness look well since here 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.640
 we simply have sugar cell 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:45.859
 white cooking already be formed 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.929
 a beautiful candy if it has to be a 

00:00:45.859 --> 00:00:50.929
 blond candy as you see here this color 

00:00:47.929 --> 00:00:54.769
 it is very important then with a lot 

00:00:50.929 --> 00:00:57.829
 careful please let's add the 

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:59.090
 blow evaporated milk and here they go 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:01.850
 hear 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.180
 how it sounds like I was suffering something 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.940
 A) Yes 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.070
 of those and little bit and what's going to 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:10.920
 happen that the milk helps the 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:14.100
 candy is removed from the pan and 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.520
 It has a delicious aroma 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.520
 that's 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.220
 and this is common that for example you can 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.860
 there is a small burn 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:26.310
 be careful exactly exactly 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.170
 Be very careful with that, that's why I 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.440
 If you see the table here I have a little 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:34.770
 ice just in case because they tend to 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:37.140
 some burns do not and it's very very very 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:40.380
 delicate perfect ready then 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:43.590
 it just stopped ringing and see if 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.690
 to unemployment and we have it controlled yes good 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.970
 and now yes with fire well low 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:51.130
 we go back to the fire 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:54.130
 and we are going to move constantly and 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.960
 here yes we already have it controlled and now 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.300
 if we move constantly until 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.280
 let's make the sauce if we want to make 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:02.410
 a liquid sauce to accompany 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.180
 then the cooking will not delay 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:08.280
 a lot is simply going to be light 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:11.410
 like what I have here is light 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:14.880
 totally light, you see drops that fall 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:16.330
 quickly but ma'am this I follow 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.970
 cooking 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:21.550
 I'm going to really become tofu the 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.860
 tof and that is pasty to make a 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.910

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.600

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:36.870
 preparation and much better then 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:40.390
 we can accompany it with a pannacotta 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:42.160
 with the side and it's delicious we go to the 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:43.959
 drowned table to the mix we're never going to 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.910
 the table once the sauce is already 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:48.520
 list please wait for it to cool 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:51.610
 and from there we will proceed to accompany the 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:53.920
