so<00:02:25.790> that's<00:02:26.790> one<00:02:27.000> of<00:02:27.090> my<00:02:27.209> tricks<00:02:27.540> a<00:02:27.980> little<00:02:28.980> it's

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
so that's one of my tricks a little it's

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:30.319 
so that's one of my tricks a little it's
really<00:02:29.250> a<00:02:29.280> trick<00:02:29.549> but<00:02:29.700> it's<00:02:29.820> true<00:02:29.970> shadows

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:30.329 
really a trick but it's true shadows

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:32.150 
really a trick but it's true shadows
make<00:02:30.510> stuff<00:02:30.720> better<00:02:30.890> you're<00:02:31.890> going<00:02:31.980> to<00:02:32.040> do

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
make stuff better you're going to do

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.680 
make stuff better you're going to do
like<00:02:32.280> pork<00:02:32.549> steaks<00:02:32.790> and<00:02:32.910> stuff<00:02:33.000> get<00:02:33.329> thick

like pork steaks and stuff get thick

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.000 
like pork steaks and stuff get thick
ones<00:02:33.959> because<00:02:34.350> the<00:02:34.470> bigger<00:02:34.680> they<00:02:34.859> are<00:02:34.890> the

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
ones because the bigger they are the

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.610 
ones because the bigger they are the
better<00:02:35.310> they<00:02:35.519> turn<00:02:35.730> out<00:02:35.989> the<00:02:36.989> other<00:02:37.109> thing<00:02:37.380> is

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
better they turn out the other thing is
