00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
mentioned the last video the scoop shift

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.679 
mentioned the last video the scoop shift
turns<00:00:21.600> by<00:00:22.109> the<00:00:22.170> corners<00:00:22.650> like<00:00:22.740> this<00:00:22.920> and<00:00:23.689> one

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
turns by the corners like this and one

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.390 
turns by the corners like this and one
thing<00:00:24.930> I<00:00:25.140> didn't<00:00:25.410> mention<00:00:25.439> I<00:00:25.859> don't<00:00:26.160> think<00:00:26.310> in

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
thing I didn't mention I don't think in

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.599 
thing I didn't mention I don't think in
that<00:00:26.490> video<00:00:26.640> is<00:00:26.910> that<00:00:27.390> the<00:00:27.660> centers<00:00:28.230> here<00:00:28.710> they

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
that video is that the centers here they

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.089 
that video is that the centers here they
need<00:00:29.789> to<00:00:29.939> be<00:00:30.060> oriented<00:00:30.630> properly<00:00:30.960> with<00:00:31.769> their

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
need to be oriented properly with their

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.590 
need to be oriented properly with their
corners<00:00:32.489> so<00:00:32.610> you<00:00:32.640> see<00:00:32.880> this<00:00:33.030> little<00:00:33.239> triangle

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
corners so you see this little triangle

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.690 
corners so you see this little triangle
here<00:00:33.809> has<00:00:34.140> to<00:00:34.290> match<00:00:34.440> with<00:00:34.680> this<00:00:34.860> triangle<00:00:35.190> so

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
here has to match with this triangle so

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.400 
here has to match with this triangle so
right<00:00:35.910> now<00:00:36.059> the<00:00:36.120> puzzle<00:00:36.510> isn't<00:00:36.809> solved<00:00:37.230> and

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
right now the puzzle isn't solved and

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.740 
right now the puzzle isn't solved and
anyway<00:00:38.250> if<00:00:38.460> all<00:00:38.670> you<00:00:38.879> could<00:00:39.000> do<00:00:39.210> was<00:00:39.480> kind<00:00:39.660> of

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
anyway if all you could do was kind of

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.619 
anyway if all you could do was kind of
turn<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.590> corners<00:00:40.950> like<00:00:41.129> this<00:00:41.360> the<00:00:42.360> puzzle

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
turn the corners like this the puzzle

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.119 
turn the corners like this the puzzle
wouldn't<00:00:42.840> be<00:00:42.899> that<00:00:43.050> interesting<00:00:43.590> because<00:00:43.920> you

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
wouldn't be that interesting because you

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.549 
wouldn't be that interesting because you
could<00:00:44.280> just<00:00:44.309> keep<00:00:44.670> on<00:00:44.879> turning<00:00:45.329> forever<00:00:45.690> until

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
could just keep on turning forever until

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.040 
could just keep on turning forever until
you<00:00:46.890> solve<00:00:47.280> it<00:00:47.489> again<00:00:47.640> like<00:00:47.850> I<00:00:47.969> just<00:00:48.030> did<00:00:48.420> so

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
you solve it again like I just did so

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.380 
you solve it again like I just did so
but<00:00:49.860> what<00:00:50.010> makes<00:00:50.190> this<00:00:50.309> interesting<00:00:50.640> is<00:00:51.030> you

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
but what makes this interesting is you

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:52.939 
but what makes this interesting is you
can<00:00:51.539> actually<00:00:51.660> pull<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.170> puzzle<00:00:52.440> apart<00:00:52.739> and

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
can actually pull the puzzle apart and

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.560 
can actually pull the puzzle apart and
then<00:00:53.579> turn<00:00:53.820> half<00:00:54.120> of<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.360> gears

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
then turn half of the gears

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.540 
then turn half of the gears
independently<00:00:55.410> and<00:00:55.620> then<00:00:56.070> when<00:00:56.190> you<00:00:56.250> push<00:00:56.430> it

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
independently and then when you push it

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.670 
independently and then when you push it
back<00:00:56.640> together<00:00:56.820> then<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.780> puzzle<00:00:58.170> scrambled

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
back together then the puzzle scrambled

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.380 
back together then the puzzle scrambled
and<00:00:58.859> now<00:00:59.039> if<00:00:59.280> you<00:00:59.430> turn<00:00:59.609> the<00:00:59.760> gears<00:01:00.030> you<00:01:00.120> can

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
and now if you turn the gears you can

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.630 
and now if you turn the gears you can
never<00:01:00.600> solve<00:01:00.930> it<00:01:01.140> unless<00:01:01.350> you<00:01:02.100> pull<00:01:02.550> the

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
never solve it unless you pull the

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.910 
never solve it unless you pull the
puzzle<00:01:02.910> apart<00:01:03.210> and<00:01:03.390> try<00:01:03.539> to<00:01:03.600> fix<00:01:03.840> it<00:01:03.960> so<00:01:04.140> anyway

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
puzzle apart and try to fix it so anyway

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.969 
puzzle apart and try to fix it so anyway
it's<00:01:05.760> a<00:01:05.939> pretty<00:01:06.210> cool<00:01:06.390> puzzle<00:01:06.810> I<00:01:07.350> couldn't

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
it's a pretty cool puzzle I couldn't

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.980 
it's a pretty cool puzzle I couldn't
believe<00:01:08.070> that<00:01:08.520> I<00:01:09.000> was<00:01:09.119> able<00:01:09.510> to<00:01:09.540> solve<00:01:09.810> it

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
believe that I was able to solve it

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.480 
believe that I was able to solve it
actually<00:01:10.350> as<00:01:10.439> quickly<00:01:10.680> as<00:01:10.920> I<00:01:11.010> could<00:01:11.070> it's

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
actually as quickly as I could it's

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.190 
actually as quickly as I could it's
actually<00:01:11.880> not<00:01:12.119> that<00:01:12.180> difficult<00:01:12.479> it's<00:01:12.930> pretty

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
actually not that difficult it's pretty

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.490 
actually not that difficult it's pretty
easy<00:01:13.409> puzzle<00:01:13.860> and<00:01:14.790> it's<00:01:14.939> easier<00:01:15.360> than<00:01:15.540> kind<00:01:16.409> of

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
easy puzzle and it's easier than kind of

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.280 
easy puzzle and it's easier than kind of
it's<00:01:16.950> a<00:01:17.369> sibling<00:01:17.880> puzzle<00:01:18.360> which<00:01:18.570> is<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:19.049> gear

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
it's a sibling puzzle which is the gear

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.410 
it's a sibling puzzle which is the gear
shift<00:01:19.590> that<00:01:20.340> one's<00:01:20.549> a<00:01:20.640> little<00:01:20.759> bit<00:01:21.000> harder<00:01:21.030> so

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
shift that one's a little bit harder so

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.020 
shift that one's a little bit harder so
anyway<00:01:22.020> I<00:01:22.530> think<00:01:22.890> I'm<00:01:23.009> gonna<00:01:23.130> scramble<00:01:23.939> this

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
anyway I think I'm gonna scramble this

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.730 
anyway I think I'm gonna scramble this
up<00:01:24.240> like<00:01:24.420> I<00:01:24.630> have<00:01:24.840> been<00:01:25.049> and<00:01:25.290> I'm<00:01:25.439> going<00:01:25.680> to

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
up like I have been and I'm going to

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.380 
up like I have been and I'm going to
solve<00:01:26.040> it<00:01:26.159> for<00:01:26.189> you<00:01:26.369> guys<00:01:26.490> so<00:01:27.060> you<00:01:27.119> can<00:01:27.180> see

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
solve it for you guys so you can see

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.130 
solve it for you guys so you can see
kind<00:01:27.630> of<00:01:27.689> how<00:01:27.780> it<00:01:28.049> solves<00:01:28.490> and<00:01:29.490> anyway<00:01:30.360> let's

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
kind of how it solves and anyway let's

00:01:31.140 --> 00:02:06.469 
kind of how it solves and anyway let's
get<00:01:31.590> started<00:01:31.950> so<00:01:32.390> on<00:01:33.390> your<00:01:33.540> mark<00:01:33.689> is<00:01:33.780> that<00:01:33.930> go

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.540 

there<00:02:07.479> we<00:02:07.570> go<00:02:07.830> so<00:02:08.830> as<00:02:08.950> you<00:02:09.100> see<00:02:09.280> it's<00:02:09.369> not<00:02:09.459> too

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
there we go so as you see it's not too

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.250 
there we go so as you see it's not too
difficult<00:02:09.880> to<00:02:10.090> solve<00:02:10.360> that<00:02:10.869> was<00:02:10.959> a<00:02:10.990> pretty

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
difficult to solve that was a pretty

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.100 
difficult to solve that was a pretty
normal<00:02:11.950> solve<00:02:12.430> for<00:02:12.700> me<00:02:12.819> I<00:02:12.850> had<00:02:13.330> to<00:02:13.360> do<00:02:13.569> all<00:02:13.810> the

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
normal solve for me I had to do all the

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:15.510 
normal solve for me I had to do all the
steps<00:02:14.319> of<00:02:14.680> the<00:02:14.860> solve

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
steps of the solve

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.300 
steps of the solve
often<00:02:16.270> some<00:02:17.080> of<00:02:17.110> the<00:02:17.170> steps<00:02:17.440> are<00:02:17.620> skipped<00:02:17.950> and

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
often some of the steps are skipped and

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.630 
often some of the steps are skipped and
so<00:02:19.030> anyway<00:02:19.300> yeah<00:02:19.930> it's<00:02:20.080> pretty<00:02:20.290> easy<00:02:20.590> I<00:02:21.190> kind

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
so anyway yeah it's pretty easy I kind

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.729 
so anyway yeah it's pretty easy I kind
of<00:02:21.670> like<00:02:21.850> easy<00:02:22.150> puzzles<00:02:22.569> these<00:02:23.140> days<00:02:23.470> because

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:23.739 
of like easy puzzles these days because

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:27.210 
of like easy puzzles these days because
I<00:02:23.980> can<00:02:24.489> pick<00:02:24.610> them<00:02:24.760> up<00:02:24.959> and<00:02:25.959> solve<00:02:26.739> them<00:02:26.920> at<00:02:27.040> any

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
I can pick them up and solve them at any

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:28.920 
I can pick them up and solve them at any
time<00:02:27.520> and<00:02:27.760> I<00:02:27.790> don't<00:02:27.880> have<00:02:28.000> to<00:02:28.270> like<00:02:28.420> set<00:02:28.630> aside

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
time and I don't have to like set aside

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.350 
time and I don't have to like set aside
a<00:02:29.140> large<00:02:29.739> amount<00:02:30.100> of<00:02:30.160> time<00:02:30.340> and<00:02:30.610> honestly<00:02:31.090> a

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
a large amount of time and honestly a

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.150 
a large amount of time and honestly a
lot<00:02:31.540> of<00:02:31.600> the<00:02:31.720> harder<00:02:32.319> puzzles<00:02:32.709> that<00:02:32.860> I<00:02:32.890> get

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
lot of the harder puzzles that I get

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.150 
lot of the harder puzzles that I get
that<00:02:33.310> I<00:02:33.370> do<00:02:33.489> figure<00:02:33.850> out<00:02:34.080> I<00:02:35.080> end<00:02:35.590> up<00:02:35.739> forgetting

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
that I do figure out I end up forgetting

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.259 
that I do figure out I end up forgetting
my<00:02:36.430> own<00:02:36.459> solutions<00:02:37.300> and<00:02:38.040> and<00:02:39.040> then<00:02:39.310> I'm<00:02:39.580> you

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:40.269 
my own solutions and and then I'm you

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:41.610 
my own solutions and and then I'm you
know<00:02:40.390> they're<00:02:40.510> more<00:02:40.660> intimidating<00:02:41.260> to<00:02:41.410> pick

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
know they're more intimidating to pick

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.130 
know they're more intimidating to pick
up<00:02:41.769> off<00:02:41.920> the<00:02:42.100> shelf<00:02:42.130> because<00:02:42.610> it<00:02:43.330> would<00:02:43.690> take<00:02:43.900> a

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
up off the shelf because it would take a

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.020 
up off the shelf because it would take a
lot<00:02:44.290> a<00:02:44.470> lot<00:02:44.890> of<00:02:45.010> time<00:02:45.190> to<00:02:45.370> remember<00:02:45.700> how<00:02:46.000> I

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
lot a lot of time to remember how I

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.540 
lot a lot of time to remember how I
solve<00:02:46.390> it<00:02:46.510> and<00:02:46.720> anyway<00:02:47.620> this<00:02:47.739> is<00:02:47.800> a<00:02:48.010> puzzle

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:48.550 
solve it and anyway this is a puzzle

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:50.790 
solve it and anyway this is a puzzle
that's<00:02:48.670> kind<00:02:49.120> of<00:02:49.209> easy<00:02:49.420> so<00:02:49.750> I<00:02:50.140> probably<00:02:50.440> won't

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:50.800 
that's kind of easy so I probably won't

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.070 
that's kind of easy so I probably won't
forget<00:02:51.280> the<00:02:51.430> solution<00:02:51.819> to<00:02:51.940> this<00:02:52.060> so<00:02:52.690> I<00:02:52.720> won't

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.080 
forget the solution to this so I won't

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.320 
forget the solution to this so I won't
be<00:02:53.200> intimidated<00:02:53.380> just<00:02:53.769> you<00:02:54.340> know<00:02:54.459> I<00:02:54.730> wouldn't

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330 
be intimidated just you know I wouldn't

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.600 
be intimidated just you know I wouldn't
be<00:02:55.480> if<00:02:55.750> I<00:02:55.900> had<00:02:56.110> it<00:02:56.290> to<00:02:56.500> you<00:02:57.010> know<00:02:57.100> take<00:02:57.340> it<00:02:57.489> off

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
be if I had it to you know take it off

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:59.820 
be if I had it to you know take it off
the<00:02:57.730> shelf<00:02:57.940> and<00:02:58.090> play<00:02:58.569> with<00:02:58.720> it<00:02:58.750> mix<00:02:59.350> it<00:02:59.440> up<00:02:59.590> and

00:02:59.820 --> 00:02:59.830 
the shelf and play with it mix it up and

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:02.610 
the shelf and play with it mix it up and
solve<00:03:00.430> it<00:03:00.550> so<00:03:01.000> anyway<00:03:01.269> that's<00:03:01.989> the<00:03:02.230> Scoob

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
solve it so anyway that's the Scoob

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.380 
solve it so anyway that's the Scoob
shift<00:03:02.890> I<00:03:03.130> don't<00:03:03.519> know<00:03:03.610> what<00:03:03.850> else<00:03:04.000> to<00:03:04.150> say

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390 
shift I don't know what else to say

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:05.670 
shift I don't know what else to say
about<00:03:04.510> this<00:03:04.720> puzzle<00:03:05.019> is<00:03:05.140> I<00:03:05.260> think<00:03:05.440> it's<00:03:05.560> pretty

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
about this puzzle is I think it's pretty

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.039 
about this puzzle is I think it's pretty
cool<00:03:06.040> I<00:03:06.730> want<00:03:07.060> to<00:03:07.120> thank<00:03:07.209> Oscar<00:03:07.630> for<00:03:07.810> sending

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
these puzzles and anyway stay tuned for

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.509 
these puzzles and anyway stay tuned for
the<00:03:10.780> next<00:03:10.870> video<00:03:11.200> where<00:03:11.739> I<00:03:11.769> will<00:03:11.980> show<00:03:12.459> you

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:12.519 
the next video where I will show you

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:15.390 
the next video where I will show you
guys<00:03:12.700> one<00:03:13.030> of<00:03:13.120> the<00:03:13.209> other<00:03:13.470> three<00:03:14.470> from<00:03:15.250> the

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
guys one of the other three from the

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.360 
guys one of the other three from the
four<00:03:15.670> that<00:03:15.850> he<00:03:16.030> sent<00:03:16.360> and<00:03:16.769> the<00:03:17.769> other<00:03:17.950> ones<00:03:18.220> are

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
four that he sent and the other ones are

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:19.979 
four that he sent and the other ones are
definitely<00:03:18.820> much<00:03:19.090> harder<00:03:19.450> than<00:03:19.600> this<00:03:19.780> one

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:19.989 
definitely much harder than this one

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:22.170 
definitely much harder than this one
this<00:03:20.440> one<00:03:20.769> is<00:03:21.070> actually<00:03:21.310> the<00:03:21.489> only<00:03:21.730> one<00:03:21.910> I've

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
this one is actually the only one I've

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.080 
this one is actually the only one I've
solved<00:03:22.480> so<00:03:22.630> far<00:03:22.660> and<00:03:23.340> anyway<00:03:24.340> I<00:03:24.519> hope<00:03:24.760> I<00:03:24.910> can

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
solved so far and anyway I hope I can

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.350 
solved so far and anyway I hope I can
solve<00:03:25.329> the<00:03:26.140> other<00:03:26.799> ones<00:03:27.040> by<00:03:27.280> the<00:03:27.310> time<00:03:27.640> I<00:03:27.970> make
