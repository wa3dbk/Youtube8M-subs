Hi everyone I’m Ryoya.

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:19.080
I’m going to make lentil soup as the third recipe of the soup month. 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:26.080
I found brown lentils when I went shopping so I bought this.

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:36.300
There is red lentils other than brown one, but you can use either.

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:40.580
Texture and tastes of Red lentils and borwn lentils are different.

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:52.580
Red lentils are easy to fall apart while boiling which is good when I want to make thick soup.

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:59.980
Brown lentils don’t fall apart easily and taste more beany.

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.180
Anyway, use either red or brown which you can get at store.

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.480
I’ll taste this.

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:37.740
Good.

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:45.960
I used tomatoes this time. 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:51.600
Brown lentils is best match for tomatoes I think.

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:58.020
And if you don’t use tomatoes, use red lentils.

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:05.620
 But choose whatever you’d like, you can even use both at the same time. So try your way.

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:15.060
I’m going to show you autumn root vegetable soup as the last video of this month.

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:20.780
 People often add Bouillon or Dashi into soup. 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:29.960
There is a bouillon for vegetarian but I don’t use any bouillon or dashi most of the time, I’m going to season with only salt.

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:41.520
When I season soup with only salt, I can feel the taste of vegetable more and it really delicious.

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:42.974
So see you in next week!
