00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:09.700
 the best way to spread because vendel is right after the bleeding well I have 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:13.260
 want to go beyond with a hedge trimmer as every group says you would click 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:17.820
 I would like that for him on this day on this actually too long ago 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.820
 pruned this way 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.660
 It is important to ensure magazine all cases 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.830
 not all outfits 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:43.620
 that make sure to follow that you are always green from the ven option 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.620
 the advantage of wanting to stimulate in this way is that plan 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:01.600
 being squeezed remains 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.430
 Even before winter newland will make it richer next year 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:06.920
 are going to bloom 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.250
 the problem alone 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.690
 is that you have to do this consistently peace every time immediately after being difficult 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:16.070
 the pruning with a hedge trimmer 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:17.070
 can see that 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.500
 at this will continue on 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.500
 that simply does not happen lydia 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.440
 the picture that emerges is that the lavender will enlarge at the bottom 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.820
 and will fall 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.930
 you can then start pruning the sale with the secateurs 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:34.930
 I would cut out an example branch 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.990
 as you can see, the prohibition is quite proportional at the bottom 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.360
 but if you want to be sure that the lavender has such a strong back anyway 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.060
 survive 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.430
 you must go with the first leaf 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:57.110
 that encounters the cycles with points above the first green 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:58.410
 leaves 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:01.410
 marbled lavender 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:14.760
 this is further away the safest way to cut this legend because of this 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.349
 way bit really one hundred percent sure he will walk out 

00:02:27.139 --> 00:02:31.509
 Do you know that like this way lubricated is still too much 

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:34.409
 mistakes I would like to get through 

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:38.330
 yes it is a matter of trying it depends on whether the 

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:42.449
 Lavender strength enough goes on to walk out onto the bare wood 

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:46.779
 I therefore recommend trying the school with part of the plan 

00:02:48.419 --> 00:02:51.419
 cut the day against duisburg 

00:02:51.999 --> 00:02:54.999
 keeps it bare 

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:04.899
 I watch 

00:03:04.899 --> 00:03:08.269
 in the current well on which this will end 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:09.919
 the door closed 

00:03:09.919 --> 00:03:11.339
 buy the stream 

00:03:11.339 --> 00:03:16.299
 she knows for sure that you will plant the entire plant on this mini cat swoon next year 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:19.299
 then he would be guaranteed that 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:29.390
 If you do not walk out on the bare car you know that you are actually sure 

00:03:29.389 --> 00:03:32.209
 if you prune the whole guy that way 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:34.329
 that whole plant would die 

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:38.209
 we are only one thing that is just home center and the duration of the 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:38.979
 sell vendel
