in<00:00:02.400> this<00:00:02.550> lesson<00:00:02.730> we're<00:00:03.000> going<00:00:03.090> to<00:00:03.149> take<00:00:03.300> a

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:03.360 
in this lesson we're going to take a

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.049 
in this lesson we're going to take a
look<00:00:03.600> at<00:00:03.840> copying<00:00:04.500> and<00:00:04.590> pasting<00:00:04.790> it's<00:00:05.790> one<00:00:05.970> of

00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:06.059 
look at copying and pasting it's one of

00:00:06.059 --> 00:00:07.870 
look at copying and pasting it's one of
the<00:00:06.120> fundamental<00:00:06.599> skills<00:00:06.689> that<00:00:07.170> you<00:00:07.410> can<00:00:07.439> use

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:07.880 
the fundamental skills that you can use

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:10.430 
the fundamental skills that you can use
basically<00:00:08.880> the<00:00:09.030> same<00:00:09.180> way<00:00:09.420> across<00:00:10.020> the<00:00:10.200> board

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
basically the same way across the board

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.580 
basically the same way across the board
in<00:00:10.970> not<00:00:11.970> every<00:00:12.300> single<00:00:12.450> app<00:00:12.720> because<00:00:13.230> not<00:00:13.410> all

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
in not every single app because not all

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.860 
in not every single app because not all
apps<00:00:13.800> support<00:00:14.010> copying<00:00:14.610> and<00:00:14.700> pasting<00:00:14.790> but<00:00:15.750> all

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
apps support copying and pasting but all

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.140 
apps support copying and pasting but all
the<00:00:15.960> ones<00:00:16.109> where<00:00:16.320> you<00:00:16.500> can<00:00:16.680> write<00:00:17.150> generally

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
the ones where you can write generally

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.800 
the ones where you can write generally
like<00:00:18.359> so<00:00:18.570> the<00:00:18.749> messages<00:00:19.199> app<00:00:19.519> notes<00:00:20.519> app<00:00:20.849> your

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
like so the messages app notes app your

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.550 
like so the messages app notes app your
email<00:00:22.230> so<00:00:23.130> forth<00:00:23.419> you<00:00:24.419> can<00:00:24.630> use<00:00:25.109> copying

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
email so forth you can use copying

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.380 
email so forth you can use copying
pasting<00:00:25.769> so<00:00:26.489> I'm<00:00:26.669> just<00:00:26.819> going<00:00:26.939> to<00:00:26.970> demonstrate

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
pasting so I'm just going to demonstrate

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.469 
pasting so I'm just going to demonstrate
using<00:00:27.569> the<00:00:27.810> Notes<00:00:27.989> app<00:00:28.140> but<00:00:28.919> again<00:00:29.159> it<00:00:30.060> works

00:00:30.469 --> 00:00:30.479 
using the Notes app but again it works

00:00:30.479 --> 00:00:32.030 
using the Notes app but again it works
the<00:00:30.630> same<00:00:30.779> basic<00:00:31.140> way<00:00:31.169> regardless<00:00:31.919> of

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
the same basic way regardless of

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.849 
the same basic way regardless of
whatever<00:00:32.220> app<00:00:32.520> you're<00:00:32.790> in<00:00:33.170> so<00:00:34.170> how<00:00:34.530> do<00:00:34.590> you

00:00:34.849 --> 00:00:34.859 
whatever app you're in so how do you

00:00:34.859 --> 00:00:37.639 
whatever app you're in so how do you
copy<00:00:35.070> and<00:00:35.309> paste<00:00:35.420> well<00:00:36.420> it's<00:00:37.109> pretty<00:00:37.289> simple

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
copy and paste well it's pretty simple

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.290 
copy and paste well it's pretty simple
you<00:00:37.890> just<00:00:38.399> want<00:00:38.579> to<00:00:38.640> go<00:00:38.789> and<00:00:38.940> let's<00:00:39.090> say<00:00:39.179> you've

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
you just want to go and let's say you've

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.660 
you just want to go and let's say you've
got<00:00:39.329> some<00:00:39.719> text<00:00:40.710> that's<00:00:40.980> already<00:00:41.190> written<00:00:41.399> and

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
got some text that's already written and

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.700 
got some text that's already written and
I<00:00:41.850> just<00:00:42.030> put<00:00:42.840> something<00:00:43.140> in<00:00:43.260> here<00:00:43.410> for<00:00:43.469> this

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
I just put something in here for this

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.799 
I just put something in here for this
purpose<00:00:44.100> so<00:00:44.640> I'm<00:00:44.760> going<00:00:44.910> to<00:00:44.940> tap<00:00:45.239> and<00:00:45.449> hold<00:00:45.480> my

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
purpose so I'm going to tap and hold my

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.099 
purpose so I'm going to tap and hold my
finger<00:00:46.109> down<00:00:46.289> on<00:00:46.730> this<00:00:47.730> word<00:00:48.030> here<00:00:48.449> just<00:00:48.870> any

00:00:49.099 --> 00:00:49.109 
finger down on this word here just any

00:00:49.109 --> 00:00:50.270 
finger down on this word here just any
of<00:00:49.199> the<00:00:49.289> text<00:00:49.559> doesn't<00:00:49.739> really<00:00:49.859> matter<00:00:50.070> and

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
of the text doesn't really matter and

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.639 
of the text doesn't really matter and
you<00:00:50.339> see<00:00:50.640> if<00:00:50.879> I<00:00:51.660> hold<00:00:51.839> down<00:00:52.019> my<00:00:52.260> finger<00:00:52.530> for

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
you see if I hold down my finger for

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.310 
you see if I hold down my finger for
about<00:00:52.800> a<00:00:52.829> second<00:00:53.249> you'll<00:00:53.370> see<00:00:53.429> this<00:00:53.640> sort<00:00:53.850> of

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:54.320 
about a second you'll see this sort of

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.799 
about a second you'll see this sort of
it's<00:00:55.320> like<00:00:55.440> a<00:00:55.469> loop<00:00:55.769> I<00:00:55.980> guess<00:00:56.249> like<00:00:56.429> a

00:00:56.799 --> 00:00:56.809 
it's like a loop I guess like a

00:00:56.809 --> 00:00:59.209 
it's like a loop I guess like a
jeweler's<00:00:57.809> loupe<00:00:57.870> a<00:00:58.230> little<00:00:58.890> magnifying

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
jeweler's loupe a little magnifying

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.790 
jeweler's loupe a little magnifying
glass<00:00:59.399> basically<00:00:59.760> that<00:01:00.449> will<00:01:00.629> appear<00:01:01.079> over

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
glass basically that will appear over

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.250 
glass basically that will appear over
the<00:01:01.829> words<00:01:02.159> and<00:01:02.489> you<00:01:02.999> can<00:01:03.179> and<00:01:03.480> that<00:01:03.690> indicates

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
the words and you can and that indicates

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.110 
the words and you can and that indicates
that<00:01:04.440> the<00:01:04.589> process<00:01:05.010> has<00:01:05.160> begun<00:01:05.340> you<00:01:05.880> can<00:01:06.000> see

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:06.120 
that the process has begun you can see

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.360 
that the process has begun you can see
that<00:01:06.240> circle<00:01:06.480> the<00:01:06.780> top<00:01:07.020> of<00:01:07.170> my<00:01:07.260> fingertip<00:01:07.680> so<00:01:08.340> I

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:08.370 
that circle the top of my fingertip so I

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:10.760 
that circle the top of my fingertip so I
let<00:01:08.610> go<00:01:08.850> and<00:01:09.170> you<00:01:10.170> don't<00:01:10.320> have<00:01:10.380> to<00:01:10.500> hold<00:01:10.590> it

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
let go and you don't have to hold it

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.110 
let go and you don't have to hold it
that<00:01:10.860> long<00:01:10.920> I<00:01:11.220> just<00:01:11.490> was<00:01:11.610> doing<00:01:11.730> it<00:01:11.940> while<00:01:12.090> I

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:12.120 
that long I just was doing it while I

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:13.940 
that long I just was doing it while I
was<00:01:12.270> demonstrating<00:01:12.480> of<00:01:12.930> course<00:01:13.140> and<00:01:13.350> it<00:01:13.920> has

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
was demonstrating of course and it has

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.940 
was demonstrating of course and it has
selected<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.550> word<00:01:14.700> example<00:01:15.450> and<00:01:15.830> there<00:01:16.830> are

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
selected the word example and there are

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.170 
selected the word example and there are
three<00:01:17.280> buttons<00:01:17.520> copy<00:01:18.060> select<00:01:18.660> all<00:01:18.960> and<00:01:19.290> define

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:20.180 
three buttons copy select all and define

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.820 
three buttons copy select all and define
define<00:01:21.180> is<00:01:21.600> not<00:01:21.840> really<00:01:22.080> directly<00:01:22.410> related<00:01:22.800> to

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
define is not really directly related to

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.740 
define is not really directly related to
copying<00:01:23.160> pasting<00:01:23.340> it<00:01:23.790> of<00:01:23.910> course<00:01:24.090> you<00:01:24.480> know<00:01:24.600> it

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
copying pasting it of course you know it

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.990 
copying pasting it of course you know it
allows<00:01:25.170> you<00:01:25.410> to<00:01:25.590> get<00:01:26.280> a<00:01:26.310> definition<00:01:26.700> of<00:01:26.880> the

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
allows you to get a definition of the

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.040 
allows you to get a definition of the
word<00:01:27.110> but<00:01:28.110> it<00:01:28.200> still<00:01:28.380> pops<00:01:28.560> up<00:01:28.800> so<00:01:29.130> I<00:01:30.050> tapped

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:31.050 
word but it still pops up so I tapped

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:32.900 
word but it still pops up so I tapped
out<00:01:31.320> you'll<00:01:31.530> notice<00:01:31.740> that<00:01:32.100> what<00:01:32.250> I<00:01:32.280> did<00:01:32.520> is<00:01:32.730> I

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:32.910 
out you'll notice that what I did is I

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:34.460 
out you'll notice that what I did is I
capped<00:01:33.360> off<00:01:33.630> that<00:01:33.900> little<00:01:34.170> window<00:01:34.290> that

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
capped off that little window that

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.650 
capped off that little window that
little<00:01:35.040> definition<00:01:35.400> bobble<00:01:35.760> up<00:01:35.910> appeared<00:01:36.480> I

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:36.660 
little definition bobble up appeared I

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:38.900 
little definition bobble up appeared I
tapped<00:01:37.380> outside<00:01:37.800> of<00:01:37.920> it<00:01:38.010> I<00:01:38.130> got<00:01:38.310> rid<00:01:38.460> of<00:01:38.490> it<00:01:38.760> and

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:38.910 
tapped outside of it I got rid of it and

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:42.440 
tapped outside of it I got rid of it and
then<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:40.710> example<00:01:41.370> the<00:01:41.760> word<00:01:41.910> example<00:01:42.300> is

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
then the example the word example is

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.750 
then the example the word example is
still<00:01:42.600> highlighted<00:01:43.350> and<00:01:43.500> has<00:01:43.710> these<00:01:43.920> bars<00:01:44.280> on

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:44.760 
still highlighted and has these bars on

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.300 
still highlighted and has these bars on
either<00:01:45.360> side<00:01:45.690> is<00:01:45.960> one<00:01:46.170> on<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.380> right<00:01:46.560> one<00:01:47.280> on

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
either side is one on the right one on

mention<00:03:35.910> here<00:03:36.420> is<00:03:36.530> when<00:03:37.530> the<00:03:37.680> keyboard<00:03:37.860> is

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
mention here is when the keyboard is

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:39.530 
mention here is when the keyboard is
open<00:03:38.280> there's<00:03:38.640> another<00:03:38.910> little<00:03:39.180> bit<00:03:39.360> of<00:03:39.450> a

open there's another little bit of a
difference<00:03:39.870> in<00:03:40.020> the<00:03:40.050> way<00:03:40.230> this<00:03:40.470> behaves<00:03:40.920> if<00:03:41.250> I

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
difference in the way this behaves if I

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:45.140 
difference in the way this behaves if I
camp<00:03:43.040> previously<00:03:44.040> like<00:03:44.220> if<00:03:44.400> I<00:03:44.550> get<00:03:44.940> rid<00:03:45.120> of

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
instead it brings up this little sort of

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:13.640 
instead it brings up this little sort of
loop<00:04:10.170> it's<00:04:10.530> like<00:04:10.650> a<00:04:10.709> magnifying<00:04:11.130> glass<00:04:11.760> and<00:04:12.650> it

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
loop it's like a magnifying glass and it

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:16.190 
loop it's like a magnifying glass and it
allows<00:04:13.950> you<00:04:14.190> to<00:04:14.370> position<00:04:14.850> the<00:04:14.940> cursor<00:04:15.200> but

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200 
allows you to position the cursor but

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.140 
allows you to position the cursor but
because

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:17.150

I have to double tap it just like that

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.010 
I have to double tap it just like that
