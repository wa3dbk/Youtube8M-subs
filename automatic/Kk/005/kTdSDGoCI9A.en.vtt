00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:56.299 
that and I I just have a big feeling

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:59.350 
that and I I just have a big feeling
that<00:01:56.930> there<00:01:57.590> will<00:01:57.770> be<00:01:57.799> some<00:01:58.280> more<00:01:58.939> information

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:06.969 
who knows hopefully big or not but I
still<00:02:05.960> think<00:02:06.259> there<00:02:06.409> will<00:02:06.500> be<00:02:06.560> some<00:02:06.680> more

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:06.979 
still think there will be some more

information revealed at this event

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:11.289 
information revealed at this event
because<00:02:09.019> Square<00:02:09.590> Enix<00:02:09.860> does<00:02:10.280> go<00:02:10.909> there<00:02:11.090> often

00:02:11.289 --> 00:02:11.299 
because Square Enix does go there often

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:14.470 
because Square Enix does go there often
and<00:02:12.220> there<00:02:13.220> is<00:02:13.340> not<00:02:13.610> a<00:02:13.670> lot<00:02:13.760> of<00:02:13.879> information<00:02:14.360> at

and there is not a lot of information at

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.150 
and there is not a lot of information at
e3<00:02:14.599> and<00:02:14.840> I'm<00:02:15.049> guessing<00:02:15.349> they're<00:02:15.470> saving<00:02:16.010> it

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
e3 and I'm guessing they're saving it

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.910 
e3 and I'm guessing they're saving it
for<00:02:16.760> TGS<00:02:17.420> this

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
for TGS this

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.190 
for TGS this
that's<00:02:18.640> what<00:02:19.270> I've<00:02:19.390> been<00:02:19.420> thinking<00:02:19.750> for<00:02:20.110> a

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
that's what I've been thinking for a

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.589 
that's what I've been thinking for a
while<00:02:20.260> they're<00:02:20.530> sending<00:02:20.860> it<00:02:20.980> 40g<00:02:21.910> yes<00:02:22.060> I<00:02:22.090> just

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:22.599 
while they're sending it 40g yes I just

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:24.630 
while they're sending it 40g yes I just
have<00:02:22.690> that<00:02:22.840> feeling<00:02:22.870> you<00:02:23.170> know<00:02:23.260> um<00:02:23.560> if<00:02:24.160> not<00:02:24.400> TJ

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
have that feeling you know um if not TJ

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.260 
have that feeling you know um if not TJ
yes<00:02:24.940> i<00:02:25.180> would<00:02:25.270> say<00:02:25.840> d23<00:02:26.800> expo<00:02:27.400> another<00:02:28.030> thing

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
yes i would say d23 expo another thing

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:30.270 
yes i would say d23 expo another thing
you<00:02:28.390> should<00:02:28.420> really<00:02:28.720> look<00:02:28.959> at<00:02:29.230> because<00:02:29.470> we<00:02:30.130> got

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
you should really look at because we got

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.670 
you should really look at because we got
the<00:02:30.430> new<00:02:30.550> trailer<00:02:30.760> there<00:02:31.300> last<00:02:31.540> year<00:02:31.660> so<00:02:32.290> i

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
the new trailer there last year so i

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.040 
the new trailer there last year so i
would<00:02:33.220> just<00:02:33.370> guess<00:02:33.730> that<00:02:34.239> we<00:02:34.510> could<00:02:34.750> get<00:02:34.870> some

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
would just guess that we could get some

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:36.840 
would just guess that we could get some
more<00:02:35.200> information<00:02:35.410> from<00:02:36.250> there<00:02:36.459> more<00:02:36.730> than

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
more information from there more than

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:38.790 
more information from there more than
likely<00:02:37.030> because<00:02:37.600> we<00:02:38.200> got<00:02:38.319> some<00:02:38.500> more<00:02:38.620> last

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 
likely because we got some more last

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.640 
likely because we got some more last
year<00:02:38.920> so<00:02:39.459> if<00:02:39.850> it's<00:02:40.569> not<00:02:40.780> a<00:02:40.810> TGS<00:02:41.319> this<00:02:41.470> year

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
year so if it's not a TGS this year

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.190 
year so if it's not a TGS this year
which<00:02:41.830> i<00:02:41.980> do<00:02:42.100> have<00:02:42.280> a<00:02:42.340> big<00:02:42.489> feeling<00:02:42.760> that<00:02:42.880> it<00:02:43.030> is

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
which i do have a big feeling that it is

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.410 
which i do have a big feeling that it is
then<00:02:44.200> look<00:02:44.620> at<00:02:44.769> that<00:02:45.130> because<00:02:45.580> that<00:02:45.819> is<00:02:46.209> where

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
then look at that because that is where

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:47.970 
then look at that because that is where
it's<00:02:46.600> more<00:02:46.750> likely<00:02:46.959> going<00:02:47.200> to<00:02:47.260> be<00:02:47.319> revealed<00:02:47.590> if

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
it's more likely going to be revealed if

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:49.559 
it's more likely going to be revealed if
it's<00:02:48.310> not<00:02:48.430> there<00:02:48.610> another<00:02:48.970> game<00:02:49.180> I'm<00:02:49.330> really

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:49.569 
it's not there another game I'm really

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:51.479 
it's not there another game I'm really
looking<00:02:49.810> forward<00:02:49.840> to<00:02:50.110> seeing<00:02:50.319> at<00:02:50.500> TGS<00:02:50.920> if<00:02:51.220> it's

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.489 
looking forward to seeing at TGS if it's

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:54.479 
looking forward to seeing at TGS if it's
there<00:02:51.730> its<00:02:52.000> final<00:02:52.600> fantasy<00:02:52.989> 15<00:02:53.170> because<00:02:53.709> we

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
there its final fantasy 15 because we

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:56.460 
there its final fantasy 15 because we
barely<00:02:54.700> gotten<00:02:55.060> any<00:02:55.390> information<00:02:56.260> about

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
barely gotten any information about

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:58.920 
barely gotten any information about
final<00:02:56.709> phase<00:02:56.830> 15<00:02:57.220> this<00:02:57.340> year<00:02:57.400> either<00:02:57.730> so<00:02:58.569> maybe

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
final phase 15 this year either so maybe

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:00.690 
final phase 15 this year either so maybe
they're<00:02:59.140> saving<00:02:59.290> it<00:02:59.560> for<00:02:59.860> TGS<00:03:00.190> this<00:03:00.400> year<00:03:00.549> too

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
they're saving it for TGS this year too

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.539 
they're saving it for TGS this year too
um<00:03:00.970> I<00:03:01.870> really<00:03:02.739> hope<00:03:02.890> that<00:03:03.040> would<00:03:03.190> like<00:03:03.310> get<00:03:03.489> a

00:03:03.539 --> 00:03:03.549 
um I really hope that would like get a

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:05.400 
um I really hope that would like get a
new<00:03:03.700> trailer<00:03:04.180> for<00:03:04.209> in<00:03:04.690> oak<00:03:04.870> it's<00:03:05.080> been<00:03:05.230> a<00:03:05.260> while

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
new trailer for in oak it's been a while

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:06.780 
new trailer for in oak it's been a while
since<00:03:05.560> we've<00:03:05.769> gotten<00:03:05.890> the<00:03:06.010> new<00:03:06.130> trailer<00:03:06.610> for

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
since we've gotten the new trailer for

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:08.490 
since we've gotten the new trailer for
the<00:03:07.299> game<00:03:07.330> maybe<00:03:07.810> we'll<00:03:07.989> get<00:03:08.049> a<00:03:08.110> release<00:03:08.440> date

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
the game maybe we'll get a release date

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.800 
the game maybe we'll get a release date
for<00:03:08.769> it<00:03:09.220> that<00:03:09.819> would<00:03:09.970> be<00:03:10.060> awesome<00:03:10.180> they<00:03:10.630> did

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
for it that would be awesome they did

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.660 
for it that would be awesome they did
that<00:03:11.019> I'm<00:03:11.980> guessing<00:03:12.220> we'll<00:03:12.310> just<00:03:12.489> be<00:03:12.549> the

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670 
that I'm guessing we'll just be the

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:14.640 
that I'm guessing we'll just be the
Japanese<00:03:13.030> release<00:03:13.569> date<00:03:13.750> because<00:03:13.870> it's<00:03:14.290> dgs

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
Japanese release date because it's dgs

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:17.640 
Japanese release date because it's dgs
it's<00:03:14.860> a<00:03:14.980> Japanese<00:03:15.430> vent<00:03:15.640> um<00:03:16.000> but<00:03:16.840> I'm<00:03:17.260> just

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
it's a Japanese vent um but I'm just

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.009 
it's a Japanese vent um but I'm just
hoping<00:03:17.769> that<00:03:18.220> we<00:03:18.310> get<00:03:18.459> to<00:03:18.519> like<00:03:19.330> a<00:03:19.360> new<00:03:19.569> trailer

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:20.019 
hoping that we get to like a new trailer
