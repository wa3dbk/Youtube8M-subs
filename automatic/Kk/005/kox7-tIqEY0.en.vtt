 Peruvians have done something that 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.140
 for them until a few years ago it seemed 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:15.510

 Peruvian and the best that you see a service 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.659
 of the brothers but they do not feel the best 

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:05.459
 kitchen I think that also our 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.979

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:11.060

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:33.900
 in exclusive areas of chile feel that 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:36.209
 for the Peruvian in some country there is a 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.400
 person who does have the mentality that 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:40.180
 I can and if it can be achieved and can 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.680
 do what 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:48.280
 there are to be thought that some later 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:48.280

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:11.800
 Accompaniment of a good Peruvian Pisco 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:14.760

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.760
 before our seasoning 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:19.750

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:26.989

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:56.209
 Peruvian service is cut into pieces and 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:56.209

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:13.790
 easy to reach this goal 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:19.079
 this is already a great opportunity that 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:21.329
 sacrifice corresponds to people who 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:23.280

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:28.110
 surely it has been difficult but 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:31.470
 under the ceviche we are going to be able to 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:33.240
 make exportable Peruvian chili lemon 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:36.180
 There are Peruvians who have transcended 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:38.700
 borders and under a problematic of a 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:41.670

 Cebiche in Chile I, for my part, go to 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:15.539
 start working on it to see the 

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:17.160
 place as well as I have the privilege of

 to capture everything in that event 

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:26.370
 here and is that the differences are forgotten 

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:28.979
 in the kitchen for a Chilean chef 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:31.050
 our Peruvian cebiche has broken 

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:32.159
 borders to see that this did not see a 

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:35.970
 cultural projection of the peoples 

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:37.919
 when you meet people who are 

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:41.159
 able to express their culture through 

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:43.380
 the gastronomy so cold so faithfully 

00:05:41.159 --> 00:05:44.840
 as you do for us is 

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:47.419
 a teaching 

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:50.000
 here does not end this journey this 

00:05:47.419 --> 00:05:52.130
 army of Peruvian soldiers chefs 

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.229
 of gastronomy came to the 

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:56.660
 prestigious technological university of 

00:05:54.229 --> 00:06:00.590
 Chile to give a chair on the preparation 

00:05:56.660 --> 00:06:02.780
 of this majestic dish before more than 500 

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:05.419
 students interested in knowing their 

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:09.440
 secret of success and especially discover 

00:06:05.419 --> 00:06:12.199
 that wonder called ceviche plus the 

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:14.300
 differences you leave all that aside and 

00:06:12.199 --> 00:06:16.130
 We are sharing experiences and 

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:20.480
 integrating us here with the 

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:25.130
 students and desire to learn 

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:27.350
 and prepare well at home does not have its 

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:29.450
 own business the struggle to get 

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:32.150
 that the ceviche is cultural heritage 

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:35.450
 for unesco is a next challenge 

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:36.830
 definitely the ceviche is the tip 

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:38.840
 of spear of the Peruvian kitchen 

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:41.240
 first enter ceviche and then what 

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:43.340
 other dish of Peruvian cuisine I think 

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:46.430
 that in this way we are working 

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:48.080
 together to achieve that great goal that 

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:51.610
 Peruvian cuisine is declared 

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:51.610
 cultural heritage of humanity 

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:58.990
 Peruvians who started with deficiencies and 

00:06:56.470 --> 00:07:01.450
 in a world of sadness leave the country 

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:04.390
 in search of a better future is nothing 

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:06.670
 easy but fortunately they found 

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:09.070
 in the ceviche the best ally to leave 

00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:11.800
 go ahead to paint the streets of 

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:14.560
 santiago red and white by that 

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:16.600
 exclusive season of our country leaving 

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:18.910
 high the name of our beloved 

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:22.060
 Peru and especially forgetting those 

00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:24.970
 meaningless differences this is magic 

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:28.890
 of Peruvian entrepreneurs this is the 

00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:28.890
 magic of the day of the cebiche
