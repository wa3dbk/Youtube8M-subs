00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.400
 Y 

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:11.530
 at age 18 I had no idea that 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.790
 study and I think that like me many 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:15.610
 people identify with my story 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:17.860
 because when I talk to them I add your 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:19.480
 to your story because because at 18 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:22.000
 years I think I do not have the tools 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.950
 to know who are more and much less 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.529
 what are we going to marry for life 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:28.750
 as good as I was playing here 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:30.849
 playing there trying a lot of things 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:32.410
 I also thought that if you do not have 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:33.310
 no idea what to do then try everything 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:35.890
 until you find something that you 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:38.410
 passionate and I had the luck of 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:40.989
 find me a book that by means of 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:42.370
 factions we could understand talents and 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:44.859
 good has departed this book that 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:46.660
 I see it right now I do not understand it 

00:00:44.859 --> 00:00:48.760
 because after he started to put you 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:50.649
 this world I do not know at best as the 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.690
 I appreciate the best bibliography 

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:54.760
 infinitely because it opens me then the 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:55.899
 door to this knowledge and good to 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.699
 from there we will look for large 

00:00:55.899 --> 00:00:59.410
 teachers I meet someone who 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:01.449
 mexico who studied with lilian started 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:03.940
 then they also do not tell me how to 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:06.790
 I mentioned is the institution at this level 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:08.290
 worldwide of this whole issue defender and very 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:10.210
 Well I think you never stop 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.550
 study and never finish learning and 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.260
 it has already worked with another type 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.690
 of tools 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.880
 and well I still love it because 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:19.140
 end to see the tool the 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.450
 main person where I apply it 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.370
 follow and I think when we understand that 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.740
 one never ends up transforming into and 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:27.480
 to be I think that's where you say that 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.520
 I want to know more takes the best for the 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:31.290
 world but for me then I start 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.260
 mainly with this tool to 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.540
 a self-discovery for a car 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:38.010
 transformation and good has been 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.640
 wonderful the way you have found 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:42.220
 with this tool just 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:45.550
 good facial communication is a great 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:47.770
 tool that helps us get to know each other 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:50.380
 accept us but above all understand them 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.150
 because it has many edges and 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.590
 especially many points of view the 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.630
 facial communication for example in 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:58.210
 us when he sees the factions we can 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.100
 know who we are who I am because 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.440
 because each faction is transforming 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.659
 as a consequence of the emotions that 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.310
 we experience and then it's going to 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:08.020
 take to make a different person 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.780
 because on the one hand we have the features 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:13.090
 to understand the feed on the other side 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.890
 we have the subject of wrinkles that a lot 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.630
 people like to call him signs of 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.010
 aging to me more I would like 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.840
 evil lines of expression as such 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.400
 because because they are the marks of a 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.660
 emotion that we have been marking of 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.459
 constant way 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:27.040
 then the wrinkles for us are going to 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:28.690
 be like this map this compass that we 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.880
 they will be marking the emotional path 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.820
 that I have to work we have another 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.800
 path that is the micro expression would be 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:39.280
 the knowledge inherited by paul ekman 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:42.100
 what he did was give then as 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:44.530
 this precision of understanding that all 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:46.510
 emotions materialize with 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.850
 facial movements some of them 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:51.280
 very minimal and that will always reflect 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:54.400
 then what I'm feeling another 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.959
 path are the spots the grains and 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.110
 well just up to the whole 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:01.750
 collection that goes on my face like 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.100
 connection to my organs then in the 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.050
 social communication also serves me 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.610
 to diagnose diseases there are 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:08.080
 evils of the most specialized knowledge 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:10.450
 but could not ethically speaking 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:12.220
 do it but then there are people 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:15.190
 specialized in defining also 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:16.420
 diagnose diseases in understanding a 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:18.400
 Also, what is happening at the level 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:21.280
 muscle by means of spots then 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:23.709
 good is everything a tool that helps 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.390
 to understand who I am how I am that 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:26.700
 I'm feeling and especially that I have 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:28.860
 what to do 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.319
 for job interviews the language 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:33.090
 body is one of the areas of 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:34.560
 opportunity on the one hand but also for 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:37.560
 the other one of the strengths that 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:39.269
 they could get to accept the candidates 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.730
 what happens humans 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:44.190
 We react by something called the 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:46.230
 Neuro in a mirror then what I do 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:48.180
 The moment I see you, it's that 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:50.580
 I begin to mirror completely 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:52.709
 unconscious your body language and your 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:55.680
 reactions then all this issue of the 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:58.319
 first impression is based on a 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:01.319
 in a reaction of what you are 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:03.000
 doing with me then I have a 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:05.760
 body language I have an image you 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.500
 you have one also this reaction is this 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.450
 interaction that occurs between these two 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.739
 reactions that we have the two people 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:13.079
 as a consequence of what we are 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:16.109
 cutting from what we are the first step 

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:18.590
 the position what happens with the issue of 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:21.150
 posture there have been investigations 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:23.190
 very interesting where they have measured the 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:25.710
 cortisol levels and levels of 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:27.389
 testosterone and they verified that the beings 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:29.280
 humans when we are in a language 

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:32.130
 empowerment body in that 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.060
 felt like more space what we 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:35.340
 does is what 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:37.350
 reduces this stress hormone which is the 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:39.389
 cortisol then when you see a 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:41.070
 job interview to start having 

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:43.350
 good posture because automatically 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:45.419
 your brain is going to get married that in that 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:46.770
 meaning you are under control that 

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:49.350
 automatically will make your face 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:50.700
 be much more relaxed then 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:52.560
 when you get an interview 

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:53.940
 I work almost always what all the 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.919
 world comes to do is is put in a 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:57.810
 armchair and almost almost instead of being like 

00:04:55.919 --> 00:04:59.580
 more empowered as you close 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:00.930
 completely why then why are you 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:03.120
 as very nervous and that makes also 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:04.770
 the face gets very nervous when you 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:07.169
 you start to relax then when 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:09.300
 you adopt a much more position 

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:12.510
 this greater space on your face is also 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:14.490
 start this one to relax 

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:15.990
 it's good the topic of micro expressions is 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:17.670
 infinite and above all interviews of 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:19.770
 work but that is an interesting item 

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:21.930
 and very important to know why you can 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:23.730
 then complement your answer then 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:26.280
 then to the best add information 

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:28.680
 and you can not detect it if you're not 

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:30.390
 seeing both of them very careful because the 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:32.310
 eye contact especially when it's very 

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:34.320
 fixed can become very aggressive 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:37.230
 from the main advice that I give in 

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:37.890
 this topic is that they see between the eyebrows the 

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:39.750
 reason 

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:42.600
 you're going to decrease a lot more like this 

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:45.340
 look that generates as much aggression and 

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:47.350
 good looking at the eyebrows always 

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:48.880
 and another of the things that also 

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:51.190
 would invite what they did is they had 

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:53.080
 his hands on the table hands simpre 

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:55.419
 to communicate our trust but in 

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:57.160
 the terms of facial communication 

00:05:55.419 --> 00:05:59.380
 would limit that before entering the 

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:01.990
 interview will try to maybe indicated 

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:03.850
 che singing because because the 

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:06.310
 breathing also what it does is that 

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:07.780
 reduce your anxiety levels and your 

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:10.810
 facial muscles are also going to see 

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:12.760
 much more relaxed then when 

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:14.139
 you are for example locating what 

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:16.120
 you do is rather like moving all 

00:06:14.139 --> 00:06:17.889
 this part so that when you enter 

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:21.100
 know how is attention then 

00:06:17.889 --> 00:06:23.680
 definitely by singing and breathing the 

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:26.470
 have a position of power above all 

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:28.120
 is to arrive with the very clear idea that 

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:30.930
 you are offering a service you are not 

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:30.930
 asking for a job
