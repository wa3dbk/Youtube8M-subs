00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
going to the trouble composition well I

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:03.679 
going to the trouble composition well I
think<00:02:02.729> the<00:02:02.880> three<00:02:03.000> o'clock<00:02:03.210> would<00:02:03.329> be<00:02:03.390> a<00:02:03.479> light

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
think the three o'clock would be a light

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.810 
think the three o'clock would be a light
slightly<00:02:04.229> more<00:02:04.469> more<00:02:05.040> easily<00:02:05.369> to<00:02:05.490> defend<00:02:05.790> I

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
slightly more more easily to defend I

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:06.889 
slightly more more easily to defend I
think<00:02:06.000> the<00:02:06.060> drone<00:02:06.180> was<00:02:06.240> actually<00:02:06.570> taken<00:02:06.810> out

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
think the drone was actually taken out

think the drone was actually taken out
it<00:02:06.990> was<00:02:07.079> moving<00:02:07.320> around<00:02:07.409> all<00:02:07.619> those<00:02:07.740> organs<00:02:08.039> on

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
it was moving around all those organs on

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.350 
it was moving around all those organs on
the<00:02:08.129> ground<00:02:08.340> alongside<00:02:08.640> those<00:02:09.000> moves<00:02:09.209> we're

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
the ground alongside those moves we're

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.150 
the ground alongside those moves we're
going<00:02:09.479> to<00:02:09.539> see<00:02:09.660> they<00:02:10.170> do<00:02:10.229> have<00:02:10.470> speed<00:02:10.770> upgrades

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
going to see they do have speed upgrades

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.390 
going to see they do have speed upgrades
and<00:02:11.459> what<00:02:11.910> a<00:02:11.940> carapace<00:02:12.420> upgrade<00:02:12.780> one

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
and what a carapace upgrade one

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.039 
and what a carapace upgrade one

00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:15.049 
when the Marines have weapons won't

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:16.479 
when the Marines have weapons won't
upgrade<00:02:15.260> so<00:02:15.680> a<00:02:15.709> lot<00:02:15.920> of<00:02:15.950> surgeries<00:02:16.220> on<00:02:16.430> the

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:16.489 
upgrade so a lot of surgeries on the

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:17.440 
upgrade so a lot of surgeries on the
ground<00:02:16.640> actually<00:02:16.849> for<00:02:17.000> her<00:02:17.090> on<00:02:17.209> we're<00:02:17.360> gonna
