but then that's going to piss off the
next<00:02:28.660> one<00:02:28.840> and<00:02:29.050> the<00:02:29.140> tricky<00:02:29.380> part<00:02:29.590> is<00:02:29.710> there's

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
next one and the tricky part is there's

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.180 
next one and the tricky part is there's
gonna<00:02:30.460> be<00:02:30.550> a<00:02:30.580> lot<00:02:30.820> of<00:02:30.910> these<00:02:31.440> ugly<00:02:32.440> frog<00:02:32.770> things

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
gonna be a lot of these ugly frog things

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.870 
gonna be a lot of these ugly frog things
in<00:02:33.430> the<00:02:33.520> water<00:02:35.190> and<00:02:36.190> if<00:02:36.430> you<00:02:36.520> have<00:02:36.640> a<00:02:36.670> bow<00:02:36.850> and

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
in the water and if you have a bow and

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:38.430 
in the water and if you have a bow and
arrow<00:02:37.150> you<00:02:37.240> can<00:02:37.390> kind<00:02:37.690> of<00:02:37.750> see<00:02:38.020> them<00:02:38.110> and<00:02:38.320> just

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
arrow you can kind of see them and just

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.710 
arrow you can kind of see them and just
start<00:02:38.650> a<00:02:38.890> growing<00:02:39.640> them<00:02:39.760> from<00:02:40.000> distance<00:02:40.450> but

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
start a growing them from distance but

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:47.790 
start a growing them from distance but
I'm<00:02:40.930> just<00:02:41.050> going<00:02:41.200> to<00:02:41.260> do<00:02:41.350> this<00:02:41.530> I<00:02:46.620> got<00:02:47.620> lucky

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800 
I'm just going to do this I got lucky

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.950 
I'm just going to do this I got lucky
with<00:02:48.010> that<00:02:48.040> backhand<00:02:48.880> swing<00:02:49.330> that<00:02:49.600> I<00:02:49.660> had<00:02:49.780> both

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:49.960 
with that backhand swing that I had both

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.560 
with that backhand swing that I had both
of<00:02:49.990> them<00:02:50.230> with<00:02:50.410> it<00:02:50.590> anyway<00:02:51.520> you<00:02:51.730> just<00:02:52.240> kind<00:02:52.540> of

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:52.570 
of them with it anyway you just kind of

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:55.140 
of them with it anyway you just kind of
run<00:02:52.690> away<00:02:52.810> from<00:02:53.230> fatty<00:02:53.710> over<00:02:54.010> there<00:02:54.190> I<00:02:54.400> would

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
run away from fatty over there I would

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.690 
run away from fatty over there I would
recommend<00:02:55.630> running<00:02:56.050> in<00:02:56.200> here<00:02:56.680> you<00:02:57.370> don't<00:02:57.460> need

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
recommend running in here you don't need

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.970 
recommend running in here you don't need
to<00:02:57.880> you<00:02:58.510> can<00:02:58.630> go<00:02:58.750> around<00:02:58.900> this<00:02:59.200> building<00:02:59.440> but

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
to you can go around this building but

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:09.030 
to you can go around this building but
it<00:03:00.280> actually<00:03:00.670> does<00:03:00.910> help<00:03:07.680> all<00:03:08.680> right<00:03:08.770> so

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
it actually does help all right so

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.160 
it actually does help all right so
there's<00:03:09.190> going<00:03:09.280> to<00:03:09.340> be<00:03:09.430> one<00:03:09.790> melee<00:03:10.690> guy<00:03:10.930> right

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
here and then a bunch of Castor's the

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.720 
here and then a bunch of Castor's the
tricky<00:03:13.750> part<00:03:13.960> here<00:03:14.050> is<00:03:14.500> that<00:03:14.620> there's<00:03:14.860> the
