00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.760
 A) Yes 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.080
 not me 

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:15.379
 in the sandy school we have bet 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:17.270
 from the beginning for a project 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:20.240
 education by relying on the new 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:22.220
 technologies and that entails educating the 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.710
 students in the use of instruments like 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:27.140
 the ipad they open a huge 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:31.300
 amount of access possibilities 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.300
 a lot of content in the network 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.780
 and it is not enough to learn to use them in 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.940
 computer because to use books or 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.879
 digital applications 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:44.469
 devotes much more time to study and 

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:45.879
 before it was an hour and a half hour 

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:48.149
 now you can throw up three and four 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:48.149
 hours 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:53.470
 faster to change books and 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:55.510
 It is much more comfortable when it comes to bringing 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:59.040
 the classes you do not have concerns of 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.040
 make the bill the day before 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.360
 the encyclopedias at home are dead 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.100
 laughing because none looks at them now 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.500
 with the ipad is for them like more 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:14.600
 simple easier then look for 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:17.250
 any problem you have questions 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:20.310
 for which you study better you can 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.289
 expand it underlines easy you can do 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.030
 notes in the books you can 

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:27.119
 take everywhere you can study in 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.350
 either side with him another of the 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.000
 advantages is that it is always in 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.789
 communication with the rest of the 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.500
 comrades if anyone has a doubt to 

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:37.130
 through the emails that the 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.130
 solve 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.619
 because last year I had doubts and had 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.150
 to wait then to get home or 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.310
 ask the teacher if you have any 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.619
 doubt in the book looks quickly in 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:50.100
 internet and quickly solves everything 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:52.310
 this makes us more autonomous 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.790
 in a word it is a tool 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:57.220
 multifunctional 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:59.500
 the ipad of a study tool 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:02.410
 very good in which the schemes are 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:04.120
 they can do they can do a lot 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:06.400
 of things helps you to organize me very well 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:08.350
 all schedules my homework and my 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.840
 notes the applications that I like the most 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:14.290
 they are music that is to play instruments 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:16.570
 and you can choose the one you want but still 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.550
 there is more not only favors the process of 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:20.880
 learning also enhances the work 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:20.880
 teacher 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:26.750
 all the work they do 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:30.860
 arrives to us via mail by means of 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:33.260
 the platform and we find it faster 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.209
 students can have results and 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.520
 be able to assess your work I correct in 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:40.560
 the moment and I can tell you that it's 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:42.660
 well that's wrong they should improve 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.220
 with the tablet we can adapt to the 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.709
 needs of each of the students 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.420
 when we meet children with a 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:51.150
 great intellectual capacity that end up in 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.410
 followed the work we have applications 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.209
 that can be given to them to continue 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.530
 reinforcing what they just learned and 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:57.239
 for those who are slower too 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.230
 we find reinforcements in 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:01.870
 Applications 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.819
 the classes have changed the teacher leaves 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.799
 to be the center but the protagonist is 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:09.459
 the student and the student without any doubt 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:11.349
 the students now do not have a class 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:13.030
 exhibition where they only have to 

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:15.370
 listen to the teacher to the students 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.500
 helps to be motivated to lend more 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:20.019
 attention in class to interact between 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.730
 them to collaborate in a learning 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:24.120
 collaborative that some help others 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:24.120
 to learn 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:28.620
 and the students think the same 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.400
 if now the classes are more 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.900
 participatory because by the use of 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.570
 ipad you can share things with the 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.610
 colleagues in different programs and with 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:42.390
 the teacher also learned better with the 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:44.370
 ipad and I have more fun and I think that 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:47.130
 the teachers seem a little more 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:51.330
 easy to explain and we understand it 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:54.000
 better and their parents telling them as 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:56.250
 at the beginning it generally scared us 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.500
 quite to all parents because then 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:00.120
 It was something new and we did not have much idea 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.860
 there was always the doubt that he was going to 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.440
 be more entertainment than 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:07.290
 study but I already tell you that he has caught 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:08.459
 You raring and while she is 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.780
 very excited with this way of 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:12.209
 studying is a new way of studying 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:14.250
 and very entertaining and very very enjoyable 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:15.850
 even until I want for him has 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:18.640
 studied with her and really 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:23.020
 then the new technologies are not 

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:25.330
 dangerous for the ipad can educate if 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:28.000
 we trained the student in that the 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:30.630
 ipa is an educational tool can 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.100
 be school failure diminished if you 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:34.900
 we train it to be a tool of 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:38.150
 entertainment only then the 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:41.090
 school failure will increase 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:42.920
 internet wikipedia social networks are 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:44.720
 realities that sooner or later 

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:47.180
 will have to face our children 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:49.730
 better if they have learned to use them with 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:53.000
 maturity and tight responsibility to 

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:54.710
 beginning when it was new at the time 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.170
 to start studying you cost because 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:05:00.770
 I dropped a social network, I'm going to read the 

00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:02.180
 sports newspaper at the beginning but 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:04.700
 now and to the truth that you go auto 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:06.890
 controlling you only see when 

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:09.440
 you have to do and when all this 

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:11.660
 it's fine but it's not an expensive resource 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:14.390
 within reach of some tricks 

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:16.970
 I think that economically we will leave 

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:19.760
 cheaper because the ipad is going to 

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:22.250
 use the results for two years 

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:24.130
 they speak for themselves until now 

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:26.090
 worked with books on paper and 

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:27.830
 currently with the ipad and 

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:30.230
 obviously if someone came to me and I 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:32.960
 ask yourself would you go back to the paper book 

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:36.680
 would inform I am very happy with the 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:38.750
 ipad would choose ipad is much more comfortable and 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:40.900
 you study better with him I would choose 

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:44.370
 between textbooks 

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:44.370
 ipad would choose the line
