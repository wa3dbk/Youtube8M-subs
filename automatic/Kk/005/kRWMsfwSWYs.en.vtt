quick little video showing a little tour

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.910 
quick little video showing a little tour
of<00:00:15.000> it<00:00:15.179> this<00:00:15.660> won't<00:00:15.839> be<00:00:15.960> a<00:00:16.020> technical<00:00:16.470> video<00:00:16.770> in

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920

any<00:00:17.039> by<00:00:17.970> any<00:00:18.150> means<00:00:18.420> since<00:00:19.050> I'm<00:00:19.170> still

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
any by any means since I'm still

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:20.720 
any by any means since I'm still
learning<00:00:19.500> about<00:00:19.710> the<00:00:19.980> shock<00:00:20.220> but<00:00:20.490> I<00:00:20.520> thought

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
learning about the shock but I thought

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.300 
learning about the shock but I thought
it<00:00:20.880> might<00:00:20.910> be<00:00:21.060> nice<00:00:21.359> to<00:00:21.740> just<00:00:22.740> have<00:00:22.890> a<00:00:22.920> video<00:00:23.220> up

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
it might be nice to just have a video up

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.939 
it might be nice to just have a video up
on<00:00:23.430> YouTube<00:00:23.789> that<00:00:24.029> takes<00:00:24.570> a<00:00:24.660> little<00:00:24.869> tour<00:00:25.140> this

is<00:00:26.010> the<00:00:26.279> O<00:00:26.310> leans<00:00:26.750> why<00:00:27.750> a<00:00:28.080> three<00:00:28.800> for<00:00:29.070> three

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
is the O leans why a three for three

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:35.180 
is the O leans why a three for three
it's<00:00:29.910> for<00:00:30.210> the<00:00:30.590> 2004<00:00:31.590> 2006<00:00:32.250> Yamaha<00:00:32.430> r1<00:00:33.710> as<00:00:34.710> you

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
it's for the 2004 2006 Yamaha r1 as you

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.130 
it's for the 2004 2006 Yamaha r1 as you
can<00:00:35.370> see<00:00:35.640> it's<00:00:35.820> in<00:00:36.000> very<00:00:36.210> nice<00:00:36.450> condition<00:00:36.480> I

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
can see it's in very nice condition I

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.830 
can see it's in very nice condition I
just<00:00:37.410> finished<00:00:38.399> cleaning<00:00:38.700> it<00:00:38.940> up<00:00:39.030> out<00:00:39.570> here<00:00:39.600> in

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
just finished cleaning it up out here in

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.110 
just finished cleaning it up out here in
the<00:00:39.960> garage<00:00:40.079> and<00:00:42.980> you<00:00:43.980> can<00:00:44.160> see<00:00:44.399> it's<00:00:44.579> got<00:00:44.789> the

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
the garage and you can see it's got the

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:51.110 
the garage and you can see it's got the
the<00:00:46.280> zero<00:00:47.280> one<00:00:47.550> zero<00:00:47.879> nine<00:00:48.320> 3-3<00:00:49.340> 4/100<00:00:50.340> spring

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
the zero one zero nine 3-3 4/100 spring

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.650 
the zero one zero nine 3-3 4/100 spring
on<00:00:51.329> it<00:00:51.480> which<00:00:51.600> is<00:00:51.809> geared<00:00:52.500> for<00:00:52.620> a<00:00:52.829> rider<00:00:53.550> of<00:00:53.789> 175

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
on it which is geared for a rider of 175

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.979 
on it which is geared for a rider of 175
pounds<00:00:55.050> to<00:00:55.170> two<00:00:55.320> hundred<00:00:55.440> pounds<00:00:56.899> and<00:00:57.899> I

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
pounds to two hundred pounds and I

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.900 
pounds to two hundred pounds and I
believe<00:00:58.230> if<00:00:58.590> I'm<00:00:58.739> not<00:00:58.829> mistaken<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.550> slash

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
believe if I'm not mistaken the slash

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:06.380 
believe if I'm not mistaken the slash
100<00:01:00.449> is<00:01:01.820> the<00:01:03.110> Newton's<00:01:04.110> per<00:01:04.890> millimeter<00:01:05.220> so<00:01:06.090> it

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
100 is the Newton's per millimeter so it

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.359 
100 is the Newton's per millimeter so it
means<00:01:06.540> it<00:01:06.720> takes<00:01:06.930> 100<00:01:07.470> Newton's<00:01:07.799> to<00:01:08.010> compress

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
means it takes 100 Newton's to compress

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.359 
means it takes 100 Newton's to compress
the<00:01:08.520> spring<00:01:08.729> one<00:01:09.060> millimeter<00:01:09.600> I<00:01:10.369> believe

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
the spring one millimeter I believe

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.820 
the spring one millimeter I believe
that's<00:01:11.580> correct<00:01:11.729> on<00:01:15.320> anyways<00:01:16.320> you<00:01:16.470> can<00:01:16.590> see

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
that's correct on anyways you can see

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:22.399 
that's correct on anyways you can see
the<00:01:17.729> shock<00:01:18.060> here<00:01:19.729> in<00:01:20.729> very<00:01:21.119> good<00:01:21.360> condition<00:01:21.960> so

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
the shock here in very good condition so

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.320 
the shock here in very good condition so
it's<00:01:22.710> had<00:01:22.890> a<00:01:22.920> few<00:01:23.009> track<00:01:23.369> days<00:01:23.640> but<00:01:23.970> nothing

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
it's had a few track days but nothing

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.240 
it's had a few track days but nothing
major<00:01:24.540> I<00:01:27.229> just<00:01:28.229> finished<00:01:28.710> cleaning<00:01:28.799> it<00:01:29.159> up

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
major I just finished cleaning it up

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.130 
major I just finished cleaning it up
with<00:01:29.490> some<00:01:29.900> silicone<00:01:30.900> spray<00:01:31.290> and<00:01:32.750> a<00:01:33.750> little

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
with some silicone spray and a little

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.440 
with some silicone spray and a little
microfiber<00:01:35.040> ring<00:01:35.490> and<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:36.090> air<00:01:36.240> compressor

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
microfiber ring and the air compressor

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.719 
microfiber ring and the air compressor
so<00:01:36.990> it's<00:01:37.110> very<00:01:37.799> good<00:01:38.009> condition<00:01:38.340> it<00:01:38.430> has<00:01:38.549> the

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
so it's very good condition it has the

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.469 
so it's very good condition it has the
graves<00:01:39.060> mouth<00:01:39.540> up<00:01:39.840> here<00:01:40.229> which<00:01:41.189> I<00:01:41.490> think<00:01:41.970> it's

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
graves mouth up here which I think it's

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.020 
graves mouth up here which I think it's
slightly<00:01:42.899> taller<00:01:43.680> or<00:01:44.070> shorter<00:01:44.100> amount<00:01:44.759> of

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
slightly taller or shorter amount of

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.429 
slightly taller or shorter amount of
cattle<00:01:45.420> in<00:01:45.509> number<00:01:45.780> than<00:01:45.899> the<00:01:46.049> stock<00:01:46.259> well

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
cattle in number than the stock well

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.910 
cattle in number than the stock well
I'll<00:01:46.890> check<00:01:46.920> when<00:01:47.399> I<00:01:47.430> get<00:01:48.090> around<00:01:48.210> and<00:01:48.509> put<00:01:48.689> the

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
I'll check when I get around and put the

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:55.850 
I'll check when I get around and put the
little<00:01:49.920> shock<00:01:50.280> on<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:50.610> bike<00:01:54.530> this<00:01:55.530> is<00:01:55.680> a

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
little shock on the bike this is a

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:01.429 
little shock on the bike this is a
little<00:01:56.299> gesture<00:01:57.299> here<00:01:58.820> this<00:01:59.820> or<00:02:00.119> here<00:02:00.750> there's

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
little gesture here this or here there's

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.310 
little gesture here this or here there's
also<00:02:01.619> an<00:02:02.399> adjustment<00:02:03.090> up<00:02:03.420> at<00:02:03.570> the<00:02:03.689> top<00:02:04.020> right

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
also an adjustment up at the top right

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.059 
also an adjustment up at the top right
here<00:02:04.680> inside<00:02:05.009> that<00:02:05.280> silver<00:02:05.759> nut<00:02:06.860> and<00:02:07.860> then

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
here inside that silver nut and then

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.270 
here inside that silver nut and then
down<00:02:08.220> on<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.429> bottom

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.310 

believe<00:02:11.640> this<00:02:11.850> is<00:02:12.090> the<00:02:12.300> preload<00:02:12.870> for<00:02:13.230> the

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:13.320 
believe this is the preload for the

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:17.480 
believe this is the preload for the
spring<00:02:14.540> but<00:02:15.540> you<00:02:16.020> can<00:02:16.200> see<00:02:16.380> it's<00:02:16.530> in<00:02:16.680> very<00:02:17.370> good

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
spring but you can see it's in very good

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:20.840 
spring but you can see it's in very good
condition<00:02:17.670> cleaned<00:02:18.450> up<00:02:18.600> real<00:02:18.810> nice<00:02:19.020> and<00:02:19.980> I

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
condition cleaned up real nice and I

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:22.610 
condition cleaned up real nice and I
think<00:02:21.090> it'll<00:02:21.180> be<00:02:21.360> a<00:02:21.390> big<00:02:21.660> improvement<00:02:22.050> over

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
think it'll be a big improvement over

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.370 
think it'll be a big improvement over
the<00:02:22.770> stock<00:02:23.010> suspension<00:02:23.540> so<00:02:24.540> I'm<00:02:25.050> looking

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
the stock suspension so I'm looking

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.190 
the stock suspension so I'm looking
forward<00:02:25.680> to<00:02:25.710> putting<00:02:25.920> this<00:02:26.070> on<00:02:27.200> haven't

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
forward to putting this on haven't

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.420 
forward to putting this on haven't
figured<00:02:28.410> out<00:02:28.440> what<00:02:28.680> I'm<00:02:28.800> going<00:02:28.950> to<00:02:28.980> do<00:02:29.160> on<00:02:29.190> the

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
figured out what I'm going to do on the

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.510 
figured out what I'm going to do on the
front<00:02:29.580> forks<00:02:30.180> I<00:02:30.390> might<00:02:30.630> change<00:02:31.500> the<00:02:31.890> oil<00:02:32.100> in

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
front forks I might change the oil in

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:36.200 
front forks I might change the oil in
them<00:02:32.760> maybe<00:02:33.690> change<00:02:34.590> this<00:02:34.860> the<00:02:35.430> valves<00:02:35.940> or<00:02:36.090> the

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:36.210 
them maybe change this the valves or the

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:38.450 
them maybe change this the valves or the
springs<00:02:36.570> and<00:02:36.960> and<00:02:37.320> see<00:02:37.590> what<00:02:37.830> kind<00:02:38.040> of<00:02:38.070> results

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:38.460 
springs and and see what kind of results

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:41.420 
springs and and see what kind of results
I<00:02:38.550> get<00:02:39.230> from<00:02:40.230> what<00:02:40.350> I<00:02:40.380> understand<00:02:40.830> anything<00:02:41.250> is

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
I get from what I understand anything is

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.240 
I get from what I understand anything is
is<00:02:42.090> better<00:02:42.390> than<00:02:42.630> stock<00:02:42.960> I'm<00:02:43.800> also<00:02:43.980> looking
