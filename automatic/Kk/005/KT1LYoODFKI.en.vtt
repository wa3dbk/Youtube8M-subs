her eyes now to further draw the eye to

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.170 
her eyes now to further draw the eye to
our<00:01:23.229> center<00:01:23.650> we're<00:01:23.830> going<00:01:23.860> to<00:01:24.190> put<00:01:24.430> in<00:01:24.549> a<00:01:24.700> sense

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:25.180 
our center we're going to put in a sense

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:29.150 
our center we're going to put in a sense
row<00:01:25.510> and<00:01:25.870> let<00:01:26.080> me<00:01:26.229> show<00:01:26.620> you<00:01:26.680> how<00:01:27.040> that's<00:01:27.220> done

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:29.160 
row and let me show you how that's done

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:35.070 
row and let me show you how that's done
just<00:01:30.160> start<00:01:30.580> from<00:01:30.820> the<00:01:30.970> center<00:01:33.840> draws<00:01:34.840> you<00:01:35.050> a

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:35.080 
just start from the center draws you a

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.500 
just start from the center draws you a
good<00:01:35.290> line<00:01:35.500> like<00:01:35.800> that<00:01:35.850> then<00:01:36.850> you<00:01:36.970> want<00:01:37.240> it<00:01:37.330> to

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:37.510 
good line like that then you want it to

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:41.580 
good line like that then you want it to
be<00:01:37.690> small<00:01:38.680> here<00:01:39.250> but<00:01:40.120> get<00:01:40.420> bigger<00:01:40.840> up<00:01:41.260> to<00:01:41.470> the

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:41.590 
be small here but get bigger up to the

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.180 
be small here but get bigger up to the
front<00:01:41.860> at<00:01:42.190> the<00:01:42.370> same<00:01:42.760> rate<00:01:43.750> so<00:01:44.620> you<00:01:44.650> do<00:01:44.980> like

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:45.190 
front at the same rate so you do like

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:47.760 
front at the same rate so you do like
this<00:01:45.670> this<00:01:46.450> is<00:01:46.660> where<00:01:46.840> your<00:01:47.020> perspective

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770 
this this is where your perspective

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.120 
this this is where your perspective
comes<00:01:48.010> in<00:01:48.250> then<00:01:49.150> straight<00:01:49.630> up<00:01:49.900> like<00:01:50.230> this<00:01:50.500> draw

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130 
comes in then straight up like this draw

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.810 
comes in then straight up like this draw
your<00:01:51.960> first<00:01:52.960> fish<00:01:53.290> post<00:01:53.620> just<00:01:54.400> like<00:01:54.490> that

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:54.820 
your first fish post just like that

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.840 
your first fish post just like that
straight<00:01:55.350> then<00:01:56.350> you<00:01:56.530> decide<00:01:57.010> all<00:01:57.400> right<00:01:57.640> my

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
straight then you decide all right my

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.170 
straight then you decide all right my
fence<00:01:58.120> post<00:01:58.480> is<00:01:58.690> this<00:01:58.930> high<00:01:59.200> so<00:02:00.130> that<00:02:00.160> is<00:02:00.880> the

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:01.180 
fence post is this high so that is the

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.470 
fence post is this high so that is the
distance<00:02:01.630> to<00:02:01.960> my<00:02:01.990> next<00:02:02.470> fence<00:02:03.130> post<00:02:03.520> put<00:02:04.300> your

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:04.480 
distance to my next fence post put your

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.810 
distance to my next fence post put your
pencil<00:02:04.840> there<00:02:05.050> and<00:02:05.680> then<00:02:05.980> you<00:02:06.160> want<00:02:06.340> to<00:02:06.490> draw

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:06.820 
pencil there and then you want to draw

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:11.040 
pencil there and then you want to draw
straight<00:02:07.360> up<00:02:07.660> again<00:02:08.350> and<00:02:09.360> same<00:02:10.360> thing

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
straight up again and same thing

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:16.830 
straight up again and same thing
turn<00:02:11.440> it<00:02:11.590> over<00:02:14.910> put<00:02:15.910> your<00:02:16.120> dot<00:02:16.330> where<00:02:16.690> your

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
turn it over put your dot where your

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.260 
turn it over put your dot where your

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
fence post is going to start and then

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:23.190 
fence post is going to start and then
straight<00:02:19.660> up<00:02:19.900> you<00:02:20.350> do<00:02:20.530> it<00:02:20.680> again<00:02:22.170> every<00:02:23.170> time

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
straight up you do it again every time

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:35.490 
straight up you do it again every time
you

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.400

be sure your fist is straight and they

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:49.090 
be sure your fist is straight and they
can<00:02:39.620> get<00:02:40.060> along<00:02:47.710> when<00:02:48.710> you're<00:02:48.830> doing<00:02:49.070> your

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:49.100 
can get along when you're doing your

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:50.770 
can get along when you're doing your
painting<00:02:49.610> you<00:02:49.730> could<00:02:49.910> even<00:02:50.060> have<00:02:50.300> little<00:02:50.510> hill

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
painting you could even have little hill

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.450 
painting you could even have little hill
or<00:02:50.990> just<00:02:51.170> kind<00:02:51.380> of<00:02:51.440> drops<00:02:51.680> behind<00:02:52.160> or

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:52.460 
or just kind of drops behind or

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:56.140 
or just kind of drops behind or
something<00:02:52.850> but<00:02:53.360> you<00:02:53.480> see<00:02:53.720> how<00:02:54.020> this<00:02:55.150> draws

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
something but you see how this draws

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.960 
something but you see how this draws
your<00:02:56.360> eye<00:02:56.510> back<00:02:56.900> to<00:02:56.930> your<00:02:57.230> Center<00:02:57.650> and<00:02:58.370> then<00:02:58.640> in

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
your eye back to your Center and then in

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:00.940 
your eye back to your Center and then in
between<00:02:59.120> you<00:02:59.480> know<00:02:59.660> you<00:02:59.720> can<00:03:00.020> put<00:03:00.200> a<00:03:00.230> tree<00:03:00.590> here

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
between you know you can put a tree here

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.700 
between you know you can put a tree here
but<00:03:01.280> brush<00:03:02.030> here<00:03:02.420> and<00:03:03.020> everything<00:03:03.560> would

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:03.710 
but brush here and everything would

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:26.130 
but brush here and everything would
gradually<00:03:04.550> smaller

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.140 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.520 

get<00:03:27.140> the<00:03:27.260> idea<00:03:27.409> of<00:03:27.799> a<00:03:27.890> tree<00:03:28.190> and<00:03:29.530> eventually

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
get the idea of a tree and eventually

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:32.170 
get the idea of a tree and eventually
you'd<00:03:30.739> be<00:03:30.890> putting<00:03:31.220> in<00:03:31.280> some<00:03:31.489> grass<00:03:31.730> at<00:03:32.060> the

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
you'd be putting in some grass at the

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:33.850 
you'd be putting in some grass at the
