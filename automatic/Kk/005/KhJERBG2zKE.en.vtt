the worst when I'm playing with people
from<00:00:38.550> abroad<00:00:38.790> like<00:00:39.450> every<00:00:40.260> time<00:00:40.410> I<00:00:40.500> play<00:00:40.710> with

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
from abroad like every time I play with

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.799 
from abroad like every time I play with
subscribers<00:00:41.309> that<00:00:41.820> are<00:00:42.030> from<00:00:42.270> abroad<00:00:42.600> not

really unusual for me to have one more
connection<00:00:48.420> and<00:00:48.750> that's<00:00:48.899> that's<00:00:49.260> not<00:00:49.500> even

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
connection and that's that's not even

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.680 
connection and that's that's not even
the<00:00:49.950> saddest<00:00:50.340> part<00:00:50.460> because<00:00:51.059> even<00:00:51.539> though<00:00:51.660> I

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
the saddest part because even though I

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.630
