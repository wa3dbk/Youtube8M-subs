 I came across this two 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.670

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.290
 Here is a liner 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.920

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.680

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:52.670
 in my opinion with different content well 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:55.109
 right here is the ink in the kit 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:04:05.609
