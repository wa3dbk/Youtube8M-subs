00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:07.120 
okay so now let's take a look at the

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:10.530 
okay so now let's take a look at the
nylon<00:00:07.750> string<00:00:08.200> guitar<00:00:08.650> and<00:00:09.040> you<00:00:09.250> can<00:00:09.400> see<00:00:09.700> as<00:00:10.389> I

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:10.540 
nylon string guitar and you can see as I

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:12.000 
nylon string guitar and you can see as I
mentioned<00:00:10.930> the<00:00:10.990> nylon<00:00:11.350> string<00:00:11.680> is<00:00:11.889> a<00:00:11.920> little

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:12.010 
mentioned the nylon string is a little

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:13.949 
mentioned the nylon string is a little
different<00:00:12.610> in<00:00:13.059> the<00:00:13.209> way<00:00:13.330> that<00:00:13.360> the<00:00:13.629> string<00:00:13.930> is

00:00:13.949 --> 00:00:13.959 
different in the way that the string is

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:17.010 
different in the way that the string is
attached<00:00:14.379> to<00:00:14.650> the<00:00:14.770> bridge<00:00:15.119> with<00:00:16.119> the<00:00:16.299> steel

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:17.020 
attached to the bridge with the steel

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:18.810 
attached to the bridge with the steel
string<00:00:17.320> you<00:00:17.470> had<00:00:17.590> the<00:00:17.740> little<00:00:17.920> little<00:00:18.520> pegs

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:18.820 
string you had the little little pegs

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:21.239 
string you had the little little pegs
that<00:00:19.029> went<00:00:19.210> there<00:00:19.359> this<00:00:19.630> is<00:00:20.189> obviously<00:00:21.189> a

00:00:21.239 --> 00:00:21.249 
that went there this is obviously a

00:00:21.249 --> 00:00:23.400 
that went there this is obviously a
different<00:00:21.609> setup<00:00:21.820> and<00:00:22.150> the<00:00:22.810> head<00:00:22.990> is<00:00:23.140> a<00:00:23.169> little

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:23.410 
different setup and the head is a little

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:27.210 
different setup and the head is a little
different<00:00:23.769> too<00:00:23.949> but<00:00:25.650> it's<00:00:26.650> not<00:00:26.919> that<00:00:27.159> much

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:27.220 
different too but it's not that much

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:28.919 
different too but it's not that much
different<00:00:27.429> so<00:00:27.939> what<00:00:28.089> I'm<00:00:28.179> going<00:00:28.300> to<00:00:28.359> do<00:00:28.480> is<00:00:28.689> I'm

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:28.929 
different so what I'm going to do is I'm

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:30.899 
different so what I'm going to do is I'm
going<00:00:28.990> to<00:00:29.109> take<00:00:29.320> I'm<00:00:29.589> going<00:00:29.679> to<00:00:29.740> try<00:00:29.919> the<00:00:29.980> low<00:00:30.609> E

00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:30.909 
going to take I'm going to try the low E

00:00:30.909 --> 00:00:32.850 
going to take I'm going to try the low E
string<00:00:30.939> this<00:00:31.659> time<00:00:31.869> since<00:00:32.169> it<00:00:32.290> shows<00:00:32.590> up<00:00:32.770> a

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:32.860 
string this time since it shows up a

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.010 
string this time since it shows up a
little<00:00:33.040> better<00:00:33.280> on<00:00:33.370> screen<00:00:33.670> a<00:00:34.060> little<00:00:34.690> thicker

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:35.020 
little better on screen a little thicker

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:37.290 
little better on screen a little thicker
easier<00:00:35.530> to<00:00:35.590> see<00:00:35.879> so<00:00:36.879> I'm<00:00:36.969> going<00:00:37.090> to<00:00:37.120> go<00:00:37.210> ahead

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:37.300 
easier to see so I'm going to go ahead

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:38.490 
easier to see so I'm going to go ahead
and<00:00:37.719> the<00:00:37.780> first<00:00:37.960> thing<00:00:38.079> we're<00:00:38.170> going<00:00:38.260> to<00:00:38.320> do<00:00:38.410> is

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:38.500 
and the first thing we're going to do is

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:43.520 
and the first thing we're going to do is
loosen<00:00:38.859> the<00:00:39.100> tension<00:00:40.949> by<00:00:41.949> twisting<00:00:42.430> the

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
loosen the tension by twisting the

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:49.290 
loosen the tension by twisting the
tuning<00:00:44.530> peg<00:00:47.219> okay<00:00:48.219> that<00:00:48.399> should<00:00:48.550> be<00:00:48.730> loose

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:49.300 
tuning peg okay that should be loose

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:50.819 
tuning peg okay that should be loose
enough<00:00:49.600> and<00:00:49.750> then<00:00:49.840> we<00:00:49.870> take<00:00:50.050> this<00:00:50.289> end<00:00:50.559> of<00:00:50.710> the

00:00:50.819 --> 00:00:50.829 
enough and then we take this end of the

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:52.830 
enough and then we take this end of the
string<00:00:51.640> we<00:00:51.760> just<00:00:51.910> kind<00:00:52.030> of<00:00:52.059> push<00:00:52.329> it<00:00:52.359> back<00:00:52.690> to

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:52.840 
string we just kind of push it back to

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.770 
string we just kind of push it back to
the<00:00:52.960> hole<00:00:53.609> top<00:00:54.609> that<00:00:54.820> string<00:00:55.149> out<00:00:55.300> like<00:00:55.570> that

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:55.780 
the hole top that string out like that

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.529 
the hole top that string out like that
and<00:00:56.589> again<00:00:56.890> just<00:00:57.070> to<00:00:57.190> reiterate<00:00:57.280> the<00:00:57.760> this<00:00:58.390> is

00:00:58.529 --> 00:00:58.539 
and again just to reiterate the this is

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:00.150 
and again just to reiterate the this is
the<00:00:58.660> nut<00:00:58.899> and<00:00:59.079> the<00:00:59.530> nut<00:00:59.559> has<00:00:59.859> these<00:01:00.010> little

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:00.160 
the nut and the nut has these little

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.560 
the nut and the nut has these little
grooves<00:01:00.489> so<00:01:00.609> when<00:01:00.789> you<00:01:00.879> do<00:01:01.030> put<00:01:01.239> the<00:01:01.329> strings

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:01.570 
grooves so when you do put the strings

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:03.029 
grooves so when you do put the strings
back<00:01:01.750> on<00:01:01.929> make<00:01:02.170> sure<00:01:02.199> that<00:01:02.559> they're<00:01:02.710> resting

00:01:03.029 --> 00:01:03.039 
back on make sure that they're resting

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:04.829 
back on make sure that they're resting
in<00:01:03.190> those<00:01:03.339> grooves<00:01:03.640> just<00:01:04.360> like<00:01:04.480> these<00:01:04.629> other

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:04.839 
in those grooves just like these other

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:08.370 
in those grooves just like these other
strings<00:01:05.170> are<00:01:05.320> here<00:01:05.500> very<00:01:06.190> important<00:01:06.840> so<00:01:07.840> put

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:08.380

there's not much to it but the first

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:31.920 
there's not much to it but the first
thing<00:01:31.060> we're<00:01:31.180> going<00:01:31.270> to<00:01:31.329> do<00:01:31.450> to<00:01:31.600> take<00:01:31.810> the

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:31.930 
thing we're going to do to take the

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:35.609 
thing we're going to do to take the
string<00:01:32.200> off<00:01:32.350> is<00:01:32.740> I'm<00:01:33.219> just<00:01:33.250> going<00:01:33.579> to<00:01:34.619> slip

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:35.619 
string off is I'm just going to slip

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:39.990 
string off is I'm just going to slip
this<00:01:36.479> this<00:01:37.479> little<00:01:37.780> loop<00:01:38.200> forward<00:01:39.009> and<00:01:39.490> then<00:01:39.909> I

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.000 
this this little loop forward and then I

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.530 
this this little loop forward and then I
can<00:01:40.119> grab<00:01:40.299> on<00:01:40.509> and<00:01:40.810> I<00:01:41.020> can<00:01:41.170> pull<00:01:41.439> this<00:01:41.590> through

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
can grab on and I can pull this through

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.190 
can grab on and I can pull this through
like<00:01:43.540> that<00:01:45.509> pull<00:01:46.509> the<00:01:46.540> whole<00:01:46.750> thing<00:01:46.780> through

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200 
like that pull the whole thing through

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.889 
like that pull the whole thing through
there<00:01:47.799> you<00:01:47.920> go<00:01:48.009> so<00:01:48.850> now<00:01:48.880> let's<00:01:49.570> look<00:01:49.689> at

00:01:49.889 --> 00:01:49.899 
there you go so now let's look at

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:53.370 
there you go so now let's look at
putting<00:01:50.409> the<00:01:50.740> new<00:01:50.890> string<00:01:51.189> back<00:01:51.369> on<00:01:52.320> okay<00:01:53.320> so

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:53.380 
putting the new string back on okay so

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:54.779 
putting the new string back on okay so
now<00:01:53.649> we've<00:01:53.799> got<00:01:53.829> her<00:01:54.039> string<00:01:54.460> what<00:01:54.700> we're

00:01:54.779 --> 00:01:54.789 
now we've got her string what we're

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:55.649 
now we've got her string what we're
going<00:01:54.909> to<00:01:54.939> do<00:01:55.090> is<00:01:55.210> we're<00:01:55.299> going<00:01:55.329> to<00:01:55.450> go<00:01:55.570> ahead

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:55.659 
going to do is we're going to go ahead

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:57.090 
going to do is we're going to go ahead
and<00:01:55.810> attach<00:01:55.869> it<00:01:56.229> to<00:01:56.320> the<00:01:56.409> bridge<00:01:56.590> here<00:01:56.829> so<00:01:57.009> I'm

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100 
and attach it to the bridge here so I'm

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:58.859 
and attach it to the bridge here so I'm
going<00:01:57.250> to<00:01:57.310> take<00:01:58.090> it<00:01:58.270> and<00:01:58.360> I'm<00:01:58.479> going<00:01:58.600> to<00:01:58.659> push

00:01:58.859 --> 00:01:58.869 
going to take it and I'm going to push

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:01.410 
going to take it and I'm going to push
it<00:01:59.020> through<00:01:59.200> this<00:01:59.320> little<00:01:59.500> hole<00:01:59.649> on<00:02:00.130> the<00:02:00.520> on

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
it through this little hole on the on

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.440 
it through this little hole on the on
the<00:02:01.570> bridge<00:02:01.780> here<00:02:02.280> may<00:02:03.280> take<00:02:03.310> you<00:02:03.609> a<00:02:03.640> few<00:02:03.700> tries

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
the bridge here may take you a few tries

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.649 
the bridge here may take you a few tries
to<00:02:04.750> to<00:02:05.200> get<00:02:05.350> it<00:02:05.469> there<00:02:05.619> we<00:02:05.710> go<00:02:05.859> and<00:02:06.299> you<00:02:07.299> can<00:02:07.479> see

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:07.659 
to to get it there we go and you can see

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:09.060 
to to get it there we go and you can see
that<00:02:07.930> the<00:02:08.140> string<00:02:08.410> actually<00:02:08.619> just<00:02:08.920> kind<00:02:09.039> of

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:09.070 
that the string actually just kind of

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:10.350 
that the string actually just kind of
went<00:02:09.250> through<00:02:09.340> the<00:02:09.490> hole<00:02:09.640> just<00:02:10.060> like<00:02:10.180> that

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
went through the hole just like that

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.170 
went through the hole just like that
we're<00:02:11.290> going<00:02:11.410> to<00:02:11.500> take<00:02:11.680> it<00:02:11.890> and<00:02:12.580> we're<00:02:13.060> going

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
we're going to take it and we're going

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.839 
we're going to take it and we're going
to<00:02:13.269> basically<00:02:14.080> just<00:02:14.560> tie<00:02:14.950> a<00:02:14.980> little<00:02:15.220> knot<00:02:15.370> it's

00:02:15.839 --> 00:02:15.849 
to basically just tie a little knot it's

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:17.670 
to basically just tie a little knot it's
pretty<00:02:16.540> simple<00:02:16.840> I'm<00:02:16.959> just<00:02:17.019> going<00:02:17.260> to<00:02:17.319> loop<00:02:17.530> it

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
pretty simple I'm just going to loop it

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:18.000 
pretty simple I'm just going to loop it
across

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
across

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.000 
across
us<00:02:18.129> one<00:02:18.459> time<00:02:18.670> like<00:02:18.879> that<00:02:19.360> and<00:02:19.959> then<00:02:20.560> I'm<00:02:20.860> going

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
us one time like that and then I'm going

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.030 
us one time like that and then I'm going
to<00:02:21.069> loop<00:02:21.280> it<00:02:21.430> back<00:02:21.640> under<00:02:22.090> itself<00:02:22.769> one<00:02:23.769> time

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
to loop it back under itself one time

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.589 
to loop it back under itself one time
and<00:02:24.340> then<00:02:24.489> I'm<00:02:24.549> going<00:02:24.700> to<00:02:24.730> do<00:02:24.819> one<00:02:25.120> more<00:02:25.150> time

00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:25.599 
and then I'm going to do one more time

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:27.089 
and then I'm going to do one more time
I'm<00:02:25.780> just<00:02:25.870> going<00:02:26.019> to<00:02:26.110> loop<00:02:26.230> it<00:02:26.379> back<00:02:26.590> under

00:02:27.089 --> 00:02:27.099 
I'm just going to loop it back under

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:31.140 
I'm just going to loop it back under
itself<00:02:27.569> one<00:02:28.569> more<00:02:28.780> time<00:02:28.989> just<00:02:29.019> like<00:02:30.150> that

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
itself one more time just like that

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.869 
itself one more time just like that
there<00:02:31.930> we<00:02:31.959> go<00:02:32.079> just<00:02:32.439> you<00:02:33.310> have<00:02:33.430> a<00:02:33.489> little<00:02:33.700> knot

00:02:33.869 --> 00:02:33.879 
there we go just you have a little knot

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:35.850 
there we go just you have a little knot
like<00:02:34.120> that<00:02:34.329> and<00:02:34.480> I'm<00:02:34.540> just<00:02:34.629> going<00:02:34.780> to<00:02:34.930> pull<00:02:35.200> and

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
like that and I'm just going to pull and

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:37.770 
like that and I'm just going to pull and
that's<00:02:36.190> really<00:02:36.489> all<00:02:36.760> you<00:02:36.879> got<00:02:37.000> to<00:02:37.120> do<00:02:37.239> to

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
that's really all you got to do to

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.930 
that's really all you got to do to
create<00:02:37.930> that<00:02:38.140> knot<00:02:38.379> that<00:02:38.650> will<00:02:38.769> stay<00:02:39.010> in<00:02:39.250> place

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
create that knot that will stay in place

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.890 
create that knot that will stay in place
and<00:02:40.329> there<00:02:41.079> are<00:02:41.349> some<00:02:42.220> very<00:02:42.670> slight<00:02:42.900> ridges

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
and there are some very slight ridges

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.800 
and there are some very slight ridges
here<00:02:43.930> on<00:02:44.349> on<00:02:44.739> this<00:02:44.890> part<00:02:45.310> of<00:02:45.400> the<00:02:45.459> bridge<00:02:45.810> but

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
here on on this part of the bridge but

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:48.990 
here on on this part of the bridge but
they're<00:02:46.930> kind<00:02:47.109> of<00:02:47.140> hard<00:02:47.260> to<00:02:47.349> see<00:02:47.530> and<00:02:48.400> so<00:02:48.790> if

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
they're kind of hard to see and so if

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.300 
they're kind of hard to see and so if
yours<00:02:49.629> has<00:02:49.900> ridges<00:02:50.379> make<00:02:50.799> sure<00:02:50.950> it<00:02:51.129> goes<00:02:51.250> in

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
yours has ridges make sure it goes in

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.720 
yours has ridges make sure it goes in
there<00:02:51.579> if<00:02:51.700> not<00:02:51.879> just<00:02:52.150> kind<00:02:52.239> of<00:02:52.329> rest<00:02:52.510> it<00:02:52.659> on<00:02:52.750> top

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
there if not just kind of rest it on top

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.190 
there if not just kind of rest it on top
I'm<00:02:54.730> going<00:02:54.909> to<00:02:54.970> take<00:02:55.150> the<00:02:55.269> string<00:02:55.599> up<00:02:55.840> here

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
I'm going to take the string up here

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.410 
I'm going to take the string up here
this<00:02:56.470> at<00:02:56.739> the<00:02:56.829> top<00:02:57.040> and<00:02:57.370> put<00:02:58.060> it<00:02:58.180> into<00:02:58.359> this

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
this at the top and put it into this

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.420 
this at the top and put it into this
little<00:02:58.720> groove<00:02:58.900> here<00:02:59.170> that<00:02:59.379> may<00:03:00.129> or<00:03:00.310> may<00:03:00.400> not

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
little groove here that may or may not

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.399 
little groove here that may or may not
stay<00:03:00.819> but<00:03:01.150> make<00:03:01.540> sure<00:03:01.569> it's<00:03:01.840> there<00:03:01.989> before<00:03:02.319> you

00:03:02.399 --> 00:03:02.409 
stay but make sure it's there before you

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:04.949 
stay but make sure it's there before you
get<00:03:02.620> it<00:03:02.709> too<00:03:02.829> tight<00:03:03.209> and<00:03:04.209> I<00:03:04.329> just<00:03:04.510> kind<00:03:04.659> of<00:03:04.720> push

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 
get it too tight and I just kind of push

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:09.020 
get it too tight and I just kind of push
it<00:03:05.139> through<00:03:05.349> push<00:03:06.159> my<00:03:06.370> string<00:03:06.700> through<00:03:07.680> and

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
it through push my string through and

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.610 
it through push my string through and
make<00:03:10.030> make<00:03:10.389> sure<00:03:10.510> I<00:03:10.540> just<00:03:10.629> loop<00:03:10.959> it<00:03:11.109> around<00:03:11.200> one

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
make make sure I just loop it around one

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:17.399 
make make sure I just loop it around one
time<00:03:11.889> I<00:03:11.920> usually<00:03:12.220> do<00:03:12.489> that<00:03:14.010> here<00:03:15.010> we<00:03:15.099> go<00:03:16.409> at

00:03:17.399 --> 00:03:17.409 
time I usually do that here we go at

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:19.589 
time I usually do that here we go at
least<00:03:17.650> once<00:03:17.920> sometimes<00:03:18.190> twice<00:03:18.459> this<00:03:19.389> time

00:03:19.589 --> 00:03:19.599 
least once sometimes twice this time

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:21.990 
least once sometimes twice this time
we'll<00:03:19.750> just<00:03:19.780> do<00:03:20.019> one<00:03:20.200> and<00:03:20.489> I'm<00:03:21.489> going<00:03:21.700> to<00:03:21.819> push

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
we'll just do one and I'm going to push

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.229 
we'll just do one and I'm going to push
it<00:03:22.180> back<00:03:22.209> through<00:03:22.510> this<00:03:22.599> little<00:03:22.900> hole<00:03:23.079> here

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
it back through this little hole here

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:27.960 
it back through this little hole here
pull<00:03:25.239> it<00:03:25.269> tight<00:03:25.629> and<00:03:25.900> again<00:03:26.620> slide<00:03:27.519> that<00:03:27.699> over

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
pull it tight and again slide that over

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:29.789 
pull it tight and again slide that over
make<00:03:28.150> sure<00:03:28.180> it's<00:03:28.449> in<00:03:28.540> the<00:03:28.599> groove<00:03:28.810> and<00:03:29.650> then

00:03:29.789 --> 00:03:29.799 
make sure it's in the groove and then

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:32.099 
make sure it's in the groove and then
all<00:03:29.980> we<00:03:30.099> got<00:03:30.250> to<00:03:30.370> do<00:03:30.549> is<00:03:30.849> add<00:03:31.209> some<00:03:31.239> tension<00:03:31.720> to

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:32.109 
all we got to do is add some tension to

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:35.909 
all we got to do is add some tension to
the<00:03:32.199> string<00:03:32.549> by<00:03:33.549> tightening<00:03:34.000> it<00:03:34.150> up<00:03:34.739> and<00:03:35.739> we

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:35.919 
the string by tightening it up and we

00:03:35.919 --> 00:03:38.759 
the string by tightening it up and we
twist<00:03:36.190> it<00:03:36.459> in<00:03:36.970> this<00:03:37.540> case<00:03:37.810> we're<00:03:38.139> twisting<00:03:38.620> it

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:38.769 
twist it in this case we're twisting it

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:41.189 
twist it in this case we're twisting it
since<00:03:39.129> these<00:03:39.310> are<00:03:39.430> on<00:03:39.519> the<00:03:39.549> side<00:03:39.819> I'm<00:03:40.199> twisting

that little groove so they don't pop as
much<00:04:10.169> so<00:04:11.169> we<00:04:11.290> just<00:04:11.440> keep<00:04:11.889> tuning<00:04:12.280> it<00:04:12.370> till<00:04:12.519> we

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:12.579

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:22.320 
much so we just keep tuning it till we
get<00:04:12.699> in<00:04:12.849> the<00:04:12.909> right<00:04:13.090> place
