00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
here we go so the first thing that I

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.320 
here we go so the first thing that I
recommend<00:00:22.830> when<00:00:23.279> you<00:00:23.369> come<00:00:23.550> in<00:00:23.640> here<00:00:23.670> is

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
recommend when you come in here is

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.689 
recommend when you come in here is
definitely<00:00:24.779> have<00:00:25.380> a<00:00:25.650> companion<00:00:26.039> with<00:00:26.400> you<00:00:26.580> and

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
definitely have a companion with you and

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.640 
definitely have a companion with you and
the<00:00:26.760> reason<00:00:26.939> why<00:00:27.119> I<00:00:27.240> say<00:00:27.449> that<00:00:27.480> is<00:00:27.720> because<00:00:27.840> you

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
the reason why I say that is because you

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.770 
the reason why I say that is because you
can<00:00:28.859> see<00:00:29.039> that<00:00:29.160> he<00:00:29.340> spawns<00:00:29.900> four<00:00:32.600> okay<00:00:33.600> there's

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
can see that he spawns four okay there's

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.360 
can see that he spawns four okay there's
four<00:00:33.840> hours<00:00:34.140> let's<00:00:34.380> say<00:00:34.410> they're<00:00:34.620> Street<00:00:34.860> he

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
four hours let's say they're Street he

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.479 
four hours let's say they're Street he
spawns<00:00:35.640> four<00:00:36.000> of<00:00:36.270> those<00:00:37.190> skeleton<00:00:38.190> Lords

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
spawns four of those skeleton Lords

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.930 
spawns four of those skeleton Lords
there<00:00:38.670> so<00:00:39.020> they're<00:00:40.020> all<00:00:40.200> pretty<00:00:40.530> beastly<00:00:40.940> I

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
there so they're all pretty beastly I

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.990 
there so they're all pretty beastly I
was<00:00:42.360> level<00:00:42.600> 29<00:00:43.020> when<00:00:43.469> I<00:00:43.500> came<00:00:43.620> here<00:00:43.950> and<00:00:44.850> the

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
was level 29 when I came here and the

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.290 
was level 29 when I came here and the

companion that I had with me is I think

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.869

a dual handing weapon chick anyway she's

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.150

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
that's one of the main reasons why I

lot of damage and it allows my guy to go
in<00:01:04.110> there<00:01:04.260> and<00:01:04.379> just<00:01:04.530> brutally<00:01:05.070> deal<00:01:05.280> damage
