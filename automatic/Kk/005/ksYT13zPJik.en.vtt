00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
for very long and so I quit and decided

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.279 
for very long and so I quit and decided
that<00:01:21.859> didn't<00:01:22.280> work<00:01:22.430> for<00:01:22.789> me<00:01:22.939> and<00:01:23.090> years<00:01:23.899> later

00:01:24.279 --> 00:01:24.289 
that didn't work for me and years later

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:26.649 
that didn't work for me and years later
I<00:01:24.500> came<00:01:24.829> across<00:01:24.979> another<00:01:25.369> book<00:01:25.700> about<00:01:26.240> the

Bates Method and this book said it

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:30.700 
Bates Method and this book said it
wasn't<00:01:28.880> about<00:01:29.149> eye<00:01:29.299> exercises<00:01:30.289> but<00:01:30.469> more

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:30.710 
wasn't about eye exercises but more

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.419 
wasn't about eye exercises but more
about<00:01:30.829> how<00:01:31.640> to<00:01:31.780> relax<00:01:32.780> your<00:01:33.079> eyes<00:01:33.320> all<00:01:33.920> day

00:01:34.419 --> 00:01:34.429 
about how to relax your eyes all day

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:37.240 
about how to relax your eyes all day
long<00:01:34.759> and<00:01:35.030> once<00:01:36.020> I<00:01:36.320> read<00:01:36.740> that<00:01:36.950> book<00:01:37.189> and

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.250 
long and once I read that book and

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.609 
long and once I read that book and
understood<00:01:38.060> it<00:01:38.179> and<00:01:38.299> applied<00:01:38.659> those<00:01:39.020> methods

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:39.619 
understood it and applied those methods

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:41.770 
understood it and applied those methods
and<00:01:39.859> not<00:01:39.979> so<00:01:40.219> much<00:01:40.369> the<00:01:40.429> forcing<00:01:41.149> my<00:01:41.270> eyes<00:01:41.420> into

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780 
and not so much the forcing my eyes into

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.440 
and not so much the forcing my eyes into
all<00:01:41.899> sorts<00:01:42.259> of<00:01:42.320> exercises<00:01:42.679> but<00:01:43.670> allowing<00:01:44.270> them

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
all sorts of exercises but allowing them

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.080 
all sorts of exercises but allowing them
to<00:01:45.079> release<00:01:45.500> their<00:01:45.829> strain<00:01:46.249> that<00:01:46.670> I've<00:01:46.850> had

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
to release their strain that I've had

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.270 
to release their strain that I've had
for<00:01:47.420> so<00:01:47.570> many<00:01:47.689> years<00:01:48.020> and<00:01:48.259> allowing<00:01:49.249> that

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
for so many years and allowing that

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.969 
for so many years and allowing that
relaxation<00:01:49.969> to<00:01:50.299> come<00:01:50.509> back<00:01:50.689> in<00:01:50.929> then<00:01:51.740> it<00:01:51.859> was

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:51.979 
relaxation to come back in then it was

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:53.830 
relaxation to come back in then it was
easy<00:01:52.159> then<00:01:52.490> within<00:01:52.789> two<00:01:52.969> weeks<00:01:53.179> I<00:01:53.450> was<00:01:53.630> back<00:01:53.810> to

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
easy then within two weeks I was back to

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.010 
easy then within two weeks I was back to
20/20<00:01:54.649> vision<00:01:54.880> after<00:01:55.880> 16<00:01:56.329> years<00:01:56.359> of<00:01:56.749> blurry

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
20/20 vision after 16 years of blurry

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.800 
20/20 vision after 16 years of blurry
vision<00:01:57.350> so<00:01:58.249> I<00:01:58.280> realized<00:01:58.789> that<00:01:59.119> it<00:01:59.420> is

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
vision so I realized that it is

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:01.630 
vision so I realized that it is
definitely<00:02:00.499> possible<00:02:00.740> to<00:02:01.100> improve<00:02:01.399> your

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
definitely possible to improve your

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.120 
definitely possible to improve your
eyesight<00:02:01.869> but<00:02:02.869> there<00:02:02.990> is<00:02:03.079> a<00:02:03.109> better<00:02:03.380> way<00:02:03.679> than

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
eyesight but there is a better way than

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.700 
eyesight but there is a better way than
