to show how different cameras fit into

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.520 
to show how different cameras fit into
different<00:00:38.670> bags<00:00:38.899> so<00:00:39.899> I've<00:00:39.989> been<00:00:40.079> waving<00:00:40.440> it

meaning to do a review of it because I
think<00:00:46.379> it's<00:00:46.530> a<00:00:46.590> phenomenal<00:00:46.739> camera<00:00:48.289> so<00:00:49.289> a

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
think it's a phenomenal camera so a

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.569 
think it's a phenomenal camera so a
little<00:00:50.070> bit<00:00:50.250> about<00:00:50.489> contacts<00:00:52.309> contacts<00:00:53.309> is

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
little bit about contacts contacts is

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.420 
little bit about contacts contacts is
one<00:00:53.820> of<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.120> top-tier<00:00:54.660> manufacturers<00:00:55.440> from<00:00:55.860> I

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
one of the top-tier manufacturers from I

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.270 
one of the top-tier manufacturers from I
guess<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.570> 8th<00:00:57.719> of<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:58.020> 70s<00:00:58.530> 80s<00:00:58.800> and<00:00:59.039> 90s<00:00:59.460> and

guess the 8th of the 70s 80s and 90s and

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.650 
guess the 8th of the 70s 80s and 90s and
they're<00:01:02.280> right<00:01:02.460> up<00:01:02.609> there<00:01:02.789> with<00:01:02.940> Nikon<00:01:03.449> and

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
they're right up there with Nikon and

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.910 
they're right up there with Nikon and
Canon<00:01:03.690> just<00:01:04.199> not<00:01:04.379> as<00:01:04.530> well<00:01:04.710> known<00:01:06.799> cameras<00:01:07.799> are

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
Canon just not as well known cameras are

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:08.630 
Canon just not as well known cameras are
very<00:01:07.950> fine

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
very fine

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.910 
very fine
they<00:01:08.880> made<00:01:09.150> a<00:01:09.290> professional<00:01:10.290> series<00:01:10.650> of

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
they made a professional series of

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.609 
they made a professional series of
cameras<00:01:11.340> called<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.970> RTS<00:01:12.600> there<00:01:13.020> was<00:01:13.110> an<00:01:13.200> RTS

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619

169<00:01:28.950> I<00:01:29.750> can't<00:01:30.750> remember<00:01:30.930> them<00:01:31.170> all<00:01:31.229> they<00:01:31.409> made

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
169 I can't remember them all they made

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.160 
169 I can't remember them all they made
so<00:01:31.799> many<00:01:31.920> SLR<00:01:32.640> bodies<00:01:33.060> it<00:01:33.479> kind<00:01:33.720> of<00:01:33.810> bottles

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
so many SLR bodies it kind of bottles

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.280 
so many SLR bodies it kind of bottles
the<00:01:34.320> mind<00:01:34.850> but<00:01:35.850> anyway<00:01:36.119> the<00:01:36.270> RX<00:01:36.630> kind<00:01:36.930> of<00:01:37.049> slots

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
the mind but anyway the RX kind of slots

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.469 
the mind but anyway the RX kind of slots
in<00:01:37.560> right<00:01:37.890> underneath<00:01:38.509> the<00:01:39.950> RTS<00:01:40.950> line

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:41.479 
in right underneath the RTS line

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:44.240 
in right underneath the RTS line
probably<00:01:42.479> at<00:01:42.600> the<00:01:42.810> top<00:01:43.079> of<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.439> prosumer<00:01:43.890> line

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
probably at the top of the prosumer line

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.469 
probably at the top of the prosumer line
whereas<00:01:44.759> the<00:01:44.880> RTS<00:01:45.299> is<00:01:45.479> clearly<00:01:45.780> a<00:01:45.899> pro<00:01:46.799> camera

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479 
whereas the RTS is clearly a pro camera

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:50.300 
whereas the RTS is clearly a pro camera
anyway<00:01:48.479> this<00:01:48.630> camera<00:01:49.079> has<00:01:49.229> some<00:01:50.159> really

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
anyway this camera has some really

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.499 
anyway this camera has some really
interesting<00:01:50.430> features<00:01:51.380> first<00:01:52.380> off<00:01:52.619> it's<00:01:53.509> got

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
interesting features first off it's got

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.980 
interesting features first off it's got
a<00:01:54.540> lot<00:01:54.689> of<00:01:54.720> automation<00:01:56.090> there's<00:01:57.090> no<00:01:57.299> wind

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
a lot of automation there's no wind

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.749 
a lot of automation there's no wind
lever<00:01:58.259> because<00:01:58.590> it<00:01:59.040> has<00:01:59.280> a<00:01:59.310> motor<00:01:59.549> drive

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
lever because it has a motor drive

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.179 
lever because it has a motor drive
built-in<00:02:00.600> it's<00:02:01.320> not<00:02:01.469> a<00:02:01.500> high<00:02:01.680> speed<00:02:01.979> motor

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
built-in it's not a high speed motor

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.240 
built-in it's not a high speed motor
drive<00:02:02.490> but<00:02:02.880> it's<00:02:03.840> fast<00:02:04.049> enough<00:02:04.229> for<00:02:04.710> for<00:02:05.130> most

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
drive but it's fast enough for for most

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:11.720 
drive but it's fast enough for for most
casual<00:02:06.060> use<00:02:07.940> it<00:02:08.940> has<00:02:09.830> aperture<00:02:10.830> priority<00:02:11.099> and

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
casual use it has aperture priority and

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.890 
casual use it has aperture priority and
shutter<00:02:12.270> priority

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
shutter priority

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.010

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:20.130 
auto-exposure else's program mode of
exposure<00:02:17.530> which<00:02:18.040> means<00:02:18.569> camera<00:02:19.569> picks<00:02:19.840> a<00:02:19.959> good

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
exposure which means camera picks a good

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.050 
exposure which means camera picks a good
basic<00:02:20.650> combination<00:02:21.459> of<00:02:21.550> aperture<00:02:21.940> and

basic combination of aperture and
shutter<00:02:22.120> speed<00:02:22.540> then<00:02:22.750> you<00:02:22.780> can<00:02:22.959> change<00:02:23.350> either

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:23.709 
shutter speed then you can change either

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:26.220 
shutter speed then you can change either
aperture<00:02:24.370> or<00:02:24.610> shutter<00:02:24.640> speed<00:02:25.240> and<00:02:25.510> it'll<00:02:26.110> do

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
aperture or shutter speed and it'll do

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
the neat features that it has I don't

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.770 
the neat features that it has I don't
think<00:02:35.260> any<00:02:35.380> other<00:02:35.470> camera<00:02:35.980> has<00:02:36.190> this<00:02:36.570> at<00:02:37.570> least

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
think any other camera has this at least

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.160 
think any other camera has this at least
from<00:02:38.110> film<00:02:38.560> days<00:02:38.800> it<00:02:39.430> has<00:02:39.700> a<00:02:40.180> focus

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
from film days it has a focus

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.410 
from film days it has a focus
confirmation<00:02:41.950> feature<00:02:42.250> built<00:02:42.970> into<00:02:43.330> the

confirmation feature built into the

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.470 
confirmation feature built into the
viewfinder<00:02:44.250> my<00:02:45.250> Karen<00:02:45.610> what<00:02:45.700> they<00:02:45.820> call<00:02:46.060> it<00:02:46.270> I

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
viewfinder my Karen what they call it I

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.260 
viewfinder my Karen what they call it I
think<00:02:46.600> they<00:02:46.959> call<00:02:47.140> it<00:02:47.170> dfi<00:02:47.800> for<00:02:48.190> digital<00:02:48.790> focus

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:49.270 
think they call it dfi for digital focus

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:51.750 
think they call it dfi for digital focus
indicator<00:02:49.930> it's<00:02:50.500> something<00:02:50.890> like<00:02:51.040> that<00:02:51.250> I'll

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
indicator it's something like that I'll

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.290 
indicator it's something like that I'll
try<00:02:52.090> to<00:02:52.150> show<00:02:52.480> the<00:02:53.430> viewfinder<00:02:54.430> so<00:02:54.850> you<00:02:55.150> can

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.300 
try to show the viewfinder so you can

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:56.699 
try to show the viewfinder so you can
see<00:02:55.450> what<00:02:55.570> this<00:02:55.720> display<00:02:56.080> looks<00:02:56.110> like<00:02:56.530> but

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709 
see what this display looks like but

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:01.320 
see what this display looks like but
it's<00:02:56.830> basically<00:02:57.250> a<00:02:57.370> little<00:02:59.220> kind<00:03:00.220> of<00:03:00.310> if<00:03:01.239> you

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:01.330 
it's basically a little kind of if you

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.210 
it's basically a little kind of if you
imagine<00:03:01.570> a<00:03:01.870> number<00:03:02.019> line<00:03:02.350> with<00:03:02.380> 0<00:03:02.920> in<00:03:03.130> the

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
imagine a number line with 0 in the

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.150 
imagine a number line with 0 in the
middle<00:03:03.340> and<00:03:03.700> 0<00:03:04.000> would<00:03:04.239> be<00:03:04.269> perfect<00:03:04.750> focus<00:03:05.160> it

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
middle and 0 would be perfect focus it

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.660 
middle and 0 would be perfect focus it
kind<00:03:06.400> of<00:03:06.489> slides<00:03:06.820> through<00:03:07.810> some<00:03:08.019> LEDs<00:03:08.670> back

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
kind of slides through some LEDs back

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:11.699 
kind of slides through some LEDs back
and<00:03:09.940> forth<00:03:10.180> from<00:03:10.510> negative<00:03:10.870> to<00:03:11.019> positive<00:03:11.050> so

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709 
and forth from negative to positive so

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:14.400 
and forth from negative to positive so
that<00:03:11.860> you<00:03:11.980> know<00:03:12.480> where<00:03:13.480> the<00:03:13.600> focus<00:03:13.930> position

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410 
that you know where the focus position

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:16.860 
that you know where the focus position
is<00:03:14.590> and<00:03:14.830> when<00:03:14.920> you<00:03:15.040> have<00:03:15.220> focus<00:03:15.640> nailed<00:03:15.970> that

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
is and when you have focus nailed that

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:18.930 
is and when you have focus nailed that
thing's<00:03:17.170> right<00:03:17.380> dead<00:03:17.620> center<00:03:17.670> kind<00:03:18.670> of<00:03:18.790> an

thing's right dead center kind of an

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:21.330 
thing's right dead center kind of an
interesting<00:03:19.360> feature<00:03:19.810> it's<00:03:20.410> not<00:03:20.590> auto<00:03:20.799> focus

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340

make<00:04:39.550> a<00:04:40.590> 1.4<00:04:41.590> I<00:04:41.950> just<00:04:42.580> haven't<00:04:42.760> bothered

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:42.910 
make a 1.4 I just haven't bothered

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:44.850 
make a 1.4 I just haven't bothered
investing<00:04:43.600> in<00:04:43.720> one<00:04:43.930> it's<00:04:44.140> only<00:04:44.260> a<00:04:44.380> half<00:04:44.560> stop

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:44.860 
investing in one it's only a half stop

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:47.400 
investing in one it's only a half stop
faster<00:04:45.400> than<00:04:45.610> this<00:04:45.760> one<00:04:46.030> I'll<00:04:46.930> probably<00:04:47.050> just

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:47.410 
faster than this one I'll probably just

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:49.380 
faster than this one I'll probably just
stick<00:04:47.560> with<00:04:47.740> it<00:04:47.890> honestly<00:04:48.070> so<00:04:49.030> this<00:04:49.180> is<00:04:49.330> a

cameras and that 3.5 lens and from
everything<00:05:29.020> I<00:05:29.169> read<00:05:29.410> it's<00:05:29.890> like<00:05:30.550> one<00:05:30.760> of<00:05:30.850> the

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:30.910 
everything I read it's like one of the

system<00:05:33.490> anywhere<00:05:33.970> a<00:05:34.690> pretty<00:05:35.200> narrow<00:05:35.500> zoom

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:36.100 
system anywhere a pretty narrow zoom

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:38.940 
system anywhere a pretty narrow zoom
range<00:05:36.450> but<00:05:37.450> a<00:05:37.510> relatively<00:05:38.020> fast<00:05:38.350> aperture<00:05:38.919> I

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:38.950 
range but a relatively fast aperture I

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:40.920 
range but a relatively fast aperture I
consider<00:05:39.400> three<00:05:39.669> point<00:05:39.910> for<00:05:40.180> constant

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:40.930 
consider three point for constant

consider three point for constant
aperture<00:05:41.110> to<00:05:41.320> be<00:05:41.410> pretty<00:05:41.620> good<00:05:42.480> but<00:05:43.480> it's<00:05:43.720> that

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:43.900 
aperture to be pretty good but it's that

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:46.500 
aperture to be pretty good but it's that
performance<00:05:44.560> that<00:05:45.010> performance<00:05:45.550> of<00:05:45.820> it<00:05:46.180> is

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:46.510 
performance that performance of it is

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:48.870 
performance that performance of it is
supposedly<00:05:47.200> equivalent<00:05:48.070> to<00:05:48.190> Prime's<00:05:48.490> at<00:05:48.790> all

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:48.880 
supposedly equivalent to Prime's at all

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:51.000 
supposedly equivalent to Prime's at all
focal<00:05:49.300> lengths<00:05:49.600> so<00:05:50.410> that's<00:05:50.770> a<00:05:50.860> pretty

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:51.010 
focal lengths so that's a pretty

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:52.890 
focal lengths so that's a pretty
incredible<00:05:51.220> claim<00:05:51.820> I've<00:05:52.180> seen<00:05:52.419> some<00:05:52.660> test

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:52.900 
incredible claim I've seen some test

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:54.540 
incredible claim I've seen some test
results<00:05:53.320> from<00:05:53.470> it<00:05:53.650> it<00:05:53.770> looks<00:05:53.980> like<00:05:54.130> it's<00:05:54.310> true

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:54.550 
results from it it looks like it's true

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:56.490 
results from it it looks like it's true
so<00:05:54.880> I<00:05:54.910> ordered<00:05:55.360> one<00:05:55.510> of<00:05:55.600> those<00:05:55.750> I've<00:05:56.110> been<00:05:56.230> kind

left<00:06:40.780> so<00:06:41.780> I'm<00:06:41.870> going<00:06:42.050> to<00:06:42.110> do<00:06:42.290> that<00:06:42.820> and<00:06:43.820> we

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:44.120 
left so I'm going to do that and we

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:47.230 
left so I'm going to do that and we
should<00:06:44.330> see<00:06:44.540> that<00:06:44.570> display<00:06:45.580> shift<00:06:46.580> as<00:06:46.910> I<00:06:47.060> get

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:47.240 
should see that display shift as I get

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:49.660 
should see that display shift as I get
it<00:06:47.360> into<00:06:47.630> focus<00:06:47.870> a<00:06:48.410> little<00:06:49.070> bit<00:06:49.340> sensitive

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:49.670 
it into focus a little bit sensitive

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:54.790 
it into focus a little bit sensitive
this<00:06:50.180> light's<00:06:50.450> not<00:06:50.720> the<00:06:50.930> best<00:06:53.410> once<00:06:54.410> that<00:06:54.620> guy

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:54.800 
this light's not the best once that guy

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:58.270 
this light's not the best once that guy
gets<00:06:55.130> centered<00:06:55.610> I<00:06:56.200> should<00:06:57.200> be<00:06:57.320> in<00:06:57.440> focus<00:06:57.740> I'm

00:06:58.270 --> 00:06:58.280 
gets centered I should be in focus I'm

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:00.160 
gets centered I should be in focus I'm
being<00:06:58.550> a<00:06:58.700> little<00:06:58.730> bit<00:06:59.000> jerky<00:06:59.570> so<00:06:59.780> it's<00:06:59.810> not

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:00.170 
being a little bit jerky so it's not

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:03.520 
being a little bit jerky so it's not
being<00:07:00.440> all<00:07:00.680> that<00:07:00.710> great<00:07:01.570> okay<00:07:02.570> at<00:07:03.080> this<00:07:03.290> point

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:03.530 
being all that great okay at this point

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:05.320 
being all that great okay at this point
I<00:07:03.650> roughly<00:07:04.010> have<00:07:04.160> it<00:07:04.280> in<00:07:04.400> focus<00:07:04.580> it<00:07:04.970> works<00:07:05.150> much

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:05.330 
I roughly have it in focus it works much

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:06.700 
I roughly have it in focus it works much
better<00:07:05.390> in<00:07:05.690> practice<00:07:05.960> than<00:07:06.410> what<00:07:06.560> you're

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:06.710 
better in practice than what you're

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:10.540 
better in practice than what you're
seeing<00:07:06.920> here<00:07:07.270> while<00:07:08.270> I<00:07:08.300> have<00:07:08.570> it<00:07:08.600> up<00:07:08.810> here<00:07:09.550> on

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:10.550 
seeing here while I have it up here on

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:12.190 
seeing here while I have it up here on
the<00:07:10.790> right<00:07:10.940> hand<00:07:10.970> side<00:07:11.480> that's<00:07:11.720> exposure

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:12.200 
the right hand side that's exposure

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:14.710 
the right hand side that's exposure
information<00:07:13.040> and<00:07:13.310> a<00:07:13.970> little<00:07:14.180> up<00:07:14.300> and<00:07:14.480> down

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:14.720 
information and a little up and down

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:17.020 
information and a little up and down
arrow<00:07:15.080> I<00:07:15.530> guess<00:07:15.740> right<00:07:15.950> now<00:07:16.190> I<00:07:16.550> can't<00:07:17.000> really

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:17.030 
arrow I guess right now I can't really

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:18.760 
arrow I guess right now I can't really
tell<00:07:17.420> I'm<00:07:17.660> kind<00:07:17.960> of<00:07:17.990> looking<00:07:18.140> at<00:07:18.380> the<00:07:18.470> back<00:07:18.620> of

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:18.770 
tell I'm kind of looking at the back of

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:20.980 
tell I'm kind of looking at the back of
the<00:07:18.830> camera<00:07:19.100> looks<00:07:20.000> like<00:07:20.150> a<00:07:20.180> down<00:07:20.450> arrow<00:07:20.480> it's

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:20.990 
the camera looks like a down arrow it's

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:23.140 
the camera looks like a down arrow it's
tell<00:07:21.170> me<00:07:21.320> that's<00:07:21.740> underexposed<00:07:22.370> you

00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:23.150 
tell me that's underexposed you

00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:24.550 
tell me that's underexposed you
basically<00:07:23.510> want<00:07:23.750> to<00:07:23.810> get<00:07:23.930> the<00:07:24.110> up<00:07:24.230> and<00:07:24.410> down

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:24.560 
basically want to get the up and down

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:27.010 
basically want to get the up and down
arrow<00:07:24.940> displayed<00:07:25.940> at<00:07:26.120> the<00:07:26.240> same<00:07:26.450> time<00:07:26.720> and<00:07:26.900> you

00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:27.020 
arrow displayed at the same time and you

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:28.150 
arrow displayed at the same time and you
have<00:07:27.140> a<00:07:27.170> good<00:07:27.350> exposure<00:07:27.680> when<00:07:28.010> you're

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:28.160 
have a good exposure when you're

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:31.600 
have a good exposure when you're
shooting<00:07:28.340> in<00:07:28.580> manual<00:07:28.790> mode<00:07:30.250> and<00:07:31.250> you<00:07:31.400> can<00:07:31.430> see

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:31.610 
shooting in manual mode and you can see

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:34.350 
shooting in manual mode and you can see
that<00:07:31.970> this<00:07:32.060> guy<00:07:32.300> uses<00:07:32.660> a<00:07:32.690> split<00:07:33.140> image

00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:34.360 
that this guy uses a split image

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:36.700 
that this guy uses a split image
focusing<00:07:35.360> mechanism<00:07:35.480> as<00:07:36.050> well<00:07:36.230> which<00:07:36.530> is<00:07:36.680> a

00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:36.710 
focusing mechanism as well which is a

00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:39.550 
focusing mechanism as well which is a
pretty<00:07:36.950> accurate<00:07:37.190> way<00:07:37.550> to<00:07:37.610> focus<00:07:37.990> so<00:07:38.990> you

00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:39.560 
pretty accurate way to focus so you

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:41.260 
pretty accurate way to focus so you
don't<00:07:39.740> really<00:07:39.920> need<00:07:40.190> that<00:07:40.250> display<00:07:40.820> it's<00:07:41.060> just

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:41.270 
don't really need that display it's just

00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:44.290 
don't really need that display it's just
a<00:07:41.390> nice<00:07:41.600> confirmation
