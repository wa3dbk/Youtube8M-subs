00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.660
 happy 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.700
 hello everyone and welcome 1 video of 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.219
 guide because a new gp is built 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.959
 because if you quarantine to be boys 150 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.150
 years to continue and support this 

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:19.920
 good series remember that there is the series 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.380
 where we bring the analyzes of my 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.150
 pokemon just as I use them and this 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.089
 it does not mean that there are sets with 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.070
 this one is better or worse than any other 

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:31.259
 well said that we go with the 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.020
 pokemon today because the good me 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:37.440
 recommended a I asked a subscriber and 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.750
 the truth is that I wanted to bring it 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.940
 because it 's a pokémon that I use a lot and 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.770
 quite pretty good and in this 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.680
 occasion we bring to hip hop a 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.600
 Pokémon of pure earth type so 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.550
 well we know what team you are a good 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.219
 defensive is also a good pivot 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.469
 let's say and I think we're going to have 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.600
 to start with his statistics we're going to 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.219
 start looking at the statistics but 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.809
 defensive 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.149
 we started by the health points has 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.640
 108 base is pretty high really 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:08.550
 for a good put a defensive as it goes 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.840
 to be we also have a high one 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:12.420
 defense which is why it stands out 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.460
 basically 118 base 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.770
 and to the new one we have access 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.990
 special of 72 that is now somewhat better 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.229
 a little below the average but that 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.479
 it's not so so bad either then what 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:27.450
 what are we going to do in this video 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.070
 I'm going to offer two different sets that 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.200
 in addition only two sets that I use worth 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.330
 so then you, because he's the one 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.619
 you want as I said these are the 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.720
 statistics that you have with the part 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.450
 defensive highlighting in puree highlighting 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.520
 health points and in defense by 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.610
 the offensive part because we have the 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.409
 attack that without touching it already has 112 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.929
 of base and it is true that it is quite 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:51.299
 well for a defensive pokémon that is 

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:53.280
 one has a lot of attack and that's why 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.649
 that with the attacks that we are going to see without 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.860
 invest in this in this parameter let's 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:01.679
 to have equally let's do a lot 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.789
 damage is worth with 112 base attack after 

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:04.649
 we have the special attack that 

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:06.690
 obviously we do not care and a defense 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:09.479
 a pretty bad speed 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:12.600
 but it is something to hope to focus 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:15.060
 bulqize wall physical or mixed 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.490
 that's why as I said this set the 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.710
 first thing we're going to see is a mixed set 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:21.660
 this does not mean is that it is a 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:23.640
 pokémon is basically the set that most 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:26.190
 like because with this we can receive 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.290
 blows we should give the parties both be 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.030
 on the special side like the physical the 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.600
 set that I recommend because it's with 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:35.040
 cautious nature that what it does is that 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:37.290
 Maximize our our defense 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.700
 special for since our defense is 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.680
 the best that we have then let's give it 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.270
 a little more support to the other 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.660
 special defense then we're going to 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:47.760
 maximize the 252 effort points in 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:52.020
 the health points are worth to have it at 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:54.420
 maximum and receive more fine and also 196 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:56.730
 in the special defense and the rest in the 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:03:00.270
 defense as I said let's end with 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:03.540
 a 420 from the health point 287 of 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:05.850
 defense and 251 defense attacks 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.980
 specials what leaves almost more or less 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:10.320
 even and we can receive blows from both 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.670
 sides to more than a few health points very 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.680
 very very good 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.390
 so if he could so we're going to 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.010
 do is also put the rest is worth 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:19.230
 He has great skill and it is a storm 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:22.080
 of sand and that also good is used 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:26.010
 sometimes in what equipment d 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:27.720
 of land or environment of an ex lane and 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.090
 all this with impetuous sand put 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.910
 doubly remains because maybe in the 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:35.250
 soft rock but good that's another 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:37.740
 thing let's talk to him about the 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:40.470
 attacks we start with loose movement 

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:42.960
 that recover 50% of the points of 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:45.120
 maximum health of hip hop 2 which is a 

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:47.310
 movement that we have in the yes or yes to the 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.320
 just like trap rocks are we know 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:51.630
 supposedly or from my point of view 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:55.020
 is the hazard the best hazard of all 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:57.570
 the rock traps themselves after we have 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:59.880
 earthquake to be and with a great attack 

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:02.820
 of base 112 we will do much much 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:04.770
 more damage than you expected and 

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:07.020
 finally, we have several options 

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:08.940
 as a last movement I will explain 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:11.100
 why I have now before I had 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:13.080
 swirl and I've even put 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:15.570
 here fang ice that serves us to 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:17.489
 the cndh horus for the score and things from 

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:20.220
 but recently, I've put 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:22.800
 avalanche avalanche well it was fine 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:24.810
 for this purpose for example to dump 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:27.480
 one when I was in under views and 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:30.240
 because basically they are life 

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:31.890
 to rock type attacks then 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:34.050
 that's why I have avalanche now it's a good 

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:36.300
 coverage movement and that's why 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:38.340
 I recommend it also if not, then we can 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:40.140
 put whirlpool that with the combo of 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:42.380
 trap swirl rocks well let's go 

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:45.120
 let's go to do a lot of damage 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:46.460
 basically unintentionally worth that trap 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:48.570
 Swirling rocks and water 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:50.100
 just if we know when not to 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:52.140
 put a pokémon that causes us 

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:54.720
 you can throw him out of the fight and so 

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:56.910
 then go doing residual damage to everything 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:58.230
 the team and basically already as I said the 

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:02.100
 last attack is with me ice for 

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:04.080
 other walls that are ice type but 

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:05.670
 good as I said I'm lately 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:07.650
 using avalanche that is that the best 

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:09.110
 attack that goes to me and is the one that 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:11.150
 I recommend 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:13.610
 already after this was the first set the 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:16.850
 second set I had thought about or the one that 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:19.520
 use I am basically the same attacks 

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:22.010
 exactly the same what the points 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:25.180
 of effort are at maximum points of 

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:28.520
 health and in defense and a nature 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:30.560
 agitated in English is called in peace yes 

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:33.680
 bad I do not remember there it is and simply 

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:37.580
 they would be a set of the physical world 

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:39.290
 pure and hard with 368 defense what 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:41.810
 let's leave so it's still a good 

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:43.460
 set good value a good defensive wall 

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:45.410
 that will continue a lot to forget 

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:47.450
 hold it very well but it also comes 

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:49.670
 under preference if you want one 

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:51.440
 totally defensive or a mixed one too 

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:53.060
 turning it into a pivot as I said to the 

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:55.730
 beginning of the video you can receive 

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:57.650
 attacks on either side so good 

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:59.240
 guys up here the video today I hope 

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:01.400
