paper<00:05:07.129> ends<00:05:07.429> oil<00:05:07.609> really<00:05:08.239> bad<00:05:10.989> and<00:05:11.989> you<00:05:12.559> just

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:12.679 
paper ends oil really bad and you just

00:05:12.679 --> 00:05:16.090 
paper ends oil really bad and you just
like<00:05:12.829> a<00:05:12.919> knock<00:05:13.159> in<00:05:13.489> it

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:16.100 

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:18.310 

but<00:05:16.670> this<00:05:16.850> engine<00:05:17.180> was<00:05:17.300> actually<00:05:17.750> replaced<00:05:18.140> in

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:18.320 
but this engine was actually replaced in

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:25.120 
but this engine was actually replaced in
1988<00:05:19.150> and<00:05:20.150> this<00:05:20.360> crack<00:05:20.600> is<00:05:22.060> 72<00:05:23.060> ersal<00:05:24.130> and

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:25.130 
1988 and this crack is 72 ersal and

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:28.540 
1988 and this crack is 72 ersal and
that's<00:05:25.840> kind<00:05:26.840> estimating<00:05:27.470> that's<00:05:28.130> and<00:05:28.340> it<00:05:28.400> was

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:28.550 
that's kind estimating that's and it was

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:30.720 
that's kind estimating that's and it was
built

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:30.730 
built

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:37.700 
built
yeah<00:05:31.730> strangely<00:05:32.390> enough

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:37.710 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:41.870 

better<00:05:38.250> get<00:05:38.400> around<00:05:38.669> to<00:05:40.580> pulling<00:05:41.580> water<00:05:41.729> out

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:41.880 
better get around to pulling water out

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:44.360 
better get around to pulling water out
of<00:05:42.030> that<00:05:42.590> putting<00:05:43.590> that<00:05:43.680> one<00:05:43.919> in

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:44.370 
of that putting that one in

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:47.330 
of that putting that one in
