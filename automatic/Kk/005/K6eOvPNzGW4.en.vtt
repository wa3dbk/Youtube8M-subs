00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.370 
eat the stalk and roots and the roots
are<00:00:38.280> very<00:00:38.340> valuable<00:00:39.120> as<00:00:39.660> survival<00:00:40.079> food

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:40.380 
are very valuable as survival food

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:43.430 
are very valuable as survival food
because<00:00:40.770> they<00:00:40.980> contain<00:00:41.399> a<00:00:41.610> lot<00:00:41.640> of<00:00:41.880> starch<00:00:42.440> if

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
because they contain a lot of starch if

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.170 
because they contain a lot of starch if
you<00:00:43.890> want<00:00:44.070> to<00:00:44.190> get<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.460> roots<00:00:44.670> out<00:00:44.820> of<00:00:45.060> the

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
you want to get the roots out of the

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.030 
you want to get the roots out of the
plan<00:00:45.390> it's<00:00:45.690> no<00:00:45.870> use<00:00:45.900> to<00:00:46.380> rip<00:00:46.530> out<00:00:46.650> the<00:00:46.800> plant

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:47.040 
plan it's no use to rip out the plant

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.040 
plan it's no use to rip out the plant
because<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:47.460> roots<00:00:48.090> are<00:00:48.210> going<00:00:48.360> to<00:00:48.540> break<00:00:48.750> so

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
because the roots are going to break so

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.810 
because the roots are going to break so
it's<00:00:49.320> important<00:00:49.770> that<00:00:49.800> you<00:00:49.980> dig<00:00:50.220> down<00:00:50.430> to<00:00:50.580> the

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
it's important that you dig down to the

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.210 
it's important that you dig down to the
roots<00:00:51.000> in<00:00:51.720> a<00:00:51.930> real<00:00:52.110> survival<00:00:52.470> situation<00:00:53.160> you

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:53.220 
roots in a real survival situation you

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.040 
roots in a real survival situation you
don't<00:00:53.370> have<00:00:53.640> a<00:00:53.670> shovel<00:00:53.940> with<00:00:54.330> you<00:00:54.540> and<00:00:54.750> that's

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:02.700 
plants are all connected the root is

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.179 
plants are all connected the root is
going<00:01:02.820> from<00:01:03.090> one<00:01:03.329> plant<00:01:03.660> to<00:01:03.780> another<00:01:03.979> okay<00:01:04.979> I

00:01:54.389 --> 00:01:54.399 
the starch now let's see how the roots

00:01:54.399 --> 00:02:03.300 
the starch now let's see how the roots
taste<00:02:00.360> they<00:02:01.360> don't<00:02:01.570> have<00:02:01.720> a<00:02:01.750> lot<00:02:01.990> of<00:02:02.020> flavor<00:02:02.310> so

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:06.369 
now let's see how the roots taste over

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:19.630 
now let's see how the roots taste over
fire

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.160

earlier<00:02:25.340> cattail<00:02:26.340> fluff<00:02:26.370> is<00:02:26.940> a<00:02:27.000> flash<00:02:27.630> tinder

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
earlier cattail fluff is a flash tinder

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.290 
earlier cattail fluff is a flash tinder
so<00:02:28.620> you<00:02:28.680> really<00:02:29.100> should<00:02:29.280> prepare<00:02:29.700> your<00:02:29.850> second

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
so you really should prepare your second

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.330 
so you really should prepare your second
timber<00:02:30.660> before<00:02:31.080> you<00:02:31.260> ignites<00:02:31.740> the<00:02:32.040> flash

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
timber before you ignites the flash

00:02:32.340 --> 00:03:18.009 
timber before you ignites the flash
tinder

00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:18.019 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:20.750

00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:25.319 
nap for about 20 minutes and first I

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:31.580 
nap for about 20 minutes and first I
want<00:03:25.439> to<00:03:25.560> try<00:03:25.769> the<00:03:25.829> stock<00:03:26.220> here<00:03:30.409> tastes<00:03:31.409> very

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
want to try the stock here tastes very

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:38.559 
want to try the stock here tastes very
good<00:03:31.799> actually

00:03:38.559 --> 00:03:38.569 

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:41.660 

especially<00:03:39.569> this<00:03:39.750> inner<00:03:40.019> part<00:03:40.290> here<00:03:40.650> is<00:03:40.799> very

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
especially this inner part here is very

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:54.050 
especially this inner part here is very
good<00:03:42.329> and<00:03:42.540> soft

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.120 

that's<00:03:54.660> how<00:03:54.840> the<00:03:54.900> route<00:03:55.200> looks<00:03:55.560> from<00:03:55.860> the

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
that's how the route looks from the

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:05.280 
that's how the route looks from the
inside

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:07.800 

I<00:04:05.319> think<00:04:06.010> that<00:04:06.220> cattail<00:04:06.819> is<00:04:07.030> a<00:04:07.090> great<00:04:07.420> survival

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:07.810 
I think that cattail is a great survival

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:10.289 
I think that cattail is a great survival
food<00:04:07.930> you<00:04:08.260> can<00:04:08.440> eat<00:04:08.739> both<00:04:09.099> the<00:04:09.430> stalk<00:04:09.760> and<00:04:09.970> the

00:04:10.289 --> 00:04:10.299 
food you can eat both the stalk and the

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:14.420 
food you can eat both the stalk and the
root<00:04:10.510> and<00:04:11.610> you<00:04:12.610> have<00:04:12.760> great<00:04:13.150> tinder<00:04:13.510> material

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
root and you have great tinder material

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:18.080 
root and you have great tinder material
from<00:04:15.430> the<00:04:15.700> caterer<00:04:16.120> fluff<00:04:16.510> and<00:04:16.810> besides<00:04:17.590> that

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
from the caterer fluff and besides that

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.819 
from the caterer fluff and besides that
the<00:04:19.090> roots<00:04:19.389> come<00:04:19.720> with<00:04:19.989> a<00:04:20.199> lot<00:04:20.320> of<00:04:20.470> starch
