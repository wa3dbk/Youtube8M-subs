00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:12.500 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:18.140 

take<00:04:13.500> a<00:04:13.530> nice<00:04:13.799> piece<00:04:14.340> of<00:04:14.400> the<00:04:14.700> long<00:04:15.209> part<00:04:17.150> the

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
take a nice piece of the long part the

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:19.879 
take a nice piece of the long part the
seared<00:04:18.419> lung<00:04:18.630> really<00:04:18.870> helped<00:04:19.109> on<00:04:19.260> top<00:04:19.470> the

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:19.889

seared lung really helped on top the
salad<00:04:20.220> I<00:04:20.579> would<00:04:21.419> think<00:04:21.600> it's<00:04:21.780> liver<00:04:22.190> you<00:04:23.190> know

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310

if<00:04:23.490> I<00:04:23.610> had<00:04:23.760> if<00:04:24.000> I<00:04:24.120> hadn't<00:04:24.330> been<00:04:24.389> told<00:04:24.570> her<00:04:24.750> made

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
if I had if I hadn't been told her made

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:25.159 
if I had if I hadn't been told her made
it

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:25.169 
it

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:26.600 
it
I<00:04:25.199> would<00:04:25.530> I<00:04:25.770> would<00:04:25.800> think<00:04:26.070> that<00:04:26.190> there<00:04:26.490> was

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
I would I would think that there was

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:34.500 
I would I would think that there was
just<00:04:26.880> some<00:04:27.630> sort<00:04:28.020> of<00:04:28.139> liver<00:04:28.380> and<00:04:28.740> in<00:04:29.160> it

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:34.510 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:37.870 

yeah<00:04:35.510> I<00:04:35.540> picked<00:04:35.930> my<00:04:36.110> roommate<00:04:36.500> Dave<00:04:37.220> Dvorak

gets<00:04:40.070> passed<00:04:40.580> over<00:04:40.940> I<00:04:40.970> think<00:04:41.120> it's<00:04:41.600> edible<00:04:41.930> but

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:42.350 
gets passed over I think it's edible but

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:45.130 
gets passed over I think it's edible but
people<00:04:42.740> just<00:04:43.040> would<00:04:43.520> think<00:04:43.730> it's<00:04:43.850> a<00:04:43.940> weed<00:04:44.150> it's
