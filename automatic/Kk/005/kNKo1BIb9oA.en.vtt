00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.900
 they changed it hello lab friends 

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:14.650
 Thanks for joining us again 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:16.410
 our channel 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:19.660
 today we will prepare some worthy 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.910
 meatballs in tomato sauce well 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:24.939
 mexican the difference of today 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:27.460
 so we'll use oatmeal instead 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:29.829
 of rice which gives it a flavor 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:32.110
 delicious and different than what 

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:34.540
 we commonly know, I hope it's from 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.899
 your liking because these will be passed on 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:36.899
 grinders 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:43.540
 the ingredients are pepper for 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:46.040
 season 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.940
 approximately 600 grams of tomato 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:51.650
 Red 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:54.810
 a medium onion 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:57.040
 two cloves of garlic 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:59.890
 an egg 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:02.290
 raw is obviously not cooked is not a 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:05.330
 oat hard egg because we're going to 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:07.410
 replace rice with oats 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:12.010
 salt to taste 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:15.210
 and half a kilo of pork and a half 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:17.400
 kilo of beef in total kilo 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:21.479
 let's start adding the meat to a 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.950
 container and mix perfectly 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.500
 to integrate the two types of 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.710
 meat we add half onion in the 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.710
 blender 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.470
 a clove of garlic 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:39.820
 and salt to taste 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.820
 we add only a trickle of water 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:46.740
 liquefy we have until it is until it 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:46.740
 generate a paste 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:57.000
 we add our liquefied pasta to the 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:02:00.020
 meat and we will come back perfectly to 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.020
 that integrates with them 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.580
 they never come to have clean hands 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.580
 to be able to do this 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:10.750
 pepper to taste 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:22.870
 we add oats 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:25.180
 just like the pepper that all 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:29.200
 the ingredients mix well with the 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:32.020
 meat once mixed the ingredients 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:35.530
 more or less this texture is what 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:38.230
 we must do and we will make more balls or 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:42.480
 less than this size of approximately 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.480
 about 4 centimeters in diameter 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:49.290
 we are ready we will add the tomato to 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.819
 our blender but before 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.650
 add it we are going to give you a small 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:55.500
 chopped so that the blender does not 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.660
 choke in the same blender where 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.720
 We made the pasta with garlic onion and salt 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:03.530
 without rinsing the let's add the other 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.530
 half of the onion 

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:09.880
 we undo it a bit we add the 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:11.620
 already chopped tomato 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.630
 remember that we apply it so that 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.050
 get stuck in our onion we add the 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:16.050
 garlic clove 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:20.110
 and to season something that we forget 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:23.120
 mention in our ingredients 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:26.240
 about 2 tablespoons of broth 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:29.330
 chicken powder 2 tablespoons and 

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:32.819
 we liquefy we are going to add water 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:35.959
 approximately half a liter 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:35.959
 to liquefy 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:41.709
 let's not forget that we should not fill 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.230
 completely the blender and we should 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:47.200
 leave a space of approximately three 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:50.170
 fingers before it is filled before 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:52.840
 spill the liquid to prevent 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:54.870
 do not splash the content everywhere 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:58.380
 that explodes as if it were a bomb 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.380
 we cover and liquefy 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:07.470
 in a hot pan add 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:09.800
 our tomato puree that we just 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.800
 liquefy 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:23.139
 we add more or less a liter of water and 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:26.220
 cover to start boiling and 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:29.169
 season once it started to boil 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:34.050
 we lower the flame more or less in half 

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:34.050
 to prevent it from boiling wildly 

00:04:34.689 --> 00:04:41.480
 once we add the salt 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:44.330
 we add our meat balls 

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:47.240
 our meatballs so that those are in 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:49.970
 together with the caldillo 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:51.750
 remember if you like the spicy you can 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:55.700
 add 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:55.700
 half can of chipotle chile 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:02.590
 when making the caldillo for what 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:05.100
 have that itch that we like the 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:05.100
 Mexicans 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:10.409
 once we add all the 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:13.529
 meatballs cover again 

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:16.739
 we lower the fire so that it is more or 

00:05:13.529 --> 00:05:18.689
 less should boil well should this 

00:05:16.739 --> 00:05:22.199
 it will take us between 30 minutes and one 

00:05:18.689 --> 00:05:24.389
 time however we will have to be 

00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:26.789
 constantly testing to rectify 

00:05:24.389 --> 00:05:28.739
 total may be less time that we 

00:05:26.789 --> 00:05:30.959
 take depends on your stove depends 

00:05:28.739 --> 00:05:33.719
 also obviously from the pan spread 

00:05:30.959 --> 00:05:36.959
 hoisting and good we'll try once 

00:05:33.719 --> 00:05:39.029
 let's go down in the fire we will try some each 

00:05:36.959 --> 00:05:42.089
 15 minutes approximately to try 

00:05:39.029 --> 00:05:44.579
 of salt have been more or less 10 minutes 

00:05:42.089 --> 00:05:45.809
 since they started to go well already 

00:05:44.579 --> 00:05:48.329
 they begin to see very well our 

00:05:45.809 --> 00:05:51.479
 meatballs the aroma is fabulous good 

00:05:48.329 --> 00:05:53.909
 let's try in a little while more to 

00:05:51.479 --> 00:05:56.819
 know if it is necessary to rectify with salt 

00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:59.249
 or if we keep going maybe not 

00:05:56.819 --> 00:06:00.719
 we have to wait 45 minutes for 

00:05:59.249 --> 00:06:02.939
 that this is already and after having 

00:06:00.719 --> 00:06:07.769
 served approximately 40 or 45 minutes 

00:06:02.939 --> 00:06:10.139
 you see the brand of the pan of what 

00:06:07.769 --> 00:06:12.479
 it was consumed of what the broth was reduced 

00:06:10.139 --> 00:06:16.039
 and well, it 's time to serve because 

00:06:12.479 --> 00:06:16.039
 these meatballs are already cooked 

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:22.240
 and now let's try 

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:26.129
 but we are not here to promote 

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:26.129
 our broth our health and gas 

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:47.849
 can not be 

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:49.949
 they went over good 

00:06:47.849 --> 00:06:51.960
 today unfortunately I have 

00:06:49.949 --> 00:06:55.199
 a little wine 

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:57.900
 I can not present beer but we're going to 

00:06:55.199 --> 00:06:59.120
 get down this divisional world with a 

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:02.750
 little natural water 

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:02.750
 nothing makes 

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:08.270
 the excellent card the excellent bed is 

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:10.669
 the food that we like the ones 

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:14.440
 Mexicans see you in the next video 

00:07:10.669 --> 00:07:14.440
 Greetings to everyone dance
