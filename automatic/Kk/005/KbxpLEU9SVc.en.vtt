00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 study always right now the band is more 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.240
 important so they have to respect 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.309
 our decision I do not know why you're 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.590
 speaking in plural of fritz in the 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.090
 study by the band but the guys do not 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.269
 they want only follow one way 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.529
 legal comes only to fight I do not come 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.000
 to fight I come to look for a 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.710
 solution you can not leave the studio 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.080
 we have to find the solution that 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.640
 Gregory's solution the emails he makes 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.140
 I made them because I'm signing a 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.550
 exclusivity contract with another 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.470
 record when it would actually have 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.910
 that be helping the study good if 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.640
 the studio loves us so much that we 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.899
 run us another option if the option 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.620
 in which you study and study 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.620
 thank you doing 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.530
 you will regret 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:45.810
 It is done 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:50.850
 I can not create we have the possibility 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.860
 of doing things well but clearly 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.780
 do not do things right because because 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.520
 the boys are all do not know what is the 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.750
 biggest problem of all this and then the 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.430
 drag will be the selfish guys 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:03.680
 I do not believe that they can not realize 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:06.440
 because they yell at me like that, girl, either 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:10.540
 so much apology of what you are 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.540
 listening and you are very wrong 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.730
 with the guys and with the lion I'm the one 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.840
 Gregorio is all wrong in casting the 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:18.550
 guys but I think they have to 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.830
 fight for the place where they are by 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:22.000
 fight to come back but well you give 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.980
 account that the boys signed a 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.460
 exclusive contract with the 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:28.660
 I do not get in a bad mood 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.430
 what's happening girls takes me 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:33.370
 despair this situation understand 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:35.170
 I need you to help me because I apologize 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:37.140
 is having a bad time 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.490
 know that if you arrive at a bad time 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.680
 always always does the same thing you have 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.420
 to put where it does not concern you 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.250
 do not listen to others and tell me friend 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.780
 is there then is the selfish why 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.850
 what do not listen I never heard 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.530
 initially from tercat the cat that does not 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.090
 interesting that what she thinks about what 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:55.020
 that thinks the rest has to decide 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.020
 she produces more liberal 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.070
 the yellow card we are going to draw if it is 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:06.020
 A) Yes 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:07.700
 calm down, do not stop talking about saying 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.800
 things about her and this has nothing to do 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.800
 between you 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.800
