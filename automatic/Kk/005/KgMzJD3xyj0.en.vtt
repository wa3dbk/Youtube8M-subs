it<00:01:47.090> is<00:01:47.450> indeed<00:01:47.810> fun<00:01:48.140> to<00:01:48.350> make<00:01:48.500> a<00:01:48.530> video<00:01:48.920> that

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:49.159 
it is indeed fun to make a video that

that<00:01:51.560> I<00:01:51.590> began<00:01:51.950> to<00:01:52.130> judge<00:01:52.400> my<00:01:52.610> work<00:01:52.850> on<00:01:53.150> how

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:53.300 
that I began to judge my work on how

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.090 
that I began to judge my work on how
well<00:01:53.570> it<00:01:53.600> did<00:01:53.930> rather<00:01:54.409> than<00:01:54.650> how<00:01:54.830> good<00:01:55.070> I

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
well it did rather than how good I

well it did rather than how good I
personally<00:01:55.790> thought<00:01:55.970> it<00:01:56.120> was<00:01:56.330> I<00:01:56.690> think<00:01:57.170> I

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.290 
personally thought it was I think I

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:58.990

stupidly<00:01:57.740> tried<00:01:57.980> to<00:01:58.220> work<00:01:58.400> out<00:01:58.610> the<00:01:58.790> formula

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
stupidly tried to work out the formula

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.840 
stupidly tried to work out the formula
that<00:01:59.600> would<00:01:59.690> make<00:01:59.870> a<00:01:59.900> video<00:02:00.110> succeed<00:02:00.850> striving

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
that would make a video succeed striving

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:03.850 
that would make a video succeed striving
for<00:02:02.030> success<00:02:02.180> is<00:02:02.659> a<00:02:02.690> fine<00:02:03.050> attitude<00:02:03.409> to<00:02:03.710> have

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
for success is a fine attitude to have
