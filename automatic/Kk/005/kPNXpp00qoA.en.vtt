are just basically you know bring out a
level<00:02:19.890> four<00:02:20.069> so<00:02:20.340> that<00:02:20.489> you<00:02:20.640> can<00:02:20.790> use<00:02:20.819> other

that's<00:02:24.420> basically<00:02:24.690> the<00:02:24.780> only<00:02:24.900> reason<00:02:25.200> that

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
that's basically the only reason that

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.530 
that's basically the only reason that
you<00:02:25.380> use<00:02:25.560> those<00:02:25.800> two<00:02:26.040> and<00:02:26.220> they<00:02:26.790> recur<00:02:27.120> back<00:02:27.390> to

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
you use those two and they recur back to

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.479 
you use those two and they recur back to
like<00:02:27.750> this<00:02:28.440> one<00:02:28.620> gets<00:02:28.800> ten<00:02:29.130> to<00:02:29.220> the<00:02:29.280> graver

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
like this one gets ten to the graver

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:30.680 
like this one gets ten to the graver
this<00:02:29.700> will<00:02:29.819> come<00:02:29.940> back<00:02:30.090> to<00:02:30.120> your<00:02:30.300> hand<00:02:30.480> so<00:02:30.630> if

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
this will come back to your hand so if

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:31.790 
this will come back to your hand so if
you<00:02:30.780> expose<00:02:31.050> you<00:02:31.170> with<00:02:31.290> them<00:02:31.410> it's<00:02:31.530> just<00:02:31.590> a

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
you expose you with them it's just a

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.070 
you expose you with them it's just a
scent<00:02:32.130> so<00:02:32.400> you<00:02:32.880> detach<00:02:33.300> that<00:02:33.330> get<00:02:33.840> that<00:02:33.959> in

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
scent so you detach that get that in

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.770 
scent so you detach that get that in
your<00:02:34.110> hand<00:02:34.319> etc<00:02:35.190> etc<00:02:35.610> you<00:02:36.060> know<00:02:36.090> that<00:02:36.540> they're

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
triple codes consonants for consistency

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.960 
triple codes consonants for consistency
we<00:03:03.569> also<00:03:03.720> have<00:03:04.220> triple<00:03:05.220> MST<00:03:05.580> because<00:03:05.819> this

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
we also have triple MST because this

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.270 
we also have triple MST because this
deck<00:03:06.150> will<00:03:06.299> lose<00:03:06.450> two<00:03:06.599> back<00:03:06.750> row<00:03:07.280> definitely

honest with so honest just got opted out
of<00:03:24.359> this<00:03:24.570> deck<00:03:24.810> but<00:03:24.959> if<00:03:25.049> you<00:03:25.140> wanted<00:03:25.350> to<00:03:25.500> try

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:25.829 
of this deck but if you wanted to try

the slide and honest I'm not sure you

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:28.400 
the slide and honest I'm not sure you
probably<00:03:27.390> could<00:03:27.690> find<00:03:27.870> a<00:03:27.930> way<00:03:28.019> to<00:03:28.079> do<00:03:28.260> that

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
probably could find a way to do that

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.759 
probably could find a way to do that
then<00:03:29.280> we<00:03:29.370> got<00:03:29.519> two<00:03:29.700> silvers<00:03:30.090> cry<00:03:30.500> just<00:03:31.500> because

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:31.769 
then we got two silvers cry just because

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:32.930 
then we got two silvers cry just because
it<00:03:31.859> brings<00:03:31.980> out<00:03:32.130> blue<00:03:32.370> eyes<00:03:32.489> out<00:03:32.640> of<00:03:32.700> the<00:03:32.760> grave

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
it brings out blue eyes out of the grave

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.309 
it brings out blue eyes out of the grave
ear<00:03:33.060> they<00:03:33.209> end<00:03:33.299> up<00:03:33.390> in<00:03:33.450> the<00:03:33.540> grievous<00:03:33.840> often

00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:34.319

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
and this one is the questionable on

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:37.340 
and this one is the questionable on
maybe<00:03:36.359> maybe<00:03:36.690> you<00:03:36.780> can<00:03:36.870> take<00:03:36.959> this<00:03:37.109> out<00:03:37.319> and

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
maybe maybe you can take this out and

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:39.440 
maybe maybe you can take this out and
put<00:03:37.470> honest<00:03:37.799> and<00:03:37.980> one<00:03:38.400> for<00:03:38.549> one<00:03:38.730> I<00:03:38.910> really<00:03:39.239> just

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
put honest and one for one I really just

put honest and one for one I really just
like<00:03:39.540> this<00:03:39.750> because<00:03:39.959> you<00:03:40.319> can<00:03:40.530> like<00:03:41.010> one<00:03:41.190> for

one away you know whetstone get a maiden

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.610 
one away you know whetstone get a maiden
and<00:03:44.340> then<00:03:45.120> you<00:03:45.600> solve<00:03:45.780> your<00:03:45.900> normal<00:03:46.230> summon<00:03:46.500> so

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
and then you solve your normal summon so

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.289 
and then you solve your normal summon so
you<00:03:46.680> could<00:03:46.920> you<00:03:47.100> one<00:03:47.280> for<00:03:47.519> one<00:03:47.670> if<00:03:47.910> you<00:03:48.120> draw

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:48.299 
you could you one for one if you draw

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:50.360 
you could you one for one if you draw
into<00:03:48.540> this<00:03:48.720> and<00:03:49.079> a<00:03:49.440> bright<00:03:49.620> star<00:03:49.889> you

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
into this and a bright star you

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:51.680 
into this and a bright star you
automatically<00:03:50.970> got<00:03:51.150> an<00:03:51.269> ancient<00:03:51.540> sacred

00:03:57.349 --> 00:03:57.359 
plus bright star allows for a lot of

00:03:57.359 --> 00:03:59.120 
plus bright star allows for a lot of
different<00:03:57.630> options<00:03:57.930> that's<00:03:58.590> why<00:03:58.709> I<00:03:58.769> use<00:03:58.950> it

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.130 
different options that's why I use it

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:01.039 
different options that's why I use it
and<00:03:59.280> then<00:03:59.370> we<00:03:59.459> also<00:03:59.579> have<00:03:59.819> it<00:03:59.850> also<00:04:00.450> stops<00:04:00.720> you

and then we also have it also stops you
from<00:04:01.079> getting<00:04:01.319> like<00:04:01.620> dead<00:04:01.859> non<00:04:02.100> made<00:04:02.489> hands

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:02.819 
from getting like dead non made hands

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:05.599

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:05.609 
and then you got four traps two castles

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:07.340 
and then you got four traps two castles
just<00:04:06.239> because<00:04:06.420> this<00:04:06.600> card<00:04:06.870> is<00:04:07.079> really

and that's it for these spells and traps
it's<00:04:22.320> a<00:04:22.409> 40<00:04:22.740> card<00:04:22.950> deck<00:04:23.190> you<00:04:23.550> want<00:04:23.729> to<00:04:23.789> try<00:04:23.909> to
