00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:05.779
 hi guys this time I bring you another way 

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:09.080
 for halloween we are going to do these 

00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:11.269
 beautiful mummies for cyclables and good 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:15.840
 to make these very recyclable 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:20.640
 let's occupy with a roll of paper 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:24.720
 from a toilet paper we're also going to 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:28.730
 need bandages if they do not have bandages 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:33.120
 We can also occupy toilet paper or 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:35.270
 tulle with what you have at home does not 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:39.540
 it matters and well we will also occupy 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:41.820
 white acrylic paint glue 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:45.780
 color of any kind they have and 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:48.780
 glue on bar mobile eyes 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.000
 and scissors and good to start first 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.980
 we have to give our toilet paper 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.379
 of toilet paper rolls if our 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.960
 rolls in our cartridges these already 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.670
 they come white because we leave it like this but 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.260
 although this came in coffee and I 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.559
 help painting them with white paint 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:07.259
 acrylic so that we address both 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.299
 bandages and good if I'm looking for it with 

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:11.850
 toilet paper, they can leave it like this 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:14.820
 if it is coffee because it covers it 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:17.280
 well but good I did this one with 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.750
 toilet paper very easy to make and the 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.840
 What am I going to do now? 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.759
 with bandages and good as the bandage is 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.220
 transparent why this is the paint of 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.720
 white and good to start what we're going 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.479
 to do that we're going to choose the part that 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.710
 we want it to be the front and the 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:35.890
 back we're going to throw you 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.909
 have me 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.909
 glue stick 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.220
 all the back because because the 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:46.290
 Bands are very thin and are easy to 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.720
 paste we need no glue neither 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:52.810
 hot silicone and nothing like that and good 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:54.850
 to start what we're going to do we 're going 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.310
 to bend our vein if yes you 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.810
 they have it for rolls because they simply 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.539
 let's go round and round but mine 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.039
 They came by little package like that in little squares and 

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:06.130
 the only thing I did that double does 

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:08.940
 well finally I what are we going to do 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:11.370
 let's start 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.730
 to stick them all over the roll of this 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.730
 way 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:21.650
 if we have enough left over 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:24.069
 of this we simply cut it in the 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:27.160
 A) Yes 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:29.050
 here it smells let's go back to do 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:32.670
 that's why we put glue in bar 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:36.550
 back here because they stick easily like that 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:38.770
 it is found they are seeing different 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:41.100
 Now we turn to put this to him 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:45.780
 we leave a space between this and this one 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:45.780
 to put the other in this way 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.970
 if we turn it around and there it goes 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.670
 sticking with the glue in bar 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:57.799
 they really are very easy to handle if 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:00.500
 they are fraying so it's fine 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:03.560
 because we are doing mummies and 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:06.700
 Mummies really are not good 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.700
 decorated we say 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.150
 so 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:17.780
 that's 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:21.770
 well over here and now we're just going 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:24.590
 to stick our mobile eyes 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:27.620
 with the glue of the type that you 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:31.030
 They have the cold silicone any 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:31.030
 glue that we have at home 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:38.749
 This is a nice craft to do 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:41.870
 with the children or just us 

00:03:38.749 --> 00:03:44.359
 to decorate our houses and good here 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:47.329
 we already have our girlfriends is what 

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:49.579
 We made with bandages and this with paper of 

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:51.260
 bath equal the same procedure 

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:53.510
 if they want they can cover him here with the 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:56.060
 same sale or toilet paper this is this 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:57.799
 of the surface but if not also what 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:59.290
 they can leave so they can put it if 

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:02.120
 you work in an office 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:05.420
 they just stick a paper here 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:09.580
 carton or a report 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:09.580
 and they can grab it from a pen 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:15.739
 we hit him down here and we grabbed him 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:17.239
 pens or just put it like that 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:20.239
 of ornament in the scratch of our 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:21.769
 office or we give it to our children 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:24.169
 what children can do so 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:25.580
 they give them to their teacher or as 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:27.710
 you want good here I told them 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:31.180
 this nice idea I hope you like it 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:31.180
