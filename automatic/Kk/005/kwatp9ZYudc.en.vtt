pretty quickly and the team is really
nice<00:01:44.100> as<00:01:44.280> you<00:01:44.399> can<00:01:44.549> see<00:01:44.700> Lavezzi<00:01:45.240> there<00:01:45.420> in<00:01:45.509> the

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
nice as you can see Lavezzi there in the

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.630 
nice as you can see Lavezzi there in the
4321<00:01:46.259> formation<00:01:46.439> playing<00:01:47.159> his<00:01:47.280> left-wing

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
4321 formation playing his left-wing

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.999 
4321 formation playing his left-wing
along<00:01:48.450> with<00:01:48.630> inform<00:01:49.170> Hulk<00:01:49.409> who<00:01:49.590> I<00:01:49.619> might<00:01:49.890> add

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
along with inform Hulk who I might add

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.520 
along with inform Hulk who I might add
is<00:01:50.189> an<00:01:50.310> absolute<00:01:50.670> monster<00:01:50.939> everyone<00:01:51.930> is<00:01:52.079> on<00:01:52.200> 7

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
is an absolute monster everyone is on 7

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.280 
is an absolute monster everyone is on 7
chem<00:01:52.740> bar<00:01:53.479> Robinho<00:01:54.479> there<00:01:54.689> and<00:01:54.899> the<00:01:55.170> only

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
chem bar Robinho there and the only

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:56.749 
chem bar Robinho there and the only
reason<00:01:55.350> why<00:01:55.649> he<00:01:55.829> isn't<00:01:55.979> is<00:01:56.189> because<00:01:56.430> he's<00:01:56.610> in

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
reason why he isn't is because he's in

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.639 
reason why he isn't is because he's in
the<00:01:56.850> center<00:01:57.119> attack<00:01:57.360> in<00:01:57.509> mid<00:01:57.659> position<00:01:58.259> when

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
the center attack in mid position when

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.410 
the center attack in mid position when
he<00:01:58.770> really<00:01:59.460> should<00:01:59.670> be<00:01:59.790> in<00:01:59.850> the<00:01:59.939> center<00:02:00.119> mid

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
he really should be in the center mid

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.969 
he really should be in the center mid
but<00:02:00.600> to<00:02:00.719> be<00:02:00.810> honest<00:02:01.079> I<00:02:01.200> didn't<00:02:01.619> really<00:02:01.649> want<00:02:01.920> to

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
but to be honest I didn't really want to

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.410 
but to be honest I didn't really want to
shell<00:02:02.159> out<00:02:02.250> all<00:02:02.430> those<00:02:02.549> coins<00:02:02.820> just<00:02:03.180> to<00:02:03.270> make

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
shell out all those coins just to make

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:04.910
