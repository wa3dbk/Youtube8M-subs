hardware sticking out from underneath

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.550 
hardware sticking out from underneath
and<00:02:06.119> I<00:02:06.180> can<00:02:06.360> put<00:02:06.540> the<00:02:06.719> right<00:02:07.200> link<00:02:07.439> the

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
and I can put the right link the

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.550 
and I can put the right link the
hardware<00:02:07.950> in<00:02:08.129> there

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
hardware in there

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.760 
hardware in there
to<00:02:08.619> hold<00:02:08.800> the<00:02:08.950> plate<00:02:10.050> I'm<00:02:11.050> going<00:02:11.380> to<00:02:11.440> have<00:02:11.620> to

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
to hold the plate I'm going to have to

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:13.500 
to hold the plate I'm going to have to
shim<00:02:12.010> mine<00:02:12.280> just<00:02:12.550> a<00:02:12.640> little<00:02:12.910> bit<00:02:13.030> but<00:02:13.239> you<00:02:13.330> can

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
shim mine just a little bit but you can

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.850 
shim mine just a little bit but you can
free<00:02:13.780> there's<00:02:14.739> a<00:02:14.770> gap<00:02:15.069> there<00:02:15.099> on<00:02:15.550> the<00:02:15.640> front

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
free there's a gap there on the front

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.500 
free there's a gap there on the front
it's<00:02:17.860> hard<00:02:18.040> to<00:02:18.160> cut<00:02:18.340> things<00:02:18.610> perfectly<00:02:19.090> square

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
it's hard to cut things perfectly square

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.650 
it's hard to cut things perfectly square
but<00:02:19.870> that's<00:02:20.530> what<00:02:20.709> shimming<00:02:21.130> is<00:02:21.220> for<00:02:21.540> since<00:02:22.540> I

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
but that's what shimming is for since I

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:24.059 
but that's what shimming is for since I
get<00:02:22.720> the<00:02:22.959> rest<00:02:23.170> of<00:02:23.290> it<00:02:23.380> put<00:02:23.560> together<00:02:23.709> and

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:24.069 
get the rest of it put together and

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:27.690 
get the rest of it put together and
painted<00:02:24.459> I'll<00:02:25.500> pop<00:02:26.500> off<00:02:26.739> another<00:02:27.040> video<00:02:27.370> here

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
painted I'll pop off another video here

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.970 
painted I'll pop off another video here
and<00:02:27.940> let's<00:02:28.060> just<00:02:28.349> okay<00:02:29.349> I've<00:02:29.500> got<00:02:29.650> it<00:02:29.769> mounted

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
and let's just okay I've got it mounted

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.699 
and let's just okay I've got it mounted
now<00:02:30.370> and<00:02:30.700> you<00:02:31.690> can<00:02:31.840> see<00:02:31.989> I've<00:02:32.080> put<00:02:32.319> a<00:02:32.349> couple<00:02:32.380> of

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
now and you can see I've put a couple of

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:36.870 
now and you can see I've put a couple of
shims<00:02:32.980> back<00:02:33.310> there<00:02:35.220> see<00:02:36.220> a<00:02:36.250> couple<00:02:36.580> of<00:02:36.640> shims

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
shims back there see a couple of shims

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:38.250 
shims back there see a couple of shims
underneath<00:02:37.239> there<00:02:37.569> just<00:02:37.750> to<00:02:37.840> keep<00:02:37.959> everything

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
underneath there just to keep everything

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.610 
underneath there just to keep everything
square<00:02:39.600> so<00:02:40.600> everything's<00:02:40.959> going<00:02:41.260> good<00:02:41.410> on

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
square so everything's going good on

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.059 
square so everything's going good on
that<00:02:41.970> basically<00:02:42.970> when<00:02:43.660> you<00:02:43.810> do<00:02:43.989> this<00:02:44.230> if<00:02:44.950> you
