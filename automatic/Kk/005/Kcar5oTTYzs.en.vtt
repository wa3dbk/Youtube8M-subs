very wide wheelbase very intricate
design<00:00:32.099> and<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:32.790> interesting<00:00:33.180> thing<00:00:33.210> is<00:00:33.510> the

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
design and the interesting thing is the

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.550 
design and the interesting thing is the
engine<00:00:34.140> is<00:00:34.260> actually<00:00:34.620> exposed<00:00:36.320> look<00:00:37.320> at<00:00:37.410> that

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:37.560 
engine is actually exposed look at that

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.040 
engine is actually exposed look at that
engine<00:00:37.770> it's<00:00:38.130> amazing<00:00:38.670> if<00:00:39.510> you<00:00:39.630> notice<00:00:39.900> the

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
engine it's amazing if you notice the

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.080 
engine it's amazing if you notice the
reinforcement<00:00:40.890> in<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.100> frame<00:00:41.430> you<00:00:41.730> can<00:00:41.760> just

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
reinforcement in the frame you can just

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.180 
reinforcement in the frame you can just
see<00:00:42.300> how<00:00:42.510> structurally<00:00:43.140> sound<00:00:43.440> this<00:00:43.740> is<00:00:43.950> an

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
see how structurally sound this is an

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.060 
see how structurally sound this is an
aerodynamic<00:00:45.020> just<00:00:46.020> must<00:00:46.260> be<00:00:46.410> amazing<00:00:46.680> to

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
aerodynamic just must be amazing to

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.340 
aerodynamic just must be amazing to
drive<00:00:47.340> quite<00:00:48.300> dangerous<00:00:48.510> if<00:00:48.810> you<00:00:49.110> don't<00:00:49.140> know

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
drive quite dangerous if you don't know

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.069 
drive quite dangerous if you don't know
what<00:00:49.530> you're<00:00:49.680> doing<00:00:50.420> look<00:00:51.420> at<00:00:51.540> that<00:00:51.690> exhaust

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
what you're doing look at that exhaust

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.050 
what you're doing look at that exhaust
the<00:00:52.380> dual<00:00:52.560> exhaust<00:00:52.980> you<00:00:53.250> can<00:00:53.430> see<00:00:53.640> inside

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:54.060 
the dual exhaust you can see inside

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:56.780 
the dual exhaust you can see inside
that's<00:00:54.510> combined<00:00:54.989> into<00:00:55.290> one<00:00:55.320> to<00:00:56.010> create<00:00:56.400> such

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:56.790 
that's combined into one to create such

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:59.479 
that's combined into one to create such
a<00:00:56.820> visual<00:00:57.390> and<00:00:57.600> I'm<00:00:58.230> sure<00:00:58.440> quite<00:00:58.800> loud<00:00:59.070> if<00:00:59.340> we

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
a visual and I'm sure quite loud if we

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.090 
a visual and I'm sure quite loud if we
were<00:00:59.579> to<00:00:59.730> start<00:00:59.970> it<00:01:00.149> and<00:01:00.500> it's<00:01:01.500> amazing<00:01:01.770> with

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
were to start it and it's amazing with

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.090 
were to start it and it's amazing with
this<00:01:02.280> is<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:02.610> carbon<00:01:03.060> fiber<00:01:03.329> and<00:01:03.690> down<00:01:04.650> here

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
this is the carbon fiber and down here

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.860 
this is the carbon fiber and down here
you'll<00:01:05.280> see<00:01:05.370> these<00:01:05.640> fins<00:01:06.120> they're<00:01:06.510> actually

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:06.870 
you'll see these fins they're actually

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:10.820 
you'll see these fins they're actually
there<00:01:07.170> to<00:01:07.200> create<00:01:07.979> downforce<00:01:08.580> so<00:01:09.770> instead<00:01:10.770> of

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
there to create downforce so instead of

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.620 
there to create downforce so instead of
a<00:01:10.979> fin<00:01:11.190> on<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.460> trunk<00:01:11.670> like<00:01:11.880> we<00:01:12.030> saw<00:01:12.210> earlier

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
a fin on the trunk like we saw earlier

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.110 
a fin on the trunk like we saw earlier
we<00:01:12.870> have<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.290> downforce<00:01:13.830> here<00:01:14.430> that<00:01:15.000> is

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:15.120 
we have the downforce here that is

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.460 
we have the downforce here that is
suctioned<00:01:15.600> for<00:01:15.870> the<00:01:15.960> sleek<00:01:16.260> design<00:01:16.680> and<00:01:17.180> also

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:18.470 
suctioned for the sleek design and also

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.350 
suctioned for the sleek design and also
some<00:01:19.470> interesting<00:01:19.979> visual<00:01:20.640> as<00:01:20.850> they<00:01:21.030> pass<00:01:21.330> by

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
some interesting visual as they pass by

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:28.789 
some interesting visual as they pass by
you<00:01:21.750> at<00:01:22.020> 100<00:01:22.350> miles<00:01:22.560> an<00:01:22.770> hour<00:01:26.720> 8<00:01:27.720> or<00:01:28.110> a<00:01:28.140> is<00:01:28.530> the

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
you at 100 miles an hour 8 or a is the

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.219 
you at 100 miles an hour 8 or a is the
first<00:01:28.979> name<00:01:29.310> of<00:01:29.340> mr.<00:01:29.850> bugatti<00:01:30.299> and<00:01:30.690> he

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
first name of mr. bugatti and he

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.100 
first name of mr. bugatti and he
actually<00:01:31.380> was<00:01:32.190> French<00:01:32.549> and<00:01:32.940> he<00:01:33.450> grew<00:01:33.690> up<00:01:33.720> in

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
actually was French and he grew up in

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.840 
actually was French and he grew up in
the<00:01:34.440> country<00:01:34.830> and<00:01:35.070> he<00:01:35.250> loved<00:01:35.549> horses

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
the country and he loved horses

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.289 
the country and he loved horses
apparently<00:01:36.720> because<00:01:37.020> he<00:01:37.320> um<00:01:37.670> made<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.909> emblem

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
apparently because he um made the emblem

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.780 
apparently because he um made the emblem
of<00:01:39.450> all<00:01:39.630> of<00:01:39.780> his<00:01:39.900> cars<00:01:40.200> horseshoes<00:01:41.010> so<00:01:41.640> if<00:01:41.729> you

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
of all of his cars horseshoes so if you

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.730 
of all of his cars horseshoes so if you
can<00:01:41.940> see<00:01:42.180> here's<00:01:42.600> where<00:01:42.810> I<00:01:43.140> guess<00:01:43.470> you<00:01:43.619> would

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
can see here's where I guess you would

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.250 
can see here's where I guess you would
call<00:01:43.770> it<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:44.130> horse<00:01:44.369> frog<00:01:45.030> which<00:01:45.450> is<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:45.810> V<00:01:46.020> in

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:46.260 
call it the horse frog which is the V in

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.920 
call it the horse frog which is the V in
the<00:01:46.380> horseshoe<00:01:46.619> and<00:01:47.010> then<00:01:47.670> the<00:01:48.180> round<00:01:48.390> part<00:01:48.750> of

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
the horseshoe and then the round part of

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:55.970 
the horseshoe and then the round part of
the<00:01:49.140> horse<00:01:49.350> front<00:01:49.920> of<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:50.760> horseshoe

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:55.980 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:59.750 

so<00:01:56.670> this<00:01:57.120> keyhole<00:01:57.630> actually<00:01:58.470> is<00:01:58.620> the<00:01:59.280> second

00:01:59.750 --> 00:01:59.760 
so this keyhole actually is the second

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.520 
so this keyhole actually is the second
key<00:01:59.940> hole<00:02:00.180> that's<00:02:00.420> used<00:02:00.660> to<00:02:00.870> start<00:02:01.140> another

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
key hole that's used to start another

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.920 
key hole that's used to start another
part<00:02:01.920> of<00:02:01.980> the<00:02:02.040> engine<00:02:02.520> it's<00:02:03.330> the<00:02:03.420> second<00:02:03.780> half

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
part of the engine it's the second half

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.560 
part of the engine it's the second half
of<00:02:04.050> the<00:02:04.140> engine<00:02:04.440> that<00:02:04.710> gives<00:02:05.550> you<00:02:05.700> 10<00:02:06.360> more

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
of the engine that gives you 10 more

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.080 
of the engine that gives you 10 more
horsepower<00:02:07.020> and<00:02:07.350> you<00:02:07.830> can<00:02:08.010> maximize<00:02:08.490> it<00:02:08.670> using

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
horsepower and you can maximize it using

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.770 
horsepower and you can maximize it using
the<00:02:09.230> 1001<00:02:10.230> that<00:02:10.380> we<00:02:10.470> spoke<00:02:10.710> about<00:02:10.860> earlier

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
the 1001 that we spoke about earlier

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.620 
the 1001 that we spoke about earlier
quite<00:02:12.780> interesting<00:02:13.320> another<00:02:14.220> feature<00:02:14.630> an

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
wouldn't ever want to race full throttle
