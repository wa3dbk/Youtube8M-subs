00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:12.429
 print ahead majority is finally 

00:00:10.079 --> 00:00:14.139
 a number of goats hold them together 

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:15.639
 say sit down to watch with the new 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:17.800
 glasses 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:19.630
 after the goat farming what can help us 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.430
 to improve goat farming 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.860
 more sustainable and not just on it 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:25.780
 primary company but also in the chain 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:29.110
 thoughts with milk for brands 

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:31.750
 feed suppliers and these six 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:32.710
 goat farmers are very specific to the 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:34.690
 got started with their own 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:38.039
 business plans on their own primary 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:40.329
 company we are working here on the 

00:00:38.039 --> 00:00:42.190
 various soils for pre-writer 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:45.039
 different floors for windows and 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:46.390
 in addition, goats in the floor outside 

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:48.010
 find outside safely yeah me 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:51.100
 I think so, the ordinary the de 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:53.289
 freedom of choice that they have experienced 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.300
 they as very attractive 

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:56.440
 in my experience it is very 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.809
 weather dependent 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:01.299
 you just notice when it's rainy 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:02.530
 or the strong sun 

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:05.050
 that they have more and more difficulty with that 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.850
 just have it varied 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:09.010
 so from within we can enter it 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.690
 we can lie on straw we can 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:13.090
 can eat and in addition the trip 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:14.900
 make outside that we like to use 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.480
 from 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.650
 I would like to show you that we 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.780
 next to it 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:23.170
 we shit it out 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.680
 have also started looking at different ones 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.090
 floor types 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.790
 we have a lot here that we have 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:32.000
 fully sprinkled that have it beside 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:35.390
 we also that is half sprinkled 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.040
 and half a concrete floor behind him 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.560
 are also well we have a skirt 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.740
 isolated and here we are 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.360
 see if that can do something with 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:47.150
 slatted floors with looks like that 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.470
 goat in certain moments also in the 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:49.400
 need a hair the 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.360
 subfloor 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.190
 that's a bit never theirs 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.990
 origin of walking out in the mountains 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:55.970
 and lie in the mountains to solve 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.950
 and her the subfloor and that would 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:01.700
 may also offer opportunities for doing so 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:03.200
 to be able to separate the manure 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.369
 i am minute dani as i have along with 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.860
 my husband in appearance and 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:09.229
 dairy goat farm that we are working on 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.690
 developing into a test company 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:14.420
 we have we are working on it 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:17.180
 developing a sustainable goat stable 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:19.280
 and there stay animal welfare in the neighborhood 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.650
 very important such as for example 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.570
 climbing and lying down 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.739
 goats and you are now an example of that 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:27.260
 see 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:29.630
 with the blocks yes actually we find 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:32.360
 it's important that he put the cubes 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:34.690
 yes have enough distraction that they are you 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:38.180
 being able to jump on being good 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:40.700
 hind serene that they go up 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.140
 and yes she also has the advantage that see 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.209
 you can also lie down a bit 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.190
 so when a cold air falls 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:47.780
 yes they have here as it were 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.630
 another piece of shelter you 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.970
 animal welfare stands for us 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:54.290
 yes you on yes actually at number 1 hour 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:56.780
 good for the animals for thirty years 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.650
 so that we also love the animals for a long time 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.320
 can enjoy 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:04.720
 that is having such a good productive life 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:04.720
 and you, the platos, contribute to that 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:08.709
 animal welfare is coming back 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:13.200
 different points will be 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:13.200
 and will introduce pretty ahead 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:18.159
 on production , more taps the more 

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:20.920
 give people how to get more cool 

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:22.840
 skills we have not met 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:25.030
 much freedom of movement to be able to do the whole 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.390
 walk through the stable 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:32.049
 I understand for a lot of light through the 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:34.269
 system on the outside and if it 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:38.129
 gonna have to make lame let them off long 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:38.129
 in a special stable for that 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.730
 i am jan van tilburg i have been with 

00:03:41.139 --> 00:03:44.889
 my wife off and organic 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:47.560
 dairy goat farm in old tonge 

00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:51.099
 and with which we can make the 600 milk goats 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:53.560
 we experimented a lot here 

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:57.220
 with him and with sand 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:59.379
 we have sand and drainage on it 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:01.060
 the idea was to have one with one in one 

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:02.409
 another machine and we were on the beach 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:05.950
 they turn thinking about the master from the 

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:07.449
 seven that has not yet been successful 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:09.209
 that machine at not too high a cost 

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:10.900
 you get it so it's a bit 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:12.129
 silted up 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.810
 well that i go now we are not too bad 

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:14.250
 enthusiastic about the standard up to 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:16.599
 present day 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:18.639
 I still know the question in the sea 

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:20.650
 is it because straw balances are used to or 

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:22.900
 praise because they don't like beach sand anyway 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:23.770
 accepted in the true of the so understand 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.120
 the once one 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:26.950
 accounts give the creator the diesel 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.360
 afterwards and then 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:30.850
 keep it to chop some machine 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:32.980
 at the bottom of the first results of 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:33.340
 forward with the goat are very special 

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:37.110
 to name 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:39.520
 very inspiring test with a number 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:41.350
 solutions or developments I am running 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:42.940
 immediately why for think ancestors 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:45.910
 great at some i think of 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:47.440
 see first and then believe but these six 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:48.820
 shitting loves them with their destiny 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.700
 plans to get started 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:54.010
 but that every plan contains so much 

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:55.630
 share solutions where an individual 

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:56.770
 rows are also chalk holders 

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:58.419
 benefit from it 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:01.440
 so definitely worth thinking about 

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:01.440
 to share with the sector
