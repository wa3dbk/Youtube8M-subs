 of the edition that decide you to 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.930
 gave away gamestop is worth the game box 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.030
 it was another tone I do not know but still in 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.250
 twitter posted several pictures of the box 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.970

 hand raised by ryder 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.440
 It was very cool but of course the one 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.630
 This is cool because the European cover 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.340
 of the game is not that I liked it very much 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.710
 I 've always wanted it to come out 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.300
 this cover and in the end this 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.950
 that is not bad at all but I think 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:23.380
 that this represents much more the 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.600

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:55.330
 metal inside what I expected 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:58.650
 there is always an illustration inside 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:58.650
 what a surprise 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:05.870
 and the game without finishing the game 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.540
 handing out manga and ended up handing out 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:11.409
 sending 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:13.329
 can cut incredible what you have 

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:16.540
 tested the demo we also uploaded the 

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:18.519
 analysis of the demo and it breaks a bit 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.670
 what is the aesthetics of the saga metal gear 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:23.500

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:25.750
 programmed by criterion games with 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:28.299
 Chivas has supervised it takes a lot 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:29.829
 time announcing this game but when 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:32.379
 we caught saw what they were doing said 

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:34.599

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:35.920
