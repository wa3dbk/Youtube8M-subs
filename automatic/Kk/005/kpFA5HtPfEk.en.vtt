00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.100
 we boast of the ebro diego but they go 

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:05.390
 to see that the sea also has its 

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:07.040
 space in zaragoza and where you 

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:09.099
 you find we can find what 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:11.680
 necessary to have an own aquarium 

00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:14.960
 good afternoon, dawn again, well, well, 

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:16.189
 let's immerse ourselves fully in the world 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:18.080
 of the aquarium and it catches my attention 

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:21.170
 why 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:23.540
 has much more than what one thinks is 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:26.090
 more now there are saltwater aquariums 

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:28.670
 that we can say that it is the novelty itself 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:30.680
 good is what is working the most 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:34.250
 now especially the small aquariums 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:35.989
 they are going to ride a small reef that 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.910
 example that we have there in the background that 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:39.320
 then we will see it exactly then 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:41.239
 You can have a small reef in your 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.370
 house let's start with these aquariums 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:45.019
 that the truth that they are impressive are 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.239
 incredible have a colorful like 

00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:49.839
 you can see exceptional are live corals 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:52.640
 if all these with the live is worth then 

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:55.909
 we have as much for speaking as for the 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:57.589
 hard the coral the hard is the most colorful 

00:00:55.909 --> 00:01:00.440
 the one with the most coloration 

00:00:57.589 --> 00:01:02.479
 it is impressive it is very beautiful a back 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.830
 and subsidiaries that are corals are usually 

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:05.390
 place in the area of ​​the sand and what 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:07.190
 care have these corals for 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.650
 good example the coral you have to 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:11.960
 feed it just like the fish is worth 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.610
 and then it requires certain parameters 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.280
 in the water and control how would it be 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.240
 calcium the magnesium the carbonate and then 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.500
 independent of that there is 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.049
 feed it you have to be well taken care of more 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.670
 rigorous yes yes it is a is more delicate than 

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:24.170
 a fish is worth a water quality 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.930
 more expensive 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:29.299
 good you have everything there from 29 euros 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:30.560
 up to 39 what are the cuttings and then 

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:32.659
 you already have large pieces that can be 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.950
 reach then 70 the 80 euros this 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:37.159
 it's like a fan for people 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:39.020
 take a coral a fish no yes yes you can 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:40.340
 put together without any problem is fish and 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.020
 corals as we can see in this aquarium 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.610
 the only thing that yes true that not all 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.830
 the fish are suitable for aquariums 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:47.119
 small corals or to be with 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:48.860
 certain channels because they can 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:52.159
 eat this we're seeing now alba 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:54.890
 they are saltwater aquariums and we can 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:56.390
 see until sharks if these are about 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.069
 little sharks that we're going to see 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.600
 now they can reach a meter and a half 

00:01:58.069 --> 00:02:02.149
 but they are now small but they can 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.920
 achieve much more size and logically 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:05.299
 they are already for much larger aquariums and 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.830
 they are reef sharks do not need 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:08.539
 be swimming like the normal shark that 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:11.480
 we usually see in aquariums so 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:13.069
 can be in the polis more reduced and 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.660
 my question is when you clean this 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:16.819
 aquarium what do you do with the shark there is no 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:19.400
 no problem does not attack does not do anything 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:21.519
 in fact they eat food feed 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.720
 frozen food 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:25.400
 the teacher now no good problem 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.709
 let's continue immersing saves us in 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:31.069
 the world of the aquarium and this for example 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:32.420
 it's a vegetation aquarium 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:33.650
 also minnows and this would be the 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.719
 aquarium where we have the 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.310
 natural plants because also in the 

00:02:35.719 --> 00:02:38.540
 fresh water water issue what more 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.310
 now it leads what is taking is 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.260
 the theme of the plant previously only 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.639
 had its colorful truth if it was 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.879
 much colorful is much more colorful 

00:02:43.639 --> 00:02:48.079
 much exactly much more life and what 

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:49.459
 same we have plants that are very 

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:50.930
 simple to have that do not demand anything 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:52.310
 and then we have another type of plant 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:53.540
 They are more demanding than required 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.939
 other maintenance that we have to 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:59.389
 put co2 or a light quality greater than 

00:02:55.939 --> 00:03:00.950
 brings the plant to the aquarium good what 

00:02:59.389 --> 00:03:02.840
 first it is logically how beautiful 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.120
 it stays a lot more natural a 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.310
 alves brings something no no to the fish he is 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.989
 indifferent but the good aquarium is 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:10.730
 much more beautiful when it comes to maintaining 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:11.659
 the maintenance if you really like 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.389
 It is like an indoor plant 

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:16.010
 you have to prune it you have to pay for it 

00:03:14.389 --> 00:03:18.079
 and then everything that can be done with 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:19.939
 we do not do much aquarium country of 

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:22.159
 landscaping that is called vale where 

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:25.250
 we can recreate different types by the 

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:26.989
 essential light yes yes it is very important there 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:28.609
 plants as I told you that it requires 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:30.109
 much less much less light so 

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:31.699
 with a normal tube of all life 

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:34.639
 They can pull and others that require it 

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:36.229
 already special tubes of 5 where we have 

00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:37.550
 that put almost up to one watt per liter 

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:39.620
 for the plant to pull 

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:42.380
 it seems we are going to focus on the world in 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:44.240
 the fish and let's see one that maybe 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:46.100
 they are struck by this little horse 

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:48.620
 good is tiny the truth is a 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:50.870
 little seahorse look 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:51.530
 baby pigs are raised in 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:53.240
 captivity 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:55.760
 that's why we see them so small 

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:58.340
 here we have the puffer fish that when 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:01.070
 Angry swells nhtsa exactly and 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:03.470
 this is the white toad fish this 

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:05.240
 space we can see all that white 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:07.250
 it's a frog to put his hand and we see it that way 

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:10.250
 a little bit at home mind the 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:11.060
 particularity of this fish is fed or 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:13.190
 he is a hunter 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:15.590
 other fish that enter through the 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:18.620
 mouth while it has the peculiarity of 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:20.269
 that has on one side imitating a 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:21.500
 worm like a fishing rod because of 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:23.510
 some way then when it comes 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:24.950
 the prey moves it so that the fish 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:27.430
 approach to see what is and to 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:30.980
 nibble it and then catch the pp 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:33.140
 that has some fish and I love me 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:36.530
 say goodbye with this fish that surely 

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:40.120
 sound this here to see if we see it and 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:40.120
 you tell me that you sound 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:48.860
 some movie or we have the animals 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:52.259
 that is magic orange the clown fish 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:53.520
 exactly the clown fish that's what 

00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:54.599
 more, aquariums are usually put in because 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.819
 They are also raised high activity 

00:04:54.599 --> 00:04:58.259
 which is why they are strong norms and we 

00:04:56.819 --> 00:05:00.509
 we say goodbye with the latest fashion in 

00:04:58.259 --> 00:05:02.849
 aquariums that would be this aquarium that is 

00:05:00.509 --> 00:05:04.710
 recreate landscapes within an aquarium 

00:05:02.849 --> 00:05:07.680
 exactly in this case we would see how 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:09.599
 that it was a mountain worth all its 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:11.509
 vegetation at the foot of the mountain and 

00:05:09.599 --> 00:05:13.889
 we have even put a cloud background 

00:05:11.509 --> 00:05:15.689
 then this can be done with a 

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:17.580
 forest is worth without a problem of how 

00:05:15.689 --> 00:05:19.889
 it was a forest type with its trees and 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:21.569
 the very precious treetops 

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:24.120
 nice thank you david for immersing us in 

00:05:21.569 --> 00:05:26.699
 the world of the aquarium and there are many 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:28.439
 options to have a good aquarium in 

00:05:26.699 --> 00:05:29.849
 house alba as we have seen for sure that 

00:05:28.439 --> 00:05:31.110
 someone is left with the desire and 

00:05:29.849 --> 00:05:34.099
 they are interested in having one of these 

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:34.099
 aquariums are your home thank you
