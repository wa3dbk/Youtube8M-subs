swinging back and forth it was hilarious

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.950 
swinging back and forth it was hilarious
now<00:00:53.730> I<00:00:54.770> honestly<00:00:55.770> think<00:00:56.070> that<00:00:56.510> Miz<00:00:57.510> is<00:00:57.780> the

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
now I honestly think that Miz is the

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.549 
now I honestly think that Miz is the
wrong<00:00:58.140> American<00:00:58.800> to<00:00:59.219> face<00:00:59.489> Antonio<00:00:59.940> Cesaro

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:00.559 
wrong American to face Antonio Cesaro

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:04.910 
wrong American to face Antonio Cesaro
for<00:01:01.559> a<00:01:01.590> couple<00:01:01.890> different<00:01:01.980> reasons<00:01:02.809> I<00:01:03.920> don't

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
for a couple different reasons I don't

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.190 
for a couple different reasons I don't
think<00:01:05.010> may<00:01:05.549> should<00:01:05.610> be<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:06.060> one<00:01:06.240> to<00:01:06.420> take<00:01:06.900> back

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
think may should be the one to take back

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.679 
think may should be the one to take back
the<00:01:07.439> United<00:01:08.340> States<00:01:08.490> Championship<00:01:09.030> I<00:01:09.420> don't

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
the United States Championship I don't

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.109 
the United States Championship I don't
see<00:01:09.990> it<00:01:10.080> happening<00:01:10.260> I<00:01:10.770> think<00:01:11.580> I<00:01:11.700> Antonio

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
see it happening I think I Antonio

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.240 
see it happening I think I Antonio
Cesaro<00:01:12.420> zhan<00:01:13.020> too<00:01:13.260> much<00:01:13.439> of<00:01:13.619> a<00:01:13.680> role<00:01:13.920> but<00:01:14.220> I

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
Cesaro zhan too much of a role but I

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.570 
Cesaro zhan too much of a role but I
also<00:01:14.430> don't<00:01:14.670> think<00:01:14.820> that<00:01:15.920> Miz<00:01:16.920> is<00:01:17.159> really<00:01:17.430> the

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
also don't think that Miz is really the

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.960 
also don't think that Miz is really the
guy<00:01:17.729> to<00:01:17.790> put<00:01:18.210> Cesaro<00:01:18.450> over<00:01:19.439> I<00:01:19.680> mean<00:01:20.520> I<00:01:20.580> know<00:01:20.610> Miz

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
guy to put Cesaro over I mean I know Miz

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.940 
guy to put Cesaro over I mean I know Miz
is<00:01:21.180> getting<00:01:21.479> a<00:01:21.509> lot<00:01:21.689> of<00:01:21.720> face<00:01:22.140> reaction<00:01:22.770> right

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
is getting a lot of face reaction right

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.980 
is getting a lot of face reaction right
now<00:01:23.159> but<00:01:23.580> I<00:01:23.759> think<00:01:24.299> that<00:01:24.360> he<00:01:24.630> could<00:01:24.750> go<00:01:24.900> up

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
now but I think that he could go up

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.320 
now but I think that he could go up
against<00:01:25.259> somebody<00:01:25.439> else<00:01:25.710> to<00:01:26.580> really<00:01:26.850> you<00:01:27.299> know

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
against somebody else to really you know

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.289 
against somebody else to really you know
be<00:01:27.600> a<00:01:27.630> bigger<00:01:27.960> deal<00:01:28.290> so<00:01:28.979> I<00:01:29.009> see<00:01:29.400> Antonio<00:01:29.790> Cesaro

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
be a bigger deal so I see Antonio Cesaro

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.319 
be a bigger deal so I see Antonio Cesaro
winning<00:01:31.110> here<00:01:31.470> and<00:01:31.759> unless<00:01:32.759> they're<00:01:32.970> planning

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
winning here and unless they're planning

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:34.609 
winning here and unless they're planning
a<00:01:33.420> program<00:01:33.780> all<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.079> way<00:01:34.140> to<00:01:34.200> rustle<00:01:34.560> mania

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
a program all the way to rustle mania

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.770 
a program all the way to rustle mania
which<00:01:34.950> some<00:01:35.159> people<00:01:35.250> are<00:01:35.460> speculating<00:01:35.780> it

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
which some people are speculating it

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.520 
which some people are speculating it
doesn't<00:01:37.200> make<00:01:37.320> sense<00:01:37.380> for<00:01:37.829> Miz<00:01:38.189> to<00:01:38.220> lose<00:01:38.700> here

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
doesn't make sense for Miz to lose here

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.660 
doesn't make sense for Miz to lose here
because<00:01:40.530> that<00:01:40.710> would<00:01:40.829> be<00:01:40.920> two<00:01:41.130> times<00:01:41.340> and<00:01:41.610> it

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
because that would be two times and it

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.580 
because that would be two times and it
always<00:01:41.700> lost<00:01:42.119> and<00:01:42.540> then<00:01:42.689> to<00:01:42.840> go<00:01:42.960> on<00:01:43.140> to<00:01:43.350> face

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
always lost and then to go on to face

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.149 
always lost and then to go on to face
him<00:01:43.829> again<00:01:43.950> for<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:44.549> third<00:01:44.579> time<00:01:45.439> as<00:01:46.439> a<00:01:46.829> number

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
him again for the third time as a number

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.940 
him again for the third time as a number
one<00:01:47.280> contender<00:01:47.939> would<00:01:48.270> really<00:01:48.630> make<00:01:48.780> sense<00:01:49.170> so

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
one contender would really make sense so

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.109 
one contender would really make sense so
if<00:01:50.040> they<00:01:50.189> if<00:01:50.340> they're<00:01:50.430> planning<00:01:50.790> on<00:01:50.850> drawing

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
if they if they're planning on drawing

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.149 
if they if they're planning on drawing
out<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.420> program<00:01:51.990> I<00:01:52.020> would<00:01:52.290> look<00:01:52.619> for<00:01:52.829> ms<00:01:52.979> de
