think everything will be they're saying
everything<00:05:41.310> will<00:05:41.460> be<00:05:41.580> fifty<00:05:41.940> percent<00:05:42.330> off<00:05:42.540> so

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:42.990 
everything will be fifty percent off so

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:46.120 
everything will be fifty percent off so
that<00:05:43.890> would<00:05:44.130> actually<00:05:44.520> have<00:05:44.670> made<00:05:44.880> these

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:46.130 
that would actually have made these

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:50.630 
that would actually have made these
maybe<00:05:47.130> $5<00:05:47.910> instead<00:05:48.180> of<00:05:48.510> $6.99<00:05:48.840> so<00:05:49.650> I<00:05:49.920> don't

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:50.640 
maybe $5 instead of $6.99 so I don't

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:52.040 
maybe $5 instead of $6.99 so I don't
know<00:05:50.700> how<00:05:50.850> they're<00:05:51.000> calculating<00:05:51.600> that<00:05:51.720> but<00:05:51.960> in

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:52.050 
know how they're calculating that but in

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:54.770 
know how they're calculating that but in
any<00:05:52.200> case<00:05:53.000> give<00:05:54.000> him<00:05:54.120> a<00:05:54.210> try

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:54.780 
any case give him a try

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:56.930 
any case give him a try
check<00:05:55.320> them<00:05:55.440> out<00:05:55.560> always<00:05:56.100> check<00:05:56.670> for<00:05:56.700> the

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:56.940 
check them out always check for the

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:58.460 
check them out always check for the
clearance<00:05:57.270> rack<00:05:57.450> no<00:05:57.720> matter<00:05:57.870> where<00:05:58.110> you<00:05:58.290> go

00:05:58.460 --> 00:05:58.470 
clearance rack no matter where you go

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:00.050 
clearance rack no matter where you go
you<00:05:58.770> just<00:05:58.950> never<00:05:59.220> know<00:05:59.460> what<00:05:59.700> you're<00:05:59.730> going<00:06:00.000> to

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:00.060 
you just never know what you're going to

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:03.650 
you just never know what you're going to
find<00:06:00.680> so<00:06:01.680> that's<00:06:01.890> it<00:06:02.100> I<00:06:02.400> hope<00:06:02.850> you<00:06:03.090> try<00:06:03.300> it<00:06:03.360> I

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:03.660 
find so that's it I hope you try it I

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:04.370 
find so that's it I hope you try it I
hope<00:06:03.900> you<00:06:04.050> love<00:06:04.200> it
