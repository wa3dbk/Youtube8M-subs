behind<00:00:10.719> me<00:00:10.870> is<00:00:10.900> a<00:00:11.169> guy<00:00:11.679> part<00:00:12.009> of<00:00:12.309> our<00:00:12.519> newest

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:12.940 
behind me is a guy part of our newest

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:14.489 
behind me is a guy part of our newest
processor<00:00:13.209> it's<00:00:13.929> got<00:00:14.139> a<00:00:14.169> brand<00:00:14.469> new

00:00:14.489 --> 00:00:14.499 
processor it's got a brand new

00:00:14.499 --> 00:00:16.830 
processor it's got a brand new
architecture<00:00:15.249> that<00:00:15.519> is<00:00:15.909> codenamed<00:00:16.240> Isaiah

architecture that is codenamed Isaiah
the<00:00:17.260> architecture<00:00:17.860> is<00:00:18.030> revolutionary

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:19.030 
the architecture is revolutionary

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:21.510 
the architecture is revolutionary
because<00:00:19.500> we've<00:00:20.500> been<00:00:20.680> able<00:00:20.800> to<00:00:20.950> double<00:00:21.250> the

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:21.520 
because we've been able to double the

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.340 
because we've been able to double the
performance<00:00:22.090> of<00:00:22.240> our<00:00:22.330> current<00:00:22.750> parts<00:00:23.080> through

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:23.350 
performance of our current parts through

sort of impossible and to to do that

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.740 
sort of impossible and to to do that
what<00:00:33.220> we<00:00:33.340> had<00:00:33.520> to<00:00:33.670> do<00:00:33.790> is<00:00:33.910> invent<00:00:34.180> a<00:00:34.240> total<00:00:34.660> new

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:34.750 
what we had to do is invent a total new

environments power consumption isn't

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.430 
environments power consumption isn't
necessary<00:01:09.580> I<00:01:09.670> mean<00:01:10.120> you<00:01:10.210> have<00:01:10.450> to<00:01:11.020> have<00:01:11.170> good

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:11.440 
necessary I mean you have to have good

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.710 
necessary I mean you have to have good
power<00:01:11.650> consumption<00:01:12.280> you<00:01:12.520> can't<00:01:12.790> live<00:01:13.270> because

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:13.720 
power consumption you can't live because

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.500 
power consumption you can't live because
it's<00:01:13.900> battery-powered<00:01:14.790> so<00:01:15.790> the<00:01:16.000> trick<00:01:16.240> is<00:01:16.479> how

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:16.510 
it's battery-powered so the trick is how

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:18.600 
it's battery-powered so the trick is how
do<00:01:16.780> you<00:01:16.900> get<00:01:17.080> your<00:01:17.170> battery<00:01:17.560> consumption<00:01:18.159> low

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:18.610 
do you get your battery consumption low

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:22.680 
do you get your battery consumption low
but<00:01:19.420> provide<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:21.310> performance<00:01:21.790> the<00:01:22.330> modern

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:22.690 
but provide the performance the modern

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:25.350 
but provide the performance the modern

performance good enough that actually
has<00:01:32.500> quite<00:01:32.680> a<00:01:32.770> few<00:01:32.920> design<00:01:33.310> wins<00:01:33.549> what<00:01:34.210> we

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:34.330 
has quite a few design wins what we

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:35.700 
has quite a few design wins what we
tried<00:01:34.570> to<00:01:34.600> do<00:01:34.900> with<00:01:35.020> the<00:01:35.200> new<00:01:35.350> isiah

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:35.710

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:42.460 
performance at the same power so for

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.609 
performance at the same power so for
people<00:01:42.670> that<00:01:42.850> wanted<00:01:43.360> more<00:01:43.630> performance<00:01:44.259> than

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:44.619 
people that wanted more performance than

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:46.499 
people that wanted more performance than
our<00:01:44.740> current<00:01:45.070> products<00:01:45.400> offer<00:01:45.610> they<00:01:46.330> could

00:01:46.499 --> 00:01:46.509 
our current products offer they could

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:47.880 
our current products offer they could
get<00:01:46.689> that<00:01:46.840> performance<00:01:47.320> but<00:01:47.500> they<00:01:47.619> wouldn't

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:47.890 
get that performance but they wouldn't

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:49.469 
get that performance but they wouldn't
have<00:01:48.009> to<00:01:48.159> give<00:01:48.340> up<00:01:48.520> and<00:01:48.790> he<00:01:48.850> it<00:01:49.150> would<00:01:49.299> need

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:49.479 
have to give up and he it would need

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:50.670 
have to give up and he it would need
bigger<00:01:49.689> batteries<00:01:50.140> they<00:01:50.259> wouldn't<00:01:50.470> have<00:01:50.590> to

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:50.680 
bigger batteries they wouldn't have to

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.740 
bigger batteries they wouldn't have to
give<00:01:50.830> up<00:01:50.950> power<00:01:51.130> supply<00:01:51.610> to<00:01:52.000> get<00:01:52.150> I<00:01:52.330> mean<00:01:52.600> give

give up power supply to get I mean give

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.620 
give up power supply to get I mean give
up<00:01:52.900> battery<00:01:53.890> life<00:01:54.130> or<00:01:54.159> anything<00:01:54.490> else<00:01:54.790> the

up battery life or anything else the

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.080 
up battery life or anything else the
other<00:01:55.659> thing<00:01:56.080> we<00:01:56.229> did<00:01:56.439> is<00:01:56.650> we<00:01:57.400> make<00:01:57.790> the<00:01:57.939> new

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.090 
other thing we did is we make the new

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.179 
other thing we did is we make the new
part<00:01:58.450> perfectly<00:01:59.320> compatible

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:00.189 
part perfectly compatible

part perfectly compatible
PNN<00:02:00.970> package<00:02:01.329> compatible<00:02:01.900> with<00:02:02.020> our<00:02:02.200> current

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:02.470 
PNN package compatible with our current

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:05.910 
PNN package compatible with our current
part<00:02:02.890> so<00:02:03.490> one<00:02:03.790> board<00:02:04.150> can<00:02:04.450> support<00:02:04.810> both<00:02:05.110> what

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920 
part so one board can support both what

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.069 
part so one board can support both what
this<00:02:06.130> approach<00:02:06.520> means<00:02:06.820> designers<00:02:07.479> is<00:02:07.780> that

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:08.079 
this approach means designers is that

00:02:08.079 --> 00:02:11.010 
this approach means designers is that
they<00:02:08.229> can<00:02:08.409> build<00:02:08.649> one<00:02:09.009> proper<00:02:09.729> product<00:02:10.690> design

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.020
