in<00:02:55.650> a<00:02:55.740> weird<00:02:55.920> way<00:02:56.040> you<00:02:56.130> remove<00:02:56.490> the<00:02:56.640> people

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
from but that's I suppose what clubbing

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.050 
from but that's I suppose what clubbing
is<00:02:58.260> ultimately<00:02:58.680> about<00:02:58.860> see<00:02:59.520> if<00:02:59.580> you<00:02:59.670> compare

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
is ultimately about see if you compare

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.220 
is ultimately about see if you compare
to<00:03:00.240> if<00:03:00.300> we<00:03:00.450> were<00:03:00.540> in<00:03:00.630> an<00:03:00.720> empty

to if we were in an empty

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.190 
to if we were in an empty
yeah<00:03:01.980> absolutely<00:03:02.970> and<00:03:03.239> it<00:03:03.390> would<00:03:03.510> still<00:03:03.750> feel

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
yeah absolutely and it would still feel

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.640 
yeah absolutely and it would still feel
like<00:03:04.530> the<00:03:04.800> same<00:03:05.069> thing<00:03:05.840> the<00:03:06.840> architecture<00:03:07.620> of

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
like the same thing the architecture of

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.600 
like the same thing the architecture of
head<00:03:07.890> nism<00:03:08.280> is<00:03:08.910> actually<00:03:10.069> shabby<00:03:11.069> four<00:03:11.400> walls
