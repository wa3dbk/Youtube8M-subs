one<00:02:43.160> of<00:02:43.250> the<00:02:43.340> cool<00:02:43.489> things<00:02:43.550> about<00:02:43.910> the<00:02:44.180> mules

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
one of the cool things about the mules

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.590 
one of the cool things about the mules
is<00:02:45.019> this<00:02:45.290> is<00:02:45.470> your<00:02:45.650> air<00:02:45.769> intake<00:02:46.100> on<00:02:46.310> them<00:02:46.600> so

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 
is this is your air intake on them so

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.660 
is this is your air intake on them so
the<00:02:47.690> air<00:02:47.840> is<00:02:47.870> in<00:02:48.170> taked<00:02:48.380> hi<00:02:48.620> if<00:02:49.130> you<00:02:49.340> notice

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
the air is in taked hi if you notice

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.580 
the air is in taked hi if you notice
there's<00:02:49.850> one<00:02:50.060> on<00:02:50.209> each<00:02:50.360> side<00:02:50.410> so<00:02:51.410> you've<00:02:51.530> got

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
there's one on each side so you've got

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.520 
there's one on each side so you've got
one<00:02:51.709> right<00:02:52.070> over<00:02:52.130> there<00:02:52.519> and<00:02:53.290> then<00:02:54.290> you've<00:02:54.380> got

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
one right over there and then you've got

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:56.860 
one right over there and then you've got
one<00:02:54.769> here<00:02:55.100> and<00:02:55.250> so<00:02:55.730> the<00:02:55.850> air<00:02:56.030> is<00:02:56.060> intake<00:02:56.540> here

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
one here and so the air is intake here

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:58.900 
one here and so the air is intake here
it<00:02:57.440> gets<00:02:57.590> actually<00:02:58.010> drawn<00:02:58.250> down<00:02:58.459> this<00:02:58.640> pipe

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
it gets actually drawn down this pipe

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:02.470 
it gets actually drawn down this pipe
and<00:02:59.269> there's<00:03:00.260> a<00:03:00.320> hose<00:03:01.239> connected<00:03:02.239> to<00:03:02.360> this

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
and there's a hose connected to this

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:08.800 
and there's a hose connected to this
pipe<00:03:02.750> and<00:03:04.180> and<00:03:05.440> then<00:03:06.440> that<00:03:06.620> hose<00:03:07.720> connects<00:03:08.720> to

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
pipe and and then that hose connects to

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:11.560 
pipe and and then that hose connects to
the<00:03:08.900> air<00:03:09.019> cleaner<00:03:09.200> here<00:03:09.680> and<00:03:09.920> so<00:03:10.670> if<00:03:11.209> I<00:03:11.329> in

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:11.570 
the air cleaner here and so if I in

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:13.270 
the air cleaner here and so if I in
taking<00:03:11.870> that<00:03:11.930> air<00:03:12.140> up<00:03:12.290> high<00:03:12.470> we<00:03:12.829> get<00:03:13.010> cleaner

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
taking that air up high we get cleaner

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.280 
taking that air up high we get cleaner
air<00:03:13.549> there's<00:03:13.790> less<00:03:13.850> dust<00:03:14.239> up<00:03:14.420> high<00:03:14.600> and<00:03:14.870> then

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
air there's less dust up high and then

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:16.420 
air there's less dust up high and then

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:13.850 
a lot it has a insulating material here

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:16.060 
a lot it has a insulating material here
on<00:04:13.940> the<00:04:14.030> bottom<00:04:14.150> of<00:04:14.390> the<00:04:14.480> top<00:04:14.690> and<00:04:14.930> so<00:04:15.620> it<00:04:15.770> helps
