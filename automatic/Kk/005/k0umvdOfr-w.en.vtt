00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 hello friends of the movie welcome to 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.270
 dvd critic and typical highschool 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.379
 Hollywood movies can be so incredible 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.210
 but can be boring sometimes 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:10.980
 also be very funny and today it should 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.750
 I first turned off so in detail 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.059
 that has never experienced so and so 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.480
 I mean the dances can detain 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.480
 to be deadly 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:33.660
 detention detention can be deadly 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.310
 is from the year 2011, 89 minutes 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.400
 and has in the original the title return 

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:39.720
 already and is a fsk 16 movie and that 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.520
 a high school movie is one 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.840
 interesting combination but why go 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.430
 the first time we actually have one 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.960
 a lot of high school kids a girl that 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.290
 an absolute absolute outsider 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.730
 is miley jones she has fallen in love 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:52.739
 a type of school at all 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.830
 known quite popular played by 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.360
 josh hutcherson and yes, really 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:59.640
 she does not come to everyone laughs at them 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.410
 everyone makes them ready and we have 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.420
 Start this cool this clichÃ© of 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.800
 outsiders hear such great athletes 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.370
 Everything packed together at this high 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.770
 school 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:10.620
 It would not be a serial killer 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.150
 the scream series incredibly 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:14.340
 and murdered by the students 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.590
 with the name kindle brighter 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.659
 yes that sounds bizarre and that's exactly what it is 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.580
 that this movie is about the 89th 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.320
 minutes incredibly insane 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.300
 interesting scenes that are partly absurd 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.520
 are fucked up dialogues if you are honest 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.200
 and so many scenes are all for 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.240
 Alone as a small movie already 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.950
 could serve and actually more like that 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.930
 like youtube and much less 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.490
 like a high quality produced movie 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.719
 quite funny how to make this movie 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.430
 should describe and is in the reason 

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:39.960
 this topic of a serial killer because 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.579
 you have to find it and then even 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.829
 ultimately he with the help of one 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.509
 time travel something of trashy and 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.860
 that he tries somehow 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.539
 but to actually lift this film 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.159
 not matter is you look these 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:52.890
 film and always asks only what the 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.750
 fuck is going on and just understand 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.640
 not what this movie wants from you 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.710
 but often different is pretty funny and different 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.119
 funny in some moments or another 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.770
 just stupid and excellent 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.210
 You can always smile but have 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.469
 then the feeling is not really a 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.490
 somehow he feels he has seen film 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:08.130
 also much longer 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.810
 without being lengthy something very heavy 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:10.860
 I want to say that is that the dancers 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.440
 I do not have any movies yet 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.730
 seen and I'm crazy for 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.990
 to play again is there 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.940
 actually works and with ten million 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:19.490
 dollar this movie just once a 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.290
 You had to be on budget 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:22.910
 Close out of the optical, the film is on 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.670
 a top-level especially what effects 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.960
 and especially creative games with 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.790
 the cut program actually 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:30.200
 pretty cool and so on 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.590
 that the people a film in which it on 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.210
 The End 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.770
 damn it what it's about the 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:35.480
 somehow funny is somehow 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:37.730
 also like to see twice 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.110
 just not good it's hard me 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:42.050
 believe it better the more often you him 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:43.310
 looks and strikingly not easy on 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:45.080
 So the point is coming to my point 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.490
 confusion at this point likes and 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.510
 wonder where my god is what that is 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:48.890
 now for a movie that should 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.630
 maybe we'll have a look at the trailer 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.910
 over here and I know that today 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:55.190
 a review that was so semi-criticism free 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.300
 but sometimes it's just how it is and 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.580
 I give this movie as the 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:01.430
 horror comedy actually a cool one 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:03.020
 genre somehow wacky five out of ten 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:04.280
 possible points entrenched me with it 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:06.320
 right in the middle because the film is 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.270
 neither good nor bad after special 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:10.610
 but somehow a little bit unique i 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:12.710
 It can be difficult to explain overall 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:15.170
 just the same evaluation then also from 

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:16.550
 me and yes that was it for me today 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:17.780
 that gives a certain amount of thumb down 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:19.340
 think for this video that can 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:22.430
 of course, my videos always do 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:24.080
 are bad and otherwise it works 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:26.180
 of course, tomorrow at 15 o'clock a new one 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:30.400
 Criticism and until then I hope you are 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:30.400
 dare again , of course, at 3
