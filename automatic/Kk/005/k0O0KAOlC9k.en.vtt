 It is crafted on a workbench with 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.970
 the aid of the four blocks of obsidian 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.949

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.750

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:51.899
 bookshelves bookshelves done here 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:55.050
 in this way given cue dachshunds 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:01:00.740
 now begin the story with a clever table 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:02.390
 enchantment so table enchantment 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:04.370
 as the friendly name enchants 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:08.080
 any items gives us 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:11.080
 additional properties now here we are 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.080
 let's say 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.070
 take less you can enchant 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:21.780
 any weapon and any kind of armor 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:28.040
 you can not enchant only bow and fishing rod well 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:31.800
 and everything else except here is a weapon 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:35.270
 tools and armor armor are basically 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:38.780
 enchant only well as the clear 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:44.220
 since she brian will be read on 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:52.080
 protection against damage to things which 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:54.090
 adds us health here's the subject 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.490
 which we want to enchant put under 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.430
 the book the book opens and appears 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:02.430
 Here is such a list 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:03.380
 It is generally every Rogalev means 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:07.050
 letter 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:10.200
 English alphabet it is taken from some 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:13.620
 the games of the 90s I do not remember exactly 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:17.690
 name but it does not matter, we are interested 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:19.709
 tsiferki as they designate level 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.410
 spells that we want to cast on 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:26.430
 our enchant my subject 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:28.290
 these tsiferki this level character as we 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.570
 I remember now I am in the mode 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.190
 creative so i don't have this 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:34.110
 strip on where I twist now 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.750
 mouse over this bar should be 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.080
 such a green striped 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:41.440
 which is up to the floor 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:45.400
 replenished when we gain experience experience 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:47.610
 drops out of any mob the biggest 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:51.240
 experience that can be knocked out and malice 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:54.730
 the dragonon's roll 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:58.690
 20 thousand units of experience is just a bear 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:02.260
 how much and here for example they destroyed a sheep 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:05.470
 we have this glowing wheel and then 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:10.090
 there is a unit of experience on her take hear 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:13.630
 the ringing sound and we have filled 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:17.640
 chocolate when the scale of experience is filled to 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:20.740
 end she goes to the beginning and 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:22.200
 throw us a level that is 

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:25.450
 pumping system 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:28.860
 the more levels the better for us these 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:31.390
 level and just need to buy 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:34.780
 regions for applying a certain 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:36.910
 spells on our subject here if the table 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:40.270
 does not improve in any way here 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:41.709
 put it and try to enchant 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:44.250
 item then we can enchant it 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:51.070
 maximum level five 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:55.120
 and quite rare here that has become and 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:56.980
 can improve start with this 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:02.560
 the tables are improving like this 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:04.299
 we put a cupboard next to the table like 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:07.480
 find out correctly and we put it 

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:10.060
 very simple from the closet and starts to fly 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:12.159
 hieroglyphs well let's start here 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.819
 did the hieroglyph again from this 

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:16.060
 alphabet 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:16.930
 This means that we have improved the table. 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:21.970
 now we put 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:27.190
 the thing you want to enchant so you can 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:30.510
 do a long time but here is the sixth level 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:33.900
 appeared the sixth level can be put 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:42.389
 double hard starts flying two characters 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:42.389
 now we can improve our weapons 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:46.180
 come on 

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:54.590
 in general, the level is now rising 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:55.660
 spell that we can put on 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:59.090
 our subject 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:01.880
 it should be said that tables and cabinets can not 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:03.800
 put it like this between them 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:04.330
 there must be a distance so they work 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:08.810
 will not 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:10.699
 became left without improvement so too 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:14.720
 it cannot because there are two cells between them 

00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:16.340
 can be put only for one but you can 

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:20.349
 put them like this to 

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:26.180
 between them was one cell 

00:05:20.349 --> 00:05:27.680
 only diagonally will there be 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:29.780
 fly anyway the hieroglyphs will go 

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:32.150
 improvement can be put like this 

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:39.220
 Again, that's how it flew 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:41.840
 hieroglyph answer will also become better 

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:46.280
 somehow imperceptibly but he is level seven 

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:48.199
 flashed so go to the libraries 

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:52.849
 build libraries like this 

00:05:48.199 --> 00:05:54.650
 useless such here too the best 

00:05:52.849 --> 00:05:59.090
 library type 

00:05:54.650 --> 00:06:02.220
 this is such a need to cover 

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:04.910
 on top here is our library 

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:04.910
 but
