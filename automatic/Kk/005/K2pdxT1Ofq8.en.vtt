fit a rail on here and we'd like to

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:48.219 
fit a rail on here and we'd like to
design<00:00:46.850> already<00:00:47.179> so<00:00:47.510> we<00:00:47.629> just<00:00:47.809> made<00:00:47.989> it<00:00:48.019> with<00:00:48.199> a

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:48.229 
design already so we just made it with a

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:50.919 
design already so we just made it with a
su<00:00:48.469> set<00:00:48.710> scope<00:00:49.010> which<00:00:49.460> you<00:00:49.639> usually<00:00:50.420> see<00:00:50.839> it
