the original vitamins were a little
goofy<00:03:27.260> but<00:03:27.470> that's<00:03:27.920> what<00:03:28.040> I<00:03:28.070> loved<00:03:28.340> about<00:03:28.430> them

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
goofy but that's what I loved about them

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.040 
goofy but that's what I loved about them
because<00:03:29.000> there<00:03:29.150> was<00:03:29.240> also<00:03:29.420> such<00:03:29.720> a<00:03:29.750> great

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:30.050 
because there was also such a great

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:31.449 
because there was also such a great
emotional<00:03:30.590> depth<00:03:30.920> and<00:03:31.100> there<00:03:31.190> was<00:03:31.310> still

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:31.459 
emotional depth and there was still

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:33.130 
emotional depth and there was still
awesome<00:03:31.670> action<00:03:32.060> even<00:03:32.390> if<00:03:32.540> it<00:03:32.690> was<00:03:32.810> a<00:03:32.840> little

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:33.140 
awesome action even if it was a little

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:34.990

cheesy<00:03:33.410> attempt<00:03:34.070> and<00:03:34.250> I<00:03:34.310> think<00:03:34.490> it's<00:03:34.610> a<00:03:34.670> lot<00:03:34.910> of

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:35.000 
cheesy attempt and I think it's a lot of

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.760 
cheesy attempt and I think it's a lot of
hatred<00:03:35.240> I<00:03:35.840> know<00:03:35.900> a<00:03:35.959> lot<00:03:36.140> of<00:03:36.200> people<00:03:36.290> actually

me<00:04:54.500> now<00:04:54.650> it's<00:04:54.830> pretty<00:04:55.010> much<00:04:55.160> confirmed<00:04:55.669> that

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:55.880 
me now it's pretty much confirmed that

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:57.820 
me now it's pretty much confirmed that
the<00:04:56.000> low<00:04:56.150> key<00:04:56.389> is<00:04:56.630> going<00:04:56.990> to<00:04:57.110> be<00:04:57.290> the<00:04:57.440> main<00:04:57.620> bill

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:57.830 
the low key is going to be the main bill

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:59.350 
the low key is going to be the main bill
and<00:04:58.010> I<00:04:58.130> think<00:04:58.370> they<00:04:58.490> have<00:04:58.520> such<00:04:58.910> a<00:04:58.940> better

00:04:59.350 --> 00:04:59.360 
and I think they have such a better

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.450 
and I think they have such a better
catalog<00:05:00.080> of<00:05:00.290> villains<00:05:00.650> to<00:05:00.830> choose<00:05:01.100> from<00:05:01.310> I

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:04.750 
don't know why they chose this one I
felt<00:05:02.810> like<00:05:02.960> you<00:05:03.530> know<00:05:03.620> um<00:05:03.860> what's<00:05:04.669> his
