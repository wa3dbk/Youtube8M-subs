 hans podlipnik nicholas jerry and gonzalo 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.180
 lama and christian garín were the 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.800
 chosen by the historic former tennis players 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:52.020
 one would like them to be everything and 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.629
 there are only four places I think 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.520
 is the strongest team we can 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.530
 represent are four players that 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.870
 they come when pretty well 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.000
 they are young very important also for 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.250
 think about the future of tomorrow the 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.380
 Chilean captain thanks the range of 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.780
 possibilities that the four 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.810
 chosen and take the opportunity to detail the 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.460
 qualities that each one offers cristian 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.090
 has its qualities the hand has its 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.250
 qualities 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.100
 cristian is very strong has a tennis 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.490
 very aggressive Gonzalo very alone in the background 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:26.070
 hans has also improved tennis a lot 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:28.110
 offensive and since it also declared an 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.090
 guy that measures almost two meters also not 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.250
 it is easy to find a player in Chile 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.539
 and the caresses 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.910
 characteristics of him but that's why I say 

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:38.310
 that an important mix in the team 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:40.289
 there are many expectations for this 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.300
 season of the best rackets of the 

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:44.850
 country and that is the potential that it has 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:47.610
 this young team does not go unnoticed 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.409
 much less for the former number one of the 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.729
 world and the president of the federation 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:54.659
 for truth that has to be 200 world 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:56.009
 how are you 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.189
 I think it has been a pretty advance 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.890
 fast even though I think that 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:06.120
 still does not stick in the big jump that 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:09.050
 they would hit 18 years 19 years 200 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:09.050
 it is not bad 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:14.930
 As I say, I think they are with many 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:18.380
 very young possibilities and I think the 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:19.790
 207 stick a good tournament or win a 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:22.010
 big tournament that has gotten between 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:24.709
 concerts I see in some of them 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:27.170
 maybe not at all but I think that between 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:29.270
 the four that we have some to pay 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:33.440
 the jump and the climbing that between the 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:35.660
 best 100 in the world the truth is that 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.910
 a team from a very young average 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:40.610
 there are three players who are there between 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:43.930
 the 21 20 years with many possibilities 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:47.650
 to arm 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.609
 several several double alternatives one u 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.629
 other 

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:50.890
 who knows who the 

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:53.230
 singlistas who can be the 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.209
 doubles that is the captain and marcelo who 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:57.269
 are the two captains are going to have to 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:03:02.079
 work hard to generate a team 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:04.260
 27 21 19 and 18 are the ages of bot 

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:07.180
 livni the mesh ri and garin 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:09.430
 respectively, the four elected by 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.700
 the Olympic hero and the former number one 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:14.829
 world that seek to make the dream come true 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:17.579
 to go back to chile to the first planes 

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:17.579
 of the world tennis
