okay guys what's been seven days I've
just<00:00:07.220> taken<00:00:07.399> hydrometer<00:00:08.180> reading<00:00:08.330> I<00:00:08.809> don't

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:09.320 
just taken hydrometer reading I don't

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.020 
just taken hydrometer reading I don't
think<00:00:09.680> I'm<00:00:09.799> gonna<00:00:09.920> be<00:00:10.100> able<00:00:10.219> to<00:00:10.400> get<00:00:10.910> the

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:11.030 
think I'm gonna be able to get the

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:13.779 
think I'm gonna be able to get the
camera<00:00:11.389> to<00:00:11.510> pick<00:00:11.660> it<00:00:11.779> up<00:00:11.869> for<00:00:12.110> you<00:00:12.230> but<00:00:13.039> I<00:00:13.100> have

00:00:13.779 --> 00:00:13.789 
camera to pick it up for you but I have

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:17.170 
camera to pick it up for you but I have
hit<00:00:13.969> the<00:00:14.090> target<00:00:14.480> gravity<00:00:14.900> which<00:00:15.170> is<00:00:15.820> one<00:00:16.820> zero

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:17.180 
hit the target gravity which is one zero

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.710 
hit the target gravity which is one zero
one<00:00:17.420> zero<00:00:17.480> and<00:00:18.790> it<00:00:19.790> looks<00:00:19.910> quite<00:00:20.150> well<00:00:20.300> carbs

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:20.720 
one zero and it looks quite well carbs

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.680 
one zero and it looks quite well carbs
already<00:00:21.080> and<00:00:21.440> it's<00:00:22.100> pretty<00:00:22.310> clear<00:00:22.670> but<00:00:23.539> the

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:23.690 
already and it's pretty clear but the

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:26.800 
already and it's pretty clear but the
instructions<00:00:24.230> do<00:00:24.440> suggest<00:00:24.980> a<00:00:25.539> secondary<00:00:26.539> so

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:26.810 
instructions do suggest a secondary so

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:30.939 
instructions do suggest a secondary so
I'm<00:00:27.440> going<00:00:27.680> to<00:00:27.710> write<00:00:27.860> that<00:00:27.890> off<00:00:28.039> now<00:00:29.949> well

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:30.949 
I'm going to write that off now well

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:32.860 
I'm going to write that off now well
okay<00:00:31.280> the<00:00:31.490> rector<00:00:31.880> secondary<00:00:32.360> is<00:00:32.419> under<00:00:32.750> way

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:32.870 
okay the rector secondary is under way

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:38.619 
okay the rector secondary is under way
and<00:00:35.769> you<00:00:36.769> can<00:00:36.920> probably<00:00:37.129> see<00:00:37.429> it's<00:00:38.359> pretty

00:00:38.619 --> 00:00:38.629 
and you can probably see it's pretty

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:44.410 
and you can probably see it's pretty
clear<00:00:39.170> already<00:00:39.409> that<00:00:39.589> being<00:00:42.969> okay<00:00:43.969> guys<00:00:44.179> well

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:44.420 
clear already that being okay guys well

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:46.000 
clear already that being okay guys well
the<00:00:44.569> rector<00:00:44.899> secondary<00:00:45.319> is<00:00:45.379> complete<00:00:45.769> and<00:00:45.949> I

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.010 
the rector secondary is complete and I

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:47.649 
the rector secondary is complete and I
just<00:00:46.190> wanted<00:00:46.370> to<00:00:46.429> show<00:00:46.729> you<00:00:46.760> this<00:00:47.059> it's<00:00:47.420> the

just wanted to show you this it's the

00:00:47.659 --> 00:00:50.410 
just wanted to show you this it's the
end<00:00:48.190> there's<00:00:49.190> where<00:00:49.399> the<00:00:49.429> croizon<00:00:49.819> was<00:00:50.149> quite

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:50.420 
end there's where the croizon was quite

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:51.939 
end there's where the croizon was quite
an<00:00:50.510> interest<00:00:50.809> in<00:00:51.079> their<00:00:51.229> car<00:00:51.469> looks<00:00:51.769> like<00:00:51.829> a

00:00:51.939 --> 00:00:51.949 
an interest in their car looks like a

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:54.160 
an interest in their car looks like a
spool<00:00:52.309> animals<00:00:52.909> being<00:00:53.059> blended<00:00:53.329> in<00:00:53.690> there<00:00:53.899> but

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.170 
spool animals being blended in there but

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.509 
spool animals being blended in there but
also<00:00:55.039> a<00:00:55.249> sort<00:00:55.549> of<00:00:55.609> pink<00:00:55.850> Trump<00:00:56.809> as<00:00:56.989> well<00:00:57.519> I'm

00:00:58.509 --> 00:00:58.519 
also a sort of pink Trump as well I'm

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:00.489 
also a sort of pink Trump as well I'm
not<00:00:58.639> sure<00:00:58.699> you'd<00:00:59.059> be<00:00:59.179> able<00:00:59.269> to<00:00:59.510> wash<00:01:00.289> that

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:00.499 
not sure you'd be able to wash that

00:01:00.499 --> 00:01:02.889 
not sure you'd be able to wash that
yeast<00:01:00.769> and<00:01:01.100> use<00:01:01.249> it<00:01:01.399> for<00:01:01.429> another<00:01:01.579> bit<00:01:01.999> or<00:01:02.719> that

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:02.899 
yeast and use it for another bit or that

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:08.590 
yeast and use it for another bit or that
could<00:01:03.109> be<00:01:03.229> interested<00:01:03.799> if<00:01:03.920> I<00:01:04.010> did<00:01:07.420> okay<00:01:08.420> guys

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600 
could be interested if I did okay guys

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.429 
could be interested if I did okay guys
well<00:01:08.869> being<00:01:09.740> back<00:01:09.979> to<00:01:10.130> the<00:01:10.219> secondary<00:01:11.439> the

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:12.439 
well being back to the secondary the

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:14.319 
well being back to the secondary the
instructions<00:01:13.280> suggest<00:01:13.430> leaving<00:01:13.969> it<00:01:14.090> there

00:01:14.319 --> 00:01:14.329 
instructions suggest leaving it there

00:01:14.329 --> 00:01:18.690 
instructions suggest leaving it there
for<00:01:14.689> one<00:01:15.079> to<00:01:15.259> two<00:01:15.439> weeks<00:01:16.659> and<00:01:17.659> keeping

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:18.700 
for one to two weeks and keeping

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.420 
for one to two weeks and keeping
temperature<00:01:19.840> maximum<00:01:20.840> 20<00:01:21.350> degrees<00:01:21.710> so<00:01:21.979> I'll

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:22.430 
temperature maximum 20 degrees so I'll

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:23.889 
temperature maximum 20 degrees so I'll
probably<00:01:22.579> be<00:01:22.789> moving<00:01:23.180> it<00:01:23.270> somewhere<00:01:23.420> slightly

00:01:23.889 --> 00:01:23.899 
probably be moving it somewhere slightly

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:27.370 
probably be moving it somewhere slightly
cooler<00:01:24.320> and<00:01:24.670> but<00:01:25.670> yeah<00:01:25.820> did<00:01:26.780> the<00:01:26.869> hydrometer

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:27.380 
cooler and but yeah did the hydrometer

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.529 
cooler and but yeah did the hydrometer
reading<00:01:27.469> as<00:01:27.710> I<00:01:27.799> mentioned<00:01:28.219> 101<00:01:29.030> Oh<00:01:29.149> which<00:01:29.420> is

00:01:29.529 --> 00:01:29.539 
reading as I mentioned 101 Oh which is

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:32.819 
reading as I mentioned 101 Oh which is
on<00:01:29.719> target<00:01:29.960> and<00:01:30.729> but<00:01:31.729> as<00:01:31.880> I<00:01:32.000> always<00:01:32.270> like<00:01:32.359> to<00:01:32.539> do

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:32.829 
on target and but as I always like to do

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:43.469 
on target and but as I always like to do
let's<00:01:33.829> give<00:01:34.009> it<00:01:34.039> a<00:01:34.159> little<00:01:34.310> try<00:01:34.579> in<00:01:34.640> this<00:01:34.820> stage

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:43.479 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:47.730 

I<00:01:45.149> mean<00:01:46.149> it's<00:01:46.270> pretty<00:01:46.479> it's<00:01:47.229> pretty<00:01:47.320> well

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:47.740 
I mean it's pretty it's pretty well

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.469 
I mean it's pretty it's pretty well
carbonated<00:01:48.490> already<00:01:48.789> and<00:01:49.439> it's<00:01:50.439> fairly<00:01:50.770> clear

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
carbonated already and it's fairly clear

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.419 
carbonated already and it's fairly clear
don't<00:01:52.479> know<00:01:52.600> how<00:01:52.780> we<00:01:52.840> I<00:01:53.380> mean<00:01:54.070> obviously<00:01:54.159> it's

00:01:54.419 --> 00:01:54.429 
don't know how we I mean obviously it's

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:55.200 
don't know how we I mean obviously it's
not<00:01:54.490> crystal<00:01:54.939> clear

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.210
