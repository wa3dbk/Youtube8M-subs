of<00:02:04.200> what<00:02:05.100> we<00:02:05.219> get<00:02:05.369> is<00:02:05.780> draw<00:02:07.729> solonian<00:02:08.729> and

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
of what we get is draw solonian and

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.690

we're gonna grab one from outside of the
Karelian<00:02:15.900> system<00:02:16.230> and<00:02:16.350> just<00:02:16.470> drop<00:02:16.770> them<00:02:17.010> into

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
Karelian system and just drop them into

Karelian system and just drop them into
here<00:02:17.460> maybe<00:02:17.640> grab<00:02:17.850> one<00:02:18.030> from<00:02:18.240> the<00:02:18.390> sector<00:02:18.900> we

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
here maybe grab one from the sector we

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.400 
here maybe grab one from the sector we
instead<00:02:20.190> get<00:02:20.460> a<00:02:20.490> variant<00:02:21.300> on<00:02:21.930> a<00:02:21.990> pre-existing

tunnel delving and so forth that you

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.980 
tunnel delving and so forth that you

could use there's 9 of these and either
fit<00:03:07.320> them<00:03:07.470> into<00:03:07.590> an<00:03:07.770> existing<00:03:08.040> campaign<00:03:08.700> or

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
fit them into an existing campaign or

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.270 
fit them into an existing campaign or

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
use them essentially in order as a way

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.490 
use them essentially in order as a way
to<00:03:11.340> basically<00:03:11.760> just<00:03:11.970> bounce<00:03:12.300> around<00:03:12.600> this

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
to basically just bounce around this

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.500 
to basically just bounce around this
setting<00:03:14.130> and<00:03:14.370> kind<00:03:14.610> of<00:03:14.670> get<00:03:14.760> a<00:03:14.790> tour<00:03:15.090> of<00:03:15.120> what's

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
setting and kind of get a tour of what's

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.390 
setting and kind of get a tour of what's
there<00:03:15.780> it's<00:03:16.350> pretty<00:03:16.650> neat<00:03:16.860> kind<00:03:17.250> of<00:03:17.310> would

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
there it's pretty neat kind of would

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.250 
there it's pretty neat kind of would
have<00:03:17.430> liked<00:03:17.700> to<00:03:17.970> have<00:03:18.300> an<00:03:18.420> actual<00:03:18.720> adventure

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
have liked to have an actual adventure

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:20.600 
have liked to have an actual adventure
but<00:03:19.680> it's<00:03:19.800> needs<00:03:19.980> to<00:03:20.040> be<00:03:20.100> able<00:03:20.190> to<00:03:20.280> fit<00:03:20.490> these

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
but it's needs to be able to fit these

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:22.340 
but it's needs to be able to fit these
into<00:03:20.880> pre-existing<00:03:21.180> campaigns<00:03:21.960> because<00:03:22.230> at

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
into pre-existing campaigns because at

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:23.600 
into pre-existing campaigns because at
this<00:03:22.470> point<00:03:22.830> a<00:03:22.890> lot<00:03:23.010> of<00:03:23.130> folks<00:03:23.280> have<00:03:23.400> probably

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
this point a lot of folks have probably

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:25.790 
this point a lot of folks have probably
