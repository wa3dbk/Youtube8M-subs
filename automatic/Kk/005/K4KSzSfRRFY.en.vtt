running<00:00:11.670> biomechanics<00:00:12.540> last<00:00:13.080> week<00:00:13.320> we

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
running biomechanics last week we

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.320 
running biomechanics last week we
focused<00:00:13.620> on<00:00:13.920> the<00:00:14.010> anterior<00:00:14.400> oblique<00:00:14.580> systems

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
focused on the anterior oblique systems

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:16.820 
focused on the anterior oblique systems
working<00:00:15.540> on<00:00:15.809> the<00:00:15.930> front<00:00:16.139> side<00:00:16.410> of<00:00:16.439> the<00:00:16.650> body

to consist of your lats and your
contralateral<00:00:26.400> glutes<00:00:26.779> working<00:00:27.779> along

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
contralateral glutes working along

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:29.900 
contralateral glutes working along
together<00:00:28.320> at<00:00:28.680> the<00:00:28.769> same<00:00:28.949> time<00:00:29.250> going<00:00:29.820> through

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
together at the same time going through

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.000 
together at the same time going through
your<00:00:30.150> gait<00:00:30.300> cycle<00:00:30.510> so<00:00:31.109> if<00:00:31.199> we<00:00:31.320> watch<00:00:31.470> me<00:00:31.680> doing

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:32.010 
your gait cycle so if we watch me doing

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:34.549 
your gait cycle so if we watch me doing
the<00:00:32.129> sprint<00:00:32.460> right<00:00:32.940> here<00:00:33.180> you<00:00:33.360> will<00:00:33.449> notice<00:00:33.720> my

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
the sprint right here you will notice my

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.799 
the sprint right here you will notice my
right<00:00:34.830> and<00:00:35.070> my<00:00:35.129> right<00:00:35.489> arm<00:00:35.519> kicks<00:00:35.970> back<00:00:36.210> my

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
right and my right arm kicks back my

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.080 
right and my right arm kicks back my
left<00:00:37.080> glute<00:00:37.260> will<00:00:37.710> kick<00:00:37.860> back<00:00:38.090> simultaneously

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
left glute will kick back simultaneously

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.750 
left glute will kick back simultaneously
as<00:00:39.269> my<00:00:39.690> left<00:00:40.080> arm<00:00:40.290> kicks<00:00:40.530> back<00:00:40.739> my<00:00:41.250> right<00:00:41.489> foot

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
as my left arm kicks back my right foot

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.030 
as my left arm kicks back my right foot
kicks<00:00:42.299> back<00:00:42.680> simultaneously<00:00:43.680> so<00:00:43.890> it's

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
kicks back simultaneously so it's

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.860 
kicks back simultaneously so it's
extension<00:00:44.580> of<00:00:44.699> the<00:00:44.820> arm<00:00:45.089> an<00:00:45.180> extension<00:00:45.659> of<00:00:45.750> the

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
extension of the arm an extension of the

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.930 
extension of the arm an extension of the
opposite<00:00:46.350> hip<00:00:46.559> that<00:00:46.979> normally<00:00:47.370> propels<00:00:47.790> you

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
opposite hip that normally propels you

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.119 
opposite hip that normally propels you
into<00:00:48.000> gait<00:00:48.449> if<00:00:48.780> we<00:00:49.440> can<00:00:49.589> master<00:00:49.979> that

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
into gait if we can master that

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.619 
into gait if we can master that
correctly<00:00:50.549> and<00:00:50.610> get<00:00:50.820> those<00:00:51.000> muscles<00:00:51.210> working

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
correctly and get those muscles working

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.180 
correctly and get those muscles working
the<00:00:51.930> way<00:00:52.019> they're<00:00:52.170> supposed<00:00:52.290> to<00:00:52.620> but<00:00:53.040> you're

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
the way they're supposed to but you're

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.070 
the way they're supposed to but you're
really<00:00:53.430> going<00:00:53.729> to<00:00:53.850> get<00:00:54.000> an<00:00:54.330> efficient<00:00:54.750> sprint

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:55.080 
really going to get an efficient sprint

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.410 
really going to get an efficient sprint
the<00:00:55.890> exercise<00:00:56.400> we're<00:00:56.670> going<00:00:56.790> to<00:00:56.970> use<00:00:57.180> to

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
the exercise we're going to use to

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.420 
the exercise we're going to use to
activate<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.110> posterior<00:00:58.500> oblique<00:00:59.010> system

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
activate the posterior oblique system

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.430 
activate the posterior oblique system
and<00:00:59.670> improve<00:01:00.119> your<00:01:00.330> running<00:01:00.479> dynamics<00:01:01.199> it's

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
and improve your running dynamics it's

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.320 
and improve your running dynamics it's
going<00:01:01.619> to<00:01:01.739> be<00:01:01.860> a<00:01:02.129> contra<00:01:02.670> lateral<00:01:02.879> stepping

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:03.330 
going to be a contra lateral stepping

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:05.329 
going to be a contra lateral stepping
pool<00:01:03.750> we're<00:01:04.260> going<00:01:04.379> to<00:01:04.440> use<00:01:04.589> a<00:01:04.619> cable<00:01:04.920> machine

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
pool we're going to use a cable machine

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.190 
pool we're going to use a cable machine
for<00:01:05.580> this<00:01:05.850> so<00:01:06.240> right<00:01:06.390> here<00:01:06.600> I'm<00:01:06.689> going<00:01:06.869> to<00:01:07.020> grab

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
for this so right here I'm going to grab

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.240 
for this so right here I'm going to grab
with<00:01:07.350> my<00:01:07.500> right<00:01:07.770> hand

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
with my right hand

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.100 
with my right hand
and<00:01:08.850> then<00:01:09.000> I'm<00:01:09.090> going<00:01:09.240> to<00:01:09.299> step<00:01:09.540> back<00:01:09.600> with<00:01:09.810> my

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
and then I'm going to step back with my

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.109 
and then I'm going to step back with my
left<00:01:10.350> leg<00:01:10.470> so<00:01:11.070> this<00:01:11.280> is<00:01:11.430> really<00:01:11.670> going<00:01:11.790> to<00:01:11.970> be

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
left leg so this is really going to be

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.210 
left leg so this is really going to be
the<00:01:12.420> exact<00:01:12.780> opposite<00:01:13.350> of<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.800> movement<00:01:14.160> that

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
the exact opposite of the movement that

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.980 
the exact opposite of the movement that
I<00:01:14.280> did<00:01:14.520> last<00:01:14.790> week<00:01:14.970> one<00:01:15.480> thing<00:01:15.690> I<00:01:15.750> want<00:01:15.930> you

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
I did last week one thing I want you

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.690 
I did last week one thing I want you
being<00:01:16.200> conscientious<00:01:16.740> of<00:01:17.070> is<00:01:17.370> that<00:01:17.550> your

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
being conscientious of is that your

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.730 
being conscientious of is that your
posture<00:01:17.940> is<00:01:18.240> completely<00:01:18.810> set<00:01:18.990> in<00:01:19.110> line<00:01:19.290> your

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
posture is completely set in line your

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.950 
posture is completely set in line your
thoracic<00:01:20.070> spine<00:01:20.280> is<00:01:20.700> completely<00:01:20.820> extended<00:01:21.600> my

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
thoracic spine is completely extended my

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.200 
thoracic spine is completely extended my
spine<00:01:22.320> is<00:01:22.530> neutral<00:01:22.760> so<00:01:23.760> I'm<00:01:23.850> not<00:01:24.000> looking

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
spine is neutral so I'm not looking

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.150 
spine is neutral so I'm not looking
forward<00:01:24.690> if<00:01:25.020> you<00:01:25.140> start<00:01:25.440> moving<00:01:25.650> in<00:01:25.830> proper

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:26.160 
forward if you start moving in proper

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:27.590 
forward if you start moving in proper
position<00:01:26.580> it's<00:01:26.880> more<00:01:27.150> than<00:01:27.300> likely<00:01:27.480> that

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
position it's more than likely that

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.120 
position it's more than likely that
you're<00:01:27.810> going<00:01:27.840> to<00:01:28.080> end<00:01:28.350> in<00:01:28.710> an<00:01:28.800> improper

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
you're going to end in an improper

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.610 
you're going to end in an improper
position<00:01:29.730> so<00:01:30.180> again<00:01:30.480> find<00:01:31.080> that<00:01:31.260> center<00:01:31.560> of

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:31.620 
position so again find that center of

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:34.100 
position so again find that center of
gravity<00:01:31.850> also<00:01:32.850> keep<00:01:33.330> in<00:01:33.450> mind<00:01:33.660> that<00:01:33.900> this<00:01:34.050> is

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
gravity also keep in mind that this is

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.780 
gravity also keep in mind that this is
not<00:01:34.380> a<00:01:34.590> sagittal<00:01:35.010> a<00:01:35.190> movement<00:01:35.460> if<00:01:35.640> it's

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
not a sagittal a movement if it's

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.970 
not a sagittal a movement if it's
central<00:01:36.150> plane<00:01:36.390> when<00:01:36.960> I<00:01:36.990> come<00:01:37.260> back<00:01:37.440> I'm<00:01:37.770> not

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:37.980 
central plane when I come back I'm not

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:39.320 
central plane when I come back I'm not
going<00:01:38.130> to<00:01:38.190> get<00:01:38.310> full<00:01:38.520> efficiency<00:01:38.909> because

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:39.330 
going to get full efficiency because

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.000 
going to get full efficiency because
remember<00:01:39.450> running<00:01:39.960> is<00:01:40.170> that<00:01:40.200> rotational

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:41.010 
remember running is that rotational
