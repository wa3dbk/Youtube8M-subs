00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.070 
really produces really high quality
power<00:02:08.479> at<00:02:09.479> a<00:02:09.539> fraction<00:02:09.810> of<00:02:10.050> the<00:02:10.140> price<00:02:10.259> so

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
power at a fraction of the price so

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.480 
power at a fraction of the price so
the<00:02:12.530> G<00:02:12.770> streak<00:02:13.130> is<00:02:13.310> a<00:02:13.370> very<00:02:14.150> small<00:02:14.510> moving<00:02:15.050> head
