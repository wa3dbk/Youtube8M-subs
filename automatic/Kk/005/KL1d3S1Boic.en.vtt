 city ​​for being a vertical traveler or if you move vertically 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.420
 the building and you could consider that they gave for dead

 teques that we are sleeping 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.710
 and that we move horizontally does not know 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.159
 remains of the bones but good at that time was the start very 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:28.050
 innovative 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:29.040

 and all that were the communal buildings that there are in Moscow where he left
