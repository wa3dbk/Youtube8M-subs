00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
first one here I don't seem to have a

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.689 
first one here I don't seem to have a
package<00:00:21.119> so<00:00:21.480> I<00:00:21.539> thought<00:00:21.810> hmm<00:00:22.250> maybe<00:00:23.250> this<00:00:23.580> is

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
package so I thought hmm maybe this is

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.250 
package so I thought hmm maybe this is
on<00:00:23.820> my<00:00:23.939> hunter<00:00:24.180> so<00:00:24.510> I<00:00:24.539> thought<00:00:24.720> maybe<00:00:24.779> it's

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
on my hunter so I thought maybe it's

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:26.720 
on my hunter so I thought maybe it's
going<00:00:25.439> to<00:00:25.500> be<00:00:25.590> on<00:00:25.800> my<00:00:25.980> character<00:00:26.279> with<00:00:26.609> the

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
going to be on my character with the

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.849 
going to be on my character with the
most<00:00:26.970> progression<00:00:27.630> that<00:00:27.720> I've<00:00:27.869> done<00:00:28.170> and<00:00:28.500> that

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
most progression that I've done and that
