00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:06.150
 luckily it does not take much longer and 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.379
 we have the first galaxy s 6 rumors 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.000
 and is on the table 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:10.710
 but we could join us now 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.240
 deal with proper concepts because 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.130
 sometimes the manufacturers have one 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.920
 eye for something and pick so 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.840
 some very interesting things from it 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.550
 this designer of apple conspiracy was 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.529
 you could actually say that 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.820
 forget it five directly and at the galaxy 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.500
 s 6 continue 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.689
 Let us take the boring part 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.330
 skip right that's how it reads 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.189
 also a flexible 4.5 inch amoled 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.170
 display with 2k resolution 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.420
 high quality plastic bolivar the 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.340
 housing with haiders dynamo coating 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.649
 next gen battery of a week at 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.180
 intensive use should keep a new one 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.270
 operating system that's called android 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:48.059
 6.0 with gravity unix and an 18th 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.860
 megapixel camera with 4k video recordings 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.180
 this sounds more like wishful thinking 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.829
 than anything else 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.230
 where you can say that that 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.829
 flexible display and an 18 megapixel 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.870
 camera would be quite feasible 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:02.910
 the designer has germain smit with that 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.100
 Realistic concept presented and 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.110
 really offers several more directly 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.020
 really good approaches for the big ones 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.119
 it-companies aluminum housing three 1000 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.100
 milliampere battery a small solar module 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:17.040
 on the front speakers at the front 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:20.100
 upper and lower front 1 52 inches 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.890
 2k display 4 GB of RAM and 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:26.520
 of course, a 64 bit processor 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.229
 snapdragon 820 with 2 9 ghz per core 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.150
 I do not think it is beneficial 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.759
 put smartphones directly into the sun 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:35.350
 I think the general solar concept 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.150
 but extremely exciting 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.040
 Of course we also have to 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:40.659
 a little rubbish with this 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.700
 designer has a smartphone after his 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:44.890
 imagination creates it while it's more likely 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.570
 his wish for development is his 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.729
 It's going to be six easy 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:50.920
 Bent comes in a nearly rimless 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:52.420
 display therefore the most up to date android 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.580
 or own part are software 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.380
 an aluminum housing and of course 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:58.539
 five go to four gigabytes of ram 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:01.000
 fingerprint sensor and a 4000 or 

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:01.659
 5000 milliampere so somewhere 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
 between 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:05.979
 yes, technically, I think that's more likely 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.140
 unlikely especially and sharp straight 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:09.910
 only with the ex cristal showed how 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:13.030
 far you go at a broom at all 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:15.010
 the part he looks like a 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.600
 At least I find this toy 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.360
 not exactly appealing 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:21.940
 the galaxy s 6 fancy like me now 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.680
 baptism was created by daniel co and 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:26.560
 is more in the square direction 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:30.489
 a rather unlikely 55 inch ips 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:33.730
 lcd display with 2k and a 64 bit of 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:38.230
 core processor with a330 gpu rounds 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:40.380
 this fancy part from the thing sees 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:43.870
 Actually more like a note 4 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:46.720
 pre-fight snapdragon 810 4 gb ram five 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:48.970
 points 3 inch display 3500 milliamps 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:52.840
 Battery 32 GB internal memory and 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:54.340
 external 256 just just about 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.440
 smaller main button a narrower 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.000
 Bessel and a curved screen on the edge 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:01.030
 stereo speakers on the back 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.410
 newer better than nothing overall 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.010
 I from the concept but not so 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:06.250
 done 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:09.340
 kamal, on the other hand, is super with us 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.570
 his pastel-colored things should be 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.200
 Get a closer look at the guys from samsung 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:13.200
 look at 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.489
 a housing made of brushed aluminum 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.230
 waterproof dustproof yes even live 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:19.630
 proof should be the thing , so to speak 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:21.850
 indestructible additionally equipped the 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:23.859
 designer bob tracking this galaxy s 6 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:27.100
 with an anti overheating sting no logi 

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:30.549
 a 2 km oled display 128 or 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:32.140
 optionally 256 gb internal memory two 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:35.200
 speakers on the front and 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:37.480
 a better fingerprint sensor for 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:40.329
 Finally we have the heart rate monitor 21 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:43.840
 5 megapixel camera with big and c mos 

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:45.670
 sensor and a 3500 milliampere battery 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:49.450
 Recipes may even be exaggerated 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:51.310
 but the values ​​are the usdancin 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:54.819
 have packed something are already something 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:57.910
 extremely 6 inch display 128 gb internal 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:59.739
 memory 6 GB RAM 1 33 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:02.349
 megapixel main and 8 megapixels 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:04.120
 front camera and of course a 4,000 

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:05.860
 milliampere battery could be too 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.920
 smooth as a calculator and maybe as 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:09.940
 serve spiegelreflexkamera replacement 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:13.000
 Maybe it will eventually become someday 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:14.830
 so far what he looks like coming out 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.799
 a chewing gum machine was pulled 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:19.989
 Developed by maggie design 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:22.210
 high gloss paint 1 16 core processor 1 4 k 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:24.669
 display and of course a 21 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:25.060
 megapixel camera taking 3d pictures 

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:26.740
 can 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.870
 Well and you could also do that 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:32.229
 it can also be used directly as a mirror 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:34.120
 otherwise something samsung like 

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:36.010
 you think I have against it 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.990
 interesting concept we see here 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:40.240
 Almost no besselmann stops, so to speak 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:42.370
 only one display in hand joined 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:45.280
 Go directly to the noble mini-version 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:47.590
 64 bit of core processor maybe one 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:50.229
 own iron variant 1 weko hd 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:52.960
 Display a battery between 4000 and 5000 

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:55.389
 billion hours, 32 or 64 gigabytes 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.740
 memory and an optimized variant 

00:04:55.389 --> 00:04:58.810
 of the fingerprint scanner 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:01.030
 there should still be a revised 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:02.289
 But variant of touchwiz come that 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:03.650
 is somehow hours 

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:05.600
 Of course 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:07.460
 so that you are interesting here 

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:08.360
 Concepts love the galaxy s 6 so far 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:10.639
 could find 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:13.070
 Some have to be honest 

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:14.810
 but also concepts of galaxy s 5 

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:16.130
 been and the designers have easy 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:17.810
 only the galaxy s 6 made of it 

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:19.729
 nevertheless always interesting too 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:21.020
 see in which direction that leads 

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:23.360
 and just this thing with the 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:24.860
 solar panel I think great write 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:26.090
 but once your favorites and in the 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:27.770
 comments here you still have ours 

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:30.340
 last three videos and there you can
