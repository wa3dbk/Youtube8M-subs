in<00:00:00.210> this<00:00:00.719> video<00:00:00.960> we're<00:00:01.290> going<00:00:01.380> to<00:00:01.439> show<00:00:01.709> how<00:00:02.250> to

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:02.310 
in this video we're going to show how to

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.559 
in this video we're going to show how to
animate<00:00:02.669> a<00:00:03.000> ping<00:00:03.689> format<00:00:04.680> graphic<00:00:05.569> starting

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
animate a ping format graphic starting

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:09.290 
animate a ping format graphic starting

was able to display before this release
also<00:00:17.279> incidentally<00:00:18.260> gives<00:00:19.260> you<00:00:19.380> the<00:00:19.500> option

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
also incidentally gives you the option

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.880 
also incidentally gives you the option
to<00:00:19.859> show<00:00:20.369> graphs<00:00:20.730> as<00:00:21.060> images<00:00:21.689> so<00:00:22.560> that<00:00:22.590> you<00:00:22.769> can

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
to show graphs as images so that you can

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.759 
to show graphs as images so that you can
remove<00:00:23.130> the<00:00:23.369> ActiveX<00:00:23.910> dependency<00:00:24.720> that<00:00:25.560> used

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
remove the ActiveX dependency that used

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.859 
remove the ActiveX dependency that used
to<00:00:25.890> exist<00:00:25.949> with<00:00:26.400> graphing<00:00:26.880> that's<00:00:27.480> not<00:00:27.720> what

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
to exist with graphing that's not what

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.419 
to exist with graphing that's not what
we'll<00:00:27.990> demo<00:00:28.260> here<00:00:28.500> but<00:00:28.740> just<00:00:28.859> mentioning<00:00:29.250> that

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
we'll demo here but just mentioning that

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.170 
we'll demo here but just mentioning that
because<00:00:29.910> that<00:00:30.660> allows<00:00:31.050> you<00:00:31.289> to<00:00:31.560> open<00:00:32.040> web<00:00:32.940> link

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
because that allows you to open web link

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.569 
because that allows you to open web link

need<00:00:59.160> that<00:00:59.399> screen<00:01:00.239> as<00:01:00.480> it<00:01:01.140> has<00:01:01.320> here<00:01:02.180> go<00:01:03.180> ahead

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
need that screen as it has here go ahead

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.969 
need that screen as it has here go ahead
and<00:01:03.600> sign<00:01:03.840> in<00:01:06.049> and<00:01:07.049> let's<00:01:07.380> take<00:01:07.590> a<00:01:07.619> look<00:01:07.890> at

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
and sign in and let's take a look at

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.240 
and sign in and let's take a look at
that<00:01:08.189> screen<00:01:08.580> not<00:01:08.790> much<00:01:09.060> to<00:01:09.270> see<00:01:09.479> initially

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:10.250 
that screen not much to see initially

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.789 
that screen not much to see initially
the<00:01:11.250> valuable<00:01:11.850> part<00:01:12.119> are<00:01:12.479> these<00:01:12.799> functions

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
the valuable part are these functions

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.350 
the valuable part are these functions
that<00:01:14.040> we've<00:01:14.189> included<00:01:14.549> on<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.150> local

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
that we've included on the local

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.649 
that we've included on the local

and<00:01:18.840> animate<00:01:19.259> we're<00:01:20.040> not<00:01:20.130> going<00:01:20.310> to<00:01:20.369> explain

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
and animate we're not going to explain

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.670 
and animate we're not going to explain
too<00:01:20.939> much<00:01:20.970> what<00:01:21.330> they<00:01:21.479> do<00:01:21.540> but<00:01:21.869> rather<00:01:22.290> how<00:01:22.619> to

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
too much what they do but rather how to

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.370 
too much what they do but rather how to
use<00:01:23.130> them<00:01:23.400> so<00:01:24.210> in<00:01:24.330> this<00:01:24.450> case<00:01:24.689> we've<00:01:24.930> created<00:01:25.170> a

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
use them so in this case we've created a

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.710 
use them so in this case we've created a
var<00:01:25.590> called<00:01:25.950> tower<00:01:26.250> anum<00:01:26.850> short<00:01:27.150> for<00:01:27.390> cooling

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
var called tower anum short for cooling

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.499 
var called tower anum short for cooling
tower<00:01:27.900> animation<00:01:28.650> and<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:29.820> page<00:01:30.030> has<00:01:30.299> gone

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
tower animation and the page has gone

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.450 
tower animation and the page has gone
ahead<00:01:30.659> and<00:01:30.810> instantiate<00:01:31.229> adore<00:01:31.799> created<00:01:32.340> an

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
ahead and instantiate adore created an

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.580 
ahead and instantiate adore created an
instance<00:01:32.700> of<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:34.079> tower<00:01:34.320> animation<00:01:35.070> object

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
instance of the tower animation object

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.770 
instance of the tower animation object
let's<00:01:37.590> create<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.220> other<00:01:38.579> parts<00:01:39.090> it<00:01:39.270> needs<00:01:39.479> to

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
let's create the other parts it needs to

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.410 
let's create the other parts it needs to
do<00:01:39.930> the<00:01:40.170> animation<00:01:40.700> so<00:01:41.700> we'll<00:01:41.880> start<00:01:42.180> by

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
do the animation so we'll start by

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.469 
do the animation so we'll start by
picking<00:01:43.790> three<00:01:44.790> underscore<00:01:45.420> one<00:01:45.720> that's<00:01:46.200> our

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479 
picking three underscore one that's our

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:50.960 
picking three underscore one that's our
base<00:01:48.680> cooling<00:01:49.680> tower<00:01:49.920> with<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.340> fan<00:01:50.700> in<00:01:50.880> a

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
base cooling tower with the fan in a

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.300 
base cooling tower with the fan in a
static<00:01:51.329> position<00:01:51.590> we'll<00:01:52.590> go<00:01:52.740> ahead<00:01:52.829> and<00:01:52.950> grab

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
static position we'll go ahead and grab

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.429 
static position we'll go ahead and grab
everything<00:01:53.820> to<00:01:54.149> the<00:01:54.240> left<00:01:54.450> of<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:55.020> numbered

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
everything to the left of the numbered

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.380 
everything to the left of the numbered
part<00:01:55.829> of<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.130> name<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:56.520> underscore<00:01:57.119> zero

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
part of the name the underscore zero

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.050 
part of the name the underscore zero
underscore<00:01:58.079> one<00:01:58.259> and<00:01:58.439> underscore<00:01:58.890> too<00:01:59.100> so<00:01:59.939> we

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
underscore one and underscore too so we

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.760 
underscore one and underscore too so we
copy<00:02:00.390> that<00:02:00.719> whole<00:02:00.930> string<00:02:01.350> because<00:02:01.619> we'll

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
copy that whole string because we'll

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.520 
copy that whole string because we'll
need<00:02:01.920> it<00:02:02.070> here<00:02:02.250> in<00:02:02.340> a<00:02:02.399> moment<00:02:03.229> move<00:02:04.229> the<00:02:04.409> image

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
need it here in a moment move the image

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.399 
need it here in a moment move the image
to<00:02:04.890> where<00:02:05.070> we<00:02:05.250> can<00:02:05.430> see<00:02:05.759> it<00:02:05.880> and<00:02:06.299> if<00:02:06.960> we<00:02:07.110> go<00:02:07.259> back

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
to where we can see it and if we go back

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:08.960 
to where we can see it and if we go back
to<00:02:07.469> our<00:02:07.680> local<00:02:08.009> functions<00:02:08.580> and<00:02:08.789> variables

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970

between<00:02:31.140> each<00:02:31.500> frame<00:02:31.970> so<00:02:32.970> that's<00:02:33.180> how<00:02:33.390> we

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
between each frame so that's how we

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.710 
between each frame so that's how we

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
would create the animation we've used

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.960 
would create the animation we've used
buttons<00:02:37.260> here<00:02:37.560> just<00:02:37.800> for<00:02:37.950> convenience<00:02:38.190> and

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
buttons here just for convenience and

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.090 
buttons here just for convenience and
what<00:02:39.360> each<00:02:39.390> button<00:02:39.900> does<00:02:40.140> is<00:02:40.380> take<00:02:40.620> that<00:02:40.770> tower

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
what each button does is take that tower

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.900 
what each button does is take that tower
animation<00:02:41.880> object<00:02:42.570> tower<00:02:42.960> annum<00:02:43.470> and<00:02:43.880> here<00:02:44.880> we

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
animation object tower annum and here we

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.300 
animation object tower annum and here we
do<00:02:45.120> a<00:02:45.150> start<00:02:45.660> it's<00:02:46.290> one<00:02:46.470> of<00:02:46.560> the<00:02:46.650> methods<00:02:46.860> on

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
do a start it's one of the methods on

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.580 
do a start it's one of the methods on
that<00:02:47.640> object<00:02:47.850> that<00:02:48.420> the<00:02:48.600> class<00:02:48.840> the<00:02:49.140> animation

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
that object that the class the animation

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.730 
that object that the class the animation
class<00:02:49.860> provides<00:02:50.510> this<00:02:51.510> does<00:02:51.780> a<00:02:51.810> stop<00:02:52.200> on<00:02:52.470> the

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:52.740 
class provides this does a stop on the

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:56.330 
class provides this does a stop on the
object<00:02:52.890> and<00:02:53.370> this<00:02:53.820> does<00:02:54.030> a<00:02:54.060> reverse<00:02:55.130> so<00:02:56.130> let's

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
object and this does a reverse so let's

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:57.830 
object and this does a reverse so let's
see<00:02:56.640> those<00:02:56.820> in<00:02:57.060> action<00:02:57.480> i'm<00:02:57.570> going<00:02:57.720> to<00:02:57.780> go

ahead and save at first just because i

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.820 
ahead and save at first just because i
always<00:02:59.490> like<00:02:59.760> to<00:02:59.910> do<00:03:00.060> that<00:03:00.209> and<00:03:00.530> we'll<00:03:01.530> start

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
always like to do that and we'll start

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:05.060 
always like to do that and we'll start
up<00:03:02.010> our<00:03:02.220> page<00:03:02.670> and<00:03:03.410> if<00:03:04.410> we<00:03:04.560> hit<00:03:04.650> the<00:03:04.800> start

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
up our page and if we hit the start

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:07.010 
up our page and if we hit the start
button<00:03:05.130> we<00:03:05.550> see<00:03:05.700> the<00:03:05.820> fan<00:03:06.030> spinning<00:03:06.450> we<00:03:06.840> hit

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.020 
button we see the fan spinning we hit

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.780 
button we see the fan spinning we hit
reverse<00:03:07.320> it<00:03:07.800> goes<00:03:08.070> the<00:03:08.280> opposite<00:03:08.610> direction

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
reverse it goes the opposite direction

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.990 
reverse it goes the opposite direction
and<00:03:09.360> we<00:03:09.450> had<00:03:09.570> stopped<00:03:09.840> it<00:03:10.200> stops<00:03:10.850> that's<00:03:11.850> the

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
and we had stopped it stops that's the

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.030 
and we had stopped it stops that's the
very<00:03:12.150> basics<00:03:12.720> let's<00:03:13.230> do<00:03:13.380> a<00:03:13.410> little<00:03:13.709> more

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
very basics let's do a little more

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.270 
very basics let's do a little more
sophisticated<00:03:14.790> now<00:03:15.120> though<00:03:15.360> and<00:03:15.980> change<00:03:16.980> the

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
sophisticated now though and change the

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.340 
sophisticated now though and change the
speed<00:03:17.550> at<00:03:17.730> which<00:03:17.760> the<00:03:18.060> fan<00:03:18.269> is<00:03:18.480> rotating<00:03:19.110> so

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
speed at which the fan is rotating so

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:23.180 
speed at which the fan is rotating so
what<00:03:19.530> we'll<00:03:19.680> use<00:03:19.980> is<00:03:20.280> a<00:03:20.390> tag<00:03:21.390> on<00:03:21.750> the<00:03:22.590> screen<00:03:22.950> to

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
what we'll use is a tag on the screen to

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:27.500 
what we'll use is a tag on the screen to
hold<00:03:23.430> the<00:03:23.640> value<00:03:24.090> of<00:03:24.360> our<00:03:25.910> rotation<00:03:26.910> or<00:03:27.120> of<00:03:27.360> our

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
hold the value of our rotation or of our

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:30.680 
hold the value of our rotation or of our
delay<00:03:27.840> rather<00:03:28.170> for<00:03:28.560> the<00:03:28.650> rotation<00:03:29.250> i<00:03:29.690> happen

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
delay rather for the rotation i happen

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:35.170 
delay rather for the rotation i happen
to<00:03:30.810> set<00:03:31.050> that<00:03:31.230> up<00:03:31.260> in<00:03:31.530> a<00:03:31.620> util<00:03:32.010> objectin<00:03:33.290> a<00:03:34.290> 05

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
to set that up in a util objectin a 05

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:39.380

important<00:03:47.280> the<00:03:47.370> sequence<00:03:47.820> here<00:03:48.060> is<00:03:48.300> we're

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
important the sequence here is we're

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:53.270 
important the sequence here is we're
first<00:03:48.840> going<00:03:48.900> to<00:03:49.050> stop<00:03:50.000> the<00:03:51.000> animation<00:03:52.280> then

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
first going to stop the animation then

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.490 
first going to stop the animation then
we're<00:03:53.400> going<00:03:53.489> to<00:03:53.550> say<00:03:53.790> the<00:03:54.000> delay<00:03:54.420> is<00:03:54.810> now<00:03:55.440> the

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
we're going to say the delay is now the

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.420 
we're going to say the delay is now the
value<00:03:55.709> of<00:03:56.370> this<00:03:56.580> tag<00:03:56.970> and<00:03:58.130> then<00:03:59.130> we're<00:03:59.340> going

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
value of this tag and then we're going

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.460 
value of this tag and then we're going
to<00:03:59.519> start<00:03:59.880> it<00:04:00.060> obviously<00:04:00.810> in<00:04:00.959> the<00:04:01.050> real<00:04:01.230> world

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
to start it obviously in the real world

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:02.600 
to start it obviously in the real world
you<00:04:01.590> might<00:04:01.800> want<00:04:02.010> to<00:04:02.070> check<00:04:02.280> that<00:04:02.340> it's

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:02.610 
you might want to check that it's

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:04.400 
you might want to check that it's
running<00:04:02.910> before<00:04:03.060> you<00:04:03.420> stop<00:04:03.720> it<00:04:03.900> and<00:04:04.050> start<00:04:04.080> it

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:04.410 
running before you stop it and start it

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:06.110 
running before you stop it and start it
again<00:04:04.530> because<00:04:05.340> you<00:04:05.459> don't<00:04:05.610> want<00:04:05.640> to<00:04:05.790> start<00:04:05.940> it

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
again because you don't want to start it

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.540 
again because you don't want to start it
when<00:04:06.209> it's<00:04:06.390> not<00:04:06.540> running<00:04:07.280> but<00:04:08.280> just<00:04:08.489> for

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:08.550 
when it's not running but just for

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:11.539 
when it's not running but just for
simplicity<00:04:08.820> we'll<00:04:09.390> go<00:04:09.510> ahead<00:04:09.600> and<00:04:09.720> do<00:04:09.900> that<00:04:10.549> so

00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:11.549 
simplicity we'll go ahead and do that so

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:13.940 
simplicity we'll go ahead and do that so
if<00:04:11.700> we<00:04:11.730> now<00:04:12.090> again<00:04:12.900> take<00:04:13.230> a<00:04:13.260> look<00:04:13.500> at<00:04:13.709> our<00:04:13.769> on

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:13.950 
if we now again take a look at our on

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:15.920 
if we now again take a look at our on
update<00:04:14.370> event<00:04:14.670> it's<00:04:14.910> going<00:04:15.060> to<00:04:15.120> stop<00:04:15.390> the<00:04:15.660> fan

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
update event it's going to stop the fan

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:20.140 
update event it's going to stop the fan
change<00:04:16.350> the<00:04:16.560> delay<00:04:16.830> and<00:04:17.100> restart<00:04:18.060> it<00:04:18.209> and

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:20.150 
change the delay and restart it and

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:22.270 
change the delay and restart it and
let's<00:04:21.150> go<00:04:21.419> ahead

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:22.280 
let's go ahead

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:28.840 
let's go ahead
and<00:04:22.690> start<00:04:23.690> this<00:04:24.250> we<00:04:25.250> can<00:04:25.430> look<00:04:25.670> in<00:04:26.000> expert<00:04:27.850> see

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:28.850 
and start this we can look in expert see

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:30.820 
and start this we can look in expert see
that<00:04:29.030> a<00:04:29.060> 05<00:04:29.720> is<00:04:29.930> a<00:04:29.960> hundred<00:04:30.440> and<00:04:30.560> we<00:04:30.680> had

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:30.830 
that a 05 is a hundred and we had

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:34.840 
that a 05 is a hundred and we had
preceded<00:04:31.610> that<00:04:31.810> and<00:04:33.010> one<00:04:34.010> side<00:04:34.340> effect<00:04:34.730> of

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:34.850 
preceded that and one side effect of

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:37.240 
preceded that and one side effect of
having<00:04:35.060> that<00:04:35.300> on<00:04:35.720> update<00:04:36.139> event<00:04:36.470> in<00:04:36.680> the<00:04:36.950> tag

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:37.250 
having that on update event in the tag

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:40.390 
having that on update event in the tag
is<00:04:37.669> it<00:04:38.540> starts<00:04:39.080> when<00:04:39.290> the<00:04:39.320> page<00:04:39.650> starts<00:04:40.010> now<00:04:40.340> we

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:40.400 
is it starts when the page starts now we

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.100 
is it starts when the page starts now we
don't<00:04:40.610> have<00:04:40.760> to<00:04:40.880> hit<00:04:41.090> the<00:04:41.210> start<00:04:41.510> button<00:04:41.570> so

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:42.110 
don't have to hit the start button so

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:44.530 
don't have to hit the start button so
something<00:04:42.410> to<00:04:42.470> be<00:04:42.560> cognizant<00:04:42.980> of<00:04:43.220> we<00:04:44.090> can<00:04:44.240> stop

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:44.540 
something to be cognizant of we can stop

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:48.250 
something to be cognizant of we can stop
it<00:04:44.780> we<00:04:45.230> can<00:04:45.410> start<00:04:45.680> it<00:04:45.860> just<00:04:46.040> like<00:04:46.190> before<00:04:47.260> and

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:48.260 
it we can start it just like before and

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:49.659 
it we can start it just like before and
we<00:04:48.380> can<00:04:48.530> reverse<00:04:48.770> it<00:04:48.980> if<00:04:49.040> we<00:04:49.220> want<00:04:49.400> to<00:04:49.520> just

00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:49.669 
we can reverse it if we want to just

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:52.090 
we can reverse it if we want to just
like<00:04:49.880> before<00:04:50.139> the<00:04:51.139> other<00:04:51.260> the<00:04:51.470> interesting

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:52.100 
like before the other the interesting

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:53.890 
like before the other the interesting
part<00:04:52.340> that's<00:04:52.520> different<00:04:53.000> now<00:04:53.030> is<00:04:53.450> we<00:04:53.720> could

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:53.900 
part that's different now is we could

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:57.450 
part that's different now is we could
write<00:04:54.139> let's<00:04:54.380> say<00:04:54.590> a<00:04:54.620> thousand<00:04:55.870> to<00:04:56.870> that<00:04:57.140> and

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:57.460 
write let's say a thousand to that and

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:01.060 
write let's say a thousand to that and
what<00:04:58.460> we'll<00:04:58.610> see<00:04:58.850> is<00:04:59.060> the<00:04:59.240> fan<00:04:59.740> clunks<00:05:00.740> along

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:01.070 
what we'll see is the fan clunks along

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:04.810 
what we'll see is the fan clunks along
very<00:05:01.760> slowly<00:05:03.160> conversely<00:05:04.160> if<00:05:04.400> we<00:05:04.580> write<00:05:04.790> a

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:04.820 
very slowly conversely if we write a

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:08.740 
very slowly conversely if we write a
value<00:05:05.240> like<00:05:05.419> 25<00:05:06.200> in<00:05:06.500> there<00:05:07.330> we<00:05:08.330> can<00:05:08.480> see<00:05:08.630> the

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:08.750 
value like 25 in there we can see the

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:12.580 
value like 25 in there we can see the
fan<00:05:08.990> going<00:05:09.260> crazy<00:05:09.820> so<00:05:10.820> quick<00:05:11.450> demo<00:05:11.840> of<00:05:11.870> how<00:05:12.530> to

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:12.590 
fan going crazy so quick demo of how to

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:16.240 
fan going crazy so quick demo of how to
set<00:05:13.160> up<00:05:13.570> the<00:05:14.570> animation<00:05:14.990> simple<00:05:15.710> animation

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:16.250 
set up the animation simple animation

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:17.920 
set up the animation simple animation
and<00:05:16.460> then<00:05:16.550> how<00:05:16.700> to<00:05:16.760> change<00:05:17.120> the<00:05:17.390> speed<00:05:17.630> of<00:05:17.810> the

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:17.930 
and then how to change the speed of the

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:20.740 
and then how to change the speed of the
animation<00:05:18.280> and<00:05:19.280> what<00:05:19.850> we<00:05:19.970> might<00:05:20.210> do<00:05:20.510> in

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:20.750 
animation and what we might do in

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:24.879 
animation and what we might do in
closing<00:05:21.760> is<00:05:22.760> perhaps<00:05:23.600> set<00:05:24.050> the<00:05:24.200> visibility<00:05:24.380> of

00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:24.889 
closing is perhaps set the visibility of

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:30.640 
closing is perhaps set the visibility of
this<00:05:26.560> tag<00:05:27.560> to<00:05:27.950> hide<00:05:28.250> and<00:05:28.880> just<00:05:29.690> use<00:05:29.930> it<00:05:30.140> you

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:30.650 
this tag to hide and just use it you

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:33.820 
this tag to hide and just use it you
know<00:05:30.740> in<00:05:30.860> an<00:05:30.979> invisible<00:05:31.550> mode<00:05:32.560> so<00:05:33.560> now<00:05:33.770> we

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:33.830 
know in an invisible mode so now we

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:36.550 
know in an invisible mode so now we
would<00:05:34.040> actually<00:05:34.370> have<00:05:34.520> to<00:05:35.229> write<00:05:36.229> the<00:05:36.410> value

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:36.560 
would actually have to write the value

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:41.020 
would actually have to write the value
from<00:05:37.430> lots<00:05:38.060> to<00:05:38.330> 150<00:05:38.960> and<00:05:39.560> what<00:05:40.520> we<00:05:40.610> should<00:05:40.820> see

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:41.030 
from lots to 150 and what we should see

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:43.180 
from lots to 150 and what we should see
as<00:05:41.150> it<00:05:41.300> slows<00:05:41.570> down<00:05:41.600> and<00:05:42.320> if<00:05:42.740> we<00:05:42.830> bring<00:05:43.039> up

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:43.190 
as it slows down and if we bring up

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:46.450 
as it slows down and if we bring up
expert<00:05:43.640> again<00:05:43.910> and<00:05:44.150> go<00:05:44.990> back<00:05:45.020> to<00:05:45.410> fast<00:05:46.160> or

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:46.460 
expert again and go back to fast or

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:49.120 
expert again and go back to fast or
value<00:05:46.789> say<00:05:46.970> 75<00:05:47.630> we<00:05:48.050> should<00:05:48.229> see<00:05:48.410> it<00:05:48.500> its<00:05:48.770> back

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:49.130 
value say 75 we should see it its back

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:53.500 
value say 75 we should see it its back
to<00:05:49.660> would<00:05:50.660> be<00:05:50.810> a<00:05:50.840> more<00:05:51.050> normal<00:05:51.320> speed<00:05:52.479> so<00:05:53.479> that

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:53.510 
to would be a more normal speed so that

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:56.770 
to would be a more normal speed so that
