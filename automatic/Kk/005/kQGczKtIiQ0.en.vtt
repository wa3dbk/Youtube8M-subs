00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:28.180
 very good to everyone and we are back 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:30.160
 here with a new video today we are going to 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:33.900
 focus a bit on the new 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:37.470
 update 229 from the beta 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:40.650
 and well I want to show you how they work 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:42.720
 the trades the new trades with the 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:45.180
 new update then first of 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:47.130
 everything if I open the trades interface it 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.860
 You can see that I have all the 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:51.570
 trades of the game is to say now all 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.470
 the characters have all the trades 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.280
 of the game 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:58.309
 that's clear to level 1 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:00.460
 in my case I am level 200 fisherman 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:04.070
 because now there are not only 100 levels 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:07.369
 but it has been increased to 200 as the 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:10.940
 levels of the players then not 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:13.190
 you need to be alarmed because 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:15.409
 you had an office at level 100 with the no 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:17.899
 update will give you the level 200 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:20.030
 of that office and what is also 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:22.460
 important are the trades that are 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:25.430
 more or less the same category as 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:28.130
 Fisherman and fishmonger are all together in 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:30.979
 fisherman a peasant who goes to join 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:34.850
 with that goes along with nothing baker 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:38.210
 hunter who goes together with butcher and 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:42.229
 Well, these collection jobs 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:43.880
 later also what is important is 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:46.159
 that have changed many recipes about 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:49.340
 all of the peasants and the 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:52.850
 alchemists and fishermen clear that now 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:54.979
 many objects are used , which obliges 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:57.770
 a for recipes to be good level of 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:02:02.270
 all collection jobs 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:05.090
 yes and another very important thing is that 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:07.159
 if for example you had before in a 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.899
 fisherman and fishmonger character level 100 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:12.410
 and in another character you had a peasant 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:14.510
 level 100 as well as the gems that you 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.760
 give to compensate the levels that already 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.099
 you have are interchangeable between 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.819
 characters of the same account then 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:23.260
 we have what 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:25.090
 you can put all in it 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.630
 character words can be put 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:30.040
 fisherman 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:32.320
 all of us if we had two 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.790
 characters with different trades then yes 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.530
 we want to put them all all 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:39.180
 trades of the characters in a single 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.180
 character, now we can do it 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:45.319
 this interface as you see is very complete 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:47.810
 and also have options to go out in 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:49.910
 the public list of artisans thing that 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:52.910
 it is very important it is as if they were the 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:54.440
 runes that were in the formerly 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:57.950
 now you do not have to have runes to 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:59.060
 leave and here you can put on yes yes it is 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.830
 Our service will offer 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:04.959
 free or not and the minimum level of 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:04.959
 object that we want to put 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:11.270
 It is also important that the trades 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:14.030
 now tools are no longer used 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:17.180
 said the fisherman no longer rods are used , 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:18.590
 can always go with the normal weapon that 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.510
 is very good because in the case of 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:22.460
 fisherman there are many places where 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:25.490
 reeds could not get there they had books 

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:27.710
 or that with a small cane you could not 

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:31.350
 get very far, now you can 

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:34.350
 find all the fish you want 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:36.180
 I think that more or less explained everything 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:37.770
 the new of the trades that we can see 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.630
 also that in each trade we can see 

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:41.250
 the recipes we can make and the 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:42.390
 resources that we can collect in the 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.870
 case of those who have resources 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:47.739
 collected 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:50.950
 collect bless forgiveness those of kraft already 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:54.060
 we see that there are only recipes and good me 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:55.890
 I think it's a very good initiative 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:59.459
 it is very good is the reform that they have 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:01.140
 done the only thing to use the resources 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:04.110
 for fisherman recipes that for example 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:06.370
 they have to do with alchemist or recipes 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:09.760
 of peasant that are needed 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:11.379
 fish, because that makes it difficult and will 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:15.489
 all the characters have to climb 

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:18.190
 to all trades let's say 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:20.320
 pickup that good will be entertaining 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:23.110
 but it may be interesting they will not change 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.580
 the prices will change everything good I hope 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:26.919
 that you liked the video 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:30.430
 it's clear the doubts are the new 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:33.270
 update from the beta that still 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:37.500
 and it is still missing for the 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:43.200
 229 for the normal game let's say but 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:44.820
 that will be like that and no thanks 

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:47.400
 video to see if there is any doubt to 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:50.910
 put it in the comments give like 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:53.940
 subscribe and if they are missing some 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:58.140
 information or something can bring the in 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:59.790
 the comments and then we will try 

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:02.070
 solve what will be missing although I think 

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:07.620
 that is quite complete 

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:09.780
 explanation about the trades 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:11.490
 in a short time soon it will rise 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:13.710
 another video expressly of the office 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:15.780
 fisherman because there are new fish that are 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:22.180
 can fish and have changed many 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:24.550
 things so soon elaborate the guide of 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:27.780
 of the new fisherman's job of the 229 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:27.780
 thank you very much
