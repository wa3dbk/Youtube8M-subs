00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:26.250 
review the next following day so you
know<00:00:24.189> people<00:00:24.880> have<00:00:25.000> to<00:00:25.119> sleep<00:00:25.390> so<00:00:25.930> let's<00:00:26.109> begin

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:26.260 
know people have to sleep so let's begin

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.170 
know people have to sleep so let's begin
with<00:00:26.439> the<00:00:26.590> reef<00:00:26.949> and<00:00:27.160> at<00:00:27.460> first<00:00:27.730> you<00:00:28.060> will

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:28.180 
with the reef and at first you will

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:29.790 
with the reef and at first you will
notice<00:00:28.420> that<00:00:28.539> we've<00:00:28.840> got<00:00:29.019> a<00:00:29.170> new<00:00:29.470> opening

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:29.800 
notice that we've got a new opening

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.589 
notice that we've got a new opening
actually<00:00:30.609> and<00:00:30.730> also<00:00:30.939> pretty<00:00:31.090> fast<00:00:31.420> because

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:31.599 
actually and also pretty fast because

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:33.540 
actually and also pretty fast because
there's<00:00:31.750> only<00:00:31.810> the<00:00:31.990> second<00:00:32.290> episode<00:00:32.550> I'm

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:33.550 
there's only the second episode I'm

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:35.340 
there's only the second episode I'm
guessing<00:00:34.420> because<00:00:34.510> remember<00:00:34.930> there<00:00:35.170> was<00:00:35.290> a

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:35.350 
guessing because remember there was a

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:37.320 
guessing because remember there was a
time<00:00:35.470> skip<00:00:36.010> actually<00:00:36.550> two<00:00:36.670> times<00:00:36.940> gives<00:00:37.210> in

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:37.330 
time skip actually two times gives in

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:40.110 
time skip actually two times gives in
first<00:00:37.360> episode<00:00:37.989> so<00:00:38.230> look<00:00:38.830> I<00:00:39.100> really<00:00:39.850> didn't

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:40.120 
first episode so look I really didn't

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:41.760 
first episode so look I really didn't
expect<00:00:40.390> this<00:00:40.570> new<00:00:40.750> opening<00:00:41.170> and<00:00:41.290> the<00:00:41.379> opening

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:41.770 
expect this new opening and the opening

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:45.540 
expect this new opening and the opening
is<00:00:41.890> pretty<00:00:42.280> dope<00:00:42.579> indeed<00:00:43.210> and<00:00:43.510> you<00:00:44.379> know<00:00:44.500> do<00:00:45.460> it

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:45.550 
is pretty dope indeed and you know do it

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.069 
is pretty dope indeed and you know do it
just<00:00:45.730> so<00:00:45.850> far<00:00:46.059> I<00:00:46.239> know<00:00:46.300> a<00:00:46.450> lot<00:00:46.629> of<00:00:46.690> people<00:00:46.780> are

over hyping it but me it does is

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:51.240 
over hyping it but me it does is
actually<00:00:49.719> a<00:00:50.079> certain<00:00:50.739> reason<00:00:50.890> why<00:00:51.100> they're

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:51.250

episode<00:03:50.069> wait<00:03:50.609> huge<00:03:51.209> difference<00:03:51.780> first<00:03:52.019> eps

00:03:52.219 --> 00:03:52.229 
episode wait huge difference first eps

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:54.229 
episode wait huge difference first eps
and<00:03:52.470> i<00:03:53.220> guess<00:03:53.340> because<00:03:53.459> of<00:03:53.699> the<00:03:53.790> time<00:03:53.970> skip

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
and i guess because of the time skip

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:56.149 
and i guess because of the time skip

because I hopefully I think stole my has
a<00:04:41.110> little<00:04:41.380> bit<00:04:41.500> more<00:04:41.910> to<00:04:42.910> it<00:04:42.940> not<00:04:43.390> just<00:04:43.630> really
