foot is free you can do any pattern you
know<00:01:54.619> the<00:01:55.619> reason<00:01:56.009> for<00:01:56.219> using<00:01:56.430> this<00:01:56.880> bridge

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
know the reason for using this bridge

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.580 
know the reason for using this bridge
ending<00:01:58.110> is<00:01:58.290> the<00:01:58.850> professional<00:01:59.850> ending<00:02:00.299> and<00:02:00.899> it

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
ending is the professional ending and it

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.249 
ending is the professional ending and it
gives<00:02:02.070> you<00:02:02.250> flow<00:02:02.700> so<00:02:03.240> if<00:02:03.360> the<00:02:03.479> music<00:02:03.840> is<00:02:03.930> slow

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
gives you flow so if the music is slow

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.490 
gives you flow so if the music is slow
and<00:02:04.439> you<00:02:04.560> have<00:02:04.799> room<00:02:05.990> you<00:02:06.990> would<00:02:07.140> want<00:02:07.380> to

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
and you have room you would want to

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.219 
and you have room you would want to
finish<00:02:07.770> your<00:02:08.099> pattern<00:02:08.610> with<00:02:09.450> this<00:02:09.599> continent

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
finish your pattern with this continent

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.370 
finish your pattern with this continent
continuity<00:02:11.160> ending<00:02:11.520> otherwise<00:02:12.300> if<00:02:12.750> the<00:02:12.900> floor

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
continuity ending otherwise if the floor

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.530 
continuity ending otherwise if the floor
a little<00:02:13.650> crowded<00:02:13.950> and<00:02:14.340> the<00:02:14.730> music<00:02:15.060> was<00:02:15.210> fast

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
a little crowded and the music was fast

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.960 
a little crowded and the music was fast
you<00:02:16.170> might<00:02:16.410> just<00:02:16.620> do<00:02:16.860> a<00:02:16.890> little<00:02:17.040> sidestep<00:02:17.610> like

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
you might just do a little sidestep like

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.110 
you might just do a little sidestep like
that<00:02:18.270> if<00:02:18.810> you<00:02:18.930> have<00:02:19.140> room<00:02:19.500> you<00:02:20.220> would<00:02:20.370> do<00:02:20.550> the

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
that if you have room you would do the

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.080 
that if you have room you would do the
bridge<00:02:21.420> for<00:02:21.810> continuity<00:02:22.850> so<00:02:23.850> now<00:02:24.030> we

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
bridge for continuity so now we

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.850 
bridge for continuity so now we
understand<00:02:24.720> a<00:02:25.110> bridge<00:02:25.850> ending
