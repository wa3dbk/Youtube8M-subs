00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:07.850
 I am someone who is orbital to them 

00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:09.830
 biorhythm 

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:11.630
 in extra left happier than anyone 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:13.190
 longer 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:15.170
 I feel it seriously I still think there 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:25.519
 some then will need to meet me 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:28.009
 to fit through early in the morning before 

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:30.409
 good for me the record hour is like that 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:33.460
 well if i come first without 

00:00:30.409 --> 00:00:33.460
 percent of the roses 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:40.930
 as a person it is what it is 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:43.059
 natural hassle that comes with it 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:45.399
 See all the material it can 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:46.360
 cherries with us that need beer 

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:48.990
 to crack 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:51.450
 it is a precious intention 

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:53.010
 as riders we have there in principle 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:54.930
 not much outside in total 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.330
 our bikes and trail so and I see 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.830
 so i would do the little bitch thing too 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:02.510
 it's just that way i just got it 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:02.510
 to get rid of my lab like this 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.300
 I also do my own passion two 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:15.600
 maybe boarding school of course 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.760
 like many for the win too 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.240
 ironing course especially with condition 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:21.840
 and season that there may be reasons there 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.910
 a lot of 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.830
 i said i have a nice back can too 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:26.910
 you already in those beautiful three colors 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.950
 cycling around 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:31.200
 and that gives enormous satisfaction in 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.360
 my peace of mind 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.860
 what does that mean i really have it 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.050
 I am not the Belgian champion 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:40.410
 throw champions then teach back true 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:42.869
 if i could choose i would definitely have the 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:44.640
 many champions training let's be beautiful 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.840
 if I must first of course also 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:51.149
 example I hear hope that kimball will 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:54.420
 in good time of course and I think 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.979
 that he missed my side makes it real 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:00.390
 fast is a swatch of rewards 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:02.670
 you first and foremost the Belgians I think 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.899
 to relieve even an I like 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.700
 I do eunuch 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:10.819
 knife albert just certainly the bowl 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:14.480
 do me the original 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:17.930
 mine may be the market of 50 that 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:20.180
 really is the growth and not the boat 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.769
 you can still do this if I have a good one 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.380
 communicates when i have a good day i 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:26.360
 can kilogram which means not but if 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:30.880
 I can choose in me anyway 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:33.530
 rather the black no we just live 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.000
 fifth like a belgian life ours 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.069
 feeding with another person around 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.930
 and that will not change 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:41.410
 Because we have two big bus here in America 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.410
 tram maybe
