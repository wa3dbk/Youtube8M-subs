 have interviewed 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:58.309
 from person disorders because I do not 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:01.010
 I believe everything can be cured with our

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:39.980
 doctor 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.470

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:14.590
 our latest conversations about 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:19.180

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:50.330
 private notes of the doctor and or 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.069
