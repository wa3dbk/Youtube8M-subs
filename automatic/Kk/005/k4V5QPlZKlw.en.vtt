00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:56.930
 you have to cynthia you slip it and the 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:00.079
 farm wali and already so they accept it 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:03.380

 not that you will get this in fact 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:17.060
 and so you're going to have to go in 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:18.979
 register to play sectioning pseudo 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.330
 so you score anything here 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:22.610
 I did not do it because I 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:25.780
 already a nickname so here then you 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:28.100
 mark it here 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:30.110
 here we are 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.040
 then you do not do what I 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.409
 am doing it's just that 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.880
 I'm doing what you're doing 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:37.100
 make 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.090
 so that's good and actually when 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.360
 you 're going to click you're going to have 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.320
 package download and here you are 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:47.380
 are going to have that so do not worry 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:49.110
 not quite normal so you have that 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.450
 so 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.030
 it will continue continue I continue 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.130
 not going to make an ellipse for three 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.380
 lost seconds 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.310
 so here is so after maybe I have a 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.470
 mistake because it's been a long time since 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.120
 I downloaded but if there was not 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:04.560
 just that to do you go I 'll you 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:07.369
 register on the website 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.210
 it's talking about everything you put a 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:12.960
 but I believe that normally you have 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:14.340
 need you fall on its common cra 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.690
 you will see this good quality so 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.780
 I'm already all represented in this 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.170

 it's perfectly normal so it's not 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:07.530
 a trick where you can not play I'm going 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:10.650

 broken from the ground you can cut out 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:18.000
 of the arts or to cut the mushrooms 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:19.889
 you can cut trees finally 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:27.620
 this is finally the basic school of 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:31.620
 minecraft skincase enough to have this 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:34.080
 to have this expected it is at 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:35.240
 instead of having the normal skin you by 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:42.180
 example me I am kakashi of naruto 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:43.680
 emma you have that here we are so here we go 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.729
 change password and you want 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.960
 change your password simply 

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:47.550
 that they explain to me it's a trick to 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:48.990
 talk but I do not know how it's 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:50.130
 but that player you know you see 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.990
 very well that no one can I go on 

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:53.490
 a server like that so it's a 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:53.970
 server that I was given I have any case 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:57.630
 it's in 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:05:00.050
 and apparently they repaired it to me 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:00.050
 break 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:06.479
 ah I'm all dead 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:17.639
