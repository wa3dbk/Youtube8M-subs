00:00:49.410 --> 00:02:28.110 

Oh

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.760 

first<00:02:29.120> of<00:02:29.270> all<00:02:29.330> I<00:02:29.390> thought<00:02:30.230> the<00:02:30.349> offense

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:30.770 
first of all I thought the offense

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:34.809 
first of all I thought the offense
really<00:02:31.400> performed<00:02:31.880> well<00:02:31.970> very<00:02:32.840> crisp<00:02:33.819> you

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:34.819 
really performed well very crisp you

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:36.850 
really performed well very crisp you
know<00:02:34.940> I<00:02:34.970> don't<00:02:35.780> think<00:02:36.110> we<00:02:36.230> had<00:02:36.410> a<00:02:36.440> single

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
know I don't think we had a single

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:41.260 
know I don't think we had a single
penalty<00:02:37.300> with<00:02:38.300> our<00:02:38.480> first<00:02:39.050> two<00:02:39.260> groups<00:02:39.620> and<00:02:40.270> so

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:41.270 
penalty with our first two groups and so

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:42.309 
penalty with our first two groups and so
that<00:02:41.390> was<00:02:41.480> really<00:02:41.540> good<00:02:41.840> to<00:02:41.959> see<00:02:42.019> probably

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:42.319 
that was really good to see probably

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:43.600 
that was really good to see probably
most<00:02:42.560> disappointing<00:02:42.950> things<00:02:43.069> we<00:02:43.220> had<00:02:43.370> it<00:02:43.489> we

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
most disappointing things we had it we

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
most disappointing things we had it we
had<00:02:43.700> a<00:02:43.730> couple<00:02:43.940> Center<00:02:44.239> quarterback

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630 
had a couple Center quarterback

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.979 
had a couple Center quarterback
exchanges<00:02:45.290> and<00:02:46.120> we<00:02:47.120> got<00:02:47.569> stopped<00:02:47.810> on<00:02:47.930> a

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:47.989 
exchanges and we got stopped on a

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:49.420 
exchanges and we got stopped on a
fourth-and-inches<00:02:48.500> one<00:02:48.860> time<00:02:49.100> but<00:02:49.250> under

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
fourth-and-inches one time but under

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.300 
fourth-and-inches one time but under
than<00:02:49.550> that<00:02:49.670> they<00:02:49.880> really<00:02:50.510> had<00:02:51.380> had<00:02:51.860> a<00:02:51.890> really

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
than that they really had had a really

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.390 
than that they really had had a really
good<00:02:52.610> day<00:02:52.900> throwing<00:02:53.900> catching<00:02:54.290> running<00:02:54.769> guys

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
good day throwing catching running guys

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.370 
good day throwing catching running guys
up<00:02:55.640> front<00:02:55.940> at<00:02:56.330> the<00:02:56.510> point<00:02:56.720> of<00:02:56.780> attack<00:02:56.870> I

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
up front at the point of attack I

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:59.590 
up front at the point of attack I
thought<00:02:57.860> it<00:02:57.950> was<00:02:58.040> a<00:02:58.069> very<00:02:58.459> good<00:02:59.420> performance

00:02:59.590 --> 00:02:59.600 
thought it was a very good performance

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.460 
thought it was a very good performance
offensively<00:03:00.500> defensively<00:03:01.810> and<00:03:02.810> we<00:03:03.140> were<00:03:03.290> down

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
offensively defensively and we were down

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:06.340 
offensively defensively and we were down
a<00:03:03.500> couple<00:03:03.769> guys<00:03:04.010> today<00:03:04.630> and<00:03:05.630> that<00:03:05.780> showed<00:03:06.049> but

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:06.350 
a couple guys today and that showed but

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:11.770 
a couple guys today and that showed but
but<00:03:06.890> I<00:03:06.920> thought<00:03:08.500> we<00:03:09.500> had<00:03:10.220> some<00:03:10.459> bus<00:03:10.700> and<00:03:11.060> now

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 
but I thought we had some bus and now

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:13.150 
but I thought we had some bus and now
that<00:03:11.959> was<00:03:12.049> disappointing<00:03:12.260> to<00:03:12.650> see<00:03:12.799> had<00:03:12.980> some

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.160 
that was disappointing to see had some

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:14.740 
that was disappointing to see had some
real<00:03:13.489> big<00:03:13.700> bus<00:03:13.910> and<00:03:14.090> that's<00:03:14.209> what<00:03:14.360> happens<00:03:14.660> on

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
real big bus and that's what happens on

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:16.330 
real big bus and that's what happens on
defense<00:03:15.140> you<00:03:15.260> give<00:03:15.410> up<00:03:15.530> big<00:03:15.680> plays<00:03:15.739> when<00:03:15.980> you

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
defense you give up big plays when you

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.430 
defense you give up big plays when you
missed<00:03:16.549> tackles<00:03:16.970> you<00:03:17.480> bust<00:03:17.750> assignments<00:03:18.319> and

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 
missed tackles you bust assignments and

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:19.720 
missed tackles you bust assignments and
turn<00:03:18.560> guys<00:03:18.799> loose<00:03:19.130> when<00:03:19.340> you're<00:03:19.459> playing<00:03:19.610> a

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730
