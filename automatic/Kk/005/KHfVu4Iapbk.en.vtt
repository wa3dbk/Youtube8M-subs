00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
right so here's the 2000 watt generator

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.490 
right so here's the 2000 watt generator
on<00:00:54.390> it<00:00:55.940> and<00:00:56.940> let's<00:00:57.329> see<00:00:57.539> if<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:57.840> new<00:00:58.050> starter

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
cap makes a difference and now for the

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.359 
cap makes a difference and now for the
moment<00:01:04.409> of<00:01:04.710> truth

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
moment of truth

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:10.070 
moment of truth
let's<00:01:05.790> see<00:01:06.210> if<00:01:07.369> this<00:01:08.369> thing's<00:01:08.700> gonna<00:01:08.850> run<00:01:09.080> or

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
let's see if this thing's gonna run or

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:28.240 
let's see if this thing's gonna run or
shut<00:01:10.950> down<00:01:11.189> like<00:01:11.369> it<00:01:11.549> did<00:01:11.700> before<00:01:22.400> that's<00:01:23.400> fair

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:54.210 

it's<00:01:29.250> also<00:01:29.400> fan<00:01:30.500> that's<00:01:31.500> -<00:01:33.350> slow<00:01:35.150> dum-dum-dum

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:54.220 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:02:00.190 

Wow<00:01:55.220> I<00:01:56.770> think<00:01:57.770> I<00:01:57.890> actually<00:01:58.070> did<00:01:58.370> it<00:01:58.870> so<00:01:59.870> it's

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
Wow I think I actually did it so it's

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:10.050 
Wow I think I actually did it so it's
running<00:02:00.710> a<00:02:01.040> oh<00:02:03.910> that<00:02:04.910> was<00:02:05.090> so<00:02:05.390> close<00:02:05.720> maybe<00:02:06.110> not

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.500 

but<00:02:11.060> let's<00:02:11.330> try<00:02:12.170> it<00:02:12.350> again<00:02:12.560> but<00:02:13.100> looks<00:02:13.580> like<00:02:13.880> it

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
but let's try it again but looks like it

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.850 
but let's try it again but looks like it
didn't<00:02:15.470> quite<00:02:16.250> make<00:02:16.790> it
