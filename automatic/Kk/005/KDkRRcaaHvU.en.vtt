00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:18.130
 see here this is the hole that the 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:21.520
 avengers is the exclusive series of 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:25.239
 walmart the one who repeated the mold with 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:28.329
 the series of new green goblin and this is 

00:00:25.239 --> 00:00:30.160
 the hulk figure from the series of tanos 

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:33.240
 that practically just came out in 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:37.980
 mexico we are in the month 

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:40.650
 March 2015 kind of this figure 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.240
 you see here I already have a review 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:44.490
 made from the first reviews for 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.230
 look for it and there's the review of 

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:49.110
 the figure of the video that I want 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:52.190
 teach them in this comparative is that 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.190
 well this one hulk 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:57.809
 it is not the same mold 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:57.809
 it's definitely not the same mold that 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:02.060
 that the one of the movie the avengers 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.540
 if it is important that they see it because 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.310
 Many people say nothing because I'm not going to 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:12.420
 buy the same because it is the same mold 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:15.720
 do not see or the face is the same let me 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:18.149
 see if we can do that you can see the 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.229
 comparative see the face has nothing 

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:21.299
 what to see with each other 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.030
 not even the skin tone this is 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:27.180
 Greener than this on the face is 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.710
 different this hall has then in its 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.189
 hair green shades this is totally 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:34.679
 Black grimace or the gesture of the face is 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:37.170
 very different this looks more like that of 

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:39.720
 the movie the two the two figures for 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.179
 they are very good but I like it 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.330
 slightly more the new one of the movie 

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:47.620
 of 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:49.630
 of the beta series we torso like 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:51.850
 can see the chest see it and our 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.970
 it did not even follow sculpted or 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:57.520
 even the abdomen is the same, see me 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:02:01.930
 in the abdomen the sculpted is not equal 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:04.270
 the only thing that these figures have equal 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:05.730
 it's the arms that are the same 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.340
 arms 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:10.640
 okay 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:13.360
 and even the hold figure of the new 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:17.629
 game is one centimeter higher previous 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:20.349
 it's a little bigger by a centimeter 

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:20.349
 this figure measures 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:33.849
 look here are 15 16 17 18 19 20 

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:41.060
 centimeters and this figure of hulk measured 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:45.610
 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 centimeters medium 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.610
 centimeter more then it's bigger 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.760
 Your feet are also the same, yes 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:58.150
 let's see all the others not the 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:01.900
 sculpted from the thighs at the hip is 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:04.269
 totally different look for the the 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:06.909
 back the sculpted here is seen in bags 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:09.849
 as if they were jeans and here you can see 

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:12.280
 which is a suit made for the hall 

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:14.260
 that when the doctor becomes banner 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.480
 Well, have normal trousers and when 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:19.989
 it becomes games the styrene does not 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:24.549
 pass nothing not then this hold bm this 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:26.950
 hold here has a strip that is the 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:29.739
 avengers the avengers uniform and 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:33.159
 Well, here it is, well, they can 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:34.690
 see also the back is different 

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:36.879
 also the sculpted see this is a 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:38.079
 little more in a core ford this game this 

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:41.200
 hall and you can put a little more 

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:42.940
 straight from the back and good to see is 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.549
 different the sculpted as you can see 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:48.400
 the good because they saw that it is not the 

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:50.139
 same figure and now obviously the hand 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.150
 of this hall as a take has it but 

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:55.480
 open and the new hall has both 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:57.609
 hands with fists well let's do the 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.520
 revision of the figure since we are in 

00:03:57.609 --> 00:04:04.670
 these 

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:06.080
 good the torso does not seem that it does not rotate 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:08.300
 would force him is not going to be that 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:11.120
 Break not turn but you can move 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:12.440
 see quite well the tournament does not have 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.470
 why turn because one can not turn 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:16.760
 his torso not his head if of the 160 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:19.600
 degrees you can do a little bit towards 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:25.010
 down and up 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:27.140
 look at two sides of the arm I want 160 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:29.420
 degrees the shoulder forgiveness can be done 

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:31.250
 up here up on 360 tour 

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:36.380
 degrees has double point of articulation 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:38.090
 in the elbow on your wrist you can turn and the 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:41.150
 arm in the fist can be made towards 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:44.270
 sides the hand in this joint is not 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:47.060
 your waist does not move you can open it if 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:49.850
 one is placed well in the joint it 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:52.160
 can see legs on her thigh turn 

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:54.020
 the 360 ​​degrees 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:56.990
 has a double point of articulation in the 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:59.330
 knee his calrow enology but his 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:01.670
 foot can be made down towards 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:03.500
 up and to the sides, it is a 

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:05.990
 figure although a little limited the 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:08.900
 I repeat articulation I like me 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:11.930
 he liked it very much I feel he has very very very 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:14.210
 well done the image of the movie 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:16.850
 even better than his first first 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:18.230
 version and well then that is the 

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:20.360
 comparative that I wanted to teach them 

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:22.160
 right now are the two figures and 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:24.230
 there is this confusion in this same mold 

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:27.020
 here you can see that it is not the same mold 

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:28.910
 Well, I send you as always 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:31.750
 best of the vibes and have very 

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:31.750
 happy collections
