if you've heard it you probably tried it

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.870 
if you've heard it you probably tried it
out<00:00:28.230> before<00:00:28.470> but<00:00:29.369> it's<00:00:29.519> a<00:00:29.640> really<00:00:29.789> interesting

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
those really nice smooth parts of the

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:36.979 
those really nice smooth parts of the
song<00:00:35.579> that<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:36.059> beat<00:00:36.210> starts<00:00:36.480> out<00:00:36.690> with<00:00:36.809> base

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989

then the shuffle pattern just like that
the<00:01:02.129> snare<00:01:02.460> hi-hat<00:01:02.640> snare<00:01:02.969> bass<00:01:04.909> like<00:01:05.909> I<00:01:06.000> said

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
the snare hi-hat snare bass like I said

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.670 
the snare hi-hat snare bass like I said
before<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.540> best<00:01:06.689> way<00:01:06.810> to<00:01:06.869> practice<00:01:07.080> this<00:01:07.439> is

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
before the best way to practice this is

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.050 
before the best way to practice this is
in<00:01:07.830> segments<00:01:08.340> it's<00:01:08.430> in<00:01:08.580> kind<00:01:08.760> of<00:01:08.850> like<00:01:09.030> a

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
in segments it's in kind of like a

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.600 
in segments it's in kind of like a
two-part<00:01:09.479> segment<00:01:09.930> so<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:11.400> very<00:01:11.580> first

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
two-part segment so the very first

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.940 
two-part segment so the very first
segment<00:01:11.970> is<00:01:12.330> what<00:01:12.479> I<00:01:12.510> just<00:01:12.720> showed<00:01:12.780> you<00:01:12.960> the

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
segment is what I just showed you the

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.620 
segment is what I just showed you the
strike<00:01:14.400> with<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.640> hi-hat<00:01:15.000> in<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.150> base<00:01:15.299> and

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
strike with the hi-hat in the base and

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.090 
strike with the hi-hat in the base and
then<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:15.900> shuffle<00:01:16.229> pattern<00:01:16.380> back<00:01:16.860> to<00:01:17.009> the

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
then the shuffle pattern back to the

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.539 
then the shuffle pattern back to the
base<00:01:17.220> again<00:01:17.549> like<00:01:17.759> this<00:01:19.100> alright<00:01:20.100> so<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:20.369> part

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
base again like this alright so the part

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.190 
base again like this alright so the part
right<00:01:20.729> after<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.270> shuffle<00:01:21.689> pattern<00:01:21.869> that<00:01:22.110> I

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
right after the shuffle pattern that I

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.890 
right after the shuffle pattern that I
just<00:01:22.350> showed<00:01:22.439> you<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:23.390> the<00:01:24.390> beats<00:01:24.600> going<00:01:24.810> to

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
just showed you the the beats going to

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.960 
just showed you the the beats going to
groove<00:01:25.080> right<00:01:25.409> on<00:01:25.619> into<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:26.280> accent<00:01:26.759> of<00:01:26.850> the

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
groove right on into the accent of the

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.240 
groove right on into the accent of the
beat<00:01:27.150> and<00:01:27.299> it's<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.630> snare<00:01:27.930> via<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.009> snare

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
beat and it's the snare via the snare

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.390 
beat and it's the snare via the snare
and<00:01:29.430> hi-hat<00:01:29.520> together<00:01:30.090> like<00:01:30.329> this<00:01:30.680> so<00:01:31.680> here's

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
and hi-hat together like this so here's

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.030 
and hi-hat together like this so here's
the<00:01:32.640> next<00:01:32.880> step<00:01:33.450> of<00:01:33.720> getting<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:34.470> groove<00:01:34.740> and

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
the next step of getting the groove and

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.770 
the next step of getting the groove and
you<00:01:35.610> can<00:01:35.700> practice<00:01:35.820> as<00:01:36.150> over<00:01:36.390> and<00:01:36.479> over<00:01:36.540> games

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
you can practice as over and over games

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:37.789 
you can practice as over and over games
this<00:01:36.990> is<00:01:37.049> where<00:01:37.229> it<00:01:37.290> starts<00:01:37.560> to<00:01:37.590> get<00:01:37.710> a<00:01:37.770> little

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
this is where it starts to get a little

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.569 
this is where it starts to get a little
difficult<00:01:38.369> with<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.610> swing<00:01:38.850> and<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.150> groove

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:40.579 
difficult with the swing and the groove

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:42.560 
difficult with the swing and the groove
so<00:01:41.579> you<00:01:41.610> can<00:01:41.790> kind<00:01:42.000> of<00:01:42.060> hear<00:01:42.180> how<00:01:42.390> it's

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
so you can kind of hear how it's
