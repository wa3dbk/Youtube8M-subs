00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.400
 Hello folks, the gluten-free delights we 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:07.400
 Let's do it today, it's a cheese loaf. 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:17.060
 this cheese bread recipe is a 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:20.029
 old recipe put one of use all 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:22.520
 the ingredients of their quantities already 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:24.740
 are separated to perform the 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:27.140
 cheese bread recipe that is the best 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:29.960
 Cheese bread I've eaten is worth it 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:33.410
 you also take the first step towards 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:35.570
 the revenue is to grind or 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:38.800
 grate the cheese 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:41.840
 I used here 400 grams of cheese 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:45.500
 mozzarella and 100 grams of cheese 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.340
 provolone to give that little salt in the 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.840
 recipe 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:52.219
 we will add to the cheese 50 grams of 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.879
 margarine 

00:00:52.219 --> 00:01:02.030
 soon we'll put two eggs 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:03.109
 whole 15 grams of salt 250 ml of 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.470
 milk 

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:10.130
 Let's put in 150 grams of sprinkles 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:13.550
 sour mix and let life 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:17.240

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:19.939

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:30.170
 Gluten-free delights

 If you have any questions at the time of 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:35.570
 revenue realization 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:39.799
 write in the comments generally I 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:42.680
 I make two pastas and I freeze the 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:45.680
 and I'm taking it out as I go 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:49.159
 needing you can keep the breads from 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:52.280
 cheese frozen for up to three months 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:55.280
 Let's mix the dough with your hands until 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:57.530
 that she let go of her hands and that she 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.950
 a homogeneous mixture 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:03.770
 the mass is already ready observe study 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:06.649
 it does not stick in the hands and you do not 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:09.460
 can perceive the difference where 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:12.350
 is the cheese or other ingredient 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:15.060
 notice that it no longer sticks to your hand 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:17.640
 now let's roll the dough 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.360
 making the polka dots the size you 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.640
 Wish 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.819
 it can be made the bread size of 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:27.480
 cheese or cocktail you decide the 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:28.260
 mass is one kilo and 600 kilograms 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.690
 grams 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.730
 a tip to roll up all the rolls 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:35.190
 of the same size 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:39.150
 especially if you will do to 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:41.970
 sell is to use a scoop of ice cream 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:45.330
 the cheese rolls can be baked 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:48.299
 soon after being done with the 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:52.049
 experience have know that after 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:55.350
 frozen for approximately three hours 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:59.269
 the result is better baked 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:03.269
 preheated to 220 degrees by 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:06.269
 approximately 25 minutes left 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:09.780
 ready our cheese loaves 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:12.599
 were roasted after being rolled and 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.880
 is a more chatinhos little if you 

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:17.940
