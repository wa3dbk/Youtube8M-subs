00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:40.580 
newest snapshots so it is kind of laggy

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:42.820 
newest snapshots so it is kind of laggy
this<00:00:41.089> one<00:00:41.269> thing<00:00:41.479> that<00:00:41.659> I<00:00:41.690> noticed<00:00:42.110> but

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:42.830 
this one thing that I noticed but

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:45.340 
this one thing that I noticed but
anyways<00:00:43.220> onto<00:00:43.460> why<00:00:44.330> it<00:00:44.390> works<00:00:44.690> so<00:00:44.930> basically

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:45.350 
anyways onto why it works so basically

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.869 
anyways onto why it works so basically
as<00:00:45.470> you<00:00:45.619> can<00:00:45.650> hear<00:00:46.040> you<00:00:46.309> can<00:00:46.460> you<00:00:47.360> hear<00:00:48.729> potions

00:00:49.869 --> 00:00:49.879 
as you can hear you can you hear potions

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:52.270 
as you can hear you can you hear potions
splashing<00:00:50.690> now<00:00:51.260> these<00:00:51.470> are<00:00:51.589> instant<00:00:52.040> damage

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:52.280 
splashing now these are instant damage

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.250 
splashing now these are instant damage
potions<00:00:52.939> so<00:00:53.089> these<00:00:53.420> will<00:00:53.600> not<00:00:53.809> work<00:00:54.049> on

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:54.260 
potions so these will not work on

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.539 
potions so these will not work on
zombies<00:00:54.860> and<00:00:55.159> skeletons

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:57.549 

00:00:57.549 --> 00:01:00.759 

but<00:00:58.549> it<00:00:58.790> still<00:00:59.180> is<00:00:59.390> really<00:00:59.570> fun<00:00:59.930> to<00:01:00.049> use<00:01:00.080> and<00:01:00.559> it

00:01:00.759 --> 00:01:00.769 
but it still is really fun to use and it

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:02.410 
but it still is really fun to use and it
works<00:01:00.979> they<00:01:01.189> even<00:01:01.519> work<00:01:01.699> since<00:01:01.909> arrival

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:02.420 
works they even work since arrival
