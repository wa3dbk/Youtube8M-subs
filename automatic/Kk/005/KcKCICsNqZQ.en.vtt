00:00:37.619 --> 00:00:37.629 
screen like this you can't make one from

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:41.700 
screen like this you can't make one from
a<00:00:37.690> nylon<00:00:37.899> stocking<00:00:38.379> and<00:00:38.859> some<00:00:39.160> wire<00:00:40.500> if<00:00:41.500> you

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:41.710 
a nylon stocking and some wire if you

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.209 
a nylon stocking and some wire if you

00:00:45.209 --> 00:00:45.219 
don't have a pop screen filter then what

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:46.799 
don't have a pop screen filter then what
you<00:00:45.309> want<00:00:45.489> to<00:00:45.550> try<00:00:45.699> to<00:00:45.760> do<00:00:46.000> is<00:00:46.300> point<00:00:46.660> the

00:00:46.799 --> 00:00:46.809 
you want to try to do is point the

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:49.560 
you want to try to do is point the
microphone<00:00:47.410> at<00:00:47.679> your<00:00:47.949> chin<00:00:48.280> and<00:00:48.550> speak<00:00:49.179> over

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:49.570 
microphone at your chin and speak over

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:51.329 
microphone at your chin and speak over
the<00:00:49.690> top<00:00:49.899> of<00:00:50.109> the<00:00:50.170> microphone<00:00:50.469> that<00:00:51.249> will

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:51.339 
the top of the microphone that will

00:00:51.339 --> 00:00:54.239 
the top of the microphone that will
hopefully<00:00:51.579> make<00:00:51.999> the<00:00:52.210> peas<00:00:52.660> pop<00:00:53.109> this<00:00:53.679> way<00:00:53.920> and

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:54.249 
hopefully make the peas pop this way and

00:00:54.249 --> 00:00:58.799 
hopefully make the peas pop this way and
not<00:00:54.460> into<00:00:54.850> the<00:00:54.909> microphone<00:00:55.449> I<00:00:57.179> also<00:00:58.179> recommend

00:00:58.799 --> 00:00:58.809 
not into the microphone I also recommend

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:00.660 
not into the microphone I also recommend
that<00:00:59.050> you<00:00:59.230> try<00:00:59.499> to<00:00:59.530> find<00:00:59.649> a<00:01:00.010> quiet<00:01:00.249> place<00:01:00.429> to

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:00.670 
that you try to find a quiet place to

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.779 
that you try to find a quiet place to
record<00:01:01.269> or<00:01:02.230> help<00:01:02.559> your<00:01:02.739> place<00:01:03.010> become<00:01:03.519> more

00:01:03.779 --> 00:01:03.789 
record or help your place become more

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:07.350 
record or help your place become more
quiet<00:01:04.059> by<00:01:04.839> silencing<00:01:05.650> or<00:01:05.860> baffling<00:01:06.610> external

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:07.360 
quiet by silencing or baffling external

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.399 
quiet by silencing or baffling external
sounds<00:01:09.149> you<00:01:10.149> should<00:01:10.329> also<00:01:10.479> be<00:01:10.840> aware<00:01:10.869> of

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:11.409 
sounds you should also be aware of

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:15.120 
sounds you should also be aware of
reverb<00:01:12.100> and<00:01:12.420> reflected<00:01:13.420> sounds<00:01:13.979> there<00:01:14.979> are

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:15.130 
reverb and reflected sounds there are

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.389 
reverb and reflected sounds there are
live<00:01:15.369> rooms<00:01:15.820> that<00:01:16.720> have<00:01:16.899> many<00:01:17.200> hard<00:01:17.710> surfaces

00:01:18.389 --> 00:01:18.399 
live rooms that have many hard surfaces

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:20.580 
live rooms that have many hard surfaces
that<00:01:19.119> will<00:01:19.240> bounce<00:01:19.450> sound<00:01:19.810> back<00:01:20.170> into<00:01:20.200> the

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 
that will bounce sound back into the

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.959 
that will bounce sound back into the
microphone<00:01:21.070> that's<00:01:21.579> slightly<00:01:22.060> delayed<00:01:22.540> times

00:01:23.959 --> 00:01:23.969 
microphone that's slightly delayed times

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:27.120 
microphone that's slightly delayed times
you<00:01:24.969> can<00:01:25.149> make<00:01:25.180> a<00:01:25.329> room<00:01:25.719> less<00:01:26.079> live<00:01:26.500> or

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130 
you can make a room less live or

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.819 
you can make a room less live or
reflective<00:01:27.880> by<00:01:28.570> adding<00:01:28.990> sound<00:01:29.290> absorbing

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:29.829 
reflective by adding sound absorbing

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:33.719 
reflective by adding sound absorbing
materials<00:01:30.869> in<00:01:31.869> a<00:01:31.990> recording<00:01:32.469> studio<00:01:32.729> these

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:33.729 
materials in a recording studio these

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:36.179 
materials in a recording studio these
might<00:01:34.060> be<00:01:34.240> acoustic<00:01:34.840> panels<00:01:35.140> of<00:01:35.560> fiber<00:01:35.860> or

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:36.189 
might be acoustic panels of fiber or

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:40.350 
might be acoustic panels of fiber or
foam<00:01:36.610> at<00:01:37.270> home<00:01:38.079> you<00:01:38.799> can<00:01:38.979> improvise<00:01:39.250> and<00:01:39.850> use

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:40.360 
foam at home you can improvise and use

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.950 
foam at home you can improvise and use
rugs<00:01:40.780> or<00:01:41.079> blankets<00:01:41.530> I<00:01:42.030> should<00:01:43.030> also<00:01:43.180> warn<00:01:43.360> you

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:43.960 
rugs or blankets I should also warn you

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.749 
rugs or blankets I should also warn you
that<00:01:44.530> the<00:01:44.740> converse<00:01:45.359> making<00:01:46.359> a<00:01:46.450> room<00:01:46.689> too<00:01:47.020> dead

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
that the converse making a room too dead

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:53.880 
that the converse making a room too dead
can<00:01:48.759> sometimes<00:01:49.240> sound<00:01:49.869> unnatural<00:01:50.200> I<00:01:52.890> also

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
can sometimes sound unnatural I also

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.670 
can sometimes sound unnatural I also
recommend<00:01:54.520> that<00:01:54.729> use<00:01:55.180> a<00:01:55.210> mic<00:01:55.600> stand<00:01:55.810> instead

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:56.680 
recommend that use a mic stand instead

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.950 
recommend that use a mic stand instead
of<00:01:56.829> holding<00:01:57.100> the<00:01:57.759> microphone<00:01:57.969> in<00:01:58.570> your<00:01:58.600> hands

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
of holding the microphone in your hands

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.010 
of holding the microphone in your hands
like<00:01:59.259> this

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:03.930 

alright<00:02:02.740> I've<00:02:02.860> got<00:02:02.890> another<00:02:03.220> mic<00:02:03.520> here

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:03.940 
alright I've got another mic here

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:05.730 
alright I've got another mic here
because<00:02:04.360> I<00:02:04.390> want<00:02:04.630> to<00:02:04.659> talk<00:02:04.840> about<00:02:05.020> avoiding

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
because I want to talk about avoiding

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.920 
because I want to talk about avoiding
vibrations<00:02:06.640> that<00:02:06.940> might<00:02:07.150> shake<00:02:07.510> the<00:02:07.750> mic

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:07.930 
vibrations that might shake the mic

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:10.800 
vibrations that might shake the mic
stand<00:02:08.110> in<00:02:08.590> the<00:02:08.709> slightest<00:02:09.130> way<00:02:09.539> so<00:02:10.539> you<00:02:10.600> might

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
stand in the slightest way so you might

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:12.330 
stand in the slightest way so you might
want<00:02:11.020> to<00:02:11.080> use<00:02:11.319> one<00:02:11.530> of<00:02:11.560> these<00:02:11.770> it's<00:02:12.069> called<00:02:12.280> a

shock mount for the microphone and it

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:16.830 
shock mount for the microphone and it
absorbs<00:02:14.980> any<00:02:15.610> kind<00:02:15.940> of<00:02:16.000> shaking<00:02:16.540> that<00:02:16.660> might

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
absorbs any kind of shaking that might
