environments it's about being out of
control<00:02:37.520> so<00:02:38.520> how<00:02:38.760> did<00:02:38.940> they<00:02:39.120> create<00:02:39.360> an

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
control so how did they create an

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.540 
control so how did they create an
atmosphere<00:02:40.320> that<00:02:40.350> appears<00:02:41.130> to<00:02:41.430> be

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
atmosphere that appears to be

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.570 
atmosphere that appears to be
threatening<00:02:42.120> while<00:02:42.540> keeping<00:02:43.049> it<00:02:43.200> safe<00:02:43.580> it's

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
threatening while keeping it safe it's

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.289 
threatening while keeping it safe it's
all<00:02:44.880> about<00:02:45.239> the<00:02:45.660> high-tech<00:02:45.930> toys<00:02:47.299> basically

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:48.299 
all about the high-tech toys basically

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:49.340 
all about the high-tech toys basically
one<00:02:48.450> of<00:02:48.480> the<00:02:48.570> scares<00:02:48.810> we<00:02:48.959> use<00:02:49.080> in<00:02:49.200> all<00:02:49.320> the

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
one of the scares we use in all the

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.190 
one of the scares we use in all the
houses<00:02:49.590> are<00:02:49.920> these<00:02:50.070> pneumatic<00:02:50.370> devices

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
houses are these pneumatic devices

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.420 
houses are these pneumatic devices
they're<00:02:52.200> handed<00:02:52.470> to<00:02:52.590> the<00:02:52.680> character<00:02:53.100> and<00:02:53.340> as

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
they're handed to the character and as

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:54.530 
they're handed to the character and as
the<00:02:53.549> guests<00:02:53.760> walk<00:02:54.000> through<00:02:54.299> they're

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
the guests walk through they're

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.509 
the guests walk through they're
frightened<00:02:54.870> by<00:02:54.930> the<00:02:54.989> sound<00:02:55.350> if<00:02:55.980> that<00:02:56.130> doesn't

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519 
frightened by the sound if that doesn't

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:01.430 
frightened by the sound if that doesn't
scare<00:02:56.700> them<00:02:58.100> that<00:02:59.100> will<00:02:59.600> this<00:03:00.600> is<00:03:00.780> the<00:03:00.900> vortex

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
scare them that will this is the vortex

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:02.780 
scare them that will this is the vortex
or<00:03:01.680> the<00:03:01.799> tunnel<00:03:02.190> it's<00:03:02.430> a<00:03:02.580> lightweight

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
or the tunnel it's a lightweight

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.090 
or the tunnel it's a lightweight
cylindrical<00:03:03.570> device<00:03:03.840> that<00:03:04.080> spins<00:03:04.380> around<00:03:04.590> a

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
cylindrical device that spins around a

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:06.680 
cylindrical device that spins around a
bridge<00:03:05.400> as<00:03:05.670> you're<00:03:05.850> walking<00:03:06.239> through<00:03:06.450> it

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
bridge as you're walking through it

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.810 
bridge as you're walking through it
it's<00:03:06.959> basically<00:03:07.440> backlit<00:03:08.130> to<00:03:08.610> give<00:03:08.790> a

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.820 
it's basically backlit to give a

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:10.460 
it's basically backlit to give a
disorienting<00:03:09.570> effect<00:03:09.600> that<00:03:10.019> makes<00:03:10.140> you<00:03:10.260> kind

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
disorienting effect that makes you kind

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.020 
disorienting effect that makes you kind
of<00:03:10.530> want<00:03:10.709> to<00:03:10.769> grab<00:03:10.980> onto<00:03:11.220> the<00:03:11.430> rails<00:03:11.640> because

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
of want to grab onto the rails because

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.090 
of want to grab onto the rails because
you're<00:03:12.150> not<00:03:12.269> sure<00:03:12.600> the<00:03:12.840> motion<00:03:13.049> that's<00:03:13.739> going

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
you're not sure the motion that's going

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.410 
you're not sure the motion that's going
through

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.360 

basically<00:03:16.959> this<00:03:17.170> is<00:03:17.230> the<00:03:17.440> waterfall<00:03:17.800> effect

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
basically this is the waterfall effect

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.460 
basically this is the waterfall effect
and<00:03:18.790> consists<00:03:19.150> of<00:03:19.240> a<00:03:19.330> series<00:03:19.690> of<00:03:19.720> pool<00:03:20.050> pumps

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
and consists of a series of pool pumps

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.890 
and consists of a series of pool pumps
that<00:03:20.830> draws<00:03:21.099> the<00:03:21.340> water<00:03:21.550> out<00:03:21.880> of<00:03:21.910> a<00:03:22.090> pool<00:03:22.330> bat

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
that draws the water out of a pool bat

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.620 
that draws the water out of a pool bat
area<00:03:23.410> pumps<00:03:24.040> it<00:03:24.190> up<00:03:24.340> ten<00:03:24.790> feet<00:03:25.060> into<00:03:25.300> the<00:03:25.420> air

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:25.630 
area pumps it up ten feet into the air

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:28.050 
area pumps it up ten feet into the air
the<00:03:26.110> water<00:03:26.290> gently<00:03:26.650> cascades<00:03:27.340> over<00:03:27.670> the<00:03:27.790> side

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
the water gently cascades over the side

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.300 
the water gently cascades over the side
we<00:03:28.599> access<00:03:29.080> this<00:03:29.230> with<00:03:29.500> lighting<00:03:29.830> effect<00:03:30.160> to

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
we access this with lighting effect to

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.190 
we access this with lighting effect to
give<00:03:30.459> it<00:03:30.580> more<00:03:30.730> disorienting<00:03:31.480> of<00:03:31.599> effect<00:03:31.989> and

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.200 
give it more disorienting of effect and

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:33.809 
give it more disorienting of effect and
then<00:03:32.560> we<00:03:32.650> scare<00:03:32.980> from<00:03:33.250> opposite<00:03:33.670> direction

00:03:33.809 --> 00:03:33.819 
then we scare from opposite direction

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:39.030 
then we scare from opposite direction
for<00:03:34.390> full<00:03:34.600> effect<00:03:36.989> so<00:03:37.989> what's<00:03:38.290> it<00:03:38.500> like<00:03:38.530> to

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 
for full effect so what's it like to

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.259 
for full effect so what's it like to
take<00:03:39.370> a<00:03:39.400> trip<00:03:39.760> through<00:03:39.790> maximum<00:03:40.780> carnage<00:03:42.269> now

00:03:43.259 --> 00:03:43.269 
take a trip through maximum carnage now

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:50.220 
take a trip through maximum carnage now
it's<00:03:43.600> your<00:03:43.930> turn<00:03:44.350> to<00:03:44.410> find<00:03:45.100> out<00:03:45.489> a<00:03:48.600> maze<00:03:49.600> of

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230 
it's your turn to find out a maze of

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.270 
it's your turn to find out a maze of
twisted<00:03:50.980> metal<00:03:52.170> chain-link<00:03:53.170> fences<00:03:53.920> and

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
twisted metal chain-link fences and

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:59.710 
twisted metal chain-link fences and
khurana<00:03:54.910> jiz<00:03:55.269> henchmen<00:03:55.989> are<00:03:56.140> on<00:03:56.440> the<00:03:56.890> loose

00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.720 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:05.650 

the<00:04:00.260> music<00:04:00.830> is<00:04:01.160> deafening<00:04:03.820> the<00:04:04.820> lights<00:04:05.150> are

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:05.660 
the music is deafening the lights are

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:08.920 
the music is deafening the lights are
blinding<00:04:06.020> as<00:04:06.680> you<00:04:07.130> trudge<00:04:07.520> through<00:04:07.550> pools<00:04:08.480> of

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:08.930 
blinding as you trudge through pools of

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:22.280 
blinding as you trudge through pools of
toxic<00:04:09.560> waste

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:22.290 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:32.180 

a<00:04:23.600> tunnel<00:04:24.680> disorients<00:04:25.680> you<00:04:25.710> and<00:04:26.190> then

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:32.190 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:35.840 

and<00:04:33.120> finally<00:04:33.930> you<00:04:34.260> enter<00:04:34.740> the<00:04:35.220> nuclear

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:35.850 
and finally you enter the nuclear

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:39.110
