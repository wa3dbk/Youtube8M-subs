00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.070
 Hello Narita video fan 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:13.990
 This time, I will show you some useful tips on smartphones. 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:21.730
 I think that many people are used if you use the smartphone 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:28.830
 When the other party reads the line message, the indication "Readed " appears like this 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:32.850
 You also but I'm very convenient surely knew that was me choose is the other party because 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:38.790
 Now that there is a word to record 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:41.260
 Even though nobles are on hand, there is no answer for them but they are worried 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:47.980
 Call 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:51.250
 Because of that, some people may not want to add read 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:55.140
 Read the message without the eco-read 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.140
 We will guide you through such tricks 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:06.930
 First of First case of android android case first of the line 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:09.180
 When a message arrives , the preview screen may be displayed like this 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:12.869
 As far as seen in the preview 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:16.210
 Than towards the record is not attached opponent read does not stick 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:21.440
 It's ok if you finish previewing line 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:26.960
 If you do not start the app of no recording 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:32.960
 However, in this state, you can not read everything in the case of a long sentence . 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:37.070
 After If you want long sentence to read at not appear here even after stamp reads the stamp 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:41.150
 I can not verify that this is when you want to see want 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:44.990
 It is very easy to say how to do it 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:48.710
 In fact, it is in the mode called airplane mode 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:52.040
 There is no read when starting the line 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:54.710
 I would like to try the message I received now 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:59.220
 Well then first of all 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:04.410
 Let's go into airplane mode How to set 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:06.360
 In the case of android, I think that it varies depending on the model, so in the way of each model 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:11.410
 Please turn on airplane mode 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:15.880
 Now I have turned on the in-flight mode 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:22.270
 Let's start the line in this state example Start the line 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:26.200
 Then I received a message saying good morning from the other party . 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:31.400
 The mast is called if the person who gave actually 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:32.010
 Here I confirmed the message of good morning but it has not been read 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:37.440
 Ah ah ah 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:41.220
 I am doing confirmation but the other party has not read it yet 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:45.240
 By the way, the in-flight mode just before 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:49.600
 I have turned on this airplane mode now 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:56.800
 If you turn it back off, you will be able to read the other person 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:57.910
 Since we have decided to turn off the airplane mode or will here you can see with that read 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:02.620
 I am 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:04.210
 Now it's an iphone iphone shows a preview screen on top for a moment 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:10.380
 Though it was done 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:14.850
 After all it does not attach already read person to check with preview 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:19.380
 The same is true for iphone . 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:22.850
 You can read the message without reading it 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:29.450
 Then in this state 8 first 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:31.550
 If you press the home button here twice, this line seems to be activated in this state 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:33.980
 Once this is this 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:37.720
 Like this 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.720
 Please stop the line once 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:46.550
 You will also be returned to this screen and launch the line first in this condition 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:50.430
 I will receive a message 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:57.329
 As it is only reception, please do not read by this yet 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:59.909
 Here Then please to display this menu from the bottom of the airplane in this state 

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:04.019
 I think you can see that there is a mark 

00:03:59.909 --> 00:04:05.770
 Tap this to turn on airplane mode 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:10.780
 In this state 

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:13.980
 So let's actually read the message to the place of the talk, so here it is here 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:13.980
 When you tap 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:23.880
 Here is the message that today has arrived 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:30.840
 When referred to as if the person who sent in the 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:33.600
 I confirmed the message, but the person who sent it does not have read already 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:36.740
 Here It is also the same Eee 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:38.490
 Also if the flight mode 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:44.600
 turn off 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:51.740
 If you start the line person, the person who has read will be added to the other person 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:54.620
 If you make full use of the in-flight mode like this, you can easily read the line without reading it . 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:59.689
 You can check the message 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:05:05.049
 Please try to become to try sometimes that's put the record is a little 

00:04:59.689 --> 00:05:05.049
 Then it will be more than thank you until the end
