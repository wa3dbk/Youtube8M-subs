00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:05.330
 hello to all and welcome to this live the point fr for 

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:09.430
 a new number seven to eight times dedicated to playing his wife college 

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:13.339
 I do not show you to the introductory video because I really wish 

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:15.499
 go to the basics of this game 

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:18.210
 as I will not talk to you about the script 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.630
 this is just an excuse not to make money 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.829
 while before us on the menu well you'll have the choice between the single player mode or the 

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:27.470
 multiplayer mode 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:30.929
 in the multiplayer mode two options are available 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.929
 to do it locally I could not test 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.890
 it's really very fun because you've come across 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.890
 they will not hesitate to retire practically 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.159
 for solo mode 

00:00:43.159 --> 00:00:45.810
 you will have the choice between campaigning the battles 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:49.540
 the battle mode boils down to afp actually confronted by intelligence 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:50.580
 artificial 

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:53.600
 on the different maps that I'm showing you here 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.580
 for campaign mode 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:02.980
 you'll start with a tutorial to learn the basic commands 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:07.060
 once completed could really get you started in the story by starting 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.100
 by the consortium campaign 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.590
 When finished, you will have access to the campaign I have nothing to do 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:13.050
 say 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:14.790
 once completed 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.860
 will give you access to the advance ward atheist campaign 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.800
 in total it's neither more nor less seven levels to cry crossing with 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.420
 different goals 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.330
 it is not difficult was by the way is very very good of his riders 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.660
 really gradually 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:32.200
 between the first level of the 17th game 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.540
 I propose you to start with this first level 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.870
 so all levels start with a briefing we give you here so 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:41.870
 the main goal knowing that it will have secondary goals 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.510
 so good news for those who do not speak English because everything is translated 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:49.260
 in French of the site of more you will be regular docks of seine for 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.080
 accompany on shot of a staging and there we see a little limit 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:53.460
 of the motor 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.729
 because we really have the impression of seeing images of the time more than 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:57.950
 home 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.549
 at the same time me personally that my wife fram disturb it because the 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:02.580
 most of the time 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.630
 we find ourselves rather far from us infantilize then eyes 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:09.509
 of all that is bodies as we can see and suddenly the kubica side 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:10.529
 is not very embarrassing 

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:12.389
 I have just signed the player 

00:02:12.389 --> 00:02:16.869
 a number one troop so he can go on that goal which 

00:02:16.869 --> 00:02:18.149
 was given to me 

00:02:18.149 --> 00:02:21.149
 m 

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:25.800
 so a little of what happens regularly as well as once 

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:29.219
 you've signed a group a number there's still not a character to 

00:02:29.219 --> 00:02:31.229
 side of the bed durocher has for example 

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:35.119
 who is no longer associated with the number of niro then I do not know 

00:02:35.119 --> 00:02:37.369
 why suddenly he finds himself alone 

00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:39.389
 and like in this kind of game 

00:02:39.389 --> 00:02:42.629
 I think you know who is still very dangerous to be the only one 

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:46.150
 and here really the union is strength so I still have to sign this 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.879
 soldier 

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:50.499
 alice regenerate with the famous green boxes I hope you go 

00:02:50.499 --> 00:02:53.980
 see that very quickly once alone the swoon when we are attacked we lose the 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.980
 life for quickly 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:10.840
 for the developers really have not been stingy with regard to the 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.840
 menu when doing pose in full part 

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:19.209
 here we are in a much more advanced level besides very quickly you 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:22.299
 will learn that it is essential to create the terrain affected 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:26.299
 with them power plant factories happy 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:27.270
 garrisons 

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:30.640
 kawak boats also that will give you a lot of energy that you 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:31.989
 will develop 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:34.029
 all infantry and tank units 

00:03:34.029 --> 00:03:36.490
 speaking of unity and ben you are going to be 

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:41.680
 block it with 40 unit yes that's enough the tracker but maybe it's 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.459
 a bias of the developers for 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:46.409
 or to make those who have lens I have goals 

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:50.540
 6il to reach we see what it was also our state of divinity for 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:51.599
 manage 

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:55.209
 more than 40 units it seems a little weird all the same 

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:59.539
 the developers still made twists of time the 

00:03:59.539 --> 00:04:00.409
 scenario 

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:04.129
 but very sincerely between us it does not break three legs to a duck 

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:09.079
 the game is still fluid I remain a fan I took a lot of fun 

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:13.139
 to play it but in any case personally what I appreciate is 

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:14.409
 to play online 

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:17.009
 because nothing like being in front of human beings 

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:20.489
 which are much stronger than any artificial intelligence that has been 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:21.829
 in program 10 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:25.199
 so to summarize only the fair minutes fault 

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:29.430
 I will share with you the strengths and weaknesses of this 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:29.570
 Thu
