that the spears here at the end are
really<00:00:48.930> really<00:00:49.170> tight<00:00:49.379> if<00:00:49.559> they<00:00:49.710> start

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
really really tight if they start

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.290

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
there so we've got the asparagus I'm

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.010 
there so we've got the asparagus I'm
going<00:00:53.579> to<00:00:53.640> add<00:00:53.730> two<00:00:54.030> I<00:00:54.059> think<00:00:54.539> two<00:00:54.690> would<00:00:54.840> work

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
going to add two I think two would work

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.490 
going to add two I think two would work
here<00:00:55.260> let's<00:00:55.980> see<00:00:56.160> if<00:00:56.219> we<00:00:56.309> can<00:00:56.460> do<00:00:56.550> two<00:00:56.789> or<00:00:56.910> three

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:57.500 
here let's see if we can do two or three

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.900 
here let's see if we can do two or three
so<00:00:58.500> I'm<00:00:58.559> using<00:00:58.739> Canadian<00:00:59.250> Harve<00:00:59.460> already<00:00:59.730> look

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
so I'm using Canadian Harve already look

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.369 
so I'm using Canadian Harve already look
at<00:00:59.969> it<00:01:00.120> look<00:01:00.270> at<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.480> texture<00:01:00.809> it's<00:01:00.930> buttery

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
at it look at the texture it's buttery

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.529 
at it look at the texture it's buttery
and<00:01:01.590> creamy<00:01:01.710> and<00:01:02.219> it's<00:01:02.789> salty<00:01:03.180> too<00:01:03.300> and<00:01:03.480> the

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
and creamy and it's salty too and the

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:04.880 
and creamy and it's salty too and the
kids<00:01:03.750> will<00:01:03.899> really<00:01:04.019> gravitate<00:01:04.589> to<00:01:04.739> that

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
kids will really gravitate to that

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:05.929 
kids will really gravitate to that
that's<00:01:05.129> why<00:01:05.309> we're<00:01:05.519> cheating<00:01:05.729> with

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
that's why we're cheating with

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.830 
that's why we're cheating with
prosciutto<00:01:06.150> too<00:01:06.600> so<00:01:07.170> that'll<00:01:07.380> go<00:01:07.560> in<00:01:07.680> here<00:01:08.840> and

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
prosciutto too so that'll go in here and

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.660 
prosciutto too so that'll go in here and
now<00:01:10.439> a<00:01:10.470> tight<00:01:10.799> roll<00:01:11.010> I<00:01:11.040> don't<00:01:11.340> want<00:01:11.460> to<00:01:11.549> use

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
now a tight roll I don't want to use

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.920 
now a tight roll I don't want to use
some<00:01:11.880> skewers<00:01:12.299> and<00:01:14.420> take<00:01:15.420> your<00:01:15.540> time<00:01:15.750> don't

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
some skewers and take your time don't

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.719 
some skewers and take your time don't
worry<00:01:16.200> if<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:16.619> prosciutto<00:01:16.799> breaks<00:01:17.340> because

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
worry if the prosciutto breaks because

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:18.770 
worry if the prosciutto breaks because
you<00:01:17.850> know<00:01:17.970> when<00:01:18.150> you're<00:01:18.270> gonna<00:01:18.390> put<00:01:18.630> it<00:01:18.689> in

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
you know when you're gonna put it in

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:19.820 
you know when you're gonna put it in
your<00:01:18.869> skillet<00:01:19.140> and<00:01:19.380> cook<00:01:19.409> it

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
your skillet and cook it

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.679 
your skillet and cook it
it'll<00:01:20.490> sear<00:01:20.729> nicely<00:01:21.210> and<00:01:21.360> it'll<00:01:21.570> hold

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
it'll sear nicely and it'll hold

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:27.350 
it'll sear nicely and it'll hold
together<00:01:25.159> now<00:01:26.159> I<00:01:26.340> put<00:01:26.640> in<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:26.909> skewer<00:01:27.210> this

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
together now I put in the skewer this

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.149 
together now I put in the skewer this
way<00:01:27.600> as<00:01:27.840> opposed<00:01:28.290> to<00:01:28.380> going<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.890> other<00:01:28.920> way

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
way as opposed to going the other way

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.679 
way as opposed to going the other way
because<00:01:29.520> it'll<00:01:29.700> be<00:01:29.790> easier<00:01:29.820> for<00:01:30.090> me<00:01:30.299> to<00:01:30.479> toss

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
because it'll be easier for me to toss

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.899 
because it'll be easier for me to toss
them<00:01:30.990> I<00:01:31.170> need<00:01:31.619> the<00:01:31.740> zest<00:01:31.920> of<00:01:32.070> a<00:01:32.159> lemon<00:01:32.189> I<00:01:32.579> always

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
them I need the zest of a lemon I always

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.249 
them I need the zest of a lemon I always
make<00:01:33.060> sure<00:01:33.090> I<00:01:33.270> have<00:01:33.360> one<00:01:33.720> ready<00:01:33.960> in<00:01:34.140> the

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
make sure I have one ready in the

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.830 
make sure I have one ready in the
freezer<00:01:34.500> it's<00:01:35.009> a<00:01:35.130> lot<00:01:35.460> easier<00:01:35.700> to<00:01:35.939> zest<00:01:36.360> when

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
freezer it's a lot easier to zest when

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.840
