00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:05.500 
to get it spot-on right so we've made a

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.680 
to get it spot-on right so we've made a
judgment<00:01:06.130> an<00:01:06.280> executive<00:01:06.909> decision<00:01:07.120> on

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:12.330 
summers how we want to play it and leave
it<00:01:10.479> sometimes<00:01:11.200> we've<00:01:11.380> had<00:01:11.409> to<00:01:11.650> leave<00:01:11.830> bits<00:01:12.130> off

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:12.340 
it sometimes we've had to leave bits off

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.100 
it sometimes we've had to leave bits off
because<00:01:12.580> there's<00:01:12.909> not<00:01:13.000> enough<00:01:13.210> layers<00:01:13.540> in<00:01:13.870> the

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:14.110 
because there's not enough layers in the

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:16.679 
because there's not enough layers in the
game<00:01:14.320> to<00:01:14.590> get<00:01:14.740> it<00:01:14.830> exactly<00:01:15.250> right<00:01:15.340> or<00:01:15.820> there's

00:01:16.679 --> 00:01:16.689 
game to get it exactly right or there's

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:19.620 
game to get it exactly right or there's
not<00:01:16.869> a<00:01:16.930> matching<00:01:17.500> template<00:01:18.219> but<00:01:18.909> the<00:01:19.030> idea<00:01:19.390> is

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:19.630 
not a matching template but the idea is

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.080 
not a matching template but the idea is
that<00:01:19.659> you<00:01:20.170> follow<00:01:20.649> us<00:01:20.920> through<00:01:21.340> these<00:01:21.610> videos
