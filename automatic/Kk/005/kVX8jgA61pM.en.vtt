for<00:00:13.410> the<00:00:13.469> pros<00:00:13.769> we<00:00:14.219> have<00:00:14.429> its<00:00:14.790> lightweight<00:00:15.150> so

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
for the pros we have its lightweight so

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.380 
for the pros we have its lightweight so
it's<00:00:16.400> it's<00:00:17.400> lightweight<00:00:17.699> but<00:00:18.060> the<00:00:18.180> thing<00:00:18.359> is

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
it's it's lightweight but the thing is

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.029 
it's it's lightweight but the thing is
it's<00:00:18.630> seven<00:00:18.960> point<00:00:19.170> nine<00:00:19.199> inches<00:00:19.650> in<00:00:19.800> design

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
it's seven point nine inches in design

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.410 
it's seven point nine inches in design
so<00:00:20.189> it's<00:00:20.340> really<00:00:20.520> really<00:00:20.850> nice<00:00:20.970> and<00:00:21.210> thin<00:00:21.390> a

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
so it's really really nice and thin a

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.359 
so it's really really nice and thin a
little<00:00:21.779> so<00:00:21.960> it's<00:00:22.350> quite<00:00:22.590> good<00:00:22.769> in<00:00:22.980> terms<00:00:23.130> of

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
little so it's quite good in terms of

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.660 
little so it's quite good in terms of
size<00:00:23.939> and<00:00:23.970> weight<00:00:24.510> yeah<00:00:25.260> in<00:00:25.529> a<00:00:25.619> sense<00:00:25.859> now

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
size and weight yeah in a sense now

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.150 
size and weight yeah in a sense now
another<00:00:27.539> pro<00:00:27.810> for<00:00:28.080> it<00:00:28.199> would<00:00:28.380> be<00:00:28.529> it<00:00:28.740> supports

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
another pro for it would be it supports

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.490 
another pro for it would be it supports
the<00:00:29.279> 4g<00:00:29.640> LTE<00:00:30.090> network<00:00:30.570> so<00:00:30.810> everybody<00:00:31.320> will

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
the 4g LTE network so everybody will

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.740 
the 4g LTE network so everybody will
love<00:00:31.650> that<00:00:31.880> especially<00:00:32.880> as<00:00:33.000> more<00:00:33.420> and<00:00:33.660> more

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
love that especially as more and more

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.750 
love that especially as more and more
applications<00:00:34.440> these<00:00:34.620> days<00:00:34.829> require<00:00:35.340> a<00:00:35.370> much

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
applications these days require a much

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.190 
applications these days require a much
larger<00:00:36.660> broader<00:00:37.370> bandwidth<00:00:38.370> really<00:00:39.200> moving

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
larger broader bandwidth really moving

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.410 
larger broader bandwidth really moving
on<00:00:40.320> along<00:00:40.440> is<00:00:40.800> they<00:00:41.070> it's<00:00:41.520> got<00:00:41.730> of<00:00:41.879> course<00:00:42.120> the

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
on along is they it's got of course the

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.380 
on along is they it's got of course the
App<00:00:42.540> Store<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:42.960> act<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.530> apps<00:00:44.390> ecosystem

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
App Store the act the apps ecosystem

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.190 
App Store the act the apps ecosystem
really<00:00:46.070> which<00:00:47.070> is<00:00:47.280> really<00:00:48.059> good<00:00:48.270> because<00:00:48.329> the

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
really which is really good because the

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.100 
really which is really good because the
usually<00:00:49.770> got<00:00:50.149> quite<00:00:51.149> a<00:00:51.180> few<00:00:51.360> ups<00:00:51.510> are<00:00:51.629> about

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
usually got quite a few ups are about

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.410 
usually got quite a few ups are about
250<00:00:52.620> k<00:00:53.160> apps<00:00:53.430> at<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:53.699> moment<00:00:54.059> and<00:00:54.149> they're<00:00:54.300> all

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
250 k apps at the moment and they're all

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.479 
250 k apps at the moment and they're all
generally<00:00:54.899> quality<00:00:55.500> apps<00:00:55.680> in<00:00:55.920> comparisons<00:00:56.430> of

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
generally quality apps in comparisons of

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:57.860 
generally quality apps in comparisons of
the<00:00:56.610> android<00:00:57.000> market<00:00:57.360> which<00:00:57.480> is<00:00:57.629> probably

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
the android market which is probably

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.170 
the android market which is probably
double<00:00:58.379> the<00:00:58.469> size<00:00:58.680> but<00:00:59.100> certainly<00:00:59.969> less

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
double the size but certainly less

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.380 
double the size but certainly less
quality<00:01:00.600> like<00:01:00.899> it<00:01:01.020> in<00:01:01.109> quality<00:01:01.500> a<00:01:01.530> bit<00:01:02.210> last<00:01:03.210> of

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
quality like it in quality a bit last of

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.539 
quality like it in quality a bit last of
the<00:01:03.480> pros<00:01:03.719> i'm<00:01:04.110> putting<00:01:04.500> on<00:01:04.710> is<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.250> 10<00:01:05.460> hour

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
the pros i'm putting on is the 10 hour

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.280 
the pros i'm putting on is the 10 hour
battery<00:01:05.640> life<00:01:05.970> that's<00:01:06.330> really<00:01:06.659> cool<00:01:06.900> that's

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
battery life that's really cool that's

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.130 
battery life that's really cool that's
that's<00:01:07.619> awesome<00:01:08.010> for<00:01:08.040> such<00:01:08.430> a<00:01:08.460> small<00:01:08.670> device

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140 
that's awesome for such a small device

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.530 
that's awesome for such a small device
okay<00:01:10.140> now<00:01:10.350> moving<00:01:10.590> on<00:01:10.770> to<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:10.920> cons<00:01:11.250> it's<00:01:11.729> got

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
okay now moving on to the cons it's got

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.530 
okay now moving on to the cons it's got
a<00:01:12.570> slower<00:01:13.290> processor<00:01:14.070> so<00:01:14.340> it<00:01:14.580> uses<00:01:14.760> utilizes

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
a slower processor so it uses utilizes

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.609 
a slower processor so it uses utilizes

days that isn't as they you know to

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.030 
days that isn't as they you know to
happen<00:01:36.329> there's<00:01:36.540> retina<00:01:37.229> display<00:01:37.619> this<00:01:37.860> is

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
happen there's retina display this is

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.899 
happen there's retina display this is
not<00:01:38.250> a<00:01:38.460> retina<00:01:38.850> display<00:01:39.829> display<00:01:40.829> display<00:01:41.130> so

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
not a retina display display display so

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.420 
not a retina display display display so
that's<00:01:42.360> a<00:01:42.450> bit<00:01:42.540> of<00:01:42.570> a<00:01:42.659> shame<00:01:42.869> it's<00:01:43.079> only<00:01:43.259> got

pixels<00:01:56.250> per<00:01:56.610> square<00:01:56.640> inch<00:01:56.909> so<00:01:57.180> roughly<00:01:57.479> double

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
pixels per square inch so roughly double

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.280 
pixels per square inch so roughly double
which<00:01:57.990> makes<00:01:58.590> it<00:01:58.740> retina<00:01:59.869> so<00:02:00.869> yeah<00:02:01.020> that's<00:02:01.140> a

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
which makes it retina so yeah that's a

starts from us three hundred and thirty
dollars<00:02:58.500> which<00:02:59.070> is<00:02:59.220> a<00:02:59.250> shame<00:02:59.340> because<00:02:59.580> the<00:03:01.100> the

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
dollars which is a shame because the the
