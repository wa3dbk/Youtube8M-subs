the net the relaxant this is it was

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:10.710 
the net the relaxant this is it was
about<00:02:09.720> this<00:02:09.959> much<00:02:10.200> natural

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
about this much natural

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:16.020 
about this much natural
and<00:02:12.780> this<00:02:13.780> is<00:02:13.960> the<00:02:14.080> result<00:02:14.260> so<00:02:14.860> I<00:02:15.220> mean<00:02:15.850> it's

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
and this is the result so I mean it's

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.520 
and this is the result so I mean it's
growing<00:02:17.070> and<00:02:18.070> it's<00:02:18.630> I'm<00:02:19.630> not<00:02:19.900> complaining<00:02:20.380> and

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
growing and it's I'm not complaining and

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.040 
growing and it's I'm not complaining and
I<00:02:20.620> didn't<00:02:20.950> do<00:02:21.040> it<00:02:21.070> that<00:02:21.190> long<00:02:21.610> ago<00:02:22.030> not<00:02:22.780> at<00:02:22.930> all

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
I didn't do it that long ago not at all

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:28.760 
I didn't do it that long ago not at all
so<00:02:24.330> yep<00:02:25.710> last<00:02:26.710> night<00:02:27.040> I<00:02:27.370> did<00:02:27.640> the<00:02:27.730> fo<00:02:28.060> g

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
so yep last night I did the fo g

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:32.750 
so yep last night I did the fo g
two-step<00:02:30.000> protein<00:02:31.000> treatment<00:02:31.420> wrong<00:02:31.660> bottom

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
two-step protein treatment wrong bottom

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.380 
two-step protein treatment wrong bottom
alright<00:02:33.760> let's<00:02:33.970> do<00:02:34.150> that<00:02:34.300> again<00:02:35.010> asaji<00:02:36.240> no<00:02:37.240> I'm

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
alright let's do that again asaji no I'm

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:38.850 
alright let's do that again asaji no I'm
not<00:02:37.510> even<00:02:37.570> going<00:02:37.900> to<00:02:37.960> cut<00:02:38.170> that<00:02:38.200> out<00:02:38.380> that<00:02:38.740> was

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
not even going to cut that out that was

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.670 
not even going to cut that out that was
funny<00:02:39.100> oh<00:02:39.340> fo<00:02:39.910> g<00:02:39.970> two-step<00:02:40.840> protein<00:02:41.230> treatment

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
funny oh fo g two-step protein treatment

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.410 
funny oh fo g two-step protein treatment
and<00:02:42.400> I<00:02:43.060> liked<00:02:43.660> it<00:02:43.930> it's<00:02:44.200> for<00:02:44.730> is<00:02:45.730> slow<00:02:46.120> it

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
and I liked it it's for is slow it

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.870 
and I liked it it's for is slow it
stopped<00:02:46.750> hair<00:02:46.959> breakage<00:02:47.230> and<00:02:47.620> it's<00:02:47.770> ideal<00:02:48.520> for

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
stopped hair breakage and it's ideal for

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.330 
stopped hair breakage and it's ideal for
color-treated<00:02:49.600> relax<00:02:50.350> or<00:02:50.560> perm<00:02:50.800> here<00:02:50.980> and<00:02:51.220> my

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
color-treated relax or perm here and my

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.570 
color-treated relax or perm here and my
hair<00:02:51.640> is<00:02:51.820> definitely<00:02:52.660> color<00:02:53.380> treated<00:02:53.860> if<00:02:54.400> your

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:54.580 
hair is definitely color treated if your

hair is definitely color treated if your
hair<00:02:54.700> is<00:02:54.730> damaged<00:02:55.270> and<00:02:55.510> not<00:02:55.990> dry<00:02:56.380> than<00:02:57.130> yeah

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
hair is damaged and not dry than yeah

00:02:57.459 --> 00:02:59.340 
hair is damaged and not dry than yeah
you<00:02:57.880> should<00:02:58.120> use<00:02:58.270> this<00:02:58.480> but<00:02:58.750> I've<00:02:58.930> heard

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:08.080 
do your research I did the two-step

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.080 
do your research I did the two-step
protein<00:03:08.500> treatment<00:03:08.980> and<00:03:09.160> then<00:03:09.400> I<00:03:09.430> followed<00:03:09.790> it

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
protein treatment and then I followed it

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.030 
protein treatment and then I followed it
up<00:03:10.300> with<00:03:10.570> the<00:03:11.050> balancing<00:03:11.530> moisturizer<00:03:11.709> that

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
up with the balancing moisturizer that

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.710 
up with the balancing moisturizer that
they<00:03:12.250> are<00:03:12.400> sold<00:03:12.700> separately<00:03:12.970> and<00:03:13.390> I<00:03:13.450> was<00:03:13.570> very

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720

confused when i saw that I'm to steph

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.160 
confused when i saw that I'm to steph
protein<00:03:15.820> treatment<00:03:16.239> I<00:03:16.420> was<00:03:16.780> like<00:03:16.900> really

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
protein treatment I was like really

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:19.830 
protein treatment I was like really
where's<00:03:18.010> houses<00:03:18.880> two<00:03:19.060> steps<00:03:19.330> all<00:03:19.540> you<00:03:19.630> do<00:03:19.750> is

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 
when she wasn't looking actually pulled

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.210 
when she wasn't looking actually pulled
the<00:03:34.060> tab<00:03:34.300> back<00:03:34.600> and<00:03:34.870> read<00:03:35.050> the<00:03:35.140> directions<00:03:35.500> and

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.220 
the tab back and read the directions and

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:38.550 
the tab back and read the directions and
I<00:03:36.519> was<00:03:36.640> like<00:03:36.790> and<00:03:37.000> they<00:03:37.239> actually<00:03:37.570> named<00:03:38.050> this

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
I was like and they actually named this

so yeah that's what I went for the

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.390 
so yeah that's what I went for the
advantage<00:03:41.410> of<00:03:41.530> hair<00:03:41.680> moisturizer<00:03:42.220> here<00:03:42.640> and

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
advantage of hair moisturizer here and

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.949 
advantage of hair moisturizer here and
improves<00:03:45.400> manageability<00:03:46.060> softness<00:03:46.780> and

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:46.959 
improves manageability softness and

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:51.030 
improves manageability softness and
shine<00:03:47.200> and<00:03:47.640> the<00:03:48.640> elasticity<00:03:49.120> of<00:03:49.530> your<00:03:50.530> hair<00:03:50.799> is

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 
shine and the elasticity of your hair is

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.400 
shine and the elasticity of your hair is
what<00:03:51.730> the<00:03:51.940> protein<00:03:52.450> treatment<00:03:52.810> is<00:03:52.870> for<00:03:53.140> as

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:53.410 
what the protein treatment is for as

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:56.729 
what the protein treatment is for as
well<00:03:54.040> and<00:03:54.480> then<00:03:55.480> I<00:03:55.510> followed<00:03:55.989> it<00:03:56.290> up<00:03:56.410> with<00:03:56.470> the

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:56.739 
well and then I followed it up with the

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:00.509 
well and then I followed it up with the
4g<00:03:57.420> provide<00:03:58.420> my<00:03:58.600> leave<00:03:58.780> in<00:03:58.900> conditioner<00:03:59.519> works

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:00.519 
4g provide my leave in conditioner works

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:04.039
