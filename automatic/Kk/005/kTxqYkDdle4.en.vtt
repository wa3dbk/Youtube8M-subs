00:00:00.789 --> 00:00:01.789
Hey, everyone.

00:00:01.789 --> 00:00:03.190
It’s Matt from Kenhub!

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:10.540
And in this tutorial, we will discuss the
serratus anterior muscle.

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:16.189
The serratus anterior muscle is a fan-shaped
muscle at the lateral wall of the thorax.

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:20.829
Its main part lies deep under the scapula
and the pectoral muscles.

00:00:20.829 --> 00:00:26.340
It is easy to palpate between the pectoralis
major and latissimus dorsi muscles.

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.800
In athletic bodies, the muscle may even be
visible to the naked eye along the ribs, underneath

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.660
the axilla.

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:41.870
The serratus anterior muscle originates at
the first to ninth rib and inserts at the

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:45.460
ventral surface of the medial border of the
scapula.

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:51.940
Because of its course, it has a saw-tooth
or serrated appearance, hence the name “serratus

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:53.680
anterior.”

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.520
The muscle is further divided into three parts.

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:02.880
The superior part consists of the part from
the first to second rib, extending to the

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.570
superior angle of the scapula.

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:11.950
The intermediate part is from the second to
third rib to the medial border of the scapula.

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:17.620
And the inferior part is the section from
the fourth to ninth rib to the medial border

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:20.710
and inferior angle of the scapula.

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:26.280
This part is the most prominent and powerful
one.

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:33.300
The innervation is supplied by the long thoracic
nerve, a branch of the brachial plexus.

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:40.500
The contraction of the entire serratus anterior
leads to a ventrolateral movement of the scapula

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.080
along the ribs.

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.830
Another function of the serratus anterior
is the act of stabilization of the scapula

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:48.159
within the shoulder.

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:54.640
Finally, in a fixed scapula, the muscle lifts
the ribs and acts as an accessory inspiratory

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.690
muscle.

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:01.720
Due to the pull of the inferior part at the
lower scapula, the shoulder joint is shifted

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:02.720
superiorly.

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.950
This shifting, then, enables the arm to lift
above ninety degrees.

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:12.560
In contrast, the superior part depresses the
scapula and thus acts antagonistically.

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:20.180
This video is more fun than reading a textbook,
right?
