 rosemary with one with a box that 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:27.970
 the collector calls and I feel that 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:30.119
 transmits much of the culture and has 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:32.769
 a very particular technique that seems 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:39.760

 and I really like what vÃ­ctor does 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:17.790
 because Rodriguez is an artist who 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.620

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.420
 love what he does to Mexican parties 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:33.000

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:35.490

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.940
 now I have not seen everything is from Olafur 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:41.710
 eliasson is like a telescope 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:53.440
 acrylic colors 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:55.060
 on a wooden base very very father the 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:58.110
 dinosaur skeleton that is there from 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:07.780
 ortega loved not know why 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:10.060
 automotive I just entered the 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.890
 Exhibition of Hector Esrawe and the truth 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.170
 which is one of my favorite designers 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.300
 the furniture that handles as very 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:22.300
 simple but with woods like 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:23.680
 I like it a lot and it 's a piece 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.819
 that the truth that touched me a lot 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.450
 heart I think that's what you have to 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:31.360
 make art are 78 acrylics but 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.370
 they deal with the archives of year 68 behind 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.290
 of the alcor what happened before during and 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.060
 after this massacre in the plaza 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.130
 the three cultures shakes me a lot 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.450
 because it starts with the files that 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.430
 have I do not know how those who are less 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.440
 censored are clearer let's say here 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.330
 up and then going through another type 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.980
 from archives to the social issues that 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:50.580
 are those that are on the floor is 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.580
 Awesome 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.440
 and a toledo that I loved there is a 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.580
 rabbit with a scorpion in the gallery 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.580
 enrique guerrero where he gave me 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:17.360
 ramis i ramis markets this armchair my 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:20.870
 neighbor is a beauty in pure way 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:23.470
 but the whole exhibition is worth a lot 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:23.470
 the sorrow
