00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
interesting title in the interview I

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.560 
interesting title in the interview I
watched<00:01:31.369> Miyamoto<00:01:32.369> was<00:01:32.640> talking<00:01:33.060> about<00:01:33.329> the

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
watched Miyamoto was talking about the

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.039 
watched Miyamoto was talking about the
image<00:01:33.990> of<00:01:34.290> link<00:01:34.650> holding<00:01:35.280> his<00:01:35.579> sword<00:01:36.509> to<00:01:36.780> the

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
image of link holding his sword to the

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.280 
image of link holding his sword to the
sky<00:01:37.290> because<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.759> game<00:01:38.939> does<00:01:39.270> center<00:01:40.049> around

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
sky because the game does center around

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.010 
sky because the game does center around
thorn<00:01:41.009> they<00:01:41.430> don't<00:01:41.729> say<00:01:42.000> it's<00:01:42.150> a<00:01:42.270> master<00:01:42.720> Ford

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
thorn they don't say it's a master Ford

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.920 
thorn they don't say it's a master Ford
but<00:01:43.350> it<00:01:43.470> it<00:01:43.710> looks<00:01:44.579> like<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:44.820> master<00:01:45.119> sword<00:01:45.630> so

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
but it it looks like the master sword so

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.420 
but it it looks like the master sword so
I'm<00:01:46.159> assuming<00:01:47.159> it's<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:47.759> master<00:01:48.240> sword<00:01:48.509> and

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:49.430 
I'm assuming it's the master sword and

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.370 
I'm assuming it's the master sword and
apparently<00:01:50.430> the<00:01:50.610> sky<00:01:50.909> has<00:01:51.420> a<00:01:51.659> lot<00:01:52.020> to<00:01:52.200> do<00:01:52.350> with

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
apparently the sky has a lot to do with

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.069 
apparently the sky has a lot to do with
this<00:01:52.619> Zelda<00:01:52.979> game<00:01:53.130> so<00:01:53.880> I<00:01:54.180> am<00:01:54.420> excited<00:01:54.810> about

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:19.970 
I can't have a full opinion until the
games<00:02:16.530> actually<00:02:16.799> released<00:02:17.510> but<00:02:18.510> until<00:02:19.440> then<00:02:19.650> I

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
games actually released but until then I

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.559 
games actually released but until then I
am<00:02:20.580> really<00:02:21.150> excited<00:02:21.360> and<00:02:22.549> I<00:02:23.549> hope<00:02:24.030> you<00:02:24.209> all<00:02:24.239> are

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 
am really excited and I hope you all are

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:27.530 
am really excited and I hope you all are
too<00:02:24.810> because<00:02:25.379> really<00:02:25.890> new<00:02:26.670> zelda<00:02:27.030> games<00:02:27.209> don't

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
too because really new zelda games don't

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.069 
too because really new zelda games don't
come<00:02:27.750> around<00:02:27.870> that<00:02:28.200> often<00:02:29.120> also<00:02:30.120> one<00:02:31.049> more

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:31.079 
come around that often also one more

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:33.470 
come around that often also one more
thing<00:02:31.380> about<00:02:31.799> the<00:02:32.099> game<00:02:32.310> that<00:02:32.340> i<00:02:32.849> am<00:02:33.000> really

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
thing about the game that i am really

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.460 
thing about the game that i am really
excited<00:02:33.750> about<00:02:34.670> the<00:02:35.670> saw<00:02:35.970> flows<00:02:36.269> or<00:02:36.599> at<00:02:37.200> least

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
excited about the saw flows or at least

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.170 
excited about the saw flows or at least
that's<00:02:37.709> what<00:02:37.860> it<00:02:37.890> looks<00:02:38.010> like<00:02:38.430> you<00:02:38.790> know<00:02:38.970> a

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
that's what it looks like you know a

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.410 
that's what it looks like you know a
skeleton<00:02:39.840> warrior<00:02:40.260> it's<00:02:41.250> holding<00:02:41.579> two<00:02:41.879> swords

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
skeleton warrior it's holding two swords

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.369 
skeleton warrior it's holding two swords
now<00:02:43.260> I<00:02:43.739> don't<00:02:44.459> know<00:02:44.700> how<00:02:45.690> many<00:02:45.720> people<00:02:45.959> are

00:02:46.369 --> 00:02:46.379 
now I don't know how many people are

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:49.580 
now I don't know how many people are
familiar<00:02:46.440> with<00:02:46.829> this<00:02:47.069> but<00:02:47.819> in<00:02:48.030> the<00:02:48.269> NES<00:02:48.750> staff

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
familiar with this but in the NES staff

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:54.050 
familiar with this but in the NES staff
lowes<00:02:49.890> held<00:02:50.670> two<00:02:51.390> swords<00:02:52.040> so<00:02:53.040> this<00:02:53.549> seems<00:02:53.910> like

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
lowes held two swords so this seems like

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.319 
lowes held two swords so this seems like
a<00:02:54.180> throwback<00:02:54.660> to<00:02:54.900> the<00:02:55.829> original<00:02:56.640> nes<00:02:57.060> game

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:57.329 
a throwback to the original nes game

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:00.680 
a throwback to the original nes game
which<00:02:58.260> is<00:02:58.440> awesome
