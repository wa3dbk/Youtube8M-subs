00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.730
 I welcome you to the program today 

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:07.589
 another video on borderlands 2 case 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:12.389
 the fact that recently I was here 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:14.969
 suggested that there is on one of the cards in 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:18.690
 easter board related second boards 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:21.359
 minecraft I wondered first 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.460
 I tried to find the best and could not, and 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.580
 the devil asked the person where she is there 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:29.099
 specifically is here and after which I and 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.380
 saw looked and decided to you too 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.660
 show if you are not aware that there 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.489
 so there is something I think for you is 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.530
 it will be interesting but the only thing I 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.300
 I warn you it will be possible here 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.550
 spoilers so who can be not 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.129
 Finish up to this level would be better 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.510
 this thing does not look here for all 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.640
 the rest I thought it would be pretty 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:51.180
 interesting at least to myself but 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:54.510
 it was very nice to see especially 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.760
 nice because besides just 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.640
 minecraft style is still there 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.109
 heads for characters in this place 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.640
 which I want to show you later 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.309
 it will be possible to wear the same square 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.479
 maynkrafta just you and a head 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:08.729
 proper map 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:12.900
 caustic caves don't know what it's called 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:16.920
 in the original, who probably played here already 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:20.970
 knows this card 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:24.119
 I honestly do not intend here especially 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.990
 dwell on the ordinary ones here 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.830
 bugs i mean i think i just 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.299
 run 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:30.299
 to the place we need 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:47.670
 the thing is that but still aware 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.670
 that there is a very, very long time, you can go and 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:53.350
 if you literally fight with everyone 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.610
 opponents I do not want to do it 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.100
 specially on record 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:00.610
 I want to make this video as much as possible 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:03.310
 I hope so short 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:06.270
 get out at all, I hope that I'm up there 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:09.310
 At least I run down because here 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:13.510
 quite a lot of opponents 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:16.380
 serious opponents do not want out of here 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.380
 run whole 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:48.030
 now practically we came here 

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:52.439
 A little bit of a cut in principle for those who 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:56.220
 I played in the course that there is execution 

00:02:52.439 --> 00:03:00.019
 one mission here somewhere in these 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:02.489
 together it dragged 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:04.319
 like from the story mission there is something necessary 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:05.129
 pick up either the artifact or something else 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:10.290
 don't remember exactly 

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:12.409
 Well, in general, we are on the spot guys 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.409
 with you 

00:03:13.669 --> 00:03:17.530
 with these 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:23.520
 with these nasty guys will have 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:28.060
 defeat my weak shield pretty 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:34.330
 he is very interesting in terms of 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:37.920
 what it gives but very very weak can 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:37.920
 be not going to intervene in this fight 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.780
 Yes, probably we will not interfere 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:51.850
 letting each other go there 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:53.739
 we are now the goal of them actually do a 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:58.270
 show you where Easter eggs are 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:04:04.510
 connected with minecraft and so the floor map 

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:06.340
 here I am here and such caves you 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:08.290
 see where I am compared to 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:12.030
 the entrance could of course and run to the left 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:14.940
 but there in my opinion is more dangerous than 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:19.030
 right if you run 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:20.440
 so we need to make this place 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:22.780
 By the way, Easter eggs are not visible either. 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:27.820
 where from the card it is easy 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:28.540
 miss go here we jump on here 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:34.510
 this pebble 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:37.740
 You see, here we rock back 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:41.320
 we have these ruins 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:45.190
 old some buildings go 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:47.890
 here we turn the corner and see already 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:53.160
 blocks familiar to us are not whipped 

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:55.370
 nothing but a cam 

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:58.080
 that shoot nothing happens 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:05:00.990
 broken only cam zubastik 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:03.570
 you need quite a few ordinary blocks 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:06.330
 sand there are blocks that contain 

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:10.290
 to yourself but by sight like coal metal 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:13.740
 they keep you ammo there I donâ€™t remember 

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:17.210
 something else but we don't need anything 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:19.860
 we need to collect some head 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:22.410
 for this we need to make the passage from 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:25.920
 these blocks here the cave is quite large 

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:29.390
 Immediately I can say go inside here 

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:29.390
 something more interesting 

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:36.930
 cartridge cases 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:39.770
 me hugs big trouble did not stop 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:45.200
 not for harm the most interesting thing is 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:45.200
 to meet here and find out now 

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:56.639
 You will surely recognize these characters 

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:56.639
 guys power 

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:14.890
 so let's go still go go to me 

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:24.550
 guys are dangerous such directly do not go and 

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:28.680
 They have surrendered to the boss then quickly 

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:32.830
 principle on this we all won 

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:39.490
 that stuck kind of money 

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:42.420
 and only we do not need this already available 

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:42.420
 already available 

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:50.310
 No, we do not need it can only be 

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:53.820
 for sale and take the head like me and 

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:55.410
 spoke every time falls out to different 

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:56.670
 characters but not always to 

00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:58.650
 different it may happen again 

00:06:56.670 --> 00:07:00.750
 at least going here there once 

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:03.450
 I think his ten for all my 

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:05.690
 the main characters take this head 

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:08.300
 so and picked up something 

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:12.930
 because of this I can not take my head now 

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:18.050
 let's throw this thing out for her 

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:21.320
 a lot of money still do not get here 

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:21.320
 so guys 

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:29.100
 I hope this video helped you the rest 

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:31.110
 buying yourself on and hopefully look without 

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:33.630
 my help from these blocks is what's in them 

00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:35.640
 contained at least i showed you 

00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:38.730
 where is this wonderful 

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:43.010
 Easter egg thank you for watching 

00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:43.010
 This video until new meetings bye
