00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:11.960
 and if it's the winning girl on the cover 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:14.760
 from the pri magazine and yes she was pretty 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:16.290
 I'm going to make it up, I'm going to give it a 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.570
 bit fast because he always says that 

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:21.090
 I have a lot and it's going to be a makeup 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:24.540
 very simple as well as spring 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.310
 because they asked me to practice a 

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:28.980
 little bit about the trends that 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.349
 are fashionable that for luck all 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.270
 we are very easy to make up 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.020
 as it is fashionable but also fashion 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:39.310
 it lasts one month two months 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.310
 what color 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:57.899
 in the shade although it is little 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.600
 but it does not have anything of color it seems that 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:15.390
 I put nothing 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.520
 so do not be afraid to apply 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.330
 the color that I'm going to use frizz 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.330
 and later 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:27.720
 and say it's a gold sun golden sun 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:34.110
 because 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:36.799
 coffee is a very light flashes 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.799
 little 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:42.310
 that was here has the excess because no 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:42.310
 I want to see a lot 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.330
 there is a relax 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.229
 with an orange color 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:23.180
 how can you see the color is a little 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:27.049
 dark is an orange 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:31.010
 burned and I told them they have to 

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:34.400
 blur well that you do not see below the 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:36.560
 brow eyebrow that does not look much the 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:40.710
 contrast then 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:43.230
 lighter and coloration 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:45.020
 I need to be paralyzed because not all 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.830
 colors are left us behind 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:50.960
 this is this 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:54.410
 so it's a chat in ado yugar eve 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:56.140
 good satiny sugar 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:58.710
 let's 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.710
 blur 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.980
 the cancer is framed the stroke 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.909
 in the difference 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:27.170
 and the most important thing is that you do not see 

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:29.150
 much the difference that it does not look very 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:31.900
 marked up here 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:31.900
 we are more blurred 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.350
 here stuck 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:43.760
 as if it will be a streak 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.760
 also 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:59.530
 ok little 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:59.530
 and now as a brown pencil 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:06.250
 ah 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:10.590
 line in a lot too thin as if it were 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:10.590
 very close to the lashes 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:17.750
 make-up do not go anything charged because what 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:19.400
 that we are going to emphasize are the lips 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:21.700
 that we can not load both 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.700
 eyes 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.470
 down here it 's very important it's fine 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:32.169
 important in this type of makeup 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:34.710
 so let's emphasize the bottom part of 

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:34.710
 our eyes 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:41.910
 he has not loaded us either 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:41.910
 why are 

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:51.840
 well take the base the mosquera as 

00:04:49.309 --> 00:04:56.220
 burnt orange 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:58.820
 the excess looking up and over the 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:02.750
 coffee line that says it's a line of 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:02.750
 a pencil in cream 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:09.930
 and thin 

00:05:22.039 --> 00:05:28.580
 we have the strip of the eyelashes 

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:33.950
 the next step is going to focus 

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:36.830
 the lips you know if there is going to be a 

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:38.270
 little bit good rather pure wicks the 

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:43.780
 colors that are fashionable right now are 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:43.780
 the colors like fuchsia purple cherries 

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:49.530
 now with a lot of color then like your 

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:52.920
 very striking colors giving very 

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:56.430
 pretty and very much loaded 

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:59.210
 then I will put a purple color 

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:59.210
 I am going to try 

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:04.800
 how am I going to do it I do not know if the color 

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:06.500
 be beautiful the beautiful lips that 

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:08.570
 let's try 

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:11.590
 Priscilla's lips have makeup 

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:11.590
 so that it lasts longer 

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:21.230
 and my suggestion is to help 

00:06:21.969 --> 00:06:25.019
 in the chair 

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:29.030
 if it's beautiful with the truth 

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:44.110
 ready thanks to hurry and loved and I read that 

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:46.870
 They invited me from the magazine about how you 

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:49.390
 the lips in a hurry 

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:52.570
 and lipsticks of the English brand that is 

00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:55.050
 hard to get but you can if 

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:58.169
 you do not have a wife with grape colors 

00:06:55.050 --> 00:07:00.539
 then they go aa 

00:06:58.169 --> 00:07:03.749
 I do not know since frank I've seen them are very 

00:07:00.539 --> 00:07:08.360
 nice but it's like a grape so very 

00:07:03.749 --> 00:07:08.360
 powerful thank you very much and
