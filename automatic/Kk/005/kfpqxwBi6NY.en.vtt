and there you go

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.020 
and there you go
now<00:01:18.630> go<00:01:18.810> into<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.140> data<00:01:19.439> underscore<00:01:20.070> win<00:01:20.280> 64

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
now go into the data underscore win 64

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.580 
now go into the data underscore win 64
folder<00:01:21.450> and<00:01:21.689> then<00:01:21.869> you<00:01:21.900> should<00:01:22.049> see<00:01:22.320> a<00:01:22.350> bunch

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
folder and then you should see a bunch

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.370 
folder and then you should see a bunch
of<00:01:22.710> dot<00:01:22.950> dot<00:01:23.280> and<00:01:23.520> dot<00:01:23.759> fat<00:01:24.150> files<00:01:24.479> so<00:01:25.140> you<00:01:25.170> just

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
of dot dot and dot fat files so you just

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.770 
of dot dot and dot fat files so you just
want<00:01:25.500> to<00:01:25.560> paste<00:01:26.430> right<00:01:27.000> in<00:01:27.210> there<00:01:27.420> but<00:01:27.750> I

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
want to paste right in there but I

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.929 
want to paste right in there but I
already<00:01:28.020> have<00:01:28.680> that<00:01:28.920> as<00:01:29.189> you<00:01:29.340> can<00:01:29.460> see<00:01:29.729> and

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
already have that as you can see and

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.330 
already have that as you can see and
then<00:01:30.720> it<00:01:31.140> might<00:01:31.590> say<00:01:31.829> like<00:01:31.979> you<00:01:32.159> need

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
then it might say like you need

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.429 
then it might say like you need
permission<00:01:32.750> but<00:01:33.750> it<00:01:33.840> should<00:01:34.049> not<00:01:34.170> say

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
permission but it should not say

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.710 
permission but it should not say
anything<00:01:34.619> like<00:01:34.950> replace<00:01:35.520> files<00:01:35.909> if<00:01:36.299> there

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
anything like replace files if there

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.050 
anything like replace files if there
already<00:01:37.439> is<00:01:37.680> then<00:01:38.009> that<00:01:38.700> means<00:01:38.909> you've

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
already is then that means you've

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.999 
already is then that means you've
probably<00:01:39.180> already<00:01:39.420> installed<00:01:39.840> it<00:01:39.990> now<00:01:40.710> I'm

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
probably already installed it now I'm

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.700 
probably already installed it now I'm
pretty<00:01:41.520> sure<00:01:41.640> this<00:01:42.299> actually<00:01:42.750> works<00:01:43.290> but<00:01:43.560> it

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
pretty sure this actually works but it

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:44.870 
pretty sure this actually works but it
says<00:01:43.920> in<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.130> instructions<00:01:44.430> that<00:01:44.700> you<00:01:44.820> need

can't<00:02:36.960> show<00:02:37.230> you<00:02:37.260> the<00:02:37.410> game<00:02:37.770> but<00:02:38.010> I'm<00:02:38.130> sure

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
can't show you the game but I'm sure

you've<00:02:38.700> seen<00:02:38.730> other<00:02:39.240> videos<00:02:40.050> of<00:02:40.230> that<00:02:40.380> but

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
you've seen other videos of that but

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.470 
you've seen other videos of that but
once<00:02:40.920> you<00:02:41.100> do<00:02:41.280> that<00:02:41.310> you<00:02:41.670> can<00:02:41.820> just<00:02:42.030> launch<00:02:42.180> the

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
once you do that you can just launch the

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.690 
once you do that you can just launch the
game<00:02:42.630> and<00:02:42.870> it<00:02:43.470> theoretically<00:02:44.100> should<00:02:44.310> work<00:02:44.490> if

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
game and it theoretically should work if

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.180 
game and it theoretically should work if
it<00:02:44.820> doesn't<00:02:44.850> then<00:02:45.540> you<00:02:46.170> did<00:02:46.650> something<00:02:46.890> wrong

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
it doesn't then you did something wrong

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.000 
it doesn't then you did something wrong
