plastic and again this results in a case
that<00:01:58.680> does<00:01:58.920> a<00:01:58.950> really<00:01:59.369> good<00:01:59.610> job<00:01:59.670> of<00:02:00.149> absorbing

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
that does a really good job of absorbing

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.649 
that does a really good job of absorbing
both<00:02:01.020> shock<00:02:01.320> and<00:02:01.590> impact<00:02:02.189> now<00:02:03.119> when<00:02:03.360> I<00:02:03.390> first

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
both shock and impact now when I first

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.080 
both shock and impact now when I first
saw<00:02:03.869> this<00:02:04.049> case<00:02:04.320> at<00:02:04.530> CES<00:02:05.100> this<00:02:05.130> year<00:02:05.399> the

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
saw this case at CES this year the

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.639 
saw this case at CES this year the
person<00:02:06.570> that<00:02:06.750> showed<00:02:06.930> it<00:02:07.079> to<00:02:07.200> me<00:02:07.320> kind<00:02:07.560> of

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
person that showed it to me kind of

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.800 
person that showed it to me kind of
liking<00:02:08.009> this<00:02:08.129> design<00:02:08.520> to<00:02:08.819> the<00:02:08.849> crumple<00:02:09.539> zones

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
liking this design to the crumple zones

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.350 
liking this design to the crumple zones
of<00:02:10.050> a<00:02:10.200> car<00:02:10.590> once<00:02:11.280> your<00:02:11.430> iPhone<00:02:11.849> is<00:02:12.000> in<00:02:12.150> hair

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
of a car once your iPhone is in hair

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.020 
of a car once your iPhone is in hair
it's<00:02:12.510> kind<00:02:12.750> of<00:02:12.810> like<00:02:12.989> resting<00:02:13.830> in

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
it's kind of like resting in

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.570 
it's kind of like resting in
a cushion<00:02:14.480> of<00:02:14.569> air<00:02:14.870> and<00:02:15.200> if<00:02:15.950> you<00:02:16.100> were<00:02:16.220> to<00:02:16.280> drop

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
a cushion of air and if you were to drop

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.210 
a cushion of air and if you were to drop
it<00:02:16.850> you<00:02:17.209> know<00:02:17.300> the<00:02:17.420> case<00:02:17.660> will<00:02:18.080> kind<00:02:18.680> of<00:02:18.740> absorb

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
it you know the case will kind of absorb

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.780 
it you know the case will kind of absorb
the<00:02:19.459> bulk<00:02:19.880> of<00:02:20.060> the<00:02:20.270> impact<00:02:21.310> so<00:02:22.310> let's<00:02:22.490> get<00:02:22.640> the

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
the bulk of the impact so let's get the

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:24.850 
the bulk of the impact so let's get the
case<00:02:23.000> on<00:02:23.270> the<00:02:23.390> iphone<00:02:23.750> 4<00:02:24.020> you<00:02:24.200> do<00:02:24.380> have<00:02:24.530> to<00:02:24.650> take

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
case on the iphone 4 you do have to take

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.100 
case on the iphone 4 you do have to take
you<00:02:25.069> know<00:02:25.190> very<00:02:25.580> careful<00:02:26.180> note<00:02:26.780> when<00:02:26.990> you're

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
you know very careful note when you're

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:28.690 
you know very careful note when you're
putting<00:02:27.319> it<00:02:27.470> on<00:02:27.560> otherwise<00:02:28.160> you're<00:02:28.459> going<00:02:28.610> to

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
putting it on otherwise you're going to

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.790 
putting it on otherwise you're going to
end<00:02:28.790> up<00:02:29.000> with<00:02:29.180> a<00:02:29.209> bubbled<00:02:29.690> screen<00:02:30.050> shield<00:02:30.260> you

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:30.800 
end up with a bubbled screen shield you

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.020 
end up with a bubbled screen shield you
kind<00:02:31.010> of<00:02:31.069> have<00:02:31.190> to<00:02:31.220> make<00:02:31.459> sure<00:02:31.640> everything<00:02:32.000> is

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
kind of have to make sure everything is

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.900 
kind of have to make sure everything is
flat<00:02:32.390> make<00:02:32.930> sure<00:02:33.110> the<00:02:33.230> edges<00:02:33.380> rest<00:02:34.220> up<00:02:34.430> over

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
flat make sure the edges rest up over

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.750 
flat make sure the edges rest up over
onto<00:02:35.330> the<00:02:35.420> glass<00:02:36.080> and<00:02:36.470> then<00:02:36.890> slide<00:02:37.220> it<00:02:37.250> on<00:02:37.520> if

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
onto the glass and then slide it on if

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.340 
onto the glass and then slide it on if
you<00:02:38.150> do<00:02:38.300> that<00:02:38.480> and<00:02:38.720> you're<00:02:38.810> careful<00:02:39.110> you

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:39.350 
you do that and you're careful you

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:40.780 
you do that and you're careful you
shouldn't<00:02:39.680> have<00:02:39.770> a<00:02:39.800> problem<00:02:40.100> with<00:02:40.340> bubbling

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
shouldn't have a problem with bubbling

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.699 
shouldn't have a problem with bubbling
of<00:02:40.970> the<00:02:41.209> screen<00:02:41.480> shield<00:02:41.660> once<00:02:42.260> you<00:02:42.410> have<00:02:42.470> the

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:42.709 
of the screen shield once you have the

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:44.890 
of the screen shield once you have the
top<00:02:42.920> piece<00:02:43.220> on<00:02:43.459> simply<00:02:44.239> take<00:02:44.420> the<00:02:44.540> bottom

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
top piece on simply take the bottom

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.900 
top piece on simply take the bottom
piece<00:02:45.140> and<00:02:45.440> complete<00:02:46.340> the<00:02:46.489> installation

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
piece and complete the installation

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:49.060 
piece and complete the installation
process<00:02:47.239> just<00:02:47.930> like<00:02:48.080> you<00:02:48.290> did<00:02:48.470> with<00:02:48.709> the<00:02:48.860> top

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.070 
process just like you did with the top

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:50.650 
process just like you did with the top
now<00:02:49.550> you'll<00:02:49.760> see<00:02:49.970> there's<00:02:50.180> like<00:02:50.239> a<00:02:50.420> little

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
now you'll see there's like a little

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.110 
now you'll see there's like a little
tongue<00:02:51.050> and<00:02:51.260> groove<00:02:51.500> type<00:02:51.860> catch<00:02:52.489> on<00:02:52.760> the<00:02:52.940> back

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
tongue and groove type catch on the back

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.570 
tongue and groove type catch on the back
that<00:02:53.150> locks<00:02:53.720> the<00:02:53.900> two<00:02:54.140> pieces<00:02:54.350> together<00:02:54.650> once

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:55.580 
that locks the two pieces together once

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:57.250 
that locks the two pieces together once
it's<00:02:55.790> locked<00:02:56.000> in<00:02:56.239> place<00:02:56.269> it's<00:02:56.720> pretty<00:02:56.989> tight

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
it's locked in place it's pretty tight

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.250 
it's locked in place it's pretty tight
there's<00:02:57.500> a<00:02:57.560> small<00:02:58.250> ever<00:02:58.640> so<00:02:59.090> small<00:02:59.450> amount<00:03:00.140> of

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
there's a small ever so small amount of

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.140 
there's a small ever so small amount of
movement<00:03:00.560> there<00:03:01.040> but<00:03:01.550> that's<00:03:01.760> what<00:03:01.940> kind<00:03:02.120> of

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
movement there but that's what kind of

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.090 
movement there but that's what kind of
allows<00:03:02.360> you<00:03:02.540> to<00:03:02.690> break<00:03:03.019> the<00:03:03.200> case<00:03:03.530> apart<00:03:03.950> when

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100 
allows you to break the case apart when

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:05.949 
allows you to break the case apart when
it<00:03:04.220> comes<00:03:04.430> to<00:03:04.640> open<00:03:05.000> it<00:03:05.090> it's<00:03:05.450> not<00:03:05.720> going<00:03:05.870> to

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:05.959 
it comes to open it it's not going to

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:07.420 
it comes to open it it's not going to
come<00:03:06.080> apart<00:03:06.410> unless<00:03:06.590> you<00:03:06.830> want<00:03:07.130> it<00:03:07.160> to<00:03:07.220> come

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
come apart unless you want it to come

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.490 
come apart unless you want it to come
apart<00:03:08.150> and<00:03:08.300> that's<00:03:08.690> the<00:03:08.870> most<00:03:09.019> important

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
apart and that's the most important

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.740 
apart and that's the most important
thing<00:03:09.530> to<00:03:09.650> consider<00:03:09.860> so<00:03:10.850> as<00:03:11.000> far<00:03:11.030> as<00:03:11.269> the<00:03:11.480> front

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
thing to consider so as far as the front

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:13.600 
thing to consider so as far as the front
goes<00:03:11.959> you<00:03:12.200> do<00:03:12.350> get<00:03:12.530> a<00:03:12.560> good<00:03:12.860> amount<00:03:12.980> of<00:03:13.250> lay<00:03:13.489> on

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:13.610 
goes you do get a good amount of lay on

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:15.160 
goes you do get a good amount of lay on
the<00:03:13.700> table<00:03:13.730> design<00:03:14.360> you<00:03:14.569> can<00:03:14.720> see<00:03:14.870> the<00:03:14.989> case

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170 
the table design you can see the case

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:17.710 
the table design you can see the case
comes<00:03:15.470> up<00:03:15.650> over<00:03:15.800> onto<00:03:16.310> the<00:03:16.400> glass<00:03:16.580> it<00:03:17.120> comes

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
comes up over onto the glass it comes

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.229 
comes up over onto the glass it comes
together<00:03:17.900> quite<00:03:18.320> nicely<00:03:18.640> there's<00:03:19.640> no<00:03:19.820> space

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:20.239 
together quite nicely there's no space

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:22.270 
together quite nicely there's no space
or<00:03:20.540> anything<00:03:20.840> like<00:03:20.870> that<00:03:21.019> in<00:03:21.470> between<00:03:21.620> the

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
or anything like that in between the

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:25.060 
or anything like that in between the
case<00:03:22.640> itself<00:03:23.120> you<00:03:23.720> can<00:03:23.750> see<00:03:24.049> that<00:03:24.079> every<00:03:24.890> once

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:25.070 
case itself you can see that every once

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:26.680 
case itself you can see that every once
in<00:03:25.220> a<00:03:25.250> while<00:03:25.400> my<00:03:25.640> screen<00:03:25.970> shield<00:03:26.120> did<00:03:26.360> kind<00:03:26.600> of

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
in a while my screen shield did kind of

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:29.050 
in a while my screen shield did kind of
bubble<00:03:27.049> up<00:03:27.200> but<00:03:27.470> most<00:03:28.100> of<00:03:28.280> the<00:03:28.370> time<00:03:28.579> it<00:03:28.790> was

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
bubble up but most of the time it was

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.229 
bubble up but most of the time it was
hidden<00:03:29.630> underneath<00:03:30.140> the<00:03:30.590> lip<00:03:31.010> of<00:03:31.160> the<00:03:31.250> case<00:03:31.610> so

00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:32.239 
hidden underneath the lip of the case so

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:33.819 
hidden underneath the lip of the case so
again<00:03:32.600> really<00:03:32.810> not<00:03:32.989> a<00:03:33.019> problem<00:03:33.110> you<00:03:33.500> just<00:03:33.530> need

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:33.829 
again really not a problem you just need

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:35.650 
again really not a problem you just need
to<00:03:33.890> take<00:03:34.070> careful<00:03:34.430> note<00:03:34.790> when<00:03:35.239> you<00:03:35.360> put<00:03:35.540> this

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660 
to take careful note when you put this

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:37.930 
to take careful note when you put this
on<00:03:35.900> or<00:03:36.440> you<00:03:36.650> will<00:03:36.829> end<00:03:36.890> up<00:03:37.220> with<00:03:37.280> bubbles<00:03:37.760> with

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940 
on or you will end up with bubbles with

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:39.970 
on or you will end up with bubbles with
