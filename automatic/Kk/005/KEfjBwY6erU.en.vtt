00:00:07.429 --> 00:00:12.090
 hi to all the boys and welcome back up 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.340
 average on the server or since we have 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.049
 open the channel with more or less expiration 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.699
 regular comments have arrived 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.970
 private messages that played more or 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:25.740
 the less you guys will ever play a game of 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:27.300
 that is, we have motor racing 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.380
 we have played titles in the past 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.050
 important 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:34.020
 let's remember some total worlds in the file 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.590
 drift two is very nice really nice 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:41.190
 instead the trilogy of morsy line runs 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:43.290
 justified in those 12 the last goes well 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.960
 boys is not our genre in short 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.090
 we don't like racing so much 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.680
 however, however, on karma he revels 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.170
 destruction derby we go a lot 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.690
 agree exactly where it comes from 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.250
 explodes to blow up cars please 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.530
 we have been enjoying ourselves for years 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.359
 a lot and that's why and why 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.399
 this really struck us a lot 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.870
 this small little small technique 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.790
 a small cock in the sense that it is a 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.820
 taste, however, it is a tech demo that you 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:11.100
 call bim angie drive already knows what 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.130
 we can do a tech demo or concern 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.630
 this graphic engine and not because it is 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.880
 especially focused on cars 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.979
 on physics some on the physics of the 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.740
 cars for where we can do 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.060
 travel this this car up 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.650
 different routes 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.950
 but be careful because we could do it 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:32.430
 collide with several different usual ones 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:35.040
 within this tech demo every e 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.780
 I say every blow the car will take 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.540
 will be different from the previous one 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.579
 exact do not exist written is not that if 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.210
 I take a wall from me at a hundred 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:46.060
 the door starts 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:48.820
 really guys it's all so real 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.740
 that you will never get used to doing the 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.930
 right thing at the right time having the 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.729
 same reaction the car really 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:56.680
 reacts extremely 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:57.310
 realistic both to the stresses of the 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.750
 ground 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.759
 here he was caught wearing a hundred per hour 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:03.190
 with the cock that jumped and came back in 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:06.159
 the axle shaft splits off the road 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:08.619
 or the boys muffler is released 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:10.690
 Ã¨ is something that has made us come 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:12.489
 immediately in mind one thing that is but if 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:15.670
 take a gta with this one 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:17.350
 destructibility and there would be second 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.060
 me two schools of thought 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:20.320
 the first is that of the purists we do 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.700
 I want to have fun I want to fuck 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:24.489
 Fuck off my car 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.890
 every 5 minutes and the second and those that 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:28.450
 they want to put gasoline in it gta 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.870
 It is not there is a strand of the 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.760
 of the gas station they will do as they would be 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.400
 happy for this thing because 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.230
 put that to the minis you have consumed the oil 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.880
 of the engine car burns out 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.980
 you don't have to take one 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:44.230
 obviously we care about all this 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.780
 relatively but but it came to mind 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:48.820
 that if you play at a battlefield you are the 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.489
 our tank and our investigations 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:54.610
 could suffer this damage would be 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:57.760
 really very very cool this 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:03:02.230
 let's say this this graphic engine e 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:04.299
 did not satisfy us on several points 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.570
 although there are obviously bugs of 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:10.030
 steering flight that sometimes gets stuck 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:12.579
 but we must say that it is really the 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:14.739
 barrel are really realistic if the 

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:16.840
 machine relationship and it really is 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:18.790
 beautiful imagine that it is not 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:21.670
 only of destructibility therefore of 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:23.620
 dynamic change of the match but if you 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:25.810
 break the fender and that remains 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.980
 attached to the car for a while and 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.629
 fender will have 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.159
 a very very realistic vibration 

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:33.220
 like it was the car it really was 

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:35.650
 composed of sheets is really and almost 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.480
 real look even even the wheels are 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:39.519
 made from different polygons that you can 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:42.010
 spoil so they can explode and not 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:43.870
 work more like a locked role 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:46.180
 right of the car or you can't 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:48.790
 more rotate to the right or left ie 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:50.410
 these are things that are pleasing 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:52.599
 they are very very pleased 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:54.519
 then consider that this tech demo a a 

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:56.349
 his own way and also a lot of fun because 

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:58.060
 this big track that is put to us 

00:03:56.349 --> 00:04:00.519
 provision is nothing but a kind 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:02.500
 of playground with trampolines with 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:04.900
 of the tunnels like so many objects 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.480
 against which to go and crash because 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.590
 that's the point and then if you are 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:11.230
 We are passionate about tech demos 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:13.510
 you will see how the car looks like 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:15.579
 the landscape is composed in short but all 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:19.479
 the polygons you can see the strength of 

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:21.750
 how it affects the crisis is felt 

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:24.070
 the up is therefore all the boys 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:26.110
 try to download many free 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:28.389
 we also put the link below either 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:30.310
 to go see the trailer they have 

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:32.560
 entered the boys on their channel 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:34.990
 youtube is to go to download 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:36.970
 directly the tech demo and try it is 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:39.610
 a tech demo that probably when 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:41.740
 you will download this version will be 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:44.340
 already updated maybe because it is in 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:44.340
 constant evolution
