you have perfectly straight and you can
change<00:02:08.819> it<00:02:08.940> to<00:02:08.970> degrees

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 
change it to degrees

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:14.500 
change it to degrees
or<00:02:12.140> to<00:02:12.470> the<00:02:12.500> bubble<00:02:12.970> so<00:02:13.970> then<00:02:14.120> you<00:02:14.210> can<00:02:14.330> use<00:02:14.480> it

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
or to the bubble so then you can use it

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.990 
or to the bubble so then you can use it
as<00:02:14.780> something<00:02:15.290> like<00:02:15.440> this<00:02:15.680> you<00:02:16.640> know<00:02:16.730> have<00:02:16.880> the

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
as something like this you know have the

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.890 
as something like this you know have the
little<00:02:17.180> bubble<00:02:17.840> like<00:02:18.470> one<00:02:18.680> of<00:02:18.710> those<00:02:18.860> measures

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
little bubble like one of those measures

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.740 
little bubble like one of those measures
so<00:02:21.400> you<00:02:22.400> can<00:02:22.580> have<00:02:22.700> perfectly<00:02:23.210> straight<00:02:23.570> like

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
so you can have perfectly straight like

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.690 
so you can have perfectly straight like
that<00:02:23.780> so<00:02:24.650> anyway<00:02:24.920> that's<00:02:25.040> pretty<00:02:25.340> cool<00:02:25.520> and

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
that so anyway that's pretty cool and

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.390 
that so anyway that's pretty cool and
that's<00:02:25.910> all<00:02:26.210> in<00:02:26.420> the<00:02:26.510> nine<00:02:26.720> toolbox<00:02:27.400> so

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
that's all in the nine toolbox so

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.060 
that's all in the nine toolbox so
another<00:02:28.580> thing<00:02:28.700> is<00:02:28.910> a<00:02:28.940> loan<00:02:29.270> calculator<00:02:30.070> you

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:05.900 
have the brightness down low so you can

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:08.170 
have the brightness down low so you can

see it well on the camera but i

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:11.140 
see it well on the camera but i
recommend<00:04:08.600> raising<00:04:09.440> the<00:04:09.620> brightness<00:04:10.000> so<00:04:11.000> that

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
recommend raising the brightness so that

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:12.340 
recommend raising the brightness so that
way<00:04:11.239> you<00:04:11.330> can<00:04:11.450> get<00:04:11.570> the<00:04:11.630> bright<00:04:11.810> as<00:04:11.900> possible

of<00:04:59.130> a<00:04:59.220> second<00:04:59.610> so<00:05:00.450> that's<00:05:00.600> pretty<00:05:00.750> cool<00:05:00.840> right

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:00.990

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:08.040 
you can change the color and just play

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:09.860 
you can change the color and just play
around<00:05:08.160> with<00:05:08.430> it<00:05:08.460> but<00:05:09.210> the<00:05:09.300> fact<00:05:09.510> that<00:05:09.570> you<00:05:09.690> can
