when I first heard about it and first
saw<00:00:37.140> this<00:00:37.290> gorgeous<00:00:37.469> cover<00:00:37.829> this<00:00:38.430> is<00:00:38.579> the

of<00:00:44.280> two<00:00:44.640> very<00:00:44.940> famous<00:00:45.149> scientists<00:00:46.140> who<00:00:46.320> have

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
of two very famous scientists who have

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.760 
of two very famous scientists who have
developed<00:00:46.890> a<00:00:46.980> way<00:00:47.190> to<00:00:47.789> jump<00:00:48.059> between

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:48.770 
developed a way to jump between

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:51.439 
developed a way to jump between
universes<00:00:49.800> so<00:00:50.129> basically<00:00:50.760> in<00:00:51.059> this<00:00:51.210> story

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
universes so basically in this story

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:52.819 
universes so basically in this story
there<00:00:51.600> are<00:00:51.719> a<00:00:51.750> bunch<00:00:51.930> of<00:00:52.020> parallel<00:00:52.440> universes

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
there are a bunch of parallel universes

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.410 
there are a bunch of parallel universes
it's<00:00:53.070> based<00:00:53.250> on<00:00:53.399> string<00:00:53.760> theory<00:00:54.030> which<00:00:54.180> is<00:00:54.329> an

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
it's based on string theory which is an

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.450 
it's based on string theory which is an
actual<00:00:54.719> theory<00:00:55.199> but<00:00:55.379> I'm<00:00:55.530> not<00:00:55.710> a<00:00:55.770> scientist<00:00:56.309> I

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
actual theory but I'm not a scientist I

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.119 
actual theory but I'm not a scientist I
have<00:00:56.489> no<00:00:56.820> idea<00:00:57.149> about<00:00:57.719> any<00:00:58.050> of<00:00:58.140> that<00:00:58.230> but<00:00:58.739> it<00:00:59.070> is

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
have no idea about any of that but it is

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.950 
have no idea about any of that but it is
based<00:00:59.640> on<00:00:59.820> something<00:01:00.090> that<00:01:00.239> is<00:01:00.390> kind<00:01:00.780> of

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
based on something that is kind of

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.779 
based on something that is kind of
scientifically<00:01:01.500> being<00:01:01.800> studied<00:01:02.219> in<00:01:02.489> a<00:01:02.609> way

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
scientifically being studied in a way

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.270 
scientifically being studied in a way
but<00:01:03.210> basically<00:01:03.690> her<00:01:04.170> parents<00:01:04.589> have<00:01:04.799> developed

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
but basically her parents have developed

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.800 
but basically her parents have developed
a<00:01:05.339> device<00:01:05.369> that<00:01:05.970> you<00:01:06.060> wear<00:01:06.240> around<00:01:06.420> your<00:01:06.540> neck

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
a device that you wear around your neck

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.600 
a device that you wear around your neck
and<00:01:06.990> that<00:01:07.350> device<00:01:07.680> which<00:01:08.130> is<00:01:08.280> called<00:01:08.460> the

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
and that device which is called the

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.600 
and that device which is called the
Firebird<00:01:09.119> allows<00:01:09.840> you<00:01:10.080> to<00:01:10.229> go<00:01:10.380> between

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:10.610 
Firebird allows you to go between

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:12.590 
Firebird allows you to go between
universes<00:01:11.610> and<00:01:12.000> if<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.270> parallel<00:01:12.570> universe

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
universes and if the parallel universe

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.480 
universes and if the parallel universe
is<00:01:12.930> in<00:01:13.049> this<00:01:13.200> story<00:01:13.380> you<00:01:13.530> are<00:01:13.710> not<00:01:13.860> jumping<00:01:14.130> in

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
is in this story you are not jumping in

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.030 
is in this story you are not jumping in
time<00:01:15.030> at<00:01:15.360> all<00:01:15.540> you<00:01:15.780> remain<00:01:16.080> in<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:16.350> same<00:01:16.530> year

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
time at all you remain in the same year

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.859 
time at all you remain in the same year
in<00:01:17.250> each<00:01:17.460> universe<00:01:17.970> but<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.390> years<00:01:18.659> could

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
in each universe but the years could

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.200 
in each universe but the years could
look<00:01:19.049> vastly<00:01:19.290> different<00:01:19.920> because<00:01:20.189> any<00:01:20.520> choice

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
look vastly different because any choice

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.170 
look vastly different because any choice
that<00:01:21.450> anybody<00:01:21.840> makes<00:01:22.140> changes<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.610> universe

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
that anybody makes changes the universe

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.929 
that anybody makes changes the universe
there<00:01:24.600> are<00:01:24.630> literally<00:01:24.960> millions<00:01:25.939> gazillions

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
there are literally millions gazillions

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.420 
there are literally millions gazillions
of<00:01:27.150> universe<00:01:27.600> potentials<00:01:28.380> there's<00:01:28.860> something

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
of universe potentials there's something

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.069 
of universe potentials there's something
as<00:01:29.549> simple<00:01:29.729> as<00:01:30.000> you're<00:01:30.509> wearing<00:01:30.630> a<00:01:30.810> pink<00:01:30.990> shirt

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
as simple as you're wearing a pink shirt

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.020 
as simple as you're wearing a pink shirt
in<00:01:31.409> your<00:01:31.560> universe<00:01:31.890> and<00:01:32.130> a<00:01:32.189> blue<00:01:32.400> shirt<00:01:32.610> and<00:01:32.670> a

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
in your universe and a blue shirt and a

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.460 
in your universe and a blue shirt and a
different<00:01:33.390> universe<00:01:33.689> or<00:01:33.960> can<00:01:34.170> be<00:01:34.290> something

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
different universe or can be something

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.880 
different universe or can be something
crazy<00:01:34.680> like<00:01:34.979> you're<00:01:35.700> 20<00:01:36.240> years<00:01:36.390> in<00:01:36.689> the<00:01:36.780> future

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
crazy like you're 20 years in the future

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:38.810 
crazy like you're 20 years in the future
technologically<00:01:37.890> in<00:01:38.070> this<00:01:38.250> universe<00:01:38.610> but

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
technologically in this universe but

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.340 
technologically in this universe but
you're<00:01:38.939> back<00:01:39.090> in<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.329> 1800s<00:01:40.049> in<00:01:40.200> that

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
you're back in the 1800s in that

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.649 
you're back in the 1800s in that
universe<00:01:40.770> as<00:01:41.009> far<00:01:41.280> as<00:01:41.369> technologically<00:01:42.150> stuff

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
universe as far as technologically stuff

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.270 
universe as far as technologically stuff
but<00:01:42.899> you're<00:01:42.960> still<00:01:43.110> in<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:43.290> same<00:01:43.350> year<00:01:43.740> it

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
but you're still in the same year it

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.130 
but you're still in the same year it
sounds<00:01:44.579> kind<00:01:44.759> of<00:01:44.850> confusing<00:01:45.030> I'm<00:01:45.720> probably

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
sounds kind of confusing I'm probably

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.870 
sounds kind of confusing I'm probably
not<00:01:46.320> explaining<00:01:46.770> it<00:01:46.860> as<00:01:46.920> well<00:01:47.070> as<00:01:47.159> I<00:01:47.280> could<00:01:47.549> but

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
not explaining it as well as I could but

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.780 
not explaining it as well as I could but
it<00:01:48.149> makes<00:01:48.659> sense<00:01:48.810> in<00:01:49.229> here<00:01:49.340> and<00:01:50.340> at<00:01:50.700> the

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
it makes sense in here and at the

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.069 
it makes sense in here and at the
beginning<00:01:51.060> of<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:51.180> story<00:01:51.390> we<00:01:51.600> learned<00:01:51.840> that

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
beginning of the story we learned that

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.410 
beginning of the story we learned that
Marguerite's<00:01:52.649> father<00:01:52.979> has<00:01:53.340> been<00:01:53.520> murdered<00:01:53.759> by

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
Marguerite's father has been murdered by

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.480 
Marguerite's father has been murdered by
one<00:01:54.630> of<00:01:54.689> her<00:01:55.079> parents<00:01:55.500> grad<00:01:55.770> students<00:01:56.189> and<00:01:56.310> the

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
one of her parents grad students and the

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.780 
one of her parents grad students and the
grad<00:01:56.700> student<00:01:57.119> ran<00:01:57.600> into<00:01:58.229> the<00:01:58.890> another

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
grad student ran into the another

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.789 
grad student ran into the another
parallel<00:02:00.180> universe<00:02:00.600> in<00:02:00.780> order<00:02:00.930> to<00:02:01.140> escape<00:02:01.590> and

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
parallel universe in order to escape and

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.030 
parallel universe in order to escape and
so<00:02:02.219> her<00:02:02.909> and<00:02:03.240> another<00:02:03.689> grad<00:02:04.020> student<00:02:04.469> have

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
so her and another grad student have

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.609 
so her and another grad student have
followed<00:02:05.579> him<00:02:05.729> in<00:02:05.969> and<00:02:06.240> are<00:02:06.990> trying<00:02:07.229> to<00:02:07.409> track

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
followed him in and are trying to track

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.589 
followed him in and are trying to track
him<00:02:07.799> down<00:02:07.860> and<00:02:08.280> that's<00:02:08.910> how<00:02:09.090> the<00:02:09.149> story<00:02:09.360> kind

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
him down and that's how the story kind

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.330 
him down and that's how the story kind
of<00:02:09.720> unfolds<00:02:10.229> so<00:02:10.619> let<00:02:10.739> me<00:02:10.800> first<00:02:10.979> start<00:02:11.160> with

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
of unfolds so let me first start with

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.140 
of unfolds so let me first start with
the<00:02:11.550> world<00:02:11.879> I've<00:02:12.180> already<00:02:12.629> caught<00:02:12.780> up

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
the world I've already caught up

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.059 
the world I've already caught up
that<00:02:13.390> but<00:02:13.599> the<00:02:13.780> whole<00:02:14.019> concept<00:02:14.349> of<00:02:14.860> the

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:15.069 
that but the whole concept of the

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:17.069 
that but the whole concept of the
parallel<00:02:15.519> universes<00:02:15.970> and<00:02:16.299> how<00:02:16.689> they<00:02:16.810> can<00:02:16.930> be

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:17.079 
parallel universes and how they can be

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:19.619 
parallel universes and how they can be
similar<00:02:17.470> or<00:02:17.680> different<00:02:18.129> or<00:02:18.489> anything<00:02:19.150> they

00:02:19.619 --> 00:02:19.629 
similar or different or anything they

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:22.530 
similar or different or anything they
can<00:02:19.810> literally<00:02:20.140> be<00:02:20.409> anything<00:02:21.010> it<00:02:21.579> is<00:02:22.120> such<00:02:22.510> a

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
can literally be anything it is such a

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.619 
can literally be anything it is such a
cool<00:02:22.989> concept<00:02:23.590> and<00:02:24.189> each<00:02:24.519> different<00:02:25.329> universe

00:02:25.619 --> 00:02:25.629 
cool concept and each different universe

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:26.789 
cool concept and each different universe
that<00:02:25.780> you<00:02:25.840> get<00:02:26.019> to<00:02:26.110> experience<00:02:26.439> with<00:02:26.680> them

00:02:26.789 --> 00:02:26.799 
that you get to experience with them

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:28.949 
that you get to experience with them
even<00:02:26.980> this<00:02:27.310> book<00:02:27.519> is<00:02:27.730> vastly<00:02:28.420> different<00:02:28.810> has

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
even this book is vastly different has

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:30.360 
even this book is vastly different has
its<00:02:29.110> own<00:02:29.200> feeling<00:02:29.680> and<00:02:29.859> you<00:02:29.920> do<00:02:30.129> get<00:02:30.280> a<00:02:30.310> sense

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
its own feeling and you do get a sense

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.910 
its own feeling and you do get a sense
that<00:02:30.700> each<00:02:30.970> one<00:02:31.299> they<00:02:31.480> do<00:02:31.540> jump<00:02:31.959> into<00:02:32.260> I'm<00:02:32.650> also

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
that each one they do jump into I'm also

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.380 
that each one they do jump into I'm also
really<00:02:33.340> interested<00:02:33.760> to<00:02:33.790> see<00:02:33.879> the<00:02:34.150> future

really interested to see the future
universes<00:02:34.959> that<00:02:34.989> pop<00:02:35.230> up<00:02:35.409> in<00:02:35.530> the<00:02:35.650> rest<00:02:35.890> of<00:02:36.010> the

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:36.099 
universes that pop up in the rest of the

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:38.429 
universes that pop up in the rest of the
series<00:02:36.459> because<00:02:36.819> within<00:02:37.720> this<00:02:37.989> book<00:02:38.200> there's

00:02:38.429 --> 00:02:38.439 
series because within this book there's

00:02:38.439 --> 00:02:39.839 
series because within this book there's
already<00:02:38.620> so<00:02:39.069> many<00:02:39.250> different<00:02:39.549> ones<00:02:39.609> that<00:02:39.790> they

00:02:39.839 --> 00:02:39.849 
already so many different ones that they

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:42.089 
already so many different ones that they
jump<00:02:40.030> into<00:02:40.359> and<00:02:40.629> the<00:02:41.200> next<00:02:41.530> books<00:02:41.739> I'm<00:02:41.950> sure

00:02:42.089 --> 00:02:42.099 
jump into and the next books I'm sure

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:43.319 
jump into and the next books I'm sure
there's<00:02:42.250> gonna<00:02:42.370> be<00:02:42.489> even<00:02:42.730> more<00:02:42.760> and<00:02:43.269> I'm

really excited to see all of those

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:47.369 
really excited to see all of those
different<00:02:45.340> places<00:02:45.700> and<00:02:46.030> how<00:02:46.209> those<00:02:46.870> feel<00:02:47.200> and

00:02:47.369 --> 00:02:47.379 
different places and how those feel and

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:49.500 
different places and how those feel and
how<00:02:47.470> those<00:02:47.650> places<00:02:47.920> unfold<00:02:48.370> next<00:02:49.209> let<00:02:49.329> me<00:02:49.359> talk

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
how those places unfold next let me talk

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.300 
how those places unfold next let me talk
about<00:02:49.540> the<00:02:49.780> characters<00:02:50.290> I<00:02:50.560> will<00:02:50.889> say<00:02:51.069> that<00:02:51.280> I

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
about the characters I will say that I

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.160 
about the characters I will say that I
had<00:02:51.549> a<00:02:51.609> really<00:02:51.909> hard<00:02:52.090> time<00:02:52.239> connecting<00:02:52.900> to<00:02:53.019> any

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
had a really hard time connecting to any

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:55.050 
had a really hard time connecting to any
of<00:02:53.379> the<00:02:53.470> characters<00:02:53.859> in<00:02:53.980> this<00:02:54.069> story<00:02:54.400> I<00:02:54.639> think

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
of the characters in this story I think

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:56.729 
of the characters in this story I think
the<00:02:55.180> reason<00:02:55.540> was<00:02:55.720> that<00:02:56.019> within<00:02:56.200> every

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:56.739 
the reason was that within every

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:59.550 
the reason was that within every
universe<00:02:57.220> all<00:02:57.670> the<00:02:57.730> characters<00:02:58.629> are<00:02:58.900> a<00:02:58.959> little

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
universe all the characters are a little

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.860 
universe all the characters are a little
bit<00:02:59.920> different<00:03:00.760> they<00:03:01.239> are<00:03:01.389> the<00:03:01.599> same<00:03:01.840> but

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
bit different they are the same but

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:03.869 
bit different they are the same but
they're<00:03:02.319> they're<00:03:02.739> different<00:03:03.280> and<00:03:03.459> it's<00:03:03.609> just

00:03:03.869 --> 00:03:03.879 
they're they're different and it's just

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:05.879 
they're they're different and it's just
it's<00:03:04.239> hard<00:03:04.450> to<00:03:04.599> kind<00:03:04.810> of<00:03:04.930> get<00:03:05.109> a<00:03:05.139> feeling<00:03:05.500> for

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:05.889 
it's hard to kind of get a feeling for

00:03:05.889 --> 00:03:07.979 
it's hard to kind of get a feeling for
any<00:03:06.099> of<00:03:06.250> them<00:03:06.459> even<00:03:07.209> the<00:03:07.299> main<00:03:07.450> character<00:03:07.870> who

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:07.989 
any of them even the main character who

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:09.599 
any of them even the main character who
remains<00:03:08.319> kind<00:03:08.590> of<00:03:08.769> the<00:03:08.980> same<00:03:09.189> throughout

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:09.609 
remains kind of the same throughout

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:11.069 
remains kind of the same throughout
because<00:03:09.849> she's<00:03:10.150> the<00:03:10.269> one<00:03:10.389> kind<00:03:10.540> of<00:03:10.659> traveling

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:11.079 
because she's the one kind of traveling

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:12.720 
because she's the one kind of traveling
throughout<00:03:11.290> these<00:03:11.470> universes<00:03:12.010> you<00:03:12.220> just

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
throughout these universes you just

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.599 
throughout these universes you just
don't<00:03:13.269> get<00:03:13.569> a<00:03:13.629> real<00:03:13.959> sense<00:03:14.290> of<00:03:14.590> all<00:03:15.069> of<00:03:15.129> them

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:15.609 
don't get a real sense of all of them

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:17.640 
don't get a real sense of all of them
because<00:03:15.730> they're<00:03:16.030> kind<00:03:16.209> of<00:03:16.299> ever-changing<00:03:16.650> so

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
because they're kind of ever-changing so

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:19.020 
because they're kind of ever-changing so
I<00:03:17.680> had<00:03:17.799> a<00:03:17.829> really<00:03:18.040> hard<00:03:18.069> time<00:03:18.310> connecting<00:03:18.790> to

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
I had a really hard time connecting to

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:20.849 
I had a really hard time connecting to
any<00:03:19.150> of<00:03:19.329> them<00:03:19.480> also<00:03:20.199> while<00:03:20.410> there<00:03:20.530> is<00:03:20.680> no

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:20.859 
any of them also while there is no

00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:22.650 
any of them also while there is no
instil<00:03:21.310> of<00:03:21.430> which<00:03:21.609> is<00:03:21.730> awesome<00:03:22.209> because<00:03:22.359> all

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
instil of which is awesome because all

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:23.789 
instil of which is awesome because all
the<00:03:22.810> characters<00:03:23.169> have<00:03:23.349> known<00:03:23.530> each<00:03:23.620> other<00:03:23.680> for

00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:23.799 
the characters have known each other for

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:25.740 
the characters have known each other for
a<00:03:23.980> long<00:03:24.129> time<00:03:24.370> and<00:03:24.730> they<00:03:25.389> all<00:03:25.569> have

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
a long time and they all have

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.509 
a long time and they all have
relationships<00:03:25.870> from<00:03:26.410> before<00:03:26.739> you<00:03:26.889> even<00:03:27.099> meet

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:27.519 
relationships from before you even meet

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:29.069 
relationships from before you even meet
them<00:03:27.639> in<00:03:27.790> the<00:03:27.849> story<00:03:28.150> but<00:03:28.540> there<00:03:28.629> is<00:03:28.810> a<00:03:28.840> little

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:29.079 
them in the story but there is a little

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:30.930 
them in the story but there is a little
bit<00:03:29.290> of<00:03:29.409> a<00:03:29.470> love<00:03:29.709> triangle<00:03:30.010> I<00:03:30.459> hesitate<00:03:30.909> to

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
bit of a love triangle I hesitate to

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.030 
bit of a love triangle I hesitate to
even<00:03:31.120> call<00:03:31.449> it<00:03:31.569> a<00:03:31.629> love<00:03:31.780> triangle<00:03:32.049> basically

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
even call it a love triangle basically

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.349 
even call it a love triangle basically
there's<00:03:33.220> two<00:03:33.280> guys<00:03:33.579> that<00:03:33.639> like<00:03:34.060> the<00:03:34.180> main

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:34.359 
there's two guys that like the main

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:36.750 
there's two guys that like the main
character<00:03:34.599> and<00:03:35.169> yeah<00:03:36.040> but<00:03:36.280> it<00:03:36.430> was<00:03:36.609> one<00:03:36.730> of

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
character and yeah but it was one of

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.189 
character and yeah but it was one of
those<00:03:36.909> love<00:03:37.060> triangles<00:03:37.540> where<00:03:37.750> the<00:03:37.989> main

00:03:38.189 --> 00:03:38.199 
those love triangles where the main

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:40.589 
those love triangles where the main
character<00:03:38.560> obviously<00:03:38.709> likes<00:03:39.370> one<00:03:40.150> more<00:03:40.449> than

00:03:40.589 --> 00:03:40.599 
character obviously likes one more than

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:41.939 
character obviously likes one more than
the<00:03:40.690> other<00:03:40.870> and<00:03:41.199> is<00:03:41.319> already<00:03:41.500> kind<00:03:41.859> of

00:03:41.939 --> 00:03:41.949 
the other and is already kind of

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:44.399 
the other and is already kind of
choosing<00:03:42.489> that<00:03:42.790> one<00:03:43.090> so<00:03:43.870> it<00:03:43.959> feels<00:03:44.079> like<00:03:44.169> kind

00:03:44.399 --> 00:03:44.409 
choosing that one so it feels like kind

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:45.659 
choosing that one so it feels like kind
of<00:03:44.470> a<00:03:44.560> waste<00:03:44.739> I<00:03:45.040> feel<00:03:45.190> like<00:03:45.310> the<00:03:45.370> whole<00:03:45.489> love

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:45.669 
of a waste I feel like the whole love

00:03:45.669 --> 00:03:46.770 
of a waste I feel like the whole love
triangle<00:03:46.000> thing<00:03:46.120> we<00:03:46.209> brought<00:03:46.329> up<00:03:46.449> in<00:03:46.569> the<00:03:46.629> rest

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
triangle thing we brought up in the rest

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:48.030 
triangle thing we brought up in the rest
of<00:03:46.870> the<00:03:46.959> books<00:03:47.109> but<00:03:47.290> I<00:03:47.319> feel<00:03:47.650> like<00:03:47.769> it's<00:03:47.919> just

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
of the books but I feel like it's just

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.520 
of the books but I feel like it's just
kind<00:03:48.190> of<00:03:48.340> not<00:03:49.000> necessary<00:03:49.780> and<00:03:50.109> we<00:03:50.199> could<00:03:50.349> kind

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
kind of not necessary and we could kind

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:52.140 
kind of not necessary and we could kind
of<00:03:50.650> cut<00:03:50.859> out<00:03:50.889> the<00:03:51.069> whole<00:03:51.370> love<00:03:51.579> triangle<00:03:51.970> part

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
of cut out the whole love triangle part

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:53.250 
of cut out the whole love triangle part
and<00:03:52.299> just<00:03:52.389> have<00:03:52.629> it<00:03:52.659> be<00:03:52.900> a<00:03:52.930> romantic

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.260 
and just have it be a romantic

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.439 
and just have it be a romantic
connection<00:03:53.620> with<00:03:53.919> the<00:03:54.069> one<00:03:54.370> but<00:03:55.000> maybe<00:03:55.209> it

00:03:55.439 --> 00:03:55.449 
connection with the one but maybe it

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:56.729 
connection with the one but maybe it
will<00:03:55.540> get<00:03:55.690> better<00:03:55.900> in<00:03:56.079> the<00:03:56.109> future<00:03:56.530> I<00:03:56.560> don't

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:56.739 
will get better in the future I don't

00:03:56.739 --> 00:03:57.990 
will get better in the future I don't
really<00:03:56.979> know<00:03:57.129> but<00:03:57.280> this<00:03:57.430> is<00:03:57.549> just<00:03:57.639> not<00:03:57.849> how<00:03:57.970> I

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
really know but this is just not how I

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.759 
really know but this is just not how I
prefer<00:03:58.359> my<00:03:58.629> love<00:03:58.870> triangles<00:03:59.290> and<00:03:59.440> my<00:03:59.560> love

00:03:59.759 --> 00:03:59.769

triangles<00:04:00.250> I<00:04:00.400> personally<00:04:00.940> like<00:04:01.120> to<00:04:01.150> be

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:01.959 
triangles I personally like to be

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:04.140 
triangles I personally like to be
connected<00:04:02.470> to<00:04:02.500> both<00:04:02.709> of<00:04:03.010> the<00:04:03.549> potential<00:04:04.000> love

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
connected to both of the potential love

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.599 
connected to both of the potential love
interest<00:04:04.599> so<00:04:04.870> that<00:04:04.900> I'm<00:04:05.079> kind<00:04:05.290> of<00:04:05.379> torn<00:04:05.709> if<00:04:06.069> I

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:06.609 
interest so that I'm kind of torn if I

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:07.500 
interest so that I'm kind of torn if I
already<00:04:06.819> kind<00:04:06.940> of<00:04:07.060> know<00:04:07.150> how<00:04:07.269> the<00:04:07.329> love

already kind of know how the love

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:08.939 
already kind of know how the love
triangles<00:04:07.840> gonna<00:04:07.989> work<00:04:08.139> out<00:04:08.260> I<00:04:08.290> kind<00:04:08.680> of<00:04:08.739> lose

00:04:08.939 --> 00:04:08.949 
triangles gonna work out I kind of lose

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:09.839 
triangles gonna work out I kind of lose
interest<00:04:09.099> and<00:04:09.430> feel<00:04:09.549> that<00:04:09.609> they're<00:04:09.729> a<00:04:09.760> little

00:04:09.839 --> 00:04:09.849 
interest and feel that they're a little

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:11.099 
interest and feel that they're a little
bit<00:04:10.000> away<00:04:10.180> so<00:04:10.239> that's<00:04:10.479> kind<00:04:10.659> of<00:04:10.690> how<00:04:10.810> I<00:04:10.840> felt

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:11.109 
bit away so that's kind of how I felt

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:12.689 
bit away so that's kind of how I felt
with<00:04:11.199> this<00:04:11.349> next<00:04:11.979> I<00:04:12.099> want<00:04:12.220> to<00:04:12.280> talk<00:04:12.370> about<00:04:12.489> the

writing I really did enjoy the writing
style<00:04:14.500> it<00:04:14.620> was<00:04:14.680> very<00:04:15.010> very<00:04:15.190> fast<00:04:15.519> paced<00:04:15.819> I

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 
style it was very very fast paced I

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:17.159

series<00:04:18.729> so<00:04:18.820> I'm<00:04:18.880> not<00:04:19.000> sure<00:04:19.060> if<00:04:19.389> this<00:04:19.630> is

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:19.959 
series so I'm not sure if this is

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:21.719 
series so I'm not sure if this is
similar<00:04:20.799> as<00:04:21.010> far<00:04:21.039> as<00:04:21.250> writing<00:04:21.549> some<00:04:21.639> out<00:04:21.700> to

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:21.729 
similar as far as writing some out to

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:23.190 
similar as far as writing some out to
those<00:04:21.909> series<00:04:22.240> or<00:04:22.360> not<00:04:22.389> since<00:04:22.750> I<00:04:22.840> haven't<00:04:23.110> read

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:23.200 
those series or not since I haven't read

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.140 
those series or not since I haven't read
them<00:04:23.380> but<00:04:24.070> I<00:04:24.130> will<00:04:24.310> say<00:04:24.490> one<00:04:24.760> thing<00:04:24.880> that<00:04:24.940> is<00:04:25.120> a

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.150 
them but I will say one thing that is a

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:27.059 
them but I will say one thing that is a
little<00:04:25.300> bit<00:04:25.419> of<00:04:25.479> pet<00:04:25.630> peeve<00:04:25.810> did<00:04:26.020> pop<00:04:26.260> up<00:04:26.500> in

00:04:27.059 --> 00:04:27.069 
little bit of pet peeve did pop up in

00:04:27.069 --> 00:04:29.100 
little bit of pet peeve did pop up in
I<00:04:27.099> do<00:04:27.520> not<00:04:27.759> personally<00:04:27.970> like<00:04:28.330> when<00:04:28.539> a<00:04:28.569> lot<00:04:28.870> of

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.110 
I do not personally like when a lot of

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:31.140 
I do not personally like when a lot of
current<00:04:29.860> pop<00:04:30.129> culture<00:04:30.550> references<00:04:30.970> are<00:04:31.120> made

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.150 
current pop culture references are made

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:33.749 
current pop culture references are made
so<00:04:31.629> for<00:04:31.810> example<00:04:32.199> Beyonce<00:04:32.889> is<00:04:33.189> mentioned<00:04:33.669> as

00:04:33.749 --> 00:04:33.759 
so for example Beyonce is mentioned as

00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:35.369 
so for example Beyonce is mentioned as
like<00:04:33.879> a<00:04:33.909> pop-culture<00:04:34.300> reference<00:04:34.750> in<00:04:34.900> this<00:04:35.050> and

00:04:35.369 --> 00:04:35.379 
like a pop-culture reference in this and

00:04:35.379 --> 00:04:37.260 
like a pop-culture reference in this and
a<00:04:35.830> few<00:04:36.009> other<00:04:36.159> things<00:04:36.250> that<00:04:36.759> just<00:04:36.879> kind<00:04:37.150> of

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:37.270 
a few other things that just kind of

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:39.300 
a few other things that just kind of
grayed<00:04:38.050> me<00:04:38.229> a<00:04:38.259> little<00:04:38.620> bit<00:04:38.770> I<00:04:38.800> just<00:04:38.889> don't<00:04:39.189> like

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:39.310 
grayed me a little bit I just don't like

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:40.619 
grayed me a little bit I just don't like
what<00:04:39.400> a<00:04:39.460> lot<00:04:39.639> of<00:04:39.789> modern<00:04:40.270> pop<00:04:40.599> culture

00:04:40.619 --> 00:04:40.629 
what a lot of modern pop culture

00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:42.179 
what a lot of modern pop culture
references<00:04:41.289> are<00:04:41.439> used<00:04:41.740> I<00:04:41.889> think<00:04:41.919> they're<00:04:42.159> a

00:04:42.179 --> 00:04:42.189 
references are used I think they're a

00:04:42.189 --> 00:04:44.339 
references are used I think they're a
little<00:04:42.280> bit<00:04:42.490> lazy<00:04:42.729> and<00:04:43.150> you<00:04:43.719> could<00:04:43.900> use<00:04:44.110> other

00:04:44.339 --> 00:04:44.349 
little bit lazy and you could use other

00:04:44.349 --> 00:04:46.110 
little bit lazy and you could use other
things<00:04:44.530> to<00:04:44.949> kind<00:04:45.159> of<00:04:45.280> make<00:04:45.520> your<00:04:45.639> descriptions

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:46.120 
things to kind of make your descriptions

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.369 
things to kind of make your descriptions
in<00:04:46.180> your<00:04:46.270> metaphors<00:04:46.659> and<00:04:46.780> that<00:04:46.900> kind<00:04:47.050> of<00:04:47.169> thing

00:04:47.369 --> 00:04:47.379 
in your metaphors and that kind of thing

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:48.839 
in your metaphors and that kind of thing
so<00:04:47.560> that<00:04:47.590> happened<00:04:48.039> a<00:04:48.069> lot<00:04:48.250> in<00:04:48.370> this<00:04:48.490> book<00:04:48.669> and

00:04:48.839 --> 00:04:48.849 
so that happened a lot in this book and

00:04:48.849 --> 00:04:50.129 
so that happened a lot in this book and
I<00:04:48.939> personally<00:04:49.300> didn't<00:04:49.539> like<00:04:49.569> that<00:04:49.810> I<00:04:49.840> didn't

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:50.139 
I personally didn't like that I didn't

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:51.659 
I personally didn't like that I didn't
talk<00:04:50.259> any<00:04:50.469> kind<00:04:50.680> of<00:04:50.770> points<00:04:51.069> or<00:04:51.159> any<00:04:51.340> rating

00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:51.669 
talk any kind of points or any rating

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:53.040 
talk any kind of points or any rating
from<00:04:51.849> that<00:04:51.969> because<00:04:52.120> that's<00:04:52.389> a<00:04:52.479> personal<00:04:52.870> view

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:53.050 
from that because that's a personal view

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:54.959 
from that because that's a personal view
but<00:04:53.199> if<00:04:53.289> you<00:04:53.469> are<00:04:53.680> kind<00:04:53.830> of<00:04:53.949> irked<00:04:54.550> by<00:04:54.699> that

00:04:54.959 --> 00:04:54.969 
but if you are kind of irked by that

00:04:54.969 --> 00:04:56.339 
but if you are kind of irked by that
just<00:04:55.210> be<00:04:55.360> aware<00:04:55.569> if<00:04:55.719> you<00:04:55.810> are<00:04:55.930> going<00:04:56.050> to<00:04:56.169> read

00:04:56.339 --> 00:04:56.349 
just be aware if you are going to read

00:04:56.349 --> 00:04:57.990 
just be aware if you are going to read
this<00:04:56.500> also<00:04:57.069> some<00:04:57.189> of<00:04:57.280> the<00:04:57.340> plot<00:04:57.580> twists<00:04:57.849> that

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:58.000 
this also some of the plot twists that

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.219 
this also some of the plot twists that
happen<00:04:58.210> in<00:04:58.300> this<00:04:58.419> I<00:04:58.539> found<00:04:58.719> a<00:04:58.840> little<00:04:59.110> bit

00:04:59.219 --> 00:04:59.229 
happen in this I found a little bit

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:02.129 
happen in this I found a little bit
predictable<00:04:59.830> and<00:05:00.400> I<00:05:00.759> kind<00:05:01.000> of<00:05:01.060> knew<00:05:01.389> what<00:05:02.020> was

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:02.139 
predictable and I kind of knew what was

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:03.869 
predictable and I kind of knew what was
gonna<00:05:02.259> happen<00:05:02.349> before<00:05:02.830> it<00:05:03.069> happened<00:05:03.430> but<00:05:03.639> I

00:05:03.869 --> 00:05:03.879 
gonna happen before it happened but I

00:05:03.879 --> 00:05:06.209 
gonna happen before it happened but I
will<00:05:04.449> say<00:05:04.629> that<00:05:04.810> I<00:05:04.840> didn't<00:05:05.199> know<00:05:05.409> how<00:05:05.770> it<00:05:05.800> was

00:05:06.209 --> 00:05:06.219 
will say that I didn't know how it was

00:05:06.219 --> 00:05:08.399 
will say that I didn't know how it was
going<00:05:06.430> to<00:05:06.580> happen<00:05:06.969> so<00:05:07.210> while<00:05:07.360> I<00:05:07.389> knew<00:05:07.810> and<00:05:08.229> I

00:05:08.399 --> 00:05:08.409 
going to happen so while I knew and I

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:10.469 
going to happen so while I knew and I
predicted<00:05:08.860> the<00:05:08.949> twists<00:05:09.400> I<00:05:09.610> didn't<00:05:10.210> know<00:05:10.330> how

00:05:10.469 --> 00:05:10.479 
predicted the twists I didn't know how

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:12.240 
predicted the twists I didn't know how
the<00:05:10.539> twists<00:05:11.050> were<00:05:11.169> going<00:05:11.379> to<00:05:11.440> be<00:05:11.530> executed<00:05:12.159> if

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:12.250 
the twists were going to be executed if

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:13.740 
the twists were going to be executed if
that<00:05:12.400> makes<00:05:12.580> any<00:05:12.669> sense<00:05:12.849> so<00:05:13.240> while<00:05:13.509> it<00:05:13.599> was<00:05:13.719> a

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:13.750 
that makes any sense so while it was a

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:15.209 
that makes any sense so while it was a
little<00:05:13.840> predictable<00:05:14.530> it<00:05:14.710> wasn't<00:05:15.069> as

00:05:15.209 --> 00:05:15.219 
little predictable it wasn't as

00:05:15.219 --> 00:05:16.559 
little predictable it wasn't as
predictable<00:05:15.759> as<00:05:15.879> it<00:05:16.060> could<00:05:16.300> have<00:05:16.389> been

00:05:16.559 --> 00:05:16.569 
predictable as it could have been

00:05:16.569 --> 00:05:18.420 
predictable as it could have been
overall<00:05:17.259> I<00:05:17.500> really<00:05:17.620> enjoyed<00:05:17.949> how<00:05:18.099> this<00:05:18.279> book

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:18.430 
overall I really enjoyed how this book

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:19.890 
overall I really enjoyed how this book
explored<00:05:18.849> a<00:05:18.969> number<00:05:19.000> of<00:05:19.210> different<00:05:19.509> concepts

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:19.900 
explored a number of different concepts

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:21.689 
explored a number of different concepts
revolving<00:05:20.289> around<00:05:20.409> parallel<00:05:20.949> universes<00:05:21.370> and

00:05:21.689 --> 00:05:21.699 
revolving around parallel universes and

00:05:21.699 --> 00:05:23.279 
revolving around parallel universes and
how<00:05:22.240> it<00:05:22.360> would<00:05:22.449> be<00:05:22.599> to<00:05:22.629> jump<00:05:22.930> into<00:05:23.199> those

00:05:23.279 --> 00:05:23.289 
how it would be to jump into those

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:24.959 
how it would be to jump into those
universes<00:05:23.800> and<00:05:23.919> see<00:05:24.099> how<00:05:24.219> things<00:05:24.400> change<00:05:24.550> and

00:05:24.959 --> 00:05:24.969 
universes and see how things change and

00:05:24.969 --> 00:05:26.459 
universes and see how things change and
how<00:05:25.090> different<00:05:25.240> decisions<00:05:25.689> change<00:05:26.020> a<00:05:26.229> ton<00:05:26.439> of

00:05:26.459 --> 00:05:26.469 
how different decisions change a ton of

00:05:26.469 --> 00:05:27.869 
how different decisions change a ton of
different<00:05:26.830> things<00:05:27.039> and<00:05:27.310> how<00:05:27.639> that<00:05:27.789> would

00:05:27.869 --> 00:05:27.879 
different things and how that would

00:05:27.879 --> 00:05:29.459 
different things and how that would
affect<00:05:28.120> a<00:05:28.210> person<00:05:28.509> that<00:05:28.599> was<00:05:28.689> traveling<00:05:29.080> into

00:05:29.459 --> 00:05:29.469 
affect a person that was traveling into

00:05:29.469 --> 00:05:31.469 
affect a person that was traveling into
them<00:05:29.620> as<00:05:29.800> well<00:05:30.159> as<00:05:30.340> the<00:05:30.460> concept<00:05:30.819> of<00:05:30.969> fate<00:05:31.270> and

00:05:31.469 --> 00:05:31.479 
them as well as the concept of fate and

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:33.119 
them as well as the concept of fate and
can<00:05:31.599> we<00:05:31.690> really<00:05:31.870> change<00:05:31.960> fate<00:05:32.469> or<00:05:32.680> are<00:05:32.860> we<00:05:33.009> all

00:05:33.119 --> 00:05:33.129 
can we really change fate or are we all

00:05:33.129 --> 00:05:36.149 
can we really change fate or are we all
kind<00:05:33.430> of<00:05:33.580> on<00:05:33.729> the<00:05:33.909> same<00:05:34.150> trajectory<00:05:34.979> due<00:05:35.979> to

00:05:36.149 --> 00:05:36.159 
kind of on the same trajectory due to

00:05:36.159 --> 00:05:37.980 
kind of on the same trajectory due to
fate<00:05:36.430> regardless<00:05:37.270> of<00:05:37.389> which<00:05:37.509> universe<00:05:37.840> were

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:37.990 
fate regardless of which universe were

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:39.839 
fate regardless of which universe were
in<00:05:38.050> etc<00:05:38.949> so<00:05:39.069> a<00:05:39.129> lot<00:05:39.279> of<00:05:39.340> those<00:05:39.460> things<00:05:39.669> are

00:05:39.839 --> 00:05:39.849 
in etc so a lot of those things are

00:05:39.849 --> 00:05:41.040 
in etc so a lot of those things are
explored<00:05:40.240> in<00:05:40.360> here<00:05:40.539> and<00:05:40.659> I'm<00:05:40.719> sure<00:05:40.900> will<00:05:40.990> be

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:41.050 
explored in here and I'm sure will be

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:42.540 
explored in here and I'm sure will be
explored<00:05:41.349> in<00:05:41.440> the<00:05:41.529> rest<00:05:41.740> of<00:05:41.889> the<00:05:42.009> series<00:05:42.370> and

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:42.550 
explored in the rest of the series and

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:44.100 
explored in the rest of the series and
I'm<00:05:42.639> really<00:05:42.789> looking<00:05:43.060> forward<00:05:43.240> to<00:05:43.389> that<00:05:43.509> so

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:44.110

I'm really looking forward to that so
overall<00:05:44.409> I<00:05:44.529> really<00:05:44.889> enjoyed<00:05:45.190> this<00:05:45.339> book<00:05:45.520> while

00:05:45.779 --> 00:05:45.789 
overall I really enjoyed this book while

00:05:45.789 --> 00:05:47.070 
overall I really enjoyed this book while
there<00:05:45.909> were<00:05:45.969> a<00:05:46.029> few<00:05:46.180> problems<00:05:46.389> that<00:05:46.539> I<00:05:46.659> had<00:05:46.900> it

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:47.080 
there were a few problems that I had it

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:48.119 
there were a few problems that I had it
didn't<00:05:47.319> take<00:05:47.440> away<00:05:47.469> from<00:05:47.740> my<00:05:47.830> general

00:05:48.119 --> 00:05:48.129 
didn't take away from my general

00:05:48.129 --> 00:05:49.680 
didn't take away from my general
enjoyment<00:05:48.550> of<00:05:48.849> it<00:05:49.029> and<00:05:49.180> I'm<00:05:49.240> looking<00:05:49.360> forward

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:49.690 
enjoyment of it and I'm looking forward

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:51.329 
enjoyment of it and I'm looking forward
to<00:05:49.810> the<00:05:49.930> rest<00:05:50.050> of<00:05:50.229> the<00:05:50.319> series<00:05:50.710> again<00:05:51.099> I<00:05:51.279> told

00:05:51.329 --> 00:05:51.339 
to the rest of the series again I told

00:05:51.339 --> 00:05:52.920 
to the rest of the series again I told
you<00:05:51.669> guys<00:05:51.789> before<00:05:52.000> that<00:05:52.330> I<00:05:52.360> have<00:05:52.599> a<00:05:52.779> lot<00:05:52.900> of

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:52.930 
you guys before that I have a lot of

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:54.749 
you guys before that I have a lot of
problems<00:05:53.289> with<00:05:53.379> first<00:05:53.710> books<00:05:54.069> in<00:05:54.250> a<00:05:54.339> series

00:05:54.749 --> 00:05:54.759 
problems with first books in a series

00:05:54.759 --> 00:05:56.490 
problems with first books in a series
they<00:05:54.909> always<00:05:55.270> just<00:05:55.509> don't<00:05:55.750> quite<00:05:56.020> live<00:05:56.349> up<00:05:56.379> to

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:56.500 
they always just don't quite live up to

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:58.019 
they always just don't quite live up to
my<00:05:56.650> expectations<00:05:57.370> and<00:05:57.520> I<00:05:57.610> think<00:05:57.639> that's<00:05:57.969> a

00:05:58.019 --> 00:05:58.029 
my expectations and I think that's a

00:05:58.029 --> 00:05:59.369 
my expectations and I think that's a
little<00:05:58.120> bit<00:05:58.300> of<00:05:58.389> what<00:05:58.539> happened<00:05:58.839> here<00:05:59.080> but<00:05:59.349> I

00:05:59.369 --> 00:05:59.379 
little bit of what happened here but I

00:05:59.379 --> 00:06:02.070 
little bit of what happened here but I
did<00:05:59.529> give<00:05:59.650> this<00:05:59.740> book<00:06:00.009> 3.75<00:06:01.000> to<00:06:01.240> 4<00:06:01.479> stars<00:06:01.900> I

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:02.080 
did give this book 3.75 to 4 stars I

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:04.019 
did give this book 3.75 to 4 stars I
really<00:06:02.319> can't<00:06:02.529> decide<00:06:02.949> exactly<00:06:03.370> where<00:06:03.729> I<00:06:03.789> sit

00:06:04.019 --> 00:06:04.029 
really can't decide exactly where I sit

00:06:04.029 --> 00:06:05.670 
really can't decide exactly where I sit
with<00:06:04.150> it<00:06:04.330> but<00:06:04.479> I<00:06:04.509> did<00:06:04.690> really<00:06:04.930> enjoy<00:06:05.020> it<00:06:05.589> and
