have the yo mama application it's a very
simple<00:00:32.099> interface<00:00:32.489> but<00:00:33.480> it's<00:00:33.660> good<00:00:33.899> for<00:00:34.050> the

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
simple interface but it's good for the

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.600 
simple interface but it's good for the
application<00:00:34.680> because<00:00:34.829> there's<00:00:35.309> not<00:00:35.430> much

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
application because there's not much

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.389

other<00:00:35.880> things<00:00:36.090> you<00:00:36.390> can<00:00:36.540> do<00:00:36.660> they<00:00:37.649> but<00:00:38.250> they're

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
other things you can do they but they're

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:39.680 
other things you can do they but they're
definitely<00:00:38.550> gonna<00:00:38.790> be<00:00:38.940> adding<00:00:39.270> some<00:00:39.300> cooler

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
definitely gonna be adding some cooler

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.229 
definitely gonna be adding some cooler
features<00:00:40.140> but<00:00:40.469> it's<00:00:41.129> not<00:00:41.309> that<00:00:41.460> difficult<00:00:41.910> of

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
features but it's not that difficult of

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.600 
features but it's not that difficult of
an<00:00:42.360> application<00:00:42.960> to<00:00:43.050> use<00:00:43.230> so<00:00:44.010> at<00:00:44.129> the<00:00:44.250> top<00:00:44.460> you

an application to use so at the top you

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.450 
an application to use so at the top you
have<00:00:44.640> six<00:00:45.180> tabs<00:00:45.480> that<00:00:45.719> say<00:00:46.079> stupid<00:00:46.500> bad<00:00:47.070> old
