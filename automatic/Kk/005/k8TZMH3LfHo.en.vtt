00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
the Roseburg who spent at the age of the

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.110 
the Roseburg who spent at the age of the
main<00:02:28.050> straight<00:02:28.350> line<00:02:28.650> was<00:02:29.520> a<00:02:29.550> dangerous

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
main straight line was a dangerous

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.080 
main straight line was a dangerous
position<00:02:30.890> meanwhile<00:02:31.890> Ross<00:02:32.460> was<00:02:32.730> keeping<00:02:33.060> the

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
position meanwhile Ross was keeping the

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.900 
position meanwhile Ross was keeping the
pressure<00:02:33.360> on<00:02:33.570> value<00:02:33.930> but<00:02:34.860> keke<00:02:35.130> rosberg<00:02:35.340> car

pressure on value but keke rosberg car

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:41.000 
pressure on value but keke rosberg car
was<00:02:36.210> a<00:02:36.420> very<00:02:36.720> dangerous<00:02:36.930> position<00:02:37.350> where<00:02:40.010> but

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
was a very dangerous position where but

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.730 
was a very dangerous position where but
marshes<00:02:41.460> took<00:02:41.700> about<00:02:42.090> three<00:02:42.420> laps<00:02:42.690> to<00:02:42.990> put<00:02:43.620> it

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:43.740 
marshes took about three laps to put it

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:48.920 
marshes took about three laps to put it
away<00:02:44.240> but<00:02:45.240> eventually<00:02:45.420> was<00:02:45.960> a<00:02:45.990> right<00:02:47.780> the<00:02:48.780> main

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
away but eventually was a right the main

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.900 
away but eventually was a right the main
thing<00:02:48.960> for<00:02:49.200> me<00:02:49.470> on<00:02:49.770> the<00:02:49.890> race<00:02:50.040> was<00:02:50.310> to<00:02:50.490> keep<00:02:50.730> the

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
thing for me on the race was to keep the

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.600 
thing for me on the race was to keep the
concentration<00:02:51.690> as<00:02:51.870> much<00:02:52.080> as<00:02:52.230> I<00:02:52.350> could<00:02:52.580> to<00:02:53.580> not

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
concentration as much as I could to not

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.550 
concentration as much as I could to not
allowed<00:02:54.090> any<00:02:54.300> mistakes<00:02:54.720> under<00:02:55.380> those

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
allowed any mistakes under those

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.580 
allowed any mistakes under those
tremendous<00:02:56.070> difficult<00:02:56.870> conditions<00:02:57.870> the

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
tremendous difficult conditions the

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.280 
tremendous difficult conditions the
water<00:02:58.910> sometimes<00:02:59.910> was<00:03:00.240> so<00:03:00.540> much<00:03:00.780> that<00:03:00.990> you<00:03:01.110> can

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
water sometimes was so much that you can

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.100 
water sometimes was so much that you can
see<00:03:01.530> that<00:03:01.710> again<00:03:02.000> akasha<00:03:03.000> spins<00:03:03.540> in<00:03:03.810> a

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
see that again akasha spins in a

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.590 
see that again akasha spins in a
straight<00:03:04.530> line<00:03:04.560> which<00:03:05.250> is<00:03:05.400> more<00:03:05.580> about<00:03:05.910> have<00:03:06.570> a

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
straight line which is more about have a

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.100 
straight line which is more about have a
crash<00:03:07.380> there<00:03:07.740> and<00:03:08.480> not<00:03:09.480> a<00:03:09.510> nice<00:03:09.780> land

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
crash there and not a nice land

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:11.690 
crash there and not a nice land
afterwards

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
afterwards

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.119 
afterwards
and<00:03:12.230> so<00:03:13.230> the<00:03:13.379> main<00:03:13.500> thing<00:03:13.680> was<00:03:13.800> to<00:03:13.860> keep

00:03:14.119 --> 00:03:14.129 
and so the main thing was to keep

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:18.440 
and so the main thing was to keep
concentration<00:03:16.370> and<00:03:17.370> we<00:03:17.550> see<00:03:17.730> Prost<00:03:18.090> now

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
concentration and we see Prost now

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.630 
concentration and we see Prost now
losing<00:03:19.019> the<00:03:19.170> card<00:03:19.470> purely<00:03:19.980> in<00:03:20.040> straight<00:03:20.340> line

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
losing the card purely in straight line

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:27.040 
losing the card purely in straight line
with<00:03:21.269> a<00:03:21.390> cop<00:03:21.599> Laney<00:03:21.840> and<00:03:22.760> a<00:03:23.760> lot<00:03:24.480> of<00:03:24.510> spinda<00:03:25.519> but

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:27.050 
with a cop Laney and a lot of spinda but

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:30.170 
with a cop Laney and a lot of spinda but
only<00:03:28.050> the<00:03:28.200> card<00:03:28.440> was<00:03:28.650> slightly<00:03:29.069> damaged<00:03:29.610> but

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
only the card was slightly damaged but

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.400 
only the card was slightly damaged but
that<00:03:30.300> was<00:03:30.540> the<00:03:30.720> end<00:03:30.870> of<00:03:31.019> his<00:03:31.230> race<00:03:31.440> anyway

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:38.370 

then<00:03:35.700> L<00:03:36.700> you<00:03:36.970> had<00:03:37.180> a<00:03:37.210> big<00:03:37.600> pressure<00:03:37.870> from<00:03:38.260> a

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:38.380 
then L you had a big pressure from a

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:40.410 
then L you had a big pressure from a
burrito<00:03:38.770> for<00:03:39.160> the<00:03:39.280> second<00:03:39.640> place<00:03:39.820> is<00:03:40.030> you<00:03:40.240> or

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
burrito for the second place is you or

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.810 
burrito for the second place is you or
has<00:03:40.690> the<00:03:40.840> visor<00:03:41.110> a<00:03:41.470> bit<00:03:41.980> open<00:03:42.370> that<00:03:42.550> as<00:03:42.700> you<00:03:42.790> can

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:42.820 
has the visor a bit open that as you can

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:45.990 
has the visor a bit open that as you can
see<00:03:43.260> to<00:03:44.260> try<00:03:44.530> probably<00:03:45.130> improve<00:03:45.820> the

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
see to try probably improve the

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.230 
see to try probably improve the
visibility

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:48.240 

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:51.380 

and<00:03:49.080> a<00:03:49.230> burrito<00:03:49.440> eventually<00:03:50.340> comes<00:03:51.000> through<00:03:51.360> a

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 
and a burrito eventually comes through a

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:53.570 
and a burrito eventually comes through a
Leo<00:03:51.750> at<00:03:51.900> the<00:03:52.020> end<00:03:52.140> of<00:03:52.230> the<00:03:52.380> straight<00:03:52.620> line<00:03:52.680> not

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:53.580 
Leo at the end of the straight line not

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:56.120 
Leo at the end of the straight line not
that<00:03:53.760> you<00:03:53.910> can<00:03:54.090> see<00:03:54.300> now<00:03:54.770> sabra<00:03:55.770> later<00:03:55.950> was

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
that you can see now sabra later was

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:58.310 
that you can see now sabra later was
through<00:03:56.310> to<00:03:56.460> second<00:03:56.850> place<00:03:57.060> and<00:03:57.360> starting<00:03:58.200> to

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:58.320 
through to second place and starting to

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:00.470 
through to second place and starting to
put<00:03:58.500> some<00:03:58.710> pressure<00:03:58.890> on<00:03:59.100> me<00:03:59.370> but<00:04:00.330> the<00:04:00.450> idea

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
put some pressure on me but the idea

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.380 
put some pressure on me but the idea
that<00:04:00.720> moment<00:04:01.290> had<00:04:01.470> a<00:04:01.500> bad<00:04:01.800> visibility<00:04:02.190> and<00:04:02.880> two

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:03.390 
that moment had a bad visibility and two

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:06.200 
that moment had a bad visibility and two
corners<00:04:03.780> later<00:04:03.990> and<00:04:04.680> locked<00:04:05.460> one<00:04:05.940> of<00:04:06.090> the

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:06.210 
corners later and locked one of the

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:08.480 
corners later and locked one of the
front<00:04:06.480> we<00:04:06.630> use<00:04:06.780> the<00:04:06.960> outside<00:04:07.350> one<00:04:07.590> now<00:04:07.830> I<00:04:08.100> think

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:08.490 
front we use the outside one now I think

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:11.570 
front we use the outside one now I think
and<00:04:08.960> lost<00:04:09.960> the<00:04:10.110> car<00:04:10.320> a<00:04:10.350> bit<00:04:10.620> but<00:04:10.950> did<00:04:11.370> quite

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:11.580 
and lost the car a bit but did quite

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:13.670 
and lost the car a bit but did quite
well<00:04:11.640> I<00:04:12.210> think<00:04:12.300> he<00:04:12.720> managed<00:04:13.080> quite<00:04:13.260> well<00:04:13.320> to

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
well I think he managed quite well to

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:18.160 
well I think he managed quite well to
keep<00:04:13.920> the<00:04:14.100> car<00:04:14.370> going<00:04:14.400> and<00:04:14.880> not<00:04:15.720> crashing

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:18.170 
keep the car going and not crashing

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:22.480 
keep the car going and not crashing
still<00:04:19.170> even<00:04:19.470> if<00:04:19.770> I<00:04:19.890> had<00:04:20.070> a<00:04:20.750> good<00:04:21.750> comfortable

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:22.490 
still even if I had a good comfortable

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:25.430 
still even if I had a good comfortable
lead<00:04:23.490> it<00:04:23.730> was<00:04:23.970> difficult<00:04:24.240> to<00:04:24.780> keep<00:04:25.200> the

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
lead it was difficult to keep the

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.220 
lead it was difficult to keep the
concentration<00:04:26.370> to<00:04:26.640> keep<00:04:26.940> the<00:04:27.120> car<00:04:27.360> under

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:28.230 
concentration to keep the car under

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:31.310 
concentration to keep the car under
control<00:04:29.120> right<00:04:30.120> through<00:04:30.390> the<00:04:30.540> end<00:04:30.690> there<00:04:31.290> i
