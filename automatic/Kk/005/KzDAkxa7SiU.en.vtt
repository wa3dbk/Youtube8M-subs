00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.959 
final thoughts on the battlefield 3 beta
which<00:00:09.330> is<00:00:09.570> probably<00:00:10.019> one<00:00:10.440> of<00:00:10.469> the<00:00:11.010> worse<00:00:11.370> betas

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
which is probably one of the worse betas

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.450 
which is probably one of the worse betas
I<00:00:12.000> have<00:00:12.330> ever<00:00:12.540> played<00:00:12.719> and<00:00:13.019> I've<00:00:13.080> played<00:00:13.460> quite

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
I have ever played and I've played quite

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:15.849 
I have ever played and I've played quite
a<00:00:14.519> few<00:00:14.730> betas<00:00:15.059> I<00:00:15.179> will<00:00:15.330> have<00:00:15.480> to<00:00:15.599> credit

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:15.859 
a few betas I will have to credit

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:17.779 
a few betas I will have to credit
probably<00:00:16.859> the<00:00:16.949> best<00:00:17.130> beta<00:00:17.340> I've<00:00:17.490> ever<00:00:17.640> played

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
probably the best beta I've ever played

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.010 
probably the best beta I've ever played
would<00:00:18.119> have<00:00:18.210> been<00:00:18.300> the<00:00:18.420> call<00:00:18.600> of<00:00:18.690> duty<00:00:18.900> world

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
would have been the call of duty world

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.240 
would have been the call of duty world
at<00:00:19.170> war<00:00:19.230> one<00:00:19.560> I<00:00:19.680> think<00:00:19.830> that<00:00:19.920> was<00:00:20.010> a<00:00:20.039> really

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
at war one I think that was a really

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.620 
at war one I think that was a really
good<00:00:20.490> Baylor<00:00:20.699> and<00:00:21.320> but<00:00:22.320> this<00:00:22.470> one<00:00:22.740> is<00:00:23.630> terrible

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
good Baylor and but this one is terrible

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.750 
good Baylor and but this one is terrible

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
somewhere that just excited just

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.660 
somewhere that just excited just
experienced<00:00:55.260> previously<00:00:55.770> and<00:00:55.949> this<00:00:56.309> is<00:00:56.430> all

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
experienced previously and this is all

reasons<00:01:00.090> because<00:01:00.719> one<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.230> squad<00:01:01.500> mechanics

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
reasons because one the squad mechanics

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.380 
reasons because one the squad mechanics
don't<00:01:02.250> work<00:01:02.460> at<00:01:02.609> all<00:01:02.699> so<00:01:02.910> if<00:01:02.969> you<00:01:03.059> want<00:01:03.210> to<00:01:03.270> play

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
then when you finally get in the game

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.670 
then when you finally get in the game
it's<00:01:08.909> laggy<00:01:09.180> half<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.689> time<00:01:09.869> you<00:01:10.110> run<00:01:10.229> forward

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
it's laggy half the time you run forward

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:11.960 
it's laggy half the time you run forward
and<00:01:10.770> then<00:01:10.860> it<00:01:10.979> lags<00:01:11.189> you<00:01:11.369> backer<00:01:11.610> then<00:01:11.850> your

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
and then it lags you backer then your

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.609 
and then it lags you backer then your
unfortunate<00:01:12.299> legs<00:01:12.659> back<00:01:12.960> and<00:01:13.140> that<00:01:13.350> is<00:01:13.470> the

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
unfortunate legs back and that is the

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.920 
unfortunate legs back and that is the
whole<00:01:13.830> game<00:01:14.119> then<00:01:15.119> you<00:01:15.210> have<00:01:15.330> to<00:01:15.479> leave<00:01:15.659> that

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
whole game then you have to leave that

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.330 
whole game then you have to leave that
one<00:01:16.110> and<00:01:16.290> normally<00:01:16.530> when<00:01:16.680> you<00:01:16.770> leave<00:01:16.950> that<00:01:17.159> one

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
one and normally when you leave that one

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.620 
one and normally when you leave that one
it<00:01:17.430> says<00:01:17.580> you<00:01:17.729> have<00:01:17.850> been<00:01:18.030> signed<00:01:18.299> out<00:01:18.450> of<00:01:18.570> the

EA<00:01:18.780> servers<00:01:19.140> pretty<00:01:19.710> much<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:20.009> only<00:01:20.040> way<00:01:20.280> to

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
EA servers pretty much the only way to

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.890 
EA servers pretty much the only way to
fix<00:01:20.549> that<00:01:20.700> is<00:01:20.759> to<00:01:20.909> restart<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.570> whole<00:01:21.720> damn

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900

to keep running forward and get
slaughtered<00:02:57.330> running<00:02:57.930> forward<00:02:58.290> and<00:02:58.380> get

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
slaughtered running forward and get

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:59.720 
slaughtered running forward and get
slaughtered<00:02:58.740> so<00:02:58.920> maybe<00:02:59.220> you<00:02:59.340> can<00:02:59.430> hop<00:02:59.580> in<00:02:59.670> a

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
slaughtered so maybe you can hop in a

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.210 
slaughtered so maybe you can hop in a
Humvee<00:03:00.000> and<00:03:00.240> drive<00:03:01.170> up<00:03:01.380> there<00:03:01.590> or<00:03:01.830> something

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
Humvee and drive up there or something

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.280 
Humvee and drive up there or something
that's<00:03:02.430> just<00:03:02.640> it's<00:03:03.090> a<00:03:03.270> terrible<00:03:03.840> beta<00:03:04.080> that

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
that's just it's a terrible beta that

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.320 
that's just it's a terrible beta that
showcases<00:03:04.800> the<00:03:05.130> low<00:03:05.340> points<00:03:05.760> of<00:03:05.880> this<00:03:06.060> game

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
showcases the low points of this game

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.410 
showcases the low points of this game
and<00:03:06.630> that<00:03:07.100> if<00:03:08.100> they<00:03:08.280> didn't<00:03:08.640> have<00:03:08.760> a<00:03:08.790> beta<00:03:09.060> I

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
and that if they didn't have a beta I

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:10.910 
and that if they didn't have a beta I
reckon<00:03:09.810> they<00:03:09.960> would<00:03:10.110> sell<00:03:10.350> more<00:03:10.500> copies<00:03:10.740> than

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
reckon they would sell more copies than

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.800 
reckon they would sell more copies than
if<00:03:11.160> now<00:03:11.460> that<00:03:11.670> they<00:03:11.760> have<00:03:11.790> because<00:03:12.180> people<00:03:12.720> are

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
if now that they have because people are

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.750 
if now that they have because people are
going<00:03:12.900> to<00:03:12.990> be<00:03:13.080> turned<00:03:13.350> off<00:03:13.560> by<00:03:13.830> this<00:03:13.890> shit<00:03:14.370> and

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
going to be turned off by this shit and

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.580 
going to be turned off by this shit and
not<00:03:15.570> realize<00:03:15.990> that<00:03:16.170> it's<00:03:16.290> going<00:03:16.410> to<00:03:16.470> be

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
not realize that it's going to be

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:19.370 
not realize that it's going to be
patched<00:03:16.920> and<00:03:17.250> that<00:03:18.150> so<00:03:18.600> it'll<00:03:18.810> work<00:03:18.989> properly

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
patched and that so it'll work properly

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.020 
patched and that so it'll work properly
hopefully<00:03:20.010> when<00:03:20.160> the<00:03:20.190> full<00:03:20.430> game<00:03:20.580> comes<00:03:20.880> out

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
hopefully when the full game comes out

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:22.550 
hopefully when the full game comes out
