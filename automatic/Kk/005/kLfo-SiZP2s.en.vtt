all right it's gonna make a video of me
making<00:00:02.879> the<00:00:03.890> chamber<00:00:04.890> but<00:00:05.520> I<00:00:05.549> kind<00:00:05.819> of<00:00:05.850> forgot

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:06.830 
making the chamber but I kind of forgot

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:12.070 
making the chamber but I kind of forgot
so<00:00:08.059> just<00:00:09.059> gonna<00:00:09.269> tell<00:00:09.599> you<00:00:09.780> how<00:00:10.500> I<00:00:10.530> did<00:00:10.679> it<00:00:10.950> and

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
basically you have your target cartridge

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.420 
basically you have your target cartridge
in<00:00:14.730> this<00:00:14.880> case<00:00:15.150> I<00:00:15.360> have<00:00:15.509> a<00:00:15.540> five<00:00:15.839> five<00:00:15.990> six<00:00:16.430> and

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
in this case I have a five five six and

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:18.710 
in this case I have a five five six and
you<00:00:17.520> want<00:00:17.670> to<00:00:17.760> get<00:00:17.880> yourself<00:00:18.270> a<00:00:18.359> strip<00:00:18.600> of

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
you want to get yourself a strip of

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.260 
you want to get yourself a strip of
paper<00:00:18.900> about<00:00:19.260> the<00:00:19.650> same<00:00:19.859> height<00:00:20.160> and<00:00:20.340> stuff<00:00:20.580> to

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
paper about the same height and stuff to

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.689 
paper about the same height and stuff to
show<00:00:21.420> other<00:00:21.660> the<00:00:21.840> neck<00:00:22.080> of<00:00:22.980> the<00:00:23.100> cartridge<00:00:23.460> and

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
show other the neck of the cartridge and

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.060 
show other the neck of the cartridge and
you<00:00:23.760> basically<00:00:24.660> want<00:00:24.900> to<00:00:24.960> wrap<00:00:25.470> around<00:00:25.500> paper

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
you basically want to wrap around paper

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:33.319 
you basically want to wrap around paper
try<00:00:26.670> to<00:00:29.689> make<00:00:30.689> the<00:00:30.840> diameter<00:00:31.019> even<00:00:32.180> to<00:00:33.180> the

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
try to make the diameter even to the

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.130 
try to make the diameter even to the
actual<00:00:33.660> case<00:00:34.790> and<00:00:35.790> then<00:00:36.000> you<00:00:36.149> would<00:00:36.300> get<00:00:37.079> a

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
actual case and then you would get a

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.709 
actual case and then you would get a
large<00:00:37.440> you<00:00:37.620> know<00:00:37.800> or<00:00:38.129> a<00:00:38.160> wider<00:00:38.480> strip<00:00:39.480> of<00:00:39.600> paper

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
large you know or a wider strip of paper

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.619 
large you know or a wider strip of paper
and<00:00:39.930> they<00:00:40.440> just<00:00:40.590> pretty<00:00:40.710> much<00:00:40.860> the<00:00:40.950> same<00:00:41.100> thing

00:00:41.619 --> 00:00:41.629 
and they just pretty much the same thing

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:46.459 
and they just pretty much the same thing
so<00:00:42.629> you<00:00:42.680> want<00:00:43.680> to<00:00:43.770> get<00:00:43.890> a<00:00:43.920> just<00:00:44.789> flat<00:00:45.690> smooth

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
so you want to get a just flat smooth

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.490 
so you want to get a just flat smooth
cylinder<00:00:47.719> and<00:00:48.719> then<00:00:48.899> you<00:00:49.050> would<00:00:49.170> just<00:00:49.200> take

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
cylinder and then you would just take

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.979 
cylinder and then you would just take
that<00:00:49.649> to<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:49.920> barrel<00:00:50.219> and<00:00:50.690> pretty<00:00:51.690> much<00:00:51.750> glue

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
that to the barrel and pretty much glue

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.500 
that to the barrel and pretty much glue
at<00:00:52.110> all<00:00:52.230> that's<00:00:52.500> all

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:53.510 
at all that's all

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.420 
at all that's all
how's<00:00:54.510> it<00:00:54.539> easier<00:00:54.989> if<00:00:55.140> you<00:00:55.289> have<00:00:55.500> a<00:00:55.530> few<00:00:55.739> end<00:00:56.280> of

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
how's it easier if you have a few end of

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:02.990 
how's it easier if you have a few end of
the<00:00:56.489> dough<00:00:58.160> is<00:00:59.160> shaped<00:00:59.670> over<00:00:59.940> like<00:01:00.149> that<00:01:02.000> so

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
the dough is shaped over like that so

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.750 
the dough is shaped over like that so
there's<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.449> barrel<00:01:06.799> and<00:01:07.799> then<00:01:08.130> you<00:01:08.580> know<00:01:08.700> you

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
there's the barrel and then you know you

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.980 
there's the barrel and then you know you
have<00:01:08.880> your<00:01:09.150> chamber<00:01:10.549> just<00:01:11.549> just<00:01:12.330> glue<00:01:12.659> on<00:01:12.810> my

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
have your chamber just just glue on my

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:19.070 
have your chamber just just glue on my
pencil<00:01:14.479> and<00:01:15.479> you<00:01:15.570> have<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:15.869> chamber<00:01:18.080> portion

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
pencil and you have the chamber portion

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.010 
pencil and you have the chamber portion
right<00:01:19.259> here

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.859 

and<00:01:23.840> we<00:01:24.840> want<00:01:25.440> to<00:01:26.090> of<00:01:27.090> course<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.479> side<00:01:27.690> we

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
and we want to of course the side we

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.200 
and we want to of course the side we
thicker<00:01:28.110> as<00:01:28.350> well<00:01:28.530> but<00:01:28.770> basically<00:01:29.640> it's<00:01:30.090> like

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
thicker as well but basically it's like

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.480 
thicker as well but basically it's like
putting<00:01:30.540> a<00:01:30.600> puzzle<00:01:30.720> together

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490 
putting a puzzle together

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.580 
putting a puzzle together
so<00:01:32.490> you<00:01:32.550> want<00:01:32.790> to<00:01:32.880> do<00:01:33.030> something<00:01:33.330> like<00:01:33.420> that<00:01:33.590> to

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
so you want to do something like that to

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.380 
so you want to do something like that to
poor<00:01:35.070> durability<00:01:35.729> and<00:01:35.850> then<00:01:36.000> you<00:01:36.180> know<00:01:36.300> of

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
poor durability and then you know of

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.670 
poor durability and then you know of
course<00:01:36.450> you're<00:01:36.720> gonna<00:01:36.869> put<00:01:37.080> more<00:01:37.229> people<00:01:37.380> over

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
course you're gonna put more people over

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.109 
course you're gonna put more people over
it<00:01:37.920> so<00:01:38.100> you<00:01:38.190> don't<00:01:38.430> really<00:01:38.610> have<00:01:38.729> to<00:01:38.940> worry

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
it so you don't really have to worry

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:45.139 
it so you don't really have to worry
about<00:01:39.300> it<00:01:40.200> that<00:01:40.380> much<00:01:40.650> and<00:01:43.759> another<00:01:44.759> thing<00:01:45.000> you

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
about it that much and another thing you

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:50.260 
about it that much and another thing you
could<00:01:45.390> do<00:01:45.600> is<00:01:45.810> um<00:01:46.460> you<00:01:47.460> can<00:01:47.640> enter<00:01:47.880> line<00:01:48.090> the

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 
could do is um you can enter line the

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:55.070 
could do is um you can enter line the
the<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:52.050> walls<00:01:52.259> of<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.560> chamber<00:01:53.070> with<00:01:53.550> a<00:01:54.080> some

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.080 
the the walls of the chamber with a some

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.320 
the the walls of the chamber with a some
sort<00:01:55.320> of<00:01:55.410> metal<00:01:55.740> it<00:01:55.860> doesn't<00:01:56.160> matter<00:01:56.340> I<00:01:56.820> used

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:57.330 
sort of metal it doesn't matter I used

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.100 
sort of metal it doesn't matter I used
in<00:01:57.750> this<00:01:57.929> case<00:01:58.170> I<00:01:58.289> used<00:01:58.470> aluminum<00:01:58.920> tape<00:02:00.110> the

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
in this case I used aluminum tape the

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.740 
in this case I used aluminum tape the
with<00:02:01.679> a<00:02:01.710> backside<00:02:02.369> obviously<00:02:03.030> not<00:02:03.300> the<00:02:03.450> sticky

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
with a backside obviously not the sticky

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.680 
with a backside obviously not the sticky
side<00:02:03.960> to<00:02:04.920> reduce<00:02:05.490> the<00:02:05.640> coefficient<00:02:06.270> of<00:02:06.600> the

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:06.690 
side to reduce the coefficient of the

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:11.170 
side to reduce the coefficient of the
friction<00:02:07.220> the<00:02:08.220> case<00:02:08.399> will<00:02:09.950> fit<00:02:10.950> inside

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
friction the case will fit inside

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:18.199 
friction the case will fit inside
without<00:02:13.160> having<00:02:14.160> it<00:02:14.310> stick<00:02:14.730> I<00:02:15.000> guess<00:02:15.750> and<00:02:17.209> the

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
without having it stick I guess and the

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:20.030 
without having it stick I guess and the
case<00:02:18.570> of<00:02:18.600> the<00:02:18.780> mg42<00:02:19.170> barrel<00:02:19.620> I<00:02:19.650> was<00:02:19.800> able<00:02:19.890> to

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
case of the mg42 barrel I was able to

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.199 
case of the mg42 barrel I was able to
find<00:02:20.370> a<00:02:20.550> a<00:02:21.380> brass<00:02:22.380> tube<00:02:22.800> from<00:02:23.640> this<00:02:23.819> little<00:02:23.970> bag

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
find a a brass tube from this little bag

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:27.800 
find a a brass tube from this little bag
of<00:02:24.420> shapes<00:02:24.690> and<00:02:24.840> sizes<00:02:24.930> that<00:02:26.720> happened<00:02:27.720> to

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
of shapes and sizes that happened to

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:33.410 
of shapes and sizes that happened to
match<00:02:28.500> the<00:02:28.829> width<00:02:28.980> of<00:02:29.190> the<00:02:30.380> 10.16<00:02:32.120> and<00:02:33.120> so<00:02:33.390> I

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
match the width of the 10.16 and so I

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.080 
match the width of the 10.16 and so I
mean<00:02:33.780> there's<00:02:34.019> just<00:02:34.079> no<00:02:34.380> lag<00:02:34.620> whatsoever<00:02:35.340> and

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
mean there's just no lag whatsoever and
