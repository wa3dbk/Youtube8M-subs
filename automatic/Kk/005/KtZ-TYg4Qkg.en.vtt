gets<00:03:30.000> to<00:03:30.120> the<00:03:30.209> real<00:03:30.389> pain<00:03:30.930> bit<00:03:31.859> it's<00:03:32.159> how<00:03:32.400> to

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
gets to the real pain bit it's how to

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:35.809 
gets to the real pain bit it's how to
enter<00:03:33.030> a<00:03:33.979> this<00:03:34.979> becomes<00:03:35.280> it<00:03:35.430> becomes<00:03:35.519> quite

00:03:35.809 --> 00:03:35.819 
enter a this becomes it becomes quite

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:37.939 
enter a this becomes it becomes quite
tricky<00:03:36.120> because<00:03:36.419> this<00:03:37.079> relies<00:03:37.409> on<00:03:37.439> everybody

00:03:37.939 --> 00:03:37.949 
tricky because this relies on everybody

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:40.789 
tricky because this relies on everybody
being<00:03:38.250> online<00:03:38.400> at<00:03:38.790> the<00:03:38.879> right<00:03:39.030> times<00:03:39.650> so<00:03:40.650> this

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:40.799 
being online at the right times so this

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:42.589 
being online at the right times so this
is<00:03:40.889> how<00:03:41.009> it<00:03:41.099> works<00:03:41.250> I<00:03:41.489> often<00:03:41.790> go<00:03:42.120> away<00:03:42.329> on

Daniel<00:04:17.960> TJ<00:04:18.700> once<00:04:19.700> you've<00:04:19.850> done<00:04:20.000> that<00:04:20.060> i<00:04:20.330> will

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:20.540 
Daniel TJ once you've done that i will

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:22.570 
Daniel TJ once you've done that i will
put<00:04:20.720> all<00:04:20.930> your<00:04:21.110> names<00:04:21.380> into<00:04:21.800> a<00:04:21.830> big<00:04:22.040> sort<00:04:22.520> of

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580 
put all your names into a big sort of

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:24.670 
put all your names into a big sort of
spreadsheet<00:04:23.150> and<00:04:23.330> i<00:04:23.900> will<00:04:24.080> organize<00:04:24.410> it<00:04:24.560> all

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:24.680 
spreadsheet and i will organize it all

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.100 
spreadsheet and i will organize it all
so<00:04:25.190> i<00:04:25.220> kind<00:04:25.520> of<00:04:25.700> roughly<00:04:26.120> know<00:04:26.360> who's<00:04:26.870> going

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110 
so i kind of roughly know who's going

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:29.710 
so i kind of roughly know who's going
where<00:04:27.410> i<00:04:27.620> will<00:04:27.980> try<00:04:28.250> and<00:04:28.310> do<00:04:28.520> this<00:04:28.550> in<00:04:29.000> sort<00:04:29.540> of

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:29.720 
where i will try and do this in sort of

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:31.420 
where i will try and do this in sort of
a<00:04:29.810> first<00:04:30.020> come<00:04:30.230> first<00:04:30.260> serve<00:04:30.830> so<00:04:30.860> the<00:04:31.220> first

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:31.430 
a first come first serve so the first

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:33.460 
a first come first serve so the first
people<00:04:31.700> sending<00:04:31.940> messages<00:04:32.330> will<00:04:32.900> probably<00:04:33.350> be

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:33.470 
people sending messages will probably be

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:35.710 
people sending messages will probably be
the<00:04:33.590> first<00:04:33.830> few<00:04:34.130> in<00:04:34.550> the<00:04:34.700> video<00:04:34.970> now<00:04:35.540> it<00:04:35.690> gets

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:35.720 
the first few in the video now it gets

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.770 
the first few in the video now it gets
complicated<00:04:36.340> with<00:04:37.340> sort<00:04:38.150> of<00:04:38.210> who's<00:04:38.540> online

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:38.780 
complicated with sort of who's online

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:41.440 
complicated with sort of who's online
when<00:04:39.200> I<00:04:39.410> cannot<00:04:40.010> really<00:04:40.460> tell<00:04:40.790> you<00:04:41.000> who<00:04:41.300> will

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:41.450 
when I cannot really tell you who will

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:43.270 
when I cannot really tell you who will
be<00:04:41.570> racing<00:04:41.750> in<00:04:42.080> the<00:04:42.140> next<00:04:42.560> sort<00:04:42.860> of<00:04:42.920> food<00:04:43.040> to<00:04:43.160> be

be racing in the next sort of food to be

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.610 
be racing in the next sort of food to be
online<00:04:43.430> on<00:04:43.760> Thursday<00:04:44.240> because<00:04:45.110> it<00:04:45.410> will

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:45.620 
online on Thursday because it will

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:48.100 
online on Thursday because it will
depend<00:04:45.800> largely<00:04:46.700> on<00:04:47.090> which<00:04:47.660> one<00:04:47.870> of<00:04:47.900> us<00:04:48.050> is

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:48.110 
depend largely on which one of us is
