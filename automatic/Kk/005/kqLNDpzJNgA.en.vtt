 and so 3 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.989
 here's a taxi design 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:01.700
 here 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:03.680
 now take let's say i will 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.720
 use sandstone can sleep 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:09.070
 any food is not where the sand you want but i 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:14.490
 I will use the usual dream as 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:16.680
 we put 5 blocks so and so three black 

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:20.250
 Now we take the white wool set so 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:24.300
 three blocks here is a promise later 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:28.980
 we put here 2 blocks down thick like this 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:31.650
 three blocks and like this three blocks take 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:35.120
 black was put to 1 and here 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.120
 we customize all troubles with wool 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:40.480
 here guys we should get this 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.760
 you all do the same thing 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:47.410
 we put black wool eaters 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:49.310
 here the bulkhead meetings and here the food is not 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:52.340
 so three blocks white 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:54.740
 so three down block white sweat stage 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:57.020
 block of white and here so finish 

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:59.660
 do wool like this should happen 

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:03.940
 and now all that's left here 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:03.940
 building sandstone 

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:13.590
 like this 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:17.489
 Now we take the black wool and set 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:20.329
 here is one block here like this 13 here 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:25.000
 103 like this 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:25.000
 then so 2 height 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:30.930
 So 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:34.669
 then 55 in the nose here is black wool and 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:40.919
 we put here in general we take dark green 

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:44.840
 wool put here and here and harm here from 

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:48.860
 god take it like this 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:54.199
 conv from the rest here here and 2 here here 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:57.530
 so now we take the black wool and here 

00:04:54.199 --> 00:05:02.050
 time one block then put like this 2 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:07.190
 down then we put it like this 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:12.280
 there we put so 4 height here we take 

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:12.280
 green, all close again here two here 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:22.470
 so and now 100 so 3 height in go here 

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:22.470
 so here is our need to get 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:32.979
 Now we take the black set so 3 height 

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:37.470
 here 400 then inserted a block and that 

00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:41.180
 put here connect here 

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:41.180
 That's how long it should get 

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:46.310
 that is, this is now we've got 

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:48.710
 height how many six blocks 

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:52.550
 this type 

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:55.690
 There is a way to put it like this 3 4 all now 

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:57.890
 we take matchmakers-6 we put the house to be heated and 

00:05:55.690 --> 00:06:03.800
 like this we put two blocks 

00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:10.340
 until the end so now we take 

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:12.290
 usually pretty and set here so that 

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:14.720
