00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
was planning on releasing it today

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.769 
was planning on releasing it today
though<00:00:23.189> I<00:00:23.220> held<00:00:23.519> back<00:00:23.609> because<00:00:23.970> i<00:00:24.150> had<00:00:24.420> a<00:00:24.449> to

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
let's plays at terraria and the over

let's plays at terraria and the over
craft<00:00:27.000> one<00:00:27.289> actually<00:00:28.289> good<00:00:28.529> thing<00:00:28.710> i<00:00:28.800> didn't

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
craft one actually good thing i didn't

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.490 
craft one actually good thing i didn't
do<00:00:29.099> it<00:00:29.250> because<00:00:29.340> I<00:00:29.760> tu<00:00:30.119> 13<00:00:30.660> broke<00:00:30.929> it<00:00:31.109> which

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
do it because I tu 13 broke it which

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.670 
do it because I tu 13 broke it which
also<00:00:31.740> the<00:00:32.009> fancy<00:00:32.640> minecart<00:00:33.270> station<00:00:33.780> the<00:00:34.170> card

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
also the fancy minecart station the card

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.680 
also the fancy minecart station the card
calling<00:00:35.010> system<00:00:35.190> is<00:00:35.430> also<00:00:35.670> broken<00:00:36.120> it<00:00:36.450> seems

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
calling system is also broken it seems

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.240 
calling system is also broken it seems
that<00:00:36.809> the<00:00:36.960> carts<00:00:37.350> not<00:00:37.649> only<00:00:37.800> do<00:00:37.980> they<00:00:38.100> go

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
that the carts not only do they go

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.479 
that the carts not only do they go
faster<00:00:38.850> but<00:00:39.000> they<00:00:39.570> fall<00:00:39.899> down<00:00:40.200> faster<00:00:40.890> so<00:00:41.430> I'm

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
faster but they fall down faster so I'm

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.760 
faster but they fall down faster so I'm
working<00:00:41.850> on<00:00:41.940> a<00:00:42.000> fix<00:00:42.270> for<00:00:42.480> that<00:00:42.540> but<00:00:43.020> this<00:00:43.440> one

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
working on a fix for that but this one

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.130 
working on a fix for that but this one
had<00:00:44.489> to<00:00:44.640> actually<00:00:44.760> fix<00:00:45.210> it<00:00:45.390> as<00:00:45.510> well<00:00:45.719> so<00:00:45.960> good

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
had to actually fix it as well so good

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.330 
had to actually fix it as well so good
thing<00:00:46.260> I<00:00:46.350> didn't<00:00:46.559> actually<00:00:46.649> release<00:00:47.160> it

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
thing I didn't actually release it

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.319 
thing I didn't actually release it
because<00:00:47.489> then<00:00:47.640> everybody<00:00:47.850> would<00:00:48.120> have<00:00:48.239> been

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
because then everybody would have been

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.660 
because then everybody would have been
like<00:00:48.420> it<00:00:48.600> doesn't<00:00:48.930> work<00:00:49.079> alright<00:00:50.039> so<00:00:50.370> this<00:00:50.489> is

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
like it doesn't work alright so this is

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.279 
like it doesn't work alright so this is
a<00:00:50.700> simple<00:00:50.969> concept<00:00:51.480> obviously<00:00:51.930> I'm<00:00:52.020> talking

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
a simple concept obviously I'm talking

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.020 
a simple concept obviously I'm talking
about<00:00:52.350> a<00:00:52.530> minecart<00:00:52.949> station<00:00:53.430> there's<00:00:53.640> far

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
about a minecart station there's far

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.720 
about a minecart station there's far
more<00:00:54.059> complicated<00:00:54.570> ways<00:00:55.160> select<00:00:56.160> a<00:00:56.250> track<00:00:56.430> or

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
more complicated ways select a track or

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.369 
more complicated ways select a track or
a<00:00:56.760> direction<00:00:57.180> depending<00:00:57.600> on<00:00:57.989> where<00:00:58.199> you<00:00:58.350> want

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
a direction depending on where you want

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.500 
a direction depending on where you want
to<00:00:58.649> go<00:00:58.739> so<00:00:59.340> I<00:00:59.370> try<00:00:59.550> to<00:00:59.579> think<00:00:59.760> of<00:00:59.940> a<00:01:00.000> very<00:01:00.270> very

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
to go so I try to think of a very very

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.429 
to go so I try to think of a very very
simple<00:01:00.960> way<00:01:01.140> to<00:01:01.170> do<00:01:01.440> this<00:01:02.059> for<00:01:03.059> example<00:01:03.539> now

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
simple way to do this for example now

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:09.130 
simple way to do this for example now
let's<00:01:04.979> change<00:01:05.880> this<00:01:06.240> for<00:01:06.750> a<00:01:06.810> button<00:01:08.000> alright

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140 
let's change this for a button alright

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.000 
let's change this for a button alright
so<00:01:10.140> let's<00:01:10.320> say<00:01:10.470> you<00:01:10.500> don't<00:01:10.740> want<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:10.920> do<00:01:10.979> a

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
so let's say you don't want to do a

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.160 
so let's say you don't want to do a
minecart<00:01:11.369> station<00:01:11.909> you<00:01:12.360> know<00:01:12.479> it's<00:01:12.659> not<00:01:12.900> that

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
minecart station you know it's not that

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.859 
minecart station you know it's not that
deep<00:01:13.350> and<00:01:13.680> you<00:01:14.460> want<00:01:14.640> to<00:01:14.729> just<00:01:14.850> kind<00:01:15.090> of<00:01:15.180> a<00:01:15.390> pic

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
deep and you want to just kind of a pic

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.749 
deep and you want to just kind of a pic
you<00:01:16.049> know<00:01:16.170> left<00:01:16.439> right<00:01:16.830> that<00:01:17.250> kind<00:01:17.460> of<00:01:17.520> thing

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
you know left right that kind of thing

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.700 
you know left right that kind of thing
okay<00:01:18.150> you<00:01:19.020> don't<00:01:19.049> want<00:01:19.320> to<00:01:19.380> build<00:01:19.530> a<00:01:19.590> whole

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
okay you don't want to build a whole

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.140 
okay you don't want to build a whole
minecart<00:01:20.070> station<00:01:20.400> for<00:01:20.610> that<00:01:20.700> but<00:01:20.909> you<00:01:20.970> want

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
minecart station for that but you want

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.149 
minecart station for that but you want
something<00:01:21.240> simple<00:01:21.840> to<00:01:22.020> do<00:01:22.229> it<00:01:22.380> obviously<00:01:22.890> now

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
something simple to do it obviously now

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.340 
something simple to do it obviously now
that<00:01:23.790> the<00:01:23.909> cards<00:01:24.240> are<00:01:24.360> faster<00:01:24.960> even<00:01:25.200> before

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
that the cards are faster even before

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.590 
that the cards are faster even before
the<00:01:25.710> cards<00:01:26.009> you<00:01:26.400> know<00:01:26.520> got<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.030> speed<00:01:27.360> boost

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
the cards you know got the speed boost

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.600 
the cards you know got the speed boost
it<00:01:27.869> was<00:01:28.049> pretty<00:01:28.229> hard<00:01:28.439> to<00:01:28.560> do<00:01:28.710> now<00:01:29.189> it's<00:01:29.400> damn

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
it was pretty hard to do now it's damn

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.640 
it was pretty hard to do now it's damn
near<00:01:29.790> impossible<00:01:29.990> so<00:01:30.990> what<00:01:31.200> you<00:01:31.290> would<00:01:31.380> do<00:01:31.560> is

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
near impossible so what you would do is

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:32.870 
near impossible so what you would do is
you<00:01:31.680> would<00:01:31.740> hit<00:01:31.920> your<00:01:32.100> button<00:01:32.280> you're<00:01:32.640> going

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
you would hit your button you're going

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.190 
you would hit your button you're going
down<00:01:32.939> to<00:01:33.150> track<00:01:33.329> you<00:01:33.479> like<00:01:33.509> I<00:01:33.780> want<00:01:33.990> to<00:01:34.049> go<00:01:34.110> the

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
down to track you like I want to go the

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.990 
down to track you like I want to go the
other<00:01:34.229> way<00:01:34.380> and<00:01:34.590> you<00:01:35.490> know<00:01:35.610> good<00:01:35.850> luck

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
other way and you know good luck

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.450 
other way and you know good luck
actually<00:01:36.420> hitting<00:01:36.659> that<00:01:36.869> I<00:01:37.140> or<00:01:37.799> even<00:01:38.040> figuring

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
actually hitting that I or even figuring

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.700 
actually hitting that I or even figuring
out<00:01:38.700> what<00:01:39.150> direction<00:01:39.329> it's<00:01:39.840> facing<00:01:40.290> on<00:01:40.439> to

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
out what direction it's facing on to

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.370 
out what direction it's facing on to
then<00:01:40.979> make<00:01:41.189> a<00:01:41.220> choice<00:01:41.490> now<00:01:42.450> granted<00:01:42.869> you<00:01:43.049> could

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
then make a choice now granted you could

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.039 
then make a choice now granted you could
potentially<00:01:44.119> figure<00:01:45.119> out<00:01:45.270> your<00:01:45.420> spacing<00:01:45.899> on

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
potentially figure out your spacing on

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.170 
potentially figure out your spacing on
powered<00:01:46.409> rails<00:01:46.680> so<00:01:47.310> that<00:01:47.460> you<00:01:47.549> approach<00:01:47.880> this

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
powered rails so that you approach this

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.039 
powered rails so that you approach this
at<00:01:48.420> a<00:01:48.450> slower<00:01:48.780> pace<00:01:49.909> yes<00:01:50.909> I<00:01:51.119> mean<00:01:51.270> it's<00:01:51.659> it's

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
at a slower pace yes I mean it's it's

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.080 
at a slower pace yes I mean it's it's
doable<00:01:52.409> I<00:01:52.740> guess<00:01:53.100> but<00:01:53.399> that<00:01:53.670> means<00:01:53.880> that

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
doable I guess but that means that

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.270 
doable I guess but that means that
you're<00:01:54.180> gonna<00:01:54.299> have<00:01:54.479> to<00:01:54.600> lose<00:01:54.780> momentum<00:01:55.280> very

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
you're gonna have to lose momentum very

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.630 
you're gonna have to lose momentum very
very<00:01:56.520> early<00:01:56.969> on<00:01:57.000> to<00:01:57.930> basically<00:01:58.530> make<00:01:59.130> a<00:01:59.159> track

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
very early on to basically make a track

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.319 
very early on to basically make a track
change<00:02:00.030> see<00:02:01.130> it's<00:02:02.130> still<00:02:02.340> very<00:02:02.640> fast<00:02:03.000> and<00:02:03.240> I

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
change see it's still very fast and I

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.200 
change see it's still very fast and I
missed<00:02:03.600> it<00:02:03.780> so<00:02:04.439> my<00:02:04.619> solution<00:02:05.130> to<00:02:05.280> this<00:02:05.430> was<00:02:05.939> a

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
missed it so my solution to this was a

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.630 
missed it so my solution to this was a

was<00:02:11.280> looking<00:02:11.700> for<00:02:11.970> a<00:02:12.000> way<00:02:12.330> you<00:02:12.780> know<00:02:12.900> to

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930

completely different it didn't work but
I<00:02:18.700> got<00:02:19.060> the<00:02:19.210> general<00:02:19.630> concept<00:02:19.950> down<00:02:20.950> which<00:02:21.280> is

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
I got the general concept down which is

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
a lot of different things the problem is

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.230 
a lot of different things the problem is
is<00:02:31.990> that<00:02:32.020> they<00:02:32.290> lock<00:02:32.530> up<00:02:32.770> so<00:02:33.520> for<00:02:33.700> example<00:02:33.790> as

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:34.240 
is that they lock up so for example as

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:35.370 
is that they lock up so for example as
you<00:02:34.330> can<00:02:34.450> tell<00:02:34.630> you're<00:02:34.840> I<00:02:34.870> want<00:02:35.140> to<00:02:35.200> put<00:02:35.350> a

crazy you know that's what rapid pushers
do<00:02:41.260> the<00:02:41.740> problem<00:02:42.130> is<00:02:42.220> is<00:02:42.370> that<00:02:42.400> they<00:02:42.640> do<00:02:42.700> get

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
do the problem is is that they do get

you can stick a button on it and turn it
on<00:02:49.960> and<00:02:50.110> off<00:02:50.200> and<00:02:50.500> it<00:02:51.100> will<00:02:51.670> reset<00:02:52.090> it<00:02:52.240> you<00:02:52.300> can

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
on and off and it will reset it you can

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.690 
on and off and it will reset it you can
put<00:02:52.600> a<00:02:52.630> lever<00:02:52.900> and<00:02:53.110> turn<00:02:53.320> it<00:02:53.470> on<00:02:53.560> and<00:02:53.740> off<00:02:53.830> in

video<00:03:06.010> I<00:03:06.220> had<00:03:06.490> it<00:03:06.640> right<00:03:06.820> around<00:03:07.090> here<00:03:07.510> the

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
video I had it right around here the

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.340 
video I had it right around here the
track<00:03:08.140> the<00:03:08.710> track<00:03:09.060> the<00:03:10.060> detector<00:03:10.540> rail<00:03:10.690> and<00:03:10.900> it

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.350 
track the track the detector rail and it

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:13.350 
track the track the detector rail and it
had<00:03:11.470> plenty<00:03:11.740> of<00:03:11.860> time<00:03:11.980> to<00:03:12.190> activate<00:03:12.790> this<00:03:13.120> on

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 
had plenty of time to activate this on

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.510 
had plenty of time to activate this on
and<00:03:13.570> off<00:03:13.690> the<00:03:14.650> problem<00:03:14.980> now<00:03:15.130> is<00:03:15.160> that<00:03:15.310> these

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:15.520 
and off the problem now is that these

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.860 
and off the problem now is that these
cards<00:03:15.850> go<00:03:16.000> crazy<00:03:16.330> fast<00:03:16.690> so<00:03:17.110> this<00:03:17.410> is<00:03:17.800> the<00:03:18.490> track

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
cards go crazy fast so this is the track

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.949 
cards go crazy fast so this is the track
the<00:03:20.190> detector<00:03:21.190> rail<00:03:21.370> that<00:03:22.060> will<00:03:22.240> turn<00:03:22.510> this<00:03:22.690> on

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959 
the detector rail that will turn this on

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:24.830 
the detector rail that will turn this on
and<00:03:22.990> off<00:03:23.290> in<00:03:23.500> the<00:03:23.620> event<00:03:23.860> that<00:03:23.950> it<00:03:24.070> is<00:03:24.310> broken

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
and off in the event that it is broken

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.870 
and off in the event that it is broken
so<00:03:25.840> regardless<00:03:26.800> whether<00:03:27.070> it's<00:03:27.340> broken<00:03:27.610> or<00:03:27.820> not

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:27.880 
so regardless whether it's broken or not

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:29.340 
so regardless whether it's broken or not
it's<00:03:28.300> going<00:03:28.510> to<00:03:28.600> work<00:03:28.810> and<00:03:29.020> it's<00:03:29.140> going<00:03:29.290> to

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:29.350 
it's going to work and it's going to

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:32.310 
it's going to work and it's going to
reactivate<00:03:30.040> it<00:03:30.220> at<00:03:30.370> this<00:03:31.090> point<00:03:31.390> from<00:03:31.660> track

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:32.320 
reactivate it at this point from track

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:35.010 
reactivate it at this point from track
detector<00:03:32.920> to<00:03:33.760> the<00:03:33.940> block<00:03:34.209> that<00:03:34.420> has<00:03:34.660> a

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:35.020 
detector to the block that has a

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:36.960 
detector to the block that has a
redstone<00:03:35.560> torch<00:03:35.709> underneath<00:03:36.370> it<00:03:36.580> it's<00:03:36.760> about

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
redstone torch underneath it it's about

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:39.510 
redstone torch underneath it it's about
18<00:03:37.540> blocks<00:03:37.810> away<00:03:38.140> it's<00:03:38.709> really<00:03:38.920> needed<00:03:39.340> only

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:39.520 
18 blocks away it's really needed only

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.610 
18 blocks away it's really needed only
on<00:03:39.790> the<00:03:39.940> specific<00:03:40.450> angle<00:03:40.810> see<00:03:41.200> I<00:03:41.230> don't<00:03:41.350> have

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
on the specific angle see I don't have

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.500 
on the specific angle see I don't have
any<00:03:41.770> on<00:03:41.860> this<00:03:42.100> side<00:03:42.310> but<00:03:42.910> depending<00:03:43.270> on<00:03:43.360> where

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.510 
any on this side but depending on where

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:44.940 
any on this side but depending on where
you<00:03:43.630> built<00:03:43.810> to<00:03:43.930> just<00:03:44.140> basically<00:03:44.290> have<00:03:44.709> a<00:03:44.739> way

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
you built to just basically have a way

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:47.729 
you built to just basically have a way
to<00:03:45.010> turn<00:03:45.250> it<00:03:45.310> on<00:03:45.520> and<00:03:45.820> off<00:03:46.230> so<00:03:47.230> now<00:03:47.380> what<00:03:47.590> I'll

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:47.739 
to turn it on and off so now what I'll

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:49.890 
to turn it on and off so now what I'll
do<00:03:47.950> is<00:03:48.070> I'll<00:03:48.190> show<00:03:48.370> you<00:03:48.430> this<00:03:48.550> system<00:03:49.090> so<00:03:49.690> let's

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
do is I'll show you this system so let's

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.080 
do is I'll show you this system so let's
say<00:03:50.110> I<00:03:50.290> want<00:03:50.620> to<00:03:50.650> go<00:03:50.800> left<00:03:51.100> or<00:03:51.310> right<00:03:51.370> I<00:03:51.790> don't

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090 
say I want to go left or right I don't

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:54.180 
say I want to go left or right I don't
know<00:03:52.239> what<00:03:52.420> direction<00:03:52.630> it's<00:03:53.050> on<00:03:53.260> with<00:03:53.980> this

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
know what direction it's on with this

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:56.400 
know what direction it's on with this
you'll<00:03:54.459> be<00:03:54.640> able<00:03:54.730> to<00:03:54.910> tell<00:03:55.209> because<00:03:55.750> the<00:03:55.959> rapid

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:56.410 
you'll be able to tell because the rapid

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:58.050 
you'll be able to tell because the rapid
pulsar<00:03:56.739> will<00:03:56.860> cause<00:03:57.070> these<00:03:57.340> powered<00:03:57.670> rails<00:03:57.910> to

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
pulsar will cause these powered rails to

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:01.790 
pulsar will cause these powered rails to
come<00:03:58.239> to<00:03:58.390> a<00:03:58.420> crawl<00:03:58.720> you<00:03:59.260> can<00:03:59.440> make<00:03:59.560> your<00:03:59.680> change

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:01.800 
come to a crawl you can make your change

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:05.820 
come to a crawl you can make your change
now<00:04:02.800> you're<00:04:03.100> able<00:04:03.459> to<00:04:03.840> obviously<00:04:04.840> run<00:04:05.500> this

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:05.830 
now you're able to obviously run this

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:07.800 
now you're able to obviously run this
side<00:04:06.280> of<00:04:06.580> it<00:04:06.790> as<00:04:06.970> well<00:04:07.000> into<00:04:07.540> another

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:07.810 
side of it as well into another

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:09.810 
side of it as well into another
directional<00:04:08.440> change<00:04:08.709> now<00:04:09.310> these<00:04:09.459> ones<00:04:09.700> are

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:09.820 
directional change now these ones are

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:11.520 
directional change now these ones are
too<00:04:09.970> close<00:04:10.300> again<00:04:10.660> this<00:04:10.780> was<00:04:10.959> built<00:04:11.170> prior<00:04:11.500> to

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:11.530 
too close again this was built prior to

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:14.670 
too close again this was built prior to
213<00:04:12.430> so<00:04:13.000> I<00:04:13.030> won't<00:04:13.300> even<00:04:13.450> have<00:04:13.660> time<00:04:13.870> to<00:04:13.930> turn

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 
213 so I won't even have time to turn

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.789 
213 so I won't even have time to turn
around<00:04:14.770> and<00:04:15.070> figure<00:04:15.280> it<00:04:15.400> out<00:04:15.580> oh<00:04:16.650> there<00:04:17.650> we<00:04:17.770> go

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:17.799 
around and figure it out oh there we go

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:21.930 
around and figure it out oh there we go
i<00:04:17.950> did<00:04:18.160> have<00:04:18.340> time<00:04:19.770> so<00:04:20.770> that's<00:04:21.220> it<00:04:21.459> that<00:04:21.700> this

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:21.940 
i did have time so that's it that this

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:25.629 
i did have time so that's it that this
is<00:04:22.120> the<00:04:22.270> general<00:04:22.510> concept<00:04:22.870> stick<00:04:23.590> a

00:04:25.629 --> 00:04:25.639 
is the general concept stick a

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:28.390 
is the general concept stick a
rapid<00:04:26.449> pulse<00:04:26.689> are<00:04:26.900> on<00:04:27.080> a<00:04:27.110> section<00:04:27.650> of<00:04:27.770> track<00:04:28.099> as

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.400 
rapid pulse are on a section of track as

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.939 
rapid pulse are on a section of track as
you<00:04:29.210> go<00:04:29.389> over<00:04:29.509> that<00:04:29.599> section<00:04:30.199> it<00:04:30.379> will<00:04:30.439> you

00:04:30.939 --> 00:04:30.949 
you go over that section it will you

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:32.619 
you go over that section it will you
know<00:04:30.979> bring<00:04:31.370> it<00:04:31.490> to<00:04:31.639> a<00:04:31.669> crawl<00:04:32.030> keep<00:04:32.479> in<00:04:32.599> mind

00:04:32.619 --> 00:04:32.629 
know bring it to a crawl keep in mind

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:34.510 
know bring it to a crawl keep in mind
the<00:04:33.080> detector<00:04:33.590> rail<00:04:33.770> system<00:04:34.189> here<00:04:34.400> is

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:34.520 
the detector rail system here is

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:36.969 
the detector rail system here is
optional<00:04:35.060> you<00:04:35.870> could<00:04:36.050> run<00:04:36.229> a<00:04:36.289> lever<00:04:36.650> all<00:04:36.949> the

00:04:36.969 --> 00:04:36.979 
optional you could run a lever all the

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:40.209 
optional you could run a lever all the
way<00:04:37.189> to<00:04:37.370> this<00:04:38.289> specific<00:04:39.289> block<00:04:39.889> right<00:04:40.189> here

00:04:40.209 --> 00:04:40.219 
way to this specific block right here

00:04:40.219 --> 00:04:42.760 
way to this specific block right here
for<00:04:41.180> example<00:04:41.629> knock<00:04:42.020> this<00:04:42.229> off<00:04:42.409> if<00:04:42.620> you<00:04:42.710> like

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:42.770 
for example knock this off if you like

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:45.489 
for example knock this off if you like
just<00:04:43.669> run<00:04:43.849> a<00:04:43.879> redstone<00:04:44.300> line<00:04:44.629> all<00:04:45.259> the<00:04:45.319> way

00:04:45.489 --> 00:04:45.499 
just run a redstone line all the way

00:04:45.499 --> 00:04:47.200 
just run a redstone line all the way
here<00:04:45.860> have<00:04:46.099> a<00:04:46.129> lever<00:04:46.430> all<00:04:46.669> the<00:04:46.699> way<00:04:46.849> over<00:04:47.180> there

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:47.210 
here have a lever all the way over there

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:49.480 
here have a lever all the way over there
and<00:04:47.569> just<00:04:47.689> flick<00:04:47.960> it<00:04:47.990> on<00:04:48.229> and<00:04:48.439> off<00:04:48.590> to<00:04:49.159> ensure

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:49.490 
and just flick it on and off to ensure

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:51.309 
and just flick it on and off to ensure
that<00:04:49.520> it<00:04:49.789> is<00:04:49.819> now<00:04:50.090> broken<00:04:50.389> even<00:04:50.870> if<00:04:50.990> it's<00:04:51.139> now

00:04:51.309 --> 00:04:51.319 
that it is now broken even if it's now

00:04:51.319 --> 00:04:53.200 
that it is now broken even if it's now
broken<00:04:51.529> it<00:04:51.889> will<00:04:52.009> reactivate<00:04:52.550> it<00:04:52.819> if<00:04:52.939> it<00:04:53.090> is

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:53.210 
broken it will reactivate it if it is

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:54.969 
broken it will reactivate it if it is
broken<00:04:53.569> it<00:04:53.689> will<00:04:53.810> reactivate<00:04:54.319> it<00:04:54.620> so<00:04:54.800> it's

00:04:54.969 --> 00:04:54.979 
broken it will reactivate it so it's

00:04:54.979 --> 00:04:57.580 
broken it will reactivate it so it's
win-win<00:04:55.990> beyond<00:04:56.990> that<00:04:57.050> you<00:04:57.199> can<00:04:57.349> put<00:04:57.499> your

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:57.590 
win-win beyond that you can put your

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:59.890 
win-win beyond that you can put your
trust<00:04:57.889> in<00:04:58.159> the<00:04:58.340> rapid<00:04:58.969> pulsar<00:04:59.360> if<00:04:59.569> it's<00:04:59.719> not

00:04:59.890 --> 00:04:59.900 
trust in the rapid pulsar if it's not

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:00.909 
trust in the rapid pulsar if it's not
working<00:05:00.080> though<00:05:00.379> you're<00:05:00.560> going<00:05:00.710> to<00:05:00.770> shoot

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:00.919 
working though you're going to shoot

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:03.850 
working though you're going to shoot
right<00:05:01.219> past<00:05:01.520> it<00:05:01.779> there's<00:05:02.779> not<00:05:03.110> really<00:05:03.379> a<00:05:03.500> need

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:03.860 
right past it there's not really a need

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:06.339 
right past it there's not really a need
for<00:05:04.219> a<00:05:04.250> tutorial<00:05:04.550> on<00:05:04.849> this<00:05:04.909> all<00:05:05.689> it<00:05:05.930> is<00:05:06.020> is<00:05:06.199> you

00:05:06.339 --> 00:05:06.349 
for a tutorial on this all it is is you

00:05:06.349 --> 00:05:09.189 
for a tutorial on this all it is is you
have<00:05:06.529> your<00:05:06.680> track<00:05:07.180> that's<00:05:08.180> it<00:05:08.419> you<00:05:09.020> have<00:05:09.169> a

00:05:09.189 --> 00:05:09.199 
have your track that's it you have a

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:12.939 
have your track that's it you have a
need<00:05:09.529> for<00:05:09.770> a<00:05:10.460> slowdown<00:05:11.029> and<00:05:11.590> that<00:05:12.590> is<00:05:12.740> all<00:05:12.919> you

00:05:12.939 --> 00:05:12.949 
need for a slowdown and that is all you

00:05:12.949 --> 00:05:15.309 
need for a slowdown and that is all you
do<00:05:13.159> you<00:05:13.279> put<00:05:13.490> a<00:05:13.550> rapid<00:05:13.969> pulsar<00:05:14.389> on<00:05:14.569> a<00:05:14.629> section

00:05:15.309 --> 00:05:15.319 
do you put a rapid pulsar on a section

00:05:15.319 --> 00:05:16.899 
do you put a rapid pulsar on a section
of<00:05:15.409> track<00:05:15.680> that<00:05:15.949> gives<00:05:16.159> you<00:05:16.340> enough<00:05:16.639> time<00:05:16.669> to

00:05:16.899 --> 00:05:16.909 
of track that gives you enough time to

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:19.629 
of track that gives you enough time to
come<00:05:17.240> to<00:05:17.389> it<00:05:17.569> make<00:05:18.139> a<00:05:18.169> choice<00:05:18.469> and<00:05:18.800> even<00:05:19.400> change

00:05:19.629 --> 00:05:19.639 
come to it make a choice and even change

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:21.579 
come to it make a choice and even change
your<00:05:19.729> mind<00:05:20.000> so<00:05:20.810> we'll<00:05:20.960> do<00:05:21.080> it<00:05:21.229> one<00:05:21.349> more<00:05:21.469> time

00:05:21.579 --> 00:05:21.589 
your mind so we'll do it one more time

00:05:21.589 --> 00:05:23.890 
your mind so we'll do it one more time
show<00:05:22.400> you<00:05:22.460> guys<00:05:22.639> it's<00:05:22.909> not<00:05:23.120> a<00:05:23.150> fluke<00:05:23.479> it's<00:05:23.839> a

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:23.900 
show you guys it's not a fluke it's a

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:26.679 
show you guys it's not a fluke it's a
freaking<00:05:24.409> system<00:05:24.979> slows<00:05:25.849> down<00:05:26.089> I<00:05:26.330> want<00:05:26.539> to<00:05:26.569> go

00:05:26.679 --> 00:05:26.689 
freaking system slows down I want to go

00:05:26.689 --> 00:05:30.339 
freaking system slows down I want to go
right<00:05:26.900> there<00:05:27.589> we<00:05:27.680> go<00:05:27.800> perfect<00:05:28.750> again<00:05:29.750> the

00:05:30.339 --> 00:05:30.349 
right there we go perfect again the

00:05:30.349 --> 00:05:33.670 
right there we go perfect again the
system<00:05:31.250> here<00:05:31.460> it<00:05:31.639> is<00:05:32.210> simply<00:05:32.750> a<00:05:32.779> detector<00:05:33.500> rail

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:33.680 
system here it is simply a detector rail

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:37.240 
system here it is simply a detector rail
with<00:05:34.520> redstone<00:05:34.909> torch<00:05:35.389> as<00:05:35.629> you<00:05:36.349> redstone<00:05:37.099> dust

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:37.250 
with redstone torch as you redstone dust

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:39.309 
with redstone torch as you redstone dust
as<00:05:37.520> you<00:05:37.879> go<00:05:38.029> over<00:05:38.270> this<00:05:38.419> it<00:05:38.810> will<00:05:38.990> activate

00:05:39.309 --> 00:05:39.319 
as you go over this it will activate

00:05:39.319 --> 00:05:41.709 
as you go over this it will activate
this<00:05:39.680> reversing<00:05:40.430> this<00:05:40.610> basically<00:05:41.089> going<00:05:41.419> on

00:05:41.709 --> 00:05:41.719 
this reversing this basically going on

00:05:41.719 --> 00:05:44.769 
this reversing this basically going on
and<00:05:42.020> off<00:05:42.490> it<00:05:43.490> runs<00:05:43.699> all<00:05:43.939> the<00:05:43.969> way<00:05:44.089> into<00:05:44.389> what

00:05:44.769 --> 00:05:44.779 
and off it runs all the way into what

00:05:44.779 --> 00:05:48.369 
and off it runs all the way into what
was<00:05:44.960> here<00:05:45.379> a<00:05:45.409> redstone<00:05:45.979> torch<00:05:46.159> on<00:05:46.990> and<00:05:47.990> off<00:05:48.110> and

00:05:48.369 --> 00:05:48.379 
was here a redstone torch on and off and

00:05:48.379 --> 00:05:51.490 
was here a redstone torch on and off and
then<00:05:49.159> this<00:05:49.310> will<00:05:49.490> turn<00:05:50.029> on<00:05:50.210> and<00:05:50.389> off<00:05:50.479> again<00:05:50.750> how

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:51.500 
then this will turn on and off again how

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:53.559 
then this will turn on and off again how
you<00:05:51.560> want<00:05:51.919> to<00:05:52.009> reset<00:05:52.610> the<00:05:52.789> system<00:05:52.969> up<00:05:53.330> to<00:05:53.360> you

00:05:53.559 --> 00:05:53.569 
you want to reset the system up to you

00:05:53.569 --> 00:05:56.769 
you want to reset the system up to you
guys<00:05:53.599> again<00:05:54.439> if<00:05:54.740> it<00:05:54.860> gets<00:05:55.009> locked<00:05:55.279> up<00:05:55.629> you<00:05:56.629> can

00:05:56.769 --> 00:05:56.779 
guys again if it gets locked up you can

00:05:56.779 --> 00:05:58.869 
guys again if it gets locked up you can
do<00:05:56.899> something<00:05:57.229> as<00:05:57.349> simple<00:05:57.500> as<00:05:57.860> running<00:05:58.279> a<00:05:58.639> line

00:05:58.869 --> 00:05:58.879 
do something as simple as running a line

00:05:58.879 --> 00:06:02.399 
do something as simple as running a line
to<00:05:59.180> it<00:05:59.360> from<00:06:00.259> quite<00:06:00.710> a<00:06:00.740> ways<00:06:00.979> away<00:06:01.009> obviously

00:06:02.399 --> 00:06:02.409 
to it from quite a ways away obviously

00:06:02.409 --> 00:06:05.889 
to it from quite a ways away obviously
grabbing<00:06:03.409> a<00:06:03.500> lever<00:06:03.710> for<00:06:04.009> example<00:06:04.520> and<00:06:04.899> just

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:05.899 
grabbing a lever for example and just

00:06:05.899 --> 00:06:09.100 
grabbing a lever for example and just
saying<00:06:06.110> on<00:06:06.259> off<00:06:06.500> and<00:06:06.830> it<00:06:07.310> will<00:06:07.399> reset<00:06:07.789> it<00:06:08.110> that

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:09.110 
saying on off and it will reset it that

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:10.659 
saying on off and it will reset it that
kind<00:06:09.349> of<00:06:09.409> is<00:06:09.589> up<00:06:09.740> to<00:06:09.860> you<00:06:09.979> guys<00:06:10.009> like<00:06:10.339> I<00:06:10.460> said

until I t13 came out so yeah but this is

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:18.459 
until I t13 came out so yeah but this is
the<00:06:16.639> simple<00:06:17.000> track<00:06:17.210> selector<00:06:17.659> guys<00:06:17.839> I<00:06:18.080> hope

00:06:18.459 --> 00:06:18.469 
the simple track selector guys I hope

00:06:18.469 --> 00:06:19.990 
the simple track selector guys I hope
