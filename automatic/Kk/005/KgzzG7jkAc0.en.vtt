00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 Hi, I'm the dani from the bossi kitchen channel. 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.990
 chilli creator and site editor 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.950
 specialized in confectionery and 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.440
 onwards 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.719
 and here I can the most delicious sweets 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.059
 Welcome to the internet, sweet. 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.890
 kitchens from our memory a dessert 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.830
 that is nothing more than a 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.140
 sandwich consisting of two cookies 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.090
 the marshmallow melted in the middle and a 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.789
 bar of chocolate on top of the sea 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.380
 slipper is very tasty and very chubby 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.150
 For you to eat watching tv 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.850
 you can buy all the ingredients 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.480
 in the supermarket and just put together and do the 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.250
 your property 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.070
 Now I 'll teach you how to do the 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.110
 biscuit and a variation with peach 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.530
 with those without chocolate it will get a 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.530
 madryn 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.690
 I'm going to start making some cookies. 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.899
 I will only need sugar for him. 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.789
 flour the people and butter or 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.379
 I'm sure you have everything at home. 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.239
 If you want you can use a 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.800
 little cinnamon to season too 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.910
 your cookie but how I wore a 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.739
 top hat 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.840
 I find the neutral taste of the biscuit better 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.589
 not to fight with a little 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.840
 Federal Police 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.240
 the biscuit to use two-thirds cup 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.250
 of sugar 1 cup and three quarters of 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.380
 wheat flour if you want all the 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.970
 ingredients in grams with there on the site o 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.310
 revenue link is down here at 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.960
 Description a pinch of salt I go 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.790
 mix all these errors here with the 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.890
 hand but just to study 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.750
 even before putting the butter and the 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.840
 egg that will then move everything by hand 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:31.490
 same lapse so do not worry about 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.490
 every food stick a hand in the dough 

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:42.020
 some tips in this mass are precious 

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:43.460
 first butter has to be in 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.409
 ambient temperature 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.939
 then about a little flour in the 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:49.009
 bottom of your bowl 

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:51.049
 You can only look at your hand a little bit. 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:53.060
 and pass in the dough you will see that 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:54.859
 she will stick it all this happens 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.750
 because sometimes the flour is drier 

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:58.219
 depending on the day you arise you have more dryness 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.109
 flour becomes drier if it has 

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:02.270
 more humid the family becomes more human and 

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:04.340
 Finally the interesting thing is you cover 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:08.060
 with a plastic film that leads to 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:10.640
 refrigerator for two hours or up to 24 hours 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:13.069
 very good if you can leave 24 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.140
 even better for its mass and 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:17.120
 not with two hours down then 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.549
 keep dough from the refrigerator leave 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.709
 ten minutes outside where we already 

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:24.440
 because it will get a little easier 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:26.150
 Another cool tip is not to open the dough with 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.829
 the flour has a lot of people ends in March 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.319
 with affection I prefer to open the dough 

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:32.810
 between two pieces of buttered paper 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:35.090
 this way you do not use much flour and 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.739
 Do not leave the sea just so dry my 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.750
 I opened with half a centimeter of 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:40.579
 thick and now I'll cut with the 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:43.930
 cookie cutter does not fit 

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:43.930
 You can cut with whatever you want 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.720
 I took my pasta for five minutes. 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.770
 by freezers since this my oven to 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.720
 180 degrees 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:58.390
 I took my writings from the freezer 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:01.060
 I highlighted them from the mass I put in 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:03.130
 otherwise with another baking paper 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.990
 about one to two fingers of 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.430
 distance from each other because when they 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:08.680
 to the oven they can 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:11.680
 spread a little bit as it is today 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:14.320
 very hot I'm still going to leave another 15 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.160
 minutes in the freezer and then take it straight 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.650
 to the oven 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:20.020
 If it's a coldest day, how are you? 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:22.240
 highlighted its shape and there already takes 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:24.610
 straight to is those little machines that 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:27.280
 left where you cut yourself 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:32.770
 You can put it all together again and use it 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:34.810
 once more my things became more 

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:36.820
 or less 30 minutes in the oven 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:39.280
 You'll take out when their balls 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:41.770
 they start to look a bit golden 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.930
 still not going to be completely hard and 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:46.360
 then you take it out of shape and 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:48.910
 grilled to dissect in the grill of the stay 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:51.100
 very dry when it cools is that 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:53.110
 it will get crunchy and in consistency 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:55.720
 ideal for you to eat my 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:04:02.470
 Japanese principles washed and I'll cut 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:05.950
 sliced ​​so a little my yes because 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:08.350
 If they tear you apart, you wake up and then 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:10.989
 I'll make my little honey to pass. 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:13.060
 peaches and fries in butter 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:16.750
 just to give a little taste to one more 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:18.820
 little more light light recipe 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:23.880
 It's not a very interesting program. 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:23.880
 This is not my program either. 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:32.310
 I'm going to mix everything now with my hand and 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:39.060
 then pass each slice of peach 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:40.920
 sugar and after passing the 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:44.010
