00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:13.589
 on the right flank and could still observe the lesson is not 

00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:16.779
 available are HDR Efex pro 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:18.650
 whole adjustments 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:20.589
 could be the first we have up there 

00:00:20.589 --> 00:00:22.480
 the Kunert compression 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.169
 which goes from -100 to plus one hundred percent 

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:28.759
 and that's nothing else 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:32.709
 the compression from 32 bits to 16 or 8 bits 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.860
 on the Schletter scree double victories it will be more automatically back to 9% 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.030
 posed 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.690
 and here below are all the customizations of the Enscheder Global 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.690
 that means I am always a shiver then we can 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.160
 Approved for general change from the tech sector BZ Mr. RA 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:52.380
 Kinderhaus also here the HDR procedure 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:54.550
 do not just look in here 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:57.550
 10b the different HDR methods can be selected 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.790
 or the whole ultimately also relocated IV adapt 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:04.750
 that means all adjustments in the global area 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:07.880
 We can also selectively use control points on specific areas 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.140
 CHF 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.060
 and finally have the possibility to add a vignette 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:18.740
 or directly here in Kronberg i go to the purchases and for example an escort 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:19.890
 create 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.440
 but before the one on the right touch something 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.870
 Gimma mostly from the left side out of our presets 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:31.820
 which we can select here in the different categories if I am 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.880
 me go here on the map most part 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.620
 and be able to put on the picture by the money and then he started already 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:41.619
 the right side that something has happened 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.060
 Here come immediately a change displayed as well as in the 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.520
 global adjustments if I open here all the time then we have to 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.460
 Example, the HDR method sharp what previously stood on natural 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.450
 So had a change within our borders 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.970
 Adjustments the exposure contrast the fact 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.450
 if I go back again 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.720
 the default is that everything goes back to zero 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:09.969
 percent 

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:13.249
 This means that a constant communication takes place here 

00:02:13.249 --> 00:02:17.109
 we choose and, first of all, a preset on the left side 

00:02:17.109 --> 00:02:21.019
 and see what has been changed here now can then 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:25.519
 Of course, even intervene and, for example, the exposure Global 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:27.439
 regulate 

00:02:27.439 --> 00:02:29.119
 the checkpoint 

00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:32.119
 a certain area here anyway 

00:02:32.679 --> 00:02:35.169
 edit separately 

00:02:35.169 --> 00:02:38.169
 as well as the consumption here concluding 

00:02:39.939 --> 00:02:45.569
 the tonal values ​​can go and here, for example, a slight buy it offers 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:47.689
 to get more contrast in the game
