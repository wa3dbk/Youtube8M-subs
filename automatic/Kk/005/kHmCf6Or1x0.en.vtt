00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:07.529
 health dear gorod niki today we 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:11.910
 we will plant early cabbage here 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:15.389
 seedlings we grew in a hotbed of pro 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:19.050
 which you can see here it is 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:22.580
 I have grown up and today you can already in 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:26.369
 principle and land now beginning of may 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:27.960
 it was already warm weather 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.230
 she even shoot a little earlier but 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:34.730
 nothing she will quite have time to grow 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:37.670
 very good I want to say about 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:42.050
 land on which it is better to plant 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:45.570
 cabbage any and I'm in the fact that cabbage 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:47.820
 love a little alkaline soil that is 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.550
 it naturally grows very poorly on 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.699
 heavy loamy soils and even more 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:57.690
 sour them so the soil is pre 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:01:00.390
 better to deoxidize even if you think 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:03.899
 that she and so you basically good 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:06.810
 still add room there and or 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:10.409
 chalk so she was a little bit even 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.689
 alkaline what else i want to say here 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.720
 in this garden 

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:17.700
 the predecessor was on purpose she is still 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.439
 deadens the soil and very good 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.650
 predecessor for cabbage 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:26.189
 so the bed I naturally do not dig 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:29.040
 I don't dig it 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:32.189
 you can see i'm left with her hack 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.610
 flat cut and straight into this garden bed now 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:38.369
 I will land 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:43.100
 previously cabbage have planted it very 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:44.509
 just naturally we do a little 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:49.870
 hole 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:52.760
 in this way we water 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:57.740
 not quite so cold 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:02:00.920
 temperature water and with a lump i 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:04.660
 just got it so as not to injure 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:08.800
 root system right here so here we are 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:10.580
 planted in this water and a little bit 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:16.310
 just a little bit 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:18.800
 push all the bush we have planted 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.960
 it should be as follows 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.600
 be planted and staggered through 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:25.970
 50 centimeters so I cooked a stick 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:28.970
 I have 50 centimeters so the next one 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:32.900
 i can then hand land the land very soft 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:36.160
 and loose to make a hole in 50 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:38.570
 centimeters and on the contrary I will also 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:41.690
 plant cabbage 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:44.480
 but already in chess order here we are 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:47.440
 kosy take here it is right with such here 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:53.290
 spines as you see here they are white 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:55.790
 everything is fresh so that we donâ€™t have it 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:59.000
 slowed down in its development 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:01.820
 she literally just now here I am 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.090
 I took it out a little bit 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:06.560
 breeding ground and I will plant 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:10.220
 all the next here 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:14.290
 opposite between these two we will be here 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:21.250
 so here we will plant another bush and 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:25.780
 on it we will finish the Christmas tree and dust 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:29.860
 already tell a little later 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:35.770
 when we cared for her 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:38.800
 in this way I landed you can 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:40.840
 say early cabbage what else do I want 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.910
 say a little addition after 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:44.560
 landings improve the priteenit so I 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:47.380
 Now I will use this one 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:50.020
 I will cover the whole bed see on 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:51.760
 I am covered with arcs but will not 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:54.670
 completely cover the temperature to 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.470
 it was normal for her to air 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:57.820
 the tank will be open just be 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:00.820
 shading such 

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:04.660
 and for that alone it helps a lot from 

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:06.490
 especially so when we are only 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:10.440
 that landed still on the delicate leaves 

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:15.160
 often earthen flea 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:17.890
 which is great, and sometimes spoiled but 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.400
 such shading protects very well 

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:22.780
 exactly 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:26.350
 experience and attack now the time has come 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:28.680
 ripening early cabbage is very good 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:32.050
 I showed myself here 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:35.950
 automatic watering cabbage loves 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:38.740
 vlok as you know but this year 

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:42.250
 I had to fight a lot with 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:46.110
 cabbage moth fought fiercely native 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:53.350
 means it's arrows of garlic 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:56.740
 tomato cups tobacco pepper this 

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:59.260
 all with soap still in addition all this i 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:01.960
 mixed insisted and constantly 

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:04.870
 sprayed but no matter how you see 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:07.780
 a little bit of course mole somewhere a little bit to 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:13.060
 start nibbled but nothing terrible but 

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:16.090
 I didn't use any chemistry 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:24.150
 in principle has grown pretty good 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:24.150
 Now we have a club cut one swinging 

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:35.220
 free him from the bad 

00:05:50.580 --> 00:06:00.430
 here such that we have a lot of legs here will 

00:05:56.290 --> 00:06:03.600
 use looking today for allegiance 

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:06.760
 maybe tomorrow we will do fools 

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:11.640
 planned here so grows to start 

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:15.060
 using automatic watering 

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:18.820
 principle ok so does it grow on 

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:21.760
 fertilized bedding heat here i'm 

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:25.030
 more hall carried away and cabbage loves 

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:31.260
 such a slightly alkaline soil therefore 

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:34.480
 everything grew well except if not 

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:37.450
 cabbage mole with which was right 

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:38.080
 such a struggle this year probably because 

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:41.590
 due to the fact that 

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:44.530
 May, it was very hot here she probably you 

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:47.560
 the prince we never had this misfortune in 

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:51.430
 this year there is not even a scoop cabbage but 

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:56.229
 there were a lot of them but 

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:59.250
 nothing coped with this task all 

00:06:56.229 --> 00:06:59.250
 good harvest yet
