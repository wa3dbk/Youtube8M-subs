00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:32.180 
okay we have another option for

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.549 
okay we have another option for

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:02.089 
our cable and this Way's we will see

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:06.490 
our cable and this Way's we will see
later<00:01:02.390> on<00:01:02.780> our<00:01:02.930> screen<00:01:03.470> and<00:01:04.510> when<00:01:05.510> we<00:01:05.750> set<00:01:06.350> the

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:06.500 
later on our screen and when we set the

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.280 
later on our screen and when we set the
cursors<00:01:06.979> peak<00:01:07.340> to<00:01:07.549> peak<00:01:07.580> for<00:01:08.240> one<00:01:08.420> complete

wave<00:01:10.330> we<00:01:11.330> will<00:01:11.540> get<00:01:11.690> an<00:01:11.840> information<00:01:12.110> about

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:13.010 
wave we will get an information about

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:16.050 
wave we will get an information about
the<00:01:13.340> distance<00:01:13.790> from<00:01:13.939> here<00:01:14.840> to<00:01:14.900> our<00:01:15.500> failure

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:16.060 
the distance from here to our failure

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.740 
the distance from here to our failure
this<00:01:17.060> is<00:01:17.119> also<00:01:17.479> a<00:01:17.659> method<00:01:18.200> we<00:01:18.560> can<00:01:18.710> use<00:01:19.750> in

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
this is also a method we can use in

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.240 
this is also a method we can use in
every<00:01:21.020> kind<00:01:21.260> of<00:01:21.640> high<00:01:22.640> resistance<00:01:22.880> fault<00:01:23.570> and

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.250 
every kind of high resistance fault and

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.270 
every kind of high resistance fault and
but<00:01:25.250> not<00:01:25.400> in<00:01:25.580> low<00:01:25.729> resistance<00:01:26.299> fault<00:01:26.920> okay<00:01:27.920> so

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.280 
but not in low resistance fault okay so

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:29.109 
but not in low resistance fault okay so
let's<00:01:28.549> try<00:01:28.790> it

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:29.119 
let's try it

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:33.090 
let's try it
switch<00:01:30.080> on<00:01:30.320> IC<00:01:30.799> e<00:01:31.090> select<00:01:32.090> the<00:01:32.240> output<00:01:32.540> voltage

in<00:01:48.590> this<00:01:48.980> mode<00:01:49.280> you<00:01:49.310> also<00:01:49.700> adjust<00:01:50.510> the

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:50.690 
in this mode you also adjust the

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:55.090 
in this mode you also adjust the
displayed<00:01:51.760> range<00:01:52.760> of<00:01:53.180> your<00:01:53.930> cable<00:01:54.380> it<00:01:54.740> is<00:01:54.950> now

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
displayed range of your cable it is now

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.910 
displayed range of your cable it is now
three<00:01:55.670> kilometers<00:01:56.300> we<00:01:56.930> can<00:01:57.140> start<00:01:57.530> with<00:01:57.710> this

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
three kilometers we can start with this

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.980 
three kilometers we can start with this
and<00:01:58.190> if<00:01:58.340> the<00:01:58.490> picture<00:01:58.820> is<00:01:58.880> not<00:01:59.000> okay<00:01:59.360> we<00:01:59.780> can

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990 
and if the picture is not okay we can

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.210 
and if the picture is not okay we can
decrease<00:02:00.350> or<00:02:00.620> increase<00:02:00.970> the<00:02:01.970> cable<00:02:02.300> velocity

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:03.220 
decrease or increase the cable velocity

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:07.570 
decrease or increase the cable velocity
is<00:02:04.220> same<00:02:04.550> this<00:02:04.820> is<00:02:05.000> still<00:02:05.810> the<00:02:05.990> same<00:02:06.260> like<00:02:06.620> by

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 
is same this is still the same like by

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.030 
is same this is still the same like by
TDR<00:02:08.119> because<00:02:08.750> the<00:02:08.930> same<00:02:09.110> kind<00:02:09.380> of<00:02:09.470> cable<00:02:09.860> now

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:10.040 
TDR because the same kind of cable now

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:13.180 
TDR because the same kind of cable now
so<00:02:10.369> we<00:02:10.790> haven't<00:02:10.970> adjust<00:02:11.360> anything<00:02:11.870> and<00:02:12.190> the

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
so we haven't adjust anything and the

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.490 
so we haven't adjust anything and the
distance<00:02:13.550> marker<00:02:13.940> we<00:02:14.090> will<00:02:14.240> see<00:02:14.420> later<00:02:14.600> when

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
distance marker we will see later when

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.530 
distance marker we will see later when
we<00:02:15.530> get<00:02:16.520> the<00:02:16.670> picture<00:02:17.060> okay<00:02:17.540> high<00:02:17.780> voltage<00:02:18.140> on

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
we get the picture okay high voltage on

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.770 
we get the picture okay high voltage on
my<00:02:20.540> voltage<00:02:20.900> is<00:02:21.110> on<00:02:21.380> red<00:02:21.980> light<00:02:22.190> is<00:02:22.340> blinking

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
my voltage is on red light is blinking

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.100 
my voltage is on red light is blinking
now<00:02:23.780> we<00:02:23.840> are<00:02:24.140> setting<00:02:24.620> the<00:02:24.650> output<00:02:25.160> voltage<00:02:25.580> a

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
now we are setting the output voltage a

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:32.290 
now we are setting the output voltage a
kV<00:02:27.110> now<00:02:27.980> we<00:02:28.040> will<00:02:28.250> give<00:02:28.400> one<00:02:28.670> shot<00:02:30.820> and<00:02:31.820> you<00:02:32.090> see

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300 
kV now we will give one shot and you see

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.590 
kV now we will give one shot and you see
a<00:02:32.330> picture<00:02:32.690> on<00:02:33.230> the<00:02:33.370> screen<00:02:34.370> but<00:02:35.210> you<00:02:35.270> see<00:02:35.570> a

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 
a picture on the screen but you see a

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.080 
a picture on the screen but you see a
lot<00:02:35.780> of<00:02:35.930> curves<00:02:36.230> and<00:02:36.620> the<00:02:37.310> information<00:02:37.880> is<00:02:37.970> not

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
lot of curves and the information is not

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.320 
lot of curves and the information is not
so<00:02:38.300> easy<00:02:38.480> to<00:02:38.600> get<00:02:39.010> because<00:02:40.010> of<00:02:40.220> the<00:02:40.460> big<00:02:41.000> range

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330 
so easy to get because of the big range

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.130 
so easy to get because of the big range
so<00:02:41.810> let's<00:02:42.260> go<00:02:42.470> back<00:02:42.710> without<00:02:43.960> switching<00:02:44.960> off

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
so let's go back without switching off

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.890 
so let's go back without switching off
the<00:02:45.170> high<00:02:45.620> voltage<00:02:46.040> we<00:02:46.970> can<00:02:47.000> change<00:02:47.510> now<00:02:47.840> the

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
the high voltage we can change now the

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.830 
the high voltage we can change now the
display<00:02:48.530> the<00:02:49.370> display<00:02:49.640> range<00:02:50.060> and<00:02:50.510> you<00:02:50.630> see

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
display the display range and you see

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:55.680 
display the display range and you see
now<00:02:51.050> you<00:02:51.110> will<00:02:51.350> get<00:02:51.500> a<00:02:51.770> better<00:02:52.760> picture

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:05.150 

okay<00:02:57.210> confirm<00:02:58.530> let's<00:02:59.530> give<00:02:59.740> it<00:03:01.920> was<00:03:02.920> a<00:03:02.950> thumb

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
okay confirm let's give it was a thumb

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.370 
okay confirm let's give it was a thumb
okay<00:03:06.160> picture<00:03:06.730> is<00:03:06.940> the<00:03:07.120> same<00:03:07.390> so<00:03:07.750> it<00:03:07.870> confirms

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
okay picture is the same so it confirms

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:12.360 
okay picture is the same so it confirms
that<00:03:09.420> nothing<00:03:10.420> changes<00:03:10.960> and<00:03:11.290> the<00:03:11.980> fold<00:03:12.220> is

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
that nothing changes and the fold is

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:16.110 
that nothing changes and the fold is
still<00:03:12.550> at<00:03:12.670> the<00:03:12.790> same<00:03:12.970> position<00:03:13.480> and<00:03:13.840> now<00:03:15.120> we

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
still at the same position and now we

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:24.060 
still at the same position and now we
can<00:03:16.980> go<00:03:17.980> back<00:03:18.250> to<00:03:19.650> distance<00:03:20.650> marker<00:03:21.270> and<00:03:23.070> we

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.070 
can go back to distance marker and we

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:26.370 
can go back to distance marker and we
shift<00:03:24.370> the<00:03:24.550> cause<00:03:24.790> that<00:03:24.820> means<00:03:25.300> we<00:03:25.690> put<00:03:25.930> now

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380 
shift the cause that means we put now

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.870 
shift the cause that means we put now
this<00:03:27.250> curve<00:03:27.610> we<00:03:28.540> move<00:03:28.750> this<00:03:28.960> peak<00:03:29.770> to<00:03:30.700> this

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:30.880 
this curve we move this peak to this

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:35.570 
this curve we move this peak to this
peak<00:03:31.210> and<00:03:31.990> I<00:03:32.530> will<00:03:33.190> show<00:03:33.370> you<00:03:33.540> shift<00:03:34.540> curves<00:03:34.870> oh

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:35.580 
peak and I will show you shift curves oh

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:39.780 
peak and I will show you shift curves oh
you<00:03:36.580> see<00:03:36.850> I<00:03:37.120> move<00:03:38.080> it<00:03:38.290> so<00:03:38.980> there<00:03:39.250> are<00:03:39.370> the<00:03:39.550> same

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
you see I move it so there are the same

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:48.730 
you see I move it so there are the same
now<00:03:40.000> and<00:03:40.810> now<00:03:41.050> we<00:03:41.110> would<00:03:41.470> see

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:48.740 

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:52.340 

okay<00:03:49.160> I<00:03:49.190> must<00:03:49.430> do<00:03:49.730> it<00:03:49.790> okay

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.350 
okay I must do it okay

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:57.940 
okay I must do it okay
confirm<00:03:53.040> my<00:03:53.730> farm<00:03:54.320> first<00:03:55.320> have<00:03:55.530> to<00:03:55.710> set<00:03:55.950> zero

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:57.950 
confirm my farm first have to set zero

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:03.870 
confirm my farm first have to set zero
now<00:03:58.459> I<00:03:58.490> have<00:03:58.730> to<00:03:58.910> shift

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:03.880 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:07.780 

yes

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:07.790 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:10.990 

you<00:04:08.299> see<00:04:08.569> the<00:04:09.079> distance<00:04:09.469> is<00:04:09.680> 10<00:04:09.890> meters<00:04:10.340> this

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.000 
you see the distance is 10 meters this

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.190 
you see the distance is 10 meters this
is<00:04:11.060> not<00:04:11.390> a<00:04:11.659> real<00:04:12.469> good<00:04:12.680> sample<00:04:13.159> because<00:04:13.930> we<00:04:14.930> set

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:15.200 
is not a real good sample because we set

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:19.060 
is not a real good sample because we set
a<00:04:15.230> zero<00:04:15.379> point<00:04:15.980> zero<00:04:16.280> point<00:04:16.940> means<00:04:17.859> the<00:04:18.859> system

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.070 
a zero point zero point means the system

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:24.129 
a zero point zero point means the system
is<00:04:21.490> calculating<00:04:22.490> the<00:04:22.520> length<00:04:22.820> of<00:04:23.120> the<00:04:23.389> fault

00:04:24.129 --> 00:04:24.139 
is calculating the length of the fault

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:26.710 
is calculating the length of the fault
from<00:04:24.530> the<00:04:24.710> cable<00:04:25.130> end<00:04:25.340> of<00:04:25.699> our<00:04:26.270> high-voltage

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:26.720 
from the cable end of our high-voltage

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:29.710 
from the cable end of our high-voltage
cable<00:04:27.560> drum<00:04:27.770> from<00:04:28.639> this<00:04:28.850> connection<00:04:29.300> point<00:04:29.330> to

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:29.720 
cable drum from this connection point to

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:33.100 
cable drum from this connection point to
the<00:04:29.930> real<00:04:30.110> fault<00:04:30.470> but<00:04:31.160> in<00:04:31.400> our<00:04:31.580> case<00:04:31.910> it<00:04:32.449> is<00:04:32.509> the

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:33.110 
the real fault but in our case it is the

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:35.200 
the real fault but in our case it is the
same<00:04:33.350> point<00:04:33.710> that's<00:04:34.370> the<00:04:34.460> reason<00:04:34.880> why<00:04:35.030> we

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.210 
same point that's the reason why we

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:37.719 
same point that's the reason why we
don't<00:04:35.419> have<00:04:35.690> a<00:04:35.990> big<00:04:36.590> distance<00:04:36.979> to<00:04:37.220> our<00:04:37.370> fault

00:04:37.719 --> 00:04:37.729 
don't have a big distance to our fault

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:41.650 
don't have a big distance to our fault
because<00:04:38.710> it<00:04:39.710> is<00:04:39.889> too<00:04:40.070> late<00:04:40.220> at<00:04:41.030> the<00:04:41.270> end<00:04:41.389> of<00:04:41.509> our

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:41.660 
because it is too late at the end of our

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:45.129 
because it is too late at the end of our
high-voltage<00:04:42.289> cable<00:04:43.099> drum<00:04:43.599> but<00:04:44.599> you<00:04:44.720> see<00:04:44.930> how

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:45.139 
high-voltage cable drum but you see how

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:50.730 
high-voltage cable drum but you see how
to<00:04:45.199> use<00:04:45.349> it<00:04:45.560> you<00:04:46.039> must<00:04:46.310> move<00:04:47.020> and<00:04:48.020> set<00:04:48.800> one<00:04:49.789> peak

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:50.740 
to use it you must move and set one peak

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:53.770 
to use it you must move and set one peak
to<00:04:51.740> the<00:04:51.770> next<00:04:51.919> and<00:04:52.460> the<00:04:53.150> distance<00:04:53.570> we

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:53.780 
to the next and the distance we

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:59.470 
to the next and the distance we
mentioned<00:04:54.229> here<00:04:55.180> okay<00:04:56.180> that's<00:04:56.509> it<00:04:56.750> for<00:04:56.780> I<00:04:57.259> see
