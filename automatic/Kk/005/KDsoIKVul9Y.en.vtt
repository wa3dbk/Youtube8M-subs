00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:08.380
 montÃ¨l and two high and tell is just 

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:09.640
 one of apple and comes on the market 

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:11.380
 once from samsung we have them both 

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:14.710
 hands i'm talking about the apple ipad air 

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:15.370
 ns samsung galaxy note 10 point one 2014 

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:16.720
 edition 

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:18.669
 a whole mouth full but out I would have one 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.900
 interesting tablet have already been reviewed 

00:00:18.669 --> 00:00:21.609
 we also have a video that made a lot 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.109
 with the ipad air are currently on the 

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:24.939
 review and will soon also have a video 

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:26.439
 sweetheart coming online but it will be you 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:27.249
 high time to have these two boys with 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:28.989
 to compare each other 

00:00:27.249 --> 00:00:31.599
 let's look at the 

00:00:28.989 --> 00:00:33.190
 specifications and construction 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:34.750
 apple ipad air is made of aluminum 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:35.680
 like that actually always have 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:36.940
 be used to it 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.290
 the entire back is actually one 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.130
 large aluminum surface and it looks very 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:40.000
 nice looking 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:41.590
 it has also become a bit thinner 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.570
 then its predecessor and keep it pretty 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:44.770
 nice and firm are still complete and edges 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.510
 protection just a little thinner 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:47.620
 become and then hesitant high screen 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:49.450
 created 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.830
 that's pretty nice such details true 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:52.900
 the tablet a dreams that made stories 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:54.670
 more but the finish is really special 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.630
 good and the edges are all around 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:56.800
 cut 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:57.970
 which with a diamond thingy 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.810
 giving a really nice edge 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:00.489
 creates 

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:02.410
 all in all, the construction of the ipad air is thick 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:04.929
 in order the top you see another white 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:06.789
 dash that the lt also received that 

00:01:04.929 --> 00:01:08.229
 This tablet is present and is of course 

00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:09.999
 also the communion samsung galaxy note ii 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:11.619
 immediately present samsung has before 

00:01:09.999 --> 00:01:13.960
 chosen to be Galaxy Note II point one 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:15.490
 Equipping the 2014 edition in plastic 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.840
 these plastic are a bit 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:18.280
 because they have one 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.990
 inherited motif enabling the net from 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.789
 looks like leather but it stays to it 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.229
 just plastic from the end of the day 

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:24.969
 lace at the front is just a big one 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:26.679
 Glass plate also has creative thin 

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:28.630
 edges around the screen one to the 

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:30.490
 side slightly thicker than that of ipad air 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.259
 all in all it is tablet that is reasonable 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.119
 Sturdy rule Sturdy and also 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:35.439
 just pretty good holds the 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:36.819
 deviation is a bit less 

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:38.590
 Also the finish of the border around the 

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:40.659
 device is also enough of plastic 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.130
 looks of aluminum wash all 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:44.139
 just plastic and that is of course not 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.420
 as solid as this beautiful device from 

00:01:44.139 --> 00:01:48.579
 the ipad air must be said that 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.679
 big disadvantage of the ipad air is that 

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:52.539
 it a very fast force already in their army 

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:54.249
 is it also brushed aluminum 

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:56.049
 but as soon as you give it to a child 

00:01:54.249 --> 00:01:57.819
 closed over to the over coin or 

00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:59.319
 whatever you will notice that it is whole 

00:01:57.819 --> 00:02:00.999
 scratch so quickly and that is for many 

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:03.009
 People disadvantage if you also follow one now 

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:03.909
 iPad picks up the year old and one 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:05.529
 family has located 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:07.450
 Then you will see that he has a lot of choice 

00:02:05.529 --> 00:02:09.070
 and at this glitch no type it one 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.690
 that is less likely to be a plastic case 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:11.190
 that there 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.200
 very sensitive to something flew 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.550
 sensitive to snow 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.230
 as the players card of both tablets 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.820
 compare with each other then they are 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.870
 fairly well matched 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:21.030
 I think you type it a hot one 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.430
 resolution of 50 60 times 16 100 pixels 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.170
 with a team point one, the screen is the ipad 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:28.650
 air just a little lower that you know 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:30.540
 2048 by 1536 with the 9-point 7 inch 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.890
 screen blank with 7 in screen is actually 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.210
 just as big as taking something 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.950
 in benin screen 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:36.630
 furthermore not so much of it 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.790
 but the quay resolution are different 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.620
 something very much case note has something 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.660
 higher resolution but the screen for 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.980
 both tablets is really particularly beautiful the 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.840
 brightness of the galaxy note can live 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.310
 bit higher not the ipad air but 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.200
 nevertheless there are fine or satisfied 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.970
 both screens and also some touch input and 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.890
 sponsors and is actually nothing 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.060
 both to be considered 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.140
 then go according to look at the eyes 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.000
 Specifications 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.590
 ipad air is equipped with the new ace 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.870
 process of helping on these pieces 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.820
 Powerful like is the 64-bit processor 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.710
 that in combination with those we seven that 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:06.090
 Religions and freeze teeth are also a concern 

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:08.010
 for that he just again very fast 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:10.140
 performance knows how to put it one 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:12.090
 go outside ram and that a7 processor core 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.770
 processor that is going to be figi at a point 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.570
 we do but the tablet is still 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:18.630
 unprecedentedly quicker than being 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:20.400
 predecessor samsung galaxy note 10 point 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.590
 one has the 2014 edition of 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.989
 qualcomm 806 word is a quad core 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:27.120
 processor work two point three 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:29.340
 gijs actually has 3 gigabytes 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.690
 to ram and I would say so for that 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.830
 me so with care for very fast 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.330
 performance 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:34.680
 is unfortunately not always true 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:36.420
 despite running on and killing fype 3 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.640
 Buffalo brands often go a few more times 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:40.019
 and just looks like that samsung 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.540
 interface that you have over it 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:43.920
 recently the touch my that is actually not 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:45.900
 have optimized that is pretty well 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.630
 pity but the ipad air went and went 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:50.250
 Never bothered by anything like one 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:52.230
 application that is actually always maintained 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.430
 and call the emergency team is one point 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:55.380
 that is the case 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.970
 applications sometimes falter at most 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.989
 strange place in my now he goes too 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.370
 for example, faltering 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:01.050
 once you have an application you work 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:02.459
 just flawless but is still just 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:04.320
 not so high but see it as the ipad 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:05.730
 air and what do you really notice that 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:07.260
 such a big downside 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:09.420
 samsung has another asset over a swan 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.950
 and that the new note puts a pen 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:13.140
 of course never the management 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:13.440
 shit know this pen that really works very well 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:15.239
 nice 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.560
 it is very sensitive can make you very nice 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:18.479
 draw along and are really a few 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.389
 handy application especially if you have one 

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:21.829
 creative moment than six yes no 

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:24.229
 it's a very interesting thanks to this 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:25.819
 esp and there are some very nice ones 

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:28.789
 functions on that certainly considering 

00:04:25.819 --> 00:04:31.039
 then another thing worth the camera 

00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:32.419
 can really shoot the full HD videos 

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:34.279
 very good from the picture 

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:35.840
 samsung it ensured and led to the 

00:04:34.279 --> 00:04:37.789
 backside child of the get chino type it 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:39.259
 one that does not have the ipad air again 

00:04:37.789 --> 00:04:40.999
 of course the question which tablet would you like 

00:04:39.259 --> 00:04:43.340
 currently recommend 

00:04:40.999 --> 00:04:44.539
 we would go for the apple ipad air 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:45.139
 the reason for that is actually pretty good 

00:04:44.539 --> 00:04:46.340
 simple 

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:48.770
 the ipad somewhere better construction 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:50.539
 got a67 in combination with the 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:52.490
 new processor is really very fast 

00:04:50.539 --> 00:04:53.779
 he does not seem to confess and pharmacy 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:56.180
 just the ones at the end of the ride 

00:04:53.779 --> 00:04:57.439
 he just got a better tablet for the 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:59.479
 four grabbed the facebook time more 

00:04:57.439 --> 00:05:00.590
 then I am very snowteam point one but 

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:02.330
 it 's just a shame this dodge 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:04.189
 it is immediately finished when leakage shows 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:06.289
 not so fast there is lesser construction 

00:05:04.189 --> 00:05:08.620
 did we for the apple ipad air 

00:05:06.289 --> 00:05:08.620
 choose
