browning 12.7 mm machine guns so we're

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.470 
browning 12.7 mm machine guns so we're
going<00:00:31.740> to<00:00:31.980> try<00:00:32.340> a<00:00:32.430> test<00:00:32.880> flight<00:00:33.000> in<00:00:33.120> this<00:00:33.329> and

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
going to try a test flight in this and

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.930 
going to try a test flight in this and
realistic<00:00:33.930> battles<00:00:34.050> and<00:00:34.579> see<00:00:35.579> how<00:00:35.730> it<00:00:35.820> does

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
realistic battles and see how it does

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.840 
realistic battles and see how it does
the<00:00:36.690> dev<00:00:36.870> server<00:00:37.050> did<00:00:37.410> set<00:00:37.829> our<00:00:38.010> accounts<00:00:38.610> back

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
the dev server did set our accounts back

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.729 
the dev server did set our accounts back
to<00:00:39.030> what<00:00:39.239> they<00:00:39.390> were<00:00:39.420> before<00:00:40.070> the<00:00:41.070> summer<00:00:41.370> and

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:42.739 
to what they were before the summer and

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:45.500 
to what they were before the summer and
so<00:00:43.739> right<00:00:44.100> now<00:00:44.129> it<00:00:44.340> shows<00:00:44.579> that<00:00:44.850> oh<00:00:45.030> actually<00:00:45.300> I

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
so right now it shows that oh actually I

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.000 
so right now it shows that oh actually I
think<00:00:45.600> they<00:00:45.870> just<00:00:45.899> updated<00:00:46.230> it<00:00:46.559> because<00:00:46.680> it

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
think they just updated it because it

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.529 
think they just updated it because it
just<00:00:47.129> switched<00:00:47.430> from<00:00:47.550> level<00:00:47.879> 60<00:00:48.180> something

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
just switched from level 60 something

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.510 
just switched from level 60 something
global<00:00:48.719> 83<00:00:49.260> so<00:00:49.500> I<00:00:49.530> should<00:00:49.739> be<00:00:49.770> able<00:00:49.920> to<00:00:50.250> do<00:00:50.370> the

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
global 83 so I should be able to do the

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.819 
global 83 so I should be able to do the
other<00:00:50.670> planes<00:00:50.940> as<00:00:51.090> well<00:00:51.300> that's<00:00:51.600> awesome<00:00:51.829> all

and
I'm<00:01:45.930> really<00:01:46.590> gonna<00:01:46.710> like<00:01:46.920> this<00:01:47.070> plane<00:01:47.310> a

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
I'm really gonna like this plane a

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.280 
I'm really gonna like this plane a
realistic<00:01:47.880> simulator<00:01:48.420> battles<00:01:48.600> I<00:01:48.930> can<00:01:49.110> tell

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
realistic simulator battles I can tell

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:55.600 
realistic simulator battles I can tell
now

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:57.370 

looks<00:01:56.120> like<00:01:56.300> the<00:01:56.480> reverse<00:01:56.630> mayor<00:01:57.080> doesn't

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
looks like the reverse mayor doesn't

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.390 
looks like the reverse mayor doesn't
work<00:01:57.620> yet<00:01:57.860> it's<00:01:58.850> just<00:01:59.090> the<00:01:59.240> static<00:02:00.190> image<00:02:01.190> so

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:01.400 
work yet it's just the static image so

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.070 
work yet it's just the static image so
to<00:02:01.460> speak<00:02:01.730> of<00:02:02.150> what's<00:02:02.450> behind<00:02:02.600> you<00:02:02.930> but

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:03.080 
to speak of what's behind you but

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.390 
to speak of what's behind you but
doesn't<00:02:03.320> actually<00:02:03.380> show<00:02:03.590> you<00:02:03.740> what's<00:02:04.190> behind

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:04.400 
doesn't actually show you what's behind

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:05.710 
doesn't actually show you what's behind
you<00:02:04.640> if<00:02:04.700> there's<00:02:04.910> a<00:02:04.970> plane<00:02:05.240> behind<00:02:05.390> you<00:02:05.600> you

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 
you if there's a plane behind you you

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:06.820 
you if there's a plane behind you you
wouldn't<00:02:05.930> be<00:02:06.020> able<00:02:06.110> to<00:02:06.230> see<00:02:06.410> it<00:02:06.470> in<00:02:06.560> the<00:02:06.650> mirror

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:06.830 
wouldn't be able to see it in the mirror

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:09.460 
wouldn't be able to see it in the mirror
but<00:02:07.160> maybe<00:02:07.760> we'll<00:02:07.910> change<00:02:08.149> that<00:02:08.240> one<00:02:08.479> day<00:02:08.660> so

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
but maybe we'll change that one day so

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.200 
but maybe we'll change that one day so
