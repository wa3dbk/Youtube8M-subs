00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.490
 they are known as fruits 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:49.680
 red because it has a very

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:20.110
 alcohol cigarette pollution prevents 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:22.510
 aging can be the cell 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:24.190

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:26.460

 these tapping are not caloric she has 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:21.660
 around 35 to 49 calories out there 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.620
 per 100 grams representing a cup 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:27.000
 of tea 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:30.150
 not crowded and there's a hint of a 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.140
 light dessert an ice cream of fruit 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:35.540
 reds 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.540
 It's like an ice cream only that does not carry milk. 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:41.040
 the master of it is made on the basis of 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:44.640
 water it is a concentrated fruit juice 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:46.920
 made water-based and not what 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:50.600
 frozen right then i play i play 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.600
 which in my time was the scratch card 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:57.660
 ice creams cakes juices 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:03.530
 they give flavor and color the delights of the 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:03.530
 day after day i like red led 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:09.720
 blackberry as a raspberry cure sometimes 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:13.040
 I make a preparation with ice cream of 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:15.510
 yogurt but a cranberry sauce 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:18.950
 My Photo 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.950
 put on top of the video 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:27.620
 is very consumed is also the caipirinha 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:30.650
 of red fruits at party time 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:32.660
 without a balanced amount it is not even 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:36.010
 it is bad but it is an excess of alcohol and 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:36.010
 can adversely affect health 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:43.390
 and you know the blueberry another fruit 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:45.860
 red that does very well for health 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:49.280
 wearing never with me I've heard 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:51.530
 but I do not know my style is a fruit 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:55.550
 of north america in the united states 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:59.120
 they call for blueberry has there 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:03.800
 We do not even like how a friend 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:08.260
 here looks very good tasty ask in here 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:08.260
 seems one or italy jabuticaba 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:13.930
 of the red fruits the blueberry is the fruit 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.970
 more exotic and harder to 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:17.500
 found is usually grown in 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:20.400
 cooler climates and so the 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:24.690
 difficulty in finding it 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:28.180
 I commit you a good friend of the heart. 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:30.820
 he is considered better than wine 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:35.890
 for the prevention of diseases of the 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:37.630
 mainly heart good cholesterol already 

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:41.640
 both because I like to come so much 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:41.640
 so I'll start by eating steak wash 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:50.680
 the berries are very sensitive and 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:52.750
 require special care to 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:55.780
 sanitizing these fruits is ideal that they 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:58.480
 be soaked in vinegar and 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:02.310
 then gently washed one is 

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:02.310
 that are consumed in a safe way 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:11.040
 blueberry raspberry cherry they are fruits 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:13.870
 Rare and expensive but worth it 

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:17.140
 I always a little more expensive, but more 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:20.380
 I think the benefit outweighs all 

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:22.680
 red berries I always put my 

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:22.680
 cart
