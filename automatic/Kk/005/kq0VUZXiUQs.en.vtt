00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:07.580
 Good Morning 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.940
 and some ideas 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:23.930
 so I do not have much time for food 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:32.489
 I could say that they kill me too 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.110
 markets because if I can not be 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.300
 protest because I expropriate a 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.120
 Crying does not kill everyone if 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.559
 talking about protest we do for the 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.180
 products we have many protests in the 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.729
 Street 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.940
 - kill them all but because 

00:00:44.729 --> 00:00:49.320
 he waited to kill them I need the 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.479
 problem with that 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.180
 is that people are going to think that you 

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:55.979
 I'm not a fag, I've said a thousand times in 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.559
 chains I said here I did it with 

00:00:55.979 --> 00:01:00.720
 all that I'm not fag because there 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.970
 You still doubt that I'm a fagot 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:04.530
 we know it is more I myself 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:07.820
 I mean you know how to throw 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:11.280
 the word because the word love of 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:13.350

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:23.670
 sword and ability, you are not well 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:27.890

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.890
 word this dictator 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:34.670
 that he designed on that damn word that 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:37.670
 I said that it is forbidden 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:40.580
 that word is forbidden I am not that 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:43.880

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:45.950
