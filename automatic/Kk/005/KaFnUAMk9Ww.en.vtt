with the wood enabled function of the

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.860 
with the wood enabled function of the
cabinet<00:02:32.250> really<00:02:32.730> gives<00:02:33.180> a<00:02:33.300> great<00:02:33.540> resonance

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870

to<00:02:34.110> sound<00:02:34.410> and<00:02:34.770> it<00:02:34.950> sounds<00:02:35.220> really<00:02:35.250> good<00:02:35.900> with

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
to sound and it sounds really good with

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.620 
to sound and it sounds really good with
member<00:02:37.290> H<00:02:37.410> low<00:02:37.740> range<00:02:38.010> and<00:02:38.250> high<00:02:38.790> ranges<00:02:39.240> it

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
member H low range and high ranges it

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.270 
member H low range and high ranges it
tends<00:02:39.930> to<00:02:39.990> do<00:02:40.110> the<00:02:40.230> high<00:02:40.380> range<00:02:40.680> fairly<00:02:41.160> well

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
tends to do the high range fairly well

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.100 
tends to do the high range fairly well
but<00:02:41.460> not<00:02:41.610> too<00:02:41.880> high<00:02:42.150> so<00:02:42.210> you<00:02:42.570> don't<00:02:42.810> get<00:02:42.900> that

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
but not too high so you don't get that

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.570 
but not too high so you don't get that
teeny<00:02:43.440> cheap<00:02:44.250> sound<00:02:44.600> mid<00:02:45.600> range<00:02:45.900> it's<00:02:46.230> pretty

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
teeny cheap sound mid range it's pretty

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:49.370 
teeny cheap sound mid range it's pretty
right<00:02:47.580> in<00:02:47.760> the<00:02:47.850> middle<00:02:48.060> there<00:02:48.240> with<00:02:49.020> the<00:02:49.200> bass

right in the middle there with the bass
it's<00:02:49.920> okay<00:02:50.250> it's<00:02:50.550> got<00:02:50.700> a<00:02:50.730> little<00:02:51.120> bit<00:02:51.240> of<00:02:51.330> bass

just kind of blend together the I just

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.360 
just kind of blend together the I just
really<00:03:36.720> wasn't<00:03:36.900> that<00:03:37.470> impressed<00:03:37.950> with<00:03:38.160> the

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
really wasn't that impressed with the

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.430 
really wasn't that impressed with the
overall<00:03:38.850> quality<00:03:39.120> of<00:03:39.360> the<00:03:39.450> sound<00:03:39.720> it<00:03:40.200> does

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
overall quality of the sound it does

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.140 
overall quality of the sound it does
sound<00:03:40.650> better<00:03:40.860> than<00:03:41.130> many<00:03:41.310> cheap<00:03:41.640> speakers<00:03:41.850> in

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
sound better than many cheap speakers in

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.120 
sound better than many cheap speakers in
the<00:03:42.240> market<00:03:42.570> and<00:03:42.720> average<00:03:43.020> speakers<00:03:43.470> I<00:03:43.680> would

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
the market and average speakers I would

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:46.340 
the market and average speakers I would
say<00:03:44.340> it's<00:03:44.640> definitely<00:03:45.210> on<00:03:45.600> the<00:03:45.720> higher<00:03:45.930> end<00:03:46.200> of

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
say it's definitely on the higher end of

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:48.890 
say it's definitely on the higher end of
quality<00:03:46.860> when<00:03:47.040> it<00:03:47.130> comes<00:03:47.280> to<00:03:47.430> sound<00:03:47.640> but<00:03:48.330> one

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
quality when it comes to sound but one

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.200 
quality when it comes to sound but one
thing<00:03:49.080> that<00:03:49.260> I<00:03:49.560> kind<00:03:50.100> of<00:03:50.160> noticed<00:03:50.520> was<00:03:50.700> it<00:03:51.060> was

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:51.210 
thing that I kind of noticed was it was

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:53.330 
thing that I kind of noticed was it was
just<00:03:51.360> very<00:03:51.510> one-dimensional<00:03:51.930> I<00:03:52.740> couldn't

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
just very one-dimensional I couldn't

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.040 
just very one-dimensional I couldn't
really<00:03:53.490> pick<00:03:53.790> out<00:03:53.970> different<00:03:54.390> aspects<00:03:54.810> of<00:03:54.960> the

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:55.050 
really pick out different aspects of the

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:57.110 
really pick out different aspects of the
highest<00:03:55.500> lows<00:03:55.770> in<00:03:55.980> the<00:03:56.070> mid<00:03:56.100> everything<00:03:56.940> just

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
highest lows in the mid everything just

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.950 
highest lows in the mid everything just
kind<00:03:57.360> of<00:03:57.420> blended<00:03:57.900> together<00:03:58.340> and<00:03:59.390> given<00:04:00.390> keep

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:00.960 
kind of blended together and given keep

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:02.870 
kind of blended together and given keep
in<00:04:01.110> mind<00:04:01.320> that<00:04:01.860> comes<00:04:02.100> from<00:04:02.190> a<00:04:02.310> reviewer<00:04:02.670> who

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:02.880 
in mind that comes from a reviewer who

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
systems now this is at a high-end price

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:08.570 
systems now this is at a high-end price
I<00:04:07.470> think<00:04:07.500> it's<00:04:07.770> about<00:04:07.890> three<00:04:08.100> to<00:04:08.280> four<00:04:08.460> hundred

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:08.580 
I think it's about three to four hundred

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:10.540 
I think it's about three to four hundred
dollars<00:04:08.970> right<00:04:09.120> now<00:04:09.300> as<00:04:09.540> of<00:04:10.080> this<00:04:10.140> recording

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:10.550 
dollars right now as of this recording

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:13.550 
dollars right now as of this recording
so<00:04:11.550> give<00:04:12.510> it<00:04:12.630> from<00:04:12.780> the<00:04:12.870> price<00:04:13.110> of<00:04:13.320> where<00:04:13.440> it's

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
so give it from the price of where it's

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.530 
so give it from the price of where it's
at<00:04:13.770> I<00:04:14.040> think<00:04:14.340> that's<00:04:14.550> where<00:04:14.820> I<00:04:15.090> make<00:04:15.510> my

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
at I think that's where I make my

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.050 
at I think that's where I make my
comments<00:04:16.170> and<00:04:16.320> reference<00:04:16.710> to<00:04:16.920> so<00:04:17.520> it's<00:04:17.940> a

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
comments and reference to so it's a
