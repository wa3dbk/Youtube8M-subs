00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:22.050 
by doing a macro or probably just

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:26.240 
by doing a macro or probably just
writing<00:03:22.650> this<00:03:23.870> target<00:03:24.870> socks<00:03:25.260> in<00:03:25.500> this<00:03:25.680> case<00:03:25.950> I

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
writing this target socks in this case I

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.420 
writing this target socks in this case I
don't<00:03:26.459> have<00:03:27.140> this<00:03:28.140> so<00:03:28.440> sollux<00:03:28.950> has<00:03:29.160> been

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
don't have this so sollux has been

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.000 
don't have this so sollux has been
killed<00:03:29.760> a<00:03:29.940> few<00:03:30.269> minutes<00:03:30.810> ago<00:03:30.959> so<00:03:31.410> I<00:03:31.440> cannot

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
killed a few minutes ago so I cannot

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:37.100 
killed a few minutes ago so I cannot
