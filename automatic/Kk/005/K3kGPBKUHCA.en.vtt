00:00:02.179 --> 00:00:05.160
 hello guys my name is trash 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.350
 Boris Viktorovich 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.330
 I am a teacher online learning center 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.690
 resistant point poo I will help you 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.910
 prepare for the math ege 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:17.369
 let's solve the following drawing problem 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:21.000
 depicts a graph of some functions 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:24.590
 the function y is equal to f from x more precisely the part 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.109
 this graph from -10 to -8 know that 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:31.759
 here 's a big one from x is some 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:36.270
 the primitive function f is required to find 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:39.500
 the area under the schedule is the sinful part for 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:44.520
 In order to solve this problem you need to know 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:47.579
 Newton's formula-leybnitsa formula such 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:50.010
 First you need to know that the area under 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:55.860
 the graph is a definite integral of 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:01:00.780
 minus 10 to minus 8 in this case to f 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:03.329
 from x dx and then know what if y 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.210
 f functions of continuous functions of but 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:09.979
 present to continuous about continuous 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.780
 functions f if we know the primitive then 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:13.860
 value of a definite integral 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.920
 equals the difference of values 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.400
 primitive on the ends must be found 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.259
 the value of antiderivative at the upper end 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.610
 minus 8 and subtract the value of the antiderivative 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:29.549
 at the bottom end 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:30.180
 minus f from -10 we are all essentially a task 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.579
 decided 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:38.189
 and then you just need to substitute minus 8 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:40.619
 and minus 10 per function to a large of x and 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:49.560
 find these values ​​let's do 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:02:00.560
 apart from minus 8 this is minus -8 cubed 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:02:07.670
 minus 27 to minus 8 squared minus 240 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:07.670
 by minus 8 and minus 8 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:13.009
 now let's take it 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:23.640
 minus 8 in the cube this is what come on 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.560
 first get rid of these minuses to 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:29.340
 it was easier 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:31.349
 reason to minus to minus in a cube yes 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.940
 this is a minus will remain if we are three times 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:35.370
 we multiply negative numbers 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:39.269
 negative number yes minus minus 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:41.489
 another one turns 8 cubed further 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:47.489
 minus 8 squared that's just 8 in 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:51.330
 squared means -27 by 8 squared so 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:03:00.510
 further minus minus to minus gives plus 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:03:04.250
 plus 240 8 and minus 8 look easy 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:07.980
 notice that it will be easier to count if we 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:13.079
 8 we will make a bracket and let's even 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:17.549
 from the first two terms we put 8 into 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:21.650
 square just 8 cube do not want 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:29.750
 to build yes that's about 8 squared 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:34.440
 will remain 8 minus 27 to further what is 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:37.459
 240 24 divided by 8 24 years into eight 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:42.329
 3 means lead 40 divided by 8 this 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:47.000
 30, you can write that it is plus 30 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:50.250
 multiply by 8 multiply by 8 and minus here 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.950
 so see what we get 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:56.060
 somewhere here I move on 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:59.100
 do not erase anything yet f from minus 8 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:07.910
 what we finally got 8 in 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:07.910
 multiply square by minus 19 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:18.160
 plus 30 times 8 squared minus 8 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:25.550
 58 square let's take out again 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:33.740
 you get minus 19 30 and minus 8 and equals 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:36.979
 8 will spend 64 minus 1930 is 11 minus 8 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:39.740
 Well , now everything has to be considered 64 

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:45.740
 multiply by 11 what is 64 multiply by 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:58.250
 10 640 64 multiply by 164 640 to 64 to 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:05:01.419
 700 4 minus 8 it turns out 696 here found f 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:01.419
 from minus 8 

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:15.669
 so everything means necessary 

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:24.860
 can erase these calculations we found 

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:28.340
 what is the value of the primitive 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:31.780
 at x equal to minus 8 now substitute 

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:35.150
 minus 10 minus 10 off substitute yes 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:41.180
 because 10 is simple and squared and cube 

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:47.389
 to build anywhere is equal to minus minus 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:51.520
 10 cubed minus 27 to minus 10 

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:59.350
 squared minus 240 

00:05:51.520 --> 00:06:06.010
 multiply by minus 10 and minus 8 so 

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:08.920
 what do we get minus 10 cubed 

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:09.880
 minus 10 minus 10 minus 10 that is minus 

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:16.860
 1000 

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:19.440
 yes even minus it turns out plus 1000 so 

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:22.540
 farther 

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:23.290
 minus 10 squared minus 10 minus 10 

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:29.010
 that's 100 

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:33.000
 it turns out minus 27 minutes to 102 700 

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:42.150
 minus to minus gives plus so plus 

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:46.240
 240 by 10 2 400 and -8 so let's count 

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:53.260
 but look away to here minus 2 700 

00:06:46.240 --> 00:07:07.110
 plus 2 400 is minus 300 thousand and minus 3 

00:06:53.260 --> 00:07:13.350
 st this 700 and 700 minus 8 it turns out 692 

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:19.540
 gets 696 minus 692 

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:19.930
