ingredients together the first thing

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.570 
ingredients together the first thing
that<00:01:15.689> I<00:01:15.840> have<00:01:16.020> right<00:01:16.229> here<00:01:16.439> is<00:01:16.650> 1<00:01:16.950> tablespoon

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
that I have right here is 1 tablespoon

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.640 
that I have right here is 1 tablespoon
of<00:01:17.820> grated<00:01:18.060> orange<00:01:18.509> zest<00:01:18.840> and<00:01:19.020> this<00:01:19.470> is

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
of grated orange zest and this is

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.620 
of grated orange zest and this is
something<00:01:20.009> that<00:01:20.040> really<00:01:20.340> will<00:01:20.640> add<00:01:20.820> in<00:01:21.180> a<00:01:21.390> lot

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
something that really will add in a lot

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.749

batter<00:01:44.610> is<00:01:44.880> mixed<00:01:45.210> up<00:01:45.420> what<00:01:45.930> I<00:01:45.960> have<00:01:46.140> right

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
batter is mixed up what I have right

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.410 
batter is mixed up what I have right
here<00:01:46.380> is<00:01:46.590> a<00:01:46.829> 9<00:01:47.040> inch<00:01:47.280> pie<00:01:47.520> container<00:01:47.909> and<00:01:48.329> I

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
here is a 9 inch pie container and I

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.090 
here is a 9 inch pie container and I
already<00:01:48.780> sprayed<00:01:49.110> it<00:01:49.259> with<00:01:49.290> some<00:01:49.770> nonstick

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
already sprayed it with some nonstick

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.190 
already sprayed it with some nonstick
cooking<00:01:50.490> spray<00:01:50.579> and<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.420> next<00:01:51.689> step<00:01:51.899> is<00:01:52.170> just

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
cooking spray and the next step is just

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.410 
cooking spray and the next step is just
to<00:01:52.530> pour<00:01:52.829> out<00:01:53.040> our<00:01:53.250> batter<00:01:53.520> into<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:54.270> pie

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
to pour out our batter into the pie

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.620

container

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.569 

and<00:02:00.630> now<00:02:00.990> this<00:02:01.409> is<00:02:01.590> ready<00:02:01.799> to<00:02:01.860> go<00:02:02.070> into<00:02:02.399> the

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
oven and what we're going to do is

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.679 
oven and what we're going to do is

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
really just leave it on the counter or

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.600 
really just leave it on the counter or
you<00:02:24.810> could<00:02:24.959> just<00:02:24.989> leave<00:02:25.319> it<00:02:25.500> in<00:02:25.709> the<00:02:25.950> oven<00:02:26.310> for

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
you could just leave it in the oven for

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.940 
you could just leave it in the oven for
a<00:02:26.640> couple<00:02:26.940> hours<00:02:27.030> so<00:02:27.810> it<00:02:27.959> cools<00:02:28.170> off<00:02:28.440> a<00:02:28.470> bit<00:02:28.739> and

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
a couple hours so it cools off a bit and

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.890 
a couple hours so it cools off a bit and
then<00:02:29.040> you<00:02:29.129> can<00:02:29.250> actually<00:02:29.400> cut<00:02:29.790> it<00:02:29.910> into<00:02:30.209> slices

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
then you can actually cut it into slices

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.350 
then you can actually cut it into slices
and<00:02:31.319> then<00:02:31.410> serve<00:02:31.739> it<00:02:31.769> up<00:02:31.980> and<00:02:32.430> enjoy<00:02:32.790> it<00:02:32.970> but
