you<00:01:13.350> exit<00:01:13.560> a<00:01:13.619> program<00:01:13.920> will<00:01:14.010> go<00:01:14.100> straight<00:01:14.250> to

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
you exit a program will go straight to

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:15.649 
you exit a program will go straight to
the<00:01:14.460> home<00:01:14.640> screen<00:01:14.670> as<00:01:15.090> you<00:01:15.390> can<00:01:15.450> see<00:01:15.630> right

the home screen as you can see right

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.570 
the home screen as you can see right
there<00:01:15.960> of<00:01:16.380> course<00:01:16.619> I<00:01:16.740> am<00:01:16.920> overclocked<00:01:17.549> to

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
there of course I am overclocked to

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.230 
there of course I am overclocked to
twelve<00:01:18.000> hundred<00:01:18.119> megahertz<00:01:19.580> I<00:01:20.580> was<00:01:21.119> in<00:01:21.210> the

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
twelve hundred megahertz I was in the

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.749 
twelve hundred megahertz I was in the
previous<00:01:21.600> one<00:01:21.840> though<00:01:21.990> and<00:01:22.170> it's<00:01:22.619> still<00:01:22.759> went

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
previous one though and it's still went

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.719 
previous one though and it's still went
pretty<00:01:23.850> slow<00:01:24.330> on<00:01:24.479> that<00:01:25.040> so<00:01:26.040> this<00:01:26.189> is<00:01:26.220> by<00:01:26.490> far

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
pretty slow on that so this is by far

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.679 
pretty slow on that so this is by far
the<00:01:26.790> fastest<00:01:27.360> one<00:01:27.540> out<00:01:28.189> and<00:01:29.189> this<00:01:30.000> kid<00:01:30.270> is<00:01:30.450> 17

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
the fastest one out and this kid is 17

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.490 
the fastest one out and this kid is 17
that's<00:01:31.229> making<00:01:31.619> this<00:01:32.180> so<00:01:33.200> even<00:01:34.200> if<00:01:34.290> it<00:01:34.380> was

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
that's making this so even if it was

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.719 
that's making this so even if it was
good<00:01:34.710> or<00:01:34.740> no<00:01:34.920> I<00:01:34.950> was<00:01:35.159> going<00:01:35.280> to<00:01:35.340> download<00:01:35.640> it

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
good or no I was going to download it

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.420 
good or no I was going to download it

want<00:04:12.870> to<00:04:12.930> consider<00:04:13.140> not<00:04:13.380> keeping<00:04:13.709> the<00:04:13.830> market

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:15.230 
want to consider not keeping the market

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:17.680 
want to consider not keeping the market
widget<00:04:16.230> on<00:04:16.380> your<00:04:16.410> screen

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.690 
widget on your screen

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:19.300 
widget on your screen
and<00:04:17.870> I'm<00:04:18.410> a<00:04:18.440> little<00:04:18.680> concerned<00:04:18.830> about<00:04:19.130> the

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:19.310 
and I'm a little concerned about the

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:22.060 
and I'm a little concerned about the
seven<00:04:19.730> screens<00:04:20.110> it's<00:04:21.110> not<00:04:21.290> that<00:04:21.350> I<00:04:21.560> don't<00:04:21.680> like

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.070 
seven screens it's not that I don't like

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:23.950 
seven screens it's not that I don't like
having<00:04:22.340> them<00:04:22.580> or<00:04:22.700> anything<00:04:22.910> like<00:04:22.940> that<00:04:23.060> it's

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:23.960 
having them or anything like that it's

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.350 
having them or anything like that it's
the<00:04:24.200> memory<00:04:24.620> takes<00:04:24.920> up<00:04:25.070> on<00:04:25.190> the<00:04:25.370> phone<00:04:25.550> if<00:04:26.210> you

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:26.360 
the memory takes up on the phone if you

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.450 
the memory takes up on the phone if you
loot<00:04:26.570> if<00:04:26.810> you've<00:04:27.080> used<00:04:27.320> launcher<00:04:28.070> pro<00:04:28.280> and

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:28.460 
loot if you've used launcher pro and

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:29.470 
loot if you've used launcher pro and
you've<00:04:28.550> seen<00:04:28.670> this<00:04:28.760> change<00:04:29.060> logs<00:04:29.300> and

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:29.480 
you've seen this change logs and

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:33.010 
you've seen this change logs and
everything<00:04:30.250> yeah<00:04:31.250> but<00:04:31.880> some<00:04:32.030> user<00:04:32.330> stuff<00:04:32.810> in

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:33.020 
everything yeah but some user stuff in

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:34.930 
everything yeah but some user stuff in
there<00:04:33.200> so<00:04:33.440> you<00:04:33.500> can<00:04:33.710> change<00:04:34.130> it<00:04:34.370> change<00:04:34.820> it

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:34.940 
there so you can change it change it

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:37.690 
there so you can change it change it
from<00:04:35.090> you<00:04:35.270> know<00:04:35.390> like<00:04:35.660> three<00:04:36.350> one<00:04:37.130> two<00:04:37.160> one

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:37.700 
from you know like three one two one

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:40.420 
from you know like three one two one
three<00:04:38.000> and<00:04:38.120> five<00:04:38.680> seven<00:04:39.680> screens<00:04:39.980> or<00:04:40.190> whatever

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:40.430 
three and five seven screens or whatever

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:42.190 
three and five seven screens or whatever
it<00:04:40.550> is<00:04:40.670> because<00:04:41.570> when<00:04:41.750> you<00:04:41.810> have<00:04:41.840> seven

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:42.200 
it is because when you have seven

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:43.600 
it is because when you have seven
screens<00:04:42.380> it<00:04:42.590> takes<00:04:42.800> up<00:04:42.920> a<00:04:43.010> lot<00:04:43.160> of<00:04:43.190> memory

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:43.610 
screens it takes up a lot of memory

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:45.870 
screens it takes up a lot of memory
which<00:04:44.330> sometimes<00:04:44.570> causes<00:04:45.110> force<00:04:45.380> closes

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:45.880 
which sometimes causes force closes

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.340 
which sometimes causes force closes
which<00:04:46.880> I<00:04:47.030> haven't<00:04:47.360> had<00:04:47.480> any<00:04:47.660> force<00:04:47.900> closes<00:04:48.230> on

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:48.350 
which I haven't had any force closes on

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:50.500 
which I haven't had any force closes on
here<00:04:48.530> or<00:04:48.770> the<00:04:48.980> previous<00:04:49.490> ROM<00:04:50.060> that<00:04:50.240> I<00:04:50.300> had

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:50.510 
here or the previous ROM that I had

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:54.450 
here or the previous ROM that I had
furry<00:04:51.230> oak<00:04:51.410> and<00:04:51.680> rate<00:04:51.920> or<00:04:52.070> whatever<00:04:52.340> but<00:04:53.330> um

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:54.460 
furry oak and rate or whatever but um

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:58.870 
furry oak and rate or whatever but um
yeah<00:04:55.460> a<00:04:55.700> little<00:04:56.350> that<00:04:57.350> little<00:04:58.010> cautious<00:04:58.760> about

00:04:58.870 --> 00:04:58.880 
yeah a little that little cautious about

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:02.260 
yeah a little that little cautious about
that<00:04:59.950> depresses<00:05:00.950> me<00:05:00.980> that<00:05:01.370> it<00:05:01.760> actually<00:05:01.940> does

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:02.270 
that depresses me that it actually does

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:04.750 
that depresses me that it actually does
work<00:05:02.480> I<00:05:02.810> don't<00:05:03.590> know<00:05:03.680> why<00:05:03.830> what's<00:05:04.400> his<00:05:04.520> name<00:05:04.640> is

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:04.760 
work I don't know why what's his name is

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:08.800 
work I don't know why what's his name is
doing<00:05:05.000> that<00:05:05.120> creates<00:05:05.450> launcher<00:05:05.840> pro<00:05:06.730> but<00:05:07.810> he's

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:08.810 
doing that creates launcher pro but he's

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:10.420 
doing that creates launcher pro but he's
create<00:05:09.110> something<00:05:09.320> for<00:05:09.500> that<00:05:09.620> to<00:05:09.770> make<00:05:09.890> it<00:05:10.010> be

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:10.430 
create something for that to make it be

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:11.470 
create something for that to make it be
able<00:05:10.550> to<00:05:10.640> have<00:05:10.760> seven<00:05:11.090> screens<00:05:11.270> without

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:11.480 
able to have seven screens without

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:14.920 
able to have seven screens without
anything<00:05:11.900> closing<00:05:12.530> and<00:05:12.650> stuff<00:05:12.830> but<00:05:13.730> I<00:05:14.060> don't

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:14.930 
anything closing and stuff but I don't

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:18.160 
anything closing and stuff but I don't
have<00:05:15.080> on<00:05:16.270> basically<00:05:17.270> three<00:05:17.510> of<00:05:17.630> my<00:05:17.750> screens<00:05:18.050> I

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:18.170 
have on basically three of my screens I

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:20.770 
have on basically three of my screens I
don't<00:05:18.290> have<00:05:18.380> anything<00:05:18.620> I<00:05:18.980> mean<00:05:19.850> this<00:05:20.030> is<00:05:20.090> 12

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:20.780 
don't have anything I mean this is 12

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:23.320 
don't have anything I mean this is 12
and<00:05:21.260> then<00:05:22.100> this<00:05:22.280> third<00:05:22.610> one<00:05:22.850> just<00:05:22.880> has<00:05:23.120> three

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:23.330 
and then this third one just has three

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:26.380 
and then this third one just has three
different<00:05:23.450> things<00:05:23.750> on<00:05:23.930> it<00:05:24.400> so<00:05:25.400> if<00:05:25.790> I<00:05:25.970> step<00:05:26.210> with

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:26.390 
different things on it so if I step with

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:27.850 
different things on it so if I step with
more<00:05:26.600> stuff<00:05:26.810> on<00:05:26.990> it<00:05:27.050> you<00:05:27.290> know<00:05:27.320> putting<00:05:27.680> all

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:27.860 
more stuff on it you know putting all

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:32.490 
more stuff on it you know putting all
the<00:05:28.040> all<00:05:28.640> the<00:05:28.700> stuff<00:05:29.060> on<00:05:29.240> and<00:05:29.450> everything<00:05:30.550> then

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:32.500 
the all the stuff on and everything then

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:35.140 
the all the stuff on and everything then
it<00:05:33.500> might<00:05:33.680> start<00:05:33.950> force<00:05:34.490> closing<00:05:34.850> and<00:05:34.940> stuff

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:35.150 
it might start force closing and stuff

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:37.740 
it might start force closing and stuff
which<00:05:35.300> is<00:05:35.419> what<00:05:35.570> happened<00:05:35.870> to<00:05:35.930> launcher<00:05:36.230> pro

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:37.750 
which is what happened to launcher pro

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:39.970 
which is what happened to launcher pro
another<00:05:38.750> thing<00:05:38.960> I've<00:05:39.080> been<00:05:39.110> wanting<00:05:39.650> in<00:05:39.770> all

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:39.980 
another thing I've been wanting in all

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:44.070 
another thing I've been wanting in all
the<00:05:40.280> roms<00:05:40.490> is<00:05:41.000> the<00:05:41.360> ability<00:05:41.570> to<00:05:41.960> UM<00:05:42.760> move

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:44.080 
the roms is the ability to UM move

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:47.920 
the roms is the ability to UM move
applications<00:05:45.080> to<00:05:45.680> the<00:05:45.710> SD<00:05:46.070> card<00:05:46.340> in<00:05:46.700> this<00:05:47.690> it

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:47.930 
applications to the SD card in this it

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:49.450 
applications to the SD card in this it
doesn't<00:05:48.110> have<00:05:48.350> that<00:05:48.590> doesn't<00:05:48.980> have<00:05:49.070> scripts

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:49.460 
doesn't have that doesn't have scripts

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:52.360 
doesn't have that doesn't have scripts
which<00:05:50.300> kind<00:05:50.510> of<00:05:50.570> sucks<00:05:50.870> but<00:05:51.560> you<00:05:51.740> know<00:05:51.800> I<00:05:52.130> guess

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:52.370 
which kind of sucks but you know I guess

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:55.300 
which kind of sucks but you know I guess
you<00:05:52.490> could<00:05:52.550> deal<00:05:52.790> with<00:05:52.970> it<00:05:53.150> as<00:05:53.890> you<00:05:54.890> can<00:05:55.160> see<00:05:55.280> I

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:55.310 
you could deal with it as you can see I

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:56.530 
you could deal with it as you can see I
already<00:05:55.430> have<00:05:55.700> the<00:05:55.850> thing<00:05:56.000> in<00:05:56.120> their<00:05:56.240> loose

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:56.540
