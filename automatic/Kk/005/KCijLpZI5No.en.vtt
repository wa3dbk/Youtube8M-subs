so<00:00:00.299> you<00:00:00.359> tube<00:00:00.719> with<00:00:00.870> a<00:00:00.900> bunch<00:00:01.380> of

00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:01.530 
so you tube with a bunch of

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:03.679 
so you tube with a bunch of
collaborators<00:00:02.070> once<00:00:02.730> in<00:00:02.909> good<00:00:03.179> idea<00:00:03.480> is<00:00:03.570> to

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:03.689 
collaborators once in good idea is to

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:05.390 
collaborators once in good idea is to
put<00:00:03.840> on<00:00:03.959> the<00:00:04.049> International<00:00:04.680> Space<00:00:04.710> Station

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.400 
put on the International Space Station

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.190 
put on the International Space Station
well<00:00:05.670> I've<00:00:05.850> got<00:00:05.879> a<00:00:06.029> good<00:00:06.150> idea<00:00:06.299> and<00:00:06.660> it<00:00:06.990> goes

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
well I've got a good idea and it goes

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.589 
well I've got a good idea and it goes
way<00:00:07.500> back<00:00:07.740> to<00:00:08.010> this<00:00:08.130> original<00:00:08.700> footage<00:00:09.360> of

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
way back to this original footage of

way back to this original footage of
Voyager<00:00:09.990> one's<00:00:10.200> approached<00:00:10.769> Jupiter<00:00:11.429> Iver

Voyager one's approached Jupiter Iver
merely<00:00:12.480> a<00:00:12.509> couple<00:00:13.139> of<00:00:13.200> weeks<00:00:13.410> I<00:00:13.740> found<00:00:14.099> this

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
merely a couple of weeks I found this

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:15.460 
merely a couple of weeks I found this
perspective<00:00:14.580> of<00:00:14.969> the<00:00:15.000> solar<00:00:15.269> system

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:15.470 
perspective of the solar system

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:18.349 
perspective of the solar system
fascinating<00:00:16.470> indeed<00:00:16.920> I<00:00:17.070> would<00:00:17.340> love<00:00:17.970> to<00:00:18.029> see<00:00:18.330> a

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
fascinating indeed I would love to see a

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.480 
fascinating indeed I would love to see a
time-lapse<00:00:18.869> of<00:00:19.050> the<00:00:19.289> obscurity<00:00:20.279> of<00:00:20.310> our

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
time-lapse of the obscurity of our

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.759 
time-lapse of the obscurity of our
earthly<00:00:20.880> shenanigans<00:00:21.720> as<00:00:22.109> seen<00:00:22.470> from<00:00:22.619> the

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
earthly shenanigans as seen from the

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.700 
earthly shenanigans as seen from the
quiet<00:00:23.160> serene<00:00:23.640> of<00:00:23.939> the<00:00:24.480> lunar<00:00:24.810> surface<00:00:25.019> and<00:00:25.500> so

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
quiet serene of the lunar surface and so

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.200 
quiet serene of the lunar surface and so
it<00:00:25.769> was<00:00:25.890> that<00:00:25.949> I<00:00:26.130> started<00:00:26.550> this<00:00:26.670> project<00:00:26.910> to

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
it was that I started this project to

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.509 
it was that I started this project to
observe<00:00:27.539> the<00:00:27.720> movement<00:00:28.500> of<00:00:28.800> Jupiter<00:00:29.220> from<00:00:29.400> the

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
observe the movement of Jupiter from the

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.030 
observe the movement of Jupiter from the
surface<00:00:29.789> of<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.210> earth<00:00:30.300> however<00:00:31.199> the<00:00:31.710> problem

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
surface of the earth however the problem

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.590 
surface of the earth however the problem
that<00:00:32.160> you<00:00:32.250> run<00:00:32.279> into<00:00:32.579> is<00:00:32.820> that<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.180> Earth

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
that you run into is that the Earth

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.990 
that you run into is that the Earth
spins<00:00:34.110> quite<00:00:34.770> annoyingly<00:00:35.280> quickly<00:00:35.760> since

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
spins quite annoyingly quickly since

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.490 
spins quite annoyingly quickly since
they<00:00:36.120> only<00:00:36.239> get<00:00:36.420> 12<00:00:36.750> or<00:00:36.899> so<00:00:37.050> hours<00:00:37.079> but

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
they only get 12 or so hours but

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.549 
they only get 12 or so hours but
continuous<00:00:38.129> night<00:00:38.340> well<00:00:38.879> on<00:00:39.090> average<00:00:39.420> I'll<00:00:40.020> no

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
continuous night well on average I'll no

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.350 
continuous night well on average I'll no

problem join up with half a dozen other
astronomers<00:00:42.750> and<00:00:43.350> you<00:00:43.469> get<00:00:43.620> 24<00:00:44.160> 7<00:00:44.579> footage

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940

astronomers and you get 24 7 footage
indeed<00:00:45.510> I<00:00:45.539> actually<00:00:45.750> submitted<00:00:46.469> that<00:00:46.620> idea

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
indeed I actually submitted that idea

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.729 
indeed I actually submitted that idea
for<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.250> YouTube<00:00:47.910> Nextup<00:00:48.180> project<00:00:48.870> but

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
for the YouTube Nextup project but

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.520 
for the YouTube Nextup project but
regrettably<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.670> idea<00:00:50.910> was<00:00:51.030> rejected

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:51.530 
regrettably the idea was rejected

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:53.630 
regrettably the idea was rejected
unperturbed<00:00:52.530> I<00:00:52.890> was<00:00:53.039> going<00:00:53.160> to<00:00:53.219> be<00:00:53.309> fooled

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
unperturbed I was going to be fooled

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.819 
unperturbed I was going to be fooled
with<00:00:53.820> this<00:00:53.969> project<00:00:54.180> this<00:00:54.480> summer<00:00:54.989> but<00:00:55.620> then

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
with this project this summer but then

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.709 
with this project this summer but then
the<00:00:55.949> brightest<00:00:56.430> supernova<00:00:56.699> lead<00:00:57.270> generation

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
the brightest supernova lead generation

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.150 
the brightest supernova lead generation
capped<00:00:58.199> off<00:00:58.410> and<00:00:58.739> that<00:00:59.010> was<00:00:59.100> a

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
capped off and that was a

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.099 
capped off and that was a
once-in-a-lifetime<00:00:59.850> opportunity<00:01:00.840> to<00:01:00.930> do<00:01:01.079> a

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to do a

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.529 
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to do a
timelapse<00:01:01.530> of<00:01:01.859> it<00:01:02.039> so<00:01:02.309> that<00:01:02.550> simply<00:01:03.390> took

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
timelapse of it so that simply took

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.740 
timelapse of it so that simply took
priority<00:01:04.070> now<00:01:05.070> it<00:01:05.129> turns<00:01:05.189> out<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.670> ISS<00:01:06.420> is<00:01:06.600> in

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
priority now it turns out the ISS is in

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.380 
priority now it turns out the ISS is in
a<00:01:06.869> polar<00:01:07.350> orbit<00:01:07.549> this<00:01:08.549> basically<00:01:08.850> means<00:01:09.090> it's

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
a polar orbit this basically means it's

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.140 
a polar orbit this basically means it's
have<00:01:09.600> up<00:01:09.900> and<00:01:10.200> down<00:01:10.350> type<00:01:10.650> orbit<00:01:11.040> as<00:01:11.760> a<00:01:11.790> result

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
have up and down type orbit as a result

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.210 
have up and down type orbit as a result
of<00:01:12.270> that<00:01:12.330> a<00:01:12.659> certain<00:01:13.229> times<00:01:13.650> of<00:01:13.770> year<00:01:13.830> you<00:01:14.130> can

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
of that a certain times of year you can

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.030 
of that a certain times of year you can
get<00:01:14.340> 20<00:01:14.729> 47<00:01:14.939> views<00:01:15.509> of<00:01:16.020> certain<00:01:16.560> portions<00:01:17.040> of

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
get 20 47 views of certain portions of

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.950 
get 20 47 views of certain portions of
the<00:01:17.189> sky<00:01:17.520> and<00:01:17.759> that<00:01:17.820> presents<00:01:18.060> a<00:01:18.360> golden

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
the sky and that presents a golden

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.140 
the sky and that presents a golden
opportunity<00:01:19.369> after<00:01:20.369> that<00:01:20.490> all<00:01:20.729> you<00:01:20.880> need<00:01:21.030> to

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
opportunity after that all you need to

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.060 
opportunity after that all you need to
do<00:01:21.270> is<00:01:21.390> point<00:01:21.600> a<00:01:21.720> telescope<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.409> planet<00:01:22.920> in

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
do is point a telescope the planet in

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.740 
do is point a telescope the planet in
that<00:01:23.189> portion<00:01:23.460> of<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.670> sky<00:01:23.909> and<00:01:24.180> you<00:01:24.540> get

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
that portion of the sky and you get

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.990 
that portion of the sky and you get
continuous<00:01:25.500> footage<00:01:25.950> of<00:01:26.070> it<00:01:26.189> now<00:01:26.850> this

advantages over the terrestrial version
on<00:01:30.659> the<00:01:30.750> project<00:01:31.140> firstly<00:01:32.100> you<00:01:32.549> are<00:01:32.700> not

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
on the project firstly you are not

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.179 
on the project firstly you are not
dependent<00:01:33.360> on<00:01:33.689> clear<00:01:34.020> skies<00:01:34.320> and<00:01:34.740> further

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
dependent on clear skies and further

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.560 
dependent on clear skies and further
when<00:01:35.400> you're<00:01:35.549> looking<00:01:35.790> at<00:01:35.909> things<00:01:36.060> as<00:01:36.270> small

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
when you're looking at things as small

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.899 
when you're looking at things as small
planets<00:01:37.110> it's<00:01:37.650> not<00:01:38.100> just<00:01:38.159> good<00:01:38.610> enough<00:01:38.729> to

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
planets it's not just good enough to

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.880 
planets it's not just good enough to
have<00:01:39.030> clear<00:01:39.329> skies<00:01:39.659> they<00:01:40.079> need<00:01:40.259> to<00:01:40.350> be<00:01:40.409> still

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
have clear skies they need to be still
