00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 hello to all in this video I will talk to you 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:08.910
 as you will have understood the title of the new ones 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:11.429
 The gel color lasting pupa enamels are 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.490
 of the enamels they should have a 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:18.359
 effect is the glass effect though they are 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:20.550
 real enamels not just gene 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.769
 I'm nothing else 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.869
 I read some confusing comments 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.060
 from the girls who serve the page of 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.429
 pupa on facebook and therefore decided to 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.830
 make this video the enamels I consider 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:35.610
 that the pupa enamels in the classic line 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:37.079
 and lasting normal colors are one of the 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.160
 best smart on the market in this 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.079
 moment 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.690
 there are also many more expensive brands 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.820
 of god for example chanel is pulled out 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.530
 the trend of the season as coloring 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.680
 etc pro as quality I find them 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:53.370
 really bad or for example but it goes there 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:55.170
 which has nice colors but there too 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.570
 much difference between some other colors 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.300
 even of different brands because 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.039
 some are gorgeous blankets dry 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.700
 quickly others are truly a 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:07.380
 disaster so I am very fond of 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.810
 Cuba when it goes to choose a nail polish 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.840
 whoever follows me knows that I work with 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.719
 babe in the sense that 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:20.780
 I receive products from them and I review them 

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:22.880
 if it suits me I will and I say this 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.009
 which I mean I don't have any kind of 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:28.189
 brake I don't have to force things 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:30.340
 good and I must not hold things back 

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:30.340
 bad 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:36.650
 you must know that many of the enamels 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:39.130
 babe that I bought them myself 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:41.840
 even after the start of the collaboration 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:45.290
 because they have a lot of variety of colors and 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:48.500
 I told you the truth as a quality because 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:51.860
 I find that the enamel pupa lasting color 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:53.810
 have such a high quality because one 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.150
 once applied, practically one is enough 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.550
 single passed to get a color 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:02:01.070
 satisfactory pine practically all 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:04.280
 colors because it dries enough 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:07.370
 hurry because it lasts so long, it's mine 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:10.100
 even without a top coat I myself have 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:14.720
 little time so sometimes I omit the 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:17.110
 passing of the touch and also not yes 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:20.570
 they dry when they are in the package 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:22.220
 duration last a long time if closed well 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:25.280
 Closed parentheses start talking about 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:28.640
 those with them the new ones that will come out from 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:31.250
 market within a few days of 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:35.660
 enamels that as I told you they should 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:40.100
 have a glossy finish as if it were of the 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:44.590
 genus or glass and this is what I wear 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:48.410
 from practically yesterday and 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:51.620
 with its top coat because lasting color 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:55.790
 of the year this touch that makes the 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:58.970
 still ends even closer to 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:00.800
 this has a wording 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:03.980
 hair details are possible 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:08.030
 this affection glass very glossy effect 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:12.040
 and they also have another difference than the 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:18.830
 brush that is much wider than that 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:21.560
 usually brushes for pump enamels 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:24.130
 they look a lot like the brushes look like 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:28.890
 much to the brush that a 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:30.730
 the enamel of the re of the movement 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:32.980
 the prof 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:34.570
 it may be that I like it at the moment it is me 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:39.070
 always liked that brush too i 

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:41.920
 their faces are good and I like them 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:45.780
 very much their brush but I will tell you 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:48.780
 because I prefer the lasting color more 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:53.520
 normal classics these is true not a 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:57.190
 fine ends but in my opinion for 

00:03:53.520 --> 00:04:00.370
 have this ends have had 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:02.380
 obviously have a different formula than 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:07.030
 penalized are other things like ad 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:09.490
 example the duration and the opacity you see 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:13.260
 I have applied two rooms here 

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:18.459
 you see that I don't have perfect coverage 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:21.970
 and two abundant hands ruin a little 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:23.920
 more easily than the normal-lasting lasting color 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:26.830
 right in my opinion for this 

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:28.960
 particular wording he has and to me is 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:31.300
 lasts less you see that you apply it 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:34.770
 avoid a little ruined keep in mind that 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:38.610
 anyway i am a mom 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:40.379
 staying at home I seem to be doing things with 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:44.400
 little vanina children changed i 

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:47.220
 Children then put a strain on the 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:49.470
 enamels for this video I find i 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:51.629
 lasting classic high quality color 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:53.490
 because for me they last so long until 

00:04:51.629 --> 00:04:56.569
 don't take them out these months 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:56.569
 they last a little less 

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:01.210
 for those who may like those who do not have this 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:03.700
 long-term employee who 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:06.340
 like to change a coat very often 

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:09.940
 they are all right because they are glazes anyway 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:12.750
 much better quality than others 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:15.580
 enamels and before they are on the market 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:25.200
 there are so many colors 49 i 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:25.200
 colors I have these here these these 

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:31.420
 the elimation of the so-called maybe then 

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:36.300
 I don't see then strongly on instagram is the 

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:40.090
 top coat I'm wearing this now 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:44.500
 which is 44 which is almost an orange 

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:48.310
 very hot very thick fleece almost much more 

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:51.070
 load here then I wanted to do these to you 

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:52.890
 considerations view of the exit of the 

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:56.900
 produced in a few days 

00:05:52.890 --> 00:06:01.729
 the effect I tell you is very beautiful 

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:03.620
 indeed it is already a lot with the touch itself 

00:06:01.729 --> 00:06:06.320
 apply this top with another one 

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:09.500
 nail polish that may not even be 

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:13.160
 worried about a more polished effect in 

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:17.960
 normal however you will not have clearly 

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:20.720
 the so shine enamel but a 

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:22.430
 little to taste, you will like this one more 

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:24.560
 wording among the forbidden of that 

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:26.960
 formulation of the classics I continue to 

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:31.610
 prefer the classics while ray this 

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:35.690
 brush to the classic formulation o 

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:37.340
 Alter is not possible therefore nothing 

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:39.560
 but I like these here for me 

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:43.520
 the range lasts too little 

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:46.040
 of colors however serious square in 

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:50.140
 effect this here in glossy and more 

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:56.320
 we say that the question seems a little more 

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:56.320
 the defendant swollen a little fuller 

00:06:57.230 --> 00:07:00.860
 nothing these are the characteristics i 

00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:03.170
 pros and cons that I found this 

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:05.150
 this and polish I hope this video 

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:08.200
 it is useful to you by mimicking a medium in the 

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:08.200
 next hello
