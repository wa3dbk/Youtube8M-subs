slightly more in the shadows yeah and

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.820 
slightly more in the shadows yeah and

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
pretty much after we came back I'd heard

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.130 
pretty much after we came back I'd heard
that<00:02:46.910> some<00:02:47.180> of<00:02:47.240> you<00:02:47.330> also<00:02:47.540> had<00:02:47.660> already<00:02:47.810> signed

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
that some of you also had already signed

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:49.690 
that some of you also had already signed
up<00:02:48.410> on<00:02:48.620> the<00:02:48.770> strength<00:02:49.010> of<00:02:49.100> that<00:02:49.160> immediately

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
up on the strength of that immediately

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.970 
up on the strength of that immediately
and<00:02:50.030> thought<00:02:50.960> what<00:02:51.080> let's<00:02:51.230> get<00:02:51.380> into<00:02:51.500> this<00:02:51.710> and

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
and thought what let's get into this and

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:53.830 
and thought what let's get into this and
the<00:02:52.670> classes<00:02:53.030> were<00:02:53.120> actually<00:02:53.420> minute<00:02:53.660> walk

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
the classes were actually minute walk

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.170 
the classes were actually minute walk
from<00:02:53.870> where<00:02:54.230> I<00:02:54.290> live<00:02:54.530> so<00:02:55.190> it<00:02:55.730> was<00:02:55.910> an<00:02:56.060> obvious

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
from where I live so it was an obvious

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.060 
from where I live so it was an obvious
choice<00:02:56.390> to<00:02:56.870> go<00:02:57.320> to<00:02:57.350> time<00:02:57.620> well<00:02:57.770> because<00:02:57.920> that's

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:58.070 
choice to go to time well because that's

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:59.200 
choice to go to time well because that's
what<00:02:58.220> I've<00:02:58.280> just<00:02:58.430> lay<00:02:58.580> on<00:02:58.610> us<00:02:58.760> all<00:02:59.000> about

similarities<00:03:13.670> here<00:03:14.120> marrying<00:03:14.810> the<00:03:15.020> to<00:03:15.230> the

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
similarities here marrying the to the

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:17.890 
similarities here marrying the to the
dance<00:03:16.040> with<00:03:16.250> music<00:03:16.430> obviously<00:03:17.420> coming<00:03:17.750> from

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
dance with music obviously coming from

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.180 
dance with music obviously coming from
the<00:03:17.989> musicians<00:03:18.380> point<00:03:18.620> of<00:03:18.739> view<00:03:18.890> you<00:03:19.010> have<00:03:19.040> a

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
the musicians point of view you have a

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:21.010 
the musicians point of view you have a
musical<00:03:19.610> phrase<00:03:19.880> musical<00:03:20.360> sentence<00:03:20.780> and

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:21.020 
musical phrase musical sentence and

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:23.110 
musical phrase musical sentence and
that's<00:03:21.680> very<00:03:21.860> much<00:03:22.010> part<00:03:22.370> of<00:03:22.489> the<00:03:22.610> tango<00:03:22.940> dance

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120

that's very much part of the tango dance
as<00:03:23.330> well<00:03:23.360> takes<00:03:24.170> a<00:03:24.260> lot<00:03:24.380> of<00:03:24.440> practice<00:03:24.920> it's<00:03:25.610> not

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 
as well takes a lot of practice it's not

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.540 
as well takes a lot of practice it's not
just<00:03:26.060> a<00:03:26.209> formation<00:03:27.140> of<00:03:27.380> steps<00:03:27.709> but<00:03:27.980> it's<00:03:28.160> it's

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:28.550 
just a formation of steps but it's it's

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:29.740 
just a formation of steps but it's it's
marrying<00:03:29.030> the<00:03:29.150> whole<00:03:29.330> thing<00:03:29.570> together

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:29.750
