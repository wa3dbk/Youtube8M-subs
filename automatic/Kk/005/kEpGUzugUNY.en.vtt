00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
works really weird yeah I meant to play

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.700 
works really weird yeah I meant to play
against<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.309> computer<00:01:02.489> but<00:01:06.710> actually

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
against the computer but actually

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.560 
against the computer but actually
honestly<00:01:08.159> I<00:01:08.280> would<00:01:08.610> I<00:01:08.790> would<00:01:08.939> compare<00:01:09.270> it<00:01:09.330> more

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
honestly I would I would compare it more

honestly I would I would compare it more
two<00:01:09.659> columns<00:01:10.200> than<00:01:10.470> anything<00:01:10.710> else<00:01:17.720> it's<00:01:18.720> just

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780
