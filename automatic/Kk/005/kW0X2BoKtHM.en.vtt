00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:10.920
 hello my name is Julia zaborska this 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:13.110
 the next release of the show x telling you the truth 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.920
 it or not and i'm finally the first hall 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.920
 your exam 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:21.600
 there are still 4 but with school 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:23.670
 6 but if I shoot the video because I 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.769
 already miss the shooting and 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.779
 let's start one girl sent me 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.970
 funny experiment and asked me to 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.040
 checked it in my video this idea 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.440
 It seemed interesting to me and I decided how 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:38.489
 always check for yourself do it 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:40.530
 tattoo at home with help here 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:44.309
 so that's tricky stuff with 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:46.410
 only and that is just baby powder 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.860
 and we need a simple pencil 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:52.079
 tracing paper scissors wet cloth so 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.960
 eye pencil 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.149
 pussy to make up alcohol or vodka and 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.520
 let's begin to follow the instructions for 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.430
 start we need to draw a picture or 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.500
 write a phrase of some kind and they mean 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.140
 it will be with me let it be something 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.979
 very banal and not small his 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:17.150
 The inscription must be drawn on tracing paper and 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:21.869
 cut further need to degrease the skin 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:25.979
 alcohol or vodka and put on that 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:28.380
 place the tracing paper patterned down further take 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:33.420
 wet cloth and press a piece of paper 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:37.340
 picture skin on this place you have 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:41.420
 there will be a trace further need to enter 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.420
 cosmetic eyeliner 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:49.270
 after cutting with pencil you need a few 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:51.520
 wait seconds then sprinkle the tank on 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:54.180
 pattern and evenly distribute with 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.180
 using a brush 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.000
 and sprinkle with hairspray and 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:15.340
 it is written that such a tattoo 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:17.860
 will last you three or four days but 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.840
 is it true the artist of me is not very 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.970
 but now I will show you the result I 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:26.980
 came out satu and timid for about two hours 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:29.860
 I went to wash my hands I did everything 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.870
 instructions but the result is me unfortunately 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.940
 disappointed I read what is better 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.440
 use hydrogen peroxide but to 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.600
 Sorry here is the result I 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:40.650
 also tried with hairspray but 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:43.569
 the result is still the same varnish is also good 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.850
 washed away under water and the tattoo is not 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:47.680
 Unfortunately, this is all 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:50.200
 put your fingers up write your 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.989
