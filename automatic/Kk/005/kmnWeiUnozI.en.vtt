all<00:03:16.129> some<00:03:16.310> types<00:03:16.549> I<00:03:16.849> don't<00:03:17.299> loose<00:03:17.510> whichever

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:26.050 

comes<00:03:21.709> is<00:03:21.860> back

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:31.150 

that's<00:03:26.300> probably<00:03:26.510> ever<00:03:26.810> done<00:03:27.800> that<00:03:29.410> ok<00:03:30.410> so

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.160 
that's probably ever done that ok so

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.430 
that's probably ever done that ok so
again<00:03:31.430> it's<00:03:31.970> a<00:03:32.180> it's<00:03:32.480> a<00:03:32.599> different<00:03:33.200> principle

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.440 
again it's a it's a different principle

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.290 
again it's a it's a different principle
of<00:03:33.950> our<00:03:34.160> thing<00:03:34.459> I'm<00:03:34.580> letting<00:03:34.910> the<00:03:34.940> snip

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:35.300 
of our thing I'm letting the snip

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:40.360 
of our thing I'm letting the snip
buildings<00:03:36.160> ok<00:03:37.160> and<00:03:37.880> then<00:03:38.260> allocate<00:03:39.260> he's<00:03:39.530> he's

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:40.370 
buildings ok and then allocate he's he's

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:43.570 
buildings ok and then allocate he's he's
basing<00:03:40.880> his<00:03:41.120> strength<00:03:41.660> on<00:03:41.989> the<00:03:42.980> stability<00:03:43.220> of

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:43.580 
basing his strength on the stability of

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:46.690 
basing his strength on the stability of
my<00:03:43.790> arms<00:03:44.150> ok<00:03:44.810> but<00:03:45.470> I<00:03:45.530> cabins<00:03:45.860> arm<00:03:46.010> across<00:03:46.250> I

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:46.700 
my arms ok but I cabins arm across I

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:50.740 
my arms ok but I cabins arm across I
just<00:03:47.030> let<00:03:47.209> though<00:03:47.420> once--once<00:03:48.880> exactly<00:03:49.880> you

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:50.750 
just let though once--once exactly you

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.119 
just let though once--once exactly you
crab<00:03:50.989> mean<00:03:51.230> that<00:03:51.470> the<00:03:51.590> stick<00:03:51.890> is<00:03:52.040> again

00:03:53.119 --> 00:03:53.129 
crab mean that the stick is again

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:55.619 
crab mean that the stick is again
he's<00:03:54.129> holed<00:03:54.340> out<00:03:54.459> of<00:03:54.580> me<00:03:54.700> right<00:03:54.940> you<00:03:55.390> let<00:03:55.599> that

00:03:55.619 --> 00:03:55.629 
he's holed out of me right you let that

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:57.270 
he's holed out of me right you let that
go<00:03:55.959> you<00:03:56.260> reach<00:03:56.379> over<00:03:56.590> and<00:03:56.650> grab<00:03:56.769> this<00:03:57.220> thing

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 
go you reach over and grab this thing

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.240 
go you reach over and grab this thing
and<00:03:57.940> as<00:03:58.330> you<00:03:58.540> curl<00:03:58.870> this<00:03:59.140> you<00:03:59.290> live<00:03:59.530> well<00:04:00.129> look

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250 
and as you curl this you live well look

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:01.949 
and as you curl this you live well look
what<00:04:00.340> thats<00:04:00.549> my<00:04:00.700> way<00:04:00.849> to<00:04:00.909> him<00:04:01.180> if<00:04:01.690> they're

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:01.959 
what thats my way to him if they're

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:05.100 
what thats my way to him if they're
turning<00:04:02.440> us<00:04:02.500> back<00:04:02.739> to<00:04:03.010> me<00:04:03.420> okay<00:04:04.420> more<00:04:04.810> time

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:05.110 
turning us back to me okay more time

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:07.430 
turning us back to me okay more time
it's<00:04:05.799> hard<00:04:06.190> to<00:04:06.250> make<00:04:06.459> not<00:04:06.700> happening<00:04:07.150> then

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
it's hard to make not happening then

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:17.849 
it's hard to make not happening then
it's<00:04:08.440> back<00:04:08.709> its<00:04:09.010> turn<00:04:09.450> by<00:04:10.450> doing<00:04:10.780> that<00:04:10.900> motion

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:17.859 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:20.399 

now<00:04:18.400> if<00:04:18.729> he<00:04:18.969> were<00:04:19.180> to<00:04:19.209> grab<00:04:19.539> the<00:04:19.719> stick<00:04:20.019> there's

00:04:20.399 --> 00:04:20.409 
now if he were to grab the stick there's

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:22.369 
now if he were to grab the stick there's
a<00:04:20.469> couple<00:04:20.620> little<00:04:20.889> things<00:04:20.979> we<00:04:21.280> do<00:04:21.430> all<00:04:22.090> right

00:04:22.369 --> 00:04:22.379 
a couple little things we do all right

00:04:22.379 --> 00:04:25.230 
a couple little things we do all right
again<00:04:23.379> it's<00:04:23.770> the<00:04:23.830> same<00:04:24.069> time<00:04:24.370> a<00:04:24.400> principle<00:04:25.000> of

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.240 
again it's the same time a principle of

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:35.040 
again it's the same time a principle of
time<00:04:25.539> your<00:04:25.689> spanish<00:04:31.139> right<00:04:33.900> now<00:04:34.900> he's

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
time your spanish right now he's

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:41.070 
time your spanish right now he's
grabbing<00:04:35.409> to<00:04:35.469> stick<00:04:35.969> let<00:04:36.969> go<00:04:39.539> same<00:04:40.539> thing<00:04:40.870> and

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:41.080 
grabbing to stick let go same thing and

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:47.219 
grabbing to stick let go same thing and
do<00:04:41.229> the<00:04:41.289> same<00:04:41.500> thing<00:04:43.680> gotta<00:04:45.810> hold<00:04:46.810> the<00:04:46.960> stick

00:04:47.219 --> 00:04:47.229 
do the same thing gotta hold the stick

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:55.129 
do the same thing gotta hold the stick
let<00:04:47.830> them<00:04:48.270> listen<00:04:49.270> yeah<00:04:49.810> just<00:04:50.080> goes<00:04:50.289> hit

00:04:55.129 --> 00:04:55.139 

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:59.010 

number<00:04:56.139> 10<00:04:56.439> this<00:04:56.590> day<00:04:56.889> because<00:04:57.729> their<00:04:58.060> brain

00:04:59.010 --> 00:04:59.020 
number 10 this day because their brain

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:01.980 
number 10 this day because their brain
is<00:04:59.229> going<00:04:59.409> back<00:05:00.419> looking<00:05:01.419> good<00:05:01.509> that<00:05:01.779> I<00:05:01.930> think

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:01.990 
is going back looking good that I think

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:11.040 
is going back looking good that I think
are<00:05:02.259> gone<00:05:02.500> yeah<00:05:02.949> yeah<00:05:03.759> I<00:05:03.789> forgot<00:05:07.800> so<00:05:09.930> look<00:05:10.930> this

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:11.050 
are gone yeah yeah I forgot so look this

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:13.920 
are gone yeah yeah I forgot so look this
is<00:05:11.229> a<00:05:11.259> technique<00:05:12.300> this<00:05:13.300> way<00:05:13.479> so<00:05:13.539> if<00:05:13.779> he's

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:13.930 
is a technique this way so if he's

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:14.830 
is a technique this way so if he's
famous

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:14.840 
famous

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:16.960 
famous
actually<00:05:15.260> getting<00:05:15.530> poor<00:05:15.800> goes<00:05:15.980> right<00:05:16.310> and

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:16.970 
actually getting poor goes right and

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:18.790 
actually getting poor goes right and
