00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:05.950
 video and friends more to cortito nothing more 

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:08.290
 I wanted to show you an application that 

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:10.599
 I found on the place thor and I wanted 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:13.919
 teach them to you since this 

00:00:10.599 --> 00:00:13.919
 application flips quite 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:22.000
 It is a screen that notifies you 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:25.910
 all your notifications either from a 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.640
 gmail or a facebook notification 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:30.510
 or if you're using a new ass 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.180
 publication 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:36.780
 or if you have instagram that notifies 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:39.480
 also if someone is following you 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.160
 any other application that you always 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.920
 notify not also in messages 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.600
 of texts or missed calls I'm going to 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.339
 kiko quickly show times I 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.710
 the lock screen normally 

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:50.719
 activated 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.980
 you can leave the phone here here I have 

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:55.210
 the tablet I'm going to send a message 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.210
 through the hangout 

00:00:55.240 --> 00:01:00.540
 you will flip friends with this application 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:00.540
 what will I teach you now 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.790
 and as you can see , the application was reactivated 

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:07.210
 basically what this application will 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:11.080
 allows is 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:13.210
 Do not miss any news that comes out 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:16.479
 this case appears here the icon of 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:18.640
 the hangouts and as a curve animation 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:20.550
 there is as if it were like it would be loading 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.580
 Battery 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:26.780
 that he sends me another message I'm not 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.780
 touching anything on the phone 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.249
 we're going to wait 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.720
 and as you see, the application was activated 

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:47.570
 alone you do not have to do anything 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:50.510
 and if you hit him here the gene icon 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:52.880
 gauss you have a shortcut here 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:55.280
 above the messages that you just got 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:58.100
 send in this case if you want to enter 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.760
 you just choose the icon and you launch for 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.170
 above 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.930
 As you can see here we have all the 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.060
 messages that we are sending 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.500
 as I told you this application is hangout 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.530
 that it works with any other application 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.390
 If you are using facebook you arrive 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.170
 notifications or missed calls or 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.170
 lost messages 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:20.260
 works on any phone

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.340
