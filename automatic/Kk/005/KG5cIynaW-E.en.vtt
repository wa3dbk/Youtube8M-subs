bass is pumping now I do actually have
to<00:01:36.130> mention<00:01:36.280> one<00:01:36.579> thing<00:01:36.759> although<00:01:37.030> this<00:01:37.360> isn't

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 
to mention one thing although this isn't

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.780 
to mention one thing although this isn't
technically<00:01:38.170> a<00:01:38.290> subwoofer<00:01:38.710> it<00:01:39.040> is<00:01:39.310> an<00:01:39.490> 8<00:01:39.729> inch

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:39.790 
technically a subwoofer it is an 8 inch

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:41.910 
technically a subwoofer it is an 8 inch
driver<00:01:40.390> so<00:01:40.720> it's<00:01:40.869> pretty<00:01:41.110> big<00:01:41.409> and<00:01:41.649> you're

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920 
driver so it's pretty big and you're

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.649 
driver so it's pretty big and you're
going<00:01:42.159> to<00:01:42.220> get<00:01:42.430> a<00:01:42.460> very<00:01:42.790> nice<00:01:43.030> frequency

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:43.659 
going to get a very nice frequency

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:45.330 
going to get a very nice frequency
distribution<00:01:44.350> chart<00:01:44.590> and<00:01:44.799> you're<00:01:45.159> pretty

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.340 
distribution chart and you're pretty

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:46.709 
distribution chart and you're pretty
much<00:01:45.460> going<00:01:45.610> to<00:01:45.670> have<00:01:45.729> a<00:01:45.850> completely<00:01:46.479> flat

00:01:46.709 --> 00:01:46.719 
much going to have a completely flat

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:48.780 
much going to have a completely flat
response<00:01:47.110> so<00:01:47.649> you<00:01:47.680> won't<00:01:47.950> get<00:01:48.100> an<00:01:48.310> extremely

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:48.790 
response so you won't get an extremely

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:50.520 
response so you won't get an extremely
high<00:01:49.090> amount<00:01:49.119> of<00:01:49.509> bass<00:01:49.689> or<00:01:49.930> high<00:01:50.140> amount<00:01:50.409> of

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530 
high amount of bass or high amount of

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.039 
high amount of bass or high amount of
highs<00:01:51.070> the<00:01:51.640> tweeter<00:01:51.939> and<00:01:52.060> the<00:01:52.420> woofer<00:01:52.869> are

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:53.049 
highs the tweeter and the woofer are

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:55.260 
highs the tweeter and the woofer are
very<00:01:53.229> nicely<00:01:53.439> balanced<00:01:54.040> out<00:01:54.159> so<00:01:54.490> that<00:01:54.759> giant

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
very nicely balanced out so that giant

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:56.760 
very nicely balanced out so that giant
driver<00:01:55.479> isn't<00:01:55.930> going<00:01:56.049> to<00:01:56.140> be<00:01:56.200> a<00:01:56.229> problem<00:01:56.530> and

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:56.770 
driver isn't going to be a problem and

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:58.679 
driver isn't going to be a problem and
doesn't<00:01:57.460> actually<00:01:57.610> move<00:01:57.969> that<00:01:58.119> much<00:01:58.329> it<00:01:58.509> does

00:01:58.679 --> 00:01:58.689 
doesn't actually move that much it does

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:01.590 
doesn't actually move that much it does
have<00:01:58.869> a<00:01:58.899> nice<00:01:59.079> crisp<00:01:59.590> clean<00:02:00.189> bass<00:02:00.789> so<00:02:01.390> to<00:02:01.450> take

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:01.600 
have a nice crisp clean bass so to take

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:02.730 
have a nice crisp clean bass so to take
a<00:02:01.659> closer<00:02:01.930> look<00:02:02.110> at<00:02:02.259> the<00:02:02.320> back<00:02:02.500> of<00:02:02.680> the

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
a closer look at the back of the

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.410 
a closer look at the back of the
speakers<00:02:03.130> they're<00:02:03.340> actually<00:02:03.759> not<00:02:03.909> that<00:02:03.969> bad<00:02:04.360> a

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420 
speakers they're actually not that bad a

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:05.850 
speakers they're actually not that bad a
lot<00:02:04.659> of<00:02:04.780> studio<00:02:05.110> monitors<00:02:05.500> can<00:02:05.680> be
