 Hi guys! 

00:00:09.285 --> 00:00:16.000
 Today I'm here to showcase my new invention: The LEGO Pen Drive 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.700
 which has three advantages: Unlike this common pen drive, 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:30.700
 he does not need to wear this kind of hood, it's easier not to lose, 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.300
 it will not break if someone drops it on the floor, 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.400
 do not use CLUCA or other glue. . . 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.300
 also does not need to CUT (does not damage) Lego blocks, 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:58.500
 and, in addition, it is RETRACTORY, does not need removable cover, 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:06.800
 You do not have to take the cover off because there is no cover, right? 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:23.500
 Guys, these are the pieces you're going to need to assemble the new cover. 

00:01:23.788 --> 00:01:26.200
 Of course, your broken pen drive. 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.400
 Well, let's start the assembly, right? 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.000
 Look! 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:11.000
 It's all just like this other pen drive. 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:18.000
 This chain is meant to be like this string. 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:30.500
 And there's this little pussy, that's for you to do here, oh. 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.000
 TCHAN-RAN !!! 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
 And when you no longer want to use the pen drive. . . 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:41.500
 . . . now balls, take off the chick,. . 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:47.500
 . . . go in the front and tighten the USB connector here. 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:57.000
 Like I said before, it's retractable, you do not need a cap. 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.000
 Then you keep the little chick up here. . . 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.900
 . . .and hangs the thumb drive 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:11.500
 Now let's see the pen drive working! 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:27.000
 The pen drive icon will appear here. . . Did they see it? 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.400
 Wait, let me close this window. 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.000
 That's it, people. 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:42.000
 I left a file that has the assembly instructions on the cover of the pen drive. 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:47.500
 So if you liked this video from my pen drive. . . 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.300
 . . .Go there and hit the "I liked it" button, did you? 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:55.700
 And it subscribes to my YouTube channel. 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:19.000
 WAIT! ! !
