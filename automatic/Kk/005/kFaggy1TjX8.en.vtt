00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
talking about here there's the lumbar

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.330 
talking about here there's the lumbar
which<00:00:36.600> is<00:00:36.750> everything<00:00:36.960> below<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:37.770> ribcage

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
which is everything below the ribcage

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.030 
which is everything below the ribcage
and<00:00:38.879> then<00:00:39.690> there's<00:00:39.840> a<00:00:39.899> thoracic<00:00:40.530> section<00:00:40.739> of

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
and then there's a thoracic section of

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.889 
and then there's a thoracic section of
your<00:00:41.129> back<00:00:41.340> which<00:00:41.579> is<00:00:41.790> the<00:00:41.910> part<00:00:42.180> right<00:00:42.840> there

your back which is the part right there
at<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:43.530> ribcage<00:00:43.760> now<00:00:44.760> you'll<00:00:44.940> notice<00:00:45.180> when

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
at the ribcage now you'll notice when

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.180 
at the ribcage now you'll notice when
we're<00:00:45.719> talking<00:00:45.840> about<00:00:46.050> thoracic<00:00:46.739> rounding

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
we're talking about thoracic rounding

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.490 
we're talking about thoracic rounding
that<00:00:47.399> is<00:00:47.640> what<00:00:48.510> I'm<00:00:48.660> doing<00:00:48.989> they're<00:00:49.110> rounding

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
that is what I'm doing they're rounding

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.900 
that is what I'm doing they're rounding
the<00:00:49.590> upper<00:00:49.620> back<00:00:49.770> don't<00:00:50.100> be<00:00:50.250> confused<00:00:50.640> with<00:00:50.850> my

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
the upper back don't be confused with my

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.889 
the upper back don't be confused with my
start<00:00:51.449> position<00:00:52.010> before<00:00:53.010> I<00:00:53.250> drop<00:00:53.670> down<00:00:53.940> versus

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
start position before I drop down versus

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.590 
start position before I drop down versus
the<00:00:54.989> position<00:00:55.410> of<00:00:55.530> my<00:00:55.680> back<00:00:55.890> when<00:00:56.160> I<00:00:56.190> actually

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:56.600 
the position of my back when I actually

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.420 
the position of my back when I actually
apply<00:00:57.600> weight<00:00:57.930> to<00:00:58.109> it<00:00:58.260> because<00:00:59.039> you'll<00:00:59.190> you

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
apply weight to it because you'll you

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.130 
apply weight to it because you'll you
guys<00:00:59.579> will<00:00:59.760> notice<00:00:59.879> I<00:01:00.090> do<00:01:00.149> a<00:01:00.270> hip<00:01:00.570> drop<00:01:00.870> and

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
that's to tighten up and pull the slack

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.000 
that's to tighten up and pull the slack
out<00:01:03.390> of<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.539> bar<00:01:03.750> so<00:01:04.320> what<00:01:04.470> I<00:01:04.500> do<00:01:04.619> is<00:01:04.799> that<00:01:04.890> I

if you guys would you guys see me up
there<00:01:22.170> higher<00:01:22.530> and<00:01:22.920> it's<00:01:23.250> rounded<00:01:23.670> also<00:01:24.090> I

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
there higher and it's rounded also I

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.929 
there higher and it's rounded also I
have<00:01:25.530> no<00:01:25.830> weight<00:01:26.040> on<00:01:26.189> it<00:01:26.340> any<00:01:26.490> more<00:01:26.670> than<00:01:26.820> you

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
have no weight on it any more than you

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.190 
have no weight on it any more than you
just<00:01:27.150> bending<00:01:27.390> over<00:01:27.450> and<00:01:27.659> touching<00:01:27.930> your<00:01:28.049> toes

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
just bending over and touching your toes

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.780 
just bending over and touching your toes
I'm<00:01:28.409> not<00:01:28.560> actually<00:01:28.710> putting<00:01:29.250> any<00:01:29.460> weight<00:01:29.549> on

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
I'm not actually putting any weight on

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.030 
I'm not actually putting any weight on
it<00:01:29.970> from<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.360> deadlift<00:01:30.689> so<00:01:31.409> I<00:01:31.439> drop<00:01:31.740> it<00:01:31.890> into

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
it from the deadlift so I drop it into

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.859 
it from the deadlift so I drop it into
that<00:01:32.159> position<00:01:32.340> at<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.119> last<00:01:33.390> second<00:01:33.750> before

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
that position at the last second before

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.039 
that position at the last second before
I<00:01:34.020> pull<00:01:34.490> but<00:01:35.490> I<00:01:35.670> do<00:01:35.790> use<00:01:36.180> thoracic<00:01:36.720> rounding

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
I pull but I do use thoracic rounding

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.810 
I pull but I do use thoracic rounding
and<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.200> reason<00:01:37.530> you<00:01:37.619> use<00:01:37.740> thoracic<00:01:38.310> rounding

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
and the reason you use thoracic rounding

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.880 
and the reason you use thoracic rounding
is<00:01:38.970> that<00:01:39.210> it<00:01:39.600> is<00:01:39.810> an<00:01:39.960> advanced<00:01:40.350> technique<00:01:40.470> that

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
is that it is an advanced technique that

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.859 
is that it is an advanced technique that
lets<00:01:41.070> you<00:01:41.250> put<00:01:41.490> more<00:01:41.880> muscles<00:01:42.270> of<00:01:42.360> your<00:01:42.509> back

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
lets you put more muscles of your back

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.710 
lets you put more muscles of your back
into<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.439> pole<00:01:43.649> it<00:01:44.579> can<00:01:44.759> get<00:01:44.880> you<00:01:45.000> more<00:01:45.270> speed

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
into the pole it can get you more speed

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.780 
into the pole it can get you more speed
out<00:01:45.930> of<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.110> bottom<00:01:46.470> because<00:01:47.310> it<00:01:47.460> lets<00:01:47.670> you

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
out of the bottom because it lets you

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.130 
out of the bottom because it lets you
bat<00:01:48.090> do<00:01:48.360> more<00:01:48.600> of<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:48.750> work<00:01:48.899> in<00:01:49.049> your

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
bat do more of the work in your

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.359 
bat do more of the work in your
hamstrings<00:01:49.619> it<00:01:49.770> shifts<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.100> load<00:01:50.340> just

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
hamstrings it shifts the load just

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.490 
hamstrings it shifts the load just
slightly<00:01:50.880> and<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.390> muscles<00:01:51.720> of<00:01:51.810> your<00:01:52.049> your

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
slightly and the muscles of your your

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.340 
slightly and the muscles of your your
back<00:01:52.710> your<00:01:52.950> lats<00:01:53.450> your<00:01:54.450> thoracic<00:01:54.659> erectors

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
back your lats your thoracic erectors

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.109 
back your lats your thoracic erectors
your<00:01:55.680> traps<00:01:55.979> all<00:01:56.189> those<00:01:56.430> muscles<00:01:56.880> are

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
your traps all those muscles are

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.389 
your traps all those muscles are
stronger<00:01:57.659> than<00:01:57.750> your<00:01:57.899> hamstrings<00:01:58.399> because

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
stronger than your hamstrings because

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.550 
stronger than your hamstrings because
it's<00:01:59.759> a<00:01:59.850> larger<00:02:00.420> combination<00:02:00.930> of<00:02:01.020> muscles<00:02:01.409> so

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
it's a larger combination of muscles so

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.020 
it's a larger combination of muscles so
it<00:02:01.710> lets<00:02:01.920> you<00:02:02.040> get<00:02:02.250> more<00:02:02.399> power<00:02:02.670> out<00:02:02.759> at<00:02:02.969> the

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
it lets you get more power out at the

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.999 
it lets you get more power out at the
bottom<00:02:03.329> so<00:02:03.990> that's<00:02:04.110> why<00:02:04.350> it's<00:02:04.530> used<00:02:04.770> now<00:02:04.890> the

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
bottom so that's why it's used now the

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.580 
bottom so that's why it's used now the
problem<00:02:05.490> with<00:02:05.640> it<00:02:05.670> is<00:02:05.880> that<00:02:06.149> a<00:02:06.479> lot<00:02:07.140> of<00:02:07.320> first

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
problem with it is that a lot of first

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.279 
problem with it is that a lot of first
year<00:02:07.920> and<00:02:08.399> even<00:02:08.580> second-year<00:02:09.300> lifters<00:02:09.810> do<00:02:10.110> not

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
year and even second-year lifters do not

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.430 
year and even second-year lifters do not
have<00:02:10.739> the<00:02:11.610> motor<00:02:11.879> control<00:02:12.390> or<00:02:12.629> body<00:02:12.959> awareness

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
have the motor control or body awareness

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.890 
have the motor control or body awareness
or

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
awareness to execute this safely and so

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:19.830 
awareness to execute this safely and so
they're<00:02:18.519> running<00:02:18.700> a<00:02:18.909> risk<00:02:19.120> of<00:02:19.239> actually<00:02:19.659> they

they're running a risk of actually they

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.240 
they're running a risk of actually they
can't<00:02:20.049> tell<00:02:20.200> the<00:02:20.319> difference<00:02:20.650> between<00:02:20.769> their

thoracic directors and their spinal

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.740 
thoracic directors and their spinal
erectors<00:02:22.780> and<00:02:23.370> they're<00:02:24.370> at<00:02:24.640> risk<00:02:25.060> of<00:02:25.299> rounding

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
erectors and they're at risk of rounding

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.839 
erectors and they're at risk of rounding
their<00:02:25.900> lower<00:02:26.140> back<00:02:26.409> which<00:02:27.129> is<00:02:27.280> what<00:02:27.430> you<00:02:27.610> don't

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:27.849 
their lower back which is what you don't

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:29.610 
their lower back which is what you don't
want<00:02:28.000> that<00:02:28.329> is<00:02:28.480> what<00:02:28.629> becomes<00:02:28.930> dangerous<00:02:29.470> on<00:02:29.590> a

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
want that is what becomes dangerous on a

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.440 
want that is what becomes dangerous on a
deadlift<00:02:30.040> that<00:02:30.220> is<00:02:30.370> what<00:02:30.579> can<00:02:30.849> actually<00:02:31.299> hurt

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
deadlift that is what can actually hurt

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:32.729 
deadlift that is what can actually hurt
you<00:02:31.629> on<00:02:31.780> the<00:02:31.870> movement<00:02:32.170> is<00:02:32.260> the<00:02:32.349> rounding<00:02:32.650> at

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:32.739 
you on the movement is the rounding at

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:36.420 
you on the movement is the rounding at
the<00:02:32.829> lower<00:02:33.040> back<00:02:34.680> so<00:02:35.680> that<00:02:35.829> is<00:02:35.980> why<00:02:36.189> it<00:02:36.250> makes

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
the lower back so that is why it makes

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.190 
the lower back so that is why it makes
it<00:02:36.730> an<00:02:36.849> advanced<00:02:37.299> technique<00:02:37.810> even<00:02:37.989> though

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
it an advanced technique even though

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.960 
it an advanced technique even though
it's<00:02:38.349> a<00:02:38.409> superior<00:02:38.890> technique<00:02:39.280> potentially

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
it's a superior technique potentially

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:41.759 
it's a superior technique potentially
let<00:02:40.510> you<00:02:40.659> recruit<00:02:40.989> more<00:02:41.200> muscles<00:02:41.590> on<00:02:41.680> the<00:02:41.739> back

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:41.769 
let you recruit more muscles on the back

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:44.610 
let you recruit more muscles on the back
and<00:02:42.159> lift<00:02:42.340> more<00:02:42.489> weight<00:02:42.879> it<00:02:43.569> is<00:02:43.599> dangerous<00:02:44.439> for

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
and lift more weight it is dangerous for

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.259 
and lift more weight it is dangerous for
those<00:02:44.769> who<00:02:44.980> do<00:02:45.159> not<00:02:45.189> have<00:02:45.340> the<00:02:45.760> body<00:02:45.970> awareness

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:46.269 
those who do not have the body awareness

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:47.640 
those who do not have the body awareness
to<00:02:46.629> tell<00:02:46.810> the<00:02:46.930> difference<00:02:47.260> between<00:02:47.349> the

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
to tell the difference between the

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.099 
to tell the difference between the
different<00:02:47.950> directors<00:02:48.250> in<00:02:48.400> their<00:02:48.519> body

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:49.109 
different directors in their body

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:52.920 
different directors in their body
because<00:02:50.670> the<00:02:51.670> thoracic<00:02:52.030> erectors<00:02:52.599> will<00:02:52.780> be

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
because the thoracic erectors will be

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.780 
because the thoracic erectors will be
rounded<00:02:53.849> but<00:02:54.849> the<00:02:54.970> spinal<00:02:55.420> erectors<00:02:55.540> will<00:02:56.049> not

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
rounded but the spinal erectors will not

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.369 
rounded but the spinal erectors will not
and<00:02:57.790> so<00:02:58.329> there's<00:02:58.510> a<00:02:58.569> big<00:02:58.780> difference<00:02:59.170> there

00:02:59.369 --> 00:02:59.379 
and so there's a big difference there

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:00.990 
and so there's a big difference there
and<00:02:59.409> again<00:03:00.129> it<00:03:00.250> comes<00:03:00.340> down<00:03:00.459> to<00:03:00.730> body

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
and again it comes down to body

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.599 
and again it comes down to body
awareness<00:03:01.329> practice<00:03:02.019> technique<00:03:02.889> amount<00:03:03.489> of

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:03.609 
awareness practice technique amount of

00:03:03.609 --> 00:03:05.250 
awareness practice technique amount of
years<00:03:03.790> of<00:03:03.970> lifting<00:03:04.299> before<00:03:04.569> you<00:03:04.720> incorporate

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
years of lifting before you incorporate

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.229 
years of lifting before you incorporate
something<00:03:05.590> like<00:03:05.739> this<00:03:06.000> because<00:03:07.000> if<00:03:07.120> you're

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239 
something like this because if you're

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:08.869 
something like this because if you're
not<00:03:07.389> ready<00:03:07.659> yet<00:03:07.870> it's<00:03:08.049> potentially<00:03:08.650> dangerous

00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:08.879 
not ready yet it's potentially dangerous

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:11.910 
not ready yet it's potentially dangerous
but<00:03:09.879> it's<00:03:10.060> perfectly<00:03:10.569> safe<00:03:10.959> for<00:03:11.019> advanced

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
but it's perfectly safe for advanced

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.319 
but it's perfectly safe for advanced
lifters<00:03:12.069> there<00:03:12.459> are<00:03:12.519> plenty<00:03:12.819> of<00:03:12.849> guys<00:03:13.030> who

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:13.329 
lifters there are plenty of guys who

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:15.479 
lifters there are plenty of guys who
have<00:03:13.450> dead<00:03:13.659> lifted<00:03:14.019> repeatedly<00:03:14.560> 900<00:03:15.189> or<00:03:15.310> even

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:15.489 
have dead lifted repeatedly 900 or even

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:17.879 
have dead lifted repeatedly 900 or even
a<00:03:15.549> thousand<00:03:15.970> pounds<00:03:16.239> this<00:03:16.329> way<00:03:16.540> who<00:03:17.530> show<00:03:17.859> no

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:17.889 
a thousand pounds this way who show no

00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:20.490 
a thousand pounds this way who show no
signs<00:03:18.400> whatsoever<00:03:18.639> of<00:03:19.090> back<00:03:19.239> problems<00:03:19.629> but

signs whatsoever of back problems but

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.500

again<00:03:20.919> it<00:03:21.129> is<00:03:21.160> for<00:03:21.489> advanced<00:03:21.910> lifters<00:03:22.150> you

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
again it is for advanced lifters you

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:24.659 
again it is for advanced lifters you
have<00:03:22.750> the<00:03:22.930> body<00:03:23.139> awareness<00:03:23.530> and<00:03:24.099> have<00:03:24.549> the
