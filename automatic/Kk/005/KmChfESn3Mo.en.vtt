00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:05.700
 good guys everything good 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:09.660
 Good, I posted a picture of mine. 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:12.780
 this week in the group and the staff 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.410
 Did you really want to know how I 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.240
 made 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.840
 and I wanted me to do a tutorial 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:22.500
 how to do it here that you 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:26.490
 are seeing how to paste the 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:30.359
 zh manga case on the bedroom wall 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:32.430
 let's do it the studio is good 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:37.820
 what are we going to do first select 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:41.219
 a water here that you do not like be 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:43.530
 destroyed by moths and such as 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:46.410
 It's not going to be missing in your collection. 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:51.230
 I picked up the remains of da hq that I used 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.230
 to make this wall 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:57.989
 here the rest of it 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:01.199
 Good, what do we do first? 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:04.170
 speed up work like the hqs by 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:06.360
 this example here is the wave here batman 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.080
 black and white I never spoke with the hq mas 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.990
 okay 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:14.400
 the hqs they companies by two staples one 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:17.220
 here and another over white tires 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.799
 these clips that will facilitate the 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:23.610
 work because it will be so you will 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:25.950
 to have two pages to paste on time is in 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:31.189
 relation to the manga is already a bit difficult 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.189
 because the manga show here 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:38.670
 also would not use 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:41.220
 it does not have white then it 's through 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.350
 of glue even a special glue that they 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.970
 come here at the base to paste it 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.369
 the pages then you would have to 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:50.159
 highlighting page by page which is more 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:52.680
 work and in relation to manga is more 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.689
 work because because in addition to 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.880
 highlights page by page 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.680
 the manga pages are much smaller than the 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.899
 that the hq 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.899
 then it will be a longer job 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:09.840
 in relation to gluing 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:12.989
 you can paste the team the type of 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.830
 glue glue would be normal white glue or 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:17.550
 you do 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:19.950
 prom two tubes of glue a small in this 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.750
 here the fillet of glue comes out and a 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.640
 big right 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:27.390
 even larger than this depending on the wall 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:32.640
 what do you do you will never catch 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:36.930
 We're not here the tube of glue and that 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:38.730
 great ne and brush take a brush and 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:42.060
 pass the wall 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:44.430
 never do it because I did it on 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:47.310
 part of manga and it was not legal because 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:51.180
 because the pages were disclosed in 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:53.190
 wall and if you noticed here was 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.910
 very bad the cattle are seeing this part 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.790
 on here 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:59.820
 Here I did it myself as it was 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:01.770
 released here because I was already half 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:05.100
 stressed that the three days were already gone 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:08.580
 doing this and taking manga page 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:11.760
 it takes too long for you to stick by 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:13.560
 they are too small then takes 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.870
 keep playing this way, it's not legal 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:19.380
 It's okay for you to do this here. 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:21.030
 You take a little this little girl. 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:24.959
 and pass here 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:26.670
 well in the middle is not because it has the fold 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:30.980
 sometimes passes in the middle for his power 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:30.980
 well, boot device here 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:44.640
 everything passes in the middle ready you do 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:48.030
 here they do here and put I'm going to do 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:53.720
 to show you why I 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:57.150
 I dragged the sextant from here. 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:04:00.090
 my saga only bound and without 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:02.480
 I want to destroy here a piece of 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:02.480
 wall 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:08.250
 I'll show you to see that way, do not stay. 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:12.000
 on trial is the best way to 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:14.070
 passing the hqs to make the collage is 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.260
 this way it's so slow you're faster 

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:18.799
 There's a person with you helping you. 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:22.500
 better still because when the person is 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:25.450
 doing this by putting the collages in the 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:29.890
 wall past the glue 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:32.230
 is the naga you are speeding and to 

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:35.110
 to keep everything tidy 

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:36.970
 Here you see a queue goes all 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:38.500
 another comes easy because everything from one 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:40.690
 standard size 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:43.690
 You pass up there and more following 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:46.960
 this pattern of the line has still opted 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:50.580
 do what I did I cut aa page 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:50.580
 I 'll put it here for you to see how the 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:05:02.610
 here take the page to pass glue here 

00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:02.610
 the page that means underneath 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:24.630
 the other page left and album cover 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:29.550
 quick you pass up here 

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:29.550
 adele enough the wall is super easy 

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:57.640
 the device was all made in that but there 

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:59.530
 It's all so cute so do not be 

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:04.240
 I made it here because it 's with 

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:06.850
 patience is such a great way 

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:09.100
 so when I'm done here, it's just 

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:11.890
 you recharge recharge continue 

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:15.190
 using what's the easiest way more 

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:17.620
 fast you use with the one brush 

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:19.180
 little of the collection a battalion 

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:20.890
 I'll make a video later if you guys 

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:24.400
 want to show the entire collection all 

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:27.640
 much here and that's what I hope 

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:30.130
 so if you want you can also 

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:33.460
 Come see this and I bought this varnish 

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:34.480
 to pass only a test but until 

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:36.580
 I did not take the test today. 

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:38.620
 I bought one to do a test in some 

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:39.380
 Part of it to stay cool but still 

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:41.900
 I can not 

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:43.370
 because you are going to give a lot more work 

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:44.660
 so I hope I have helped you 

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:48.020
 huh 

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:50.200
 with this little tutorial and even the 

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:50.200
 next
