00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.009 
them by nothing they can you know get
for<00:02:28.790> them<00:02:28.880> money<00:02:29.060> for<00:02:29.299> and<00:02:29.510> I<00:02:29.540> think<00:02:29.569> that's<00:02:29.900> a

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:30.019 
for them money for and I think that's a

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:31.900 
for them money for and I think that's a
big<00:02:30.170> waste<00:02:30.380> and<00:02:30.739> the<00:02:31.069> thing<00:02:31.190> is<00:02:31.250> the<00:02:31.459> band<00:02:31.700> is

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
big waste and the thing is the band is

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:33.520 
big waste and the thing is the band is
actually<00:02:32.239> maybe<00:02:32.360> better<00:02:32.690> Photoshop<00:02:33.230> over<00:02:33.440> the

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
actually maybe better Photoshop over the

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:34.930 
actually maybe better Photoshop over the
years<00:02:33.680> because<00:02:33.829> I've<00:02:34.010> had<00:02:34.040> to<00:02:34.459> make<00:02:34.489> things

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
years because I've had to make things

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.210 
years because I've had to make things
like<00:02:35.569> Flyers<00:02:36.049> badges<00:02:36.530> t-shirts<00:02:36.860> is<00:02:36.980> no<00:02:37.099> one

the<00:03:06.910> team<00:03:07.090> but<00:03:07.299> we<00:03:07.900> never<00:03:08.019> faint<00:03:08.349> knife<00:03:08.860> in<00:03:09.010> a

00:03:09.089 --> 00:03:09.099 
the team but we never faint knife in a

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:11.699 
the team but we never faint knife in a
suitable<00:03:09.430> place<00:03:10.360> yet<00:03:10.720> they<00:03:11.349> would<00:03:11.470> part<00:03:11.650> with

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709 
suitable place yet they would part with

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:16.650 
suitable place yet they would part with
our<00:03:11.860> noise<00:03:12.420> dearly<00:03:14.849> you<00:03:15.849> know<00:03:15.940> playing<00:03:16.299> but

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660 
our noise dearly you know playing but

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:19.140 
our noise dearly you know playing but
rehearsin<00:03:17.290> is<00:03:17.500> more<00:03:18.370> important<00:03:18.880> as<00:03:18.970> well<00:03:19.120> I

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
rehearsin is more important as well I

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:20.839 
rehearsin is more important as well I
think<00:03:19.450> a<00:03:19.630> band<00:03:19.870> whose<00:03:20.110> and<00:03:20.290> development

00:03:20.839 --> 00:03:20.849 
think a band whose and development

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:22.830 
think a band whose and development
shouldn't<00:03:21.849> get<00:03:22.030> too<00:03:22.090> much<00:03:22.480> they<00:03:22.690> should

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
shouldn't get too much they should

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.240 
shouldn't get too much they should
probably<00:03:22.930> spend<00:03:23.230> more<00:03:23.440> time<00:03:23.620> with<00:03:23.860> Harrison

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
probably spend more time with Harrison

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.520 
probably spend more time with Harrison
and<00:03:24.370> getting<00:03:24.610> bare<00:03:24.819> as<00:03:25.000> a<00:03:25.030> band<00:03:25.299> because<00:03:26.170> you

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
and getting bare as a band because you

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.050 
and getting bare as a band because you
know<00:03:26.620> once<00:03:27.040> they're<00:03:27.190> on<00:03:27.250> stage<00:03:27.579> they<00:03:27.640> can

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
know once they're on stage they can

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.449 
know once they're on stage they can
improve<00:03:28.360> the<00:03:28.930> nuances<00:03:29.470> of<00:03:29.530> the<00:03:29.890> zones<00:03:30.160> you

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 
improve the nuances of the zones you
