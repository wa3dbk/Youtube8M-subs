since<00:00:01.319> the<00:00:01.530> Irate<00:00:01.949> microphone<00:00:02.550> seems<00:00:02.879> to<00:00:03.000> be

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:03.120 
since the Irate microphone seems to be

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:04.999 
since the Irate microphone seems to be
actually<00:00:03.300> doing<00:00:03.780> a<00:00:03.929> very<00:00:04.200> good<00:00:04.290> job<00:00:04.440> I'm<00:00:04.859> going

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
actually doing a very good job I'm going

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:07.010 
actually doing a very good job I'm going
to<00:00:05.069> continue<00:00:05.339> using<00:00:05.670> it<00:00:05.910> but<00:00:06.629> I<00:00:06.690> thought<00:00:06.899> it'd

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
to continue using it but I thought it'd

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:08.509 
to continue using it but I thought it'd
be<00:00:07.049> quite<00:00:07.259> interesting<00:00:07.859> to<00:00:07.890> get<00:00:08.160> rid<00:00:08.280> of<00:00:08.309> the

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
be quite interesting to get rid of the

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:10.730 
be quite interesting to get rid of the
explosive<00:00:09.059> pops<00:00:09.360> you<00:00:09.809> occasionally<00:00:10.170> get<00:00:10.410> when

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
explosive pops you occasionally get when

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.879 
explosive pops you occasionally get when
I<00:00:11.010> accidentally<00:00:11.610> a<00:00:12.049> speak<00:00:13.049> rate<00:00:13.320> directly<00:00:13.769> at

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
I accidentally a speak rate directly at

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:15.440 
I accidentally a speak rate directly at
ER<00:00:13.920> and<00:00:14.250> you<00:00:14.280> know<00:00:14.759> when<00:00:14.880> you<00:00:14.969> see<00:00:15.120> letters

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
ER and you know when you see letters

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.180 
ER and you know when you see letters
like<00:00:15.570> P<00:00:15.870> you<00:00:16.139> get<00:00:16.320> quite<00:00:16.500> a<00:00:16.529> puff<00:00:16.920> of<00:00:17.070> wind

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
like P you get quite a puff of wind

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.189 
like P you get quite a puff of wind
comes<00:00:17.490> out<00:00:17.670> and<00:00:17.880> it<00:00:18.000> can<00:00:18.180> make<00:00:18.300> a<00:00:18.510> loud<00:00:18.930> pop

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
comes out and it can make a loud pop

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:20.990 
comes out and it can make a loud pop
noise<00:00:19.350> on<00:00:19.920> the<00:00:20.130> microphone<00:00:20.460> so<00:00:20.730> thought<00:00:20.880> it'd

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
noise on the microphone so thought it'd

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.370 
noise on the microphone so thought it'd
be<00:00:21.029> interesting<00:00:21.119> to<00:00:21.660> see<00:00:21.779> if<00:00:21.840> I<00:00:21.960> could<00:00:22.080> reduce

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
be interesting to see if I could reduce

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.710 
be interesting to see if I could reduce
that<00:00:22.590> by<00:00:22.830> making<00:00:23.609> a<00:00:23.670> fur<00:00:23.880> cover<00:00:24.150> and<00:00:24.510> the

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
that by making a fur cover and the

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:25.970 
that by making a fur cover and the
initial<00:00:24.990> thought<00:00:25.170> I<00:00:25.230> had<00:00:25.439> was<00:00:25.590> to<00:00:25.710> get<00:00:25.769> a<00:00:25.859> bit

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
initial thought I had was to get a bit

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.160 
initial thought I had was to get a bit
of<00:00:26.070> the<00:00:26.130> fur<00:00:26.310> material<00:00:26.460> and<00:00:26.970> fur<00:00:27.539> material<00:00:27.660> is

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
of the fur material and fur material is

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.169 
of the fur material and fur material is
available<00:00:28.590> from<00:00:28.740> most<00:00:28.949> em<00:00:29.250> fabric<00:00:29.820> supply

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
available from most em fabric supply

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.940 
available from most em fabric supply
shops<00:00:30.720> you<00:00:30.990> can<00:00:31.140> usually<00:00:31.859> buy<00:00:32.160> it<00:00:32.660> by<00:00:33.660> the<00:00:34.079> half

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
shops you can usually buy it by the half

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:35.420 
shops you can usually buy it by the half
meter

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
meter

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:36.889 
meter
I<00:00:35.610> think<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:35.910> half<00:00:36.059> meter<00:00:36.300> is<00:00:36.480> usually<00:00:36.809> the

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
I think the half meter is usually the

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.420 
I think the half meter is usually the
smallest<00:00:37.200> they<00:00:37.440> sell<00:00:37.649> it<00:00:37.770> and<00:00:37.860> they<00:00:37.980> may<00:00:38.100> sell

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
smallest they sell it and they may sell

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.610 
smallest they sell it and they may sell
a<00:00:38.670> smaller<00:00:39.000> quantity<00:00:39.750> maybe<00:00:40.140> a<00:00:40.230> quarter<00:00:40.530> a

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
a smaller quantity maybe a quarter a

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:41.840 
a smaller quantity maybe a quarter a
meter<00:00:40.860> or<00:00:40.950> something<00:00:41.160> like<00:00:41.219> that<00:00:41.280> or<00:00:41.520> a<00:00:41.550> course

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
meter or something like that or a course

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.369 
meter or something like that or a course
for<00:00:41.969> a<00:00:42.000> yard<00:00:42.210> if<00:00:42.510> that's<00:00:42.690> what<00:00:43.020> your<00:00:43.170> local

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
for a yard if that's what your local

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.380 
for a yard if that's what your local
measurement<00:00:43.860> system<00:00:44.129> is<00:00:44.250> but<00:00:44.940> that's<00:00:45.090> still

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
measurement system is but that's still

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.360 
measurement system is but that's still
enough<00:00:45.780> to<00:00:45.960> make<00:00:46.110> well<00:00:46.440> literally<00:00:46.860> hundreds

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
enough to make well literally hundreds

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.100 
enough to make well literally hundreds
of<00:00:47.460> make<00:00:47.610> fund<00:00:47.820> covers<00:00:48.149> some<00:00:48.690> people<00:00:48.960> worth

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
of make fund covers some people worth

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.680 
of make fund covers some people worth
singing<00:00:49.410> about<00:00:49.469> afterwards<00:00:50.039> or<00:00:50.730> even<00:00:51.090> you

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
singing about afterwards or even you

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.990 
singing about afterwards or even you
know<00:00:51.809> you<00:00:52.500> could<00:00:52.649> even<00:00:52.800> just<00:00:53.070> sneekly<00:00:53.489> ask<00:00:53.730> for

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
know you could even just sneekly ask for

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.220 
know you could even just sneekly ask for
a<00:00:54.030> sample<00:00:54.300> but<00:00:54.600> I<00:00:54.660> don't<00:00:54.870> know<00:00:54.960> if<00:00:55.079> I<00:00:55.140> approve

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
a sample but I don't know if I approve

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.630 
a sample but I don't know if I approve
of<00:00:55.559> that<00:00:55.590> I<00:00:55.890> think<00:00:56.010> you're<00:00:56.219> better<00:00:56.370> actually

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
of that I think you're better actually

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.020 
of that I think you're better actually
just<00:00:57.000> buying<00:00:57.270> a<00:00:57.480> section<00:00:58.109> of<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.260> material<00:00:59.030> so

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
just buying a section of the material so

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.119 
just buying a section of the material so
my<00:01:00.149> original<00:01:00.480> idea<00:01:00.539> was<00:01:00.780> to<00:01:01.559> place<00:01:01.739> this<00:01:01.920> over

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
my original idea was to place this over

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.700 
my original idea was to place this over
the<00:01:02.219> microphone<00:01:02.370> and<00:01:02.850> a<00:01:03.000> rubber<00:01:03.270> band<00:01:03.539> to<00:01:03.870> hold

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
the microphone and a rubber band to hold

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.070 
the microphone and a rubber band to hold
it<00:01:04.890> on<00:01:05.040> I<00:01:05.189> thought<00:01:05.369> that's<00:01:05.610> a<00:01:05.790> bit<00:01:05.909> tacky<00:01:06.150> I<00:01:06.540> can

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
it on I thought that's a bit tacky I can

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.960 
it on I thought that's a bit tacky I can
do<00:01:07.170> better<00:01:07.380> than<00:01:07.590> that

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:07.970 
do better than that

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.399 
do better than that
also<00:01:08.970> that<00:01:09.270> I'm<00:01:09.540> thinking<00:01:09.869> it'd<00:01:10.170> be<00:01:10.260> quite

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
also that I'm thinking it'd be quite

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.140 
also that I'm thinking it'd be quite
useful<00:01:10.619> protecting<00:01:11.549> both<00:01:11.670> sides<00:01:12.000> of<00:01:12.090> the

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
useful protecting both sides of the

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.710 
useful protecting both sides of the
microphone<00:01:12.510> so<00:01:13.170> I<00:01:13.439> got<00:01:13.799> a<00:01:14.330> section<00:01:15.330> of<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.540> fur

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
microphone so I got a section of the fur

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.530 
microphone so I got a section of the fur
fabric<00:01:15.960> and<00:01:16.380> it's<00:01:16.770> a<00:01:17.009> stretchy<00:01:17.610> set<00:01:18.060> of<00:01:18.119> woven

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
fabric and it's a stretchy set of woven

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.690 
fabric and it's a stretchy set of woven
material<00:01:19.110> with<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.439> verbs<00:01:20.009> of<00:01:20.220> interlocked

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
material with the verbs of interlocked

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.950 
material with the verbs of interlocked
into<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.270> weave<00:01:21.900> and<00:01:23.150> when<00:01:24.150> you<00:01:24.270> cut<00:01:24.479> it<00:01:24.689> it

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
into the weave and when you cut it it

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.740 
into the weave and when you cut it it
just<00:01:25.500> molds<00:01:25.770> everywhere<00:01:26.430> see<00:01:26.729> if<00:01:27.090> possible

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
just molds everywhere see if possible

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.649 
just molds everywhere see if possible
you<00:01:27.869> have<00:01:28.020> to<00:01:28.170> try<00:01:28.380> and<00:01:28.439> sort<00:01:28.710> of<00:01:29.060> part<00:01:30.060> it<00:01:30.299> to

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
you have to try and sort of part it to

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.569 
you have to try and sort of part it to
get<00:01:30.810> a<00:01:30.840> nice<00:01:31.049> clean<00:01:31.350> line<00:01:31.470> through<00:01:32.100> before<00:01:32.490> you

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
get a nice clean line through before you

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.179 
get a nice clean line through before you
cut<00:01:32.790> it<00:01:32.909> with<00:01:33.030> scissors<00:01:33.180> and<00:01:33.530> it<00:01:34.530> still<00:01:34.829> molds

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
cut it with scissors and it still molds

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.950 
cut it with scissors and it still molds
a<00:01:35.280> little<00:01:35.490> bit<00:01:35.610> but<00:01:35.790> you<00:01:35.880> know<00:01:35.909> you<00:01:36.030> can<00:01:36.240> remove

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
a little bit but you know you can remove

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.719 
a little bit but you know you can remove
the<00:01:37.140> fluff<00:01:37.380> just<00:01:37.409> by<00:01:37.770> pulling<00:01:38.100> at<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.430> edges

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
the fluff just by pulling at the edges

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.999 
the fluff just by pulling at the edges
and<00:01:38.759> it<00:01:39.030> gets<00:01:39.299> rid<00:01:39.509> of<00:01:39.540> any<00:01:39.659> loose<00:01:39.960> hairs<00:01:40.200> like

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
and it gets rid of any loose hairs like

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:41.620 
and it gets rid of any loose hairs like
that

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
that

that
OOP<00:01:43.729> so<00:01:44.729> I<00:01:45.149> cut<00:01:45.869> a<00:01:45.899> bit<00:01:46.140> to<00:01:46.520> fit<00:01:47.520> over<00:01:48.119> the

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
OOP so I cut a bit to fit over the

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.590 
OOP so I cut a bit to fit over the
microphone<00:01:48.470> when<00:01:49.470> folded<00:01:49.920> over<00:01:50.130> it<00:01:50.250> and<00:01:50.600> with

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
microphone when folded over it and with

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.100 
microphone when folded over it and with
a<00:01:51.630> generous<00:01:52.500> of<00:01:52.799> margin<00:01:53.579> in<00:01:53.640> each<00:01:53.729> side<00:01:54.079> then<00:01:55.079> I

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
a generous of margin in each side then I

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.039 
a generous of margin in each side then I
folded<00:01:55.829> it<00:01:55.979> over<00:01:56.070> and<00:01:56.250> I<00:01:57.090> ran<00:01:57.240> two<00:01:57.600> lines<00:01:57.810> of

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
folded it over and I ran two lines of

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.630 
folded it over and I ran two lines of
stitching<00:01:58.320> as<00:01:58.710> you<00:01:58.799> can<00:01:58.920> see<00:01:59.159> here<00:01:59.369> except<00:01:59.610> I

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
stitching as you can see here except I

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.310 
stitching as you can see here except I
did<00:02:00.030> it<00:02:00.149> in<00:02:00.240> yellow<00:02:00.509> just<00:02:00.780> because<00:02:01.049> that's<00:02:01.170> the

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
did it in yellow just because that's the

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.420 
did it in yellow just because that's the
color<00:02:01.469> of<00:02:01.680> thread<00:02:01.799> I<00:02:01.920> had<00:02:02.130> in<00:02:02.189> the<00:02:02.250> sewing

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:03.620 
color of thread I had in the sewing
machine<00:02:02.729> I<00:02:02.759> don't<00:02:03.030> think<00:02:03.180> it<00:02:03.270> really<00:02:03.420> matters

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
machine I don't think it really matters

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.590 
machine I don't think it really matters
because<00:02:04.079> it<00:02:04.350> doesn't<00:02:04.590> really<00:02:04.770> get<00:02:04.950> seen<00:02:05.600> then

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
because it doesn't really get seen then

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.839 
because it doesn't really get seen then
I<00:02:06.630> trimmed<00:02:07.020> after<00:02:07.469> had<00:02:07.590> run<00:02:07.890> the<00:02:08.009> two<00:02:08.190> lanes

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
I trimmed after had run the two lanes

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.880 
I trimmed after had run the two lanes
which<00:02:09.209> was<00:02:09.390> just<00:02:09.629> either<00:02:09.899> side<00:02:10.410> of<00:02:10.649> the<00:02:11.009> maple

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
which was just either side of the maple

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.790 
which was just either side of the maple
because<00:02:12.819> it<00:02:13.330> will<00:02:13.540> stretch<00:02:13.990> to<00:02:14.350> cover<00:02:14.620> the

going too close to the thread and now if

let's say slip it on the microphone and

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.050 
let's say slip it on the microphone and
see<00:02:40.540> what's<00:02:40.750> of<00:02:40.930> effect<00:02:41.260> it<00:02:41.410> has

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
see what's of effect it has

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380 
microphone cover looks like a bag of

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.770 
microphone cover looks like a bag of
papers<00:02:50.940> what<00:02:51.940> they<00:02:52.090> call<00:02:52.269> that<00:02:52.300> a<00:02:52.450> bearskin

I'm actually hoping yes I have yeah and
that's<00:03:07.390> it<00:03:07.720> no<00:03:07.930> I'm<00:03:08.230> speaking<00:03:08.680> directly<00:03:08.800> at<00:03:09.190> it

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
that's it no I'm speaking directly at it

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.259 
that's it no I'm speaking directly at it
and<00:03:09.700> I'm<00:03:10.060> going<00:03:10.269> to<00:03:10.300> deliberately<00:03:10.750> pop<00:03:11.500> and<00:03:12.269> I

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:13.269 
and I'm going to deliberately pop and I

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:15.240 
and I'm going to deliberately pop and I
really<00:03:13.930> am<00:03:14.019> blowing<00:03:14.350> it<00:03:14.590> so<00:03:14.769> you<00:03:14.860> will<00:03:15.010> get

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
really am blowing it so you will get

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.819 
really am blowing it so you will get
some<00:03:15.580> noise<00:03:15.790> but<00:03:16.060> it's<00:03:16.269> there<00:03:16.510> it's<00:03:17.440> probably

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:17.829 
some noise but it's there it's probably

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:20.310 
some noise but it's there it's probably
going<00:03:17.920> to<00:03:17.980> much<00:03:18.190> less<00:03:18.430> than<00:03:18.790> if<00:03:19.360> the<00:03:19.780> pop<00:03:20.079> was

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:20.320 
going to much less than if the pop was

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:21.960 
going to much less than if the pop was
actually<00:03:20.709> meeting<00:03:20.890> the<00:03:21.190> make<00:03:21.370> phone<00:03:21.610> directly

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
actually meeting the make phone directly

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.060 
actually meeting the make phone directly
the<00:03:22.150> first<00:03:22.450> should<00:03:22.600> be<00:03:22.690> breaking<00:03:22.900> that<00:03:23.230> up<00:03:23.260> now

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.070 
the first should be breaking that up now

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:24.930 
the first should be breaking that up now
it's<00:03:24.310> worth<00:03:24.459> noting

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
it's worth noting

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:27.690 
it's worth noting
I'll<00:03:25.360> just<00:03:25.600> blew<00:03:26.560> this<00:03:26.739> molting<00:03:27.190> fur<00:03:27.489> away

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
I'll just blew this molting fur away

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.990 
I'll just blew this molting fur away

features and imagine a small microphone

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:47.220 
features and imagine a small microphone
here<00:03:45.670> and<00:03:45.880> you're<00:03:46.420> getting<00:03:46.750> a<00:03:46.780> lot<00:03:46.900> of<00:03:46.930> wind

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 
here and you're getting a lot of wind

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:49.110 
here and you're getting a lot of wind
noise<00:03:47.320> outdoors<00:03:47.980> what<00:03:48.430> you<00:03:48.519> can<00:03:48.670> actually<00:03:48.820> do

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 
noise outdoors what you can actually do

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.440 
noise outdoors what you can actually do
is<00:03:49.239> either<00:03:49.480> cut<00:03:50.410> some<00:03:50.680> double-sided<00:03:51.370> tape<00:03:51.549> so

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:52.450 
is either cut some double-sided tape so

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:55.640 
is either cut some double-sided tape so
it's<00:03:52.840> a<00:03:53.190> piece<00:03:54.190> of<00:03:54.220> the<00:03:54.430> tape<00:03:54.640> but<00:03:54.670> with<00:03:54.940> a<00:03:54.970> hole

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
it's a piece of the tape but with a hole

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:57.569 
it's a piece of the tape but with a hole
directly<00:03:56.650> over<00:03:56.860> where<00:03:57.040> the<00:03:57.130> microphone<00:03:57.549> is

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:57.579 
directly over where the microphone is

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:00.420 
directly over where the microphone is
and<00:03:57.910> then<00:03:58.680> stick<00:03:59.680> a<00:03:59.709> bit<00:03:59.950> the<00:04:00.070> form<00:04:00.310> on

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
and then stick a bit the form on

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:02.960 
and then stick a bit the form on
permanently<00:04:00.970> or<00:04:01.320> some<00:04:02.320> people<00:04:02.560> are<00:04:02.650> actually

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
permanently or some people are actually

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.550 
permanently or some people are actually
getting<00:04:03.970> the<00:04:04.060> double<00:04:04.329> sided<00:04:04.540> velcro<00:04:04.690> tape<00:04:05.320> and

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560 
getting the double sided velcro tape and

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:06.600 
getting the double sided velcro tape and
they're<00:04:05.650> doing<00:04:05.829> the<00:04:05.890> same<00:04:06.070> thing<00:04:06.370> but<00:04:06.489> that's

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:06.610 
they're doing the same thing but that's

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:08.729 
they're doing the same thing but that's
one<00:04:06.940> side<00:04:07.180> the<00:04:07.360> velcro<00:04:07.570> and<00:04:07.900> they're<00:04:08.500> getting

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:08.739 
one side the velcro and they're getting

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:12.569 
one side the velcro and they're getting
a<00:04:08.769> matching<00:04:09.190> piece<00:04:09.340> of<00:04:09.519> velcro<00:04:09.730> on<00:04:10.180> the<00:04:11.579> fur

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:12.579 
a matching piece of velcro on the fur

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:14.610 
a matching piece of velcro on the fur
with<00:04:13.060> the<00:04:13.269> hole<00:04:13.720> in<00:04:13.750> the<00:04:13.959> matching<00:04:14.290> positions

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:14.620 
with the hole in the matching positions

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.140 
with the hole in the matching positions
so<00:04:14.829> that<00:04:14.980> when<00:04:15.250> they<00:04:15.400> desire<00:04:15.760> they<00:04:16.000> can

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.150 
so that when they desire they can

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:18.420 
so that when they desire they can
actually<00:04:16.479> add<00:04:16.630> the<00:04:16.870> fur<00:04:17.079> bit<00:04:17.289> over<00:04:17.650> the<00:04:17.829> front

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:18.430 
actually add the fur bit over the front

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:20.909 
actually add the fur bit over the front
of<00:04:18.579> the<00:04:18.760> camera<00:04:19.329> and<00:04:19.510> that<00:04:20.080> really<00:04:20.349> does<00:04:20.590> cut

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:20.919 
of the camera and that really does cut

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:22.800 
of the camera and that really does cut
down<00:04:20.950> the<00:04:21.310> noise<00:04:21.430> if<00:04:21.970> you<00:04:22.150> if<00:04:22.360> you<00:04:22.510> look<00:04:22.630> in<00:04:22.750> the

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:22.810 
down the noise if you if you look in the

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:25.060 
down the noise if you if you look in the
internet<00:04:23.080> you'll<00:04:23.229> see<00:04:23.440> people<00:04:24.099> are

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.070 
internet you'll see people are

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:27.190 
internet you'll see people are
demonstrating<00:04:26.060> with<00:04:26.210> and<00:04:26.390> without<00:04:26.540> these

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:27.200 
demonstrating with and without these

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.680 
demonstrating with and without these
four<00:04:27.710> covers<00:04:27.950> and<00:04:28.340> it<00:04:28.880> makes<00:04:29.090> a<00:04:29.210> staggering

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:29.690 
four covers and it makes a staggering

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:31.570 
four covers and it makes a staggering
difference<00:04:30.020> so<00:04:30.590> hopefully<00:04:31.130> this<00:04:31.280> one<00:04:31.430> will

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:31.580 
difference so hopefully this one will

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:33.550 
difference so hopefully this one will
add<00:04:31.820> it<00:04:32.480> certainly<00:04:32.810> makes<00:04:32.990> my<00:04:33.170> microphone

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:33.560 
add it certainly makes my microphone

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.950 
add it certainly makes my microphone
look<00:04:33.740> a<00:04:33.800> lot<00:04:33.980> nicer<00:04:34.190> I<00:04:34.430> have<00:04:34.640> to<00:04:34.790> say<00:04:34.970> very<00:04:35.150> free

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:35.960 
look a lot nicer I have to say very free

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:44.950 
look a lot nicer I have to say very free
laughs<00:04:36.110> a<00:04:40.780> it's<00:04:41.780> so<00:04:42.290> fluffy
