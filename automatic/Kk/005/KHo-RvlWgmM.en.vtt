00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.419 
gone I I can't even believe how fun this
is<00:01:21.330> so<00:01:22.330> it<00:01:22.450> comes<00:01:22.660> with<00:01:22.810> this<00:01:23.080> large<00:01:23.440> this

00:01:24.419 --> 00:01:24.429 
is so it comes with this large this

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:26.609 
is so it comes with this large this
large<00:01:24.759> teardrop<00:01:25.119> one<00:01:25.509> too<00:01:25.750> and<00:01:26.259> I<00:01:26.350> haven't

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:26.619 
large teardrop one too and I haven't

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:30.660 
large teardrop one too and I haven't
tried<00:01:26.890> that<00:01:26.920> yet<00:01:27.220> so<00:01:28.950> we'll<00:01:29.950> put<00:01:30.160> that<00:01:30.190> one<00:01:30.490> on

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670 
tried that yet so we'll put that one on

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:32.790 
tried that yet so we'll put that one on
and<00:01:31.539> what<00:01:31.720> you<00:01:31.840> do<00:01:31.929> is<00:01:32.050> you<00:01:32.140> first<00:01:32.349> you<00:01:32.560> wash

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:32.800 
and what you do is you first you wash

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.770 
and what you do is you first you wash
your<00:01:33.009> face<00:01:33.069> and<00:01:33.580> then<00:01:33.729> you<00:01:33.819> pat<00:01:34.030> it<00:01:34.209> dry<00:01:34.390> and

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:34.780 
your face and then you pat it dry and

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.279 
your face and then you pat it dry and
then<00:01:35.550> I<00:01:36.550> like<00:01:37.179> because<00:01:37.569> the<00:01:37.840> theory<00:01:38.080> behind

00:01:38.279 --> 00:01:38.289 
then I like because the theory behind

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:40.830 
then I like because the theory behind
like<00:01:38.679> sponges<00:01:39.490> and<00:01:39.700> things<00:01:39.910> isn't<00:01:40.149> the<00:01:40.599> dryer

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
like sponges and things isn't the dryer

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.350 
like sponges and things isn't the dryer
they<00:01:41.020> are<00:01:41.170> the<00:01:41.319> more<00:01:41.500> they<00:01:41.619> soak<00:01:41.920> up<00:01:42.360> products

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360 
they are the more they soak up products

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.839 
they are the more they soak up products
so<00:01:43.450> if<00:01:43.539> you<00:01:43.660> lightly<00:01:44.110> dampen<00:01:44.920> the<00:01:45.160> foam<00:01:45.580> part

00:01:45.839 --> 00:01:45.849 
so if you lightly dampen the foam part

00:01:45.849 --> 00:01:47.820 
so if you lightly dampen the foam part
just<00:01:46.060> deliver<00:01:46.300> it<00:01:46.479> with<00:01:46.630> some<00:01:46.780> warm<00:01:46.959> water<00:01:47.050> is

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:47.830 
just deliver it with some warm water is

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:50.130 
just deliver it with some warm water is
what<00:01:48.009> I'm<00:01:48.130> doing<00:01:48.399> right<00:01:48.520> now<00:01:48.580> and<00:01:49.050> then<00:01:50.050> when

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 
what I'm doing right now and then when

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:54.120 
what I'm doing right now and then when
you<00:01:50.229> take<00:01:50.440> the<00:01:51.810> facial<00:01:52.810> rejuvenation<00:01:53.130> formula

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.130 
you take the facial rejuvenation formula

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:56.040 
you take the facial rejuvenation formula
which<00:01:54.280> has<00:01:54.489> these<00:01:54.670> little<00:01:54.789> crystals<00:01:55.720> inside

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:56.050 
which has these little crystals inside

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:57.809 
which has these little crystals inside
and<00:01:56.319> you<00:01:56.410> can<00:01:56.590> feel<00:01:56.890> it<00:01:57.069> like<00:01:57.099> buffing<00:01:57.700> and

00:01:57.809 --> 00:01:57.819 
and you can feel it like buffing and
