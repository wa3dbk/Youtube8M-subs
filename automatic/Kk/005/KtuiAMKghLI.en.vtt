officials<00:01:13.030> pretty<00:01:13.270> much<00:01:13.509> dragged<00:01:14.020> us<00:01:14.200> to

safety<00:01:14.619> I<00:01:15.070> just<00:01:15.970> had<00:01:16.119> a<00:01:16.149> chat<00:01:16.390> with<00:01:16.420> one<00:01:16.720> of<00:01:16.780> the

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960 
safety I just had a chat with one of the

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.420 
safety I just had a chat with one of the
officials<00:01:17.380> and<00:01:17.530> the<00:01:17.590> reason<00:01:17.950> the<00:01:18.039> cars<00:01:18.250> are

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:18.430 
officials and the reason the cars are

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:20.190 
officials and the reason the cars are
being<00:01:18.520> towed<00:01:18.759> away<00:01:18.910> is<00:01:19.180> because<00:01:19.600> most<00:01:19.960> of<00:01:20.080> the

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.200 
being towed away is because most of the

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.540 
being towed away is because most of the
calls<00:01:20.380> don't<00:01:20.649> have<00:01:20.890> a<00:01:20.920> four-wheel<00:01:21.340> drive

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:21.550

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:29.350 
can make it up there because the store

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
the road and my new it's an optical

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.259 
the road and my new it's an optical
illusion<00:02:09.989> it's<00:02:10.500> a<00:02:10.890> sort<00:02:11.099> of<00:02:11.160> a<00:02:11.280> mirage<00:02:11.640> and<00:02:11.880> the

bhavi actually pussyfooting through the
ice<00:04:19.329> is<00:04:19.570> what<00:04:19.690> everybody<00:04:20.229> else<00:04:20.320> is<00:04:20.500> going<00:04:20.680> to

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:20.739 
ice is what everybody else is going to

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:23.159 
ice is what everybody else is going to
lose<00:04:20.859> time<00:04:21.040> and<00:04:21.220> we<00:04:22.060> did<00:04:22.240> that<00:04:22.389> as<00:04:22.510> a<00:04:22.540> third<00:04:22.810> we

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:23.169 
lose time and we did that as a third we

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:24.750 
lose time and we did that as a third we
were<00:04:23.260> the<00:04:23.350> third<00:04:23.440> fastest<00:04:23.860> in<00:04:24.010> that<00:04:24.160> yeah
