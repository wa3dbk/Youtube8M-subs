00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
the way in all it's doing it's not doing

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:53.650 
the way in all it's doing it's not doing
any<00:02:52.520> kind<00:02:52.670> of<00:02:52.700> logic<00:02:52.880> it's<00:02:53.270> actually<00:02:53.540> just

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
any kind of logic it's actually just

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.810 
any kind of logic it's actually just
parsing<00:02:54.230> that<00:02:54.350> text<00:02:54.830> from<00:02:55.220> Google<00:02:55.670> Maps

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:55.820 
parsing that text from Google Maps

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:58.000 
parsing that text from Google Maps
that's<00:02:56.150> on<00:02:56.360> your<00:02:56.540> phone<00:02:56.750> and<00:02:56.989> just<00:02:57.050> displaying

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
that's on your phone and just displaying

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.400 
that's on your phone and just displaying
it<00:02:58.130> on<00:02:58.190> the<00:02:58.250> watch<00:02:58.489> it's<00:02:59.420> really<00:02:59.720> slick<00:03:00.080> and

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
it on the watch it's really slick and

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:01.630 
it on the watch it's really slick and
because<00:03:00.739> it's<00:03:00.950> not<00:03:01.070> really<00:03:01.280> doing<00:03:01.400> any

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 
because it's not really doing any

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.280 
because it's not really doing any
thinking<00:03:02.150> it's<00:03:02.300> just<00:03:02.450> handing<00:03:02.810> directions

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
thinking it's just handing directions

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:05.560 
thinking it's just handing directions
over<00:03:03.620> from<00:03:04.190> one<00:03:04.400> device<00:03:04.670> to<00:03:04.730> another<00:03:04.940> it's

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:05.570 
over from one device to another it's

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:07.540 
over from one device to another it's
quite<00:03:05.810> fast<00:03:06.110> there's<00:03:06.380> no<00:03:06.470> latency<00:03:06.860> doesn't

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:07.550 
quite fast there's no latency doesn't

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:09.670 
quite fast there's no latency doesn't
you<00:03:07.790> know<00:03:07.910> slow<00:03:08.269> the<00:03:08.690> watch<00:03:08.900> down<00:03:09.230> doesn't

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
you know slow the watch down doesn't

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.140 
you know slow the watch down doesn't
pull<00:03:09.920> anything<00:03:10.160> from<00:03:10.489> the<00:03:10.640> phone<00:03:10.850> at<00:03:11.000> that

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
shot I know there's some other solutions
