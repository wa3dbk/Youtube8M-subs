00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
but you can use red lipstick as a

red lipstick right here this is from
Topshop<00:00:23.220> I<00:00:23.609> thought<00:00:23.880> I<00:00:23.910> would<00:00:24.090> quickly<00:00:24.449> try

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
Topshop I thought I would quickly try

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.480 
Topshop I thought I would quickly try
this<00:00:24.779> technique<00:00:25.380> and<00:00:25.619> if<00:00:25.710> it<00:00:25.830> actually<00:00:25.949> works

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
this technique and if it actually works

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:27.859 
this technique and if it actually works
because<00:00:26.939> some<00:00:27.180> of<00:00:27.269> the<00:00:27.330> pictures<00:00:27.539> that<00:00:27.689> I've

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
because some of the pictures that I've

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.720 
because some of the pictures that I've
seen<00:00:28.109> they<00:00:28.349> look<00:00:28.500> really<00:00:28.710> promising<00:00:29.160> and<00:00:29.460> I'm

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
seen they look really promising and I'm

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.250 
seen they look really promising and I'm
gonna<00:00:29.820> see<00:00:29.970> if<00:00:30.119> it<00:00:30.210> actually<00:00:30.240> works<00:00:30.510> as<00:00:30.929> a

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
gonna see if it actually works as a

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.930 
gonna see if it actually works as a
corrector<00:00:31.740> as<00:00:31.920> you<00:00:32.099> can<00:00:32.219> see<00:00:32.399> my<00:00:32.579> under<00:00:32.820> eyes

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
corrector as you can see my under eyes

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.549 
corrector as you can see my under eyes
are<00:00:33.180> really<00:00:33.540> bad<00:00:33.750> and<00:00:34.050> this<00:00:34.230> will<00:00:34.350> be<00:00:34.440> like

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
are really bad and this will be like

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.470 
are really bad and this will be like
ultimate<00:00:35.040> test<00:00:35.309> to<00:00:35.489> see<00:00:35.670> if<00:00:35.700> red<00:00:36.090> lipstick

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
ultimate test to see if red lipstick

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.690 
ultimate test to see if red lipstick
those<00:00:36.840> actually<00:00:37.380> correct<00:00:37.710> under<00:00:38.070> eyes<00:00:38.219> and<00:00:38.550> in

case<00:00:38.850> you're<00:00:39.059> wondering<00:00:39.239> this<00:00:39.600> is<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:39.840> shade

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
case you're wondering this is the shade

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.740 
case you're wondering this is the shade
screen<00:00:40.649> siren<00:00:41.190> from<00:00:41.370> Topshop<00:00:41.910> I<00:00:42.030> think<00:00:42.570> each

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
screen siren from Topshop I think each

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.959 
screen siren from Topshop I think each
of<00:00:42.930> these<00:00:43.050> lipsticks<00:00:43.590> around<00:00:44.010> 8<00:00:44.219> pounds<00:00:44.700> but

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
of these lipsticks around 8 pounds but

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.520 
of these lipsticks around 8 pounds but
they<00:00:45.149> are<00:00:45.329> really<00:00:45.539> good<00:00:45.629> quality<00:00:45.750> a<00:00:46.170> lot<00:00:46.469> of

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
they are really good quality a lot of

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.319 
they are really good quality a lot of
these<00:00:46.590> lipsticks<00:00:47.070> so<00:00:47.640> I'm<00:00:47.820> gonna<00:00:47.969> take<00:00:48.180> this

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
these lipsticks so I'm gonna take this

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.569 
these lipsticks so I'm gonna take this
small<00:00:48.690> kind<00:00:48.960> of<00:00:49.050> flat<00:00:49.379> brush<00:00:49.680> and<00:00:49.950> basically

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
small kind of flat brush and basically

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.369 
small kind of flat brush and basically
going<00:00:50.820> to<00:00:51.000> dab<00:00:51.239> this<00:00:51.629> brush<00:00:52.020> into<00:00:52.320> the

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
going to dab this brush into the

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.350 
going to dab this brush into the
lipstick<00:00:52.860> and<00:00:52.980> then<00:00:53.250> I<00:00:53.399> can<00:00:53.550> apply<00:00:53.789> that<00:00:54.180> way

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
lipstick and then I can apply that way

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.029 
lipstick and then I can apply that way
rather<00:00:54.660> than<00:00:54.809> actually<00:00:55.170> smearing<00:00:55.800> it<00:00:55.920> on

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
rather than actually smearing it on

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.709 
rather than actually smearing it on
because<00:00:56.640> I<00:00:56.820> think<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.149> trick<00:00:57.390> to<00:00:57.539> this<00:00:57.660> is

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
because I think the trick to this is

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.349 
because I think the trick to this is
using<00:00:58.379> kind<00:00:58.800> of<00:00:58.890> a<00:00:58.980> small<00:00:59.340> amount<00:00:59.609> I'm<00:01:00.210> not

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
using kind of a small amount I'm not

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.090 
using kind of a small amount I'm not
going<00:01:00.570> on<00:01:00.809> my<00:01:00.930> scarring<00:01:01.289> or<00:01:01.590> anything<00:01:01.739> just

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
going on my scarring or anything just

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.650 
going on my scarring or anything just
because<00:01:02.250> I<00:01:02.640> don't<00:01:02.879> really<00:01:02.969> feel<00:01:03.300> comfortable

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
because I don't really feel comfortable

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.550 
because I don't really feel comfortable
using<00:01:04.470> a<00:01:04.949> lipstick<00:01:05.580> on<00:01:06.060> my<00:01:06.540> scarring<00:01:06.960> but<00:01:07.470> if

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
using a lipstick on my scarring but if

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.830 
using a lipstick on my scarring but if
this<00:01:07.740> works<00:01:08.010> well<00:01:08.340> and<00:01:08.549> my<00:01:08.760> eyes<00:01:09.000> are<00:01:09.030> maybe<00:01:09.479> it

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
this works well and my eyes are maybe it

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.390 
this works well and my eyes are maybe it
will<00:01:09.930> work<00:01:09.990> really<00:01:10.320> well<00:01:10.470> and<00:01:10.740> laughing<00:01:11.100> scary

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
will work really well and laughing scary

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.990 
will work really well and laughing scary

otherwise<00:02:47.040> I<00:02:47.100> kind<00:02:47.370> of<00:02:47.430> felt<00:02:47.610> like<00:02:47.640> I<00:02:47.880> was

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
otherwise I kind of felt like I was

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.520 
otherwise I kind of felt like I was
sleeping<00:02:48.420> the<00:02:48.540> lipstick<00:02:48.930> underneath<00:02:49.050> and<00:02:49.500> I

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
sleeping the lipstick underneath and I

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:50.840 
sleeping the lipstick underneath and I
didn't<00:02:49.710> want<00:02:49.830> it<00:02:49.890> to<00:02:49.950> kind<00:02:50.220> of<00:02:50.310> go<00:02:50.460> like<00:02:50.490> that

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
didn't want it to kind of go like that

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.490 
didn't want it to kind of go like that
and<00:02:51.210> so<00:02:51.450> far<00:02:51.750> so<00:02:51.780> good

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
and so far so good

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.610 
and so far so good
I<00:02:52.650> quite<00:02:53.510> I'm<00:02:54.510> a<00:02:54.630> little<00:02:54.870> bit<00:02:54.959> too<00:02:55.200> minded

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
I quite I'm a little bit too minded

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.170 
I quite I'm a little bit too minded
about<00:02:55.800> this<00:02:56.010> I<00:02:56.190> think<00:02:56.430> the<00:02:56.580> coverage<00:02:56.910> is

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
about this I think the coverage is

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.090 
about this I think the coverage is
pretty<00:02:57.570> cool<00:02:57.810> I<00:02:58.110> won't<00:02:58.410> like<00:02:58.590> how<00:02:58.800> it<00:02:58.920> has

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
pretty cool I won't like how it has

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.400 
pretty cool I won't like how it has
covered<00:02:59.459> up<00:02:59.580> at<00:03:00.180> the<00:03:00.300> same<00:03:00.510> time<00:03:00.780> is<00:03:00.990> kind<00:03:01.260> of

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
covered up at the same time is kind of

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:02.930 
covered up at the same time is kind of
made<00:03:01.650> it<00:03:01.680> a<00:03:01.860> little<00:03:02.040> bit<00:03:02.160> more<00:03:02.340> kind<00:03:02.520> of<00:03:02.640> cool

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
made it a little bit more kind of cool

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.940 
made it a little bit more kind of cool
tone<00:03:03.360> and<00:03:03.780> I<00:03:04.020> think<00:03:04.230> it's<00:03:04.350> kind<00:03:04.560> of<00:03:04.590> giving<00:03:04.830> my

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
tone and I think it's kind of giving my

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.590 
tone and I think it's kind of giving my
foundation<00:03:05.459> a<00:03:05.520> bit<00:03:05.670> of<00:03:05.730> a<00:03:05.790> pink<00:03:06.030> undertone<00:03:06.209> to

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
foundation a bit of a pink undertone to

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.630 
foundation a bit of a pink undertone to
and<00:03:07.170> how<00:03:07.860> it<00:03:07.980> normally<00:03:08.100> is<00:03:08.370> which<00:03:08.520> is

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
and how it normally is which is

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.430 
and how it normally is which is
obviously<00:03:08.940> a<00:03:09.030> yellow<00:03:09.390> undertone<00:03:09.690> and<00:03:10.260> my

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
obviously a yellow undertone and my

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.229 
obviously a yellow undertone and my
under<00:03:10.650> eyes<00:03:10.770> are<00:03:10.980> creasing<00:03:11.520> as<00:03:11.700> well<00:03:11.880> but<00:03:12.090> why

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
under eyes are creasing as well but why

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:14.330 
under eyes are creasing as well but why
I<00:03:12.270> think<00:03:12.570> I<00:03:12.660> will<00:03:12.870> do<00:03:13.050> but<00:03:13.440> what<00:03:13.500> I<00:03:13.680> am<00:03:13.950> going<00:03:14.220> to

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
I think I will do but what I am going to

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.280 
I think I will do but what I am going to
do<00:03:14.459> is<00:03:14.700> apply<00:03:14.850> some<00:03:15.000> concealer<00:03:15.360> because<00:03:16.050> I

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
do is apply some concealer because I

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.830 
do is apply some concealer because I
feel<00:03:16.800> that<00:03:16.830> I<00:03:17.040> need<00:03:17.160> to<00:03:17.459> it<00:03:18.030> kind<00:03:18.239> of<00:03:18.360> has<00:03:18.570> a<00:03:18.600> bit

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
feel that I need to it kind of has a bit

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.330 
feel that I need to it kind of has a bit
of<00:03:18.900> a<00:03:18.959> pink<00:03:19.260> undertone<00:03:19.470> and<00:03:19.830> I<00:03:20.100> don't<00:03:20.160> really

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
like that and plus I think I do need a

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.530 
like that and plus I think I do need a
bit<00:03:22.709> more<00:03:22.739> coverage<00:03:23.430> so<00:03:23.910> I'm<00:03:23.970> just<00:03:24.150> going<00:03:24.330> in

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
bit more coverage so I'm just going in
