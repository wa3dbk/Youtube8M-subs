prepared<00:00:02.129> for<00:00:02.250> dt<00:00:02.730> or<00:00:03.000> rever<00:00:03.419> drop<00:00:03.629> here<00:00:06.259> and<00:00:07.259> I

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
prepared for dt or rever drop here and I

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:09.080 
prepared for dt or rever drop here and I
don't<00:00:07.379> think<00:00:07.830> his<00:00:07.980> armies<00:00:08.340> are<00:00:08.460> spinning<00:00:08.849> just

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
don't think his armies are spinning just

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.060 
don't think his armies are spinning just
yet<00:00:09.269> meanwhile<00:00:10.019> starport<00:00:10.440> going<00:00:10.679> up<00:00:10.769> actually

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
yet meanwhile starport going up actually

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:12.499 
yet meanwhile starport going up actually
I<00:00:11.130> think<00:00:11.309> they<00:00:11.400> probably<00:00:11.670> are<00:00:12.000> abused<00:00:12.330> that

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
I think they probably are abused that

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.629 
I think they probably are abused that
that<00:00:13.469> would<00:00:13.620> explain<00:00:13.889> why<00:00:13.980> dost<00:00:14.250> our<00:00:14.400> ports

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
that would explain why dost our ports

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:15.829 
that would explain why dost our ports
going<00:00:14.849> up<00:00:14.940> so<00:00:15.089> he<00:00:15.150> can<00:00:15.210> get<00:00:15.389> the<00:00:15.540> science

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
going up so he can get the science

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.420 
going up so he can get the science
facility<00:00:16.230> and<00:00:16.350> get<00:00:16.470> the<00:00:16.619> plus<00:00:16.890> to<00:00:17.070> attack

for early drop ships out early shuttles
rather<00:01:13.049> and<00:01:13.340> are<00:01:14.340> using<00:01:14.610> them<00:01:14.820> to<00:01:14.850> create<00:01:15.119> a

fight<00:01:15.360> that<00:01:15.509> I<00:01:15.570> just<00:01:15.689> often<00:01:16.140> wonder<00:01:16.350> why<00:01:16.470> they

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
fight that I just often wonder why they

fight that I just often wonder why they
don't<00:01:16.710> go<00:01:16.890> for<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:17.100> school<00:01:17.280> iets<00:01:17.490> anyway<00:01:18.119> it

don't go for the school iets anyway it

don't go for the school iets anyway it
looks<00:01:18.240> like<00:01:18.450> dazing<00:01:19.080> has<00:01:19.229> gotten<00:01:19.530> a<00:01:19.590> store

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
looks like dazing has gotten a store

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.580 
looks like dazing has gotten a store
expansion<00:01:20.100> up<00:01:20.430> a<00:01:20.580> third<00:01:21.090> base<00:01:21.360> up<00:01:21.570> and<00:01:21.750> now<00:01:22.380> his

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
expansion up a third base up and now his

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.859 
expansion up a third base up and now his
back<00:01:22.799> rowing<00:01:23.009> fairly<00:01:23.369> heavily<00:01:23.580> here<00:01:24.360> he<00:01:24.509> still

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
back rowing fairly heavily here he still

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.170 
back rowing fairly heavily here he still
has<00:01:25.020> not<00:01:25.140> gone<00:01:25.380> his<00:01:25.650> second<00:01:26.250> expansion<00:01:26.490> up<00:01:26.820> but

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
has not gone his second expansion up but

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.580 
has not gone his second expansion up but
he<00:01:27.270> has<00:01:27.420> gotten<00:01:27.689> that<00:01:27.750> science<00:01:28.049> facility<00:01:28.470> out

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
he has gotten that science facility out

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.920 
he has gotten that science facility out
we'll<00:01:29.369> see<00:01:29.579> if<00:01:29.610> dazing<00:01:30.210> decides<00:01:30.479> to<00:01:30.570> go<00:01:30.659> for<00:01:30.689> a

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
we'll see if dazing decides to go for a

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.499 
we'll see if dazing decides to go for a
relatively<00:01:31.710> fast<00:01:31.979> arbiter<00:01:32.430> here<00:01:32.670> that<00:01:33.360> will

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
relatively fast arbiter here that will

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.410 
relatively fast arbiter here that will
be<00:01:33.630> his<00:01:33.750> natural<00:01:34.530> progression<00:01:34.770> in<00:01:35.520> tech<00:01:35.820> since

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
be his natural progression in tech since

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.090 
be his natural progression in tech since
he<00:01:36.600> probably<00:01:36.869> has<00:01:37.079> a<00:01:37.110> temple<00:01:37.470> archives<00:01:37.770> up<00:01:38.009> by

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
he probably has a temple archives up by

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.840 
he probably has a temple archives up by
now<00:01:39.860> of<00:01:40.860> course<00:01:41.100> I<00:01:41.159> wouldn't<00:01:41.340> call<00:01:41.520> it<00:01:41.610> fast

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
now of course I wouldn't call it fast

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.700 
now of course I wouldn't call it fast
arbiters<00:01:42.299> by<00:01:42.450> any<00:01:42.600> means<00:01:42.750> because<00:01:42.930> uh<00:01:43.140> he<00:01:43.470> has

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
arbiters by any means because uh he has

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.260 
arbiters by any means because uh he has
taken<00:01:44.009> a<00:01:44.220> time<00:01:44.430> to<00:01:44.579> get<00:01:44.729> that<00:01:44.880> second

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
taken a time to get that second

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.569 
taken a time to get that second
expansion<00:01:45.840> up<00:01:46.170> and<00:01:46.380> days<00:01:47.130> ain't<00:01:47.280> doing<00:01:47.520> a

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
expansion up and days ain't doing a

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.310 
expansion up and days ain't doing a
little<00:01:47.729> push<00:01:47.970> now<00:01:48.180> perhaps<00:01:48.960> he's<00:01:49.140> going<00:01:49.259> to

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
little push now perhaps he's going to

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.830 
little push now perhaps he's going to
try<00:01:49.500> to<00:01:49.530> get<00:01:49.710> on<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:50.070> ledge<00:01:50.460> overlooking<00:01:50.909> the

try to get on the ledge overlooking the

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.469 
try to get on the ledge overlooking the
second<00:01:52.229> expansion<00:01:52.470> for<00:01:52.829> jiri<00:01:53.130> and<00:01:53.399> it<00:01:54.390> looks

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
second expansion for jiri and it looks

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:55.789 
second expansion for jiri and it looks
like<00:01:54.570> he<00:01:54.780> is<00:01:54.810> going<00:01:54.990> to<00:01:55.110> go<00:01:55.200> doing<00:01:55.470> that<00:01:55.680> right

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
like he is going to go doing that right

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.260 
like he is going to go doing that right
now<00:01:55.860> he's<00:01:56.159> me<00:01:56.280> going<00:01:56.579> on<00:01:56.759> sneaking<00:01:57.060> in<00:01:57.240> from

all that poor scarab not doing anything

attack i'm not sure if it's going to
work<00:02:48.040> though<00:02:48.310> because<00:02:48.490> there<00:02:48.760> are<00:02:48.880> about<00:02:49.120> five

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
work though because there are about five

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.110 
work though because there are about five
tanks<00:02:49.810> but<00:02:50.620> i<00:02:50.830> think<00:02:51.190> dazing<00:02:51.490> may<00:02:51.640> be<00:02:51.700> able<00:02:51.850> to

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
tanks but i think dazing may be able to

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.460 
tanks but i think dazing may be able to
hit<00:02:52.420> them<00:02:52.570> from<00:02:52.660> the<00:02:52.840> cliff<00:02:53.080> using<00:02:53.260> those

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
hit them from the cliff using those

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.770 
hit them from the cliff using those
dragoons<00:02:53.770> but<00:02:54.520> smartly<00:02:54.880> now<00:02:54.910> he's<00:02:55.480> pulling

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
dragoons but smartly now he's pulling

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.780 
dragoons but smartly now he's pulling
back<00:02:55.930> I<00:02:56.110> think<00:02:56.290> all<00:02:56.470> you<00:02:56.590> need<00:02:56.740> to<00:02:56.860> do<00:02:57.040> is<00:02:57.310> deny

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
back I think all you need to do is deny

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.810 
back I think all you need to do is deny
the<00:02:58.000> second<00:02:58.660> expansion<00:02:58.900> from<00:02:59.580> here<00:03:00.580> e<00:03:00.610> in

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:00.820 
the second expansion from here e in

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:02.460 
the second expansion from here e in
order<00:03:01.030> to<00:03:01.120> make<00:03:01.240> this<00:03:01.360> work<00:03:01.570> out<00:03:01.720> and<00:03:01.990> actually

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
order to make this work out and actually

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.170 
order to make this work out and actually
it<00:03:02.860> seems<00:03:03.040> that<00:03:03.280> the<00:03:03.430> command<00:03:03.760> center<00:03:03.880> has

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
it seems that the command center has

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.750 
it seems that the command center has
been<00:03:04.330> killed<00:03:04.930> so<00:03:05.530> I<00:03:05.560> actually<00:03:05.860> did<00:03:06.160> it<00:03:06.340> was<00:03:06.670> it

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
been killed so I actually did it was it

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.700 
been killed so I actually did it was it

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
here we would be making another command

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.720 
here we would be making another command
center<00:03:10.720> otherwise<00:03:11.020> i<00:03:11.320> guess<00:03:12.190> it<00:03:12.340> was<00:03:12.370> killed

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730

attack<00:03:18.250> force<00:03:18.520> he's<00:03:18.670> been<00:03:18.850> going<00:03:19.060> for<00:03:19.210> a

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:19.240 
attack force he's been going for a

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:21.180 
attack force he's been going for a
straight<00:03:19.600> break<00:03:19.930> in<00:03:20.110> the<00:03:20.230> front<00:03:20.380> without

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 
straight break in the front without

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:22.800 
straight break in the front without
using<00:03:21.430> any<00:03:21.640> templar<00:03:22.210> i'm<00:03:22.330> not<00:03:22.480> sure<00:03:22.630> if<00:03:22.720> that's

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
using any templar i'm not sure if that's

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:24.810 
using any templar i'm not sure if that's
going<00:03:22.960> to<00:03:23.020> work<00:03:23.110> on<00:03:23.470> tues<00:03:24.220> advantage<00:03:24.610> though<00:03:24.760> i

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:24.820 
going to work on tues advantage though i

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:25.980 
going to work on tues advantage though i
think<00:03:24.880> he<00:03:25.120> should<00:03:25.390> be<00:03:25.510> getting<00:03:25.690> some<00:03:25.870> high

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:25.990 
think he should be getting some high

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:28.230 
think he should be getting some high
templar<00:03:26.440> because<00:03:26.710> the<00:03:27.430> choke<00:03:27.760> point<00:03:27.790> and<00:03:28.120> claw

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:28.240 
templar because the choke point and claw

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:30.180 
templar because the choke point and claw
seem<00:03:28.510> is<00:03:28.600> just<00:03:28.810> so<00:03:28.960> narrow<00:03:29.260> that<00:03:29.380> you<00:03:29.950> really

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
seem is just so narrow that you really

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:31.980 
seem is just so narrow that you really
can't<00:03:30.430> break<00:03:30.640> it<00:03:30.790> with<00:03:30.880> just<00:03:31.090> speed<00:03:31.570> lots<00:03:31.780> and

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:31.990 
can't break it with just speed lots and

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:33.930 
can't break it with just speed lots and
dragoons<00:03:32.170> i<00:03:32.380> feel<00:03:32.560> and<00:03:33.250> actually<00:03:33.610> a<00:03:33.640> pretty

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 
dragoons i feel and actually a pretty

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:35.320 
late Templar archives going up for

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:37.470 
late Templar archives going up for
dazing<00:03:35.620> so<00:03:35.800> no<00:03:35.980> Templar<00:03:36.370> for<00:03:36.520> him<00:03:36.670> for<00:03:37.240> a<00:03:37.270> while

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
dazing so no Templar for him for a while

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:43.110 
dazing so no Templar for him for a while
now<00:03:41.190> meanwhile<00:03:42.190> dazing<00:03:42.550> might<00:03:42.730> decide<00:03:42.970> to<00:03:43.030> go

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
now meanwhile dazing might decide to go

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.280 
now meanwhile dazing might decide to go
for<00:03:43.180> another<00:03:43.360> expansion<00:03:43.660> actually<00:03:44.080> he<00:03:44.200> has

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
for another expansion actually he has

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.230 
for another expansion actually he has
decided<00:03:44.590> off<00:03:44.860> go<00:03:45.310> for<00:03:45.490> another<00:03:45.550> expansion<00:03:45.910> at

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:46.240 
decided off go for another expansion at

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:47.730 
decided off go for another expansion at
the<00:03:46.390> upper<00:03:46.600> right<00:03:46.780> and<00:03:46.930> now<00:03:47.260> the<00:03:47.320> Stargate

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:47.740 
the upper right and now the Stargate

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:49.380 
the upper right and now the Stargate
going<00:03:48.010> up<00:03:48.130> immediately<00:03:48.490> after<00:03:49.000> temple

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:49.390 
going up immediately after temple

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:51.510 
going up immediately after temple
archives<00:03:49.630> so<00:03:49.840> we<00:03:49.870> didn't<00:03:50.140> see<00:03:50.230> some<00:03:50.520> arbiters

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:51.520 
archives so we didn't see some arbiters

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:54.330 
archives so we didn't see some arbiters
coming<00:03:51.820> out<00:03:52.590> observer<00:03:53.590> getting<00:03:53.920> killed<00:03:54.160> there

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
coming out observer getting killed there

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:57.420 
coming out observer getting killed there
and<00:03:55.140> I'd<00:03:56.140> say<00:03:56.350> dazing<00:03:56.740> definitely<00:03:57.190> has<00:03:57.310> an

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
and I'd say dazing definitely has an

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.150 
and I'd say dazing definitely has an
edge<00:03:57.580> here<00:03:57.850> in<00:03:58.030> this<00:03:58.180> game<00:03:58.740> so<00:03:59.740> far<00:03:59.920> because

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.160 
edge here in this game so far because

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:01.830 
edge here in this game so far because
he's<00:04:00.340> Bansha<00:04:00.730> to<00:04:00.880> deny<00:04:01.180> the<00:04:01.240> second<00:04:01.570> expansion

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
he's Bansha to deny the second expansion

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.990 
he's Bansha to deny the second expansion
he's<00:04:02.230> picked<00:04:02.590> up<00:04:02.710> a<00:04:02.860> third<00:04:03.310> expansion<00:04:03.610> of<00:04:03.910> his

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 
he's picked up a third expansion of his

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:11.100 
he's picked up a third expansion of his
own<00:04:04.500> definitely<00:04:05.500> had<00:04:05.650> in<00:04:05.740> terms<00:04:05.920> of<00:04:06.010> economy

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:11.110 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:13.750 

and<00:04:12.110> meanwhile<00:04:12.740> he<00:04:13.010> race<00:04:13.220> has<00:04:13.370> been<00:04:13.490> playing

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:13.760 
and meanwhile he race has been playing

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.330 
and meanwhile he race has been playing
very<00:04:13.910> cautiously<00:04:14.480> we<00:04:15.410> did<00:04:15.590> see<00:04:15.800> that<00:04:15.830> long

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:16.340 
very cautiously we did see that long

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:18.970 
very cautiously we did see that long
game<00:04:16.640> against<00:04:17.150> piano<00:04:17.840> that<00:04:18.110> he<00:04:18.200> played<00:04:18.440> in<00:04:18.769> my

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:18.980 
game against piano that he played in my

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:20.800 
game against piano that he played in my
dual<00:04:19.190> commentary<00:04:19.610> with<00:04:19.940> the<00:04:20.060> true<00:04:20.299> blue<00:04:20.540> and

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810 
dual commentary with the true blue and

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:23.440 
dual commentary with the true blue and
jiri<00:04:21.590> while<00:04:22.190> he<00:04:22.370> did<00:04:22.580> win<00:04:22.820> that<00:04:23.030> was<00:04:23.270> not

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:23.450 
jiri while he did win that was not

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:25.720 
jiri while he did win that was not
exactly<00:04:23.810> the<00:04:23.930> most<00:04:24.020> impressive<00:04:24.730> Terran

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:25.730 
exactly the most impressive Terran

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:27.130 
exactly the most impressive Terran
player<00:04:25.880> in<00:04:26.210> that<00:04:26.240> match<00:04:26.510> it<00:04:26.720> definitely<00:04:27.050> took

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:27.140 
player in that match it definitely took

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:29.700 
player in that match it definitely took
longer<00:04:27.440> than<00:04:27.680> he<00:04:28.040> needed<00:04:28.400> to<00:04:28.670> against<00:04:28.970> piano

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 
longer than he needed to against piano

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:32.440 
longer than he needed to against piano
so<00:04:30.710> I<00:04:30.770> was<00:04:30.890> a<00:04:30.920> little<00:04:30.950> surprised<00:04:31.400> by<00:04:31.550> that<00:04:31.730> that

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:32.450 
so I was a little surprised by that that

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:33.760 
so I was a little surprised by that that
they're<00:04:32.720> not<00:04:32.870> playing<00:04:33.080> someone<00:04:33.380> like<00:04:33.530> flash

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:33.770 
they're not playing someone like flash

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:35.980 
they're not playing someone like flash
for<00:04:33.980> example<00:04:34.310> but<00:04:34.400> I<00:04:34.460> think<00:04:34.670> flash<00:04:34.990> underhand

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:35.990 
for example but I think flash underhand

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:37.840 
for example but I think flash underhand
has<00:04:36.140> been<00:04:36.410> has<00:04:36.830> been<00:04:36.860> way<00:04:37.160> over<00:04:37.190> played<00:04:37.670> he

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:37.850 
has been has been way over played he

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:40.060 
has been has been way over played he
isn't<00:04:38.090> playing<00:04:38.240> game<00:04:38.540> for<00:04:38.810> so<00:04:39.050> take<00:04:39.770> that<00:04:39.800> back

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:40.070 
isn't playing game for so take that back

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:42.220 
isn't playing game for so take that back

actually they are going to play him of

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:45.310 
actually they are going to play him of

II this could be a very deadly for days
and<00:05:13.010> days<00:05:13.190> n<00:05:13.370> has<00:05:13.550> just<00:05:13.850> spotted<00:05:14.030> it<00:05:14.270> though<00:05:14.420> it

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:14.960 
and days n has just spotted it though it

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:16.540 
and days n has just spotted it though it
looks<00:05:15.230> like<00:05:15.290> this<00:05:15.470> one<00:05:15.710> vulture<00:05:16.100> here<00:05:16.310> and

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:16.550 
looks like this one vulture here and

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:19.120 
looks like this one vulture here and
that's<00:05:16.970> it<00:05:17.210> because<00:05:17.870> of<00:05:18.020> the<00:05:18.140> because<00:05:18.770> of<00:05:18.950> the

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:19.130 
that's it because of the because of the

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:21.520 
that's it because of the because of the
photon<00:05:19.730> can<00:05:19.940> that's<00:05:20.150> it<00:05:20.300> so<00:05:20.900> not<00:05:21.320> gonna<00:05:21.470> be

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:21.530 
photon can that's it so not gonna be

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:24.400 
photon can that's it so not gonna be
able<00:05:21.590> to<00:05:21.710> do<00:05:21.770> anything<00:05:21.980> there<00:05:22.280> but<00:05:23.410> vultures

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:24.410 
able to do anything there but vultures

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:31.550 
well I know you smart but he should be

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:33.520 
well I know you smart but he should be
putting<00:05:32.240> a<00:05:32.480> pile<00:05:32.780> on<00:05:32.960> wall<00:05:33.169> there<00:05:33.350> at<00:05:33.470> the

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:33.530 
putting a pile on wall there at the

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:34.570 
putting a pile on wall there at the
choke<00:05:33.740> point<00:05:33.770> you<00:05:34.100> could<00:05:34.190> do<00:05:34.280> that<00:05:34.310> pretty

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:34.580 
choke point you could do that pretty

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:36.310 
choke point you could do that pretty
easily<00:05:34.669> and<00:05:35.180> now<00:05:35.390> for<00:05:35.450> vultures<00:05:35.840> are<00:05:36.110> dropped

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:36.320 
easily and now for vultures are dropped

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:37.690 
easily and now for vultures are dropped
inside<00:05:36.530> of<00:05:36.800> days<00:05:36.919> eggs<00:05:37.100> basically<00:05:37.430> only<00:05:37.550> has

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:02.960 
lost all of his gas probes and now I'm

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:04.900 
lost all of his gas probes and now I'm
he's<00:06:03.530> going<00:06:03.740> to<00:06:03.800> lose<00:06:04.010> a<00:06:04.070> couple<00:06:04.190> more<00:06:04.640> probes

he's going to lose a couple more probes

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:06.340 
he's going to lose a couple more probes
before<00:06:05.240> that<00:06:05.360> can<00:06:05.570> and<00:06:05.720> finally<00:06:05.960> takes<00:06:06.140> it<00:06:06.260> out

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:06.350 
before that can and finally takes it out

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:08.920 
before that can and finally takes it out
but<00:06:07.310> that's<00:06:07.490> a<00:06:07.730> little<00:06:08.000> careless<00:06:08.270> by<00:06:08.540> dazing

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:08.930 
but that's a little careless by dazing

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:10.540 
but that's a little careless by dazing
they're<00:06:09.110> not<00:06:09.320> bringing<00:06:09.530> any<00:06:09.800> Germans<00:06:10.250> back<00:06:10.370> to

they're not bringing any Germans back to
take<00:06:10.700> care<00:06:10.940> of<00:06:11.030> it<00:06:11.090> just<00:06:11.210> basically<00:06:12.020> waiting

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:12.590 
take care of it just basically waiting

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:14.170 
take care of it just basically waiting
for<00:06:12.860> the<00:06:12.919> attack<00:06:13.160> to<00:06:13.310> Peter<00:06:13.550> out<00:06:13.610> by<00:06:13.880> itself

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:14.180 
for the attack to Peter out by itself

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:16.029 
for the attack to Peter out by itself
and<00:06:14.419> that's<00:06:14.480> not<00:06:14.780> a<00:06:14.840> good<00:06:14.990> idea<00:06:15.110> you<00:06:15.890> don't

00:06:16.029 --> 00:06:16.039 
and that's not a good idea you don't

00:06:16.039 --> 00:06:17.500 
and that's not a good idea you don't
wanna<00:06:16.190> be<00:06:16.250> taking<00:06:16.430> such<00:06:16.550> a<00:06:16.610> hit<00:06:16.760> and<00:06:16.940> all<00:06:17.120> mine

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:17.510 
wanna be taking such a hit and all mine

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:19.570 
wanna be taking such a hit and all mine
goes<00:06:17.780> off<00:06:17.930> on<00:06:18.140> those<00:06:18.289> two<00:06:18.440> goons<00:06:18.560> so<00:06:19.190> those

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:19.580 
goes off on those two goons so those

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:20.679 
goes off on those two goons so those
ruins<00:06:19.910> are<00:06:20.000> now<00:06:20.150> very

00:06:20.679 --> 00:06:20.689 
ruins are now very

00:06:20.689 --> 00:06:23.350 
ruins are now very
vulnerable<00:06:21.309> meanwhile<00:06:22.309> I<00:06:22.489> believe<00:06:22.909> that's<00:06:23.089> a

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:23.360 
vulnerable meanwhile I believe that's a

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:27.399 
vulnerable meanwhile I believe that's a
plus<00:06:23.749> to<00:06:24.110> attack<00:06:24.529> and<00:06:24.879> plus<00:06:25.959> maybe<00:06:26.959> not<00:06:27.169> plus

00:06:27.399 --> 00:06:27.409 
plus to attack and plus maybe not plus

00:06:27.409 --> 00:06:29.979

dating<00:06:37.729> now<00:06:37.879> trying<00:06:38.179> to<00:06:38.239> pin<00:06:38.389> these<00:06:38.509> forces

00:06:39.009 --> 00:06:39.019 
dating now trying to pin these forces

00:06:39.019 --> 00:06:41.379 
dating now trying to pin these forces
but<00:06:39.379> hearing<00:06:40.189> very<00:06:40.309> smartly<00:06:40.729> has<00:06:40.819> gone<00:06:41.119> for

00:06:41.379 --> 00:06:41.389 
but hearing very smartly has gone for

00:06:41.389 --> 00:06:43.359 
but hearing very smartly has gone for
those<00:06:41.509> dropships<00:06:42.469> I<00:06:42.799> think<00:06:42.979> that's<00:06:43.099> another

00:06:43.359 --> 00:06:43.369 
those dropships I think that's another

00:06:43.369 --> 00:06:45.549 
those dropships I think that's another
thing<00:06:43.610> that's<00:06:43.849> pretty<00:06:44.389> rare<00:06:44.659> and<00:06:44.959> should<00:06:45.469> be

00:06:45.549 --> 00:06:45.559 
thing that's pretty rare and should be

00:06:45.559 --> 00:06:47.889 
thing that's pretty rare and should be
done<00:06:45.589> more<00:06:45.979> often<00:06:46.429> in<00:06:46.669> turn<00:06:46.909> vs<00:06:47.239> protoss<00:06:47.569> is<00:06:47.809> to

00:06:47.889 --> 00:06:47.899 
done more often in turn vs protoss is to

00:06:47.899 --> 00:06:49.659 
done more often in turn vs protoss is to
go<00:06:47.989> for<00:06:48.110> those<00:06:48.259> drop<00:06:48.469> ships<00:06:48.499> and<00:06:48.889> now<00:06:49.610> the

00:06:49.659 --> 00:06:49.669 
go for those drop ships and now the

00:06:49.669 --> 00:06:51.369 
go for those drop ships and now the
first<00:06:49.849> arbiter<00:06:50.209> is<00:06:50.329> about<00:06:50.629> to<00:06:50.779> come<00:06:50.899> out<00:06:51.019> for

00:06:51.369 --> 00:06:51.379 
first arbiter is about to come out for

00:06:51.379 --> 00:06:53.679 
first arbiter is about to come out for
four<00:06:52.219> days<00:06:52.369> eng<00:06:52.579> but<00:06:52.759> he<00:06:52.819> certainly<00:06:53.059> lost<00:06:53.389> his

00:06:53.679 --> 00:06:53.689 
four days eng but he certainly lost his

00:06:53.689 --> 00:06:55.899 
four days eng but he certainly lost his
edge<00:06:53.839> that<00:06:54.139> I<00:06:54.169> said<00:06:54.860> he<00:06:55.309> had<00:06:55.489> about<00:06:55.669> five

00:06:55.899 --> 00:06:55.909 
edge that I said he had about five

00:06:55.909 --> 00:06:58.479 
edge that I said he had about five
minutes<00:06:56.119> ago<00:06:56.649> he<00:06:57.649> definitely<00:06:57.829> has<00:06:58.099> lost<00:06:58.309> it

00:06:58.479 --> 00:06:58.489 
minutes ago he definitely has lost it

00:06:58.489 --> 00:06:59.739 
minutes ago he definitely has lost it
because<00:06:58.579> he's<00:06:58.789> lost<00:06:58.939> so<00:06:59.119> many<00:06:59.179> probes<00:06:59.509> in<00:06:59.659> this

00:06:59.739 --> 00:06:59.749 
because he's lost so many probes in this

00:06:59.749 --> 00:07:02.799 
because he's lost so many probes in this
main<00:07:00.019> and<00:07:00.339> basically<00:07:01.339> here<00:07:02.179> he<00:07:02.269> can<00:07:02.389> do<00:07:02.509> fine

00:07:02.799 --> 00:07:02.809 
main and basically here he can do fine

00:07:02.809 --> 00:07:04.509 
main and basically here he can do fine
with<00:07:03.019> three<00:07:03.199> basis<00:07:03.529> versus<00:07:03.829> four<00:07:04.009> basis<00:07:04.369> for

00:07:04.509 --> 00:07:04.519 
with three basis versus four basis for

00:07:04.519 --> 00:07:07.569 
with three basis versus four basis for
now<00:07:04.610> I<00:07:05.619> think<00:07:06.619> here<00:07:06.769> he<00:07:06.860> also<00:07:07.009> had<00:07:07.339> the

00:07:07.569 --> 00:07:07.579 
now I think here he also had the

00:07:07.579 --> 00:07:14.229 
now I think here he also had the
upgrades<00:07:11.889> meanwhile<00:07:12.889> though<00:07:13.069> a<00:07:13.099> lot<00:07:13.610> of<00:07:13.669> more

00:07:14.229 --> 00:07:14.239 
upgrades meanwhile though a lot of more

00:07:14.239 --> 00:07:16.269 
upgrades meanwhile though a lot of more
a<00:07:14.569> lot<00:07:15.139> more<00:07:15.199> vultures<00:07:15.739> streaming<00:07:16.099> into<00:07:16.249> the

00:07:16.269 --> 00:07:16.279 
a lot more vultures streaming into the

00:07:16.279 --> 00:07:19.389 
a lot more vultures streaming into the
middle<00:07:16.579> and<00:07:17.379> the<00:07:18.379> thing<00:07:18.559> is<00:07:18.589> though<00:07:18.889> he<00:07:19.129> is<00:07:19.369> not

00:07:19.389 --> 00:07:19.399 
middle and the thing is though he is not

00:07:19.399 --> 00:07:21.789 
middle and the thing is though he is not
about<00:07:19.879> to<00:07:19.939> move<00:07:20.239> out<00:07:20.419> anytime<00:07:20.689> soon<00:07:20.869> so<00:07:21.319> not

00:07:21.789 --> 00:07:21.799 
about to move out anytime soon so not

00:07:21.799 --> 00:07:23.949 
about to move out anytime soon so not
sure<00:07:21.979> what<00:07:22.249> he's<00:07:22.549> exactly<00:07:23.119> doing<00:07:23.479> here<00:07:23.659> inside

00:07:23.949 --> 00:07:23.959 
sure what he's exactly doing here inside

00:07:23.959 --> 00:07:25.869 
sure what he's exactly doing here inside
a<00:07:24.019> space<00:07:24.259> it<00:07:24.439> seems<00:07:24.619> that<00:07:24.769> he's<00:07:24.919> just<00:07:25.159> waiting

00:07:25.869 --> 00:07:25.879 
a space it seems that he's just waiting

00:07:25.879 --> 00:07:27.429 
a space it seems that he's just waiting
for<00:07:26.149> days<00:07:26.300> ain't<00:07:26.479> it<00:07:26.599> going<00:07:26.839> for<00:07:27.050> an<00:07:27.110> attack

00:07:27.429 --> 00:07:27.439 
for days ain't it going for an attack

00:07:27.439 --> 00:07:29.379 
for days ain't it going for an attack
and<00:07:27.679> then<00:07:27.829> go<00:07:28.039> for<00:07:28.219> the<00:07:28.249> counter-attack<00:07:28.669> he's

00:07:29.379 --> 00:07:29.389 
and then go for the counter-attack he's

00:07:29.389 --> 00:07:30.639 
and then go for the counter-attack he's
trying<00:07:29.659> to<00:07:29.719> do<00:07:29.839> some<00:07:30.079> damage<00:07:30.229> with<00:07:30.409> these<00:07:30.619> uh

Zhang<00:07:39.439> has<00:07:39.619> been<00:07:39.800> lacking<00:07:40.009> in<00:07:40.369> his

00:07:49.839 --> 00:07:49.849 
killed off there and day zhang is

00:07:49.849 --> 00:07:52.389 
killed off there and day zhang is
basically<00:07:50.479> on<00:07:50.749> being<00:07:51.409> out<00:07:51.649> mike<00:07:51.919> road<00:07:52.159> here<00:07:52.369> I

basically on being out mike road here I

00:07:52.399 --> 00:07:55.209 
basically on being out mike road here I
feel<00:07:52.669> day<00:07:53.539> Zhang<00:07:53.749> it<00:07:54.199> feels<00:07:54.409> like<00:07:54.529> his<00:07:54.619> APM<00:07:55.039> is

00:07:55.209 --> 00:07:55.219 
feel day Zhang it feels like his APM is

00:07:55.219 --> 00:07:57.040 
feel day Zhang it feels like his APM is
just<00:07:55.429> not<00:07:55.759> exactly<00:07:56.239> high<00:07:56.539> enough<00:07:56.779> to<00:07:56.869> deal

00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:57.050 
just not exactly high enough to deal

00:07:57.050 --> 00:08:00.819 
just not exactly high enough to deal
with<00:07:57.079> this<00:07:57.289> but<00:07:57.889> dazing<00:07:58.189> has<00:07:58.309> a<00:07:58.339> drop<00:07:58.550> of<00:07:58.610> his
