00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.809
 I bought myself but first of all 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.340
 I wanted to thank the physio because without 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.080
 they would not have been possible for me 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.779
 I had a new computer because 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.859
 economically I did not give myself to buy 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.830
 but they have made me a great 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.269
 discount of almost 50% thanks to 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.640
 they have the new computer so 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.109

 buy the computer by hand 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.620
 buy him I did not buy it but for 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.360
 give him a discount so he can 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.980
 have a new computer or any 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.350
 thing well you know I have fulfilled my 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.960
 word I have the new computer I made a 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.910
 direct 24 hours but it would not have been 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.110
 possible without the chunk piece of stub 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.420
 discount I have made the 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.789
 lords of vice and one thing to tell you 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.399
 before you see the computer goes lewis 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.800
 very important is that the audio of the 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.230
 camera is wrong is defective of 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.910
 buy a micro with which I will 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.309
 put the voice-over had already recorded 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.540
 everything but when listening to the audio I do not 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.240
 seems to have the quality 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:12.240
 as to put it then what I'm going to 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.610
 to do now is to comment on the 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.380
 images so I hope it looks good and 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.150
 please go through the website of the 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.690
 pitiÃºs and I am from the Canary Islands is very 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.880
 important they have their own service 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:25.830
 canary messaging is wanted to say this 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.000
 because you already know that I am grateful 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.800
 with people who are grateful 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.220
 with me and albisu it has been so 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:33.690
 I thank you and it is that it is impressive 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:35.010
 that a company has shipments to the Canary Islands 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:36.750
 in this way I know that the rest 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:38.040
 of the world would be in good shape this is not 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.210
 it's a little the same but to the canaries 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.490
 which is that every time you get us a 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.960
 shipping when the post office comes 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.270
 to pay him because he goes through customs 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.490
 and you have to pay the mail but on the floor 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.530
 has a courier service already 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.090
 implicit in the page that works with 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.270
 your company and when you do the 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.950
 order you can already directly dial that 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.240
 You're from the Canary Islands and they charge you for those 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.590
 additional cases so that when the 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.930
 package arrive at your house do not take the 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.240
 surprise that they charge you 50 40 or 60 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.040
 more dollars or euros or whatever you want 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.440
 so I wanted to comment on that because it's 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.479
 important if you want to order something in this 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.040
 company and nothing else I will show you the 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.610
 pce that sure with nice desire to 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:13.610
 see it because 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:17.749
 my new voice or I'm in love with my 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.159
 I have fallen in love since I saw it and I 

00:02:17.749 --> 00:02:21.769
 I leave because I want you to see it 

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:24.109
 please the truth that only seeing the 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:26.090
 exterior is impressive is one of the 

00:02:24.109 --> 00:02:30.319
 things that I like the most is the box is the 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:32.719
 h 440 of nz exists and it is a box that 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:35.239
 comes with 4 fans including three 

00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:37.430
 front and one back there you are 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:39.469
 seeing then to ventilate very well the 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.180
 inside the computer I already tell you that 

00:02:39.469 --> 00:02:43.730
 only and the simple fact of the box is 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.620
 hallucinate good the power supply no 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.450
 it's as big as it seems here that 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.040
 It looks like a contraption but it's because it 's a 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.569
 coating where all the cables go 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.579
 so that it does not look like because you are 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:59.090
 seeing no cable is seen and it is 

00:02:52.579 --> 00:03:01.400
 of 850 watts the z the nzx of hold 90 850 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:03.409
 Pieces of chunk of piece of bread the kit 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:07.459
 liquid cooling is also of 

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:08.299
 the nzx brand of crack in the x 61 good and 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:10.790
 one of the things that has surprised me 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:13.189
 of this liquid cooling is that 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:15.439
 has a software and an application 

00:03:13.189 --> 00:03:17.959
 that allows me to configure the computer to 

00:03:15.439 --> 00:03:20.120
 through the mobile or the same desk 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:25.069
 the plate is impressive 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:28.190
 is the ms 6 797 gaming 6 is a board 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:31.159
 perfect gamer base of ms and with port 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:34.310
 usb on your motherboard 3.1 also has 

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:36.680
 the port m2 and it is already express has the 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:39.140
 audio pass bose incorporated in the 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:41.390
 plate through usb to be able 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:43.909
 connect some speakers and enjoy 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:46.190
 of sound impressively in 

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:48.079
 seriously can not imagine the piece of 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:49.730
 motherboard that is I know there are 

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:51.680
 better but to me the one that I have 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:54.290
 love the processor that is not seen in the 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:55.670
 pc we can not appreciate it because I guess 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:59.959
 will be the back but good 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:03.290
 I teach the box is an intel core i7 4.790 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:05.690
 here and it is of 4 cores and 8 threads of 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:09.859
 processing with a base frequency 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:11.629
 turbo 4.0 4.4 gigahertz good in the 

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:14.359
 computer I came two ram memory from 

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:17.539
 8 gb of the crucial brand with which 

00:04:14.359 --> 00:04:20.120
 I have a total of 16 GB of ram 

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:21.410
 but I want to increase it and upload it to 32 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.060
 since I have two spaces 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:26.540
 available and I'm going to ask for two ram 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:28.700
 exactly the same to go from 16 to 3 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:34.030
 and 2 and almost still the psd is better the 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:36.260
 graph is the ms and gtx 980 is a pass 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:38.240
 It has temperatures and a 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:41.060
 excellent cooling of the best 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:42.560
 what there is right now and the best thing that it has 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:44.780
 is that it has a technology that allows 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:47.030
 keep the fans at rest 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:49.220
 when they are not used 100% so that they do not 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:51.140
 they are overloading all the time 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:52.820
 also look at the piece of cache or piece 

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:56.900
 of size that they have compared to me 

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:59.000
 hand is already giant is that it is giant 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:00.350
 I want you to appreciate the size of the 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
 graphic the hard disk is a hard drive 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:04.190
 mechanical one terabyte capacity 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.900
 Nothing to emphasize the truth to good 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:11.360
 we have a crucial ssd disk mx 200 of 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:12.770
 250 GB and this disk on this disk is 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:15.230
 install the operating system the 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:17.180
 main programs or games that 

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:19.220
 you want them to go very fast in the 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:21.140
 computer since it's the best way 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:23.720
 to maximize performance and 

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:25.910
 reliability of the pce since it is a 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:27.540
 boot disk so to call it from 

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:29.640
 high speed 

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:31.530
 it does not compare to a normal hard drive 

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:33.120
 good you see that to say to you already you have seen 

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:34.920
 the piece of calcium of wheat its 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:36.660
 computer that I have now is thanks 

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:37.920

 always and for encouraging me to continue 

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:44.280
 continue no longer surrender and vice 

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:46.440
 obviously for facilitating me to a 

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:48.060
 very good price so I recommend it 

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:49.980
 You really have some discounts 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:51.630
 incredible and it's a reliable store the 

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:55.020
 computer I came perfect all the 

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:56.910
 pieces and nothing nothing but 

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:59.760
 highlight just hope the video 

00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:01.440
 have not been made heavy that having 

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:02.910
 put the voice in off 

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:04.020
 commenting so very fast all by 

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:06.120
 over because I do not understand much 

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:08.580
 computers I have spoken to you a bit 

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:10.560
 explained more or less what I know to 

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:12.030
 that was not based heavy not because I can 

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:13.500
 get into technicalities or get to 

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:14.940
 find extra information from the computer 

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:18.090
 I think it would have been too heavy for 

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:19.590
 all and nothing if you liked the video 

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:21.450
