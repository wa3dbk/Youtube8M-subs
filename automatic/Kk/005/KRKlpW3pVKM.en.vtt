00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
expect much from this as far as I'm

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.890 
expect much from this as far as I'm
concerned<00:00:12.990> it's<00:00:13.170> pretty<00:00:13.860> much<00:00:14.009> a<00:00:14.070> joke<00:00:14.490> and<00:00:15.059> I

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
concerned it's pretty much a joke and I

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.540 
concerned it's pretty much a joke and I
need<00:00:16.410> to<00:00:16.500> show<00:00:16.710> you<00:00:16.740> what's<00:00:16.980> inside<00:00:17.279> of<00:00:17.310> it

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
need to show you what's inside of it

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:18.890 
need to show you what's inside of it
because<00:00:17.670> I<00:00:17.850> was<00:00:17.970> curious<00:00:18.300> too

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
because I was curious too

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.859 
because I was curious too
and<00:00:19.320> I<00:00:20.100> don't<00:00:20.160> believe<00:00:20.400> there<00:00:20.850> was<00:00:20.880> any<00:00:20.970> game

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
and I don't believe there was any game

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.380 
and I don't believe there was any game
come<00:00:22.140> unboxings<00:00:22.980> at<00:00:23.490> least<00:00:23.699> for<00:00:23.880> games<00:00:24.240> like

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
come unboxings at least for games like

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.890 
come unboxings at least for games like
this<00:00:24.830> so<00:00:26.029> I'm<00:00:27.029> not<00:00:27.150> really<00:00:27.300> gonna<00:00:27.449> say<00:00:27.660> much<00:00:27.869> in

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
this so I'm not really gonna say much in

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.030 
this so I'm not really gonna say much in
this<00:00:28.080> one<00:00:28.289> but<00:00:28.500> I<00:00:28.529> just<00:00:28.619> I<00:00:28.920> hope<00:00:29.070> you<00:00:29.220> can<00:00:29.369> enjoy

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:31.040 
this one but I just I hope you can enjoy

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:42.440 
this one but I just I hope you can enjoy
the<00:00:32.040> lack<00:00:32.340> of<00:00:32.690> lack<00:00:33.690> of<00:00:33.739> content

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.600 

it's<00:00:42.960> pretty<00:00:43.140> shiny<00:00:43.380> box<00:00:43.649> I'll<00:00:44.309> give<00:00:44.460> it<00:00:44.579> that

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
it's pretty shiny box I'll give it that

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:50.030 
it's pretty shiny box I'll give it that
but<00:00:45.540> it<00:00:45.660> feels<00:00:45.930> pretty<00:00:46.380> flimsy

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:50.040 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:57.490 

it's<00:00:50.370> made<00:00:50.670> and<00:00:50.880> printed<00:00:51.329> in<00:00:51.510> China

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:57.500 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:15.830 

as<00:00:57.950> a<00:00:58.010> lock<00:00:58.700> tab

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.420 

so<00:01:16.840> it's<00:01:17.110> pretty<00:01:17.230> much<00:01:17.410> just<00:01:17.470> this<00:01:18.190> little

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:18.430 
so it's pretty much just this little

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:20.610 
so it's pretty much just this little
plastic<00:01:18.610> tray<00:01:19.090> with<00:01:19.690> the<00:01:19.900> game<00:01:20.230> sitting<00:01:20.500> in

the<00:01:20.680> middle<00:01:20.920> and<00:01:21.250> mainly<00:01:22.080> nothing<00:01:23.080> else<00:01:23.230> in

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:23.350 
the middle and mainly nothing else in

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:40.649 
the middle and mainly nothing else in
