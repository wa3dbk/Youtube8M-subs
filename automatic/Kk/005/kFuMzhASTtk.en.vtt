let's just be fast all yet the third
don't<00:04:10.700> think<00:04:11.000> that<00:04:11.180> was<00:04:11.360> gonna<00:04:11.540> work<00:04:11.660> it<00:04:12.190> but

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:13.190 
don't think that was gonna work it but

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:15.870 
don't think that was gonna work it but
let's<00:04:13.430> just<00:04:13.490> wait

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:15.880 

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:22.150 

finding<00:04:16.880> out<00:04:17.120> the<00:04:17.390> iron<00:04:18.079> ore<00:04:18.760> oh<00:04:20.890> yeah<00:04:21.890> I<00:04:21.920> mean

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:22.160

cred<00:04:22.430> okay<00:04:23.000> got<00:04:23.180> interrupted<00:04:23.810> there<00:04:23.960> let's

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:24.320 
cred okay got interrupted there let's

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.470 
cred okay got interrupted there let's
just<00:04:24.530> get<00:04:24.680> that<00:04:24.830> I<00:04:24.950> can<00:04:25.220> I<00:04:25.460> think<00:04:25.880> it<00:04:26.060> was<00:04:26.240> not

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:26.480 
just get that I can I think it was not

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:29.590 
just get that I can I think it was not
efficient<00:04:27.050> motors<00:04:27.230> not<00:04:28.180> let<00:04:29.180> us<00:04:29.360> try<00:04:29.540> this

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:29.600 
efficient motors not let us try this

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:33.250 
efficient motors not let us try this
again<00:04:30.730> ok<00:04:31.730> there's<00:04:32.600> the<00:04:32.660> chicken<00:04:32.990> nuggets

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:33.260 
again ok there's the chicken nuggets

again ok there's the chicken nuggets
back<00:04:33.410> in<00:04:33.580> give<00:04:34.580> this<00:04:34.760> money<00:04:34.940> bush<00:04:35.800> get<00:04:36.800> over

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:37.010 
back in give this money bush get over

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:39.700 
back in give this money bush get over
here<00:04:37.040> and<00:04:37.850> just<00:04:38.180> before<00:04:38.330> it<00:04:38.570> would<00:04:38.750> go<00:04:39.290> it<00:04:39.470> I

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:39.710 
here and just before it would go it I

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:43.540 
here and just before it would go it I
think<00:04:40.220> this<00:04:40.310> that<00:04:40.700> was<00:04:40.880> efficient<00:04:41.330> I<00:04:41.510> guess<00:04:42.550> we

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:43.550 
think this that was efficient I guess we

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:47.170 
think this that was efficient I guess we
will<00:04:43.730> find<00:04:43.790> out<00:04:44.270> shortly<00:04:45.400> okay<00:04:46.400> just<00:04:46.700> while

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:47.180 
will find out shortly okay just while
