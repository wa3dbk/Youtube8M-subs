mouse i've ever used i'm actually using

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:44.430 
mouse i've ever used i'm actually using
at<00:00:42.820> the<00:00:42.850> moment<00:00:42.910> I've<00:00:43.329> come<00:00:43.570> adopted<00:00:44.199> I'm<00:00:44.290> not

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:44.440 
at the moment I've come adopted I'm not

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.410 
at the moment I've come adopted I'm not
giving<00:00:44.649> a<00:00:44.739> certain<00:00:45.010> series<00:00:45.190> because<00:00:45.519> then<00:00:45.790> it

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:46.420 
giving a certain series because then it

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:48.540 
giving a certain series because then it
is<00:00:46.629> such<00:00:46.960> a<00:00:46.989> good<00:00:47.379> Mouse<00:00:47.530> I<00:00:47.739> just<00:00:47.890> love<00:00:48.129> it<00:00:48.250> and

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:48.550 
is such a good Mouse I just love it and

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:50.969 
is such a good Mouse I just love it and
this<00:00:49.449> mouse<00:00:49.750> comes<00:00:50.019> in<00:00:50.110> two<00:00:50.260> versions<00:00:50.440> this<00:00:50.860> is

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:50.979 
this mouse comes in two versions this is

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:52.380 
this mouse comes in two versions this is
the<00:00:51.040> laser<00:00:51.220> version<00:00:51.699> there<00:00:51.940> is<00:00:51.970> also<00:00:52.180> an

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:52.390 
the laser version there is also an

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:54.180 
the laser version there is also an
optical<00:00:52.780> version<00:00:53.170> the<00:00:53.559> main<00:00:53.710> difference<00:00:53.739> is

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:54.190 
optical version the main difference is

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:56.790 
optical version the main difference is
the<00:00:54.579> optical<00:00:55.269> cheaper<00:00:55.800> different

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:56.800 
the optical cheaper different

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.259 
the optical cheaper different
performance<00:00:57.190> go<00:00:57.339> for<00:00:57.550> laser<00:00:57.729> one<00:00:58.000> you<00:00:58.120> could

00:00:58.259 --> 00:00:58.269 
performance go for laser one you could

00:00:58.269 --> 00:00:59.850 
performance go for laser one you could
consider<00:00:58.449> that<00:00:58.720> budget<00:00:59.140> I<00:00:59.290> was<00:00:59.530> just<00:00:59.680> going

00:00:59.850 --> 00:00:59.860 
consider that budget I was just going

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:01.410 
consider that budget I was just going
for<00:00:59.949> optical<00:01:00.309> one<00:01:00.399> and<00:01:00.610> which<00:01:01.059> makes<00:01:01.239> it<00:01:01.329> be

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:01.420 
for optical one and which makes it be

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.179 
for optical one and which makes it be
cheaper<00:01:01.769> basically<00:01:02.769> I'm<00:01:02.920> going<00:01:03.070> to<00:01:03.129> run

00:01:03.179 --> 00:01:03.189 
cheaper basically I'm going to run

00:01:03.189 --> 00:01:04.350 
cheaper basically I'm going to run
through<00:01:03.250> the<00:01:03.400> future<00:01:03.670> of<00:01:03.729> the<00:01:03.759> mouse<00:01:03.939> and<00:01:03.970> tell

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.360 
through the future of the mouse and tell

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.330 
through the future of the mouse and tell
you<00:01:04.509> why<00:01:04.780> I<00:01:05.080> love<00:01:05.379> this<00:01:05.439> math<00:01:05.740> so<00:01:05.920> much<00:01:06.159> because

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:06.340 
you why I love this math so much because

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.120 
you why I love this math so much because
it<00:01:06.490> really<00:01:06.790> is<00:01:07.000> a<00:01:07.030> wicked<00:01:07.509> mouse<00:01:07.930> so<00:01:08.680> first<00:01:09.009> of

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:09.130 
it really is a wicked mouse so first of

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.570 
it really is a wicked mouse so first of
all<00:01:09.189> it's<00:01:10.119> Mouse<00:01:10.590> 3200<00:01:11.590> DPI<00:01:11.830> I'm<00:01:12.250> just<00:01:12.369> going

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:12.580 
all it's Mouse 3200 DPI I'm just going

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:13.920 
all it's Mouse 3200 DPI I'm just going
to<00:01:12.640> go<00:01:12.700> through<00:01:13.090> all<00:01:13.119> those<00:01:13.270> high<00:01:13.509> twitching

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:13.930 
to go through all those high twitching

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:14.999 
to go through all those high twitching
movements<00:01:14.229> if<00:01:14.320> you<00:01:14.409> like<00:01:14.530> to<00:01:14.650> have<00:01:14.740> it<00:01:14.860> on<00:01:14.979> a

00:01:14.999 --> 00:01:15.009 
movements if you like to have it on a

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:18.270 
movements if you like to have it on a
high<00:01:15.970> sensitivity<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:17.799> best<00:01:17.979> thing<00:01:18.100> is<00:01:18.189> you

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.280 
high sensitivity the best thing is you

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:19.170 
high sensitivity the best thing is you
can<00:01:18.400> actually<00:01:18.460> change<00:01:18.820> the<00:01:18.970> sensitivity

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:19.180 
can actually change the sensitivity

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.060 
can actually change the sensitivity
really<00:01:19.810> easy<00:01:19.930> near<00:01:20.200> a<00:01:20.229> few<00:01:20.439> issues<00:01:20.590> on<00:01:20.950> this

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:21.070 
really easy near a few issues on this

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:23.640 
really easy near a few issues on this
mouse<00:01:21.540> so<00:01:22.540> there<00:01:22.630> are<00:01:22.659> drivers<00:01:22.990> you<00:01:23.500> can

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:23.650 
mouse so there are drivers you can

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:26.940 
mouse so there are drivers you can
change<00:01:23.890> DPI<00:01:24.460> in-game<00:01:25.030> no<00:01:25.390> problem<00:01:25.950> basically

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
change DPI in-game no problem basically

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:28.770 
change DPI in-game no problem basically
you<00:01:27.159> can<00:01:27.310> do<00:01:27.430> in<00:01:27.549> increments<00:01:27.880> of<00:01:28.060> 1<00:01:28.360> so<00:01:28.720> you

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:28.780 
you can do in increments of 1 so you

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:29.880 
you can do in increments of 1 so you
actually<00:01:28.930> mean<00:01:29.170> this<00:01:29.350> means<00:01:29.590> that<00:01:29.619> you<00:01:29.740> could

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:29.890 
actually mean this means that you could

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:34.200 
actually mean this means that you could
go<00:01:29.979> from<00:01:30.810> 534<00:01:31.810> to<00:01:32.259> 535<00:01:33.159> in<00:01:33.460> game<00:01:33.700> no<00:01:33.909> problem

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.210 
go from 534 to 535 in game no problem

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:36.210 
go from 534 to 535 in game no problem
that<00:01:34.360> even<00:01:34.600> quitting<00:01:35.110> up<00:01:35.200> the<00:01:35.290> game<00:01:35.440> do<00:01:35.650> all<00:01:35.920> on

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:36.220 
that even quitting up the game do all on

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.450 
that even quitting up the game do all on
the<00:01:36.430> mouse<00:01:36.610> without<00:01:36.790> drivers<00:01:37.180> which<00:01:37.510> is<00:01:37.630> crazy

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
the mouse without drivers which is crazy

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.680 
the mouse without drivers which is crazy
this<00:01:39.460> is<00:01:39.550> a<00:01:39.580> really<00:01:39.940> cool<00:01:40.060> feature<00:01:40.240> wonder<00:01:40.659> I

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:40.690 
this is a really cool feature wonder I

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:42.090 
this is a really cool feature wonder I
haven't<00:01:40.750> seen<00:01:41.050> any<00:01:41.320> other<00:01:41.409> master<00:01:41.770> force<00:01:41.979> this

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.100 
haven't seen any other master force this

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:43.500 
haven't seen any other master force this
kind<00:01:42.310> of<00:01:42.340> a<00:01:42.400> new<00:01:42.550> concept<00:01:42.909> that<00:01:43.030> still<00:01:43.240> so<00:01:43.390> is

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:43.510 
kind of a new concept that still so is

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:45.060 
kind of a new concept that still so is
invented<00:01:43.960> and<00:01:44.110> I<00:01:44.170> think<00:01:44.409> it<00:01:44.560> is<00:01:44.680> a<00:01:44.710> really

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.070 
invented and I think it is a really

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.010 
invented and I think it is a really
really<00:01:45.370> useful<00:01:45.820> i<00:01:46.000> dip<00:01:46.240> especially<00:01:46.870> if<00:01:46.930> you're

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 
really useful i dip especially if you're

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:48.630 
really useful i dip especially if you're
not<00:01:47.080> so<00:01:47.320> sure<00:01:47.530> what<00:01:47.560> DPI<00:01:48.100> you<00:01:48.190> are<00:01:48.340> and<00:01:48.460> i<00:01:48.490> want

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 
not so sure what DPI you are and i want

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:49.620 
not so sure what DPI you are and i want
to<00:01:48.700> switch<00:01:48.880> you<00:01:49.000> really<00:01:49.180> quickly<00:01:49.360> depending

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630 
to switch you really quickly depending

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:51.060 
to switch you really quickly depending
on<00:01:49.840> say<00:01:50.020> what<00:01:50.170> gun<00:01:50.380> you're<00:01:50.530> using<00:01:50.710> or<00:01:50.920> how

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.070 
on say what gun you're using or how

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:52.860 
on say what gun you're using or how
you're<00:01:51.190> playing<00:01:51.370> stylers<00:01:51.790> that's<00:01:52.570> a<00:01:52.659> really

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:52.870 
you're playing stylers that's a really

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:54.360 
you're playing stylers that's a really
cool<00:01:53.020> feature<00:01:53.170> the<00:01:53.440> way<00:01:53.530> you<00:01:53.590> do<00:01:53.770> this<00:01:53.920> is<00:01:54.130> it's

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:54.370 
cool feature the way you do this is it's

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:55.860 
cool feature the way you do this is it's
got<00:01:54.490> this<00:01:54.640> nifty<00:01:54.940> little<00:01:55.150> screen<00:01:55.659> on<00:01:55.780> the

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:04.030 
the mouse of a second way you can change
DPI<00:03:01.959> so<00:03:02.959> the<00:03:03.049> mouse<00:03:03.200> has<00:03:03.349> actually<00:03:03.680> got<00:03:03.799> to

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:43.610 
then what I've so i miss the cable the

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:46.149 
then what I've so i miss the cable the
cable<00:04:43.639> is<00:04:44.360> a<00:04:44.419> very<00:04:44.810> nice<00:04:44.990> feature<00:04:45.169> runnings

cable is a very nice feature runnings

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:47.589 
cable is a very nice feature runnings
brighter<00:04:46.400> cables<00:04:46.880> it's<00:04:47.030> kind<00:04:47.150> of<00:04:47.180> a<00:04:47.270> material

00:04:47.589 --> 00:04:47.599 
brighter cables it's kind of a material

00:04:47.599 --> 00:04:49.510 
brighter cables it's kind of a material
cable<00:04:48.080> it<00:04:48.259> feels<00:04:48.620> like<00:04:48.770> a<00:04:48.800> shoelace<00:04:49.070> and<00:04:49.250> so

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:49.520 
cable it feels like a shoelace and so

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:50.439 
cable it feels like a shoelace and so
that's<00:04:49.639> why<00:04:49.729> I<00:04:49.759> describe<00:04:50.120> it<00:04:50.240> it's<00:04:50.330> like<00:04:50.419> a

00:04:50.439 --> 00:04:50.449 
that's why I describe it it's like a

00:04:50.449 --> 00:04:51.940 
that's why I describe it it's like a
firm<00:04:50.750> shoelace<00:04:51.289> and<00:04:51.320> this<00:04:51.650> means<00:04:51.830> it's<00:04:51.919> not

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:51.950 
firm shoelace and this means it's not

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:53.890 
firm shoelace and this means it's not
like<00:04:52.130> you<00:04:52.250> we're<00:04:52.789> all<00:04:52.880> plastic<00:04:53.330> hey<00:04:53.450> we<00:04:53.570> funnel

it's really flexible but such high
quality<00:04:58.780> it<00:04:59.230> doesn't<00:04:59.560> it's<00:04:59.650> not<00:04:59.680> going<00:04:59.980> to

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:00.070 
quality it doesn't it's not going to

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:01.379 
quality it doesn't it's not going to
break<00:05:00.250> or<00:05:00.400> anything<00:05:00.639> I<00:05:00.670> can<00:05:00.820> easily<00:05:01.180> talk

00:05:01.379 --> 00:05:01.389 
break or anything I can easily talk

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:02.700 
break or anything I can easily talk
about<00:05:01.630> and<00:05:02.139> nothing<00:05:02.440> is<00:05:02.500> going<00:05:02.590> to<00:05:02.650> happen

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:02.710 
about and nothing is going to happen

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:04.860 
about and nothing is going to happen
because<00:05:02.980> it<00:05:03.250> says<00:05:03.400> fabric<00:05:03.760> braided<00:05:04.060> cable<00:05:04.360> and

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:04.870 
because it says fabric braided cable and

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:06.270 
because it says fabric braided cable and
that's<00:05:04.990> a<00:05:05.080> 2<00:05:05.260> meter<00:05:05.410> cable<00:05:05.680> you<00:05:05.889> get<00:05:06.040> all<00:05:06.160> this

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:06.280 
that's a 2 meter cable you get all this

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:13.050 
that's a 2 meter cable you get all this
ending<00:05:06.730> in<00:05:06.940> a<00:05:07.090> USB<00:05:07.510> to<00:05:07.690> port<00:05:09.630> we<00:05:10.630> have<00:05:10.870> got<00:05:12.060> 44

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:13.060 
ending in a USB to port we have got 44

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:14.280

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:14.290 
pressure points on the bottom here these

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:15.659 
pressure points on the bottom here these
are<00:05:14.350> the<00:05:14.560> feet<00:05:15.010> that<00:05:15.130> you<00:05:15.220> find<00:05:15.430> these<00:05:15.550> are

00:05:15.659 --> 00:05:15.669 
are the feet that you find these are

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:17.490 
are the feet that you find these are
really<00:05:15.880> nice<00:05:16.030> glide<00:05:16.300> feet<00:05:16.540> but<00:05:16.810> one<00:05:17.080> there<00:05:17.290> to

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:17.500 
really nice glide feet but one there to

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:19.440 
really nice glide feet but one there to
there<00:05:17.650> one<00:05:17.860> up<00:05:17.980> top<00:05:18.160> it's<00:05:18.850> basically<00:05:19.210> me<00:05:19.389> is

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:19.450 
there one up top it's basically me is

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:21.030 
there one up top it's basically me is
going<00:05:19.570> to<00:05:19.630> glide<00:05:19.900> really<00:05:20.500> really<00:05:20.680> nice<00:05:20.770> across

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:21.040 
going to glide really really nice across

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:22.680 
going to glide really really nice across
any<00:05:21.280> mathematically<00:05:21.850> use<00:05:22.180> whether<00:05:22.419> it's<00:05:22.570> a

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:22.690 
any mathematically use whether it's a

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:24.090 
any mathematically use whether it's a
slow<00:05:22.990> one<00:05:23.110> or<00:05:23.290> a<00:05:23.320> fast<00:05:23.530> one<00:05:23.710> it's<00:05:23.860> just<00:05:23.889> going

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:24.100 
slow one or a fast one it's just going

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:27.480 
slow one or a fast one it's just going
to<00:05:24.160> glide<00:05:24.400> really<00:05:25.240> really<00:05:25.780> nicely<00:05:26.400> so<00:05:27.400> it

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:27.490 
to glide really really nicely so it

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:28.650 
to glide really really nicely so it
means<00:05:27.610> there's<00:05:27.760> no<00:05:28.000> friction<00:05:28.240> on<00:05:28.419> there<00:05:28.570> at

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:28.660 
means there's no friction on there at

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:31.080 
means there's no friction on there at
all<00:05:28.870> really<00:05:29.200> the<00:05:29.919> base<00:05:30.100> of<00:05:30.310> it<00:05:30.370> as<00:05:30.520> well<00:05:30.669> as<00:05:30.970> you

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:31.090 
all really the base of it as well as you

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:35.040 
all really the base of it as well as you
can<00:05:31.240> see<00:05:31.360> quite<00:05:32.020> a<00:05:32.169> big<00:05:32.500> mouse<00:05:33.600> for<00:05:34.600> me<00:05:34.810> I

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:35.050 
can see quite a big mouse for me I

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:36.540 
can see quite a big mouse for me I
always<00:05:35.140> thought<00:05:35.710> that<00:05:35.770> I<00:05:35.950> preferred<00:05:36.280> small

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:36.550 
always thought that I preferred small

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:38.490 
always thought that I preferred small
mice<00:05:36.730> because<00:05:36.970> I<00:05:37.180> heard<00:05:37.840> you<00:05:37.930> say<00:05:38.140> before<00:05:38.200> I

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:38.500 
mice because I heard you say before I

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:39.840 
mice because I heard you say before I
can<00:05:38.680> flick<00:05:38.890> them<00:05:39.040> around<00:05:39.190> easily<00:05:39.400> but<00:05:39.669> for

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:39.850 
can flick them around easily but for

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:41.370 
can flick them around easily but for
this<00:05:39.940> one<00:05:40.150> I<00:05:40.330> thought<00:05:40.540> and<00:05:40.840> this<00:05:40.930> is<00:05:41.050> really<00:05:41.200> me

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:43.090 
but I tried it and once I try this grip

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:45.870 
but I tried it and once I try this grip

got the rail your where the finger that
is<00:06:00.760> it's<00:06:01.479> got<00:06:01.720> groove<00:06:01.930> then<00:06:02.229> your<00:06:02.470> little

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:02.710 
is it's got groove then your little

finger has a groove in there as well so
it's<00:06:04.180> just<00:06:04.270> perfectly<00:06:04.990> perfectly<00:06:05.710> molded

00:06:05.969 --> 00:06:05.979 
it's just perfectly perfectly molded

00:06:05.979 --> 00:06:07.770 
it's just perfectly perfectly molded
everything<00:06:06.970> in<00:06:07.120> those<00:06:07.210> exactly<00:06:07.690> right

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:07.780 
everything in those exactly right

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:08.969 
everything in those exactly right
sitting<00:06:08.110> and<00:06:08.229> that<00:06:08.410> means<00:06:08.560> you<00:06:08.620> can<00:06:08.770> get<00:06:08.860> the

00:06:08.969 --> 00:06:08.979 
sitting and that means you can get the

00:06:08.979 --> 00:06:10.590 
sitting and that means you can get the
optimum<00:06:09.370> clicks<00:06:09.610> on<00:06:09.790> everywhere<00:06:10.090> it's

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:10.600 
optimum clicks on everywhere it's

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:12.180 
optimum clicks on everywhere it's
perfectly<00:06:11.140> feels<00:06:11.410> there<00:06:11.620> it's<00:06:11.770> a<00:06:11.830> really

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:12.190 
perfectly feels there it's a really

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:16.020 
perfectly feels there it's a really
precise<00:06:12.700> mouse<00:06:13.030> really<00:06:13.479> great<00:06:14.669> that<00:06:15.669> is<00:06:15.820> about

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:16.030 
precise mouse really great that is about

all I can say apart from this is

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:19.230 
all I can say apart from this is
probably<00:06:17.860> one<00:06:18.130> of<00:06:18.160> the<00:06:18.400> best<00:06:18.729> nights<00:06:18.970> I've

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:19.240 
probably one of the best nights I've

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:21.630 
probably one of the best nights I've
ever<00:06:19.330> used<00:06:19.600> I<00:06:19.810> absolutely<00:06:20.229> recommend<00:06:21.160> it<00:06:21.610> to
