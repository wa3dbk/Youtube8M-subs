00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
I think it's one of my better game place

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.880 
I think it's one of my better game place
because<00:01:38.850> it's<00:01:39.000> more<00:01:39.180> gun<00:01:39.450> kills<00:01:39.720> and<00:01:40.020> I<00:01:40.619> this

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
because it's more gun kills and I this

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.649 
because it's more gun kills and I this
is<00:01:41.250> like<00:01:41.280> I<00:01:41.579> said<00:01:41.759> this<00:01:41.909> was<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.240> first<00:01:42.479> part

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
is like I said this was the first part

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.060 
is like I said this was the first part
of<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:42.869> hundred<00:01:43.110> plus<00:01:43.290> i<00:01:43.530> ended<00:01:43.770> up<00:01:43.829> with<00:01:44.040> only

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
of the hundred plus i ended up with only

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.700 
of the hundred plus i ended up with only
45<00:01:44.909> kills<00:01:45.210> after<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.630> second<00:01:45.960> round<00:01:45.990> so<00:01:46.680> I

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
45 kills after the second round so I

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.069 
45 kills after the second round so I
went<00:01:47.040> and<00:01:47.369> I<00:01:47.490> got<00:01:47.520> 54<00:01:48.210> kills<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:48.600> second<00:01:48.930> round

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
went and I got 54 kills the second round

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.080 
went and I got 54 kills the second round
with<00:01:49.259> these<00:01:49.710> shitty<00:01:49.979> kill<00:01:50.220> streaks<00:01:50.490> and<00:01:50.670> like

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
I said the worship in my opinion it's

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.319 
I said the worship in my opinion it's
not<00:01:52.799> that<00:01:52.950> great<00:01:53.130> they<00:01:53.310> shot<00:01:53.520> it<00:01:53.549> down<00:01:53.790> you

killstreaks already built up ready to

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.010 
killstreaks already built up ready to
call<00:02:34.310> in<00:02:34.550> because<00:02:34.700> this<00:02:35.210> is<00:02:35.360> the<00:02:35.450> easiest<00:02:35.780> time

to<00:02:36.110> call<00:02:36.260> in<00:02:36.350> your<00:02:36.470> air<00:02:37.340> strike<00:02:37.670> and<00:02:37.820> all<00:02:37.910> that

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
to call in your air strike and all that

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:39.490 
to call in your air strike and all that
because<00:02:38.300> they're<00:02:38.570> already<00:02:38.930> in<00:02:39.080> their<00:02:39.200> spawn

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
because they're already in their spawn

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.300 
because they're already in their spawn
so<00:02:40.900> just<00:02:41.900> talk<00:02:42.020> about<00:02:42.170> momentum<00:02:42.560> and<00:02:42.890> you<00:02:43.130> just

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
so just talk about momentum and you just

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:44.650 
so just talk about momentum and you just
need<00:02:43.430> it<00:02:43.610> you<00:02:43.700> need<00:02:43.730> to<00:02:43.880> hold<00:02:44.030> that<00:02:44.210> momentum

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
need it you need to hold that momentum

left don't risk it just play passive and
wait<00:03:01.580> for<00:03:01.730> the<00:03:01.790> next<00:03:02.030> round<00:03:02.180> because<00:03:02.870> that's

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
wait for the next round because that's

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.360 
wait for the next round because that's
where<00:03:03.380> you<00:03:03.470> know<00:03:03.590> the<00:03:03.740> enemy<00:03:03.890> team<00:03:04.190> is<00:03:04.280> going

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
where you know the enemy team is going

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:06.160 
where you know the enemy team is going
to<00:03:04.459> be<00:03:04.580> because<00:03:04.760> they<00:03:05.000> spawn<00:03:05.330> on<00:03:05.570> the<00:03:05.840> opposite

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
to be because they spawn on the opposite

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:08.650 
to be because they spawn on the opposite
side<00:03:06.350> of<00:03:06.380> the<00:03:06.470> map<00:03:06.650> so<00:03:06.970> I<00:03:07.970> just<00:03:08.330> want<00:03:08.510> to<00:03:08.540> talk

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
side of the map so I just want to talk

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.110 
side of the map so I just want to talk
about<00:03:08.780> that<00:03:09.220> also<00:03:10.220> a<00:03:10.370> lot<00:03:10.580> of<00:03:10.670> people<00:03:10.880> say<00:03:11.060> you
