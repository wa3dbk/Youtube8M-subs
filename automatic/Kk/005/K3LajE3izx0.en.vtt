00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:10.700
 with the three printers of a new video 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:14.240
 of this channel this time we have 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:16.309
 tips and tricks of xperia 4 so for 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.140
 always start always show how 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:20.240
 make a screenshot in this 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.369
 case is by pressing the power button and 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.170
 off and the volume button towards 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:26.509
 down at the same time so if you want 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:28.849
 perform the capture the pulses and how 

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:30.919
 You see the capture and you're done 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:33.020
 list in the notification bar for 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:35.390
 that you share, let's see a little bit 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.160
 about the launcher that you have as you see 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.800
 has a side menu here so that 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.630
 You can order by own order or 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.700
 also in alphabetical order so for 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:46.610
 example in the proper order you can 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:48.890
 put for example telegram that you want 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:51.890
 that is a little bit earlier on your list 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:54.020
 applications you simply put it by 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:57.440
 here and even here already create a folder 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:59.480
 let's just put it here and 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.010
 ready and we go to the side menu and we're going to 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.230
 put for example to put it in order 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.420
 Alphabetical and as you see automatically 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:08.270
 they change orders also from here 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:11.120
 we can uninstall it or also put it 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:13.610
 which is to show the most used to the 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:15.620
 start and those that least use the 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.750
 at the end so it's also a way 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:20.630
 convenient to order applications 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.520
 now we go to adjustments and here in the 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:25.550
 screen settings you will see that 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.800
 we can have white balance in this 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:30.100
 in this case we can put the screen 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:32.810
 a little more red more green more blue 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:35.540
 Depending on how well we like 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.490
 which is a good use since we can 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:39.380
 customize more and the way in the 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.820
 which will show us the screen and 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.550
 let's go here to personalization let's 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:45.260
 find some topics that already come in 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.360
 the device and we can also 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:49.220
 download some other themes you see 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.770
 here it says that we touch to add more 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.450
 issues and will send us as to the 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.280
 theme store and you can also 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:59.120
 download some others from plays thor 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:01.460
 for example let's apply this purple 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:04.190
 and in some subjects only the 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.380
 background and some colors but in others 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:07.940
 topics you can even change the keypad 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.940
 and as you see here the background has already 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:12.800
 purple and some other shades here from 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.600
 the accents of the colors are 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.030
 also in purple we go again to 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:19.100
 adjustments and something basic that you should know 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.810
 in all they are and is the stamina mode that 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.340
 will help you save a lot of battery 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:24.620
 that you put here in administration of 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:27.320
 battery and as you see right now he says that 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.640
 three days and three hours of battery left 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.650
 The truth is that if it lasts a lot 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.140
 the battery and it turns on is the mode 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.850
 stamina is going to block some functions 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:36.770
 of the cell phone and as you see now it says that 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:38.840
 there would be ten days and two hours 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:40.880
 obviously in standby mode is to say 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.950
 with the screen off and without using it and 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.350
 also now brings in ultra mode this 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:48.380
 mine that is more or less like the ultra 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:51.080
 power saving galaxy models so like 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:53.900
 you see when you are active you will see that 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.640
 it takes while it's being activated we're going to 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.069
 wait a little bit more 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:00.830
 because here he will reduce to the maximum the 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:02.780
 functions to the minimum it would be going to leave with 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:06.230
 the basic functions only to 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:08.240
 device to save battery everything 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:10.220
 that can be so as you see change there 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:12.650
 the background to black and white and now 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.870
 it only lets us enter the telephone 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:16.970
 messaging contacts and what's interesting is 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:18.740
 that if he keeps letting us enter the camera 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:20.270
 I guess as long as you have enough 

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:22.790
 battery will keep letting you enter the 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:25.190
 camera to the gallery calendar and other 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:27.590
 things but you can not add your own 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:30.620
 applications let's say so that's a 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:32.840
 little the weak point because you can not 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.880
 add some applications yourself 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:37.340
 that you want to this list we are going to 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:39.500
 close this mode in this way and you 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:41.570
 we put off 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:44.630
 even when you turn off ultra mode this 

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:46.580
 Mine restarts the cell phone alone to 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:48.800
 Reload processes that come 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:50.630
 from the start so we're going to 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.890
 wait for it to restart and good 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:53.150
 now that advantage is lit 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:55.340
 on the lock screen to show 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:56.810
 the last tip that is to start the camera 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:58.670
 from here from the lock screen 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:01.790
 you just have to slide the camera 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:04.459
 up and automatically it's going to 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:06.709
 opening will take a few seconds and 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:08.810
 then it opens up so there it is 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:11.150
 list already the camera as you see brings some 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:12.709
 added by that part of me 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:14.420
 forgot to mention this let's irak to 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:16.640
 the multitasking as you see also here 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:19.489
 brings mini applications as a 

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:22.340
 stopwatch and more things so let's 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:23.720
 put him for example this we start and 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:25.910
 it says stopwatch but it's actually 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.380
 timer here we have some other 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:29.270
 as a web browser 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:31.340
 in short mini applications that you can use 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:33.680
 since it's a 5-inch screen and 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:35.720
 You have enough space to use 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.160
 more applications also here for 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.260
 Take a screenshot of 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:40.910
 form let's say you do not have to 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.890
 press these buttons as we saw the 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:45.140
 start simply click here and you 

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:45.770
 It captures the screen and also shows you 

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:48.280
 a panel 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:51.080
 edit where you can make annotations 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:53.509
 cut out and more things you see here we're going to 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:55.639
 paint a little bit about the image and here 

00:04:53.509 --> 00:04:58.400
 we are painting here you can select 

00:04:55.639 --> 00:05:00.680
 the color and all these these parameters 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:03.110
 in the type of brush the text color 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:05.539
 stickers in short has a pretty editor 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:07.310
 powerful and that now has been everything with 

00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:08.870
 regarding this cell phone I hope that you 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:10.930
 have liked the video and see you the 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:10.930
 next
