 when it's done it's all total enchastre 

00:00:10.379 --> 00:00:17.490
 this is done all by quantity of pieces 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:26.820
 hundreds of pieces things 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:29.849
 with this product color does not put the 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.769
 catalyst that hardens the resin that 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:35.070
 molds are emptied 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:37.260
 also it does so has one of the 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.980
 stages is that you have to mark them champs 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:44.040
 it is marked but you have to drill the 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:46.470
 because they are drilled they come out with these 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:50.370
 marks makes a sunthread and with 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:52.200
 the machines carries a rod and in 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.060
 these rods that enter from to 6 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:59.070
 units because the high machines 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:01:03.510
 empty is not only one of the most 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:06.210
 large doors six units takes 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:10.249
 baked and comes out with esteban and the pieces 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:13.170
 with two originals so individual and 

00:01:10.249 --> 00:01:15.030
 after the individual goes 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.350
 do the necks that this is one of the 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.350
 ears of the big cup 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:29.300
 with bathroom and without bathroom 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:32.050
 Well I girls then caffeine 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:35.920
 for in the director of are the chicks 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:39.710
 of the small glass the armed very easy not 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:41.690
 it has tried to make this the pieces 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.700
 that they are all the same so that the 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:46.159
 armed that we grab this and another 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:49.810
 anyone can find that is 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:49.810
 the glass perfectly armed 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:57.910
 the base is 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.790
 yes 

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:28.189
 with many years 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.390
 everything dominated is worked 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:46.620
 this one knows broke if it's a new better 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:49.769
 in this time it is in all groups if 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:52.110
 all that is the subject of the resin of 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:55.110
 why the whole process is the 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:57.390
 Resin work is passed to a wash 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:00.659
 that to get all kinds of oil is 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:02.220
 that can have hands because the greasiness 

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:05.090
 because when you do the metal bath 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:07.079
 you do not have to have anything that is 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:08.120
 plaintiff so that it sinaloa home to 

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:10.519
 bathroom 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.819
 for example when there is a cup that 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:14.909
 have 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:17.340
 a little bit of wax or something comes out with certain 

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:19.260
 details this is sorted and I 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.209
 of course they do not go to the window 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:25.519
 so you do a very high process 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:25.519
 of working with the family and then for
