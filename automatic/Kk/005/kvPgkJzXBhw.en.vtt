JC's been peeling off a lot of flops

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:43.630 
JC's been peeling off a lot of flops
like<00:00:30.779> from<00:00:31.019> the<00:00:31.080> big<00:00:31.260> blind<00:00:31.560> is<00:00:31.800> this<00:00:32.279> trap

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:43.640 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.979 

decided<00:00:44.640> because<00:00:45.360> it<00:00:45.480> couldn't<00:00:45.660> get<00:00:45.780> called

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
decided because it couldn't get called

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.110 
decided because it couldn't get called
by<00:00:46.170> hand<00:00:46.410> that<00:00:46.620> I<00:00:47.010> think<00:00:47.640> he<00:00:47.730> has<00:00:47.850> too<00:00:48.000> many

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
by hand that I think he has too many

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.340 
by hand that I think he has too many
chips<00:00:48.390> to<00:00:48.539> shove<00:00:48.719> okay<00:00:50.390> and<00:00:51.390> if<00:00:51.600> you<00:00:51.719> raises<00:00:52.289> it

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
chips to shove okay and if you raises it

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:53.569 
chips to shove okay and if you raises it
and<00:00:52.440> gets<00:00:52.559> shoved<00:00:52.770> in<00:00:52.949> he<00:00:53.160> doesn't<00:00:53.399> know<00:00:53.460> what

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
and gets shoved in he doesn't know what

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.389 
and gets shoved in he doesn't know what
to<00:00:53.610> do<00:00:54.289> so<00:00:55.289> you<00:00:55.350> know<00:00:55.649> calling<00:00:56.070> it's<00:00:56.190> really

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
to do so you know calling it's really

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.700 
to do so you know calling it's really
it's<00:00:56.520> only<00:00:56.610> option<00:00:57.090> you<00:00:57.260> mean<00:00:58.260> Tom<00:00:58.440> made<00:00:58.649> a
