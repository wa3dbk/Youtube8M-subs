blackberry tour and I'd like to do some

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.970 
blackberry tour and I'd like to do some
comparisons<00:00:13.530> to<00:00:14.030> start<00:00:15.030> the<00:00:15.960> tour<00:00:16.260> is<00:00:16.470> a<00:00:16.529> bit

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
comparisons to start the tour is a bit

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.580 
comparisons to start the tour is a bit
bigger<00:00:17.220> than<00:00:17.460> the<00:00:17.520> curve<00:00:18.170> but<00:00:19.170> if<00:00:19.289> you<00:00:19.380> take<00:00:19.529> a

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
bigger than the curve but if you take a

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.240 
bigger than the curve but if you take a
look<00:00:20.000> definitely<00:00:21.000> thinner<00:00:21.949> the<00:00:22.949> tour

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
look definitely thinner the tour

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.910 
look definitely thinner the tour
keyboard<00:00:23.730> is<00:00:23.910> bigger<00:00:24.230> but<00:00:25.230> the<00:00:25.410> buttons<00:00:25.769> on

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
keyboard is bigger but the buttons on

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.920 
keyboard is bigger but the buttons on
the<00:00:26.010> keypad<00:00:26.430> are<00:00:26.939> a<00:00:27.060> bit<00:00:27.300> more<00:00:27.449> difficult<00:00:27.630> to

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
the keypad are a bit more difficult to

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.009 
the keypad are a bit more difficult to
handle<00:00:28.760> if<00:00:29.760> you<00:00:30.330> look<00:00:30.449> right<00:00:30.630> here<00:00:30.689> at<00:00:30.929> the

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
handle if you look right here at the

are<00:00:41.460> bigger<00:00:41.730> than<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:42.059> curve<00:00:42.270> and<00:00:42.480> much<00:00:43.260> more

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
are bigger than the curve and much more

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.979 
are bigger than the curve and much more
comfortable<00:00:44.040> I'd<00:00:44.190> have<00:00:44.340> to<00:00:44.460> say<00:00:44.809> I've<00:00:45.809> been

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
comfortable I'd have to say I've been

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.720 
comfortable I'd have to say I've been
using<00:00:46.140> in<00:00:46.379> a<00:00:46.440> couple<00:00:46.710> of<00:00:46.770> days<00:00:46.829> and<00:00:47.190> I<00:00:47.399> can<00:00:47.579> tell

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
using in a couple of days and I can tell

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.330 
using in a couple of days and I can tell
you<00:00:47.789> that<00:00:48.000> it<00:00:48.059> really<00:00:48.390> is<00:00:48.629> much<00:00:48.899> faster

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:49.340 
you that it really is much faster

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:51.979 
you that it really is much faster
whether<00:00:50.340> it's<00:00:50.610> internet<00:00:51.000> or<00:00:51.270> just<00:00:51.629> general

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
whether it's internet or just general

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.810 
whether it's internet or just general
usage<00:00:52.350> like<00:00:52.710> when<00:00:52.860> I<00:00:52.890> want<00:00:53.100> to<00:00:53.190> delete<00:00:53.399> emails

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
usage like when I want to delete emails

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.240 
usage like when I want to delete emails
in<00:00:53.969> bulk<00:00:54.180> I'd<00:00:54.899> say<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.289> tour<00:00:55.559> definitely<00:00:56.070> wins

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
in bulk I'd say the tour definitely wins

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.810 
in bulk I'd say the tour definitely wins
on<00:00:56.430> this<00:00:56.550> one<00:00:58.070> very<00:00:59.070> easy<00:00:59.340> to<00:00:59.489> remove<00:00:59.699> the

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
on this one very easy to remove the

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.160 
on this one very easy to remove the
battery<00:01:00.090> door<00:01:02.449> and<00:01:03.449> what's<00:01:03.629> great<00:01:03.780> is<00:01:04.140> that

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
battery door and what's great is that

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.899 
battery door and what's great is that
you<00:01:04.530> don't<00:01:04.650> have<00:01:04.769> to<00:01:04.979> remove<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.280> battery<00:01:05.640> in

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
you don't have to remove the battery in

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.820 
you don't have to remove the battery in
order<00:01:06.299> to<00:01:06.420> remove<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:06.840> SD<00:01:06.930> card<00:01:07.140> which<00:01:07.799> you

order to remove the SD card which you

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.039 
order to remove the SD card which you
couldn't<00:01:08.250> do<00:01:08.400> by<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:08.610> curve<00:01:08.909> but<00:01:09.750> here's<00:01:09.960> the

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
couldn't do by the curve but here's the

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.469 
couldn't do by the curve but here's the
drawback<00:01:10.500> you<00:01:11.369> need<00:01:11.610> to<00:01:11.700> remove<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.119> battery

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
drawback you need to remove the battery

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.060 
drawback you need to remove the battery
to<00:01:12.810> remove<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.200> SIM<00:01:13.380> card<00:01:14.570> so<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.900> 3.2<00:01:16.560> camera

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
to remove the SIM card so the 3.2 camera

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.249 
to remove the SIM card so the 3.2 camera
is<00:01:17.130> excellent<00:01:17.880> and<00:01:18.119> I<00:01:18.420> got<00:01:18.600> some<00:01:18.810> really<00:01:19.020> great

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
is excellent and I got some really great

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.570 
is excellent and I got some really great
pictures<00:01:19.590> much<00:01:20.460> better<00:01:20.729> than<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:21.030> curve<00:01:22.580> so

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
pictures much better than the curve so

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.030 
pictures much better than the curve so
what<00:01:23.759> don't<00:01:23.970> I<00:01:24.060> like<00:01:24.240> about<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.570> tour<00:01:25.040> this

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
what don't I like about the tour this

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.550 
what don't I like about the tour this
phone<00:01:26.400> gets<00:01:26.640> really<00:01:27.090> warm<00:01:27.330> and<00:01:27.600> I<00:01:28.170> keep<00:01:28.350> having

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
phone gets really warm and I keep having

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.910 
phone gets really warm and I keep having
to<00:01:28.770> change<00:01:29.009> my<00:01:29.189> battery<00:01:29.549> it<00:01:29.850> goes<00:01:30.180> really<00:01:30.479> fast

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
to change my battery it goes really fast

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.410 
to change my battery it goes really fast
it<00:01:31.920> also<00:01:32.130> probably<00:01:32.520> takes<00:01:32.700> double<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.299> amount

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
it also probably takes double the amount

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.859 
it also probably takes double the amount
of<00:01:33.720> time<00:01:33.900> to<00:01:34.110> turn<00:01:34.290> on<00:01:35.360> now<00:01:36.360> something<00:01:36.630> that's

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
of time to turn on now something that's

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.469 
of time to turn on now something that's
really<00:01:37.320> annoying<00:01:37.560> is<00:01:37.890> that<00:01:37.950> when<00:01:38.700> I<00:01:38.729> charge<00:01:39.150> my

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
really annoying is that when I charge my

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.149 
really annoying is that when I charge my
curve<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:40.320> cable<00:01:40.710> was<00:01:40.799> in<00:01:40.950> pretty

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
curve the cable was in pretty

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.859 
curve the cable was in pretty
comfortable<00:01:41.640> place<00:01:41.880> that<00:01:42.240> I<00:01:42.270> was<00:01:42.450> still<00:01:42.689> able

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
comfortable place that I was still able

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.350 
comfortable place that I was still able
to<00:01:43.049> use<00:01:43.290> the<00:01:43.500> phone<00:01:43.759> but<00:01:44.759> take<00:01:44.939> a<00:01:44.970> look<00:01:45.090> at<00:01:45.299> the

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
to use the phone but take a look at the

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.310 
to use the phone but take a look at the
tour<00:01:46.700> blackberry<00:01:47.700> put<00:01:48.299> the<00:01:48.420> charging<00:01:48.869> port<00:01:49.049> in

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
tour blackberry put the charging port in

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.410 
tour blackberry put the charging port in
a<00:01:49.470> pretty<00:01:49.740> bad<00:01:49.950> place<00:01:50.250> especially<00:01:51.149> for<00:01:51.299> people

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
a pretty bad place especially for people

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.660 
a pretty bad place especially for people
who<00:01:51.630> are<00:01:51.750> right-handed<00:01:52.320> so<00:01:53.220> watch<00:01:53.430> out<00:01:53.610> for

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
who are right-handed so watch out for

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.340 
who are right-handed so watch out for
that<00:01:53.880> it<00:01:54.329> could<00:01:54.540> take<00:01:54.689> some<00:01:54.840> time<00:01:54.899> to<00:01:55.200> get<00:01:55.290> used

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
that it could take some time to get used

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.880 
that it could take some time to get used
to<00:01:56.180> so<00:01:57.180> to<00:01:57.240> sum<00:01:57.479> it<00:01:57.509> up<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:58.320> tour<00:01:58.560> is<00:01:58.649> pretty

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
to so to sum it up the tour is pretty

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.459
