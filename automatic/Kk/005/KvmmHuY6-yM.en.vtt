lashes<00:02:37.420> actually<00:02:38.420> got<00:02:38.630> longer<00:02:38.870> within<00:02:39.230> 30

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
lashes actually got longer within 30

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.320 
lashes actually got longer within 30
days<00:02:39.710> now<00:02:40.460> the<00:02:40.520> reason<00:02:40.850> for<00:02:40.880> that<00:02:41.030> is<00:02:41.300> because

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330 
days now the reason for that is because

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.140 
days now the reason for that is because
this<00:02:41.780> mascara<00:02:42.140> here<00:02:42.470> says<00:02:42.800> that<00:02:43.220> your<00:02:43.700> lashes

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
this mascara here says that your lashes

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.440 
this mascara here says that your lashes
appear<00:02:44.570> up<00:02:44.780> to<00:02:45.070> 117<00:02:46.070> times<00:02:46.370> longer<00:02:46.880> in<00:02:47.030> 30<00:02:47.270> days

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
appear up to 117 times longer in 30 days

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.720 
appear up to 117 times longer in 30 days
and<00:02:47.810> then<00:02:48.350> it<00:02:48.470> also<00:02:48.620> says<00:02:48.800> that<00:02:49.040> the<00:02:49.340> lashes

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
and then it also says that the lashes

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.560 
and then it also says that the lashes
appear<00:02:50.030> up<00:02:50.210> to<00:02:50.360> 80%<00:02:50.630> longer<00:02:51.260> instantly<00:02:51.890> I

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:52.570 
appear up to 80% longer instantly I

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:56.830 
appear up to 80% longer instantly I
guess<00:02:53.570> it<00:02:53.720> has<00:02:53.930> a<00:02:54.580> grow<00:02:55.580> lash<00:02:55.910> complex<00:02:56.570> in<00:02:56.720> it

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
guess it has a grow lash complex in it

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.449 
guess it has a grow lash complex in it
that<00:02:57.350> is<00:02:57.470> supposed<00:02:57.709> to<00:02:57.770> help<00:02:57.980> your<00:02:58.070> lashes

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
that is supposed to help your lashes

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:00.430 
that is supposed to help your lashes
grow<00:02:58.640> and<00:02:58.940> that's<00:02:59.090> why<00:02:59.300> it<00:02:59.450> says<00:02:59.690> that<00:02:59.720> they're

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
grow and that's why it says that they're

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.480 
grow and that's why it says that they're
gonna<00:03:00.560> grow<00:03:01.000> 117<00:03:02.000> times<00:03:02.270> longer<00:03:02.540> in<00:03:02.870> 30<00:03:03.080> days

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:03.490 
gonna grow 117 times longer in 30 days

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:05.590 
gonna grow 117 times longer in 30 days

and<00:04:15.629> slender<00:04:16.049> I<00:04:16.590> like<00:04:17.130> the<00:04:17.310> smaller<00:04:17.579> brushes<00:04:18.030> I

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:18.269 
and slender I like the smaller brushes I

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:20.330 
and slender I like the smaller brushes I
don't<00:04:18.449> like<00:04:18.630> the<00:04:18.780> big<00:04:18.930> bulky<00:04:19.290> brushes<00:04:19.709> I<00:04:19.979> know

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
don't like the big bulky brushes I know

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.850 
don't like the big bulky brushes I know
some<00:04:20.609> some<00:04:20.940> of<00:04:21.060> you<00:04:21.150> guys<00:04:21.329> do<00:04:21.720> but<00:04:22.350> that's<00:04:22.680> just

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
some some of you guys do but that's just

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:26.840 
some some of you guys do but that's just
not<00:04:22.979> my<00:04:23.100> preference<00:04:23.990> so<00:04:25.220> as<00:04:26.220> far<00:04:26.400> as<00:04:26.460> the

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:26.850 
not my preference so as far as the

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:29.570 
not my preference so as far as the
mascara<00:04:27.389> making<00:04:27.720> your<00:04:27.960> lashes<00:04:28.710> eighty

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
mascara making your lashes eighty

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.090 
mascara making your lashes eighty
percent<00:04:30.000> longer<00:04:30.270> instantly<00:04:30.870> it<00:04:31.680> does<00:04:31.889> make

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:32.100 
percent longer instantly it does make

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:35.600 
percent longer instantly it does make
them<00:04:32.370> longer<00:04:33.300> and<00:04:33.419> more<00:04:33.810> lengthy<00:04:34.610> instantly

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
them longer and more lengthy instantly

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:37.370 
them longer and more lengthy instantly
but<00:04:35.880> I<00:04:35.940> wouldn't<00:04:36.270> say<00:04:36.389> eighty<00:04:36.660> percent<00:04:37.110> I

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:37.380 
but I wouldn't say eighty percent I

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:40.610 
but I wouldn't say eighty percent I
think<00:04:38.310> that's<00:04:38.490> a<00:04:38.580> little<00:04:39.229> far<00:04:40.229> out<00:04:40.260> there

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:40.620 
think that's a little far out there

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:42.439 
think that's a little far out there
eighty<00:04:40.979> percent<00:04:41.070> that's<00:04:41.910> kind<00:04:42.150> of<00:04:42.180> a<00:04:42.270> lot<00:04:42.389> but

00:04:42.439 --> 00:04:42.449 
eighty percent that's kind of a lot but

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:44.540 
eighty percent that's kind of a lot but
it<00:04:43.169> did<00:04:43.350> make<00:04:43.500> them<00:04:43.620> up<00:04:43.770> here<00:04:43.919> longer<00:04:44.370> in

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:44.550 
it did make them up here longer in

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:46.520 
it did make them up here longer in
lengthier<00:04:45.180> so<00:04:45.690> that's<00:04:45.960> one<00:04:46.199> thing<00:04:46.350> that<00:04:46.380> I

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:46.530 
lengthier so that's one thing that I

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:49.159 
lengthier so that's one thing that I
loved<00:04:46.770> about<00:04:46.860> it<00:04:47.150> and<00:04:48.150> then<00:04:48.330> as<00:04:48.449> far<00:04:48.630> as<00:04:48.690> the

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:49.169 
loved about it and then as far as the

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:51.529 
loved about it and then as far as the
one<00:04:49.680> hundred<00:04:49.919> seventeen<00:04:50.370> percent<00:04:50.850> longer<00:04:51.389> in

00:04:51.529 --> 00:04:51.539 
one hundred seventeen percent longer in

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:53.450 
one hundred seventeen percent longer in
30<00:04:51.840> days<00:04:52.080> well<00:04:52.680> I<00:04:52.710> think<00:04:52.860> that's<00:04:53.130> totally

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:53.460 
30 days well I think that's totally

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:54.920 
30 days well I think that's totally
far-fetched<00:04:53.910> because<00:04:54.300> that<00:04:54.600> means<00:04:54.750> your

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:54.930 
far-fetched because that means your

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:57.710 
far-fetched because that means your
eyelashes<00:04:55.440> would<00:04:55.650> be<00:04:55.830> a<00:04:56.250> little<00:04:57.030> more<00:04:57.210> than

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:57.720 
eyelashes would be a little more than

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:00.050 
eyelashes would be a little more than
double<00:04:58.110> the<00:04:58.590> length<00:04:58.770> than<00:04:59.310> they<00:04:59.490> initially

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:00.060 
double the length than they initially

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:03.200 
double the length than they initially
are<00:05:00.320> so<00:05:01.320> I<00:05:01.680> don't<00:05:02.100> think<00:05:02.310> that<00:05:02.669> it<00:05:02.850> made<00:05:03.060> my

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:03.210 
are so I don't think that it made my

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:05.629 
are so I don't think that it made my
lashes<00:05:03.620> any<00:05:04.620> longer<00:05:05.070> than<00:05:05.310> they<00:05:05.430> initially

00:05:05.629 --> 00:05:05.639 
lashes any longer than they initially

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:07.580 
lashes any longer than they initially
were<00:05:05.880> after<00:05:06.450> using<00:05:06.630> it<00:05:06.840> for<00:05:06.900> a<00:05:07.110> little<00:05:07.289> over

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:07.590 
were after using it for a little over

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:10.339 
were after using it for a little over
two<00:05:07.830> months<00:05:08.300> I<00:05:09.300> don't<00:05:09.510> know<00:05:09.690> if<00:05:09.780> anybody<00:05:10.169> else

00:05:10.339 --> 00:05:10.349 
two months I don't know if anybody else

00:05:10.349 --> 00:05:12.560 
two months I don't know if anybody else
you<00:05:11.220> know<00:05:11.250> if<00:05:11.729> that<00:05:11.970> was<00:05:12.060> the<00:05:12.180> same<00:05:12.360> case<00:05:12.539> for

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:12.570 
you know if that was the same case for

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:15.560 
you know if that was the same case for
them<00:05:12.870> or<00:05:13.289> if<00:05:13.770> maybe<00:05:14.370> they<00:05:14.550> did<00:05:14.729> see<00:05:14.970> a

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:15.570 
them or if maybe they did see a

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:17.300 
them or if maybe they did see a
difference<00:05:16.169> in<00:05:16.260> their<00:05:16.410> length<00:05:17.010> of<00:05:17.190> their

difference in their length of their

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:19.339 
difference in their length of their
lashes<00:05:17.460> excused<00:05:18.330> it<00:05:18.539> and<00:05:18.780> you<00:05:18.840> did<00:05:19.020> notice

lashes excused it and you did notice
some<00:05:19.830> difference<00:05:20.370> in<00:05:20.520> the<00:05:20.639> length<00:05:20.789> of<00:05:20.940> your

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:21.030 
some difference in the length of your

some difference in the length of your
gnash<00:05:21.240> in<00:05:21.720> your<00:05:21.960> lashes<00:05:22.110> after<00:05:22.620> using<00:05:22.800> it<00:05:22.979> for
