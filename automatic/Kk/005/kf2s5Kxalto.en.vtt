00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:09.000
 yes, the famous soissons is morally 

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:11.940
 and mentally that's for sure 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.620
 win these matches that on after we are 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.690
 quite lucid and aware of the fact 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.010
 that it is very different to the plateau 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.170
 and at the game compressions is not the 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.970
 even the arbitration either to be 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.740
 to incite tension while it has nothing to 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.740
 see the top 14 but that's one of 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.740
 macros we set up between game 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:30.600
 offensively defensively 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:32.489
 So yes it matches is the 

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.469
 revealing so that we can already see the 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.510
 four forms he prepared was good 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:40.879
 and then that allows me to 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.879
 reassure to lay the foundations of the season 

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:49.440
 yeah it seems to me after that it's always 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:50.940
 a step back for that but it's true 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.360
 that I have the impression is that the density 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.280
 increases every year the game it's a 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.050
 thing 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.700
 mediately at the new affluence 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.220
 in the stadiums at the level of importance 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:05.480
 that it takes the fact that the players 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:08.780
 are humans on the planet what so 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:11.730
 tribunes but to 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:14.460
 but that's going to change the very 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:16.950
 attractive therefore necessarily the new 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.479
 increased in any case there the pressure 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:22.410
 attention around the championship yes 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:24.240
 it's clearly it's increasing on the 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:26.940
 game such audience and evolution 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.860
 logic it ramps up its language 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.960
 of course, the intensity of 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.160
 infections increases a little bit but 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.160
 good it's not done without light 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:41.640
 clearly 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:44.100
 that's a thing but as the answer is 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.370
 in the question is that you're not 14 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.350
 but there are 11 11 teams that are 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:52.710
 treated army for to fight for 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:55.200
 his place there so there during the years for 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.210
 do it as well as others 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.410
 teams so after that is the 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.440
 championship starts and we are looking forward to 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:03.840
 see precisely the first third of 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.760
 championship the first nine matches 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:10.020
 see how that places precisely the 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:11.459
 direct competitors it's talent 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.110
 behind everyone has grown 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:16.700
 everyone is ready the grouping 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:22.340
 everywhere so rowing has the weapons to 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:22.340
 to fight in these places but also 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:29.690
 Yes this 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:32.390
 that is, it's still 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:34.310
 our nuclear load has finished it's 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:37.489
 as a victory largely ahead of them 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.780
 were visited promoted I think I pass 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:39.640
 as so pretty from the farm pts and even 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.510
 more 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.560
 so it's still a strong team 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.569
 was not unique and there by chance 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.090
 very good from there they beat 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:48.590
 montferrand the friendlies it's 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.450
 not nothing either even though it's that the 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.980
 friendly matches and sign they 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:55.069
 fished dynamically so she's the one who 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:57.050
 promoted cause have delayed times 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:58.310
 run out of steam at the same season which 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:01.730
 do not necessarily have the depth of 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:04.280
 the actual size that can actually 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:06.980
 go back both have grown but 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.900
 this is a group that is 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.180
 knows who lives on on an adventure and 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:14.330
 last and who will come here to get 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:15.769
 beat that for sure it's not the 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:17.030
 dead ends these teams there people to 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:18.769
 from engines ferries and quads 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.700
 the first game in the month of August I 'm 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:23.260
 not worried there will be their best 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.260
 team with intentions that must
