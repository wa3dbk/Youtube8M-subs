 I can control 

00:02:39.619 --> 00:02:42.869
 the propeller here so I have comment 

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:46.509
 what would be the 

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:48.819
 offer even here for example 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:52.689
 that in general in the protour one sees helpless it on the screen one of the 

00:02:52.689 --> 00:02:56.239
 discover and leave out applications in versions and tools 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:57.119
 surgical 

00:02:57.119 --> 00:03:00.499
 is the possibility of granting sonarities

 in this movie 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.179
 in the semifinal 

00:03:17.179 --> 00:03:18.589
 now that you

 in floor 

00:03:24.399 --> 00:03:25.629
 run 

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:29.249
 technology can not translate this is one of the moments of 

00:03:29.249 --> 00:03:30.340
 greater heat 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:36.150
 but it does not seem to me very important to chrysler the house which is the technology for 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.989
 come back soon for more what was an older thing that was the way 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:44.340

 I listen to you recorded with applications so that it can be a kind of 

00:04:13.149 --> 00:04:14.569
 consolation that fans 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:17.779

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:23.570
 then at the end of the tour on Tuesday the moral order suggested in the interview 

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:26.749
