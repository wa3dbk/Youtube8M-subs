00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
all right so I actually just completely

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.100 
all right so I actually just completely
came<00:02:17.580> across<00:02:17.850> this<00:02:18.240> thing<00:02:18.540> I<00:02:18.690> mean<00:02:18.870> I've

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
came across this thing I mean I've

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:20.450 
came across this thing I mean I've
skated<00:02:19.380> this<00:02:19.560> before<00:02:19.860> and<00:02:19.950> I've<00:02:20.040> seen<00:02:20.250> people

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.460 
skated this before and I've seen people

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.130 
skated this before and I've seen people
skate<00:02:20.640> it<00:02:20.730> but<00:02:20.880> just<00:02:21.270> finding<00:02:21.690> it<00:02:21.780> right<00:02:21.900> there

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
skate it but just finding it right there

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.010 
skate it but just finding it right there
that<00:02:22.350> was<00:02:22.440> actually<00:02:22.770> quite<00:02:23.370> fast<00:02:23.780> so<00:02:24.780> as<00:02:24.930> we

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
that was actually quite fast so as we

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:26.300 
that was actually quite fast so as we
can<00:02:25.110> see<00:02:25.170> the<00:02:25.350> spot<00:02:25.560> right<00:02:25.680> now<00:02:25.830> again<00:02:26.130> it's

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
can see the spot right now again it's

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.460 
can see the spot right now again it's
pretty<00:02:26.460> similar<00:02:26.820> but<00:02:27.060> to<00:02:27.690> the<00:02:27.810> previous<00:02:28.260> spots

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
pretty similar but to the previous spots

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:29.960 
pretty similar but to the previous spots
but<00:02:28.770> this<00:02:28.980> one<00:02:29.160> just<00:02:29.190> kind<00:02:29.550> of<00:02:29.580> looks<00:02:29.820> a<00:02:29.880> little

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
but this one just kind of looks a little

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.130 
but this one just kind of looks a little
bit<00:02:30.150> more<00:02:30.240> coolants

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
bit more coolants

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.470 
bit more coolants
liz<00:02:31.680> is<00:02:31.710> definitely<00:02:32.190> a<00:02:32.460> lot<00:02:32.760> smaller<00:02:33.240> of<00:02:33.420> a

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
liz is definitely a lot smaller of a

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.300 
liz is definitely a lot smaller of a

like that so again these are it's some

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.920 
like that so again these are it's some
pretty<00:02:49.470> basic<00:02:49.760> spots<00:02:50.760> I<00:02:51.090> mean<00:02:51.270> I<00:02:51.510> don't<00:02:51.840> know

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
pretty basic spots I mean I don't know

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.240 
pretty basic spots I mean I don't know
if<00:02:51.990> you'd<00:02:52.110> call<00:02:52.260> these<00:02:52.410> mani<00:02:52.620> pads<00:02:52.950> but<00:02:53.190> I

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
if you'd call these mani pads but I

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.930 
if you'd call these mani pads but I
think<00:02:53.460> I'm<00:02:53.520> going<00:02:53.670> to

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
think I'm going to

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.490 
think I'm going to
I'll<00:02:54.210> probably<00:02:54.330> call<00:02:54.570> them<00:02:54.630> lo<00:02:54.810> mani<00:02:55.020> pads<00:02:55.320> or

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
I'll probably call them lo mani pads or

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.470 
I'll probably call them lo mani pads or
something<00:02:55.770> like<00:02:55.860> that<00:02:55.920> I<00:02:56.670> don't<00:02:57.120> know<00:02:57.330> they're

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
something like that I don't know they're

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.030 
something like that I don't know they're
fun<00:02:57.720> and<00:02:57.990> definitely<00:02:58.470> if<00:02:58.740> you're<00:02:58.860> not<00:02:59.010> a

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
fun and definitely if you're not a

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.620 
fun and definitely if you're not a
realistic<00:02:59.460> skater<00:02:59.700> though<00:02:59.850> this<00:03:00.030> probably

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
realistic skater though this probably

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.030 
realistic skater though this probably
would<00:03:00.780> seems<00:03:00.960> like<00:03:01.170> the<00:03:01.440> most<00:03:01.590> boring<00:03:01.770> episode

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
would seems like the most boring episode

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.200 
would seems like the most boring episode
in<00:03:02.370> the<00:03:02.460> world<00:03:02.610> but<00:03:02.790> if<00:03:02.850> you're<00:03:02.940> realistic

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:03.210 
in the world but if you're realistic

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:05.540 
in the world but if you're realistic
this<00:03:03.540> is<00:03:03.630> actually<00:03:03.960> really<00:03:04.530> fun<00:03:04.860> trust<00:03:05.430> me

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
this is actually really fun trust me

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:06.710 
this is actually really fun trust me
