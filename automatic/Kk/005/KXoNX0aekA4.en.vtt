different<00:02:30.920> so<00:02:31.040> you<00:02:31.100> need<00:02:31.310> to<00:02:31.400> check<00:02:31.610> what<00:02:32.239> your

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
different so you need to check what your

different so you need to check what your
filter<00:02:32.930> size<00:02:33.140> is<00:02:33.440> and<00:02:33.650> then<00:02:34.250> the<00:02:34.400> 46

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
filter size is and then the 46

filter size is and then the 46
millimeter<00:02:35.570> just<00:02:35.750> allows<00:02:36.080> me<00:02:36.790> to<00:02:37.790> glue<00:02:38.030> it

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.209 
millimeter just allows me to glue it

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:43.449 
millimeter just allows me to glue it
onto<00:02:38.989> the<00:02:39.489> the<00:02:40.489> flip<00:02:40.730> up<00:02:40.880> adapter<00:02:41.330> like<00:02:41.480> so<00:02:42.459> and

onto the the flip up adapter like so and

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:44.940 
onto the the flip up adapter like so and
it's<00:02:43.610> a<00:02:43.790> perfect<00:02:44.239> fit

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950

just<00:04:10.880> around<00:04:11.180> the<00:04:11.300> front<00:04:11.710> to<00:04:12.710> give<00:04:12.830> it<00:04:12.920> a<00:04:12.980> bit

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:13.130 
just around the front to give it a bit

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:15.610 
just around the front to give it a bit
of<00:04:13.220> extra<00:04:13.460> strength<00:04:14.180> to<00:04:15.050> stop<00:04:15.260> it<00:04:15.410> being

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.620 
of extra strength to stop it being

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:17.979 
of extra strength to stop it being
pulled<00:04:15.860> forward<00:04:16.100> and<00:04:17.060> it's<00:04:17.180> just<00:04:17.360> a<00:04:17.480> case<00:04:17.690> now

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:17.989 
pulled forward and it's just a case now

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:21.040
