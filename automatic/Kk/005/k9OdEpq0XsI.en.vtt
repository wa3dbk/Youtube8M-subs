another video covering viq a GCSE

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.059 
another video covering viq a GCSE
computer<00:00:05.130> science<00:00:05.430> course<00:00:05.730> we're<00:00:06.569> looking<00:00:06.600> at

00:00:07.059 --> 00:00:07.069 
computer science course we're looking at

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:09.350 
computer science course we're looking at
clients<00:00:08.069> and<00:00:08.189> servers<00:00:08.460> and<00:00:08.700> the

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
clients and servers and the

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.419 
clients and servers and the
client-server<00:00:09.780> model<00:00:09.960> and<00:00:10.380> in<00:00:10.860> this<00:00:11.010> topic

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
client-server model and in this topic

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.030 
client-server model and in this topic
which<00:00:11.550> Stuber<00:00:11.820> number<00:00:12.030> 18<00:00:12.389> on<00:00:12.630> the<00:00:12.660> spec<00:00:13.080> so

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
which Stuber number 18 on the spec so

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.770 
which Stuber number 18 on the spec so
let's<00:00:14.219> get<00:00:14.429> straight<00:00:14.610> into<00:00:14.700> this<00:00:15.089> define<00:00:15.480> what

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
let's get straight into this define what

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.650 
let's get straight into this define what
a<00:00:15.929> client-server<00:00:16.710> model<00:00:16.890> is<00:00:17.340> so<00:00:17.670> this<00:00:18.330> model

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
a client-server model is so this model

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.900 
a client-server model is so this model
is<00:00:18.930> a<00:00:18.960> structure<00:00:19.560> that<00:00:19.890> splits<00:00:20.160> tasks<00:00:20.670> between

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
is a structure that splits tasks between

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.720 
is a structure that splits tasks between
servers<00:00:21.660> and<00:00:21.810> clients<00:00:22.380> so<00:00:22.590> although<00:00:22.980> we<00:00:23.550> went

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
servers and clients so although we went

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.099 
servers and clients so although we went
through<00:00:23.880> what<00:00:24.000> servers<00:00:24.449> and<00:00:24.570> client<00:00:24.869> saw<00:00:25.050> in

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
through what servers and client saw in

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.040 
through what servers and client saw in
the<00:00:25.320> last<00:00:25.410> video<00:00:25.619> and<00:00:26.000> and<00:00:27.000> by<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:27.869> way<00:00:27.990> I

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
the last video and and by the way I

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.390 
the last video and and by the way I
recommend<00:00:28.260> you<00:00:28.529> check<00:00:28.710> that<00:00:28.890> video<00:00:29.010> out<00:00:29.189> here

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
recommend you check that video out here

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.310 
recommend you check that video out here
and<00:00:29.550> watch<00:00:29.640> it<00:00:29.670> already<00:00:29.970> because<00:00:30.359> quite<00:00:31.109> a<00:00:31.170> lot

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
and watch it already because quite a lot

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.200 
and watch it already because quite a lot
of<00:00:31.349> terms<00:00:31.650> discussed<00:00:32.250> in<00:00:32.399> that<00:00:32.489> video<00:00:32.790> and

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
of terms discussed in that video and

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.420 
of terms discussed in that video and
concepts<00:00:33.870> in<00:00:34.140> that<00:00:34.200> video<00:00:34.649> will<00:00:34.980> apply<00:00:35.370> to

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
concepts in that video will apply to

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.850 
concepts in that video will apply to
this<00:00:36.180> topic<00:00:36.630> and<00:00:37.200> if<00:00:37.320> you<00:00:37.380> don't<00:00:37.530> know<00:00:37.649> them

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
this topic and if you don't know them

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.650 
this topic and if you don't know them
then<00:00:38.070> you're<00:00:38.250> going<00:00:38.340> to<00:00:38.460> be<00:00:38.610> quite<00:00:39.180> confused

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
then you're going to be quite confused

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.920 
then you're going to be quite confused
but<00:00:39.960> let's<00:00:40.680> recap<00:00:40.950> what<00:00:41.070> server<00:00:41.430> is<00:00:41.760> first<00:00:42.120> so

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
but let's recap what server is first so

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.310 
but let's recap what server is first so
servers<00:00:43.680> provide<00:00:44.190> so<00:00:45.149> sorry<00:00:45.629> servers<00:00:46.140> are

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
servers provide so sorry servers are

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.250 
servers provide so sorry servers are
providers<00:00:46.890> or<00:00:47.129> very<00:00:47.430> state<00:00:47.820> resource<00:00:48.570> or<00:00:48.960> so

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
providers or very state resource or so

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.229 
providers or very state resource or so
that<00:00:49.410> should<00:00:49.530> say<00:00:49.649> or<00:00:49.860> service<00:00:50.399> so<00:00:51.120> they

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
that should say or service so they

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.260 
that should say or service so they
provide<00:00:51.600> for<00:00:51.809> resources<00:00:52.199> or<00:00:52.559> services<00:00:52.980> and<00:00:53.640> to

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
provide for resources or services and to

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.479 
provide for resources or services and to
the<00:00:54.390> clients<00:00:54.809> and<00:00:54.989> they<00:00:55.320> request<00:00:55.890> for<00:00:56.100> service

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
the clients and they request for service

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.889 
the clients and they request for service
or<00:00:56.969> resource<00:00:57.600> from<00:00:58.109> the<00:00:58.440> server<00:00:58.710> and<00:00:59.359> so<00:01:00.359> let's

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
or resource from the server and so let's

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.360 
or resource from the server and so let's
have<00:01:00.989> a<00:01:01.079> look<00:01:01.199> at<00:01:01.320> some<00:01:01.440> characteristics<00:01:02.219> of

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
have a look at some characteristics of

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.719 
have a look at some characteristics of
servers<00:01:02.910> servers<00:01:03.570> and<00:01:03.809> clients<00:01:04.650> so<00:01:05.159> servers

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
servers servers and clients so servers

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.920 
servers servers and clients so servers
always<00:01:06.180> wait<00:01:06.450> for<00:01:06.479> requests<00:01:07.110> from<00:01:07.200> clients<00:01:08.930> so

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
always wait for requests from clients so

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.560 
always wait for requests from clients so
everyone's<00:01:10.830> will<00:01:10.979> wait<00:01:11.159> for<00:01:11.400> requests<00:01:12.030> they

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
everyone's will wait for requests they

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.660 
everyone's will wait for requests they
serve<00:01:12.990> client<00:01:13.560> requests<00:01:14.100> by<00:01:14.250> sending

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
serve client requests by sending

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.660 
serve client requests by sending
requests<00:01:15.060> dated<00:01:15.479> to<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:15.720> clients<00:01:16.340> and<00:01:17.340> they

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
requests dated to the clients and they

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.640 
requests dated to the clients and they
may<00:01:18.210> also<00:01:18.420> communicate<00:01:18.960> with<00:01:18.990> other<00:01:19.200> servers

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
may also communicate with other servers

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.859 
may also communicate with other servers
in<00:01:19.860> order<00:01:20.040> to<00:01:20.310> fulfill<00:01:20.759> the<00:01:20.939> request<00:01:21.420> survey

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
in order to fulfill the request survey

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.520 
in order to fulfill the request survey
they<00:01:22.710> may<00:01:22.890> be<00:01:22.950> programmed<00:01:23.610> to<00:01:24.259> request<00:01:25.259> data

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
they may be programmed to request data

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.190 
they may be programmed to request data
from<00:01:25.860> other<00:01:26.040> servers<00:01:26.520> if<00:01:26.759> a<00:01:27.420> specific<00:01:27.750> request

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
from other servers if a specific request

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.530 
from other servers if a specific request
is<00:01:28.380> made<00:01:28.560> from<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:29.070> clients<00:01:29.460> so<00:01:30.000> some<00:01:30.240> look<00:01:30.390> at

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
is made from the clients so some look at

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.060 
is made from the clients so some look at
some<00:01:30.659> current<00:01:30.990> characteristics<00:01:31.650> so<00:01:31.799> they

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
some current characteristics so they

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.210 
some current characteristics so they
always<00:01:32.280> wrote<00:01:32.579> wait<00:01:32.880> for<00:01:33.299> replies<00:01:33.720> and<00:01:34.220> of

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
always wrote wait for replies and of

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.649 
always wrote wait for replies and of
course<00:01:35.549> they<00:01:35.670> always<00:01:35.820> initiate<00:01:36.329> the<00:01:36.540> request

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
course they always initiate the request

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.170 
course they always initiate the request
and<00:01:37.170> then<00:01:37.259> they<00:01:37.380> wait<00:01:37.650> for<00:01:37.680> a<00:01:38.159> reply<00:01:38.640> they

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
and then they wait for a reply they

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.609 
and then they wait for a reply they
always<00:01:39.299> receive<00:01:39.689> replies<00:01:39.960> from<00:01:40.290> the<00:01:40.380> server

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
always receive replies from the server

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.950 
always receive replies from the server
no<00:01:41.040> matter<00:01:41.280> what<00:01:41.610> and<00:01:42.180> as<00:01:42.270> for<00:01:42.420> service<00:01:42.750> down

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
no matter what and as for service down

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.660 
no matter what and as for service down
of<00:01:43.229> course<00:01:43.310> and<00:01:45.530> they<00:01:46.530> connect<00:01:46.950> to<00:01:47.310> a<00:01:47.340> small

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
of course and they connect to a small

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.469 
of course and they connect to a small
number<00:01:47.850> of<00:01:48.030> servers<00:01:48.479> at<00:01:48.659> given<00:01:49.140> time<00:01:49.759> so<00:01:50.759> I'm

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
number of servers at given time so I'm

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.600 
number of servers at given time so I'm
last<00:01:52.200> in<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.560> last<00:01:52.649> video<00:01:53.040> we<00:01:53.220> were<00:01:53.310> looking

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
last in the last video we were looking

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.179 
last in the last video we were looking
at<00:01:53.640> more<00:01:53.850> of<00:01:54.500> Millikan<00:01:55.500> networking<00:01:56.009> so

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
at more of Millikan networking so

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.090 
at more of Millikan networking so
network<00:01:56.640> structures<00:01:57.420> and<00:01:57.659> we<00:01:58.229> define<00:01:58.649> servers

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
network structures and we define servers

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
I would invest topic especially I'll

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.710 
I would invest topic especially I'll
stray<00:02:10.349> away<00:02:10.440> from<00:02:10.530> doing<00:02:11.160> that<00:02:11.430> because<00:02:11.720> this

stray away from doing that because this

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.700 
stray away from doing that because this
actually<00:02:12.959> can<00:02:13.260> happen

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
actually can happen

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
to know about that but I would just

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.860 
to know about that but I would just
stick<00:02:23.160> away<00:02:23.280> from<00:02:23.390> stray<00:02:24.390> away<00:02:24.480> from<00:02:24.720> calling

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
them actual computers in this context

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:30.710 
them actual computers in this context
whether<00:02:28.980> the<00:02:29.130> last<00:02:29.280> video<00:02:29.580> they<00:02:29.820> solve<00:02:30.090> in

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
whether the last video they solve in

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.620 
whether the last video they solve in
context<00:02:31.350> it<00:02:31.470> made<00:02:31.620> more<00:02:31.770> sense<00:02:31.830> and<00:02:32.490> so<00:02:33.480> this

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
context it made more sense and so this

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.570 
context it made more sense and so this
is<00:02:33.810> a<00:02:33.990> diagram<00:02:34.350> showing<00:02:34.980> the<00:02:35.100> client-server

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
is a diagram showing the client-server

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.220 
is a diagram showing the client-server
model<00:02:35.760> so<00:02:36.150> you<00:02:36.210> can<00:02:36.360> see<00:02:36.480> what<00:02:36.630> you<00:02:37.020> can

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
model so you can see what you can

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.040 
model so you can see what you can
there'll<00:02:37.680> be<00:02:37.710> multiple<00:02:38.220> clients<00:02:39.050> connected

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
there'll be multiple clients connected

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.140 
there'll be multiple clients connected
to<00:02:40.230> maybe<00:02:40.620> one<00:02:40.860> several<00:02:41.160> many<00:02:41.580> servers<00:02:41.880> so

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
to maybe one several many servers so

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:43.520 
to maybe one several many servers so
this<00:02:42.270> client<00:02:42.450> may<00:02:42.660> be<00:02:42.690> you<00:02:42.870> be<00:02:43.080> connected<00:02:43.440> to

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
this client may be you be connected to

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.860 
this client may be you be connected to
lots<00:02:43.650> of<00:02:43.770> other<00:02:43.890> servers<00:02:44.340> and<00:02:44.550> doing<00:02:45.450> quite<00:02:45.810> a

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
lots of other servers and doing quite a

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.280 
lots of other servers and doing quite a
few<00:02:45.930> things<00:02:46.080> at<00:02:46.800> any<00:02:47.070> given<00:02:47.340> time<00:02:47.580> so<00:02:48.290> the

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
few things at any given time so the

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.590 
few things at any given time so the
network<00:02:49.590> is<00:02:49.800> a<00:02:49.920> communication<00:02:50.670> medium<00:02:51.090> which

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
network is a communication medium which

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.210 
network is a communication medium which
we<00:02:51.630> looked<00:02:51.870> at<00:02:51.990> last<00:02:52.050> time<00:02:52.290> a<00:02:52.590> tab<00:02:52.740> it's<00:02:52.890> like<00:02:53.100> a

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
we looked at last time a tab it's like a

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.690 
we looked at last time a tab it's like a
communication<00:02:54.000> channel<00:02:54.240> and<00:02:55.130> so<00:02:56.130> for<00:02:56.520> world

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
communication channel and so for world

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.910 
communication channel and so for world
wide<00:02:56.910> web<00:02:57.150> and<00:02:57.390> connecting<00:02:58.350> to<00:02:58.470> the<00:02:58.530> servers

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
wide web and connecting to the servers

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.060 
wide web and connecting to the servers
and<00:02:59.480> so<00:03:00.480> we've<00:03:01.050> also<00:03:01.290> going<00:03:01.410> to<00:03:01.470> look<00:03:01.560> at<00:03:01.740> what

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
and so we've also going to look at what

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:04.930 
and so we've also going to look at what
handshaking<00:03:02.970> is<00:03:03.240> and<00:03:03.510> it's<00:03:04.050> not<00:03:04.320> to<00:03:04.530> do<00:03:04.680> with

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
handshaking is and it's not to do with

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.900 
handshaking is and it's not to do with
normal<00:03:05.940> know<00:03:06.840> the<00:03:07.410> meeting<00:03:08.010> greeting<00:03:08.220> sort<00:03:08.850> of

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
normal know the meeting greeting sort of

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.270 
normal know the meeting greeting sort of
thing<00:03:09.060> this<00:03:09.780> is<00:03:09.840> to<00:03:10.080> do<00:03:10.200> with<00:03:10.380> it's<00:03:11.100> an

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
thing this is to do with it's an

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.730 
thing this is to do with it's an
automated<00:03:11.730> process<00:03:12.120> of<00:03:12.600> negotiation<00:03:13.530> that

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:13.740 
automated process of negotiation that

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:15.590 
automated process of negotiation that
needs<00:03:14.100> to<00:03:14.280> occur<00:03:14.520> to<00:03:14.730> establish<00:03:15.300> a<00:03:15.360> connection

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
needs to occur to establish a connection

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:20.480 
needs to occur to establish a connection
with<00:03:15.990> a<00:03:16.020> foreign<00:03:16.560> device<00:03:16.860> so<00:03:18.560> the<00:03:19.560> visca<00:03:20.220> this

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:20.490 
with a foreign device so the visca this

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:23.000 
with a foreign device so the visca this
connection<00:03:20.940> can<00:03:20.970> only<00:03:21.600> occur<00:03:22.020> once<00:03:22.710> a

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
connection can only occur once a

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.860 
connection can only occur once a
handshaking<00:03:23.670> paren<00:03:24.240> process<00:03:25.200> has<00:03:25.500> occurred

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
handshaking paren process has occurred

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:29.420 
handshaking paren process has occurred
so<00:03:27.870> here<00:03:28.530> the<00:03:28.770> client<00:03:29.010> and<00:03:29.280> the<00:03:29.400> server

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
so here the client and the server

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.330 
so here the client and the server
negotiate<00:03:30.300> what<00:03:31.020> protocols<00:03:31.530> to<00:03:31.650> use<00:03:31.860> and<00:03:32.220> four

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
negotiate what protocols to use and four

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.640 
negotiate what protocols to use and four
parameters<00:03:32.820> that<00:03:33.210> suit<00:03:33.540> each<00:03:33.780> device<00:03:34.290> best

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
parameters that suit each device best

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.560 
parameters that suit each device best
and<00:03:34.920> we<00:03:35.520> look<00:03:35.670> at<00:03:35.820> protocols<00:03:36.210> in<00:03:36.330> the<00:03:36.390> last

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.570 
and we look at protocols in the last

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:37.790 
and we look at protocols in the last
video<00:03:36.870> check<00:03:37.110> that<00:03:37.260> out<00:03:37.350> it's<00:03:37.620> quite

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:37.800 
video check that out it's quite

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.610 
video check that out it's quite
difficult<00:03:37.950> to<00:03:38.210> understand<00:03:39.210> and<00:03:39.480> but<00:03:40.410> you<00:03:40.470> need

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
difficult to understand and but you need

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:41.930 
difficult to understand and but you need
to<00:03:40.740> you<00:03:40.800> need<00:03:40.890> to<00:03:41.010> know<00:03:41.160> it<00:03:41.340> and<00:03:41.490> these

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
to you need to know it and these

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.330 
to you need to know it and these
protocol<00:03:42.510> parameters<00:03:42.660> include<00:03:43.440> that<00:03:43.620> so<00:03:43.950> a

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
protocol parameters include that so a

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:45.800 
protocol parameters include that so a
few<00:03:44.640> examples<00:03:45.120> are<00:03:45.300> the<00:03:45.480> speed<00:03:45.690> of

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
few examples are the speed of

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:48.380 
few examples are the speed of
transmission<00:03:46.320> the<00:03:46.520> error<00:03:47.520> testing<00:03:47.970> methods

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
transmission the error testing methods

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.540 
transmission the error testing methods
and<00:03:48.630> the<00:03:48.750> size<00:03:49.020> of<00:03:49.260> bytes<00:03:49.560> which<00:03:50.190> will<00:03:50.340> vary

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:50.550 
and the size of bytes which will vary

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:52.370 
and the size of bytes which will vary
between<00:03:50.730> devices<00:03:51.180> server<00:03:51.690> client<00:03:51.930> and<00:03:52.290> the

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:52.380 
between devices server client and the

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:54.740 
between devices server client and the
server<00:03:52.590> must<00:03:52.890> agree<00:03:53.160> what<00:03:53.370> values<00:03:53.730> to<00:03:53.910> use<00:03:54.090> via

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
server must agree what values to use via

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.830 
server must agree what values to use via
TVs<00:03:55.110> in<00:03:55.410> this<00:03:55.650> handshaking<00:03:56.130> process<00:03:56.610> so<00:03:57.450> let's

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
TVs in this handshaking process so let's

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.440 
TVs in this handshaking process so let's
have<00:03:57.930> a<00:03:58.020> look<00:03:58.110> at<00:03:58.320> a<00:03:58.470> a<00:03:59.220> versus<00:04:00.210> actually<00:04:00.420> a

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
have a look at a a versus actually a

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:02.840 
have a look at a a versus actually a
gift<00:04:00.930> of<00:04:01.170> this<00:04:01.860> happening<00:04:02.190> I've<00:04:02.430> taken<00:04:02.670> it

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:02.850 
gift of this happening I've taken it

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:04.490 
gift of this happening I've taken it
from<00:04:02.940> Wikipedia<00:04:03.540> shamelessly<00:04:04.050> so<00:04:04.380> as

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
from Wikipedia shamelessly so as

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:08.840 
from Wikipedia shamelessly so as
resource<00:04:04.890> fair<00:04:05.190> and<00:04:06.800> so<00:04:07.800> you<00:04:07.860> can<00:04:08.070> see<00:04:08.250> if<00:04:08.550> it's

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:08.850 
resource fair and so you can see if it's

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:11.270 
resource fair and so you can see if it's
quite<00:04:09.000> fast<00:04:09.300> you<00:04:09.570> can<00:04:09.690> see<00:04:09.840> you<00:04:10.590> can<00:04:10.770> see<00:04:10.920> the

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
quite fast you can see you can see the

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.330 
quite fast you can see you can see the
client<00:04:11.640> Alice<00:04:11.970> initiates<00:04:12.870> with<00:04:13.020> a<00:04:13.170> server<00:04:13.440> the

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
client Alice initiates with a server the

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.940 
client Alice initiates with a server the
server<00:04:14.520> sends<00:04:15.030> back<00:04:15.090> or<00:04:15.600> server<00:04:16.170> replies<00:04:16.470> with

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:16.950 
server sends back or server replies with

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:21.349 
server sends back or server replies with
V<00:04:17.280> and<00:04:18.320> with<00:04:19.320> the<00:04:19.590> values<00:04:20.070> wait<00:04:20.250> it<00:04:20.460> wants<00:04:21.150> and

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 
V and with the values wait it wants and

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:23.840 
V and with the values wait it wants and
then<00:04:21.540> they<00:04:22.230> negotiate<00:04:22.800> can't<00:04:23.040> negotiate<00:04:23.250> and

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:23.850 
then they negotiate can't negotiate and

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:24.410 
then they negotiate can't negotiate and
it<00:04:24.180> can

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:24.420 
it can

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:26.510 
it can
is<00:04:24.810> made<00:04:25.050> through<00:04:25.470> a<00:04:25.560> sound<00:04:25.830> shaking<00:04:26.130> process

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
is made through a sound shaking process

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.880 
is made through a sound shaking process
so<00:04:27.390> it's<00:04:27.690> basically<00:04:27.990> but<00:04:28.440> they're<00:04:28.590> basically

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:28.890 
so it's basically but they're basically

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:31.040 
so it's basically but they're basically
meat<00:04:29.160> so<00:04:29.520> these<00:04:30.060> parameters<00:04:30.450> will<00:04:30.900> have

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050 
meat so these parameters will have

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:33.440 
meat so these parameters will have
author<00:04:31.470> om<00:04:32.130> yeah<00:04:32.730> these<00:04:32.910> parameters<00:04:33.300> will

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:33.450 
author om yeah these parameters will

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:34.940 
author om yeah these parameters will
have<00:04:33.540> different<00:04:33.780> values<00:04:33.930> for<00:04:34.440> between<00:04:34.770> each

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:34.950 
have different values for between each

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:37.400 
have different values for between each
device<00:04:35.280> basically<00:04:36.090> negotiate<00:04:37.020> meeting

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:37.410 
device basically negotiate meeting

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:39.280 
device basically negotiate meeting
meeting<00:04:37.800> meet<00:04:38.190> in<00:04:38.340> the<00:04:38.430> middle

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:39.290 
meeting meet in the middle

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:44.570 
meeting meet in the middle
so<00:04:41.300> we've<00:04:42.300> also<00:04:42.480> got<00:04:42.780> a<00:04:42.810> look<00:04:43.050> at<00:04:43.230> how<00:04:43.770> coding

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:44.580 
so we've also got a look at how coding

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:47.180 
so we've also got a look at how coding
for<00:04:45.270> client-server<00:04:45.810> model<00:04:45.930> differs<00:04:46.890> from

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.190 
for client-server model differs from

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:49.730 
for client-server model differs from
coding<00:04:47.790> for<00:04:48.120> a<00:04:48.150> standalone<00:04:48.690> application<00:04:48.900> you

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:49.740 
coding for a standalone application you

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:51.140 
coding for a standalone application you
probably<00:04:49.770> imagine<00:04:50.340> that<00:04:50.490> it's<00:04:50.580> very<00:04:50.760> quite

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.150 
probably imagine that it's very quite

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:53.690 
probably imagine that it's very quite
different<00:04:51.630> and<00:04:52.350> so<00:04:52.860> when<00:04:53.100> coding<00:04:53.490> for<00:04:53.670> a

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:53.700 
different and so when coding for a

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:55.100 
different and so when coding for a
client<00:04:54.060> server<00:04:54.390> model<00:04:54.510> you<00:04:54.720> need<00:04:54.840> to<00:04:54.990> have

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:55.110 
client server model you need to have

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:58.220 
client server model you need to have
data<00:04:55.350> stored<00:04:55.560> by<00:04:56.010> a<00:04:56.040> server<00:04:56.430> and<00:04:56.990> make<00:04:57.990> sense

00:04:58.220 --> 00:04:58.230 
data stored by a server and make sense

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:00.290 
data stored by a server and make sense
for<00:04:58.380> data<00:04:58.590> to<00:04:58.770> stay<00:04:59.010> by<00:04:59.190> the<00:04:59.250> store<00:05:00.090> by<00:05:00.240> the

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:00.300 
for data to stay by the store by the

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.180 
for data to stay by the store by the
server<00:05:00.630> and<00:05:00.900> the<00:05:01.440> client<00:05:01.470> does<00:05:01.920> all<00:05:02.070> the

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:02.190 
server and the client does all the

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:05.300 
server and the client does all the
processing<00:05:02.820> a<00:05:03.000> lot<00:05:03.900> of<00:05:03.960> processing<00:05:04.560> and<00:05:04.710> as<00:05:05.280> a

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:05.310 
processing a lot of processing and as a

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:07.760 
processing a lot of processing and as a
bus<00:05:05.610> as<00:05:05.760> opposed<00:05:06.090> to<00:05:06.270> the<00:05:06.360> clients<00:05:06.870> but<00:05:07.530> for

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:07.770 
bus as opposed to the clients but for

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:08.990 
bus as opposed to the clients but for
data<00:05:07.920> been<00:05:08.190> stored<00:05:08.400> in<00:05:08.460> the<00:05:08.550> clients<00:05:08.850> computer

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:09.000 
data been stored in the clients computer

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.760 
data been stored in the clients computer
so<00:05:09.450> I<00:05:09.480> need<00:05:09.660> to<00:05:09.720> bear<00:05:09.960> in<00:05:10.110> mind<00:05:10.140> by<00:05:10.470> a

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:10.770 
so I need to bear in mind by a

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:12.650 
so I need to bear in mind by a
programmer<00:05:11.190> also<00:05:11.970> coding<00:05:12.360> for<00:05:12.540> a

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:12.660 
programmer also coding for a

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:14.480 
programmer also coding for a
client-server<00:05:13.260> arrangement<00:05:13.920> requires<00:05:14.250> lots

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:14.490 
client-server arrangement requires lots

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:15.920 
client-server arrangement requires lots
of<00:05:14.610> protocols<00:05:15.060> to<00:05:15.180> be<00:05:15.210> considered<00:05:15.750> and

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:15.930 
of protocols to be considered and

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:18.110 
of protocols to be considered and
implemented<00:05:16.800> as<00:05:16.950> about<00:05:17.640> from<00:05:17.850> the

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.120 
implemented as about from the

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.210 
implemented as about from the
communicating<00:05:18.750> cannot<00:05:19.080> occur<00:05:19.350> because<00:05:19.950> there

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:20.220 
communicating cannot occur because there

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:24.740 
communicating cannot occur because there
always<00:05:20.430> for<00:05:20.580> govern<00:05:21.180> and<00:05:21.390> the<00:05:23.750> communication

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:24.750 
always for govern and the communication

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:27.110 
always for govern and the communication
also<00:05:25.560> generally<00:05:26.010> programming<00:05:26.490> a<00:05:26.640> standard

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:27.120 
also generally programming a standard

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:28.790 
also generally programming a standard
application<00:05:27.330> is<00:05:27.900> easier<00:05:28.260> because<00:05:28.440> you<00:05:28.710> have

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:28.800 
application is easier because you have

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.440 
application is easier because you have
less<00:05:28.950> constraints<00:05:29.640> that<00:05:29.700> are<00:05:29.880> given<00:05:30.180> by<00:05:30.210> the

less constraints that are given by the

web standards / protocols you you are
only<00:05:33.840> really<00:05:34.140> limited<00:05:34.770> when<00:05:35.220> you're

fairly<00:05:42.120> straightforward<00:05:42.660> this<00:05:42.810> video<00:05:43.110> I

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:43.170 
fairly straightforward this video I

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:45.070 
fairly straightforward this video I
think<00:05:43.530> maybe<00:05:43.770> watch<00:05:43.980> it<00:05:44.130> again<00:05:44.220> abyss<00:05:44.610> and

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:45.080 
think maybe watch it again abyss and

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:47.330 
think maybe watch it again abyss and
I've<00:05:46.080> gone<00:05:46.200> through<00:05:46.410> a<00:05:46.440> bit<00:05:46.620> fast<00:05:46.860> but<00:05:47.070> I'm

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:47.340 
I've gone through a bit fast but I'm

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:49.040 
I've gone through a bit fast but I'm
focused<00:05:47.670> on<00:05:47.730> for<00:05:47.880> watching<00:05:48.150> and<00:05:48.330> I'll<00:05:48.840> see<00:05:48.870> you

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:49.050 
focused on for watching and I'll see you

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:51.560 
focused on for watching and I'll see you
in<00:05:49.110> the<00:05:49.170> next<00:05:49.320> video
