 a newborn baby has not lived in these parts for a long time 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:03.779
 man when he was alone the norm 

00:04:03.779 --> 00:04:06.049
 this is the city 

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:08.829
 that man was a merchant he was very successful 

00:04:08.829 --> 00:04:12.639
 there was no day when his establishment was not full of Cameron customers 

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:15.219
 suddenly yan closed the store 

00:04:15.219 --> 00:04:19.169
 with all the drowned profits of the business began to be built from 

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:22.169
 immediately a house with his own hands 

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:26.319
 all the locals were convinced that soon it would be thought that 

00:04:26.319 --> 00:04:28.680
 I would abandon the projector 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:32.990
 He did not keep going and continued to build a little step 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:34.620
 house that had projected 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:38.770
 until after 40 years he managed to complete his null works 

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:42.379
 the version 

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:45.229
 read this book the little ones 

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:49.389
 It was what inspired me and what also made me decide to be an architect 

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:50.779
 in the future 

00:04:50.779 --> 00:04:51.789

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:56.860
 with my own eyes and that day has finally arrived 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:58.870
 that absorbs 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:01.159
 how strange we are listening to offers 

00:05:01.159 --> 00:05:02.930
 I could not help it 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:07.240
 I thought you were not interested in the subject at all and I'm not interested in anything 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:10.900
 you know the Yankee version is an indisputable masterpiece not only from the 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:13.999
 architectural point of view but also from the artistic 

00:05:13.999 --> 00:05:17.559
 It was a revolution in his time to be free of any preconceived ideas 

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:21.410
 amazed and captivating not only architect but also painters and 

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:24.610
 writers is a world heritage that should be preserved for 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:26.380
 always of course 

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:27.860

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:30.860
