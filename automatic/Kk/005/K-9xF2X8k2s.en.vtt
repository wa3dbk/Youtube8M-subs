00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.630 
these days I've had these for a little
while<00:00:57.989> have<00:00:58.680> not<00:00:58.859> used<00:00:59.070> them<00:00:59.129> a<00:00:59.219> heck<00:00:59.370> of<00:00:59.399> a<00:00:59.520> lot

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
while have not used them a heck of a lot

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.880 
while have not used them a heck of a lot
just<00:00:59.850> because<00:00:59.969> I've<00:01:00.239> got<00:01:00.539> my<00:01:01.500> standard<00:01:01.680> old

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
just because I've got my standard old

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.650 
just because I've got my standard old
models<00:01:02.250> but<00:01:02.399> I<00:01:02.609> saw<00:01:03.030> they<00:01:03.180> thought<00:01:03.449> they<00:01:03.539> were

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
models but I saw they thought they were

stainless steel very nicely constructed
against<00:01:37.049> sub-zero<00:01:37.619> makes<00:01:38.009> good<00:01:38.250> stuff<00:01:38.640> so<00:01:39.090> why

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
against sub-zero makes good stuff so why

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.230 
against sub-zero makes good stuff so why
not<00:01:39.900> get<00:01:40.079> a<00:01:40.140> sub-zero<00:01:40.409> water<00:01:40.890> bottle<00:01:41.250> I<00:01:41.700> like

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
not get a sub-zero water bottle I like

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.039 
not get a sub-zero water bottle I like
this<00:01:42.360> a<00:01:42.420> lot

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
this a lot

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.990 
this a lot
I've<00:01:43.470> used<00:01:43.680> it<00:01:43.770> around<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.159> house<00:01:44.369> in<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:44.759> car

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
I've used it around the house in the car

all that type stuff again big thinner
and<00:01:47.130> smaller<00:01:47.250> here<00:01:47.670> does<00:01:48.180> fit<00:01:48.390> a<00:01:48.420> cup<00:01:48.990> holder

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140

fairly well a little bit top-heavy but
not<00:01:51.840> real<00:01:52.079> bad<00:01:52.549> the<00:01:53.549> advantage<00:01:53.970> of<00:01:54.060> this<00:01:54.180> one

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
not real bad the advantage of this one

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:55.609 
not real bad the advantage of this one

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
compactness I like that I think that's

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.670 
compactness I like that I think that's
