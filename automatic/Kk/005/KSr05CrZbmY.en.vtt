in<00:02:22.870> here<00:02:25.290> remember<00:02:26.290> there<00:02:26.470> is<00:02:26.500> air<00:02:27.299> so<00:02:28.299> to<00:02:28.600> get

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
in here remember there is air so to get

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:33.660 
in here remember there is air so to get
it<00:02:29.110> in<00:02:29.970> you<00:02:30.970> need<00:02:31.150> to<00:02:31.180> push<00:02:31.660> in<00:02:31.959> and<00:02:32.670> turn

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
it in you need to push in and turn

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.110 
it in you need to push in and turn
that's<00:02:34.330> the<00:02:34.569> tricky<00:02:34.870> part<00:02:35.880> because<00:02:36.880> that

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
that's the tricky part because that

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.140 
that's the tricky part because that
makes<00:02:37.569> it<00:02:37.780> loose<00:02:38.080> and<00:02:38.380> pushes<00:02:39.370> it<00:02:39.400> back<00:02:39.549> that

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
makes it loose and pushes it back that

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.449 
makes it loose and pushes it back that
the<00:02:40.390> green<00:02:40.630> part<00:02:40.900> on<00:02:41.110> the<00:02:41.200> middle<00:02:41.470> it<00:02:42.130> push

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:42.459 
the green part on the middle it push

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:44.400 
the green part on the middle it push
disarrange<00:02:43.120> back<00:02:43.390> so<00:02:43.660> you<00:02:43.750> need<00:02:43.900> to<00:02:44.049> apply<00:02:44.290> a

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
disarrange back so you need to apply a

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:49.699 
disarrange back so you need to apply a
little<00:02:44.799> you<00:02:45.040> know<00:02:45.430> pressure<00:02:46.350> like<00:02:47.609> you<00:02:48.609> go<00:02:48.820> in

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
little you know pressure like you go in

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:52.860 
little you know pressure like you go in
and<00:02:50.709> you<00:02:51.070> turn<00:02:51.340> I<00:02:51.640> like<00:02:51.940> to<00:02:52.090> see<00:02:52.299> you<00:02:52.510> get<00:02:52.840> a

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
and you turn I like to see you get a

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.310 
and you turn I like to see you get a
little<00:02:53.079> okay<00:02:53.950> well<00:02:54.540> now<00:02:55.540> you<00:02:55.600> see<00:02:55.989> where<00:02:56.170> the

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:56.320 
little okay well now you see where the

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:00.390 
little okay well now you see where the
air<00:02:56.500> is<00:02:56.530> that<00:02:57.190> right<00:02:57.430> on<00:02:57.609> top<00:02:57.959> yes<00:02:58.959> because<00:02:59.890> if

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
air is that right on top yes because if

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
air is that right on top yes because if
I<00:03:00.940> do<00:03:01.000> this<00:03:01.329> you<00:03:01.900> see<00:03:02.109> it<00:03:02.320> goes<00:03:02.560> right<00:03:02.799> in<00:03:03.329> so<00:03:04.329> we

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
I do this you see it goes right in so we

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.630 
I do this you see it goes right in so we
have<00:03:04.630> to<00:03:04.840> the<00:03:05.290> plunger<00:03:05.709> has<00:03:05.890> to<00:03:06.040> be<00:03:06.160> up<00:03:06.310> on

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
have to the plunger has to be up on

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.300 
have to the plunger has to be up on
hands<00:03:07.239> okay<00:03:07.600> one<00:03:08.170> of<00:03:08.200> the<00:03:08.350> pointers<00:03:08.769> up<00:03:09.040> you

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
hands okay one of the pointers up you

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.819 
hands okay one of the pointers up you
can<00:03:09.519> start<00:03:09.970> pushing<00:03:11.880> now<00:03:12.880> halfway<00:03:13.569> through

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:13.829 
can start pushing now halfway through

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:18.479 
can start pushing now halfway through
you<00:03:14.829> need<00:03:14.980> to<00:03:15.190> go<00:03:15.569> back<00:03:16.569> and<00:03:17.250> there's<00:03:18.250> going<00:03:18.430> to

you need to go back and there's going to
be<00:03:18.579> a<00:03:18.670> blood<00:03:18.970> in<00:03:19.150> the<00:03:19.269> line<00:03:19.620> you<00:03:20.620> see<00:03:20.799> the<00:03:20.920> blood

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 
be a blood in the line you see the blood

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:24.000 
be a blood in the line you see the blood
in<00:03:21.250> the<00:03:21.280> line<00:03:21.579> uh-huh<00:03:22.480> okay<00:03:23.260> why<00:03:23.530> you<00:03:23.590> see<00:03:23.889> the

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
in the line uh-huh okay why you see the

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:25.379 
in the line uh-huh okay why you see the
blood<00:03:24.220> in<00:03:24.370> the<00:03:24.459> line<00:03:24.639> then<00:03:24.880> you<00:03:25.000> continue

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:25.389 
blood in the line then you continue

00:03:25.389 --> 00:03:26.780 
blood in the line then you continue
pushing<00:03:25.810> in

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
pushing in

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:31.590 
pushing in
laughing<00:03:27.790> the<00:03:27.910> line<00:03:28.090> is<00:03:28.299> open<00:03:30.030> okay<00:03:31.030> and<00:03:31.329> you

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:31.600 
laughing the line is open okay and you

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.780 
laughing the line is open okay and you
stop<00:03:31.840> somewhere<00:03:32.260> around<00:03:32.380> here<00:03:32.859> so<00:03:33.040> all<00:03:33.489> the

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 
stop somewhere around here so all the

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:38.430 
stop somewhere around here so all the
air<00:03:34.000> stays<00:03:34.750> in<00:03:34.989> the<00:03:35.109> syringe<00:03:35.440> mmm<00:03:36.370> okay<00:03:37.440> then

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
air stays in the syringe mmm okay then

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.400 
air stays in the syringe mmm okay then
you<00:03:38.560> take<00:03:38.769> that<00:03:38.980> up<00:03:39.870> then<00:03:40.870> you<00:03:41.049> need<00:03:41.230> this

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.410 
you take that up then you need this

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:46.199 
you take that up then you need this
board<00:03:41.799> right<00:03:42.389> so<00:03:43.389> you<00:03:43.540> unscrew<00:03:44.310> then<00:03:45.310> and<00:03:46.090> this

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:46.209 
board right so you unscrew then and this

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:48.210 
board right so you unscrew then and this
is<00:03:46.389> the<00:03:46.480> part<00:03:46.720> that<00:03:46.780> goes<00:03:47.079> in<00:03:47.380> so<00:03:47.859> for<00:03:48.100> this

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
is the part that goes in so for this

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.969 
is the part that goes in so for this
this<00:03:48.519> is<00:03:48.579> just<00:03:48.760> a<00:03:49.030> class<00:03:49.329> right<00:03:49.799> don't<00:03:50.799> know

00:03:50.969 --> 00:03:50.979 
this is just a class right don't know

00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:52.740 
this is just a class right don't know
we're<00:03:51.250> sitting<00:03:51.790> there<00:03:51.820> the<00:03:52.150> Saline<00:03:52.540> that's

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750 
we're sitting there the Saline that's

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:54.720 
we're sitting there the Saline that's
the<00:03:52.900> flush<00:03:53.169> that's<00:03:53.560> to<00:03:53.799> make<00:03:53.979> sure<00:03:54.340> that<00:03:54.549> the

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:54.730 
the flush that's to make sure that the

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:57.300 
the flush that's to make sure that the
-<00:03:55.090> Creighton<00:03:55.540> and<00:03:55.780> then<00:03:56.080> there<00:03:57.069> is<00:03:57.159> no

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
- Creighton and then there is no

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:59.520 
- Creighton and then there is no
problems<00:03:57.819> with<00:03:57.970> it<00:03:58.030> because<00:03:58.569> then<00:03:59.080> you<00:03:59.290> have

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530 
problems with it because then you have

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:02.460 
problems with it because then you have
the<00:03:59.769> antibiotic<00:04:00.519> you<00:04:01.180> need<00:04:01.330> to<00:04:01.450> push<00:04:01.780> in<00:04:02.049> just

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.470 
the antibiotic you need to push in just

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:04.229 
the antibiotic you need to push in just
like<00:04:02.560> the<00:04:02.739> syringe<00:04:03.099> you<00:04:03.670> push<00:04:03.909> in<00:04:04.030> the<00:04:04.120> middle

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:04.239 
like the syringe you push in the middle

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:07.380 
like the syringe you push in the middle
and<00:04:04.569> then<00:04:05.170> you<00:04:05.290> turn<00:04:05.560> it<00:04:05.769> right<00:04:06.610> no<00:04:07.239> it's

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:07.390 
and then you turn it right no it's

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:09.149 
and then you turn it right no it's
almost<00:04:07.510> like<00:04:07.780> in<00:04:07.989> one<00:04:08.379> of<00:04:08.470> those<00:04:08.590> cable<00:04:09.010> wires

00:04:09.149 --> 00:04:09.159 
almost like in one of those cable wires

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:10.920 
almost like in one of those cable wires
if<00:04:09.489> you<00:04:09.549> put<00:04:09.730> in<00:04:09.849> the<00:04:09.940> back<00:04:10.090> of<00:04:10.120> the<00:04:10.269> TV<00:04:10.450> you<00:04:10.690> go

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:10.930 
if you put in the back of the TV you go

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:13.530 
if you put in the back of the TV you go
yeah<00:04:11.230> you<00:04:11.290> see<00:04:11.590> her<00:04:11.830> see<00:04:12.099> hers<00:04:12.310> like<00:04:12.670> it's

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540 
yeah you see her see hers like it's

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:14.190 
yeah you see her see hers like it's
screwable

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:14.200 
screwable

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.370 
screwable
right<00:04:14.650> and<00:04:15.129> this<00:04:15.910> part<00:04:16.239> in<00:04:16.359> the<00:04:16.419> middle<00:04:16.570> has<00:04:17.169> to

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:17.380 
right and this part in the middle has to

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:19.920 
right and this part in the middle has to
go<00:04:17.500> right<00:04:17.829> in<00:04:18.010> and<00:04:18.250> then<00:04:19.000> you<00:04:19.180> screw<00:04:19.750> it<00:04:19.810> it

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:22.800 
go right in and then you screw it it
because<00:04:20.410> okay<00:04:21.190> so<00:04:21.430> it's<00:04:22.150> the<00:04:22.180> same<00:04:22.419> thing<00:04:22.660> with

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:22.810 
because okay so it's the same thing with

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:24.420 
because okay so it's the same thing with
that<00:04:22.960> you<00:04:23.440> see<00:04:23.650> it's<00:04:23.770> in<00:04:23.919> the<00:04:23.979> middle

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430 
that you see it's in the middle

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:26.969 
that you see it's in the middle
mm-hmm<00:04:25.180> and<00:04:25.270> that<00:04:25.600> has<00:04:26.080> to<00:04:26.260> go<00:04:26.380> into<00:04:26.650> the<00:04:26.770> green

00:04:26.969 --> 00:04:26.979 
mm-hmm and that has to go into the green

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:29.480 
mm-hmm and that has to go into the green
part<00:04:27.280> right<00:04:27.520> and<00:04:28.240> then<00:04:28.600> you<00:04:28.750> turn<00:04:28.960> it<00:04:29.139> in

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490 
part right and then you turn it in
