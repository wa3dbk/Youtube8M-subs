this up and have a look at what this
looks<00:02:03.659> like<00:02:03.750> closed<00:02:04.549> so<00:02:05.549> we<00:02:05.990> have<00:02:06.990> got<00:02:07.200> these

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
looks like closed so we have got these

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.229 
looks like closed so we have got these
smart<00:02:07.770> wake<00:02:07.950> feature<00:02:08.220> so<00:02:08.610> when<00:02:08.759> we<00:02:08.879> open<00:02:09.149> this

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
smart wake feature so when we open this

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.839 
smart wake feature so when we open this
up<00:02:09.300> it<00:02:09.690> does<00:02:09.840> automatically<00:02:10.379> sleep<00:02:10.920> and<00:02:11.160> wake

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
up it does automatically sleep and wake

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.940 
up it does automatically sleep and wake
the<00:02:12.120> iPad<00:02:12.540> so<00:02:13.020> that's<00:02:13.230> nice

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
the iPad so that's nice

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.030

speaker and a cut out for that dock
connector<00:02:45.000> now<00:02:45.750> this<00:02:45.780> does<00:02:46.290> offer<00:02:46.590> up<00:02:46.860> stand

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
connector now this does offer up stand

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.880 
connector now this does offer up stand
features<00:02:47.700> as<00:02:48.060> well<00:02:48.090> and<00:02:48.480> this<00:02:49.380> is<00:02:49.560> all<00:02:49.680> to<00:02:49.799> do

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
features as well and this is all to do

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.339 
features as well and this is all to do
with<00:02:49.920> this<00:02:50.130> Ridge<00:02:50.540> so<00:02:51.540> if<00:02:51.750> we<00:02:51.870> open<00:02:51.989> up<00:02:52.200> the

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:52.349 
with this Ridge so if we open up the

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:57.229 
with this Ridge so if we open up the
case<00:02:52.530> and<00:02:53.510> we<00:02:54.510> can<00:02:54.750> actually<00:02:55.250> just<00:02:56.250> hold<00:02:57.060> the

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
case and we can actually just hold the

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:01.100 
case and we can actually just hold the
case<00:02:57.420> in<00:02:57.660> our<00:02:57.780> hand<00:02:58.049> and<00:02:58.260> it's<00:02:58.799> not<00:02:59.099> to<00:03:00.049> sort<00:03:01.049> of

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
case in our hand and it's not to sort of

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:02.870 
case in our hand and it's not to sort of
thick<00:03:01.319> to<00:03:01.709> hold<00:03:01.950> it's<00:03:02.250> not<00:03:02.400> a<00:03:02.459> lot<00:03:02.610> of<00:03:02.640> bulk

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
thick to hold it's not a lot of bulk

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.839 
thick to hold it's not a lot of bulk
added<00:03:03.239> on<00:03:03.360> to<00:03:03.750> the<00:03:03.900> ipad<00:03:04.290> now<00:03:05.280> if<00:03:05.549> we<00:03:05.670> want<00:03:05.819> to

00:03:05.839 --> 00:03:05.849 
added on to the ipad now if we want to

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:08.300 
added on to the ipad now if we want to
get<00:03:05.940> it<00:03:06.060> to<00:03:06.180> stand<00:03:06.480> we<00:03:07.319> just<00:03:07.590> take<00:03:07.950> this<00:03:08.130> up

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
get it to stand we just take this up

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.990 
get it to stand we just take this up
like<00:03:08.519> so<00:03:08.790> we<00:03:09.739> adjust<00:03:10.739> it<00:03:10.950> so<00:03:10.980> that<00:03:11.400> this<00:03:11.579> lays

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
like so we adjust it so that this lays

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.550 
like so we adjust it so that this lays
underneath<00:03:12.599> the<00:03:12.780> ridge<00:03:12.959> on<00:03:13.140> the<00:03:13.200> back<00:03:13.230> of<00:03:13.410> the

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
underneath the ridge on the back of the

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.080 
underneath the ridge on the back of the
case<00:03:13.769> let<00:03:14.040> me<00:03:14.130> show<00:03:14.280> you<00:03:14.310> that<00:03:14.519> from<00:03:14.760> the<00:03:14.819> back

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
case let me show you that from the back

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.569 
case let me show you that from the back
so<00:03:15.810> it's<00:03:15.930> just<00:03:16.230> located<00:03:16.769> underneath<00:03:17.340> that

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:17.579 
so it's just located underneath that

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:20.569 
so it's just located underneath that
Ridge<00:03:17.880> point<00:03:18.209> and<00:03:18.600> then<00:03:19.530> we've<00:03:20.010> got<00:03:20.040> a<00:03:20.250> nice

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:20.579 
Ridge point and then we've got a nice

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:22.640 
Ridge point and then we've got a nice
angle<00:03:20.970> for<00:03:21.480> viewing<00:03:21.750> back<00:03:21.930> the<00:03:22.049> content<00:03:22.500> i'm

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
angle for viewing back the content i'm

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.400 
angle for viewing back the content i'm
looking<00:03:22.950> at<00:03:23.040> now<00:03:23.310> or<00:03:23.519> indeed<00:03:24.209> for<00:03:24.420> typing<00:03:24.959> it's

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
looking at now or indeed for typing it's

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.530 
looking at now or indeed for typing it's
just<00:03:25.650> a<00:03:25.739> nice<00:03:25.889> angle<00:03:26.190> it's<00:03:26.790> roughly<00:03:27.269> I<00:03:27.359> would

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
just a nice angle it's roughly I would

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.949 
just a nice angle it's roughly I would
say<00:03:27.750> about<00:03:28.290> a<00:03:28.500> 25<00:03:29.130> degree<00:03:29.160> angle<00:03:29.940> when<00:03:30.660> it's<00:03:30.810> in

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
say about a 25 degree angle when it's in

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:33.740 
say about a 25 degree angle when it's in
this<00:03:31.139> low<00:03:31.350> position<00:03:31.639> now<00:03:32.639> you<00:03:32.700> can<00:03:33.060> also<00:03:33.329> use

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
this low position now you can also use

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.860 
this low position now you can also use
this<00:03:33.959> to<00:03:34.170> stand<00:03:34.470> the<00:03:34.980> ipad<00:03:35.400> up<00:03:35.579> and<00:03:35.850> the<00:03:36.600> way<00:03:36.720> we

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
this to stand the ipad up and the way we

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.259 
this to stand the ipad up and the way we
do<00:03:36.989> this<00:03:37.230> to<00:03:37.739> get<00:03:37.859> the<00:03:38.100> even<00:03:38.549> higher<00:03:38.760> position

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:39.269 
do this to get the even higher position

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:42.979 
do this to get the even higher position
is<00:03:39.450> we<00:03:40.579> push<00:03:41.579> this<00:03:41.760> back<00:03:42.030> out<00:03:42.329> of<00:03:42.540> the<00:03:42.600> way<00:03:42.750> and

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
is we push this back out of the way and

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:45.770 
is we push this back out of the way and
then<00:03:43.560> we<00:03:43.799> can<00:03:44.010> stand<00:03:44.310> it<00:03:44.459> up<00:03:44.609> very<00:03:44.850> simply<00:03:45.450> at
