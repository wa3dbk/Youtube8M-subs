00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:09.860
 currency crisis 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:15.839
 the foreign exchange market is a market on 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.670
 which are found all the actors 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.140
 who wish to exchange a currency 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.760
 against another currency 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.770
 for example the euro against the dollar 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:26.840
 this is particularly the case for banks and 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:29.130
 some companies that work 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.900
 so several currencies 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.180
 these currencies are exchanged according to their 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.420
 exchange rate ie their value 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.010
 which can evolve 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.320
 when a currency loses a lot of 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.679
 worth at least 30% less than the 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.199
 dollar 

00:00:40.679 --> 00:00:46.140
 it is said that the country is experiencing a crisis of 

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:48.390
 change this can happen if the country 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.940
 do not aspire to trust because he knows 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.969
 a large budget deficit and a 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.070
 high inflation for example the actors 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.019
 gets rid of the currency on the 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.790
 foreign exchange market for fear that it will 

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:02.190
 is worth nothing 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:03.930
 but this phenomenon can be amplified if 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.540
 speculators anticipate the loss of 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.520
 value of the currency and before so much 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.580
 that she is high to be able to 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:14.710
 buy back cheaper once to evaluate 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:17.380
 it's a self-fulfilling crisis 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:19.210
 indeed if they sell the currency there 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:23.400
 increases supply and decreases demand 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:25.200
 which amounts to lowering its value 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.220
 a currency crisis has heavy 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.050
 consequences on the economy 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.210
 for example if a Swedish bank 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:33.520
 footprint $ 300 when a 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.030
 Swedish crowns equals 0.12 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.760
 dollar 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:40.760
 she will have to repay 2,500 crowns 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:42.920
 however, if the crown loses 30% of its 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:46.340
 value, that is to say, equals more than 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:49.670
 0.0 84 dollars the bank will have to 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.610
 pay 3571 crowns for the same 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.500
 borrowed amount 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.930
 plus the value of the currency 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:58.150
 further diminishes the indebted banks in 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:00.290
 foreign currencies may be struggling 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:02.300
 to repay 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:04.030
 in the face of such a crisis the banks 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:06.580
 central 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:08.020
 increase their key rates this is to 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.360
 say the rate at which she lends 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.800
 money to the banks for these 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.690
 the latter also increase their 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.640
 interest rate 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:18.070
 speculators and more difficulties 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.950
 to borrow and therefore to buy 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:21.930
 currency 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:25.019
 or use their foreign currency reserves 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:27.720
 foreigners very often the dollar for 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:30.000
 rebalance supply and demand 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.740
 indeed when their currency is weak 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.600
 they can sell their currencies 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:36.510
 against their own currencies 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:38.240
 to increase his demand and therefore his 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.910
 price 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:43.250
 however, all household actors 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:45.290
 companies and banks are affected 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:47.360
 by increasing the policy rate 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:50.270
 because they can find themselves 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:52.860
 in an ability to borrow to repay 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:55.050
 and to lend 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:57.330
 investments are curbing the 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:58.740
 growth slows down and some banks 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.810
 can then go bankrupt 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:04.110
 this is called a crisis 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:06.030
 banking the value of a currency so 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:07.980
 a capital importance for a country 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:10.170
 since it can be at the origin of 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.380
 several crises and in particular crisis 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.380
 banking
