riding<00:00:12.509> around<00:00:12.660> here<00:00:13.019> flats<00:00:13.620> we're<00:00:14.130> probably

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
riding around here flats we're probably

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.970 
riding around here flats we're probably
happening<00:00:15.150> every<00:00:15.660> two<00:00:15.870> or<00:00:15.960> three<00:00:16.020> Rises<00:00:16.619> be

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
happening every two or three Rises be

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.560 
happening every two or three Rises be
common<00:00:17.310> occurrence<00:00:17.640> especially<00:00:18.180> in<00:00:18.270> the<00:00:18.359> fall

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
common occurrence especially in the fall

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:24.080 
common occurrence especially in the fall
we<00:00:19.410> get<00:00:19.590> goat<00:00:19.800> heads<00:00:20.160> and<00:00:20.550> now<00:00:22.369> so<00:00:23.369> so<00:00:23.789> far<00:00:23.820> this

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
we get goat heads and now so so far this

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.609 
we get goat heads and now so so far this
year<00:00:24.150> I've<00:00:24.359> had<00:00:24.510> two<00:00:24.750> flats<00:00:25.050> and<00:00:25.380> those<00:00:25.470> are

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
year I've had two flats and those are

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.519 
year I've had two flats and those are
pretty<00:00:25.769> much<00:00:26.779> catastrophic<00:00:27.779> tire<00:00:28.019> failures

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
pretty much catastrophic tire failures

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.730 
pretty much catastrophic tire failures
where<00:00:28.800> I<00:00:29.039> just<00:00:29.070> would<00:00:29.550> rip<00:00:29.730> side<00:00:30.000> walls<00:00:30.240> and

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:30.740 
where I just would rip side walls and

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:32.600 
where I just would rip side walls and
doesn't<00:00:31.740> matter<00:00:31.890> what<00:00:32.070> I<00:00:32.099> was<00:00:32.250> riding<00:00:32.579> the

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
doesn't matter what I was riding the

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.639 
doesn't matter what I was riding the
tire<00:00:33.149> pretty<00:00:33.450> much<00:00:33.570> just<00:00:33.750> had<00:00:33.989> big<00:00:34.200> gashes

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
tire pretty much just had big gashes

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.240 
tire pretty much just had big gashes
from<00:00:34.860> our<00:00:34.980> sharp<00:00:35.190> rocks<00:00:35.399> around<00:00:35.670> here<00:00:35.910> so<00:00:37.250> it's

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
from our sharp rocks around here so it's

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.160 
from our sharp rocks around here so it's
really<00:00:38.579> reduced<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.090> number<00:00:39.300> of<00:00:39.329> flats<00:00:39.570> and

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
really reduced the number of flats and

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.100 
really reduced the number of flats and
being<00:00:40.890> able<00:00:40.950> to<00:00:41.190> read<00:00:41.420> much<00:00:42.420> lower<00:00:42.660> pressures

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
being able to read much lower pressures

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.139 
being able to read much lower pressures
and<00:00:43.260> not<00:00:43.379> worry<00:00:43.559> about<00:00:43.620> pinch<00:00:43.980> flats<00:00:44.250> I've

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
and not worry about pinch flats I've

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.860 
and not worry about pinch flats I've
been<00:00:45.270> able<00:00:45.390> to<00:00:45.629> run<00:00:45.870> a<00:00:46.489> lighter<00:00:47.489> smaller<00:00:48.360> knob

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
been able to run a lighter smaller knob

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.840 
been able to run a lighter smaller knob
tires<00:00:49.230> which<00:00:49.590> allowed<00:00:49.829> me<00:00:49.860> to<00:00:50.100> go<00:00:50.250> up<00:00:50.280> faster<00:00:50.610> I

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
tires which allowed me to go up faster I

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.790 
tires which allowed me to go up faster I
think<00:00:51.059> it's<00:00:51.149> really<00:00:51.390> been<00:00:51.539> big<00:00:52.469> part<00:00:52.770> of

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
think it's really been big part of

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.119 
think it's really been big part of
racing<00:00:53.640> him<00:00:54.030> in<00:00:54.270> a<00:00:54.600> comment<00:00:55.559> such<00:00:55.710> a<00:00:55.800> good<00:00:55.949> beer

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
racing him in a comment such a good beer

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.590 
racing him in a comment such a good beer
or<00:00:56.309> so<00:00:56.840> now<00:00:57.840> this<00:00:58.020> guy<00:00:58.199> is<00:00:58.230> on<00:00:58.620> it's<00:00:58.829> aired<00:00:59.070> up

00:00:59.590 --> 00:00:59.600 
or so now this guy is on it's aired up

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.860 
or so now this guy is on it's aired up
you<00:01:00.600> can<00:01:00.780> listen<00:01:01.730> little<00:01:02.730> hair<00:01:02.940> sometimes<00:01:03.780> you

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
you can listen little hair sometimes you

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.149 
you can listen little hair sometimes you
hear<00:01:04.019> a<00:01:04.080> little<00:01:04.199> hissing<00:01:04.559> and<00:01:04.769> then<00:01:04.860> you<00:01:04.979> if

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
hear a little hissing and then you if

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.490 
hear a little hissing and then you if
you<00:01:05.280> do<00:01:05.489> get<00:01:06.479> that<00:01:06.659> part<00:01:06.900> to<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:07.110> bottom<00:01:07.439> and

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
you do get that part to the bottom and

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.820 
you do get that part to the bottom and
give<00:01:07.650> it<00:01:07.680> a<00:01:07.799> good<00:01:07.890> shake<00:01:08.390> now<00:01:09.390> seal<00:01:09.750> it<00:01:09.869> up<00:01:09.960> do

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
give it a good shake now seal it up do

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.090 
give it a good shake now seal it up do
you<00:01:10.920> typically<00:01:11.369> lose<00:01:11.820> any<00:01:12.180> air<00:01:12.450> pressure

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:13.100 
you typically lose any air pressure

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.800 
you typically lose any air pressure
usually<00:01:14.100> home<00:01:14.430> psi<00:01:15.000> when<00:01:15.270> you're<00:01:15.390> doing<00:01:15.720> the

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
usually home psi when you're doing the

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.710 
usually home psi when you're doing the
setup<00:01:16.170> or<00:01:16.670> it<00:01:17.670> really<00:01:18.060> depends<00:01:18.600> on<00:01:18.659> the

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
setup or it really depends on the

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.660 
setup or it really depends on the
tiresome<00:01:19.290> tires<00:01:19.530> are<00:01:19.770> really<00:01:20.040> good

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
tiresome tires are really good

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.330 
tiresome tires are really good
if<00:01:20.970> you<00:01:21.119> have<00:01:21.240> a<00:01:21.270> heavy<00:01:21.600> retire<00:01:21.990> usually<00:01:22.530> you

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
if you have a heavy retire usually you

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.700 
if you have a heavy retire usually you
know<00:01:23.490> over<00:01:24.210> five<00:01:24.450> six<00:01:24.990> hundred<00:01:25.259> gram<00:01:25.439> tire

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
know over five six hundred gram tire

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.920 
know over five six hundred gram tire
they<00:01:26.700> tend<00:01:26.939> to<00:01:27.000> hold<00:01:27.150> air<00:01:27.299> pretty<00:01:27.509> well<00:01:27.720> and

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
they tend to hold air pretty well and

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.990 
they tend to hold air pretty well and
once<00:01:28.290> Naomi<00:01:28.979> issues<00:01:29.220> you<00:01:29.310> might<00:01:29.430> run<00:01:29.580> into<00:01:29.640> or

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
once Naomi issues you might run into or

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.820 
once Naomi issues you might run into or
right<00:01:30.210> along<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.570> bead<00:01:30.750> and<00:01:31.439> that's<00:01:31.619> where

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:31.830 
right along the bead and that's where

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:33.710 
right along the bead and that's where
the<00:01:31.979> tooth<00:01:32.250> brushing<00:01:32.610> comes<00:01:32.820> in<00:01:33.000> nicely<00:01:33.210> or

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
the tooth brushing comes in nicely or

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.600 
the tooth brushing comes in nicely or
I'm<00:01:34.049> really<00:01:34.560> shaking<00:01:34.770> it<00:01:35.070> once<00:01:35.280> you<00:01:35.399> get<00:01:35.520> it

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
I'm really shaking it once you get it

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.170 
I'm really shaking it once you get it
set<00:01:35.820> up<00:01:35.850> so<00:01:36.680> sometimes<00:01:37.680> if<00:01:38.640> you<00:01:38.789> have<00:01:38.909> a<00:01:38.940> little

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
set up so sometimes if you have a little

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:46.100 
set up so sometimes if you have a little
leak<00:01:40.039> one<00:01:41.039> trick<00:01:41.780> just<00:01:42.780> a<00:01:42.930> little<00:01:43.080> water<00:01:45.110> this

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
leak one trick just a little water this

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.980 
leak one trick just a little water this
is<00:01:46.289> in<00:01:46.409> the<00:01:46.560> sidewall<00:01:47.149> it's<00:01:48.149> usually<00:01:48.720> most

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
is in the sidewall it's usually most

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.940 
is in the sidewall it's usually most
leaks<00:01:49.289> occur<00:01:49.759> read<00:01:50.759> along<00:01:50.939> the<00:01:51.119> bead<00:01:51.299> you

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
leaks occur read along the bead you

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.249 
leaks occur read along the bead you
could<00:01:52.950> just<00:01:53.479> keep<00:01:54.479> your<00:01:54.659> water<00:01:54.869> and<00:01:55.050> let<00:01:55.229> it

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
could just keep your water and let it

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.249 
could just keep your water and let it
flow<00:01:55.500> around<00:01:55.710> the<00:01:55.890> bead<00:01:56.569> we<00:01:57.569> got<00:01:57.750> see<00:01:58.050> ledge

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
flow around the bead we got see ledge

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.330 
flow around the bead we got see ledge
here<00:01:58.530> so<00:01:58.799> we<00:01:58.950> had<00:01:59.250> no<00:01:59.429> problem<00:02:00.830> and<00:02:01.830> look<00:02:02.039> for

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
here so we had no problem and look for

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.270 
here so we had no problem and look for
bubbles<00:02:02.520> and<00:02:03.590> just<00:02:04.590> that<00:02:04.740> little<00:02:04.890> double

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
bubbles and just that little double

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.380
