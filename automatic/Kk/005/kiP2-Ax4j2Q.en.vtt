00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.020
 look it was if the time that the offices 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:08.790
 The doctors were uncomfortable and 

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:11.519
 increasingly dehumanized 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:14.309
 spaces both the offices and the 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.940
 waiting rooms are with projects 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:20.430
 architectural plans minded to 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:22.350
 provide the patient with comfort and well- 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.420
 being and here in Teresina there 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.050
 already specialized in this 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.349
 area 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:31.230
 almost establish a relationship of 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.750
 confidence is difficult, but when you 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.690
 patient and doctor is to be a 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.300
 fundamental link in this attempt to 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.700
 convey credibility and the maximum of 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.010
 comfort to their patients as the 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.920
 doctors are investing in the 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.500
 your doctor's office for the 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.510
 patient who will be most welcome and 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.629
 the professionals who work with this 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:57.649
 kind of setting the importance of a 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:01.730
 architect setting up office is 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:04.470
 just gives the feeling of comfort 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:07.080
 for patients 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.990
 besides the question of cleaning aesthetics 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.369
 organization that gives the environment is 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.950
 very important 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.619
 no b in the clinic in the area environment 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.930
 doctor 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:20.750
 out that the architect he cares about 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:25.049
 the smallest details eg the 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:27.570
 accessibility of the physical handicapped who 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.549
 is necessary in the clinic it is essential 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:33.150
 wheelchair then you have to let the 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:35.909
 necessary circulation a toilet has 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.710
 who is physically disabled 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.579
 you do from the beginning the architect already 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:43.350
 have all the worries met 

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:45.180
 some time it was believed that having 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.310
 white walls and some armchairs 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.470
 tables and chairs 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.060
 was enough to set up the 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.640
 waiting for an office 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:57.270
 today this concept has changed and all 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.409
 details are considered in the case of a 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.060
 clinic 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:03.090
 we can not use very strong colors 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.549
 have to be colors that really have the 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.650
 feeling of comfort then colors 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.890
 flower 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:12.650
 the most neutral pastel tones we do not 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.480
 You can use colors that I'm tired of 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.070
 the patient is beyond the patient 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.600
 able 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:20.060
 so he has to have that feeling of 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:22.910
 The optimum comfort is that the 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:25.820
 People wear size coats 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:27.800
 that the less you rejoin 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:30.110
 example in the case of toilets and 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.900
 the less grout the less dirt 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.280
 appearing and we have to use 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.110
 larger sizes not those 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.580
 small investments that extinguish accumulates 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.550
 a lot of dirt 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:42.440
 really the feeling of cleaning the 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:44.290
 possibilities of setting are 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.760
 explored in the most diverse forms 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:49.610
 always taking into account the 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:52.430
 balance between the pieces some objects 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:55.160
 such as aquariums, picture frames or 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:57.860
 TV set can also help 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:00.050
 make environments more responsive and 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:03.170
 make the waiting time more 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:03.980
 relaxed can use the tv in the living room 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:07.459
 wait 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:11.810
 logical for patients to spend time 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:13.370
 and such but nothing that can not have a sound 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:17.660
 very high 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:20.560
 environmentally friendly music to give a 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:24.470
 nice feeling but nothing what 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:25.940
 Said very environment that kan if the 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:28.100
 patient 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:30.440
 another device that helps to boost the 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:33.680
 environment is the use of 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:37.030
 differentiated textures and materials 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:41.480
 You can use wallpaper pictures 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:44.150
 sticker to give one with the drawings to 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:46.640
 do not stay do not fall in the same way do not stay 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:49.100
 only a painted wall understand then 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:52.820
 you run away from the sameness with some details 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:54.530
 decoration gives a conan points 

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:57.140
 o'brien decoration diary that does not 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:59.209
 get very polluted 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:00.950
 it is important to note that before 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:03.709
 realization of an ambition project 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:06.260
 it is necessary to take into account 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:08.450
 regard to the type of service he or she 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:12.049
 therefore offers a pediatrics practice 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:14.330
 will have a very different setting than 

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:16.870
 an office of endocrinology for 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:16.870
 example
