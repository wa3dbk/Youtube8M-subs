00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.040
 Komagane strong 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:11.480
 What I heard now is Mr. Surprise 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.900
 It's an overwintering speaker and I'm coming to the sound next 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.970

 Let's have a background painting! 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.930

 You hold your hand 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.659
 It is possible for a moment 

00:02:08.659 --> 00:02:11.659
 With a little bit full open 

00:02:12.869 --> 00:02:15.869

00:02:35.679 --> 00:02:36.829
 1 out 

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:39.829
 It is a plan to try to push the match 

00:02:40.539 --> 00:02:43.539
 I can not go down a lot 

00:02:43.539 --> 00:02:46.599
