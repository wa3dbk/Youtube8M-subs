00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:42.190 
the dirty air of your gun and Darren and

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:44.280 
the dirty air of your gun and Darren and
Darren<00:04:42.520> is<00:04:42.610> not<00:04:42.760> yeah<00:04:43.360> he's<00:04:43.690> got<00:04:43.840> an<00:04:43.930> overlap

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:44.290 
Darren is not yeah he's got an overlap

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:46.410

taste<00:05:06.430> is<00:05:06.580> flowing<00:05:06.910> down<00:05:07.060> nicely<00:05:07.360> now<00:05:07.780> if

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:07.900 
taste is flowing down nicely now if

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:09.300 
taste is flowing down nicely now if
you're<00:05:08.050> done<00:05:08.170> and<00:05:08.410> flunk<00:05:08.740> and<00:05:08.920> stay<00:05:09.070> ahead<00:05:09.190> of

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:09.310 
you're done and flunk and stay ahead of

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:10.620 
you're done and flunk and stay ahead of
me<00:05:09.550> show<00:05:09.730> I<00:05:09.880> think<00:05:10.090> blue<00:05:10.240> is<00:05:10.270> in<00:05:10.480> a<00:05:10.540> good

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:10.630 
me show I think blue is in a good

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:15.540 
me show I think blue is in a good
position<00:05:10.690> actually<00:05:13.260> yeah<00:05:14.260> as<00:05:14.440> a<00:05:14.470> tack<00:05:14.860> you<00:05:15.400> can

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:15.550 
position actually yeah as a tack you can

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:18.480 
position actually yeah as a tack you can
see<00:05:15.790> that<00:05:16.060> tice<00:05:16.930> was<00:05:17.620> pretty<00:05:18.040> close<00:05:18.280> to<00:05:18.460> the

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:18.490 
see that tice was pretty close to the

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:20.070 
see that tice was pretty close to the
load<00:05:18.730> on<00:05:18.760> I<00:05:18.940> think<00:05:19.030> he's<00:05:19.240> actually<00:05:19.390> very<00:05:19.570> close

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:20.080 
load on I think he's actually very close

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:21.510 
load on I think he's actually very close
you<00:05:20.290> could<00:05:20.380> make<00:05:20.620> the<00:05:20.650> finish<00:05:21.100> from<00:05:21.190> where<00:05:21.400> he

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:21.520 
you could make the finish from where he

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:23.520 
you could make the finish from where he
is<00:05:21.700> but<00:05:22.150> he's<00:05:22.270> giving<00:05:22.600> down<00:05:22.780> a<00:05:22.810> lot<00:05:23.170> of<00:05:23.320> dirty

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:23.530 
is but he's giving down a lot of dirty

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:25.620 
is but he's giving down a lot of dirty
air<00:05:23.770> and<00:05:24.160> now<00:05:24.460> we<00:05:24.520> have<00:05:24.700> to<00:05:24.820> try<00:05:25.030> and<00:05:25.090> swap<00:05:25.420> over

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:25.630 
air and now we have to try and swap over

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:27.030 
air and now we have to try and swap over
and<00:05:25.810> decide<00:05:26.200> whether<00:05:26.350> he's<00:05:26.590> going<00:05:26.710> to<00:05:26.800> try<00:05:27.010> and

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:27.040 
and decide whether he's going to try and

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:29.610 
and decide whether he's going to try and
cover<00:05:27.280> two<00:05:27.850> votes<00:05:28.150> partly<00:05:28.690> or<00:05:28.870> cover<00:05:29.170> one<00:05:29.410> boat

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:29.620 
cover two votes partly or cover one boat

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:31.530 
cover two votes partly or cover one boat
properly<00:05:30.040> and<00:05:30.490> it<00:05:30.610> looks<00:05:30.820> at<00:05:30.940> this<00:05:31.090> stage<00:05:31.300> like

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:31.540 
properly and it looks at this stage like

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:33.659 
properly and it looks at this stage like
he's<00:05:31.750> really<00:05:32.410> getting<00:05:32.950> on<00:05:33.250> doing<00:05:33.520> any

00:05:33.659 --> 00:05:33.669 
he's really getting on doing any

00:05:33.669 --> 00:05:35.730 
he's really getting on doing any
slowdown<00:05:34.150> he's<00:05:34.330> be<00:05:34.630> stuck<00:05:34.930> yeah<00:05:35.290> and<00:05:35.500> he<00:05:35.560> can't

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:35.740 
slowdown he's be stuck yeah and he can't

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:37.050 
slowdown he's be stuck yeah and he can't
do<00:05:35.830> anything<00:05:35.860> anymore<00:05:36.220> now<00:05:36.520> because<00:05:36.910> it's

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:37.060 
do anything anymore now because it's

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:39.180 
do anything anymore now because it's
darren<00:05:37.419> he<00:05:37.540> can't<00:05:37.750> tack<00:05:37.990> and<00:05:38.230> it<00:05:38.980> looks<00:05:39.130> like

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:39.190 
darren he can't tack and it looks like

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:40.530 
darren he can't tack and it looks like
down<00:05:39.460> is<00:05:39.640> on<00:05:39.730> ley<00:05:39.880> line<00:05:40.090> so<00:05:40.270> they're<00:05:40.390> both

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:40.540 
down is on ley line so they're both

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:42.690 
down is on ley line so they're both
laying<00:05:40.750> that<00:05:40.990> where<00:05:41.500> is<00:05:41.680> worth<00:05:42.040> team<00:05:42.340> sky<00:05:42.640> is

going are they gonna cross the finish
line<00:05:43.870> and<00:05:44.310> it<00:05:45.310> looks<00:05:45.550> like<00:05:45.640> they<00:05:45.910> are<00:05:45.940> and<00:05:46.240> if

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:46.630 
line and it looks like they are and if

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:48.120 
line and it looks like they are and if
Darren<00:05:46.990> can<00:05:47.140> just<00:05:47.350> cross<00:05:47.590> that<00:05:47.620> finish<00:05:47.950> line

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:48.130 
Darren can just cross that finish line

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:49.950 
Darren can just cross that finish line
well<00:05:48.880> how<00:05:48.970> this<00:05:49.090> is<00:05:49.210> really<00:05:49.450> take<00:05:49.660> this<00:05:49.780> will

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:49.960 
well how this is really take this will

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:51.690 
well how this is really take this will
actually<00:05:50.110> I<00:05:50.440> can't<00:05:51.100> see<00:05:51.250> where<00:05:51.400> the<00:05:51.520> other

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:51.700 
actually I can't see where the other

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:54.180 
actually I can't see where the other
line<00:05:51.910> is<00:05:52.090> but<00:05:52.540> I<00:05:52.600> think<00:05:52.930> days<00:05:53.530> can't<00:05:53.860> really<00:05:54.070> do

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:54.190 
line is but I think days can't really do

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:56.370 
line is but I think days can't really do
much<00:05:54.220> but<00:05:55.120> slow<00:05:55.390> down<00:05:55.630> and<00:05:55.870> they're<00:05:56.080> across
