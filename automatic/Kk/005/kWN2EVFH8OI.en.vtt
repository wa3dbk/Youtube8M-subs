00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
was a mole xsplit for a fame which I'm

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.930 
was a mole xsplit for a fame which I'm
not<00:00:33.420> using<00:00:33.660> anymore<00:00:33.989> and<00:00:34.430> then<00:00:35.430> I<00:00:35.520> cut<00:00:35.700> it<00:00:35.820> off

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
minus obviously and then after that I

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.209 
minus obviously and then after that I
connected<00:00:42.270> it<00:00:42.390> to<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:43.110> box<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:43.980> little

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:04.010 
anyways i also have somebody sitting now
under<00:02:00.000> my<00:02:00.119> table<00:02:01.020> my<00:02:01.409> disc<00:02:01.790> just<00:02:02.840> two<00:02:03.840> halves

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
under my table my disc just two halves

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.889 
under my table my disc just two halves
makes<00:02:04.259> a<00:02:04.350> light<00:02:04.500> and<00:02:04.939> though<00:02:05.939> it's<00:02:06.270> not<00:02:06.390> power

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
makes a light and though it's not power

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.919 
makes a light and though it's not power
well<00:02:07.380> it's<00:02:07.560> not<00:02:07.740> power<00:02:08.420> well<00:02:09.420> it<00:02:09.539> is<00:02:09.690> power

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
well it's not power well it is power

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.809 
well it's not power well it is power
efficient<00:02:10.530> but<00:02:10.679> it's<00:02:10.770> not<00:02:10.920> like<00:02:11.099> so<00:02:11.370> going<00:02:11.580> to

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
efficient but it's not like so going to

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.430 
efficient but it's not like so going to
drain<00:02:12.360> out<00:02:12.569> of<00:02:12.780> it<00:02:12.959> so

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
drain out of it so

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.230 
drain out of it so
it's<00:02:14.070> looking<00:02:14.430> really<00:02:14.580> real<00:02:14.790> nice<00:02:14.970> and

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
it's looking really real nice and

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.200 
it's looking really real nice and
there's<00:02:16.200> not<00:02:16.410> too<00:02:16.650> much<00:02:16.800> power<00:02:17.670> shot<00:02:18.030> in

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.210 
there's not too much power shot in

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:20.540 
there's not too much power shot in
coming<00:02:18.510> from<00:02:18.660> its<00:02:18.840> and<00:02:18.990> facilities<00:02:19.530> so<00:02:20.190> um

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
coming from its and facilities so um

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.440 
coming from its and facilities so um
yeah<00:02:21.450> that's<00:02:21.990> uh<00:02:22.140> that's<00:02:23.210> basically<00:02:24.210> what<00:02:24.420> i

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
yeah that's uh that's basically what i

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.720 
yeah that's uh that's basically what i
have<00:02:24.600> for<00:02:24.720> now<00:02:24.780> oh<00:02:24.960> yeah<00:02:25.200> before<00:02:25.680> i<00:02:25.710> usually<00:02:26.580> do

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
have for now oh yeah before i usually do

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.990 
have for now oh yeah before i usually do
that<00:02:27.710> so<00:02:28.710> we<00:02:28.830> can<00:02:28.950> find<00:02:29.190> it<00:02:29.310> again<00:02:29.400> there<00:02:29.820> we<00:02:29.880> go

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
that so we can find it again there we go

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.110 
that so we can find it again there we go
normally<00:02:30.930> comes<00:02:31.140> in<00:02:31.350> the<00:02:31.440> split<00:02:31.670> so<00:02:32.670> you<00:02:32.730> can

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
normally comes in the split so you can

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.870 
normally comes in the split so you can
attach<00:02:33.840> it<00:02:34.020> and<00:02:34.230> cut<00:02:34.590> it<00:02:34.620> down<00:02:34.890> as<00:02:35.220> you<00:02:35.340> want<00:02:35.610> to

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
attach it and cut it down as you want to

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.030 
attach it and cut it down as you want to
and<00:02:36.150> other<00:02:36.450> stuff<00:02:36.720> this<00:02:37.410> one<00:02:37.590> I<00:02:37.620> got<00:02:37.860> right

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
meter cannot remember how much that is

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.990 
meter cannot remember how much that is

to buy the extra one which is five

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:48.530 
to buy the extra one which is five
meters<00:02:47.070> there's<00:02:47.280> also<00:02:47.460> next<00:02:47.820> up<00:02:48.030> past<00:02:48.270> one

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
meters there's also next up past one

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.270 
meters there's also next up past one
just<00:02:48.780> going<00:02:48.930> to<00:02:49.050> show<00:02:49.380> you<00:02:49.530> guys<00:02:49.650> that<00:02:49.710> pumps

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
just going to show you guys that pumps

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.070 
just going to show you guys that pumps
out<00:02:50.400> on<00:02:50.550> all<00:02:51.000> the<00:02:51.120> cables<00:02:51.480> going<00:02:51.570> down<00:02:51.900> right

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
out on all the cables going down right

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.520 
out on all the cables going down right
now<00:02:53.180> this<00:02:54.180> one<00:02:54.420> we<00:02:54.570> have<00:02:54.600> a<00:02:54.930> bigger<00:02:55.320> power

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
now this one we have a bigger power

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.700 
now this one we have a bigger power
supply<00:02:55.860> going<00:02:56.190> on<00:02:56.340> it's<00:02:56.580> not<00:02:56.640> batteries

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:57.710 
supply going on it's not batteries

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:59.750 
supply going on it's not batteries
basically<00:02:58.710> because<00:02:58.980> the<00:02:59.010> power<00:02:59.280> supply<00:02:59.460> is<00:02:59.610> a

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
basically because the power supply is a

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.130 
basically because the power supply is a
little<00:02:59.970> bit<00:03:00.090> bigger<00:03:00.270> for<00:03:00.390> this<00:03:00.630> one's<00:03:00.840> bills

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
little bit bigger for this one's bills

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.350 
little bit bigger for this one's bills
because<00:03:01.500> there<00:03:01.890> was<00:03:01.980> more<00:03:02.370> cable<00:03:02.820> to<00:03:03.030> it<00:03:03.060> so

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
because there was more cable to it so

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.270 
because there was more cable to it so
obviously<00:03:03.780> literally<00:03:04.380> it's<00:03:05.250> the<00:03:05.340> more<00:03:05.520> power

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
obviously literally it's the more power

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.800 
obviously literally it's the more power
did<00:03:08.280> this<00:03:08.700> thing<00:03:08.940> right<00:03:09.180> here<00:03:09.210> as<00:03:09.420> well<00:03:09.600> you

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
did this thing right here as well you

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.590 
did this thing right here as well you
can<00:03:09.960> attach<00:03:10.410> more<00:03:10.800> cables<00:03:11.340> too<00:03:11.550> I<00:03:11.850> don't<00:03:12.480> know

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
can attach more cables too I don't know

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.950 
can attach more cables too I don't know
if<00:03:12.660> it's<00:03:13.350> going<00:03:13.500> to<00:03:13.560> be<00:03:14.480> working<00:03:15.480> correctly

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:15.960 
if it's going to be working correctly

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:19.699 
if it's going to be working correctly
