artificial waxes in it and it looks
pretty<00:00:35.340> cool<00:00:35.489> i<00:00:35.700> think<00:00:35.969> the<00:00:36.090> packaging<00:00:36.480> is

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
pretty cool i think the packaging is

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.450 
pretty cool i think the packaging is
really<00:00:36.630> nice<00:00:37.050> it's<00:00:38.010> kind<00:00:38.190> of<00:00:38.250> different

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
really nice it's kind of different

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.400 
really nice it's kind of different
because<00:00:38.730> it's<00:00:39.030> a<00:00:39.120> black<00:00:39.390> and<00:00:39.690> pink<00:00:39.930> tube<00:00:40.200> it's

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
because it's a black and pink tube it's

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.049 
because it's a black and pink tube it's
not<00:00:40.559> like<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:40.890> pink<00:00:41.100> and<00:00:41.250> green<00:00:41.460> from<00:00:41.790> Great

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
not like the pink and green from Great

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.030 
not like the pink and green from Great
Lash<00:00:42.239> okay<00:00:42.780> so<00:00:42.840> here's<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.320> one<00:00:43.530> straight

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
Lash okay so here's the one straight

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.010 
Lash okay so here's the one straight
away<00:00:44.250> I<00:00:44.280> notice<00:00:44.489> it<00:00:44.910> has<00:00:44.940> a<00:00:45.059> little<00:00:45.420> bit<00:00:45.539> excess

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.569 
away I notice it has a little bit excess
mascara<00:00:46.260> at<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:46.950> end<00:00:47.070> so<00:00:47.190> I'm<00:00:47.250> just<00:00:47.370> going<00:00:47.520> to

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
mascara at the end so I'm just going to

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.790 
mascara at the end so I'm just going to
wipe<00:00:47.700> that<00:00:47.940> off<00:00:48.140> the<00:00:49.140> brush<00:00:49.289> looks<00:00:49.559> really

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
wipe that off the brush looks really

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.680 
wipe that off the brush looks really
nice<00:00:49.950> though<00:00:50.190> it<00:00:50.340> has<00:00:50.520> traditional<00:00:51.239> bristles

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
nice though it has traditional bristles

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.049 
nice though it has traditional bristles
and<00:00:51.989> it<00:00:52.379> looks<00:00:52.559> like<00:00:52.620> it's<00:00:52.739> pretty<00:00:53.039> dense<00:00:53.370> so

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
and it looks like it's pretty dense so

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.850 
and it looks like it's pretty dense so
I'm<00:00:54.180> expecting<00:00:54.449> it<00:00:54.870> to<00:00:54.989> do<00:00:55.110> good<00:00:55.350> things<00:00:55.379> i

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
I'm expecting it to do good things i

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.560 
I'm expecting it to do good things i
really<00:00:55.890> like<00:00:56.190> traditional<00:00:56.879> bristle<00:00:57.300> brushes

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
really like traditional bristle brushes

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.410 
really like traditional bristle brushes
so<00:00:58.410> right<00:00:58.949> away<00:00:59.100> I'm<00:00:59.520> noticing<00:00:59.910> that<00:01:00.180> this

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
so right away I'm noticing that this

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.860 
so right away I'm noticing that this
feels<00:01:00.719> really<00:01:01.170> dry<00:01:02.030> more<00:01:03.030> dry<00:01:03.390> than<00:01:03.420> other

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
feels really dry more dry than other

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.870 
feels really dry more dry than other
great<00:01:04.170> lash<00:01:04.379> mascara<00:01:04.680> as<00:01:05.159> I've<00:01:05.339> tried<00:01:05.670> in<00:01:05.820> the

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
great lash mascara as I've tried in the

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.440 
great lash mascara as I've tried in the
past<00:01:06.119> I<00:01:06.630> don't<00:01:07.260> really<00:01:07.439> know<00:01:07.890> if<00:01:08.280> I<00:01:08.850> like<00:01:09.180> that

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
past I don't really know if I like that

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:10.760 
past I don't really know if I like that
because<00:01:09.689> I<00:01:09.840> feel<00:01:10.140> like<00:01:10.170> it's<00:01:10.409> not<00:01:10.560> really

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
because I feel like it's not really

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.679 
because I feel like it's not really
doing<00:01:11.010> anything<00:01:11.430> right<00:01:11.760> now<00:01:11.820> this<00:01:12.450> doesn't

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
doing anything right now this doesn't

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.420 
doing anything right now this doesn't
even<00:01:12.930> feel<00:01:13.229> very<00:01:13.470> lengthening<00:01:14.010> I<00:01:14.130> don't<00:01:14.280> feel

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
even feel very lengthening I don't feel

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.730 
even feel very lengthening I don't feel
like<00:01:14.549> it's<00:01:14.729> doing<00:01:14.939> much<00:01:15.390> to<00:01:15.689> my<00:01:15.810> lashes<00:01:16.110> other

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
like it's doing much to my lashes other

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.190 
like it's doing much to my lashes other
than<00:01:17.090> tinting<00:01:18.090> them<00:01:18.270> like<00:01:18.540> black<00:01:18.930> of<00:01:19.170> course

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
than tinting them like black of course

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.820 
than tinting them like black of course
because<00:01:19.920> this<00:01:20.100> formula<00:01:20.610> is<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:21.060> very<00:01:21.299> black

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:21.830 
because this formula is the very black

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.609 
because this formula is the very black
color<00:01:22.830> but<00:01:23.340> i<00:01:23.610> don't<00:01:23.970> really<00:01:24.689> like<00:01:24.840> anything

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
color but i don't really like anything

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.530 
color but i don't really like anything
else<00:01:25.740> it's<00:01:25.979> doing<00:01:26.310> to<00:01:26.340> my<00:01:26.580> lashes<00:01:26.850> I<00:01:27.240> feel<00:01:27.420> like

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
else it's doing to my lashes I feel like

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.499 
else it's doing to my lashes I feel like
it's<00:01:27.750> not<00:01:28.020> even<00:01:28.920> lengthening<00:01:29.820> them<00:01:30.030> it's<00:01:30.299> just

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
it's not even lengthening them it's just

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.590 
it's not even lengthening them it's just
barely<00:01:30.960> giving<00:01:31.829> me<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.460> most<00:01:32.729> like<00:01:33.000> natural

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
barely giving me the most like natural

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.469 
barely giving me the most like natural
looking<00:01:33.930> lashes<00:01:34.680> it's<00:01:35.159> definitely<00:01:35.759> not<00:01:35.939> like

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
looking lashes it's definitely not like

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.679 
looking lashes it's definitely not like
a<00:01:36.509> big<00:01:36.810> impact<00:01:37.259> like<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.829> name<00:01:38.670> says<00:01:39.030> ok<00:01:39.630> so

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
a big impact like the name says ok so

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.359 
a big impact like the name says ok so
that's<00:01:39.960> about<00:01:40.079> three<00:01:40.470> codes<00:01:40.770> and<00:01:41.070> I<00:01:41.130> feel<00:01:41.340> like

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
that's about three codes and I feel like

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.940 
that's about three codes and I feel like
I<00:01:41.640> can't<00:01:41.909> really<00:01:42.119> do<00:01:42.360> much<00:01:42.390> more<00:01:42.899> because<00:01:43.350> the

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
I can't really do much more because the

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.130 
I can't really do much more because the
formula<00:01:44.399> starting<00:01:44.820> to<00:01:44.970> dry<00:01:45.299> and<00:01:45.600> I<00:01:45.750> notice

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
formula starting to dry and I notice

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.740 
formula starting to dry and I notice
that<00:01:46.380> you<00:01:46.439> know<00:01:47.280> it<00:01:47.430> said<00:01:47.610> not<00:01:47.790> to<00:01:48.030> apply<00:01:48.390> coats

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
that you know it said not to apply coats

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.170 
that you know it said not to apply coats
when<00:01:49.020> dry<00:01:49.290> and<00:01:49.590> it<00:01:50.040> does<00:01:50.250> feel<00:01:50.549> like<00:01:50.790> if<00:01:50.970> I<00:01:51.119> do

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
when dry and it does feel like if I do

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.630 
when dry and it does feel like if I do
that<00:01:51.479> it's<00:01:51.720> going<00:01:52.020> to<00:01:52.110> clump<00:01:52.470> so<00:01:52.799> I'm<00:01:53.369> just

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
that it's going to clump so I'm just

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.580 
that it's going to clump so I'm just
going<00:01:53.759> to<00:01:53.850> leave<00:01:54.060> it<00:01:54.090> at<00:01:54.299> that<00:01:54.329> and<00:01:54.540> I'm<00:01:55.020> so<00:01:55.409> not

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
going to leave it at that and I'm so not

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.350 
going to leave it at that and I'm so not
impressed<00:01:55.979> like<00:01:56.189> this<00:01:56.369> is<00:01:56.520> really<00:01:56.850> really

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
impressed like this is really really

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.120 
impressed like this is really really
lame<00:01:57.719> so<00:01:58.049> I<00:01:58.079> just<00:01:58.439> saved<00:01:58.619> the<00:01:58.799> day<00:01:58.950> with<00:01:59.070> a

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
lame so I just saved the day with a

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.889 
lame so I just saved the day with a
little<00:01:59.340> bit<00:01:59.490> of<00:01:59.549> maybelline<00:02:00.090> colossal<00:02:00.479> there

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
and I'm just so unimpressed with this

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
anything it didn't even really give me

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.350 
anything it didn't even really give me
volume<00:02:07.409> which<00:02:07.590> is<00:02:07.740> its<00:02:07.920> main<00:02:08.099> claim<00:02:08.489> here<00:02:08.849> so

here's<00:03:07.260> what<00:03:07.439> the<00:03:07.560> one<00:03:07.709> looks<00:03:07.950> like<00:03:08.010> and<00:03:08.400> it

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 
here's what the one looks like and it

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:10.429 
here's what the one looks like and it
definitely<00:03:08.730> does<00:03:09.209> have<00:03:09.389> a<00:03:09.450> ball<00:03:09.840> tip<00:03:10.230> at<00:03:10.409> the

00:03:10.429 --> 00:03:10.439 
definitely does have a ball tip at the

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:11.750 
definitely does have a ball tip at the
end<00:03:10.560> I've<00:03:10.739> never<00:03:10.950> seen<00:03:11.189> anything<00:03:11.459> like<00:03:11.579> that

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
end I've never seen anything like that

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.210 
end I've never seen anything like that
in<00:03:12.269> a<00:03:12.659> brow<00:03:12.900> product<00:03:13.439> before<00:03:13.590> I<00:03:13.769> think<00:03:14.040> that's

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
in a brow product before I think that's

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.069 
in a brow product before I think that's
kind<00:03:14.489> of<00:03:14.549> interesting<00:03:14.849> so<00:03:15.269> there<00:03:15.540> is<00:03:15.720> the<00:03:15.900> one

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:16.079 
kind of interesting so there is the one

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:17.689 
kind of interesting so there is the one
up<00:03:16.319> close<00:03:16.530> it<00:03:16.859> kind<00:03:17.040> of<00:03:17.099> looks<00:03:17.280> funny<00:03:17.579> with

00:03:17.689 --> 00:03:17.699 
up close it kind of looks funny with

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:19.430 
up close it kind of looks funny with
that<00:03:17.849> little<00:03:18.150> tip<00:03:18.510> at<00:03:18.690> the<00:03:18.750> end<00:03:18.870> I<00:03:19.169> think<00:03:19.379> it

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
that little tip at the end I think it

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:20.990 
that little tip at the end I think it
looks<00:03:19.650> funny<00:03:19.889> I<00:03:19.979> don't<00:03:20.099> know<00:03:20.310> it<00:03:20.760> kind<00:03:20.970> of

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
looks funny I don't know it kind of

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.610 
looks funny I don't know it kind of
looks<00:03:21.150> like<00:03:21.209> a<00:03:21.299> light<00:03:21.599> bulb<00:03:21.780> with<00:03:22.049> the<00:03:22.169> mascara

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
looks like a light bulb with the mascara

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
waxy or anything which is awesome but I

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:51.770 
waxy or anything which is awesome but I
don't<00:03:50.519> notice<00:03:50.669> that<00:03:50.940> it<00:03:51.060> really<00:03:51.209> tints<00:03:51.629> them

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780

drying and this is 549 at target so it's

a<00:06:17.370> pretty<00:06:17.580> good<00:06:17.759> deal<00:06:17.820> for<00:06:18.300> a<00:06:18.360> non-drying

00:06:19.159 --> 00:06:19.169

I have to say you know this does have a
little<00:06:32.740> bit<00:06:32.860> of<00:06:32.950> shine<00:06:33.310> in<00:06:33.610> real<00:06:34.450> life<00:06:34.690> you<00:06:34.900> can

may<00:06:38.320> be<00:06:38.380> and<00:06:38.620> just<00:06:38.680> watch<00:06:39.040> it'll<00:06:39.310> show<00:06:39.490> up

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:39.610 
may be and just watch it'll show up

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:42.540 
may be and just watch it'll show up
better<00:06:40.080> but<00:06:41.080> it's<00:06:41.230> not<00:06:41.320> a<00:06:41.500> true<00:06:41.950> matte<00:06:42.190> finish

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:42.550 
better but it's not a true matte finish

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:45.120 
better but it's not a true matte finish
it<00:06:42.730> does<00:06:42.940> look<00:06:43.240> Matt<00:06:43.930> enough<00:06:44.440> they'll<00:06:44.740> see<00:06:45.010> how

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:45.130 
it does look Matt enough they'll see how

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:47.190 
it does look Matt enough they'll see how
it<00:06:45.250> just<00:06:45.280> glistens<00:06:45.640> a<00:06:46.060> tiny<00:06:46.480> bit<00:06:46.750> just<00:06:46.990> like

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:47.200 
it just glistens a tiny bit just like

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:49.500 
it just glistens a tiny bit just like
ever<00:06:47.470> so<00:06:47.830> slightly<00:06:48.220> it's<00:06:48.550> a<00:06:48.610> very<00:06:48.880> very<00:06:48.970> subtle

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:49.510 
ever so slightly it's a very very subtle

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:51.060 
ever so slightly it's a very very subtle
shine<00:06:49.720> though<00:06:49.960> so<00:06:50.200> I<00:06:50.230> feel<00:06:50.500> like<00:06:50.650> if<00:06:50.860> we<00:06:51.010> were

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:51.070 
shine though so I feel like if we were

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:53.310 
shine though so I feel like if we were
back<00:06:51.100> like<00:06:51.610> far<00:06:51.910> away<00:06:51.940> it<00:06:52.510> does<00:06:52.960> look<00:06:52.990> like<00:06:53.140> a

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:53.320 
back like far away it does look like a

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:55.050 
back like far away it does look like a
matte<00:06:53.590> finish<00:06:53.620> so<00:06:53.950> it's<00:06:54.280> nothing<00:06:54.610> like<00:06:54.790> to

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:55.060 
matte finish so it's nothing like to

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:57.210 
matte finish so it's nothing like to
extreme<00:06:55.600> I'm<00:06:55.780> not<00:06:55.930> going<00:06:56.110> to<00:06:56.170> like<00:06:56.320> dis<00:06:56.980> this

00:06:57.210 --> 00:06:57.220 
extreme I'm not going to like dis this

00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:59.220 
extreme I'm not going to like dis this
because<00:06:57.550> it's<00:06:57.730> not<00:06:57.820> true<00:06:58.120> mad<00:06:58.450> or<00:06:58.600> anything<00:06:58.630> I

00:06:59.220 --> 00:06:59.230 
because it's not true mad or anything I

00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:02.070 
because it's not true mad or anything I
actually<00:06:59.740> think<00:07:00.040> that's<00:07:00.610> why<00:07:01.000> the<00:07:01.450> formula

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:02.080 
actually think that's why the formula

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:03.870 
actually think that's why the formula
feels<00:07:02.380> so<00:07:02.650> creamiest<00:07:03.100> because<00:07:03.490> it<00:07:03.670> has<00:07:03.850> a

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:03.880 
feels so creamiest because it has a

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:06.870 
feels so creamiest because it has a
little<00:07:04.240> bit<00:07:04.360> of<00:07:04.420> slick<00:07:04.780> to<00:07:05.020> it<00:07:05.170> and<00:07:05.430> it<00:07:06.430> doesn't

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:06.880 
little bit of slick to it and it doesn't

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:08.430 
little bit of slick to it and it doesn't
run<00:07:07.180> it<00:07:07.420> doesn't<00:07:07.810> feel<00:07:07.930> like<00:07:08.080> it's<00:07:08.230> going<00:07:08.380> to

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:08.440 
run it doesn't feel like it's going to

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:09.780 
run it doesn't feel like it's going to
