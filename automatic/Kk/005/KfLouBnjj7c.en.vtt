test<00:00:17.880> i<00:00:18.029> don't<00:00:18.210> really<00:00:18.300> believe<00:00:18.690> in<00:00:18.840> world

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
test i don't really believe in world

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.769 
test i don't really believe in world
tests<00:00:19.350> anyways<00:00:19.770> there's<00:00:20.189> too<00:00:20.310> many<00:00:20.430> variables

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:20.779 
tests anyways there's too many variables

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:23.029 
tests anyways there's too many variables
but<00:00:21.779> another<00:00:21.990> reason<00:00:22.080> why<00:00:22.439> i<00:00:22.470> took<00:00:22.619> them<00:00:22.890> off

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
but another reason why i took them off

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.410 
but another reason why i took them off
is<00:00:23.340> because<00:00:24.140> three<00:00:25.140> of<00:00:25.170> my<00:00:25.619> g6<00:00:26.369> wise<00:00:26.550> i<00:00:26.849> had<00:00:27.269> to

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
is because three of my g6 wise i had to

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.800 
is because three of my g6 wise i had to
convert<00:00:27.840> to<00:00:28.529> backless<00:00:29.010> so<00:00:29.880> i<00:00:29.910> wanted<00:00:30.240> to<00:00:30.390> show

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810

bearing inside but you can also see like
a<00:00:42.960> little<00:00:43.230> bit<00:00:43.350> of<00:00:43.440> a<00:00:43.530> groove<00:00:43.890> in<00:00:44.750> there<00:00:45.750> on

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
a little bit of a groove in there on

see<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.329> bit<00:00:48.450> of<00:00:48.539> groove<00:00:48.780> now<00:00:49.200> this<00:00:49.500> is<00:00:49.800> the

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 
see the bit of groove now this is the

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:57.020 
see the bit of groove now this is the
backless<00:00:51.030> one<00:00:51.800> see<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:52.920> difference<00:00:55.910> that<00:00:56.910> was

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
backless one see the difference that was

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.689 
backless one see the difference that was
very<00:00:57.090> simple<00:00:57.570> to<00:00:57.660> do<00:00:57.890> what<00:00:58.890> happened<00:00:59.250> was<00:00:59.370> when

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
very simple to do what happened was when

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.200 
very simple to do what happened was when
I<00:00:59.730> got<00:01:00.570> these<00:01:00.809> wheels<00:01:01.489> the<00:01:02.489> person<00:01:02.820> I<00:01:02.879> got<00:01:03.059> them

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
I got these wheels the person I got them

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.359 
I got these wheels the person I got them
from<00:01:03.359> already<00:01:03.629> warned<00:01:03.960> me<00:01:04.110> that<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.920> backs

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
from already warned me that the backs

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.300 
from already warned me that the backs
have<00:01:05.580> fallen<00:01:05.850> off<00:01:06.000> and<00:01:06.650> he<00:01:07.650> just<00:01:07.890> popped<00:01:08.100> the

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
have fallen off and he just popped the

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.500 
have fallen off and he just popped the
bearings<00:01:08.640> back<00:01:08.820> in<00:01:09.000> and<00:01:09.150> said<00:01:09.270> they<00:01:09.360> worked

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
bearings back in and said they worked

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.050 
bearings back in and said they worked
fine<00:01:09.810> which<00:01:10.320> they<00:01:10.500> did<00:01:10.530> at<00:01:10.799> first<00:01:10.830> but<00:01:11.460> then

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
fine which they did at first but then

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.750 
fine which they did at first but then
every<00:01:12.420> three<00:01:13.229> or<00:01:13.260> four<00:01:13.439> tricks<00:01:13.979> you<00:01:14.520> have<00:01:14.640> to

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
every three or four tricks you have to

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.690 
every three or four tricks you have to
always<00:01:14.939> readjust<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:15.990> wheel<00:01:16.170> to<00:01:16.920> put<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.310> the

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
always readjust the wheel to put the the

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.840 
always readjust the wheel to put the the
bearing<00:01:17.970> back<00:01:18.150> so<00:01:18.900> what<00:01:19.049> I<00:01:19.080> did<00:01:19.229> was<00:01:19.820> I<00:01:20.820> took

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
bearing back so what I did was I took

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.020 
bearing back so what I did was I took
the<00:01:21.150> bearings<00:01:21.420> out<00:01:21.600> and<00:01:22.250> I<00:01:23.250> took<00:01:23.310> a<00:01:23.490> paperclip

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
the bearings out and I took a paperclip

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.649 
the bearings out and I took a paperclip
and<00:01:24.770> I<00:01:25.770> bent<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:26.250> paper<00:01:26.490> clip<00:01:26.700> down<00:01:26.729> and<00:01:27.270> I<00:01:27.630> put

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
and I bent the paper clip down and I put

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.649 
and I bent the paper clip down and I put
the<00:01:27.960> bearing<00:01:28.409> on<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:29.280> paper<00:01:29.460> clip<00:01:29.700> so<00:01:29.850> you<00:01:30.150> you

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
the bearing on the paper clip so you you

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.090 
the bearing on the paper clip so you you
know<00:01:30.930> so<00:01:31.350> it<00:01:31.530> would<00:01:31.740> act<00:01:32.310> as<00:01:32.520> an<00:01:32.670> axle<00:01:33.150> and

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
know so it would act as an axle and

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.230 
know so it would act as an axle and
before<00:01:35.100> doing<00:01:35.280> that<00:01:35.369> I<00:01:35.520> took<00:01:35.640> some<00:01:35.909> superglue

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
before doing that I took some superglue

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.719 
before doing that I took some superglue
on<00:01:36.630> a<00:01:36.720> sheet<00:01:37.259> of<00:01:37.290> paper<00:01:37.500> and<00:01:37.860> dab<00:01:38.579> the

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
on a sheet of paper and dab the

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.910 
on a sheet of paper and dab the
superglue<00:01:39.119> on<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.299> sheet<00:01:39.450> of<00:01:39.479> paper<00:01:39.689> but<00:01:40.500> not

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
superglue on the sheet of paper but not

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.370 
superglue on the sheet of paper but not
so<00:01:41.100> that<00:01:41.250> it<00:01:41.340> was<00:01:41.460> clumpy<00:01:41.939> more<00:01:42.329> smooth<00:01:43.049> out

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
so that it was clumpy more smooth out

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.020 
so that it was clumpy more smooth out
because<00:01:44.280> what<00:01:44.460> you're<00:01:44.579> going<00:01:44.729> to<00:01:44.790> do<00:01:44.939> is

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
because what you're going to do is

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.240 
because what you're going to do is
you're<00:01:45.090> going<00:01:45.210> to<00:01:45.270> get<00:01:45.390> the<00:01:45.630> your<00:01:46.560> axle<00:01:47.040> or

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
you're going to get the your axle or

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.889 
you're going to get the your axle or
paperclip<00:01:47.610> with<00:01:48.000> a<00:01:48.240> bearing<00:01:48.540> line<00:01:48.659> and

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
paperclip with a bearing line and

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.480 
paperclip with a bearing line and
lightly<00:01:49.250> roll<00:01:50.250> it<00:01:50.430> over<00:01:50.899> the<00:01:51.899> superglue

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
lightly roll it over the superglue

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.410 
lightly roll it over the superglue
making<00:01:53.490> sure<00:01:53.640> that<00:01:53.790> the<00:01:53.909> glue<00:01:54.060> doesn't<00:01:54.210> go

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
making sure that the glue doesn't go

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.149 
making sure that the glue doesn't go
inside<00:01:54.930> the<00:01:55.140> bearing<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.740> balls<00:01:55.950> of<00:01:56.130> the

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
inside the bearing the balls of the

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.389 
inside the bearing the balls of the
bearing<00:01:56.490> or<00:01:56.610> else<00:01:56.729> you're<00:01:57.540> effed<00:01:58.310> so<00:01:59.310> you

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
bearing or else you're effed so you

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.149 
bearing or else you're effed so you
lightly<00:01:59.610> do<00:01:59.939> that<00:02:00.119> and<00:02:00.500> then<00:02:01.500> once<00:02:01.740> it's<00:02:01.890> you

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159

the rough side of the washer because
rock<00:03:12.250> washers<00:03:12.820> have<00:03:13.000> a<00:03:13.240> rough<00:03:13.450> side<00:03:13.690> and<00:03:13.959> a

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:14.050 
rock washers have a rough side and a

rock washers have a rough side and a
smooth<00:03:14.350> side<00:03:14.620> and<00:03:15.340> when<00:03:15.490> I<00:03:15.520> got<00:03:15.760> these<00:03:16.030> there

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780

smooth side and when I got these there
was<00:03:16.959> real<00:03:17.470> residue<00:03:18.160> on<00:03:18.190> the<00:03:18.550> rough<00:03:18.850> side<00:03:18.880> of
