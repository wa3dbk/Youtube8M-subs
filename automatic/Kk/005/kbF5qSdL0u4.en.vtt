00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
shake it vigorously and it should form

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.429

bubbles at the top of the bottle and
that's<00:01:13.560> totally<00:01:13.920> normal

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
that's totally normal

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:25.539

on recipes for Windex online using

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.399 
on recipes for Windex online using
ammonia<00:01:32.609> and<00:01:33.570> some<00:01:33.689> other<00:01:33.810> things<00:01:34.079> like<00:01:34.170> that

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
ammonia and some other things like that

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:35.959 
ammonia and some other things like that
but<00:01:34.560> I<00:01:34.649> just<00:01:34.829> find<00:01:34.950> those<00:01:35.159> chemicals<00:01:35.610> are<00:01:35.729> way

00:01:35.959 --> 00:01:35.969 
but I just find those chemicals are way

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:38.059 
but I just find those chemicals are way
too<00:01:36.030> strong<00:01:36.420> for<00:01:36.689> me<00:01:36.840> and<00:01:37.530> this<00:01:37.649> one<00:01:37.890> works

00:01:38.059 --> 00:01:38.069 
too strong for me and this one works

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:40.760 
too strong for me and this one works
really<00:01:38.159> well<00:01:38.520> because<00:01:38.729> it's<00:01:39.000> so<00:01:39.240> simple<00:01:39.719> and<00:01:40.109> a

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
really well because it's so simple and a

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.980 
really well because it's so simple and a
lot<00:01:41.250> of<00:01:41.369> you<00:01:41.460> asked<00:01:41.789> in<00:01:41.880> my<00:01:41.909> previous<00:01:42.240> video<00:01:42.689> do

I have any problems with the vinegar

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.870 
I have any problems with the vinegar
smelling<00:01:45.659> too<00:01:45.869> strong<00:01:46.259> and<00:01:46.619> honestly<00:01:47.549> no

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
smelling too strong and honestly no

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.969 
smelling too strong and honestly no

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
whenever I use this product I can't even

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.529 
whenever I use this product I can't even
smell<00:01:50.429> the<00:01:50.459> vinegar<00:01:50.850> I<00:01:51.030> don't<00:01:51.179> know<00:01:51.299> if<00:01:51.420> it's

00:01:51.529 --> 00:01:51.539 
smell the vinegar I don't know if it's

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:53.059 
smell the vinegar I don't know if it's
the<00:01:51.689> soap<00:01:51.959> that's<00:01:52.140> mixed<00:01:52.530> it<00:01:52.619> in<00:01:52.740> there<00:01:52.890> that

00:01:53.059 --> 00:01:53.069 
the soap that's mixed it in there that

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:55.520 
the soap that's mixed it in there that
neutralizes<00:01:53.520> it<00:01:53.939> but<00:01:54.810> it<00:01:54.899> works<00:01:55.110> so<00:01:55.319> well

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
neutralizes it but it works so well

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.899 
neutralizes it but it works so well
because<00:01:55.670> the<00:01:56.670> vinegar<00:01:57.560> acts<00:01:58.560> as<00:01:58.979> a<00:01:59.369> anti

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
because the vinegar acts as a anti

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.059 
because the vinegar acts as a anti
streak<00:02:00.360> and<00:02:00.630> then<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:01.140> soap<00:02:01.380> and<00:02:01.530> water<00:02:01.770> kind

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:04.460 
streak and then the soap and water kind
of<00:02:02.189> helped<00:02:02.459> to<00:02:02.610> clean<00:02:02.880> it<00:02:03.000> off<00:02:03.119> and<00:02:03.959> I<00:02:04.049> do<00:02:04.110> find

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:04.470 
of helped to clean it off and I do find

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:05.719 
of helped to clean it off and I do find
that<00:02:04.590> I<00:02:04.649> have<00:02:04.829> to<00:02:04.860> buff<00:02:05.189> it<00:02:05.340> out<00:02:05.489> maybe

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
that I have to buff it out maybe

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.089 
that I have to buff it out maybe
slightly<00:02:06.329> more<00:02:06.689> than<00:02:06.720> I<00:02:07.020> do<00:02:07.079> typical<00:02:07.739> Windex

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
slightly more than I do typical Windex

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.069 
slightly more than I do typical Windex
but<00:02:08.489> it's<00:02:08.610> totally<00:02:08.849> worth<00:02:09.269> it<00:02:09.420> to<00:02:09.539> not<00:02:09.690> use<00:02:09.869> any

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:10.079 
but it's totally worth it to not use any

00:02:10.079 --> 00:02:12.170 
but it's totally worth it to not use any
harsh<00:02:10.380> chemicals<00:02:10.470> and<00:02:11.190> do<00:02:11.579> it<00:02:11.670> on<00:02:11.790> his<00:02:11.880> super

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:11.400 
start putting things back on the table I
put<00:03:09.970> them<00:03:10.090> on<00:03:10.210> one<00:03:10.450> at<00:03:10.570> a<00:03:10.660> time<00:03:10.870> and<00:03:11.170> I<00:03:11.260> make

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
put them on one at a time and I make

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:12.990 
put them on one at a time and I make
sure<00:03:11.560> to<00:03:11.680> clean<00:03:11.890> the<00:03:11.980> inside<00:03:12.310> of<00:03:12.340> my<00:03:12.550> tray<00:03:12.850> as
