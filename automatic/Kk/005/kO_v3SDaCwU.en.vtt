I<00:00:23.300> Christina<00:00:24.300> your<00:00:24.510> question<00:00:24.900> about<00:00:25.020> what<00:00:25.440> is

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
I Christina your question about what is

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.320 
I Christina your question about what is
it<00:00:25.710> that's<00:00:25.860> keeping<00:00:26.070> society<00:00:26.730> from<00:00:26.880> catching

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
it that's keeping society from catching

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.030 
it that's keeping society from catching
on<00:00:27.480> to<00:00:27.660> this<00:00:27.840> new<00:00:28.020> biology<00:00:28.380> is<00:00:28.740> a<00:00:28.770> very

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:29.040 
on to this new biology is a very

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.940 
on to this new biology is a very
important<00:00:29.490> question<00:00:29.670> because<00:00:30.029> that<00:00:30.529> delay<00:00:31.529> of

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:31.950 
important question because that delay of

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:34.549 
important question because that delay of
adopting<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:32.940> new<00:00:33.210> sciences<00:00:33.870> is<00:00:34.050> really<00:00:34.410> what

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
adopting the new sciences is really what

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.710 
adopting the new sciences is really what
is<00:00:34.710> keeping<00:00:35.220> us<00:00:35.520> from<00:00:35.580> beginning<00:00:36.420> our

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:36.720 
is keeping us from beginning our

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.840 
is keeping us from beginning our
evolutionary<00:00:37.530> jump<00:00:37.980> into<00:00:38.220> a<00:00:38.280> higher<00:00:38.460> level<00:00:38.790> of

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
evolutionary jump into a higher level of

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.759 
evolutionary jump into a higher level of
consciousness<00:00:39.090> and<00:00:40.080> you<00:00:40.140> say<00:00:40.290> well<00:00:40.440> what<00:00:40.650> is

00:00:40.759 --> 00:00:40.769 
consciousness and you say well what is

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:43.790 
consciousness and you say well what is
keeping<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.550> public<00:00:42.030> from<00:00:42.590> receiving<00:00:43.590> this

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
keeping the public from receiving this

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.310 
keeping the public from receiving this
information<00:00:44.309> the<00:00:44.460> fact<00:00:44.670> is<00:00:44.910> it's<00:00:45.510> very<00:00:45.900> simple

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
information the fact is it's very simple

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.439 
information the fact is it's very simple
it's<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:46.860> self-interest<00:00:47.580> of<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.120> money

00:00:48.439 --> 00:00:48.449 
it's the self-interest of the money

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:50.420 
it's the self-interest of the money
groups<00:00:48.870> that<00:00:49.199> like<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:49.800> structure<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.309> way

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
groups that like the structure the way

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.280 
groups that like the structure the way
it<00:00:50.580> is<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:51.269> institutions<00:00:52.019> that<00:00:52.140> have<00:00:52.260> been

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:52.290 
it is the institutions that have been

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.829 
it is the institutions that have been
here<00:00:52.710> invested<00:00:53.280> in<00:00:53.400> the<00:00:53.519> world<00:00:53.729> in<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.120> way<00:00:54.269> we

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:54.839 
here invested in the world in the way we

00:00:54.839 --> 00:00:56.869 
here invested in the world in the way we
are<00:00:54.930> living<00:00:55.140> it<00:00:55.320> right<00:00:55.350> now<00:00:55.559> that<00:00:56.159> put<00:00:56.729> all

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
are living it right now that put all

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.369 
are living it right now that put all
their<00:00:57.030> effort<00:00:57.330> into<00:00:57.510> that<00:00:57.690> to<00:00:57.960> have<00:00:58.199> the

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
their effort into that to have the

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.500 
their effort into that to have the
public<00:00:58.559> respond<00:00:59.159> to<00:00:59.309> them<00:00:59.489> all<00:01:00.120> of<00:01:00.150> a<00:01:00.299> sudden

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
public respond to them all of a sudden

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:01.729 
public respond to them all of a sudden
you<00:01:00.600> come<00:01:00.750> along<00:01:00.960> and<00:01:01.019> say<00:01:01.260> well<00:01:01.290> there's<00:01:01.559> new

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
you come along and say well there's new

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.860 
you come along and say well there's new
ideas<00:01:02.190> new<00:01:02.400> beliefs<00:01:02.760> new<00:01:02.909> ways<00:01:03.089> of<00:01:03.269> living<00:01:03.479> and

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
ideas new beliefs new ways of living and

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.950 
ideas new beliefs new ways of living and
yet<00:01:04.530> what<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.129> issue<00:01:05.370> is<00:01:05.670> for<00:01:05.820> these<00:01:06.000> entities

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
yet what the issue is for these entities

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.260 
yet what the issue is for these entities
these<00:01:07.140> institutions<00:01:07.890> is<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.610> concept<00:01:09.090> of<00:01:09.150> a

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
these institutions is the concept of a

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.359 
these institutions is the concept of a
new<00:01:09.420> way<00:01:09.570> of<00:01:09.600> living<00:01:09.869> and<00:01:10.380> a<00:01:10.530> new<00:01:10.710> idea<00:01:11.250> about

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
new way of living and a new idea about

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.600 
new way of living and a new idea about
life<00:01:11.810> undermines<00:01:12.810> their<00:01:13.229> business<00:01:13.560> plan<00:01:13.799> so

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
life undermines their business plan so

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.080 
life undermines their business plan so
basically<00:01:15.090> it<00:01:15.330> says<00:01:15.360> that<00:01:16.130> the<00:01:17.130> media<00:01:17.729> which

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
basically it says that the media which

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.910 
basically it says that the media which
is<00:01:18.240> owned<00:01:18.420> by<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:18.659> private<00:01:19.020> interests<00:01:19.830> and

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
is owned by the private interests and

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.469 
is owned by the private interests and
the<00:01:20.010> corporate<00:01:20.400> entities<00:01:20.850> that<00:01:21.000> pay<00:01:21.180> for<00:01:21.240> that

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
the corporate entities that pay for that

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.590 
the corporate entities that pay for that
media<00:01:21.900> also<00:01:22.549> pay<00:01:23.549> for<00:01:23.850> what<00:01:24.060> is<00:01:24.299> being

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
media also pay for what is being

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.270 
media also pay for what is being
delivered<00:01:24.960> through<00:01:25.080> that<00:01:25.380> media<00:01:25.710> it's<00:01:26.040> a<00:01:26.100> very

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
delivered through that media it's a very

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.490 
delivered through that media it's a very
simple<00:01:26.670> point<00:01:26.850> and<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.870> issue<00:01:28.050> is<00:01:28.230> why<00:01:28.440> this

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
simple point and the issue is why this

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.800 
simple point and the issue is why this
becomes<00:01:28.980> important<00:01:29.490> is<00:01:29.610> that<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:30.390> news<00:01:30.600> is

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
becomes important is that the news is

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.120 
becomes important is that the news is
filtered<00:01:31.260> the<00:01:31.650> filtered<00:01:32.100> news<00:01:32.340> supports<00:01:33.030> the

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
filtered the filtered news supports the

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.260 
filtered the filtered news supports the
actions<00:01:35.130> and<00:01:35.370> activities<00:01:35.490> of<00:01:36.090> the

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
actions and activities of the

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.390 
actions and activities of the
institutions<00:01:36.840> that<00:01:36.930> exist<00:01:37.350> and<00:01:37.530> any<00:01:38.100> news

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
institutions that exist and any news

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.130 
institutions that exist and any news
that<00:01:38.670> is<00:01:38.790> really<00:01:39.060> contradictory<00:01:39.720> to<00:01:39.990> the

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
that is really contradictory to the

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.530 
that is really contradictory to the
established<00:01:40.680> institutions<00:01:41.370> is<00:01:41.790> generally

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
established institutions is generally

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.620 
established institutions is generally
kept<00:01:43.200> off<00:01:43.500> of<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:43.860> mainstream<00:01:44.250> media<00:01:44.390> to<00:01:45.390> keep

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
kept off of the mainstream media to keep

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.260 
kept off of the mainstream media to keep
the<00:01:45.870> institutions<00:01:46.560> in<00:01:46.710> power<00:01:47.250> and<00:01:47.670> in<00:01:47.880> control

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
the institutions in power and in control

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.520 
the institutions in power and in control
so<00:01:49.110> basically<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:50.790> resistance<00:01:51.659> is<00:01:52.050> not<00:01:52.230> from

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
so basically the resistance is not from

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.280 
so basically the resistance is not from
the<00:01:52.650> people<00:01:53.090> the<00:01:54.090> resistance<00:01:54.720> is<00:01:54.870> from<00:01:55.080> those

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
the people the resistance is from those

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.050 
the people the resistance is from those
parties<00:01:55.860> that<00:01:55.980> are<00:01:56.040> interested<00:01:56.760> in<00:01:56.880> keeping

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
parties that are interested in keeping

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.710 
parties that are interested in keeping
the<00:01:57.740> situation<00:01:58.970> exactly<00:01:59.970> the<00:02:00.120> same<00:02:00.360> without

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:00.720 
the situation exactly the same without

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.320 
the situation exactly the same without
change<00:02:01.110> because<00:02:01.950> those<00:02:02.250> institutions<00:02:03.120> are

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:03.330 
change because those institutions are

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.960 
change because those institutions are
making<00:02:04.260> a<00:02:04.409> substantial<00:02:04.680> profit<00:02:05.280> from<00:02:05.670> the<00:02:05.850> way

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:05.970 
making a substantial profit from the way

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:07.640 
making a substantial profit from the way
the<00:02:06.150> world<00:02:06.270> is<00:02:06.510> running<00:02:06.720> right<00:02:07.020> now<00:02:07.260> and

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:07.650 
the world is running right now and

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:10.460 
the world is running right now and
therefore<00:02:08.489> have<00:02:08.610> no<00:02:08.640> interest<00:02:09.360> in<00:02:09.599> saying<00:02:10.140> a

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
therefore have no interest in saying a

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:29.500 
therefore have no interest in saying a
new<00:02:10.649> way<00:02:10.830> of<00:02:10.950> life<00:02:11.129> on<00:02:11.340> this<00:02:11.459> planet

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.569
