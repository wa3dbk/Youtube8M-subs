00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:36.000 
or as home address let's do home address
okay<00:01:31.880> now

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:36.010 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:40.230 

okay<00:01:37.470> let's<00:01:38.470> try<00:01:38.560> that<00:01:38.620> again<00:01:38.770> I<00:01:39.160> don't<00:01:40.150> know

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.240 
okay let's try that again I don't know

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.580 
okay let's try that again I don't know
if<00:01:40.360> it's<00:01:40.480> going<00:01:40.630> to<00:01:40.690> do<00:01:40.810> it<00:01:40.960> but<00:01:43.170> there<00:01:44.170> we<00:01:44.290> go

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 
if it's going to do it but there we go

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.720 
if it's going to do it but there we go
root<00:01:44.800> calculation<00:01:47.220> it's<00:01:48.220> actually<00:01:48.520> quite

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:48.730 
root calculation it's actually quite

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:54.810 
root calculation it's actually quite
fast<00:01:51.300> and<00:01:52.800> it<00:01:53.800> shows<00:01:54.010> where<00:01:54.190> we<00:01:54.310> are<00:01:54.430> currently

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:54.820

oh it says disk not available that's
fine<00:02:48.150> music<00:02:49.150> let's<00:02:50.020> try<00:02:50.230> USB<00:02:53.310> this<00:02:54.310> is

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
fine music let's try USB this is

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:56.850 
fine music let's try USB this is
checking<00:02:54.730> for<00:02:54.880> device<00:02:55.269> and<00:02:55.540> basically<00:02:55.930> it

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
checking for device and basically it

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:58.470 
checking for device and basically it
would<00:02:57.010> be<00:02:57.160> in<00:02:57.250> there<00:02:57.459> but<00:02:57.670> let's<00:02:58.120> see<00:02:58.330> what

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
would be in there but let's see what

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.640 
would be in there but let's see what
else

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:09.119 

I<00:03:06.840> think<00:03:07.840> we<00:03:07.959> actually<00:03:08.110> have<00:03:08.349> to<00:03:08.650> press<00:03:08.860> the

00:03:09.119 --> 00:03:09.129 
I think we actually have to press the
