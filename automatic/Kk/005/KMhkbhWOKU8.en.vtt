what is to come so I will leave a link

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.120 
what is to come so I will leave a link
as<00:01:12.750> always<00:01:13.049> but<00:01:13.229> I<00:01:13.350> thought<00:01:13.560> that<00:01:13.619> this<00:01:13.890> was<00:01:14.070> a

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
as always but I thought that this was a

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.399 
as always but I thought that this was a
pretty<00:01:14.460> phenomenal<00:01:14.960> massive<00:01:15.960> sinkhole<00:01:16.380> that

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
pretty phenomenal massive sinkhole that

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.340 
pretty phenomenal massive sinkhole that
opens<00:01:16.860> up<00:01:16.979> here<00:01:17.509> you<00:01:18.509> can<00:01:18.630> see<00:01:18.810> right<00:01:18.840> here<00:01:19.259> in

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
opens up here you can see right here in

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.899 
opens up here you can see right here in
this<00:01:19.439> open<00:01:19.830> field<00:01:22.280> that's<00:01:23.280> one<00:01:23.549> of<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:23.700> first

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
this open field that's one of the first

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.080 
this open field that's one of the first
shots<00:01:24.270> when<00:01:24.509> it<00:01:24.630> first<00:01:24.990> opened<00:01:25.200> up<00:01:25.710> and<00:01:26.090> it's

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
shots when it first opened up and it's

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.480 
shots when it first opened up and it's
grown<00:01:27.390> substantially<00:01:27.990> since<00:01:28.829> then<00:01:29.689> so

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490 
grown substantially since then so

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.090 
grown substantially since then so
there's<00:01:32.490> a<00:01:32.579> lot<00:01:32.729> of<00:01:32.790> good<00:01:33.110> pictures<00:01:34.110> on<00:01:34.799> this

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
there's a lot of good pictures on this
