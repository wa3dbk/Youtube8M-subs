00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:08.490
 first it was first and then start 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:10.500
 both for pc clear that is first play 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.269
 at a friend's house while Ines 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.679
 john was one of the first games of 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.439
 races that I had installed in my 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:19.259
 own computer although I do not remember and 

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:21.919
 he hit in windows 98 or maybe in 

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:21.919
 Windows Xp 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:27.460
 also referring to the memories that 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:29.140
 I keep on admission is inevitable not 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.970
 Take into account screen email by 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:36.210
 small elements that link them 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:36.210
 each other then that station 

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:39.680
 to 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.680
 welcome to the classic room 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.140
 when the time of the vehicles of 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.300
 control was fashionable in the 80s and 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:04.080
 90 an unknown exponent in 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.550
 video games appeared in 1997 unknown 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.280
 at a massive level since always 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:09.850
 there were people who knew a lot about 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.189
 the 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.140
 and despite not remembering for any 

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:16.570
 sector of the game that this will be classified 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.670
 as remote-controlled racing is obvious 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:22.350
 that started at the first sight handles 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:26.549
 small vehicles of the radio control type 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:28.530
 and see broadway micromachines of the rally 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:31.110
 and even the rock and roll itself 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.170
 rising next to nation julián share 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:36.659
 theoretically similar characteristics 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:38.640
 inherent to this subgenre vehicles 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.229
 small on a large stage of 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.390
 interaction with the elements in each 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.520
 view and a particular detail that you 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.830
 makes camera vision special 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.310
 aerial what is usually called same 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:49.310
 overhead 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.950
 and the start is a polygonal game then 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:01.020
 three-dimensional visually looks great 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.240
 with that combination because I do not know 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.729
 It is necessary to design a fund that 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.920
 contain a horizon the sky and 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.090
 opponents moving away towards the end but 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.340
 which makes creating an entire landscape 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.769
 observed from an aerial camera 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.440
 slightly inclined showing 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:20.150
 different ground plans some more 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.150
 high and others lower 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:32.280
 ignition is of purely European origin 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.740
 although it gives us the option to choose the 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:37.110
 language included Spanish 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:39.750
 we also have Italian and Swedish English 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.730
 your original language we could believe 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.860
 so that the holidays are based on 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:47.260
 European countries or something like that 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:49.629
 but it is not like that 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:52.420
 to corroborate it the clues are the 

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:56.079
 following the farms located in the 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:59.680
 Canadian country the desert in usa 

00:02:56.079 --> 00:03:01.599
 based on gold rush a beach 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:06.030
 paradisiacal supposedly from the ocean 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:09.360
 atlantic the aztec temples in mexico 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:12.780
 the mountain range of the Alps a cold 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:14.520
 Icelandic landscape and finally the route 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:17.780
 more complex based on cities 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:17.780
 oriental soap 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:26.780
 each of the seven views has below 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:28.670
 without alternate plays with what 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:31.819
 hardly a return will be equal to the 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:33.830
 previous on easy difficulty there will only be 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:35.390
 five views so that overcoming the 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:39.340
 following categories are achieved 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:39.340
 unlock the last two scenarios 

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:47.540
 now to the shortcuts we must add the 

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:49.280
 obstacles in this sense of English jon 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:55.430
 It is also an interactive game with the 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:57.500
 scenario we can fall to the rivers be 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:59.840
 flipped by a whirl or crash 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:01.670
 against a train for example what what 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.739
 it becomes a game tremendously 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:07.099
 fun because it becomes a challenge 

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:09.319
 in the highest difficulties and although 

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:11.690
 you can see the games too crazy 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:14.420
 here there are also the rules we must 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:16.700
 finish third as a minimum to advance 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:20.590
 to the next race 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:20.590
 we compete against five other vehicles 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:28.540
 these vehicles range from a mini cooper 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:30.640
 even a school bus we also have 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:32.710
 with a police car in an extra under a 

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:36.850
 trailer and other gangs that are also going to 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:39.070
 be unlocked every vehicle has 

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:40.990
 four different values ​​to consider and 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:42.810
 which will be beneficial in certain tracks 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:46.180
 much more than in other 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:49.240
 these values ​​are the speed the grip 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:51.820
 the acceleration and the turbo like that is the 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:53.460
 turbo and why it is so important 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:55.680
 Turbo 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:58.169
 it is because the fact of moving to your 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:01.169
 opponents will sometimes depend on their use 

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:03.090
 especially in clear straight sections 

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:06.710
 that we could not always use it because 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:09.800
 the turbo has some recharge time 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:11.900
 careful when using the turbo control by 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:13.940
 true is quite sensitive and certain 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:15.980
 very tight curves and the use of the turbo 

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:17.770
 could cause the destabilization of 

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:20.410
 vehicle 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:22.090
 otherwise the handling is precise a 

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:25.180
 new from the time of my practice and what 

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:27.759
 best of all is that it's very simple just 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:31.889
 the keys to accelerate slow down and turn 

00:05:27.759 --> 00:05:31.889
 apart from the turbo and the rear view 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:39.410
 start with the mode for a 

00:05:37.009 --> 00:05:42.950
 player and for multiplayer either place 

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:45.410
 a double screen and multiplayer online 

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:47.570
 but for a player the modalities are 

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:50.600
 they divide in championship unique race 

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:53.120
 time and elimination the latter is a 

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:55.370
 of the most interesting within six 

00:05:53.120 --> 00:06:01.520
 laps the last vehicle to be left 

00:05:55.370 --> 00:06:03.830
 completely eliminates career by its 

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:06.110
 part of the sound effects is very 

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:09.080
 well and does not verify more than a video game 

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:11.510
 very playful and funny cut making 

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:14.680
 allusion to what has already been commented on the classics 

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:14.680
 scale cars
