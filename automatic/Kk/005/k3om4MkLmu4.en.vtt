can't<00:01:24.480> we<00:01:24.600> break<00:01:24.960> it<00:01:25.110> down<00:01:25.200> for<00:01:25.470> them<00:01:25.530> okay

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
can't we break it down for them okay

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.800 
can't we break it down for them okay
it's<00:01:26.490> kind<00:01:26.820> of<00:01:26.850> hard<00:01:27.060> to<00:01:27.090> explain<00:01:27.210> because<00:01:27.600> you

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
it's kind of hard to explain because you

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.120 
it's kind of hard to explain because you
have<00:01:27.900> to<00:01:27.990> clip<00:01:28.230> into<00:01:28.410> some<00:01:28.650> things<00:01:28.890> in<00:01:29.040> this

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
have to clip into some things in this

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.160 
have to clip into some things in this
map<00:01:29.400> it's<00:01:29.820> actually<00:01:30.180> cuz<00:01:30.690> it's<00:01:30.810> a<00:01:30.900> thumbnail

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
map it's actually cuz it's a thumbnail

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.320 
map it's actually cuz it's a thumbnail
what<00:01:31.710> you<00:01:31.830> see<00:01:31.980> right<00:01:32.010> here<00:01:32.220> that's<00:01:32.700> just<00:01:33.000> with

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:33.330 
what you see right here that's just with

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:34.970 
what you see right here that's just with
it<00:01:33.360> what<00:01:33.660> it<00:01:33.750> basically<00:01:33.810> looks<00:01:34.350> like<00:01:34.530> just<00:01:34.860> few

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:34.980 
it what it basically looks like just few

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:37.160 
it what it basically looks like just few
pieces<00:01:35.160> that<00:01:35.490> has<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:35.760> default<00:01:36.180> map<00:01:36.420> but<00:01:36.900> like

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
pieces that has the default map but like

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.840 
pieces that has the default map but like
in<00:01:37.410> reality<00:01:37.830> like<00:01:37.980> when<00:01:38.280> you<00:01:38.340> get<00:01:38.490> inside<00:01:38.610> the

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
in reality like when you get inside the

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.860 
in reality like when you get inside the
map<00:01:39.060> it's<00:01:39.450> just<00:01:39.630> completely<00:01:40.500> tampered<00:01:41.010> with

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:41.870 
map it's just completely tampered with

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:44.030 
map it's just completely tampered with
come<00:01:42.870> to<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.140> shooting<00:01:43.530> come<00:01:43.860> to<00:01:43.980> the

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
come to the shooting come to the

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.860 
come to the shooting come to the
shooting<00:01:44.370> over<00:01:45.120> here<00:01:45.240> by<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.420> water<00:01:45.630> where

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:45.870 
shooting over here by the water where

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:47.570 
shooting over here by the water where
you<00:01:45.900> can<00:01:46.110> fall<00:01:46.410> off<00:01:46.440> there's<00:01:47.250> a<00:01:47.340> platform

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:47.580 
you can fall off there's a platform

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:49.550 
you can fall off there's a platform
where<00:01:48.030> you<00:01:48.180> can<00:01:48.330> just<00:01:48.450> fall<00:01:48.690> off<00:01:48.900> up<00:01:49.080> and<00:01:49.290> jump

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
where you can just fall off up and jump

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.010 
where you can just fall off up and jump
on<00:01:49.770> see<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.369> texture<00:01:50.850> layers<00:01:51.060> live<00:01:51.390> a<00:01:51.540> light

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
on see the texture layers live a light

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.719 
on see the texture layers live a light
when<00:01:52.200> they<00:01:52.290> overlap<00:01:52.440> it'll<00:01:53.100> crash<00:01:53.310> the<00:01:53.550> game

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
when they overlap it'll crash the game

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.460 
when they overlap it'll crash the game
so<00:01:54.000> Conway<00:01:54.330> had<00:01:54.479> to<00:01:54.570> put<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:54.810> map<00:01:54.990> below<00:01:55.290> this

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
so Conway had to put the map below this
