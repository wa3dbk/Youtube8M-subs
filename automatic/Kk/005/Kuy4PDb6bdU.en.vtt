00:00:01.519 --> 00:00:07.270
 the polymerase chain reaction or tcr is an alternative to cloning 

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:11.540
 bacterial to inflate and amplify a certain region of abyei 

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:17.689
 the pcr can amplify a simple copy of a region already comes 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:23.420
 among billions of others in a complex mix openid n area of 

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:24.589
 tissues 

00:00:24.589 --> 00:00:27.609
 shown to kiko +1 

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:31.599
 In this example a mixture of molecules contains a specific region that 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:34.599
 we want to amplify or sequence later 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.280
 show here in green 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.970
 with the pcr we can make millions of copies of the taryet region without 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:48.940
 need to purify previously in the first cycle the temperature rises to 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.310
 95 degrees to separate the chains 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:54.350
 or denaturalize 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.380
 then the temperature is lowered 60 degrees so that the prizes 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:02.280
 specific to each of the complementary chains 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.750
 these trains and sells mount so that the attack 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:11.370
 polymerase synthesize dn to be extreme three cousins ​​and or free nucleotides 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:14.370
 at a temperature of 72 degrees 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.800
 only this region be amplified by the polymerase cta 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.770
 since you can only synthesize to dn from phrae more specific 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.600
 in some chains it will not stop until 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.420
 xerez cd lanes 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:43.409
 at the end of cycle one two double helix chains have then been formed 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.990
 from a 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:48.730
 second cycle 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:50.860
 the three steps are repeated 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.860
 of naturalization at 95 degrees 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.630
 union of the trailers at 60 degrees 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:00.609
 and the synthesis 

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:03.030
 of the polymerase 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.450
 it is necessary to raise the temperature 72 degrees 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:13.069
 so that the polymerase synthesizes 

00:02:13.969 --> 00:02:16.969
 in direction 5 Prima primates 

00:02:19.279 --> 00:02:22.279
 getting four chains 

00:02:24.169 --> 00:02:27.449
 extreme 3 longer bonus 

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:33.689
 at the beginning of cycle 13 repeat the three steps again 

00:02:33.689 --> 00:02:36.139
 degrees to denature 

00:02:36.139 --> 00:02:41.429
 60 degrees for the gluing of the trainers and 72 degrees for the synthesis 

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:46.059
 in the end we will obtain 

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:52.079
 only two specific double short chain molecules oscar ll 

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:57.319
 and if there are double-stranded molecules with ends but longer primes 

00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:02.389
 as the cycles progress 

00:03:02.389 --> 00:03:05.389
 the amount of molecules will grow exponentially 

00:03:06.539 --> 00:03:09.409
 in the fourth cycle 

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:12.409
 the three steps are repeated 

00:03:14.289 --> 00:03:17.459
 as we see in the scheme 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:20.459
 and if they have eight molecules 

00:03:21.059 --> 00:03:22.579
 short 

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:26.149
 and 8 molecules with one end three cousins ​​longer 

00:03:29.779 --> 00:03:34.359
 in the fifth cycle the denaturation is repeated 

00:03:35.839 --> 00:03:39.249
 stuck of the 60 degree ones 

00:03:39.249 --> 00:03:40.590
 and synthesis 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.590
 at 72 degrees 

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:47.659
 finally giving 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:53.429
 some of 22 molecules 

00:03:53.429 --> 00:03:54.509
 White 

00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:58.419
 and only 10 molecular cuse end three longer primes 

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:05.019
 at the end of cycle 30 the number of target molecules 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:08.800
 or specific has grown exponentially getting more than 

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:11.129
 one billion molecules 

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:14.999
 and only 60 long molecules remain in the reaction 

00:04:15.939 --> 00:04:17.280
 then so 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:22.760
 As in the bacterial plan the PCR selectively amplifies a quantity of 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:25.210
 Adenex specific molecules 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:27.990
 inside a mixture of genomic adenex
