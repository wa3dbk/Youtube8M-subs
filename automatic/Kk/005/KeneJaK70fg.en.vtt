00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:32.150 
and it was kind of it was interesting

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.840 
and it was kind of it was interesting
because<00:00:32.270> I<00:00:32.780> has<00:00:33.500> done<00:00:33.770> one<00:00:34.010> before<00:00:34.190> when<00:00:34.820> I

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:34.850 
because I has done one before when I

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:36.970 
because I has done one before when I
first<00:00:35.150> be<00:00:35.480> seed<00:00:35.750> and<00:00:35.989> I<00:00:36.080> had<00:00:36.260> in<00:00:36.440> this<00:00:36.530> done<00:00:36.739> one

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:36.980 
first be seed and I had in this done one

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.060 
first be seed and I had in this done one
since<00:00:37.250> then<00:00:37.550> so<00:00:38.270> I<00:00:38.300> thought<00:00:38.690> I<00:00:38.960> try<00:00:39.320> to<00:00:39.710> do<00:00:39.920> it

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:40.070 
since then so I thought I try to do it

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.820 
since then so I thought I try to do it
again<00:00:40.340> and<00:00:40.660> the<00:00:41.660> result<00:00:42.050> was<00:00:42.200> really<00:00:42.620> really

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:42.830 
again and the result was really really

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:45.010 
again and the result was really really
good<00:00:42.950> the<00:00:43.730> only<00:00:43.879> thing<00:00:44.059> I<00:00:44.120> didn't<00:00:44.480> like<00:00:44.510> was

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:45.020 
good the only thing I didn't like was

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:46.960 
good the only thing I didn't like was
after<00:00:45.440> I<00:00:45.470> board<00:00:45.830> ride<00:00:46.100> it<00:00:46.280> my<00:00:46.309> hair<00:00:46.699> felt

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:46.970 
after I board ride it my hair felt

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:50.200 
after I board ride it my hair felt
really<00:00:47.270> really<00:00:47.540> dry<00:00:48.110> and<00:00:48.559> my<00:00:48.949> crisp<00:00:49.460> feeling

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.210 
really really dry and my crisp feeling

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:51.970 
really really dry and my crisp feeling
which<00:00:50.750> is<00:00:50.900> a<00:00:50.930> little<00:00:51.230> bit<00:00:51.350> uncomfortable

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:51.980 
which is a little bit uncomfortable

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:53.259 
which is a little bit uncomfortable
because<00:00:52.190> i<00:00:52.400> thought<00:00:52.610> maybe<00:00:52.820> i<00:00:53.000> did<00:00:53.239> something

00:00:53.259 --> 00:00:53.269 
because i thought maybe i did something

00:00:53.269 --> 00:00:58.060 
because i thought maybe i did something
really<00:00:53.750> wrong<00:00:54.019> to<00:00:54.320> my<00:00:54.470> hair<00:00:56.230> but<00:00:57.230> what<00:00:57.470> I<00:00:57.500> what

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:58.070 
really wrong to my hair but what I what

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.700 
really wrong to my hair but what I what
the<00:00:58.580> end<00:00:58.760> result<00:00:59.090> is<00:00:59.239> this<00:00:59.540> but<00:01:00.019> what<00:01:00.350> I<00:01:00.379> did

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:00.710 
the end result is this but what I did

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:05.250 
the end result is this but what I did
was<00:01:00.980> blow<00:01:01.699> dried<00:01:02.030> my<00:01:02.059> hair<00:01:02.600> and<00:01:02.900> then<00:01:03.650> I<00:01:03.830> did<00:01:04.129> a

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:05.260 
was blow dried my hair and then I did a

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.560 
was blow dried my hair and then I did a
bantu<00:01:06.260> knot<00:01:06.560> twist<00:01:07.070> out<00:01:07.340> which<00:01:07.970> is<00:01:08.120> basically

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.570 
bantu knot twist out which is basically

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:10.690 
bantu knot twist out which is basically
to<00:01:09.080> stir<00:01:09.290> and<00:01:09.470> twisting<00:01:09.979> your<00:01:10.010> hair<00:01:10.220> and

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
to stir and twisting your hair and

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.750 
to stir and twisting your hair and
they're<00:01:11.620> rolling<00:01:12.620> them<00:01:12.799> up<00:01:12.979> you<00:01:13.250> can<00:01:13.460> you've

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:13.760 
they're rolling them up you can you've

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.430 
they're rolling them up you can you've
probably<00:01:14.000> seen<00:01:14.299> other<00:01:14.510> people<00:01:14.720> on<00:01:15.049> here<00:01:15.229> do

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:15.440 
probably seen other people on here do

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.710 
probably seen other people on here do
them<00:01:15.680> but<00:01:15.890> it's<00:01:16.070> just<00:01:16.220> bantu<00:01:16.700> knots<00:01:16.970> so<00:01:17.630> you

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:17.720 
them but it's just bantu knots so you

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 
just roll the twist up into like a

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.609 
just roll the twist up into like a
little<00:01:19.670> ball<00:01:19.820> and<00:01:19.880> I<00:01:20.330> just<00:01:20.570> use<00:01:20.690> a<00:01:20.720> bobby<00:01:20.990> bobby

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.320 
hair it looks really really nice um and

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.880 
hair it looks really really nice um and
that's<00:01:39.920> a<00:01:40.040> lot<00:01:40.220> softer<00:01:40.550> now<00:01:40.970> too<00:01:41.030> um<00:01:41.930> when<00:01:42.590> I

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
that's a lot softer now too um when I

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.950 
that's a lot softer now too um when I
blew<00:01:43.190> it<00:01:43.220> out<00:01:43.340> initially<00:01:43.640> it<00:01:44.360> felt<00:01:44.810> really

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
blew it out initially it felt really

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.810 
blew it out initially it felt really
hard<00:01:45.260> like<00:01:45.440> I<00:01:45.590> was<00:01:45.740> saying<00:01:45.950> but<00:01:46.160> now<00:01:46.370> it<00:01:46.610> feels

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:46.820 
hard like I was saying but now it feels

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.090 
hard like I was saying but now it feels
really<00:01:47.030> soft<00:01:47.420> and<00:01:47.840> I<00:01:48.260> really<00:01:48.770> like<00:01:48.920> the

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
really soft and I really like the

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.150 
really soft and I really like the
texture<00:01:49.490> um<00:01:50.480> it's<00:01:50.750> not<00:01:50.900> as<00:01:51.050> curly<00:01:51.650> as<00:01:51.680> I<00:01:51.980> was

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:52.160 
texture um it's not as curly as I was

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.580 
texture um it's not as curly as I was
like<00:01:52.400> it's<00:01:53.090> a<00:01:53.180> little<00:01:53.330> more<00:01:53.810> as<00:01:54.170> a<00:01:54.230> little

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
like it's a little more as a little

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.620 
like it's a little more as a little
stretched<00:01:54.950> but<00:01:55.370> I<00:01:55.430> guess<00:01:55.670> that's<00:01:55.700> kind<00:01:56.150> of<00:01:56.270> the

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
stretched but I guess that's kind of the

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.050 
stretched but I guess that's kind of the
thing<00:01:56.930> we're<00:01:57.860> going<00:01:58.130> for<00:01:58.340> only<00:01:58.520> blowout<00:01:58.909> are

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
thing we're going for only blowout are

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.680 
thing we're going for only blowout are
here<00:01:59.300> anyway<00:02:00.159> but<00:02:01.159> I<00:02:01.190> do<00:02:01.310> actually<00:02:01.760> like<00:02:02.390> it<00:02:02.630> a

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:02.690 
here anyway but I do actually like it a
