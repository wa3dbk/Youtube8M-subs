00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:47.730
 What's up with the camera name there? 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:49.769
 stocking 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:52.530
 so I looked like camera stock 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:55.620
 came this app here from google 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:59.370
 this effect the focus of interest that 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:03.989
 I could not and I could not do it. 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:09.359
 It's okay for you to have the effect. 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:12.799
 focus you click here focus and for the 

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:18.390
 too, you do the same thing too 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:21.150
 the camera it will change the side changes here 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:23.760
 the video and will change the personal right side 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:26.760
 so this I try to look for as it is 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.170
 made like camera stock it will pull 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.600
 a google camera 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.850
