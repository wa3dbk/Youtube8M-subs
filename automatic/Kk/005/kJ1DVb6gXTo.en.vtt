lot<00:01:31.530> more<00:01:31.560> like<00:01:31.829> power<00:01:32.009> swords<00:01:32.420> because

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
lot more like power swords because

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.840 
lot more like power swords because
they're<00:01:33.659> just<00:01:33.780> so<00:01:33.900> large<00:01:34.170> and<00:01:34.500> then<00:01:35.280> power<00:01:35.549> axe

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
they're just so large and then power axe

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.609 
they're just so large and then power axe
here<00:01:36.240> which<00:01:36.420> also<00:01:36.630> I<00:01:36.780> guess<00:01:36.990> is<00:01:37.110> pretty

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
here which also I guess is pretty

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.530 
here which also I guess is pretty
significant<00:01:38.280> in<00:01:38.369> scale<00:01:38.640> compiled<00:01:39.150> if<00:01:39.390> it's

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
significant in scale compiled if it's

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.350 
significant in scale compiled if it's
just<00:01:39.689> tall<00:01:39.900> as<00:01:40.110> him<00:01:40.520> and<00:01:41.520> you<00:01:41.729> can<00:01:41.970> combine

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
just tall as him and you can combine

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.460 
just tall as him and you can combine
them<00:01:42.570> which<00:01:42.750> I<00:01:42.869> guess<00:01:42.990> I'll<00:01:43.110> go<00:01:43.229> ahead<00:01:43.380> and

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
them which I guess I'll go ahead and

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.499 
them which I guess I'll go ahead and
show<00:01:43.590> off<00:01:43.740> right<00:01:44.009> now<00:01:44.189> which<00:01:44.759> is<00:01:44.790> kind<00:01:45.210> of<00:01:45.270> neat

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
show off right now which is kind of neat

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:46.700 
show off right now which is kind of neat
they<00:01:45.720> I<00:01:45.750> think<00:01:45.899> they've<00:01:46.229> done<00:01:46.259> this<00:01:46.530> other

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
they I think they've done this other

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.010 
they I think they've done this other
ones<00:01:47.009> like<00:01:47.340> in<00:01:47.720> which<00:01:48.720> I'm<00:01:48.899> a<00:01:48.990> college<00:01:49.380> with

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
ones like in which I'm a college with

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.880 
ones like in which I'm a college with
kind<00:01:52.020> of<00:01:52.079> think<00:01:52.200> of<00:01:52.259> the<00:01:52.350> name<00:01:52.500> oh<00:01:52.680> the

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
kind of think of the name oh the

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.830 
kind of think of the name oh the
four-inch<00:01:53.729> Mighty<00:01:53.970> Morphin<00:01:54.149> line<00:01:54.509> from<00:01:54.689> the

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
four-inch Mighty Morphin line from the

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.230 
four-inch Mighty Morphin line from the
Mighty<00:01:54.990> Morphin<00:01:55.340> revisiting<00:01:56.340> or<00:01:56.520> whatever<00:01:57.030> we

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
Mighty Morphin revisiting or whatever we

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.270 
Mighty Morphin revisiting or whatever we
had<00:01:57.509> that<00:01:57.659> line<00:01:57.840> so<00:01:58.560> this<00:01:58.710> will<00:01:58.890> slide<00:01:59.100> in<00:01:59.250> here

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
had that line so this will slide in here

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.719 
had that line so this will slide in here
if<00:01:59.579> I<00:01:59.670> can<00:01:59.820> get<00:01:59.969> it<00:02:00.060> to<00:02:00.149> go<00:02:00.979> but<00:02:01.979> yeah<00:02:02.100> they<00:02:02.460> do

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
if I can get it to go but yeah they do

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.039 
if I can get it to go but yeah they do
things<00:02:03.030> like<00:02:03.149> that<00:02:03.210> quite<00:02:03.540> often<00:02:03.719> with<00:02:03.899> these

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
things like that quite often with these

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.050 
things like that quite often with these
also<00:02:04.259> with<00:02:04.500> figures<00:02:04.829> so<00:02:05.219> we've<00:02:05.520> recently<00:02:05.729> had

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
also with figures so we've recently had

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.029 
also with figures so we've recently had
stuff<00:02:06.360> like<00:02:06.420> that<00:02:06.719> but<00:02:07.229> it<00:02:07.350> is<00:02:07.469> always<00:02:07.649> in<00:02:07.860> neat

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
stuff like that but it is always in neat

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.720 
stuff like that but it is always in neat
addition

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:21.390 

edit<00:02:13.730> here

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.250 

all<00:02:21.970> right<00:02:22.090> there<00:02:22.239> we<00:02:22.329> go<00:02:22.450> I<00:02:22.659> always<00:02:22.780> have

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
all right there we go I always have

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.199 
all right there we go I always have
trouble<00:02:23.379> with<00:02:23.590> after<00:02:23.829> some<00:02:23.950> reason<00:02:24.250> and<00:02:25.000> then

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209 
trouble with after some reason and then

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:27.059 
trouble with after some reason and then
these<00:02:25.510> power<00:02:25.840> sword<00:02:26.140> will<00:02:26.319> sit<00:02:26.470> on<00:02:26.500> top<00:02:26.620> here

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:27.069 
these power sword will sit on top here

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:28.520 
these power sword will sit on top here
you<00:02:27.220> just<00:02:27.340> kind<00:02:27.519> of<00:02:27.640> snap<00:02:27.849> this<00:02:28.030> into<00:02:28.239> the

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
you just kind of snap this into the

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.640 
you just kind of snap this into the
little<00:02:29.530> groove<00:02:30.220> there<00:02:30.640> we<00:02:30.760> go<00:02:31.079> snap<00:02:32.079> it<00:02:32.230> on<00:02:32.379> and

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
little groove there we go snap it on and

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.190 
little groove there we go snap it on and
then<00:02:33.250> I<00:02:33.280> believe<00:02:33.790> it's<00:02:34.090> blue<00:02:34.480> is<00:02:34.689> it<00:02:34.840> blue<00:02:35.049> on

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
then I believe it's blue is it blue on

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.630 
then I believe it's blue is it blue on
the<00:02:35.290> inside<00:02:35.319> and<00:02:35.890> yellow<00:02:36.099> on<00:02:36.220> the<00:02:36.280> outside<00:02:36.340> I

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
the inside and yellow on the outside I

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:37.830 
the inside and yellow on the outside I
believe<00:02:37.060> I<00:02:37.090> always<00:02:37.329> forget

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
believe I always forget

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.210 
believe I always forget
but<00:02:38.200> snap<00:02:38.409> them<00:02:38.560> in<00:02:38.650> there<00:02:38.799> make<00:02:38.950> sure<00:02:38.980> they're

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
but snap them in there make sure they're

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:40.920 
but snap them in there make sure they're
going<00:02:39.430> sideways<00:02:39.700> like<00:02:40.359> they're<00:02:40.540> supposed<00:02:40.810> to

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
going sideways like they're supposed to

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.979 
going sideways like they're supposed to
because<00:02:41.319> they<00:02:42.310> have<00:02:42.489> such<00:02:42.700> a<00:02:42.730> wide<00:02:43.090> surface<00:02:43.629> on

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:43.989 
because they have such a wide surface on

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:47.130 
because they have such a wide surface on
the<00:02:44.170> power<00:02:44.980> daggers<00:02:45.400> that<00:02:45.700> it's<00:02:46.540> annoying<00:02:46.930> I

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
the power daggers that it's annoying I

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:48.149 
the power daggers that it's annoying I
could<00:02:47.319> probably<00:02:47.470> pull<00:02:47.739> them<00:02:47.890> a<00:02:47.950> little

00:02:48.149 --> 00:02:48.159 
could probably pull them a little

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:49.710 
could probably pull them a little
farther<00:02:48.370> up<00:02:48.640> but<00:02:48.939> I<00:02:48.970> just<00:02:49.209> want<00:02:49.450> to<00:02:49.510> make<00:02:49.569> sure

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
farther up but I just want to make sure

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.140 
farther up but I just want to make sure
everything<00:02:49.959> fits<00:02:50.310> but<00:02:51.310> so<00:02:51.459> you<00:02:51.519> can<00:02:51.730> make<00:02:51.939> the

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
everything fits but so you can make the

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.210 
everything fits but so you can make the
combined<00:02:52.480> cannon<00:02:52.930> here<00:02:53.230> which<00:02:53.470> is<00:02:53.799> pretty

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
combined cannon here which is pretty

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.250 
combined cannon here which is pretty
neat<00:02:54.489> you<00:02:54.639> can't<00:02:54.849> really<00:02:55.000> have<00:02:55.569> anyone<00:02:56.049> hold

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
neat you can't really have anyone hold

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.190 
neat you can't really have anyone hold
it<00:02:56.379> that<00:02:56.560> effectively<00:02:57.510> but<00:02:58.510> still<00:02:58.810> it's<00:02:59.079> just

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
it that effectively but still it's just

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.599 
it that effectively but still it's just
a<00:02:59.349> neat<00:02:59.500> thing<00:02:59.530> to<00:02:59.739> be<00:02:59.950> able<00:03:00.010> to<00:03:00.159> do<00:03:00.370> and<00:03:00.549> I<00:03:00.579> just

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:00.609 
a neat thing to be able to do and I just

00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:01.949 
a neat thing to be able to do and I just
knocked<00:03:00.909> tiling<00:03:01.299> right<00:03:01.450> over<00:03:01.690> it's<00:03:01.780> like<00:03:01.810> to

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959 
knocked tiling right over it's like to

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:04.770 
knocked tiling right over it's like to
get<00:03:02.079> out<00:03:02.200> here<00:03:02.819> but<00:03:03.819> yeah<00:03:03.970> that's<00:03:04.420> just<00:03:04.540> always

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
get out here but yeah that's just always

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:05.910 
get out here but yeah that's just always
kind<00:03:04.989> of<00:03:05.019> a<00:03:05.109> neat<00:03:05.260> thing<00:03:05.290> like<00:03:05.560> I<00:03:05.650> said<00:03:05.680> he

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
kind of a neat thing like I said he

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.559 
kind of a neat thing like I said he
probably<00:03:05.950> could<00:03:06.400> pull<00:03:06.970> these<00:03:07.090> up<00:03:07.150> a<00:03:07.359> little

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:07.569 
probably could pull these up a little

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:09.660 
probably could pull these up a little
bit<00:03:07.720> more<00:03:07.900> if<00:03:08.019> you<00:03:08.049> wanted<00:03:08.530> do<00:03:09.220> your<00:03:09.340> desired

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
bit more if you wanted do your desired

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:11.460 
bit more if you wanted do your desired
effect<00:03:10.120> but<00:03:10.510> we'll<00:03:10.629> just<00:03:10.659> set<00:03:10.870> that<00:03:10.989> aside<00:03:11.079> but

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
effect but we'll just set that aside but

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.140 
effect but we'll just set that aside but
now<00:03:11.560> that<00:03:11.739> Tommy's<00:03:12.040> been<00:03:12.159> yanked<00:03:12.430> out<00:03:12.549> let's

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
now that Tommy's been yanked out let's

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:14.220 
now that Tommy's been yanked out let's
go<00:03:13.209> ahead<00:03:13.269> and<00:03:13.420> take<00:03:13.510> a<00:03:13.540> look<00:03:13.659> at<00:03:13.780> him<00:03:13.900> first<00:03:14.109> I

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
go ahead and take a look at him first I

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:15.960 
go ahead and take a look at him first I
guess<00:03:14.409> so<00:03:14.620> you<00:03:14.680> have<00:03:14.950> his<00:03:15.159> dragon<00:03:15.549> dagger<00:03:15.790> here

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
guess so you have his dragon dagger here

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:18.270 
guess so you have his dragon dagger here
which<00:03:16.120> like<00:03:16.269> I<00:03:16.359> said<00:03:16.389> is<00:03:16.659> is<00:03:16.900> much<00:03:17.409> larger<00:03:18.159> it's

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
which like I said is is much larger it's

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.679 
which like I said is is much larger it's
almost<00:03:18.430> like<00:03:18.579> a<00:03:18.609> sword<00:03:18.970> and<00:03:19.209> in<00:03:19.299> fact<00:03:19.510> if

00:03:19.679 --> 00:03:19.689 
almost like a sword and in fact if

00:03:19.689 --> 00:03:20.879 
almost like a sword and in fact if
you're<00:03:19.840> looking<00:03:20.109> at<00:03:20.260> it<00:03:20.379> it<00:03:20.500> almost<00:03:20.680> looks

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:20.889 
you're looking at it it almost looks

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:22.740 
you're looking at it it almost looks
like<00:03:20.920> a<00:03:21.010> blow-up<00:03:21.340> sword<00:03:21.730> like<00:03:22.299> a<00:03:22.329> plastic

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
like a blow-up sword like a plastic

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:24.929 
like a blow-up sword like a plastic
blow-up<00:03:23.079> sword<00:03:23.349> um<00:03:23.829> also<00:03:24.220> two<00:03:24.459> things<00:03:24.819> you'll

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
probably notice is a he does not come

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.379 
probably notice is a he does not come
with<00:03:26.769> a<00:03:26.799> signature<00:03:27.190> shield<00:03:27.579> it's<00:03:28.209> not

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 
but they edited it out which personally

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:42.960 
but they edited it out which personally
I'm<00:03:41.889> actually<00:03:42.069> happy<00:03:42.430> about<00:03:42.459> this<00:03:42.760> because

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
I'm actually happy about this because

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:47.449 
I'm actually happy about this because
I'm<00:03:43.269> hash<00:03:43.720> brown<00:03:44.019> team<00:03:44.680> silver<00:03:45.099> stripe<00:03:45.659> but

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
I'm hash brown team silver stripe but

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:49.979 
I'm hash brown team silver stripe but
this<00:03:48.459> shield<00:03:48.819> thing<00:03:49.030> is<00:03:49.209> very<00:03:49.389> weird<00:03:49.629> weird

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:49.989 
this shield thing is very weird weird

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:53.129 
this shield thing is very weird weird
choice<00:03:50.310> I<00:03:51.310> think<00:03:51.549> there's<00:03:51.970> one<00:03:52.239> is<00:03:52.419> a<00:03:52.449> black<00:03:52.870> or

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:53.139 
choice I think there's one is a black or

00:03:53.139 --> 00:03:54.479 
choice I think there's one is a black or
is<00:03:53.260> it<00:03:53.379> red<00:03:53.500> one<00:03:53.769> of<00:03:53.799> them<00:03:54.010> and<00:03:54.280> like<00:03:54.370> the

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:54.489 
is it red one of them and like the

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:56.009 
is it red one of them and like the
advertisements<00:03:55.060> comes<00:03:55.239> with<00:03:55.389> the<00:03:55.479> shield<00:03:55.720> but

00:03:56.009 --> 00:03:56.019 
advertisements comes with the shield but

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:59.460 
advertisements comes with the shield but
I<00:03:56.260> assume<00:03:57.250> if<00:03:57.519> they<00:03:57.729> do<00:03:57.790> a<00:03:58.329> dragon<00:03:58.780> Zord<00:03:59.079> esque

00:03:59.460 --> 00:03:59.470 
I assume if they do a dragon Zord esque

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:02.309 
I assume if they do a dragon Zord esque
release<00:04:00.370> like<00:04:00.609> Dragon<00:04:01.180> Sword<00:04:01.269> ask<00:04:01.510> dragons

00:04:02.309 --> 00:04:02.319 
release like Dragon Sword ask dragons

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:04.770 
release like Dragon Sword ask dragons
are<00:04:02.409> released<00:04:02.709> is<00:04:02.829> sort<00:04:03.010> of<00:04:03.069> like<00:04:03.280> the<00:04:04.120> t-rex<00:04:04.329> I

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:04.780 
are released is sort of like the t-rex I

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:06.360 
are released is sort of like the t-rex I
assume<00:04:05.199> the<00:04:05.590> Green<00:04:05.769> Ranger<00:04:05.889> figure<00:04:06.250> would

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:06.370 
assume the Green Ranger figure would

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:07.979 
assume the Green Ranger figure would
come<00:04:06.549> with<00:04:06.669> it<00:04:06.849> but<00:04:07.299> it's<00:04:07.419> still<00:04:07.599> very<00:04:07.659> odd

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:07.989 
come with it but it's still very odd

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:09.990 
come with it but it's still very odd
choice<00:04:08.290> especially<00:04:08.859> since<00:04:09.069> these<00:04:09.220> he's<00:04:09.760> kind

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.000 
choice especially since these he's kind

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.640 
choice especially since these he's kind
of<00:04:10.030> so<00:04:10.150> iconic<00:04:10.479> with<00:04:10.720> that<00:04:10.900> so<00:04:11.169> that's<00:04:11.379> kind<00:04:11.590> of

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:11.650 
of so iconic with that so that's kind of

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:13.469 
of so iconic with that so that's kind of
a<00:04:11.739> bummer<00:04:11.949> but<00:04:12.069> I<00:04:12.519> personally<00:04:13.060> do<00:04:13.180> like<00:04:13.359> the

00:04:13.469 --> 00:04:13.479 
a bummer but I personally do like the

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:15.479 
a bummer but I personally do like the
stripe<00:04:13.780> here<00:04:13.989> but<00:04:14.290> the<00:04:14.650> figure<00:04:14.919> themselves

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:15.489 
stripe here but the figure themselves

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:16.770 
stripe here but the figure themselves
are<00:04:15.609> nothing<00:04:15.879> special<00:04:15.909> to<00:04:16.449> write<00:04:16.570> home<00:04:16.720> about

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:16.780 
are nothing special to write home about

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:19.170 
are nothing special to write home about
by<00:04:17.500> their<00:04:17.799> articulations<00:04:18.340> very<00:04:18.729> basic

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:19.180 
by their articulations very basic

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:19.949 
by their articulations very basic
obviously<00:04:19.659> because<00:04:19.810> they're<00:04:19.900> just

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:19.959 
obviously because they're just

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:22.589 
obviously because they're just
minifigures<00:04:20.500> we<00:04:21.010> can<00:04:21.130> go<00:04:21.190> around<00:04:21.280> 360<00:04:21.669> in<00:04:22.090> and

00:04:22.589 --> 00:04:22.599 
minifigures we can go around 360 in and

00:04:22.599 --> 00:04:24.510 
minifigures we can go around 360 in and
out<00:04:22.720> you<00:04:23.260> can<00:04:23.289> move<00:04:23.560> their<00:04:23.710> legs<00:04:23.860> together<00:04:24.130> you

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520 
out you can move their legs together you

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:25.740 
out you can move their legs together you
can<00:04:24.669> try<00:04:25.030> to<00:04:25.090> sort<00:04:25.479> of<00:04:25.539> move<00:04:25.659> them

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:25.750 
can try to sort of move them

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:27.270 
can try to sort of move them
independently<00:04:26.289> but<00:04:26.470> it<00:04:26.590> doesn't<00:04:26.919> like<00:04:27.070> that

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280 
independently but it doesn't like that

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.940 
independently but it doesn't like that
and<00:04:27.849> you<00:04:27.909> can<00:04:28.030> move<00:04:28.150> its<00:04:28.330> head<00:04:28.780> around<00:04:28.950> the

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:29.950 
and you can move its head around the

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:31.500 
and you can move its head around the
articulation<00:04:30.520> is<00:04:30.639> the<00:04:30.729> same<00:04:30.880> for<00:04:31.060> everyone<00:04:31.270> so

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:31.510 
articulation is the same for everyone so

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:33.360 
articulation is the same for everyone so
he's<00:04:31.659> going<00:04:31.750> to<00:04:31.810> be<00:04:31.930> the<00:04:32.020> base<00:04:32.200> model<00:04:32.590> and<00:04:33.279> the

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:33.370 
he's going to be the base model and the

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:35.180 
he's going to be the base model and the
details<00:04:33.700> are<00:04:33.849> pretty<00:04:34.000> basic<00:04:34.360> but<00:04:34.599> then

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:35.190 
details are pretty basic but then

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:36.290 
details are pretty basic but then
one<00:04:35.400> of<00:04:35.490> the<00:04:35.550> advantages<00:04:35.940> of<00:04:36.030> the<00:04:36.120> Mighty

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
one of the advantages of the Mighty

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:37.490 
one of the advantages of the Mighty
Morphin<00:04:36.450> suits<00:04:36.840> is<00:04:36.990> they're<00:04:37.140> pretty<00:04:37.290> basic

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500 
Morphin suits is they're pretty basic

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.850 
Morphin suits is they're pretty basic
anyway<00:04:38.160> so<00:04:39.140> there's<00:04:40.140> not<00:04:40.260> too<00:04:40.320> much<00:04:40.500> to<00:04:40.560> mess

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860 
anyway so there's not too much to mess

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.580 
anyway so there's not too much to mess
up<00:04:41.070> but<00:04:41.840> one<00:04:42.840> thing<00:04:43.080> is<00:04:43.230> kind<00:04:43.410> of<00:04:43.440> interesting

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:43.590 
up but one thing is kind of interesting

as<00:05:37.860> compared<00:05:38.370> to<00:05:38.430> like<00:05:38.610> one<00:05:38.760> of<00:05:38.850> these<00:05:38.940> packs

is<00:05:39.360> a<00:05:39.390> little<00:05:39.660> more<00:05:39.750> expensive<00:05:40.050> I<00:05:40.320> just<00:05:40.470> think

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:40.620

it's a lot more fun I mean you get one

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:43.550 
it's a lot more fun I mean you get one
of<00:05:42.450> these<00:05:42.540> little<00:05:42.690> figures<00:05:43.050> but<00:05:43.169> you<00:05:43.290> also<00:05:43.410> get

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:43.560 
of these little figures but you also get

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:47.060 
of these little figures but you also get
a<00:05:43.620> Zord<00:05:43.919> to<00:05:44.040> play<00:05:44.220> with<00:05:44.510> and<00:05:45.510> if<00:05:45.930> you<00:05:46.080> want

figures for a kid or whatever I would I

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:52.370 
figures for a kid or whatever I would I

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:56.070 
just so much better figures the putty

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:58.159 
just so much better figures the putty
patrollers<00:05:56.250> are<00:05:56.700> all<00:05:56.820> exactly<00:05:57.210> the<00:05:57.419> same<00:05:57.810> so

00:05:58.159 --> 00:05:58.169 
patrollers are all exactly the same so

00:05:58.169 --> 00:05:59.420 
patrollers are all exactly the same so
they<00:05:58.380> just<00:05:58.530> look<00:05:58.680> kind<00:05:58.830> of<00:05:58.919> like<00:05:59.070> creepy

aliens<00:05:59.880> here<00:06:00.030> which<00:06:00.210> I<00:06:00.330> guess<00:06:00.360> they're<00:06:00.780> like

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:00.960 
aliens here which I guess they're like

made<00:06:01.800> by<00:06:01.980> aliens<00:06:02.160> clay<00:06:02.970> made<00:06:03.180> by<00:06:03.330> aliens<00:06:03.480> but

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:04.070 
made by aliens clay made by aliens but

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:06.650 
made by aliens clay made by aliens but
