paint<00:02:32.310> probably<00:02:33.310> works<00:02:33.550> I'm<00:02:34.330> pretty<00:02:34.600> sure<00:02:34.810> it

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
paint probably works I'm pretty sure it

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.460 
paint probably works I'm pretty sure it
works<00:02:35.550> but<00:02:36.550> I<00:02:36.820> think<00:02:37.150> scribbles<00:02:37.840> is<00:02:38.260> more

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
works but I think scribbles is more

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.470 
works but I think scribbles is more
helpful<00:02:38.950> or<00:02:39.130> 3d<00:02:39.460> paint<00:02:39.700> is<00:02:39.820> more<00:02:40.000> helpful

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
helpful or 3d paint is more helpful

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.060 
helpful or 3d paint is more helpful
because<00:02:40.690> it<00:02:41.140> actually<00:02:41.290> changed<00:02:41.890> its<00:02:41.980> a

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.070 
because it actually changed its a

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:44.550 
because it actually changed its a
consistency<00:02:42.730> a<00:02:42.760> little<00:02:43.000> bit<00:02:43.120> so<00:02:43.360> I<00:02:43.630> prefer

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
consistency a little bit so I prefer

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.630 
consistency a little bit so I prefer
this<00:02:44.710> so<00:02:45.040> oh<00:02:45.330> yeah<00:02:46.330> and<00:02:47.320> also<00:02:47.500> you<00:02:48.250> guys<00:02:48.430> can

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
this so oh yeah and also you guys can

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.270 
this so oh yeah and also you guys can
use<00:02:48.910> um<00:02:49.380> 3d<00:02:50.380> fabric<00:02:50.710> paint<00:02:50.860> if<00:02:50.950> you<00:02:50.980> don't<00:02:51.160> have

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
use um 3d fabric paint if you don't have

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.610 
use um 3d fabric paint if you don't have
any<00:02:51.430> glue<00:02:51.700> as<00:02:52.390> a<00:02:52.450> replacement<00:02:52.840> frankly<00:02:53.380> just

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
any glue as a replacement frankly just

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.780 
any glue as a replacement frankly just
use<00:02:53.800> white<00:02:54.010> but<00:02:54.520> I<00:02:54.670> prefer<00:02:55.120> glue<00:02:55.860> okay<00:02:56.860> so<00:02:57.520> now

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
use white but I prefer glue okay so now

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.160 
use white but I prefer glue okay so now
that<00:02:57.820> we've<00:02:58.180> covered<00:02:58.450> all<00:02:58.600> the<00:02:58.750> materials

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
that we've covered all the materials

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.980 
that we've covered all the materials
let's<00:02:59.350> get<00:02:59.530> started<00:02:59.920> so<00:03:00.450> the<00:03:01.450> first<00:03:01.540> thing<00:03:01.900> you

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:01.990 
let's get started so the first thing you

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:04.950 
let's get started so the first thing you
want<00:03:02.140> to<00:03:02.200> do<00:03:02.380> is<00:03:02.620> take<00:03:03.240> your<00:03:04.240> clay<00:03:04.510> and<00:03:04.750> you<00:03:04.810> can

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:04.960

want to do is take your clay and you can
use<00:03:05.080> colored<00:03:05.500> clay<00:03:05.770> if<00:03:05.830> you<00:03:06.040> want<00:03:06.220> to<00:03:06.370> make<00:03:06.490> you

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
use colored clay if you want to make you

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:08.640 
use colored clay if you want to make you
a<00:03:06.640> different<00:03:06.970> color<00:03:07.150> of<00:03:07.720> course<00:03:07.990> and<00:03:08.230> just

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
a different color of course and just

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:13.470 
a different color of course and just
kind<00:03:08.980> of<00:03:09.070> rip<00:03:10.060> it<00:03:10.180> into<00:03:10.510> small<00:03:10.840> pieces<00:03:12.480> it

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
kind of rip it into small pieces it

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.500 
kind of rip it into small pieces it
doesn't<00:03:13.810> have<00:03:13.930> to<00:03:14.080> be<00:03:14.580> like<00:03:15.580> all<00:03:16.180> the<00:03:16.330> same

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
doesn't have to be like all the same

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.900 
doesn't have to be like all the same
size<00:03:16.750> or<00:03:16.930> anything<00:03:17.110> just<00:03:17.500> kind<00:03:17.680> of<00:03:17.880> rip<00:03:18.880> it

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
size or anything just kind of rip it

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:22.650 
size or anything just kind of rip it
into<00:03:19.830> little<00:03:20.830> tiny<00:03:21.220> pieces<00:03:21.400> make<00:03:22.180> it<00:03:22.300> all<00:03:22.420> like

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
into little tiny pieces make it all like

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:27.180 
into little tiny pieces make it all like
loose<00:03:22.990> and<00:03:23.320> fluffy<00:03:25.020> so<00:03:26.020> this<00:03:26.440> really<00:03:26.770> depends

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
loose and fluffy so this really depends

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:29.280 
loose and fluffy so this really depends
on<00:03:27.250> how<00:03:27.430> much<00:03:27.580> you<00:03:27.700> want<00:03:27.790> to<00:03:27.880> make<00:03:28.060> but<00:03:28.990> just

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
on how much you want to make but just

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.330 
on how much you want to make but just
rip<00:03:30.130> it<00:03:30.280> up<00:03:30.780> okay<00:03:31.780> so<00:03:32.110> now<00:03:32.440> I<00:03:32.470> have<00:03:32.890> my<00:03:33.040> paper

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
rip it up okay so now I have my paper

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:39.420 
rip it up okay so now I have my paper
clay<00:03:33.790> it's<00:03:34.660> right<00:03:34.840> there<00:03:37.710> you<00:03:38.710> take<00:03:39.010> your<00:03:39.160> glue

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
clay it's right there you take your glue

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:42.240 
clay it's right there you take your glue
and<00:03:39.760> just<00:03:39.790> put<00:03:40.480> a<00:03:40.510> little<00:03:40.750> bit<00:03:40.870> of<00:03:41.110> glue<00:03:41.410> inside

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
and just put a little bit of glue inside

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.000 
and just put a little bit of glue inside
your<00:03:42.490> cup<00:03:42.790> and<00:03:43.480> it's<00:03:43.990> not<00:03:44.290> really<00:03:44.500> like<00:03:44.770> any

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
your cup and it's not really like any

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.910 
your cup and it's not really like any
measurements<00:03:45.610> or<00:03:45.670> anything<00:03:46.000> just<00:03:46.209> to<00:03:46.900> UM<00:03:47.230> make

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:47.920 
measurements or anything just to UM make

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:49.710 
measurements or anything just to UM make
it<00:03:48.160> the<00:03:48.370> consistency<00:03:49.060> that<00:03:49.090> you<00:03:49.300> like<00:03:49.330> so

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720 
it the consistency that you like so

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.470 
it the consistency that you like so
start<00:03:49.959> by<00:03:50.110> adding<00:03:50.290> a<00:03:50.470> little<00:03:50.560> bit<00:03:50.709> glue<00:03:51.480> okay

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 
start by adding a little bit glue okay

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.060 
start by adding a little bit glue okay
so<00:03:52.540> now<00:03:52.870> I've<00:03:52.990> added<00:03:53.140> a<00:03:53.410> little<00:03:53.590> bit<00:03:53.770> of<00:03:53.860> glue

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:54.070 
so now I've added a little bit of glue

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:55.590 
so now I've added a little bit of glue
and<00:03:54.100> what<00:03:54.370> you<00:03:54.459> want<00:03:54.610> to<00:03:54.700> do<00:03:54.880> is<00:03:55.030> take<00:03:55.330> your

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:55.600 
and what you want to do is take your

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.449 
and what you want to do is take your
spoon<00:03:55.930> or<00:03:56.200> your<00:03:56.350> string<00:03:56.770> stick<00:03:57.100> rolled<00:03:57.310> over

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:57.459 
spoon or your string stick rolled over

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:02.220 
spoon or your string stick rolled over
you're<00:03:57.760> using<00:03:58.080> and<00:03:59.080> just<00:03:59.380> kind<00:03:59.709> of<00:04:00.780> mash<00:04:01.780> it<00:04:02.080> up

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:02.230 
you're using and just kind of mash it up

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:06.030 
you're using and just kind of mash it up
and<00:04:02.590> combine<00:04:03.250> it<00:04:03.280> with<00:04:03.490> the<00:04:03.730> glue<00:04:04.709> okay<00:04:05.709> so<00:04:05.770> you

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.040 
and combine it with the glue okay so you

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.250 
and combine it with the glue okay so you
want<00:04:06.310> to<00:04:06.430> make<00:04:07.150> it<00:04:07.300> kind<00:04:07.540> of<00:04:07.630> turn<00:04:07.810> into<00:04:07.959> like<00:04:08.230> a

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:08.260 
want to make it kind of turn into like a

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.220 
want to make it kind of turn into like a
sticky<00:04:08.770> paste<00:04:09.100> so<00:04:09.340> it's<00:04:09.490> not<00:04:09.580> really<00:04:09.850> like

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
sticky paste so it's not really like

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:13.680 
sticky paste so it's not really like
clay<00:04:11.230> anymore<00:04:11.680> it's<00:04:11.860> with<00:04:12.790> cream<00:04:13.120> essentially

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:13.690 
clay anymore it's with cream essentially

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:17.449 
clay anymore it's with cream essentially
but<00:04:14.560> now<00:04:14.890> we're<00:04:15.880> gonna<00:04:15.970> top<00:04:16.180> this<00:04:16.390> sticky<00:04:17.049> form

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
but now we're gonna top this sticky form

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:20.280 
but now we're gonna top this sticky form
if<00:04:18.459> you're<00:04:18.790> gonna<00:04:19.150> color<00:04:19.479> it<00:04:19.660> you<00:04:19.870> should<00:04:20.109> add

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:20.290 
if you're gonna color it you should add

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:23.330 
if you're gonna color it you should add
some<00:04:20.320> of<00:04:20.859> your<00:04:21.570> 3d<00:04:22.570> paint<00:04:22.810> at<00:04:23.020> this

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
some of your 3d paint at this

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.790 
some of your 3d paint at this
point<00:04:23.520> but<00:04:24.449> I'm<00:04:24.630> gonna<00:04:24.960> keep<00:04:25.199> it<00:04:25.350> white<00:04:25.500> so<00:04:25.530> I'm

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
point but I'm gonna keep it white so I'm

mix it and basically um right now super
thick<00:04:35.880> but<00:04:36.600> you<00:04:36.630> want<00:04:36.990> it<00:04:37.080> to<00:04:37.229> be<00:04:37.380> easier<00:04:37.680> to

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:37.770 
thick but you want it to be easier to

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:39.230 
thick but you want it to be easier to
type<00:04:37.949> out<00:04:38.160> if<00:04:38.310> you're<00:04:38.430> typing<00:04:38.669> back<00:04:38.940> so<00:04:39.150> you

type out if you're typing back so you

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:43.100 
type out if you're typing back so you
want<00:04:39.330> to<00:04:39.449> add<00:04:39.570> some<00:04:39.810> more<00:04:41.660> so<00:04:42.660> you<00:04:42.720> just<00:04:42.930> want

00:04:58.879 --> 00:04:58.889 
to add a little bit more clay to it here

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:00.980 
to add a little bit more clay to it here
here<00:04:59.310> I'm<00:04:59.430> just<00:04:59.669> scraping<00:05:00.000> it<00:05:00.330> off<00:05:00.419> the<00:05:00.690> spoon

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:00.990 
here I'm just scraping it off the spoon

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:03.290 
here I'm just scraping it off the spoon
this<00:05:01.680> stuff<00:05:01.979> is<00:05:02.250> pretty<00:05:02.520> sticky<00:05:02.880> because<00:05:03.150> it

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:03.300 
this stuff is pretty sticky because it

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:07.040 
this stuff is pretty sticky because it
is<00:05:03.389> made<00:05:03.630> out<00:05:03.720> of<00:05:03.900> glue<00:05:04.169> and<00:05:04.380> stuff<00:05:04.650> so<00:05:05.510> yep<00:05:06.540> you

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:07.050 
is made out of glue and stuff so yep you

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:09.350 
is made out of glue and stuff so yep you
probably<00:05:07.530> won't<00:05:08.220> want<00:05:08.490> to<00:05:08.610> keep<00:05:08.850> this<00:05:09.060> Cup

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360 
probably won't want to keep this Cup

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:12.200 
probably won't want to keep this Cup
normally<00:05:10.290> when<00:05:10.410> I<00:05:10.440> make<00:05:10.740> it<00:05:10.770> I<00:05:11.160> just<00:05:11.610> throw<00:05:12.000> the

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:12.210 
normally when I make it I just throw the

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:17.390 
normally when I make it I just throw the
UM<00:05:12.870> throw<00:05:13.470> the<00:05:13.680> paper<00:05:13.919> cup<00:05:14.280> away<00:05:15.169> but<00:05:16.169> if<00:05:16.590> you

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:17.400 
UM throw the paper cup away but if you

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.490 
UM throw the paper cup away but if you
want<00:05:18.030> to<00:05:18.180> reuse<00:05:18.360> it<00:05:18.510> you<00:05:18.690> can<00:05:18.960> always<00:05:19.080> wash<00:05:19.320> it

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:19.500 
want to reuse it you can always wash it

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:22.850 
want to reuse it you can always wash it
it<00:05:19.590> just<00:05:19.800> take<00:05:20.010> some<00:05:20.250> time<00:05:21.110> so<00:05:22.110> yeah<00:05:22.289> just<00:05:22.680> keep

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:22.860 
it just take some time so yeah just keep

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:24.620 
it just take some time so yeah just keep
adding<00:05:23.160> glue<00:05:23.550> until<00:05:24.210> it's<00:05:24.419> the<00:05:24.510> consistency

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:24.630 
adding glue until it's the consistency

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:29.719 
adding glue until it's the consistency
that<00:05:25.500> you<00:05:26.039> like<00:05:26.430> okay<00:05:26.789> so<00:05:27.770> now<00:05:28.770> if<00:05:29.220> you<00:05:29.340> can<00:05:29.520> see

00:05:29.719 --> 00:05:29.729 
that you like okay so now if you can see

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:32.659 
that you like okay so now if you can see
it's<00:05:29.880> like<00:05:30.060> a<00:05:30.090> spreadable<00:05:30.930> consistency<00:05:31.669> and

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:32.669 
it's like a spreadable consistency and

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:37.670 
it's like a spreadable consistency and
it's<00:05:32.789> pretty<00:05:33.090> smooth<00:05:33.600> and<00:05:36.050> it's<00:05:37.050> definitely

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:37.680 
it's pretty smooth and it's definitely

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:42.680 
it's pretty smooth and it's definitely
usable<00:05:38.160> now<00:05:38.460> um<00:05:40.130> it's<00:05:41.130> not<00:05:41.310> that<00:05:41.760> sticky<00:05:42.120> but

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:42.690 
usable now um it's not that sticky but

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:46.550 
usable now um it's not that sticky but
yeah<00:05:43.680> um<00:05:43.950> you<00:05:44.370> guys<00:05:44.550> just<00:05:45.260> experiment<00:05:46.260> with

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:46.560 
yeah um you guys just experiment with

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:51.740 
yeah um you guys just experiment with
the<00:05:46.950> consistency<00:05:47.760> that<00:05:47.789> you<00:05:48.090> like<00:05:49.250> I<00:05:50.750> don't

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:51.750 
the consistency that you like I don't

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:53.390 
the consistency that you like I don't
know<00:05:52.020> how<00:05:52.380> you<00:05:52.440> guys<00:05:52.710> like<00:05:52.979> your<00:05:53.190> whipped

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:53.400 
know how you guys like your whipped

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:57.589 
know how you guys like your whipped
cream<00:05:53.639> clay<00:05:53.880> but<00:05:55.639> just<00:05:56.639> make<00:05:56.820> sure<00:05:57.060> that<00:05:57.300> if

00:05:57.589 --> 00:05:57.599 
cream clay but just make sure that if

00:05:57.599 --> 00:05:59.810 
cream clay but just make sure that if
you're<00:05:58.139> able<00:05:58.530> to<00:05:58.560> pipe<00:05:58.919> it<00:05:59.099> out<00:05:59.220> of<00:05:59.340> a<00:05:59.430> piping

00:05:59.810 --> 00:05:59.820 
you're able to pipe it out of a piping

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:04.820 
you're able to pipe it out of a piping
bag<00:05:59.849> because<00:06:01.970> you<00:06:02.970> can<00:06:03.120> always<00:06:03.360> just<00:06:03.660> put<00:06:04.560> the

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:04.830 
bag because you can always just put the

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:07.070 
bag because you can always just put the
whip<00:06:05.010> cream<00:06:05.190> clay<00:06:05.520> on<00:06:05.729> to<00:06:06.120> the<00:06:06.270> decadent

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:07.080 
whip cream clay on to the decadent

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:08.839 
whip cream clay on to the decadent
project<00:06:07.440> directly<00:06:07.860> without<00:06:08.099> using<00:06:08.400> a<00:06:08.490> piping

00:06:08.839 --> 00:06:08.849 
project directly without using a piping

00:06:08.849 --> 00:06:12.320 
project directly without using a piping
bag<00:06:09.000> and<00:06:09.330> stuff<00:06:09.539> but<00:06:09.889> it<00:06:10.889> is<00:06:11.099> cooler<00:06:11.460> and<00:06:11.669> this

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:12.330 
bag and stuff but it is cooler and this

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:14.990 
bag and stuff but it is cooler and this
stuff<00:06:12.630> is<00:06:12.870> air<00:06:13.139> dry<00:06:13.410> so<00:06:13.860> you<00:06:14.099> just<00:06:14.310> have<00:06:14.580> to<00:06:14.849> let

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:15.000 
stuff is air dry so you just have to let

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.870 
stuff is air dry so you just have to let
it<00:06:15.150> sit<00:06:15.570> for<00:06:15.900> about<00:06:16.530> a<00:06:16.680> day<00:06:16.950> and<00:06:16.979> it'll<00:06:17.520> dry

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:17.880 
it sit for about a day and it'll dry

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:22.339 
it sit for about a day and it'll dry
completely<00:06:18.750> so<00:06:19.940> yeah<00:06:20.940> just<00:06:21.870> keep<00:06:22.080> adding

00:06:22.339 --> 00:06:22.349 
completely so yeah just keep adding

00:06:22.349 --> 00:06:25.310 
completely so yeah just keep adding
little<00:06:23.130> amounts<00:06:23.550> of<00:06:23.639> glue<00:06:23.940> I<00:06:24.240> find<00:06:25.169> this

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:25.320 
little amounts of glue I find this

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:27.290 
little amounts of glue I find this
method<00:06:25.590> really<00:06:26.070> helpful<00:06:26.669> especially<00:06:26.760> if<00:06:27.210> you

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:27.300 
method really helpful especially if you

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:29.450 
method really helpful especially if you
don't<00:06:27.419> have<00:06:27.599> any<00:06:27.750> access<00:06:28.229> to<00:06:28.289> silicone<00:06:28.979> and

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:29.460 
don't have any access to silicone and

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:31.909 
don't have any access to silicone and
it's<00:06:30.360> odor<00:06:30.780> free<00:06:31.139> so<00:06:31.349> it<00:06:31.409> doesn't<00:06:31.650> smell<00:06:31.830> like

00:06:31.909 --> 00:06:31.919 
it's odor free so it doesn't smell like

00:06:31.919 --> 00:06:33.500 
it's odor free so it doesn't smell like
anything<00:06:32.190> and<00:06:32.460> it's<00:06:32.610> really<00:06:32.880> lightweight<00:06:33.120> as

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:33.510 
anything and it's really lightweight as

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:35.460 
anything and it's really lightweight as
well<00:06:34.280> so

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:35.470 
well so

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:39.870 
well so
yeah<00:06:37.230> as<00:06:38.230> for<00:06:38.800> durability

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:39.880 
yeah as for durability

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:42.060 
yeah as for durability
I<00:06:39.910> think<00:06:40.360> it's<00:06:40.510> pretty<00:06:40.900> durable<00:06:41.290> it's<00:06:41.590> not<00:06:41.770> as

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:42.070 
I think it's pretty durable it's not as

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:45.150 
I think it's pretty durable it's not as
durable<00:06:42.340> as<00:06:42.670> silicon<00:06:43.240> but<00:06:43.590> it's<00:06:44.590> good<00:06:44.890> enough

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:45.160 
durable as silicon but it's good enough

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:47.760 
durable as silicon but it's good enough
because<00:06:46.120> paper<00:06:46.300> clay<00:06:46.630> isn't<00:06:46.930> that<00:06:47.050> strong<00:06:47.410> and

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:47.770 
because paper clay isn't that strong and

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:49.890 
because paper clay isn't that strong and
with<00:06:48.520> the<00:06:48.700> glue<00:06:48.910> it's<00:06:49.180> not<00:06:49.390> gonna<00:06:49.570> be<00:06:49.750> that

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:49.900 
with the glue it's not gonna be that

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:51.170 
with the glue it's not gonna be that
much<00:06:50.050> stronger

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:51.180 
much stronger

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:54.420 
much stronger
so<00:06:52.180> yeah<00:06:52.360> I'm<00:06:52.480> running<00:06:52.750> out<00:06:52.840> of<00:06:52.870> glue<00:06:53.430> that's

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:54.430 
so yeah I'm running out of glue that's

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:56.100 
so yeah I'm running out of glue that's
okay<00:06:54.790> cuz<00:06:55.000> I<00:06:55.090> have<00:06:55.180> like<00:06:55.330> a<00:06:55.360> whole<00:06:55.510> gallon<00:06:56.020> of

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:56.110 
okay cuz I have like a whole gallon of

00:06:56.110 --> 00:07:00.510 
okay cuz I have like a whole gallon of
glue<00:06:56.470> literally<00:06:58.260> okay<00:06:59.260> so<00:06:59.320> for<00:06:59.890> me<00:07:00.040> this<00:07:00.280> is<00:07:00.490> a

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:00.520 
glue literally okay so for me this is a

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:04.850 
glue literally okay so for me this is a
good<00:07:00.850> consistency<00:07:01.600> it's<00:07:02.020> nice<00:07:02.500> and<00:07:03.040> fluffy

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:04.860 
good consistency it's nice and fluffy

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:07.560 
good consistency it's nice and fluffy
and<00:07:05.860> it's<00:07:06.100> pipeable<00:07:06.730> and<00:07:07.090> it<00:07:07.180> looks<00:07:07.330> a<00:07:07.480> little

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:07.570 
and it's pipeable and it looks a little

00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:11.790 
and it's pipeable and it looks a little
bit<00:07:07.870> like<00:07:08.790> marshmallow<00:07:09.790> fluff<00:07:09.970> and<00:07:10.560> you<00:07:11.560> can

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:11.800 
bit like marshmallow fluff and you can

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:17.520 
bit like marshmallow fluff and you can
make<00:07:12.610> Peaks<00:07:13.060> with<00:07:13.390> it<00:07:15.150> so<00:07:16.150> yeah<00:07:16.360> just<00:07:17.230> keep

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:17.530 
make Peaks with it so yeah just keep

00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:19.890 
make Peaks with it so yeah just keep
adding<00:07:17.740> glue<00:07:18.070> or<00:07:18.370> keep<00:07:18.910> adding<00:07:19.270> clay<00:07:19.510> to

00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:19.900 
adding glue or keep adding clay to

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:23.600 
adding glue or keep adding clay to
whatever<00:07:20.200> consistency<00:07:21.190> that<00:07:21.370> you<00:07:21.550> like<00:07:22.080> and

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:23.610 
whatever consistency that you like and

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:27.300 
whatever consistency that you like and
then<00:07:24.610> you<00:07:24.790> can<00:07:24.910> use<00:07:25.060> it<00:07:25.210> as<00:07:25.300> whipped<00:07:26.050> cream<00:07:26.310> so

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:27.310 
then you can use it as whipped cream so

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:30.300 
then you can use it as whipped cream so
