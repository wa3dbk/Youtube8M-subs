00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:12.430
 the eye of foehn and why not triple 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:16.940
 so after the why then a dark of the 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:23.350
 his father materici and then hole because

 important book for the monsters and 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:33.320
 really high attack where then there is 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:38.239
 too we must perhaps triple reflection 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:44.140
 security armor then triple 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:50.510

 dark corruption double magic cylinder 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:03:00.380
 then there is a compulsory botton hold 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:03.530
 too much and then to take the closed 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:07.610
 however, I put them in weight because 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:10.000

 minimum mini want three guardians 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:29.299

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:33.560
 steel one of the secret of turnip bizet 

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:37.940

 intellectual cut a gm project 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:47.180
 because because it brings there they say that 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:50.930

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:53.380
 decks in fact you play to save or 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:58.370
