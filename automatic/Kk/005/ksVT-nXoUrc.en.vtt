00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:16.070
 royal python regius or python ball here 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:18.289
 I have a tiny little teeny 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:20.449
 as you can see he has just moved 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:23.810
 the skin I mute if I'm not mistaken was the 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:26.529
 Friday and abel is an ideal snake 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:29.960
 for beginners these snakes 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:34.190
 its origin is from africa of all the africa 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:35.870
 subtropical is an animal that despite 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.780
 what you can tell you about the 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:40.880
 snakes this animal is defenseless 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.070
 defends by getting a ball out of the 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:45.980
 name out there the name they say 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:48.500
 also python ball is an animal that the 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:51.350
 temperature between 25 and 28 degrees she 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:53.660
 finds in perfect condition in light 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:56.030
 is going to have no need but never 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:58.520
 They do not like a sunbath in these cases 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.260
 we put a 2.0 to all 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.240
 snakes like it would be for example to mega 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.560
 are these little animals need a 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.689
 tropical terrarium as you can check 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:07.850
 here especially also have 

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:09.950
 cascade of water so that they when 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:12.259
 they make the changes they can get inside 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.090
 discard skin before because a 

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:16.250
 bad mute in an animal of this can you 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.619
 cause a ringing in between 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:21.950
 body when you go out the next moves 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:23.060
 because you can get stuck on 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.009
 all we have to take into account 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.600
 that when we see them opaque as it is 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:29.030
 It makes the skin very ugly and the eyes 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.610
 whites the temperature the humidity 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.670
 sorry we have to increase it by 80 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.670
