00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
non rare gold let's say it would be so

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.280 
non rare gold let's say it would be so
much<00:01:32.250> cheaper<00:01:32.850> and<00:01:33.030> he'd<00:01:33.360> be<00:01:33.509> bear<00:01:33.780> that<00:01:34.170> would

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
much cheaper and he'd be bear that would

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.109 
much cheaper and he'd be bear that would
be<00:01:34.380> absolutely<00:01:34.619> epic<00:01:35.009> it<00:01:35.369> sort<00:01:35.549> of<00:01:35.579> wins<00:01:35.850> in

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
be absolutely epic it sort of wins in

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:33.860 
that he's been a ridiculous player in

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:36.130 
that he's been a ridiculous player in
the<00:03:33.950> Premier<00:03:34.040> League<00:03:34.280> so<00:03:34.610> far<00:03:34.820> this<00:03:34.970> year<00:03:35.140> and

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:36.140 
the Premier League so far this year and

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:37.680 
the Premier League so far this year and
again<00:03:36.320> it<00:03:36.710> would<00:03:36.830> be<00:03:36.860> a<00:03:36.980> similar<00:03:37.340> situation

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:37.690 
again it would be a similar situation

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:41.380 
again it would be a similar situation
whereas<00:03:38.690> if<00:03:38.720> he<00:03:39.050> got<00:03:39.230> an<00:03:39.380> in-form<00:03:40.030> or<00:03:41.030> he<00:03:41.270> has

now<00:04:14.240> I<00:04:14.480> see<00:04:14.810> your<00:04:14.959> point<00:04:15.110> and<00:04:15.410> but<00:04:16.340> what<00:04:16.580> I

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:16.609 
now I see your point and but what I

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:19.090 
now I see your point and but what I
think<00:04:17.060> will<00:04:17.690> happen<00:04:17.900> is<00:04:18.350> that<00:04:18.650> EA<00:04:18.859> will

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:19.100 
think will happen is that EA will

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:21.130 
think will happen is that EA will
upgrade<00:04:19.250> Kosta<00:04:20.180> by<00:04:20.330> one<00:04:20.630> because<00:04:20.989> he's

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:21.140 
upgrade Kosta by one because he's

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:22.870 
upgrade Kosta by one because he's
already<00:04:21.350> his<00:04:21.650> card<00:04:21.919> this<00:04:22.100> year<00:04:22.160> is<00:04:22.490> already<00:04:22.790> an

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:22.880 
already his card this year is already an

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:24.610 
already his card this year is already an
upgraded<00:04:23.450> version<00:04:23.630> of<00:04:23.870> what<00:04:24.020> he<00:04:24.169> had<00:04:24.320> last

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:24.620 
upgraded version of what he had last

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:26.920 
upgraded version of what he had last
year<00:04:24.860> on<00:04:25.190> Alma<00:04:25.760> team<00:04:25.970> whereas<00:04:26.270> Aguero

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:26.930 
year on Alma team whereas Aguero

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:29.260 
year on Alma team whereas Aguero
I<00:04:27.139> think<00:04:27.590> are<00:04:27.740> downgraded<00:04:28.430> from<00:04:28.550> last<00:04:28.820> year<00:04:29.120> so

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:29.270 
I think are downgraded from last year so

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:30.730 
I think are downgraded from last year so
I<00:04:29.300> just<00:04:29.570> think<00:04:29.780> they're<00:04:29.930> sort<00:04:30.139> of<00:04:30.169> evening

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:30.740 
I just think they're sort of evening

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.490 
I just think they're sort of evening
things<00:04:31.009> out<00:04:31.280> and<00:04:31.970> I<00:04:32.120> do<00:04:32.180> think<00:04:32.840> that<00:04:32.930> Sergio

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:33.500 
things out and I do think that Sergio

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:37.360 
things out and I do think that Sergio
Aguero<00:04:33.889> is<00:04:34.190> still<00:04:34.610> a<00:04:34.880> better<00:04:35.810> striker<00:04:36.530> in<00:04:36.949> real

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.370 
Aguero is still a better striker in real

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:40.600 
Aguero is still a better striker in real
life<00:04:37.639> and<00:04:37.940> therefore<00:04:38.389> on<00:04:38.780> this<00:04:39.050> game<00:04:39.400> and<00:04:40.400> as

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:40.610 
life and therefore on this game and as

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:42.820 
life and therefore on this game and as
you<00:04:40.759> can<00:04:40.910> see<00:04:40.940> if<00:04:41.389> if<00:04:41.960> the<00:04:42.020> Edgar<00:04:42.380> costly<00:04:42.710> an

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:42.830 
you can see if if the Edgar costly an

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:45.400 
you can see if if the Edgar costly an
upgrade<00:04:43.130> to<00:04:43.280> an<00:04:43.370> 86<00:04:43.880> he's<00:04:44.539> in<00:04:44.750> former<00:04:45.080> get<00:04:45.289> that

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:45.410

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:48.550 
upgrade to an 86 he's in former get that
upgrade<00:04:45.830> to<00:04:46.009> an<00:04:46.100> 87<00:04:46.789> now<00:04:47.259> that<00:04:48.259> would<00:04:48.380> just<00:04:48.410> be
