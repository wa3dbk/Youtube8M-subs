00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
player of course but in general I know

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.180 
player of course but in general I know
an<00:00:57.000> extra<00:00:57.480> mile<00:00:57.629> an<00:00:57.780> hour<00:00:57.870> a<00:00:58.020> ball<00:00:58.260> speed<00:00:58.590> is

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
an extra mile an hour a ball speed is

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.400 
an extra mile an hour a ball speed is
going<00:00:59.430> to<00:00:59.489> be<00:00:59.579> six<00:00:59.910> eight<00:01:00.149> feet<00:01:00.809> and<00:01:01.020> the

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
going to be six eight feet and the

what<00:01:31.520> we<00:01:31.640> will<00:01:31.760> be<00:01:31.880> doing<00:01:31.910> in<00:01:32.540> stores<00:01:32.960> is<00:01:33.320> we

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:34.010 
what we will be doing in stores is we

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:35.820 
what we will be doing in stores is we
have<00:01:34.130> a<00:01:34.160> speed<00:01:34.430> cap<00:01:34.670> and<00:01:34.910> the<00:01:35.150> speed<00:01:35.420> cap

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:35.830 
have a speed cap and the speed cap

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:39.010 
have a speed cap and the speed cap
attaches<00:01:36.830> to<00:01:36.860> all<00:01:37.250> the<00:01:37.400> 5150<00:01:37.880> bats<00:01:38.240> and<00:01:38.540> when

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 
attaches to all the 5150 bats and when

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:40.830 
attaches to all the 5150 bats and when
you<00:01:39.110> swing<00:01:39.410> the<00:01:39.530> speed<00:01:39.770> cap<00:01:40.010> it<00:01:40.250> gives<00:01:40.460> you<00:01:40.610> a

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
you swing the speed cap it gives you a

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.590 
you swing the speed cap it gives you a
bat<00:01:41.840> speed<00:01:42.110> so<00:01:42.740> based<00:01:43.250> on<00:01:43.430> that<00:01:43.490> bat<00:01:43.970> speed<00:01:44.300> and

is going to be best for your game a lot

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:03.490 
is going to be best for your game a lot
of<00:02:01.580> times<00:02:01.820> a<00:02:02.000> player<00:02:02.240> just<00:02:02.600> you<00:02:03.050> know<00:02:03.200> learns

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
of times a player just you know learns

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.040 
of times a player just you know learns
by<00:02:03.890> by<00:02:04.280> feeling<00:02:04.790> okay<00:02:05.150> this<00:02:05.330> bat<00:02:05.600> you<00:02:06.020> know

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:06.050 
by by feeling okay this bat you know

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:08.830 
by by feeling okay this bat you know
feels<00:02:06.470> better<00:02:06.800> sounds<00:02:07.430> better<00:02:07.640> looks<00:02:08.630> like

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
feels better sounds better looks like

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.510 
feels better sounds better looks like
it's<00:02:09.050> performing<00:02:09.590> better<00:02:09.770> but<00:02:10.040> I<00:02:10.070> think<00:02:10.369> to

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:10.520 
it's performing better but I think to

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.360 
it's performing better but I think to
just<00:02:10.759> get<00:02:10.970> an<00:02:11.240> accurate<00:02:11.480> reading<00:02:11.959> that<00:02:12.470> may<00:02:13.310> be

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
just get an accurate reading that may be

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.080 
just get an accurate reading that may be
what<00:02:13.670> he<00:02:13.850> believes<00:02:14.860> is<00:02:15.860> the<00:02:16.100> best<00:02:16.340> bat<00:02:16.580> for<00:02:16.880> him

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
what he believes is the best bat for him

that's great about the sci fi system is

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.039 
that's great about the sci fi system is
that<00:02:45.129> allows<00:02:45.459> our<00:02:45.790> players<00:02:46.120> an<00:02:46.450> opportunity

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
to have confidence and I think to

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:53.119 
to have confidence and I think to
initiate<00:02:49.989> that<00:02:50.640> you<00:02:51.640> take<00:02:51.879> away<00:02:52.150> the<00:02:52.540> doubt<00:02:53.049> of

initiate that you take away the doubt of

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:55.860 
initiate that you take away the doubt of
do<00:02:54.129> I<00:02:54.190> have<00:02:54.430> the<00:02:54.549> best<00:02:54.700> weapon<00:02:55.090> in<00:02:55.180> my<00:02:55.299> hand<00:02:55.329> do

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
do I have the best weapon in my hand do

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.289 
do I have the best weapon in my hand do
I<00:02:55.900> have<00:02:56.079> the<00:02:56.200> best<00:02:56.349> tool<00:02:56.670> and<00:02:57.670> so<00:02:57.879> yeah<00:02:58.060> I<00:02:58.090> don't

00:02:58.289 --> 00:02:58.299 
I have the best tool and so yeah I don't

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:00.360 
I have the best tool and so yeah I don't
think<00:02:58.629> there's<00:02:58.750> any<00:02:58.840> question<00:02:59.049> that<00:02:59.590> when<00:03:00.220> our

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
think there's any question that when our

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.940 
think there's any question that when our
guys<00:03:00.579> finished<00:03:00.970> bat<00:03:01.150> testing<00:03:01.500> they<00:03:02.500> know<00:03:02.709> this

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
guys finished bat testing they know this

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:04.680 
guys finished bat testing they know this
is<00:03:03.099> the<00:03:03.220> best<00:03:03.400> bat<00:03:03.670> that<00:03:03.849> I<00:03:03.940> can<00:03:04.090> be<00:03:04.209> swinging

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
is the best bat that I can be swinging

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:09.449 
is the best bat that I can be swinging
for<00:03:05.530> me<00:03:05.769> I<00:03:07.680> think<00:03:08.680> anytime<00:03:08.980> you<00:03:09.159> have

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 
for me I think anytime you have

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:10.860 
for me I think anytime you have
knowledge<00:03:09.760> doesn't<00:03:10.299> matter<00:03:10.480> what<00:03:10.690> you're

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
knowledge doesn't matter what you're

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:12.990 
knowledge doesn't matter what you're
doing<00:03:11.230> it<00:03:11.590> just<00:03:11.650> gives<00:03:12.010> you<00:03:12.190> I<00:03:12.220> think<00:03:12.579> an<00:03:12.700> added

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
doing it just gives you I think an added

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.300 
doing it just gives you I think an added
edge<00:03:13.180> mentally<00:03:13.810> that<00:03:14.319> you're<00:03:14.950> going<00:03:15.099> to<00:03:15.159> have

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
edge mentally that you're going to have

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:19.349 
edge mentally that you're going to have
a<00:03:15.340> great<00:03:15.549> performance<00:03:16.889> we<00:03:17.889> have<00:03:18.040> a<00:03:18.069> player<00:03:18.459> we

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:19.359 
a great performance we have a player we

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:21.869 
a great performance we have a player we
call<00:03:19.599> him<00:03:19.659> the<00:03:19.750> bat<00:03:19.959> destroyer<00:03:20.639> he's<00:03:21.639> taking

00:03:21.869 --> 00:03:21.879 
call him the bat destroyer he's taking

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:24.300 
call him the bat destroyer he's taking
bats<00:03:22.269> and<00:03:22.540> he<00:03:22.629> could<00:03:22.810> flatten<00:03:23.109> Batson<00:03:23.799> in<00:03:24.010> one

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 
bats and he could flatten Batson in one

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:27.839 
bats and he could flatten Batson in one
day<00:03:24.549> where<00:03:25.269> most<00:03:25.810> guys<00:03:26.139> can<00:03:26.379> get<00:03:26.530> 3<00:03:26.829> 400<00:03:27.519> swings

00:03:27.839 --> 00:03:27.849
