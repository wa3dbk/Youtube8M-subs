when<00:02:59.890> we<00:03:00.040> knew<00:03:00.280> that<00:03:01.090> Friday<00:03:01.960> was<00:03:02.290> the

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
when we knew that Friday was the

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:04.110 
when we knew that Friday was the
deadline<00:03:02.770> it<00:03:03.040> was<00:03:03.160> either<00:03:03.310> they<00:03:03.880> were<00:03:04.000> going

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
deadline it was either they were going

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.310 
deadline it was either they were going
to<00:03:04.210> come<00:03:04.420> here<00:03:04.720> or<00:03:04.840> they<00:03:04.930> were<00:03:05.020> going<00:03:05.140> to<00:03:05.230> get

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:05.320 
to come here or they were going to get

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.980 
to come here or they were going to get
put<00:03:05.530> to<00:03:05.620> death<00:03:05.860> but<00:03:06.250> in<00:03:06.520> our<00:03:06.880> reality<00:03:07.150> a<00:03:07.570> lot<00:03:07.900> of

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:07.990 
put to death but in our reality a lot of

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:09.420 
put to death but in our reality a lot of
animals<00:03:08.320> are<00:03:08.410> killed<00:03:08.680> just<00:03:08.980> because<00:03:09.070> they've

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
animals are killed just because they've

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.370 
animals are killed just because they've
outlived<00:03:09.790> their<00:03:10.030> usefulness<00:03:10.060> or<00:03:10.990> people

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.380 
outlived their usefulness or people

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:13.770 
outlived their usefulness or people
can't<00:03:11.590> take<00:03:11.770> care<00:03:11.980> of<00:03:12.040> them<00:03:12.220> anymore<00:03:12.310> so<00:03:13.270> the

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
can't take care of them anymore so the

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.110 
can't take care of them anymore so the
ultimate<00:03:13.930> goal<00:03:14.260> would<00:03:14.620> really<00:03:14.830> be<00:03:15.100> not<00:03:15.730> to<00:03:15.970> do

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
ultimate goal would really be not to do

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.840 
ultimate goal would really be not to do
any<00:03:16.270> more<00:03:16.360> rescues<00:03:16.930> not<00:03:17.170> to<00:03:17.320> have<00:03:17.530> to<00:03:17.830> to<00:03:18.610> save

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:18.850 
any more rescues not to have to to save

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:20.850 
any more rescues not to have to to save
animals<00:03:19.180> from<00:03:19.540> death<00:03:19.780> because<00:03:20.440> they're<00:03:20.650> no

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:20.860 
animals from death because they're no

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.090 
animals from death because they're no
longer<00:03:21.250> of<00:03:21.340> any<00:03:21.430> use<00:03:21.610> to<00:03:22.150> humans<00:03:22.780> and

longer of any use to humans and

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.440 
longer of any use to humans and
