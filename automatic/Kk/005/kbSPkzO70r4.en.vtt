00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
the car a little bit lower center of

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.120 
the car a little bit lower center of
gravity<00:01:56.640> and<00:01:57.210> the<00:01:58.080> engine<00:01:58.470> also<00:01:58.590> produces

gravity and the engine also produces
excellent<00:01:59.340> lowdown<00:01:59.940> torque<00:02:00.270> so<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:01.500> car<00:02:01.680> is

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
excellent lowdown torque so the car is

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.070 
excellent lowdown torque so the car is
extremely<00:02:02.280> fast<00:02:02.850> and<00:02:03.180> the<00:02:03.270> 0<00:02:03.659> to<00:02:03.750> 100

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.080 
extremely fast and the 0 to 100

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.730 
extremely fast and the 0 to 100
kilometers<00:02:04.500> an<00:02:04.590> hour<00:02:04.680> in<00:02:05.159> about<00:02:05.400> 4.6<00:02:06.090> seconds

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
kilometers an hour in about 4.6 seconds

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.910 
kilometers an hour in about 4.6 seconds
CC<00:02:07.740> needs<00:02:07.950> about<00:02:08.399> 280<00:02:09.209> kilometers<00:02:09.780> an<00:02:09.899> hour<00:02:10.019> so

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
CC needs about 280 kilometers an hour so

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.180 
CC needs about 280 kilometers an hour so
huge<00:02:11.610> performance<00:02:12.060> in<00:02:12.510> this<00:02:12.810> car<00:02:13.080> as<00:02:14.010> I

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
huge performance in this car as I
