00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.619
 after the return of the CB 500 

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:24.900
 the round launch on the same platform cbr 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:24.900
 500 is an even more sporting version 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.840
 It's the same bike as the CB 500 only that it 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.809
 has a complete fairing improving 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.610
 stick the dynamic and here the suspension and 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.550
 off end of the year is a bit more 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.860
 long learned CIGIG give but they think 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:47.300
 sports and give me is loud almost as 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.300
 comfortable as the version reads 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:00.330
 For me, the highlight is the 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.970
 fairing with much resemblance to cbru 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:04.949
 both lighthouse and layout colors you 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:07.970
 looking at motorcycle first view if 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.970
 confuses a lot 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.440
 one of the main competitors in addition to 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.990
 300 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:35.630
 even with the smaller displacement it costs 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:39.740
 about 21 thousand reais with abs 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:41.540
 while 24,500 waves is very close and 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.640
 in the performance part they are also 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:46.310
 resembles the big difference here is the 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:50.110
 touching the pilot did not mention a comfort 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.110
 greater by the force it has on the motor 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:13.190
 the great difference lies in the strength of the 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:15.830
 engine an agreement I can walk 4 5 thousand 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:18.410
 rpm by a higher gear and she 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:21.080
 answered loud whether with a croup or not 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:23.360
 rise while the time ninja 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.190
 whole that more stressful turn she 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.530
 walks very well only you have to give 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:30.140
 10 thousand turns up and the wave does not 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.120
 transmits much more comfort in the 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.520
 is a little more show 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:37.250
 long you have a better dog 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:39.950
 fantastic braking 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:42.560
 Funk wave with abs you can cassar 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:45.200
 a fruit shape they see say there 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.320
 she even fix by putting the wheel 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:50.330
 on the track is a brake 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:54.130
 one- touch cycling make this 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:54.130
 difference may be worth it
