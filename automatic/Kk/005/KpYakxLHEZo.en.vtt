00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:51.890 
me shift a little bit on how I view that

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.080 
me shift a little bit on how I view that
obviously<00:00:52.890> you<00:00:53.070> got<00:00:53.190> to<00:00:53.340> take<00:00:53.460> each<00:00:53.670> team<00:00:53.940> on<00:00:54.059> a

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
obviously you got to take each team on a

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.689 
obviously you got to take each team on a
case-by-case<00:00:54.350> basis<00:00:55.350> but<00:00:55.920> with<00:00:56.100> that<00:00:56.219> said<00:00:56.520> it

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
case-by-case basis but with that said it

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.790 
case-by-case basis but with that said it
is<00:00:56.730> a<00:00:56.850> different<00:00:57.360> perspective<00:00:57.600> that<00:00:58.079> I<00:00:58.140> really

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
is a different perspective that I really

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.130 
is a different perspective that I really
am<00:00:58.890> starting<00:00:59.190> to<00:00:59.370> believe<00:00:59.460> in<00:01:00.000> that<00:01:00.449> maybe<00:01:00.960> the

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
am starting to believe in that maybe the

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.349 
am starting to believe in that maybe the
betting<00:01:01.469> market<00:01:01.890> hasn't<00:01:02.489> even<00:01:02.969> though<00:01:03.180> that

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
betting market hasn't even though that

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.090 
betting market hasn't even though that
the<00:01:03.570> oddsmakers<00:01:04.110> may<00:01:04.619> want<00:01:04.830> to<00:01:04.920> try<00:01:05.010> to

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
the oddsmakers may want to try to

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.710 
the oddsmakers may want to try to
protect<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.519> books<00:01:05.729> and<00:01:05.909> attach<00:01:06.150> a<00:01:06.330> premium

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
protect the books and attach a premium

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.750 
protect the books and attach a premium
maybe<00:01:07.200> they<00:01:07.350> just<00:01:07.380> haven't<00:01:07.650> adjusted<00:01:08.010> enough

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
maybe they just haven't adjusted enough

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.760 
maybe they just haven't adjusted enough
and<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.420> team<00:01:09.689> is<00:01:09.960> supposed<00:01:10.320> to<00:01:10.650> be

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
and the team is supposed to be

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.130 
and the team is supposed to be
overvalued<00:01:11.100> but<00:01:11.670> they're<00:01:11.850> not<00:01:12.060> yet<00:01:12.479> if<00:01:12.720> they

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
overvalued but they're not yet if they

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.230 
overvalued but they're not yet if they
keep<00:01:13.320> covering<00:01:13.770> so<00:01:14.040> I<00:01:14.070> agree<00:01:14.700> with<00:01:14.850> you<00:01:15.000> there

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240

and we talked earlier about the Florida
defense<00:03:20.320> Louisville's<00:03:20.820> very<00:03:21.820> much<00:03:22.000> like<00:03:22.209> a

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 
defense Louisville's very much like a

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:24.479 
defense Louisville's very much like a
different<00:03:22.630> style<00:03:22.900> of<00:03:23.049> Defense<00:03:23.410> yeah<00:03:23.620> but<00:03:24.130> they

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:24.489 
different style of Defense yeah but they

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:25.890 
different style of Defense yeah but they
were<00:03:24.549> they<00:03:24.700> force<00:03:24.910> 19<00:03:25.329> turnovers<00:03:25.570> a<00:03:25.870> game

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
were they force 19 turnovers a game

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.930 
were they force 19 turnovers a game
against<00:03:26.410> opponents<00:03:26.620> who<00:03:26.890> only<00:03:27.070> averaged<00:03:27.519> 13

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
against opponents who only averaged 13

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.390 
against opponents who only averaged 13
turnovers<00:03:28.150> another<00:03:29.049> huge<00:03:29.500> differential<00:03:30.040> and

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
turnovers another huge differential and

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.699 
turnovers another huge differential and
if<00:03:30.760> you<00:03:30.880> watch<00:03:31.060> that<00:03:31.329> game<00:03:31.540> as<00:03:32.049> good<00:03:32.320> as<00:03:32.500> the

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:32.709 
if you watch that game as good as the

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:34.949 
if you watch that game as good as the
big<00:03:33.010> men<00:03:33.190> were<00:03:33.370> in<00:03:33.610> Colorado<00:03:33.970> State<00:03:34.480> they

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959 
big men were in Colorado State they

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:35.970 
big men were in Colorado State they
couldn't<00:03:35.260> get<00:03:35.320> him<00:03:35.440> the<00:03:35.500> ball<00:03:35.650> because<00:03:35.860> the

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980 
couldn't get him the ball because the

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:38.039 
couldn't get him the ball because the
guards<00:03:36.310> were<00:03:36.430> pressured<00:03:36.850> so<00:03:37.090> much<00:03:37.299> we<00:03:37.810> may<00:03:37.989> see

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:38.049 
guards were pressured so much we may see

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:39.509 
guards were pressured so much we may see
that<00:03:38.320> again<00:03:38.470> here<00:03:38.799> well<00:03:38.980> I<00:03:39.010> think<00:03:39.100> the<00:03:39.340> biggest

00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:39.519 
that again here well I think the biggest

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:40.770 
that again here well I think the biggest
difference<00:03:39.700> between<00:03:40.209> these<00:03:40.299> two<00:03:40.360> team<00:03:40.750> is

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
difference between these two team is

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.080 
difference between these two team is
that<00:03:41.049> they're<00:03:41.200> both<00:03:41.410> good<00:03:42.100> defensively<00:03:42.820> and

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.090 
that they're both good defensively and

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:46.440 
that they're both good defensively and
that's<00:03:43.570> kind<00:03:44.290> of<00:03:44.410> been<00:03:44.620> the<00:03:44.950> what<00:03:45.820> Dana<00:03:46.060> Altman

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
that's kind of been the what Dana Altman

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:48.120 
that's kind of been the what Dana Altman
did<00:03:46.600> would<00:03:46.780> Creighton<00:03:47.230> when<00:03:47.560> he<00:03:47.739> was<00:03:47.890> there<00:03:48.100> he

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:48.130 
did would Creighton when he was there he

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:50.580 
did would Creighton when he was there he
had<00:03:48.310> them<00:03:48.760> play<00:03:48.970> great<00:03:49.299> defense<00:03:49.329> but<00:03:50.320> i<00:03:50.350> think

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 
had them play great defense but i think

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:52.650 
had them play great defense but i think
it's<00:03:50.739> the<00:03:51.040> offensive<00:03:51.730> side<00:03:51.880> of<00:03:51.940> the<00:03:52.090> ball<00:03:52.180> that

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:52.660 
it's the offensive side of the ball that

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:54.420 
it's the offensive side of the ball that
is<00:03:52.870> the<00:03:53.140> biggest<00:03:53.500> difference<00:03:53.829> between<00:03:54.310> these

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
is the biggest difference between these

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.150 
is the biggest difference between these
two<00:03:54.489> clubs<00:03:54.970> louisville<00:03:55.870> has<00:03:56.109> an<00:03:56.680> efficient

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:57.160 
two clubs louisville has an efficient

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.030 
two clubs louisville has an efficient
offense<00:03:57.609> but<00:03:58.150> argan<00:03:58.630> dozen<00:03:59.109> I<00:03:59.230> think<00:03:59.470> Altman's

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
offense but argan dozen I think Altman's

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.560 
offense but argan dozen I think Altman's
taking<00:04:00.400> him<00:04:00.489> as<00:04:00.579> far<00:04:00.940> as<00:04:01.090> they<00:04:01.239> could<00:04:01.299> possibly

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:01.570 
taking him as far as they could possibly

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:03.569 
taking him as far as they could possibly
go<00:04:02.109> I<00:04:02.140> was<00:04:02.410> surprised<00:04:02.739> when<00:04:02.859> I<00:04:02.980> saw<00:04:03.010> this<00:04:03.310> line

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:03.579 
go I was surprised when I saw this line

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:05.910 
go I was surprised when I saw this line
open<00:04:04.150> nine<00:04:04.540> and<00:04:04.750> a<00:04:04.780> half<00:04:04.810> now<00:04:05.049> sitting<00:04:05.590> at<00:04:05.680> ten

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:05.920 
open nine and a half now sitting at ten

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.849 
open nine and a half now sitting at ten
i<00:04:05.950> made<00:04:06.280> my<00:04:06.459> line<00:04:06.700> 13<00:04:07.180> 13<00:04:07.630> and<00:04:07.780> a<00:04:07.840> hat<00:04:08.049> so<00:04:08.829> I

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:08.859 
i made my line 13 13 and a hat so I

00:04:08.859 --> 00:04:12.090 
i made my line 13 13 and a hat so I
think<00:04:09.900> perception<00:04:10.900> is<00:04:11.049> Louisville<00:04:11.799> even

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:12.100 
think perception is Louisville even

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:14.670 
think perception is Louisville even
though<00:04:12.190> they're<00:04:12.370> 90<00:04:12.609> 180<00:04:12.910> s<00:04:13.150> Oregon<00:04:14.109> for<00:04:14.470> no

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 
though they're 90 180 s Oregon for no

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.409 
though they're 90 180 s Oregon for no
cover<00:04:15.010> to<00:04:15.190> the<00:04:15.220> last<00:04:15.400> four<00:04:15.700> I<00:04:15.940> don't<00:04:16.329> think

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:16.419 
cover to the last four I don't think

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:18.659 
cover to the last four I don't think
that<00:04:16.720> Louisville<00:04:17.440> is<00:04:17.530> overvalued<00:04:17.859> right<00:04:18.489> now

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:18.669 
that Louisville is overvalued right now

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:20.310 
that Louisville is overvalued right now
I<00:04:18.700> really<00:04:19.030> don't<00:04:19.150> my<00:04:19.510> only<00:04:19.660> concern<00:04:20.079> is<00:04:20.109> it's

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.320 
I really don't my only concern is it's

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.230 
I really don't my only concern is it's
the<00:04:20.440> pac-12<00:04:20.950> was<00:04:21.430> it<00:04:21.549> has<00:04:21.669> clearly<00:04:21.970> been

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 
the pac-12 was it has clearly been

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.270 
the pac-12 was it has clearly been
undervalued<00:04:22.599> yeah<00:04:23.229> they've<00:04:23.530> done<00:04:23.740> so<00:04:24.039> well

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.280 
undervalued yeah they've done so well

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.879 
undervalued yeah they've done so well
but<00:04:24.849> one<00:04:25.090> thing<00:04:25.240> I<00:04:25.300> really<00:04:25.450> did<00:04:26.440> nothing

00:04:26.879 --> 00:04:26.889 
but one thing I really did nothing

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:10.690 
season long so if it had been right

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:12.330

there<00:07:10.840> the<00:07:11.050> second<00:07:11.410> game<00:07:11.530> they<00:07:12.130> would<00:07:12.250> have

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:12.340 
there the second game they would have

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:13.830
