00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.710
 hello everyone i'm elias 360 and i 

00:00:02.999 --> 00:00:07.020
 I bring this new video and this time I have 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.020
 commented on call of duty ghosts we are 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.970
 in a team duel in fight 

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:13.830
 she faced like pussy followed this map and 

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:15.150
 good playing in the chaine saw you know 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.160
 this light machine gun that you will have me 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.929
 seen in several that he places wearing it and 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.130
 in addition to it then in some more show in 

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:22.109
 the events because it 's a weapon that 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.970
 I like it a lot and it reminds me of the 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.249
 call of duty black war machine 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.659
 ops and the call of duty black ops 2 and 

00:00:26.249 --> 00:00:29.249
 Well, the truth is that I like it 

00:00:27.659 --> 00:00:31.439
 quite has the laser sight and so 

00:00:29.249 --> 00:00:33.210
 so much so that it does not get to aim at all 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.320
 but it does like a kind of zoom 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.940
 from the hip 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.350
 the final result of the game, because 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.910
 it's nothing special, you'll see it 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.440
 the same at the end of the game and you 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.070
 I come to talk about a couple of things yesterday 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:46.110
 today is Wednesday yesterday, Tuesday I was 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.570
 in the finals of the academy and be 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.700
 it was starcraft so I do not understand much 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.260
 but I 'm looking at it a little bit and 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.830
 then a small one was also made 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:58.260
 small debate of whether it is to include call of 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:01:00.810
 ghosts or counter strike global offensive 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.970
 not so that nothing was clear 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:06.010
 it was a very very improvised debate 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:07.900
 Yesterday you saw me some people who 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:09.340
 also come sorte tickets for 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.410
 that could come and good 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.240
 it was those same people who 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:15.520
 they came so nice to meet you 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:18.430
 and also well I come to talk to you 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.970
 some call of duty from wars clone 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:23.200
 wars what this is good for 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.580
 is that you download a 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.630
 application for the mobile is worth me 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.330
 I have the truth is that it is quite 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:31.030
 cool because you can see the menu is not 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:32.860
 of Carlos and so to speak from your 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.410
 own mobile or for tablets too 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:37.960
 and obviously it works well for this 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:40.479
 that allow you allows you to manage a 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.520
 clan me in my case I have one which is 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:45.640
 private because we're only four 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:48.400
 people we are angel josemi sofía and me 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:51.220
 and well it's called Moorish army but if 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:53.920
 I do not remember badly and what about clan wars what 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:56.140
 it consists is basically that you play 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.580
 with your clan if each clan member 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.470
 play separately I think it's 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:01.810
 add points for the clan points of 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.460
 experience which then allow you 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.380
 unlock new new funds 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:08.230
 emblems etcetera and on the other hand 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.880
 also what is clear wars as such the 

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:10.220
 Game mode is a game mode on 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.980
 which one 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.840
 is strategic no more or less like a 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.330
 kind of map with seven points the if 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.100
 I'm not wrong and what you have to do 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.590
 is to defend those points not against others 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:23.780
 clans that challenge you or your clans challenge 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.810
 and well, I imagine that during 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.160
 ocean if what if you keep the point on 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.080
 strategic point if you keep it 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.180
 for more time, they give you more 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.590
 experience points which only 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.230
 affect the clan is worth this means 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.820
 that if someone has a clan and another person 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.230
 not the one that has clan will not have more 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:41.030
 experience points those points of 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.680
 experience are only intended for the 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.050
 clan at least for what I have 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.220
 understood so it's pretty good 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:48.590
 because it's a game mode that does not 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.780
 influences the level of other players and 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.130
 Well, typical things you can not go 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.270
 unlocking emblems and others that 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.220
 It always gives a little more life to the 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:57.140
 game and play with your friends that is what 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.640
 more important I think many times 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.590
 Well then I get with angel and 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.330
 josemi we throw a few games and 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:05.060
 we see that new ones have been unlocked 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:07.280
 emblems for for the clan at the moment 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.959
 Well I tell you what we have done for 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.850
 make the little more grace by detours 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:12.050
 well the Moorish army not ever to 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:14.239
 the best we open it so you can 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:16.480
 States also but the moment not because 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:19.090
 neither are we giving it utility 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.379
 and in fact we almost always play all 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.420
 separately not because we do not usually 

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:24.099
 match you already know that the ground will be 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.930
 of travel others and good also to tell you 

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:28.629
 that I will be this Saturday and this 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:30.489
 Sunday at the 2013 comic book expo 

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:32.709
 madrid for that reason I will not be able to go 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:35.830
 to the event of valladolid which I 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:38.140
 it seems that angel sara sofía and josemi yes 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:40.090
 they're going to go so good they'll be 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:41.620
 there in valladolid and if you are in madrid 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:43.900
 and you want to get closer to the comic book expo 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:46.060
 I'll be worth it so nothing to see if 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.349
 for next year I can get closer to 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:49.450
 that event of valladolid but it is already fixed 

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:51.489
 has coincided this time and little 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:54.400
 more tell me what do you think 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:56.099
 tried the gameplay clan words or the 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.450
 application so to speak better 

00:03:56.099 --> 00:04:00.700
 tell me also to see if they come tablet 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:03.400
 done if they put something new part 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:04.780
 of the mobiles nothing little more here 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.609
 you have the final result of the game 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:08.620
 We won is 39 I think it's 

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:10.150
 pretty good he was playing alone and 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:12.310
 well also tell you that sometimes 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.930
 you see the level has changed from a game 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:15.819
 to another is because I keep gameplays and the 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:17.320
 I'm going up so nothing is there 18 6 

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:20.350
 I hope you liked it and nothing 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:22.950
 more than saying goodbye elías 360 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:22.950
 until next time 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:35.419
 in 2002 

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:35.419
 that
