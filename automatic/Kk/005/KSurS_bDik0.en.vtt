00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.149
 Rooms 

00:01:56.989 --> 00:02:00.920
 what is the target group and which 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:03.349
 Possibilities offer the rooms 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.450
 you for example on a business audience 

00:02:03.349 --> 00:02:08.420
 Private guests actually have a whole one 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.549
 various target groups most people come 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:14.690
 really for the experience so the special 

00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:17.030
 sleep and that of families to 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.290
 to some older people who have it 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.329
 great find 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.290
 it is generally so far 

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:23.269
 private 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.799
 but we do notice that too 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:26.750
 teambuilding days 

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:28.430
 such as a company outing 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.889
 shares that stays overnight and then one 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:33.470
 two-day workshop has that anyway 

00:02:30.889 --> 00:02:35.720
 also ask seed so there is a bit 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:38.090
 combined actually yes 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.139
 luxury bed and breakfast a hotel with 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.760
 few capacities 

00:02:39.139 --> 00:02:42.620
 maybe the best description is for 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.519
 glamping how do you see this company 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.599
 self 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:46.639
 yes you really know if 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:50.169
 glamping so we try to go into it 

00:02:46.639 --> 00:02:52.810
 the trend of the so glamorous camping 

00:02:50.169 --> 00:02:54.610
 but 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:56.230
 without the campsite so we are absolutely 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:58.030
 no more camping we say we too 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.959
 only the special sleeping places 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.150
 is also a question that still concerns me 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:03.549
 get why no camping anyway 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:05.530
 completely different target group and we have something 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:07.180
 more in the luxury segment 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.040
 also see yourself as competitors 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.709
 for tells in this environment 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.540
 you read yourself not hotels each one 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:14.530
 are actually the standard 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.569
 hotels 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:18.760
 that sounds a bit unkind but it 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:20.890
 well just we are not normal 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:22.390
 hotel 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:24.099
 knife really come to us for the experience 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:27.549
 so that is a completely different target group than 

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:29.200
 my normal hotel world yes you come yourself 

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:32.680
 from hotel world 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:34.000
 your partner comes from the farm world 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.220
 if I can describe it that way I understand 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.440
 both of you are also home like it 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:41.470
 is a design and interior 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:43.030
 how is this hotel the idea arose 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:44.530
 of this hotel 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.180
 yes such a difficult question but that is 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:47.410
 a very small seed that starts to grow 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.090
 grow and that has a number of years 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:51.849
 ago that arose 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:53.109
 I really enjoyed it well 

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:54.160
 to receive people 

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:56.500
 I used to organize congresses 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.970
 organized a lot of trips and I notice 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.489
 that I really like that too 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:02.859
 combine with renovating one 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:05.709
 farm an old farmhouse 

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:06.669
 a beautiful nature area so what goes 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:08.200
 then grow a little 

00:04:06.669 --> 00:04:09.370
 we love it so much 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.260
 travel so how do you get fun 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:12.639
 special place to sleep in the opposite 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:15.430
 the netherlands it was just a trends 

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:17.500
 of which you saw that that yes that 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:18.669
 so develops a bit there 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.530
 indented 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:23.770
 so that's just a combination of you 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:25.180
 preferences of your hobbies 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:27.400
 interior design 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:30.130
 the remodel to see yes there is also one 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:33.130
 market is on the way to the hotel and 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:36.160
 I drive through the residential area and through a residential area 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:37.210
 when I reach the hotel it starts 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.250
 there is a very large nature reserve 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:42.729
 How did you end up on this one? 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:44.500
 place have been search of 3 years 

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:46.520
 we are from Delft, so that is you 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:47.840
 Reasonably close 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.699
 and then you start looking for one 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:52.180
 old farmhouse with god where you have ideas 

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:52.180
 can realize 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:54.800
 in addition, it was whole for us 

00:04:53.599 --> 00:04:56.659
 important that it is the right destination 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:58.280
 So we had five not one 

00:04:56.659 --> 00:05:00.740
 enter the trajectory of 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:02.840
 according to municipality permit and such 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:05.740
 sometimes there are very few locations 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:08.659
 where your own ends up or can go 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:10.129
 through the business association 

00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:12.169
 I do about it when getting in 

00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:14.449
 connected I got the tip of this 

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:16.220
 the old nature campsite that stops it and 

00:05:14.449 --> 00:05:17.569
 they are looking for a new one 

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:20.300
 destination or 8 buyers for the 

00:05:17.569 --> 00:05:22.130
 farms for the land and yes via via 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:24.740
 we are therefore at the municipality of vlaardingen 

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:25.400
 ended up and we have our plan 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:26.870
 submitted 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:29.569
 there were several people as a species 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:31.699
 of competition this was the best match 

00:05:29.569 --> 00:05:32.870
 in the municipal policy 

00:05:31.699 --> 00:05:35.780
 so that 's just the one 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:38.150
 recreational public function retention 

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:39.199
 so that it is also for the citizens of 

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:42.380
 vlaardingen municipality 

00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:44.180
 is a very nice place to be 

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:46.069
 you have become your own owner 

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:47.690
 from the farm and preferably one and a half 

00:05:46.069 --> 00:05:49.190
 hectares of land 

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:50.509
 That means there is still at least one 

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:51.190
 plenty of options to get out of 

00:05:50.509 --> 00:05:53.750
 extend 

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:55.039
 let's take them two three four five years 

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:57.139
 continue 

00:05:55.039 --> 00:05:58.819
 what does it look like then i think there is 

00:05:57.139 --> 00:06:01.069
 a few more special places to sleep 

00:05:58.819 --> 00:06:03.860
 have come with you depending on 

00:06:01.069 --> 00:06:05.840
 yes where the light asks that it will 

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:07.460
 We now think after half a year from year 

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:09.740
 able to judge well 

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:12.860
 I hope so, at least I suspect 

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:14.389
 that we are busy with the old farm 

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:16.039
 because we still have that floor 

00:06:14.389 --> 00:06:17.810
 so what we are not used yet 

00:06:16.039 --> 00:06:20.110
 hopefully there can still be bedrooms there 

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:20.110
 realize 

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:25.669
 I think the shape is like you are now 

00:06:22.639 --> 00:06:28.279
 is actually good from the beasts 

00:06:25.669 --> 00:06:31.340
 from the vegetable garden to the boats so that 

00:06:28.279 --> 00:06:32.479
 garden cafe and so not much from that 

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:34.130
 change but we just might 

00:06:32.479 --> 00:06:36.229
 have some more places 

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:38.659
 yes that you had sleeping places for a while 

00:06:36.229 --> 00:06:41.029
 hanging around and vegetable garden walk around some animals 

00:06:38.659 --> 00:06:43.219
 the farm is arranged as one 

00:06:41.029 --> 00:06:44.569
 restaurant that I think you too 

00:06:43.219 --> 00:06:45.380
 open to people who are not 

00:06:44.569 --> 00:06:47.389
 stay 

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:48.650
 how how is the interest of that 

00:06:47.389 --> 00:06:51.110
 target group so far 

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:52.819
 yes that is really very big we people 

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:54.889
 love to come and watch 

00:06:52.819 --> 00:06:56.820
 apart from all sleeping places but it 

00:06:54.889 --> 00:06:59.730
 vlaardingen is missing anyway 

00:06:56.820 --> 00:07:01.620
 green terraces where you can relax in the 

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:04.470
 summer can sit but also that outside 

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:05.460
 atmosphere so people say you too 

00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:07.080
 can you and sit inside 

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:10.020
 we always have it green 

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:12.570
 feeling that has been booked 

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:13.950
 so people know us within the municipality 

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:15.780
 very good to find yes and also because 

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:17.130
 we also offer that pizzas 

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:19.050
 people can come to cycle themselves 

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:20.760
 baking it gets its own garden people 

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:22.050
 can come barbecue so you offer too 

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:24.870
 a different kind 

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:25.950
 concept that also simply attracts people 

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:28.020
 Yes 

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:30.720
 Finally what do you want to share with us about it 

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:33.660
 the investment you have made and is 

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:36.530
 what is the back foil model about the 

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:38.610
 finances I won't tell much 

00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:40.200
 It we will just take a number of years 

00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:41.310
 have to go around for it 

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:44.340
 eventually to earn back 

00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:46.320
 but that speaks for itself 

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:48.000
 we just look at the needs 

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:49.380
 and where we can respond 

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.330
 we also try to be flexible with this 

00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:52.950
 I think that's what the company is 

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:54.900
 to have that piece and the garden cafe and the 

00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:56.130
 and the outside hotel would fire so we would 

00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:57.960
 can actually look on three legs 

00:07:56.130 --> 00:08:02.000
 from where should we develop 

00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:02.000
 and what does the future bring for us
