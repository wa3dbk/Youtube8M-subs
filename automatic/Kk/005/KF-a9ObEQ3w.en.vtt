00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:01.320 
month of now this month not like the end

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:05.060 
month of now this month not like the end
of<00:05:01.470> the<00:05:01.680> middle<00:05:01.950> this<00:05:03.050> DLC<00:05:04.050> and<00:05:04.080> the<00:05:04.410> next<00:05:04.680> DLC

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:05.070 
of the middle this DLC and the next DLC

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:07.640 
of the middle this DLC and the next DLC
if<00:05:05.190> they<00:05:05.340> are<00:05:05.460> going<00:05:05.580> to<00:05:05.670> release<00:05:05.910> it<00:05:06.150> or<00:05:06.960> they

if they are going to release it or they

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:10.640 
if they are going to release it or they
gonna<00:05:07.770> release<00:05:08.610> it<00:05:08.880> the<00:05:09.180> next<00:05:09.930> one<00:05:10.170> off<00:05:10.410> though

gonna release it the next one off though

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:11.990

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:12.000 
because they cannot release at the same

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.390 
because they cannot release at the same
time<00:05:12.150> the<00:05:12.300> other<00:05:12.390> DLC<00:05:12.840> goes<00:05:12.990> out<00:05:13.170> it<00:05:13.740> just<00:05:13.800> that

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:14.400 
time the other DLC goes out it just that

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.970 
time the other DLC goes out it just that
wouldn't<00:05:14.700> be<00:05:14.760> smart<00:05:14.970> like<00:05:15.410> salesman<00:05:16.410> option

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:16.980 
wouldn't be smart like salesman option

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:19.430 
wouldn't be smart like salesman option
thing<00:05:17.300> cuz<00:05:18.300> this<00:05:18.660> is<00:05:18.750> either<00:05:18.900> someone's<00:05:19.350> gonna

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:19.440 
thing cuz this is either someone's gonna

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.650 
thing cuz this is either someone's gonna
buy<00:05:19.620> the<00:05:19.680> ghost<00:05:20.370> GLC<00:05:20.940> or<00:05:21.120> they<00:05:21.270> gonna<00:05:21.360> buy<00:05:21.600> that

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:21.660

in the middle of both DLC so this could

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:29.420 
in the middle of both DLC so this could
