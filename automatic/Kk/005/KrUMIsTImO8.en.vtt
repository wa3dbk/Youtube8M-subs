00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.170
 immediately the very first tactic we have 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.000
 now that the guy can go between the 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.860
 bombs that find if you have to go 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.660

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.590
 goes there and always stays one 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.820
 a bit behind and tried and 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.040

 the variegated plants and I do so here 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.510
 just waiting I knew that in a bomb 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.979

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.990
 the Bible but to set in Biscayne 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.280
 Bullet Fight Second bullet hit the views 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.360
 I immediately start the tree and the start too 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.490
 immediately the next round 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.400
 it's just so if you have to go that 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.290
 always try a little 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:30.030
 don't go over the middle limit if you like 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.110
 just the folder and you try in it 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.299
 just in the middle of the folder and lie too 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.650
 draw what you should not go over 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.430
 you just stick to that too 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.930
 very here 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.490
 I kept silent on the M8 and a quarter 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.750
 immediately not bomb the game is leaking 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.310
 a little bit that you see in 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.840
 theater must be what I recorded 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.070
 I like this very much with theater 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.299
 many people see so I thought upload 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.400
 just fire for a moment 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.020
 now she remers and effect side 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.220
 is already meant that you just whole again 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.380
 neither on idolatry nor immediately 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.570
 try to walk after a tree and 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.640
 always communicate very well with your team 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.299
 in search history is not so much the 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.189
 intention 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.479
 eeyore everyone and just go on 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.369
 run off no, it's the intention 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.140
 communicate with your team and stay 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.100
 communicate keep telling where the 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.170
 Enemy demolished 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.759
 keep telling what you see movement in 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.470
 the distance because then you can now your team 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.000
 master run and can be your team 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.980
 has been trying to turn the enemy 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.480
 And then it's so easy to actually 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.640
 and sisters go to the straw jar 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.200
 winning is all about communication 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.120
 just go run to the evening we go 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.710
 to the baby boom have the one 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.900
 site princes hands other 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:26.550
 texel drive one m8 for example other 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.050
 worldly machine that the a little further 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.490
 then you all have to go 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.540
 agree that you search and destroy 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:31.950
 is going to play 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.300
 so it is also intended that you 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.040
 always play in a gate that is 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.810
 actually the best tip I can give 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.820
 just reconcile such a play in the 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.680
 porch watch as your audience go players 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:42.840
 from 6 to 6 between the current best of 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.820
 so fire the person who has 4 case white 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.650
 won then you can just do what you want 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:48.390
 want to play there was josti scene 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.220
 sometimes good people play in but not 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.080
 everyone who plays it tactically 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.640
 my walked places that the flow so really 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.860
 just comparative against other clans 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.020
 you just have to go against other good people 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.910
 have a tactic when playing solo 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:01.800
 always try to put your headset in there 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:03.480
 to do and try to communicate with 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.160
 people who are a team sometimes you have 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.660
 luck that you play with Dutch people 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.700
 Sometimes you are unlucky that you are French 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.650
 stuff especially such a place or two 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.600
 growers what you hear is sea ​​forts prayer 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.980
 show burgers sudoku the will of allah 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.570
 and you just don't hear one ass what the 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:19.110
 French can't speak English like you 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:21.420
 with 1000 plays you only hear them 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:23.310
 are ready bla bla that swearing ordinary 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:24.720
 very sorry together so you just have to 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.610
 lucky you or with chilling out 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.870
 English people are sitting or you have to be lucky 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:29.580
 You just have my Dutch 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.960
 is usually when you play a big part you come 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.270
 well with dutch if you just 

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:34.440
 between 12 and seth in the afternoon 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:36.300
 You can also speak Dutch in the evening 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:38.670
 most of them encounter a piece again 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:40.260
 less is just try to communicate 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:42.540
 with your team and just try tactics 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.770
 meet up try a sniper rifle 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.970
 always put a little bit behind 

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:46.740
 that kind of the 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.870
 so behind my can keep the back 

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:51.030
 can cover just try a so driver 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:52.740
 a little bit further than the sniper 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:55.050
 cram the rifle and try for example 

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:56.580
 two singles run up the map to 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:57.180
 one is the big one to get in their back 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:59.130
 come 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.960
 just try your own tactics 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:02.430
 invent and if you own tactics 

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:04.590
 we will be there again 20 times 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:06.270
 to mee back because once you 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:07.830
 carries out a tactic and kids 

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:10.080
 he feeds a weed and one more time 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:11.940
 from the better and crime time especially them 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:12.750
 so walk as soon as the baby gets them 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.160
 route 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.930
 so try different tactics 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.670
 I think and I just try 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:20.160
 perform well with for example 

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:22.350
 try a port that were in your shit 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.640
 yes the only thing i can say is try 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:24.840
 to communicate and it all runs and 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:26.190
 communication I just can't 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.640
 I can't say more about it either 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:28.890
 to give 

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:30.510
 And yes, the guy is now losing 

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:32.130
 that guy you also just thief and so 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:33.419
 you have to stay a little behind if you 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:35.130
 you can run forward, you can slowly 

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:36.180
 run forward but always keep it 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:38.070
 note that the ni 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:39.810
 can go and plant if you have to 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:40.919
 Tekken so must go car planting on 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:42.990
 Take into account that you will be as soon as possible 

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:44.370
 plant because you only have one and a half minutes 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:46.289
 at the bol site for sale you have other 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:47.759
 or minute to color under bonsai and you 

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:49.800
 it is also only a minute and a half to that 

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:51.509
 bomb to plant and then you have 45 again 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.860
 seconds of course to the bomb then again 

00:04:51.509 --> 00:04:54.210
 to go thief and the and if you then 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:56.009
 it that goes beyond you must 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:57.539
 of course since it must be diffuse then 

00:04:56.009 --> 00:04:58.889
 you run towards it again but good thing 

00:04:57.539 --> 00:05:00.210
 was pretty much everything I wanted to go 

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:01.680
 telling is there is is like the 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:03.330
 very fun game to play 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:05.520
 but sometimes are a bit 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:06.990
 bullshit if someone like you for example 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.639
 cuts through the wall and if someone has one 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:09.840
 make walbeehm because it is so 

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:11.370
 and I don't scatter sisters again 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.780
 bonus once you are dead you are 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:13.470
 just cards asshole you can't do anything 

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:15.150
 do more 

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:16.830
 maybe you like the weather 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:18.599
 more lip jars that I wanted to see 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:19.710
 just play liveleak play 

00:05:18.599 --> 00:05:21.210
 let me know in a comment 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:22.320
 boys, because the last few days are greasy 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:24.270

 I am in his place right now 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:28.800
 I think that token rank 20 is it 

00:05:26.849 --> 00:05:30.479
 point is to get a forest division 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:32.460
 you must be lucky some people like that 

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:34.229
 come a game was a division all the 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:35.639
 people who come in at 300 gates 

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:37.470
 wash the fish but I now follow 

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:38.940
 my 40 brushes are playing and I am still sitting 

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:40.320
 always in plate there in the they try 

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:42.060
 the master to come but so far 

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:43.560
 failed other times I have 

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:44.849
 being in masts makes me too 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:46.590
 not much off I try some more 

00:05:44.849 --> 00:05:47.849
 play better and could play in the 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:49.169
 then also want to see on my channel 

00:05:47.849 --> 00:05:50.970

00:05:49.169 --> 00:05:52.260

 grab zooms the last person 

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:56.010
