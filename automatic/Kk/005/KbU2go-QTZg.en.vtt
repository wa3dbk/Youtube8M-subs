00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.040
 It's about what you go low carb on the go 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:13.490

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:15.900
 for example, have fun while ok so 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:18.000
 many ask me what can you do on the way 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.350
 eat low carb moderately my video too 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.279
 of course, you want to take it easy 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.830
 they're getting a little somewhere 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:25.439
 student food or doner with extra 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.599
 Meat and zack one builds on musculature 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.310
 but in the dom open as I do not have it 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.410
 so easy that means low carb 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.890
 on the way and I have now easy 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.180
 times mcdonald's selected yes I know 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.410
 inferior food and so on and so on 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.829
 so on I know it all and it 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:43.110
 True, there were just times 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.300
 mcdonald's saved me too 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.469
 that was for example by early what it was 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.050
 a few months ago 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.420
 drove my smart from customer to customer 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.440
 am and I were, pre-cooked me 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.879
 but I have my two 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.460
 Checks taken and said okay 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.809

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.430
 net I can with a cottage cheese 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:03.690

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.519
 then comes the shake then I train 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.530
 about a shake comes then 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.600
 in the evening between customer 7 and customer eight 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.460
 I am then at the potsdamer place there 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.770
 it then mcdonald's and that has me 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.350
 mostly saved so especially as the 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.020
 mac double was introduced 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:20.189
 ms gives mcdonald's that's what they do 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.590
 they are because you can go easy 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.540
 and please say twice without bread 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.340
 and then the groups without sauce always like 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.350
 now and then you explain that without bread 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.210
 without sauce please and then again without 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.579
 bread without sauce please tell it 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.310
 at the back of two mac without bread without 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:37.049
 sauce and a contrast can her he 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.240
 just make two nights without bread 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.189
 without sauce and then sometime after ten 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.049
 minutes they come fresh 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.490
 Of course on the table because that's there 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.649
 yes, not just at the macd 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.470
 McDonald's on TauentzienstraÃŸe is 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:52.470
 However, that's it, so to speak 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:55.049
 flagship store and all all all stores 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.759
 where there is no how should I say where it is 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.290
 no lease but the 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.579
 really official then we do 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.110
 that is not there you can only say please 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:05.000
 without mustard or ketchup 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:09.129
 that means they deliver the thing to you like that 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.209
 Zac is the bread away 

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:13.220
 and earlier it was just like cookies 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:15.200
 or hamburger must buy that is 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.879
 So spend two euros for two babies 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.940
 need that now we have the wonderful 

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:22.580
 mac that means only 159 times thumb 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.530
 and if you get two of these you have 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.620
 three euros 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:28.640
 enough protein certainly something fat 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.110
 And that should not happen every day 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.989
 make or each meal 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.819
 to the emergency around the rounds 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:37.250
 to come so to speak only on the way 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:39.310
 is that completely ok now we have 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:43.040
 Here's our meat, I have one 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:44.900
 salad ordered it costs 249 which are 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.400
 relatively new before that, there was only this 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.280
 grilled chicken salad etc 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.110
 they cost something 56 euro and 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:55.250
 it's so crazy, that's really it 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:57.709
 such a fries and dickmacher stuff for 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.989
 get the euro and then normal salad 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:02.030
 with so little chicken costs five 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:02.480
 euro 49 or so everything completely broke down 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:04.579
 but good 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.349
 Meanwhile there is this salad is 

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:07.810
 the chef salad is the egg in it 

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:10.730
 bit of cheese and ham 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:12.590
 it costs 249 if that's too expensive 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:15.590
 It can only hold salads in the garden 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:17.420
 Salads are tomato carrots 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:20.359
 tactical but always out because of 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:22.819
 sugar and years you have one 

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:25.069
 meal some vitamins in it with 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:28.040
 a protein here also a bit 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:29.690
 protein and comes over the rounds 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.340
 another coffee or cola zero or 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:33.489
 Anything else and you are definitely 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.870
 first served so that was my tip 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:37.790
 many ask me also what is with doner 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:39.950
 meat that is really the utmost 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:42.079
 Exceptions so if you invite to the doner 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:45.079
 Do you get the meat brings in a box 

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:46.730
 in the other box the salad that it 

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:48.260
 really more greasy meat 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:49.200
 and again inferior there I would 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.629
 stop 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.190
 yes so for the biggest not ok and if 

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:55.110
 Do not worry so much about the calories 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.670
 must be careful is that also completely in 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:57.920
 order 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:00.030
 In any case, that's great 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:02.910
 possibilities to bridge the time 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:06.150
