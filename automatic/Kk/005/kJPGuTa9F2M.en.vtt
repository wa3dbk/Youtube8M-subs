pretty much the the one thing that you

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.320 
pretty much the the one thing that you

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.250 
and destroy you don't necessarily need
ghost<00:02:11.280> because<00:02:11.459> there's<00:02:12.209> not<00:02:12.390> a<00:02:12.450> lot<00:02:12.690> of<00:02:12.720> UAVs

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
ghost because there's not a lot of UAVs

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.809 
ghost because there's not a lot of UAVs
going<00:02:13.560> out

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819 
going out

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:16.959 
going out
and<00:02:13.939> I<00:02:13.969> think<00:02:14.659> even<00:02:15.049> cold<00:02:15.620> blooded<00:02:15.920> and<00:02:16.310> all

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:16.969 
and I think even cold blooded and all

00:02:16.969 --> 00:02:19.030 
and I think even cold blooded and all
the<00:02:17.209> other<00:02:17.540> perks<00:02:17.840> i<00:02:18.049> usually<00:02:18.560> don't<00:02:18.769> think

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
the other perks i usually don't think

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.649 
the other perks i usually don't think
our<00:02:19.159> use<00:02:19.370> will<00:02:19.579> actually<00:02:19.879> become<00:02:20.030> useful<00:02:20.389> and

00:02:20.649 --> 00:02:20.659 
our use will actually become useful and

00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:21.940 
our use will actually become useful and
search<00:02:20.810> in<00:02:20.959> destroy<00:02:21.170> which<00:02:21.409> is<00:02:21.530> really<00:02:21.739> cool

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
search in destroy which is really cool

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.339 
search in destroy which is really cool
so<00:02:22.249> I'm<00:02:22.670> definitely<00:02:22.939> it's<00:02:23.780> not<00:02:23.959> like<00:02:24.109> in<00:02:24.319> a

00:02:24.339 --> 00:02:24.349 
so I'm definitely it's not like in a

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:25.539 
so I'm definitely it's not like in a
modern<00:02:24.590> warfare<00:02:24.709> 2<00:02:24.980> where<00:02:25.159> you<00:02:25.249> could<00:02:25.400> have

00:02:25.539 --> 00:02:25.549 
modern warfare 2 where you could have

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:27.759 
modern warfare 2 where you could have
like<00:02:25.819> one<00:02:26.120> class<00:02:26.389> that<00:02:26.450> could<00:02:26.810> literally<00:02:27.139> go

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:27.769 
like one class that could literally go

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:30.610 
like one class that could literally go
and<00:02:28.040> do<00:02:28.370> work<00:02:28.579> in<00:02:28.819> every<00:02:29.209> game<00:02:29.450> or<00:02:29.749> every<00:02:30.439> game

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
and do work in every game or every game

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.629

search<00:02:34.909> and<00:02:35.090> destroy<00:02:35.209> I<00:02:35.629> mean<00:02:35.900> it<00:02:36.079> literally

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
search and destroy I mean it literally

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.959 
search and destroy I mean it literally
is<00:02:37.180> overpowered<00:02:38.180> but<00:02:39.159> you<00:02:40.159> know<00:02:40.250> I<00:02:40.280> think<00:02:40.790> it's

is overpowered but you know I think it's

00:02:40.969 --> 00:02:43.360

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.809 
killer you should at least have to
control<00:02:45.230> the<00:02:45.379> hunter<00:02:45.590> killer<00:02:45.799> like<00:02:46.669> you

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:48.139 
shouldn't you shouldn't just be able to

00:02:48.139 --> 00:02:49.569 
shouldn't you shouldn't just be able to
throw<00:02:48.469> it<00:02:48.590> up<00:02:48.709> in<00:02:48.799> the<00:02:48.859> air<00:02:48.950> but<00:02:49.219> one<00:02:49.370> of<00:02:49.459> my
