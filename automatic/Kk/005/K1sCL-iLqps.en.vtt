00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:09.780
 video about frustration buying influence 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:12.240
 youtube we do a lot but not all 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.460

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.890
 products that absolutely do not like 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.660
 let's start here with what products i am 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.619
 I think even they need a presentation 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.869
 this mango tassel and 17 she was a star 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.359
 youtube and probably two years ago and in 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.789
 in general, I bought it of course to me 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.859
 it seemed that she would save me straight 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.759
 Make-up in general, I will teach you everything 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.860
 feathering 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:38.309
 I know share my hands to be honest 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.640
 clumsy or there is no general sense in this 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.250
 brushes 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.040
 I have out. I think it's a fake 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.829
 by Bobby Brown, it's much better where 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.050
 softer better shade more pleasant and know 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.059
 I do not torture the pleasure to be honest 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.430
 I use this brush if you once again 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.140
 You are thinking of buying if you need thousands of office 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.329
 honestly say think some more 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.160
 since she is not flooded with any miracles she 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:03.059
 the most ordinary shading brush 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:06.390
 which analogues are much cheaper and 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.950
 easier for you to become I did not tip 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.110
 I don’t like to 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.350
 the next such product is also very 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:17.250
 popular at all times yu tuba this year 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:19.799
 arc powder museum know this very 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.869
 subjective and of course I have an opinion 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:25.320
 hair is long and that is on my hair 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:27.390
 he does nothing nothing there do my 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.549
 dirty hair i have a valid memory 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.030

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:35.009
 30min so much you and the position washed 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:37.520
 but it is not possible to regulate the scoreboard 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:40.619
 I know who the girls have thin hair 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.850
 short hair and power like passed in 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.520
 general he gives volume 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.680
 on long hair it does not work on 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.130
 long or thick sense of his numbers 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.979
 will not 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.770
 no stock now probably fly me 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:55.680
 stakes i accept it feel that 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.470
 that this will happen in general, this is such 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.280
 Seriously 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:02.380
 this palette could from urban dickey let's 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.750
 Let's start with the fact that this is a palette I saw 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:07.330
 have rubber by my very first it was 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.890
 Faith year and a half ago this Malinku I 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:13.480

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:24.880
 such a mirror palette looks like a rare 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:27.370
 I use it but let's do it without some 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:30.490
 wild pleasure listening to urban 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:33.760
 dickey is just a shadow from god like 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:36.100
 at least I already bought this palette from me 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.660
 no nakid 1 and kikvan is nothing here 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:40.570
 I can not say I only have 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:41.050
 such a palette know to be honest I don’t 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:43.480
 I see 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:46.540
 something in it is excellent in this palette 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.250
 and beautiful very shades they are beautiful 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:51.840
 fingers are typed now I'll show you 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:53.830
 you see 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.330
 imitation seems generally simple 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:57.459
 breathtakingly let's still 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:59.070
 some do not see that the blue diesel 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:02.230
 let's 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:09.790
 such a gathering a pigmentation seems they 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:10.450
 very silky all great applied 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.930
 in chunks 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:16.060
 Secondly, it is very much fray then 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:19.660
 there she is when applied showered 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:21.550
 terrible and the sacrament know who I when 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:28.570
 I looked reviews about this palette heard 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:31.720
 about elena 864 where to fill in fact 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:33.390
 she is very showered and this palette 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.530
 these shadows can only be dialed 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:37.150
 artificial brush natural 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:39.100
 reserves are simply impossible not just 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:41.500
 rotate uga have some it seems to me 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:43.090
 what if you don't have any poles from 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.770
 urban dickey and not worth starting 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:46.650
 limbs 

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:48.720
 sequins it seems to me that the same nikitku 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:51.300
 home better now I 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:55.140
 just feel on that end of the monitors 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:57.870
 I still have more days swarmed my 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:04:00.830
 frustration in this clarins oil 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:06.360
 this is lotus oil one hundred percent 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:09.540
 pipette pipette in general adore 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:12.870
 This oil is just me for cloud os 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:16.070
 what can i say by the way this is oil 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:19.350
 us for oily and combination skin 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:21.060
 I heard so much about this oil that he 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:23.940
 just work wonders learn inflicted 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:25.830
 am woke up velvet skin on my 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:28.140
 skin mess up nothing to say so she 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:31.770
 Moistened or somehow you know super 

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:35.520
 I even felt that 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:38.250
 You know subcutaneous acne and what is what 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:41.730
 then it provokes inflammation if 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:44.040
 honestly i'm using it like i 

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:46.620
 many used in view of the fact that 

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:48.540
 it is consumed very slowly i will 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:51.030
 I use this oil after all, well, not very 

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:54.600
 so asogi I would say but buy him 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:56.490
 I definitely won't, and I don't advise anyone 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:59.850
 I understand that all different skin but 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:01.950
 but I don't see magic with this oil and 

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:04.620
 let's move on to the next one 

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:07.620
 enchantment is such a balm from 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:10.220
 clarins are also very popular change 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:17.790
 on yu tuba in my fifth fifth shades 

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:22.170
 I will show you how I look like this 

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:24.510
 I will say that is not so here is the answer by the way 

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:26.430
 they are just stunned I really like but 

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:27.150
 cube agach not so bright looks more 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:30.040
 right 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:32.650
 The balm is not so that it is not worth its 

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:37.290
 money that's it with this big him it 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:40.060
 centuries this balm know here by his 

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:41.850
 applying means resistance to lips and 

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:47.730
 lip types 

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:50.080
 honestly he is not worth you driving 750 

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:52.330
 brothers will be issued 

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:55.300
 well balm is not worth the money from 

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:57.220
 good nothing bad in general 

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:59.770
 smell good it is not rare all great 

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:01.990
 but its red price is 100 rubles 

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:04.270
