00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:18.300 
in this video you're going to discover
the<00:00:16.270> three<00:00:16.600> main<00:00:16.870> levels<00:00:17.350> of<00:00:17.560> strength<00:00:17.980> and

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:18.310 
the three main levels of strength and

the three main levels of strength and
rigidity<00:00:18.750> once<00:00:19.750> you<00:00:19.930> see<00:00:20.200> these<00:00:20.380> levels

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:20.830 
rigidity once you see these levels

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:22.980 
rigidity once you see these levels
illustrated<00:00:21.550> you'll<00:00:21.850> know<00:00:22.030> exactly<00:00:22.240> how<00:00:22.960> to

illustrated you'll know exactly how to

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:25.080 
illustrated you'll know exactly how to
select<00:00:23.470> the<00:00:23.650> most<00:00:23.830> appropriate<00:00:24.010> thickness<00:00:24.910> of

the<00:00:27.130> three<00:00:27.490> main<00:00:27.730> levels<00:00:28.119> of<00:00:28.270> strength<00:00:28.630> are

the three main levels of strength are

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.720 
the three main levels of strength are
low<00:00:29.199> medium<00:00:29.860> and<00:00:30.070> high

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:30.730 
low medium and high

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:32.790 
low medium and high
since<00:00:31.180> aluminum<00:00:31.660> is<00:00:31.779> such<00:00:31.930> a<00:00:31.960> thin<00:00:32.230> material

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:32.800
