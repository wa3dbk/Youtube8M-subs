five in the center and three in the rear
and<00:00:36.649> as<00:00:37.649> far<00:00:37.890> as<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.250> out<00:00:38.489> drives<00:00:38.850> I<00:00:39.180> have

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
and as far as the out drives I have

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.979 
and as far as the out drives I have
upgraded<00:00:40.230> to<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.649> light<00:00:40.980> and<00:00:41.329> HD<00:00:42.329> out<00:00:42.600> drives

upgraded to the light and HD out drives

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.420 
upgraded to the light and HD out drives
from<00:00:43.230> low<00:00:43.530> Z<00:00:43.710> on<00:00:43.980> all<00:00:44.280> three<00:00:44.640> discs<00:00:45.030> so

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:46.430 
from low Z on all three discs so

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:49.389 
from low Z on all three discs so
definitely<00:00:47.430> notice<00:00:47.730> a<00:00:47.879> difference<00:00:48.329> as<00:00:48.539> far<00:00:48.600> as

00:00:49.389 --> 00:00:49.399 
definitely notice a difference as far as

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:52.639 
definitely notice a difference as far as
turning<00:00:50.399> was<00:00:51.210> a<00:00:51.239> huge<00:00:51.780> improvement<00:00:52.110> I<00:00:52.440> was

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
turning was a huge improvement I was

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.520 
turning was a huge improvement I was
able<00:00:52.770> to<00:00:53.660> you<00:00:54.660> know<00:00:54.750> click<00:00:55.050> around<00:00:55.230> on<00:00:55.440> the

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
able to you know click around on the

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.639 
able to you know click around on the
turns<00:00:55.800> very<00:00:56.160> quickly<00:00:56.789> now<00:00:57.090> so<00:00:57.449> that<00:00:58.140> was<00:00:58.350> a<00:00:58.379> big

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
turns very quickly now so that was a big

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.250 
turns very quickly now so that was a big
improvement<00:00:58.800> that<00:00:59.190> I<00:00:59.250> noticed<00:01:00.260> outdrives

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
improvement that I noticed outdrives

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.389 
improvement that I noticed outdrives
didn't<00:01:01.620> really<00:01:01.800> notice<00:01:01.949> much<00:01:02.129> of<00:01:02.250> a

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
didn't really notice much of a

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:02.779 
didn't really notice much of a
difference

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
difference

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.119 
difference
besides<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.420> where<00:01:03.600> there's<00:01:04.379> hardly<00:01:04.830> any

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
besides the where there's hardly any

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.130 
besides the where there's hardly any
wear<00:01:05.339> on<00:01:05.610> my<00:01:06.450> out<00:01:07.020> drives<00:01:07.290> at<00:01:07.530> all<00:01:07.740> now<00:01:07.950> so<00:01:08.310> um

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140 
wear on my out drives at all now so um

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.780 
wear on my out drives at all now so um
let's<00:01:10.140> take<00:01:10.290> a<00:01:10.320> look<00:01:10.470> inside<00:01:10.920> and<00:01:11.189> we'll<00:01:11.640> go

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
let's take a look inside and we'll go

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:12.109 
let's take a look inside and we'll go
from<00:01:11.880> there

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
from there

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.289 
from there
so<00:01:12.619> as<00:01:13.619> far<00:01:13.860> as<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.070> body<00:01:14.280> I<00:01:14.580> did<00:01:15.090> make<00:01:15.270> a

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
so as far as the body I did make a

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.240 
so as far as the body I did make a
couple<00:01:15.570> of<00:01:15.689> modifications<00:01:15.810> from<00:01:16.650> my<00:01:16.890> last

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
couple of modifications from my last

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.109 
couple of modifications from my last
couple<00:01:17.520> of<00:01:17.549> videos<00:01:19.430> pretty<00:01:20.430> much<00:01:20.670> put<00:01:20.939> some

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
couple of videos pretty much put some

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.570 
couple of videos pretty much put some
vent<00:01:21.299> holes<00:01:21.540> all<00:01:21.810> through<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.580> the

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
vent holes all through the the

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.010 
vent holes all through the the
windshield<00:01:24.000> as<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.860> it<00:01:25.860> actually<00:01:26.070> comes<00:01:26.490> with

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
windshield as the it actually comes with

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.569 
windshield as the it actually comes with
lines<00:01:28.020> on<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.590> windshield<00:01:28.829> to<00:01:29.220> make<00:01:29.400> those

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
lines on the windshield to make those

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.719 
lines on the windshield to make those
perforation<00:01:30.090> so<00:01:30.509> also<00:01:31.439> drilled<00:01:32.130> out<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.310> two

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
perforation so also drilled out the two

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.870 
perforation so also drilled out the two
fans<00:01:33.030> in<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.360> rear<00:01:33.920> and<00:01:34.920> I<00:01:35.400> think<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:35.700> last

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
fans in the rear and I think the last

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.899 
fans in the rear and I think the last
thing<00:01:36.150> I<00:01:36.240> did<00:01:36.299> was<00:01:37.189> went<00:01:38.189> ahead<00:01:38.250> and<00:01:38.549> took<00:01:38.729> out

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
thing I did was went ahead and took out

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.080 
thing I did was went ahead and took out
the<00:01:39.890> taillights<00:01:40.890> just<00:01:41.549> to<00:01:41.670> give<00:01:41.790> it<00:01:41.820> a<00:01:41.939> little

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
the taillights just to give it a little

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.010 
the taillights just to give it a little
bit<00:01:42.210> more<00:01:42.390> body<00:01:42.659> flow<00:01:42.990> or<00:01:43.430> less<00:01:44.430> body

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
bit more body flow or less body

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.280 
bit more body flow or less body
parachuting<00:01:46.729> did<00:01:47.729> kind<00:01:48.090> of<00:01:48.149> screw<00:01:48.869> that<00:01:49.020> up<00:01:49.079> a

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
parachuting did kind of screw that up a

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.130 
parachuting did kind of screw that up a
little<00:01:49.470> bit<00:01:49.649> there<00:01:50.180> you<00:01:51.180> see<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:51.689> rear<00:01:51.899> took

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
little bit there you see the rear took

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.569 
little bit there you see the rear took
kind<00:01:52.649> of<00:01:52.710> a<00:01:52.799> beating<00:01:53.159> from<00:01:53.759> here<00:01:54.030> and<00:01:54.149> there<00:01:54.299> so

00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:55.579 
kind of a beating from here and there so

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:59.660 
kind of a beating from here and there so
in<00:01:56.579> my<00:01:56.850> new<00:01:57.439> adventure<00:01:58.439> with<00:01:58.799> this<00:01:58.950> SCT<00:01:59.369> will

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
in my new adventure with this SCT will

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.719 
in my new adventure with this SCT will
definitely<00:02:00.090> be<00:02:00.180> a<00:02:00.210> new<00:02:00.450> body

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729 
definitely be a new body

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:06.830 
definitely be a new body
hopefully<00:02:02.729> a<00:02:03.649> flow-through<00:02:04.649> body<00:02:05.070> like<00:02:05.490> the<00:02:05.840> J

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
hopefully a flow-through body like the J

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.219 
hopefully a flow-through body like the J
concepts<00:02:07.350> or<00:02:07.649> proline<00:02:08.190> has<00:02:08.429> out<00:02:08.700> so<00:02:09.229> let's

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
concepts or proline has out so let's

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
those I did lower my ride height just a

those I did lower my ride height just a
little<00:02:55.680> bit<00:02:55.799> on<00:02:56.099> my<00:02:56.579> last<00:02:56.790> few<00:02:57.000> laps<00:02:57.180> I<00:02:57.480> wanted

little bit on my last few laps I wanted

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.680 
little bit on my last few laps I wanted
to<00:02:58.280> see<00:02:59.280> if<00:02:59.370> that<00:02:59.519> helped<00:02:59.819> and<00:02:59.910> it<00:03:00.060> definitely

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
to see if that helped and it definitely

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:05.650 
to see if that helped and it definitely
did<00:03:00.840> so<00:03:01.110> lower<00:03:01.440> that<00:03:01.680> just<00:03:01.950> slightly<00:03:03.200> and

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
did so lower that just slightly and

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:09.190 
did so lower that just slightly and
here's<00:03:06.660> the<00:03:06.900> biggest<00:03:07.230> thing<00:03:07.560> that<00:03:07.590> I<00:03:07.890> noticed

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
here's the biggest thing that I noticed

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.059 
here's the biggest thing that I noticed
let<00:03:10.200> me<00:03:10.260> show<00:03:10.440> you<00:03:10.500> some<00:03:10.650> of<00:03:10.739> the<00:03:10.799> batteries

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:11.069 
let me show you some of the batteries

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:13.850 
let me show you some of the batteries
that<00:03:11.220> have<00:03:11.280> been<00:03:11.459> running<00:03:11.640> and<00:03:12.650> we<00:03:13.650> can<00:03:13.769> go

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
that have been running and we can go

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.280 
that have been running and we can go
from<00:03:13.980> there<00:03:14.160> so<00:03:14.220> my<00:03:14.970> primary<00:03:15.329> battery<00:03:15.840> that<00:03:16.079> I

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
from there so my primary battery that I

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:17.809 
from there so my primary battery that I
really<00:03:16.620> like<00:03:16.799> running<00:03:17.069> a<00:03:17.129> missing<00:03:17.459> is<00:03:17.639> this

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:17.819

are all pretty heavy batteries you know
pretty<00:03:57.359> much<00:03:57.540> standard<00:03:57.989> I<00:03:58.139> think<00:03:58.169> the<00:03:58.470> one

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
pretty much standard I think the one

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.289 
pretty much standard I think the one
that<00:03:58.799> is<00:03:58.980> wore<00:03:59.220> approved<00:03:59.609> is<00:03:59.790> this<00:03:59.970> guy<00:04:00.150> right

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:00.299 
that is wore approved is this guy right

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:00.589 
that is wore approved is this guy right
there

00:04:00.589 --> 00:04:00.599 
there

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:04.849 
there
the<00:04:00.810> Jen's<00:04:01.079> ace<00:04:02.299> my<00:04:03.299> last<00:04:03.569> I<00:04:03.900> probably<00:04:04.650> had

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:04.859 
the Jen's ace my last I probably had

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:07.280 
the Jen's ace my last I probably had
about<00:04:04.950> 30<00:04:05.400> minutes<00:04:05.700> left<00:04:05.849> in<00:04:06.000> the<00:04:06.060> track<00:04:06.329> and<00:04:06.630> I

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
about 30 minutes left in the track and I

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:11.110 
about 30 minutes left in the track and I
was<00:04:07.410> still<00:04:07.650> charging<00:04:08.220> my<00:04:08.489> Jen's<00:04:09.060> a<00:04:09.209> sub<00:04:09.480> and<00:04:09.720> I

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120 
was still charging my Jen's a sub and I

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.250 
was still charging my Jen's a sub and I
wanted<00:04:12.120> to<00:04:12.180> get<00:04:12.269> back<00:04:12.389> out<00:04:12.599> there<00:04:12.630> before<00:04:12.930> the

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
wanted to get back out there before the

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.000 
wanted to get back out there before the
trek<00:04:14.250> closed<00:04:14.489> down<00:04:14.700> so<00:04:15.329> I<00:04:15.359> threw<00:04:15.750> in<00:04:16.010> this

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010 
trek closed down so I threw in this

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:20.870 
trek closed down so I threw in this
turnigy<00:04:17.900> four<00:04:18.900> thousand<00:04:19.440> milliamp<00:04:19.680> and<00:04:20.099> you

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
turnigy four thousand milliamp and you

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.000 
turnigy four thousand milliamp and you
can<00:04:21.060> definitely<00:04:21.209> see<00:04:21.719> some<00:04:22.409> difference<00:04:22.800> as

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.010 
can definitely see some difference as

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:25.909 
can definitely see some difference as
far<00:04:23.039> as<00:04:23.250> the<00:04:23.490> size<00:04:23.750> obviously<00:04:24.750> 4000<00:04:25.680> knowing

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:25.919 
far as the size obviously 4000 knowing

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:26.650 
far as the size obviously 4000 knowing
that<00:04:26.010> means<00:04:26.250> that

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:26.660 
that means that

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:31.660 
that means that
it's<00:04:27.190> a<00:04:28.360> smaller<00:04:29.360> battery<00:04:29.570> so<00:04:30.470> there's<00:04:31.310> a<00:04:31.400> size

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:31.670 
it's a smaller battery so there's a size

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:34.120 
it's a smaller battery so there's a size
difference<00:04:31.880> and<00:04:32.390> the<00:04:33.020> weight<00:04:33.200> differences<00:04:33.800> is

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:34.130 
difference and the weight differences is

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:35.400 
difference and the weight differences is
huge

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:35.410 
huge

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:40.240 
huge
this<00:04:36.410> is<00:04:36.590> only<00:04:36.800> a<00:04:36.950> 30<00:04:37.400> to<00:04:37.700> 40<00:04:38.150> C<00:04:38.420> discharge<00:04:39.250> but

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:40.250 
this is only a 30 to 40 C discharge but

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:42.700 
this is only a 30 to 40 C discharge but
it's<00:04:40.700> definitely<00:04:41.090> a<00:04:41.150> lighter<00:04:41.570> battery<00:04:41.990> when<00:04:42.680> I

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:42.710 
it's definitely a lighter battery when I

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:44.200 
it's definitely a lighter battery when I
put<00:04:43.010> this<00:04:43.160> battery<00:04:43.550> in<00:04:43.700> there<00:04:43.850> and<00:04:44.030> did<00:04:44.120> my

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:44.210 
put this battery in there and did my

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:50.460 
put this battery in there and did my
last<00:04:44.420> few<00:04:45.140> laps<00:04:45.940> this<00:04:46.940> truck<00:04:48.160> felt<00:04:49.160> so<00:04:49.610> light

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:50.470 
last few laps this truck felt so light

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:53.710 
last few laps this truck felt so light
so<00:04:51.470> I<00:04:51.500> am<00:04:51.920> now<00:04:52.100> on<00:04:52.280> a<00:04:52.310> mission<00:04:52.730> to<00:04:53.030> make<00:04:53.240> this<00:04:53.480> a

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:53.720 
so I am now on a mission to make this a

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:57.670 
so I am now on a mission to make this a
light<00:04:54.200> a<00:04:54.530> CTE<00:04:55.370> so<00:04:56.090> I<00:04:56.420> know<00:04:56.840> this<00:04:57.050> is<00:04:57.230> one<00:04:57.410> of<00:04:57.530> the

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:57.680 
light a CTE so I know this is one of the

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.980 
light a CTE so I know this is one of the
the<00:04:58.280> fattest<00:04:58.760> girls<00:04:59.120> there<00:04:59.390> on<00:04:59.540> the<00:04:59.690> track<00:04:59.960> so

00:04:59.980 --> 00:04:59.990 
the fattest girls there on the track so

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:01.900 
the fattest girls there on the track so
I<00:05:00.620> think<00:05:01.070> we<00:05:01.340> need<00:05:01.490> to<00:05:01.580> put<00:05:01.730> this<00:05:01.850> thing

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:01.910 
I think we need to put this thing

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:05.020 
I think we need to put this thing
through<00:05:02.090> a<00:05:02.330> diet<00:05:03.310> I'm<00:05:04.310> looking<00:05:04.730> for<00:05:04.910> you<00:05:05.000> guys

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:05.030 
through a diet I'm looking for you guys

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:07.270 
through a diet I'm looking for you guys
to<00:05:05.810> give<00:05:06.350> me<00:05:06.440> some<00:05:06.590> ideas

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:07.280 
to give me some ideas

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:09.160 
to give me some ideas
show<00:05:07.970> me<00:05:08.120> maybe<00:05:08.330> what<00:05:08.570> you've<00:05:08.750> done<00:05:08.930> in<00:05:09.080> the

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:09.170 
show me maybe what you've done in the

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:11.380 
show me maybe what you've done in the
past<00:05:09.320> and<00:05:09.950> what's<00:05:10.640> worked<00:05:10.880> and<00:05:11.000> what's<00:05:11.210> not

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:11.390 
past and what's worked and what's not

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:14.350 
past and what's worked and what's not
and<00:05:12.190> we'll<00:05:13.190> go<00:05:13.310> from<00:05:13.430> there<00:05:13.520> I<00:05:13.880> think<00:05:14.060> I've

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:14.360 
and we'll go from there I think I've

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:15.850 
and we'll go from there I think I've
done<00:05:14.480> all<00:05:14.690> the<00:05:14.810> upgrades<00:05:15.020> on<00:05:15.500> this<00:05:15.650> thing<00:05:15.830> that

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:15.860 
done all the upgrades on this thing that

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:17.280 
done all the upgrades on this thing that
I<00:05:16.040> really<00:05:16.280> want<00:05:16.460> to<00:05:16.550> do<00:05:16.640> as<00:05:16.820> far<00:05:16.850> as

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:17.290 
I really want to do as far as

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:20.680 
I really want to do as far as
performance<00:05:18.290> I<00:05:18.640> think<00:05:19.640> now<00:05:20.090> we<00:05:20.150> just<00:05:20.450> need<00:05:20.540> to

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:20.690 
performance I think now we just need to

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:22.510 
performance I think now we just need to
get<00:05:20.780> the<00:05:20.900> weight<00:05:21.080> down<00:05:21.230> a<00:05:21.290> little<00:05:21.470> bit<00:05:21.650> and<00:05:21.860> you

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:22.520 
get the weight down a little bit and you

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:24.490 
get the weight down a little bit and you
know<00:05:22.640> and<00:05:23.030> keep<00:05:23.210> in<00:05:23.420> hindsight<00:05:23.720> we<00:05:24.200> want<00:05:24.410> to

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:24.500 
know and keep in hindsight we want to

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:27.130 
know and keep in hindsight we want to
keep<00:05:24.620> the<00:05:24.800> balance<00:05:25.250> as<00:05:25.520> well<00:05:25.810> this<00:05:26.810> thing<00:05:26.990> is

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:27.140 
keep the balance as well this thing is

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:29.020 
keep the balance as well this thing is
is<00:05:27.440> pretty<00:05:27.770> well<00:05:28.010> balanced<00:05:28.430> and<00:05:28.610> I'm<00:05:28.850> pretty

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:29.030 
is pretty well balanced and I'm pretty

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:30.400 
is pretty well balanced and I'm pretty
happy<00:05:29.120> with<00:05:29.540> the<00:05:29.630> way<00:05:29.720> flies<00:05:30.050> through<00:05:30.290> the<00:05:30.320> air

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:30.410 
happy with the way flies through the air

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:33.340 
happy with the way flies through the air
so<00:05:31.220> we<00:05:31.940> need<00:05:32.120> to<00:05:32.360> start<00:05:32.780> lightening<00:05:33.020> this

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:33.350 
so we need to start lightening this

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:36.430 
so we need to start lightening this
thing<00:05:33.560> up<00:05:33.710> so<00:05:34.360> any<00:05:35.360> ideas<00:05:35.780> you<00:05:35.930> have<00:05:36.110> please

things<00:05:39.980> that<00:05:40.160> I<00:05:40.190> have<00:05:40.280> in<00:05:40.610> my<00:05:40.760> mind<00:05:40.790> so<00:05:41.240> far<00:05:41.480> is

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:41.780 
things that I have in my mind so far is

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:46.390 
things that I have in my mind so far is
I<00:05:42.380> definitely<00:05:43.190> want<00:05:43.400> to<00:05:44.380> either<00:05:45.400> manufacture

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:46.400 
I definitely want to either manufacture

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:49.450 
I definitely want to either manufacture
or<00:05:46.640> pick<00:05:47.570> up<00:05:47.780> any<00:05:48.020> battery<00:05:48.440> tray<00:05:48.770> and<00:05:49.010> esc

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:49.460 
or pick up any battery tray and esc

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:51.580 
or pick up any battery tray and esc
holder<00:05:49.790> I<00:05:50.000> know<00:05:50.419> that<00:05:50.720> Krista<00:05:51.230> Hatter<00:05:51.380> Berry

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:51.590 
holder I know that Krista Hatter Berry

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:53.670 
holder I know that Krista Hatter Berry
has<00:05:51.770> one<00:05:52.010> out<00:05:52.130> there<00:05:52.340> that<00:05:52.550> looks<00:05:52.910> very<00:05:53.180> nice

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:53.680 
has one out there that looks very nice

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:58.090 
has one out there that looks very nice
I'm<00:05:54.680> a<00:05:54.890> mock<00:05:55.250> up<00:05:55.490> my<00:05:55.669> own<00:05:56.410> so<00:05:57.410> we'll<00:05:57.860> kind<00:05:58.040> of

00:05:58.090 --> 00:05:58.100 
I'm a mock up my own so we'll kind of

00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:59.470 
I'm a mock up my own so we'll kind of
see<00:05:58.250> how<00:05:58.370> that<00:05:58.550> goes

00:05:59.470 --> 00:05:59.480 
see how that goes

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:02.590 
see how that goes
second<00:06:00.200> thing<00:06:00.760> titanium<00:06:01.760> screws<00:06:02.060> not<00:06:02.300> sure<00:06:02.510> if

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:02.600 
second thing titanium screws not sure if

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:04.050 
second thing titanium screws not sure if
I<00:06:02.720> want<00:06:02.870> to<00:06:02.930> do<00:06:03.020> that

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:04.060 
I want to do that

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:09.700 
I want to do that
titanium<00:06:07.810> turnbuckles<00:06:08.810> may<00:06:09.440> end<00:06:09.590> up<00:06:09.650> doing

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:09.710 
titanium turnbuckles may end up doing

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:11.350 
titanium turnbuckles may end up doing
that<00:06:10.100> because<00:06:10.430> I<00:06:10.580> know<00:06:10.730> that<00:06:10.760> that<00:06:11.060> saves

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:11.360 
that because I know that that saves

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:14.140 
that because I know that that saves
quite<00:06:11.600> a<00:06:11.630> bit<00:06:11.780> of<00:06:11.870> weight<00:06:12.820> other<00:06:13.820> than<00:06:14.030> that<00:06:14.120> I

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:14.150 
quite a bit of weight other than that I

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:15.760 
quite a bit of weight other than that I
think<00:06:14.330> I<00:06:14.690> don't<00:06:14.870> want<00:06:15.050> to<00:06:15.260> add<00:06:15.380> any<00:06:15.650> more

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:15.770 
think I don't want to add any more

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:18.040 
think I don't want to add any more
