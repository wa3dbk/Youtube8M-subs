securing<00:03:02.600> it<00:03:04.239> and<00:03:05.239> what<00:03:05.390> we're<00:03:05.570> literally

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
securing it and what we're literally

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:09.370 
securing it and what we're literally
doing<00:03:06.200> is<00:03:06.830> almost<00:03:07.540> pinning<00:03:08.540> it<00:03:08.660> at<00:03:08.840> an<00:03:09.050> angle

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:09.380

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.620 
doing is almost pinning it at an angle
and<00:03:09.560> then<00:03:09.709> going<00:03:10.070> against<00:03:10.340> ourselves<00:03:10.580> just<00:03:11.480> so

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
and then going against ourselves just so

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:15.400 
and then going against ourselves just so
it<00:03:11.750> adds<00:03:11.980> security<00:03:13.000> for<00:03:14.000> extra<00:03:14.300> support<00:03:14.510> we're

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410

going to go over the top area as well
just<00:03:17.930> pinning<00:03:18.260> through<00:03:18.650> make<00:03:19.370> sure<00:03:19.580> that

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
just pinning through make sure that

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:25.160 
just pinning through make sure that
they're<00:03:20.209> hidden<00:03:20.450> so<00:03:20.870> you<00:03:20.900> don't<00:03:21.290> see<00:03:21.470> them
