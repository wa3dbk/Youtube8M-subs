really cool things on this amplifier

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:33.069 
really cool things on this amplifier
that<00:00:32.029> we're<00:00:32.149> going<00:00:32.270> to<00:00:32.359> talk<00:00:32.539> about<00:00:32.570> that<00:00:33.020> a

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:34.370 
lot of people don't really know about

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:36.729 
lot of people don't really know about
and<00:00:34.930> we've<00:00:35.930> been<00:00:36.079> shown<00:00:36.290> it<00:00:36.410> at<00:00:36.470> the<00:00:36.560> NAMM<00:00:36.710> show

00:00:36.729 --> 00:00:36.739 
and we've been shown it at the NAMM show

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:38.860 
and we've been shown it at the NAMM show
we'd<00:00:37.190> be<00:00:37.280> getting<00:00:37.370> a<00:00:37.489> lot<00:00:37.640> of<00:00:37.760> cool<00:00:37.970> comments

we'd be getting a lot of cool comments
and<00:00:39.020> vibes<00:00:39.200> about<00:00:39.500> it<00:00:39.620> so<00:00:39.770> first<00:00:40.579> off<00:00:42.190> 20<00:00:43.190> watts

00:00:43.389 --> 00:00:43.399 
and vibes about it so first off 20 watts

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:46.900 
and vibes about it so first off 20 watts
yeah<00:00:44.350> yeah<00:00:45.350> it's<00:00:45.590> a<00:00:45.770> very<00:00:46.100> little<00:00:46.340> wattage<00:00:46.460> for

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:46.910 
yeah yeah it's a very little wattage for

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:48.580 
yeah yeah it's a very little wattage for
a<00:00:47.090> guitar<00:00:47.390> amp<00:00:47.600> you<00:00:47.870> might<00:00:48.050> think<00:00:48.260> at<00:00:48.410> first

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:48.590 
a guitar amp you might think at first

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.069 
a guitar amp you might think at first
glance<00:00:48.860> but<00:00:49.190> it<00:00:50.090> is<00:00:50.239> the<00:00:50.420> type<00:00:50.780> of<00:00:50.899> amplifier

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:51.079 
glance but it is the type of amplifier

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:54.369 
glance but it is the type of amplifier
that<00:00:52.010> you<00:00:52.219> would<00:00:52.399> see<00:00:52.850> in<00:00:53.120> a<00:00:53.270> boutique<00:00:53.840> guitar

00:00:54.369 --> 00:00:54.379 
that you would see in a boutique guitar

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:57.639 
that you would see in a boutique guitar
shop<00:00:54.649> it's<00:00:55.219> not<00:00:55.460> meant<00:00:55.879> as<00:00:56.120> a<00:00:56.180> high<00:00:56.930> gain<00:00:57.290> type

00:00:57.639 --> 00:00:57.649 
shop it's not meant as a high gain type

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:00.130 
shop it's not meant as a high gain type
of<00:00:57.800> amplifier<00:00:57.980> so<00:00:58.940> it's<00:00:59.420> more<00:00:59.840> of<00:00:59.989> an

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.140 
of amplifier so it's more of an

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.830 
of amplifier so it's more of an
old-fashioned<00:01:00.829> 1950s<00:01:01.610> style<00:01:01.700> ham<00:01:02.059> really<00:01:02.420> ok

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:02.840 
old-fashioned 1950s style ham really ok

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.319 
old-fashioned 1950s style ham really ok
so<00:01:03.440> yeah<00:01:03.950> obviously<00:01:04.280> with<00:01:04.670> the<00:01:04.759> blue<00:01:04.909> diamond

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:05.329 
so yeah obviously with the blue diamond

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:08.460 
so yeah obviously with the blue diamond
tolex<00:01:05.750> and<00:01:06.049> you<00:01:06.350> know<00:01:06.470> the<00:01:06.590> silver<00:01:06.890> gray<00:01:07.070> it

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:08.470 
tolex and you know the silver gray it

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:11.140 
tolex and you know the silver gray it
wouldn't<00:01:09.470> necessarily<00:01:09.500> be<00:01:10.159> meant<00:01:10.520> for<00:01:10.610> a<00:01:10.820> kid

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:11.150 
wouldn't necessarily be meant for a kid

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.560 
wouldn't necessarily be meant for a kid
looking<00:01:11.420> for<00:01:11.600> heavy<00:01:11.750> metal<00:01:12.110> or<00:01:12.290> a<00:01:13.250> guy<00:01:13.790> guys

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570 
looking for heavy metal or a guy guys

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.390 
looking for heavy metal or a guy guys
our<00:01:14.840> age<00:01:15.020> playing<00:01:15.380> blues<00:01:15.650> and<00:01:15.950> classic<00:01:16.310> rock

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:16.400 
our age playing blues and classic rock

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.370 
our age playing blues and classic rock
gigs<00:01:16.820> I<00:01:17.090> think<00:01:17.420> it's<00:01:17.540> more<00:01:17.720> for<00:01:17.960> that<00:01:18.110> type<00:01:18.350> of

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380 
gigs I think it's more for that type of

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.230 
gigs I think it's more for that type of
player<00:01:18.740> or<00:01:19.070> somebody<00:01:19.430> maybe<00:01:19.670> even<00:01:19.939> like<00:01:20.090> all

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240 
player or somebody maybe even like all

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:21.760 
player or somebody maybe even like all
on<00:01:20.330> lines<00:01:20.510> of<00:01:20.659> a<00:01:20.720> jazz<00:01:20.960> player<00:01:21.200> who'd<00:01:21.530> want<00:01:21.740> a

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 
on lines of a jazz player who'd want a

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.340 
on lines of a jazz player who'd want a
really<00:01:22.159> really<00:01:22.189> clean<00:01:22.640> tone<00:01:22.909> with<00:01:23.869> breakup

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
really really clean tone with breakup

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.800 
really really clean tone with breakup
happening<00:01:24.860> very<00:01:25.010> late<00:01:25.610> in<00:01:25.850> the<00:01:26.330> volume<00:01:26.630> stage

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 
happening very late in the volume stage

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:28.480 
happening very late in the volume stage
or<00:01:26.930> gain<00:01:27.080> stage<00:01:27.380> okay<00:01:27.860> so<00:01:27.920> you<00:01:28.159> have<00:01:28.250> to<00:01:28.340> really

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
or gain stage okay so you have to really

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.429 
or gain stage okay so you have to really
crank<00:01:28.790> this<00:01:28.939> an<00:01:29.119> to<00:01:29.270> get<00:01:29.390> to<00:01:29.570> break<00:01:29.780> up<00:01:29.990> and<00:01:30.259> but

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:30.439 
crank this an to get to break up and but

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:32.230 
crank this an to get to break up and but
what<00:01:30.560> it<00:01:30.650> does<00:01:30.799> it<00:01:31.009> breaks<00:01:31.189> up<00:01:31.310> nicely<00:01:31.549> for

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
what it does it breaks up nicely for

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:33.850 
what it does it breaks up nicely for
blues<00:01:32.479> or<00:01:32.750> rock<00:01:32.780> and<00:01:33.110> roll<00:01:33.229> cool

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 
blues or rock and roll cool

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.640 
blues or rock and roll cool
how<00:01:34.280> come<00:01:34.490> bomb<00:01:34.700> you<00:01:35.630> know<00:01:35.750> with<00:01:36.350> today's

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:36.650 
how come bomb you know with today's

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:38.080 
how come bomb you know with today's
technology<00:01:37.310> and<00:01:37.340> everything<00:01:37.490> you<00:01:37.820> see<00:01:38.000> the

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 
technology and everything you see the

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.120 
technology and everything you see the
billions<00:01:38.420> of<00:01:38.540> controls<00:01:38.900> on<00:01:39.080> amplifiers<00:01:39.619> it's

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
billions of controls on amplifiers it's

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:41.950 
billions of controls on amplifiers it's
got<00:01:40.250> a<00:01:40.280> volume<00:01:40.580> and<00:01:40.790> a<00:01:40.850> tone<00:01:41.060> control<00:01:41.479> yeah

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:41.960 
got a volume and a tone control yeah

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.570 
got a volume and a tone control yeah
it's<00:01:42.140> really<00:01:42.350> really<00:01:42.740> simple<00:01:42.920> and<00:01:43.340> I<00:01:43.369> think

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:43.580 
it's really really simple and I think

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:45.580 
it's really really simple and I think
that<00:01:43.759> sort<00:01:43.970> of<00:01:44.060> holds<00:01:44.360> true<00:01:44.630> to<00:01:44.930> keeping<00:01:45.500> the

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
that sort of holds true to keeping the

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.300 
that sort of holds true to keeping the
vibe<00:01:45.799> that<00:01:46.240> 1950<00:01:47.240> style<00:01:47.600> amp<00:01:47.900> and<00:01:48.170> you<00:01:48.890> will

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
vibe that 1950 style amp and you will

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.219 
vibe that 1950 style amp and you will
see<00:01:49.460> you<00:01:49.640> just<00:01:49.790> have<00:01:49.880> the<00:01:50.000> volume<00:01:50.329> control<00:01:50.360> the

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:51.229 
see you just have the volume control the

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:53.859 
see you just have the volume control the
tone<00:01:51.439> control<00:01:51.920> pretty<00:01:52.640> simple<00:01:53.060> and<00:01:53.450> over<00:01:53.689> here

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:53.869 
tone control pretty simple and over here

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:55.840 
tone control pretty simple and over here
the<00:01:54.020> only<00:01:54.049> knobs<00:01:54.350> you<00:01:54.500> have<00:01:54.680> are<00:01:54.950> the<00:01:55.610> tremolo

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 
the only knobs you have are the tremolo

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.039 
the only knobs you have are the tremolo
function<00:01:56.360> which<00:01:56.689> is<00:01:56.810> the<00:01:56.930> speed<00:01:57.229> and<00:01:57.500> intense

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
function which is the speed and intense

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.080 
function which is the speed and intense
and<00:01:58.350> everything<00:01:58.950> is<00:01:59.070> analog<00:01:59.430> circuitry<00:01:59.820> here

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
and everything is analog circuitry here

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.779 
and everything is analog circuitry here
Wow<00:02:00.829> yeah<00:02:01.829> being<00:02:02.100> a<00:02:02.219> bass<00:02:02.369> player<00:02:02.579> I<00:02:02.759> mean

00:02:02.779 --> 00:02:02.789 
Wow yeah being a bass player I mean

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:04.760 
Wow yeah being a bass player I mean
that's<00:02:03.149> to<00:02:03.450> see<00:02:03.630> to<00:02:03.929> see<00:02:04.079> a<00:02:04.109> volume<00:02:04.469> and<00:02:04.590> tone

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
that's to see to see a volume and tone

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.029 
that's to see to see a volume and tone
is<00:02:04.950> a<00:02:05.840> little<00:02:06.840> bit<00:02:06.960> different<00:02:07.320> here<00:02:07.469> but<00:02:07.590> yeah

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
is a little bit different here but yeah

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.380 
is a little bit different here but yeah
that's<00:02:08.310> what<00:02:08.459> the<00:02:08.550> older<00:02:08.759> amp<00:02:08.940> eggs<00:02:09.149> were<00:02:09.269> all

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
that's what the older amp eggs were all

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.089 
that's what the older amp eggs were all
about<00:02:09.629> man<00:02:09.869> it<00:02:09.989> was<00:02:10.080> it<00:02:10.319> was<00:02:10.410> just<00:02:10.530> about<00:02:10.739> sound

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
about man it was it was just about sound

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.130 
about man it was it was just about sound
and<00:02:11.340> a<00:02:11.370> couple<00:02:11.550> of<00:02:11.730> knobs<00:02:11.879> and<00:02:12.150> a<00:02:12.209> look<00:02:12.450> another

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
and a couple of knobs and a look another

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.660 
and a couple of knobs and a look another
cool<00:02:13.440> thing<00:02:13.470> about<00:02:13.680> this<00:02:14.040> amp<00:02:14.250> that<00:02:14.430> I'd<00:02:14.519> like

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
cool thing about this amp that I'd like

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.210 
cool thing about this amp that I'd like
to<00:02:14.700> talk<00:02:14.970> about<00:02:15.150> is<00:02:15.629> point-to-point<00:02:16.560> wiring

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
to talk about is point-to-point wiring

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.070 
to talk about is point-to-point wiring
yes<00:02:17.640> it's<00:02:17.910> true<00:02:18.120> this<00:02:18.299> amp<00:02:18.599> is<00:02:18.810> all

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
yes it's true this amp is all

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.830 
yes it's true this amp is all
point-to-point<00:02:19.500> wired<00:02:20.370> on<00:02:20.849> a<00:02:20.910> ball<00:02:21.180> board<00:02:21.450> so

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
point-to-point wired on a ball board so

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.770 
point-to-point wired on a ball board so
it's<00:02:22.049> very<00:02:22.430> old<00:02:23.430> technology<00:02:23.790> again<00:02:24.330> sort<00:02:24.720> of

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
it's very old technology again sort of

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.170 
it's very old technology again sort of
holding<00:02:24.959> true<00:02:25.140> to<00:02:25.170> the<00:02:25.560> 1950s<00:02:26.099> 1930s<00:02:27.090> even

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
holding true to the 1950s 1930s even

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.229 
holding true to the 1950s 1930s even
style<00:02:27.629> of<00:02:27.930> to<00:02:28.709> technology<00:02:29.310> and<00:02:29.730> old<00:02:29.910> radios

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
style of to technology and old radios

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:31.550 
style of to technology and old radios
and<00:02:30.360> that<00:02:30.480> sort<00:02:30.660> of<00:02:30.690> thing<00:02:30.870> same<00:02:31.290> sort<00:02:31.500> of

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
and that sort of thing same sort of

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.860 
and that sort of thing same sort of
technology<00:02:31.980> here<00:02:32.239> okay<00:02:33.239> so<00:02:33.269> starting<00:02:33.750> from

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
technology here okay so starting from

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.780 
technology here okay so starting from
left<00:02:34.079> to<00:02:34.200> right<00:02:34.380> with<00:02:34.530> the<00:02:34.560> feature<00:02:34.769> set<00:02:35.099> you

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
left to right with the feature set you

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.600 
left to right with the feature set you
can<00:02:35.910> see<00:02:36.120> that<00:02:36.299> you<00:02:36.360> have<00:02:36.510> two<00:02:36.750> inputs<00:02:37.140> here

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
can see that you have two inputs here

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:39.800 
can see that you have two inputs here
but<00:02:38.610> one<00:02:38.700> on<00:02:38.790> the<00:02:38.849> left<00:02:39.030> is<00:02:39.150> the<00:02:39.299> normal<00:02:39.630> input

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
but one on the left is the normal input

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.009 
but one on the left is the normal input
on<00:02:40.709> the<00:02:40.950> right<00:02:41.190> is<00:02:41.459> the<00:02:41.610> bright<00:02:41.849> input<00:02:42.299> so<00:02:42.900> if

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
on the right is the bright input so if

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:44.600 
on the right is the bright input so if
you<00:02:43.110> find<00:02:43.349> that<00:02:43.440> you're<00:02:43.650> getting<00:02:43.769> maybe<00:02:44.430> a

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
you find that you're getting maybe a

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.910 
you find that you're getting maybe a
dull<00:02:44.849> sound<00:02:45.150> from<00:02:45.390> old<00:02:45.599> strings<00:02:46.019> or<00:02:46.620> you<00:02:46.769> just

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
dull sound from old strings or you just

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.100 
dull sound from old strings or you just
want<00:02:47.190> more<00:02:47.340> treble<00:02:47.730> response<00:02:47.910> you<00:02:48.630> can<00:02:48.780> go<00:02:48.900> for

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
want more treble response you can go for

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:50.479 
want more treble response you can go for
the<00:02:49.170> bright<00:02:49.349> input<00:02:49.739> here<00:02:49.950> or<00:02:50.190> just<00:02:50.340> a<00:02:50.370> nice

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
the bright input here or just a nice

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:52.699 
the bright input here or just a nice
feature<00:02:50.840> and<00:02:51.840> over<00:02:52.079> here<00:02:52.230> just<00:02:52.440> have<00:02:52.560> the

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
feature and over here just have the

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:55.610 
feature and over here just have the
simple<00:02:53.040> volume<00:02:53.459> and<00:02:53.640> tone<00:02:54.209> knobs<00:02:54.530> nothing<00:02:55.530> too

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
simple volume and tone knobs nothing too

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.039 
simple volume and tone knobs nothing too
much<00:02:55.739> to<00:02:55.799> explain<00:02:56.160> there<00:02:56.660> then<00:02:57.660> over<00:02:57.810> here<00:02:57.840> we

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
much to explain there then over here we

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:00.500 
much to explain there then over here we
have<00:02:58.079> the<00:02:58.319> analog<00:02:58.799> tremolo<00:02:59.430> circuitry<00:02:59.910> we

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
have the analog tremolo circuitry we

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.170 
have the analog tremolo circuitry we
have<00:03:00.690> the<00:03:00.930> speed<00:03:01.709> function<00:03:02.060> and<00:03:03.060> the

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
have the speed function and the

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:04.670 
have the speed function and the
intensity<00:03:03.540> function<00:03:04.019> that<00:03:04.170> we<00:03:04.260> find<00:03:04.530> on

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
intensity function that we find on

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.099 
intensity function that we find on
pretty<00:03:05.370> much<00:03:05.459> any<00:03:05.670> standard<00:03:06.090> tremolo<00:03:06.480> device

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:07.109 
pretty much any standard tremolo device

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:10.490 
pretty much any standard tremolo device
the<00:03:07.829> sounds<00:03:08.100> really<00:03:08.370> good

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.440 

now<00:03:11.010> let's<00:03:11.160> take<00:03:11.310> a<00:03:11.340> look<00:03:11.520> at<00:03:11.640> the<00:03:11.760> inside<00:03:12.330> of

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
now let's take a look at the inside of

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.650 
now let's take a look at the inside of

stuff<00:03:42.210> that<00:03:42.390> we<00:03:42.540> have<00:03:42.690> today<00:03:42.870> right<00:03:43.320> right

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
stuff that we have today right right

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.680 
stuff that we have today right right
I<00:03:43.920> mean<00:03:44.340> if<00:03:44.430> you<00:03:44.520> look<00:03:44.700> you<00:03:45.120> know<00:03:45.150> just<00:03:45.450> looking

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
I mean if you look you know just looking

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:47.600 
I mean if you look you know just looking
at<00:03:45.810> this<00:03:45.959> cutaway<00:03:46.290> here<00:03:46.709> looking<00:03:47.130> into<00:03:47.340> the

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:47.610 
at this cutaway here looking into the

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:49.160 
at this cutaway here looking into the
amp<00:03:47.850> if<00:03:48.030> you<00:03:48.120> were<00:03:48.180> to<00:03:48.270> look<00:03:48.570> into<00:03:48.870> it<00:03:48.990> I<00:03:49.050> mean

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.170 
amp if you were to look into it I mean

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:52.190 
amp if you were to look into it I mean
it's<00:03:49.350> it<00:03:50.100> looks<00:03:50.130> like<00:03:50.610> a<00:03:50.640> like<00:03:51.209> a<00:03:51.510> piece<00:03:51.840> of<00:03:51.990> art

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
it's it looks like a like a piece of art

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.410 
it's it looks like a like a piece of art
actually<00:03:52.440> literally<00:03:53.160> the<00:03:53.280> way<00:03:53.430> everything's

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
actually literally the way everything's

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.270 
actually literally the way everything's
soldered<00:03:54.870> and<00:03:54.959> laid<00:03:55.140> out<00:03:55.410> there<00:03:55.950> was<00:03:56.040> a<00:03:56.100> lot<00:03:56.250> of

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
soldered and laid out there was a lot of

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.370 
soldered and laid out there was a lot of
thought<00:03:56.490> put<00:03:56.760> into<00:03:56.820> that<00:03:57.120> and<00:03:57.990> you<00:03:58.110> can<00:03:58.230> see

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
thought put into that and you can see

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:59.960 
thought put into that and you can see
everything<00:03:58.890> just<00:03:58.920> at<00:03:59.160> a<00:03:59.190> first<00:03:59.400> glance<00:03:59.550> -

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
everything just at a first glance -

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:02.930 
everything just at a first glance -
which<00:04:00.209> is<00:04:00.800> really<00:04:01.800> not<00:04:01.980> intimidating<00:04:02.730> to<00:04:02.910> a

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
which is really not intimidating to a

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:04.490 
which is really not intimidating to a
lot<00:04:03.150> of<00:04:03.180> people<00:04:03.570> I<00:04:03.660> think<00:04:03.900> mmm

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
lot of people I think mmm

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.500 
lot of people I think mmm
now<00:04:05.250> of<00:04:05.370> course<00:04:05.430> we<00:04:05.760> wouldn't<00:04:05.940> do<00:04:06.120> that<00:04:06.330> with

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
now of course we wouldn't do that with

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.090 
now of course we wouldn't do that with
our<00:04:06.690> regular<00:04:07.200> production<00:04:07.470> amps

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:08.100 
our regular production amps

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:09.920 
our regular production amps
no<00:04:08.790> you<00:04:09.120> wouldn't<00:04:09.300> well<00:04:09.510> you<00:04:09.690> wouldn't<00:04:09.870> have

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
no you wouldn't well you wouldn't have

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:11.330 
no you wouldn't well you wouldn't have
this<00:04:10.080> no<00:04:10.260> one<00:04:10.380> want<00:04:10.560> to<00:04:10.650> stick<00:04:10.830> your<00:04:10.950> hand<00:04:11.190> in

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
this no one want to stick your hand in

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.110 
this no one want to stick your hand in
there<00:04:11.690> anyway<00:04:13.130> but<00:04:14.130> that's<00:04:14.670> pretty<00:04:14.820> cool<00:04:15.060> now

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
there anyway but that's pretty cool now

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.199 
there anyway but that's pretty cool now

that<00:04:23.910> gonna<00:04:24.060> be<00:04:24.150> loud<00:04:24.390> enough<00:04:24.540> well<00:04:25.380> it<00:04:25.800> does

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010 
that gonna be loud enough well it does

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:27.980 
that gonna be loud enough well it does
get<00:04:26.190> really<00:04:26.430> bad<00:04:26.760> that's<00:04:27.150> for<00:04:27.510> sure<00:04:27.690> and<00:04:27.960> you

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:27.990 
get really bad that's for sure and you

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:30.530 
get really bad that's for sure and you
do<00:04:28.169> get<00:04:28.350> a<00:04:28.560> lot<00:04:28.950> of<00:04:29.070> breakup<00:04:29.520> right<00:04:29.820> around<00:04:30.060> 7<00:04:30.419> 8

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:30.540 
do get a lot of breakup right around 7 8

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:32.390 
do get a lot of breakup right around 7 8
&amp;<00:04:30.720> 9<00:04:30.750> so<00:04:31.140> for<00:04:31.530> a<00:04:31.560> rock<00:04:31.800> player<00:04:32.040> the<00:04:32.220> Blues

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 
&amp; 9 so for a rock player the Blues

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:33.980 
&amp; 9 so for a rock player the Blues
player<00:04:32.669> I<00:04:32.940> might<00:04:33.270> be<00:04:33.330> the<00:04:33.419> kind<00:04:33.630> of<00:04:33.720> analog

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:33.990 
player I might be the kind of analog

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:35.810 
player I might be the kind of analog
breakup<00:04:34.470> that<00:04:34.890> he<00:04:35.040> or<00:04:35.100> she<00:04:35.130> might<00:04:35.370> want<00:04:35.550> to<00:04:35.640> get

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:35.820 
breakup that he or she might want to get

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:38.270 
breakup that he or she might want to get
but<00:04:36.419> traditionally<00:04:37.169> this<00:04:37.350> amp<00:04:37.530> is<00:04:37.740> a<00:04:38.040> clean

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280 
but traditionally this amp is a clean

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:39.620 
but traditionally this amp is a clean
amplifier<00:04:38.760> you're<00:04:39.000> not<00:04:39.120> gonna<00:04:39.240> want<00:04:39.450> to<00:04:39.510> use

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:39.630 
amplifier you're not gonna want to use

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:41.750 
amplifier you're not gonna want to use
it<00:04:39.750> for<00:04:39.780> hiking<00:04:40.200> rock<00:04:40.440> or<00:04:40.800> hiking<00:04:40.979> metal<00:04:41.430> right

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:41.760 
it for hiking rock or hiking metal right

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:43.850 
it for hiking rock or hiking metal right
but<00:04:42.030> types<00:04:42.210> of<00:04:42.330> music<00:04:42.600> that<00:04:42.750> you<00:04:43.020> think<00:04:43.740> of

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 
but types of music that you think of

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:45.230 
but types of music that you think of
when<00:04:44.010> you<00:04:44.100> think<00:04:44.130> of<00:04:44.430> the<00:04:44.490> tremolo<00:04:44.669> circuitry

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 
when you think of the tremolo circuitry

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.320 
when you think of the tremolo circuitry
would<00:04:45.390> probably<00:04:45.750> be<00:04:46.250> rockabilly<00:04:47.330> certain

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:48.330 
would probably be rockabilly certain

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:51.290 
would probably be rockabilly certain
types<00:04:48.510> of<00:04:48.660> jazz<00:04:49.220> surf<00:04:50.220> music<00:04:50.550> for<00:04:50.790> sure

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:51.300 
types of jazz surf music for sure

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:53.090 
types of jazz surf music for sure
so<00:04:51.930> the<00:04:51.990> tremolo<00:04:52.169> circuit<00:04:52.590> is<00:04:52.680> great<00:04:52.860> for

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:53.100 
so the tremolo circuit is great for

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:56.150 
so the tremolo circuit is great for
multiple<00:04:53.700> genres<00:04:54.710> let's<00:04:55.710> talk<00:04:55.860> about<00:04:55.979> the

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:56.160 
multiple genres let's talk about the

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:57.020 
multiple genres let's talk about the
back<00:04:56.340> panel<00:04:56.760> here

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:57.030 
back panel here

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:59.630 
back panel here
yeah<00:04:57.360> the<00:04:57.479> back<00:04:57.630> panel<00:04:57.990> is<00:04:58.169> arguably<00:04:58.950> simpler

00:04:59.630 --> 00:04:59.640 
yeah the back panel is arguably simpler

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:01.310 
yeah the back panel is arguably simpler
than<00:04:59.790> the<00:05:00.060> front<00:05:00.270> panel<00:05:00.540> you<00:05:00.780> just<00:05:00.960> have<00:05:01.110> a

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:01.320 
than the front panel you just have a

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:03.080 
than the front panel you just have a
speaker<00:05:01.800> out<00:05:01.830> on<00:05:02.190> the<00:05:02.280> back<00:05:02.460> for<00:05:02.729> an<00:05:02.850> external

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:03.090 
speaker out on the back for an external

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:05.150 
speaker out on the back for an external
speaker<00:05:03.570> you<00:05:03.780> know<00:05:03.810> okay<00:05:04.440> and<00:05:04.680> then<00:05:04.830> we<00:05:04.979> also

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:05.160 
speaker you know okay and then we also

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.880 
speaker you know okay and then we also
have<00:05:05.460> the<00:05:05.820> footswitch<00:05:06.419> input<00:05:06.690> which<00:05:07.440> controls

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:07.890 
have the footswitch input which controls

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:09.950 
have the footswitch input which controls
the<00:05:08.040> on/off<00:05:08.430> function<00:05:08.790> of<00:05:09.060> the<00:05:09.180> tremolo<00:05:09.390> okay

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:09.960 
the on/off function of the tremolo okay

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:11.960 
the on/off function of the tremolo okay
