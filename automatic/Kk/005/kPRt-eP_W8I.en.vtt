this dark glitched out a spot which I

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:38.159 
this dark glitched out a spot which I
should<00:05:36.220> probably<00:05:36.250> fix<00:05:36.730> for<00:05:37.180> them<00:05:37.330> at<00:05:38.080> least

00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:38.169

1.2 that's over here now I don't know

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:43.710 
1.2 that's over here now I don't know
who<00:05:41.620> see<00:05:41.950> will<00:05:42.130> work<00:05:42.370> when<00:05:42.640> 1.2<00:05:43.180> comes<00:05:43.450> out<00:05:43.690> i

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:43.720 
who see will work when 1.2 comes out i

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:46.500 
who see will work when 1.2 comes out i
will<00:05:43.960> try<00:05:44.410> it<00:05:44.470> and<00:05:44.860> then<00:05:45.070> i'll<00:05:45.220> put<00:05:46.150> something

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:46.510 
will try it and then i'll put something

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:48.960 
will try it and then i'll put something
on<00:05:46.570> the<00:05:46.630> video<00:05:47.100> like<00:05:48.100> around<00:05:48.340> the<00:05:48.430> left<00:05:48.669> corner

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:48.970 
on the video like around the left corner

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:51.090 
on the video like around the left corner
or<00:05:49.570> somewhere<00:05:49.960> and<00:05:50.110> you<00:05:50.590> guys<00:05:50.680> can<00:05:50.890> check<00:05:51.040> that

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:51.100 
or somewhere and you guys can check that

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:54.510 
or somewhere and you guys can check that
out<00:05:52.050> you<00:05:53.050> have<00:05:53.140> a<00:05:53.230> snow<00:05:53.440> biome<00:05:53.650> here<00:05:54.220> which

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:54.520 
out you have a snow biome here which

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:57.770 
out you have a snow biome here which
just<00:05:54.790> you<00:05:55.150> know<00:05:55.240> shows<00:05:55.540> you<00:05:55.660> some<00:05:55.840> trees<00:05:56.200> and

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:57.780 
just you know shows you some trees and

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:01.860 
just you know shows you some trees and
go<00:05:58.780> high<00:05:58.990> and<00:05:59.790> that's<00:06:00.790> pretty<00:06:01.360> much<00:06:01.510> it<00:06:01.600> to

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:01.870 
go high and that's pretty much it to

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:05.640 
go high and that's pretty much it to
seed<00:06:02.730> it's<00:06:03.730> get<00:06:03.970> some<00:06:04.210> more<00:06:04.450> cool<00:06:04.780> rock<00:06:05.080> like

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:05.650 
seed it's get some more cool rock like

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:09.450 
seed it's get some more cool rock like
bass<00:06:06.010> and<00:06:06.310> type<00:06:07.020> areas<00:06:08.020> over<00:06:08.320> there<00:06:08.500> and<00:06:08.860> it's

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:09.460 
bass and type areas over there and it's

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:12.530 
bass and type areas over there and it's
still<00:06:09.760> we're<00:06:09.940> all<00:06:10.000> pretty<00:06:10.270> nice<00:06:10.510> looking<00:06:10.690> seed

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:12.540 
still we're all pretty nice looking seed

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:17.030 
still we're all pretty nice looking seed
it's<00:06:13.540> really<00:06:13.900> not<00:06:14.020> much<00:06:14.230> more<00:06:14.290> besides<00:06:14.980> uh

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:17.040 
it's really not much more besides uh

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:22.600 
it's really not much more besides uh
just<00:06:18.510> utter<00:06:20.669> just
