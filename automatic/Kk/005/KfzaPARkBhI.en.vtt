I<00:02:10.640> had<00:02:11.640> to<00:02:11.790> pry<00:02:12.030> apart<00:02:12.060> the<00:02:14.000> actuator<00:02:15.740> okay<00:02:16.820> to

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
I had to pry apart the actuator okay to

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:19.430 
I had to pry apart the actuator okay to
get<00:02:17.970> this<00:02:18.210> piece<00:02:18.510> this<00:02:18.900> piece<00:02:19.020> that<00:02:19.200> I'm

is<00:02:24.000> the<00:02:24.120> actual<00:02:24.380> blender<00:02:25.380> actuator<00:02:25.890> right

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
is the actual blender actuator right

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.330 
is the actual blender actuator right
here<00:02:26.280> I<00:02:26.690> ordered<00:02:27.690> one<00:02:27.870> it's<00:02:28.740> not<00:02:28.980> the<00:02:29.100> part
