hi I'm Phil and today's episode of ness
and<00:00:15.280> go<00:00:15.519> video<00:00:16.059> is<00:00:16.779> a<00:00:16.930> bit<00:00:17.500> of<00:00:17.619> a<00:00:17.740> sweet<00:00:18.250> tooth

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:18.279 
and go video is a bit of a sweet tooth

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:20.339 
and go video is a bit of a sweet tooth
special<00:00:18.910> we're<00:00:19.300> going<00:00:19.480> to<00:00:19.570> look<00:00:19.750> at<00:00:19.990> how<00:00:20.290> to

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:20.349 
special we're going to look at how to

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:24.060 
special we're going to look at how to
take<00:00:20.619> a<00:00:20.650> blood<00:00:20.950> sugar<00:00:21.599> and<00:00:22.599> the<00:00:22.720> most<00:00:23.070> accurate

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:24.070 
take a blood sugar and the most accurate

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:28.380 
take a blood sugar and the most accurate
way<00:00:24.220> to<00:00:24.250> do<00:00:24.520> it<00:00:24.669> so<00:00:25.560> firstly<00:00:27.000> we<00:00:28.000> need<00:00:28.029> to<00:00:28.210> get

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:28.390 
way to do it so firstly we need to get

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:30.720 
way to do it so firstly we need to get
our<00:00:28.570> equipment<00:00:29.230> prepared<00:00:29.860> properly<00:00:30.099> so<00:00:30.610> we've

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:30.730 
our equipment prepared properly so we've

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:32.490 
our equipment prepared properly so we've
got<00:00:30.849> to<00:00:30.939> make<00:00:31.059> sure<00:00:31.119> our<00:00:31.270> glucometer<00:00:32.079> is

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:32.500 
got to make sure our glucometer is

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.400 
got to make sure our glucometer is
checked<00:00:33.220> and<00:00:33.550> calibrated<00:00:34.180> correctly<00:00:34.630> so

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:35.410 
checked and calibrated correctly so

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:39.740 
checked and calibrated correctly so
that's<00:00:35.860> usually<00:00:36.540> done<00:00:37.540> as<00:00:37.719> per<00:00:37.960> local<00:00:38.350> policy

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
that's usually done as per local policy

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.590 
that's usually done as per local policy
check<00:00:40.750> the<00:00:41.370> testing<00:00:42.370> strip<00:00:42.789> the<00:00:43.210> glucose

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:43.600 
check the testing strip the glucose

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.770 
check the testing strip the glucose
testing<00:00:44.050> strip<00:00:44.489> matches<00:00:45.489> the<00:00:46.089> same<00:00:46.359> number

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:46.780 
testing strip matches the same number

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.259 
testing strip matches the same number
the<00:00:47.079> top<00:00:47.260> on<00:00:47.589> your<00:00:47.679> glucometer<00:00:48.429> so<00:00:48.940> that<00:00:49.120> they

00:00:49.259 --> 00:00:49.269 
the top on your glucometer so that they

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:51.270 
the top on your glucometer so that they
correspond<00:00:49.929> if<00:00:50.199> they<00:00:50.559> don't<00:00:50.800> you<00:00:51.070> need<00:00:51.249> to

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:51.280 
correspond if they don't you need to

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.770 
correspond if they don't you need to
recalibrate<00:00:52.120> your<00:00:53.909> sample<00:00:54.909> sticks<00:00:55.149> with<00:00:55.629> your

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:55.780 
recalibrate your sample sticks with your

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.160 
recalibrate your sample sticks with your
glucometer<00:00:56.940> also<00:00:57.940> need<00:00:58.120> like<00:00:58.570> a<00:00:58.600> little<00:00:58.960> land

00:00:59.160 --> 00:00:59.170 
glucometer also need like a little land

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.029 
glucometer also need like a little land
set<00:00:59.499> something<00:01:00.219> to<00:01:00.399> pierce<00:01:00.819> the<00:01:01.059> skin<00:01:02.039> and

00:01:03.029 --> 00:01:03.039 
set something to pierce the skin and

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:06.090 
set something to pierce the skin and
also<00:01:03.489> a<00:01:04.150> little<00:01:04.420> cotton<00:01:04.900> bud<00:01:05.080> or<00:01:05.470> something<00:01:05.860> to

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:06.100 
also a little cotton bud or something to

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.180 
also a little cotton bud or something to
occlude<00:01:06.790> the<00:01:07.380> pinprick<00:01:08.380> site<00:01:08.620> because<00:01:09.070> it's

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:09.190 
occlude the pinprick site because it's

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:11.940 
occlude the pinprick site because it's
only<00:01:09.340> capillary<00:01:10.000> test<00:01:10.270> that<00:01:10.450> we're<00:01:10.600> doing<00:01:10.950> so

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:11.950 
only capillary test that we're doing so

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.730 
only capillary test that we're doing so
firstly<00:01:12.730> make<00:01:13.420> sure<00:01:13.630> that<00:01:13.900> the<00:01:14.050> person<00:01:14.230> hasn't

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:14.740 
firstly make sure that the person hasn't

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:16.680 
firstly make sure that the person hasn't
just<00:01:14.860> eaten<00:01:15.160> a<00:01:15.250> big<00:01:15.460> sticky<00:01:15.850> gem<00:01:16.090> doughnut<00:01:16.570> and

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:16.690 
just eaten a big sticky gem doughnut and

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:18.930 
just eaten a big sticky gem doughnut and
they've<00:01:16.840> got<00:01:17.020> sugar<00:01:17.350> all<00:01:17.470> over<00:01:17.500> the<00:01:17.830> hands<00:01:18.310> so

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:18.940 
they've got sugar all over the hands so

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:21.090 
they've got sugar all over the hands so
I<00:01:19.330> always<00:01:19.540> get<00:01:19.840> the<00:01:19.930> patient<00:01:20.350> to<00:01:20.380> wash<00:01:20.860> their

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.100 
I always get the patient to wash their

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:22.560 
I always get the patient to wash their
hands<00:01:21.280> in<00:01:21.460> the<00:01:21.550> sink<00:01:21.820> not<00:01:22.150> with<00:01:22.360> alcohol

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:22.570 
hands in the sink not with alcohol

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:24.810 
hands in the sink not with alcohol
because<00:01:23.110> that<00:01:23.230> can<00:01:23.380> affect<00:01:23.710> the<00:01:23.920> glucose

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:24.820 
because that can affect the glucose

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:26.910 
because that can affect the glucose
result<00:01:25.240> so<00:01:25.840> just<00:01:26.050> give<00:01:26.200> them<00:01:26.350> a<00:01:26.410> wash<00:01:26.620> in<00:01:26.650> the

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:26.920 
result so just give them a wash in the

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.820 
result so just give them a wash in the
sink<00:01:26.950> first<00:01:27.490> dry<00:01:27.970> their<00:01:28.210> hands<00:01:28.450> off<00:01:28.690> if<00:01:29.440> they

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:29.830 
sink first dry their hands off if they

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.640 
sink first dry their hands off if they
can't<00:01:30.550> get<00:01:30.760> to<00:01:30.880> a<00:01:30.910> sink<00:01:31.270> what<00:01:31.930> you<00:01:32.050> can<00:01:32.200> do<00:01:32.380> is

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:32.650 
can't get to a sink what you can do is

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:35.580 
can't get to a sink what you can do is
just<00:01:32.980> get<00:01:33.240> flannel<00:01:34.240> wet<00:01:34.570> it<00:01:34.720> wash<00:01:35.080> their<00:01:35.320> hands

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:35.590 
just get flannel wet it wash their hands

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.620 
just get flannel wet it wash their hands
and<00:01:35.860> then<00:01:36.010> get<00:01:36.220> a<00:01:36.250> towel<00:01:36.550> to<00:01:36.790> dry<00:01:36.970> it<00:01:37.030> quickly

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.470 

places<00:01:40.630> that<00:01:40.810> we<00:01:41.080> take<00:01:41.470> a<00:01:41.500> blood<00:01:41.830> sugar<00:01:42.010> on<00:01:42.970> the

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:43.480 
places that we take a blood sugar on the

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:45.360 
places that we take a blood sugar on the
sides<00:01:43.780> of<00:01:43.930> the<00:01:44.050> finger<00:01:44.440> I<00:01:44.620> never<00:01:44.860> used<00:01:45.130> the

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:45.370 
sides of the finger I never used the

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:47.700 
sides of the finger I never used the
finger<00:01:45.880> pad<00:01:46.120> itself<00:01:46.510> because<00:01:46.960> there's<00:01:47.440> a<00:01:47.530> lot

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:47.710 
finger pad itself because there's a lot

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:51.750 
finger pad itself because there's a lot
of<00:01:47.740> nerve<00:01:48.010> endings<00:01:48.460> in<00:01:48.670> and<00:01:49.890> diabetics<00:01:50.890> who

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:51.760 
of nerve endings in and diabetics who

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:54.900 
of nerve endings in and diabetics who
you<00:01:52.630> know<00:01:52.750> have<00:01:53.170> regular<00:01:53.590> blood<00:01:53.800> sugar<00:01:54.040> levels

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:54.910 
you know have regular blood sugar levels

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:58.710 
you know have regular blood sugar levels
done<00:01:55.620> they<00:01:56.620> give<00:01:56.830> a<00:01:57.280> decreased<00:01:58.000> sensation<00:01:58.180> in

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:58.720 
done they give a decreased sensation in

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.540 
done they give a decreased sensation in
their<00:01:58.870> fingertips<00:01:59.260> so<00:01:59.800> if<00:01:59.950> you're<00:02:00.100> doing<00:02:00.220> the

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:00.550 
their fingertips so if you're doing the

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:02.820 
their fingertips so if you're doing the
fingertip<00:02:01.090> you<00:02:01.390> know<00:02:02.080> you're<00:02:02.260> sticking<00:02:02.740> a

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:02.830 
fingertip you know you're sticking a

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:04.170 
fingertip you know you're sticking a
needle<00:02:03.010> in<00:02:03.340> whether<00:02:03.550> they've<00:02:03.670> got<00:02:03.880> decreased

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:04.180 
needle in whether they've got decreased

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.030 
needle in whether they've got decreased
sensation<00:02:04.690> anyway<00:02:05.170> they<00:02:05.560> give<00:02:05.710> them<00:02:05.830> lose

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:06.040 
sensation anyway they give them lose

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.790 
sensation anyway they give them lose
more<00:02:06.310> sensation<00:02:07.060> so<00:02:07.390> trying<00:02:08.170> to<00:02:08.289> you<00:02:08.679> know

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:08.800 
more sensation so trying to you know

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.050 
more sensation so trying to you know
maintain<00:02:09.190> as<00:02:09.640> much<00:02:11.760> sensation<00:02:12.760> and<00:02:13.000> the

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
maintain as much sensation and the

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.420 
maintain as much sensation and the
fingers<00:02:13.390> as<00:02:13.510> possible<00:02:14.080> I<00:02:14.200> always<00:02:14.830> go<00:02:15.099> to<00:02:15.160> the

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
fingers as possible I always go to the

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.819 
fingers as possible I always go to the
side<00:02:15.670> and<00:02:16.030> the<00:02:16.719> sides<00:02:16.959> give<00:02:17.200> you<00:02:17.290> just<00:02:17.499> enough

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:17.829 
side and the sides give you just enough

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:20.700 
side and the sides give you just enough
blood<00:02:18.099> as<00:02:18.249> well<00:02:18.599> what<00:02:19.599> we<00:02:19.749> try<00:02:19.989> and<00:02:20.109> do<00:02:20.230> is

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:20.710 
blood as well what we try and do is

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
you hold the finger down so the blood

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:25.650 
you hold the finger down so the blood
actually<00:02:23.890> runs<00:02:24.310> down<00:02:24.610> to<00:02:24.640> it<00:02:25.000> so<00:02:25.270> after<00:02:25.420> you

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
actually runs down to it so after you

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.080 
actually runs down to it so after you
cleaned<00:02:25.930> up<00:02:26.080> wipe<00:02:26.320> the<00:02:26.500> finger<00:02:26.830> damn<00:02:27.090> home
