titanium<00:01:29.670> and<00:01:30.110> it<00:01:31.110> is<00:01:31.259> a<00:01:31.500> frame<00:01:32.040> walk<00:01:32.310> as<00:01:32.610> trout

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
titanium and it is a frame walk as trout

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.270 
titanium and it is a frame walk as trout
showed<00:01:33.570> you<00:01:33.750> earlier<00:01:34.110> and<00:01:34.259> it's<00:01:34.860> got<00:01:35.009> a<00:01:35.040> nice

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
showed you earlier and it's got a nice

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.710 
showed you earlier and it's got a nice
little<00:01:35.640> pocket<00:01:36.060> clip<00:01:36.360> on<00:01:36.570> it<00:01:36.950> not<00:01:37.950> reversible

little pocket clip on it not reversible

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.539 
little pocket clip on it not reversible
so<00:01:39.720> you're<00:01:40.049> only<00:01:40.140> looking<00:01:40.500> at<00:01:40.770> one<00:01:40.979> position

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
so you're only looking at one position

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:46.130 
so you're only looking at one position
on<00:01:41.939> there<00:01:42.210> and<00:01:42.420> that<00:01:43.320> is<00:01:43.560> going<00:01:43.890> to<00:01:44.070> be<00:01:45.140> tipped

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
on there and that is going to be tipped

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.910 
on there and that is going to be tipped
down<00:01:47.090> so<00:01:48.090> for<00:01:48.390> me<00:01:48.540> I<00:01:48.810> don't<00:01:49.229> mind<00:01:49.439> that<00:01:49.590> at<00:01:49.680> all

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
down so for me I don't mind that at all

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.920 
down so for me I don't mind that at all
and<00:01:50.340> we<00:01:50.520> did<00:01:50.700> put<00:01:50.909> a<00:01:50.939> little<00:01:51.090> tape<00:01:51.329> up<00:01:51.689> on<00:01:51.840> the

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930

top<00:01:52.140> of<00:01:52.170> it<00:01:52.500> here<00:01:52.530> because<00:01:52.950> there's<00:01:53.280> there's

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579
