00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.120
 hi everyone knows mali drop and 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.660
 today we find ourselves for 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.590
 new videos 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:23.970
 I will talk about the future update 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:26.789
 2.21 so the wheel last night we went 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.609
 actually makes billion short actually 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.830
 we have a lot of fun and we have 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.510
 background on what seems to be the 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:37.949
 new dimension to which we will have 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:39.920
 access the dimension sram sram bad 

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:43.250
 apparently that will pay 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:46.879
 so we had three to bruce above them 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:48.800
 background so apparently for the 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:51.339
 first it would be travelers from 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:55.780
 time that would be accused of stealing 

00:00:51.339 --> 00:01:00.049
 the inhabitants of the world of the twelve 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:02.530
 but then our point of round ball 

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:09.950
 they say it would be a trickery 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:12.619
 with foxnews not bad huh so that would be 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:15.140
 a hoax and the values of the world 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:20.360
 of travelers would dimensional 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:22.009
 scapegoats like here and there that 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.440
 would be just sram to fall back 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:27.470
 which would come to with the opening of 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:32.860
 portals shutters the inhabitants so here 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:35.080
 we even have a little video here we go 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:38.810
 we go 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:42.890
 worse they are we're good the city by 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:48.250
 example here so we have a pretty town 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:51.250
 dark really gloomy empty 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:55.680
 so you see there that's what it is 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:57.760
 it might be the boss I do not know 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.100
 it seems that at the convention was 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:03.220
 game something like that a little 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:08.229
 boss tram so maybe I win this 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:09.850
 would be hi 150 cells 206 that 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:14.260
 walking yet fifty words 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:15.880
 150 200 so apparently we will have the beta 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:19.720
 which June so that's cool 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:22.810
 I'm going I live to see game 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:26.560
 dofus skin but it is especially this morning 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:28.690
 in the update is at stake the setting to 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:31.630
 day would be June 17th 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:36.060
 so that does not make us in in 17 days 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:42.010
 a little over two weeks forgiveness 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:43.510
 so it looks pretty good for now 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.060
 and we have not talked about the dofus for 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:48.160
 again the cellars not so dofus for 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:52.590
 sourat in the sram quests fight 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:57.930
 precisely because he says that this ram 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:03:00.959
 bad baram the simple to say without bat c 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:03.180
 a life that is poor so have a 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:07.349
 primordial dofus in his city it would be 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:09.930
 strange and more launched we did not hurt 

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:12.959
 tison synthesize three ads into one 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:15.209
 day when he might have been 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:17.730
 start a little bit before by 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:18.689
 example the last announcement that goes back 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.599
 at 23 

00:03:18.689 --> 00:03:25.859
 Finally, May 28 , you have known that 

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:29.129
 advertisers in the green of which there is 

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:31.740
 a small and therefore it is not many 

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:33.960
 announcements of the momentum dofus 

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:35.880
 I'll wait for that kids will do 

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:36.500
 surely maybe in the days that 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:41.000
 are coming 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:43.890
 there will also seem to be a 1 st 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.160
 in quotation marks ecaflip I'm not calling 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:49.470
 it really like that, it's okay 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:53.010
 if it's serious because it's really 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:54.510
 cheap and the redesign the gap will not have 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:55.560
 the best now 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:57.780
 I think it's because of the 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:01.769
 goultarminator from what he said if he 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:05.040
 it would be too violent for 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:08.129
 get used to the gameplay change of the 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:10.079
 class but actually I do not know if 

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:13.709
 really does it because still has some 

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:15.780
 shields apart immunity all that it has 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:17.850
 Looks strange enough that's it 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:20.930
 will walk by gliding but I think that it 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:24.479
 is going to kill him in the pm the poor 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:28.860
 so also the brain das has been 

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:35.250
 completely destroyed adios hamouda saleh 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:36.780
 spiritual completely destroyed but by 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:38.940
 against flip gaps 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:41.510
 I'm fine I feel like ankama 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:41.510
 like them 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:47.669
 So the civil calendar so it is 

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:50.160
 of course that's the dimension will be 

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:51.090
 less as it says in the calendar in 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.740
 June 2014 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:54.900
 you 'd have to take a walk to the side 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:56.280
 fram so much better since the god 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:57.449
 allows you to cross the field 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:00.270
 mine that he reserves for you 

00:04:57.449 --> 00:05:02.220
 nice no and among all the traps at 8 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:03.960
 and during this month of June a 1/2 in 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:06.330
 which will have to be thrown 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:08.729
 go in search of tofu this pure and 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:12.870
 face the dead minotaur 

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:15.270
 you would be wrong so had once again 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:17.729
 I think we will not have the dofus 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:20.630
 for in the dimension this tram that we 

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:23.430
 says we have to face the minotaur 

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:25.470
 so I think there may be a 

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:27.180
 series of quests on the north island that 

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:30.330
 would be nice because it's still 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:31.889
 a little girl and my very small and 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:34.199
 a little neglected what's there 

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:36.870
 there is a pnj for the dungeon no quest 

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:38.550
 so it would be really cool 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:42.770
 maybe to maybe a little enlarged I 

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:44.660
 do not know the labyrinth may be seen 

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:47.120
 I think the little girl will be fine 

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:48.970
 change everything there I hope it would be that 

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:51.409
 would still be better 

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:53.210
 but now it was a pretty video 

00:05:51.409 --> 00:05:53.949
 quick to talk about it and give some 

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:57.590
 impressions 

00:05:53.949 --> 00:05:59.599
 I think it will be really 

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:03.349
 good update very big update 

00:05:59.599 --> 00:06:04.970
 day also compared to May to but here is 

00:06:03.349 --> 00:06:06.169
 it's a very small content I think 

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:09.590
 it was just to make us 

00:06:06.169 --> 00:06:10.940
 wait for joint he plays a game 

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:14.990
 is really a fat 

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:17.139
 July day we will have kenya so that I 

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:20.690
 think it's always updating 

00:06:17.139 --> 00:06:22.550
 same as but to prepare us for 

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:24.039
 updated standards of August that I think 

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:29.599
 that she will be really huge 

00:06:24.039 --> 00:06:31.940
 the whale there too a big bet 

00:06:29.599 --> 00:06:34.060
 day with the dimension that I love I 

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:37.430
 thought 

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:41.060
 there it will be I think a little bit to 

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:43.220
 day maybe several quests 

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:47.900
 I do not know but I think about the layout quite 

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:49.280
 nice may have some news 

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:52.250
 rewards in your treasure hunt 

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:55.009
 do not know that that makes me think of 

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:56.120
 the secret parchment episode is the 

00:06:55.009 --> 00:07:00.910
 even because too much watching carefully 

00:06:56.120 --> 00:07:04.160
 for contours and december 

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:07.630
 there I do not know maybe dimension 

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:12.680
 hossa and ben who say that's 

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:16.210
 laurent it's called the eliatropes must 

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:17.440
 see I think not seen that 

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:19.530
 they say it's impossible 

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:21.789
 eliatropes imsand they were there 

00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:23.229
 several thousand years before the era 

00:07:21.789 --> 00:07:26.979
 both crazy so it's possible that they 

00:07:23.229 --> 00:07:29.979
 are at stake it would be pretty inconsistent 

00:07:26.979 --> 00:07:31.569
 I think because he wins 

00:07:29.979 --> 00:07:39.699
 not his world of the twelve they are on 

00:07:31.569 --> 00:07:41.440
 their planet and cod ben here so I 

00:07:39.699 --> 00:07:44.410
 do not really know me right now 

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:46.860
 it's mostly I'll talk about it again in time 

00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:49.060
 in due time as we say 

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:51.820
 but hey I'll stop there 

00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:55.530
 thank you for watching the video and I 

00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:55.530
 tell you next time
