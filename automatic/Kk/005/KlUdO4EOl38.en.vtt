00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:22.210 
discovered by accident actually and that

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.280 
discovered by accident actually and that
is<00:00:22.390> using<00:00:22.900> the<00:00:23.680> groove<00:00:24.570> analyzer<00:00:25.570> and<00:00:25.990> the

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:26.290 
is using the groove analyzer and the

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:28.080 
is using the groove analyzer and the
groove<00:00:26.470> detection<00:00:26.920> system<00:00:27.279> witness<00:00:27.820> to<00:00:27.970> do

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:28.090 
groove detection system witness to do

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:31.769 
groove detection system witness to do
want<00:00:28.300> to<00:00:29.010> copy<00:00:30.010> drum<00:00:30.520> parts<00:00:30.970> into<00:00:31.390> MIDI<00:00:31.570> part

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:31.779 
want to copy drum parts into MIDI part

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:33.600 
want to copy drum parts into MIDI part
so<00:00:31.960> basically<00:00:32.259> convert<00:00:32.500> audio<00:00:32.800> to<00:00:32.890> MIDI<00:00:33.160> it's

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:33.610 
so basically convert audio to MIDI it's

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:35.460 
so basically convert audio to MIDI it's
cool<00:00:34.210> little<00:00:34.360> trick<00:00:34.540> and<00:00:34.840> it<00:00:35.050> doesn't<00:00:35.320> take

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:35.470 
cool little trick and it doesn't take

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:36.780 
cool little trick and it doesn't take
long<00:00:35.500> to<00:00:35.770> figure<00:00:35.920> out<00:00:36.100> but<00:00:36.370> it's<00:00:36.550> well<00:00:36.760> worth

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:36.790 
long to figure out but it's well worth

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:39.180 
long to figure out but it's well worth
trying<00:00:37.329> out<00:00:37.630> if<00:00:37.810> you're<00:00:38.350> not<00:00:38.650> a<00:00:38.680> drummer<00:00:39.040> and

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:10.510 
first thing I want to do is get a

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:12.120 
first thing I want to do is get a
quantize<00:01:11.050> but<00:01:11.440> in<00:01:11.530> quantize<00:01:11.890> you<00:01:11.980> have<00:01:12.070> two

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:12.130 
quantize but in quantize you have two

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
quantize but in quantize you have two
options<00:01:12.370> you<00:01:12.400> have<00:01:12.520> this<00:01:12.580> grid<00:01:12.790> option<00:01:13.030> you

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:13.150 
options you have this grid option you

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:14.400 
options you have this grid option you
have<00:01:13.210> this<00:01:13.360> groove<00:01:13.630> option<00:01:13.990> groove<00:01:14.200> isn't

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:15.890 
have this groove option groove isn't
only<00:01:14.500> used<00:01:14.770> for<00:01:15.160> actually<00:01:15.370> getting<00:01:15.550> stuff

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
only used for actually getting stuff

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.899 
only used for actually getting stuff
sync<00:01:16.900> together<00:01:17.080> it<00:01:17.560> with<00:01:18.220> the<00:01:18.340> groove<00:01:18.610> but

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:18.909 
sync together it with the groove but

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:21.690 
sync together it with the groove but
what<00:01:19.119> I've<00:01:19.240> discovered<00:01:19.420> is<00:01:19.990> that<00:01:20.049> if<00:01:20.530> we<00:01:20.740> come

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:21.700 
what I've discovered is that if we come

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.550 
what I've discovered is that if we come
here<00:01:22.000> and<00:01:22.090> we<00:01:22.180> drag<00:01:22.600> the<00:01:22.840> snare<00:01:23.140> drum<00:01:23.320> into

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:23.560 
here and we drag the snare drum into

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.410 
here and we drag the snare drum into
there<00:01:23.890> as<00:01:24.299> you<00:01:25.299> can<00:01:25.420> see<00:01:25.689> it's<00:01:25.990> now<00:01:26.439> mapped

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
there as you can see it's now mapped

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.170 
there as you can see it's now mapped
apart<00:01:28.420> from<00:01:29.350> that<00:01:29.560> snare<00:01:29.860> drum<00:01:30.159> so<00:01:30.399> what<00:01:30.820> I<00:01:30.850> can

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:31.180 
apart from that snare drum so what I can

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.389 
apart from that snare drum so what I can
do<00:01:31.390> is<00:01:31.600> if<00:01:32.259> I<00:01:32.350> drag<00:01:32.590> that<00:01:32.710> now<00:01:32.890> it<00:01:33.070> seems<00:01:33.280> to

00:01:33.389 --> 00:01:33.399 
do is if I drag that now it seems to

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:34.319 
do is if I drag that now it seems to
have<00:01:33.490> picked<00:01:33.610> up<00:01:33.759> other<00:01:33.939> stuff<00:01:34.210> that's

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:34.329 
have picked up other stuff that's

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:35.819 
have picked up other stuff that's
spilled<00:01:34.689> into<00:01:34.869> there<00:01:35.110> as<00:01:35.259> well<00:01:35.470> so<00:01:35.649> I'm<00:01:35.740> going

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:35.829 
spilled into there as well so I'm going

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:38.010 
spilled into there as well so I'm going
to<00:01:35.890> clear<00:01:36.220> that<00:01:36.310> again<00:01:36.640> and<00:01:37.479> I'm<00:01:37.600> first<00:01:37.869> going

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020 
to clear that again and I'm first going

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.380 
to clear that again and I'm first going
to<00:01:38.079> go<00:01:38.140> here<00:01:38.530> I'm<00:01:39.250> going<00:01:39.460> to<00:01:39.520> analyze<00:01:39.939> the

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:40.390 
to go here I'm going to analyze the

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:41.789 
to go here I'm going to analyze the
snare<00:01:40.689> and<00:01:40.930> I'm<00:01:41.110> going<00:01:41.229> to<00:01:41.259> bring<00:01:41.470> it<00:01:41.560> down<00:01:41.740> a

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:41.799 
snare and I'm going to bring it down a

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:42.060 
snare and I'm going to bring it down a
bit

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:42.070 
bit

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:44.249 
bit
so<00:01:42.340> it's<00:01:42.549> a<00:01:42.759> bit<00:01:43.060> less<00:01:43.299> sensitive<00:01:43.750> so<00:01:44.020> there<00:01:44.170> we

00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:44.259 
so it's a bit less sensitive so there we

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:47.010 
so it's a bit less sensitive so there we
go<00:01:44.590> so<00:01:45.130> now<00:01:45.250> go<00:01:45.430> back<00:01:45.640> here<00:01:45.909> again<00:01:45.939> and<00:01:46.420> I<00:01:46.780> grab

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 
go so now go back here again and I grab

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.469 
go so now go back here again and I grab
this<00:01:47.200> num<00:01:47.409> put<00:01:47.530> this<00:01:47.619> up<00:01:47.770> in<00:01:47.860> here<00:01:48.189> and<00:01:49.119> I<00:01:49.270> pick

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:49.479 
this num put this up in here and I pick

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:52.069 
this num put this up in here and I pick
this<00:01:49.600> up<00:01:49.659> and<00:01:49.990> drag<00:01:50.200> it<00:01:50.320> down<00:01:50.439> to<00:01:50.469> ezdrummer

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:56.340 
this up and drag it down to ezdrummer
there<00:01:53.079> and<00:01:53.640> now<00:01:54.640> if<00:01:54.700> we<00:01:54.850> so<00:01:55.090> low<00:01:55.149> that<00:01:55.350> what

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 
there and now if we so low that what

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:57.660 
there and now if we so low that what
will<00:01:56.560> happen<00:01:56.590> is<00:01:57.070> it<00:01:57.219> doesn't<00:01:57.460> know<00:01:57.549> which

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
will happen is it doesn't know which

that and do just quickly what I will do

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:23.460 
that and do just quickly what I will do
is<00:03:21.220> just<00:03:21.250> the<00:03:21.959> analysis<00:03:22.959> of<00:03:23.080> it<00:03:23.110> now<00:03:23.290> that's

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
is just the analysis of it now that's

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.170 
is just the analysis of it now that's
too<00:03:23.770> sensitive<00:03:24.520> so<00:03:24.730> I'm<00:03:24.790> going<00:03:24.910> to<00:03:24.970> put<00:03:25.090> them

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
too sensitive so I'm going to put them

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:26.790 
too sensitive so I'm going to put them
to<00:03:25.390> standard<00:03:25.810> mode<00:03:25.989> for<00:03:26.140> a<00:03:26.170> second<00:03:26.440> analyze

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:26.800 
to standard mode for a second analyze

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:34.350 
to standard mode for a second analyze
that<00:03:27.100> so<00:03:28.030> I<00:03:28.060> look<00:03:28.330> how<00:03:28.630> that<00:03:28.690> looks<00:03:29.020> like<00:03:33.360> now

will go to there and we will drag that
into<00:03:44.200> there<00:03:44.650> we'll<00:03:45.400> break<00:03:45.730> that<00:03:45.910> down<00:03:46.090> and

original drums or you can replace them
it's<00:04:40.259> entirely<00:04:40.620> up<00:04:40.830> to<00:04:40.889> you<00:04:41.220> but<00:04:41.729> the<00:04:41.820> cool

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.030 
it's entirely up to you but the cool

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:43.400 
it's entirely up to you but the cool
thing<00:04:42.060> is<00:04:42.360> as<00:04:42.389> well<00:04:42.630> as<00:04:42.750> if<00:04:42.840> we<00:04:42.960> go<00:04:43.110> into<00:04:43.260> that

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:43.410 
thing is as well as if we go into that

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:45.950 
thing is as well as if we go into that
snare<00:04:43.830> for<00:04:44.010> a<00:04:44.070> minute<00:04:44.310> you'll<00:04:44.460> see<00:04:44.810> but<00:04:45.810> it's

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:45.960 
snare for a minute you'll see but it's

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:47.510 
snare for a minute you'll see but it's
pretty<00:04:46.139> damn<00:04:46.350> accurate<00:04:46.560> look<00:04:47.070> it's<00:04:47.310> not

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 
pretty damn accurate look it's not

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:51.500 
pretty damn accurate look it's not
actually<00:04:47.789> hitting<00:04:48.139> there<00:04:49.139> on<00:04:49.380> the<00:04:50.330> smack<00:04:51.330> on

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:51.510 
actually hitting there on the smack on

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:52.939 
actually hitting there on the smack on
the<00:04:51.539> beat<00:04:51.840> because<00:04:52.050> actually<00:04:52.410> the<00:04:52.530> snare<00:04:52.770> drum

00:04:52.939 --> 00:04:52.949 
the beat because actually the snare drum

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:56.390 
the beat because actually the snare drum
itself<00:04:53.370> doesn't<00:04:54.090> do<00:04:54.300> that<00:04:54.419> either<00:04:55.100> if<00:04:56.100> we<00:04:56.190> come

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:56.400 
itself doesn't do that either if we come

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.360 
itself doesn't do that either if we come
in<00:04:56.580> and<00:04:57.150> we<00:04:57.210> see<00:04:57.570> them<00:04:57.750> so<00:04:57.990> it's<00:04:58.620> very<00:04:59.130> accurate

00:04:59.360 --> 00:04:59.370 
in and we see them so it's very accurate

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:02.270 
in and we see them so it's very accurate
and<00:04:59.699> if<00:04:59.760> we<00:04:59.850> put<00:05:00.000> the<00:05:00.090> two<00:05:00.120> together<00:05:00.419> in<00:05:01.280> parts

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:02.280 
and if we put the two together in parts

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.700 
and if we put the two together in parts
so<00:05:02.760> as<00:05:03.000> I<00:05:03.030> say<00:05:03.389> that<00:05:03.720> it's<00:05:03.960> the<00:05:04.080> snare<00:05:04.410> drum<00:05:04.590> I

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:04.710 
so as I say that it's the snare drum I

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:16.719 
so as I say that it's the snare drum I
think<00:05:04.949> there<00:05:05.599> we<00:05:06.599> settle<00:05:06.960> that<00:05:07.110> snare<00:05:07.440> drum

00:05:16.719 --> 00:05:16.729 

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:24.620 

choose<00:05:17.729> a<00:05:17.760> different<00:05:17.940> snare<00:05:18.300> to<00:05:18.419> play<00:05:23.630> that's

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:24.630 
choose a different snare to play that's

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:26.390 
choose a different snare to play that's
it<00:05:24.930> it's<00:05:25.260> as<00:05:25.500> simple<00:05:25.710> as<00:05:25.919> that

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:26.400 
it it's as simple as that

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:27.589 
it it's as simple as that
thanks<00:05:26.820> for<00:05:26.940> watching<00:05:27.210> and<00:05:27.300> I'll<00:05:27.360> see<00:05:27.389> you
