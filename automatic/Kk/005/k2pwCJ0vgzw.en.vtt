00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:55.350

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.300
 had some kind of instinct but for my 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.070
 head is tempting to be heard yesterday 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.629

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.140
 storm in the ocean of love I 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.500
 dipping I hear before the sweet 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.270
 melody of the pacts of having sung 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.310

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.930
 sort repatriation but I count myself 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.760

 social networks I understood quests 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:13.120

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.959
