00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:30.760
 convenient than analogs in models with an index 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:33.640
 iz well true here are four buttons instead 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:37.660

 pixels is 325 which is 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:54.880
 the screen has a good indicator 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:57.160
 decent but not maximum angles 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:01.000
 review and gives a contrast picture on 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:03.310
 how much allows tft matrix in 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.900
 most cases, the brightness is enough 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.090
 for work on a sunny day

 several keyboard layouts 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:21.720
 and the choice of the color of the cover that in practice 

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:24.920
 gives less number of typing errors 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.920

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:43.740
 small comfortable of course you can not say 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:45.260

 funny mode in visualization and 8 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:59.160
 preinstalled 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:02.880

 video 

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:09.450
 extracted on the Internet recommend 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:11.820
 install the mx player application to 

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:14.970
 the display did not appear impossible 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:17.760
 play the file but in everything 

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:20.479
 the rest of course the video on this 

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:25.590
 the screen is a pleasure to watch 

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:27.530
 thanks to hdmi output, this whole thing is possible 

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:30.840
 connect to tv and enjoy 

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:33.479
 movies on the big screen and not worth it 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:35.760
 forget that sony smartphone issues 

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:36.740
 excellent sound quality which 

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:40.050
 need to add 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:42.479
 good headphones in xperia ion 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:44.430
 12 megapixel module is installed as 

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:48.270
 xperia models are popular in their time 

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:50.400
 s interesting that the quality of the pictures a little 

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:52.800
 better than in the mentioned model 

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:55.050
 as far as the camera interface is concerned 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:57.330
 It is extremely convenient and allows you to do 

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:59.820
 settings on the go after all in large 

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:03.510
 notation no problem getting a finger 

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:07.260
 and unlike the xperia v model 

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:09.300
 there is no super auto mode and automatics 

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:11.520
 works a little worse and sometimes wrong with 

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:15.710
 choice scenes however skillful 

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:15.710
 Outstanding good shots guaranteed 

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:22.360
 sony xperia ion was the flagship only 

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:24.669
 one month but during this time managed to dial 

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:27.340
 a lot of likes to your address 

00:06:24.669 --> 00:06:30.100
 that is why it is made in a stylish 

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:32.889
 metal case up to once more 

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:35.620
 emphasize your charisma and beautiful 

00:06:32.889 --> 00:06:38.229
 technological component and the price of 

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:41.970
 he is very good and quite acceptable 

00:06:38.229 --> 00:06:41.970
 therefore we recommend to purchase
