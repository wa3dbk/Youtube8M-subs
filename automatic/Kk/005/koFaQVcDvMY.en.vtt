00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.789 
and here's why so first of all the taste
was<00:01:51.479> really<00:01:51.899> nice<00:01:52.110> there's<00:01:52.470> two<00:01:52.649> different

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
was really nice there's two different

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.249 
was really nice there's two different
flavors<00:01:53.280> I<00:01:53.490> was<00:01:53.579> a<00:01:53.610> mocha<00:01:54.000> and<00:01:54.180> a<00:01:54.630> vanilla<00:01:54.780> and

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
flavors I was a mocha and a vanilla and

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.850 
flavors I was a mocha and a vanilla and
I<00:01:56.219> liked<00:01:56.610> them<00:01:56.880> both<00:01:57.119> I<00:01:57.479> had<00:01:58.229> heard<00:01:58.500> that<00:01:58.530> they

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
I liked them both I had heard that they

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.249 
I liked them both I had heard that they
were<00:01:58.890> really<00:01:59.189> sweet<00:01:59.549> but<00:02:00.090> I<00:02:00.540> actually<00:02:00.840> found

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
were really sweet but I actually found

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:02.719 
were really sweet but I actually found
them<00:02:01.500> to<00:02:01.619> be<00:02:01.649> just<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.159> right<00:02:02.189> amount<00:02:02.369> of

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
them to be just the right amount of

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.459 
them to be just the right amount of
sweet<00:02:02.969> there's<00:02:03.570> actually<00:02:03.869> only<00:02:03.899> a<00:02:04.079> hundred

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
sweet there's actually only a hundred

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.399 
sweet there's actually only a hundred
calories<00:02:05.280> or<00:02:05.549> less<00:02:05.579> in<00:02:06.119> each<00:02:06.270> serving<00:02:06.810> so

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
calories or less in each serving so

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.260 
calories or less in each serving so
that's<00:02:07.890> pretty<00:02:08.190> impressive<00:02:08.459> because<00:02:08.849> a<00:02:09.000> lot

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
that's pretty impressive because a lot

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.260
