00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
one of these

so to give back in the groove of things
I<00:00:13.349> wanted<00:00:13.799> to<00:00:13.889> start<00:00:14.070> with<00:00:14.160> something<00:00:14.309> really

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
I wanted to start with something really

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.180 
I wanted to start with something really
simple<00:00:14.670> it's<00:00:15.570> just<00:00:15.690> the<00:00:16.170> basic<00:00:16.770> way<00:00:16.890> that<00:00:16.920> I

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
simple it's just the basic way that I

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.970 
simple it's just the basic way that I
curl<00:00:17.550> my<00:00:17.580> hair<00:00:17.699> on<00:00:18.359> a<00:00:18.420> normal<00:00:18.900> day<00:00:19.050> I<00:00:19.260> haven't

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
curl my hair on a normal day I haven't

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.439 
curl my hair on a normal day I haven't
done<00:00:20.130> one<00:00:20.279> date<00:00:20.430> since<00:00:20.580> I<00:00:20.699> cut<00:00:20.910> my<00:00:21.060> hair<00:00:21.210> so<00:00:21.420> I

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
done one date since I cut my hair so I

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.420 
done one date since I cut my hair so I
thought<00:00:21.660> I<00:00:21.689> would<00:00:21.810> share<00:00:22.080> it<00:00:22.140> with<00:00:22.380> you<00:00:22.590> and

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
thought I would share it with you and

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:24.769 
thought I would share it with you and
maybe<00:00:23.580> those<00:00:23.820> of<00:00:23.880> you<00:00:24.119> with<00:00:24.240> shorter<00:00:24.570> to

maybe those of you with shorter to

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.150 
maybe those of you with shorter to
medium<00:00:25.109> length<00:00:25.289> hair<00:00:25.560> could<00:00:25.680> get<00:00:25.830> something

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
medium length hair could get something

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.210 
medium length hair could get something
out<00:00:26.279> of<00:00:26.310> it<00:00:26.490> so<00:00:26.840> to<00:00:27.840> get<00:00:27.930> started<00:00:28.080> it<00:00:28.470> I'm<00:00:28.619> just

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
out of it so to get started it I'm just

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.009 
out of it so to get started it I'm just
going<00:00:29.429> to<00:00:29.550> section<00:00:29.939> out<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.150> bottom<00:00:30.449> part<00:00:30.900> of

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019

going to section out the bottom part of
my<00:00:31.080> hair<00:00:31.230> I'm<00:00:31.679> using<00:00:31.740> a<00:00:32.690> one-inch<00:00:33.690> curling

iron<00:00:34.170> this<00:00:34.320> is<00:00:34.380> by<00:00:34.559> Hot<00:00:34.800> Tools

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
iron this is by Hot Tools

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.119 
iron this is by Hot Tools
it's<00:00:35.700> a<00:00:35.850> Marcel<00:00:36.239> iron<00:00:36.480> and<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:37.649> main

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
it's a Marcel iron and the main

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:39.650 
it's a Marcel iron and the main
difference<00:00:38.520> with<00:00:38.670> Marcel<00:00:39.030> irons<00:00:39.239> and<00:00:39.390> regular

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
difference with Marcel irons and regular

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.090 
difference with Marcel irons and regular
and<00:00:39.809> it's<00:00:39.930> just<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.290> Marcel<00:00:40.620> in<00:00:40.770> turn<00:00:40.860> has

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
and it's just the Marcel in turn has

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.470 
and it's just the Marcel in turn has
this<00:00:42.000> non<00:00:42.840> spring<00:00:43.559> handle<00:00:44.010> to<00:00:44.190> it<00:00:44.420> as<00:00:45.420> a

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
this non spring handle to it as a

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:46.760 
this non spring handle to it as a
professional<00:00:45.989> hair<00:00:46.200> size<00:00:46.350> it<00:00:46.530> makes<00:00:46.620> it

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
professional hair size it makes it

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.029 
professional hair size it makes it
easier<00:00:47.070> for<00:00:47.129> me<00:00:47.340> to<00:00:48.059> do<00:00:48.750> a<00:00:48.780> lot<00:00:49.110> of<00:00:49.170> curling<00:00:49.829> and

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
easier for me to do a lot of curling and

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.979 
easier for me to do a lot of curling and
very<00:00:50.520> short<00:00:50.760> amount<00:00:50.969> of<00:00:51.000> time<00:00:51.059> so<00:00:51.690> that's<00:00:51.870> the

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
very short amount of time so that's the

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.689 
very short amount of time so that's the
reason<00:00:52.110> why<00:00:52.350> I<00:00:52.410> use<00:00:52.500> this<00:00:52.980> one<00:00:53.219> it's<00:00:53.370> easier<00:00:53.640> on

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
reason why I use this one it's easier on

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.010 
reason why I use this one it's easier on
my<00:00:53.850> wrist<00:00:54.090> but<00:00:54.360> you<00:00:54.449> can<00:00:54.629> use<00:00:54.780> a<00:00:54.809> regular

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
my wrist but you can use a regular

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.549 
my wrist but you can use a regular
spring<00:00:55.440> iron<00:00:55.680> just<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.460> exact<00:00:56.730> same<00:00:56.910> way<00:00:57.059> so

00:00:57.549 --> 00:00:57.559 
spring iron just the exact same way so

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:00.470 
spring iron just the exact same way so
basically<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.890> biggest<00:00:59.190> thing<00:00:59.640> with<00:00:59.879> this<00:01:00.180> is

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
basically the biggest thing with this is

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.630 
basically the biggest thing with this is
just<00:01:01.140> where<00:01:01.350> you<00:01:01.500> start<00:01:01.890> your<00:01:02.039> curl<00:01:02.280> I've<00:01:02.460> had

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
just where you start your curl I've had

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.299 
just where you start your curl I've had
a<00:01:02.670> lot<00:01:02.879> of<00:01:02.910> clients<00:01:03.149> complain<00:01:03.719> about<00:01:04.320> their

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
a lot of clients complain about their

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.190 
a lot of clients complain about their
curl<00:01:05.670> falling<00:01:05.970> out<00:01:06.119> and<00:01:06.420> then<00:01:06.570> being<00:01:06.930> left

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
curl falling out and then being left

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.719 
curl falling out and then being left
with<00:01:07.409> just<00:01:07.560> a<00:01:07.650> little<00:01:07.830> bit<00:01:08.130> on<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.369> ends<00:01:08.640> by

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
with just a little bit on the ends by

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.429 
with just a little bit on the ends by
the<00:01:08.790> end<00:01:09.030> of<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.180> day<00:01:09.299> and<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:09.990> reason<00:01:10.409> that

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
the end of the day and the reason that

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.289 
the end of the day and the reason that
that<00:01:10.560> happens<00:01:11.130> to<00:01:11.280> those<00:01:11.400> people<00:01:11.580> is<00:01:11.880> because

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
that happens to those people is because

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:13.850 
that happens to those people is because
they're<00:01:12.869> starting<00:01:13.290> their<00:01:13.380> curl<00:01:13.680> at<00:01:13.770> the

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
they're starting their curl at the

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.740 
they're starting their curl at the
bottom<00:01:14.250> and<00:01:14.430> then<00:01:14.549> wrapping<00:01:14.970> up<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.570> hair

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
bottom and then wrapping up the hair

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.450 
bottom and then wrapping up the hair
strand<00:01:16.110> so<00:01:16.680> when<00:01:16.830> you<00:01:16.920> start<00:01:17.159> at<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.340> bottom

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
strand so when you start at the bottom

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.130 
strand so when you start at the bottom
you're<00:01:17.759> directing<00:01:18.150> all<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.540> heat<00:01:18.780> on<00:01:18.990> this

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
you're directing all the heat on this

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.890 
you're directing all the heat on this
end<00:01:19.500> and<00:01:19.770> then<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:20.610> last<00:01:20.970> direct<00:01:21.360> heat<00:01:21.570> is<00:01:21.720> put

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
end and then the last direct heat is put

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.080 
end and then the last direct heat is put
at<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.080> top<00:01:22.320> so<00:01:22.619> naturally<00:01:23.070> as<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.610> day<00:01:23.909> goes

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
at the top so naturally as the day goes

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.490 
at the top so naturally as the day goes
on<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.509> hair<00:01:24.689> that<00:01:24.720> I<00:01:24.869> have<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.080> more<00:01:25.229> direct

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
on the hair that I have the more direct

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.289 
on the hair that I have the more direct
heat<00:01:25.710> which<00:01:25.860> is<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.009> ends<00:01:26.460> is<00:01:26.880> going<00:01:27.180> to

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
heat which is the ends is going to

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.569 
heat which is the ends is going to
remain<00:01:27.509> curled<00:01:27.869> so<00:01:28.409> in<00:01:28.770> order<00:01:28.920> to<00:01:29.070> fight<00:01:29.369> that

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
remain curled so in order to fight that

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.569 
remain curled so in order to fight that
what<00:01:29.820> you<00:01:29.909> need<00:01:30.060> to<00:01:30.180> do<00:01:30.329> is<00:01:31.040> clamp<00:01:32.040> at<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.250> top

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
what you need to do is clamp at the top

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.830 
what you need to do is clamp at the top
first<00:01:33.030> and<00:01:33.479> just<00:01:34.380> slowly<00:01:35.060> release<00:01:36.060> and<00:01:36.420> work

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
first and just slowly release and work

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.050 
first and just slowly release and work
your<00:01:37.020> way<00:01:37.170> down<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.439> hair<00:01:37.710> strand<00:01:38.100> now<00:01:38.759> when<00:01:39.030> I

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
your way down the hair strand now when I

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.450 
your way down the hair strand now when I
do<00:01:39.240> this<00:01:39.540> curl<00:01:39.869> I<00:01:40.079> like<00:01:40.290> to<00:01:40.470> leave<00:01:40.710> that<00:01:41.189> ends

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
do this curl I like to leave that ends

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:42.859 
do this curl I like to leave that ends
out<00:01:41.610> just<00:01:41.850> a<00:01:41.970> little<00:01:42.000> bit<00:01:42.329> to<00:01:42.479> keep<00:01:42.659> it<00:01:42.810> a

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
out just a little bit to keep it a

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.749 
out just a little bit to keep it a
little<00:01:43.049> bit<00:01:43.259> more<00:01:43.409> natural<00:01:43.590> but<00:01:44.340> if<00:01:44.430> you<00:01:44.549> want

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
little bit more natural but if you want

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.960 
little bit more natural but if you want
a<00:01:45.000> more<00:01:45.270> done<00:01:45.720> look<00:01:46.380> then<00:01:47.070> you<00:01:47.100> can<00:01:47.579> bring<00:01:47.820> the

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
a more done look then you can bring the

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.609 
a more done look then you can bring the
ends<00:01:48.240> all<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:48.509> way<00:01:48.630> through<00:01:48.930> so<00:01:49.290> the<00:01:49.380> first

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
ends all the way through so the first

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.440 
ends all the way through so the first
section<00:01:49.799> is<00:01:50.040> done<00:01:50.250> both<00:01:50.610> sides<00:01:50.939> are<00:01:51.090> curl<00:01:51.270> away

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
section is done both sides are curl away

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.960 
section is done both sides are curl away
from<00:01:51.689> my<00:01:51.780> face<00:01:52.049> and<00:01:52.350> in<00:01:53.159> the<00:01:53.250> back<00:01:53.460> I<00:01:53.700> just

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
from my face and in the back I just

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.760 
from my face and in the back I just
switch<00:01:54.180> directions<00:01:54.509> so<00:01:54.990> they're<00:01:55.470> going<00:01:55.680> in

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
switch directions so they're going in

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.830 
switch directions so they're going in
opposite<00:01:56.189> directions<00:01:56.250> in<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:56.939> back<00:01:57.090> now<00:01:57.750> I'm

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
opposite directions in the back now I'm

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.090 
opposite directions in the back now I'm
going<00:01:57.960> to<00:01:58.020> move<00:01:58.140> on<00:01:58.229> to<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:58.409> next<00:01:58.500> section<00:01:58.740> I

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
going to move on to the next section I

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.289 
going to move on to the next section I
like<00:01:59.340> to<00:01:59.460> take<00:01:59.610> about<00:01:59.820> four<00:02:00.060> different

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
like to take about four different

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.749 
like to take about four different
sections<00:02:00.479> with<00:02:00.810> my<00:02:00.960> hair<00:02:01.200> thickness<00:02:01.759> this

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
sections with my hair thickness this

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.090 
sections with my hair thickness this
might<00:02:02.969> vary<00:02:03.719> based<00:02:04.049> on<00:02:04.259> how<00:02:04.320> thick<00:02:04.740> your<00:02:05.040> hair

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
might vary based on how thick your hair

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.059 
might vary based on how thick your hair
is<00:02:05.460> my<00:02:05.640> has<00:02:05.850> about<00:02:06.299> a<00:02:06.329> medium<00:02:06.719> density<00:02:06.979> so<00:02:07.979> if

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
is my has about a medium density so if

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.260 
is my has about a medium density so if
yours<00:02:08.220> is<00:02:08.369> really<00:02:08.489> fine<00:02:08.759> you<00:02:08.970> might<00:02:09.090> be<00:02:09.179> able

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
yours is really fine you might be able

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.699 
yours is really fine you might be able
to<00:02:09.390> get<00:02:09.479> away<00:02:09.539> with<00:02:09.780> three<00:02:09.989> sections<00:02:10.259> if<00:02:10.590> it's

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
to get away with three sections if it's

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:11.460 
to get away with three sections if it's
really<00:02:10.920> thick

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
really thick

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.450 
really thick
consider<00:02:12.010> taking<00:02:12.160> some<00:02:12.340> more<00:02:13.650> now<00:02:14.650> something

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:15.460 
consider taking some more now something

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:17.400 
consider taking some more now something
that<00:02:15.490> my<00:02:16.240> clients<00:02:16.600> have<00:02:16.630> also<00:02:16.870> had<00:02:17.170> a<00:02:17.200> little

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
that my clients have also had a little

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.850 
that my clients have also had a little
bit<00:02:17.560> of<00:02:17.650> an<00:02:17.740> issue<00:02:17.860> with<00:02:18.130> is<00:02:18.430> figuring<00:02:19.240> out

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
bit of an issue with is figuring out

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.860 
bit of an issue with is figuring out
what<00:02:20.860> like<00:02:21.370> how<00:02:21.580> to<00:02:21.640> use<00:02:22.000> their<00:02:22.180> client<00:02:22.630> to<00:02:22.690> get

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
what like how to use their client to get

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.500 
what like how to use their client to get
it<00:02:22.960> to<00:02:23.050> curl<00:02:23.230> waves<00:02:23.440> in<00:02:23.560> their<00:02:23.680> face<00:02:23.860> now<00:02:24.640> it

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
it to curl waves in their face now it

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:26.670 
it to curl waves in their face now it
took<00:02:25.690> a<00:02:25.750> little<00:02:26.020> bit<00:02:26.140> of<00:02:26.230> getting<00:02:26.350> used<00:02:26.440> to

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
took a little bit of getting used to

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.460 
took a little bit of getting used to
because<00:02:27.010> I<00:02:27.100> think<00:02:27.160> that<00:02:27.930> everyone<00:02:28.930> has<00:02:29.140> a

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
because I think that everyone has a

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.770 
because I think that everyone has a
natural<00:02:30.100> way<00:02:30.160> that<00:02:30.190> they<00:02:30.430> like<00:02:30.610> to<00:02:30.790> use<00:02:30.820> their

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
natural way that they like to use their

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.570 
natural way that they like to use their
wrist<00:02:32.020> when<00:02:32.230> their<00:02:32.350> curling<00:02:32.710> I'm<00:02:32.860> left-handed

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
wrist when their curling I'm left-handed

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:35.760 
wrist when their curling I'm left-handed
so<00:02:33.790> it's<00:02:34.420> gonna<00:02:34.570> be<00:02:34.720> the<00:02:34.810> opposite<00:02:35.230> side<00:02:35.440> that

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:35.770 
so it's gonna be the opposite side that

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:37.800 
so it's gonna be the opposite side that
I<00:02:35.800> struggle<00:02:36.310> with<00:02:36.340> then<00:02:36.670> for<00:02:37.000> most<00:02:37.180> writing

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
I struggle with then for most writing

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.380 
I struggle with then for most writing
ended<00:02:38.080> people<00:02:38.230> but<00:02:39.160> what<00:02:39.310> I<00:02:39.340> found<00:02:39.760> in<00:02:40.120> a<00:02:40.270> way

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
ended people but what I found in a way

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.840 
ended people but what I found in a way
that's<00:02:40.630> pretty<00:02:40.780> easy<00:02:41.050> to<00:02:41.260> explain<00:02:41.680> it<00:02:41.890> is<00:02:42.040> you

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:42.850 
that's pretty easy to explain it is you

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:44.220 
that's pretty easy to explain it is you
need<00:02:42.940> to<00:02:43.060> make<00:02:43.180> sure<00:02:43.210> that<00:02:43.450> the<00:02:43.690> top<00:02:43.900> of<00:02:43.930> your

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
need to make sure that the top of your

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.470 
need to make sure that the top of your
curling<00:02:44.440> iron<00:02:44.530> is<00:02:44.740> always<00:02:45.040> facing<00:02:45.280> upwards<00:02:45.820> so

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
curling iron is always facing upwards so

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.570 
curling iron is always facing upwards so
when<00:02:46.630> you<00:02:46.720> clamp<00:02:46.959> the<00:02:47.200> hair<00:02:47.410> you<00:02:48.130> want<00:02:48.340> that<00:02:48.459> to

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
when you clamp the hair you want that to

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:51.449 
when you clamp the hair you want that to
be<00:02:48.700> facing<00:02:49.090> up<00:02:49.270> and<00:02:49.510> the<00:02:50.440> clamp<00:02:50.770> is<00:02:51.010> going<00:02:51.340> to

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
be facing up and the clamp is going to

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:54.150 
be facing up and the clamp is going to
be<00:02:51.610> facing<00:02:52.060> forward<00:02:52.270> so<00:02:52.959> the<00:02:53.140> nose<00:02:53.350> is<00:02:53.620> up<00:02:53.860> and

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
be facing forward so the nose is up and

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.699 
be facing forward so the nose is up and
the<00:02:54.220> clamp<00:02:54.459> is<00:02:54.610> facing<00:02:54.940> towards<00:02:55.330> your<00:02:55.450> face<00:02:55.709> so

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709 
the clamp is facing towards your face so

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:59.190 
the clamp is facing towards your face so
on<00:02:57.040> this<00:02:57.310> side<00:02:57.580> this<00:02:58.270> is<00:02:58.330> actually<00:02:58.750> my<00:02:58.870> easier

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
on this side this is actually my easier

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.040 
on this side this is actually my easier
side<00:02:59.700> now<00:03:00.700> when<00:03:00.850> I<00:03:00.880> move<00:03:01.090> over<00:03:01.209> here<00:03:01.690> this<00:03:01.930> is

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.050 
side now when I move over here this is

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:03.720 
side now when I move over here this is
when<00:03:02.170> it<00:03:02.260> gets<00:03:02.350> a<00:03:02.470> little<00:03:02.560> complicated<00:03:02.740> so<00:03:03.490> I

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
when it gets a little complicated so I

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.430 
when it gets a little complicated so I
have<00:03:04.120> to<00:03:04.270> think<00:03:04.390> about<00:03:04.660> it<00:03:04.810> so<00:03:04.930> have<00:03:05.020> to<00:03:05.140> think

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 
have to think about it so have to think

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:10.290 
have to think about it so have to think
no<00:03:05.950> the<00:03:06.190> up<00:03:06.660> plant<00:03:07.660> forward<00:03:08.260> spin<00:03:09.070> backward<00:03:09.640> so

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:10.300 
no the up plant forward spin backward so

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:11.550
