00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:34.549 
the lace that you are making so in this

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:38.559 
the lace that you are making so in this
lace<00:01:34.789> here<00:01:35.149> where<00:01:35.329> I<00:01:35.359> have<00:01:35.659> these<00:01:37.329> flowers<00:01:38.329> I

00:01:38.559 --> 00:01:38.569 
lace here where I have these flowers I

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:42.190 
lace here where I have these flowers I
guess<00:01:38.719> at<00:01:38.869> the<00:01:38.959> edges<00:01:39.139> with<00:01:39.380> six<00:01:40.899> petals<00:01:41.899> I

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
guess at the edges with six petals I

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.739 
guess at the edges with six petals I
will<00:01:42.439> the<00:01:43.249> two<00:01:43.489> petals<00:01:43.729> closest<00:01:44.359> to<00:01:44.479> the<00:01:44.569> edge

00:01:44.739 --> 00:01:44.749 
will the two petals closest to the edge

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:46.690 
will the two petals closest to the edge
of<00:01:44.929> the<00:01:44.989> lace<00:01:45.229> I<00:01:45.469> will<00:01:45.770> pin<00:01:46.039> within<00:01:46.520> those

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
of the lace I will pin within those

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.169 
of the lace I will pin within those
holes<00:01:47.319> to<00:01:48.319> help<00:01:48.560> spread<00:01:49.069> out<00:01:49.340> and<00:01:49.579> get<00:01:49.880> that

00:01:50.169 --> 00:01:50.179 
holes to help spread out and get that

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:53.169 
holes to help spread out and get that
scalloped<00:01:50.840> edge<00:01:51.130> now<00:01:52.130> as<00:01:52.369> i<00:01:52.549> go<00:01:52.700> i<00:01:52.729> will<00:01:52.999> also

00:01:53.169 --> 00:01:53.179 
scalloped edge now as i go i will also

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:56.019 
scalloped edge now as i go i will also
periodically<00:01:53.959> pin<00:01:54.380> the<00:01:55.189> center<00:01:55.579> of<00:01:55.609> the<00:01:55.849> lace

00:01:56.019 --> 00:01:56.029 
periodically pin the center of the lace

00:01:56.029 --> 00:02:01.899 
periodically pin the center of the lace
to<00:01:56.779> help<00:01:57.049> I<00:01:57.609> guess<00:01:58.609> keep<00:01:58.999> it<00:02:00.729> from<00:02:01.729> moving

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:01.909 
to help I guess keep it from moving

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:04.319 
to help I guess keep it from moving
around<00:02:02.119> too<00:02:02.479> much<00:02:02.599> as<00:02:02.840> I<00:02:02.989> continue<00:02:03.409> doing<00:02:03.679> this

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:04.329 
around too much as I continue doing this

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:09.009 
around too much as I continue doing this
so<00:02:05.329> I'll<00:02:05.479> pin<00:02:07.360> into<00:02:08.360> each<00:02:08.479> of<00:02:08.569> the<00:02:08.659> flowers

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:09.019 
so I'll pin into each of the flowers

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:11.860 
so I'll pin into each of the flowers
right<00:02:09.200> here<00:02:09.709> and<00:02:10.090> depending<00:02:11.090> on<00:02:11.209> how<00:02:11.420> many<00:02:11.629> I

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
right here and depending on how many I

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:13.449 
right here and depending on how many I
guess<00:02:12.409> you<00:02:12.530> want<00:02:12.680> to<00:02:12.769> be<00:02:12.829> conservative<00:02:13.189> with

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
guess you want to be conservative with

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:14.290 
guess you want to be conservative with
your<00:02:13.819> pins

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300 
your pins

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.870 
your pins
as<00:02:14.390> you<00:02:14.600> start<00:02:14.950> because<00:02:15.950> there's<00:02:16.730> nothing

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
as you start because there's nothing

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.090 
as you start because there's nothing
more<00:02:17.360> annoying<00:02:17.600> than<00:02:17.870> running<00:02:18.200> out<00:02:18.500> of<00:02:18.530> pins

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
more annoying than running out of pins

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:27.220 
more annoying than running out of pins
as<00:02:19.370> you<00:02:20.110> start<00:02:21.110> blocking<00:02:21.470> your<00:02:21.830> lace<00:02:26.140> you<00:02:27.140> know

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
as you start blocking your lace you know

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:28.960 
as you start blocking your lace you know
even<00:02:27.530> without<00:02:27.620> pinning<00:02:28.220> you<00:02:28.340> can<00:02:28.490> see<00:02:28.670> here

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
even without pinning you can see here

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.530 
even without pinning you can see here
that<00:02:29.000> the<00:02:29.510> lace<00:02:29.690> is<00:02:29.720> staying<00:02:30.910> fairly<00:02:31.910> well<00:02:32.300> but

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
that the lace is staying fairly well but

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:37.600 
that the lace is staying fairly well but
I<00:02:32.930> will<00:02:33.110> pin<00:02:33.290> it<00:02:33.410> out<00:02:33.530> to<00:02:33.710> get<00:02:33.860> a<00:02:34.100> nice<00:02:36.610> shape

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
I will pin it out to get a nice shape

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:39.820 
I will pin it out to get a nice shape
the<00:02:37.850> lace<00:02:38.030> and<00:02:38.300> I<00:02:38.510> want<00:02:38.660> to<00:02:38.720> add<00:02:38.840> that<00:02:38.870> as<00:02:39.260> I'm

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
the lace and I want to add that as I'm

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:43.210 
the lace and I want to add that as I'm
pinning<00:02:40.930> my<00:02:41.930> ways<00:02:42.110> I'm<00:02:42.290> not<00:02:42.440> just<00:02:42.770> stretching

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
pinning my ways I'm not just stretching

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.710 
pinning my ways I'm not just stretching
it<00:02:43.400> out<00:02:44.740> to<00:02:45.740> in<00:02:46.490> the<00:02:46.760> width<00:02:47.000> I'm<00:02:47.330> also

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.650 
it out to in the width I'm also
stretching<00:02:48.410> it<00:02:48.560> in<00:02:48.770> the<00:02:49.370> length<00:02:49.640> because<00:02:50.390> the

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
stretching it in the length because the

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.780 
stretching it in the length because the

along the garter a bit on like so and

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:54.640 
along the garter a bit on like so and
we'll<00:03:52.850> let<00:03:53.120> this<00:03:53.300> sit<00:03:53.630> and<00:03:53.870> let<00:03:54.110> it<00:03:54.170> dry<00:03:54.470> again

all right the starch spray has dried
which<00:03:57.950> means<00:03:58.280> that<00:03:58.430> now<00:03:58.760> we<00:03:59.209> get<00:03:59.390> to<00:04:00.190> remove

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:01.190 
which means that now we get to remove

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:05.110 
which means that now we get to remove
the<00:04:01.400> pins<00:04:01.670> and<00:04:02.120> you<00:04:02.870> can<00:04:03.050> see<00:04:03.320> that<00:04:03.350> the<00:04:04.120> shape

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 
the pins and you can see that the shape

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.590 
the pins and you can see that the shape
of<00:04:05.300> the<00:04:05.420> lace<00:04:05.600> is<00:04:05.870> not<00:04:06.170> changing<00:04:07.010> as<00:04:07.190> i<00:04:07.600> remove

00:04:33.459 --> 00:04:33.469 
and even though I've only start sprayed

00:04:33.469 --> 00:04:36.159 
and even though I've only start sprayed
one<00:04:33.770> side<00:04:34.129> at<00:04:34.399> this<00:04:34.550> plant<00:04:34.849> you<00:04:35.659> can<00:04:35.809> see<00:04:36.139> that

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:36.169 
one side at this plant you can see that

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:38.679 
one side at this plant you can see that
the<00:04:36.409> lace<00:04:36.770> is<00:04:37.039> holding<00:04:37.489> its<00:04:37.639> shell<00:04:37.879> shape<00:04:38.389> very

00:04:38.679 --> 00:04:38.689
