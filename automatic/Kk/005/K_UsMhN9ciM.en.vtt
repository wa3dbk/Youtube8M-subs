00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
show you what to do so i use an acetone

show you what to do so i use an acetone
free<00:00:56.460> polish<00:00:57.149> remover<00:00:57.660> and<00:00:57.690> the<00:00:57.870> reason<00:00:58.170> i<00:00:58.260> use

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
free polish remover and the reason i use

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.799 
free polish remover and the reason i use
acetone<00:00:58.859> free<00:00:59.309> is<00:00:59.460> because<00:01:00.000> these<00:01:00.300> are<00:01:00.480> not<00:01:00.629> my

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
acetone free is because these are not my

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.640 
acetone free is because these are not my
nails<00:01:01.050> i<00:01:02.010> have<00:01:02.430> a<00:01:03.110> system<00:01:04.110> put<00:01:04.290> on<00:01:04.379> my<00:01:04.470> nails

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:06.740 
called light concept it's a product from

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.289 
called light concept it's a product from
germany<00:01:07.740> and<00:01:07.979> it's<00:01:08.130> very<00:01:08.340> similar<00:01:08.700> to<00:01:08.880> gel

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
germany and it's very similar to gel

germany and it's very similar to gel
nails<00:01:09.600> so<00:01:10.320> that's<00:01:10.500> my<00:01:10.740> nails<00:01:11.010> so<00:01:11.400> my<00:01:11.610> nails

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
nails so that's my nails so my nails

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.330 
nails so that's my nails so my nails
don't<00:01:12.119> absorb<00:01:12.540> polish<00:01:13.439> i<00:01:13.560> think<00:01:13.770> as<00:01:13.920> much<00:01:13.950> as

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
don't absorb polish i think as much as

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.850 
don't absorb polish i think as much as
other<00:01:14.610> people's<00:01:15.000> nails<00:01:15.299> but<00:01:16.049> anyway<00:01:16.710> this

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
other people's nails but anyway this

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.090

works for anybody and everybody so

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.130 
works for anybody and everybody so
anyway<00:01:20.790> that's<00:01:20.909> why<00:01:21.119> i<00:01:21.150> use<00:01:21.390> non<00:01:21.630> acetone

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
anyway that's why i use non acetone

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.899 
anyway that's why i use non acetone

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:34.410 
found in the craft section I think of

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:35.659 
found in the craft section I think of
most<00:04:34.620> stores<00:04:34.949> that's<00:04:35.220> what<00:04:35.370> these<00:04:35.460> are

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:35.669 
most stores that's what these are

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:37.490 
most stores that's what these are
typically<00:04:36.090> used<00:04:36.150> for<00:04:36.330> his<00:04:36.570> craft<00:04:36.900> some<00:04:37.290> things

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500 
typically used for his craft some things

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.260 
typically used for his craft some things
where<00:04:37.680> you<00:04:37.770> really<00:04:38.010> want<00:04:38.190> some<00:04:38.669> concentrated

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270 
where you really want some concentrated

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:41.480 
where you really want some concentrated
light<00:04:39.540> it<00:04:40.350> takes<00:04:40.620> four<00:04:40.979> double<00:04:41.340> A<00:04:41.460> batteries

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490 
light it takes four double A batteries

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:45.350 
light it takes four double A batteries
it's<00:04:42.360> actually<00:04:43.169> pretty<00:04:43.440> heavy<00:04:44.400> for<00:04:45.000> what<00:04:45.240> it

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.360 
it's actually pretty heavy for what it

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.360 
it's actually pretty heavy for what it
is<00:04:45.449> I<00:04:45.780> think<00:04:45.840> the<00:04:46.020> battery<00:04:46.320> weight<00:04:46.530> helps<00:04:46.800> too

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.370 
is I think the battery weight helps too

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:49.340 
is I think the battery weight helps too
but<00:04:48.000> it's<00:04:48.150> got<00:04:48.270> this<00:04:48.360> little<00:04:48.449> carry<00:04:48.810> handle

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:49.350 
but it's got this little carry handle

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:52.430 
but it's got this little carry handle
which<00:04:49.740> you<00:04:49.919> can<00:04:50.100> use<00:04:50.130> or<00:04:50.430> not<00:04:50.580> use<00:04:50.960> so<00:04:51.960> anyway<00:04:52.260> I

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:52.440 
which you can use or not use so anyway I

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.909 
which you can use or not use so anyway I
use<00:04:52.710> that<00:04:53.040> to<00:04:53.280> dry<00:04:53.490> my<00:04:53.699> nails<00:04:53.940> so<00:04:54.240> I<00:04:54.270> put<00:04:54.540> the

00:04:54.909 --> 00:04:54.919 
use that to dry my nails so I put the

00:04:54.919 --> 00:04:58.610 
use that to dry my nails so I put the
two<00:04:55.919> coats<00:04:56.130> of<00:04:56.280> this<00:04:56.460> on<00:04:57.290> followed<00:04:58.290> by<00:04:58.410> one

00:04:58.610 --> 00:04:58.620 
two coats of this on followed by one

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:02.030 
two coats of this on followed by one

coat of the IBD UV topcoat and there's

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:03.890 
coat of the IBD UV topcoat and there's
lots<00:05:02.160> of<00:05:02.340> different<00:05:02.610> UV<00:05:02.880> top<00:05:03.090> coats<00:05:03.360> out<00:05:03.570> there

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:03.900 
lots of different UV top coats out there

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:07.159 
lots of different UV top coats out there
I<00:05:04.710> just<00:05:05.190> find<00:05:05.400> this<00:05:05.700> to<00:05:06.120> be<00:05:06.150> a<00:05:06.270> great<00:05:06.570> top<00:05:06.900> coat

that sent me the link about it also sent

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:53.690 
that sent me the link about it also sent
me<00:05:50.610> a<00:05:50.639> code<00:05:51.030> which<00:05:51.450> I<00:05:51.599> don't<00:05:51.660> recall<00:05:52.700> for

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:53.700 
me a code which I don't recall for

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:55.670 
me a code which I don't recall for
twenty<00:05:53.970> percent<00:05:54.270> off<00:05:54.510> so<00:05:54.960> it<00:05:55.020> was<00:05:55.110> thirty<00:05:55.470> nine

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:55.680 
twenty percent off so it was thirty nine

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:57.320 
twenty percent off so it was thirty nine
ninety<00:05:55.710> nine<00:05:56.039> twenty<00:05:56.520> percent<00:05:56.789> off<00:05:56.970> and<00:05:57.210> then

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:57.330 
ninety nine twenty percent off and then

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:00.170 
ninety nine twenty percent off and then
shipping<00:05:57.810> so<00:05:58.110> um<00:05:58.500> it<00:05:59.220> was<00:05:59.340> basically<00:05:59.550> probably

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:00.180 
shipping so um it was basically probably

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:04.010 
shipping so um it was basically probably
still<00:06:00.740> about<00:06:01.740> $35<00:06:02.580> or<00:06:02.760> so<00:06:02.970> so<00:06:03.660> that's<00:06:03.870> what<00:06:03.990> it

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:04.020 
still about $35 or so so that's what it

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:06.770 
still about $35 or so so that's what it
looks<00:06:04.260> like<00:06:04.410> but<00:06:04.470> i'm<00:06:04.740> sure<00:06:04.910> i'm<00:06:05.910> not<00:06:05.970> sure<00:06:06.539> i

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:06.780 
looks like but i'm sure i'm not sure i

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:08.330 
looks like but i'm sure i'm not sure i
would<00:06:07.289> think<00:06:07.470> you<00:06:07.650> could<00:06:07.800> probably<00:06:07.889> get<00:06:08.190> these
