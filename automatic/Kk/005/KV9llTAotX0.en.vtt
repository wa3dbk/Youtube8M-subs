00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
took a a little bit of cat v wiring and

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.289 
took a a little bit of cat v wiring and
opened<00:01:05.040> up<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.220> top<00:01:05.369> and<00:01:05.430> just<00:01:05.850> basically

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
opened up the top and just basically

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.080 
opened up the top and just basically
connected<00:01:06.900> it<00:01:06.960> to<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.170> terminals<00:01:08.090> twisted

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
connected it to the terminals twisted

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.550 
connected it to the terminals twisted
the<00:01:09.180> wire<00:01:09.299> around<00:01:09.390> so<00:01:09.930> that<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.140> battery<00:01:10.439> can

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
the wire around so that the battery can

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.020 
the wire around so that the battery can
be<00:01:10.970> slid<00:01:11.970> in<00:01:12.150> and<00:01:12.390> out<00:01:12.479> and<00:01:13.729> recharged<00:01:14.729> pretty

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
be slid in and out and recharged pretty

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.929 
be slid in and out and recharged pretty
easily<00:01:15.210> and<00:01:15.479> quickly<00:01:15.860> know<00:01:16.860> that<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.400> three

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
easily and quickly know that the three

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.210 
easily and quickly know that the three
button<00:01:18.210> cells<00:01:18.420> would<00:01:18.630> be<00:01:18.689> 4.5<00:01:19.619> volts<00:01:19.979> and<00:01:20.100> this

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
button cells would be 4.5 volts and this

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.830 
button cells would be 4.5 volts and this
is<00:01:20.340> only<00:01:20.430> a<00:01:20.580> three<00:01:20.790> point<00:01:21.030> seven<00:01:21.180> volt<00:01:21.330> battery

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
is only a three point seven volt battery

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.380 
is only a three point seven volt battery
but<00:01:22.130> doesn't<00:01:23.130> seem<00:01:23.280> to<00:01:23.430> be<00:01:23.549> any<00:01:23.880> lack<00:01:24.240> of

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
but doesn't seem to be any lack of

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.660 
but doesn't seem to be any lack of
performance<00:01:24.960> it<00:01:25.140> still<00:01:25.350> seems<00:01:25.590> to<00:01:25.680> work<00:01:25.950> just

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
performance it still seems to work just

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.660 
performance it still seems to work just
fine<00:01:26.820> actually<00:01:27.720> a<00:01:28.009> battery<00:01:29.009> life<00:01:29.189> with<00:01:29.520> the

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
fine actually a battery life with the

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.179 
fine actually a battery life with the
three<00:01:29.909> button<00:01:30.180> cells<00:01:30.420> was<00:01:30.659> about<00:01:31.049> twenty<00:01:32.040> to

which way it's going to start walking
you<00:01:51.420> can<00:01:51.540> take<00:01:51.750> just<00:01:51.899> one<00:01:52.110> step<00:01:52.350> at<00:01:52.470> a<00:01:52.530> time<00:01:52.560> and

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
you can take just one step at a time and

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.530 
you can take just one step at a time and
do<00:01:53.970> really<00:01:54.240> precise<00:01:54.720> movements<00:01:55.320> i<00:01:56.240> saw<00:01:57.240> a<00:01:57.270> very
