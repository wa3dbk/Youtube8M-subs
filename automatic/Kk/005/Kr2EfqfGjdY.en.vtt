leaf filling there with it but I'll

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:07.249 
leaf filling there with it but I'll
cover<00:02:05.280> it<00:02:05.399> up<00:02:05.459> and<00:02:05.610> see<00:02:05.700> if<00:02:05.789> I<00:02:05.880> can<00:02:06.140> please<00:02:07.140> we

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
if it does hit it cuz I guess yeah 12

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.170 
if it does hit it cuz I guess yeah 12
inches<00:02:19.769> that's<00:02:20.130> the<00:02:20.310> meatball<00:02:20.670> it<00:02:20.849> really<00:02:21.090> is

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
inches that's the meatball it really is

inches that's the meatball it really is
a<00:02:21.209> deep<00:02:21.480> hole

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:44.840 

so<00:02:42.980> we<00:02:43.980> get<00:02:44.100> the<00:02:44.220> detector

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
so we get the detector

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.400 
so we get the detector
I<00:02:44.880> don't<00:02:45.210> lose<00:02:45.360> work<00:02:45.570> what<00:02:45.930> was<00:02:46.020> that<00:02:46.140> and

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
I don't lose work what was that and

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.920 
I don't lose work what was that and
we'll<00:02:46.650> see<00:02:46.830> if<00:02:46.890> we<00:02:46.950> can<00:02:47.070> hit<00:02:47.160> it<00:02:47.840> okay<00:02:48.840> I'm

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
we'll see if we can hit it okay I'm

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.480 
we'll see if we can hit it okay I'm
gonna<00:02:49.020> sweep<00:02:49.260> over<00:02:49.470> the<00:02:49.650> area<00:02:49.950> where<00:02:50.130> I<00:02:50.160> got<00:02:50.370> it

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:50.490 
gonna sweep over the area where I got it

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:53.540 
gonna sweep over the area where I got it
buried<00:02:50.790> this<00:02:50.910> is<00:02:51.150> it's<00:02:51.510> at<00:02:51.660> 12<00:02:51.900> inches<00:02:52.170> I<00:02:52.590> got

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550 
buried this is it's at 12 inches I got

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:57.740 
buried this is it's at 12 inches I got
my<00:02:53.670> sensitivity<00:02:54.210> on<00:02:54.510> five<00:02:56.270> volume<00:02:57.270> at<00:02:57.360> seven

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
my sensitivity on five volume at seven

the enhanced mode we can even even pick

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:26.270 
the enhanced mode we can even even pick
it<00:03:08.580> up<00:03:08.670> at<00:03:08.760> all<00:03:08.850> under<00:03:09.150> 12<00:03:09.630> inches<00:03:25.280> everyone

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
it up at all under 12 inches everyone

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:31.850 
it up at all under 12 inches everyone
give<00:03:26.790> little<00:03:26.910> chirping<00:03:30.260> like<00:03:31.260> the<00:03:31.410> zinc<00:03:31.650> high

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860 
give little chirping like the zinc high

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:46.600 
give little chirping like the zinc high
tone<00:03:32.130> range<00:03:32.430> so

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:46.610 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:55.620 

I<00:03:46.640> can<00:03:47.330> actually<00:03:47.450> pinpoint<00:03:47.810> it<00:03:51.520> here<00:03:52.520> that

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:55.630 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:58.150 

just<00:03:56.630> barely<00:03:56.990> there's<00:03:57.500> nothing<00:03:57.890> that<00:03:58.040> you've

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.160 
just barely there's nothing that you've

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:59.470 
just barely there's nothing that you've
ever<00:03:58.310> even<00:03:58.550> you<00:03:58.910> know<00:03:59.000> you<00:03:59.120> probably<00:03:59.270> even

00:03:59.470 --> 00:03:59.480 
ever even you know you probably even

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:06.850 
ever even you know you probably even
notice<00:03:59.840> it<00:03:59.960> in<00:04:00.020> the<00:04:00.080> field<00:04:00.320> but<00:04:00.590> just<00:04:05.740> a<00:04:06.740> little

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:06.860 
notice it in the field but just a little

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:16.539 
notice it in the field but just a little
chirp<00:04:14.440> everyone<00:04:15.440> hear<00:04:15.860> that<00:04:15.890> just<00:04:16.190> a<00:04:16.310> little

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:16.549 
chirp everyone hear that just a little

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:22.420

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:27.710 
I just to the ground balance a little

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:35.800 
I just to the ground balance a little
bit<00:07:27.860> we<00:07:28.580> bit<00:07:28.760> off<00:07:28.970> the<00:07:29.150> air<00:07:29.300> but<00:07:34.390> so<00:07:35.390> no<00:07:35.540> it<00:07:35.660> does

00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:53.560 
hit pinpoint there's enough you'd be
able<00:07:43.910> to<00:07:44.030> dig<00:07:44.720> it<00:07:51.729> not<00:07:52.729> the<00:07:52.880> greatest<00:07:53.060> signal

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:53.570 
able to dig it not the greatest signal

00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:56.380 
able to dig it not the greatest signal
but<00:07:53.750> it<00:07:53.840> does<00:07:54.020> pick<00:07:54.260> it
