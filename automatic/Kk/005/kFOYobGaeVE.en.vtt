00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.939 
industry i think here you get a very
unbiased<00:04:51.479> view<00:04:51.810> we<00:04:52.289> sort<00:04:52.500> of<00:04:52.560> step<00:04:52.770> back<00:04:52.919> a

00:04:52.939 --> 00:04:52.949 
unbiased view we sort of step back a

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:55.219 
unbiased view we sort of step back a
little<00:04:53.099> bit<00:04:53.400> i'd<00:04:53.970> say<00:04:54.389> exactly<00:04:54.630> what<00:04:54.870> we<00:04:54.960> think

00:04:55.219 --> 00:04:55.229 
little bit i'd say exactly what we think

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:57.560 
and I think why makers appreciate that

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:01.189 
and I think why makers appreciate that

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:27.520 
low deal in that being that we have 2.5

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:31.170 
low deal in that being that we have 2.5
tons<00:06:28.330> per<00:06:28.510> hectare<00:06:29.250> usually<00:06:30.250> we<00:06:30.400> have<00:06:30.610> around

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:31.180

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:43.300 
and the bear it was so small so I think

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:49.610

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:37.130 
about and so that's a sign of confidence

00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:38.740 
about and so that's a sign of confidence
i<00:07:37.550> think<00:07:37.580> from<00:07:37.910> the<00:07:38.030> company<00:07:38.390> a<00:07:38.420> sign<00:07:38.630> of

00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:38.750 
i think from the company a sign of

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:40.420 
i think from the company a sign of

00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:42.500 
here in front of some pretty harsh

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:44.740 
here in front of some pretty harsh
critics<00:07:42.920> I<00:07:43.040> think<00:07:43.250> can<00:07:43.400> actually<00:07:43.730> show<00:07:44.000> what

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:44.750
