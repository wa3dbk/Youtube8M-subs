one<00:00:28.329> of<00:00:28.360> the<00:00:28.509> chords<00:00:28.899> so<00:00:29.680> when<00:00:30.579> I'm<00:00:30.700> playing

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:30.730 
one of the chords so when I'm playing

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:39.490 
one of the chords so when I'm playing
the<00:00:31.090> D<00:00:31.450> the<00:00:31.750> melody<00:00:32.110> is<00:00:32.200> going<00:00:32.259> to<00:00:32.439> go

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:39.500 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.450 

and<00:00:40.000> then<00:00:41.000> you'll<00:00:41.150> find<00:00:41.420> that<00:00:41.600> when<00:00:41.870> I<00:00:41.900> play

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:42.460 
and then you'll find that when I play

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.250 
and then you'll find that when I play
part<00:00:43.460> of<00:00:43.580> the<00:00:43.640> melody<00:00:44.030> the<00:00:44.720> melody<00:00:44.750> is<00:00:45.110> going

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:45.260

part of the melody the melody is going
to<00:00:45.320> come<00:00:45.500> up<00:00:45.620> on<00:00:45.800> the<00:00:46.310> fifth<00:00:46.760> and<00:00:46.940> seventh<00:00:47.300> fret

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:47.540 
to come up on the fifth and seventh fret

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:57.220 
to come up on the fifth and seventh fret
and<00:00:54.760> when<00:00:55.760> you<00:00:55.850> build<00:00:56.090> that<00:00:56.270> around<00:00:56.720> the<00:00:56.870> chord

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:57.230 
and when you build that around the chord

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.500 
and when you build that around the chord
with<00:00:57.860> the<00:00:58.370> kind<00:00:58.760> of<00:00:58.850> the<00:00:58.970> drone<00:00:59.240> of<00:00:59.420> the

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:11.170 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.750 

now<00:01:12.170> you<00:01:12.230> notice<00:01:12.620> that<00:01:12.650> when<00:01:13.310> I'm<00:01:13.430> doing<00:01:13.670> the

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:13.760 
now you notice that when I'm doing the

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.300 
now you notice that when I'm doing the
alternating<00:01:14.210> bass<00:01:14.510> since<00:01:15.470> I'm<00:01:15.650> using<00:01:15.860> a<00:01:16.070> drop

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310

D<00:01:16.520> tuning<00:01:16.550> when<00:01:17.000> I<00:01:17.060> go<00:01:17.300> to<00:01:17.360> that<00:01:17.540> G<00:01:17.870> note<00:01:18.110> on<00:01:18.350> the

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:18.860 
D tuning when I go to that G note on the

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:20.980 
D tuning when I go to that G note on the
bass<00:01:19.010> string<00:01:19.400> I<00:01:19.670> got<00:01:20.240> to<00:01:20.360> compensate<00:01:20.900> because

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
bass string I got to compensate because

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.050 
bass string I got to compensate because
I<00:01:21.260> dropped<00:01:21.530> it<00:01:21.680> a<00:01:21.740> full<00:01:21.980> step<00:01:22.280> so<00:01:22.490> my<00:01:22.670> G<00:01:22.910> is

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060 
I dropped it a full step so my G is

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:28.570 
I dropped it a full step so my G is
gonna<00:01:23.270> be<00:01:23.510> in<00:01:23.750> the<00:01:23.960> fifth<00:01:24.260> fret<00:01:26.800> and<00:01:27.800> you're

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:28.580 
gonna be in the fifth fret and you're

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:37.890 
gonna be in the fifth fret and you're
gonna<00:01:28.670> play<00:01:28.880> the<00:01:29.030> melody<00:01:29.240> along<00:01:29.600> with<00:01:29.810> it

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:37.900 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:41.469 

and<00:01:39.369> again<00:01:40.369> I'm<00:01:40.549> building<00:01:40.880> it<00:01:41.000> right<00:01:41.150> around

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:41.479 
and again I'm building it right around

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:44.200 
and again I'm building it right around
the<00:01:41.600> court<00:01:41.979> the<00:01:42.979> second<00:01:43.430> part<00:01:43.640> of<00:01:43.729> the<00:01:43.820> second

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.450 
and beyond the seventh fret and I'm
actually<00:01:51.810> striking<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:52.680> second<00:01:53.100> and<00:01:53.250> third

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
actually striking the second and third

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.000 
actually striking the second and third
string<00:01:53.790> to<00:01:53.970> make<00:01:54.090> a<00:01:54.120> little<00:01:54.330> harmony<00:01:54.630> note

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:58.010 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:00.940 

and<00:01:58.550> I'm<00:01:58.640> using<00:01:58.880> two<00:01:59.330> fingers<00:02:00.080> on<00:02:00.560> the<00:02:00.620> right

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
and I'm using two fingers on the right

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.219 
and I'm using two fingers on the right
hand<00:02:01.370> to<00:02:01.550> play<00:02:01.730> that

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:05.229 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:10.100 

than<00:02:05.710> the<00:02:05.890> no<00:02:06.039> not<00:02:06.250> one<00:02:06.460> answer

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.480 

it's<00:02:10.470> back<00:02:10.650> down<00:02:10.830> to<00:02:10.979> four<00:02:11.160> the<00:02:11.250> first

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:11.490 
it's back down to four the first

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:14.270 
it's back down to four the first
position<00:02:12.030> of<00:02:12.180> the<00:02:12.240> D<00:02:12.450> chord<00:02:12.690> so<00:02:13.650> this<00:02:13.980> is<00:02:14.130> how

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
position of the D chord so this is how

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:30.740 
position of the D chord so this is how
it's<00:02:14.400> gonna<00:02:14.520> come<00:02:14.790> out

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.590

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
know the the alternate inversions or the

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:40.770 
know the the alternate inversions or the
alternate<00:02:39.430> chord<00:02:39.670> positions<00:02:40.210> for<00:02:40.480> the<00:02:40.570> same

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
alternate chord positions for the same

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.470 
alternate chord positions for the same
chord<00:02:41.050> because<00:02:41.170> I'm<00:02:41.350> using<00:02:41.560> a<00:02:41.740> D<00:02:41.920> chord<00:02:42.130> here

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
melody and to kind of keep it flowing

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.839 
melody and to kind of keep it flowing
you<00:02:50.530> can<00:02:50.680> add<00:02:50.830> a<00:02:50.860> little<00:02:51.099> extra<00:02:51.250> licks<00:02:51.640> and

you can add a little extra licks and
what<00:02:51.970> kind<00:02:52.150> of<00:02:52.180> go<00:02:52.300> into<00:02:52.450> some<00:02:53.129> enhancements

00:02:54.119 --> 00:02:54.129 
what kind of go into some enhancements

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:56.729
