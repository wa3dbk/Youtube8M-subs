that<00:00:17.279> Cody's<00:00:18.210> a<00:00:18.330> no<00:00:18.630> skill<00:00:19.230> game<00:00:19.710> and<00:00:20.150> I

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
that Cody's a no skill game and I

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.330 
that Cody's a no skill game and I
disagree<00:00:21.689> with<00:00:21.840> that<00:00:21.869> because<00:00:22.109> a<00:00:22.470> skill<00:00:23.039> is

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
disagree with that because a skill is

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.550 
disagree with that because a skill is
something<00:00:23.910> that<00:00:24.359> you<00:00:24.660> are<00:00:24.689> good<00:00:25.170> at<00:00:25.199> not

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
something that you are good at not

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.220 
something that you are good at not
necessarily<00:00:26.310> Webber<00:00:27.060> again<00:00:27.150> takes<00:00:27.779> skill<00:00:28.140> or

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
necessarily Webber again takes skill or

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.259 
necessarily Webber again takes skill or
not<00:00:28.380> so<00:00:28.800> maybe<00:00:29.369> that's<00:00:29.609> putting<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.060> wrong

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
not so maybe that's putting the wrong

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.900 
not so maybe that's putting the wrong
way<00:00:30.480> is<00:00:30.869> it<00:00:31.050> a<00:00:31.109> hard<00:00:31.349> game<00:00:31.560> not<00:00:32.279> really<00:00:32.309> no<00:00:32.610> it's

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
way is it a hard game not really no it's

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.180 
way is it a hard game not really no it's
easy<00:00:33.059> to<00:00:33.270> pick<00:00:33.420> up<00:00:33.570> and<00:00:33.750> it's<00:00:33.930> easy<00:00:34.140> to<00:00:35.040> get

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190

relax<00:01:44.070> a<00:01:44.189> bit<00:01:44.310> more<00:01:44.490> and<00:01:44.700> I'm<00:01:45.000> getting<00:01:45.270> better

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
relax a bit more and I'm getting better

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.530 
relax a bit more and I'm getting better
so<00:01:46.560> people<00:01:46.860> say<00:01:46.950> it's<00:01:47.070> a<00:01:47.130> no<00:01:47.280> skill<00:01:47.579> gear<00:01:47.850> and

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
like I said I disagree with that because

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.249 
like I said I disagree with that because
it<00:01:50.759> just<00:01:50.909> takes<00:01:51.210> some<00:01:51.420> amount<00:01:51.750> of<00:01:51.810> skill<00:01:52.049> man<00:01:52.229> i

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
it just takes some amount of skill man i

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:53.870

mean<00:01:52.470> like<00:01:52.680> i<00:01:52.710> said<00:01:53.009> is<00:01:53.130> easier<00:01:53.460> pick<00:01:53.610> up<00:01:53.729> it

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
mean like i said is easier pick up it

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.959 
mean like i said is easier pick up it
always<00:01:54.000> will<00:01:54.270> but<00:01:54.450> and<00:01:55.100> any<00:01:56.100> player<00:01:56.399> can<00:01:56.640> pick

what<00:02:49.000> the<00:02:49.090> talking<00:02:49.450> about<00:02:49.570> I<00:02:49.750> mean<00:02:50.110> is<00:02:50.550> it's<00:02:51.550> a

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:51.820 
what the talking about I mean is it's a

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:54.210 
what the talking about I mean is it's a
bit<00:02:52.120> of<00:02:52.239> a<00:02:52.330> bull<00:02:52.630> kind<00:02:53.350> of<00:02:53.470> game<00:02:53.650> because<00:02:54.010> you

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
bit of a bull kind of game because you

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:55.440 
bit of a bull kind of game because you
just<00:02:54.370> run<00:02:54.610> around<00:02:54.700> like<00:02:55.000> a<00:02:55.060> headless<00:02:55.180> chicken

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
just run around like a headless chicken

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.630 
just run around like a headless chicken
you<00:02:56.230> don't<00:02:56.410> need<00:02:56.530> strategies<00:02:56.920> all<00:02:57.250> that<00:02:57.459> much

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
you don't need strategies all that much

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.610 
you don't need strategies all that much
and<00:02:57.910> I<00:02:57.970> don't<00:02:58.330> know<00:02:58.870> why<00:02:59.019> people<00:02:59.050> sleep<00:02:59.530> I

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
and I don't know why people sleep I

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:00.390 
and I don't know why people sleep I
think<00:02:59.650> that<00:02:59.890> they<00:02:59.950> will<00:03:00.069> assure<00:03:00.280> a

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
think that they will assure a

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.550 
think that they will assure a
competitive<00:03:01.030> player<00:03:01.239> I<00:03:01.480> mean<00:03:02.110> you<00:03:02.260> can<00:03:02.440> roll

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
competitive player I mean you can roll

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.559 
competitive player I mean you can roll
around<00:03:02.590> like<00:03:03.100> a<00:03:03.160> headless<00:03:03.340> chicken<00:03:03.970> and<00:03:04.390> get<00:03:04.540> a

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:04.569 
around like a headless chicken and get a

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:06.300 
around like a headless chicken and get a
good<00:03:04.780> gear<00:03:05.050> like<00:03:05.320> I<00:03:05.500> pretty<00:03:05.799> much<00:03:05.890> did<00:03:06.160> this

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
good gear like I pretty much did this

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.069 
good gear like I pretty much did this
get<00:03:06.459> it<00:03:06.610> sometimes<00:03:07.120> a<00:03:07.239> war<00:03:07.420> of<00:03:07.450> thinking<00:03:07.900> about

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:08.079 
get it sometimes a war of thinking about

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:09.900 
get it sometimes a war of thinking about
it<00:03:08.230> and<00:03:08.500> I<00:03:08.799> was<00:03:08.950> using<00:03:09.160> my<00:03:09.310> headset<00:03:09.579> if<00:03:09.700> you<00:03:09.790> use

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
it and I was using my headset if you use

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:11.310 
it and I was using my headset if you use
awareness<00:03:10.299> in<00:03:10.420> this<00:03:10.540> game<00:03:10.690> by<00:03:10.810> the<00:03:10.840> one<00:03:11.019> works

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:11.320 
awareness in this game by the one works

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.500 
awareness in this game by the one works
quite<00:03:11.709> well<00:03:11.820> which<00:03:12.820> I<00:03:12.940> didn't<00:03:13.120> think<00:03:13.150> it<00:03:13.360> would

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
quite well which I didn't think it would

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:18.000 
quite well which I didn't think it would
so<00:03:14.440> yeah<00:03:14.739> it's<00:03:15.390> getting<00:03:16.680> used<00:03:17.680> to<00:03:17.829> certain

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
so yeah it's getting used to certain

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:19.410 
so yeah it's getting used to certain
aspects<00:03:18.459> of<00:03:18.549> the<00:03:18.670> game<00:03:18.700> i<00:03:18.970> guess<00:03:19.000> you<00:03:19.269> could

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.420 
aspects of the game i guess you could

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.860 
aspects of the game i guess you could
say<00:03:19.600> and<00:03:20.730> to<00:03:21.730> get<00:03:21.820> useful<00:03:22.030> certain<00:03:22.540> aspects

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
say and to get useful certain aspects

skill because know where people are on a

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.360 
skill because know where people are on a
map<00:04:09.270> where<00:04:09.600> sometimes<00:04:10.560> it<00:04:10.830> can<00:04:10.950> be<00:04:10.980> a<00:04:11.100> bit<00:04:11.250> of<00:04:11.280> a

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
clusterfuck so I don't really know how

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.670 
clusterfuck so I don't really know how
operating<00:04:14.760> the<00:04:14.850> terms<00:04:15.120> I<00:04:15.510> want<00:04:16.140> to<00:04:16.169> save<00:04:16.410> but

operating the terms I want to save but
it<00:04:16.799> does<00:04:16.950> take<00:04:17.160> some<00:04:17.640> amount<00:04:17.970> of<00:04:18.090> skill<00:04:18.329> in<00:04:19.400> not

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
it does take some amount of skill in not

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.030
