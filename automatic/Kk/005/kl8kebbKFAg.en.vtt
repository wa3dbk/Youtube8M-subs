00:00:46.029 --> 00:00:46.039 
to help you I know the there earlier

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:50.150 
to help you I know the there earlier
versions<00:00:47.039> like<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.340> 2000<00:00:48.680> 2001<00:00:49.680> versions

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
versions like the 2000 2001 versions

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.639 
versions like the 2000 2001 versions
they<00:00:50.460> had<00:00:50.640> their<00:00:50.789> own<00:00:50.820> sizing<00:00:51.510> extra<00:00:52.020> large

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
they had their own sizing extra large

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.930 
they had their own sizing extra large
with<00:00:53.070> a<00:00:54.020> would<00:00:55.020> fit<00:00:55.379> I<00:00:55.559> believe<00:00:56.100> like<00:00:56.309> a<00:00:56.340> 12<00:00:56.760> to

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
with a would fit I believe like a 12 to

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.330 
with a would fit I believe like a 12 to
13<00:00:57.449> and<00:00:57.980> a<00:00:58.980> large<00:00:59.609> would<00:01:00.539> fit<00:01:00.620> 11<00:01:01.620> or<00:01:01.739> 12<00:01:02.010> so<00:01:02.280> you

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
13 and a large would fit 11 or 12 so you

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.299 
13 and a large would fit 11 or 12 so you
can<00:01:02.550> go<00:01:02.699> based<00:01:02.940> off<00:01:03.149> that<00:01:03.180> and<00:01:03.780> then<00:01:04.680> for<00:01:05.189> the

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
can go based off that and then for the

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.820 
can go based off that and then for the
ID<00:01:06.140> for<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.170> nike<00:01:07.500> ID<00:01:07.680> retros<00:01:08.250> from<00:01:08.430> 2004<00:01:09.270> and
