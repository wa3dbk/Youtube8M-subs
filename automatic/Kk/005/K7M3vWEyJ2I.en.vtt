 hello and welcome in this video we are going to 

00:00:02.649 --> 00:00:09.100
 see how we can install the application 

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:11.560
 in spain on android iphone and 

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:14.860
 Blackberry also has a choice of 

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:16.890
 can be installed on windows or computers 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:16.890
 mac 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:22.359
 If you have already acquired the application 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:25.880
 then you must go to your email to 

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:28.820
 get the password and the link 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.859
 access to the control panel like you 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.559
 you can see like that on the screen in which 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:35.030
 you must place your mail in this part and 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:36.800
 the password that you gave 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:39.190
 Later you can change it if 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.190
 you want 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:46.090
 once achieved you are already inside and you are 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.790
 to give this option is on the platform 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:51.130
 of installation of the program in Spanish 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:55.890
 which gives you the option of being able 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:55.890
 install on an iphone or on devices 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:02.500
 no jailbreak and you also have here in 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.420
 Android and blackberry here next 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:08.860
 right we can see the option of 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:11.230
 installation on mac and windows depends 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:14.050
 for the type of program that you have 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:16.270
 acquired if you purchased for devices 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:19.410
 mobile then it will be the option of the 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:22.750
 left and if you only purchased for 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:25.720
 computers you will have to use 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:27.550
 on the platform on the right side but 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:31.030
 there is also an option in which you can 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:37.210
 Acquire both for cell phones and for 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:40.210
 computers and for the purchase of both 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:43.210
 both registers are going to have 20% of 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:45.630
 discount according to the time you want 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.630
 acquire 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:52.590
 to install the application you must have 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:55.189
 physical access to the cell phone is the only 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:59.100
 way to do it you can not do 

00:01:55.189 --> 00:02:01.560
 sending a text message or sending 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:05.039
 an email or by bluetooth none of 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:07.799
 those options you can do the 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:11.670
 installation only if you have access 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:14.519
 to the system or to the mobile device to 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:18.060
 get all the benefits or all the 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:21.090
 records that the program makes 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:25.049
 social network messages see the 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:26.489
 emails and other functions plus the cell phone 

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:31.019
 if it is with operating system 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:34.830
 android this must be done root or 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:36.709
 be superuser to install on iphone 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:39.360
 you have to be jailbroken 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:41.549
 there is also an option to be able to do 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:44.579
 without doing jailbreak but you will have 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:46.850
 much more basic functions than 

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:49.850
 first option 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:52.820
 in blackberry you have to see the option or 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:55.730
 Not every blackberry is compatible 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:57.680
 this program well it is very easy to 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:00.350
 do suppose that you are going to install in 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.780
 an iphone and what we are going to do is 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:06.670
 give it here to proceed in which we are going 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:09.890
 to leave this page in which you have 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:13.370
 step by step images how to do the 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:15.800
 installation is very simple if you can not 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:18.980
 do it just delete the 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:23.360
 application and you go back to do it 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:26.450
 there are only three steps to enter the 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.600
 download link of the application that 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:32.060
 is 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:35.920
 this link this is the link for 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:38.750
 for iphone well this part is 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:41.480
 important this the last thing that is going to 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:43.989
 leave on a cell phone where you get the 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:47.209
 option to hide or leave 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:48.790
 permanently visual the application or 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:51.200
 the icon of the application on the cell phone 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:53.060
 and you have to agree here 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:57.500
 you have to choose if you are going to 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:04:00.470
 use in order to control the 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:03.590
 use of that cell phone of your children or your 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:06.530
 employees but here gives you the option this 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:08.590
 it's like an exhortation that the 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:13.040
 application should not be used to 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:14.930
 negative purposes let's say so 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:18.169
 well once you give it to proceed 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:21.799
 continue here he will ask you the 

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:27.080
 activation and you will pass in step 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:29.360
 number 3 you're going to get your or your code 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:32.870
 license to proceed to do the 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:35.210
 activation then what are you going to give 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:37.990
 nothing else here to proceed and you're going to 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:39.510
 leave the code in which 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:41.910
 is to enter 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:44.340
 and in this part you will get the code in 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:47.190
 which you must enter into that 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:51.270
 box that asks you that would be all for 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:53.880
 in iphone cell installation now 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:57.720
 going back in the option of 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:05:01.050
 installation for android we will see that 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:04.910
 it's almost the same it's very much like it 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:09.150
 what changes is the download link 

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:11.190
 that you must place in the browser of the 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:14.520
 cell phone and be able to download it on 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:16.590
 installer this is the link you see there 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:19.470
 and you are going to follow the same procedure 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:21.200
 that here tells you step by step in 

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:24.090
 reality are only three steps 

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:27.660

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:36.050
 rooted accept 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:38.889
 what requested issues of appeal and permission 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:41.650
 the superuser and place 

00:05:38.889 --> 00:05:44.110
 the license that's all and in the end it 

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:46.419
 You are also going to give the 

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:48.999
 option to hide the application 

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:51.729
 so that you can not visualize inside 

00:05:48.999 --> 00:05:54.969
 from that cell that you're on 

00:05:51.729 --> 00:05:57.759
 trying to monitor well now 

00:05:54.969 --> 00:05:59.360
 let's see the installation option in 

00:05:57.759 --> 00:06:02.910
 blackberry 

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:06.960

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:09.509
 is compatible with this application 

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:11.950
 here you will give in the case that 

00:06:09.509 --> 00:06:16.520

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:19.039

 program and be able to activate it previously 

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:45.199
