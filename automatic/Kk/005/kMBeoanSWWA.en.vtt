to 2020 and then we are operating the
system<00:01:18.750> since<00:01:19.670> starting<00:01:20.670> on<00:01:20.790> 2015<00:01:22.670> 2029<00:01:24.200> so

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
system since starting on 2015 2029 so

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.440 
system since starting on 2015 2029 so
it's<00:01:25.350> almost<00:01:25.590> a<00:01:25.920> 20<00:01:26.340> year<00:01:26.490> contract<00:01:26.900> even<00:01:27.900> if

it's almost a 20 year contract even if

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.719 
it's almost a 20 year contract even if
on<00:01:30.450> a<00:01:30.509> rule<00:01:30.810> and<00:01:31.110> Hawaii<00:01:31.470> genomics<00:01:32.340> a<00:01:32.520> very

exotic and vacation place the city of
warhoon<00:01:36.689> is<00:01:37.020> actually<00:01:37.530> one<00:01:38.040> of<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.280> three

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
warhoon is actually one of the three

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.429 
warhoon is actually one of the three
most<00:01:38.820> congested<00:01:39.390> towns<00:01:39.990> in<00:01:40.290> the<00:01:40.350> United

most congested towns in the United

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.149 
most congested towns in the United
States<00:01:40.860> of<00:01:41.009> America<00:01:41.549> and<00:01:42.229> maybe<00:01:43.229> just<00:01:43.649> after<00:01:44.130> a

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
States of America and maybe just after a

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.580 
States of America and maybe just after a
New<00:01:44.549> York<00:01:44.729> City

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
New York City

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.530 
New York City
so<00:01:46.979> they<00:01:47.250> really<00:01:47.580> need<00:01:49.700> this<00:01:50.700> transit<00:01:51.119> system

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
so they really need this transit system

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.999 
so they really need this transit system
the<00:01:52.200> average<00:01:52.680> evidence<00:01:54.170> usually<00:01:55.170> spend

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
the average evidence usually spend

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.030 
the average evidence usually spend
almost<00:01:56.490> three<00:01:57.090> hours<00:01:57.420> a<00:01:57.750> day<00:01:57.930> and<00:01:58.409> their<00:01:58.770> car

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
almost three hours a day and their car

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.050 
almost three hours a day and their car
driver<00:02:00.030> almost<00:02:00.930> 30<00:02:01.619> 40<00:02:02.159> miles<00:02:02.369> from<00:02:02.820> their

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
driver almost 30 40 miles from their

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.389 
driver almost 30 40 miles from their
houses<00:02:03.360> to<00:02:03.869> their<00:02:04.020> offices<00:02:04.649> and<00:02:04.860> work<00:02:05.070> place

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
houses to their offices and work place

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:08.660 
houses to their offices and work place
downtown<00:02:05.790> so<00:02:06.659> it's<00:02:06.780> really<00:02:06.930> neat<00:02:07.140> because<00:02:07.670> if

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
downtown so it's really neat because if

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.880 
downtown so it's really neat because if
you<00:02:08.910> look<00:02:09.119> at<00:02:09.300> for<00:02:09.929> a<00:02:09.959> rule<00:02:10.140> you<00:02:10.350> will<00:02:10.470> see<00:02:10.709> your

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
you look at for a rule you will see your

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.160 
you look at for a rule you will see your
rule<00:02:11.130> is<00:02:11.160> very<00:02:11.489> similar<00:02:12.000> for<00:02:12.239> example<00:02:12.270> to<00:02:12.840> our

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
rule is very similar for example to our

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:14.479 
rule is very similar for example to our
town<00:02:13.590> Genoa

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:14.489 
town Genoa

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:16.670 
town Genoa
there<00:02:14.970> is<00:02:15.090> the<00:02:15.209> mountain<00:02:15.360> on<00:02:15.720> the<00:02:15.840> back<00:02:16.020> there

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
there is the mountain on the back there

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.270 
there is the mountain on the back there
is<00:02:16.709> the<00:02:16.880> is<00:02:17.880> the<00:02:18.209> sea<00:02:18.450> of<00:02:18.480> the<00:02:18.690> ocean<00:02:19.200> from<00:02:19.530> so

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
is the is the sea of the ocean from so

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.229 
is the is the sea of the ocean from so
there<00:02:20.430> is<00:02:20.519> just<00:02:21.620> the<00:02:22.620> strip<00:02:23.550> of<00:02:23.700> land<00:02:23.910> that

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
there is just the strip of land that

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:28.310 
there is just the strip of land that
almost<00:02:24.780> four<00:02:25.200> mile<00:02:25.410> wide<00:02:25.739> and<00:02:26.160> 30<00:02:27.090> mile<00:02:27.570> long

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
almost four mile wide and 30 mile long

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.820 
almost four mile wide and 30 mile long
it's<00:02:28.680> very<00:02:28.860> proudly<00:02:29.780> so<00:02:30.810> a<00:02:31.290> lot<00:02:31.440> of<00:02:31.530> traffic

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
it's very proudly so a lot of traffic

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.660 
it's very proudly so a lot of traffic
problems<00:02:32.819> and<00:02:33.060> is<00:02:33.239> a<00:02:33.269> perfect<00:02:34.400> landscape<00:02:35.400> for

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
problems and is a perfect landscape for

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.930 
problems and is a perfect landscape for
a<00:02:35.700> metro<00:02:36.060> system<00:02:36.769> they<00:02:37.769> were<00:02:38.010> good<00:02:38.280> about<00:02:38.550> your

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
a metro system they were good about your

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.640 
a metro system they were good about your
