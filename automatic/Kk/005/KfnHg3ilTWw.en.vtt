00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:06.089
 hello everyone how is a new video 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:08.700
 which is about hair specifically about 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:11.130
 The extensions of the citi brand 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.080
 fashion I am a fan of long hair 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.210
 so I've always wanted to have the most 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.770
 long you still want this this is 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.500
 all my normal hair this is the length 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.900
 of the hair and it is veins below 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.150
 a little below the chest and always 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.710
 I have then either in the waist or by 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.780
 on top of culete where I've always 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.610
 thought about buying some extensions in 

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:32.309
 invest in what type of extensions 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:34.949
 would be good for me such and that good 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.269
 Well, I'm going to look for websites and just 

00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:38.280
 during this season that I was 

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:40.589
 looking and he had followed us up to a thousand 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:44.010
 that did not connect me to 

00:00:40.589 --> 00:00:45.449
 the people of vitis fashion espaÃ±a and me 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.289
 they said that if I wanted to collaborate with 

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:51.059
 them that sent me a being of 

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:52.679
 hair extensions so that the 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.649
 explored and the teachings of the channel 

00:00:52.679 --> 00:00:58.739
 I started to fly on opinions of the brand 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.600
 and they were all very positive opinions and 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:04.069
 I even saw a purple video by pita 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.069
 that has less hair 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.820
 of the chest and had some extensions 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.640
 Californian who got his hair 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.070
 up to the waist and it would serve 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.510
 pretty dense hair and I said okay 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.190
 he threw the pool and told them yes 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:21.780
 then after receiving the other day in 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:23.729
 house and I put a picture in instagram of the 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.810
 Extensions placed of all the 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.940
 extensions are and I will put them 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:30.050
 photos so you can see what looks better 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.050
 surely what envy 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:35.640
 it seems a shame 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:42.060
 What I liked about this brand is that 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:44.610
 They have custom color 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.920
 and I do what color to choose then what 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.890
 sent a couple of photos of my hair 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.750
 they told me it would be two tones to do 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.260
 the messages and they preferred vertical wick 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.790
 or California wicks and I preferred 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:58.380
 Californian because my tips are about 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.510
 clear that I rail different I thought that 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.490
 they would fade better at the end 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:04.830
 we are in that in a mix of dances 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.200
 Californian tones I already asked 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.520
 what happened that took two weeks 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:12.240
 entered and they said they had 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:15.030
 decided to keep seeing what color 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.170
 I would go well in the custom because no 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.720
 I can say it's the color because it 's a 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:21.690
 custom color as you see is 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.100
 pretty similar to my hair but it's 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.860
 much 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:28.530
 more green and this california does not have 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.940
 nothing or what happened to me 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:33.160
 completely 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:36.610
 but good you see that the tip is more 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:38.890
 dark that my hair but what is like that 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.390
 The truth is that is not bad 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:42.280
 I like the option of being able to 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:44.560
 customize the color I think an idea 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:47.290
 fantastic because how do you buy it for 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:50.170
 internet and already this is cheap many 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.910
 Sometimes it does not scare you and what people 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.760
 devote to this I can advise you in the 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:56.020
 color seems like a great idea and that's 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.960
 the only positive thing that I can tell you 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:01.100
 the brand with that I tell you all the 

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:05.210
 quality of the feet 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:07.760
 and if you can see it but the clip is black 

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:10.130
 and he drops the painting my boxes 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.480
 silver and this is black and I have not used it 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:13.370
 only now it has opened and I have put 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:16.250
 once 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:18.310
 This is very exaggerated and it can 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.310
 watch 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:24.640
 it's enough hair that you can see that this 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:28.530
 it is quite hair are 100 grams of 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:30.880
 hair but they look at the tips 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:35.690
 on the tips 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:38.390
 there is nothing but from the middle 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:41.180
 loses a lot of density and there are four 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:42.230
 tips and soap or even four 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:44.150
 points 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:46.310
 there is a lot of hair density that is what 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:49.640
 I've seen in some videos like that of 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:51.200
 pita surely I will go well 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:54.140
 I tried them 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:56.720
 and the same result of the photo is made 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:59.180
 well these four hairs at the end of the 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:01.640
 hair in density you can see that they are 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:03.709
 very transparent is that look at the 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:06.080
 points is that the risks are four 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:07.519
 tips I know I have the haircut 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:09.709
 straight then if I had it 

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:11.599
 stepped would melt much better 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:14.660
 and they would be much better but it is that 

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:17.810
 there are four points is that it is fatal not 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:20.359
 nothing is blurred with the hair and it is very 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:23.120
 little volume are 100 grams this is very 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:25.100
 very little the micro little me 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:27.979
 personally I need more volume of 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:30.590
 hair would need 200 grams as they are 

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:32.000
 of hair woman and all this and also those 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:33.800
 extensions that when one speaks well of 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.780
 it is because the same amount of 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:38.210
 Caicos hair and da is the same amount 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:39.889
 what is on the tip and here the same 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:41.990
 density that you see cooked is not the same 

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:44.780
 of city that is in the tip I am going to 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:47.750
 teach how I put them so you can see 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:50.210
 camera the very bad effect that they give is 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:51.470
 that we really perceive I was super 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:53.690
 Excited because I've been wanting 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:55.639
 extensions a lot of time them that 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:57.680
 It is so poor but 

00:04:55.639 --> 00:05:01.139
 really poor 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:03.749
 the hair several times 

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:07.610
 in the first as low as possible and the 

00:05:03.749 --> 00:05:07.610
 low when a 73 

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:15.210
 yes it is true that many sets come 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:17.920
 long comes 2 of 4 2 of 3 I think and 4 of 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:21.080
 one thing that the truth is that it comes 

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:24.550
 As a quantity there are enough strips to 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:24.550
 the tail of four clips 

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:29.400
 the one with three clips 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:35.270
 and what I do is paint the one with the 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:38.460
 another to put two strips in one 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:40.710
 thus they are hooked to each other and 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:43.950
 now I put the four clips in the 

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:45.300
 part above a little bit not by 

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:47.480
 above the ears but a little bit 

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:47.480
 under 

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:57.310
 one of a full-length clip on the neck 

00:05:54.530 --> 00:06:02.470
 click on totally in the lower part 

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:02.470
 above the ear 

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:06.420
 it would be all hair 

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:13.980
 it also diffuses but this little amount 

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:18.650
 of hair 

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:18.650
 it's useless but nothing 

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:33.090
 and the quality of the hair itself is not bad 

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:36.060
 but neither is the quality of 

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:39.870
 the affa of how they are made is not 

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:42.240
 excellent for me the only positive thing is 

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:45.660
 that have been able to get a pretty color 

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:48.390
 similar to mine and good up here is my 

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:50.610
 opinion if any of you dare 

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:54.150
 to buy them are at the link in the box 

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:56.720
 of training let's go I tell you that I do not 

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:56.720
 I bought them 

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:08.210
 Y 

00:07:03.569 --> 00:07:08.210
 I'm very sad before you tell me
