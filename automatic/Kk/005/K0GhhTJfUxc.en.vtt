end<00:01:03.750> two<00:01:04.350> wingnuts<00:01:04.589> to<00:01:05.070> hold<00:01:05.250> it<00:01:05.400> here<00:01:05.670> and<00:01:06.560> the

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
end two wingnuts to hold it here and the

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.390 
end two wingnuts to hold it here and the
follower<00:01:09.409> I'm<00:01:10.409> show<00:01:10.680> you<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:10.860> follower<00:01:11.280> I

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
follower I'm show you the follower I

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.929 
follower I'm show you the follower I
think<00:01:11.670> this<00:01:11.850> is<00:01:12.030> probably<00:01:12.270> cut<00:01:12.990> out<00:01:13.920> of<00:01:14.250> maybe

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
think this is probably cut out of maybe

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.880 
think this is probably cut out of maybe
a<00:01:15.060> plastic<00:01:15.720> one<00:01:16.140> those<00:01:16.259> plastic<00:01:16.680> cutting

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
a plastic one those plastic cutting

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.230 
a plastic one those plastic cutting
boards<00:01:17.220> that's<00:01:17.369> what<00:01:17.520> it<00:01:17.580> looks<00:01:17.759> like<00:01:17.909> to<00:01:18.090> me

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
boards that's what it looks like to me

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.039 
boards that's what it looks like to me
and<00:01:19.049> it's<00:01:19.200> got<00:01:19.350> a<00:01:19.409> little<00:01:20.479> thing<00:01:21.479> there<00:01:21.750> for

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
and it's got a little thing there for

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.380 
and it's got a little thing there for
the<00:01:22.200> total<00:01:23.040> screw<00:01:23.250> to<00:01:23.400> fit<00:01:23.580> into<00:01:23.729> so<00:01:24.150> anyway

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
the total screw to fit into so anyway

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.179 
the total screw to fit into so anyway
you<00:01:24.450> put<00:01:24.659> your<00:01:24.900> when<00:01:25.740> you're<00:01:25.860> making<00:01:26.040> the

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
you put your when you're making the

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.280 
you put your when you're making the
cheese<00:01:26.430> you<00:01:26.460> take<00:01:27.210> your<00:01:27.390> curd<00:01:27.630> and<00:01:27.900> you<00:01:27.990> dry

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
cheese you take your curd and you dry

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.660 
cheese you take your curd and you dry
them<00:01:28.409> out<00:01:28.500> real<00:01:28.710> good<00:01:28.860> by<00:01:29.009> hanging<00:01:29.250> them<00:01:29.490> in<00:01:29.549> a

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
them out real good by hanging them in a

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.760 
them out real good by hanging them in a
cheesecloth<00:01:30.420> bag<00:01:30.810> and<00:01:31.110> then<00:01:31.200> you<00:01:31.229> line<00:01:31.530> this

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
cheesecloth bag and then you line this

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.850 
cheesecloth bag and then you line this
thing<00:01:31.829> with<00:01:32.159> cheesecloth<00:01:33.439> put<00:01:34.439> it<00:01:34.530> inside

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
thing with cheesecloth put it inside

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.010 
thing with cheesecloth put it inside
here<00:01:35.220> put<00:01:35.549> this<00:01:35.700> on<00:01:35.970> and<00:01:36.270> start<00:01:36.780> applying

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
here put this on and start applying

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.310 
here put this on and start applying
presser<00:01:38.150> this<00:01:39.150> has<00:01:39.299> been<00:01:39.509> Preston<00:01:39.960> out<00:01:40.049> for

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
presser this has been Preston out for

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.370 
presser this has been Preston out for
two<00:01:40.470> days<00:01:40.680> and<00:01:41.040> I<00:01:41.130> keep<00:01:41.369> adjusting<00:01:41.579> the

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
two days and I keep adjusting the

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.609 
two days and I keep adjusting the
pressure<00:01:44.899> you<00:01:45.899> know<00:01:46.020> tighter<00:01:46.290> and<00:01:46.470> tighter

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
pressure you know tighter and tighter

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.920 
pressure you know tighter and tighter
and<00:01:46.770> tighter<00:01:47.009> until<00:01:47.579> basically<00:01:48.570> there's<00:01:48.780> no

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
and tighter until basically there's no

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.340 
and tighter until basically there's no
water<00:01:49.200> to<00:01:49.470> come<00:01:49.649> out<00:01:49.829> and<00:01:50.930> we're<00:01:51.930> gonna<00:01:52.049> dry

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
water to come out and we're gonna dry

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.600 
water to come out and we're gonna dry
this<00:01:52.619> but<00:01:52.829> anyway<00:01:52.979> I<00:01:53.070> thought<00:01:53.250> I'd<00:01:53.399> show<00:01:53.579> you

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
this but anyway I thought I'd show you

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.510 
this but anyway I thought I'd show you
that<00:01:53.880> just<00:01:53.909> in<00:01:54.329> case<00:01:54.509> if<00:01:54.930> I<00:01:55.470> did<00:01:55.890> make<00:01:56.070> a<00:01:56.100> slight

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
that just in case if I did make a slight

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.789 
that just in case if I did make a slight
modification<00:01:56.759> to<00:01:57.329> this<00:01:57.570> and<00:01:57.930> I've<00:01:58.530> probably

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
modification to this and I've probably

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.800 
modification to this and I've probably
make<00:01:59.040> another<00:01:59.189> modification<00:02:00.030> I<00:02:00.119> cut<00:02:00.659> a<00:02:00.689> little

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
make another modification I cut a little

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.109 
make another modification I cut a little
notch<00:02:01.049> here<00:02:01.890> I<00:02:02.130> probably<00:02:02.430> need<00:02:02.640> to<00:02:02.759> expand

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
notch here I probably need to expand

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:04.550 
notch here I probably need to expand
that<00:02:03.149> in<00:02:03.540> the<00:02:03.659> bottom<00:02:04.020> because<00:02:04.170> what<00:02:04.439> was

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
that in the bottom because what was

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.260
