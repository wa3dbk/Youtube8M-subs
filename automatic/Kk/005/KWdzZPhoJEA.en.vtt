and<00:00:04.500> this<00:00:04.799> week<00:00:04.980> I'm<00:00:05.160> going<00:00:05.430> to<00:00:05.490> be<00:00:05.609> working<00:00:05.790> on

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
and this week I'm going to be working on

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.570 
and this week I'm going to be working on
rendering<00:00:06.450> in-game<00:00:06.990> text<00:00:07.440> I'm<00:00:08.220> going<00:00:08.400> to<00:00:08.490> be

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
rendering in-game text I'm going to be

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:09.709 
rendering in-game text I'm going to be
doing<00:00:08.760> this<00:00:08.880> without<00:00:09.120> using<00:00:09.330> any<00:00:09.630> extra

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
doing this without using any extra

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:11.509 
doing this without using any extra
libraries<00:00:10.530> or<00:00:10.679> other<00:00:10.710> thing<00:00:11.010> I<00:00:11.130> like<00:00:11.309> to<00:00:11.400> do

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
libraries or other thing I like to do

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.450 
libraries or other thing I like to do
everything<00:00:11.940> from<00:00:12.120> scratch<00:00:12.330> as<00:00:12.809> you<00:00:13.170> know<00:00:13.469> so

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
everything from scratch as you know so

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.630 
everything from scratch as you know so
yeah<00:00:14.670> let's<00:00:15.030> get<00:00:15.240> on<00:00:15.450> with<00:00:15.480> the<00:00:15.719> show<00:00:16.430> before<00:00:17.430> I

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
yeah let's get on with the show before I

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.310 
yeah let's get on with the show before I
can<00:00:17.820> start<00:00:18.090> work<00:00:18.240> on<00:00:18.420> the<00:00:18.539> text<00:00:18.810> rendering<00:00:19.230> and

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
can start work on the text rendering and

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.410 
can start work on the text rendering and
I<00:00:19.350> had<00:00:19.529> to<00:00:19.619> just<00:00:19.859> tidy<00:00:20.220> up<00:00:20.310> one<00:00:20.580> loose<00:00:20.789> end<00:00:20.970> from

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
I had to just tidy up one loose end from

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.300 
I had to just tidy up one loose end from
last<00:00:21.689> week<00:00:21.900> which<00:00:22.050> was<00:00:22.199> the<00:00:22.350> equip<00:00:22.800> interface

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
last week which was the equip interface

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:24.950 
last week which was the equip interface
I<00:00:23.460> can't<00:00:23.670> quite<00:00:23.850> finish<00:00:24.150> that<00:00:24.330> off<00:00:24.449> last<00:00:24.750> week

working perfectly so tomorrow I will

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.830 
working perfectly so tomorrow I will
make<00:00:32.880> a<00:00:33.030> start<00:00:33.420> on<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:33.930> text<00:00:34.410> rendering<00:00:35.840> so

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
make a start on the text rendering so

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.600 
make a start on the text rendering so
today<00:00:37.320> I've<00:00:37.469> made<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:37.770> first<00:00:38.010> steps<00:00:38.280> towards

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
today I've made the first steps towards

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.790 
today I've made the first steps towards
putting<00:00:38.820> text<00:00:39.300> on<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:39.690> screen<00:00:39.840> and<00:00:40.260> what<00:00:40.680> I've

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
putting text on the screen and what I've

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.889 
putting text on the screen and what I've
done<00:00:41.040> is<00:00:41.309> to<00:00:41.460> create<00:00:41.640> this<00:00:42.030> texture<00:00:42.629> map<00:00:42.750> of

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
done is to create this texture map of

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.510 
done is to create this texture map of
all<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.170> characters<00:00:43.649> that<00:00:43.680> I<00:00:44.070> am<00:00:44.129> going<00:00:44.340> to

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
all the characters that I am going to

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.060 
all the characters that I am going to
use<00:00:44.940> as<00:00:45.719> well<00:00:45.930> as<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.079> texture<00:00:46.500> map<00:00:46.620> I've<00:00:46.829> had

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
use as well as the texture map I've had

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.979 
use as well as the texture map I've had
to<00:00:47.160> make<00:00:47.340> this<00:00:47.550> text<00:00:47.969> file<00:00:48.239> which<00:00:48.719> holds

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
to make this text file which holds

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.900 
to make this text file which holds
positional<00:00:49.500> and<00:00:49.649> size<00:00:50.100> data<00:00:50.520> for<00:00:50.789> each

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
positional and size data for each

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.200 
positional and size data for each
character<00:00:51.420> in<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.050> texture<00:00:52.440> map<00:00:52.559> such<00:00:53.280> as<00:00:53.579> how

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
character in the texture map such as how

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.060 
character in the texture map such as how
wide<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:54.629> character<00:00:55.020> is<00:00:55.170> or<00:00:55.469> whether<00:00:55.890> it

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
wide the character is or whether it

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.770 
wide the character is or whether it
should<00:00:56.100> be<00:00:56.250> written<00:00:56.640> above<00:00:57.000> or<00:00:57.210> below<00:00:57.420> the

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
should be written above or below the

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.810 
should be written above or below the
line<00:00:58.050> and<00:00:58.379> this<00:00:58.920> is<00:00:59.070> needed<00:00:59.370> to<00:00:59.550> tell<00:00:59.789> a

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
line and this is needed to tell a

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.819 
line and this is needed to tell a
renderer<00:01:00.300> exactly<00:01:00.870> how<00:01:01.050> to<00:01:01.109> render<00:01:01.469> each

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
renderer exactly how to render each

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.719 
renderer exactly how to render each
character<00:01:03.619> before<00:01:04.619> I<00:01:04.860> can<00:01:05.100> render<00:01:05.280> any<00:01:05.610> of

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
character before I can render any of

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.460 
character before I can render any of
those<00:01:05.820> font<00:01:06.210> textures<00:01:06.600> onto<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.960> screen<00:01:07.290> I

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
those font textures onto the screen I

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.469 
those font textures onto the screen I
need<00:01:07.500> to<00:01:07.710> have<00:01:07.830> a<00:01:07.860> 2d<00:01:08.340> mesh<00:01:08.729> to<00:01:08.970> render<00:01:09.330> the

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
need to have a 2d mesh to render the

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.600 
need to have a 2d mesh to render the
textures<00:01:09.930> onto<00:01:10.380> and<00:01:11.010> that's<00:01:11.250> what<00:01:11.460> I've<00:01:11.580> got

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
textures onto and that's what I've got

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.539 
textures onto and that's what I've got
here<00:01:12.270> this<00:01:12.720> actually<00:01:12.930> says<00:01:13.380> for<00:01:13.920> no<00:01:14.310> good

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
here this actually says for no good

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.660 
here this actually says for no good

matrix<00:01:18.500> and<00:01:19.500> I'll<00:01:19.619> edit<00:01:19.770> some<00:01:20.040> text<00:01:20.340> over<00:01:20.490> this

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
matrix and I'll edit some text over this

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.249 
matrix and I'll edit some text over this
in<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:20.820> video<00:01:21.180> so<00:01:21.390> that<00:01:21.420> you<00:01:21.540> can<00:01:21.750> see<00:01:22.020> what<00:01:22.229> I

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
in the video so that you can see what I

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.310 
in the video so that you can see what I
mean<00:01:22.799> but<00:01:23.759> basically<00:01:24.119> what<00:01:24.570> I<00:01:24.600> did<00:01:24.840> today<00:01:24.990> was

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
mean but basically what I did today was

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.990 
mean but basically what I did today was
to<00:01:25.500> write<00:01:25.680> a<00:01:25.710> method<00:01:26.250> which<00:01:26.490> takes<00:01:26.790> in<00:01:26.909> a

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
to write a method which takes in a

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.910 
to write a method which takes in a
string<00:01:27.030> of<00:01:27.479> characters<00:01:27.810> as<00:01:28.259> an<00:01:28.409> input<00:01:28.710> and

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
string of characters as an input and

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.800 
string of characters as an input and
then<00:01:29.369> for<00:01:29.549> every<00:01:29.850> one<00:01:30.030> of<00:01:30.060> those<00:01:30.270> characters

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
then for every one of those characters

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.710 
then for every one of those characters
it<00:01:31.049> gets<00:01:31.290> the<00:01:31.409> ASCII<00:01:31.860> value<00:01:32.220> of<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.490> character

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:32.720 
it gets the ASCII value of the character

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.090 
it gets the ASCII value of the character
finds<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:33.810> corresponding<00:01:34.380> entry<00:01:34.770> in<00:01:34.799> the

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
finds the corresponding entry in the

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.219 
finds the corresponding entry in the
meta<00:01:35.340> file<00:01:35.670> and<00:01:35.880> then<00:01:36.299> using<00:01:36.630> that<00:01:36.659> positional

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
meta file and then using that positional

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.469 
meta file and then using that positional
and<00:01:37.409> size<00:01:37.920> date<00:01:38.280> of<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.640> letter<00:01:38.790> it<00:01:39.119> creates

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
and size date of the letter it creates

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.230

for vertices of a rectangle and this is
what<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:42.869> texture<00:01:43.320> is<00:01:43.500> going<00:01:43.649> to<00:01:43.799> be<00:01:43.860> rendered

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
what the texture is going to be rendered

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.760 
what the texture is going to be rendered
on<00:01:44.310> to<00:01:44.549> all<00:01:45.479> of<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:45.810> vertices<00:01:45.990> from<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.470> whole

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
on to all of the vertices from the whole

on to all of the vertices from the whole
text<00:01:47.159> are<00:01:47.250> then<00:01:47.369> put<00:01:47.579> together<00:01:47.729> into<00:01:48.030> one

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
text are then put together into one

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.350 
text are then put together into one
buffer<00:01:48.840> array<00:01:49.049> and<00:01:49.310> loaded<00:01:50.310> into<00:01:50.579> memory<00:01:50.970> as<00:01:51.299> a

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
buffer array and loaded into memory as a

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.710

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:52.720 
model

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.690 
model
and<00:01:52.810> that<00:01:53.350> is<00:01:53.500> what<00:01:53.770> is<00:01:53.920> being<00:01:54.130> rendered<00:01:54.400> on

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 
and that is what is being rendered on

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.620 
and that is what is being rendered on
the<00:01:54.730> screen<00:01:55.120> right<00:01:55.660> now<00:01:56.370> it<00:01:57.370> is<00:01:57.790> Thursday<00:01:58.450> and

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
the screen right now it is Thursday and

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.660 
the screen right now it is Thursday and
today<00:01:58.750> as<00:01:59.110> you<00:01:59.260> can<00:01:59.320> see<00:01:59.470> I've<00:01:59.830> read<00:02:00.160> my<00:02:00.430> first

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
today as you can see I've read my first

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.210 
today as you can see I've read my first
sentence<00:02:01.180> of<00:02:01.330> text<00:02:01.690> in<00:02:01.840> the<00:02:02.080> game<00:02:02.440> it's<00:02:03.130> a

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:03.220 
sentence of text in the game it's a

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:04.740 
sentence of text in the game it's a
quite<00:02:03.400> a<00:02:03.430> wild<00:02:03.640> today<00:02:03.910> getting<00:02:04.240> the<00:02:04.330> texture

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:04.750 
quite a wild today getting the texture

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:06.720 
quite a wild today getting the texture
coordinates<00:02:04.930> calculated<00:02:05.770> properly<00:02:06.100> but<00:02:06.550> I

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:06.730 
coordinates calculated properly but I

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:08.940 
coordinates calculated properly but I
did<00:02:06.970> finally<00:02:07.390> manage<00:02:07.900> it<00:02:08.050> and<00:02:08.229> I'm<00:02:08.800> pretty

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
did finally manage it and I'm pretty

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:09.960 
did finally manage it and I'm pretty
pleased<00:02:09.220> with<00:02:09.250> the<00:02:09.430> result

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
pleased with the result

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.420 
pleased with the result
so<00:02:10.570> now<00:02:11.080> I<00:02:11.110> just<00:02:11.320> need<00:02:11.590> to<00:02:11.650> go<00:02:11.830> on<00:02:11.950> and<00:02:12.190> add

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
so now I just need to go on and add

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.430 
so now I just need to go on and add
support<00:02:12.910> for<00:02:13.000> text<00:02:13.450> that<00:02:13.630> goes<00:02:13.780> over<00:02:14.050> multiple

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
support for text that goes over multiple

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.040 
support for text that goes over multiple
lines<00:02:14.770> and<00:02:15.190> also<00:02:15.850> creates<00:02:16.210> the<00:02:16.450> option<00:02:16.840> to

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
lines and also creates the option to

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.110 
lines and also creates the option to
render<00:02:17.470> text<00:02:17.680> in<00:02:17.950> different<00:02:18.310> colors<00:02:18.940> and

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
render text in different colors and

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.790 
render text in different colors and
sizes<00:02:21.420> so<00:02:22.420> today<00:02:22.960> I've<00:02:23.080> been<00:02:23.230> finishing<00:02:23.590> off

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
sizes so today I've been finishing off

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.470 
sizes so today I've been finishing off
the<00:02:23.920> text<00:02:24.190> rendering<00:02:24.340> update<00:02:24.880> by<00:02:25.030> adding<00:02:25.390> a

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
the text rendering update by adding a

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.570 
the text rendering update by adding a
variety<00:02:26.140> of<00:02:26.170> little<00:02:26.410> features<00:02:26.950> to<00:02:27.100> the<00:02:27.190> system

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
variety of little features to the system

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.640 
variety of little features to the system
as<00:02:28.060> you<00:02:28.120> can<00:02:28.360> see<00:02:28.510> here<00:02:28.840> text<00:02:29.200> will<00:02:29.290> now<00:02:29.410> go<00:02:29.620> on

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
as you can see here text will now go on

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.560 
as you can see here text will now go on
to<00:02:29.890> the<00:02:29.920> next<00:02:30.220> line<00:02:30.430> automatically<00:02:31.300> when<00:02:31.480> it

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:31.570 
to the next line automatically when it

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:34.200 
to the next line automatically when it
reaches<00:02:31.930> a<00:02:31.960> certain<00:02:32.050> size<00:02:32.800> limit<00:02:33.280> also<00:02:33.910> I've

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:34.210 
reaches a certain size limit also I've

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:35.700 
reaches a certain size limit also I've
made<00:02:34.390> it<00:02:34.480> possible<00:02:34.660> for<00:02:34.870> text<00:02:35.200> to<00:02:35.260> be<00:02:35.350> rendered

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:35.710 
made it possible for text to be rendered

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:37.950 
made it possible for text to be rendered
now<00:02:35.830> in<00:02:36.070> different<00:02:36.550> colors<00:02:36.910> and<00:02:37.060> sizes<00:02:37.570> and

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:37.960 
now in different colors and sizes and

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.990 
now in different colors and sizes and
you<00:02:38.500> can<00:02:38.620> see<00:02:38.770> a<00:02:38.800> couple<00:02:39.100> of<00:02:39.130> examples<00:02:39.250> of<00:02:39.820> that

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
you can see a couple of examples of that

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.970 
you can see a couple of examples of that
here<00:02:40.450> so<00:02:41.140> that's<00:02:41.260> pretty<00:02:41.470> much<00:02:41.560> it<00:02:41.650> for<00:02:41.800> the

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
here so that's pretty much it for the

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.470 
here so that's pretty much it for the
text<00:02:42.220> rendering<00:02:42.400> tomorrow<00:02:42.970> I'm<00:02:43.150> probably

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
text rendering tomorrow I'm probably

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.090 
text rendering tomorrow I'm probably
gonna<00:02:43.780> have<00:02:43.960> to<00:02:44.080> do<00:02:44.260> a<00:02:44.290> couple<00:02:44.770> of<00:02:44.860> little

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:45.100 
gonna have to do a couple of little

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.970 
gonna have to do a couple of little
optimising<00:02:46.060> updates<00:02:46.630> but<00:02:47.290> the<00:02:47.470> main<00:02:47.620> features

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
optimising updates but the main features

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.130 
optimising updates but the main features
of<00:02:48.010> the<00:02:48.340> text<00:02:48.520> system<00:02:48.850> are<00:02:49.240> now<00:02:49.480> all<00:02:49.750> done<00:02:50.550> and

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
of the text system are now all done and

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.810 
of the text system are now all done and
that<00:02:53.140> is<00:02:53.380> pretty<00:02:53.740> much<00:02:53.950> it<00:02:54.220> for<00:02:54.250> this<00:02:54.550> week

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:54.820

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
today I just did a few bug fixes and

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.620 
today I just did a few bug fixes and
optimizations<00:02:57.370> so<00:02:57.550> nothing<00:02:57.970> really<00:02:58.330> to

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
optimizations so nothing really to

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:00.720 
optimizations so nothing really to
report<00:02:58.660> there<00:02:59.380> so<00:03:00.010> thank<00:03:00.220> you<00:03:00.280> very<00:03:00.459> much<00:03:00.640> for
