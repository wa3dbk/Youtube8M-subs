00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 hello in regular regularity I will 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:06.240
 from colleagues but also from friends 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.799
 asked what you as external 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.990
 data was supposed to grow 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.550
 external data grab that means one 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.740
 external hard drive on the one to 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.389
 example backup can save or 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.250
 also outsource the movies collection 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.140
 if anything else so external 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.990
 basically want to have saved 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.990
 There are 3.5 times to distinguish here 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.010
 inch hard drives and 2 5-inch 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.830
 festplatten 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.929
 that is why in this 3.5 inches 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.340
 hard drive housing quite normal desktop 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.200
 disks are in there we are 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.550
 energy-hungry people have it as well 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.219
 the possibility to save more data 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.629
 that's up to six terabytes and 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.680
 But they are also a bit bumpy 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.000
 more sensitive that is if the 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.320
 upset are the 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.020
 mostly there and a fall for the 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.360
 Data recovery alternatives are these 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.920
 two and a half inch hard disks things that 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.230
 are quite normal notebook hard drives 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.489
 and plastic houses that are 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.649
 much more economical 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.420
 energy requirements are encountered 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.640
 sensitive for the most part so natural 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.480
 do not be on the way somehow 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.590
 desk small while you look at it 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.379
 used but are simply one 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.360
 a bit more robust as far as that goes 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:08.310
 you have your data density that is you 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.299
 that gives you up to two terabytes 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.920
 time to buy 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.570
 if you have such an external hard drive 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.509
 always buys one with one buys 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.340
 usb 3 connection because that it is essential 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.930
 faster than usb 2 and that avenges itself 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.360
 even if your laptop computer is currently 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.740
 still no usb 3 connection has if you 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.659
 you buy an old hard disk 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.369
 now somehow 23 euros less costs 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.720
 and her then sometime new calculator from 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.030
 and then still at a snail's pace 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.259
 there is shoveling because if you 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.610
 there are just two or six terabytes 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.990
 goes up or down 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:38.100
 that lasts for hours even with usb 3 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.110
 important to mention is that if 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.340
 you only usb 2 on the computer you have 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.530
 watch out for these two and a half 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.409
 inch hard drives need more power than 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.000
 Usb 2.0 usually has earlier 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.610
 you look at such so-called y 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.680
 cable helped where two usb ports in 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.119
 laptop used or computer to 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.219
 to provide enough power 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.750
 you can barely see that today 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:59.430
 it rarely happens that somehow 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.219
 the mainboards take damage 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.570
 the calculator if so a usb 2.0 external 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:05.100
 hard disk was connected 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.479
 because she pulled too much electricity 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.830
 but sometimes they take too 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.210
 Hard disks then permanently damage 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:11.190
 are not a constant clean 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:12.990
 get power supply from therefore 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.940
 my advice if you have this two and a half inches 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.440
 hard drives use only usb 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.470
 supplied with electricity 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:21.210
 take usb3 disks and usb 3 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.490
 Connections also on your computer 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:24.930
 at sp 3 provides significantly more power 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:25.950
 ready as usb 2 so not only 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.630
 faster but also has more electricity 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.460
 precisely for the reason that one 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.170
 observed at this usb committee 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:33.210
 that the current is not enough 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.100
 hard disks and therefore at 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:36.720
 this upgrade from usb 2 to usd 3 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.350
 Keep more electricity was provided for 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.310
 the plates yes what else is there 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:42.660
 determine it is so that if you 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.250
 So these hard drives are buying 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:47.220
 example, a presidential western 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.430
 digital my passport ultra and this too 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.660
 mainly to go now 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.830
 because you have what benchmark 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.780
 and one determines whether the 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.220
 totally fast the next one totally slow 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.050
 and then there is somehow the war 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.010
 Worth that's all nonsense 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.600
 because you do not know what kind of one 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.520
 hard disk in this housing is in it 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.810
 you buy a product where 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.320
 be different hard drives in it 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.760
 can 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:07.620
 I can show this here 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.600
 sum yourself equip housing there can 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.130
 you can do it and there you see it 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:14.010
 real firmer is back in and now 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:15.480
 he gets what to see what ye so without 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.060
 do not see and the nameplate 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.380
 this hard drive and there you see something 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.720
 for a hard drive in it and then 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:24.110
 is it any different variants 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:26.670
 5400 turn two 7,200 turns 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:28.410
 newer model older model what for 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:30.390
 cluster sizes and so on and so forth 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:32.010
 You will not experience all that if you 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:33.180
 you so a finished external hard drive 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.530
 buys because the manufacturer in the 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.030
 want what you have in stock 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.440
 And there is one, of course 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.820
 fluctuation times are fast disks 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.400
 in there are slow hard disks in it 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:44.040
 yes, what does that mean in practice? 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.720
 Mine is mostly of everyone 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.640
 Provider two different lines one 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:49.050
 cheap ones are included in an expensive line 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.510
 this two and a half inches external 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:53.880
 For example, we're going to hard drive that 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:56.310
 western digital my passport ultra or 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:59.010
 just the western digital digital 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.360
 elements port table as cheap 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:02.670
 Variant at these two and a half inches 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:05.130
 drives are officially absent 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:06.720
 Datasheet encryption and backup 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:08.970
 and other clique bund the software 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.989
 the cheap variant but mine 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:11.400
 observation is that also the 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:13.200
 Hard disks are usually a bit faster 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.910
 are in the better line 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.040
 that is pure 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:18.570
 observation of me that is not 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.800
 empirically somehow big 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:21.750
 just like what i have watched and 

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:23.820
 the housing are also mostly in the 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:25.200
 better lines tick robust why 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.730
 I would always advise the better 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.230
 line to buy, especially if you have them 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:29.700
 so brakes for example mostly buy 

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:31.290
 to 34 euros are more expensive 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:32.880
 if I have the hard drive 400 euro 

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:34.770
 do not buy and dental 3 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.270
 percent more for the better housing 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:37.890
 under circumstances faster hard disk and 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:40.110
 I still have a little software 

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:42.450
 first I could put in stock 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:43.500
 always to the better line grab those 

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:45.060
 external hard drives are not available 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:47.220
 only from western digital but also to 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:49.200
 example of seagate there are the 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:50.940
 two and a half inch variants seagate 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:53.430
 Experts portable in the cheap 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:56.190
 variant and seagate backup plusport 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:58.710
 table in the better variant at the 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:00.990
 three inch drives and that is now 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:03.720
 there is an older model of seagate 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:05.190
 currently from western digital the my book 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:06.330
 that is the years ago 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:07.770
 are introduced and always new 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:09.960
 hard disks inserted again and that 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:11.820
 housing will be updated a bit but 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:14.280
 So much does not turn out to be good 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:16.170
 Variant in the 3d sphere and the digital 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:18.240
 elements desktop as the cheap 

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:21.450
 variant of seagate there is the 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:23.610
 backup plus v2 currently a good variant 

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:26.880
 and the seagate experts desktop 1 the 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:28.620
 not so good variant seal times 

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:30.660
 at this backup plus for example too 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:32.850
 Differences in the one variant 

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:34.620
 that could be even more model 1 then 

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:36.360
 you then according to the connection here 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:38.070
 change that is the usb connection in 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:40.050
 the power supply connection respectively 

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:40.680
 firewire and what they offered there 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:42.180
 I have it 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:44.820
 bolt was also so superior to that 

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:46.590
 Apple users were baptized that is 

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:48.990
 you had the hard drive plus the 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:50.700
 adapter to usb firewire whatever 

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:52.050
 and could as cheerfully back and forth Tauss 

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:54.750
 that means you could get a cheap one 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:56.430
 buy usb 3.0 hard disk and one 

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:57.690
 firewire 800 from there and then could 

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:58.350
 happy all the hard drives because on it 

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:00.300
 docking 

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:02.760
 yes, unfortunately, that's not why 

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:04.290
 which has now been saved in the v2 

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:05.340
 I do not know the woman much though 

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:08.850
 cheaper built 

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:10.800
 I can not say that in the meantime 

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:11.940
 but interesting history so 

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:13.110
 if you somehow used 

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:17.460
 hard disks is there I think is one 

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:20.640
 real buy tip this backup + v 1 and 

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:22.140
 otherwise if you buy something 

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:23.610
 and you do not have that big one 

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:25.470
 I would give you this my conferences 

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:26.100
 passport ultrahd from western digital ans 

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:27.470
 heart 

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:28.820
 because the housing is 

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:30.020
 it comes in different colors 

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:31.130
 means one can still buy more 

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:33.170
 can not tell apart 

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:36.110
 is with it then in this packing 

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:37.940
 here only a USB 3.0 cable relative 

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:39.110
 short unfortunately that is unfortunately me 

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:40.370
 of course my laptop users again 

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:42.110
 a blessing then you have nothing for a long time 

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:43.250
 cable must carry along and the 

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:44.900
 dinger supply themselves as I said 

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:47.810
 directly from the usb port if there is one 

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:50.540
 good usb 3.0 ports speed 

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:51.920
 moderately, these are my passport ultra always 

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:54.230
 equipped with relatively good hard disks 

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:55.670
 I would be equipped by that, too 

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:58.850
 advise as I said the better variant 

00:06:55.670 --> 00:07:00.980
 to take the seagate from there I have 

00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:02.510
 only a few times I found there 

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:04.850
 the housing is not as good as here 

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:06.050
 that of western digital of the 

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:07.070
 hard disks are themselves 

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:08.480
 really not much you just know how 

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:09.880
 not exactly what you get when 

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:13.850
 you buy the things a plastic case 

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:15.620
 at the 3.5 inch drives I would 

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:16.970
 only if you really really take it 

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:18.440
 much memory needs, as I said 

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:20.780
 There are currently more than two terabytes 

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:22.669
 only in 3.5 inches and then to six 

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:24.050
 terabyte because you still have to 

00:07:22.669 --> 00:07:25.640
 an external power supply with quilting the 

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:26.690
 Things are great when they are sensitive 

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:28.640
 If you overturn it will hurt you 

00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:29.870
 therefore my recommendation if you with 

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:31.700
 takes two terabytes takes the 

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:33.200
 two and a half inch drives there you have 

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:35.990
 a lot more joy to it 

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:38.060
 yes if any questions are useful 

00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:39.290
 post the commentary otherwise 

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:40.430
 yet to gauge the left accordingly 

00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:42.740
 with her then the hard disks 

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:44.270
 also finds and we had to ask her 

00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:45.260
 I am ready for discussion 

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:47.000
 or if the other experiences made 

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:47.810
 knew that then you can 

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.410
 talk about it 

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:50.410
 Thank you so much
