00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:08.580
 here we are already on the second floor what 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:13.260
 what is left is showing the 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:16.080
 balcony where it was before has been opened it 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:19.880
 has opened and stayed in this way 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:23.550
 already with the window wide and ready 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:26.390
 where was the room of the 0 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.390
 where we are 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:33.430
 before if it has stayed it has already been already 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:37.410
 what is a bedroom a bedroom the 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:39.420
 only one that will have classes 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.629
 Y 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:47.179
 to the door and the window of heaven where 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.179
 is going to be used elsewhere 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:58.620
 the roof has been found from this 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.620
 shape in this way 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:06.530
 all the tables the sticks 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:10.130
 so you are also seeing what is already 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:13.720
 a large spacious bedroom with a 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:16.720
 wide window and a door that is 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.720
 keep going 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:27.680
 today he has retired 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:30.100
 today the wood has been removed the 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:33.460
 staircase that will give to the bachelor's 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.460
 second floor 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:39.610
 this ladder is 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.610
 it has been good 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.950
 of this part 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:04.740
 here we are 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:07.340
 here we are appreciating everything that is 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.340
 all right 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.170
 of the roof neither a if what is going to 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:16.000
 find what is going to fill the 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.000
 system of what has been done 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:26.250
 I'm pointing out this is just the sky 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:29.030
 of five eighths the thickest this the 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:34.000
 column that has been made 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:34.000
 from the entrance to the end 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.540
 so 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:42.790
 here in what can be appreciated also 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:46.140
 is the weave of irons 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.140
 the distribution of 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:51.440
 of the electrical circuit all that are 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:55.240
 the pipes the plastic pipes 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:58.740
 all are of good quality 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:01.140
 it's more like I was repeating 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:05.190
 that all the bedrooms are going to have 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:07.530
 they will have their system for their antenna 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.660
 aerial 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.980
 that are going to measure her to give here in the 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.930
 rooftop 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.300
 the main entrance but of all the 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.490
 rooms to leave 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:19.500
 online where one can plug in the 

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:21.480
 television the TV antenna and already 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.220
 we are not going to have that problem of placing 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.569
 a rabbit antenna and all those things 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:27.659
 What is it 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:29.260
 things from the past is more I want you to see 

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:32.200
 you 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:35.210
 this part of the roof that is here to 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:37.910
 the store continues contiguous 

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:41.180
 that part of that roof is finished like that 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:46.300
 this part of the roof should stay here 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:48.990
 that at the end of the filling I am 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:48.990
 JosÃ© 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:57.330
 justino marlene and it's good that you 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:59.640
 have this 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:02.520
 Take into consideration what I am 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:04.410
 suggesting that according to the comments 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:06.780
 of the neighbors if he lived in cacos 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:09.540
 month then he is saying that in 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:12.780
 this area I was quite there are times 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:14.970
 where water accumulates a lot in the 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:17.790
 ceilings and harms 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:19.709
 in this way what is really the 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:22.350
 irons and the structure and the current 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:24.110
 the roof material is therefore 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:26.810
 Must do 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:28.639
 raise all the perimeter again 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:30.770
 you are welcome 

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:34.009
 the property the 140 meters lift 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:39.349
 the whole area and make a finish of a 

00:04:34.009 --> 00:04:42.409
 roof with falls so of stern and for 

00:04:39.349 --> 00:04:44.629
 that when there are rainy seasons 

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:47.899
 of strong hurries do not affect anything the 

00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:51.469
 ceiling only that are more or less 

00:04:47.899 --> 00:04:54.169
 just as the landless has been made there 

00:04:51.469 --> 00:04:57.050
 geoss and nothing this is the recommendation 

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:59.659
 that from here is what I'm doing to 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:02.089
 that to be taken into account and look 

00:04:59.659 --> 00:05:04.489
 corrective measures while 

00:05:02.089 --> 00:05:07.119
 can do while we're around 

00:05:04.489 --> 00:05:07.119
 I'm sorry nobody 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:14.060
 otherwise here 

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:18.090
 step to say what is already filling the 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:21.440
 roof that was already a thing of the past 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:21.440
 here if you are already seeing 

00:05:46.009 --> 00:05:49.270
 and this is 

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:54.669
 seeing us all 

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:05.790
 this commitment 

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:08.449
 for everyone and we will continue 

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:11.919
 the teachers 

00:06:08.449 --> 00:06:11.919
 finalizing the details for him
