00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:03.889 

hi<00:00:01.469> there<00:00:02.240> here<00:00:03.240> I'm<00:00:03.330> gonna<00:00:03.449> show<00:00:03.540> you<00:00:03.780> a

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:03.899 
hi there here I'm gonna show you a

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:07.010 
hi there here I'm gonna show you a
couple<00:00:04.080> techniques<00:00:04.380> for<00:00:04.920> shading<00:00:05.190> in<00:00:06.020> the

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
couple techniques for shading in the

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.009 
couple techniques for shading in the
basic<00:00:07.529> idea

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.770 

is<00:00:10.379> to<00:00:10.530> get<00:00:10.679> the<00:00:10.799> dirt<00:00:10.980> to<00:00:11.190> roll<00:00:11.490> down<00:00:11.789> itself

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:13.780 
is to get the dirt to roll down itself

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:16.950 
is to get the dirt to roll down itself
you<00:00:14.380> don't<00:00:14.530> want<00:00:14.710> the<00:00:14.920> dirt<00:00:15.660> dropping<00:00:16.660> right

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:16.960 
you don't want the dirt dropping right

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:18.640 
you don't want the dirt dropping right
down

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:18.650 
down

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.340 
down
on<00:00:18.920> top<00:00:19.190> of<00:00:19.220> that<00:00:19.570> height<00:00:20.570> because<00:00:21.200> there

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:21.350 
on top of that height because there

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:24.260 
on top of that height because there
could<00:00:21.500> be<00:00:21.560> a<00:00:21.680> rock<00:00:21.980> in<00:00:22.220> there

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:24.270 
could be a rock in there

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:26.779 
could be a rock in there
and<00:00:24.660> it<00:00:24.840> might<00:00:24.960> damage<00:00:25.140> the<00:00:25.500> coating<00:00:25.680> or<00:00:26.490> worse

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
and it might damage the coating or worse

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:32.299 
and it might damage the coating or worse
would<00:00:27.090> identify<00:00:30.260> so<00:00:31.260> you<00:00:31.380> can<00:00:31.560> see<00:00:31.770> here<00:00:32.130> how

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
would identify so you can see here how

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:38.190 
would identify so you can see here how
the<00:00:32.369> dirt<00:00:32.700> just<00:00:33.030> rolls<00:00:33.420> down<00:00:33.809> itself

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:38.200 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:43.860 

relatively<00:00:39.200> gently<00:00:39.710> down<00:00:39.920> onto<00:00:40.340> the<00:00:40.430> pipe

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:43.870 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:46.250 

there's<00:00:44.500> a<00:00:44.560> couple<00:00:44.740> different<00:00:44.890> ways<00:00:45.340> to<00:00:45.610> do<00:00:45.790> it

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
there's a couple different ways to do it

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.660 
there's a couple different ways to do it
actually<00:00:47.260> both<00:00:47.410> this<00:00:47.500> rebase<00:00:47.920> it<00:00:48.130> ways<00:00:48.310> to<00:00:48.340> do

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:48.670 
actually both this rebase it ways to do

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:51.900 
actually both this rebase it ways to do
it<00:00:49.320> I'll<00:00:50.320> move<00:00:50.620> this<00:00:50.830> up<00:00:51.100> so<00:00:51.130> you<00:00:51.400> can<00:00:51.550> see<00:00:51.760> what

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:51.910 
it I'll move this up so you can see what

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:55.340 
it I'll move this up so you can see what
the<00:00:52.000> buckets<00:00:52.360> doing<00:00:52.660> now<00:00:53.340> in<00:00:54.340> the<00:00:54.790> winter<00:00:55.059> time

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
the buckets doing now in the winter time

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.010 
the buckets doing now in the winter time
the<00:00:56.350> dirts<00:00:56.590> frozen<00:00:57.130> you<00:00:57.460> can<00:00:57.489> give<00:00:57.880> it<00:00:58.030> a<00:00:58.300> flick

00:00:59.010 --> 00:00:59.020 
the dirts frozen you can give it a flick

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:03.750 
the dirts frozen you can give it a flick
like<00:00:59.290> this<00:00:59.530> it'll<00:01:00.129> break<00:01:00.340> the<00:01:00.400> crust<00:01:02.610> and<00:01:03.610> then

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:03.760 
like this it'll break the crust and then

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.109 
like this it'll break the crust and then
just<00:01:03.970> pull<00:01:04.210> it<00:01:04.360> in

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:08.119 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:11.530 

see<00:01:08.720> a<00:01:08.750> rock<00:01:09.049> grab<00:01:09.890> it<00:01:10.310> flick<00:01:11.090> it<00:01:11.119> out<00:01:11.360> of<00:01:11.479> the

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:11.540 
see a rock grab it flick it out of the

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.280 
see a rock grab it flick it out of the
way<00:01:13.119> there's<00:01:14.119> not<00:01:14.270> too<00:01:14.420> many<00:01:14.540> rocks<00:01:14.810> in<00:01:15.110> here<00:01:15.259> I

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:15.290 
way there's not too many rocks in here I

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:18.640 
way there's not too many rocks in here I
don't<00:01:15.560> think<00:01:15.799> so

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:18.650 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:23.880 

so<00:01:19.250> that's<00:01:19.430> one<00:01:19.700> technique

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:23.890 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.980 

you<00:01:24.400> always<00:01:24.520> want<00:01:24.850> to<00:01:24.909> be<00:01:25.030> pulling<00:01:25.300> it

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
you always want to be pulling it

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.340 
you always want to be pulling it
so<00:01:27.530> it<00:01:27.650> falls<00:01:27.830> down<00:01:28.159> on<00:01:28.190> itself<00:01:28.990> another<00:01:29.990> thing

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.350 
so it falls down on itself another thing

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:35.230 
so it falls down on itself another thing
you<00:01:30.500> can<00:01:30.650> do<00:01:32.200> once<00:01:33.200> your<00:01:33.409> ditches<00:01:33.590> full

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
you can do once your ditches full

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.460 
you can do once your ditches full
that<00:01:35.780> reach<00:01:36.049> back<00:01:36.350> on<00:01:36.650> it

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:38.470 
that reach back on it

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.639 
that reach back on it
drag<00:01:39.470> it<00:01:39.650> ahead

00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:42.649 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:45.800 

then<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:43.799> pipes<00:01:44.009> cover<00:01:44.399> and<00:01:45.329> you<00:01:45.509> can<00:01:45.539> grab

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
then the pipes cover and you can grab

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.580 
then the pipes cover and you can grab
the<00:01:46.049> dirt<00:01:46.259> from<00:01:46.499> here

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
the dirt from here

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.910 
the dirt from here
pull<00:01:49.010> it<00:01:49.130> on<00:01:49.250> to<00:01:50.260> what<00:01:51.260> you've<00:01:51.409> already<00:01:51.530> got

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
pull it on to what you've already got

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:57.700 
pull it on to what you've already got
covered

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:57.710 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:02.459 

and<00:01:57.980> then<00:01:58.280> again<00:01:58.550> you<00:01:58.760> can<00:01:58.870> reach<00:01:59.870> back

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:02.469 

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:05.190 

and<00:02:02.740> pull<00:02:02.950> it<00:02:03.100> ahead

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
and pull it ahead

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.070 
and pull it ahead
just<00:02:06.090> covers<00:02:07.090> up<00:02:07.180> the<00:02:07.240> pipe<00:02:07.540> nights<00:02:07.840> now

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
just covers up the pipe nights now

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.180 
just covers up the pipe nights now
that's<00:02:08.800> the<00:02:08.950> technique<00:02:09.399> more<00:02:09.729> for<00:02:10.980> if<00:02:11.980> you've

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
that's the technique more for if you've

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.400 
that's the technique more for if you've
got<00:02:12.310> a<00:02:12.340> lot<00:02:12.670> of<00:02:12.700> rock<00:02:13.060> and<00:02:13.420> stuff<00:02:13.750> and<00:02:14.230> you're

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
got a lot of rock and stuff and you're

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.380 
got a lot of rock and stuff and you're
really<00:02:14.830> worried<00:02:15.190> about<00:02:15.489> damaging<00:02:15.819> a<00:02:16.120> fight

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
really worried about damaging a fight

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.750 
really worried about damaging a fight
because<00:02:16.540> you<00:02:16.720> got<00:02:16.989> way<00:02:17.709> more<00:02:17.760> opportunity

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
because you got way more opportunity

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.920 
because you got way more opportunity
there<00:02:19.140> to<00:02:20.140> see<00:02:20.730> if<00:02:21.730> a<00:02:21.910> rock<00:02:22.120> is<00:02:22.420> gonna<00:02:22.600> fall<00:02:22.900> on

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
there to see if a rock is gonna fall on

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:28.330 
there to see if a rock is gonna fall on
fight

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.150 

this<00:02:28.879> way<00:02:29.150> know<00:02:29.360> is<00:02:29.830> basically<00:02:30.830> what<00:02:30.980> you're

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
this way know is basically what you're

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:36.520 
this way know is basically what you're
going<00:02:31.250> to<00:02:31.340> be<00:02:31.459> doing

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.380 

there's<00:02:37.010> how<00:02:37.160> much<00:02:37.340> Ross<00:02:37.610> than<00:02:37.910> this<00:02:38.060> stuff

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
there's how much Ross than this stuff

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.830 
there's how much Ross than this stuff
here

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.160 

the<00:02:41.989> difference

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
the difference

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.260 
the difference
there's<00:02:44.500> one<00:02:44.710> other<00:02:44.890> technique

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:47.270 
there's one other technique

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:48.820 
there's one other technique
that's<00:02:47.630> where<00:02:47.810> you<00:02:47.960> just<00:02:47.990> get<00:02:48.380> on<00:02:48.410> the<00:02:48.680> other

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:48.830 
that's where you just get on the other

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:51.420 
that's where you just get on the other
side<00:02:49.160> of<00:02:49.190> the<00:02:49.340> ditch<00:02:49.490> the<00:02:50.120> ditches<00:02:50.330> too<00:02:50.780> wide

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
side of the ditch the ditches too wide

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:57.040 
side of the ditch the ditches too wide
you<00:02:52.430> can't<00:02:52.730> reach<00:02:52.970> across<00:02:53.270> it<00:02:55.720> just<00:02:56.720> get<00:02:56.930> on

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.050 
you can't reach across it just get on

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:58.720 
you can't reach across it just get on
the<00:02:57.200> other<00:02:57.290> side<00:02:57.410> and<00:02:57.860> I'll<00:02:57.950> show<00:02:58.190> you<00:02:58.250> that<00:02:58.550> in

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
the other side and I'll show you that in
