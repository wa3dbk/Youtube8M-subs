I just think it's such timed out so well
of<00:00:43.950> T<00:00:44.070> on<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.280> front<00:00:44.520> and<00:00:44.820> he's<00:00:45.000> bidding<00:00:45.300> here

while<00:05:21.289> now<00:05:21.470> and<00:05:21.680> I<00:05:21.740> just<00:05:21.770> feel<00:05:21.949> my<00:05:22.159> wardrobe<00:05:22.400> is

getting<00:05:22.789> way<00:05:22.970> too<00:05:23.030> boring<00:05:23.389> so<00:05:23.720> I<00:05:24.169> thought<00:05:24.710> this

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:24.830 
getting way too boring so I thought this

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:26.770 
getting way too boring so I thought this
would<00:05:24.979> look<00:05:25.099> really<00:05:25.159> good<00:05:25.580> with<00:05:25.909> my<00:05:26.090> hair<00:05:26.330> like
