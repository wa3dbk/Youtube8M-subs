 sim cards that support smartphone 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:03.539
 and 4 gigabytes of internal memory without 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.670
 every moment let's open 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.700
 this box and on top we immediately see 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:11.670
 packed in plenochku smartphone set aside 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:15.750
 it aside here in this 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:19.080
 the bed is our smartphone further 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:21.840
 double bottom reveal it 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:25.020
 and what we see above immediately before us 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.060
 protective film appears protective 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:32.460
 film 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:35.299
 Further cover open it yes here 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.420
 the case is very interesting it is made in 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:39.240
 such 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:42.210
 I do not know pixel colors 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:45.619
 you or not i will play in the light here like 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:48.899
 would such iridescent squares 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:50.450
 like the turbo x1 smartphone which we 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:53.549
 recently unpacked 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:56.100
 here the device is mounted on this 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.960
 here is a reusable velcro here 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.689
 there is such a fold line with 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.909
 by which sticking will be possible 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:08.519
 to produce 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:09.330
 more convenient and easier you can stick not 

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:12.330
 smartphone itself 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:14.670
 But here is such a case for this case all 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:17.430
 I understand that we take the cover 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:20.190
 we take the case we paste this whole thing 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.480
 so we are putting here a smartphone that is 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.310
 any moment we can from this 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.900
 we can take out the smartphone designs 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.989
 use the smartphone in the case separately 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:32.459
 or a smartphone in a case separately without a case 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:37.790
 how will your soul go on 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:44.970
 deeper is a charger 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:46.670
 this is how we open the traditional 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:53.810
 usb charger 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:03:00.720
 light indication there are decades 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:03:03.230
 To hide it, unstick it 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.230
 small bag 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:18.040
 Here are such uncomplicated movements to 

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:18.040
 black usb cable white headphones 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:25.430
 white silicone headphones 

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:29.050
 pads such a tablet shaped 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:31.070
 form control panel 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:33.890
 remind with this key you 

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:36.020
 can answer the call or stop 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:38.840
 or start playing playing in 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:42.890
 music headphones here we have three 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:44.720
 the microphone that is you on this piece will be 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:49.000

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:51.100
 headphones as headset our battery 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.850
 first time by the way you are a turbo smartphone 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:56.270
 completely black 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:04:00.850
 as I can already see through the package 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:04.510
 here is a black stylish battery capacity 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:08.900
 1850 milliampere hours 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:10.510

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:14.330
 coupon 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:17.510
 Well, perhaps this is a complete set 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:20.930
 of our smartphone let's a lot of crevices 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:23.800
 clear the field of action for us and retrieved 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:25.760
 the smartphone itself from its bag 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:28.370
 shipping film stuck on 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:29.090
 the smartphone display here is all basic 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:32.450
 moments 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:35.150
 again described as you can see the smartphone 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:38.650
 equipped with a unique diagonal gps screen 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:42.260
 4 point sixty six hundredths of an inch 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:48.310
 screen shows hd image 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:48.310
 1280 resolution at 720 pixels 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:54.170
 as you can see the rear panel repeats 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:56.780
 cover design solution 

00:04:54.170 --> 00:05:02.330
 that is, and here and there we see flickering 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:04.940
 pixel on my wonderful so 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:08.120
 let's see our ends with you 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:08.720
 Apparently the smartphone is framed with aluminum 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:11.330
 frame 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:14.630
 such is the form of n that is here with us 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:19.100
 the frame ends and so comfortable 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:21.010
 rounding done actually on the right 

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:23.000
 butt we have a button on the smartphone 

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:26.090

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:37.400
 microusb and jack for recharging and 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:40.060
 computer connections 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:43.190

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:03.230
 5 megapixel flash and camera 

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:06.320

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:13.610
 latch hide the back cover is done 

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:17.540

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:20.630
 that we have a cover under our head for 

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:23.750

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:31.340
 such a combined slot for two 

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:34.550
 sim cards 

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:36.740
 try to show you it closer here 

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:39.550
 SIM cards are arranged like this 

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:42.020
 sandwich that is, one goes to the other 

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:43.400

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:45.530
 properly done that is to eat big 

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:48.740
 SIM card you insert 

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:53.150
 so that small micro sim card like this 

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:55.310

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:09.130
