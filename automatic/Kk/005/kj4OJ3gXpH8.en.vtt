00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:05.320
Hello!

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:09.880
I'm Burnie Burns, founder and creative director of Rooster Teeth Productions.

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:15.140
Since your last visit we moved into this state-of-the-art facility: Stage 5 in Austin, Texas

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:20.720
We've also taken steps to make sure that we have a less abusive workplace.

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:23.080
[forced fake laughter]

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.260
Okay! You look like you want to take a tour.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:27.600
Join me, won't you?

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:33.420
Oh there you are!

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.620
And this is our broadcast area where we make The Know, using our green screen

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.620
which we also use to make visual effects.

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.580
Oh hello little bird! I didn't see you there.

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:47.820
[bird chirping]

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.560
Little bird, be quiet. They're producing a show right now.

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:52.860
Quiet on the set!

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:55.240
[bird chirping]

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:57.420
And over here we have our streaming facility.

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.600
And our tech offices.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.640
And that's where Gus and Barbara sit.

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:03.240
It's a wonderful facility where everyone can be produc-

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:05.380
[muffled noise of anger]

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:07.580
Who puts a cubicle in the middle of an office building?

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:08.780
[off-camera] Are-are-are you good?

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.480
I'm fine. Camera guy messed me up; he was going too fast.

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:13.160
Let's do it again. It'll be fun.

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:15.140
Action.

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.680
And over here, we have Barbara Dunkelperson.

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.140
She's hard at work on RTX, the social event of the year.

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:23.420
It has panels

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:24.740
and parties

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.480
and all sorts of fun events for you to attend.

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.400
Last year we had over 5 million people at the convention

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.900
and this year we plan to have 10 million.

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.340
It's actually 30 thousand people.
That's incredible!

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:39.480
You did really good.

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:41.080
Don't ever correct me again.

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:42.760
Fan art wall!

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:46.240
Conference Room!

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.680
Shh! Shut up, shut up.

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.400
And here's our new motion capture facility.

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.560
This is a special move I worked up just for Red vs Blue season 13.

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.880
And now they'll add that to the show, using movie magic!
[magic echos]

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:07.160
No! I'm fine. I'm fine.

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.120
You know what makes me not relax? When you say I'm not relaxed. It makes me like, so far from relaxed.

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.980
I know I'm doing a good job. I know.

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.600
You keep saying that I'm doing a good job and it makes me think I'm not doing a good job the way you say -

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.460
I don't know. Why are we talking about it so much?

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.120
And now it's time for everybody's favorite Achievement Hunters: The Let's Players.

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.200
[knocking] Guys.

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.300
Come on guys, open the door.

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:26.060
[off camera] Burnie, I don't think they're in there.

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:27.620
[Burnie making a rucus w/the door handle]
[off camera] Burnie, just take it -

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:28.120
GUYS!

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.700
GUYS! OPEN THE GOD DAMN DOOR!

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.000
[off-camera] Burnie just calm down.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.720
Oh come on.

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.660
Alright, that's it.
[off camera] Did you just - oh wait - no - crap!

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.000
You guys like to yell?
[off camera] Burnie!

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.800
I'll make you yell. How 'bout this?

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.500
How 'bout I smoke you out of there you sons of bitches.

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:41.320
Where the fuck's the lighter?

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.340
What're you doing dude?

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:45.180
Hey guys.

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:47.860
LET ME IN THE DOOR. LET ME IN.

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.560
YOU GUYS ARE IN THERE MAKING FUN OF ME! I KNOW YOU ARE!

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.140
I just wanna play a game with you guys. That's all I ever wanna do.

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.100
You know, just kinda hang out. We could be friends.

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.260
[sounds of a struggle]

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:57.700
Gavin! Gavin. Come on.

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.060
Come away with me, Gavin.

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:00.820
We can run off; it'd just be me and you.

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:01.920
Gavin, come on let's go!

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.960
Christ.

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:06.960
There's no WAY I'm going with him.

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.160
And this is the Bungalow

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.420
where we're doing post production on our first ever feature film

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.080
Harry Potter and the Incredible Laser Beam.

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.080
You can see it in theaters out this summer!

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:27.380
Somebody get his meds!

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:35.060
