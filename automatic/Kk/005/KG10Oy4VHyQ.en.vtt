00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.389
 what's up kids are here in a 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.680
 new video and good people and I bring you 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:06.680
 a theory that occurred to me the other day 

00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:24.259
 do not 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:29.430
 Y 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:41.489
 looking at previous chapter chapters 

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:43.050
 and good to start investigating a little bit 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:47.159
 about the power stations since there is where 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:49.140
 it was revealed that if the garlic itself was possessed 

00:00:47.159 --> 00:00:51.700
 and good reporting a bit is not something 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.820
 what pluto 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:57.190
 are the planes that frank has and that in 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:59.050
 actually burned it but we do not believe that what 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.990
 I really burned, I think it's still 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:04.150
 having what the examiner is doing 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:06.880
 without that, so to speak, lutfi has 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:10.210
 access to ancestral palm has the 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:12.220
 planes and days friends say garlic and so 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:15.130
 that we need a central store here is 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:17.140
 a no and good about one I 'm not 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.660
 investigating a little bit and the word 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:23.860
 Uranus in Greek mythology was a god 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:26.619
 and it was the god that created the titans in 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:30.070
 the mythology with this we deduce that 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:31.270
 good that is good in wampis the titans 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.729
 of system are somehow the 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:36.190
 giant and if the giants really in 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:37.990
 with very powerful floors I'm looking 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:39.830
 investigate the little ones are the titans 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.110
 Y 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:45.310
 and well a suv said he wants to go to 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:48.520
 barça with the bass to know 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:52.299
 that country that island since the island of the 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:55.869
 titans and well well investigating the 

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:58.240
 titans that there are wampis I think it came to 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:00.820
 the conclusion that one of that the 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.619
 Central German can be one of one of 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:07.509
 those titans since good if society 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:09.190
 it's a giant mermaid and it may be fine 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:10.690
 good and this take me out the possibility that 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.040
 be a person since if I made jewelry 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.319
 a central wench because in a giant 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:17.890
 may sound more letters we have of 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:20.950
 ends a weapon is a physical weapon and 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:24.970
 a person of central weapon this pluton 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:28.480
 and possessed so one can not be 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:30.450
 perfectly a red I started to start 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.620
 to the order where they fit wampis and 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:35.010
 discarding if a little bit I the 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:37.880
 execution that could have been 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:41.210
 arjun yo or sanjuán world 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:45.020
 and works or archiving juniors have died 

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:47.840
 so maybe 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:51.040
 something is brought to san juan- world cheese 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:53.230
 awards is in the chorus band says 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:57.640
 and well, it really makes sense because 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:03:00.879
 so the thing would get more interesting 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:02.620
 because if you have two rules that the 

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:03.940
 main enemy that as I said have 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.280
 one 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.660
 to this mass is my theory and good the 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:10.570
 created quite possible it would be pretty 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:13.990
 well that is because a mass of 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:16.600
 work and that will level out a bit the 

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:18.460
 good thing I hope you liked the 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:21.990
 video chick and basically we put the 

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:21.990
 comments what do you think about this what 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:28.080
 what is the titan that you want us to 

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:29.340
 takes asturias and they have the giant 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.990
 that you want it to be a 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:33.450
 pot or synods and do not think that being a 

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:34.650
 giant that you think for that grain and 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:37.250
 good kid but I liked the video 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.250
 and until next time
