00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:43.900 
definitely a lot harder
I<00:01:42.319> mean<00:01:42.470> obviously<00:01:43.069> we<00:01:43.220> put<00:01:43.340> a<00:01:43.399> realistic

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:43.910 
I mean obviously we put a realistic

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:45.550 
I mean obviously we put a realistic
damage<00:01:44.270> model<00:01:44.599> you<00:01:44.720> could<00:01:44.840> say<00:01:45.020> it<00:01:45.140> be<00:01:45.229> easier

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
damage model you could say it be easier

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.190 
damage model you could say it be easier
but<00:01:45.739> really<00:01:46.280> it's<00:01:46.789> really<00:01:47.239> the<00:01:47.780> damage<00:01:48.080> is

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 
but really it's really the damage is

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.779 
but really it's really the damage is
like<00:01:48.470> a<00:01:48.500> lot<00:01:48.679> more<00:01:48.800> realistically<00:01:49.429> this<00:01:49.610> is<00:01:49.670> a

00:01:49.779 --> 00:01:49.789 
like a lot more realistically this is a

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:51.339 
like a lot more realistically this is a
lot<00:01:49.970> easier<00:01:50.390> to<00:01:50.479> take<00:01:50.630> yourself<00:01:50.720> out<00:01:51.050> the<00:01:51.170> race

00:01:51.339 --> 00:01:51.349 
lot easier to take yourself out the race

00:01:51.349 --> 00:01:53.380 
lot easier to take yourself out the race
because<00:01:51.649> you<00:01:52.009> can<00:01:52.429> see<00:01:52.610> here<00:01:52.819> diver<00:01:53.179> down

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
because you can see here diver down

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.080 
because you can see here diver down
these<00:01:53.509> are<00:01:53.569> the<00:01:53.720> Maldonado<00:01:54.200> and<00:01:54.410> this<00:01:55.039> is<00:01:55.340> my

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
these are the Maldonado and this is my

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.120 
these are the Maldonado and this is my
technique<00:01:56.630> so<00:01:56.869> far<00:01:57.020> this<00:01:57.140> is<00:01:57.289> the<00:01:57.319> only<00:01:57.500> tactic

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
technique so far this is the only tactic

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:59.410 
technique so far this is the only tactic
I<00:01:58.250> found<00:01:58.520> that<00:01:58.640> you<00:01:58.729> can<00:01:58.849> actually<00:01:58.910> retire

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
I found that you can actually retire

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.330 
I found that you can actually retire
cars<00:01:59.810> from<00:01:59.959> the<00:02:00.050> race<00:02:00.259> without<00:02:00.770> retiring

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
cars from the race without retiring

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.160 
cars from the race without retiring
yourself<00:02:01.789> from<00:02:01.940> the<00:02:02.060> race<00:02:02.209> so<00:02:02.420> basically

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
yourself from the race so basically

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.109 
yourself from the race so basically
parking<00:02:03.800> at<00:02:03.890> the<00:02:03.920> hairpin<00:02:04.340> at<00:02:04.459> Monaco<00:02:04.879> you<00:02:05.000> can

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119 
parking at the hairpin at Monaco you can

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:06.699 
parking at the hairpin at Monaco you can
see<00:02:05.300> here<00:02:05.509> make<00:02:05.929> sure<00:02:06.080> there's<00:02:06.229> another<00:02:06.440> AI

00:02:06.699 --> 00:02:06.709 
see here make sure there's another AI

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:08.820 
see here make sure there's another AI
car<00:02:07.160> with<00:02:07.489> you<00:02:07.729> and<00:02:07.910> it<00:02:08.390> will<00:02:08.479> tell<00:02:08.629> you<00:02:08.750> to

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
car with you and it will tell you to

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:10.779 
car with you and it will tell you to
start<00:02:09.830> moving<00:02:10.009> because<00:02:10.340> you<00:02:10.429> know<00:02:10.640> you're

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
start moving because you know you're

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:12.369 
start moving because you know you're
blocking<00:02:11.540> the<00:02:11.599> track<00:02:11.810> whatever<00:02:12.050> you've<00:02:12.260> got

00:02:12.369 --> 00:02:12.379 
blocking the track whatever you've got

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:14.260 
blocking the track whatever you've got
to<00:02:12.470> get<00:02:12.560> moving<00:02:12.920> so<00:02:13.099> just<00:02:13.580> reverse<00:02:13.819> back<00:02:14.090> and

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:14.270 
to get moving so just reverse back and

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:15.729 
to get moving so just reverse back and
forth<00:02:14.510> and<00:02:14.720> that<00:02:14.780> should<00:02:14.989> retire<00:02:15.290> a<00:02:15.349> couple<00:02:15.680> of

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:15.739 
forth and that should retire a couple of

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:18.880 
forth and that should retire a couple of
cars<00:02:15.920> can<00:02:16.130> see<00:02:16.250> you<00:02:16.310> down<00:02:16.490> to<00:02:16.610> 15<00:02:16.970> 14<00:02:17.570> 13<00:02:17.890> cars

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
cars can see you down to 15 14 13 cars

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.730 
cars can see you down to 15 14 13 cars
now<00:02:19.300> so<00:02:20.300> it's<00:02:20.600> it's<00:02:20.870> off<00:02:21.020> work<00:02:21.260> I<00:02:21.470> mean

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:21.740 
now so it's it's off work I mean

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:23.350 
now so it's it's off work I mean
it's<00:02:22.010> not<00:02:22.130> a<00:02:22.160> solves<00:02:22.460> way<00:02:22.970> that<00:02:23.180> a<00:02:23.210> lot<00:02:23.330> of

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
it's not a solves way that a lot of

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.240 
it's not a solves way that a lot of
people<00:02:23.570> wanted<00:02:23.900> you<00:02:24.020> want<00:02:24.170> to<00:02:24.260> sort<00:02:24.620> of<00:02:24.710> crash

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
people wanted you want to sort of crash

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:26.440 
people wanted you want to sort of crash
people<00:02:25.550> out<00:02:25.640> the<00:02:25.730> race<00:02:25.850> that's<00:02:26.090> held<00:02:26.300> that

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
people out the race that's held that

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.060 
people out the race that's held that
sort<00:02:26.720> of<00:02:26.780> challenge<00:02:27.080> goes<00:02:27.290> in<00:02:27.440> the<00:02:27.500> past<00:02:27.740> but

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:28.070 
sort of challenge goes in the past but

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:29.860 
sort of challenge goes in the past but
in<00:02:28.730> this<00:02:28.880> game<00:02:29.060> it<00:02:29.180> doesn't<00:02:29.330> seem<00:02:29.570> like<00:02:29.720> it<00:02:29.840> is

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
in this game it doesn't seem like it is

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.330 
in this game it doesn't seem like it is
possible<00:02:30.350> you<00:02:30.680> can<00:02:30.800> see<00:02:31.010> that<00:02:31.160> I<00:02:31.190> got

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
possible you can see that I got

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.610 
possible you can see that I got
disqualified<00:02:31.640> so<00:02:32.180> that<00:02:32.810> was<00:02:32.960> rewinds<00:02:33.410> and<00:02:33.530> I

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
disqualified so that was rewinds and I

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.340 
disqualified so that was rewinds and I
trying<00:02:33.920> to<00:02:34.100> do<00:02:34.220> it<00:02:34.310> again<00:02:34.370> you<00:02:34.640> can<00:02:34.730> see<00:02:34.880> here

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
trying to do it again you can see here

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.480 
trying to do it again you can see here
they<00:02:36.350> had<00:02:36.500> to<00:02:36.590> go<00:02:36.740> because<00:02:36.920> otherwise<00:02:37.100> I<00:02:37.310> was

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:37.490 
they had to go because otherwise I was

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:38.860 
they had to go because otherwise I was
going<00:02:37.550> to<00:02:37.730> get<00:02:37.820> disqualified<00:02:37.970> once<00:02:38.390> again<00:02:38.630> so

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
going to get disqualified once again so

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.350 
going to get disqualified once again so
at<00:02:39.320> this<00:02:39.440> point<00:02:39.620> it's<00:02:39.800> like<00:02:40.030> what<00:02:41.030> do<00:02:41.150> we<00:02:41.210> do

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
at this point it's like what do we do

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.620 
at this point it's like what do we do
with<00:02:41.600> still<00:02:41.840> 11<00:02:42.020> cars<00:02:42.380> in<00:02:42.530> this<00:02:42.650> race<00:02:42.710> here<00:02:43.250> and

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
with still 11 cars in this race here and

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:47.140 
with still 11 cars in this race here and
we<00:02:44.630> know<00:02:44.750> at<00:02:44.930> the<00:02:45.050> point<00:02:45.260> so<00:02:46.130> I<00:02:46.400> didn't<00:02:47.090> know

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
we know at the point so I didn't know

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:48.280 
we know at the point so I didn't know
what<00:02:47.270> to<00:02:47.360> do<00:02:47.480> at<00:02:47.600> this<00:02:47.690> point<00:02:47.750> I<00:02:48.020> was<00:02:48.080> just<00:02:48.140> like

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
what to do at this point I was just like

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:49.750 
what to do at this point I was just like
yes<00:02:48.590> just<00:02:48.890> try<00:02:49.040> and<00:02:49.100> wait<00:02:49.280> around<00:02:49.430> for<00:02:49.580> the<00:02:49.640> AI

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
yes just try and wait around for the AI

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.020 
yes just try and wait around for the AI
and<00:02:50.150> try<00:02:50.300> to<00:02:50.360> take<00:02:50.540> them<00:02:50.660> out<00:02:50.810> but<00:02:51.320> still<00:02:52.030> that

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
and try to take them out but still that

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:54.670 
and try to take them out but still that
would<00:02:53.150> just<00:02:53.450> be<00:02:53.600> that<00:02:53.810> I've<00:02:53.930> what<00:02:54.080> I<00:02:54.110> did<00:02:54.470> there

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
would just be that I've what I did there

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.080 
would just be that I've what I did there
of<00:02:54.800> all<00:02:54.920> I<00:02:54.950> crashed<00:02:55.250> into<00:02:55.400> that<00:02:55.580> wall<00:02:55.760> that<00:02:55.940> I'd

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
of all I crashed into that wall that I'd

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.720 
of all I crashed into that wall that I'd
be<00:02:56.300> out<00:02:56.420> the<00:02:56.600> race<00:02:56.780> but<00:02:57.530> yet<00:02:57.740> when<00:02:58.220> I<00:02:58.250> do<00:02:58.400> it<00:02:58.610> to

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
be out the race but yet when I do it to

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:02.350 
be out the race but yet when I do it to
an<00:02:58.850> AO<00:02:58.970> I<00:02:59.200> know<00:03:00.200> and<00:03:00.580> yeah<00:03:01.580> once<00:03:01.790> again<00:03:01.910> I<00:03:02.060> crash

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
an AO I know and yeah once again I crash

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.630 
an AO I know and yeah once again I crash
into<00:03:02.600> praise<00:03:02.870> and<00:03:03.050> that<00:03:03.140> was<00:03:03.380> not<00:03:03.640> obviously

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 
into praise and that was not obviously

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.880 
into praise and that was not obviously
do<00:03:04.790> good<00:03:05.060> because<00:03:05.300> we<00:03:05.780> didn't<00:03:06.440> what<00:03:06.620> we<00:03:06.770> were

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890 
do good because we didn't what we were
