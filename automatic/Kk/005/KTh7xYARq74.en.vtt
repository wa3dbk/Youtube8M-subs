00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 now welcome another day to the kitchen 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.330
 for everyone today we are going to chop the 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.880
 ingredient that we are going to need are 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:12.150
 the next 250 grams of flour 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:15.089
 wheat 150 grams of butter 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:18.600
 Room temperature 100 grams of 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:23.310
 icing sugar 35 grams of flour 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:25.890
 almonds storms ground an egg and 2 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:30.240
 salt tracks to complement we are going to 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:33.329
 use 300 grams of dark chocolate 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:36.840
 and a tablespoon of butter and we can 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.980
 decorate our markets with coconut 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.270
 grated dehydrated 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:43.680
 colored sugar 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:46.530
 colorful noodles 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.390
 crispy almonds or anything that 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.490
 come up with the first thing that we have to 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.240
 to do is process the icing sugar in 

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:53.240
 big color 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:58.850
 once we have finished the 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:01.400
 icing sugar we add the butter 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.450
 which should be at room temperature and 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:07.710
 we are also going to add 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:09.240
 the two salt tracks and let's move on to 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.900
 beat it until it's all right 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.900
 integrated 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.070
 you know well mixed everything we're going to 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:20.890
 add the egg that is very important 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:23.740
 that is at room temperature and we're going 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.180
 to keep going down 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.369
 once the eggs is well 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:31.470
 integrated we add the flour 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:31.470
 almonds and we beat it again 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.710
 once we have added lalin 

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:37.900
 almonds and we have beaten 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:42.090
 let's go sifting the wheat flour 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:42.090
 little by little and beating at the same time 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.840
 then when we have already 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:52.870
 integrated all the flour we will move to 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:55.630
 make a ball with our mix 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:58.540
 when we already have a ball ready the 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.970
 we put on film and we're going to 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:03.000
 Store in the refrigerator for at least one 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:03.000
 hour 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.880
 now we have brought this out more of the 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:09.369
 fridge and we have put the oven 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.270
 preheated to 160 degrees with heat by 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:12.610
 up and down 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:14.560
 then we have cleaned the 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:17.080
 countertop we have put a little bit of 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.850
 flour below we have also put 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:22.770
 a little flour the roll and let's 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:22.770
 move to stretch our mass 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:31.580
 we have stretched the dough elongated 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:35.910
 we have left it with this thickness 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:39.000
 and then we will have to match it 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:42.080
 we are a little bit here and we do what 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.420
 same for these nodes 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.010
 we already have the whole mass matched with the 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.960
 pieces that we have removed from the edges 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.910
 we will do the same again we stretch 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:51.920
 again and we can use it for 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:54.490
 do more located below we're going 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:58.150
 to cost to cut already the picados 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:58.150
 approximately with this thickness 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.840
 if you see being taken off the first 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:05.000
 it stays stuck with you because it's missing 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.580
 flour in the dough or lack flour 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.470
 countertop so you throw him some 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.410
 more flour to the dough you knead again 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:13.490
 and a little more flour on the countertop 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:15.140
 let's do the same thing we have done 

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:16.450
 with the first one I shit until I do not know 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:19.160
 we finish all the mass 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:21.260
 let's go putting the chopped in a 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:23.960
 baking tray covered with a paper 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:26.180
 sulfurized or vegetable we already have this 

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:28.310
 ready while you 're baked we're going to 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:31.520
 do the same with the leftover dough 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:33.770
 so let's put this already in the oven and 

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:36.500
 we're going to leave it at 160 degrees with a 

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:38.960
 heat above and below 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.700
 in my case, 25 minutes have passed and 

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:42.740
 Our market is ready 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:44.600
 last 10 minutes we have put the 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:47.720
 turbo fan to brown a 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:49.760
 little let's wait for them to cool down to 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:52.520
 can pass it to a grid and we're going to 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:55.720
 put the other tray with the 

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:55.720
 mass that we had left over 

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:01.050
 five minutes have passed and we are going to spend 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:03.980
 to our located to a grid so that 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:03.980
 they finish cooling 

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:09.650
 we already have all our bars 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:12.080
 baked then let's move on to 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:14.240
 put the chocolate for it first 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:17.060
 we have to melt the chocolate and the 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:18.590
 butter in the microwave a 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:20.780
 intervals of 30 seconds at low 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:22.940
 power between each interval we will pull 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:26.300
 the microwave chocolate and what 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:29.330
 we will move like this we will not be burned and will 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:31.370
 will melt easier once you have 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:33.500
 we have moved we are going to put back 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:35.720
 the other 30 seconds and so on until 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:37.790
 the chocolate is completely melted and 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:40.940
 it's totally melted so let's go 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:43.370
 to start bathing our let's go 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:47.409
 We are going well with chocolate and we leave you a 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:50.099
 Piece without bathing in chocolate 

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:50.099
 A) Yes 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:57.790
 let's go up and let's find out a 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:05:00.250
 little once we no longer have bathed in 

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:01.500
 chocolate let's decorate it with some 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:04.060
 of the options that we made at the beginning 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:06.419
 this one is going to be with crispy almond for 

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:06.419
 example 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:12.880
 once we have it that way I 'm going to 

00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:15.850
 put on a grid in this way if not 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:17.530
 you have a grid or preferred to do it 

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:19.600
 another way you can also put it in a 

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:21.520
 sulfurized paper and wait for the 

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:25.020
 chocolate dry let's continue 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:25.020
 doing the same with all the bars 

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:30.190
 we have already supplemented with chocolate 

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:31.620
 all our bars and some of them 

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:35.560
 we have put in some decoration 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:38.530
 crispy almond coconut grated sugar 

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:40.990
 colored colors star noodles 

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:43.510
 the colors and some have left alone 

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:45.580
 with chocolate then we're going to 

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:48.010
 leave now in this grid until it 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:50.290
 dry to present them have already been 

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:53.530
 cooled and we have made two suggestions 

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:56.320
 of presentation here you have several types 

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:58.150
