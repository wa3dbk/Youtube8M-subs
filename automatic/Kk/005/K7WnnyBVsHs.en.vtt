00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.490
 I am Randy Pederson, a member of Storm Products and Rotogrip. 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.279
 Today, let's talk about "release the ball" and "follow the ball" 

00:00:11.279 --> 00:00:17.509
 We will provide you with what the general bowlers must know and what I see on the tour every day. 

00:00:17.509 --> 00:00:18.849
 Correct and appropriate ball release method 

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:22.999
 Imagine that bowling is a circular object, we pull a straight line from the middle 

00:00:22.999 --> 00:00:27.379
 This midline represents the meaning of the "Equator" 

00:00:27.379 --> 00:00:30.429
 The next thing we have to do is to put the palm of your hand when you hold the ball. 

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:36.280
 From the bottom of the inner side of the equator, through a circle of about a quarter of a circle 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.840
 Rotating the belt and releasing the thumb at the same time, and then moving the palm to the outside of the equator 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.930
 I often see that the players are unreasonably excessively rotating, thus causing the sphere to become a rotating ball (ie: 芭乐花) 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.420
 And what we really want to do is let the sphere "roll" and then "turn" 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:55.420
 The best way to do this is to preset the ball in the palm of your hand. 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.909
 Ok. Next, let's talk about "follow the ball" 

00:01:02.909 --> 00:01:04.710
 When I was a former player 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.280
 Everyone imagines to play with the ball, just like a super-large hook, but this is only for you. 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:10.500
 Helpful when playing straight 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.990
 If you want to win the game in today's game, you can't see such a ball movement. 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:18.690
 In fact, most of the professional players I have seen have adopted a low and smooth ball movement. 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:23.040
 Because the bowling we use now, we are already able to generate powerful energy. 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.160
 So you have to learn to find the right pace to move and rhythm 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:33.240
 Basically, whether you are an entry player, an advanced player or a professional player 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.649
 Need to learn the four-step and five-step help-adjustment method 

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:41.329
 We have also learned the basic stance, the time difference rhythm and the ball before the kick-off, and 

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:43.220
 Combination of arm and foot 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:48.510
 We also demonstrated the correct push position and how to make the sphere 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:50.219
 Natural pendulum 

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:52.520
 We learned to release the ball and the action of the ball. 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.100
 I also learned how to try to set the route and the turning route to make the ball produce curvature. 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.140
 I am Randy Pederson, thanks for watching. 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:07.020
 Let’s see you next time.
