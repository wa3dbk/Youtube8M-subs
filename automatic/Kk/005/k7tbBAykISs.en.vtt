00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:06.870
 for the base we're going to need 100 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:10.349
 grams of oreo cookies and 50 grams of 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:13.559
 butter for the cover 3 biscuit 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:16.770
 oreo without filling and for the filling 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:19.680
 to need 200 grams of spreadable cheese 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:23.750
 like the philadelphia 100 cheese 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:28.649
 milliliters of milk 80 grams of sugar 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:31.169
 250 milliliters of liquid cream 4 sheets 

00:00:28.649 --> 00:00:34.080
 of unflavored gelatin and a glass of water 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:36.840
 to hydrate the gelatin sheets 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:39.290
 let's do is separate the cookie from 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.580
 filling we have finished separating 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:44.240
 we take the mask and crush them 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:48.250
 we throw on a bowl the crushed output 

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:51.700
 we add the melted butter 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:54.760
 and crush with a spoon mixing it 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:57.670
 everything so that it is uniform is the 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.830
 base we put it for 30 minutes in the 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:02.860
 freezer so that it compacts well 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:05.770
 base after the base cools we put the 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:10.150
 house on the fire and add the cheese 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:15.810
 to spread the cookie filling 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:15.810
 milk cream 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:21.909
 and the sugar 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:25.490
 and we move it all next 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:28.009
 We hydrated the unflavored gelatine in a 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:31.640
 glass of water and we leave it three or four 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:34.549
 minutes past that time we add the 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:36.710
 unflavored gelatin to the pan and 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:40.209
 we continue moving and heating during 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:42.920
 a couple more minutes when it's thick 

00:01:40.209 --> 00:01:46.670
 we put out the fire and let it rest 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:50.630
 for 15 minutes after 5 minutes 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:54.369
 and let it rest, we pour the 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.369
 filling on the cold base 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:02.860
 we keep it in the fridge for 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:05.920
 24 hours past 24 hours that has already been 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:08.080
 condensed the filling we crushed the 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.690
 cookie that we have reserved for the 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:13.090
 covered by gore I love the mask 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.980
 crushed over the stuffing 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:19.440
 we are in the mold 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.440
 and we have the cake ready
