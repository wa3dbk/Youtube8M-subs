00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:07.160
 one to all quite the best for 

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:10.429
 the guys I bring a script I think 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:11.929
 they are called so that makes this very pretty 

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:15.049
 is what I explain first we go with the 

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:20.350
 installation to install we do not need 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:20.350
 the block pro version 1.4 points I think 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:33.610
 in the woman's options and we're leaving 

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:36.940
 to activate support to move 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:41.500
 script and we put you in administer not 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:44.670
 we put him in import and I do not know in what 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.670
 keep it 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:50.510
 on the scales 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:53.570
 and nothing else is selected and imported 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:56.739
 just like that and how they lower it so 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:56.739
 Install level jacks 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:05.820
 I loved this 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:09.570
 for the insurance already in the title of the 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:13.400
 the video in this way and if this 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.400
 help to ride animals 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:21.390
 good that we need to assemble the 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:27.300
 animals from nothing absolutely nothing 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:29.950
 more than a stick a single payment ok 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:31.520
 what should 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.560
 this 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.640
 first what we have to do a stick 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.840
 it is a stick any 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:42.090
 and that already once having the stick 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:46.080
 let's have good we give you a click and that 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:48.710
 there is not a whole armor of I do not know what 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.710
 it's mesh 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:52.780
 armor 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:54.370
 with a diamond sword and a chair 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.910
 riding 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:56.910
 Y 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:06.220
 what do we do then it helps us to ride 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:08.500
 many had wanted to ride animals and 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:12.340
 you can ride everything from animals 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:14.380
 up zombie scriptor and all those who 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.739
 but our documents because they explode 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:19.840
 a lot but if the cows what I do 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:21.700
 would like it when sheet is updated 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:25.120
 current lisa we are to be able to 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:29.069
 control by how they see how they were not what 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.069
 I control back 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:41.819
 another thing that also attend powers at 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:41.819
 stick 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.900
 helps the mods fly away 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:55.230
 177 and billy wright who use the canon 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.950
 well this is basically almost what 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.760
 bring this module 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.760
 the dean 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:04.730
 ah 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:06.650
 the only problem with cows is that 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:12.630
 they die when they fall 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:16.600
 instead the chicks instead those that 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:21.360
 here only to mount them on it 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:21.360
 the saddle that you then give them 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:34.320
 and automatically a cow with the 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:37.770
 armor and the diamond sword 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.770
 so they cut 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:44.160
 and ready 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:50.490
 to assemble them we only select 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:53.570
 the comeback of the points and the 

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:53.570
 we select irÃ¡n 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:57.760
 the problem 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.040
 immortal 

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:08.050
 come to your house and ended with the triumph 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:17.160
 I recommend the chicken 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:17.160
 that had gone flying 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:24.610
 we select and if it comes flying 

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:26.540
 we select the stick and click on it 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:30.290
 down 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:35.320
 and see this if it does not fly good 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:35.320
 I know why 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:43.520
 well when once the chair is assembled 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:46.010
 staff is because the selected one is the 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:50.710
 stick and you only give a click but 

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:50.710
 for the animal automatically flying 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:57.259
 yes 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:00.270
 it is good to resist the falls 

00:04:57.259 --> 00:05:02.730
 Now what I want to teach you 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:06.830
 we are cornered and we only have 

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:09.640
 a stick we do not have any diamonds 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:12.740
 only also of nothing of diamond 

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:15.700
 we only have one stick we are 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:15.700
 surrounded by zombies 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:20.450
 we select the suit 

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:26.320
 what we do to the zombie we are 

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:30.070
 cornered 

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:32.310
 we give a click and send it to take 

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:34.770
 by sack 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:39.180
 at this time since it is properly 

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:42.240
 what else was it if every time 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:43.740
 Click click to leave the objects alone to your 

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:46.020
 home 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:48.319
 only with a charm stick that's why 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:48.319
 said 

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:53.440
 this stays also serves to 

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:55.300
 any way necessarily for the 

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:56.729
 animals you can also fly the 

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:59.900
 animals 

00:05:56.729 --> 00:06:04.850
 It's a world that helps you a lot 

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:08.650
 that's why I did not want to go up and also take 

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:08.650
 any object 

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:22.890
 I'm sending home but because no 

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:22.890
 I got the screen 

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.710
 i 

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:36.840
 well it's also a problem that if not 

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:36.840
 you give the animal to the cow 

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:44.040
 but come on let's go guys is all that 

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:46.080

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:49.159
