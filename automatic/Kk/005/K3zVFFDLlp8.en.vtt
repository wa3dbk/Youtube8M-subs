00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:19.380
 hello kids and today if we are ironman today 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:22.950
 well today we are in a review mod that 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:25.860
 As you can see, this is the truth 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:28.560
 I do not know this I think of the mod too and what 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:30.250
 we add this mode suits 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.420
 Superheros 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:36.430
 of super heroes of marvel dc you see here 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:40.090
 you have all what would be the 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:41.980
 clothes of the heroes right now os 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:44.240
 has the lightning right now has the 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:48.890
 creative to catch 

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:50.660
 so it would be the costumes and it's there 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:53.920
 an impressive variety and as you see 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:56.500
 if you wear the suit 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.030
 and gives you a special power a 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:01.640
 feature for example with this 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:05.479
 you can fly and 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:07.909
 you have this wache on screen that 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:11.899
 for those who do not know what an 8 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:13.729
 what comes up on the screen and if you want 

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:15.409
 let's try several outfits let's 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:18.409
 try for example Superman 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:21.790
 This really interested me enough that no 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:24.220
 they have campa has not 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:26.200
 what is your name 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:30.680
 head 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:33.770
 and he can fly it he can fly 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:36.040
 and now if you want to look here here they are 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.720
 the therapy weapons 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.820
 I'm going to remove the costumes because they give you 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.300
 a lot of speed gives you speed and 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:44.450
 they also give you 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:47.810
 there are many more things that you do not know 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:50.509
 they put the effects that you have left 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:55.240
 identity and I'm going to put on the suit 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:55.240
 batman since this one has more things 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:06.420
 pants and boots and now here in 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:10.110
 the skin is like the one with batman 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:15.240
 this is the batman numeral 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:17.430
 so leave it 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:20.030
 for I guess this will launch six 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.610
 they are like shurikens 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:27.580
 he can not fly because if there is not a 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:27.580
 only jump does not fly but it has speed 4 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:32.840
 I do not know what this is and they have already seen 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:37.090
 there should not be Spanish positions 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:40.930
 to start but well we also have 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:45.069

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:47.360

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.940
 not even 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.220
 we'll see 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:13.780
 they are and why 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:18.040
 to call per person 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:21.240

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:56.380
 with smoke bombs has a lot this 

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:59.260
