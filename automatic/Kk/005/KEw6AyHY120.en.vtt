00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.690
 and hello everyone with you fil and today we 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:13.190
 here we are on the spiderman and judge 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:20.400
 strictly because this is my first tore 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:27.240
 which show first he can quickly 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:33.170
 run here jump then another web 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:36.800
 let start with you from jumping and 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:42.570
 by the way here on the road 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:48.300
 see here is how quickly it runs and so 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:54.059
 how if you double press it high 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:59.059
 jumps still we can eat on the wall 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:01:00.980
 here and I will show it to you now 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:07.159
 brought 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:11.720
 look they turned on just so climbs 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:11.720
 it seems that there is no 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:23.180
 it's hardcore 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:29.299
 karachi panels again we will probably warm 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:33.149
 so let's start with the scientists then 

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:36.110
 let me show you how to throw 

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:36.110
 received 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:47.580
 here it's really not as convenient as 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:52.080
 games about Spiderman 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:57.679
 I know that it is more convenient to play games. 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:02:05.569
 but here that is received awkwardly starts and 

00:01:57.679 --> 00:02:08.580
 like that now I and him 

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:12.450
 ability to eat you can throw twisted 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:24.079
 but as you can see I have this function not 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:27.079
 probably works glitches in hawking mode 

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:27.079
 here 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:39.670
 oh sky people 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:44.010
 looking for goodbye to you was screaming man 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:44.010
