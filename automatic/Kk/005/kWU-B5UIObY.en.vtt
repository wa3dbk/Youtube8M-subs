00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:05.210
 hello that for the viewer I am here you have to return the title for a band 

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:07.999
 who go along with my own in these two weeks 

00:00:07.999 --> 00:00:11.940
 a little bit of exploring the country and of course the great food 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.769
 called delicious fresh food was already here and I want to lower it now from 24 

00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:21.980
 students who have given a lot of insight into the neighborhood deals with a trend 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.789
 if the city hall of brussels wants to understand why now 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:29.539
 You have body composition here right now but you see play 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:34.340
 because there are several reasons why it also explained in ash that 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.789
 well 

00:00:34.789 --> 00:00:39.729
 actually those are why people are better denied through sponsoring it 

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:43.640
 Drinking beer in the case of people eating is because they have it 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.960
 in use as comfort or 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.020
 even as a reward and you have to imagine that if this is you then the 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:52.170
 reason why you 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.550
 Peter always wins in one of the three members but if you do it every time 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.230
 when a desolate gives an example of who feels responsible or 

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:04.149
 For example, I have had a more stressful day and I have come home like 

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:06.159
 solid chocolate 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:09.080
 as a man has a particularly relaxed on it 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.940
 jeurissen totally uncomfortable in your skin and sound used knives on bag of chips 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:14.370
 or something else 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:18.380
 That will affect your body composition if it isn't 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:23.250
 always doing that is three times more possible experiencing a motion I am me 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:23.750
 to sit 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:28.310
 in the food refused as a solution at that time naturally gives the product 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:29.300
 you must feel it 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:33.400
 according to a structural solution that each time use affects you 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:34.900
 body composition 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:40.580
 and some people I also use as a reward that can eat in a general sense 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:45.680
 the Amsterdam will reward and use know often for this 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.300
 and also the ijssel you see three times now if you can imagine life to yourself 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.909
 reward placed something tasty for that 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:55.700
 that has it affects the body composition 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.899
 and in my eyes you have to add an extra broad to the reason why not to 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:03.810
 Measuring that is namely eating for health is because it is added 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.380
 to better health 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.229
 what we are going to focus on adding health through this 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:10.469
 of the diet 

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:15.090
 thanks for all access routes for that completely new restaurant is in you 

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:15.640
 food 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.800
 for things that you like or not unimportantly tasty part of the center 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.999
 live in tent camps 

00:02:21.999 --> 00:02:24.859
 the victim died 

00:02:24.859 --> 00:02:29.659
 that was clear from the kgb anyway likes very heavy arguments 

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:32.090
 but when according to insiders i would like to 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.510
 This research will add value to the damir dokic by the wild 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.959
 Adding health does not work that he is the movement that the choice of 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:43.789
 reconsider veil vision then you might get it 

00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:46.330
 okay but it is certainly nothing healthier 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:49.019
 what a disgusting thing that i also improved in seconds 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:53.269
 you can see that the new roc goes in the second round, a new milestone has been achieved 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:57.230
 for what your daily life party is going to put together will be clear 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.930
 and where vacations you have a pregnancy in addition hopes it was 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:06.650
 also used as a reward his question asked the case from amersfoort is that 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.989
 no one really around again when you look at whether the coming years will go for it 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:14.999
 The data on health and rights will have a poorly passable 

00:03:14.999 --> 00:03:17.839
 always satisfied with their salary 

00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:21.069
 that's how the event goes 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:25.499
 unfortunately only recently issued that is calmer fairway will be a bit older 

00:03:25.499 --> 00:03:26.470
 year 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:30.640
 only if you are not going to change an adult gypsy and if you do not 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.440
 We eat healthily from Sondheim that has a supply line like health 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:39.330
 that what add and the daily dose of the know except if you meet each other 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:42.630
 tinkering with that extra consideration of Waterwijk 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:47.430
 this is a few what you know today what the shore man will improve it will be the 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:48.909
 do body composition 

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:52.680
 next week the job fantastic always goes for the 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.060
 funeral procession departed from vancouver 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:59.040
 the strippenkaart how can you deal with the same emotions and other animals 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:03:59.389
 That 

00:03:59.389 --> 00:04:02.620
 when more constructive for your health if everyone is so good or 

00:04:02.619 --> 00:04:08.239
 bad in velsen what would you do instead of eating and at the same time 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:12.329
 specified if you let us know more instead of just the 

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:16.279
 Emotions to work with are a few things to think about and at most dust to think about 

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:19.780
 think for yourself believe that we are doomed to compensate 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:24.020
 got goods and ideas for yourself but for that it's for yourself 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.870
 got 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:27.639
