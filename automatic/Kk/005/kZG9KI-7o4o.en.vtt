00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.240
[typing]

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:05.600
Hey. You!

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.860
Yeah, you, watching this video.

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:10.100
So you like to play The Sims 3, huh?

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:12.440
Well, you haven't *really* played The Sims 3

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.380
until you get your Sim a nice bedroom–oh...

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:16.340
They already have one.

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.380
Well, you'll still need an awesome bathroom–

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.260
aw, crap, you've got that too?

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:22.000
Hmm.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Oh, I know.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.800
How about some nice luxurious
furnishings and intimate apparel?

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:27.800
I see.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.140
Well, it looks like you're pretty much set for life–

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:33.500
The Sims 3 Master Suite Stuff.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.960
Includes luxurious furnishings and intimate apparel?

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.120
What the frick is this? My Sims
already have all the stuff they need.

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.720
Oh, I get it. It's just that time again.

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.560
EA needed some lunch money,

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:48.760
so they gave the old Sims 3 teat a
firm squeeze and this popped out.

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.200
Time for the fifth freaking Stuff
Pack for The Sims 3 base game,

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.080
and good grief, is it just me or is anyone else tired

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.580
of these luxury-oriented content packs?

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:00.540
When are we gonna get Lower-Middle Class Stuff?

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:02.940
Or Hungry Homeless Hobo Stuff?

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.980
Not everyone wants to play
The Sims 3 emulating the Hilton family.

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:12.000
Whatever. Let's just move on to the wonders
that we have in store for us this time.

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.820
The game starts off with a very red loading screen

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.860
with some sensuous flower petals
and suggestive ticker phrases.

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.220
Now just what are they implying here?

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.820
I thought this was Master *Suite* Stuff,

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:27.120
not Masturbate Stuff.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:31.040
Oh, well. As per usual, you
can load a previous save game

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.940
or start a new game to access the stuff.

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.280
It's all kind of crammed into your game all at once

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.320
but I've grouped the items into four main categories:

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.480
In the Crap group, we have an assortment of crap.

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.760
Starting with a crapper, called the Seat of Romance.

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.920
[Latin accent]
The Seat of Romance...

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.340
[normal voice]
Um, yeah, it's really called that

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.900
and I don't know what kind of
romance happens with this seat,

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:59.800
and I have no desire to.

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:04.040
You also get a sink, a shower,
a bath tub, and a mounted mirror,

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.600
which thankfully aren't nearly as creepy

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.580
as the Seat of Romance.

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.940
Next, you've got some general junk for wherever,

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.640
including a living chair, some double doors,

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.140
a bay window with flowers on it,
whether you want them on there or not.

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.960
an ugly shuttered window for the top of your wall,

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:22.960
a column, a fireplace,

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:26.320
and a light called the Delicate Dangling Participle.

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:27.160
Really.

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.080
Dangling... Participle.

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.480
Wow. Why don't they just call it the Penis Lamp?

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.760
Okay, so earlier, I was just joking about
calling it the Masturbate Stuff Pack,

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.900
but I guess I wasn't as off base as I thought I was.

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.540
Oh, well, it can't get any worse than that–

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.540
HOLY CRAP! There's a mirror called "Glamour Puss?"

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.720
Now that's just trying too hard.

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:46.700
Heh heh...

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:47.540
hard...

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.860
Okay, that's it. The Sims team
are officially as...

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.260
immature as me.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:52.840
Moving on, thank goodness,

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.800
next we have the More Crap category

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.200
which consists of stuff for the main event of the night:

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.280
the bedroom.

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.940
Here, you get an end table, a dresser,

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:03.260
a standing mirror,

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.020
a floor lamp thing,

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:06.120
some curtains,

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.180
some candles to set the mood for woohoo,

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.140
and, oh my goodness, a canopy bed,

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.420
because canopy beds are
apparently the very definition of sexy.

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:16.360
Although, you can't close the canopy,

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.040
so it's about as useful as a bottle of sunblock

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.780
to an albino on the beach.

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:21.820
At midnight.

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:24.980
And finally, there's the Useless Crap category,

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.720
which contains all sorts of crap that might be useful,

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.420
if it weren't friggin' useless.

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:31.140
Stuff like framed flowers,

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:32.420
a hanky holder,

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:33.700
a towel shelf,

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.040
some dead plants,

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.500
flowers in a vase you can't change the color of,

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.360
and these glass containers of... I don't know.

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.160
Rohypnol and Bremelanotide or something.

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:44.740
But, wait! There's less!

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:47.260
That's right, you also get one new hair style for men

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.260
and four new hair styles for women.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.520
They're... completely uninspiring.

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:53.980
Eww, yeah, I really just don't like them.

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:57.980
You also get some lingerie and
bedroom apparel for adult men

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:59.920
and mostly for adult women.

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:01.880
And these are actually quite nice.

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:05.600
Really just due to the fact that
the pajamas and lingerie area

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.840
were a lacking area of The Sims 3 for a long time,

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:10.800
and this fixes that completely.

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:13.840
Well, presuming you already haven't fixed it yourself

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.500
by installing lots of free mods,

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:17.860
but I digress.

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:21.340
You do get one completely new
item in this Stuff Pack, though,

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:22.960
and that is the eye mask.

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:23.940
Eye masks are–

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.060
Aagghhh!! Oh.

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:27.080
Okay, that's... that's better.

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.160
Eye masks are these things.

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:30.840
They don't help your Sims sleep any better,

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:32.820
but they're cool if you're into that kind of thing

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:34.740
and who am I to judge your fetish?

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.840
The one disadvantage to these eye masks is

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.720
that your Sims don't take them
off when they get out of bed.

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:43.240
So you have your Sims going
around like wannabe daredevils–

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:47.480
totally blind yet somehow still able
to navigate the world perfectly.

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:50.000
Man, EA, talk about your oversights.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.680
Heh heh...

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.780
So is The Sims 3 Master Suite
Stuff worth buying or not?

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:00.160
As always, it costs $20 if you
buy it at the suggested price,

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:01.720
although you can find it for less.

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:05.360
Actually, right now, it's on sale at
my game shop for a few dollars off.

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:07.520
So if you get it there, you get a better price,

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:10.140
and you'll help my channel out at the same time.

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:11.820
But shameless plugging aside,

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:14.920
I really don't think Master Suite is worth the cost.

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:16.080
Like, at all.

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.560
I can't really say much of the
content is truly awful or anything,

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:22.400
and I can see how it might have some appeal to people

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:25.300
that like blind Sims and getting it on with their toilet,

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:27.300
but that's just not me. Sorry.

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:29.080
Other than a few eye masks,

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:33.660
there isn't a thing here that's new or even
tweaked enough to make me interested.

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:35.920
You really want some cool Sims 3 Stuff?

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:38.240
Check out ModTheSims.info.

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:41.440
It's got tons of great stuff for download, and it's all free.

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:44.180
This, on the other hand, is a waste of 20 bucks

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:45.640
as far as I'm concerned.
