00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
turned off and think yeah anime totally

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.370 
turned off and think yeah anime totally
isn't<00:00:36.000> what<00:00:36.120> it<00:00:36.210> used<00:00:36.239> to<00:00:36.450> be<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:36.750> quality<00:00:37.230> has

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
isn't what it used to be the quality has

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.410 
isn't what it used to be the quality has
definitely<00:00:37.829> diminished<00:00:38.550> over<00:00:38.850> time<00:00:38.879> and<00:00:39.329> I

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
definitely diminished over time and I

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.060 
definitely diminished over time and I
definitely<00:00:39.809> say<00:00:39.960> I<00:00:39.989> have<00:00:40.170> to<00:00:40.320> disagree<00:00:40.590> maybe

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
definitely say I have to disagree maybe

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.680 
definitely say I have to disagree maybe
had<00:00:41.280> it<00:00:41.430> been<00:00:41.550> four<00:00:41.820> or<00:00:41.910> five<00:00:42.090> years<00:00:42.360> back<00:00:42.540> I

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
had it been four or five years back I

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.180 
had it been four or five years back I
would<00:00:42.840> have<00:00:42.870> probably<00:00:43.110> been<00:00:43.559> along<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:44.010> lines

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
would have probably been along the lines

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.080 
would have probably been along the lines
of<00:00:44.340> that<00:00:44.399> as<00:00:44.700> well

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
of that as well

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.760 
of that as well
however<00:00:45.510> I<00:00:45.629> feel<00:00:45.840> as<00:00:45.960> though<00:00:45.989> since<00:00:46.500> roughly

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
however I feel as though since roughly

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.090 
however I feel as though since roughly
2010<00:00:47.760> 2011<00:00:48.360> onward<00:00:49.110> we<00:00:49.410> have<00:00:49.590> definitely<00:00:49.980> had

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
2010 2011 onward we have definitely had

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.430

a<00:04:24.280> good<00:04:24.700> bag<00:04:25.090> and<00:04:25.390> that's<00:04:25.510> what<00:04:25.660> makes<00:04:25.810> anime

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 
a good bag and that's what makes anime

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:27.570 
a good bag and that's what makes anime
so<00:04:26.260> interesting<00:04:26.710> because<00:04:26.830> even<00:04:27.130> though<00:04:27.520> you

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:27.580 
so interesting because even though you

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:29.340 
so interesting because even though you
might<00:04:27.820> not<00:04:27.880> necessarily<00:04:28.390> love<00:04:29.050> the<00:04:29.140> way<00:04:29.230> the

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:29.350 
might not necessarily love the way the

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:30.480 
might not necessarily love the way the
show<00:04:29.470> was<00:04:29.620> written<00:04:29.740> but<00:04:29.980> at<00:04:30.100> the<00:04:30.190> very<00:04:30.280> least

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:30.490 
show was written but at the very least

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:32.160 
show was written but at the very least
you'd<00:04:30.640> be<00:04:30.670> entertained<00:04:31.210> and<00:04:31.450> overall<00:04:31.960> my

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:32.170 
you'd be entertained and overall my

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:33.990 
you'd be entertained and overall my
stance<00:04:32.500> on<00:04:32.710> it<00:04:32.830> is<00:04:32.920> that<00:04:33.100> while<00:04:33.400> anime<00:04:33.820> has

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.000 
stance on it is that while anime has

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.640 
stance on it is that while anime has
changed<00:04:34.540> yes<00:04:34.720> and<00:04:34.900> there<00:04:34.990> are<00:04:35.140> elements<00:04:35.620> that

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:35.650 
changed yes and there are elements that

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:37.260 
changed yes and there are elements that
you<00:04:35.830> could<00:04:35.980> do<00:04:36.130> it<00:04:36.250> out<00:04:36.370> and<00:04:36.640> maybe<00:04:36.850> there<00:04:37.090> are

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:37.270 
you could do it out and maybe there are

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:38.700 
you could do it out and maybe there are
an<00:04:37.450> abundance<00:04:37.540> of<00:04:38.020> shows<00:04:38.260> that<00:04:38.380> you<00:04:38.470> just

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:38.710 
an abundance of shows that you just

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:40.050 
an abundance of shows that you just
don't<00:04:38.890> care<00:04:39.040> for<00:04:39.310> for<00:04:39.520> the<00:04:39.580> most<00:04:39.760> part<00:04:39.940> there

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:40.060 
don't care for for the most part there

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:41.490 
don't care for for the most part there
are<00:04:40.180> series<00:04:40.540> out<00:04:40.690> there<00:04:40.900> that<00:04:41.050> are<00:04:41.170> very<00:04:41.200> well

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:41.500 
are series out there that are very well

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:43.290 
are series out there that are very well
written<00:04:41.830> they<00:04:42.100> come<00:04:42.310> out<00:04:42.400> every<00:04:42.460> year<00:04:42.700> and<00:04:43.180> you

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:43.300 
written they come out every year and you

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:44.490 
written they come out every year and you
just<00:04:43.480> kind<00:04:43.660> of<00:04:43.750> know<00:04:43.840> where<00:04:44.020> to<00:04:44.140> look<00:04:44.290> and

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:44.500 
just kind of know where to look and

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:45.660 
just kind of know where to look and
sometimes<00:04:44.680> it<00:04:45.010> can<00:04:45.130> be<00:04:45.160> right<00:04:45.370> in<00:04:45.460> front<00:04:45.610> of

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:45.670 
sometimes it can be right in front of

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:46.950 
sometimes it can be right in front of
your<00:04:45.820> face<00:04:46.000> maybe<00:04:46.390> they're<00:04:46.630> too<00:04:46.780> mainstream

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960 
your face maybe they're too mainstream

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:49.050 
your face maybe they're too mainstream
looking<00:04:47.620> at<00:04:47.710> like<00:04:47.890> oh<00:04:48.070> that's<00:04:48.550> popular<00:04:49.000> is

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:49.060 
looking at like oh that's popular is

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:50.940 
looking at like oh that's popular is
probably<00:04:49.300> not<00:04:49.450> good<00:04:49.660> give<00:04:50.110> it<00:04:50.140> a<00:04:50.320> try<00:04:50.560> so

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:50.950 
probably not good give it a try so

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:52.560 
probably not good give it a try so
overall<00:04:51.190> I<00:04:51.250> think<00:04:51.460> anime<00:04:51.910> is<00:04:52.030> definitely<00:04:52.390> not

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:52.570 
overall I think anime is definitely not

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:53.940 
overall I think anime is definitely not

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:57.040 
think do you feel as though anime over

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:58.560 
think do you feel as though anime over
the<00:04:57.160> years<00:04:57.370> from<00:04:57.640> the<00:04:57.730> bebop<00:04:58.030> days<00:04:58.300> has

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:58.570 
the years from the bebop days has

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:00.360 
the years from the bebop days has
definitely<00:04:58.960> decreased<00:04:59.380> in<00:04:59.530> quality<00:05:00.010> do<00:05:00.280> you

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:00.370 
definitely decreased in quality do you

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:02.100 
definitely decreased in quality do you
feel<00:05:00.580> as<00:05:00.730> though<00:05:00.910> it's<00:05:01.090> just<00:05:01.240> a<00:05:01.450> stigma<00:05:01.990> that's

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:02.110 
feel as though it's just a stigma that's

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:03.420 
feel as though it's just a stigma that's
been<00:05:02.320> put<00:05:02.500> on<00:05:02.620> because<00:05:02.800> we<00:05:03.010> do<00:05:03.160> have<00:05:03.310> an

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:03.430 
been put on because we do have an

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:05.220 
been put on because we do have an

used to be and just because something is

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:22.770 
used to be and just because something is
popular<00:05:20.860> and<00:05:21.460> it's<00:05:21.610> not<00:05:22.000> necessarily<00:05:22.450> good
