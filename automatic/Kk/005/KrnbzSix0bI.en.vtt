00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:06.720
 hello my dear female students today 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:09.480
 i'm showing you how baking equals 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:14.059
 battery is very important here 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:20.220
 let's look closely 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:24.090
 drawing patterns for tracing paper for parchment 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.560
 or never look at the tape 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.619
 cut immediately 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:31.230
 leave allowance of one and a half to two 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.180
 centimeters to you from that waistline 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:45.750
 which you have planned to be 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:48.450
 Be sure to pack for the competition 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.129
 salad so here we have the end of baking 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:54.120
 touched the corner became 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:57.199
 this is the baking side which is closer to 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:00.480
 middle of the middle of the cloth 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:03.930
 it doesn't matter if the fold goes there or not but 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:06.689
 then rinse the front 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.430
 it doesn't matter flexibly galaxy 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:13.680
 bolt 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:17.490
 bend our pastries and stack one 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.950
 side to the other and the end of the tuck so 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.900
 lies on the corner of the table because if we 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.020
 we will exactly look at the cluster 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.330
 the corner rises and we have nothing with you 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.090
 it will not work therefore 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:33.030
 so we have all the cloth down 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:36.420
 down and now see what we have 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:40.970
 it turns out that we have a line 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:43.829
 drew it completely with us all 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:46.170
 bent over uneven if we will to 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:49.350
 such a line to sew a belt we have nothing 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:52.439
 fail and here after you 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:56.430
 closed the tuck the laptop became we take and 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:02:00.869
 baked one in a store sold or 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:03.869
 same by hand by hand we start to draw from 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:06.390
 to the point that we have it on the side 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:09.450
 we really and go sweet 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.459
 the lines we have which starts from the line 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.250
 the middle 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:18.569
 smoothly smoothly brings to this 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:24.440
 here we have this 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:24.440
 the lines are smooth and we cut it out 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:40.610
 look what we did 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:43.820
 Our baking has risen relatively 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.890
 waistline here I am drawing here 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:50.570
 waist line 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:57.800
 even more that is our head where 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:59.060
 passed black and see how much 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.790
 everything rose 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:04.160
 if we don't do that then we have it in 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.860
 the policy will not enter we now I just you 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:10.580
 will show how it really is if you 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:13.340
 Nothing to do here is your drawing you made 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:15.760
 tracing paper forgot to run along the waistline 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:19.910
 all neatly cut out 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:24.560
 make no alignment think that this is neither 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:27.530
 what and what do we have here 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:30.620
 tuck you zashem and all the baking 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:33.040
 when we sew them up they are sent to 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:43.880
 side of the middle 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:47.360
 whether anyone before or see here 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:49.580
 look here is our base sewed and now u 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:52.970
 where is its end and when will we sew 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:54.440
 with you fighting then baking will not go into the belt 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:58.010
 she will walk with us 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:04:01.040
 yet here lice so please 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:04.750
 remember the alignment of patterns so you need to do 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:04.750
 Fataliyev everything was neatly there
