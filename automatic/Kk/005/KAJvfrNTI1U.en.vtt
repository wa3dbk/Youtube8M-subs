00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:16.400
 we are here with this very short video 

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:19.460
 to give you the scripts of the month of July 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.850
 as you can see today is 9 because you can 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.590
 to see 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:25.400
 no you don't see why there's the head of 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:26.630
 Shaboo however today 9 came in 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.670
 late because I left for the 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.410
 france now i'm back and an insubstantial partner 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:32.419
 record of the month so they let him out 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:36.800
 finally described in July 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:39.800
 we do a very negative thing is alex 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:42.829
 I address alex rizzo we will send to him now 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:46.190
 message is seen that many of you 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:47.540
 they ask whenever there is if I do 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.160
 see a little bit of a classic of the 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.300
 writing of the month thanks to 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.829
 involvement 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.270
 I remind everyone that involvement too 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:54.980
 if he asks that there is no word 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:59.210
 recent comment or things like that 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:01.700
 involvement and also takes 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.820
 the time that then viewed a video in the 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:07.040
 meaning if you want to watch so many videos 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.390
 complete you could even have the 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.280
 involvement higher than one per 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.200
 community always admitted that I like it 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.940
 precisely because he takes into account that you of 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.830
 many small factors of the like of the 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.840
 comment of the registration of the quantum 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:22.009
 display video makes a sum of 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:24.860
 everything and puts in place whoever has more 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:28.550
 participation with the channel ok therefore 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:30.440

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:32.539

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:45.229
 others still 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.280

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:49.360
 page change 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.360
 if there is a page change 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:58.140
 he pays her 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:59.939
 for this ok up here and these are almost 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.770
 those who are higher than they are 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:04.380
 on the first page of course because then 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.179
 there are other pages and nothing 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.469
 congratulations to alex russian now let's go 

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:14.190
 immediately to send a message 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:26.730
 first my message freccia annoio 6 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:31.340
 in point of if you give me your nick 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.340

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:39.269
 pearl in the street and nothing I hope this 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.769
 minimum tv both liked I wanted you 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:43.400
 advise that probably in the next 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:46.140
 days ago Wednesday or Friday anyway 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.910
 will try to do a new no 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:52.290
 type of video because it has already been seen 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:54.450
 but I will try to make some mini-montages 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.010
 about the games I did next 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.650
 in fact I will show the salient actions 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:01.590
 without the audio dts maybe with some 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:03.840
 music or some with the assent sound but 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:06.390
 I will try to make some matches 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.910
 complete but small pieces so to 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.650
 do something faster then minutes 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:13.079
 ten minutes in short, which can be 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.950
 engine more pleasant to see than one 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:15.480
 complete match 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.890
 obviously the games bought arrive 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.569
 they will be because all of you tell me that 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:19.349
 they are useful and you need how you can 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:20.819
 improve 

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:25.079
 I'm glad to load the games 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:26.730
 complete and you know it looks on their e 

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:27.569
 to know that you can serve those 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.040
 instead they will be there 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:31.470
 this is only one has come in more 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:34.849
 so my type of wine is not 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.849
 I knew bench and it came to life
