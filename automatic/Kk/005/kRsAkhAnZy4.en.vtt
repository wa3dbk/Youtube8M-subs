thing<00:00:47.340> I<00:00:47.460> want<00:00:47.610> to<00:00:47.640> talk<00:00:47.760> about<00:00:47.820> I<00:00:48.270> have<00:00:48.690> played

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
thing I want to talk about I have played

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.420 
thing I want to talk about I have played
on<00:00:49.110> this<00:00:49.230> map<00:00:49.410> I<00:00:49.559> played<00:00:49.739> a<00:00:49.770> couple<00:00:50.010> games<00:00:50.250> on

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
on this map I played a couple games on

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:51.799 
on this map I played a couple games on
this<00:00:50.550> map<00:00:50.730> and<00:00:50.910> have<00:00:51.030> a<00:00:51.059> gameplay<00:00:51.420> on<00:00:51.539> this<00:00:51.629> map

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
this map and have a gameplay on this map

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.569 
this map and have a gameplay on this map
so<00:00:52.140> there<00:00:52.289> should<00:00:52.500> be<00:00:52.530> an<00:00:52.920> annotation<00:00:53.340> on<00:00:53.520> the

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
so there should be an annotation on the

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.910 
so there should be an annotation on the
screen<00:00:53.899> maybe<00:00:54.899> not<00:00:55.140> right<00:00:55.289> away<00:00:55.350> because<00:00:55.680> this

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
screen maybe not right away because this

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.439 
screen maybe not right away because this
will<00:00:56.010> probably<00:00:56.250> go<00:00:56.489> up<00:00:56.640> before<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.120> gameplay

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
will probably go up before the gameplay

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.090 
will probably go up before the gameplay
but<00:00:58.050> when<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.199> gameplay<00:00:58.500> does<00:00:58.649> come<00:00:58.859> up<00:00:58.980> you

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
but when the gameplay does come up you

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.950 
but when the gameplay does come up you
guys<00:00:59.250> can<00:00:59.460> go<00:00:59.550> check<00:00:59.730> it<00:00:59.850> out<00:00:59.940> so<00:01:00.660> that<00:01:00.690> middle

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
guys can go check it out so that middle

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.810

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
corners as you run down the middle and

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.810 
corners as you run down the middle and
thrown<00:01:24.420> eight<00:01:24.540> for<00:01:24.720> yourself<00:01:25.070> I<00:01:26.070> got<00:01:26.640> lucky

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
thrown eight for yourself I got lucky

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.670 
thrown eight for yourself I got lucky
doing<00:01:27.119> that<00:01:27.240> once<00:01:27.420> but<00:01:27.930> for<00:01:28.049> the<00:01:28.140> most<00:01:28.290> part<00:01:28.439> I

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
doing that once but for the most part I

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.890 
doing that once but for the most part I
quickly<00:01:28.920> learned<00:01:29.159> to<00:01:29.460> avoid<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:30.360> middle<00:01:30.689> of

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
quickly learned to avoid the middle of

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.170 
quickly learned to avoid the middle of

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
maps I like a chair is really known at

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.710 
maps I like a chair is really known at
least<00:01:43.890> to<00:01:44.009> my<00:01:44.159> eyes<00:01:44.310> to<00:01:44.610> have<00:01:44.759> gloomy<00:01:45.210> maps<00:01:45.420> a

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
least to my eyes to have gloomy maps a

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.870 
least to my eyes to have gloomy maps a
lot<00:01:46.079> of<00:01:46.170> their<00:01:46.259> maps<00:01:46.409> are<00:01:46.590> dark<00:01:46.920> dull<00:01:47.310> they

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
lot of their maps are dark dull they

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.789 
lot of their maps are dark dull they
don't<00:01:48.030> have<00:01:48.119> bright<00:01:48.390> colors<00:01:48.720> that's<00:01:49.590> kind<00:01:49.770> of

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
don't have bright colors that's kind of

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.120 
don't have bright colors that's kind of
the<00:01:49.890> opposite<00:01:50.220> of<00:01:50.280> what<00:01:50.549> I<00:01:50.579> like<00:01:50.880> but<00:01:51.329> um<00:01:52.130> as

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
the opposite of what I like but um as

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.350 
the opposite of what I like but um as
you<00:01:53.340> see<00:01:53.490> I<00:01:53.520> was<00:01:53.610> just<00:01:53.729> staring<00:01:54.060> down<00:01:54.240> the

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
you see I was just staring down the

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.149 
you see I was just staring down the
middle<00:01:54.509> again<00:01:54.630> where<00:01:54.869> I<00:01:54.899> spawn<00:01:55.290> that<00:01:55.560> so<00:01:56.070> you

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
middle again where I spawn that so you

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.590 
middle again where I spawn that so you
can<00:01:56.280> see<00:01:56.460> just<00:01:56.610> how<00:01:56.729> wide<00:01:56.909> open<00:01:57.210> it<00:01:57.299> really<00:01:57.479> is

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
can see just how wide open it really is

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.149 
can see just how wide open it really is
but<00:01:58.229> yeah<00:01:58.350> I<00:01:58.380> think<00:01:58.439> I<00:01:58.619> did<00:01:58.740> a<00:01:58.799> really<00:01:58.829> good<00:01:59.100> job

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
but yeah I think I did a really good job

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.490 
but yeah I think I did a really good job
at<00:01:59.549> creating<00:01:59.670> this<00:01:59.909> map<00:02:00.119> it's<00:02:00.810> not<00:02:00.960> building

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
at creating this map it's not building

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:02.690 
at creating this map it's not building
heavy<00:02:01.740> so<00:02:01.950> you<00:02:02.040> don't<00:02:02.159> really<00:02:02.250> have<00:02:02.399> to<00:02:02.460> hold

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
heavy so you don't really have to hold

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.190 
heavy so you don't really have to hold
