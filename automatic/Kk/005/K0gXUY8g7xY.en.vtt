00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 hello my name is from the screen 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.319
 Alexandrov and today I want to talk 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:09.330
 with you about indoor plants 

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:12.059
 so that your flowers win over well and 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.559
 did not look exhausted by spring 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:17.400
 suffocate me 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:21.750
 you need only keep two small 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:24.720
 conditions first this room is best 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.599
 all the flowers to gather in one place so for 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.060
 they will be easier to care in one place 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:34.110
 create a certain microclimate 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:36.800
 temperature humidity and this is very 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:41.450
 good effect on wintering plants 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:43.739
 here's my balcony not warmed 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:47.579
 heated at night here 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:50.489
 temperature is about 16 18 degrees 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:54.059
 the main thing is that the room is bright during the day 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:59.370
 enough sun enough light even 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:01:02.149
 is it not cloudy anyway light 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:05.939
 it is enough that the plant is not 

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:09.299
 draw out and in the evening somewhere hours 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:12.570
 five to six depending on the month of winter 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:16.500
 I'm starting to connect the lamps and add light 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:19.680
 plants are also white in the morning and one more 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:22.950
 a very important condition is feeding 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:26.159
 winter of course someone will say that as 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.590
 we do not feed the plant in winter but 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:31.350
 Here, based on my experience, made sure that 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:35.070
 it's not right if you even hold 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:38.759
 analogy with a man someone is starving 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:41.490
 then breaks down and starts to fill up well 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:45.180
 and what's good with the plants 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:47.640
 it is better to add a little watering 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.159
 fertilizer then plant 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:53.100
 develop harmoniously they are not 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:55.979
 drawn not good healthy foliage 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:02:00.020
 and they are less affected by disease and 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:03.520
 pests such as pelargonium and 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:06.219
 I use balsamines in summer 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:09.039
 for decoration flower beds and I really 

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:11.290
 much need planting material well and 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:15.459
 how do you imagine if the plant itself 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:20.730
 barely alive with them from it still trim on 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:23.379
 cuttings here I brought them in the fall 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:27.220
 little cherry legs and that's over the winter 

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:29.709
 such large bushes have grown 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.959
 which bloom incessantly throughout the winter 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:34.750
 as well as white and red pelargonium 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:38.010
 it's my mother plants and now in 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:41.920
 March, I'll start cutting them all on cuttings and 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:45.549
 But if you do not go hungry plant 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.420
 sit u they painfully endure 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:49.690
 pruning 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:52.599
 on cuttings and very quickly builds up 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:57.190
 green mass is restored and already in 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:03:00.880
 May I teach rooting cuttings from 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:01.360
 them and now these plants are growing and already in 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.049
 May 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.860
 stand outside full blooming 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:08.319
 flowers 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:11.620
 do you know in my garden pass 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:16.769
 wedding photo shoots and it is very important to me 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:19.350
 already in early spring early summer beautiful 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:22.299
 pot plants because the garden is still 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:27.040
 empty still plant a little 

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:31.269
 and so I focus on potted 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:35.230
 Flowers means that I use for 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:38.069
 fertilizing this mineral fertilizer and them 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.069
 humates 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:45.099
 here here I sprinkled on very 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:48.459
 a few centimeters 5 10 can be poured 

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:51.250
 a third bottle and a half liter is 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:54.040
 fertilizer granulated or kemira 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:56.139
 station wagon or flower any 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:04:00.970
 complex fertilizer is filled with water 

00:03:56.139 --> 00:04:03.760
 this concentrate before watering is enough 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:07.590
 This all shake off and use on 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:07.590
 bucket 12 cal. 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:15.610
 and you can also use dry humates 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:18.280
 I breed 10 packs of humate very hot 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:19.180
 Water is also a concentrate or already 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:22.090
 ready 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:26.310
 in a bottle of gumi concentrated what do you 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:28.810
 comfortable and here are these mineral and 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:32.650
 organic fertilizers 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:33.580
 I alternate in each watering add 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:36.370
 Little 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:41.440
 mineral water in another watering add 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:43.750
 a little gum and so here all winter well 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:49.110

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:49.110
