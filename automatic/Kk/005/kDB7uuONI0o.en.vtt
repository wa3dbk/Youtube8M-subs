okay<00:00:01.350> let's<00:00:01.469> take<00:00:01.589> this<00:00:01.650> some<00:00:03.470> 1983-84<00:00:04.470> Land

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:04.950 
okay let's take this some 1983-84 Land

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.460 
okay let's take this some 1983-84 Land
Rover<00:00:05.220> series<00:00:05.400> three<00:00:05.850> v8<00:00:06.750> conversion<00:00:07.109> for<00:00:07.440> a

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
Rover series three v8 conversion for a

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.509 
Rover series three v8 conversion for a
spin

00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:10.519 

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:16.520 

starts<00:00:11.519> nicely<00:00:11.910> so<00:00:12.540> compress<00:00:12.870> the<00:00:13.019> bottom

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:16.530 

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:21.640 

we<00:00:17.100> go

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:21.650 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:23.320 

I<00:00:21.740> did<00:00:22.430> around<00:00:22.580> sixty<00:00:22.939> miles<00:00:23.119> in<00:00:23.240> this

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:23.330 
I did around sixty miles in this

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:25.720 
I did around sixty miles in this
yesterday<00:00:23.920> super<00:00:24.920> actually<00:00:25.220> a<00:00:25.250> really<00:00:25.460> really

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:25.730 
yesterday super actually a really really

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:27.300 
yesterday super actually a really really
nice<00:00:25.820> conversion<00:00:26.480> properly<00:00:26.900> engineered

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:27.310 
nice conversion properly engineered

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:29.170 
nice conversion properly engineered
someone<00:00:28.310> spent<00:00:28.580> a<00:00:28.610> lot<00:00:28.789> of<00:00:28.820> money<00:00:28.939> on<00:00:29.150> it

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:29.180 
someone spent a lot of money on it

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:31.600 
someone spent a lot of money on it
online<00:00:29.420> ever<00:00:29.720> done<00:00:29.810> over<00:00:29.990> the<00:00:30.110> years<00:00:30.610> sharing

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:31.610 
online ever done over the years sharing

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:33.850 
online ever done over the years sharing
84,000<00:00:32.480> miles<00:00:32.689> of<00:00:32.960> them<00:00:33.079> obviously<00:00:33.200> as<00:00:33.650> its

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:33.860 
84,000 miles of them obviously as its

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.630 
84,000 miles of them obviously as its
had<00:00:33.950> an<00:00:34.040> engine<00:00:34.280> conversion<00:00:36.190> the<00:00:37.190> develop<00:00:37.489> and

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:37.640 
had an engine conversion the develop and

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.729 
had an engine conversion the develop and
really<00:00:37.820> I<00:00:38.090> think<00:00:38.629> the<00:00:38.960> energy<00:00:39.080> conversion<00:00:39.500> was

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:39.739 
really I think the energy conversion was

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:42.939 
really I think the energy conversion was
done<00:00:39.920> from<00:00:40.129> memory<00:00:40.309> about<00:00:40.580> 66,000<00:00:41.540> miles<00:00:41.949> so

00:00:42.939 --> 00:00:42.949 
done from memory about 66,000 miles so

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:47.560 
done from memory about 66,000 miles so
showing<00:00:43.220> 84<00:00:43.699> now<00:00:45.790> was<00:00:46.790> also<00:00:47.120> fitted<00:00:47.449> at<00:00:47.540> the

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:47.570 
showing 84 now was also fitted at the

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.650 
showing 84 now was also fitted at the
time<00:00:47.809> with<00:00:48.080> Range<00:00:48.920> Rover<00:00:49.370> diffs<00:00:50.300> as<00:00:50.480> well

time with Range Rover diffs as well

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.619 
time with Range Rover diffs as well
which<00:00:51.489> make<00:00:52.489> the<00:00:52.610> gearing<00:00:52.850> slightly<00:00:53.510> more

00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:53.629 
which make the gearing slightly more

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:59.049 
which make the gearing slightly more
pleasant<00:00:54.019> for<00:00:54.080> for<00:00:54.680> on<00:00:54.799> Road<00:00:55.010> use<00:00:58.059> engine

gauge watching gearbox are nice the

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:13.660 
gauge watching gearbox are nice the
whole<00:01:12.439> drivetrain<00:01:12.710> feels<00:01:13.220> very<00:01:13.430> solid

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:13.670 
whole drivetrain feels very solid

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.050 
whole drivetrain feels very solid
actually<00:01:13.909> there's<00:01:14.180> no<00:01:14.409> nasty<00:01:16.060> launches

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060 
actually there's no nasty launches

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.200 
actually there's no nasty launches
clunking<00:01:17.570> banging<00:01:17.930> or<00:01:18.280> squeaking<00:01:19.280> so<00:01:19.880> no<00:01:20.090> more

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:20.210

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:22.939 
than you expect on it on a series Landy

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:24.190 
than you expect on it on a series Landy
but<00:01:23.090> this<00:01:23.180> one<00:01:23.330> actually<00:01:23.479> feels<00:01:23.780> really<00:01:23.869> quite

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
so you've got the sound of the v8 we had

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.800 
so you've got the sound of the v8 we had
conversions<00:01:32.130> lovely<00:01:32.400> actually<00:01:32.520> on<00:01:32.700> these<00:01:32.880> the

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
conversions lovely actually on these the

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.570 
conversions lovely actually on these the
fuel<00:01:34.350> consumption<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:34.950> real<00:01:35.070> world<00:01:35.310> is<00:01:35.430> no

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:35.580 
fuel consumption the real world is no

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.060 
fuel consumption the real world is no
worse<00:01:35.760> than<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:36.000> 2.2<00:01:36.590> petrol<00:01:37.590> and<00:01:37.920> you've

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
worse than the 2.2 petrol and you've

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.260

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:23.010 

those<00:04:18.900> synchro<00:04:19.289> problems<00:04:19.650> in<00:04:19.739> the<00:04:19.799> box
