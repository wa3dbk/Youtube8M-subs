00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:23.449 
deduce layer and you'll see that a

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:25.269 
deduce layer and you'll see that a
little<00:00:23.689> bit<00:00:23.779> right<00:00:24.080> now<00:00:24.140> a<00:00:24.470> little<00:00:24.830> fly<00:00:25.070> a

quick fly through of the map so you can

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:29.679 
quick fly through of the map so you can
kind<00:00:28.369> of<00:00:28.400> understand<00:00:28.939> map<00:00:29.150> a<00:00:29.179> little<00:00:29.419> bit<00:00:29.539> and

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:17.660 
really not that great for enslaving the

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:20.440 
really not that great for enslaving the
flag<00:01:17.930> I<00:01:18.320> mean<00:01:18.680> it<00:01:18.800> works<00:01:19.040> but<00:01:19.580> it's<00:01:20.000> not<00:01:20.210> the

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
flag I mean it works but it's not the

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.960 
flag I mean it works but it's not the
size<00:01:20.630> aren't<00:01:20.990> very<00:01:21.140> balanced<00:01:21.710> and<00:01:21.970> the

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:22.970 
size aren't very balanced and the

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:27.280 
size aren't very balanced and the
weapons<00:01:23.390> respond<00:01:23.930> back<00:01:24.560> way<00:01:24.920> too<00:01:24.980> quickly<00:01:26.290> it

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:27.290 
weapons respond back way too quickly it

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.250 
weapons respond back way too quickly it
says<00:01:27.500> kind<00:01:27.710> of<00:01:27.830> affair<00:01:28.720> like<00:01:29.720> the<00:01:29.780> map<00:01:30.050> itself

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:30.260 
says kind of affair like the map itself

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.040 
says kind of affair like the map itself
as<00:01:30.650> you<00:01:30.770> bounce<00:01:31.640> in<00:01:32.180> a<00:01:32.300> couple<00:01:32.690> parts<00:01:32.930> of<00:01:32.990> the

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:33.050 
as you bounce in a couple parts of the

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:36.250 
as you bounce in a couple parts of the
map<00:01:33.170> that<00:01:33.470> aren't<00:01:33.830> quite<00:01:34.690> great<00:01:35.690> you'll<00:01:35.990> see

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:36.260 
map that aren't quite great you'll see

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:37.990 
map that aren't quite great you'll see
it<00:01:36.409> part<00:01:36.620> at<00:01:36.710> the<00:01:36.770> end<00:01:36.890> where<00:01:37.250> I<00:01:37.700> don't<00:01:37.850> know<00:01:37.909> if

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.000

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.100 
to it just through a teleporter and it's
counting<00:01:51.920> fair<00:01:52.159> you<00:01:53.060> can<00:01:53.240> you<00:01:53.510> can<00:01:53.659> see<00:01:53.990> the

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110 
counting fair you can you can see the

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:55.660 
counting fair you can you can see the
teleporter<00:01:54.650> as<00:01:54.830> you<00:01:55.040> see<00:01:55.190> right<00:01:55.220> here<00:01:55.520> it's

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
teleporter as you see right here it's

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.100 
teleporter as you see right here it's
like<00:01:55.790> a<00:01:55.820> overall<00:01:56.810> vantage<00:01:57.320> point<00:01:57.620> in<00:01:57.799> the<00:01:57.860> map

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 
like a overall vantage point in the map

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.109 
like a overall vantage point in the map
you<00:02:00.110> see<00:02:00.380> me<00:02:00.500> right<00:02:00.620> now<00:02:00.890> there's<00:02:01.640> a<00:02:01.790> little

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:02.119 
you see me right now there's a little

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:04.000 
you see me right now there's a little
quick<00:02:02.420> stinky<00:02:02.869> way<00:02:02.990> to<00:02:03.049> get<00:02:03.260> in<00:02:03.470> there<00:02:03.650> real

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:04.010 
quick stinky way to get in there real

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:06.340 
quick stinky way to get in there real
fast<00:02:04.040> so<00:02:04.670> I<00:02:05.090> mean<00:02:05.270> it<00:02:05.360> is<00:02:05.450> kind<00:02:05.510> of<00:02:05.750> fair<00:02:05.960> but

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
fast so I mean it is kind of fair but

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.020 
fast so I mean it is kind of fair but
yet<00:02:06.560> it's<00:02:06.770> not<00:02:06.979> fair<00:02:07.220> because<00:02:07.340> a<00:02:07.549> sniper<00:02:07.790> does

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
yet it's not fair because a sniper does

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.119 
yet it's not fair because a sniper does
respond<00:02:08.420> real<00:02:09.200> fast<00:02:09.470> and<00:02:09.769> then<00:02:09.830> with<00:02:10.039> the

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:10.129 
respond real fast and then with the

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:12.820 
respond real fast and then with the
rockets<00:02:10.580> and<00:02:10.670> other<00:02:10.819> weapons<00:02:11.379> so<00:02:12.379> I<00:02:12.409> gave<00:02:12.560> it<00:02:12.680> a

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
rockets and other weapons so I gave it a

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:13.650 
rockets and other weapons so I gave it a
seven

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
seven

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.610 
seven
and<00:02:13.750> for<00:02:14.470> the<00:02:15.400> map<00:02:15.660> me<00:02:16.660> if<00:02:16.960> it<00:02:17.110> was<00:02:17.200> just<00:02:17.290> the

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
and for the map me if it was just the

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.680 
and for the map me if it was just the
map<00:02:17.830> itself<00:02:18.070> I'll<00:02:18.550> give<00:02:18.790> probably<00:02:19.300> gave<00:02:19.510> it<00:02:19.660> a

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
map itself I'll give probably gave it a

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.710 
map itself I'll give probably gave it a
10<00:02:19.930> out<00:02:20.080> of<00:02:20.110> 10<00:02:20.340> but<00:02:21.340> since<00:02:21.670> its<00:02:22.000> you<00:02:22.090> have<00:02:22.540> to

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
10 out of 10 but since its you have to

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.300 
10 out of 10 but since its you have to
base<00:02:22.900> it<00:02:22.930> on<00:02:23.140> Slayer<00:02:23.470> and<00:02:23.650> capture<00:02:24.010> the<00:02:24.100> flag

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
base it on Slayer and capture the flag

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.340 
base it on Slayer and capture the flag
about<00:02:25.180> the<00:02:25.480> overall<00:02:25.690> balance<00:02:26.020> of<00:02:26.110> the<00:02:26.170> map

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
about the overall balance of the map

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:29.370 
about the overall balance of the map
isn't<00:02:26.530> too<00:02:26.740> great<00:02:26.890> and<00:02:28.140> weapons<00:02:29.140> aren't<00:02:29.290> the

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
isn't too great and weapons aren't the

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.340 
isn't too great and weapons aren't the
greatest<00:02:29.500> and<00:02:29.950> like<00:02:30.880> Holly<00:02:31.150> bait<00:02:31.390> respond<00:02:31.870> if

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
greatest and like Holly bait respond if

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.940 
greatest and like Holly bait respond if
they<00:02:32.710> respond<00:02:33.550> fast<00:02:33.820> so<00:02:34.150> i'm<00:02:34.210> trying<00:02:34.300> to<00:02:34.480> say<00:02:34.600> i
