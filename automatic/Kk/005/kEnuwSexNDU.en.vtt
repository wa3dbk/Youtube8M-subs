hi everybody my name is Nick and today
I'm<00:00:02.760> going<00:00:02.879> to<00:00:02.939> show<00:00:03.120> you<00:00:03.149> how<00:00:03.510> to<00:00:03.570> replace<00:00:03.990> an

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:04.230 
I'm going to show you how to replace an

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.849 
I'm going to show you how to replace an
o2<00:00:04.380> sensor<00:00:05.009> on<00:00:05.160> a<00:00:05.240> 1998<00:00:06.240> Dodge<00:00:06.540> Durango<00:00:06.859> let's

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
o2 sensor on a 1998 Dodge Durango let's

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:14.980 
o2 sensor on a 1998 Dodge Durango let's
get<00:00:08.010> started<00:00:10.099> okay<00:00:11.099> so<00:00:12.170> this<00:00:13.170> right<00:00:13.380> here<00:00:13.530> is

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:14.990 
get started okay so this right here is

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:20.510 
get started okay so this right here is
where<00:00:15.990> the<00:00:16.590> oxygen<00:00:17.070> sensor<00:00:17.490> is<00:00:19.160> it's<00:00:20.160> this

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
where the oxygen sensor is it's this

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.420 
where the oxygen sensor is it's this
right<00:00:20.760> here<00:00:21.410> this<00:00:22.410> would<00:00:22.619> be<00:00:22.769> the<00:00:22.920> low<00:00:23.100> I

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
right here this would be the low I

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.769 
right here this would be the low I
believe<00:00:24.890> on<00:00:25.890> the<00:00:25.920> catalytic<00:00:26.670> converter<00:00:26.789> which

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
believe on the catalytic converter which

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.800 
believe on the catalytic converter which
is<00:00:27.930> this<00:00:28.050> piece<00:00:28.289> right<00:00:28.500> here<00:00:29.179> after<00:00:30.179> give<00:00:30.660> my

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
is this piece right here after give my

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.160 
is this piece right here after give my
camera<00:00:31.170> angles<00:00:31.500> I'm<00:00:31.650> underneath<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.250> vehicle

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:33.170 
camera angles I'm underneath the vehicle

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.069 
camera angles I'm underneath the vehicle
but<00:00:34.170> now<00:00:34.290> I'm<00:00:34.380> going<00:00:34.469> to<00:00:34.559> show<00:00:34.739> you<00:00:35.899> what<00:00:36.899> I<00:00:36.930> did

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
but now I'm going to show you what I did

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.920 
but now I'm going to show you what I did
to<00:00:37.320> change<00:00:37.739> this<00:00:38.280> one<00:00:38.600> and<00:00:39.600> what<00:00:39.780> I've<00:00:39.899> been

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
to change this one and what I've been

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.709 
to change this one and what I've been
doing<00:00:41.300> is<00:00:42.300> I've<00:00:43.050> actually<00:00:44.390> I've<00:00:45.390> been<00:00:45.539> using

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
doing is I've actually I've been using

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:51.189 
doing is I've actually I've been using
this<00:00:46.550> it's<00:00:47.550> a<00:00:47.760> penetrating<00:00:48.420> oil<00:00:48.989> it's<00:00:49.860> made<00:00:50.160> by

00:00:51.189 --> 00:00:51.199 
this it's a penetrating oil it's made by

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:56.240 
this it's a penetrating oil it's made by
liquid<00:00:52.199> wrench<00:00:53.030> and<00:00:54.030> what<00:00:54.180> you<00:00:54.300> want<00:00:54.480> to<00:00:54.570> do<00:00:55.250> is

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
liquid wrench and what you want to do is

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.160 
liquid wrench and what you want to do is
spray<00:00:56.789> it<00:00:57.140> right<00:00:58.140> here<00:00:58.800> all<00:00:59.340> along<00:00:59.640> this<00:01:00.170> this

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
spray it right here all along this this

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.290 
spray it right here all along this this
is<00:01:01.320> part<00:01:01.530> of<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:01.680> nut<00:01:01.859> that<00:01:02.010> holds<00:01:02.070> that<00:01:02.430> on<00:01:02.640> so

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
is part of the nut that holds that on so

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.770 
is part of the nut that holds that on so
one<00:01:03.989> piece<00:01:04.970> but<00:01:05.970> you<00:01:06.090> just<00:01:06.240> want<00:01:06.420> to<00:01:06.450> spray<00:01:06.720> it

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
one piece but you just want to spray it

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.830 
one piece but you just want to spray it
on<00:01:06.960> there<00:01:07.170> and<00:01:07.700> let<00:01:08.700> it<00:01:08.820> work<00:01:09.030> you<00:01:09.390> want<00:01:09.689> to<00:01:09.720> do

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
on there and let it work you want to do

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.390 
on there and let it work you want to do
this<00:01:09.990> for<00:01:10.229> probably<00:01:10.799> a<00:01:10.830> couple<00:01:11.040> of<00:01:11.220> days

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
this for probably a couple of days

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.160 
this for probably a couple of days
really<00:01:11.670> because<00:01:11.970> these<00:01:12.119> oxygen<00:01:12.659> sensors<00:01:13.020> are

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
really because these oxygen sensors are

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.280 
really because these oxygen sensors are
pain<00:01:13.439> in<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.680> butt<00:01:14.570> you<00:01:15.570> want<00:01:15.600> to<00:01:15.810> take<00:01:15.960> a<00:01:15.990> line

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
pain in the butt you want to take a line

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.190 
pain in the butt you want to take a line
wrench<00:01:16.619> now<00:01:17.549> most<00:01:17.790> of<00:01:17.880> these<00:01:18.000> are<00:01:18.240> here<00:01:18.570> these

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
wrench now most of these are here these

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.560 
wrench now most of these are here these
are<00:01:19.470> oxygen<00:01:20.340> sensors<00:01:20.640> or<00:01:20.820> seven-eighths

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
are oxygen sensors or seven-eighths

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.420 
are oxygen sensors or seven-eighths
so<00:01:22.170> you<00:01:22.259> want<00:01:22.409> to<00:01:22.470> use<00:01:22.590> a<00:01:22.619> good<00:01:22.860> line<00:01:23.100> wrench

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
so you want to use a good line wrench

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.670 
so you want to use a good line wrench
and<00:01:24.390> after<00:01:24.630> you<00:01:24.689> get<00:01:24.810> that<00:01:24.930> penetrating<00:01:25.560> oil

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
and after you get that penetrating oil

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.499 
and after you get that penetrating oil
on<00:01:25.890> it<00:01:26.070> you<00:01:26.159> want<00:01:26.310> to<00:01:26.369> stick<00:01:26.580> it<00:01:26.700> on<00:01:26.820> there<00:01:27.119> and

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
on it you want to stick it on there and

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.690 
on it you want to stick it on there and
kind<00:01:27.720> of<00:01:27.780> tap<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.200> other<00:01:28.350> end<00:01:28.619> of<00:01:28.770> it<00:01:28.920> with<00:01:29.670> a

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
kind of tap the other end of it with a

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.690 
kind of tap the other end of it with a
hammer<00:01:30.290> just<00:01:31.290> to<00:01:31.409> just<00:01:31.890> to<00:01:32.009> tap<00:01:32.250> it<00:01:32.460> you<00:01:32.579> know

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
hammer just to just to tap it you know

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.319 
hammer just to just to tap it you know
don't<00:01:32.990> knock<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.170> crap<00:01:34.380> out<00:01:34.650> of<00:01:34.680> it<00:01:34.950> yet<00:01:35.329> but

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
don't knock the crap out of it yet but

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.290 
don't knock the crap out of it yet but
uh<00:01:36.360> let's<00:01:37.170> go<00:01:37.320> give<00:01:37.500> that<00:01:37.650> a<00:01:37.680> shot

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:39.300 
uh let's go give that a shot

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:41.150 
uh let's go give that a shot
okay<00:01:40.140> so<00:01:40.200> you're<00:01:40.440> going<00:01:40.530> to<00:01:40.590> have<00:01:40.710> to<00:01:40.860> forgive

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:41.160 
okay so you're going to have to forgive

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.000 
okay so you're going to have to forgive
the<00:01:41.400> camera<00:01:42.210> angle<00:01:42.540> for<00:01:42.720> a<00:01:42.780> minute<00:01:43.080> then

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:44.010 
the camera angle for a minute then

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:48.530 
the camera angle for a minute then
that's<00:01:44.190> pretty<00:01:44.460> close<00:01:45.620> but<00:01:46.620> what<00:01:47.310> I<00:01:47.340> did<00:01:47.730> is<00:01:48.000> I

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
that's pretty close but what I did is I

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:55.240 
that's pretty close but what I did is I
stuck<00:01:48.780> this<00:01:48.960> on<00:01:49.880> up<00:01:50.880> here<00:01:52.070> and<00:01:53.070> I<00:01:53.790> used<00:01:54.120> a

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250 
stuck this on up here and I used a

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.040 
stuck this on up here and I used a
breaker<00:01:56.250> bar<00:01:56.400> which<00:01:57.330> is<00:01:57.360> this<00:01:57.660> piece<00:01:57.870> right

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:58.050 
breaker bar which is this piece right

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:00.380 
breaker bar which is this piece right
here<00:01:58.310> it<00:01:59.310> just<00:01:59.430> slips<00:01:59.700> over<00:01:59.850> the<00:01:59.970> end<00:02:00.180> of<00:02:00.330> the

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
here it just slips over the end of the

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.840 
here it just slips over the end of the
wrench<00:02:00.630> and<00:02:01.050> you<00:02:01.260> can<00:02:01.410> get<00:02:01.560> more<00:02:01.710> leverage<00:02:01.920> and

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
wrench and you can get more leverage and

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.280 
wrench and you can get more leverage and
this<00:02:03.000> one<00:02:03.150> right<00:02:03.270> here<00:02:03.510> that<00:02:03.690> I<00:02:03.720> have<00:02:03.960> is<00:02:04.140> only

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
this one right here that I have is only

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:10.420 
this one right here that I have is only
probably<00:02:04.800> about<00:02:05.100> a<00:02:05.160> foot<00:02:06.020> long<00:02:07.940> but<00:02:08.940> then

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:10.430 
probably about a foot long but then

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:13.040 
probably about a foot long but then
after<00:02:11.430> the<00:02:11.520> penetrating<00:02:12.150> oil<00:02:12.180> sits<00:02:12.630> in<00:02:12.810> for<00:02:12.990> a

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
after the penetrating oil sits in for a

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:19.610 
after the penetrating oil sits in for a
little<00:02:13.140> bit<00:02:13.610> you<00:02:14.610> can<00:02:14.760> finally<00:02:15.320> turn<00:02:16.320> it<00:02:18.620> now

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
little bit you can finally turn it now

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.700 
little bit you can finally turn it now
if<00:02:19.770> you<00:02:19.860> use<00:02:19.920> the<00:02:20.190> breaker<00:02:20.400> bar<00:02:20.700> now<00:02:21.560> up<00:02:22.560> in

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
if you use the breaker bar now up in

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:23.810 
if you use the breaker bar now up in

this angle I'm going to have to

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.420 
this angle I'm going to have to
constantly<00:02:24.360> flip<00:02:24.870> the<00:02:24.990> wrench<00:02:25.200> over<00:02:25.410> in<00:02:26.250> one
