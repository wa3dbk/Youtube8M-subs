00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
way and here's my friends perspective

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.859 
way and here's my friends perspective
because<00:01:16.740> he<00:01:17.009> gets<00:01:17.220> comes<00:01:17.490> into<00:01:17.790> a<00:01:17.820> and<00:01:18.299> kills

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
because he gets comes into a and kills

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.020 
because he gets comes into a and kills
everyone<00:01:19.530> because<00:01:20.009> they're<00:01:20.189> so<00:01:20.400> fixated<00:01:20.820> on

everyone because they're so fixated on

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.480 
everyone because they're so fixated on
me<00:01:21.210> but<00:01:21.420> i'm<00:01:21.540> guess<00:01:21.750> this<00:01:21.979> invincible<00:01:22.979> Titan

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
crucible but we couldn't see anything

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.869 
crucible but we couldn't see anything
and<00:02:06.689> we<00:02:07.530> were<00:02:07.619> just<00:02:07.649> standing<00:02:08.369> there<00:02:08.610> with

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
and we were just standing there with

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.729 
and we were just standing there with
everyone<00:02:09.450> on<00:02:09.569> the<00:02:09.599> enemy<00:02:09.810> team<00:02:09.959> attacking<00:02:10.619> us

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
everyone on the enemy team attacking us

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.440 
everyone on the enemy team attacking us
like<00:02:11.060> madmen

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
like madmen

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.800 
like madmen
and<00:02:12.860> in<00:02:13.860> the<00:02:14.099> end<00:02:14.220> the<00:02:14.459> enemy<00:02:14.670> team<00:02:14.819> gusta<00:02:15.330> gave

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
and in the end the enemy team gusta gave

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.449 
and in the end the enemy team gusta gave
up<00:02:16.020> because<00:02:16.170> we<00:02:16.530> were<00:02:16.650> just<00:02:16.680> dancing<00:02:17.010> in<00:02:17.400> the

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
up because we were just dancing in the

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:18.890 
up because we were just dancing in the
middle<00:02:17.700> of<00:02:17.730> the<00:02:17.790> flags<00:02:18.120> that<00:02:18.420> they<00:02:18.599> couldn't

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
middle of the flags that they couldn't

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.750 
middle of the flags that they couldn't
touch<00:02:19.080> us<00:02:19.349> and<00:02:19.590> they<00:02:20.250> assumed<00:02:20.550> we<00:02:20.670> were

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
touch us and they assumed we were

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:21.920 
touch us and they assumed we were
hacking<00:02:20.970> or<00:02:21.239> something<00:02:21.599> and<00:02:21.690> probably

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
hacking or something and probably

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.550 
hacking or something and probably
reported<00:02:22.410> us<00:02:22.590> and<00:02:22.940> left<00:02:23.940> and<00:02:24.300> we<00:02:24.660> want<00:02:24.930> so<00:02:25.319> a

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
reported us and left and we want so a

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.430 
reported us and left and we want so a
bit<00:02:26.310> unfair<00:02:26.760> definitely<00:02:27.540> but<00:02:27.810> it<00:02:28.110> was<00:02:28.290> only

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
bit unfair definitely but it was only

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.550 
bit unfair definitely but it was only
the<00:02:28.620> beta<00:02:28.800> so<00:02:29.160> he<00:02:29.459> really<00:02:29.640> cares<00:02:30.060> and<00:02:30.560> then

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
the beta so he really cares and then

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.100 
the beta so he really cares and then
after<00:02:32.220> everyone<00:02:32.910> left<00:02:33.090> this<00:02:33.450> is<00:02:33.599> the<00:02:33.750> really

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
after everyone left this is the really

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.470 
after everyone left this is the really
weird<00:02:34.260> bit<00:02:34.530> there<00:02:35.280> was<00:02:35.430> an<00:02:35.519> explosion<00:02:35.819> and

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
weird bit there was an explosion and

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.410 
weird bit there was an explosion and
just<00:02:37.080> like<00:02:37.170> that<00:02:37.230> poof<00:02:38.150> everything<00:02:39.150> was<00:02:39.299> there

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
just like that poof everything was there

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.630 
just like that poof everything was there
again<00:02:39.720> we<00:02:39.989> could<00:02:40.110> see<00:02:40.380> the<00:02:41.190> other<00:02:41.310> players

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
again we could see the other players

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.220 
again we could see the other players
only<00:02:41.970> it<00:02:42.150> was<00:02:42.330> just<00:02:42.720> starting<00:02:43.080> because

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
only it was just starting because

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.890 
only it was just starting because
everyone<00:02:43.620> else<00:02:43.739> had<00:02:43.890> raged<00:02:44.099> credit<00:02:44.489> and<00:02:44.900> it

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
everyone else had raged credit and it

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.780 
everyone else had raged credit and it
gets<00:02:46.140> one<00:02:46.349> of<00:02:46.410> the<00:02:46.470> most<00:02:46.650> bizarre<00:02:46.980> glitters

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
gets one of the most bizarre glitters

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.470 
gets one of the most bizarre glitters
I've<00:02:47.970> ever<00:02:48.180> seen<00:02:48.390> in<00:02:48.450> a<00:02:48.630> game<00:02:48.840> because<00:02:50.420> why<00:02:51.420> did

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
I've ever seen in a game because why did

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.330 
I've ever seen in a game because why did
that<00:02:51.720> even<00:02:51.870> happen<00:02:51.959> how<00:02:52.290> did<00:02:52.470> we<00:02:52.739> beyond<00:02:53.099> sort

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
that even happen how did we beyond sort

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.729 
that even happen how did we beyond sort
of<00:02:53.400> like<00:02:53.610> three<00:02:54.299> different<00:02:54.510> maps<00:02:54.840> were<00:02:55.110> where

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
of like three different maps were where

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:58.370 
of like three different maps were where
you<00:02:55.769> guys<00:02:56.010> see<00:02:56.220> nothing<00:02:57.030> and<00:02:57.299> then<00:02:57.989> they<00:02:58.170> can

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
you guys see nothing and then they can

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.360 
you guys see nothing and then they can
see<00:02:58.560> us<00:02:58.709> but<00:02:59.220> I<00:02:59.810> guess<00:03:00.810> I<00:03:01.049> just<00:03:01.769> can't<00:03:02.190> even

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
see us but I guess I just can't even

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.670 
see us but I guess I just can't even
begin<00:03:03.269> to<00:03:03.510> imagine<00:03:03.780> how<00:03:04.140> this<00:03:04.349> could<00:03:04.530> happen

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
begin to imagine how this could happen

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.180 
begin to imagine how this could happen
but<00:03:05.099> it<00:03:05.849> did<00:03:05.910> and<00:03:06.530> hopefully<00:03:07.530> bungee<00:03:08.010> knows

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
but it did and hopefully bungee knows

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.100 
but it did and hopefully bungee knows
avoid<00:03:08.489> the<00:03:08.640> Sun<00:03:08.880> could<00:03:09.150> remove<00:03:09.450> it<00:03:09.630> before<00:03:09.810> the

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
avoid the Sun could remove it before the

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.039 
avoid the Sun could remove it before the
full<00:03:10.260> game<00:03:10.470> because<00:03:11.269> that<00:03:12.269> would<00:03:12.569> be<00:03:12.750> pretty

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:13.049 
full game because that would be pretty

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:14.960 
full game because that would be pretty
broken<00:03:13.470> if<00:03:13.799> you<00:03:14.040> could<00:03:14.220> just<00:03:14.250> join<00:03:14.519> a<00:03:14.730> game

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
broken if you could just join a game

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.150 
broken if you could just join a game
like<00:03:15.150> that<00:03:15.329> and<00:03:15.630> be<00:03:16.140> invincible<00:03:16.530> and<00:03:16.980> guess

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
like that and be invincible and guess

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.050 
like that and be invincible and guess
capture<00:03:17.579> points<00:03:17.970> and<00:03:18.350> the<00:03:19.350> like<00:03:19.560> but

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
capture points and the like but

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.740 
capture points and the like but
hopefully<00:03:21.060> it<00:03:21.239> was<00:03:22.049> just<00:03:22.260> a<00:03:22.380> one-off<00:03:22.590> Thunder

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
hopefully it was just a one-off Thunder

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:28.340 
hopefully it was just a one-off Thunder
it<00:03:24.750> was<00:03:25.160> just<00:03:26.160> hilarious<00:03:26.870> so<00:03:27.870> the<00:03:27.989> spinner<00:03:28.260> oh

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
it was just hilarious so the spinner oh

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:29.569 
it was just hilarious so the spinner oh
