00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:51.769 
which doesn't change its that block one

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:53.110 
which doesn't change its that block one
I<00:03:51.920> just<00:03:51.950> showed<00:03:52.220> you<00:03:52.370> and<00:03:52.670> then<00:03:52.790> if<00:03:52.850> you<00:03:52.940> keep

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120 
I just showed you and then if you keep

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:54.790 
I just showed you and then if you keep
swimming<00:03:53.480> upward<00:03:53.780> there's<00:03:54.080> a<00:03:54.170> third<00:03:54.530> game

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:54.800 
swimming upward there's a third game

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:59.979 
swimming upward there's a third game
right<00:03:55.760> there<00:03:57.459> super<00:03:58.459> backwards<00:03:59.000> so<00:03:59.780> I'm<00:03:59.870> gonna

00:03:59.979 --> 00:03:59.989 
right there super backwards so I'm gonna

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:01.390 
right there super backwards so I'm gonna
play<00:04:00.230> this<00:04:00.410> one<00:04:00.650> for<00:04:00.830> you<00:04:00.890> this<00:04:01.130> one's<00:04:01.310> a

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 
play this one for you this one's a

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.759 
play this one for you this one's a
little<00:04:01.489> bit<00:04:01.670> funnier<00:04:02.330> because<00:04:03.260> I've<00:04:03.500> timed

00:04:03.759 --> 00:04:03.769 
little bit funnier because I've timed

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:11.309 
little bit funnier because I've timed
this<00:04:04.070> imperfectly

00:04:11.309 --> 00:04:11.319 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:13.570 

so<00:04:12.319> this<00:04:12.470> one's<00:04:12.680> going<00:04:12.799> to<00:04:12.860> go<00:04:12.950> over<00:04:13.040> to<00:04:13.430> the

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:13.580 
so this one's going to go over to the

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:15.460 
so this one's going to go over to the
left-hand<00:04:14.030> slot<00:04:14.420> I<00:04:14.659> think<00:04:15.049> it's<00:04:15.170> the<00:04:15.260> right

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:15.470 
left-hand slot I think it's the right

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:19.569 
left-hand slot I think it's the right
left<00:04:16.340> hand<00:04:16.519> okay<00:04:17.799> you<00:04:18.799> click<00:04:19.010> it<00:04:19.100> on<00:04:19.160> that<00:04:19.370> side

00:04:19.569 --> 00:04:19.579 
left hand okay you click it on that side

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:20.949 
left hand okay you click it on that side
it<00:04:19.699> gets<00:04:19.850> the<00:04:20.000> opposite<00:04:20.389> ones<00:04:20.540> it's<00:04:20.780> going<00:04:20.900> to

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:20.959 
it gets the opposite ones it's going to

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:25.890 
it gets the opposite ones it's going to
go<00:04:21.079> over<00:04:21.109> the<00:04:21.350> other<00:04:21.500> slot<00:04:21.829> very<00:04:22.310> far<00:04:22.550> slot

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:25.900 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:28.360 

physics<00:04:26.900> would<00:04:27.020> suck<00:04:27.350> and<00:04:27.590> then<00:04:27.800> I<00:04:28.039> wait<00:04:28.310> a

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:28.370 
physics would suck and then I wait a

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:33.100 
physics would suck and then I wait a
second<00:04:29.500> get<00:04:30.500> it<00:04:30.590> in<00:04:30.650> the<00:04:30.710> middle<00:04:30.889> and<00:04:32.110> it's

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:33.110 
second get it in the middle and it's

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:40.090 
second get it in the middle and it's
going<00:04:33.229> to<00:04:33.289> go<00:04:33.350> to<00:04:33.410> the<00:04:33.500> middle<00:04:33.740> when<00:04:34.460> asked<00:04:39.100> so

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:40.100 
going to go to the middle when asked so

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:41.320 
going to go to the middle when asked so
if<00:04:40.160> I<00:04:40.220> keep<00:04:40.370> doing<00:04:40.520> that<00:04:40.729> eventually<00:04:41.180> he'll

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:41.330 
if I keep doing that eventually he'll

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:45.340 
if I keep doing that eventually he'll
grow<00:04:41.510> I<00:04:43.479> mean<00:04:44.479> just<00:04:44.510> play<00:04:44.750> those<00:04:44.900> games<00:04:44.930> the
