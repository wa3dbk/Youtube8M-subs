00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:17.600
 I'm very happy 

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:32.640
 never because to become a means of 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:37.470
 channel one of the things that most 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:39.629
 like the degree of content in this 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:42.290
 week I wanted to teach them to customize a 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:45.490
 bag with lace then buy in 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:54.980
 it would be a stationery 

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:56.660
 so while there are also my 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:59.540
 social networks in the information that 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:01.820
 let's see for this we're going to need 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:04.839
 lace in black and red contains you 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:08.469
 use two meters of each 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:10.659
 a thread scissors of the same color of 

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:13.780
 each of these lace of a brush 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:16.600
 black and red wine and obviously 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:20.310
 the sacks that you are going to renew in this 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.310
 case I'm going to use these two 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.899
 for the first thing you're going to remove all the 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:31.020
 details that you do not like since it takes out like this 

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:32.880
 to use as a cutter and also the 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.159
 scissors and I was removing the tape that 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.649
 I obviously hated to look like a dressing gown 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:40.049
 bathroom and that's what I took off then I decided 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:42.030
 what game with oscar the lace in 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:45.539
 this case I placed is the lace in 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.369
 the outside like where they were 

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:49.140
 the buttons or deposits that I remove 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.600
 to tie up with what he gave me in the 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.820
 lace the most king with the same and what 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.250
 well I met him with the same thread of 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:59.190
 same color of the inka group of the red 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:01.920
 I wanted the color to be very different 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:04.350
 of the lace on our side remember that 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:07.319
 you are the none at the beginning and the end 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:10.440
 very well so that you do not count 

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:12.569
 little things and you start to na and that will be 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:16.100
 everything personal with a jeans with a 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:16.100
 skirt with a dress or whatever 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:21.410
 for the second idea to use this 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:24.830
 I'm not going to use the pantaneta anymore 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:27.590
 of lace use the same but I was 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:29.780
 placing all the bottom of 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.100
 our bag but that does not matter if you 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.510
 you want to place it somewhere else 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.340
 welcome be 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.950
 I in my case the summer wanted to place 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.810
 as if it were a kimono and I already gave myself 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.640
 I realize that it would also be very ugly 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:43.790
 top part so I just 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:46.370
 cause and also above and that's it 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:49.040
 freedom the challenge project and really 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:51.500
 embezzlement put my sea so remember 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.450
 that if you like one of these two ideas 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:56.390
 please I want that I like in the 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.440

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:59.900
