here<00:00:24.669> you're<00:00:25.270> going<00:00:25.390> to<00:00:25.450> need<00:00:25.570> a<00:00:25.599> couple<00:00:25.899> of

00:00:25.979 --> 00:00:25.989 
here you're going to need a couple of

00:00:25.989 --> 00:00:27.929 
here you're going to need a couple of
tools<00:00:26.140> either<00:00:26.890> a<00:00:27.130> butter<00:00:27.430> knife<00:00:27.640> or<00:00:27.849> a

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:27.939 
tools either a butter knife or a

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:29.729 
tools either a butter knife or a
popsicle<00:00:28.660> stick<00:00:28.689> works<00:00:29.020> really<00:00:29.230> well<00:00:29.439> I

00:00:29.729 --> 00:00:29.739 
popsicle stick works really well I

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:31.440 
popsicle stick works really well I
prefer<00:00:30.369> the<00:00:30.640> butter<00:00:30.820> knife<00:00:31.000> just<00:00:31.270> because

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:31.450 
prefer the butter knife just because

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:32.910 
prefer the butter knife just because
it's<00:00:31.599> a<00:00:31.660> little<00:00:31.779> stronger<00:00:32.079> than<00:00:32.230> the<00:00:32.469> popsicle

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:32.920 
it's a little stronger than the popsicle

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.319 
it's a little stronger than the popsicle
stick<00:00:33.160> but<00:00:33.610> you<00:00:33.670> do<00:00:33.760> want<00:00:33.940> something<00:00:34.120> that's

00:00:34.319 --> 00:00:34.329 
stick but you do want something that's

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:35.639 
stick but you do want something that's
flexible<00:00:34.510> and<00:00:34.840> pretty<00:00:35.020> thin<00:00:35.260> so<00:00:35.290> you<00:00:35.530> can

00:00:35.639 --> 00:00:35.649 
flexible and pretty thin so you can

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:37.410 
flexible and pretty thin so you can
slide<00:00:35.860> it<00:00:35.890> up<00:00:36.070> between<00:00:36.340> the<00:00:36.520> sheath<00:00:36.730> and<00:00:36.879> the

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:37.420 
slide it up between the sheath and the

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:39.690 
slide it up between the sheath and the
last<00:00:37.629> tab<00:00:37.870> itself<00:00:38.320> one<00:00:39.190> thing<00:00:39.370> to<00:00:39.460> keep<00:00:39.579> in

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:39.700 
last tab itself one thing to keep in

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.400 
last tab itself one thing to keep in
mind<00:00:39.760> we<00:00:40.239> move<00:00:40.450> forward<00:00:40.690> to<00:00:40.870> move<00:00:41.019> this<00:00:41.230> knife

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:41.410 
mind we move forward to move this knife

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:43.650 
mind we move forward to move this knife
sheath<00:00:41.679> is<00:00:41.859> the<00:00:42.010> lash<00:00:42.190> tab<00:00:42.460> itself<00:00:42.789> it<00:00:43.449> can<00:00:43.600> be

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:43.660 
sheath is the lash tab itself it can be

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:45.180 
sheath is the lash tab itself it can be
damaged<00:00:44.019> fairly<00:00:44.320> easily<00:00:44.499> and<00:00:44.739> obviously<00:00:45.100> we

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:45.190 
damaged fairly easily and obviously we

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:46.500 
damaged fairly easily and obviously we
want<00:00:45.339> to<00:00:45.429> try<00:00:45.579> and<00:00:45.699> avoid<00:00:45.910> that<00:00:45.969> so<00:00:46.420> we're

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:46.510 
want to try and avoid that so we're

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:47.610 
want to try and avoid that so we're
going<00:00:46.600> to<00:00:46.690> be<00:00:46.749> patient<00:00:47.079> with<00:00:47.170> this<00:00:47.320> we<00:00:47.530> don't

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:47.620 
going to be patient with this we don't

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:49.739 
going to be patient with this we don't
want<00:00:47.710> to<00:00:47.859> try<00:00:47.980> and<00:00:48.100> force<00:00:48.370> anything<00:00:48.749> because

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:49.749 
want to try and force anything because

00:00:49.749 --> 00:00:51.810 
want to try and force anything because
we<00:00:49.929> do<00:00:50.109> happen<00:00:50.320> to<00:00:50.530> damage<00:00:50.890> the<00:00:51.010> slash<00:00:51.249> tab<00:00:51.579> our

repair and our replacement options are
going<00:00:53.710> to<00:00:53.769> be<00:00:53.829> pretty<00:00:53.980> limited<00:00:54.339> for<00:00:54.489> that<00:00:55.170> well

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:56.170 
going to be pretty limited for that well

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:57.389 
going to be pretty limited for that well

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:20.049 
into the lash tab let's go ahead and

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:21.630 
into the lash tab let's go ahead and
take<00:01:20.170> our<00:01:20.320> butter<00:01:20.500> knife<00:01:20.770> blade<00:01:21.070> and<00:01:21.280> we'll

the butter knife onto the lip that we've
created<00:01:28.000> for<00:01:28.240> ourselves<00:01:28.390> so<00:01:29.009> once<00:01:30.009> we've<00:01:30.159> got

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:30.189 
created for ourselves so once we've got

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:32.069 
created for ourselves so once we've got
the<00:01:30.490> edge<00:01:30.610> of<00:01:30.789> that<00:01:30.880> we're<00:01:31.659> going<00:01:31.780> to<00:01:31.840> go<00:01:31.930> ahead

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:32.079
