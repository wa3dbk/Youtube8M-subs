how<00:00:01.050> does<00:00:01.170> television<00:00:01.650> work<00:00:01.829> I<00:00:02.010> haven't<00:00:02.460> a

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:02.520 
how does television work I haven't a

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.910 
how does television work I haven't a
clue<00:00:02.750> electric<00:00:03.750> impulses<00:00:04.319> or<00:00:04.500> something<00:00:04.799> like

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:04.920 
clue electric impulses or something like

clue electric impulses or something like
that<00:00:04.980> switch<00:00:05.580> it<00:00:05.759> on<00:00:05.879> and<00:00:05.910> here<00:00:06.359> it<00:00:06.450> is

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
that switch it on and here it is

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:08.509 
that switch it on and here it is
electrons<00:00:07.440> through<00:00:07.649> the<00:00:07.799> sky<00:00:08.130> and<00:00:08.400> it's

electrons through the sky and it's

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:10.759

something<00:00:16.289> to<00:00:16.740> transmit<00:00:17.670> the<00:00:17.850> light<00:00:18.029> well

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
something to transmit the light well

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:19.910 
something to transmit the light well
it's<00:00:18.630> certainly<00:00:18.720> not<00:00:18.960> like<00:00:19.140> the<00:00:19.260> radio<00:00:19.590> is<00:00:19.740> it

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
it's certainly not like the radio is it

it's certainly not like the radio is it
there<00:00:20.369> seems<00:00:20.580> to<00:00:20.670> be<00:00:20.820> a<00:00:20.850> lot<00:00:21.029> of<00:00:21.060> confusion

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
there seems to be a lot of confusion

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.140 
there seems to be a lot of confusion
about<00:00:21.869> how<00:00:22.050> TV<00:00:22.350> pictures<00:00:22.859> are<00:00:23.010> sent<00:00:23.250> no<00:00:24.000> one

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
about how TV pictures are sent no one

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.120 
about how TV pictures are sent no one
would<00:00:24.330> confuse<00:00:24.720> a<00:00:24.810> record<00:00:25.560> player<00:00:25.680> in<00:00:25.949> its

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
would confuse a record player in its

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.820 
would confuse a record player in its
speaker<00:00:26.519> with<00:00:27.090> a<00:00:27.119> radio<00:00:27.510> one<00:00:28.199> is<00:00:28.320> broadcast

the<00:00:29.070> other<00:00:29.220> isn't<00:00:29.750> television<00:00:30.750> is<00:00:30.900> broadcast

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
the other isn't television is broadcast

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.830 
the other isn't television is broadcast
and<00:00:31.650> received<00:00:32.099> the<00:00:32.279> same<00:00:32.520> way<00:00:32.730> as<00:00:33.120> radio<00:00:33.510> got

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
and received the same way as radio got

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.260 
and received the same way as radio got
it<00:00:33.989> then<00:00:34.500> forget<00:00:34.890> it<00:00:34.920> it's<00:00:35.190> easy<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:36.090> real

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
it then forget it it's easy the real

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.389 
it then forget it it's easy the real
difference<00:00:36.570> is<00:00:36.870> lie<00:00:37.050> in<00:00:37.320> how<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:37.770> electronic

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
difference is lie in how the electronic

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.400 
difference is lie in how the electronic
picture<00:00:38.640> signal<00:00:38.969> is<00:00:39.239> made<00:00:39.480> at<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:39.809> studio<00:00:40.140> and

picture signal is made at the studio and

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:41.869 
picture signal is made at the studio and
how<00:00:40.559> its<00:00:40.739> displayed<00:00:40.980> when<00:00:41.370> it<00:00:41.489> gets<00:00:41.640> to<00:00:41.790> the

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
how its displayed when it gets to the

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.270 
how its displayed when it gets to the

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
home receiver all live television

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.549 
home receiver all live television
pictures<00:00:44.640> come<00:00:44.910> from<00:00:45.149> things<00:00:45.780> called<00:00:46.020> tick<00:00:46.410> up

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
pictures come from things called tick up

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.799 
pictures come from things called tick up
tubes<00:00:46.860> now<00:00:47.730> these<00:00:47.910> come<00:00:48.149> in<00:00:48.180> all<00:00:48.420> sorts<00:00:48.660> of

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
tubes now these come in all sorts of

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.779 
tubes now these come in all sorts of
different<00:00:48.870> sizes<00:00:49.289> and<00:00:49.590> shapes<00:00:49.739> but<00:00:50.460> they<00:00:50.640> all

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
different sizes and shapes but they all

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.639 
different sizes and shapes but they all
function<00:00:51.059> pretty<00:00:51.420> much<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.750> same<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.440> heart

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
function pretty much the same the heart

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.729 
function pretty much the same the heart
of<00:00:52.770> them<00:00:52.890> is<00:00:53.460> an<00:00:53.699> electron<00:00:54.149> gun<00:00:54.510> this<00:00:55.079> this

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
of them is an electron gun this this

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.170 
of them is an electron gun this this
thing's<00:00:55.949> a<00:00:56.039> lot<00:00:56.219> like<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.579> good<00:00:56.820> old<00:00:56.940> vacuum

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
thing's a lot like the good old vacuum

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.630 
thing's a lot like the good old vacuum
tube<00:00:57.539> has<00:00:57.960> a<00:00:57.989> hot<00:00:58.260> filament<00:00:58.620> that<00:00:59.100> emits

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
tube has a hot filament that emits

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.459 
tube has a hot filament that emits
electrons<00:01:00.149> towards<00:01:00.539> a<00:01:00.629> charged<00:01:00.930> metal<00:01:01.260> plate

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
electrons towards a charged metal plate

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.950 
electrons towards a charged metal plate
only<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.160> trick<00:01:02.430> is<00:01:02.609> that<00:01:03.120> when<00:01:03.539> they<00:01:03.660> get<00:01:03.809> to

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
only the trick is that when they get to

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.149 
only the trick is that when they get to
the<00:01:04.049> plate<00:01:04.260> there's<00:01:04.470> a<00:01:04.530> little<00:01:04.680> hole<00:01:04.769> in<00:01:04.949> the

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
the plate there's a little hole in the

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.320 
the plate there's a little hole in the
end<00:01:05.369> they<00:01:05.489> didn't<00:01:05.700> expect<00:01:06.000> to<00:01:06.030> be<00:01:06.119> there

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
end they didn't expect to be there

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.700 
end they didn't expect to be there
they're<00:01:06.510> all<00:01:06.630> come<00:01:06.810> shooting<00:01:07.200> out<00:01:07.290> a<00:01:07.350> thin

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
they're all come shooting out a thin

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.039 
they're all come shooting out a thin
stream<00:01:08.130> some<00:01:09.119> other<00:01:09.270> little<00:01:09.450> metal<00:01:09.810> things

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
stream some other little metal things

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.960 
stream some other little metal things
here<00:01:10.229> attract<00:01:10.530> and<00:01:10.710> repel<00:01:10.799> it<00:01:11.100> and<00:01:11.310> can<00:01:11.729> allow

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
here attract and repel it and can allow

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.480 
here attract and repel it and can allow
it<00:01:12.060> to<00:01:12.119> be<00:01:12.270> focused<00:01:12.659> into<00:01:12.900> a<00:01:12.930> tiny<00:01:13.229> spot<00:01:13.740> that

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
it to be focused into a tiny spot that

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.660 
it to be focused into a tiny spot that
spot<00:01:14.939> falls<00:01:15.720> on<00:01:15.990> a<00:01:16.020> light-sensitive<00:01:16.590> layer<00:01:17.100> in

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
spot falls on a light-sensitive layer in

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.340 
spot falls on a light-sensitive layer in
the<00:01:17.790> tube<00:01:17.970> at<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.240> front<00:01:18.509> called<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:18.990> target

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
the tube at the front called the target

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.969 
the tube at the front called the target
now<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.580> picture<00:01:20.970> is<00:01:21.409> focused<00:01:22.409> on<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.650> target

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
now the picture is focused on the target

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.440 
now the picture is focused on the target
by<00:01:23.100> an<00:01:23.220> ordinary<00:01:23.580> lens<00:01:23.850> there's<00:01:24.119> actually<00:01:24.420> a

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
by an ordinary lens there's actually a

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.120 
by an ordinary lens there's actually a
little<00:01:24.689> picture<00:01:24.869> focused<00:01:25.350> they're<00:01:25.500> just<00:01:26.009> as

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
little picture focused they're just as

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.770 
little picture focused they're just as
it<00:01:26.220> would<00:01:26.310> be<00:01:26.490> on<00:01:26.610> film<00:01:26.909> and<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.630> beam

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
it would be on film and the beam

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.929 
it would be on film and the beam
contacts<00:01:28.380> it<00:01:28.470> from<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:28.740> other<00:01:28.860> side<00:01:29.130> now

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
contacts it from the other side now

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.580 
contacts it from the other side now
because<00:01:30.509> of<00:01:30.540> its<00:01:30.720> chemical<00:01:30.869> properties

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
because of its chemical properties

it<00:01:39.659> will<00:01:39.780> deposit<00:01:40.140> enough<00:01:40.950> electrons<00:01:41.430> to

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
it will deposit enough electrons to

replace the ones that left electrons are

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.340 
replace the ones that left electrons are
just<00:01:44.340> funny<00:01:44.520> that<00:01:44.610> way<00:01:44.909> so<00:01:45.570> if<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:45.990> target<00:01:46.290> is

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
just funny that way so if the target is

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.770 
just funny that way so if the target is
bright<00:01:46.590> a<00:01:46.799> lot<00:01:47.130> of<00:01:47.159> electrons<00:01:47.700> leave<00:01:48.030> and<00:01:48.270> a
