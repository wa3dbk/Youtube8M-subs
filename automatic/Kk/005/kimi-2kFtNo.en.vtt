00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
downsides to this case would prevent it

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.650 
downsides to this case would prevent it

plastic<00:02:35.790> on<00:02:35.970> the<00:02:36.030> inside<00:02:36.600> and<00:02:36.750> on<00:02:36.810> the<00:02:36.870> outside

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
plastic on the inside and on the outside

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:41.479 
plastic on the inside and on the outside
you<00:02:37.350> hear<00:02:37.470> the<00:02:37.560> soft<00:02:37.769> plastic<00:02:39.799> one<00:02:40.799> thing<00:02:41.190> that

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
you hear the soft plastic one thing that

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:44.240 
you hear the soft plastic one thing that
does<00:02:41.850> kind<00:02:42.150> of<00:02:42.239> annoy<00:02:42.750> me<00:02:42.930> just<00:02:43.140> a<00:02:43.260> teensy<00:02:44.070> bit

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250

does kind of annoy me just a teensy bit
is<00:02:44.570> that<00:02:45.570> sometimes<00:02:46.200> like<00:02:46.470> this<00:02:46.680> side<00:02:47.100> over

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
is that sometimes like this side over

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.910 
is that sometimes like this side over
here<00:02:47.400> will<00:02:47.850> tend<00:02:48.120> to<00:02:48.239> pop<00:02:48.420> up<00:02:48.480> a<00:02:48.750> little<00:02:48.959> bit<00:02:49.110> so

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
here will tend to pop up a little bit so

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.340 
here will tend to pop up a little bit so
I<00:02:49.950> need<00:02:50.130> to<00:02:50.250> consistently<00:02:50.670> be<00:02:51.260> pushing<00:02:52.260> it

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
I need to consistently be pushing it

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:57.050 
I need to consistently be pushing it
back<00:02:52.440> into<00:02:52.680> place<00:02:54.019> also<00:02:55.019> the<00:02:55.739> the<00:02:56.400> port<00:02:56.670> covers

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
back into place also the the port covers

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.720 
back into place also the the port covers
tend<00:02:57.329> to<00:02:57.390> be<00:02:57.510> a<00:02:57.540> little<00:02:57.720> stiff<00:02:58.079> if<00:02:58.799> you<00:02:59.010> can<00:02:59.549> see

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
tend to be a little stiff if you can see

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.220 
tend to be a little stiff if you can see
that<00:03:00.079> even<00:03:01.079> after<00:03:01.380> continued<00:03:02.190> use<00:03:02.430> and

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
that even after continued use and

really<00:03:35.819> well<00:03:35.970> I've<00:03:36.120> dropped<00:03:36.300> it<00:03:36.510> a<00:03:36.569> couple<00:03:36.750> of

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
really well I've dropped it a couple of

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.210 
really well I've dropped it a couple of
times<00:03:37.140> I<00:03:37.290> really<00:03:37.500> try<00:03:37.650> not<00:03:37.800> to<00:03:37.890> drop<00:03:38.040> my

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
times I really try not to drop my

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.550 
times I really try not to drop my
electronics<00:03:38.819> but<00:03:38.970> it<00:03:39.540> lends<00:03:40.020> itself<00:03:40.290> pretty

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
electronics but it lends itself pretty

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.860 
electronics but it lends itself pretty
well<00:03:40.860> one<00:03:41.790> thing<00:03:42.030> that<00:03:42.180> you<00:03:42.209> probably<00:03:42.660> already

before but I'll give it a shot but

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.090 
before but I'll give it a shot but
overall<00:04:16.950> this<00:04:17.130> is<00:04:17.190> a<00:04:17.370> pretty<00:04:17.579> good<00:04:17.790> case<00:04:19.100> it's

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:20.100 
overall this is a pretty good case it's

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:21.860 
overall this is a pretty good case it's
definitely<00:04:20.820> giving<00:04:21.329> me<00:04:21.450> the<00:04:21.600> kind<00:04:21.810> of

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
definitely giving me the kind of

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.050 
definitely giving me the kind of
protection<00:04:22.200> that<00:04:22.380> I<00:04:22.530> think<00:04:22.979> I<00:04:23.100> need<00:04:23.310> for<00:04:23.700> my

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
protection that I think I need for my

most of your docking stations will

00:05:55.389 --> 00:05:56.850 
most of your docking stations will
probably<00:05:55.750> not<00:05:55.870> work<00:05:55.930> with<00:05:56.289> this<00:05:56.440> but<00:05:56.680> your

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:56.860
