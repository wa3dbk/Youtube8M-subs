00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:05.269 
give you another view our blasters shut

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:08.320 
give you another view our blasters shut
off<00:01:05.449> so<00:01:05.630> let's<00:01:05.810> take<00:01:05.960> a<00:01:06.020> look<00:01:06.200> and<00:01:06.320> see<00:01:06.409> what<00:01:07.330> we

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:08.330 
off so let's take a look and see what we

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:15.850 
off so let's take a look and see what we
got<00:01:08.570> here<00:01:11.289> that's<00:01:12.289> looking<00:01:12.409> a<00:01:12.649> lot<00:01:12.740> better

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:15.860

which is the way it should be that's one
of<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:35.970> problems<00:01:36.060> with<00:01:36.360> these<00:01:36.600> old<00:01:36.840> fe<00:01:37.260> Ford's

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
of the problems with these old fe Ford's

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.130 
of the problems with these old fe Ford's
people<00:01:38.850> would<00:01:38.970> run<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.660> things<00:01:39.870> without

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
people would run the things without

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.410 
people would run the things without
thermostats<00:01:40.770> or<00:01:41.010> real<00:01:41.850> low<00:01:41.970> temperature

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
thermostats or real low temperature

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:43.820 
thermostats or real low temperature
thermostats<00:01:42.990> and<00:01:43.200> that<00:01:43.350> was<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:43.560> worst<00:01:43.740> thing

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:43.830 
thermostats and that was the worst thing

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:46.220 
thermostats and that was the worst thing
you<00:01:44.010> could<00:01:44.160> do<00:01:44.310> to<00:01:44.340> him<00:01:44.610> it<00:01:45.360> need<00:01:45.540> to<00:01:45.570> be<00:01:45.690> run<00:01:46.140> at

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:46.230 
you could do to him it need to be run at

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:48.530 
you could do to him it need to be run at
least<00:01:46.410> 180<00:01:46.980> 195<00:01:47.670> degrees<00:01:47.880> and<00:01:48.330> then<00:01:48.390> they

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
least 180 195 degrees and then they

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.930 
least 180 195 degrees and then they
won't<00:01:48.720> get<00:01:49.650> all<00:01:49.800> the<00:01:49.950> carbon<00:01:50.310> build<00:01:50.520> up<00:01:50.610> under

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:50.940 
won't get all the carbon build up under

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.030 
won't get all the carbon build up under
here<00:01:51.500> anyway<00:01:52.500> if<00:01:52.620> you<00:01:52.740> have<00:01:52.830> more<00:01:52.980> questions
