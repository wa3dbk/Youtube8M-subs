00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.320
 not only was I a boy arrived in 2010 more 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:16.170
 a good video in the video already bringing here 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.869
 As a trainer, hg, I came here. 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.939
 bringing a pro hg training map 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:24.060
 with a year of training that José Fae 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:26.279
 I believe Fuso was the one who did more than 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.740
 he was showing energy videos 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.869
 I came here to bring I will leave the 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.780
 download in the description I'll be 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:36.690
 presenting here the map you beauty 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.629
 first you go there you will dedicate to cni 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:42.989
 This business is emeraude, you see. 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:46.920
 I think there are ten blocks 20 30 40 50 60 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:48.989
 70 80 90 and 100 hundred blocks certainly is 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.149
 very difficult i do not know 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.980
 So here or send it, I'll be there. 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.550
 showing even the first 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.199
 There you are training to fall on top of the 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.879
 vineyard that had let it show to you 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.760
 I'll do it 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:06.299
 the way to invest does not have to be 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:09.900
 good and uses the little render to see the 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:13.460
 life in the front gives in the face of each head 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:16.740
 and the ball is you jump and you train fall is 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:20.040
 new girl, I have not even been able to 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.590
 Are you surviving in hg from here? 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.229
 I know what's good about things. 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:28.920
 because I do not know what beauty is for 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:31.320
 But let's get this from here. 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.650
 This is for you to train as 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:39.119
 Phishing I believe I think it's this 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:43.770
 you come here from the 2 thousand tons of the ditch and 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:46.439
 these eggs here you train pull them 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:51.360
 And he's going to pull the message. 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:54.689
 fall here you train chelsea walks 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.070
 if you want to pull a friend in your 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:59.130
 tower 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:04.909
 I do not have it today and you have sunshine only fish 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:04.909
 afraid you can use it or delay 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:12.000
 see bush click here 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:15.150
 there it fell but now it 's different good here 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.130
 What do you want from a trip ? 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.680
 The one you break you enter here. 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:23.160
 down and breaks the business and shrouds 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:25.800
 in a super the guy is here you want 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.700
 down here there will drop everything's the guy 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.340
 falls and dies 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.440
 you have to do from a high height and 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:35.100
 even if the guy was that what I 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.750
 I want the guy will not die, so I will not 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.790
 I managed to do the sector and now everything here 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.770
 world is playing money than 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:46.290
 other drugs is not that I think he 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:49.230
 also made you here walking 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:51.390
 here leaves is best show out 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.730
 you will understand if you put these 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:03:01.430
 price plates here are you 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:03:05.850
 places these here ie the following 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:07.560
 running here too to disguise, huh? 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:09.900
 I came here like he can not 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:17.910
 cross here it will break here 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:21.329
 the floor and go studio if you or I do not 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:22.590
 I had to do it, but I thought it was fine. 

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:25.049
 interesting 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:28.260
 There's something I do not know. 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:32.519
 Here also there is here or here 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:33.930
 Even though I'm not going to show here, right? 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:38.480
 It's something that I taught you in the 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:41.459
 beginning of the video how to train the kraftwerk 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:43.560
 faster to do things in hg 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:46.769
 if you want to see, watch the first video 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:51.989
 this series that was what I think 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:55.430
 that I'm not sure I should be a boat 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:59.180
 I'll fly because I can never get here. 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:59.180
 to stop it 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:08.709
 I love this is a portal planet is not 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:11.290
 normal and has everything here too that is a 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:13.959
 tnt cannon you're already trained 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:16.870
 teams is playing with the gypsies to 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:18.549
 cmtc for you to put again and it 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:21.220
 blow you fly you see 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:24.190
 I do not know if I should have hit there or 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:26.950
 not one but here can also be used 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:30.340
 to show texture packing house is a 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:33.820
 creative phobia calls creative land 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:38.889
 I do not know if he created it but it's too much 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:42.490
 good this map and then I came back now it's going to give 

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:44.169
 Because you do not do it there, you want it here. 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:46.810
 water if you do not have creative is just 

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:51.400
 You put the tnt again I think 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:55.120
 so you remember how it is 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:58.780
 I think that here it is so O TNT and 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:00.820
 flies but okay is not over here I have not seen 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:03.490
 a lot of things even stayed in this area 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:05.650
 here then set out on a test and go 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:07.840
 Do you discover anything I think this? 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:09.870
 here is kind of a place to show 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:18.280
 texture right 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:20.260
 looks at my colleague assembling the structure one 

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:23.860
 much at the time I think it uses the same 

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:26.080
 that made a texture speech there being here 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:28.570
 It's the things you have for 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:36.250
 hunger games né thor jack's hammer 

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:40.090
 ip number is doctors than me but me 

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:42.700
 I think it 's a treasure that has a lady and 

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:45.639
 My god here scissors is a pair of scissors 

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:47.380
 so the priests here are the context of the 

00:05:45.639 --> 00:05:51.580
 beauty podium 

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:53.260
 Alex left then go and get the self. 

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:56.410
 I think I'll leave it in the description that 

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:58.030
 are the ores here but it's just 

00:05:56.410 --> 00:06:00.310
 I hope that you have 

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:02.410

 I will be very happy with this 

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:13.070
 I trained enough to watch bbb and 

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:15.290

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:17.480

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:19.700
 No, no, I do not have it right now. 

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:22.460

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:27.680

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:33.680
 I do not know how it is and what the pack 

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:37.070
 I so you put this block 

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:39.710
