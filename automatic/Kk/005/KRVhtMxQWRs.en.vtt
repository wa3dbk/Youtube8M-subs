 Translator: Maysoon Abbas Checker: Anwar Dafa-Alla 

00:00:07.188 --> 00:00:10.916
 Once, Norman McLaren, the great leader in 20th century animation technology, 

00:00:10.916 --> 00:00:13.793
 "Animation is not the art of moving graphics, 

00:00:13.793 --> 00:00:15.854
 But the art of the movements that draw. 

00:00:15.854 --> 00:00:18.213
 What happens between frames is more important 

00:00:18.213 --> 00:00:20.423
 Of what exists on every frame. " 

00:00:20.423 --> 00:00:22.520
 What was he meant? 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.352
 Well, for the emergence of something in motion, 

00:00:24.352 --> 00:00:27.354
 Its position must change over time. 

00:00:27.354 --> 00:00:29.643
 If the time passes and no change occurs in the site, 

00:00:29.643 --> 00:00:32.351
 The thing will appear steady. 

00:00:32.351 --> 00:00:34.398
 This relationship between the passage of time 

00:00:34.398 --> 00:00:36.854
 And the amount of change occurring at that time 

00:00:36.854 --> 00:00:39.520
 Is at the heart of all kinds of art based on time, 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.187
 Be it music, dance, or animations. 

00:00:43.187 --> 00:00:45.159
 Manipulation of speed and the amount of change 

00:00:45.159 --> 00:00:47.353
 Between tires is the secret of chemistry 

00:00:47.353 --> 00:00:51.271
 Which gives animation the ability to convey the imagination of life. 

00:00:51.271 --> 00:00:53.293
 In animation there are two basic principles 

00:00:53.293 --> 00:00:54.936
 We use them to do this: 

00:00:54.936 --> 00:00:57.461
 Timing and spacing. 

00:00:57.461 --> 00:00:59.463
 To clarify their relationship, 

00:00:59.463 --> 00:01:02.372
 We will use the eternal example: the jump ball. 

00:01:02.372 --> 00:01:04.534
 One way to think about timing 

00:01:04.534 --> 00:01:06.686
 Is that it is speed, or rhythm, 

00:01:06.686 --> 00:01:08.639
 When an event occurs. 

00:01:08.639 --> 00:01:10.140
 We determine the event speed 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.602
 The number of images, or frames, used to occur. 

00:01:13.602 --> 00:01:15.520
 The greater the number of frames for something, 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.187
 The more time it occurs on the screen, 

00:01:17.187 --> 00:01:20.696
 The more the event becomes slower. 

00:01:20.696 --> 00:01:23.157
 The lower the number of frames for something, 

00:01:23.157 --> 00:01:25.490
 The lower the display time on the screen, 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.687
 Which gives us a faster event. 

00:01:28.687 --> 00:01:31.045
 Timing is more than just that speed, 

00:01:31.045 --> 00:01:32.913
 It's also about rhythm. 

00:01:32.913 --> 00:01:34.668
 Such as tapping drums or existing melodies 

00:01:34.668 --> 00:01:36.375
 When a song is played, 

00:01:36.375 --> 00:01:37.521
 The timing of the event 

00:01:37.521 --> 00:01:39.545
 Only exists while it occurs. 

00:01:39.545 --> 00:01:41.047
 You can describe it with words, 

00:01:41.047 --> 00:01:44.966
 Say, something will take 6 frames, 18 frames and so on. 

00:01:44.966 --> 00:01:46.604
 But to get the meaning of it, 

00:01:46.604 --> 00:01:47.793
 You must implement it 

00:01:47.793 --> 00:01:51.335
 Or try it as it will in real time. 

00:01:51.335 --> 00:01:52.641
 Now, the timing of the event 

00:01:52.641 --> 00:01:54.436
 Will depend on the context of the scene 

00:01:54.436 --> 00:01:56.688
 And what you are trying to connect. 

00:01:56.688 --> 00:01:59.441
 What is the representation and why? 

00:01:59.441 --> 00:02:01.149
 Let's take our example. 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:03.153
 What makes the ball bounce? 

00:02:03.153 --> 00:02:04.404
 The event we are talking about here 

00:02:04.404 --> 00:02:07.169
 Is the result of the interaction of physical forces, 

00:02:07.169 --> 00:02:09.032
 Mill ball moving to stay in motion, 

00:02:09.032 --> 00:02:10.701
 Or force of payment 

00:02:10.701 --> 00:02:12.252
 Versus the force of fixed gravity 

00:02:12.252 --> 00:02:13.996
 Bring her back to earth. 

00:02:13.996 --> 00:02:16.041
 The degree to which these invisible forces are applied, 

00:02:16.041 --> 00:02:18.208
 The reason why the ball behaves the way it followed, 

00:02:18.208 --> 00:02:21.751
 It all depends on the physical properties of the ball. 

00:02:21.751 --> 00:02:26.252
 The golf ball is small, stiff and light. 

00:02:26.252 --> 00:02:31.168
 The rubber ball is small, soft and lighter. 

00:02:31.168 --> 00:02:35.501
 The beach ball is large, soft and light. 

00:02:35.501 --> 00:02:39.857
 Bowling is big, tough and heavy. 

00:02:39.857 --> 00:02:41.668
 Therefore, each ball behaves very differently, 

00:02:41.668 --> 00:02:44.153
 According to their characteristics. 

00:02:44.153 --> 00:02:50.118
 Let's get a sense of visual rhythm for each. 

00:02:50.118 --> 00:02:51.946
 Each ball beats its own beats 

00:02:51.946 --> 00:02:53.120
 Tell us something about her 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:03:05.881
 And the time it takes to navigate the screen. 

00:03:05.881 --> 00:03:09.752
 The visual rhythm of these strikes is timing. 

00:03:09.752 --> 00:03:11.418
 Well, let's start moving our card, 

00:03:11.418 --> 00:03:14.584
 Toss up and down with a simple cycle of graphics. 

00:03:14.584 --> 00:03:16.167
 We will draw a circle here, 

00:03:16.167 --> 00:03:18.476
 We call it point A, our starting point. 

00:03:18.476 --> 00:03:22.084
 We will make it hit the ground here, in point B. 

00:03:22.084 --> 00:03:23.648
 Let's say it takes about a second 

00:03:23.648 --> 00:03:25.985
 To hit the ground and come back again. 

00:03:25.985 --> 00:03:29.030
 This is our timing. 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:31.116
 The location where we put the circuit is our spacing 

00:03:31.116 --> 00:03:33.918
 In the frames between point A and point B. 

00:03:33.918 --> 00:03:35.335
 If we move our card 

00:03:35.335 --> 00:03:36.417
 In equally spaced increments, 

00:03:36.417 --> 00:03:38.502
 We'll get something like that. 

00:03:38.502 --> 00:03:41.668
 It does not tell us anything really about itself. 

00:03:41.668 --> 00:03:44.880
 Is it a ball or a circle on an elevator? 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.169
 Let's look at our footage again 

00:03:46.169 --> 00:03:47.297
 And think about what is happening 

00:03:47.297 --> 00:03:50.218
 Every time you bounce a ball. 

00:03:50.218 --> 00:03:52.168
 After each effect on the surface of the earth, 

00:03:52.168 --> 00:03:53.501
 Push up the ball 

00:03:53.501 --> 00:03:55.890
 It is overcome by gravity in the end. 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:57.834
 This happens at the top of each arc. 

00:03:57.834 --> 00:03:59.334
 Whenever things change direction, 

00:03:59.334 --> 00:04:01.104
 Motion is slower. 

00:04:01.104 --> 00:04:03.146
 Here we see the successive positions of the ball 

00:04:03.146 --> 00:04:04.917
 They are close to each other. 

00:04:04.917 --> 00:04:06.776
 The ball accelerates when it occurs, 

00:04:06.776 --> 00:04:08.110
 They are at maximum speed 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:10.112
 When approaching and hitting the ground. 

00:04:10.112 --> 00:04:13.251
 We can see here every site is spaced out. 

00:04:13.251 --> 00:04:14.993
 Change in location between frames 

00:04:14.993 --> 00:04:16.536
 Is the spacing. 

00:04:16.536 --> 00:04:17.870
 The smaller the change, 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:21.497
 The slower the event appears. 

00:04:21.497 --> 00:04:22.585
 The more change, 

00:04:22.585 --> 00:04:26.879
 The faster it appears. 

00:04:26.879 --> 00:04:28.381
 To slow the event, 

00:04:28.381 --> 00:04:33.265
 Each change in a site must be less than the change it accepted. 

00:04:33.265 --> 00:04:35.648
 Similarly, to speed up an event, or expedite it, 

00:04:35.648 --> 00:04:39.934
 Each successive change must be larger. 

00:04:39.934 --> 00:04:41.937
 Let's change the mechanics of spacing 

00:04:41.937 --> 00:04:43.403
 For our leapfrog 

00:04:43.403 --> 00:04:45.820
 To reflect what we saw in the footage. 

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:50.960
 Slow at the top, quick when hitting the ground. 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:52.863
 By adjusting the spacing simply, 

00:04:52.863 --> 00:04:54.564
 We succeeded in proposing 

00:04:54.564 --> 00:04:56.827
 Sturdy and attractive when operating 

00:04:56.827 --> 00:05:00.151
 We have achieved a much more realistic movement. 

00:05:00.151 --> 00:05:02.292
 Same timing but different spacing 

00:05:02.292 --> 00:05:06.377
 Gives us very different results. 

00:05:06.377 --> 00:05:07.965
 In fact, when the ball bounce, 

00:05:07.965 --> 00:05:10.005
 Ultimate gravity physics is defeated 

00:05:10.005 --> 00:05:12.549
 The direction of the ball to stay in motion. 

00:05:12.549 --> 00:05:14.376
 You can see this here at a decreasing height 

00:05:14.376 --> 00:05:16.555
 Each rebound follows. 

00:05:16.555 --> 00:05:18.805
 However, again, this decline is different 

00:05:18.805 --> 00:05:20.640
 According to the characteristics of the ball. 

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:23.436
 Although these circles are here the same size, 

00:05:23.436 --> 00:05:25.686
 Each of which tells us a story different from itself, 

00:05:25.686 --> 00:05:30.152
 On how to move them purely. 

00:05:30.152 --> 00:05:31.902
 Relationship between principles 

00:05:31.902 --> 00:05:33.402
 Timing and spacing 

00:05:33.402 --> 00:05:35.324
 Can be applied in countless ways 

00:05:35.324 --> 00:05:40.389
 Used to trigger all kinds of events: 

00:05:40.389 --> 00:05:43.874
 Yoyo, 

00:05:43.874 --> 00:05:46.959
 Punch, 

00:05:46.959 --> 00:05:49.587
 Cute pumpkin, 

00:05:49.587 --> 00:05:52.936
 Paid, 

00:05:52.936 --> 00:05:57.019
 saw, 

00:05:57.019 --> 00:06:03.019
 The sun travels through the sky, 

00:06:03.019 --> 00:06:05.730
 Pendulum. 

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:08.147
 Animation is an art form that is based on time. 

00:06:08.147 --> 00:06:09.980
 May include aesthetic elements 

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:11.268
 For other graphic arts, 

00:06:11.268 --> 00:06:12.851
 Such as illustrative or graphic art, 

00:06:12.851 --> 00:06:14.186
 But what makes the movement separate 

00:06:14.186 --> 00:06:16.018
 That is, what you see 

00:06:16.018 --> 00:06:18.851
 Less important than you do not see. 

00:06:18.851 --> 00:06:20.269
 The appearance of the external object alone 

00:06:20.269 --> 00:06:22.685
 He tells us a lot about himself. 

00:06:22.685 --> 00:06:23.954
 It is when it is in motion only 

00:06:23.954 --> 00:06:27.954
 Then we truly understand its nature.
