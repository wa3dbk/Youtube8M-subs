I<00:00:16.800> am<00:00:17.800> back<00:00:17.950> today<00:00:18.220> with<00:00:18.250> the<00:00:18.520> Russian<00:00:18.850> tanks

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:19.330 
I am back today with the Russian tanks

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:24.240 
I am back today with the Russian tanks
and<00:00:20.070> since<00:00:21.070> the<00:00:21.939> teeth<00:00:22.259> 4,400<00:00:23.259> t54<00:00:24.009> were

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:24.250 
and since the teeth 4,400 t54 were

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:27.720 
and since the teeth 4,400 t54 were
absent<00:00:24.759> from<00:00:25.000> a<00:00:25.180> t-34<00:00:25.810> video<00:00:26.580> because<00:00:27.580> they

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:27.730 
absent from a t-34 video because they

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:29.490 
absent from a t-34 video because they
are<00:00:27.939> a<00:00:28.180> little<00:00:28.330> too<00:00:28.660> different<00:00:29.110> to<00:00:29.289> be

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:29.500 
are a little too different to be

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.429 
are a little too different to be
included<00:00:30.099> in<00:00:30.579> the<00:00:30.790> same<00:00:31.000> video<00:00:31.329> with<00:00:31.660> the<00:00:31.750> t-34

00:00:32.429 --> 00:00:32.439

included in the same video with the t-34
series<00:00:32.920> I<00:00:33.160> am<00:00:34.120> going<00:00:34.360> to<00:00:34.480> make<00:00:34.600> a<00:00:34.660> short<00:00:34.960> little

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:35.110

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
series I am going to make a short little
video<00:00:35.500> today<00:00:36.000> about<00:00:37.000> the<00:00:37.059> g40<00:00:37.870> for<00:00:38.079> any<00:00:38.290> t54

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:39.130 
video today about the g40 for any t54

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:41.610 
video today about the g40 for any t54
they<00:00:39.969> are<00:00:40.090> actually<00:00:40.570> more<00:00:40.750> similar<00:00:41.320> than<00:00:41.350> you

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:41.620 
they are actually more similar than you

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:47.430 
they are actually more similar than you
may<00:00:41.770> think<00:00:41.800> in<00:00:42.540> fact<00:00:43.540> d<00:00:43.809> t54<00:00:44.910> has<00:00:45.910> a<00:00:46.440> chassis

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:47.440 
may think in fact d t54 has a chassis

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.560 
may think in fact d t54 has a chassis
and<00:00:47.650> the<00:00:47.980> life<00:00:48.130> train<00:00:48.490> that<00:00:49.210> is<00:00:49.360> almost

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:49.570 
and the life train that is almost

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:54.240 
and the life train that is almost
identical<00:00:49.900> to<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:51.850> t44<00:00:52.600> i<00:00:52.810> am<00:00:53.620> now<00:00:53.800> going<00:00:54.070> to
