00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:15.809 
tighten down like that and you have a
wrench<00:05:13.150> on<00:05:13.360> it<00:05:13.509> do<00:05:13.990> not<00:05:14.020> use<00:05:14.470> this<00:05:14.860> as<00:05:15.520> your

lever to turn the valve if you warp this

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:24.860 
lever to turn the valve if you warp this
it<00:05:20.740> will<00:05:21.599> cause<00:05:22.599> the<00:05:22.900> valve<00:05:23.770> to<00:05:23.979> be<00:05:24.130> inoperable

back<00:06:10.229> up<00:06:10.410> into<00:06:10.590> the<00:06:10.770> valve<00:06:10.949> you'll<00:06:11.520> get<00:06:11.699> up

00:06:11.809 --> 00:06:11.819 
back up into the valve you'll get up

00:06:11.819 --> 00:06:14.029 
back up into the valve you'll get up
there<00:06:11.970> and<00:06:12.060> gum<00:06:12.240> it<00:06:12.389> up<00:06:12.509> so<00:06:13.289> always<00:06:13.500> put<00:06:13.830> your

00:06:14.029 --> 00:06:14.039 
there and gum it up so always put your

00:06:14.039 --> 00:06:18.230 
there and gum it up so always put your
your<00:06:14.880> sealant<00:06:15.840> on<00:06:16.289> the<00:06:16.500> pipe<00:06:17.009> and<00:06:17.310> not<00:06:17.849> on<00:06:18.120> the

valve okay we're going to go ahead and

00:06:23.669 --> 00:06:26.390 
valve okay we're going to go ahead and
pretend<00:06:23.789> that<00:06:24.180> we<00:06:24.330> pipe<00:06:24.599> it<00:06:24.780> up<00:06:24.900> on<00:06:25.710> both<00:06:26.039> ends

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:26.400 
pretend that we pipe it up on both ends

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:28.749 
pretend that we pipe it up on both ends
here<00:06:26.580> we're<00:06:26.849> ready<00:06:27.090> for<00:06:27.349> final<00:06:28.349> installation

here we're ready for final installation
going<00:06:29.759> to<00:06:29.820> put<00:06:29.970> the<00:06:30.090> spring<00:06:30.570> back<00:06:30.599> on<00:06:31.160> put<00:06:32.160> the

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:32.280 
going to put the spring back on put the

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:36.860 
going to put the spring back on put the
coil<00:06:32.580> back<00:06:32.940> on<00:06:34.310> put<00:06:35.310> the<00:06:35.490> nameplate<00:06:36.270> into

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:36.870 
coil back on put the nameplate into

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:39.890 
coil back on put the nameplate into
place<00:06:37.169> depress<00:06:38.039> that<00:06:38.070> we'll<00:06:38.940> slide<00:06:39.630> it<00:06:39.659> in<00:06:39.870> so

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:39.900 
place depress that we'll slide it in so

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:42.649 
place depress that we'll slide it in so
it<00:06:40.169> locks<00:06:40.470> and<00:06:40.889> then<00:06:41.849> just<00:06:42.060> to<00:06:42.150> keep<00:06:42.180> it<00:06:42.419> cute

00:06:42.649 --> 00:06:42.659 
it locks and then just to keep it cute

00:06:42.659 --> 00:06:45.529 
it locks and then just to keep it cute
we'll<00:06:43.139> put<00:06:43.349> the<00:06:43.470> red<00:06:43.620> cap<00:06:43.889> back<00:06:44.159> on<00:06:44.400> it<00:06:44.580> here

00:06:45.529 --> 00:06:45.539 
we'll put the red cap back on it here

00:06:45.539 --> 00:06:47.120 
we'll put the red cap back on it here
again<00:06:45.630> remember<00:06:46.110> that<00:06:46.259> red<00:06:46.440> cap<00:06:46.680> doesn't<00:06:47.039> do

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:47.130 
again remember that red cap doesn't do

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:50.540 
again remember that red cap doesn't do
anything<00:06:47.639> so<00:06:47.970> there<00:06:48.150> look<00:06:48.330> red<00:06:48.740> but<00:06:49.740> after<00:06:50.460> you

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:50.550 
anything so there look red but after you

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:52.339 
anything so there look red but after you
put<00:06:50.729> the<00:06:50.759> coil<00:06:51.060> on<00:06:51.300> then<00:06:51.659> you<00:06:51.780> can<00:06:51.930> wire<00:06:52.139> it<00:06:52.289> up

00:06:52.339 --> 00:06:52.349 
put the coil on then you can wire it up

00:06:52.349 --> 00:06:54.889 
put the coil on then you can wire it up
and<00:06:52.590> you're<00:06:52.770> done
