have two silhouettes like this and so I

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:13.570 
have two silhouettes like this and so I
chose<00:02:12.200> pictures<00:02:12.680> where<00:02:12.980> they<00:02:13.160> were<00:02:13.220> obviously

chose pictures where they were obviously

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.830 
chose pictures where they were obviously
facing<00:02:14.269> each<00:02:14.690> other<00:02:14.870> um<00:02:16.360> because<00:02:17.360> you<00:02:17.570> don't

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
facing each other um because you don't
