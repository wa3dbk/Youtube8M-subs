00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:11.030
 hello very nice today I bring you a video 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.440
 how to make a terrarium for turtles 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:18.470
 I'm going to say the materials 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:23.869
 a wooden box of 50 x 70 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:25.970
 and earth stone a light and most 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:28.189
 important a box now I'll 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:31.840
 I will show how was mine with the 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:31.840
 materials that I have told you 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:43.620
 that's how good the box that I have 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:46.660
 said is 50 x 70 50 in width and 70 in 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:49.360
 long good 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:52.760
 the earth you have to expand the whole 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:55.550
 the house looks 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:59.149
 from the floor to here are 10 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:02.660
 centimeters 10 centimeters good I would 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:06.500
 I recommend that it be earth 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:09.800
 and the sand or anything like that good here 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:13.040
 is your cart where I put your 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:14.920
 water because if they do not have water they can be 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:18.520
 dehydrate 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:23.290
 and even die good what I do not 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:26.049
 I said because I wanted to put a pot 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:27.580
 to put snails because to show your 

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:28.619
 cock once a week I give him 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:31.590
 snails 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:35.549
 good look 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:40.340
 their houses have to be of any 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:43.770
 size this time I did it with boxes 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:47.189
 trimmed all of this part all this 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:50.640
 part just like that I cut it 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:52.409
 because because if they can not stand going to enter 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.679
 the turtle 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:58.159
 Well what I told you light that 

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:58.159
 I have asked 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:05.479
 because I can not put it next to 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:08.179
 a window because I can not many 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:12.020
 people put them next to a 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:15.320
 window but I do not 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:19.250
 me so that turtles have a light 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:22.460
 they can sunbathe and all that they are 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:25.760
 calentitas I tell them I 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:28.550
 I recommend a light for me good I 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:31.280
 I still do not finish it in this Caesar I 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:34.430
 I still lack things but I could 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:36.470
 tell him how to finish it good as I have 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.500
 put a greeting there I have to 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:42.450
 finish the facilities 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:44.580
 in putting another light another and and another here 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:47.910
 good 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:50.670
 me where to put these three lights so that 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:54.140
 my turtle is then surrounded by light 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:56.060
 and up 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.430
 even though 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:02.160
 as if we are going to put a wood for 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:07.120
 that the temperature is preserved 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:09.700
 the temperature good and soon 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:12.890
 after the date of 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:16.060
 wintering me 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:16.060
 I will do it 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:23.500
 a ramp to put here 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.500
 a 

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:29.410
 a fish tank so that they can go to 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:33.270
 swim because 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:36.790
 that's the best thing for me good 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:39.610
 as it is called as you will see on earth 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:43.090
 that I have planted grass I do not know if not 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:44.980
 they can see there and here and in all 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:49.540
 parts 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:50.860
 good look at my turtle this is manuel el 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:53.710
 male 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:04:00.780
 and that the fifth day inside there 

00:03:53.710 --> 00:04:00.780
 it's manuela and turtles good look 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:06.690
 I'm going to give 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:11.340
 instructions how the command put together or 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:14.350
 point the woods a curtain and do the 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:17.080
 sign the truth or to sleep 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:19.630
 when the atony that at all fixed looks no 

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:22.270
 moves does not move 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:27.040
 well then empty the earth and the 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:30.090
 will start all over the box then 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:32.240
 they prepare to do 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:35.220
 their houses because it is very important 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:37.880
 because if not at night you can 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:40.880
 get to die from the cold 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:43.430
 your little pot of water 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:46.130
 and good if they want to put the light like me 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:48.440
 I told you because he who can not 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:52.640
 put it next to a window puts 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:55.710
 full of lights between two have good 

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:59.940
 friends that was all 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:03.440
