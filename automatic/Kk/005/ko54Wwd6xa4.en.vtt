00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.490
 hi girls the best pd today will be 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.509
 on the essence pigments it is decided to 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.250
 review these pigments 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.769
 because they are cheap, let's see if they are 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.349
 also valid but then meanwhile I tell you 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:17.160
 immediately that inside there are 2.3 of 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:19.890
 product and the price of two euros and 99 i 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.449
 colors are 18 i one or seven then 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.779
 I saw that some are linked more than 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.160
 pigments are glitter and very well too 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.720
 I did not take those pros 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.310
 however I show the colors I have 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:34.380
 I 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:40.280
 the number 2 pure and with the primer the 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:50.670
 number 12 pure with the chryler the number 16 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:54.809
 number 14 number 19 number 18 and number 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.430
 20 the part I said with prime in 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:00.030
 actually used their prime what 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.590
 they sell essence color harps however it is 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.730
 a kind of raw and transparent though 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.189
 you can use a beautiful cia 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.869
 beautiful any primer like 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.439
 you see they are beautiful intense anyway 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:12.299
 by all that with the first 

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:14.939
 obviously the quality of these pigments 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:18.869
 it is not equal to that of type pigments 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:22.740
 of the mac are however beautiful though 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:24.479
 they are not as three-dimensional as others 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.520
 pigments I have seen tend to be 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.710
 however you write but a little more 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.600
 however flat compared to others we say 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:34.189
 that to be pigments of 2 euros e 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:36.720
 99 are still really valid 

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:38.729
 mexico the primer lasts all day 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:42.210
 then you saw that I'm more on 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:44.159
 a little less intense, however, they are anyway 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:48.890
 I wanted the other nice pigments 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:53.159
 caused here the pigment number 14 that 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:55.619
 that strawberry smoothie to make 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.090
 this trick and I've used it quite a bit 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.469
 couple of times but above all the color 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.250
 which in absolute use more to the number 2 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:02.050
 because it is a beautiful color that 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.240
 then it changes depending on the light 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:06.460
 it looks brownish times bolsena a little 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.130
 more fishing is really very nice the 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:11.800
 my vote therefore for this product rule 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:14.590
 of kabul the half past seven and a half 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.540
 because some are a little less pigmented 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.280
 a little more difficult to use than others 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.560
 but they are beautiful especially for the 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.390
 price they have if you see how many those 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.830
 some particular way I recommend you 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.020
 take it especially as I have 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:32.590
 said i type this here 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:34.600
 this rose is and not one but it is very good 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.150
 name seen a rose so it really is 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:39.670
 really amazing as color and also 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.470
 this gray is beautiful facts not 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:45.870
 I'll try to do a better intense makeup 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.870
 load with this gray already beauties
