00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:11.790
 I think you have a staff 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:15.930
 very enriched 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:18.210
 that should be enhanced with the opportunity 

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:22.310
 that we have to be in cup semifinals 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.310
 liberators is not every day 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:29.349
 I think it's one of the instances of 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:32.050
 the few instances that remain for a 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:36.100
 goal that is really something very 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:39.040
 important and we have everything like to 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:40.840
 pull this forward and beat a 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.370
 difficult opponent 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.370
 in view of a cup final 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:46.720
 liberators then in that sense 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.570
 we are very calm because 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:51.400
 we know the team's team 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:54.309
 the players are all very involved 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:55.739
 very psyched to know that you are 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:58.840
 opportunities do not have to let them pass 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:01.180
 on the court the paper does not count in the 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:03.550
 paper and money 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:06.270
 simply what we do within the 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:09.030
 court what is worth 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.369
 whether we speak individually or 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.990
 last names I think tigers have a 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:18.149
 great roster with talented players 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:22.030
 many of them figures that have 

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:24.490
 highlighted in many in many clubs 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.950
 we as a staff must 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:29.049
 understand that inside the court is 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.240
 where we have to make ourselves strong to be 

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:34.770
 better than the rival and everyone has to 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:37.439
 make your talent available 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.840
 we have still had we have hierarchies 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:42.210
 we have trajectories but when it comes to 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.250
 playing is where you really have to do 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.890
 be worth that I think the humility of 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.319
 team and understanding that makes us each 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.789
 stronger times we do not believe ourselves better than 

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:52.540
 nobody simply wants to demonstrate 

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:55.840
 between the court 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:58.000
 I think we are in an opportunity 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.370
 only 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.860
 of what the institution tigers that what 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:04.210
 he has played many times to talk me 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.369
 of 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.990
 of the history of Mexico in the cup 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:09.850
 liberators of the teams I think that 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:12.580
 I do not know if it's the right time to 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:14.230
 do it I just have a lot 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.950
 confidence that we can achieve 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:19.980
 what other teams have not done 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.569
 if we understand that you have not been given 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.650
 the results the last seven 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:26.810
 matches 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:29.000
 that does not indicate that it is not a team 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.450
 with history a team with great 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.239
 players 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:36.730
 has gone through a good time has 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:39.040
 passed to us throughout all 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:40.709
 this time that also 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.810
 we have found a regularity 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:46.450
 results that to us we have to 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:49.050
 keep alert because in the instance of 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.780
 Liberators Cup 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:54.350
 is 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:57.110
 this trend results sometimes is not 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:03:00.069
 so significant and I think that as 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:02.240
 team the inter is a great team 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:05.300
 regardless of the present that is 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:08.630
 living for us is going to be something very 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:11.360
 very difficult the truth is very good 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:15.170
 with a lot of freedom to do their 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:16.610
 things to deploy their capabilities they 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:18.980
 have coupled very well with the 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:21.350
 workouts that I think are 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:24.140
 very supportive players are very 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:25.550
 intelligent and they are involved that that what 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:27.950
 important when one arrives at a new 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:30.890
 team know that the challenges are 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:34.160
 important and that the goals are are 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:36.170
 primordial in that aspect are 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:39.200
 leaving everything 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:42.730
 and good on our part too 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:46.010
 make them a little easier to adapt 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:49.580
 is a statistic really calls the 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:52.810
 attention but ultimately 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:55.599
 our desire to want to transcend 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:57.880
 goes beyond reading a statistic or 

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:59.800
 know something about a rival 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:02.200
 beyond that does not have that statistic 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:05.020
 we know that interest is a 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:08.560
 very difficult rival is a good team 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:10.420
 has to play is player selection 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:13.000
 with a lot of hierarchy a lot of talent 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:16.080
 so 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.080
 we are not prioritizing 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:20.959
 not even that long ago that 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:24.560
 He has lost few matches in the cup 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:26.180
 liberators but we with what 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:28.280
 that we have we can make a good 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:29.570
 match and bring us a good result more 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:33.949
 beyond the names that are in the 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:37.040
 campus always the objectives are to fight 

00:04:33.949 --> 00:04:39.830
 for the championships is not something new or 

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:42.169
 because one has come two or many 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:44.360
 players 

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:47.289
 if there is always a greater responsibility 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:49.340
 or the objectives are greater nowadays 

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:51.110
 we have this cup opportunity 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:55.240
 liberators that for many years 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:58.540
 I did not have tigers and then what is 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:02.140
 concachampions or tournament the league 

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:05.920
 same equal of the objectives look 

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:08.120
 transcend and seek the most 

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:10.580
 forever 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:14.020
 we understand that the responsibility is 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:16.760
 in those priorities as a team now 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:19.940
 obviously we try to 

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:21.870
 that does not go as well as possible or even 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:24.720
 better than he was not 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:26.420
 the tournament last year that we have 

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:28.700
 come to the end 

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:30.620
 that we have left leaders that good 

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:32.510
 we have been on the road but in 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:35.810
 definitive the balance has been very good 

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:37.850
 I hope we can improve it in this 

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:40.120
 semester and in the coming year many 

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:40.120
 Thank you
