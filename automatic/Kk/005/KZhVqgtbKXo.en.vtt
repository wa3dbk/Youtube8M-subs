00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:34.730
 In addition to saddle and handlebars form shoes 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:37.430
 and pedals the main contact point 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.960
 by human and bicycle the hospital system 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:41.780
 contributes a lot to the safety while cycling 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:45.110
 Experts are talking about the advantages 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:47.330
 a click system on the one hand 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:49.760
 we have an automatically correct one 

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:52.040
 Positioning the foot on the pedal 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.050
 we have a minimized risk of 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.460
 slipping off the pedal respectively 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:58.100
 an eliminated danger 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.989
 and we can definitely go after that 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.880
 the top of the rear pull on the pedal so the 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:04.989
 round also occurs what is one of the whole 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.989
 significant advantages 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.479
 tours and recreational riders and above all 

00:01:14.829 --> 00:01:18.520
 Everyday cyclists abstain from two 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:20.439
 often based on these benefits 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.360
 they are not afraid in time 

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:26.649
 to be able to click and they shy away from that 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:29.170
 lack of comfort from cycling with 

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:31.649
 shimano clicker we have the solution for 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:34.360
 both problems found 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:37.509
 shimano clicker is a shoe pedal 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:42.009
 system such as spd or spd 

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:44.890
 sl consists of ours 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:48.039
 on the other hand, the second part 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:50.890
 this system are the ctc deep 

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:52.569
 country tours the shimano click pedals 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:53.140
 have a significantly reduced again 

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:55.479
 tension 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.429
 they are 60 percent lighter than 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:59.799
 conventional spd pedals 

00:01:57.429 --> 00:02:02.500
 In addition, their trigger angle is essential 

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:05.289
 Less at 85 degrees, they give the 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:07.659
 Shoe free simultaneous click out 

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:09.459
 so no problem is the 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:12.220
 Matching cd shoes also offer 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:13.989
 special features shimano has become 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.940
 especially the theme of comfort 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:17.109
 dedicated and a special soles 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:20.109
 construction developed 

00:02:17.109 --> 00:02:22.390
 the sole consists basically of one 

00:02:20.109 --> 00:02:24.819
 ladder-shaped plate that's us 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:27.579
 have exactly where the stiffness 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:30.370
 a city â€‹â€‹hall must be given 

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:32.519
 a very strong over the pedal 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:35.350
 stiffened plate in the back area 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:39.549
 a narrow ladder shaped plate the 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:41.940
 the flexibility of the lateral ones is exactly what we are looking for 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:46.510
 flexibility and also the ride comfort 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:50.760
 a running shoe with stiffness 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.760
 The pedal plate of a radio connects 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:08.640
 the shimano clicker shoe pedal system 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.710
 solves the two known problems 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.890
 especially everyday and recreational riders 

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:14.970
 often have on the one hand 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:17.670
 difficulty clicking in mouse 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:20.240
 danger situations to another 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:23.600
 often lack of comfort 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:23.600
 designated radszuhn
