all<00:00:01.530> right<00:00:01.680> well<00:00:01.890> we've<00:00:02.070> been<00:00:02.220> having<00:00:02.909> a

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:03.090 
all right well we've been having a

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:05.720 
all right well we've been having a
little<00:00:03.360> bit<00:00:03.570> of<00:00:03.659> trouble<00:00:03.899> with<00:00:04.200> this<00:00:04.620> truck<00:00:05.100> it

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730 
little bit of trouble with this truck it

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:07.940 
little bit of trouble with this truck it
doesn't<00:00:06.029> want<00:00:06.120> to<00:00:06.210> start<00:00:06.420> sometimes<00:00:06.930> and<00:00:07.259> if

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
doesn't want to start sometimes and if

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:09.830 
doesn't want to start sometimes and if
you<00:00:08.099> crawl<00:00:08.400> under<00:00:08.700> it<00:00:08.760> and<00:00:09.030> tap<00:00:09.570> on<00:00:09.750> the

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
you crawl under it and tap on the

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.830 
you crawl under it and tap on the
solenoid<00:00:10.080> on<00:00:10.530> top<00:00:10.769> of<00:00:10.920> starter<00:00:11.340> it<00:00:12.269> seems<00:00:12.630> to

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
solenoid on top of starter it seems to

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.519 
solenoid on top of starter it seems to
start<00:00:13.130> so<00:00:14.240> today<00:00:15.240> I'm<00:00:15.839> going<00:00:15.960> to<00:00:16.020> go<00:00:16.170> ahead<00:00:16.260> and

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
start so today I'm going to go ahead and

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.710 
start so today I'm going to go ahead and
just<00:00:16.710> yank<00:00:17.250> that<00:00:17.490> starter<00:00:17.880> out<00:00:17.910> I've<00:00:18.480> got<00:00:18.690> a

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
just yank that starter out I've got a

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.769 
just yank that starter out I've got a
new<00:00:18.869> cylinder<00:00:19.230> it<00:00:20.300> I'm<00:00:21.300> going<00:00:21.480> to<00:00:21.539> go<00:00:21.660> ahead

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
new cylinder it I'm going to go ahead

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.679 
new cylinder it I'm going to go ahead
and<00:00:21.990> throw<00:00:22.080> that<00:00:22.350> in<00:00:23.300> it's<00:00:24.300> pretty

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
and throw that in it's pretty

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:31.070 
and throw that in it's pretty
straightforward<00:00:27.470> that<00:00:29.539> Scylla<00:00:30.539> 9<00:00:30.750> right<00:00:30.960> on

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
straightforward that Scylla 9 right on

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.459 
straightforward that Scylla 9 right on
top<00:00:31.320> is<00:00:31.590> one<00:00:31.769> what<00:00:32.640> I'm<00:00:32.759> gonna<00:00:33.050> be<00:00:34.050> replacing

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
top is one what I'm gonna be replacing

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.850 
top is one what I'm gonna be replacing
but<00:00:35.160> to<00:00:35.550> get<00:00:35.700> to<00:00:35.820> that<00:00:35.940> I<00:00:36.000> have<00:00:36.210> to<00:00:36.680> take<00:00:37.680> out

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
but to get to that I have to take out

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.810 
but to get to that I have to take out
the<00:00:37.980> entire<00:00:38.219> starter<00:00:38.760> I<00:00:39.410> do<00:00:40.410> believe<00:00:40.950> so<00:00:41.489> I'm

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
the entire starter I do believe so I'm

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.330 
the entire starter I do believe so I'm
going<00:00:41.969> to<00:00:42.000> pull<00:00:42.180> that<00:00:42.210> out<00:00:42.390> and<00:00:43.129> we'll<00:00:44.129> clean

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
going to pull that out and we'll clean

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.670 
going to pull that out and we'll clean
everything<00:00:44.730> up<00:00:44.850> put<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:45.899> new<00:00:46.020> solenoid<00:00:46.289> in

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
everything up put the new solenoid in

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.069 
everything up put the new solenoid in
and<00:00:46.890> hopefully<00:00:47.280> it'll<00:00:47.520> work<00:00:47.670> looks<00:00:48.629> like<00:00:48.719> just

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
and hopefully it'll work looks like just

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.450 
and hopefully it'll work looks like just
three<00:00:49.950> bolts<00:00:50.370> from<00:00:50.550> what<00:00:50.700> I<00:00:50.730> can<00:00:50.879> see<00:00:51.059> here

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:52.460 
three bolts from what I can see here

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.580 
three bolts from what I can see here
I'll<00:00:53.460> have<00:00:53.610> to<00:00:53.640> I<00:00:53.850> reach<00:00:54.120> my<00:00:54.270> hand<00:00:54.300> up<00:00:54.989> top<00:00:55.350> and

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
I'll have to I reach my hand up top and

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:56.569 
I'll have to I reach my hand up top and
make<00:00:55.680> sure<00:00:55.710> there's<00:00:55.949> not<00:00:56.100> more<00:00:56.250> but<00:00:56.489> I<00:00:56.520> think

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
make sure there's not more but I think

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.299 
make sure there's not more but I think
it's<00:00:56.879> only<00:00:57.030> three<00:00:57.360> and<00:00:57.719> then<00:00:58.559> we'll<00:00:58.770> get<00:00:59.160> on

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
it's only three and then we'll get on

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.099 
it's only three and then we'll get on
the<00:00:59.430> bench<00:00:59.640> and<00:00:59.940> you'll<00:01:00.090> be<00:01:00.210> able<00:01:00.300> to<00:01:00.480> see<00:01:00.660> it

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
the bench and you'll be able to see it

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.329 
the bench and you'll be able to see it
well<00:01:01.980> that<00:01:02.100> solenoid<00:01:02.520> comes<00:01:02.760> off<00:01:04.220> well<00:01:05.220> I've

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
well that solenoid comes off well I've

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.039 
well that solenoid comes off well I've
got<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.640> starter<00:01:06.000> out<00:01:06.150> it<00:01:06.450> wasn't<00:01:06.630> too<00:01:06.840> bad

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
got the starter out it wasn't too bad

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.060 
got the starter out it wasn't too bad
just<00:01:07.260> those<00:01:07.500> three<00:01:08.460> bolts<00:01:08.790> there<00:01:09.030> and<00:01:10.070> looking

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
just those three bolts there and looking

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.499 
just those three bolts there and looking
at<00:01:11.220> it<00:01:11.340> it's<00:01:11.780> it's<00:01:12.780> pretty<00:01:12.960> cruddy<00:01:13.290> but<00:01:14.509> looks

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
at it it's it's pretty cruddy but looks

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.499 
at it it's it's pretty cruddy but looks
like<00:01:15.810> there's<00:01:16.290> just<00:01:16.380> going<00:01:16.590> to<00:01:16.650> be<00:01:16.740> two<00:01:17.509> screws

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
like there's just going to be two screws

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:23.120 
like there's just going to be two screws
here<00:01:19.549> holding<00:01:20.549> that<00:01:20.700> in<00:01:20.880> and<00:01:21.590> then<00:01:22.590> of<00:01:23.070> course

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
here holding that in and then of course

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.700 
here holding that in and then of course
here<00:01:23.520> on<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.729> back<00:01:23.880> this<00:01:24.390> one<00:01:24.630> I<00:01:24.840> take<00:01:25.560> those

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
here on the back this one I take those

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.039 
here on the back this one I take those
off<00:01:25.979> and<00:01:26.189> then<00:01:26.310> that<00:01:26.909> whole<00:01:27.090> noose<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.810> whole

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
off and then that whole noose the whole

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.569 
off and then that whole noose the whole
solenoid<00:01:28.439> will<00:01:28.590> come<00:01:28.740> off<00:01:28.920> and<00:01:29.159> I<00:01:29.189> put<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.460> new

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
solenoid will come off and I put the new

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:35.060 
solenoid will come off and I put the new
one<00:01:29.700> on<00:01:29.840> and<00:01:30.840> it<00:01:31.530> looks<00:01:31.799> like<00:01:33.470> my<00:01:34.470> problem<00:01:34.890> was

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
one on and it looks like my problem was

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.480 
one on and it looks like my problem was
probably<00:01:35.490> just<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:37.100> corrosion<00:01:38.100> here<00:01:38.310> I

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
probably just the corrosion here I

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.460 
probably just the corrosion here I
thought<00:01:39.119> I<00:01:39.390> had<00:01:39.689> taken<00:01:40.290> this<00:01:42.110> cable<00:01:43.110> off<00:01:43.229> and

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
thought I had taken this cable off and

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.020 
thought I had taken this cable off and
cleaned<00:01:43.680> it<00:01:43.770> once<00:01:43.890> before<00:01:44.100> but<00:01:44.369> maybe<00:01:44.579> not<00:01:44.820> I

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
cleaned it once before but maybe not I

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.120 
cleaned it once before but maybe not I
don't<00:01:45.390> know<00:01:45.570> but<00:01:45.840> since<00:01:46.680> I<00:01:46.770> have<00:01:46.890> a<00:01:46.920> new<00:01:47.040> one

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
don't know but since I have a new one

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.530 
don't know but since I have a new one
here<00:01:47.340> I'm<00:01:47.790> gonna<00:01:47.909> go<00:01:48.060> ahead<00:01:48.119> and<00:01:48.210> throw<00:01:48.299> it<00:01:48.450> on

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
here I'm gonna go ahead and throw it on

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.350 
here I'm gonna go ahead and throw it on
oh<00:01:48.840> I'll<00:01:49.140> keep<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:49.470> old<00:01:49.649> one<00:01:50.240> because<00:01:51.240> it

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
oh I'll keep the old one because it

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.990 
oh I'll keep the old one because it
probably<00:01:51.540> still<00:01:52.049> works<00:01:52.310> but<00:01:53.310> since<00:01:53.610> I<00:01:53.729> got<00:01:53.850> it

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
probably still works but since I got it

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:54.920 
probably still works but since I got it
out<00:01:54.060> and<00:01:54.119> I<00:01:54.240> got<00:01:54.329> a<00:01:54.390> new<00:01:54.540> one<00:01:54.659> I'll<00:01:54.869> just

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
out and I got a new one I'll just

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.139 
out and I got a new one I'll just
replace<00:01:55.350> it<00:01:55.649> and<00:01:55.770> throw<00:01:56.490> it<00:01:56.520> back<00:01:56.729> in<00:01:56.969> and

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
replace it and throw it back in and

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.740 
replace it and throw it back in and
hopefully<00:01:57.270> that<00:01:57.509> will<00:01:57.570> solve<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:57.930> problem

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.130 

all<00:02:01.350> right<00:02:01.530> I<00:02:01.560> got<00:02:01.800> the<00:02:01.920> old<00:02:02.040> one<00:02:02.220> off<00:02:03.140> looks

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
all right I got the old one off looks

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.040 
all right I got the old one off looks
like<00:02:04.320> it's<00:02:04.470> got<00:02:04.560> a<00:02:04.590> shim<00:02:04.890> on<00:02:04.920> it<00:02:05.310> so<00:02:06.000> I'll<00:02:06.930> have

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:07.050 
like it's got a shim on it so I'll have

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:09.560 
like it's got a shim on it so I'll have
to<00:02:07.200> put<00:02:07.380> this<00:02:07.530> new<00:02:08.250> one<00:02:08.399> in<00:02:08.580> with<00:02:09.210> the<00:02:09.330> shim

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:09.570 
to put this new one in with the shim

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:14.570 
to put this new one in with the shim
they<00:02:09.750> supplied<00:02:10.140> and<00:02:12.020> the<00:02:13.020> bottom<00:02:13.410> look<00:02:14.310> pretty

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
they supplied and the bottom look pretty

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.760 
they supplied and the bottom look pretty
clean<00:02:14.790> there<00:02:15.060> but<00:02:15.720> the<00:02:15.870> top<00:02:16.050> is<00:02:16.080> obviously

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
clean there but the top is obviously

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:21.590 
clean there but the top is obviously
rust<00:02:17.040> into<00:02:17.250> nothing<00:02:17.690> and<00:02:18.690> this<00:02:20.390> strap<00:02:21.390> here

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
rust into nothing and this strap here

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.450 
rust into nothing and this strap here
doesn't<00:02:21.930> look<00:02:21.960> the<00:02:22.140> best<00:02:22.350> but<00:02:22.530> nothing<00:02:23.220> I<00:02:23.280> can

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:23.460 
doesn't look the best but nothing I can

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:25.610 
doesn't look the best but nothing I can
do<00:02:23.520> about<00:02:23.640> that<00:02:23.760> so<00:02:24.210> go<00:02:25.110> ahead<00:02:25.200> and<00:02:25.320> throw<00:02:25.530> it

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
do about that so go ahead and throw it

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.360 
do about that so go ahead and throw it
back<00:02:25.800> in<00:02:26.390> if<00:02:27.390> you<00:02:27.540> look<00:02:27.690> in<00:02:27.840> there<00:02:28.310> there's<00:02:29.310> a

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
back in if you look in there there's a

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.240 
back in if you look in there there's a
little<00:02:29.490> fork<00:02:29.850> Deeley<00:02:30.240> and<00:02:30.840> the<00:02:31.470> end<00:02:32.040> of<00:02:32.160> the

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
little fork Deeley and the end of the

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.120 
little fork Deeley and the end of the
solenoid<00:02:32.550> just<00:02:32.940> fits<00:02:33.120> right<00:02:33.209> in<00:02:33.420> there<00:02:34.130> and

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
solenoid just fits right in there and

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:36.500 
solenoid just fits right in there and
I'm<00:02:35.340> going<00:02:35.459> to<00:02:35.490> need<00:02:35.700> both<00:02:35.850> hands<00:02:36.120> to<00:02:36.390> make

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
I'm going to need both hands to make

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.300 
I'm going to need both hands to make
sure<00:02:36.690> I<00:02:36.720> get<00:02:36.840> the<00:02:37.110> shim<00:02:37.440> lined<00:02:37.709> up<00:02:37.890> right<00:02:38.070> but

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
sure I get the shim lined up right but

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.210 
sure I get the shim lined up right but
you<00:02:39.300> can<00:02:39.450> just<00:02:39.600> pop<00:02:39.780> that<00:02:40.050> right<00:02:40.260> in<00:02:41.130> there

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
you can just pop that right in there

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.340 
you can just pop that right in there
make<00:02:41.400> sure<00:02:41.430> it's<00:02:41.550> engaged<00:02:42.140> and<00:02:43.140> then<00:02:43.260> I'll

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
make sure it's engaged and then I'll

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.680 
make sure it's engaged and then I'll
rotate<00:02:43.650> the<00:02:43.830> shim<00:02:44.040> put<00:02:44.459> it<00:02:44.550> up<00:02:44.670> in<00:02:44.850> in<00:02:45.030> there

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
rotate the shim put it up in in there

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.730 
rotate the shim put it up in in there
and<00:02:45.930> tighten<00:02:46.380> it<00:02:46.500> down<00:02:48.170> well<00:02:49.170> there<00:02:49.290> it<00:02:49.410> is<00:02:49.530> all

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:49.740 
and tighten it down well there it is all

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.820 
and tighten it down well there it is all
installed<00:02:50.750> all<00:02:51.750> I<00:02:51.780> got<00:02:52.050> to<00:02:52.140> do<00:02:52.200> is<00:02:52.320> throw<00:02:52.800> it

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
installed all I got to do is throw it

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:54.980 
installed all I got to do is throw it
back<00:02:53.010> in<00:02:53.190> the<00:02:53.250> truck<00:02:53.520> before<00:02:54.450> I<00:02:54.570> get<00:02:54.810> it<00:02:54.900> in

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:54.990 
back in the truck before I get it in

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:56.390 
back in the truck before I get it in
there<00:02:55.140> and<00:02:55.230> attach<00:02:55.470> it<00:02:55.650> I'll<00:02:55.770> clean<00:02:55.980> off<00:02:56.130> the

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
there and attach it I'll clean off the

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.840 
there and attach it I'll clean off the
cable<00:02:56.910> that<00:02:57.180> goes<00:02:57.390> to<00:02:57.720> to<00:02:58.350> here<00:02:58.620> and<00:02:58.950> this<00:02:59.670> one

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
cable that goes to to here and this one

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:02.630 
cable that goes to to here and this one
here<00:03:00.350> hopefully<00:03:01.350> will<00:03:01.440> work<00:03:01.470> good<00:03:01.830> I<00:03:02.040> think<00:03:02.160> I

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
here hopefully will work good I think I

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.180 
here hopefully will work good I think I
think<00:03:03.120> this<00:03:03.240> one<00:03:03.420> was<00:03:03.620> just<00:03:04.620> a<00:03:04.739> bad<00:03:04.890> connection

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
think this one was just a bad connection

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:08.810 
think this one was just a bad connection
maybe<00:03:05.870> so<00:03:06.870> rusty<00:03:07.320> they're<00:03:07.670> probably<00:03:08.670> a<00:03:08.700> good

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.820 
maybe so rusty they're probably a good

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:12.530 
maybe so rusty they're probably a good
idea<00:03:08.880> to<00:03:09.239> get<00:03:09.330> a<00:03:09.390> new<00:03:09.600> one<00:03:09.750> but<00:03:11.180> whatever<00:03:12.180> we'll

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
idea to get a new one but whatever we'll

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.460 
idea to get a new one but whatever we'll
throw<00:03:12.690> back<00:03:12.900> in<00:03:13.110> and<00:03:13.290> hopefully<00:03:13.530> it'll<00:03:13.650> work

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
throw back in and hopefully it'll work

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:17.780 
throw back in and hopefully it'll work
all<00:03:16.470> right<00:03:16.650> it's<00:03:16.830> the<00:03:16.860> moment<00:03:16.920> of<00:03:17.250> truth<00:03:17.310> let's

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
all right it's the moment of truth let's

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.960 
all right it's the moment of truth let's
see<00:03:17.910> if<00:03:18.000> it<00:03:18.090> starts

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
see if it starts

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:23.060 
see if it starts
should<00:03:20.970> I<00:03:21.000> have<00:03:21.209> the<00:03:21.300> keys<00:03:21.540> ready<00:03:21.840> come<00:03:22.230> on<00:03:22.380> on

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
should I have the keys ready come on on

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:30.920 
should I have the keys ready come on on
your<00:03:23.160> game

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:36.620 

well<00:03:33.540> hey<00:03:34.540> looks<00:03:35.380> like<00:03:35.590> I'm<00:03:35.710> going<00:03:35.860> to<00:03:35.920> have<00:03:36.040> to

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
well hey looks like I'm going to have to

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:40.950 
well hey looks like I'm going to have to
look<00:03:37.630> a<00:03:37.720> little<00:03:37.810> further<00:03:39.450> well<00:03:40.450> I've<00:03:40.630> got<00:03:40.810> the

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:40.960 
look a little further well I've got the

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:44.340 
look a little further well I've got the
starter<00:03:41.650> out<00:03:41.680> again<00:03:42.070> and<00:03:42.310> I<00:03:43.030> think<00:03:43.720> I<00:03:44.080> may<00:03:44.230> have

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:44.350 
starter out again and I think I may have

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:48.930 
starter out again and I think I may have
found<00:03:44.530> my<00:03:44.770> problem<00:03:45.190> that<00:03:46.260> cable<00:03:47.260> there<00:03:47.910> that<00:03:48.910> I

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:48.940 
found my problem that cable there that I

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:52.020 
found my problem that cable there that I
was<00:03:49.120> worried<00:03:49.390> about<00:03:49.570> before<00:03:49.750> fell<00:03:50.590> off<00:03:51.030> it

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
was worried about before fell off it

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:54.770 
was worried about before fell off it
just<00:03:52.300> disintegrated<00:03:52.959> and<00:03:53.200> came<00:03:53.350> apart<00:03:53.680> and

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
just disintegrated and came apart and

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.360 
just disintegrated and came apart and
I'm<00:03:55.780> assuming<00:03:56.080> that's<00:03:56.530> what<00:03:56.800> it<00:03:56.890> was<00:03:57.040> I<00:03:57.250> was

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370 
I'm assuming that's what it was I was

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:58.470 
I'm assuming that's what it was I was
kind<00:03:57.490> of<00:03:57.520> worried<00:03:57.760> about<00:03:57.790> it<00:03:57.940> when<00:03:58.120> I<00:03:58.150> put<00:03:58.330> the

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480 
kind of worried about it when I put the

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.890 
kind of worried about it when I put the
new<00:03:59.220> solenoid<00:04:00.220> in<00:04:00.400> but<00:04:00.640> turns<00:04:01.570> out<00:04:01.690> that's

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900 
new solenoid in but turns out that's

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.590 
new solenoid in but turns out that's
what<00:04:02.020> it<00:04:02.110> was<00:04:02.260> I<00:04:03.040> don't<00:04:03.640> have<00:04:04.030> any<00:04:04.180> starters

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:04.600 
what it was I don't have any starters

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.990 
what it was I don't have any starters
like<00:04:04.750> this<00:04:04.930> laying<00:04:05.140> around<00:04:05.700> so<00:04:06.700> I'm<00:04:06.820> going<00:04:06.940> to

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.000 
like this laying around so I'm going to

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.650 
like this laying around so I'm going to
pull<00:04:07.180> it<00:04:07.209> apart<00:04:07.360> and<00:04:08.100> and<00:04:09.150> see<00:04:10.150> if<00:04:10.300> I<00:04:10.420> have

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:10.660 
pull it apart and and see if I have

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:12.870 
pull it apart and and see if I have
anything<00:04:10.930> that<00:04:11.380> I<00:04:11.860> can<00:04:12.010> substitute<00:04:12.280> for<00:04:12.850> that

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:12.880 
anything that I can substitute for that

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:16.890 
anything that I can substitute for that
laying<00:04:13.360> around<00:04:14.130> otherwise<00:04:15.720> I'm<00:04:16.720> going<00:04:16.840> to

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:16.900 
laying around otherwise I'm going to

should have looked at it before it and
bought<00:05:24.260> parts<00:05:24.620> to<00:05:24.800> throw<00:05:24.979> at<00:05:25.190> it<00:05:25.340> but<00:05:25.780> that<00:05:26.780> was

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:30.800 
you know it was I thought it was a

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:32.200 
you know it was I thought it was a
solenoid<00:05:31.160> but<00:05:31.460> it<00:05:31.550> was<00:05:31.639> actually<00:05:32.000> the<00:05:32.090> wire

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:32.210 
solenoid but it was actually the wire

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:35.980 
solenoid but it was actually the wire
going<00:05:32.479> to<00:05:32.690> it<00:05:32.810> so<00:05:33.370> yeah<00:05:34.370> I<00:05:34.810> don't<00:05:35.810> know<00:05:35.960> the

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:35.990 
going to it so yeah I don't know the

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:38.230 
going to it so yeah I don't know the
main<00:05:36.410> thing<00:05:36.650> is<00:05:36.740> it's<00:05:36.919> fixed<00:05:37.190> now<00:05:37.250> and<00:05:38.120> it

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:38.240

main thing is it's fixed now and it
works<00:05:38.449> and<00:05:38.870> should<00:05:39.440> be<00:05:39.590> reliable<00:05:39.860> and<00:05:40.610> you

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:40.669 
works and should be reliable and you

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:42.820 
works and should be reliable and you
pull<00:05:40.880> it<00:05:40.970> out<00:05:41.060> of<00:05:41.120> here<00:05:41.389> and<00:05:41.570> bring<00:05:42.380> that<00:05:42.500> Buick
