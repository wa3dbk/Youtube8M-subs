00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:40.040 
true for real madrid and equalized now i
actually<00:04:38.370> thought<00:04:38.520> this<00:04:38.729> was<00:04:38.970> offside<00:04:39.419> if<00:04:39.900> you

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
actually thought this was offside if you

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:41.719 
actually thought this was offside if you
notice<00:04:40.349> i<00:04:40.440> sorta<00:04:40.919> just<00:04:41.099> switched<00:04:41.370> off<00:04:41.550> my

00:04:41.719 --> 00:04:41.729 
notice i sorta just switched off my

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:43.100 
notice i sorta just switched off my
defender<00:04:42.120> i<00:04:42.150> wasn't<00:04:42.479> really<00:04:42.569> playing<00:04:42.840> to<00:04:43.020> the

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.110 
defender i wasn't really playing to the

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:44.809 
defender i wasn't really playing to the
whistle<00:04:43.440> like<00:04:43.530> you're<00:04:43.740> supposed<00:04:43.979> to<00:04:44.190> but<00:04:44.789> i

00:04:44.809 --> 00:04:44.819 
whistle like you're supposed to but i

00:04:44.819 --> 00:04:46.610 
whistle like you're supposed to but i
just<00:04:45.210> assumed<00:04:45.539> it<00:04:45.599> was<00:04:45.720> offside<00:04:46.080> it<00:04:46.229> wasn't

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:46.620 
just assumed it was offside it wasn't

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:47.779 
just assumed it was offside it wasn't
unfortunately<00:04:47.190> and<00:04:47.310> that's<00:04:47.430> the<00:04:47.550> equalizer

00:04:47.779 --> 00:04:47.789 
unfortunately and that's the equalizer

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:50.629 
unfortunately and that's the equalizer
for<00:04:48.090> real<00:04:48.330> madrid<00:04:48.780> it's<00:04:49.199> also<00:04:49.500> an<00:04:49.979> away<00:04:50.310> goal

00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:50.639 
for real madrid it's also an away goal

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:52.580 
for real madrid it's also an away goal
so<00:04:50.970> that's<00:04:51.180> pretty<00:04:51.419> that's<00:04:51.539> that's<00:04:52.259> precious

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:52.590

thankfully our defense closed him down
enough<00:05:07.349> so<00:05:07.530> that<00:05:07.560> he<00:05:07.680> had<00:05:07.919> to<00:05:08.069> shoot<00:05:08.250> from

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:08.400 
enough so that he had to shoot from

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:09.980 
enough so that he had to shoot from
range<00:05:08.699> and<00:05:09.000> even<00:05:09.449> though<00:05:09.539> it<00:05:09.630> was<00:05:09.720> a<00:05:09.750> pretty

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:09.990 
range and even though it was a pretty

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:11.870 
range and even though it was a pretty
good<00:05:10.110> shot<00:05:10.409> from<00:05:10.590> range<00:05:10.860> it<00:05:11.190> was<00:05:11.430> still<00:05:11.639> saved

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:11.880 
good shot from range it was still saved

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:13.580 
good shot from range it was still saved
by<00:05:12.030> Joe<00:05:12.240> hat<00:05:12.449> so<00:05:12.659> that's<00:05:12.840> not<00:05:12.960> too<00:05:13.020> bad<00:05:13.169> and

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:13.590 
by Joe hat so that's not too bad and

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:08.940 
like that i don't really think that's

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:10.580 
like that i don't really think that's

this episode at TI go silver there i

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:16.580 
this episode at TI go silver there i
know<00:07:14.490> a<00:07:14.760> lot<00:07:14.850> of<00:07:15.030> people<00:07:15.150> were<00:07:15.630> like<00:07:16.230> still

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:16.590 
know a lot of people were like still

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:18.710 
know a lot of people were like still
just<00:07:17.100> determined<00:07:18.000> to<00:07:18.120> let<00:07:18.240> me<00:07:18.390> know<00:07:18.480> that<00:07:18.660> he

00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:18.720 
just determined to let me know that he

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:20.180 
just determined to let me know that he
was<00:07:18.810> a<00:07:18.870> bad<00:07:19.020> timing<00:07:19.260> but<00:07:19.380> like<00:07:19.650> I<00:07:19.770> honestly

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:20.190 
was a bad timing but like I honestly

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:22.340 
was a bad timing but like I honestly
think<00:07:20.370> he's<00:07:20.580> still<00:07:20.760> a<00:07:20.820> good<00:07:21.000> signing<00:07:21.270> if<00:07:21.600> I

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:22.350 
think he's still a good signing if I

00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:24.470 
think he's still a good signing if I
think<00:07:22.860> it's<00:07:22.980> a<00:07:23.070> kind<00:07:23.550> of<00:07:23.670> realistic<00:07:24.030> signing

00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:24.480 
think it's a kind of realistic signing

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:25.850 
think it's a kind of realistic signing
to<00:07:24.600> in<00:07:24.780> the<00:07:24.870> sense<00:07:25.080> that<00:07:25.170> he<00:07:25.410> has<00:07:25.500> a<00:07:25.530> reputation

00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:25.860 
to in the sense that he has a reputation

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:28.160 
to in the sense that he has a reputation
for<00:07:26.190> being<00:07:26.370> a<00:07:26.610> rock<00:07:26.850> and<00:07:27.120> we<00:07:27.420> can<00:07:27.600> sign<00:07:27.870> him<00:07:27.900> to

00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:47.120 
and youngsters like stones in mira tory
and<00:07:45.060> i<00:07:45.960> don't<00:07:46.140> know<00:07:46.200> i<00:07:46.230> just<00:07:46.350> i<00:07:46.620> think<00:07:46.650> the<00:07:46.950> team

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:47.130 
and i don't know i just i think the team

00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:48.710 
and i don't know i just i think the team
lineup<00:07:47.370> is<00:07:47.580> really<00:07:47.880> good<00:07:48.030> now<00:07:48.210> i<00:07:48.240> think<00:07:48.360> if<00:07:48.630> i

00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:48.720 
lineup is really good now i think if i

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:50.330 
lineup is really good now i think if i
can<00:07:48.870> find<00:07:49.020> some<00:07:49.290> form<00:07:49.530> of<00:07:49.650> consistency<00:07:50.310> i

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:50.340 
can find some form of consistency i

00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:52.190 
can find some form of consistency i
think<00:07:50.610> maybe<00:07:50.820> change<00:07:51.210> in<00:07:51.330> my<00:07:51.450> formation<00:07:51.810> every

00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:52.200 
think maybe change in my formation every

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:54.170 
think maybe change in my formation every
few<00:07:52.350> games<00:07:52.590> might<00:07:53.310> be<00:07:53.460> a<00:07:53.490> good<00:07:53.670> idea<00:07:53.730> as<00:07:54.150> well

00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:54.180 
few games might be a good idea as well

00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:55.610
