it's going to cook in no time so we're

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:52.749 
it's going to cook in no time so we're
going<00:01:50.840> to<00:01:50.899> add<00:01:51.079> just<00:01:51.679> a<00:01:51.859> little<00:01:51.890> bit<00:01:52.189> of<00:01:52.310> water

should<00:02:01.579> completely<00:02:02.240> dry<00:02:02.509> out<00:02:02.560> so<00:02:03.560> that's<00:02:03.770> what

00:02:04.059 --> 00:02:04.069 
should completely dry out so that's what

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:09.400 
should completely dry out so that's what
we<00:02:04.250> want<00:02:06.880> this<00:02:07.880> will<00:02:08.090> take<00:02:08.239> hardly<00:02:08.450> 5<00:02:09.080> to<00:02:09.229> 10

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
we want this will take hardly 5 to 10

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.240 
we want this will take hardly 5 to 10
minutes<00:02:09.709> to<00:02:09.769> cook<00:02:10.330> so<00:02:11.330> you<00:02:11.390> place<00:02:11.660> a<00:02:11.690> cover<00:02:11.959> and

minutes to cook so you place a cover and

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:19.680 
minutes to cook so you place a cover and
allow<00:02:13.250> this<00:02:13.519> to<00:02:13.580> cook<00:02:13.790> on<00:02:13.940> a<00:02:13.970> medium<00:02:14.060> flame

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.170 

after<00:02:20.440> 5-10<00:02:20.650> minutes<00:02:21.190> once<00:02:21.490> the<00:02:21.670> greens<00:02:21.910> has

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.480 
after 5-10 minutes once the greens has
cooked<00:02:22.450> it's<00:02:22.960> obviously<00:02:23.740> going<00:02:23.980> to<00:02:24.040> change<00:02:24.340> in

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:24.490 
cooked it's obviously going to change in

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:28.020 
cooked it's obviously going to change in
color<00:02:24.730> and<00:02:26.040> the<00:02:27.040> water<00:02:27.250> would<00:02:27.490> have<00:02:27.700> dried<00:02:28.000> out

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
color and the water would have dried out

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.960 
color and the water would have dried out
now<00:02:28.480> at<00:02:29.440> this<00:02:29.590> point<00:02:29.860> you<00:02:30.460> just<00:02:30.670> fry<00:02:30.910> the

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
now at this point you just fry the

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.050 
now at this point you just fry the
greens<00:02:31.330> for<00:02:31.600> five<00:02:31.780> minutes<00:02:32.290> and<00:02:33.000> allow<00:02:34.000> the
