00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.630
 hello very good I'm here a week 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.790
 more with a new video in this case for 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.740
 show you to teach how to do this 

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:21.630
 lamp that would get them through 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.220
 social interests like facebook you have 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.759
 I could see that I already remember you 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.890
 images in this case and as I promised you 

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:31.439
 I'm going to show you how to do it 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:34.290
 lamp as you can see very very simple 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:37.170
 with any reason on your screen 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.210
 totally customizable and very very 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.219
 cheap since we use most of it 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.320
 of materials are recycled according 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.570
 as always and first of all it presents 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.270
 the matters that we will need a 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.100
 ice cream box 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:51.140
 preferably and you are of a good size 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.270
 so that it allows us to enter the 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.220
 light bulb inside from the 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:57.260
 liters histories cardboard 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:59.960
 approximately 180 grams or 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.550
 superior paper vegetable applicator 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.430
 Double-sided adhesive tape 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:07.580
 lampholder electric cable and plug 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:09.830
 a bulb preferably led a 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:12.290
 star screwdriver and finally 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:14.030
 miniature tweezers first 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.710
 we take our box of ice cream 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.810
 the lid we go around our house 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.759
 on the side and we made a dead where 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.460
 let's make the cut to be able 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:24.229
 insert the cable mark as you can 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.290
 see will be located on the inside 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:28.940
 of the box always centered and about two 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.979
 centimeters from the bottom edge to 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:31.490
 then with a cutter we cut both 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:33.890
 brands 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.110
 you can see how it can be from below 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.820
 the plastic that they remember to enter 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.649
 in the cable below we are going to 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.180
 perform the pregnancy cover completely 

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:43.310
 customizable so that you can 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.840
 enter any image or time that 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.240
 you want the one you like the most 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:50.119
 for this we need a piece of cardboard 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:52.850
 of approximately 30 centimeters x 30 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:54.409
 cents we mark the perimeter once 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:58.270
 we have set the price within 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:02:00.490
 the box we cut with scissors 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:03.520
 once the frame of the lamp has been cut 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:05.740
 we have to draw the image or drawing 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.840
 that we want well as you can 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.849
 see I have already prepared the drawing that 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.980
 decided to perform once we have 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:14.080
 rita de linguas try not to make them 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.060
 place the tissue paper for it that 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.580
 we need a sheet or piece of paper 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:21.250
 vegetable adhesive double-sided adhesive 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:25.170
 we apply a strip around the perimeter 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.170
 of double-sided offensive glue 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.860
 we locate vegetal paper once we have 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.930
 placed the vegetable paper we will get 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.670
 that the light passes through it but without 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.230
 However, we can not see the inside of the 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.170
 box where we have the light bulb 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:43.319
 lamp holder the cable according 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.910
 As you can see fits perfectly to 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:47.130
 through these pieces what 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:49.270
 we get is to fasten the lid to 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.740
 side stand 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:52.630
 and it will allow us to change in any 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:55.840
 moment of this stage that we have designed 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:57.790
 on the other the xerez then we went 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.740
 to the electric part in our campaign 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:02.950
 For this we need lampholders 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:05.560
 electrical cord and the plug in this 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:07.630
 case go together in the case that no 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.310
 have electric cable windows already attached 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:11.020
 you can buy the plug and 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:14.230
 on the other hand the cable and or screwdriver 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:16.210
 and bulb preferably led rimmer what 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:18.370
 We need box already have 

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:19.960
 made our slot in which we're going to 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.910
 introduce our before we pull the 

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:23.110
 cable out to have enough 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:24.880
 and do it with community 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:26.980
 then we dismantled our 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.360
 lampholder preferably famoseo 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.430
 make it flat because in this way 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.870
 will perfectly support the base for 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:33.970
 then go well with an adhesive 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:36.040
 in double- sided droplet 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.600
 according to you want is that you are disassembled 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.070
 we simply connect the cable that 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.960
 we have taken out through the box 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:43.650
 we put the head again and 

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:43.650
 screw moss 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:47.400
 we have our door ready to 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.990
 appear at the edge of the cable to fix 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.180
 our lamp socket to the base of the 

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:53.040
 box and adopted by glue we have a 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:55.530
 site we just apply a little bit 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.810
 from silicone to the base of the lampholder 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.940
 we would have our poet to fix 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:02.130
 our base then only 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:03.560
 we have to touch the light bulb as a people 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:06.600
 already our bulb is placed 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:09.210
 we would only be able to locate the climate 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:11.760
 from the box the lid designed by us 

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:13.620
 As I say, you can design as many 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:15.090
 you want and exchange them so many times 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.340
 as you have since I have decided 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:19.260
 place miniature pliers with 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:21.150
 three is enough now simply 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:23.520
 we have to plug it in to check that 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:26.160
 really work as you can see 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:28.170
 works perfectly advise you 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.820
 also in case you use a 

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:32.970
 lamp that releases much more heat 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:36.300
 Perform drilling to guarantee 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:38.940
 which is the inner part is refrigerated 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:39.849
 preventing it from overheating 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:41.710
 too 

00:04:39.849 --> 00:04:43.720
 our box 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:45.790
 I hope you liked this tutorial 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:47.590
 to realize this lamp I hope with 

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:49.900
 I really want you to do it 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:53.260
 because as you can see the result is 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:55.690
 very good costs very little money is 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:57.760
 very easy to do and the result leaves 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:59.170
 very satisfied many thanks to
