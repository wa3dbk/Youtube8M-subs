these videos is we get to look back and

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:02.750 
these videos is we get to look back and
see<00:04:01.560> where<00:04:01.739> we<00:04:01.920> might<00:04:02.099> have<00:04:02.159> gone<00:04:02.430> wrong<00:04:02.610> in

see where we might have gone wrong in
certain<00:04:03.060> situations<00:04:03.750> and<00:04:03.870> this<00:04:04.080> is<00:04:04.260> one<00:04:04.470> in

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
certain situations and this is one in

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.289 
certain situations and this is one in
particular<00:04:05.040> as<00:04:05.370> the<00:04:05.519> keeper<00:04:05.819> throws<00:04:06.030> it<00:04:06.180> out

to<00:04:06.450> number<00:04:06.629> 60<00:04:07.110> I<00:04:07.140> assume<00:04:07.470> is<00:04:07.590> the<00:04:07.680> right<00:04:07.860> back

00:04:08.059 --> 00:04:08.069 
to number 60 I assume is the right back

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:10.039 
to number 60 I assume is the right back
as<00:04:08.220> he<00:04:08.310> brings<00:04:08.459> it<00:04:08.670> forward<00:04:08.909> unchallenged<00:04:09.840> all

00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:10.049

as he brings it forward unchallenged all
the<00:04:10.200> way<00:04:10.319> to<00:04:10.379> the<00:04:10.620> halfway<00:04:10.830> line<00:04:11.040> he<00:04:11.370> puts<00:04:11.610> the

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730 
the way to the halfway line he puts the

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:16.040 
the way to the halfway line he puts the
ball<00:04:11.939> over<00:04:12.209> the<00:04:12.480> top<00:04:12.720> and<00:04:12.870> then<00:04:13.080> this<00:04:13.290> happens
