week of the year so that's very much for
like<00:02:08.709> younger<00:02:11.970> I<00:02:12.970> mean<00:02:13.239> it's<00:02:13.510> a<00:02:13.750> I<00:02:14.110> mean<00:02:14.290> it's

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
like younger I mean it's a I mean it's

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.080 
like younger I mean it's a I mean it's
great<00:02:14.560> because<00:02:14.709> you<00:02:14.980> can<00:02:15.220> imagine<00:02:15.370> for<00:02:16.060> a

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
great because you can imagine for a

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.050 
great because you can imagine for a
personal<00:02:16.660> start<00:02:16.840> in<00:02:17.670> somebody's<00:02:18.670> her<00:02:18.790> pool<00:02:18.970> is

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
personal start in somebody's her pool is

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.479 
personal start in somebody's her pool is
in<00:02:19.090> the<00:02:19.239> first<00:02:19.480> book<00:02:19.629> coming<00:02:20.319> here<00:02:20.560> getting

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:21.489 
in the first book coming here getting

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:23.789 
in the first book coming here getting
the<00:02:21.610> books<00:02:21.760> early<00:02:22.030> so<00:02:22.090> it's<00:02:23.079> a<00:02:23.170> big<00:02:23.319> push<00:02:23.530> for

00:02:23.789 --> 00:02:23.799 
the books early so it's a big push for

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:26.720 
the books early so it's a big push for
doing<00:02:24.099> our<00:02:24.220> ears<00:02:24.430> and<00:02:24.930> get<00:02:25.930> exposure<00:02:26.260> and

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
doing our ears and get exposure and

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.039 
doing our ears and get exposure and
right<00:02:27.730> now<00:02:27.819> here<00:02:28.060> there's<00:02:28.299> a<00:02:28.329> thousands<00:02:28.959> of

00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:29.049 
right now here there's a thousands of

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:31.380 
right now here there's a thousands of
people<00:02:29.290> come<00:02:29.470> in<00:02:29.590> every<00:02:29.829> day<00:02:30.190> they<00:02:30.970> get<00:02:31.120> to<00:02:31.269> see

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
people come in every day they get to see

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:36.259 
people come in every day they get to see
your<00:02:31.510> work<00:02:31.780> they<00:02:32.019> get<00:02:32.170> to<00:02:32.260> see<00:02:32.410> your<00:02:33.250> practice

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:39.150 

photo<00:02:37.269> books<00:02:37.480> are<00:02:37.629> a<00:02:37.660> big<00:02:38.319> draw<00:02:38.530> still<00:02:39.010> it's

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
photo books are a big draw still it's

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.770 
photo books are a big draw still it's
probably<00:02:39.640> one<00:02:39.760> of<00:02:39.790> the<00:02:39.940> industries<00:02:40.390> that<00:02:40.420> was

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
probably one of the industries that was

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.900 
probably one of the industries that was
in<00:02:40.989> the<00:02:41.079> hits<00:02:41.319> too<00:02:41.650> much<00:02:41.829> by<00:02:42.040> the<00:02:42.099> digital<00:02:42.639> kind

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
in the hits too much by the digital kind

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:46.440 
in the hits too much by the digital kind
of<00:02:43.060> era<00:02:43.269> and<00:02:43.660> do<00:02:44.440> you<00:02:44.530> see<00:02:44.680> it<00:02:44.769> growing<00:02:45.069> or<00:02:45.459> how

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
of era and do you see it growing or how

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.160 
of era and do you see it growing or how
do<00:02:46.510> you<00:02:46.660> see<00:02:46.900> that<00:02:47.049> evolving<00:02:47.319> then<00:02:49.079> over<00:02:50.079> the

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
do you see that evolving then over the

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:51.780 
do you see that evolving then over the
last<00:02:50.349> maybe<00:02:50.950> four<00:02:51.250> or<00:02:51.310> five<00:02:51.370> years<00:02:51.579> there<00:02:51.700> was

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
last maybe four or five years there was

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.440 
last maybe four or five years there was
a<00:02:51.819> push<00:02:52.090> towards<00:02:53.700> towards<00:02:54.700> the<00:02:54.849> digital<00:02:55.000> soul

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
a push towards towards the digital soul

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.360 
a push towards towards the digital soul
I<00:02:55.510> mean<00:02:55.690> perhaps<00:02:55.840> there<00:02:56.139> was<00:02:56.230> I<00:02:56.349> mean<00:02:56.380> I<00:02:56.859> pushed

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
I mean perhaps there was I mean I pushed

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.550 
I mean perhaps there was I mean I pushed
it<00:02:57.489> was<00:02:57.579> the<00:02:57.910> e-book<00:02:58.269> and<00:02:58.599> their<00:02:58.900> high

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
it was the e-book and their high

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.970 
it was the e-book and their high
performance<00:02:59.760> but<00:03:00.760> actually<00:03:01.060> the

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
performance but actually the

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.220 
performance but actually the
I<00:03:02.120> doubt<00:03:03.120> that's<00:03:03.330> gonna<00:03:03.450> change<00:03:03.690> much<00:03:03.959> because

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
I doubt that's gonna change much because

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:05.570 
I doubt that's gonna change much because
there<00:03:04.680> is<00:03:04.769> nothing<00:03:04.950> like<00:03:05.069> the<00:03:05.250> book<00:03:05.400> there's

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
there is nothing like the book there's

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.420 
there is nothing like the book there's
nothing<00:03:05.790> like<00:03:05.879> a<00:03:05.940> flavor<00:03:06.269> yeah<00:03:07.049> I<00:03:07.709> mean<00:03:08.250> these

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
nothing like a flavor yeah I mean these

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.149 
nothing like a flavor yeah I mean these
are<00:03:08.610> hard<00:03:08.849> objects<00:03:09.330> most<00:03:09.540> of<00:03:09.690> these<00:03:10.159> books

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:11.159 
are hard objects most of these books

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:13.729 
are hard objects most of these books
they<00:03:11.970> all<00:03:12.870> the<00:03:12.959> materials<00:03:13.319> have<00:03:13.409> been<00:03:13.440> chosen

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
they all the materials have been chosen

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:15.710 
they all the materials have been chosen
very<00:03:14.040> carefully<00:03:14.099> and<00:03:15.030> you<00:03:15.239> know<00:03:15.360> you<00:03:15.510> cannot

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
very carefully and you know you cannot

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.330 
very carefully and you know you cannot
do<00:03:15.840> that<00:03:15.870> in<00:03:16.049> an<00:03:16.140> iPad<00:03:16.440> the<00:03:16.890> engagement<00:03:17.280> is

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
do that in an iPad the engagement is

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:18.830 
do that in an iPad the engagement is
completely<00:03:17.670> different<00:03:18.000> you<00:03:18.510> can<00:03:18.660> produce

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
completely different you can produce

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.550 
completely different you can produce
something<00:03:20.510> you<00:03:21.510> know<00:03:21.599> purposely<00:03:21.780> design<00:03:22.230> for

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
something you know purposely design for

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.199 
something you know purposely design for
an<00:03:22.920> AI<00:03:22.980> person<00:03:23.310> could<00:03:23.489> be<00:03:23.549> the<00:03:23.640> video<00:03:23.879> content

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
an AI person could be the video content

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:25.910 
an AI person could be the video content
and<00:03:24.360> whatnot<00:03:24.569> it<00:03:25.140> will<00:03:25.260> be<00:03:25.349> probably<00:03:25.620> a<00:03:25.680> made

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
and whatnot it will be probably a made

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.440 
and whatnot it will be probably a made
amazing<00:03:26.310> as<00:03:26.430> well<00:03:26.549> but<00:03:26.730> it's<00:03:26.879> not<00:03:26.970> the<00:03:27.060> same<00:03:27.239> as

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
amazing as well but it's not the same as

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:29.000 
amazing as well but it's not the same as
a<00:03:27.629> photo<00:03:27.930> book<00:03:28.049> I<00:03:28.319> don't<00:03:28.440> think<00:03:28.709> the<00:03:28.769> book<00:03:28.860> is

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
a photo book I don't think the book is

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.399 
a photo book I don't think the book is
