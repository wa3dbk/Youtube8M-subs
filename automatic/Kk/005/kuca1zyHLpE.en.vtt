00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.190
 let's do another 15 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:37.899
 so people today I'm here I'm going to record 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:40.030
 plus this video about that column that 

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:42.190
 I launched it a short time ago that it was 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.470
 where he was already talking about the top-5 of 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:47.350
 certain literary genres and the 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:50.769
 gender maybe only in homs both playmates 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:52.449
 the young adult and this time I separated the 

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:54.970
 five books that I consider the 

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:57.820
 best and a gay of the young and adults 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:59.620
 I already read there's going to be a lot of people going 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:02.860
 to be bad because you do not have the 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:04.689
 series in scoop I do not know what it is but I 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:06.220
 I'll show you what I like about 

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:08.860
 people that I really consider one of the 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:11.470
 better and both of which already have so much 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:14.140
 environments being launched around the 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.880
 options is quite wide range of choices 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.600
 huge then though 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:21.280
 fifth place was the one 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.659
 society of the ashes which is the second 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.110
 volume of that series of instruments 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:28.720
 deadly exit inscribed by the white house 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:31.000
 and to me this one is the best of this 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:34.600
 series because here we will have 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.999
 characters as the publisher itself is 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.990
 A very cool character I loved too much. 

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:39.909
 she 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.229
 We will have good situations. 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:43.539
 interesting 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:44.920
 We're going to have a lot of adventure and debate. 

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:47.469
 the development of better characters 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.990
 presented in the first volume we 

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:52.179
 There's going to be a lot of stuff and I think it's here. 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:55.659
 the best of the series I've seen the three 

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:57.880
 first and six months for me. 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:59.289
 here is the best and was able to enter 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.749
 the best I've ever in Manguinhos 

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:04.509
 because it's very good, very good even here 

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:06.850
 I liked it so much, so it's between the five of us. 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:08.470
 best friends I've ever seen in a room 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.830
 place I will talk about a book I have ever 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:13.480
 said that the carnival this one 16 two 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:16.690
 I did a review recently 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:19.450
 about dan search channel 10 306 music 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:22.209
 Talk about the book about the movie and here 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:24.280
 I also consider one of the best and 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:26.290
 NGOs I've seen in my life is very 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.910
 delicious, this, people here 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:30.849
 the methodology that the authors involved 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:33.190
 this series was fantastic writing 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:35.319
 it's sensational and the plot Carlos 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:39.050
 bolado to this amazing story 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:42.700
 So I say with my eyes closed. 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:44.990
 this series which is very very very good 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:47.720
 comedy but stayed in fourth place 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:50.090
 the money series was the corinthians who 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:52.670
 in case here what I say even I 16 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:56.180
 two that the first volume that for me is 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:56.720
 the best until a better there in third 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:00.050
 place 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:01.640
 I put this one here don hutto ends 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:04.570
 here that this series un 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:07.460
 written by the greatest that is 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:09.320
 too awesome account 

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:11.570
 I can not fit into this series 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:15.050
 a genre well as a beautiful shot a day 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:17.480
 here although it does not have young people 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:19.730
 adults here five children the 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.200
 targeted audience 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:23.690
 author of this series 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.670
 is the public have read today because the 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:28.220
 cases that happen here a child does not 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:31.250
 I wish I could not read because it's a 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:32.570
 strong book is a very strong series one 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:36.380
 series of violent 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:40.130
 I point out the series is too much. 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:41.750
 Good, this, people, there, it 's a story. 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:43.880
 very well thought out 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:46.580
 I 'm just in doubt about something. 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:48.770
 It's certain it looks like it's going to have six volumes 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:50.120
 I'm a third still will be that the 

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:53.390
 author really has so much history to 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:55.190
 do six volumes do not know just know that the 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:56.420
 first volume which is still my 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:59.480
 preferred 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:02.600
 in the second it's fantastic but the first one is 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:04.400
 Unbeatable yet for the time being you do not see your 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:07.820
 next books will be as good as the 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:09.890
 first is even the name of michael bay 

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:13.459
 now the second and the first place 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:15.440
 they were very close to each other 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:18.739
 so much so that the first place only took the 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:20.239
 first because of I do not know 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:22.280
 explain to people why at first 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:24.169
 Place half gilberto not first 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:26.900
 place first for little thing 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:29.090
 it was only because of a small fact 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:31.850
 that has not I quite like it is 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:35.600
 a supernatural touch 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:38.060
 so second this one you guys 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:39.350
 because of action I did review 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:41.270
 about it here on the channel 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:44.419
 the recent review of a wanted person is a 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:46.440
 Dear people, this book is fantastic. 

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:50.850
 a top-quality drama 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:54.180
 exquisite rita and smile showing 

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:55.590
 excellent in people because bullying is 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:57.660
 serious thing 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:59.670
 and this book that deals with this 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:01.620
 matter masterfully and eating 

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:04.140
 and was second in rank to God. 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:06.320
 Gods and one of them speaks to everyone 

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:08.250
 my life but it came in second place 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:11.130
 very little because the first 

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:12.090
 this place was here years next to the 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:14.550
 work 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:16.170
 she wrote in others it is also lyre 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:18.840
 which is a more topical series 

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:21.810
 But this one for me is her masterpiece. 

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:26.190
 It's this amazing amazing book. 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:29.370
 exciting is sad it's dramatic is everything 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:31.470
 this here is full of feeling here and 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:33.240
 I even owe you a review 

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:35.220
 about this book I remember doing a 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:38.040
 review about likely people because 

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:41.220
 he deserves but not only to him and treats 

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:43.920
 also about bullying is touched here only 

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:46.050
 that in a different way and also on the 

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:48.630
 choices we make during life 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:51.630
 all that is that every action generates a 

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:53.910
 reaction that each person has their own 

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:56.760
 life and is no different from seeing 

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:59.460
 life and this kind of thing and the book is 

00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:00.840
 very very good and exciting to the 

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:03.240
 last page 

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:08.640
 For me it's the best and nobody I've ever seen 

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:10.680
 My life here is really good and he 

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:13.260
 both him and in this video here the 

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:16.200
 two that are on my list 

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:18.360
 best since february life details 

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:21.120
 I'll give a hug relatives here this 

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:22.560
 top 5 that I do are only targeted 

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:24.360
 for a genius 

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:26.880
 There are five books I like best 

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:28.710
 within the genre there are five books 

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:31.169
 I like the most in my life, I go. 

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:33.960
 make a video in the future for you 

00:06:31.169 --> 00:06:35.490
 showing I think about 20 or 30 books 

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:36.600
 are the best books I 've ever 

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:38.940
 my life 

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:42.030
 some books that appear in the top 5 will 

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:44.850
 appear in this top of the best days of 

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:46.650
 my life like the one before I go 

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:49.710
 the 13 because these two books 

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:51.450
 were able to enter the top of 

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:54.000
 books that one of the best in my 

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:57.270
 Life but you have little you can enter. 

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.890
 It's so much so that you're better in my life. 

00:06:57.270 --> 00:07:02.150
 We have to be the best of the 

00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:06.420
 better even then I'll be fine 

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:09.750
 restricted is very rigid with these videos 

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:11.310
 but this one is very good indeed and 

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:13.800
 eating too much for anyone 

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:15.840
