 last constructura de mira vos looks at me 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.340
 to me 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:17.340
 [Music] 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:30.829
 [Music] 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:38.140
 and look let's all go to the queue 

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:38.140
 [Music] 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:44.650
 yes sir we go to the coast that same 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.720
 lie stay with us here because 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:48.700
 let's make some thighs stuffed but 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:51.070
 to suck your fingers delicious 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:53.230
 riquísimo accordate that these already you what 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.720
 we have shown but we go back and come back 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:58.000
 because you have a leg chicken leg 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:00.610
 the bone of the leg the bone of the thigh 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.460
 how do you do it to fill it? 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:05.979
 generate a cavity then we go with 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:08.740
 the sharp knife touching the tip 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:11.080
 with the point of the knife above the 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:15.300
 bone of the thigh and that way we're going 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:17.890
 opening for one side and for the other 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:21.570
 despacito lady for everyone 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.570
 the idea is understood 

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:29.259
 look for one side and for the other and 

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:31.539
 appeared the little bone is moving and 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:35.080
 20s the point of the knife below and 

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:38.050
 cut then we have released the 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:41.770
 thigh we have already removed the bone in the 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:44.200
 place of the conjuncture we are going to cut and 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.880
 the idea then is to say as 8 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:49.090
 slowly, very careful not to 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:51.849
 cut off by moving the bone to 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:55.060
 release them the idea then is to fill 

00:01:51.849 --> 00:01:57.670
 these these legs and these thighs with 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:01.300
 there we are going to make a mosque with a 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:03.580
 onions already sautéed with the addition of 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:07.840
 a little salt amin could be any 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:11.530
 another type of cold cuts and bacon because 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:14.950
 it can not be ham raw cooked pastrón 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:17.980
 which you want then we go to 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.989
 Mix once we finish opening 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.450
 see where the juncture is 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:26.200
 of the leg bone you have to dig like this 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:28.360
 in round to release the bone and this 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.470
 I recommend you do it with the 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.470
 glasses on 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:34.000
 looking closely and very carefully not 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:35.500
 you are doing it living with signs 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.380
 Argentines at the same time because you're leaving 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:41.110
 to slice a thimble first look good 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:45.040
 and then he does then let's go 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:46.480
 separating and we meanwhile you 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.750
 I want to say one thing because 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:52.000
 taking advantage of the day of the lovers 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:54.940
 taking advantage of that from love there 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:58.300
 a pregnancy and there is a child who is 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:01.480
 get there and we talk about laura the woman of 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:04.420
 our director is shortly but in 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.800
 brief I think there's so much now it's 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.910
 for having family you are not seeing 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:10.480
 because he is at rest 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:13.300
 laura get ready because in a little bit 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:16.570
 happiness comes a very big kiss of 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:20.230
 all of course at the time and cachito and 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:24.910
 To nachito also a girl I have a 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:26.620
 chancleta feline look now we have 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:28.270
 released the bone when the bone is 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.100
 So we have to cut the leg 

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:32.380
 so be very careful and this can 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:35.220
 get to jump does not jump we take the 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:38.800
 bone then we definitely have 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:42.010
 notice that he rebuilt his leg and 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:44.110
 thigh perfectly boned and ready 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.660
 to fill in where it was 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:46.280
 bone 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:48.860
 until it is a good quality 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:51.320
 put the filling the filling let's go 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:53.270
 same with him with a spoon we're going to 

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:56.390
 go forming within this bowl a 

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:58.670
 little onion sauteed previously 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:01.790
 just with a little oil has the 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:04.400
 recipe a little bit of garlic 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:07.550
 not too much there is a little bit of 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:09.740
 spoon a little chopped parsley and the 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:12.350
 cold you want this high that 

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:14.690
 have at hand in this case is a salami 

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:16.820
 and minced then all this 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:19.010
 we can also add a mixture 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:20.870
 little bit of cheese that we have here 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:22.880
 I'm going to scoop out the cheese 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:26.690
 it looks like a butter with the heat 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:28.790
 look there is the one who quoted what we put 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:31.040
 there those cheeses if it's creamy cheese 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:33.110
 Note that seems shortening the 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:35.690
 good warmth we mix everything very well 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:38.330
 and this chicken, then we're going to 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:41.000
 fill each of them with this 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:42.180
 hodgepodge there on the grill are 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:48.180
 from now 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:50.430
 and these are almost almost and really 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:54.030
 they remain barbaric then of course what 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:56.639
 you can do in advance and you have it in 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:58.289
 the refrigerator a couple of days or you put it in 

00:04:56.639 --> 00:05:00.300
 the freezer and the guards up to three 

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:02.280
 months and of course if you do not want 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:03.990
 plant or you can not plant the grill 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:06.000
 as we have done directly 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:08.699
 you do it in the oven and this is from a 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.789
 sensational facility because you weapons 

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:14.280
 these thighs of course with the 

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:17.759
 stuffing that you want we have said 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:20.460
 a thousand and one times the chicken is super versatile 

00:05:17.759 --> 00:05:23.310
 notice that a while ago we made some 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:25.680
 stuffed breasts with the same 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:27.840
 Liver of the chicken really wants 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:29.789
 Rich is really soft left 

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:32.520
 really good with a little onion 

00:05:29.789 --> 00:05:34.889
 and of nose in this case I remember you 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:37.740
 we're going to put it together once you do not 

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:39.900
 you have to see that we have to 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:41.750
 we have to shape exactly anita 

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:43.730
 we have to close it 

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:46.910
 then we are generating as 

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:50.060
 folds and with the help of some toothpicks 

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:51.470
 We hold wood so that it does not 

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:54.110
 plant instead of the most 

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:57.380
 then we are going to cook it 

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:58.790
 grill each of these and they are going to 

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:01.910
 join with those we have already done 

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:03.980
 calculates approximately 15-20 

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:07.790
 minutes on each side and you will be left 

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:11.240
 super sensational rich tender the 

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:13.850
 breast is prone to approach but the 

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:17.240
 leg thigh at all with respect to the 

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:18.550
 anp to the other one that we put together a while ago 

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:21.560
 remember the first one we had 

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:23.810
 wrapped in aluminum foil and we leave it 

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:26.030
 about 10-15 minutes wrapped in paper 

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:28.100
 aluminum on the grill or in your case 

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:29.540
 if you want in the oven of your house and 

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:31.910
 then we open the aluminum foil 

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:35.510
 so that it is finished browning and so that 

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:37.880
 is really piola saw the piece now 

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:41.150
 he finished grabbing with a toothpick I'm going 

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:44.630
 to put together a plastic and I'm going 

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:45.889
 going to the grill come and follow me 

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:49.009

00:06:49.009 --> 00:06:54.229
