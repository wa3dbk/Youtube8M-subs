play but I am NOT a big fan of sport
class<00:00:51.080> weapon<00:00:51.850> sure<00:00:52.850> the<00:00:53.000> high<00:00:53.150> damage<00:00:53.540> and

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:53.990

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:56.060 
large ammo capacity is attractive but I

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:58.210 
large ammo capacity is attractive but I
tend<00:00:56.480> to<00:00:56.660> go<00:00:56.840> with<00:00:57.020> the<00:00:57.200> more<00:00:57.410> accurate<00:00:57.980> and

00:00:58.210 --> 00:00:58.220 
tend to go with the more accurate and

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.160 
tend to go with the more accurate and
lighter<00:00:58.490> weapons<00:00:59.000> what<00:00:59.600> I'm<00:00:59.690> trying<00:00:59.930> to<00:00:59.990> say

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.170 
lighter weapons what I'm trying to say

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.200 
lighter weapons what I'm trying to say
is<00:01:00.350> that<00:01:00.530> basically<00:01:00.920> suck<00:01:01.370> at<00:01:01.520> using<00:01:01.910> machine

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
is that basically suck at using machine

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.119 
is that basically suck at using machine
guns<00:01:02.240> so<00:01:03.050> I<00:01:03.110> wasn't<00:01:03.260> really<00:01:03.560> expecting<00:01:03.740> much

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:04.129 
guns so I wasn't really expecting much

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:05.980 
guns so I wasn't really expecting much
from<00:01:04.159> the<00:01:04.460> pecheneg<00:01:04.939> but<00:01:05.210> once<00:01:05.449> I<00:01:05.600> started

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:05.990 
from the pecheneg but once I started

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.080 
from the pecheneg but once I started
trying<00:01:06.200> out<00:01:06.439> in<00:01:06.619> game<00:01:06.829> I<00:01:07.040> was<00:01:07.280> quite<00:01:07.670> surprised

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.090 
trying out in game I was quite surprised

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.810 
trying out in game I was quite surprised
to<00:01:08.210> see<00:01:08.450> how<00:01:08.630> well<00:01:08.869> it<00:01:09.079> handled<00:01:09.500> the<00:01:10.250> damages

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820 
to see how well it handled the damages

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.480 
to see how well it handled the damages
is<00:01:11.000> set<00:01:11.270> between<00:01:11.479> 70s<00:01:12.229> to<00:01:12.380> 80s<00:01:12.799> depending<00:01:13.009> on

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490 
is set between 70s to 80s depending on

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.219 
is set between 70s to 80s depending on
how<00:01:13.759> you<00:01:13.819> spend<00:01:14.210> your<00:01:14.270> SP<00:01:14.689> points<00:01:14.869> and

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:15.229 
how you spend your SP points and

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:17.050 
how you spend your SP points and
accuracy<00:01:16.189> which<00:01:16.369> I<00:01:16.520> thought<00:01:16.700> it<00:01:16.880> would<00:01:16.969> be

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060 
accuracy which I thought it would be

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.779 
accuracy which I thought it would be
terrible<00:01:17.569> since<00:01:17.869> it<00:01:18.020> is<00:01:18.170> a<00:01:18.380> machine<00:01:18.740> gun<00:01:18.979> is

00:01:19.779 --> 00:01:19.789 
terrible since it is a machine gun is

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:22.419 
terrible since it is a machine gun is
actually<00:01:20.119> maxed<00:01:20.780> out<00:01:20.899> 200<00:01:21.560> thanks<00:01:22.039> to<00:01:22.219> my

short<00:01:25.100> average<00:01:25.429> lifespan<00:01:25.880> hundred<00:01:26.749> rounds<00:01:27.109> is

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:27.259 
short average lifespan hundred rounds is

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:29.739 
short average lifespan hundred rounds is
more<00:01:27.590> than<00:01:27.740> enough<00:01:27.889> for<00:01:28.280> me<00:01:28.429> 400<00:01:29.270> rounds<00:01:29.450> sorry

00:01:29.739 --> 00:01:29.749 
more than enough for me 400 rounds sorry

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:32.379 
more than enough for me 400 rounds sorry
is<00:01:29.990> more<00:01:30.889> than<00:01:31.039> enough<00:01:31.189> for<00:01:31.490> me<00:01:31.549> and<00:01:31.909> the<00:01:32.179> high

00:01:32.379 --> 00:01:32.389 
is more than enough for me and the high

00:01:32.389 --> 00:01:34.300 
is more than enough for me and the high
penetration<00:01:33.079> also<00:01:33.319> helps<00:01:33.740> to<00:01:33.859> deal<00:01:34.039> with

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
penetration also helps to deal with

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.639 
penetration also helps to deal with
those<00:01:34.520> crazy<00:01:34.939> guys<00:01:35.210> with<00:01:35.569> 150<00:01:36.289> armor

those crazy guys with 150 armor

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:47.530 
those crazy guys with 150 armor
reloading<00:01:37.639> takes<00:01:37.939> a<00:01:38.090> belt<00:01:40.060> yeah

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:47.540 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:54.010 

I<00:01:51.850> guess<00:01:52.850> you<00:01:53.000> can<00:01:53.150> really<00:01:53.420> expect<00:01:53.750> everything

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
I guess you can really expect everything

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:55.030 
I guess you can really expect everything
to<00:01:54.200> be<00:01:54.290> perfect

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:55.040 
to be perfect

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:56.920 
to be perfect
reloading<00:01:55.460> is<00:01:55.640> super<00:01:56.090> slow<00:01:56.270> compared<00:01:56.750> with

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:56.930 
reloading is super slow compared with

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.230 
reloading is super slow compared with
other<00:01:57.230> mgs<00:01:57.710> and<00:01:57.860> game<00:01:58.040> what<00:01:58.700> makes<00:01:58.880> it<00:01:59.030> worse

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
other mgs and game what makes it worse

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.230 
other mgs and game what makes it worse
is<00:01:59.450> that<00:01:59.540> the<00:01:59.870> bloody<00:02:00.110> mobility<00:02:00.710> is<00:02:00.950> set<00:02:01.430> at<00:02:01.610> 3

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 
is that the bloody mobility is set at 3

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.310 
is that the bloody mobility is set at 3

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.570 
I'm not crouching or prone this is

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.080 
I'm not crouching or prone this is
literally<00:02:06.080> me<00:02:06.350> trying<00:02:06.770> to<00:02:06.830> walk<00:02:07.100> as<00:02:07.340> fast<00:02:07.760> as<00:02:07.970> I
