00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.130 
HEV helmet promo so first off right here
you<00:00:28.920> can<00:00:29.039> see<00:00:29.279> him<00:00:29.369> doing<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:29.910> 360<00:00:30.660> backflip

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
you can see him doing the 360 backflip

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.560 
you can see him doing the 360 backflip
it's<00:00:31.320> a<00:00:31.470> combination<00:00:32.130> of<00:00:32.250> a<00:00:32.730> backflip<00:00:33.180> and<00:00:33.480> a

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
it's a combination of a backflip and a

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.229 
it's a combination of a backflip and a
360<00:00:34.020> and<00:00:34.469> right<00:00:35.370> now<00:00:35.520> he's<00:00:35.700> going<00:00:36.030> into

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
360 and right now he's going into

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.170 
360 and right now he's going into
another<00:00:36.870> 360<00:00:37.770> which<00:00:38.430> that<00:00:38.700> right<00:00:38.879> there<00:00:39.090> is

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
another 360 which that right there is

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.520 
another 360 which that right there is
basically<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:40.969> the<00:00:41.969> toilet<00:00:42.930> paper<00:00:43.079> roll<00:00:43.200> but

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
basically the the toilet paper roll but

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:44.930 
basically the the toilet paper roll but
then<00:00:43.649> at<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:43.829> end<00:00:43.950> he<00:00:44.219> kind<00:00:44.489> of<00:00:44.520> went<00:00:44.640> sideways

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
then at the end he kind of went sideways

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:53.110 
then at the end he kind of went sideways
so<00:00:45.870> you<00:00:46.170> can<00:00:46.289> see<00:00:46.620> here<00:00:46.829> again<00:00:47.450> the<00:00:48.450> normal<00:00:51.079> 720

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:53.120 
so you can see here again the normal 720

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:58.520 
so you can see here again the normal 720
until<00:00:55.039> right<00:00:56.039> about<00:00:56.280> now<00:00:56.550> see<00:00:57.390> that<00:00:57.600> so<00:00:58.230> right

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
until right about now see that so right

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.439 
until right about now see that so right
here<00:00:58.859> in<00:00:59.039> this<00:00:59.219> next<00:00:59.550> part<00:00:59.760> he's<00:01:00.120> basically

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
here in this next part he's basically

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.990 
here in this next part he's basically
going<00:01:00.750> into<00:01:01.289> another<00:01:01.739> backflip<00:01:02.579> that's<00:01:02.850> a

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
going into another backflip that's a

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.080 
going into another backflip that's a
little<00:01:03.239> bit<00:01:03.359> sideways<00:01:03.660> and<00:01:04.080> off<00:01:04.229> access<00:01:05.090> kind

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
little bit sideways and off access kind

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.910 
little bit sideways and off access kind
of<00:01:06.150> like<00:01:06.270> the<00:01:06.450> first<00:01:06.630> backflip<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.650> first

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
of like the first backflip the first

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.170 
of like the first backflip the first
rotation<00:01:08.640> of<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:09.780> of<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.320> move<00:01:10.530> but<00:01:11.369> more<00:01:11.790> of

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
rotation of the of the move but more of

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.219 
rotation of the of the move but more of
I<00:01:12.900> guess<00:01:13.229> a<00:01:13.260> whip<00:01:13.650> backflip<00:01:14.430> or<00:01:14.640> a<00:01:15.119> under<00:01:15.960> flip

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
I guess a whip backflip or a under flip

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.010 
I guess a whip backflip or a under flip
and<00:01:16.830> then<00:01:17.460> from<00:01:17.820> there<00:01:18.000> you<00:01:18.390> know<00:01:18.509> he<00:01:18.840> just

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
and then from there you know he just

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.469 
and then from there you know he just
basically<00:01:19.200> goes<00:01:19.560> knee<00:01:19.770> lands<00:01:20.040> it<00:01:20.390> so<00:01:21.390> I'll

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
basically goes knee lands it so I'll

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.630 
basically goes knee lands it so I'll
show<00:01:21.720> you<00:01:21.750> in<00:01:22.049> anywhere<00:01:22.650> in<00:01:22.890> even<00:01:23.369> slower

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
show you in anywhere in even slower

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.730 
show you in anywhere in even slower
motion<00:01:23.880> and<00:01:24.299> by<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.540> way<00:01:24.750> that<00:01:25.080> yellow<00:01:25.409> ramp

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
motion and by the way that yellow ramp

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.080 
motion and by the way that yellow ramp
right<00:01:25.920> there<00:01:26.100> are<00:01:26.189> these<00:01:26.310> about<00:01:26.549> to<00:01:26.759> take<00:01:26.939> off

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
right there are these about to take off

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.399 
right there are these about to take off
of<00:01:27.420> was<00:01:28.080> a<00:01:28.259> custom<00:01:28.890> made<00:01:29.130> ramp<00:01:29.720> for<00:01:30.720> this<00:01:31.140> move

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
of was a custom made ramp for this move

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.249 
of was a custom made ramp for this move
and<00:01:32.070> that's<00:01:33.060> a<00:01:33.210> big<00:01:33.390> pile<00:01:33.600> of<00:01:33.630> mulch<00:01:33.990> right

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
and that's a big pile of mulch right

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.160 
and that's a big pile of mulch right
there<00:01:34.500> so<00:01:35.189> that<00:01:35.220> he<00:01:35.700> it's<00:01:36.299> softer<00:01:36.750> than<00:01:36.780> dirt

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
there so that he it's softer than dirt

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.740 
there so that he it's softer than dirt
and<00:01:37.439> that's<00:01:37.740> what<00:01:37.979> Travis<00:01:38.250> uses<00:01:38.880> to<00:01:39.150> practice

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
and that's what Travis uses to practice

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.240 
and that's what Travis uses to practice
and<00:01:40.310> I<00:01:41.310> am<00:01:42.259> literally<00:01:43.259> Travis<00:01:44.100> Pastrana's

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
do know a lot about all this and I've

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.120 
do know a lot about all this and I've
been<00:01:51.479> following<00:01:51.840> his<00:01:51.960> career<00:01:52.170> since<00:01:52.560> I<00:01:52.680> was<00:01:52.860> 2

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
been following his career since I was 2

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.459 
been following his career since I was 2
years<00:01:53.159> old<00:01:53.490> but<00:01:53.820> there's<00:01:54.570> a<00:01:54.659> last<00:01:54.869> look<00:01:55.079> here

00:01:57.459 --> 00:01:57.469 

00:01:57.469 --> 00:02:02.120 

and<00:01:58.469> that's<00:01:59.399> it<00:01:59.640> so<00:02:00.110> but<00:02:01.110> I<00:02:01.320> am<00:02:01.649> going<00:02:01.860> to<00:02:01.950> talk

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
and that's it so but I am going to talk

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.780 
and that's it so but I am going to talk
a<00:02:02.159> little<00:02:02.280> bit<00:02:02.430> more<00:02:03.170> so<00:02:04.170> Travis<00:02:04.950> will<00:02:05.369> not<00:02:05.579> be

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
a little bit more so Travis will not be

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.080 
a little bit more so Travis will not be
attempting<00:02:06.299> this<00:02:06.450> trick<00:02:06.810> at<00:02:07.049> X<00:02:07.409> Games<00:02:08.090> at

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
attempting this trick at X Games at

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.620 
attempting this trick at X Games at
least<00:02:09.300> I<00:02:10.110> doubt<00:02:10.920> it<00:02:11.190> because

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
least I doubt it because

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:18.260 
least I doubt it because
that<00:02:13.560> was<00:02:13.830> sadly<00:02:14.550> his<00:02:14.880> last<00:02:15.210> time<00:02:16.520> when<00:02:17.520> he

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
that was sadly his last time when he

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:19.970 
that was sadly his last time when he
broke<00:02:18.480> his<00:02:18.630> foot<00:02:18.690> that<00:02:19.110> we<00:02:19.260> were<00:02:19.470> ever<00:02:19.770> gonna

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
broke his foot that we were ever gonna

how it goes

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.930 
how it goes
so<00:02:29.640> but<00:02:30.630> when<00:02:31.080> he<00:02:31.290> does<00:02:31.500> attempt<00:02:32.160> this<00:02:32.280> trick<00:02:32.640> I

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
so but when he does attempt this trick I

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.960 
so but when he does attempt this trick I
think<00:02:33.780> it's<00:02:33.990> gonna<00:02:34.140> be<00:02:34.350> at<00:02:34.650> Nitro<00:02:35.250> Circus<00:02:35.490> live

think it's gonna be at Nitro Circus live

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.820 
think it's gonna be at Nitro Circus live
and<00:02:36.680> sometime<00:02:37.680> after<00:02:38.130> the<00:02:39.590> NASCAR<00:02:40.590> season

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
and sometime after the NASCAR season

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.940 
and sometime after the NASCAR season
that's<00:02:41.130> coming<00:02:41.490> up<00:02:41.610> and<00:02:42.540> once<00:02:42.960> his<00:02:43.170> foot<00:02:43.710> heels

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950

that's coming up and once his foot heels
up<00:02:44.130> more<00:02:44.370> and<00:02:44.730> he<00:02:45.510> just<00:02:45.720> got<00:02:45.870> so<00:02:46.080> much<00:02:47.210> shoulder

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:48.210 
up more and he just got so much shoulder
