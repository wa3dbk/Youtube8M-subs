00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.190
 hi dear subscribers viewers 

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:11.049
 every time I greet you from China 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:12.270
 Today we will have on the channel 

00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:16.209
 unpack as if someone 

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:19.930
 incomprehensible not package not by reference general 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:22.780
 such a long thing in yellow scotch 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:25.300
 Chinese very package wrapped site came 

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:30.490
 aliexpress was tracked with track number 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:35.160
 everything went fine with us for about 20 days 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:38.040
 estimated her almost 18 dollars 1799 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.810
 skateboard I get you in one of the videos 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:44.130
 talked about this parcel then watching 

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:46.800
 here now understand what kind of device 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:49.660
 always declare share that i have 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.899
 I recently had a small acquisition 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:54.220
 bought a prefix in general 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.970
 smart TV you give this to 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:58.930
 android 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:01:00.210
 here but it is managed in 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.590
 principle 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:06.579
 ordinary mouse, but I use 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:10.689
 wireless but uncomfortable in principle 

00:01:06.579 --> 00:01:13.060
 uncomfortable uncomfortable with the mouse so i am 

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:18.880
 ordered a wireless one 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:20.950
 cool keyboard let's see here 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:24.369
 such a branded box honestly next 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:27.009
 there will be a little more goes 24 hertz signal 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:29.439
 that is, the signal will be powerful I do not think 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:31.420
 what will be the loss some kind of quality about what 

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:33.369
 he goes look connects to 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:36.279
 computer smart tv can 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:37.179
 connect to mini drink and android tv 

00:01:36.279 --> 00:01:40.029
 box photos 

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:43.029
 what I told me in particular for me 

00:01:40.029 --> 00:01:46.179
 i need android tv box and but maybe 

00:01:43.029 --> 00:01:48.310
 the computer can even connect in 

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:50.289
 Basically, I need to be smart and here 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.959
 it is here for this she is by and large 

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:54.909
 account and calculated here is such a proprietary 

00:01:52.959 --> 00:01:57.579
 wrapping everything in chinese and on 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:02:00.969
 English in Russian is not a word inside 

00:01:57.579 --> 00:02:03.909
 we are the keyboard itself all 

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:06.310
 inside there is nothing else here yet 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:11.650
 buying you 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:13.540
 so here we have instruction on which 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.640
 the language itself I squander these moments when 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.340
 consider instructions but not 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.260
 Are you interested in Russian? 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:25.450
 there is no such thing everything is in english 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:30.900
 language so all mods keyboard itself well 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:32.950
 what looks like this basically from the glacier 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:37.780
 let's see what's behind her 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:41.250
 how it opens probably just yes 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:44.319
 just need to pull it and not myself 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:47.350
 she was beaten up by this adapter 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:50.260
 insert the device which will 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:53.739
 She used and three batteries not 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:54.489
 finger 3 and that is the little finger up to 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:57.940
 common people 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:03:00.489
 here it dresses just as clicks in 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:02.650
 I will make a little testik at the end of the video 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:05.019
 I will show how she works on her 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:10.000
 tv and now just visual 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:13.299
 review just by the quality of performance i 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:16.090
 I'll show you, that is, as you can see, yes 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:20.920
 Russian language is not available but in principle 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:22.390
 it is not as critical as the principle 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:25.660
 it will be used largely 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:27.670
 account like a joystick up to switch 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:31.180
 there is a channel as you can see here 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:33.430
 The window is like a touchscreen like this 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:36.489
 laptops cottage what we see goes here 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:39.760
 joystick adventure buttons buttons 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:41.980
 pierced double attack done in principle 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.260
 buttons they are pressed strongly lower to 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:46.870
 straight like that but ok handy 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:50.109
 pressed so there is a signal level 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:52.630
 here shows three indicators like 

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:54.130
 see here three indicators will be 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:55.959
 show charge level but in general 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:57.280
 This I will show in the mini review points at the end 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:58.829
 video on / off button 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:03.130
 principle 

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:05.109
 the mouse and keyboard are written that is it 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:08.560
 device replaces you two in one you 

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:11.250
 and keyboard and mouse medicine minus what 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:13.540
 There is no Russian language of course very 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:16.450
 unpleasantly well we will learn 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:18.040
 English this yes such a keyboard 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:22.150
 guys in size 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:24.820
 she is not very big as I said 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:26.670
 At first, that is, as you can see, if 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:29.110
 compare 

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:32.020
 so that it is more or less clear to everyone here 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:34.150
 lighter here is the keyboard that is not 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:35.680
 especially big but as ordinary but 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:39.010
 unusually finite as a remote on 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:42.400
 TV of this size in general, all 

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:44.050
 Store cool guys as I orom 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.060
 already ordered the goods all come all 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:48.910
 Excellent does not always give track numbers for 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:50.260
 haircuts goods despite their cost 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:53.140
 uncomfortable noticed now 

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:55.450
 the cheaper the goods the more likely 

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:58.600
 it is likely that you will not get the track number 

00:04:55.450 --> 00:05:00.730
 but there are processes like on the road 

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:02.710
 goods and canons even on it and does not send 

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:05.530
 track numbers but here the situation is different 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:08.110
 a guy but a man there is already an adult 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:09.460
 overall i will take off so rewrite no all 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:12.460
 can persuade 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:13.020
 decide how to ship how to pack in 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:15.550
 general 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:16.960
 I will leave a link under the video if something 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:19.750
 She is interested in a lot of electronics 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:23.050
 Come see, buy it safely I 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:25.510
 I advise you this seller so and so I 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:28.600
 now connected smart tv 

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:30.670
 connected the wireless keyboard myself 

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:33.610
 device now it will start and 

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:35.620
 check how everything works in general how are you 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:38.320
 see eat here as an indicator i 

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:41.140
 showed here just click they 

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:44.230
 show how level level 

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:46.020
 signal that is either charging it 

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:48.880
 It shows I'm still not yet understood 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:51.700
 Now as you can see shows three lights that 

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:54.010
 there is either this how much battery or is it 

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:55.390
 the signal level by the device itself is me 

00:05:54.010 --> 00:06:01.600
 have not figured it out yet 

00:05:55.390 --> 00:06:06.360
 so well we look how you see the mouse works 

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:06.360
 here so in order to open 

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:13.540
 also click twice yes on this panel 

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:17.500
 scroll keys are used here 

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:21.000
 that is, you can use left to right 

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:24.070
 this one these 4 key buttons or 

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:27.580
 just as easy as you can see 

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:29.480
 Well, let's go through google 

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:36.190
 try something on 

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:39.980
 in the search engine here is an example so English 

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:43.550
 alt shift so I do not understand writes for some reason 

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:47.120
 in English and switch language 

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:49.490
 does not want anything in Russian I do not know what 

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:51.410
 we will understand but basically everything 

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:53.630
 the keyboard works the only thing here 

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:55.280
 I donâ€™t understand this minus why I only write 

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:58.940
 in English is it really here 

00:06:55.280 --> 00:07:00.800
 Russian feels okay sorry 

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:03.340
 of course that this but it will be violent 

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:05.020
 understand the touchpad as we see everything 

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:09.440
 works 

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:11.870
 convenient that the escape button lift has the 

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:14.900
 have this return takes you back to 

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:18.620
 previous menu and everything else here 

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:21.770
 right button and left button 

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:24.350
 button here they are so pronounced well so 

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:26.120
 keyboard all works 3 mizinchikovye 

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:29.990
