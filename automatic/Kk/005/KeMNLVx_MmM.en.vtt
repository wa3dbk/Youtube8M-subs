 all the kids at school 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.869

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:30.330

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.640
 state policy that the state has 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.040
 national so that all the boys of the 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.809
 Argentine public secondary school is 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.150

 tools in the real world and they know 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:43.049
 that bothers many when you 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.600
 we delivered a computer a boy the 

00:00:43.049 --> 00:00:47.850
 true that we are thrilled that 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.799
 a boy has the opportunity to go to the 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.860
 public school and be trained with that 

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:54.629
 tool today together with peppers we are 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.360
 the country that we have the highest rate of 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.970
 coverage in high school 82 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.159
 percent of netbooks that is a 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:04.440
 extraordinary work that makes hauls 

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:05.760
 with Diego leisure at the head are the 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.580
 best we can get 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.550

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:14.220
 or for our grandchildren that these kids 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:16.830

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:20.100

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:26.250
 the public school that we have 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.470

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.700

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.430
 the tools of the real world not only 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.560

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.350
