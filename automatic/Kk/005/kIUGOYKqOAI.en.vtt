00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610 
dehydrated so if you feel one of those

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:06.460 
dehydrated so if you feel one of those
things<00:02:04.820> you<00:02:05.120> might<00:02:05.510> actually<00:02:05.810> need<00:02:06.260> more

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470 
things you might actually need more

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:12.310 
things you might actually need more
water<00:02:10.180> how<00:02:11.180> much<00:02:11.240> water<00:02:11.390> do<00:02:11.780> you<00:02:11.810> need<00:02:12.050> in<00:02:12.230> a

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:12.320 
water how much water do you need in a

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.800 
water how much water do you need in a
day<00:02:12.350> well<00:02:13.070> I<00:02:13.100> actually<00:02:13.520> use<00:02:13.910> two<00:02:14.480> ways<00:02:14.780> to

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
day well I actually use two ways to

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.790 
day well I actually use two ways to
figure<00:02:15.320> this<00:02:15.440> out<00:02:15.730> one<00:02:16.730> way<00:02:16.910> you<00:02:17.330> can<00:02:17.570> use<00:02:18.020> to

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
figure this out one way you can use to

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.920 
figure this out one way you can use to
know<00:02:18.950> how<00:02:19.550> much<00:02:19.760> at<00:02:19.940> least<00:02:20.270> you<00:02:20.540> need<00:02:20.690> in<00:02:20.840> the

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
know how much at least you need in the

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:22.600 
know how much at least you need in the
day<00:02:21.110> is<00:02:21.350> divide<00:02:21.830> your<00:02:21.980> body<00:02:22.160> weight<00:02:22.400> by<00:02:22.550> two

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
day is divide your body weight by two

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:24.250 
day is divide your body weight by two
and<00:02:23.030> that's<00:02:23.210> how<00:02:23.390> much<00:02:23.540> water<00:02:23.810> you<00:02:23.930> mean<00:02:24.140> at

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
and that's how much water you mean at

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.310 
and that's how much water you mean at
least<00:02:24.290> announces<00:02:25.280> so<00:02:25.910> i<00:02:26.330> divided<00:02:26.900> my<00:02:26.930> body

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:27.320 
least announces so i divided my body

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.160 
least announces so i divided my body
weight<00:02:27.560> by<00:02:28.250> two<00:02:28.310> and<00:02:28.850> that's<00:02:29.420> how<00:02:29.570> many<00:02:29.780> much

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
weight by two and that's how many much

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:32.320 
weight by two and that's how many much
on<00:02:30.410> says<00:02:30.680> i<00:02:30.860> need<00:02:30.890> at<00:02:31.310> least<00:02:31.340> in<00:02:31.880> the<00:02:31.970> day<00:02:32.120> i

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
on says i need at least in the day i

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.870 
on says i need at least in the day i
showed<00:02:32.960> you<00:02:32.990> right<00:02:33.230> here<00:02:33.440> and<00:02:33.650> then<00:02:34.220> there's

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 
showed you right here and then there's

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.640 
showed you right here and then there's
actually<00:02:35.210> one<00:02:35.360> other<00:02:35.600> way<00:02:35.840> that<00:02:35.870> might<00:02:36.440> be<00:02:36.620> a

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
actually one other way that might be a

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.290 
actually one other way that might be a
little<00:02:36.860> higher<00:02:37.220> than<00:02:37.640> just<00:02:37.850> dividing<00:02:38.210> your

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:38.300 
little higher than just dividing your

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.030 
little higher than just dividing your
body<00:02:38.480> weight<00:02:38.690> by<00:02:38.840> two<00:02:38.900> but<00:02:39.530> it's<00:02:39.650> more<00:02:39.860> in

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
body weight by two but it's more in

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.680 
body weight by two but it's more in
depth<00:02:40.310> with<00:02:40.550> this<00:02:40.940> conversion<00:02:41.300> you're<00:02:41.570> going

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
depth with this conversion you're going

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:43.420 
depth with this conversion you're going
to<00:02:41.750> convert<00:02:42.110> your<00:02:42.260> body<00:02:42.560> weight<00:02:42.800> in<00:02:42.950> pounds<00:02:43.100> to

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
to convert your body weight in pounds to

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:44.890 
to convert your body weight in pounds to
kilograms<00:02:43.610> if<00:02:44.209> you<00:02:44.300> already<00:02:44.390> know<00:02:44.570> your<00:02:44.750> body

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
kilograms if you already know your body

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.750 
kilograms if you already know your body
weight<00:02:45.110> in<00:02:45.230> kilograms<00:02:45.380> just<00:02:46.130> start<00:02:46.459> with<00:02:46.610> that

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
weight in kilograms just start with that

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.060 
weight in kilograms just start with that
but<00:02:47.450> I<00:02:47.780> show<00:02:48.260> you<00:02:48.320> a<00:02:48.440> little<00:02:48.560> example<00:02:48.709> here

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.070 
but I show you a little example here

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:51.520 
but I show you a little example here
with<00:02:49.430> mine<00:02:49.730> and<00:02:50.150> then<00:02:50.959> what<00:02:51.200> you're<00:02:51.320> going<00:02:51.440> to

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
with mine and then what you're going to

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.199 
with mine and then what you're going to
do<00:02:51.739> is<00:02:52.010> you're<00:02:52.130> going<00:02:52.280> to<00:02:52.370> multiply<00:02:52.880> that<00:02:53.150> by

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:53.209 
do is you're going to multiply that by

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:56.350 
do is you're going to multiply that by
one<00:02:53.690> of<00:02:53.930> these<00:02:54.470> three<00:02:54.800> categories<00:02:55.520> if<00:02:56.209> you're

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
one of these three categories if you're

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.650 
one of these three categories if you're
an<00:02:56.420> adult<00:02:56.750> you<00:02:56.900> do<00:02:57.170> 35<00:02:57.709> children<00:02:58.489> and<00:02:59.030> infants

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 
an adult you do 35 children and infants

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:01.060 
an adult you do 35 children and infants
if<00:02:59.810> you<00:02:59.900> want<00:03:00.080> to<00:03:00.140> calculate<00:03:00.290> your<00:03:00.620> children

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.070 
if you want to calculate your children

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:04.150 
if you want to calculate your children
or<00:03:01.160> infants<00:03:01.580> you<00:03:01.730> can<00:03:01.880> do<00:03:01.970> that<00:03:02.120> too<00:03:03.040> well<00:03:04.040> what

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
or infants you can do that too well what

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:05.380 
or infants you can do that too well what
you're<00:03:04.250> going<00:03:04.430> to<00:03:04.489> do<00:03:04.610> is<00:03:04.820> that<00:03:05.030> number<00:03:05.209> you

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 
you're going to do is that number you

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:07.090 
you're going to do is that number you
got<00:03:05.510> previously<00:03:06.170> by<00:03:06.290> converting<00:03:06.739> your<00:03:06.860> body

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:07.100 
got previously by converting your body

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:08.440 
got previously by converting your body
weight<00:03:07.340> to<00:03:07.370> kilograms<00:03:07.850> you're<00:03:08.270> going<00:03:08.390> to

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
weight to kilograms you're going to

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:10.000 
weight to kilograms you're going to
multiply<00:03:08.840> by<00:03:09.050> the<00:03:09.080> number<00:03:09.230> you<00:03:09.500> chose<00:03:09.739> so<00:03:09.980> I

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
multiply by the number you chose so I

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:11.860 
multiply by the number you chose so I
would<00:03:10.340> fit<00:03:10.520> in<00:03:10.550> the<00:03:10.700> adult<00:03:10.940> category<00:03:11.390> so<00:03:11.720> i'm

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
would fit in the adult category so i'm

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.320 
would fit in the adult category so i'm
going<00:03:11.959> to<00:03:12.020> multiply<00:03:12.080> that<00:03:12.560> by<00:03:12.620> 35<00:03:13.310> and<00:03:13.790> then

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:14.330 
going to multiply that by 35 and then

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:16.120 
going to multiply that by 35 and then
that's<00:03:14.480> the<00:03:14.660> number<00:03:14.900> i<00:03:14.930> got<00:03:15.200> now<00:03:15.680> that's<00:03:15.920> how

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130 
that's the number i got now that's how

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:18.130 
that's the number i got now that's how
much<00:03:16.340> in<00:03:16.580> milliliters<00:03:17.209> i'm<00:03:17.630> supposed<00:03:18.019> to

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.140 
much in milliliters i'm supposed to

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.199 
much in milliliters i'm supposed to
drink<00:03:18.320> in<00:03:18.530> a<00:03:18.620> day<00:03:18.650> now<00:03:19.340> you<00:03:19.400> can<00:03:19.550> convert<00:03:19.970> that

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:20.209 
drink in a day now you can convert that

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:22.990 
drink in a day now you can convert that
to<00:03:20.540> leaders<00:03:21.440> by<00:03:21.620> dividing<00:03:22.040> by<00:03:22.160> a<00:03:22.190> thousand<00:03:22.820> and

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
to leaders by dividing by a thousand and

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.600 
to leaders by dividing by a thousand and
then<00:03:23.390> you<00:03:23.540> can<00:03:23.690> get<00:03:23.840> that<00:03:23.870> in<00:03:24.320> liters<00:03:25.280> of<00:03:25.489> how

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:25.610 
then you can get that in liters of how

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:26.770 
then you can get that in liters of how
much<00:03:25.820> you're<00:03:26.000> supposed<00:03:26.239> to<00:03:26.330> drink<00:03:26.480> in<00:03:26.660> day

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
much you're supposed to drink in day

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:28.800 
much you're supposed to drink in day
that's<00:03:27.230> actually<00:03:27.440> probably<00:03:27.739> more<00:03:27.950> accurate

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
that's actually probably more accurate

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:33.100 
that's actually probably more accurate
and<00:03:30.310> my<00:03:31.310> number<00:03:31.670> is<00:03:31.700> higher<00:03:32.000> than<00:03:32.330> what<00:03:32.810> it<00:03:33.050> was

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:33.110 
and my number is higher than what it was

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:35.500 
and my number is higher than what it was
just<00:03:33.680> dividing<00:03:34.070> it<00:03:34.220> by<00:03:34.400> two<00:03:34.610> so<00:03:35.150> if<00:03:35.239> you<00:03:35.330> want

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
just dividing it by two so if you want

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:38.259 
just dividing it by two so if you want
to<00:03:35.600> do<00:03:35.690> both<00:03:35.930> and<00:03:36.230> compare<00:03:36.290> them<00:03:37.000> that's<00:03:38.000> fine

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:38.269 
to do both and compare them that's fine

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:39.729 
to do both and compare them that's fine
but<00:03:38.510> that's<00:03:38.900> just<00:03:39.019> how<00:03:39.200> much<00:03:39.410> water<00:03:39.620> you

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:39.739 
but that's just how much water you

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:42.130 
but that's just how much water you
should<00:03:39.860> at<00:03:40.070> least<00:03:40.340> get<00:03:40.700> in<00:03:40.940> a<00:03:41.030> day<00:03:41.209> and<00:03:41.420> then<00:03:41.840> if
