beginning where it originates at her

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:56.250 
beginning where it originates at her
hairline<00:01:53.470> and<00:01:54.070> then<00:01:54.850> a<00:01:54.910> slightly<00:01:55.330> bolder<00:01:55.990> pop

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:56.260 
hairline and then a slightly bolder pop

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:00.300 
hairline and then a slightly bolder pop
at<00:01:56.560> the<00:01:56.590> ends<00:01:58.260> it's<00:01:59.260> also<00:01:59.530> really<00:02:00.070> great<00:02:00.280> for

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310 
at the ends it's also really great for

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.360 
at the ends it's also really great for
people<00:02:00.550> with<00:02:00.970> a<00:02:01.000> lot<00:02:01.270> of<00:02:01.300> hair<00:02:02.250> because<00:02:03.250> it

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:03.370 
people with a lot of hair because it

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:04.920 
people with a lot of hair because it
just<00:02:03.550> looks<00:02:03.730> more<00:02:03.940> natural<00:02:04.120> it<00:02:04.510> creates<00:02:04.840> a

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:04.930 
just looks more natural it creates a

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:09.210 
just looks more natural it creates a
ribbon<00:02:05.230> effect<00:02:07.470> as<00:02:08.470> you<00:02:08.590> can<00:02:08.800> see<00:02:09.040> I've<00:02:09.190> been

without heat or anything else and then

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:24.110 
without heat or anything else and then
I'm<00:03:21.000> going<00:03:21.180> to<00:03:21.240> gradually<00:03:21.690> apply<00:03:22.880> to<00:03:23.880> both

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
I'm going to gradually apply to both

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:31.360 
I'm going to gradually apply to both
sides<00:03:24.600> of<00:03:24.780> this<00:03:24.930> bottom<00:03:25.320> section

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:34.270 

and<00:03:31.640> I'll<00:03:32.060> probably<00:03:32.360> do<00:03:32.660> one<00:03:33.590> more<00:03:33.800> piece<00:03:34.040> in

then a few more smaller pieces on the
top<00:03:38.450> and<00:03:38.660> then<00:03:38.840> we'll<00:03:39.050> show<00:03:39.530> to<00:03:39.590> you<00:03:39.800> more<00:03:39.920> all
