lovely okay so here we have a white
piece<00:00:58.140> of<00:00:58.170> paper<00:00:58.399> and<00:01:01.519> that's<00:01:02.519> it<00:01:03.410> over<00:01:04.410> the

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
piece of paper and that's it over the

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.660 
piece of paper and that's it over the

white piece of paper bring it out to

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:15.649 
white piece of paper bring it out to
contrast<00:01:08.670> with<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.090> green<00:01:09.120> and<00:01:10.250> then<00:01:12.710> again

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:25.189 
so I shall now take some stills and then

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:35.410 
so I shall now take some stills and then
go<00:01:26.189> outside

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:45.910 

you

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.190 

so<00:01:46.920> here<00:01:47.340> we<00:01:47.429> are<00:01:47.460> at<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:47.850> front<00:01:48.000> said<00:01:48.689> X<00:01:48.840> 3<00:01:49.140> and

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
so here we are at the front said X 3 and

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.819 
so here we are at the front said X 3 and
X<00:01:49.469> 5<00:01:50.420> all<00:01:51.420> the<00:01:51.539> planes<00:01:51.810> have<00:01:52.020> gone<00:01:52.229> for<00:01:52.649> some

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
X 5 all the planes have gone for some

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.969 
X 5 all the planes have gone for some
reason<00:01:53.929> normally<00:01:54.929> they<00:01:55.049> come<00:01:55.319> over<00:01:55.590> every

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
reason normally they come over every

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.700 
reason normally they come over every
sort<00:01:56.429> of<00:01:56.460> half<00:01:56.670> hour<00:01:56.880> well<00:01:57.469> every<00:01:58.469> minute

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
sort of half hour well every minute

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.350 
sort of half hour well every minute
actually<00:02:00.049> but<00:02:01.049> for<00:02:01.200> some<00:02:01.380> reason<00:02:02.329> they're<00:02:03.329> not

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
actually but for some reason they're not

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:11.090 
actually but for some reason they're not
there

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.100 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:17.300 

it<00:02:11.880> is<00:02:12.090> quite<00:02:12.390> noisy<00:02:12.570> as<00:02:12.990> you<00:02:13.170> can<00:02:13.380> hear<00:02:16.310> there

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
it is quite noisy as you can hear there

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:35.810 
it is quite noisy as you can hear there
we<00:02:17.400> go

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:40.650 

so<00:02:36.820> that's<00:02:37.270> I'm<00:02:37.720> doing<00:02:38.020> WVGA<00:02:39.390> thought<00:02:40.390> I'd<00:02:40.510> do

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
so that's I'm doing WVGA thought I'd do

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:44.610 
so that's I'm doing WVGA thought I'd do
a<00:02:40.690> WVGA<00:02:41.350> test<00:02:42.000> during<00:02:43.000> the<00:02:43.120> day<00:02:43.620> and

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
a WVGA test during the day and

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.590 
a WVGA test during the day and
aeroplanes<00:02:45.220> just<00:02:45.460> gone<00:02:45.670> over<00:02:45.970> it<00:02:46.210> wasn't<00:02:46.510> very

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
aeroplanes just gone over it wasn't very

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.940 
aeroplanes just gone over it wasn't very
loud<00:02:46.840> one<00:02:47.110> though<00:02:49.110> maybe<00:02:50.110> when<00:02:50.410> more<00:02:50.620> planes

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
loud one though maybe when more planes

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.590 
loud one though maybe when more planes
come<00:02:51.250> over<00:02:51.490> I'll<00:02:51.640> come<00:02:51.670> and<00:02:52.030> do<00:02:52.180> it<00:02:52.270> again<00:02:54.600> so

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:55.600 
come over I'll come and do it again so

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.540 
come over I'll come and do it again so
there<00:02:55.960> you<00:02:56.020> go<00:02:56.200> that's<00:02:56.410> the<00:02:56.710> sound<00:02:57.160> and

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:57.550 
there you go that's the sound and

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:00.810 
there you go that's the sound and
airplane<00:02:58.120> test<00:02:59.160> don't<00:03:00.160> know<00:03:00.220> if<00:03:00.280> you<00:03:00.370> can<00:03:00.550> see

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:00.820 
airplane test don't know if you can see

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:04.040 
airplane test don't know if you can see
that<00:03:01.000> over<00:03:01.300> there<00:03:01.450> but<00:03:01.690> there's<00:03:01.870> one<00:03:02.050> there

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 
that over there but there's one there

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:07.050
