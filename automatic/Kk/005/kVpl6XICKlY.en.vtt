the sniper and stuff but my ratios 1.85
it's<00:01:47.280> actually<00:01:47.520> higher<00:01:47.670> than<00:01:47.700> it<00:01:47.939> was<00:01:47.970> in

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
it's actually higher than it was in

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.389 
it's actually higher than it was in
black<00:01:48.420> ops<00:01:48.659> 2<00:01:48.810> so<00:01:49.290> that's<00:01:49.590> I'm<00:01:49.950> actually<00:01:50.220> doing

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399

pretty<00:01:50.490> good<00:01:50.759> at<00:01:50.880> this<00:01:51.000> game<00:01:51.829> because<00:01:52.829> if<00:01:53.040> you

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
pretty good at this game because if you

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.289 
pretty good at this game because if you
guys<00:01:53.220> remember<00:01:53.340> Preston's<00:01:53.909> was<00:01:54.030> that<00:01:54.149> like

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
guys remember Preston's was that like

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.109 
guys remember Preston's was that like
for<00:01:54.619> 4.5<00:01:55.619> or<00:01:55.649> something<00:01:56.130> so<00:01:56.310> ghost<00:01:56.939> is<00:01:57.060> a

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
for 4.5 or something so ghost is a

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.670 
for 4.5 or something so ghost is a
little<00:01:57.329> bit<00:01:57.450> harder<00:01:57.750> to<00:01:57.780> get<00:01:57.960> a<00:01:58.020> high<00:01:58.200> KD<00:01:58.380> could

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
little bit harder to get a high KD could

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.350 
little bit harder to get a high KD could
you<00:01:58.770> die<00:01:58.950> so<00:01:59.159> easily<00:01:59.189> but<00:01:59.640> it's<00:02:00.210> actually

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
you die so easily but it's actually

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.209 
you die so easily but it's actually
pretty<00:02:00.630> good<00:02:00.810> um<00:02:01.049> oh<00:02:01.380> I<00:02:01.439> keep<00:02:01.799> going<00:02:01.890> to<00:02:02.040> kills
