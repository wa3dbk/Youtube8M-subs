00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:09.950
 boxing at the base of this sport 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:10.820
 fighting that requires a big 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:13.850
 physical condition 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:16.480
 it is this tour of opposite is really 

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:16.480
 launched by the opposition 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.560

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.379
 as he is 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:06.090
 within this club 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.520
 my goal was to go to a club of 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.590
 boxing assault boxing assault normally 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.840
 if we really get into the council of 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.590
 the boxing federation is the 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.270
 educational boxing 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.649
 that is to say it is the same technique the 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.869
 same physical condition as boxing 

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:20.250
 English but on the other hand we speak only 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.570
 of keys no cuts 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.189
 whatever the age and the section is 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.409
 open everyone found his account 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.270
 older will keep a condition 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.039
 swimming physics means and that we 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.119
 go over to lose weight like 

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:31.530
 some other sections a 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.850
 forty years old which are unchanged 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.580
 from before father saw him what they have a 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.679
 squeeze and next to that the most 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:39.179
 young people just to discover a sport 

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:41.220
 who in their pleasure and so of them 

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:43.940
 prepare for the passage in a real 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.940
 los andes club 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.420
 two seconds 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:53.870
 and 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:10.560
 we are taking off our legs then 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:14.989
 tomato fought on Sunday and in the 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.989
 victory but fight as amateur 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.580
 type and same time that they train 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.010
 at thunder it's been since september 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:26.950

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.180
 boxing year would be so it's patrick 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.660
 who is a head coach 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:34.630
 this is an adventure that brought me 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:36.280
 until for a first fight was 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:38.320
 very well it's great we take 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.340
 really did not you feel 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:41.690
 make 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.640
 it was stressful anyway but 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.770
 frankly it's past I was fine 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.230
 framed 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:48.710
 which went well in terms 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.900
 following 

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:52.900
