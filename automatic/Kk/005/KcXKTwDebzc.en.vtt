00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.640
 doing so in the cdu should be for all games 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.650
 more than adequate and even he 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.789
 Games in two three years should then 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.970

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.180
 enough games and when needed can 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.230

 So everything was up to date 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:01.020
 b65 chip set is enough for everything then 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:05.250
 as hard disk a terabyte seagate 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:07.140

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.270
 each sufficiently only under circumstances 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:15.720
 sometimes she gets loud then 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:24.450

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.840
 all players at the time except 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:32.040
 probably all the games up on 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.869
 crysis 3 at maximum settings and 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.479
 It also has a village a cooler 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.520
 making the card is very quiet as

 power e9 with 80plus gold as networker 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.899
 should be loose enough for everything too 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:48.540
 if you still want to upgrade and 80 plus 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:51.570
 gold is very economical then a dvd 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:55.409
 burner from lg and as housing saw one 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.880
 For example, the tower of the circle as always 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.490
