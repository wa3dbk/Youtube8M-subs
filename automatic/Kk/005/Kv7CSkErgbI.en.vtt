00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.990
 well in this video we are going now to teach 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:12.769
 you are going to learn how to configure 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:14.280
 a software for taking pictures is the one 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:17.550
 comes 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:20.520
 with the devices it 's pretty good 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.539
 but there are other applications that allow 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.509
 take better pictures 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:30.370
 in regards to the software that comes 

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:32.680
 quickly pre-installed what we can 

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:35.520
 appreciate is that here we have the option 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:38.480
 for photo 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.930
 or for filming 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.930
 d 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:50.060
 on the left side 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:53.590
 we have an option to change between 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:57.120
 Rear lens and front lens 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:57.120
 it is also very useful to know 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:04.290
 the timing option is to say that 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:07.500
 Take the picture after 5 seconds of 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.500
 click on it 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:16.260
 the capture mode is to say if it is 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:21.110
 panoramic 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:25.240
 If I want to detect smiles and so on 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.240
 and here in configuration 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:33.690
 something that new interior always 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.690
 change is the resolution of the photo 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.579
 that is to say 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.729
 the weight that the photo will have each photo 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:44.399
 at this moment he will have a weight of 3 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:49.560
 2 megabytes with a resolution of 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:53.179
 2048 x 1536 but if I wanted to save 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:57.530
 a little bit of memory from the micro sim 

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:57.530
 I could for example download it 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:05.920
 at a resolution of 2048 x 1152 or 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:10.050
 you are testing the resolution that 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.050
 find it more pleasant 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:19.900
 let's leave it for example 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:20.870
 1600 x 1200 each picture will weigh 2000 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.450
 expenses 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:26.110
 very well 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:28.810
 let's get out of here 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.610
 we are going to install another program that we 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.980
 will allow me to take photos I'm going to clay 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.640
 store 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:37.450
 I'm going to the magnifying glass 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.450
 I write 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.379
 who leaves me 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:49.019
 Remember you should always read 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:54.069
 and the comments of the people 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.550
 we quickly see that there are 5 here 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:59.550
 stars says super great 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:01.770
 and it says to our application here says 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:04.200
 this editor is one of the best I have 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:06.570
 tried that is to say they speak very well of the 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.060
 application always read the comments 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:11.090
 of the people 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.860
 and check that there is nothing negative 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.630
 about the program you 're wanting 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:17.690
 install 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:21.380
 You can also check the photos with the 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:23.730
 previous and in this case I'm also going to 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:25.650
 click on install 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:27.390
 you also have to be careful in the 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:30.360
 weight remember not all devices 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:33.360
 they have enough memory but in 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:36.450
 this case we see that this software weighs 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:38.480
 18 megabytes that for the tablet is not 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:41.790
 no problem can be installed 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:45.000
 they also have to read the permits 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:47.660
 the application and I accept all this I already 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.400
 I have done it previously 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:52.110
 the application is going to install are 18 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:56.160
 measures that are being downloaded in this 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:59.490
 moment while downloading I will 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:03.770
 explain on the other phone quickly 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:03.770
 how the application works 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:09.800
 here I have the theme icon was in 

00:04:06.999 --> 00:04:12.380
 reality the first thing I noticed is that 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:14.240
 the icon that comes predefined from 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:16.790
 Gallery 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:19.410
 to see the photos 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:23.550
 it's not that good 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:24.740
 as the icon that has that mega here if 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:26.810
 I 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:30.050
 use the one that is predefined in the 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:32.020
 phone the truth that when I look for something 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:35.139
 many times I do not find 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:40.550
 it's a little harder to find 

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:43.550
 photos but if I take a look 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:43.550
 immediately 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:47.830
 once I load I have the option to 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:50.530
 Gallery 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:53.740
 and in gallery they appear quickly 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:55.740
 all the photos 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:05:01.080
 and distributed in a fairly 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:01.080
 friendly to recognize them 

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:07.660
 you can take the picture 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:07.660
 Y 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:13.570
 I can delete it share them etc. 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:20.710
 well if we see now in the other 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:24.770
 device has already installed the program 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:27.320
 I'm going to click on open I recommend them 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:30.170
 who also watch the video 

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:32.630
 it's very good helps them have an idea 

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:35.200
 general of everything that the 

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:35.200
 application 

00:05:36.569 --> 00:05:42.110
 here it indicates me 

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:44.740
 to open the camera or open the gallery 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:44.740
 in this case 

00:05:45.409 --> 00:05:48.610
 I'm going to open the gallery 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:53.930
 give me a little help 

00:05:53.969 --> 00:05:57.949
 all the options that I can do 

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:02.760
 quickly I could indicate them by 

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:04.729
 example 

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:07.849
 although it can be done as 

00:06:04.729 --> 00:06:10.580
 the photos that you take with this software 

00:06:07.849 --> 00:06:13.930
 here I could for example 

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:13.930
 make a small collage 

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:21.680
 I have help again 

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:21.680
 click on more 

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:27.080
 as for example another photo 

00:06:43.849 --> 00:06:47.319
 how to put a third photo 

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:55.510
 I can relocate the biggest things 

00:06:52.389 --> 00:06:58.470
 smaller and very quickly I have already 

00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:58.470
 small tails 

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:01.310
 ports 

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:08.940
 and I apply 

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:13.080
 let's save 

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:30.290
 our photo is ready or better said 

00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:30.290
 our collage of photos
