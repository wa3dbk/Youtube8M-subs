00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:05.610
 ah 

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:11.559
 hello welcome to a new video for 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.870
 my blog life the green in this case I 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:16.810
 I felt committed to show you the 

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:18.730
 result of what we did with the 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:20.410
 crystal of the aloe once the 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:22.599
 we wash for them can watch the video 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:24.820
 which I'm going to leave the link here in 

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:27.220
 the bottom part what we did this 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:29.079
 once was cutting the aloe crystal one 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:32.980
 Once it was washed and that we extracted 

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:34.840
 all the musel I make this book in 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:37.360
 this case could show you what the 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:39.910
 result we select the 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:42.220
 crystal and we made little packets 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:44.920
 wrapped with aluminum foil and 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:47.500
 place in the freezer here can 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.090
 see in this case I did all these that 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.620
 are I'm going to show you 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:53.620
 continuation 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:56.140
 then in the case of the crisis of 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:58.269
 Hemorrhoids of course should consult 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.460
 to your doctor however these 

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:02.949
 suppositories are used by the 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:05.650
 anti-inflammatory effect exerted by the 

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:09.369
 crystal of aloe in the affected area 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:12.280
 and because of the cold in being in the 

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:16.540
 freezer the cold causes relief and 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:19.479
 causes an anti-inflammatory effect in this 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:21.450
 case they could see how they look if 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:22.740
 they want to use as a way 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.829
 suppositories 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.810
 Now I heard that chance before 

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:29.850
 freeze it when we are in the 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:33.270
 previous video of the glass of the classrooms 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:35.040
 I elaborated the time that made it bigger than 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.310
 so I told them that they can 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:41.280
 use it also as soaps in a way 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:44.220
 of relief for skin against redness 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.530
 by the effect of the sun when children go 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.960
 to the pool or go to the beach in a way 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.450
 also a soap 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.450
 we see that aloe also has a 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.790
 Effect on lightening skin spots 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:58.560
 has a disinfecting effect on what 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.600
 It is the people who suffer from acne 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.210
 it means that these soap can be 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.300
 also use on the face once 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.489
 that you use, you can go back to 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:10.979
 refrigerator or if you want to keep it 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:14.069
 they put back in the paper of 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:17.130
 aluminum and in this way they return it to 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:20.640
 take to the top of the refrigerator 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:22.260
 at freezing temperatures this is 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.810
 everything I wanted to present to you for the 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:27.720
 today so I hope that they 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:30.510
 be very useful and thank you for your
