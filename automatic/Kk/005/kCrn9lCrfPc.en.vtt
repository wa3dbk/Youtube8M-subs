00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:11.730
 hello we have a rain here 

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:18.119
 I decided to shoot you a video about a snail joke 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:21.750
 Of course I want to share one 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:25.140
 I do nâ€™t know by observation ask a question 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:30.449
 be someone too noticed this in general 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:34.280
 comrade gave me to sharpen his 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:36.899
 new knife ontario rat 1 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:40.980
 that's 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:42.329
 sharpening it I found one 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.820
 enough 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:48.030
 curious but in the context of this knife 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.579
 pay attention to this detail 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:01:00.140
 the line that shine here by 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:01:05.070
 see the edge of the butt on the butt removed chamfer 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:07.500
 Well this is actually something that in other 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:12.990
 knives for granted 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:15.840
 Of course, but here we take a knife that I 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.880
 got a few months ago on this 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.220
 This is the one that Ontario sent me 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.759
 guarantees 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:27.900
 notice the shoes are just sharp 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:29.040
 and these details are always justified by 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:34.250
 what here 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:41.159
 but what essentially survived here 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:43.110
 something needs to be struck on this 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.659
 magnesium mind rod 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.710
 to visit the fire and that butt 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.229
 it will be very convenient but 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:54.159
 somehow there was really a lot 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:58.540
 complaints at this moment and even met 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:02:05.380
 and reviews from people who have cut themselves 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:07.780
 about this shoe and kick here the knife is fresh 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:13.060
 brand new bought just a couple of weeks 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:15.459
 back 2014 and know was not 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:21.450
 nice enough to see it because 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:23.709
 I consider this treatment 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.900
 increasing the cost of production that is it it 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:28.600
 already more complicated and then there is still some 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:32.080
 stage in the demolition of these here 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:36.430
 sharp corners and I was very pleased 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:39.640
 see on on such a budget plain 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:43.180
 on the same as a completely different attitude 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:46.650
 the fact that reigns in general to us alive 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:49.709
 the market yes that is to reduce the price we go 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:52.540
 very small such as if 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:55.690
 insignificant but still improving i 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:59.019
 I think that more people 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:02.890
 will appreciate it at the moment because she even 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:05.860
 those who were relatively indifferent here 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:11.850
 such a sharp butt on their water 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:15.549
 so here beside me 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:22.630
 more will be those who rejoice 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:27.370
 such a change in terms of processing 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:31.200
 blade basically all the same but so 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:35.680
 I just wanted to share a little ask 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:40.450
 have seen have not seen what you think is beauty 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:42.910
 our champion which year already and just 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:46.060
 I hope you all had a good knife 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:48.930
 interesting thanks for watching bye 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.930
 bye Bye
