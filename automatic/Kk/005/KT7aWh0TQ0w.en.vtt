from every other flashlight out there in

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:17.740 
from every other flashlight out there in
one<00:00:16.430> respect<00:00:16.580> just<00:00:17.270> like<00:00:17.300> every<00:00:17.630> other

flashlight it has a really nice little

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.150 
flashlight it has a really nice little
flashlight<00:00:20.570> pattern<00:00:21.050> got<00:00:21.650> a<00:00:21.680> very<00:00:21.890> bright

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:22.160 
flashlight pattern got a very bright

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:23.560 
flashlight pattern got a very bright
center<00:00:22.520> spot<00:00:22.820> in<00:00:22.970> the<00:00:23.060> middle<00:00:23.240> of<00:00:23.330> it<00:00:23.419> and<00:00:23.509> a

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:23.570 
center spot in the middle of it and a

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:25.330 
center spot in the middle of it and a
great<00:00:23.750> little<00:00:23.900> halo<00:00:24.169> of<00:00:24.439> light<00:00:24.470> the

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:25.340 
great little halo of light the

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:26.980 
great little halo of light the
efficiency<00:00:25.849> of<00:00:25.880> this<00:00:26.090> light<00:00:26.300> is<00:00:26.330> really<00:00:26.779> high

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:26.990 
efficiency of this light is really high

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:29.279 
efficiency of this light is really high
in<00:00:27.529> that<00:00:27.740> it<00:00:27.890> will<00:00:28.070> throw<00:00:28.430> a<00:00:28.460> beam<00:00:28.760> of<00:00:28.939> light

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:29.289 
in that it will throw a beam of light

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:32.109 
in that it will throw a beam of light
approximately<00:00:30.289> 900<00:00:30.859> feet<00:00:31.070> so<00:00:31.640> it's<00:00:31.789> a<00:00:31.880> very

00:00:32.109 --> 00:00:32.119 
approximately 900 feet so it's a very

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:34.299 
approximately 900 feet so it's a very
very<00:00:32.330> good<00:00:32.390> long-range<00:00:33.170> flashlight<00:00:33.710> very

00:00:34.299 --> 00:00:34.309 
very good long-range flashlight very

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:36.729 
very good long-range flashlight very
powerful<00:00:34.760> about<00:00:34.910> 220<00:00:35.629> limits<00:00:36.019> but<00:00:36.620> the

00:00:36.729 --> 00:00:36.739 
powerful about 220 limits but the

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:38.320 
powerful about 220 limits but the
problem<00:00:37.160> that<00:00:37.190> you<00:00:37.400> have<00:00:37.550> when<00:00:37.850> you<00:00:37.940> do<00:00:38.150> that

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:38.330 
problem that you have when you do that

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:40.390 
problem that you have when you do that
because<00:00:38.900> any<00:00:39.260> time<00:00:39.410> a<00:00:39.440> manufacturer<00:00:40.100> makes<00:00:40.280> a

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:40.400 
because any time a manufacturer makes a

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.219 
because any time a manufacturer makes a
like<00:00:40.640> that<00:00:40.910> is<00:00:41.030> very<00:00:41.120> bright<00:00:41.600> and<00:00:41.660> throws<00:00:42.080> the

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:42.229 
like that is very bright and throws the

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:44.829 
like that is very bright and throws the
light<00:00:42.409> very<00:00:42.710> far<00:00:43.040> is<00:00:43.670> it's<00:00:43.970> too<00:00:44.299> much<00:00:44.540> life

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:44.839 
light very far is it's too much life

00:00:44.839 --> 00:00:46.780 
light very far is it's too much life
when<00:00:45.080> we<00:00:45.140> try<00:00:45.350> to<00:00:45.379> use<00:00:45.650> it<00:00:45.680> close<00:00:46.010> up<00:00:46.309> it

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:46.790 
when we try to use it close up it

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:49.210 
when we try to use it close up it
literally<00:00:47.180> overwhelms<00:00:47.930> your<00:00:48.080> eyes<00:00:48.260> and<00:00:49.100> you

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:49.220 
literally overwhelms your eyes and you

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:50.670 
literally overwhelms your eyes and you
actually<00:00:49.610> lose<00:00:49.820> some<00:00:49.879> of<00:00:50.180> your<00:00:50.360> night<00:00:50.570> vision

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:50.680 
actually lose some of your night vision

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.590 
actually lose some of your night vision
it's<00:00:51.680> not<00:00:51.890> there's<00:00:52.250> too<00:00:52.549> much<00:00:52.760> light<00:00:53.119> it's<00:00:53.449> the

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600 
it's not there's too much light it's the

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.530 
it's not there's too much light it's the
pattern<00:00:53.989> of<00:00:54.260> the<00:00:54.350> light<00:00:54.559> is<00:00:54.710> wrong<00:00:55.299> that's<00:00:56.299> why

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:56.540 
pattern of the light is wrong that's why

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.479 
pattern of the light is wrong that's why
when<00:00:56.750> we<00:00:56.960> talk<00:00:56.989> about<00:00:57.229> a<00:00:57.500> deal<00:00:57.769> innovation

00:00:58.479 --> 00:00:58.489 
when we talk about a deal innovation

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:00.369 
when we talk about a deal innovation
product<00:00:58.970> from<00:00:59.059> Bay<00:00:59.269> Co<00:00:59.540> we're<00:00:59.989> talking<00:01:00.290> about

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:00.379 
product from Bay Co we're talking about

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:02.049 
product from Bay Co we're talking about
a<00:01:00.500> light<00:01:00.799> that<00:01:01.070> has<00:01:01.220> not<00:01:01.430> only<00:01:01.580> a<00:01:01.699> flashlight

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:02.059 
a light that has not only a flashlight

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:04.630 
a light that has not only a flashlight
but<00:01:02.930> also<00:01:03.140> as<00:01:03.830> a<00:01:03.920> floodlight

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:04.640 
but also as a floodlight

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.600 
but also as a floodlight
now<00:01:05.479> here's<00:01:05.840> the<00:01:06.020> difference<00:01:06.610> floodlight

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610 
now here's the difference floodlight

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.219 
now here's the difference floodlight
creates<00:01:08.000> a<00:01:08.150> whole<00:01:08.390> different<00:01:08.420> pattern<00:01:09.110> of

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:09.229 
creates a whole different pattern of

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:11.620 
creates a whole different pattern of
life<00:01:09.439> one<00:01:10.250> where<00:01:10.430> there<00:01:10.610> is<00:01:10.790> no<00:01:11.000> bright<00:01:11.270> center

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
life one where there is no bright center

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:13.840 
life one where there is no bright center
spot<00:01:11.930> so<00:01:12.560> you're<00:01:12.710> able<00:01:12.830> to<00:01:12.979> illuminate<00:01:13.340> an

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
spot so you're able to illuminate an

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:15.880 
spot so you're able to illuminate an
area<00:01:14.030> that's<00:01:14.390> close<00:01:14.719> to<00:01:15.079> you<00:01:15.259> without

area that's close to you without

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.370 
area that's close to you without
creating<00:01:16.490> that<00:01:16.640> hot<00:01:16.909> spot<00:01:17.090> so<00:01:17.780> now<00:01:17.990> you<00:01:18.049> have

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380 
creating that hot spot so now you have

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.669 
creating that hot spot so now you have
two<00:01:18.649> tools<00:01:18.920> one<00:01:19.729> for<00:01:20.030> distance<00:01:20.450> and<00:01:20.659> one<00:01:21.380> for

00:01:21.669 --> 00:01:21.679 
two tools one for distance and one for

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:23.950 
two tools one for distance and one for
close-up<00:01:22.189> to<00:01:22.700> be<00:01:22.820> able<00:01:22.969> to<00:01:23.119> illuminate<00:01:23.840> an

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
close-up to be able to illuminate an

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.709 
close-up to be able to illuminate an
area<00:01:24.159> now<00:01:25.159> the<00:01:25.670> best<00:01:25.880> news<00:01:26.179> of<00:01:26.210> all<00:01:26.420> is<00:01:26.689> that
