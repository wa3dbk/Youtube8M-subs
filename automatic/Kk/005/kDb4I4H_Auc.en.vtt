00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.970
 and then the request came to show how 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:08.040
 you play spoons wise and that's what I want 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.660
 like to try them there then start a trick 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.400
 because actually supplies is wise 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.519
 a number in la 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.560
 in a in this agreement is just more 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.109
 you can play it is more fun 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.890
 put your cappon probe on the second box 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.460
 sit 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.009
 and then you can actually 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:27.380
 playing from a song called handle 

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:29.500
 then you actually start k 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:29.500
 Allah 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.860
 but the way you sometimes put it is 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:37.269
 done because here it is broken so we 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.269
 now just think in school 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:46.809
 the intro is a minor 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.809
 an hour y 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.820
 nd 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.300
 and you can deviate slightly from such an intro 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.300
 play for example 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.330
 but by playing a little with you 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.850
 fingers 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:09.270
 super honor to you means that you 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.270
 one the games 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:24.990
 that's the intro the song itself is 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:27.860
 actually very simple and true 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:33.400
 and we 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:33.400
 from your lamina and from your one 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:38.230
 and another one 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:40.440
 and then the day 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:44.290
 then again a minor 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:46.120
 and now my actual one without being too 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:47.470
 know played a full penalty then 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:49.990
 you come to the chorus 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:52.980
 tralala 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:55.710
 tralala 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:58.810
 and offer 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.060
 and in the and to the door 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.049
 in a minor 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.049
 and a 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.460
 and none 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:12.099
 and d 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:16.140
 So now play in rhythm and then you get 

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:16.140
 punish and run there 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:51.430
 and 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.040
 we are actually already there because that 

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:01.260
 a bridge is coming 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.269
 this is so you will first intro 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.640
 stew and chorus a stanza and over and over 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:08.250
 then you have a bridge and unexpected 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.689
 piece that comes in the song and that 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:17.780
 goes that leaves from the village 

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:22.130
 so a and the d 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:26.150
 and the one of your day 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:28.319
 zenus do and since relieving commercials 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:29.650
 after the 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:32.129
 of your date 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.129
 and then d-7 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:36.050
 it's okay 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:39.100
 this one 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:41.600
 just stuff in a debit card why 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:45.460
 because always learn to call box food 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.460
 because that's how you know sammy 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:51.390
 No 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.540
 Hey 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.689
 tell me 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.689
 No 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:09.490
 do you have a solo and that actually works 

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:11.380
 about 

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:13.030
 then you have a laid piece because it is 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:14.980
 again just a stophy you have it 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:17.200
 end chorus and there comes something in which 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:19.380
 the other nice real towns and cities 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.380
 lines 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:36.009
 navy 

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:45.380
 now you would basically have the whole song 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:47.480
 If it weren't for it 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:49.010
 song also sees and has a tail 

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:54.370
 very different chords 

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:55.190
 with an der drau 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:57.730
 a 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:57.730
 and and 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:02.620
 here and so 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:05.689
 jc and therefore in c 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:08.320
 is music and the 

00:05:05.689 --> 00:05:13.230
 yes and no 

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:13.230
 and did i did 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:17.810
 the 

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:24.630
 I am 

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:51.349
 all right 

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:59.260
 they must be under his shoe is up to you 

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:01.030
 anyway 

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.950
 you tell the secret of this on 

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:05.770
 percussion that is you just had two 

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:07.480
 tablespoons you do not put that spoon 

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:08.710
 wise but actually opposite each other 

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:11.530
 on each other 

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:13.900
 you put your index finger in between and then 

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:17.320
 you lie on my knee and you will notice as 

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:19.750
 you then think that gives a sound and you 

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:22.290
 can then make rhythms through your other hand 

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:22.290
 also your places 

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:30.780
 charge shock if you have other surfaces 

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:30.780
 I can't remember how it is possible 

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:39.450
 and actually i was something a woman 

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:39.450
 required 

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:51.900
 it's not really my goal anymore
