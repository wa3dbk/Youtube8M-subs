00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
on the Apple find 5 but it might just be

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:17.990 
on the Apple find 5 but it might just be
because<00:04:15.930> I<00:04:16.139> have<00:04:16.470> the<00:04:16.680> launcher<00:04:17.160> that's<00:04:17.700> still

about<00:05:15.860> Facebook<00:05:16.860> home<00:05:17.010> and<00:05:17.220> Facebook

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:17.580 
about Facebook home and Facebook

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:20.180 
about Facebook home and Facebook
messaging<00:05:18.150> anyway<00:05:18.630> is<00:05:18.870> the<00:05:19.470> chat<00:05:19.680> heads<00:05:19.890> and

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:20.190 
messaging anyway is the chat heads and

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:22.130 
messaging anyway is the chat heads and
here<00:05:20.940> the<00:05:21.120> chat<00:05:21.330> heads<00:05:21.510> the<00:05:21.720> only<00:05:21.870> thing<00:05:22.050> that

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:22.140 
here the chat heads the only thing that

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:24.610 
here the chat heads the only thing that
are<00:05:22.230> supported<00:05:22.620> on<00:05:22.680> the<00:05:22.800> chat<00:05:23.010> heads<00:05:23.220> are<00:05:23.480> the

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:24.620 
are supported on the chat heads are the

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:27.050 
are supported on the chat heads are the
notifications<00:05:25.620> or<00:05:25.770> messaging<00:05:26.280> from<00:05:26.580> Facebook

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:27.060 
notifications or messaging from Facebook

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:29.720 
notifications or messaging from Facebook
alone<00:05:27.330> but<00:05:28.230> I<00:05:28.380> think<00:05:28.710> that<00:05:28.920> the<00:05:29.130> most<00:05:29.400> pure

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:29.730 
alone but I think that the most pure

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:32.270 
alone but I think that the most pure
experience<00:05:30.330> here<00:05:30.600> really<00:05:31.050> is<00:05:31.230> on<00:05:31.410> the<00:05:31.590> Nexus<00:05:31.980> 4

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:32.280 
experience here really is on the Nexus 4

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:35.270 
experience here really is on the Nexus 4
because<00:05:32.760> the<00:05:33.240> HTC<00:05:33.750> first<00:05:34.080> also<00:05:34.380> runs<00:05:34.950> stock

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:35.280 
because the HTC first also runs stock

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:38.480 
because the HTC first also runs stock
Android<00:05:35.760> but<00:05:36.060> it<00:05:36.180> runs<00:05:36.410> 4.1<00:05:37.410> and<00:05:37.620> what<00:05:38.400> the

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:38.490 
Android but it runs 4.1 and what the

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:41.780 
Android but it runs 4.1 and what the
Nexus<00:05:38.910> you're<00:05:39.090> running<00:05:39.450> 4.2<00:05:40.050> and<00:05:40.490> if<00:05:41.490> you<00:05:41.640> just

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:41.790 
Nexus you're running 4.2 and if you just

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:44.060 
Nexus you're running 4.2 and if you just
go<00:05:41.970> back<00:05:42.150> you<00:05:42.480> go<00:05:42.660> right<00:05:42.960> back<00:05:42.990> to<00:05:43.500> stock

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:44.070 
go back you go right back to stock

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:47.630 
go back you go right back to stock
Android<00:05:44.430> but<00:05:45.210> you<00:05:45.240> can<00:05:45.600> have<00:05:46.230> home<00:05:46.560> mixed<00:05:47.460> with

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:47.640 
Android but you can have home mixed with

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:49.850 
Android but you can have home mixed with
stock<00:05:48.150> Android<00:05:48.600> and<00:05:48.840> this<00:05:49.050> is<00:05:49.169> exactly<00:05:49.320> how<00:05:49.830> I

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:49.860 
stock Android and this is exactly how I

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:52.970 
stock Android and this is exactly how I
think<00:05:50.160> that<00:05:50.580> they<00:05:50.760> had<00:05:51.000> it<00:05:51.390> meant<00:05:51.810> to<00:05:51.960> be<00:05:51.990> with

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:52.980 
think that they had it meant to be with

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:55.760 
think that they had it meant to be with
the<00:05:53.370> HTC<00:05:54.090> first<00:05:54.330> so<00:05:54.870> this<00:05:55.290> makes<00:05:55.530> it<00:05:55.650> really

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:55.770 
the HTC first so this makes it really

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:57.590 
the HTC first so this makes it really
cool<00:05:56.070> because<00:05:56.250> you<00:05:56.340> have<00:05:56.669> the<00:05:57.000> software

00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:57.600 
cool because you have the software

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:59.210 
cool because you have the software
buttons<00:05:57.930> and<00:05:58.140> it<00:05:58.620> brings<00:05:58.860> extra

00:05:59.210 --> 00:05:59.220 
buttons and it brings extra

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:01.190 
buttons and it brings extra
functionality<00:05:59.910> there<00:06:00.090> and<00:06:00.390> you<00:06:00.720> have<00:06:00.930> Google

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:01.200 
functionality there and you have Google

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:03.710 
functionality there and you have Google
now<00:06:01.500> still<00:06:01.980> that<00:06:02.580> is<00:06:02.850> shortcutted<00:06:03.540> right

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:03.720 
now still that is shortcutted right

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:05.810 
now still that is shortcutted right
there<00:06:04.020> without<00:06:04.320> a<00:06:04.500> problem<00:06:04.800> and<00:06:05.190> you<00:06:05.610> have<00:06:05.730> the

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:05.820 
there without a problem and you have the

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:07.730 
there without a problem and you have the
back<00:06:06.030> button<00:06:06.360> and<00:06:06.570> your<00:06:06.750> multitasking<00:06:07.440> button

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:07.740 
back button and your multitasking button

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:09.590 
back button and your multitasking button
and<00:06:07.980> I<00:06:08.040> think<00:06:08.280> that<00:06:08.490> it<00:06:08.669> actually<00:06:08.910> brings<00:06:09.330> some

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:09.600 
and I think that it actually brings some

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:12.290 
and I think that it actually brings some
functionality<00:06:10.380> to<00:06:11.040> this<00:06:11.370> Facebook<00:06:11.910> launcher

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:12.300 
functionality to this Facebook launcher

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:15.050 
functionality to this Facebook launcher
since<00:06:12.630> it's<00:06:12.840> just<00:06:13.110> very<00:06:13.290> basic<00:06:13.590> but<00:06:14.490> I<00:06:14.700> found

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:15.060 
since it's just very basic but I found

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:17.330 
since it's just very basic but I found
myself<00:06:15.260> pretty<00:06:16.260> much<00:06:16.350> uninstalling<00:06:17.040> this

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:17.340 
myself pretty much uninstalling this

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:20.240 
myself pretty much uninstalling this
after<00:06:17.730> 24<00:06:18.180> hours<00:06:18.590> you<00:06:19.590> just<00:06:19.800> get<00:06:19.950> kind<00:06:20.100> of

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:20.250 
after 24 hours you just get kind of

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:22.520 
after 24 hours you just get kind of
frustrated<00:06:20.460> that<00:06:21.390> it's<00:06:21.780> only<00:06:21.990> Facebook

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:22.530 
frustrated that it's only Facebook

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:24.500 
frustrated that it's only Facebook
centric<00:06:22.950> you<00:06:23.100> have<00:06:23.310> to<00:06:23.460> really<00:06:23.850> really<00:06:24.150> love

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:24.510 
centric you have to really really love

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:27.350 
centric you have to really really love
Facebook<00:06:25.140> for<00:06:25.440> this<00:06:25.620> to<00:06:25.800> work<00:06:25.950> for<00:06:26.220> you<00:06:26.340> and<00:06:26.520> I

Facebook for this to work for you and I

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:29.540 
Facebook for this to work for you and I
think<00:06:27.660> some<00:06:27.840> people<00:06:27.870> will<00:06:28.350> like<00:06:28.590> it<00:06:28.620> because<00:06:29.010> I

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:29.550 
think some people will like it because I

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:32.120 
think some people will like it because I
found<00:06:30.270> myself<00:06:30.419> liking<00:06:30.960> a<00:06:31.320> lot<00:06:31.590> more<00:06:31.830> things

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:32.130 
found myself liking a lot more things

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:34.550 
found myself liking a lot more things
and<00:06:32.520> looking<00:06:32.910> at<00:06:33.090> my<00:06:33.240> feet<00:06:33.479> a<00:06:33.510> lot<00:06:33.750> more<00:06:34.020> but<00:06:34.500> I

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:34.560 
and looking at my feet a lot more but I

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:36.740 
and looking at my feet a lot more but I
think<00:06:34.830> if<00:06:35.010> you<00:06:35.220> need<00:06:35.610> to<00:06:35.760> get<00:06:35.910> to<00:06:36.060> places<00:06:36.510> and

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:36.750 
think if you need to get to places and

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:37.050 
think if you need to get to places and
if<00:06:36.810> you

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:37.060 
if you

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:38.700 
if you
you<00:06:37.120> need<00:06:37.480> to<00:06:37.660> get<00:06:37.780> stuff<00:06:37.990> done<00:06:38.050> on<00:06:38.260> your<00:06:38.470> phone
