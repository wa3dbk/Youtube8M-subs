hello everybody today I want to show you
the<00:00:03.149> most<00:00:03.270> powerful<00:00:03.629> form<00:00:04.080> in<00:00:04.200> Minecraft<00:00:04.680> in

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980 
the most powerful form in Minecraft in

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.309 
the most powerful form in Minecraft in
fact<00:00:05.730> this<00:00:06.029> form<00:00:06.299> you<00:00:06.450> could<00:00:06.600> replace<00:00:06.870> all

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
fact this form you could replace all

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:10.640 
fact this form you could replace all
your<00:00:07.350> other<00:00:07.620> forms<00:00:08.389> so<00:00:09.389> if<00:00:09.780> you<00:00:09.960> don't<00:00:10.440> know

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
your other forms so if you don't know

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.549 
your other forms so if you don't know
what<00:00:10.860> this<00:00:11.070> is<00:00:11.190> about<00:00:12.080> this<00:00:13.080> would<00:00:13.320> look<00:00:13.500> like

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
what this is about this would look like

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.760 
what this is about this would look like
not<00:00:14.340> much<00:00:14.549> to<00:00:14.790> you<00:00:14.910> so<00:00:15.389> if<00:00:15.540> I<00:00:15.660> have<00:00:15.809> to<00:00:16.320> just<00:00:16.560> to

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
not much to you so if I have to just to

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.010 
not much to you so if I have to just to
help<00:00:16.920> us<00:00:17.039> facing<00:00:17.490> it<00:00:17.580> to<00:00:17.970> each<00:00:18.060> other<00:00:18.300> that<00:00:18.900> are

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
help us facing it to each other that are

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.380 
help us facing it to each other that are
transporting<00:00:19.680> our<00:00:19.800> items<00:00:20.279> back<00:00:20.430> and<00:00:20.609> forth<00:00:20.850> in

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
transporting our items back and forth in

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.310 
transporting our items back and forth in
effect<00:00:21.779> it<00:00:22.529> would<00:00:22.800> even<00:00:23.580> do<00:00:23.730> much<00:00:23.939> now<00:00:24.320> because

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
effect it would even do much now because

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.929 
effect it would even do much now because
we<00:00:25.470> are<00:00:25.500> missing<00:00:25.859> one<00:00:26.039> very<00:00:26.369> important

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
we are missing one very important

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.410 
we are missing one very important
ingredient<00:00:27.240> which<00:00:28.199> is<00:00:28.230> lag<00:00:29.000> there's<00:00:30.000> a<00:00:30.090> bug<00:00:30.269> in

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
ingredient which is lag there's a bug in

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.479 
ingredient which is lag there's a bug in
a<00:00:30.539> game<00:00:30.720> for<00:00:30.990> a<00:00:31.019> very<00:00:31.230> long<00:00:31.500> time<00:00:31.529> now<00:00:31.949> in<00:00:32.189> fact

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
a game for a very long time now in fact

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.069 
a game for a very long time now in fact
ever<00:00:32.669> since<00:00:32.759> hoppers<00:00:33.300> we<00:00:33.420> introduced<00:00:33.780> the

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
ever since hoppers we introduced the

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.950 
ever since hoppers we introduced the
game<00:00:34.290> it<00:00:34.890> if<00:00:35.040> a<00:00:35.160> server<00:00:35.430> or<00:00:35.760> computers<00:00:36.719> and<00:00:36.899> a

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
game it if a server or computers and a

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.110 
game it if a server or computers and a
lot<00:00:37.140> of<00:00:37.260> stress<00:00:37.530> opens<00:00:38.309> with<00:00:38.430> duplicate<00:00:38.940> items

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
lot of stress opens with duplicate items

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.619 
lot of stress opens with duplicate items
I<00:00:40.370> guess<00:00:41.370> for<00:00:41.550> most<00:00:41.700> players<00:00:41.969> design<00:00:42.360> a<00:00:42.450> new

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
I guess for most players design a new

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.080 
I guess for most players design a new

than<00:00:47.250> a<00:00:47.340> year<00:00:47.610> and<00:00:48.079> if<00:00:49.079> you<00:00:49.140> play<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.440> game

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
than a year and if you play the game

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.380 
than a year and if you play the game
long<00:00:49.920> enough<00:00:49.950> you<00:00:50.370> might<00:00:50.520> have<00:00:50.700> experienced

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
long enough you might have experienced

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.270 
long enough you might have experienced
some<00:00:51.719> of<00:00:51.750> your<00:00:52.020> redstone<00:00:52.199> contraptions<00:00:53.070> that

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
some of your redstone contraptions that

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.639 
some of your redstone contraptions that
require<00:00:53.910> hoppers<00:00:54.329> were<00:00:54.960> broken<00:00:55.320> by

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
require hoppers were broken by

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.139 
require hoppers were broken by
duplication<00:00:56.809> so<00:00:57.809> I<00:00:58.230> just<00:00:58.800> wanted<00:00:59.219> to<00:00:59.670> show<00:00:59.879> how

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
duplication so I just wanted to show how

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.080 
duplication so I just wanted to show how
potentially<00:01:01.050> game-breaking<00:01:01.590> this<00:01:02.100> is<00:01:02.309> by

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
potentially game-breaking this is by

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.359 
potentially game-breaking this is by
automating<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:04.229> duplication<00:01:04.769> and<00:01:05.070> building

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
automating the duplication and building

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.830 
automating the duplication and building
a<00:01:05.460> large-scale<00:01:05.729> scalar<00:01:06.540> version<00:01:06.720> of<00:01:07.020> this<00:01:07.170> so

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
a large-scale scalar version of this so

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.929 
a large-scale scalar version of this so
the<00:01:09.840> automation<00:01:10.320> part<00:01:10.710> of<00:01:10.830> this<00:01:10.950> is<00:01:11.130> just<00:01:11.460> that

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
the automation part of this is just that

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.450 
the automation part of this is just that
if<00:01:12.540> your<00:01:12.810> item<00:01:13.140> would<00:01:13.290> duplicate<00:01:13.830> they<00:01:14.280> would

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
if your item would duplicate they would

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.929 
if your item would duplicate they would
get<00:01:14.670> transported<00:01:15.420> automatically<00:01:16.380> to<00:01:17.100> a<00:01:17.130> chest

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
get transported automatically to a chest

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.950 
get transported automatically to a chest
to<00:01:18.630> store<00:01:18.869> it<00:01:18.960> and<00:01:19.939> here<00:01:20.939> we<00:01:21.060> see<00:01:21.270> a<00:01:21.299> large

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
to store it and here we see a large

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.230 
to store it and here we see a large
scale<00:01:22.290> version<00:01:23.220> of<00:01:23.340> this<00:01:23.600> so<00:01:24.600> I<00:01:24.990> used<00:01:25.290> in<00:01:25.560> total

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 
scale version of this so I used in total

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.960 
scale version of this so I used in total
960<00:01:27.240> hoppers<00:01:27.590> to<00:01:28.590> increase<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.280> chances<00:01:29.700> of

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
960 hoppers to increase the chances of

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.640 
960 hoppers to increase the chances of
this<00:01:30.240> park<00:01:30.840> happening<00:01:31.259> and<00:01:32.630> to<00:01:33.630> create<00:01:34.140> the

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
this park happening and to create the

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.980 
this park happening and to create the
leg<00:01:34.829> I<00:01:35.479> choose<00:01:36.479> to<00:01:36.840> load<00:01:37.350> and<00:01:37.619> unload<00:01:38.990> certain

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
leg I choose to load and unload certain

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.140 
leg I choose to load and unload certain
trunks<00:01:40.350> which<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.310> hoppers<00:01:41.549> are<00:01:41.700> placed<00:01:41.909> in

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
trunks which the hoppers are placed in

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.710 
trunks which the hoppers are placed in
and<00:01:42.530> therefore<00:01:43.530> I<00:01:43.850> placed<00:01:44.850> a<00:01:45.060> minecart<00:01:45.450> rail

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
and therefore I placed a minecart rail

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:53.450 
and therefore I placed a minecart rail
here<00:01:46.579> so<00:01:47.579> if<00:01:47.820> you<00:01:47.939> leave<00:01:49.070> the<00:01:50.070> area<00:01:50.369> where<00:01:52.460> the

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
here so if you leave the area where the

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.609 
here so if you leave the area where the
hoppers<00:01:53.729> are<00:01:53.970> built<00:01:54.570> and<00:01:55.219> this<00:01:56.219> depends<00:01:56.850> on

00:01:57.609 --> 00:01:57.619 
hoppers are built and this depends on

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:00.880 
hoppers are built and this depends on
your<00:01:58.619> video<00:01:59.340> settings<00:01:59.759> the<00:01:59.969> render<00:02:00.210> distance

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
your video settings the render distance

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.859 
your video settings the render distance
so<00:02:01.890> you<00:02:01.920> can<00:02:02.070> just<00:02:02.460> fly<00:02:02.640> out<00:02:02.670> it<00:02:03.000> until<00:02:03.299> you<00:02:03.450> see

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
so you can just fly out it until you see

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.770 
so you can just fly out it until you see
it<00:02:03.960> no<00:02:04.079> longer<00:02:04.229> and<00:02:04.740> go<00:02:05.340> back<00:02:05.520> and<00:02:05.700> forth<00:02:05.969> to

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
it no longer and go back and forth to

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.919 
it no longer and go back and forth to
load<00:02:07.259> and<00:02:07.500> unload<00:02:07.619> those<00:02:08.220> chunks<00:02:08.640> so<00:02:08.819> this<00:02:09.720> way

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
load and unload those chunks so this way

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.770 
load and unload those chunks so this way
I<00:02:10.340> create<00:02:11.340> a<00:02:11.400> lot<00:02:11.610> of<00:02:11.670> stress<00:02:11.940> on<00:02:12.360> under

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
I create a lot of stress on under

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.839 
I create a lot of stress on under
computer

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:14.849 
computer

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:18.509 
computer
because<00:02:15.849> the<00:02:16.120> chunks<00:02:16.720> have<00:02:16.840> to<00:02:16.959> load<00:02:17.110> in<00:02:17.290> and<00:02:17.519> I

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:18.519 
because the chunks have to load in and I

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:20.520 
because the chunks have to load in and I
had<00:02:18.790> this<00:02:18.940> running<00:02:19.300> for<00:02:19.629> one<00:02:19.930> hour<00:02:20.080> to<00:02:20.200> set<00:02:20.500> up

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
had this running for one hour to set up

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:21.059 
had this running for one hour to set up
here

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:21.069 
here

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:24.830 
here
and<00:02:21.360> let's<00:02:22.360> see<00:02:22.510> how<00:02:22.750> much<00:02:23.200> duplication

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
and let's see how much duplication

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:33.390 
and let's see how much duplication
what's<00:02:25.840> going<00:02:26.170> on<00:02:30.390> so<00:02:31.390> here<00:02:31.660> we<00:02:31.780> are<00:02:31.810> and<00:02:32.400> I

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
what's going on so here we are and I

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.750 
what's going on so here we are and I
almost<00:02:33.700> got<00:02:34.620> twenty<00:02:35.620> six<00:02:36.040> stacks<00:02:36.340> of

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
almost got twenty six stacks of

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.880 
almost got twenty six stacks of
duplicated<00:02:37.420> sand<00:02:38.640> so<00:02:39.640> and<00:02:40.170> this<00:02:41.170> is<00:02:41.230> a<00:02:41.410> void

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
duplicated sand so and this is a void

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:47.280 
duplicated sand so and this is a void
world<00:02:43.590> so<00:02:44.590> we<00:02:44.739> have<00:02:45.180> yep<00:02:46.180> good<00:02:46.630> conditions<00:02:47.200> for

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
world so we have yep good conditions for

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.370 
world so we have yep good conditions for
less<00:02:47.920> lag<00:02:48.250> which<00:02:49.060> is<00:02:49.239> in<00:02:49.450> fact<00:02:49.660> a<00:02:49.989> beheading

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380 
less lag which is in fact a beheading

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.100 
less lag which is in fact a beheading
for<00:02:50.680> this<00:02:51.010> kind<00:02:52.000> of<00:02:52.060> contraption<00:02:52.450> the

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
for this kind of contraption the

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:56.550 
for this kind of contraption the
contraption<00:02:53.640> itself<00:02:54.640> creates<00:02:55.239> some<00:02:55.510> lag<00:02:55.720> but

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
contraption itself creates some lag but

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.430 
contraption itself creates some lag but
yeah<00:02:57.250> it's<00:02:57.400> highly<00:02:57.760> dependent<00:02:57.880> how<00:02:58.420> how<00:02:59.170> like

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
yeah it's highly dependent how how like

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.449 
yeah it's highly dependent how how like
3d<00:02:59.829> environment<00:03:00.819> is<00:03:00.970> I<00:03:01.410> built<00:03:02.410> a<00:03:02.829> version<00:03:03.250> of

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:03.459 
3d environment is I built a version of

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:06.330 
3d environment is I built a version of
twisters<00:03:03.910> that<00:03:04.329> wasn't<00:03:04.840> even<00:03:04.959> half<00:03:05.590> as<00:03:05.769> big<00:03:05.950> as

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
twisters that wasn't even half as big as

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:11.250 
twisters that wasn't even half as big as
this<00:03:06.610> on<00:03:06.849> a<00:03:07.890> multiplayer<00:03:08.890> server<00:03:09.040> and<00:03:10.260> on

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
this on a multiplayer server and on

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.680 
this on a multiplayer server and on
average<00:03:11.500> I<00:03:11.860> got<00:03:12.099> about<00:03:12.400> twenty<00:03:13.060> two<00:03:13.239> thousand

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
average I got about twenty two thousand

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:17.180 
average I got about twenty two thousand
eight<00:03:13.870> UM's<00:03:14.049> per<00:03:14.290> hour<00:03:14.459> with<00:03:15.510> office<00:03:16.510> much

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
eight UM's per hour with office much

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:23.580 
eight UM's per hour with office much
hopper<00:03:18.190> pairs<00:03:20.069> so<00:03:21.069> and<00:03:21.780> you<00:03:22.780> can<00:03:22.989> duplicate

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
hopper pairs so and you can duplicate

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.550 
hopper pairs so and you can duplicate
every<00:03:24.519> item<00:03:25.239> that<00:03:25.269> is<00:03:25.660> stackable<00:03:25.989> in<00:03:26.260> the<00:03:26.380> game

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
every item that is stackable in the game

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.949

of<00:03:26.769> this<00:03:26.950> contraption<00:03:27.400> here<00:03:27.850> so<00:03:28.209> instead<00:03:28.750> of

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:28.959 
of this contraption here so instead of

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:31.710 
of this contraption here so instead of
send<00:03:29.290> you<00:03:29.440> could<00:03:29.590> also<00:03:29.910> duplicate<00:03:30.910> I<00:03:31.239> don't

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
send you could also duplicate I don't

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:36.830 
send you could also duplicate I don't
know<00:03:31.780> not<00:03:32.739> apples<00:03:33.370> diamond<00:03:34.329> blocks<00:03:35.130> beacons

know not apples diamond blocks beacons

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.110 
know not apples diamond blocks beacons
anything<00:03:37.840> that<00:03:38.590> is<00:03:38.739> really<00:03:38.920> hard<00:03:39.220> to<00:03:39.340> get<00:03:39.519> even

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 
anything that is really hard to get even

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.870 
anything that is really hard to get even
dragon<00:03:40.540> eggs<00:03:41.010> really<00:03:42.010> everything<00:03:42.579> that<00:03:42.790> is

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:42.880 
dragon eggs really everything that is

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:47.520 
dragon eggs really everything that is
stackable<00:03:43.329> I<00:03:44.099> also<00:03:45.099> made<00:03:45.459> a<00:03:46.000> version<00:03:46.569> for<00:03:47.019> non

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530 
stackable I also made a version for non

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:50.940 
stackable I also made a version for non
stackable<00:03:48.010> items<00:03:48.370> which<00:03:49.329> is<00:03:49.359> over<00:03:49.750> here<00:03:49.989> so

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
stackable items which is over here so

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:55.349 
stackable items which is over here so
you<00:03:51.010> could<00:03:52.169> duplicate<00:03:53.169> your<00:03:53.500> best<00:03:54.359> tools

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:55.359 
you could duplicate your best tools

00:03:55.359 --> 00:03:58.830 
you could duplicate your best tools
weapons<00:03:56.290> armor<00:03:56.980> you<00:03:57.880> know<00:03:57.970> anything<00:03:58.450> that<00:03:58.690> is

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 
weapons armor you know anything that is

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.080 
weapons armor you know anything that is
non<00:03:59.470> stackable<00:03:59.980> with<00:04:00.190> this<00:04:00.340> contraption<00:04:00.730> here

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.090 
non stackable with this contraption here

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.409 
non stackable with this contraption here
we<00:04:01.209> just<00:04:01.419> need<00:04:01.599> the<00:04:02.730> signal<00:04:03.730> strength<00:04:04.000> of<00:04:04.180> six

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:04.419 
we just need the signal strength of six

00:04:04.419 --> 00:04:09.270 
we just need the signal strength of six
and<00:04:04.870> it's<00:04:05.709> the<00:04:05.950> same<00:04:06.690> principle

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 
and it's the same principle

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.540 
and it's the same principle
so<00:04:10.720> this<00:04:11.720> video<00:04:12.260> should<00:04:12.470> be<00:04:12.650> really<00:04:12.920> reminder

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:13.550 
so this video should be really reminder

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:18.490 
so this video should be really reminder
how<00:04:14.170> game-breaking<00:04:15.170> this<00:04:15.500> is<00:04:16.510> yeah<00:04:17.570> Mojang

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:18.500 
how game-breaking this is yeah Mojang

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.009 
how game-breaking this is yeah Mojang
should<00:04:19.250> really<00:04:19.489> try<00:04:20.090> to<00:04:20.180> fix<00:04:20.510> this<00:04:20.750> back

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:21.019 
should really try to fix this back

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:25.060 
should really try to fix this back
because<00:04:21.500> it<00:04:21.769> could<00:04:22.040> have<00:04:23.030> ruined<00:04:23.390> the<00:04:24.290> economy

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.070 
because it could have ruined the economy

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:29.860 
because it could have ruined the economy
of<00:04:25.430> a<00:04:25.520> server<00:04:26.020> totally<00:04:27.020> because<00:04:27.650> I<00:04:28.580> think<00:04:29.060> if<00:04:29.780> a

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:29.870 
of a server totally because I think if a

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:34.360 
of a server totally because I think if a
new<00:04:30.050> player<00:04:31.480> joins<00:04:32.480> so<00:04:32.930> ever<00:04:33.080> and<00:04:33.410> and<00:04:33.950> starts

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:34.370 
new player joins so ever and and starts

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:36.909 
new player joins so ever and and starts
focusing<00:04:35.090> on<00:04:35.540> this<00:04:35.720> stuff<00:04:35.960> you<00:04:36.140> can<00:04:36.350> have<00:04:36.560> I

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:36.919 
focusing on this stuff you can have I

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:39.490 
focusing on this stuff you can have I
don't<00:04:37.700> know<00:04:37.760> 10,000<00:04:38.480> diving<00:04:38.720> blocks<00:04:38.960> within

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:39.500 
don't know 10,000 diving blocks within

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:44.080 
don't know 10,000 diving blocks within
24<00:04:40.040> hours<00:04:40.100> if<00:04:40.490> you<00:04:40.580> really<00:04:40.970> wants<00:04:41.210> to<00:04:42.760> yeah<00:04:43.760> so

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:44.090 
24 hours if you really wants to yeah so

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:47.080 
24 hours if you really wants to yeah so
instead<00:04:44.510> of<00:04:44.570> trying<00:04:44.990> to<00:04:45.169> fix<00:04:45.520> iron<00:04:46.520> farms

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:47.090 
instead of trying to fix iron farms

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:50.050 
instead of trying to fix iron farms
there<00:04:47.590> are<00:04:48.590> 10<00:04:48.770> in<00:04:48.890> itself<00:04:49.160> mulching<00:04:49.820> should

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:50.060 
there are 10 in itself mulching should

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:53.110 
there are 10 in itself mulching should
really<00:04:50.390> try<00:04:50.750> focusing<00:04:51.110> on<00:04:51.500> fixing<00:04:52.190> box<00:04:52.880> like

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:53.120 
really try focusing on fixing box like

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:57.460 
really try focusing on fixing box like
that<00:04:53.150> did<00:04:53.750> a<00:04:53.780> way<00:04:54.470> more<00:04:54.770> game<00:04:55.520> breaking<00:04:56.470> okay

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:57.470 
that did a way more game breaking okay

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:59.409 
that did a way more game breaking okay
that's<00:04:57.830> all<00:04:58.280> I<00:04:58.340> had<00:04:58.580> to<00:04:58.730> say<00:04:58.760> for<00:04:58.970> the<00:04:59.270> day

00:04:59.409 --> 00:04:59.419
