00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
that's always evolving and you always

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:28.880 
that's always evolving and you always
want<00:01:27.659> like<00:01:27.930> a<00:01:27.960> different<00:01:28.320> pair<00:01:28.439> or<00:01:28.530> a<00:01:28.590> new<00:01:28.710> pair

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
want like a different pair or a new pair

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.679 
want like a different pair or a new pair
so<00:01:29.100> it's<00:01:29.250> not<00:01:29.340> like<00:01:29.520> a<00:01:29.549> humongous<00:01:30.360> deal<00:01:30.540> to

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
so it's not like a humongous deal to

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.719 
so it's not like a humongous deal to
have<00:01:30.810> designer<00:01:31.140> other<00:01:31.710> than<00:01:31.950> that<00:01:32.100> the

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
have designer other than that the

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.760 
have designer other than that the
glasses<00:01:32.939> that<00:01:33.240> I<00:01:33.270> used<00:01:33.630> to<00:01:33.810> have<00:01:33.990> well<00:01:34.500> that<00:01:34.740> I

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
glasses that I used to have well that I

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.980 
glasses that I used to have well that I
have<00:01:35.040> right<00:01:35.220> now<00:01:35.250> that<00:01:35.549> I<00:01:35.880> have<00:01:36.329> for<00:01:36.659> probably

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
have right now that I have for probably

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.630 
have right now that I have for probably
every<00:01:37.170> time<00:01:37.290> I<00:01:37.350> get<00:01:37.500> a<00:01:37.530> new<00:01:37.590> exact<00:01:38.040> exam<00:01:38.400> I<00:01:38.460> just

every time I get a new exact exam I just

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:39.980 
every time I get a new exact exam I just
change<00:01:38.820> two<00:01:38.939> lenses<00:01:39.270> so<00:01:39.420> I<00:01:39.479> probably<00:01:39.630> haven't

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
change two lenses so I probably haven't

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.569 
change two lenses so I probably haven't
for<00:01:40.079> like<00:01:40.170> three<00:01:40.409> years<00:01:40.439> now<00:01:40.680> and<00:01:40.860> I<00:01:41.100> like<00:01:41.340> them

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.240 
for like three years now and I like them
and<00:01:41.759> they<00:01:41.850> are<00:01:41.880> designer<00:01:42.420> but<00:01:42.689> I<00:01:43.070> never<00:01:44.070> wear

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250

it's just so brilliant I don't know why

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:40.210 
it's just so brilliant I don't know why
I<00:03:38.840> don't<00:03:39.019> think<00:03:39.260> of<00:03:39.349> that<00:03:39.470> it's<00:03:39.919> just<00:03:40.099> a<00:03:40.159> really

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220

cool<00:03:40.609> whole<00:03:41.239> idea<00:03:41.599> and<00:03:41.810> I<00:03:41.870> definitely<00:03:42.019> am

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:42.290 
cool whole idea and I definitely am

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:43.509

00:03:45.889 --> 00:03:49.719 
should I get the tortoiseshell ones I
just<00:03:45.949> think<00:03:46.489> that<00:03:46.579> you<00:03:46.669> have<00:03:46.760> to<00:03:47.019> kind<00:03:48.019> of<00:03:48.729> with

00:03:49.719 --> 00:03:49.729 
just think that you have to kind of with

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:51.280 
just think that you have to kind of with
your<00:03:49.909> outfits<00:03:50.569> you<00:03:50.750> have<00:03:50.840> to<00:03:50.959> kind<00:03:51.169> of

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:51.290 
your outfits you have to kind of

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:53.050 
your outfits you have to kind of
coordinate<00:03:51.709> them<00:03:51.919> with<00:03:52.159> your<00:03:52.549> glasses<00:03:52.849> I

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:53.060 
coordinate them with your glasses I

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:54.069 
coordinate them with your glasses I
don't<00:03:53.090> think<00:03:53.359> everything<00:03:53.569> goes<00:03:53.810> with<00:03:53.959> them

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:54.079 
don't think everything goes with them

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:55.679 
don't think everything goes with them
maybe<00:03:54.260> just<00:03:54.500> because<00:03:54.709> I<00:03:54.769> never<00:03:54.829> wear<00:03:55.129> glasses

00:03:55.679 --> 00:03:55.689 
maybe just because I never wear glasses

00:03:55.689 --> 00:03:57.879 
maybe just because I never wear glasses
so<00:03:56.689> I<00:03:56.750> just<00:03:56.930> feel<00:03:57.109> like<00:03:57.290> weird<00:03:57.560> I<00:03:57.650> don't<00:03:57.709> know

00:03:57.879 --> 00:03:57.889 
so I just feel like weird I don't know

00:03:57.889 --> 00:03:59.710 
so I just feel like weird I don't know
what<00:03:58.040> would<00:03:58.250> go<00:03:58.280> good<00:03:58.579> with<00:03:58.639> them<00:03:58.909> but<00:03:59.090> I<00:03:59.299> think

00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.720 
what would go good with them but I think

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:00.969 
what would go good with them but I think
that<00:03:59.989> they're<00:04:00.109> really<00:04:00.199> nice<00:04:00.439> really<00:04:00.709> trendy

00:04:00.969 --> 00:04:00.979 
that they're really nice really trendy

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:02.199 
that they're really nice really trendy
and<00:04:01.099> it's<00:04:01.189> kinda<00:04:01.430> gives<00:04:01.579> my<00:04:01.699> eyes<00:04:01.849> a<00:04:01.879> break

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:02.209 
and it's kinda gives my eyes a break

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:04.000 
and it's kinda gives my eyes a break
from<00:04:02.510> always<00:04:02.750> wearing<00:04:03.049> those<00:04:03.229> contacts<00:04:03.769> so<00:04:03.889> if

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010 
from always wearing those contacts so if

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:05.649 
from always wearing those contacts so if
you<00:04:04.129> are<00:04:04.310> definitely<00:04:04.699> in<00:04:04.970> need<00:04:05.060> of<00:04:05.449> new

00:04:05.649 --> 00:04:05.659 
you are definitely in need of new

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:08.439 
you are definitely in need of new
glasses<00:04:06.340> try<00:04:07.340> these<00:04:07.400> out<00:04:07.849> because<00:04:08.180> they<00:04:08.419> are

00:04:08.439 --> 00:04:08.449 
glasses try these out because they are

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:10.059 
glasses try these out because they are
so<00:04:08.599> affordable<00:04:09.109> and<00:04:09.409> I<00:04:09.439> think<00:04:09.680> that<00:04:09.829> it's<00:04:10.009> just

00:04:10.059 --> 00:04:10.069 
so affordable and I think that it's just

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:11.710 
so affordable and I think that it's just
the<00:04:10.189> quality<00:04:10.519> is<00:04:10.849> just<00:04:11.030> amazing<00:04:11.509> for<00:04:11.540> the

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:11.720 
the quality is just amazing for the

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:13.509 
the quality is just amazing for the
price<00:04:11.750> you<00:04:12.139> really<00:04:12.290> can't<00:04:12.530> beat<00:04:12.680> them<00:04:12.829> so<00:04:13.280> I

00:04:13.509 --> 00:04:13.519 
price you really can't beat them so I

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:15.159 
price you really can't beat them so I
will<00:04:13.849> never<00:04:14.090> probably<00:04:14.329> get<00:04:14.659> the<00:04:14.870> something

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:15.169 
will never probably get the something

00:04:15.169 --> 00:04:17.740 
will never probably get the something
store<00:04:16.039> anymore<00:04:16.280> unless<00:04:16.579> I<00:04:16.970> don't<00:04:17.690> know

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750 
store anymore unless I don't know

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:19.779 
store anymore unless I don't know
because<00:04:18.259> I<00:04:18.349> just<00:04:18.500> there<00:04:18.949> to<00:04:19.099> me<00:04:19.220> I'm<00:04:19.370> not<00:04:19.639> gonna

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:19.789 
because I just there to me I'm not gonna

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:21.129 
because I just there to me I'm not gonna
wear<00:04:20.000> them<00:04:20.090> every<00:04:20.299> day<00:04:20.329> so<00:04:20.479> I<00:04:20.690> just<00:04:20.720> feel<00:04:21.019> like

00:04:21.129 --> 00:04:21.139 
wear them every day so I just feel like

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:23.170 
wear them every day so I just feel like
spending<00:04:21.859> all<00:04:22.099> that<00:04:22.159> money<00:04:22.340> on<00:04:22.669> them<00:04:22.849> is<00:04:23.000> just

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:23.180 
spending all that money on them is just

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:25.269 
spending all that money on them is just
kind<00:04:23.360> of<00:04:23.450> silly<00:04:23.719> so<00:04:24.110> I<00:04:24.320> really<00:04:24.830> love<00:04:24.979> them<00:04:25.159> and

00:04:25.269 --> 00:04:25.279 
kind of silly so I really love them and

00:04:25.279 --> 00:04:26.440 
kind of silly so I really love them and
I<00:04:25.310> think<00:04:25.370> the<00:04:25.580> quality<00:04:25.909> is<00:04:25.940> great

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:26.450 
I think the quality is great

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:27.700 
I think the quality is great
than<00:04:26.600> that<00:04:26.720> I<00:04:26.780> think<00:04:26.900> that's<00:04:27.110> it<00:04:27.380> I<00:04:27.530> don't

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:27.710 
than that I think that's it I don't

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:29.710 
than that I think that's it I don't
really<00:04:27.800> know<00:04:27.980> what<00:04:28.190> how<00:04:28.340> to<00:04:28.370> review<00:04:28.790> glasses<00:04:29.300> I

nose and the cool thing is you can add
on<00:04:35.180> extras<00:04:35.960> if<00:04:36.080> you<00:04:36.140> want<00:04:36.320> to<00:04:36.380> have<00:04:36.500> like<00:04:36.620> a
