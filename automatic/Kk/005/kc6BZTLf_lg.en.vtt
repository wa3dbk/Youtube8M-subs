get<00:02:13.819> right<00:02:14.210> into<00:02:14.450> this<00:02:14.630> one<00:02:14.840> and<00:02:14.900> see<00:02:15.230> what

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
get right into this one and see what

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.430 
get right into this one and see what
what<00:02:15.860> this<00:02:16.040> bag<00:02:16.340> has<00:02:16.580> to<00:02:16.790> offer<00:02:16.940> bag<00:02:17.840> or<00:02:18.110> a<00:02:18.140> slip

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
what this bag has to offer bag or a slip

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:19.570 
what this bag has to offer bag or a slip
case<00:02:18.680> I<00:02:18.860> would<00:02:19.010> say

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
case I would say

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.570 
case I would say
so<00:02:20.000> let's<00:02:20.210> keep<00:02:20.420> this<00:02:20.600> aside<00:02:20.750> and<00:02:21.490> there<00:02:22.490> you

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
so let's keep this aside and there you

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.750 
so let's keep this aside and there you
go<00:02:22.730> this<00:02:23.030> is<00:02:23.090> the<00:02:23.300> bag<00:02:23.560> okay<00:02:24.560> so<00:02:25.160> let's<00:02:25.370> open<00:02:25.550> it

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
the way as I'm not sure if we can make

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.520 
the way as I'm not sure if we can make
out<00:02:30.530> the<00:02:30.710> thickness<00:02:30.920> but<00:02:31.580> it's<00:02:31.760> very<00:02:32.500> you<00:02:33.500> know

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
out the thickness but it's very you know

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.270 
out the thickness but it's very you know
it's<00:02:34.220> a<00:02:34.340> very<00:02:34.550> mushy<00:02:34.880> sort<00:02:35.390> of<00:02:35.510> material<00:02:36.280> it's

believe is they're talking about the

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:36.230 
believe is they're talking about the
material<00:06:34.290> which<00:06:34.440> is<00:06:34.590> you<00:06:35.160> know<00:06:35.310> it's<00:06:35.850> having
