00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:04.849 

in<00:00:03.690> this<00:00:03.870> tutorial<00:00:04.080> we're<00:00:04.529> going<00:00:04.560> to<00:00:04.710> go<00:00:04.830> over

00:00:04.849 --> 00:00:04.859 
in this tutorial we're going to go over

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:06.650 
in this tutorial we're going to go over
the<00:00:05.190> shuttle<00:00:05.550> controls<00:00:05.910> and<00:00:06.120> timeline<00:00:06.510> which

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
the shuttle controls and timeline which

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:07.730 
the shuttle controls and timeline which
basically<00:00:06.930> live<00:00:07.170> at<00:00:07.290> the<00:00:07.349> bottom<00:00:07.470> of<00:00:07.649> the

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
basically live at the bottom of the

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.520 
basically live at the bottom of the
viewer<00:00:07.979> here<00:00:08.269> first<00:00:09.269> up<00:00:09.510> we<00:00:09.660> have<00:00:09.690> current

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
viewer here first up we have current

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.650 
viewer here first up we have current
frame<00:00:10.799> so<00:00:11.099> if<00:00:11.190> we<00:00:11.309> move<00:00:11.460> the<00:00:11.639> playhead<00:00:11.849> we<00:00:12.509> can

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
frame so if we move the playhead we can

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.350 
frame so if we move the playhead we can
see<00:00:12.809> that<00:00:12.959> this<00:00:13.730> updates<00:00:14.730> to<00:00:15.030> whatever<00:00:15.299> the

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
see that this updates to whatever the

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.510 
see that this updates to whatever the
current<00:00:15.599> frame<00:00:15.959> is<00:00:16.170> we<00:00:16.650> can<00:00:16.770> also<00:00:16.890> use<00:00:17.160> this<00:00:17.340> as

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
current frame is we can also use this as

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.359 
current frame is we can also use this as
an<00:00:17.580> input<00:00:17.850> field<00:00:18.090> so<00:00:18.300> i<00:00:18.330> could<00:00:18.510> type<00:00:18.689> 45<00:00:19.470> enter

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
an input field so i could type 45 enter

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.029 
an input field so i could type 45 enter
and<00:00:20.609> we<00:00:20.849> go<00:00:21.000> back<00:00:21.210> to<00:00:21.240> frame<00:00:21.570> 45<00:00:22.080> this<00:00:22.740> padlock

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
and we go back to frame 45 this padlock

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.660 
and we go back to frame 45 this padlock
locks<00:00:23.460> the<00:00:24.300> viewer<00:00:25.259> to<00:00:25.529> the<00:00:25.920> scripts<00:00:26.340> current

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
locks the viewer to the scripts current

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.880 
locks the viewer to the scripts current
frame<00:00:26.970> that<00:00:27.689> is<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:27.960> frame<00:00:28.230> that<00:00:28.619> will<00:00:28.710> get

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
frame that is the frame that will get

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.859 
frame that is the frame that will get
returned<00:00:29.250> with<00:00:29.429> expressions<00:00:30.029> or<00:00:30.269> script<00:00:30.660> code

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
returned with expressions or script code

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.920 
returned with expressions or script code
so<00:00:31.619> if<00:00:31.800> I<00:00:31.919> double<00:00:32.369> click<00:00:32.400> this<00:00:32.640> blur<00:00:32.940> and<00:00:33.210> put

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
so if I double click this blur and put

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.500 
so if I double click this blur and put
an<00:00:34.080> expression<00:00:34.740> in<00:00:34.950> this<00:00:35.430> size<00:00:35.700> knob<00:00:36.030> so<00:00:36.270> go

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
an expression in this size knob so go

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.810 
an expression in this size knob so go
out<00:00:36.750> of<00:00:36.870> expression<00:00:37.350> and<00:00:37.500> type<00:00:38.190> frame<00:00:40.640> we<00:00:41.640> can

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
out of expression and type frame we can

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.990 
out of expression and type frame we can
see<00:00:42.090> that<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.510> playhead<00:00:42.990> and<00:00:43.430> this<00:00:44.430> size<00:00:44.700> knob

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
see that the playhead and this size knob

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.370 
see that the playhead and this size knob
are<00:00:45.240> in<00:00:45.420> sync<00:00:46.640> but<00:00:47.640> if<00:00:47.730> i<00:00:47.910> uncheck<00:00:48.150> this<00:00:48.750> pedal

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:49.380 
are in sync but if i uncheck this pedal

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:51.860 
are in sync but if i uncheck this pedal
now<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.220> viewer<00:00:50.610> is<00:00:50.880> free<00:00:51.180> to<00:00:51.330> go<00:00:51.360> off<00:00:51.540> on<00:00:51.600> its

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
now the viewer is free to go off on its

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.500 
now the viewer is free to go off on its
own<00:00:52.020> while<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:53.040> script<00:00:53.370> stays<00:00:53.700> at<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.270> last

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
own while the script stays at the last

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.480 
own while the script stays at the last
value<00:00:56.060> here<00:00:57.060> 9<00:00:57.480> so<00:00:58.410> now<00:00:58.590> I<00:00:58.620> move<00:00:58.830> it<00:00:58.980> it's<00:00:59.250> in

00:00:59.480 --> 00:00:59.490 
value here 9 so now I move it it's in

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:03.620 
value here 9 so now I move it it's in
sync<00:00:59.820> I<00:01:00.120> uncheck<00:01:00.990> it<00:01:01.230> it's<00:01:01.800> not<00:01:02.150> so<00:01:03.150> scrubbing

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:03.630 
sync I uncheck it it's not so scrubbing

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:04.910 
sync I uncheck it it's not so scrubbing
through<00:01:03.810> an<00:01:03.960> unlocked<00:01:04.140> viewer<00:01:04.559> will<00:01:04.799> not

2<00:01:16.710> viewers<00:01:16.890> in<00:01:17.130> no<00:01:17.369> graph<00:01:17.840> at<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:18.990> moment<00:01:19.350> it's

00:01:19.639 --> 00:01:19.649 
2 viewers in no graph at the moment it's

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:24.529 
2 viewers in no graph at the moment it's
at<00:01:20.549> seven<00:01:21.060> but<00:01:21.390> if<00:01:21.509> I<00:01:21.659> move<00:01:21.869> this<00:01:22.079> to<00:01:22.609> 30<00:01:23.609> this

00:01:24.529 --> 00:01:24.539 
at seven but if I move this to 30 this

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:26.330 
at seven but if I move this to 30 this
stays<00:01:24.840> at<00:01:25.020> seven<00:01:25.380> or<00:01:25.590> I<00:01:25.740> can<00:01:26.039> move<00:01:26.159> it<00:01:26.310> to

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
stays at seven or I can move it to

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.550 
stays at seven or I can move it to
whatever<00:01:26.850> value<00:01:27.329> or<00:01:27.450> frame<00:01:27.689> I<00:01:27.719> want<00:01:28.049> but<00:01:28.499> as

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
whatever value or frame I want but as

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:29.899 
whatever value or frame I want but as
soon<00:01:28.679> as<00:01:28.799> I<00:01:28.859> lock<00:01:29.039> it<00:01:29.249> it's<00:01:29.549> going<00:01:29.670> to<00:01:29.729> go<00:01:29.850> to

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
soon as I lock it it's going to go to

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.359 
soon as I lock it it's going to go to
third<00:01:30.030> back<00:01:30.689> to<00:01:30.869> my<00:01:30.960> default<00:01:31.350> layout<00:01:31.590> ship<00:01:32.189> DEP

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
third back to my default layout ship DEP

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.749 
third back to my default layout ship DEP
one<00:01:33.560> now<00:01:34.560> we're<00:01:34.710> onto<00:01:34.799> the<00:01:35.039> shuttle<00:01:35.219> control

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
one now we're onto the shuttle control

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.399 
one now we're onto the shuttle control
so<00:01:36.030> this<00:01:36.240> is<00:01:36.390> going<00:01:36.569> to<00:01:36.630> step<00:01:36.810> forward<00:01:37.079> 10

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
so this is going to step forward 10

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.520 
so this is going to step forward 10
frames<00:01:37.710> or<00:01:38.100> back<00:01:39.060> 10<00:01:39.359> frames<00:01:39.659> or<00:01:40.020> whatever

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
frames or back 10 frames or whatever

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.859 
frames or back 10 frames or whatever
value<00:01:40.920> I<00:01:40.950> enter<00:01:41.729> in<00:01:41.850> that<00:01:42.030> box<00:01:42.299> and<00:01:42.539> now<00:01:42.719> we're

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
value I enter in that box and now we're

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.770 
value I enter in that box and now we're
step<00:01:43.049> forward<00:01:43.319> 5<00:01:43.789> so<00:01:44.789> let's<00:01:45.060> a<00:01:45.270> view<00:01:45.659> this

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
step forward 5 so let's a view this

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.139 
step forward 5 so let's a view this
Bezier<00:01:46.200> here<00:01:46.469> and<00:01:46.740> let's<00:01:46.859> double-click<00:01:47.130> it<00:01:47.369> so

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
Bezier here and let's double-click it so

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.899 
Bezier here and let's double-click it so
first<00:01:48.960> frame<00:01:49.259> which<00:01:49.619> is<00:01:49.829> also<00:01:50.249> home<00:01:50.549> with<00:01:50.880> a

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
first frame which is also home with a

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.179 
first frame which is also home with a
hotkey<00:01:51.270> last<00:01:51.869> frame<00:01:52.170> end<00:01:52.469> if<00:01:52.889> you<00:01:52.979> want<00:01:53.130> to

hotkey last frame end if you want to

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:54.649 
hotkey last frame end if you want to
know<00:01:53.249> what<00:01:53.399> the<00:01:53.490> hotkeys<00:01:53.850> are<00:01:54.030> just<00:01:54.299> hover

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
know what the hotkeys are just hover

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.340 
know what the hotkeys are just hover
over<00:01:54.990> and<00:01:55.170> apple<00:01:56.130> com<00:01:56.280> tooltips<00:01:56.969> so<00:01:57.749> next<00:01:58.109> one

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
over and apple com tooltips so next one

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.129 
over and apple com tooltips so next one
is<00:01:58.999> previous<00:01:59.999> keyframe<00:02:00.389> so<00:02:00.749> that's<00:02:00.929> going<00:02:01.020> to

00:02:01.129 --> 00:02:01.139 
is previous keyframe so that's going to

00:02:01.139 --> 00:02:03.679 
is previous keyframe so that's going to
give<00:02:01.229> us<00:02:01.259> frame<00:02:02.130> 20<00:02:02.609> at<00:02:02.700> this<00:02:02.819> point<00:02:03.090> we<00:02:03.539> can

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
give us frame 20 at this point we can

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.330 
give us frame 20 at this point we can
see<00:02:03.810> we've<00:02:03.929> also<00:02:04.020> got<00:02:04.259> a<00:02:04.289> keyframe<00:02:04.619> on<00:02:04.829> frame<00:02:05.069> 1

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
see we've also got a keyframe on frame 1

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.669 
see we've also got a keyframe on frame 1
if<00:02:06.299> we<00:02:06.450> hold<00:02:06.600> down<00:02:06.780> the<00:02:06.899> command<00:02:07.079> key<00:02:07.380> it<00:02:07.649> will

00:02:07.669 --> 00:02:07.679 
if we hold down the command key it will

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:08.990 
if we hold down the command key it will
split<00:02:07.920> the<00:02:08.069> difference<00:02:08.250> and<00:02:08.520> give<00:02:08.670> us<00:02:08.759> frame

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
split the difference and give us frame

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.609 
split the difference and give us frame
10<00:02:09.300> and<00:02:09.539> we<00:02:09.600> can<00:02:09.750> see<00:02:09.899> in<00:02:09.990> this<00:02:10.110> case<00:02:10.350> that'll

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
10 and we can see in this case that'll

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.650 
10 and we can see in this case that'll
be<00:02:10.680> quite<00:02:10.860> good<00:02:11.220> as<00:02:11.430> my<00:02:11.850> rotor<00:02:12.060> drifts<00:02:12.540> off

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
be quite good as my rotor drifts off

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.340 
be quite good as my rotor drifts off
that<00:02:12.870> frame

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
that frame

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.080 
that frame
if<00:02:13.980> we<00:02:14.130> want<00:02:14.310> to<00:02:14.370> do<00:02:14.520> that<00:02:14.640> with<00:02:14.820> solely

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
if we want to do that with solely

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.690 
if we want to do that with solely
hotkeys<00:02:15.630> it<00:02:15.900> would<00:02:16.020> be<00:02:16.170> alt<00:02:16.470> command<00:02:17.460> left

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
hotkeys it would be alt command left

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.820 
hotkeys it would be alt command left
arrow<00:02:17.940> for<00:02:18.270> previous<00:02:18.720> and<00:02:19.020> up<00:02:19.170> command<00:02:19.620> right

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
arrow for previous and up command right

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.900 
arrow for previous and up command right
arrow<00:02:20.070> for<00:02:20.430> next<00:02:20.760> so<00:02:21.060> then<00:02:21.630> we<00:02:21.960> have<00:02:22.910> played

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
arrow for next so then we have played

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:29.780 
arrow for next so then we have played
backwards<00:02:24.650> hotkey<00:02:25.650> is<00:02:26.300> Jay<00:02:27.300> stop<00:02:28.080> is<00:02:28.560> K<00:02:29.010> play

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
backwards hotkey is Jay stop is K play

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.250 
backwards hotkey is Jay stop is K play
forward<00:02:30.240> is<00:02:30.420> l<00:02:32.000> then<00:02:33.000> preview<00:02:33.690> your<00:02:33.870> next

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
forward is l then preview your next

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.880 
forward is l then preview your next
frame<00:02:35.070> is<00:02:35.310> a<00:02:35.340> right<00:02:36.180> arrow<00:02:36.420> or<00:02:36.750> so<00:02:37.650> that<00:02:37.800> would

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
frame is a right arrow or so that would

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.430 
frame is a right arrow or so that would
go<00:02:38.010> one<00:02:38.370> frame<00:02:38.640> at<00:02:38.670> a<00:02:38.790> time<00:02:38.820> and<00:02:39.270> then<00:02:39.360> back<00:02:40.200> one

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
go one frame at a time and then back one

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.190 
go one frame at a time and then back one
frame<00:02:40.770> which<00:02:41.010> is<00:02:41.250> the<00:02:41.490> left<00:02:41.700> arrow<00:02:42.050> next<00:02:43.050> we

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
frame which is the left arrow next we

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.200 
frame which is the left arrow next we
come<00:02:43.380> to<00:02:43.440> the<00:02:43.710> frames<00:02:44.100> per<00:02:44.340> second<00:02:44.760> so<00:02:44.970> if<00:02:45.090> we

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:45.210 
come to the frames per second so if we

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:47.720 
come to the frames per second so if we
just<00:02:45.390> zoom<00:02:45.660> in<00:02:45.840> here<00:02:46.100> so<00:02:47.100> you<00:02:47.190> can<00:02:47.400> see<00:02:47.430> that

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
just zoom in here so you can see that

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.820 
just zoom in here so you can see that
this<00:02:47.880> is<00:02:48.150> what<00:02:48.540> nukes<00:02:48.870> going<00:02:49.050> to<00:02:49.110> try<00:02:49.470> and<00:02:49.500> play

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
this is what nukes going to try and play

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.510 
this is what nukes going to try and play
back<00:02:50.010> at<00:02:50.220> 24<00:02:50.730> frames<00:02:50.760> a<00:02:51.120> second<00:02:51.540> so<00:02:51.780> if<00:02:51.990> I<00:02:52.140> click

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:52.520 
back at 24 frames a second so if I click

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.430 
back at 24 frames a second so if I click
we<00:02:53.520> can<00:02:53.700> see<00:02:53.970> that<00:02:54.300> it's<00:02:54.510> actually<00:02:54.690> achieving

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
we can see that it's actually achieving

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.290 
we can see that it's actually achieving
10<00:02:55.800> at<00:02:55.950> the<00:02:56.040> moment<00:02:56.370> but<00:02:56.550> once<00:02:56.730> it's<00:02:56.910> cash<00:02:57.150> to

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
10 at the moment but once it's cash to

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.390 
10 at the moment but once it's cash to
get<00:02:57.510> a<00:02:57.570> bit<00:02:57.690> higher<00:02:57.900> so<00:02:58.170> this<00:02:58.590> is<00:02:58.710> giving<00:02:59.190> you

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
get a bit higher so this is giving you

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.040 
get a bit higher so this is giving you
what<00:02:59.730> it's<00:02:59.850> going<00:03:00.000> to<00:03:00.060> attempt<00:03:00.480> to<00:03:00.540> play<00:03:00.810> back

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
what it's going to attempt to play back

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:04.280 
what it's going to attempt to play back
and<00:03:01.260> what<00:03:01.500> it<00:03:01.620> is<00:03:01.830> playing<00:03:02.160> back<00:03:02.340> at<00:03:03.050> all<00:03:04.050> so

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
and what it is playing back at all so

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.700 
and what it is playing back at all so
here<00:03:04.500> we<00:03:04.650> have<00:03:04.680> end<00:03:05.220> of<00:03:05.610> frame<00:03:06.030> behavior<00:03:06.570> so<00:03:06.870> we

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:07.710 
here we have end of frame behavior so we

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:09.260 
here we have end of frame behavior so we
saw<00:03:07.890> we<00:03:08.010> had<00:03:08.040> loop<00:03:08.460> at<00:03:08.670> the<00:03:08.730> beginning<00:03:09.120> that

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:09.270 
saw we had loop at the beginning that

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:12.590 
saw we had loop at the beginning that
was<00:03:09.600> stopped<00:03:09.960> next<00:03:10.470> is<00:03:10.620> bounce<00:03:10.940> so<00:03:11.940> we<00:03:12.300> can<00:03:12.420> see

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
was stopped next is bounce so we can see

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:17.450 
was stopped next is bounce so we can see
now<00:03:12.780> that<00:03:12.810> that<00:03:13.080> will<00:03:13.230> bounce<00:03:13.440> back<00:03:14.270> okay<00:03:16.460> now

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:17.460 
now that that will bounce back okay now

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:19.850 
now that that will bounce back okay now
we<00:03:17.520> come<00:03:17.850> to<00:03:17.880> the<00:03:18.090> in-and-out<00:03:18.420> control<00:03:19.020> so<00:03:19.290> we

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
we come to the in-and-out control so we

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:22.520 
we come to the in-and-out control so we
see<00:03:20.010> I've<00:03:20.130> gotta<00:03:20.310> play<00:03:20.550> head<00:03:20.820> here<00:03:21.150> if<00:03:22.110> I<00:03:22.320> want

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
see I've gotta play head here if I want

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.440 
see I've gotta play head here if I want
to<00:03:22.650> set<00:03:22.890> my<00:03:23.010> in<00:03:23.190> point<00:03:23.460> what<00:03:23.670> I<00:03:23.700> do<00:03:23.820> is<00:03:24.120> I<00:03:24.240> hold

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
to set my in point what I do is I hold

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.080 
to set my in point what I do is I hold
down<00:03:24.660> the<00:03:24.870> command<00:03:25.110> key<00:03:25.350> and<00:03:25.710> while<00:03:26.520> I'm<00:03:26.700> left

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
down the command key and while I'm left

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.690 
down the command key and while I'm left
of<00:03:27.330> the<00:03:27.480> playhead<00:03:27.870> anywhere<00:03:28.680> i<00:03:28.710> drag<00:03:29.070> will<00:03:29.400> set

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
of the playhead anywhere i drag will set

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.790 
of the playhead anywhere i drag will set
that<00:03:29.850> in<00:03:30.000> point<00:03:30.300> now<00:03:30.840> i<00:03:30.870> want<00:03:31.080> to<00:03:31.110> set<00:03:31.320> my<00:03:31.500> out

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:31.800 
that in point now i want to set my out

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.830 
that in point now i want to set my out
point<00:03:32.160> i<00:03:32.250> have<00:03:32.370> to<00:03:32.520> be<00:03:32.640> to<00:03:32.760> the<00:03:32.880> right<00:03:33.120> of<00:03:33.390> this

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
point i have to be to the right of this

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.800 
point i have to be to the right of this
playhead<00:03:34.740> if<00:03:34.950> I'm<00:03:35.160> here<00:03:35.550> and<00:03:35.700> I<00:03:36.120> kick<00:03:36.570> the

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
playhead if I'm here and I kick the

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.600 
playhead if I'm here and I kick the
command<00:03:37.410> key<00:03:37.590> it's<00:03:37.740> going<00:03:37.890> to<00:03:37.980> still<00:03:38.220> set<00:03:38.460> my

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610 
command key it's going to still set my

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:40.730 
command key it's going to still set my
in<00:03:38.760> point<00:03:39.030> so<00:03:39.450> I<00:03:39.510> have<00:03:39.660> to<00:03:39.780> be<00:03:39.900> that<00:03:40.110> side<00:03:40.380> of

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:40.740 
in point so I have to be that side of

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:43.130 
in point so I have to be that side of
the<00:03:40.860> playhead<00:03:41.370> set<00:03:41.730> my<00:03:41.880> out<00:03:42.030> point<00:03:42.300> and<00:03:42.930> now<00:03:43.080> we

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
the playhead set my out point and now we

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.800 
the playhead set my out point and now we
can<00:03:43.380> see<00:03:43.530> that<00:03:43.680> I've<00:03:43.800> got<00:03:44.040> 10<00:03:44.730> to<00:03:44.940> 35<00:03:45.240> I<00:03:45.420> could

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
can see that I've got 10 to 35 I could

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:49.640 
can see that I've got 10 to 35 I could
change<00:03:45.990> that<00:03:46.230> to<00:03:46.470> say<00:03:46.740> 40<00:03:47.190> here<00:03:47.520> and<00:03:48.200> now<00:03:49.200> if<00:03:49.470> i

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
change that to say 40 here and now if i

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.890 
change that to say 40 here and now if i
use<00:03:50.160> my<00:03:50.340> playhead<00:03:50.790> it's<00:03:51.300> going<00:03:51.480> to<00:03:51.540> be<00:03:51.660> took

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
use my playhead it's going to be took

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.530 
use my playhead it's going to be took
play<00:03:52.170> between<00:03:52.440> the<00:03:52.620> two<00:03:52.830> maybe

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:53.540 
play between the two maybe

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:58.420 
play between the two maybe
on<00:03:53.750> loop<00:03:54.230> and<00:03:55.780> also<00:03:56.780> if<00:03:57.560> I<00:03:57.739> click<00:03:57.950> there<00:03:58.159> I<00:03:58.280> go

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.430 
on loop and also if I click there I go

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:00.099 
on loop and also if I click there I go
back<00:03:58.579> to<00:03:58.640> my<00:03:58.790> previous<00:03:59.030> setting<00:03:59.599> next<00:03:59.870> we<00:03:59.959> come

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:00.109 
back to my previous setting next we come

00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:01.780 
back to my previous setting next we come
to<00:04:00.170> this<00:04:00.379> drop<00:04:00.650> down<00:04:00.680> here<00:04:01.099> so<00:04:01.280> this<00:04:01.400> is<00:04:01.579> saying

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 
to this drop down here so this is saying

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:03.759 
to this drop down here so this is saying
global<00:04:02.390> and<00:04:02.569> we<00:04:02.629> can<00:04:02.780> see<00:04:02.959> that<00:04:03.109> the<00:04:03.170> frame

00:04:03.759 --> 00:04:03.769 
global and we can see that the frame

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:07.209 
global and we can see that the frame
range<00:04:03.980> is<00:04:04.159> 12<00:04:04.549> a<00:04:04.989> 51<00:04:05.989> 250<00:04:06.379> mother<00:04:06.530> so<00:04:06.769> if<00:04:06.859> i<00:04:06.980> go

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:07.219 
range is 12 a 51 250 mother so if i go

00:04:07.219 --> 00:04:10.780 
range is 12 a 51 250 mother so if i go
to<00:04:08.319> project<00:04:09.319> settings<00:04:09.500> you<00:04:09.890> can<00:04:09.920> see<00:04:10.310> that<00:04:10.579> i

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:10.790 
to project settings you can see that i

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:14.110 
to project settings you can see that i
have<00:04:10.849> project<00:04:11.480> settings<00:04:11.659> of<00:04:11.900> 12<00:04:12.200> 50<00:04:12.819> if<00:04:13.819> we<00:04:13.970> now

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:14.120 
have project settings of 12 50 if we now

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.550 
have project settings of 12 50 if we now
go<00:04:14.359> over<00:04:14.629> and<00:04:14.780> have<00:04:14.870> a<00:04:14.930> look<00:04:14.989> at<00:04:15.200> this<00:04:15.319> node

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560 
go over and have a look at this node

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.939 
go over and have a look at this node
here<00:04:15.859> so<00:04:16.370> if<00:04:16.609> i<00:04:16.699> click<00:04:16.759> on<00:04:17.030> it<00:04:17.560> we<00:04:18.560> can<00:04:18.590> see<00:04:18.859> that

00:04:18.939 --> 00:04:18.949 
here so if i click on it we can see that

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:22.260 
here so if i click on it we can see that
moment<00:04:19.340> will<00:04:19.489> frame<00:04:20.269> 24<00:04:21.019> so<00:04:21.259> if<00:04:21.380> i<00:04:21.500> press<00:04:21.769> play

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270 
moment will frame 24 so if i press play

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.129 
moment will frame 24 so if i press play
nothing<00:04:23.270> really<00:04:23.509> seems<00:04:23.750> to<00:04:23.870> be<00:04:23.990> happening

00:04:24.129 --> 00:04:24.139 
nothing really seems to be happening

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:26.320 
nothing really seems to be happening
here<00:04:24.500> that's<00:04:25.250> because<00:04:25.639> if<00:04:25.910> we<00:04:26.030> double-click

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.330 
here that's because if we double-click

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.240 
here that's because if we double-click
on<00:04:26.479> this<00:04:26.720> node<00:04:26.930> we<00:04:27.560> can<00:04:27.710> see<00:04:27.860> that<00:04:27.979> it's<00:04:28.099> got<00:04:28.130> a

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:28.250 
on this node we can see that it's got a

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:31.300 
on this node we can see that it's got a
frame<00:04:28.490> range<00:04:28.699> of<00:04:28.849> 122<00:04:29.539> 240<00:04:30.259> so<00:04:30.710> to<00:04:30.800> force<00:04:31.160> the

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:31.310 
frame range of 122 240 so to force the

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:34.150 
frame range of 122 240 so to force the
viewer<00:04:31.550> to<00:04:31.610> display<00:04:32.180> that<00:04:32.360> i<00:04:32.570> would<00:04:33.169> go<00:04:33.349> input

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.160 
viewer to display that i would go input

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:39.900 
viewer to display that i would go input
and<00:04:34.370> now<00:04:35.120> we're<00:04:35.360> looking<00:04:35.479> at<00:04:35.780> frame<00:04:36.110> 1<00:04:37.099> 22<00:04:37.729> 240

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:39.910 
and now we're looking at frame 1 22 240

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:43.839 
and now we're looking at frame 1 22 240
if<00:04:40.910> i<00:04:41.090> zoom<00:04:41.120> while<00:04:41.780> over<00:04:42.139> this<00:04:42.490> timeline<00:04:43.490> so

00:04:43.839 --> 00:04:43.849 
if i zoom while over this timeline so

00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:46.120 
if i zoom while over this timeline so
let's<00:04:44.570> do<00:04:44.690> it<00:04:44.810> drag<00:04:45.110> like<00:04:45.349> that<00:04:45.530> middle<00:04:45.979> mouse

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:46.130 
let's do it drag like that middle mouse

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:48.670 
let's do it drag like that middle mouse
drag<00:04:46.430> you<00:04:47.030> can<00:04:47.210> see<00:04:47.360> now<00:04:47.570> I<00:04:47.599> have<00:04:47.960> a<00:04:48.169> new<00:04:48.229> frame

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:48.680 
drag you can see now I have a new frame

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.730 
drag you can see now I have a new frame
range<00:04:48.889> of<00:04:49.039> 156<00:04:49.789> to<00:04:50.120> 177<00:04:50.900> and<00:04:51.229> that<00:04:51.620> is

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:51.740 
range of 156 to 177 and that is

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:53.520 
range of 156 to 177 and that is
represented<00:04:52.250> by<00:04:52.280> custom<00:04:52.910> so<00:04:53.120> if<00:04:53.180> I<00:04:53.270> press<00:04:53.479> play

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:53.530 
represented by custom so if I press play

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:56.770 
represented by custom so if I press play
you<00:04:54.530> can<00:04:54.680> see<00:04:54.889> now<00:04:55.099> it's<00:04:55.849> going<00:04:56.060> to<00:04:56.120> go<00:04:56.240> from<00:04:56.509> 1

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:56.780 
you can see now it's going to go from 1

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:01.750 
you can see now it's going to go from 1
562<00:04:58.330> 177<00:04:59.330> and<00:04:59.510> if<00:05:00.020> i<00:05:00.169> zoom<00:05:00.199> in<00:05:00.860> even<00:05:00.949> closer<00:05:01.280> I

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:01.760 
562 177 and if i zoom in even closer I

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:05.200 
562 177 and if i zoom in even closer I
now<00:05:02.659> have<00:05:02.870> a<00:05:03.050> new<00:05:03.080> frame<00:05:03.470> range<00:05:03.650> of<00:05:03.860> 161<00:05:04.490> to<00:05:04.699> 163

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:05.210 
now have a new frame range of 161 to 163

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:07.659 
now have a new frame range of 161 to 163
and<00:05:05.599> that's<00:05:06.050> custom<00:05:06.530> again<00:05:06.949> so<00:05:07.220> if<00:05:07.340> I<00:05:07.460> want<00:05:07.580> to

00:05:07.659 --> 00:05:07.669 
and that's custom again so if I want to

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:10.330 
and that's custom again so if I want to
go<00:05:07.820> back<00:05:07.849> to<00:05:08.000> input<00:05:08.449> now<00:05:09.080> I<00:05:09.110> get<00:05:09.320> to<00:05:09.349> see<00:05:09.560> the

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:10.340 
go back to input now I get to see the

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:14.169 
go back to input now I get to see the
whole<00:05:10.370> range<00:05:10.880> of<00:05:11.060> that<00:05:11.900> node
