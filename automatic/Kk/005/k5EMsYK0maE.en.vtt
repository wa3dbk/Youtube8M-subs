00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.200
 but first let us recall what is so 

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.880
 notable rotor archive 

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:07.600
 motor 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.880
 first we have very little in the so-called 

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:11.950
 given volume and for this 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:13.930
 reason he is very profitable at what may 

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:16.340
 give secondly as already said small 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:17.580
 weight or geometric 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.520
 compactness and third best 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.339
 balance 

00:00:21.339 --> 00:00:23.499
 could continue the squad if 

00:00:23.499 --> 00:00:25.049
 would not be inherent in this type of motor 

00:00:25.049 --> 00:00:27.039
 constructive consumption Ndi show oil 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:28.909
 few resources and increased consumption 

00:00:28.909 --> 00:00:30.539
 fuel 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.070
 most experiments are 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.980
 long piston engine did not come out 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:35.780
 beyond prototypes 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:37.870
 and only and Japanese mazda still persistently 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:39.600
 unwilling to give up 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.540
 this type of powertrain 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:43.120
 and this persistence causes not only 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:44.970
 respect but it is fertile 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:47.120
 soil for growing the army 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.100
 loyal fans 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.550
 masters by the way how 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:51.930
 of course not 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.670
 Secondly 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.160
 m on foot my favorite rotary motor 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.910
 We're not looking for easy ways 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:59.780
 we decided to figure out how 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:01.280
 connection from April 1 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.300
 in the region of 500 people 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.950
 just my little it but 

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:06.810
 happened 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.090
 but alexey was a whole era in the world 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.820
 automotive industry in the early 90s in the world 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.340
 began the struggle for a radical decline 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:14.920
 harmful emissions 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.729
 it would seem that the people on the porsche motor need it 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.520
 it was a cross but mazda failed 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.340
 precisely lip and alexey became 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.120
 answer to all skeptics of overburden 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.620
 decided to send so exotic 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:27.950
 motor in the dustbin of history given 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.050
 instance how well marked has been and 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:32.300
 tuning how outwardly he is so aggregative 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.090
 true at the moment when the car 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.810
 got into our hands on it covered up boost 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.780
 the controller is therefore strictly for us 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:40.950
 advised to follow the boost pressure and 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.370
 do not drive the arrow over the mark 0 6 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:45.510
 but first, Kirill V. street need 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:48.060
 Qatari Tatars were there 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.220
 leonardo 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.770
 I doubt that in the starting lineup 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:52.890
 country law 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.690
 whole landing system 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:56.480
 in the presence of water carcass 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:57.730
 security 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:00.840
 clearly not adapted for May 188 centimeters 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:04.360
 right foot pedal rules 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.250
 gas 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.999
 it clearly does not decrease 

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:11.999
 main station 

00:02:15.189 --> 00:02:18.070
 external debt but mu hen 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:20.630
 conclusions at least impossible but sharp 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:23.400
 steering wheel yes very nice tube vatslav which 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.070
 a visit is a little different from 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:26.340
 such on the classic 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.109
 lousy motors 

00:02:28.109 --> 00:02:30.219
 unbalanced suspension which 

00:02:30.219 --> 00:02:31.939
 expressed in a bit exaggerated 

00:02:31.939 --> 00:02:33.819
 squatting on the rear wheels during 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:35.379
 started working in the world 

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:37.189
 but by and large all this stuff 

00:02:37.189 --> 00:02:39.059
 compared to those who we have failed 

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:41.379
 ride it on the table uncommon machine 

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:42.389
 properly 

00:02:42.389 --> 00:02:43.749
 someone can be skeptical 

00:02:43.749 --> 00:02:45.799
 grinned in Vologda he freed himself 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:47.119
 there are mobiles 

00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:48.659
 of course this is the second car 

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:50.369
 weekend car 

00:02:50.369 --> 00:02:52.319
 but planned to be used can 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:54.229
 sometime be our city will appear 

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:55.369
 normal pistes 

00:02:55.369 --> 00:02:58.839
 generally it is built to fail 

00:02:58.839 --> 00:03:00.649
 After all, by and large as they say 

00:03:00.649 --> 00:03:02.949
 our money on it can only go 

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:05.329
 on the racetrack therefore remains 

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:07.029
 hope that in novosibirsk 

00:03:07.029 --> 00:03:09.259
 sometime something like 

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.969
 red ring
