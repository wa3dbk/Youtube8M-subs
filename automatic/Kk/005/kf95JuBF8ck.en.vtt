00:00:10.699 --> 00:00:14.549
 as female back and forth using the 24 hour command 

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:16.600
 av 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.600
 3 it may be necessary to invest an animation 

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:23.029
 that is, reversing the direction in which it moves 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:26.259
 for example in this case where the mosquito 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:31.119
 it moves to the left I may want it after the turn and also it 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:32.840
 move to the right 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.140
 for this what I'm going to do is going to be selected this final frame 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.660
 I put it for example on frame 30 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.250
 and now what I'm going to do is to duplicate this animation and give it the 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:44.270
 return 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:47.870
 selected all the animation by clicking and dragging 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.790
 and now I click and keep the key pressed down 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:54.910
 example a little more here 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:58.310
 that would attend is duplicate animation 

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:01.760
 Now what I'm going to do is to select the frames I want 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.500
 that appear inverted 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.500
 and I'm going to die ficaar timeline 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.320
 invest frames 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.490
 with this what I get is that the frame that was the last hour is the 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:13.880
 First 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.380
 and that the frame 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.060
 that was the first one before is the last one 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.060
 I would only transform these objects 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.780
 flipping them horizontally both one 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:27.640
 as another 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.470
 and I would have that same animation 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:32.070
 in a sense 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.620
 and in the next 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:37.950
 if I want there to be an intermediate in which there is no animation selected the 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.630
 frames that make up this animation 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:41.680
 dragged 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.970
 and so I left a space in which it is static and again they become 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:48.970
 again to show the animation we can try the movie 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:53.900
 and we see how the mosquito goes in one direction and how welbeck 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:00.250
