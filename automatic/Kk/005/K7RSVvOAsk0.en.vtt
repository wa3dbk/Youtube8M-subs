00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
white which acts as a glue and then I'm

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.780 
white which acts as a glue and then I'm
going<00:01:16.890> to<00:01:16.980> thread<00:01:17.960> from<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.050> back<00:01:19.490> of<00:01:20.490> the

pinch<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.660> back<00:01:25.050> of<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:25.860> paste<00:01:26.190> to<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.520> wire

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.080 
pinch the back of the paste to the wire

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.430 
pinch the back of the paste to the wire
to<00:01:28.080> secure<00:01:28.260> the<00:01:28.740> pace<00:01:29.010> to<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.400> wire<00:01:29.640> and<00:01:30.440> then

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:31.440 
to secure the pace to the wire and then

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:36.250 
to secure the pace to the wire and then
reshape

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:36.260 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.430 

this<00:01:36.800> is<00:01:36.980> your<00:01:37.160> base<00:01:37.450> I've<00:01:38.450> wrote<00:01:38.840> out<00:01:39.110> a<00:01:39.140> piece

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:39.440 
this is your base I've wrote out a piece

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.740 
this is your base I've wrote out a piece
of<00:01:39.470> gum<00:01:39.860> paste<00:01:40.190> onto<00:01:40.730> a<00:01:41.120> little<00:01:41.300> cornstarch

of gum paste onto a little cornstarch
and<00:01:42.410> now<00:01:42.830> I'm<00:01:43.040> ready<00:01:43.190> to<00:01:43.490> cut<00:01:43.760> the<00:01:43.790> pace<00:01:44.240> with<00:01:44.540> a

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 
and now I'm ready to cut the pace with a

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:49.429 
and now I'm ready to cut the pace with a
cutter<00:01:44.990> to<00:01:45.560> form<00:01:45.830> petals

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.270 

I'll<00:01:50.310> now<00:01:50.670> shake<00:01:51.090> these<00:01:51.390> petals<00:01:51.810> using<00:01:52.229> a<00:01:52.799> cell

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
I'll now shake these petals using a cell

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.230 
I'll now shake these petals using a cell
pad<00:01:53.670> and<00:01:54.179> then<00:01:54.869> attach<00:01:55.469> it<00:01:55.740> to<00:01:56.039> my<00:01:56.399> club<00:01:56.819> to

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
pad and then attach it to my club to

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.449 
pad and then attach it to my club to
form<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:58.409> rosebud

00:02:01.449 --> 00:02:01.459 

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:06.260 

I'm<00:02:02.459> using<00:02:02.909> a<00:02:03.209> dog<00:02:03.420> bone<00:02:03.810> tool<00:02:04.259> or<00:02:05.069> or<00:02:05.640> a<00:02:05.969> wall

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
I'm using a dog bone tool or or a wall

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.350 
I'm using a dog bone tool or or a wall
tool<00:02:06.689> if<00:02:06.990> you<00:02:07.109> have<00:02:07.380> and<00:02:07.890> take<00:02:08.549> the<00:02:08.729> ball<00:02:08.910> tool

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
tool if you have and take the ball tool

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.619 
tool if you have and take the ball tool
and<00:02:09.750> apply<00:02:10.560> pressure<00:02:11.190> around<00:02:11.910> the<00:02:12.090> very<00:02:12.360> very

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
and apply pressure around the very very

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:15.350 
and apply pressure around the very very
edge<00:02:13.019> of<00:02:13.290> the<00:02:13.440> petal<00:02:13.709> and<00:02:14.129> that<00:02:14.730> helps<00:02:15.090> to<00:02:15.209> get

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
edge of the petal and that helps to get

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.470 
edge of the petal and that helps to get
rid<00:02:15.569> of<00:02:15.690> the<00:02:15.810> cut<00:02:16.080> edge<00:02:16.260> and<00:02:16.760> give<00:02:17.760> the<00:02:17.940> petal<00:02:18.330> a

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
rid of the cut edge and give the petal a

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:24.800 
rid of the cut edge and give the petal a
more<00:02:18.810> realistic<00:02:19.530> look<00:02:22.970> now<00:02:23.970> I<00:02:24.000> will<00:02:24.360> begin<00:02:24.540> to

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
more realistic look now I will begin to

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.460 
more realistic look now I will begin to
attach<00:02:25.140> these<00:02:25.440> petals<00:02:25.980> to<00:02:26.250> the<00:02:26.280> base<00:02:27.470> I'm

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
attach these petals to the base I'm

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.380 
attach these petals to the base I'm
gonna<00:02:28.680> pick<00:02:28.920> up<00:02:29.040> one<00:02:29.310> petal<00:02:30.140> and<00:02:32.000> place<00:02:33.000> the

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
gonna pick up one petal and place the

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.110 
gonna pick up one petal and place the
based<00:02:33.690> in<00:02:34.079> front<00:02:34.470> of<00:02:34.560> the<00:02:34.650> petal<00:02:35.040> about<00:02:35.579> 1/3<00:02:35.940> of

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
based in front of the petal about 1/3 of

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.350 
based in front of the petal about 1/3 of
the<00:02:36.269> distance<00:02:36.299> down<00:02:37.790> so<00:02:38.790> the<00:02:38.910> cuddle<00:02:39.209> is

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
the distance down so the cuddle is
