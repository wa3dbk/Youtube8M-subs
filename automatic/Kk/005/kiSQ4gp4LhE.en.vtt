other to keep the flow of sand going but
nobody<00:03:55.319> in<00:03:55.470> India<00:03:55.620> does<00:03:56.040> this<00:03:56.280> stretching<00:03:56.670> of

nobody in India does this stretching of
very<00:03:57.120> very<00:03:57.420> few<00:03:57.720> so<00:03:58.290> every<00:03:59.010> port<00:03:59.430> in<00:03:59.610> India<00:03:59.970> is

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209 
very very few so every port in India is

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:03.319 
very very few so every port in India is
actually<00:04:00.989> creating<00:04:01.560> a<00:04:01.769> rocky<00:04:02.459> coastline<00:04:03.180> and

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:03.329 
actually creating a rocky coastline and

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:05.770 
actually creating a rocky coastline and
we<00:04:03.450> have<00:04:03.599> far<00:04:04.019> too<00:04:04.260> many<00:04:04.410> ports<00:04:04.950> we<00:04:05.549> have<00:04:05.670> a

kind of campaign with you about two
years<00:04:27.810> ago<00:04:27.960> that's<00:04:28.530> right<00:04:28.830> I<00:04:29.240> have<00:04:30.240> things

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:30.419 
years ago that's right I have things

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:32.750 
years ago that's right I have things
improved<00:04:30.630> what's<00:04:31.289> the<00:04:31.440> situation<00:04:31.770> well<00:04:32.250> you

improved what's the situation well you
know<00:04:32.940> I<00:04:33.180> don't<00:04:33.510> think<00:04:33.690> they've<00:04:33.840> improved<00:04:34.260> I

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 
know I don't think they've improved I

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:36.020 
know I don't think they've improved I
think<00:04:34.950> what<00:04:35.070> has<00:04:35.220> happened<00:04:35.669> since<00:04:35.789> your

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.030 
think what has happened since your

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:37.879 
think what has happened since your
campaign<00:04:36.510> started<00:04:37.110> there<00:04:37.380> is<00:04:37.500> a<00:04:37.530> greater

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:37.889 
campaign started there is a greater

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:40.370 
campaign started there is a greater
awareness<00:04:38.180> about<00:04:39.180> the<00:04:39.539> fact<00:04:39.810> that<00:04:39.990> our

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:40.380 
awareness about the fact that our

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:43.520 
awareness about the fact that our
coastline<00:04:41.130> is<00:04:41.340> under<00:04:41.610> threat<00:04:41.760> today<00:04:42.289> most<00:04:43.289> of

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:43.530 
coastline is under threat today most of

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:45.710 
coastline is under threat today most of
us<00:04:43.710> don't<00:04:43.889> realize<00:04:44.039> this<00:04:44.729> most<00:04:45.000> of<00:04:45.210> us<00:04:45.389> see<00:04:45.690> a

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:45.720 
us don't realize this most of us see a

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.290 
us don't realize this most of us see a
beach<00:04:46.280> occasionally<00:04:47.280> and<00:04:47.490> we<00:04:47.669> feel<00:04:47.940> you<00:04:48.150> know

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:48.300 
beach occasionally and we feel you know

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:50.750 
beach occasionally and we feel you know
there's<00:04:48.840> beaches<00:04:49.110> all<00:04:49.530> over<00:04:49.830> the<00:04:50.010> place<00:04:50.280> and

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:50.760 
there's beaches all over the place and

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:52.610 
there's beaches all over the place and
you<00:04:50.820> know<00:04:51.060> that's<00:04:51.330> not<00:04:51.630> an<00:04:51.810> area<00:04:52.110> that's<00:04:52.260> under

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:52.620 
you know that's not an area that's under

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:54.500 
you know that's not an area that's under
threat<00:04:52.919> and<00:04:53.220> it's<00:04:53.880> what<00:04:53.970> are<00:04:54.060> you<00:04:54.210> getting

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:54.510 
threat and it's what are you getting

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:56.180 
threat and it's what are you getting
worse<00:04:54.780> at<00:04:55.080> some<00:04:55.260> please<00:04:55.470> I<00:04:55.740> think<00:04:56.010> it's

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:56.190 
worse at some please I think it's

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:58.310 
worse at some please I think it's
getting<00:04:56.310> much<00:04:56.700> worse<00:04:57.060> now<00:04:57.419> for<00:04:57.780> the<00:04:57.870> simple

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:58.320 
getting much worse now for the simple

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.320 
getting much worse now for the simple
fact<00:04:58.350> that<00:04:58.710> our<00:04:58.830> coastlines<00:04:59.580> are<00:04:59.760> becoming

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.330 
fact that our coastlines are becoming

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:02.960 
fact that our coastlines are becoming
that<00:05:00.479> new<00:05:00.780> development<00:05:01.560> zone<00:05:01.800> for<00:05:02.250> India<00:05:02.580> and

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:02.970 
that new development zone for India and

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:05.240 
that new development zone for India and
so<00:05:03.419> we're<00:05:03.690> two<00:05:03.870> years<00:05:04.110> ago<00:05:04.530> they<00:05:04.770> were<00:05:04.800> still

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:05.250 
so we're two years ago they were still

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:07.730 
so we're two years ago they were still
not<00:05:05.610> that<00:05:05.910> sense<00:05:06.419> of<00:05:06.599> the<00:05:06.750> pressure<00:05:07.139> on<00:05:07.380> the

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:07.740 
not that sense of the pressure on the

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:10.400 
not that sense of the pressure on the
course<00:05:08.010> today<00:05:08.700> if<00:05:09.180> you<00:05:09.360> look<00:05:09.599> at<00:05:09.900> the<00:05:10.139> course

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:10.410 
course today if you look at the course

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:13.460 
course today if you look at the course
of<00:05:10.650> India<00:05:11.099> they<00:05:11.639> aware<00:05:12.000> the<00:05:12.330> all<00:05:12.780> the<00:05:13.080> thermal

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:13.470 
of India they aware the all the thermal

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:15.230 
of India they aware the all the thermal
power<00:05:13.650> projects<00:05:14.099> are<00:05:14.250> coming<00:05:14.610> there<00:05:15.000> where

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:15.240 
power projects are coming there where

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:17.210 
power projects are coming there where
the<00:05:15.419> nuclear<00:05:15.810> pore<00:05:16.020> proper<00:05:16.560> projects<00:05:17.099> are

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:17.220 
the nuclear pore proper projects are

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:18.500 
the nuclear pore proper projects are
going<00:05:17.250> to<00:05:17.460> come<00:05:17.669> they<00:05:18.060> were<00:05:18.210> the<00:05:18.360> new

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:18.510 
going to come they were the new

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:20.240 
going to come they were the new
townships<00:05:19.139> are<00:05:19.289> going<00:05:19.500> to<00:05:19.590> come<00:05:19.770> that's<00:05:19.979> where

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:20.250 
townships are going to come that's where

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:22.610 
townships are going to come that's where
the<00:05:20.370> ports<00:05:20.789> are<00:05:20.940> getting<00:05:21.270> built<00:05:21.510> so<00:05:21.960> the<00:05:22.110> the

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:22.620 
the ports are getting built so the the

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:25.730 
the ports are getting built so the the
coast<00:05:23.190> today<00:05:23.580> are<00:05:23.970> the<00:05:24.330> last<00:05:24.659> frontiers<00:05:25.470> if

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:25.740 
coast today are the last frontiers if

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:28.310 
coast today are the last frontiers if
you<00:05:25.860> may<00:05:26.070> say<00:05:26.310> I<00:05:26.520> mean<00:05:26.909> the<00:05:27.000> forests<00:05:27.630> were<00:05:28.140> the

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:28.320 
you may say I mean the forests were the

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:29.290 
you may say I mean the forests were the
big<00:05:28.530> issue

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:29.300 
big issue

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:31.450 
big issue
think<00:05:29.509> of<00:05:29.659> the<00:05:29.870> last<00:05:30.199> decade<00:05:30.560> him<00:05:31.069> aware<00:05:31.400> of

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:31.460 
think of the last decade him aware of

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:33.249 
think of the last decade him aware of
that<00:05:31.789> people<00:05:32.120> were<00:05:32.240> destroying<00:05:32.690> for<00:05:32.960> us<00:05:33.080> now

00:05:33.249 --> 00:05:33.259 
that people were destroying for us now

00:05:33.259 --> 00:05:35.170 
that people were destroying for us now
that's<00:05:33.530> slightly<00:05:33.770> protects<00:05:34.280> much<00:05:34.460> better<00:05:34.819> the

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:35.180 
that's slightly protects much better the

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:37.570 
that's slightly protects much better the
big<00:05:35.360> issue<00:05:35.599> is<00:05:35.900> how<00:05:36.080> to<00:05:36.110> local<00:05:36.680> people<00:05:37.069> benefit

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:37.580 
big issue is how to local people benefit

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:39.610 
big issue is how to local people benefit
from<00:05:37.610> forest<00:05:38.090> conservation<00:05:38.330> and<00:05:38.960> i<00:05:39.289> think<00:05:39.530> the

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:39.620 
from forest conservation and i think the

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:42.760 
from forest conservation and i think the
lesson<00:05:39.889> from<00:05:40.250> forests<00:05:40.729> course<00:05:41.330> is<00:05:41.659> that<00:05:41.930> costs

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:42.770 
lesson from forests course is that costs

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:45.550 
lesson from forests course is that costs
are<00:05:42.889> also<00:05:43.099> the<00:05:43.580> livelihood<00:05:44.419> base<00:05:44.810> of<00:05:45.110> so<00:05:45.379> many

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:45.560 
are also the livelihood base of so many

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:48.279 
are also the livelihood base of so many
million<00:05:46.129> 18<00:05:46.610> million<00:05:46.849> exactly<00:05:47.750> so<00:05:47.990> there's<00:05:48.199> no

00:05:48.279 --> 00:05:48.289 
million 18 million exactly so there's no

00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:52.119 
million 18 million exactly so there's no
harm<00:05:48.680> in<00:05:48.919> building<00:05:49.840> you<00:05:50.840> know<00:05:50.960> plants<00:05:51.650> etc<00:05:51.770> but

00:05:52.119 --> 00:05:52.129 
harm in building you know plants etc but

00:05:52.129 --> 00:05:53.710 
harm in building you know plants etc but
it<00:05:52.220> has<00:05:52.340> to<00:05:52.370> be<00:05:52.520> done<00:05:52.789> in<00:05:52.940> an<00:05:53.060> orderly<00:05:53.360> manner

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:53.720 
it has to be done in an orderly manner

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:56.439 
it has to be done in an orderly manner
it<00:05:54.259> has<00:05:54.409> to<00:05:54.530> be<00:05:54.620> done<00:05:54.740> properly<00:05:55.310> taking<00:05:56.270> into

00:05:56.439 --> 00:05:56.449 
it has to be done properly taking into

00:05:56.449 --> 00:05:59.080 
it has to be done properly taking into
account<00:05:56.479> this<00:05:57.199> absolutely<00:05:58.129> I<00:05:58.310> mean<00:05:58.520> nobody's

00:05:59.080 --> 00:05:59.090 
account this absolutely I mean nobody's

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:00.189

00:06:00.189 --> 00:06:00.199 
saying don't build a thermal power

00:06:00.199 --> 00:06:01.719 
saying don't build a thermal power
project<00:06:00.379> but<00:06:00.889> we<00:06:01.039> are<00:06:01.099> certainly<00:06:01.250> saying

that's the big challenge for a single

00:06:15.919 --> 00:06:18.189 
that's the big challenge for a single
course<00:06:16.190> of<00:06:16.400> the<00:06:16.490> new<00:06:16.669> forests<00:06:17.180> awareness<00:06:18.050> has
