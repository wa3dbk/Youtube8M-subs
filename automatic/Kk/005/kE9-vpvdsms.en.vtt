00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.419
 we had not known a week too 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.589
 loaded in ads of all kinds in 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:05.849
 the high tech universe for a long time and 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:07.529
 if you feel like you missed 

00:00:05.849 --> 00:00:09.360
 info you have four shows to 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.259
 catch up for this week and before to 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.610
 to go on weekends you have 

00:00:10.259 --> 00:00:13.200
 again one is this one then 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.879
 do you install 40 to heavy again 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.310
 today hello to all we are 

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:19.140
 the friday 4 april 2014 it's the fresh 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:28.830
 you're the weekend it's the 600 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:31.289
 who take your little agenda appointments 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.820
 on the page of June 2 and write super 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.590
 apple developers conference 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.990
 and yes because the cuppertino firm has 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.030
 yesterday sent the invitations for the wwdc 

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:40.290
 which will take place from June 2 to moscone 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.300
 center of san francisco 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.980
 like for every apple event we do 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.580
 knows nothing of what will be announced with 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.290
 certainty 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:47.730
 and if other people tell you 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:48.150
 that they are persuaded ads to 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.590
 come 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:51.690
 know that these are just 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.250
 assumptions on the other hand we know that 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.780
 apple will address the developers there 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.790
 so will be question of highway sweat and 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.430
 from iOS 10 in its next release 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:01.320
 these having been confirmed by apple if 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.120
 we also mention an iphone 6 for June 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.710
 this is less certain rumors 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.630
 also evoke the famous is 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.340
 eternal and watch that would be presented in 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.289
 two versions but there too no 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.179
 certainty at the end of last year tim 

00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:14.310
 cook indicated that apple will reserve us from 

00:01:12.179 --> 00:01:16.020
 new product families for 2014 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.270
 so we can assume that this time 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.439
 could be the right one for the match of 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.450
 more on the homepage of the 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.130
 apple wwdc conference 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.719
 the builder recalls that in six years 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.189
 the situation has changed and it is thanks to 

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:28.140
 application developers than the iphone 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.490
 has been successful for example we will talk 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.289
 so without any two novelties at 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.579
 level of apps and maybe a 

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:33.719
 new platform for which the 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.729
 developers could one imagine 

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:38.130
 others then will apple announce it to 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.229
 watch and iphones 6 or neither 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.579
 Answer June 2 next evolution 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.409
 major for the application vine who 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.789
 belongs to twitter vahid goes out of the frame 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.889
 messages posted strictly a 

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:48.479
 public and adds a feature of 

00:01:46.889 --> 00:01:50.009
 private chat based on the mini messages 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.569
 six-second video that made the 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.310
 success of the platform 

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:55.139
 vine now allows you to send 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.030
 video messages but also text to a 

00:01:55.139 --> 00:01:58.380
 other vine user we find the 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.090
 same principle as on twitter which 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.859
 belongs vine to send a message 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.600
 it is necessary that your interlocutor 

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:05.100
 follow survive if you wish 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.600
 send a message to a person that 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.310
 you follow but do not follow 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.460
 you must indicate your number 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.290
 phone that will be used 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:13.930
 for verification and your contact 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:15.670
 will receive a notification of the message if 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.260
 you want to send a message to 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.720
 a person who is not on valves 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.070
 the message will be sent via e-mail or mms 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.050
 to send a video message that's 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:24.490
 super simple pressed to save and 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:26.320
 as soon as you release the message is 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:27.820
 posted which should favor the 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:29.380
 swift exchanges and increase 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:31.870
 important way the number of messages 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.920
 posted on the platform the sending of 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.330
 group messages is not yet 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.460
 planned but you can post a message 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.870
 to several people which will create 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:39.610
 so many private conversations 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.170
 vine follows the example of another app 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:42.940
 move from the strictly public stream to 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.320
 private instagram and also wishes to 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.520
 measure to another app that has made 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:47.020
 the exchange of private video messages 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.550
 his success snap cat 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:50.020
 this new version announced as the 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:51.820
 most important of the history of valves 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:52.960
 who just had a year is available on 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:54.550
 ios and android 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:55.780
 and she's always free if he's 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:57.310
 a point on which we beat the 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.720
 united states of stitching is good 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.280
 sure the internet at very high speed 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.450
 in addition to the Atlantic connection via the 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.160
 fiber is much rarer than at 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.180
 we and google is probably 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.190
 one of the most dynamic actors 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.210
 in its development with a network 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.310
 already in place in three major cities 

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:10.870
 american google fiber but the 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.560
 mountain view company wants to go 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:13.420
 even further 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.890
 according to the American website d in formation 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.370
 whose information is relayed by the 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:17.620
 world 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.660
 google plans to become an operator 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.860
 google mobile telecommunications do not 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.000
 not wish to develop a 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.980
 network of antennas but could 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.350
 rely on an operator already in place 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.240
 like sprint verizon and become so a 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:30.370
 mba our famous virtual operators 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:31.990
 we know well in France and 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:33.460
 google that definitely does not make them 

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:35.920
 half things would ambition to 

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:38.230
 create a gigantic wifi network based 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.760
 on its google fiber infrastructure so 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:41.560
 to pass through voice traffic and 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.000
 data and for all areas that do not 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.560
 are not covered by his network either 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.540
 today almost all states 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.550
 united this traffic would therefore pass through the 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.740
 mobile network of his partner and if 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:52.120
 google also became a virtual operator 

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:53.590
 in France we ask you the question 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.570
