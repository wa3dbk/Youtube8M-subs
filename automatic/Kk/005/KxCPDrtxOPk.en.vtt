just stick to the outside of the beads
it<00:01:20.220> actually<00:01:20.580> gets<00:01:20.759> diffused<00:01:21.210> into<00:01:21.420> the

industrial use now but here's my

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.610 
industrial use now but here's my
question<00:02:34.519> okay<00:02:34.940> so<00:02:35.120> if<00:02:35.569> your<00:02:35.750> washer<00:02:36.230> spills

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
question okay so if your washer spills

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.649 
question okay so if your washer spills
now<00:02:36.950> it's<00:02:37.489> like<00:02:37.700> a<00:02:37.730> real<00:02:37.849> mess<00:02:38.209> and<00:02:38.390> you<00:02:38.450> got<00:02:38.569> to

00:02:38.649 --> 00:02:38.659 
now it's like a real mess and you got to

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:40.240 
now it's like a real mess and you got to
clean<00:02:38.720> up<00:02:38.840> all<00:02:39.019> that<00:02:39.049> water<00:02:39.379> but<00:02:39.860> you<00:02:40.010> know<00:02:40.129> how

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
clean up all that water but you know how

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.309 
clean up all that water but you know how
to<00:02:40.310> do<00:02:40.489> it<00:02:40.670> what<00:02:41.120> are<00:02:41.209> you<00:02:41.269> gonna<00:02:41.359> do<00:02:41.540> if<00:02:41.660> 1.3

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:42.319 
to do it what are you gonna do if 1.3

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:44.050 
to do it what are you gonna do if 1.3
million<00:02:42.560> beads<00:02:42.890> spill<00:02:43.250> out<00:02:43.370> of<00:02:43.400> that<00:02:43.609> thing

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
million beads spill out of that thing

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.360 
million beads spill out of that thing
so<00:02:44.269> I<00:02:44.299> think<00:02:44.569> there<00:02:44.930> better<00:02:45.109> be<00:02:45.200> a<00:02:45.890> little

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
so I think there better be a little

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.460 
so I think there better be a little
failsafe<00:02:46.579> going<00:02:47.150> on<00:02:47.299> there<00:02:47.510> because<00:02:47.900> those

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
failsafe going on there because those

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.670 
failsafe going on there because those
beads<00:02:48.709> are<00:02:48.859> gonna<00:02:49.010> be<00:02:49.160> nasty<00:02:49.640> to<00:02:49.849> clean<00:02:50.090> up<00:02:50.680> you

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
beads are gonna be nasty to clean up you

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.170 
beads are gonna be nasty to clean up you
make<00:02:51.829> a<00:02:51.859> good<00:02:52.069> point<00:02:52.129> Frank<00:02:52.670> I'm<00:02:52.849> gonna<00:02:52.940> have

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
make a good point Frank I'm gonna have

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:54.699 
make a good point Frank I'm gonna have
to<00:02:53.299> think<00:02:53.480> about<00:02:53.629> this<00:02:54.019> one<00:02:54.200> it's<00:02:54.349> gonna<00:02:54.409> be<00:02:54.680> a

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:54.709 
to think about this one it's gonna be a

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:58.869 
to think about this one it's gonna be a
tough<00:02:54.980> haul<00:02:55.280> so<00:02:55.909> I<00:02:55.940> think<00:02:56.060> what<00:02:57.549> we<00:02:58.549> do<00:02:58.730> it

00:02:58.869 --> 00:02:58.879 
tough haul so I think what we do it

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:01.660 
tough haul so I think what we do it
saving<00:02:59.299> 80%<00:02:59.870> of<00:03:00.379> the<00:03:00.440> water<00:03:00.590> and<00:03:00.950> half<00:03:01.459> the

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
saving 80% of the water and half the

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:03.399 
saving 80% of the water and half the
detergent<00:03:02.209> that<00:03:02.329> could<00:03:02.510> be<00:03:02.629> really<00:03:02.930> huge<00:03:03.230> so

00:03:03.399 --> 00:03:03.409 
detergent that could be really huge so

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:05.199 
detergent that could be really huge so
this<00:03:03.560> could<00:03:03.829> be<00:03:04.010> could<00:03:04.430> be<00:03:04.609> a<00:03:04.790> game-changer

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
this could be could be a game-changer

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:07.270 
this could be could be a game-changer
