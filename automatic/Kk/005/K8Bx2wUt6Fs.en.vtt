cell-like at the crochet crowd in his

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.940 
cell-like at the crochet crowd in his
old<00:01:48.390> video<00:01:48.600> he<00:01:48.869> shows<00:01:49.110> how<00:01:49.290> to<00:01:49.350> do<00:01:49.530> that<00:01:49.710> and

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
old video he shows how to do that and

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.039 
old video he shows how to do that and
there<00:01:50.100> is<00:01:50.130> some<00:01:50.399> gaps<00:01:50.640> but<00:01:51.360> see<00:01:51.630> how<00:01:51.780> nicely

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
there is some gaps but see how nicely

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.649 
there is some gaps but see how nicely
this<00:01:52.380> closes<00:01:52.860> up<00:01:53.040> when<00:01:53.220> I<00:01:53.250> just<00:01:53.549> pull<00:01:54.240> it<00:01:54.420> taunt

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
this closes up when I just pull it taunt

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.200 
this closes up when I just pull it taunt
like<00:01:54.899> that<00:01:55.079> so<00:01:55.409> I<00:01:55.439> pull<00:01:56.040> it<00:01:56.189> and<00:01:56.399> then<00:01:56.880> pull<00:01:57.090> it

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
like that so I pull it and then pull it

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.800 
like that so I pull it and then pull it
in<00:01:57.299> like<00:01:57.450> this<00:01:57.630> now<00:01:58.259> I<00:01:58.290> could<00:01:58.680> make<00:01:58.860> loose<00:01:59.310> ones

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
in like this now I could make loose ones

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.200 
in like this now I could make loose ones
like<00:02:00.810> this<00:02:01.079> and<00:02:01.439> you<00:02:02.340> get<00:02:02.460> these<00:02:02.640> loose<00:02:02.909> knots

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
like this and you get these loose knots

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.240 
like this and you get these loose knots
but<00:02:03.540> it's<00:02:03.659> not<00:02:03.840> very<00:02:04.140> consistent<00:02:04.799> and<00:02:04.890> if<00:02:05.070> you

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
but it's not very consistent and if you

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.010 
but it's not very consistent and if you
use<00:02:05.460> one<00:02:05.670> of<00:02:05.700> the<00:02:05.850> new<00:02:06.000> really<00:02:06.299> cool<00:02:06.509> ones<00:02:06.750> that

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
use one of the new really cool ones that

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.499 
use one of the new really cool ones that
is<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:07.290> solid<00:02:07.680> colors<00:02:08.009> you<00:02:09.000> want<00:02:09.179> to<00:02:09.239> be<00:02:09.330> more

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
is the solid colors you want to be more

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:10.669 
is the solid colors you want to be more
consistent<00:02:09.899> in<00:02:10.229> the

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
consistent in the

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.740 
consistent in the
way<00:02:10.769> that<00:02:11.099> your<00:02:11.310> gauge<00:02:12.000> is<00:02:12.269> going<00:02:12.569> the<00:02:12.719> way

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
way that your gauge is going the way

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.599 
way that your gauge is going the way
that<00:02:12.870> your<00:02:13.079> little<00:02:13.319> knots<00:02:13.500> are<00:02:13.739> going<00:02:14.069> so<00:02:14.400> I

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:14.609 
that your little knots are going so I

00:02:14.609 --> 00:02:16.490 
that your little knots are going so I
think<00:02:14.939> that<00:02:15.269> the<00:02:15.390> multi<00:02:15.719> colors<00:02:16.019> do<00:02:16.260> really

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
think that the multi colors do really

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.339 
think that the multi colors do really
well<00:02:16.739> in<00:02:17.040> this<00:02:17.219> method<00:02:17.459> and<00:02:17.939> this<00:02:18.870> is

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:19.349 
well in this method and this is

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:21.069 
well in this method and this is
something<00:02:19.530> that<00:02:19.799> all<00:02:19.920> you<00:02:20.099> want<00:02:20.280> to<00:02:20.340> do<00:02:20.519> is

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:21.079 
something that all you want to do is

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:23.750 
something that all you want to do is
continue<00:02:22.079> on<00:02:22.109> until<00:02:22.890> you<00:02:23.010> get<00:02:23.189> to<00:02:23.370> the<00:02:23.459> end<00:02:23.609> of

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
continue on until you get to the end of

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.759 
continue on until you get to the end of
your<00:02:23.879> ball<00:02:24.030> now<00:02:24.689> you<00:02:24.750> could<00:02:25.019> use<00:02:25.049> half<00:02:25.439> a<00:02:25.590> ball

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:25.769 
your ball now you could use half a ball

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:28.399 
your ball now you could use half a ball
for<00:02:26.310> a<00:02:26.340> small<00:02:26.670> rope<00:02:26.879> scarf<00:02:27.269> or<00:02:27.810> you<00:02:27.989> can<00:02:28.200> use
