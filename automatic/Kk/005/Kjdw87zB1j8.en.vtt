all right today I'm going to show you
how<00:00:03.090> to<00:00:03.680> combine<00:00:04.680> two<00:00:05.520> pieces<00:00:05.910> of<00:00:06.089> yarn

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
how to combine two pieces of yarn

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.430 
how to combine two pieces of yarn
together<00:00:06.799> into<00:00:07.799> one<00:00:08.240> and<00:00:09.240> you<00:00:09.780> can<00:00:09.990> pretend

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
together into one and you can pretend

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.959 
together into one and you can pretend
that<00:00:10.910> this<00:00:11.910> is<00:00:12.150> one<00:00:12.389> end<00:00:12.860> of<00:00:13.860> the<00:00:14.519> ball<00:00:14.670> of<00:00:14.820> yarn

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
that this is one end of the ball of yarn

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:16.640 
that this is one end of the ball of yarn
that<00:00:15.120> you've<00:00:15.389> just<00:00:15.660> used<00:00:15.809> up<00:00:16.049> and<00:00:16.260> this<00:00:16.410> is<00:00:16.470> the

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
that you've just used up and this is the

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.540 
that you've just used up and this is the
new<00:00:16.949> ball<00:00:17.190> of<00:00:17.220> yarn<00:00:17.369> that<00:00:18.260> you<00:00:19.260> are<00:00:19.619> going<00:00:20.369> to

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
new ball of yarn that you are going to

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.109 
new ball of yarn that you are going to
attach<00:00:21.230> okay<00:00:22.230> so<00:00:22.289> this<00:00:22.740> works<00:00:23.039> this<00:00:23.730> is<00:00:23.910> called

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
attach okay so this works this is called

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.580 
attach okay so this works this is called
spit<00:00:24.449> splicing<00:00:24.810> and<00:00:25.260> it<00:00:26.039> works<00:00:26.400> with<00:00:27.590> wool

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
spit splicing and it works with wool

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.679 
spit splicing and it works with wool
blends<00:00:28.949> this<00:00:29.670> happens<00:00:30.119> to<00:00:30.300> be<00:00:30.330> a<00:00:30.449> hundred

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
blends this happens to be a hundred

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.880 
blends this happens to be a hundred
percent<00:00:30.810> wool<00:00:32.570> but<00:00:33.570> I've<00:00:33.930> done<00:00:34.260> spit<00:00:34.590> splicing

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
percent wool but I've done spit splicing

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.630 
percent wool but I've done spit splicing
before<00:00:35.430> when<00:00:35.670> there's<00:00:36.450> it's<00:00:36.780> been<00:00:37.050> like<00:00:37.640> only

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
before when there's it's been like only

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.660 
before when there's it's been like only
20<00:00:38.969> percent<00:00:39.270> and<00:00:39.629> that<00:00:39.750> still<00:00:39.989> works<00:00:40.200> okay

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:40.670 
20 percent and that still works okay

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.459 
20 percent and that still works okay
okay<00:00:41.670> so<00:00:41.730> what<00:00:42.059> you're<00:00:42.180> gonna<00:00:42.329> do<00:00:42.600> is<00:00:42.870> you<00:00:43.350> can

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
see a bead like a forked tail on my yarn

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.139 
see a bead like a forked tail on my yarn
I'm<00:00:48.420> gonna<00:00:48.570> do<00:00:48.780> that<00:00:48.930> on<00:00:49.230> one<00:00:49.500> and<00:00:50.280> then<00:00:51.030> I'm

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.220 
gonna do that on the other end too okay
stem<00:00:56.550> yarn<00:00:56.820> is<00:00:57.030> already<00:00:57.390> plied<00:00:57.719> and<00:00:58.109> it's

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
stem yarn is already plied and it's

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.299 
stem yarn is already plied and it's
really<00:00:58.410> easy<00:00:58.649> to<00:00:58.829> pull<00:00:59.280> apart<00:00:59.960> a<00:01:00.960> couple<00:01:01.859> of

this is the part where the spit comes in
to<00:01:32.130> spit<00:01:32.460> splicing<00:01:32.820> and<00:01:34.009> we<00:01:35.009> don't<00:01:35.189> need<00:01:35.340> to

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
to spit splicing and we don't need to

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.390 
to spit splicing and we don't need to
show<00:01:35.640> this<00:01:35.790> on<00:01:36.000> camera<00:01:36.500> but<00:01:37.500> really<00:01:38.189> all

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
you're just felting your felt seeing the

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.760 
you're just felting your felt seeing the
wall<00:02:01.320> together<00:02:02.899> and<00:02:03.899> you<00:02:04.259> all<00:02:04.380> should<00:02:04.409> know

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
how to felt because I just posted about

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:09.700 
how to felt because I just posted about
it<00:02:09.030> a<00:02:09.090> couple

it a couple

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:14.950 
it a couple
to<00:02:09.770> go<00:02:10.990> felting<00:02:11.990> is<00:02:12.140> what<00:02:12.490> you<00:02:13.490> use<00:02:13.960> moisture

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:14.960 
to go felting is what you use moisture

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:19.570 
to go felting is what you use moisture
and<00:02:15.290> heat<00:02:17.440> to<00:02:18.440> get<00:02:18.560> the<00:02:18.710> fibers<00:02:19.100> to<00:02:19.310> fuse

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
and heat to get the fibers to fuse

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:25.810 
and heat to get the fibers to fuse
together<00:02:20.320> okay<00:02:21.320> and<00:02:24.520> it's<00:02:25.520> going<00:02:25.640> to<00:02:25.700> get

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820 
together okay and it's going to get

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:29.470 
together okay and it's going to get
really<00:02:26.120> warm<00:02:26.300> in<00:02:26.480> your<00:02:26.600> hands<00:02:27.970> but<00:02:28.970> as<00:02:29.120> you<00:02:29.330> can

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480

see<00:02:29.560> it's<00:02:30.560> a<00:02:30.830> pretty<00:02:31.220> smooth<00:02:31.610> join<00:02:32.030> and<00:02:33.280> it's

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
see it's a pretty smooth join and it's

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.620 
see it's a pretty smooth join and it's
strong<00:02:35.560> it's<00:02:36.560> not<00:02:36.830> gonna<00:02:37.010> come<00:02:37.250> apart<00:02:37.370> and<00:02:38.000> so

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
strong it's not gonna come apart and so

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:40.510 
strong it's not gonna come apart and so
this<00:02:38.810> is<00:02:38.960> how<00:02:39.110> you<00:02:39.170> can<00:02:39.470> join<00:02:39.740> two<00:02:40.100> ends<00:02:40.430> of

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:40.520 
this is how you can join two ends of

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:43.690 
this is how you can join two ends of
yarn<00:02:40.760> together<00:02:40.970> without<00:02:41.540> tying<00:02:42.230> a<00:02:42.440> knot<00:02:42.700> this

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
yarn together without tying a knot this

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.250 
yarn together without tying a knot this
is<00:02:43.880> really<00:02:44.150> great<00:02:44.330> on<00:02:44.510> projects<00:02:45.020> that<00:02:45.050> you're

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
is really great on projects that you're

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.650 
is really great on projects that you're
doing<00:02:45.440> on<00:02:45.970> garments<00:02:46.970> that<00:02:47.120> you<00:02:47.210> don't<00:02:47.360> want<00:02:47.600> to

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
doing on garments that you don't want to

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.680 
doing on garments that you don't want to
have<00:02:47.860> knots<00:02:48.860> or<00:02:49.340> you<00:02:49.460> have<00:02:49.670> something<00:02:50.450> where

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
have knots or you have something where

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:52.510 
have knots or you have something where
you<00:02:50.780> don't<00:02:50.960> have<00:02:51.140> if<00:02:51.920> you're<00:02:52.040> doing<00:02:52.190> the<00:02:52.340> Hat

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:52.520 
you don't have if you're doing the Hat

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.040 
you don't have if you're doing the Hat
and<00:02:52.790> you<00:02:52.850> don't<00:02:53.000> have<00:02:53.090> an<00:02:53.240> end<00:02:53.450> to<00:02:53.690> hide<00:02:53.900> the

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.050 
and you don't have an end to hide the

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:57.670 
and you don't have an end to hide the
edge<00:02:54.740> on<00:02:55.570> so<00:02:56.570> this<00:02:56.870> is<00:02:56.930> just<00:02:57.230> a<00:02:57.350> great<00:02:57.530> way<00:02:57.650> to

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
edge on so this is just a great way to

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.420 
edge on so this is just a great way to
join<00:02:58.160> two<00:02:58.790> ends<00:02:58.940> of<00:02:59.060> yarn<00:02:59.270> together
