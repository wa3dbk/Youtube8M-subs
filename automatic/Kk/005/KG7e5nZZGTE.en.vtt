00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
going to see what it's like in

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.240 
going to see what it's like in
first-person<00:02:16.190> mode<00:02:17.320> so<00:02:18.320> swimming<00:02:18.890> in<00:02:19.010> first

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
first-person mode so swimming in first

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.490

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
mesum oh it looks quite nice it looks

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.760 
mesum oh it looks quite nice it looks
more<00:02:21.860> realistic<00:02:21.980> being<00:02:22.460> a<00:02:22.610> third<00:02:22.820> person<00:02:23.150> view

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
more realistic being a third person view

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:27.670 
more realistic being a third person view
so<00:02:24.770> just<00:02:25.190> come<00:02:25.910> down<00:02:26.150> to<00:02:26.330> the<00:02:26.450> water<00:02:26.660> and<00:02:26.960> check

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
so just come down to the water and check

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.970 
so just come down to the water and check
the<00:02:27.709> split<00:02:28.070> shot<00:02:28.310> it's<00:02:28.880> all<00:02:29.030> with<00:02:29.270> the<00:02:29.420> guys

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
the split shot it's all with the guys

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.010 
the split shot it's all with the guys
like<00:02:30.980> just<00:02:31.190> look<00:02:31.370> at<00:02:31.520> that<00:02:31.670> view<00:02:31.880> and<00:02:32.180> what<00:02:32.930> you

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.020 
like just look at that view and what you

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.980 
like just look at that view and what you
can<00:02:33.170> do<00:02:33.320> so<00:02:33.800> it's<00:02:34.760> just<00:02:34.880> the<00:02:35.180> only<00:02:35.540> downside

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:35.990 
can do so it's just the only downside

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:37.870 
can do so it's just the only downside
about<00:02:36.020> it<00:02:36.410> is<00:02:36.530> it's<00:02:37.070> just<00:02:37.280> hard<00:02:37.550> to<00:02:37.640> move

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
about it is it's just hard to move

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.449 
about it is it's just hard to move
around<00:02:38.000> when<00:02:38.360> you<00:02:38.480> walk<00:02:38.860> but<00:02:39.860> you<00:02:39.980> hit<00:02:40.160> sway

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 
around when you walk but you hit sway

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:43.090 
around when you walk but you hit sway
from<00:02:40.490> side<00:02:40.910> to<00:02:41.060> side<00:02:41.090> and<00:02:41.690> it's<00:02:42.560> like<00:02:42.709> a<00:02:42.740> drunk

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.100 
from side to side and it's like a drunk

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.250 
from side to side and it's like a drunk
it's<00:02:43.280> so<00:02:43.459> hard<00:02:43.640> to<00:02:43.730> move<00:02:44.000> but<00:02:44.840> you'll<00:02:45.080> get<00:02:45.230> a

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
it's so hard to move but you'll get a

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.690 
it's so hard to move but you'll get a
hold<00:02:45.590> of<00:02:45.650> it<00:02:45.770> soon<00:02:46.250> as<00:02:46.370> the<00:02:46.750> hang<00:02:47.750> of<00:02:47.870> it<00:02:47.930> so

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
hold of it soon as the hang of it so

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.440 
hold of it soon as the hang of it so

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:16.820 
but the only thing it doesn't really

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:19.330 
but the only thing it doesn't really
look<00:03:17.000> realistic<00:03:17.330> it's<00:03:17.930> just<00:03:18.140> the<00:03:18.440> steering

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
look realistic it's just the steering

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.479 
look realistic it's just the steering
wheel<00:03:19.519> like<00:03:20.150> you<00:03:20.600> have<00:03:20.720> no<00:03:20.930> arms<00:03:21.440> is<00:03:21.590> game<00:03:21.830> it

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:22.489 
wheel like you have no arms is game it

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:23.979 
wheel like you have no arms is game it
would<00:03:22.670> be<00:03:22.850> much<00:03:23.060> better<00:03:23.120> if<00:03:23.390> you<00:03:23.510> could<00:03:23.750> but

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:23.989 
would be much better if you could but

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:25.810
