and we don't speak much anymore at this

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.060 
and we don't speak much anymore at this
kind<00:02:52.280> of<00:02:52.400> time<00:02:52.580> just<00:02:52.820> because<00:02:53.500> if<00:02:54.500> I<00:02:54.800> follow

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.070 
kind of time just because if I follow

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:56.770 
kind of time just because if I follow
them<00:02:55.370> I<00:02:55.610> would<00:02:55.880> have<00:02:56.000> led<00:02:56.240> down<00:02:56.450> the<00:02:56.630> wrong

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
them I would have led down the wrong

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.180 
them I would have led down the wrong
path<00:02:56.990> and<00:02:57.050> I<00:02:57.380> wouldn't<00:02:57.740> be<00:02:57.800> in<00:02:57.890> this<00:02:57.980> position

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
path and I wouldn't be in this position

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:00.190 
path and I wouldn't be in this position
where<00:02:58.580> I<00:02:58.610> am<00:02:58.820> today<00:02:58.970> to<00:02:59.120> help<00:02:59.450> my<00:02:59.570> people<00:02:59.630> and

where I am today to help my people and

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.420 
where I am today to help my people and
that<00:03:00.500> was<00:03:00.650> the<00:03:00.800> ultimate<00:03:00.950> goal<00:03:01.460> so<00:03:02.350> I<00:03:03.430> guess

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
that was the ultimate goal so I guess

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.170 
that was the ultimate goal so I guess
that's<00:03:04.610> just<00:03:05.390> a<00:03:05.510> big<00:03:05.690> thing<00:03:05.720> is<00:03:06.080> sometimes<00:03:07.180> you

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:30.620 
difficult periods where you really have

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:34.600

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:34.610 
to knuckle down and study so so I was

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:36.250 
to knuckle down and study so so I was
always<00:06:34.789> a<00:06:34.969> little<00:06:35.000> bit<00:06:35.419> of<00:06:35.599> a<00:06:35.690> hermit<00:06:36.020> for

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:36.260 
always a little bit of a hermit for

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.540 
always a little bit of a hermit for
about<00:06:36.409> two<00:06:36.620> years<00:06:36.889> but<00:06:37.159> then<00:06:37.340> once<00:06:37.550> you<00:06:37.820> get

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:38.550 
about two years but then once you get

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:40.280 
about two years but then once you get
to<00:06:38.640> a<00:06:38.670> particular<00:06:39.060> level<00:06:39.390> it's<00:06:39.690> easy<00:06:39.930> to

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:40.290 
to a particular level it's easy to

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:42.350 
to a particular level it's easy to
maintain<00:06:40.470> that<00:06:40.860> level<00:06:41.040> so<00:06:41.400> in<00:06:41.730> fifth<00:06:42.270> and

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:42.360 
maintain that level so in fifth and

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:44.570

and then today you're the one who has to
do<00:07:03.840> it<00:07:03.870> and<00:07:04.170> I<00:07:04.560> guess<00:07:05.340> if<00:07:05.610> there's<00:07:06.600> someone

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:06.960 
do it and I guess if there's someone

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:08.570 
do it and I guess if there's someone
sitting<00:07:07.170> there<00:07:07.560> at<00:07:07.680> home<00:07:07.860> they<00:07:08.160> are<00:07:08.190> saying

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:08.580 
sitting there at home they are saying

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:13.760

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:13.770 
why would I want to do it and I think

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:15.920 
why would I want to do it and I think
it's<00:07:14.220> just<00:07:14.430> a<00:07:14.580> whole<00:07:14.730> new<00:07:14.940> life<00:07:15.210> and<00:07:15.510> and<00:07:15.780> you

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:15.930 
it's just a whole new life and and you

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:17.930 
it's just a whole new life and and you
can<00:07:16.080> bend<00:07:16.320> it<00:07:16.380> and<00:07:16.860> your<00:07:17.040> life<00:07:17.190> can<00:07:17.220> benefit<00:07:17.790> in

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:17.940
