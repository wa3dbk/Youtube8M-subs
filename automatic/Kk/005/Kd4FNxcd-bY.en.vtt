checking things out

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.450 
checking things out
got<00:00:13.410> a<00:00:13.440> winch<00:00:13.940> 8,000<00:00:14.940> pound<00:00:15.210> winch<00:00:16.400> so<00:00:17.400> of

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
got a winch 8,000 pound winch so of

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.050 
got a winch 8,000 pound winch so of
course<00:00:17.640> it<00:00:17.850> didn't<00:00:18.090> come<00:00:18.270> with<00:00:18.510> the<00:00:20.060> connector

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
course it didn't come with the connector

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.080 
course it didn't come with the connector
here<00:00:21.270> to<00:00:21.480> turn<00:00:21.689> it<00:00:21.869> on<00:00:21.990> and<00:00:22.170> off<00:00:22.260> so<00:00:22.820> you<00:00:23.820> can

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
here to turn it on and off so you can

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.670 
here to turn it on and off so you can
jump<00:00:24.420> a<00:00:24.660> couple<00:00:24.869> of<00:00:25.109> terminals<00:00:25.650> and<00:00:25.890> the<00:00:27.680> cable

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
jump a couple of terminals and the cable

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.820 
jump a couple of terminals and the cable
will<00:00:28.769> go<00:00:29.010> out<00:00:29.420> on<00:00:30.420> two<00:00:30.929> terminals<00:00:31.380> jumped<00:00:31.710> and

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
will go out on two terminals jumped and

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.410 
will go out on two terminals jumped and
then<00:00:31.890> it'll<00:00:32.189> come<00:00:32.340> back<00:00:32.579> in<00:00:32.820> on<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.059> other<00:00:33.180> two

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
then it'll come back in on the other two

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:40.729 
then it'll come back in on the other two
terminal<00:00:33.840> jumps<00:00:34.260> so<00:00:35.660> $70<00:00:36.660> for<00:00:36.989> a<00:00:37.020> new<00:00:39.739> switch

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
terminal jumps so $70 for a new switch

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:49.819 
terminal jumps so $70 for a new switch
so<00:00:41.070> let<00:00:41.219> me<00:00:41.340> show<00:00:41.579> you<00:00:41.670> what<00:00:41.820> I'm<00:00:41.879> going<00:00:41.940> to<00:00:42.090> do

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:55.870 
okay garbage picked just an electrical

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:58.890 
okay garbage picked just an electrical
power<00:00:56.710> when<00:00:56.920> to<00:00:57.040> switch<00:00:57.190> off<00:00:57.520> Ford<00:00:58.030> and<00:00:58.390> got<00:00:58.870> a

power when to switch off Ford and got a

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.840 
power when to switch off Ford and got a
little<00:00:59.110> dowel<00:00:59.350> here<00:00:59.770> and<00:00:59.950> put<00:01:00.160> some<00:01:00.190> plumbers

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:00.850 
little dowel here and put some plumbers

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:06.210 
little dowel here and put some plumbers
tape<00:01:01.840> on<00:01:02.080> there<00:01:02.970> then<00:01:04.470> I've<00:01:05.470> got<00:01:05.680> a<00:01:05.710> garbage

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:06.220 
tape on there then I've got a garbage

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:12.960 
tape on there then I've got a garbage
picked<00:01:07.440> extension<00:01:08.440> cord<00:01:09.660> and<00:01:10.660> I<00:01:10.750> just<00:01:11.970> put

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:12.970 
picked extension cord and I just put

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:17.359 
picked extension cord and I just put
some<00:01:13.119> new<00:01:13.240> ends<00:01:13.630> on<00:01:13.780> it<00:01:14.970> and<00:01:15.970> these<00:01:16.390> will

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
some new ends on it and these will

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.740 
some new ends on it and these will
obviously<00:01:18.369> they'll<00:01:18.759> just<00:01:18.940> plug<00:01:19.390> right<00:01:19.570> into

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:19.750 
obviously they'll just plug right into

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:21.090 
obviously they'll just plug right into
the<00:01:19.869> back<00:01:20.110> there<00:01:20.410> and<00:01:20.440> then<00:01:20.590> I'll<00:01:20.770> show<00:01:21.070> you

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.100 
the back there and then I'll show you

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:27.690 
the back there and then I'll show you
how<00:01:21.369> I<00:01:21.399> did<00:01:21.580> that<00:01:24.420> all<00:01:25.420> right<00:01:25.479> so<00:01:26.520> there's<00:01:27.520> our

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:27.700 
how I did that all right so there's our

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.219 
how I did that all right so there's our
switch<00:01:28.000> and<00:01:28.330> this<00:01:28.420> is<00:01:28.570> just<00:01:28.780> a<00:01:28.930> flashlight

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:29.229 
switch and this is just a flashlight

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:32.820 
switch and this is just a flashlight
continuity<00:01:30.220> tester<00:01:31.020> you<00:01:32.020> can<00:01:32.200> actually<00:01:32.649> just

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:32.830 
continuity tester you can actually just

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:35.279 
continuity tester you can actually just
take<00:01:33.070> and<00:01:33.550> touch<00:01:33.789> these<00:01:34.060> terminals<00:01:35.020> and<00:01:35.229> the

00:01:35.279 --> 00:01:35.289 
take and touch these terminals and the

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:38.810 
take and touch these terminals and the
light<00:01:35.500> will<00:01:35.710> come<00:01:35.860> on<00:01:36.780> so<00:01:37.780> what<00:01:38.050> I've<00:01:38.200> done<00:01:38.410> is

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
light will come on so what I've done is

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.600 
light will come on so what I've done is
you<00:01:39.820> can<00:01:40.030> take<00:01:40.300> the<00:01:40.539> switch<00:01:40.840> and<00:01:41.580> then<00:01:42.580> you

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:42.610 
you can take the switch and then you

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:47.310 
you can take the switch and then you
know<00:01:42.910> it's<00:01:43.180> coming<00:01:44.020> on<00:01:44.170> on<00:01:44.350> one<00:01:45.240> and<00:01:46.240> now<00:01:46.750> the

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:47.320 
know it's coming on on one and now the

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:48.590 
know it's coming on on one and now the
other<00:01:47.530> side

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
other side

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:55.230 
other side
you<00:01:49.600> know<00:01:49.660> that's<00:01:49.899> down<00:01:50.229> this<00:01:50.770> is<00:01:50.979> up<00:01:54.030> this<00:01:55.030> is

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.240 
you know that's down this is up this is

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.969 
you know that's down this is up this is
up

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
up

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.080 
up
that's<00:01:56.979> down<00:01:57.280> so<00:01:57.610> we're<00:01:57.729> going<00:01:57.819> to<00:01:57.880> have

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.090 
that's down so we're going to have

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:05.460 
that's down so we're going to have
voltage<00:01:58.750> to<00:01:59.380> the<00:01:59.649> middle<00:01:59.950> terminal<00:02:04.050> so<00:02:05.050> switch

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.470 
voltage to the middle terminal so switch

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:10.469 
voltage to the middle terminal so switch
is<00:02:05.649> done<00:02:08.250> and<00:02:09.250> it<00:02:09.369> says<00:02:09.610> up<00:02:09.819> and<00:02:09.970> down<00:02:10.149> but

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
is done and it says up and down but

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:11.880 
is done and it says up and down but
we'll<00:02:10.660> have<00:02:10.780> to<00:02:10.990> do<00:02:11.170> something<00:02:11.500> about<00:02:11.560> that

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
we'll have to do something about that

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.250 
we'll have to do something about that
because<00:02:12.450> yeah<00:02:13.450> it<00:02:13.569> doesn't<00:02:13.750> matter<00:02:13.930> it's

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
because yeah it doesn't matter it's

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.309 
because yeah it doesn't matter it's
going<00:02:14.290> to<00:02:14.440> work

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
going to work

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:20.339 
going to work
all<00:02:17.319> right<00:02:18.060> dug<00:02:19.060> this<00:02:19.239> out<00:02:19.480> I'm<00:02:19.599> a<00:02:19.690> junk<00:02:20.020> pile

00:02:20.339 --> 00:02:20.349 
all right dug this out I'm a junk pile

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:24.270 
all right dug this out I'm a junk pile
here<00:02:21.150> it's<00:02:22.150> just<00:02:22.360> a<00:02:22.720> trailer<00:02:23.470> connector<00:02:24.099> and

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
here it's just a trailer connector and

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.339 
here it's just a trailer connector and
you<00:02:24.730> just<00:02:24.910> cut<00:02:25.120> the<00:02:25.270> wires<00:02:25.480> wherever<00:02:25.989> you<00:02:26.110> want

00:02:26.339 --> 00:02:26.349 
you just cut the wires wherever you want

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:28.290 
you just cut the wires wherever you want
them<00:02:26.500> and<00:02:26.680> look<00:02:27.250> at<00:02:27.370> that<00:02:27.550> it's<00:02:27.790> got<00:02:27.880> its<00:02:28.180> own

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 
them and look at that it's got its own

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:33.660 
them and look at that it's got its own
little<00:02:29.400> plug<00:02:30.400> cap<00:02:31.000> on<00:02:31.239> it<00:02:31.920> so<00:02:32.920> we'll<00:02:33.099> wire<00:02:33.370> that

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
little plug cap on it so we'll wire that

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:38.809 
little plug cap on it so we'll wire that
in<00:02:33.940> there<00:02:34.680> see<00:02:35.680> if<00:02:35.770> that'll<00:02:35.950> work<00:02:36.190> for<00:02:36.520> us

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:42.259 

all<00:02:39.360> right<00:02:39.569> so<00:02:39.930> I<00:02:39.959> determined<00:02:40.879> this<00:02:41.879> one<00:02:42.120> with

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:42.269 
all right so I determined this one with

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:46.759 
all right so I determined this one with
the<00:02:42.390> whites<00:02:42.659> your<00:02:42.989> common<00:02:43.730> so<00:02:44.730> this<00:02:45.439> goes<00:02:46.439> down

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 
the whites your common so this goes down

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:56.650 
the whites your common so this goes down
that<00:02:47.640> goes<00:02:47.879> back<00:02:48.150> up<00:02:52.069> so<00:02:53.069> that<00:02:53.099> should<00:02:53.430> work

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.280 

so<00:02:57.320> there's<00:02:57.620> your<00:02:57.830> cover<00:02:58.870> you<00:02:59.870> see<00:03:00.200> it

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
so there's your cover you see it
