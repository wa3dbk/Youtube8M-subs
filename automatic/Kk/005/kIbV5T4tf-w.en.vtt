00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.859 
these to see if they're work with an
additional<00:01:44.460> case<00:01:44.610> on<00:01:44.909> so<00:01:45.119> let's<00:01:45.270> pop<00:01:45.450> this<00:01:45.659> in

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
additional case on so let's pop this in

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.770 
additional case on so let's pop this in
now<00:01:46.740> do<00:01:47.159> bear<00:01:47.340> in<00:01:47.460> mind<00:01:47.610> it<00:01:47.790> isn't<00:01:48.210> designed<00:01:48.390> to

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
now do bear in mind it isn't designed to

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.440 
now do bear in mind it isn't designed to
do<00:01:48.930> this<00:01:49.250> so<00:01:50.250> let's<00:01:50.520> just<00:01:50.610> push<00:01:50.970> this<00:01:51.180> down

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
do this so let's just push this down

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.429 
do this so let's just push this down
into<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:52.020> case<00:01:52.250> with<00:01:53.250> it<00:01:53.369> closed<00:01:54.110> it<00:01:55.110> sort<00:01:55.409> of

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
into the case with it closed it sort of

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.139 
into the case with it closed it sort of
bulges<00:01:55.860> a<00:01:55.890> little<00:01:56.159> bit<00:01:56.280> in<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:56.520> corners<00:01:56.939> here

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
bulges a little bit in the corners here

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.859 
bulges a little bit in the corners here
but<00:01:57.719> it<00:01:57.840> will<00:01:58.049> fit<00:01:58.409> in<00:01:58.649> when<00:01:59.520> you've<00:01:59.729> still<00:02:00.090> got

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
but it will fit in when you've still got

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.080 
but it will fit in when you've still got
an<00:02:01.200> additional<00:02:01.680> case<00:02:01.920> on<00:02:02.250> your<00:02:02.549> MacBook<00:02:02.880> Air

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090
