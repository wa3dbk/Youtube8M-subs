00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 hey people and welcome to mikes edit 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.839
 suite today I show you how he with 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:15.660
 a simple effect an incredible 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:17.279
 how can you achieve effect 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.900
 in a movie that represent a 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.330
 Person alone is for example 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.910
 nobody turned against them 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.039
 notice you are experiencing your own life 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.869
 around her while the person is sad 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.929
 and alone in her own little world 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:33.420
 actually it already looks like it is 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.820
 a mix of sharing labs and one 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.290
 standing still person the clip here 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.969
 I have just seen about two before 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.500
 years with the people of back in 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.790
 Germany at the Alexanderplatz 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.570
 recorded as easy here 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.100
 can recognize 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.930
 Here is the fair that you can not 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.460
 through external influences and movement too 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.770
 finds himself but on the way 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.660
 the inner peace and meditation 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.760
 That's what Raphael asked himself 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.070
 Trainer from Germany for about three 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.750
 hours before the camera emerged 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.640
 just over three minutes long clip 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.379
 if you want to see completely click on 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.910
 the link below in the description to 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.439
 you must create a time labs video 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.600
 her a long time movie or 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:09.140
 photograph a series of pictures and these 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.290
 then put together on pc or 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.030
 accelerate 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.130
 the biggest difficulty is over 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.020
 this actor must namely one 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.850
 to stay still for a long time 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.189
 that is not rock back and forth, 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.560
 really only wanted movements too 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.970
 Run as slowly as possible for you 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.060
 it means the camera on a tripod 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.470
 position camera and wait 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.450
 Of course, it does not always have to be three 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.430
 hours of material will come 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.009
 on how long you want that 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.200
 clip later will be about two months before 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.970
 I shot a similar clip 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.619
 I have a actress in the middle 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.090
 put on the kudamm I knew 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.710
 before that these limits are not very 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.840
 long in my film appears 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.759
 that's why it's just about enough for me 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.020
 five minutes to turn here was wanted 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.000
 I convey the message that that 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.270
 Little sad girl left alone 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.979
 becomes 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.110
 everyone is walking around them and no one 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.850
 is interested in the whole thing 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.750
 We shot a total of twice 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.340
 first time we had a bit 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.409
 difficulties with the wind and the 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.920
 hair of the actress fluttered out 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.110
 and forth 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.189
 that was not so nice anymore 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.960
 that will not be so nice 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:08.910
 look when it accelerates extremely 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.649
 That's why she's on the second 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.299
 try a braid tied 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.519
 I also wanted them to start in 

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:16.799
 The camera looks slowly at her head 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:18.420
 lowers that got me really well 

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:20.250
 I'm currently in the double 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.659
 premiere pro you can do this effect 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.099
 but also taken in the basics with everyone 

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:24.870
 create another cut program 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:26.939
 the only important thing is that you have the possibility 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.689
 have the speed of your clips too 

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:29.430
 change 

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:30.629
 From now on it will be just like us 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.180
 the piece which we accelerate 

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:34.650
 want to put out of the clip for it 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:39.510
 I start with where beautiful in the 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:41.939
 camera looks with them and point 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:44.540
 look how far I have the club 

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:44.540
 would like to 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:50.280
 a bit ah there you already look 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:53.280
 I do not want to go up that high again 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:58.290
 let me finish with that always 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:03:00.000
 still down nice frame looks here 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.670
 here people here people in the 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.189
 middle with o I now mark one 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:07.620
 output with this partner or simply 

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:09.060
 on the keyboard with the point I draw 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.950
 me the clip down in the timeline 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.750
 Now I have already seen that 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:14.639
 he gives a job in a family 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:19.290
 quite a long time from my presentation 

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:21.209
 there she is the family the 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:23.099
 I just cut out for that I go 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:25.949
 to the point just before the family 

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:28.859
 he does not have to be so precise 

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:30.590
 be here take the razor blade or 

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:36.199
 I just press on the keyboard 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:38.909
 Control k makes it a cut 

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:42.209
 Watch the family go away 

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:44.720
 there she goes on doing one again 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:44.720
 cut 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.970
 from this they ran the clip 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:55.370
 this will be accelerated later on 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:57.140
 do not look around at the premiere 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:59.180
 To change the speed we click 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:03.320
 with the right mouse button on the clip 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:05.270
 go on speed duration and 

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:07.550
 can now change the percentage 

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:09.710
 here is our creativity or ours 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:11.600
 own taste asked normal stands 

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:13.310
 The club is 100% correct 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:15.410
 However, the effect only comes off 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:17.480
 about 1000 percent I have it before 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:19.610
 times tested then I even noticed 1000 

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:22.400
 I like it very much, but you can 

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:24.800
 You can vary 2,000 3,000 4,000 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.840
 5,000 percent make it their own 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.790
 creativity no limit set 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.350
 Just try it out for yourself 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:31.910
 I like it best now 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:35.110
 of course, I have to do it 1000 times 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:42.350
 make both clips 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:43.190
 1000 right mouse button delete and gap 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:45.860
 shut down 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:47.450
 then he jumps clipping edge of the red 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.830
 dash here means that effect only 

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:50.300
 times must be changed that is the 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:51.770
 computer has the effect only once 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:55.250
 I simply tap on that 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:56.360
 the enter button depending on the length of the clips 

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:58.010
 and depending on the power of the computer 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:59.480
 a bit longer for a bit longer 

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:01.340
 take shorter I skip that here 

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:02.810
 Let's finish rendering it now 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:04.490
 and the red line is now green now 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:05.470
 our computer can make the clip liquid 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:07.580
 play 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:09.380
 that was a relatively simple and 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:10.820
 faster to create this effect 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:12.770
 Of course you can have a few here and there 

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:14.390
 invest in finer things and with the whole 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:16.130
 to accompany the appropriate music 

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:17.930
 but as a basis and to try 

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:19.490
 Should it be enough for you 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:20.480
 wanted to film several hours is it 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:22.190
 not bad either if you 

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:24.200
 in between times the battery or the 

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:25.880
 change memory card would have to pay attention 

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:27.860
 Just make sure you do not use the tripod 

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:29.420
 or the camera adjusts the couple 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:30.950
 seconds to lose for change 

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:32.840
 is ship and frankly 

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:34.610
 me no cut in my club 

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:36.140
 you do not even see it 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:38.060
 even just out and post yours 

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:39.980
 results on my facebook page 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:41.720
 otherwise I hope that I help you 

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:43.190
 could if you liked the video 

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:45.110
 gives the thumbs up it tells 

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:46.760
 your friends subscribe to the channel check 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:49.450
 facebook and see you at 

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:49.450
 next time whistles
