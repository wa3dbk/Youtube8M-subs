00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360

cannot<00:02:58.660> even<00:02:58.780> start<00:02:59.170> a<00:02:59.200> friendship<00:02:59.410> without

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
cannot even start a friendship without

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:03.089 
cannot even start a friendship without
trust<00:03:00.160> so<00:03:01.000> you<00:03:01.540> can't<00:03:01.750> talk<00:03:02.230> with<00:03:02.500> people<00:03:02.650> and

00:03:03.089 --> 00:03:03.099 
trust so you can't talk with people and

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:05.970 
trust so you can't talk with people and
then<00:03:03.280> as<00:03:03.549> things<00:03:03.910> develop<00:03:04.450> a<00:03:04.989> real<00:03:05.440> friend<00:03:05.830> is

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
then as things develop a real friend is

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.280 
then as things develop a real friend is
someone<00:03:06.190> who<00:03:06.370> you<00:03:06.640> can<00:03:06.790> really<00:03:07.060> trust<00:03:07.420> what

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
someone who you can really trust what

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.920 
someone who you can really trust what
pasada<00:03:08.650> does<00:03:08.980> is<00:03:09.280> she<00:03:09.849> trusts<00:03:10.269> her<00:03:10.390> friends

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
pasada does is she trusts her friends

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.610 
pasada does is she trusts her friends
and<00:03:11.080> she<00:03:11.769> gives<00:03:12.190> this<00:03:12.489> trust<00:03:12.970> and<00:03:13.450> she<00:03:14.140> gets<00:03:14.380> it

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
and she gives this trust and she gets it

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.890 
and she gives this trust and she gets it
back<00:03:14.860> she<00:03:15.250> has<00:03:15.459> some<00:03:15.670> really<00:03:15.940> awesome<00:03:16.239> friends

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
back she has some really awesome friends

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.199 
back she has some really awesome friends
and<00:03:17.080> I<00:03:17.560> think<00:03:17.829> this<00:03:17.950> is<00:03:18.130> a<00:03:18.160> concept<00:03:18.760> that<00:03:18.880> not

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
and I think this is a concept that not

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:21.690 
and I think this is a concept that not
many<00:03:19.450> people<00:03:19.540> understand<00:03:20.470> right<00:03:20.709> now<00:03:20.739> if<00:03:21.310> you

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
many people understand right now if you

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.210 
many people understand right now if you
don't<00:03:21.910> give<00:03:22.120> trust<00:03:22.540> to<00:03:22.810> your<00:03:22.989> friends<00:03:23.530> then

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
don't give trust to your friends then

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.039 
don't give trust to your friends then
you're<00:03:24.609> not<00:03:24.850> going<00:03:25.090> to<00:03:25.180> get<00:03:25.299> the<00:03:25.510> trust<00:03:25.840> back

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:26.049 
you're not going to get the trust back

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:30.990 
you're not going to get the trust back
if<00:03:26.590> you<00:03:26.739> have<00:03:26.980> this<00:03:27.220> mistrust<00:03:28.150> or<00:03:28.600> these<00:03:30.000> ideas

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000
