00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Over the next five minutes, we’ll show you five 
things that you can do with Starfish EARLY 
ALERT to share important information about 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:18.033
students and help them finish what they start. 
Ready? Here we go. One: Create your profile in 
Starfish. A personalized profile helps students 

00:00:18.033 --> 00:00:26.000
connect with you and encourages them to reach 
out. So get started by updating your profile with 
a photo and a bit of information about yourself. 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:35.033
Through your profile, you can also control how 
often and in what format you receive notifications 
about alerts raised on students with whom you 

00:00:35.033 --> 00:00:46.066
have a connection.  Your profile lets you know 
which flags may trigger an email to you when 
raised on a student. Two: Complete a faculty 

00:00:46.066 --> 00:00:55.000
progress survey.  With just a few clicks, faculty 
can report on the progress and challenges of 
students in each of their course sections, and 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:05.033
can include personalized comments where more 
information might be needed. When the survey 
is submitted, email notifications will be sent to 

00:01:05.033 --> 00:01:12.033
staff members and students based on your 
institution’s customized settings.  Staff 
members can find detailed information about the 

00:01:12.033 --> 00:01:23.033
flags raised by faculty on the surveys on the 
Student Tracking tab. From here they can take 
action on items either individually, or in bulk.  

00:01:23.033 --> 00:01:31.033
When staff members resolve an item raised by 
faculty, they can easily keep faculty in the loop 
with a close loop message that will be emailed 

00:01:31.033 --> 00:01:40.033
to the person that raised the item. Three: Review 
information about your students. When you 
need to know more about your students, you 

00:01:40.033 --> 00:01:48.066
can search for them by name or find them in 
your personalized students list. Your list can be 
filtered based on the roles that you play, and as 

00:01:48.066 --> 00:01:55.000
a faculty member, by the courses you teach. 
You can also filter your list by term and 
additional criteria that may have been set up by 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:02.033
your institution. When you’ve selected a student 
you want to work with, just click the student’s 
name, anywhere you see it with a hyperlink, to 

00:02:02.033 --> 00:02:11.033
open the student folder.  Depending on your role, 
you may see information that has been imported 
from your student information system or learning 

00:02:11.033 --> 00:02:20.033
management system, such as admissions 
information and course enrollments. You can 
add comments to existing flags, add notes to 

00:02:20.033 --> 00:02:30.000
the student folder, find and email other members 
of the student’s success network, and review 
any existing notes for the student. The detail of 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.000
what you see about each student is dependent 
on the roles you have been assigned in Starfish 
and whether or not you have an active 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:47.033
relationship to the student. Four: Act on 
students as a group. Sometimes you’ll want to 
work with students as a group, perhaps within a 

00:02:47.033 --> 00:02:55.033
specific course section, or across all of your 
students who share some criteria.  For example, 
let’s say you want to look at all of your students 

00:02:55.033 --> 00:03:05.000
for whom a flag has been raised for academic 
performance. You can use the primary filters on 
your My Student tab to filter students by role, 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:14.000
course section and term. Then add additional 
filters to limit your list to only those with the 
criteria you are interested in, for example 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:23.033
students who have the active flag. Once you’ve 
filtered the list of students, you can take action
—perhaps raise a flag on them, 

00:03:23.033 --> 00:03:32.033
add a note to their student folders, give them 
kudos for a job well done, or send a message. 
Some staff members may also use features like 

00:03:32.033 --> 00:03:40.066
Success Scores to prioritize follow up among a 
group of student, and assign high priority items 
to the appropriate team member to make sure 

00:03:40.066 --> 00:03:51.033
the issue is resolved in a timely manner.  
Faculty members can also take and report on 
attendance for students in their classes. With 

00:03:51.033 --> 00:03:58.066
the attendance feature you can mark students’ 
presence or absence for each class meeting, 
and then report on that data by student or by 

00:03:58.066 --> 00:04:08.066
course across the term. Five: Communicate with 
a group of students. If you identify a group of 
students that you want to follow up with, you 

00:04:08.066 --> 00:04:16.033
can use the Send Message feature to create a 
single message that can be sent to the students 
you select. For example, you may want to email 

00:04:16.033 --> 00:04:26.033
the students who have an active flag. Select 
your students, click the “Send Message” button, 
draft your message and hit submit.  You can 

00:04:26.033 --> 00:04:34.033
also cc yourself so that you get the message as 
an email as well. A copy of the message will be 
added to the student folder of each student, 

00:04:34.033 --> 00:04:44.066
accessible on the Notes tab.  The students will 
receive your message via email, and a copy will 
be available to them on their Starfish Home page 

00:04:44.066 --> 00:04:55.066
in the messages channel. So that’s a quick 
overview of five things you can do in Starfish 
EARLY ALERT in a little less than five minutes. 

00:04:55.066 --> 00:04:59.066
Login and update your profile to get started.
