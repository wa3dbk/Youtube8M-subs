00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:48.150 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:51.080 

since<00:04:48.949> I'm<00:04:49.949> actually<00:04:50.190> quite<00:04:50.610> good<00:04:50.880> at<00:04:50.970> this

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:51.090 
since I'm actually quite good at this

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:53.090 
since I'm actually quite good at this
level<00:04:51.330> at<00:04:51.570> least<00:04:51.600> back<00:04:51.900> when<00:04:52.080> I<00:04:52.110> was<00:04:52.830> younger

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:53.100 
level at least back when I was younger

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:57.920 
level at least back when I was younger
but<00:04:53.460> I<00:04:55.970> still<00:04:56.970> think<00:04:57.210> I<00:04:57.240> do<00:04:57.300> a<00:04:57.389> fairly<00:04:57.690> good<00:04:57.900> job

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:57.930 
but I still think I do a fairly good job

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:03.020 
but I still think I do a fairly good job
of<00:04:58.110> it<00:05:00.710> it<00:05:01.710> doesn't<00:05:02.070> look<00:05:02.160> that<00:05:02.190> hard<00:05:02.669> but<00:05:03.000> I

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:03.030 
of it it doesn't look that hard but I

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:06.770 
of it it doesn't look that hard but I
guess<00:05:03.419> I<00:05:03.600> can<00:05:03.810> see<00:05:04.169> that<00:05:05.479> where<00:05:06.479> it<00:05:06.630> would<00:05:06.750> be

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:06.780 
guess I can see that where it would be

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:18.260 
guess I can see that where it would be
frustrating<00:05:16.400> why<00:05:17.400> bouncing<00:05:17.790> ahead<00:05:18.030> it<00:05:18.210> will

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:18.270 
frustrating why bouncing ahead it will

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:21.710 
frustrating why bouncing ahead it will
make<00:05:18.449> you<00:05:18.570> let<00:05:18.720> go<00:05:18.900> of<00:05:18.960> the<00:05:19.110> barrel<00:05:20.539> because<00:05:21.539> he

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:21.720 
make you let go of the barrel because he

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:23.090 
make you let go of the barrel because he
has<00:05:21.870> to<00:05:22.020> do<00:05:22.139> his<00:05:22.229> neat<00:05:22.470> little<00:05:22.620> flippy<00:05:23.070> thing

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:23.100 
has to do his neat little flippy thing

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:25.790 
has to do his neat little flippy thing
after<00:05:23.699> he<00:05:23.820> bounces<00:05:24.240> get<00:05:24.960> the<00:05:25.050> horse<00:05:25.260> barrel

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:25.800 
after he bounces get the horse barrel

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:31.010 
after he bounces get the horse barrel

big move putting a clump right on the
platform<00:05:34.169> you<00:05:34.199> have<00:05:34.350> to<00:05:34.590> jump<00:05:34.830> on<00:05:35.120> yeah<00:05:36.289> again

00:05:37.279 --> 00:05:37.289

the reason why don't get Kong is really

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:42.230 
the reason why don't get Kong is really
needed<00:05:40.080> for<00:05:40.110> this<00:05:40.289> level<00:05:40.910> here's<00:05:41.910> a<00:05:42.000> question

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:42.240 
needed for this level here's a question

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:45.529 
needed for this level here's a question
why<00:05:43.020> did<00:05:43.949> the<00:05:43.979> platform's<00:05:44.550> not<00:05:44.820> move<00:05:45.120> until
