00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.719
 wave the 22 

00:00:01.719 --> 00:00:07.290
 with so much technology cantin thousand i anta company everyone wants to bring a 

00:00:07.289 --> 00:00:08.900
 phone to be able to have 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:10.049
 his entire office 

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:11.289
 in the pocket 

00:00:11.289 --> 00:00:15.869
 you know we have a little gadget to answer a lot of that but what is 

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:17.609
 quite unknown 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.210
 it is about 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:22.250
 but the times 95 0 2 d inite 

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:25.310
 in that year it's something different 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:26.509
 atlante within 

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:30.640
 but the business forum that we have created but that you will see a little bit 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:31.759
 later 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:35.820
 that does have one thing in common with all of them and that is that they 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.230
 a big man 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.590
 the anti-medical is a phone that solves with children has not existed that 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:45.430
 makes it compatible with all office applications 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:48.730
 you also very synchronized with your computer 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:52.290
 to be here is the screen the bladder fingers like 8 inches 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:58.400
 the height is tactile because they fear only a few buttons to be able to use it 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.860
 that does not have a lot more buttons take off the screen 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:10.040
 today we find a very complete qwerty keyboard 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.320
 the band already work quite well and as you can see there has been a demand 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.980
 vertical one apparently to allow us to work he is fine 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:19.350
 cation 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.760
 but if your fingers are a bit fat, do not worry 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:24.960
 because it has 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.900
 a style of use with which to work 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.500
 the times 95 0 2 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.190
 have maximum connectivity 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:38.250
 that is yolanda 3koma 5 gb or four band gp the betis 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.170
 also 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:43.870
 luigi unpublished two points 0 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:45.990
 which can be selected 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.300
 in this hundred percent button here 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.390
 directly he carries 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:51.930
 they argue 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.550
 as true as this 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:55.850
 who has everything 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.650
 that's why we send very closely 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:02.250
 ppl a 3 megapixel camera act 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.310
 the other to score there will be no conferences 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.160
 in the front 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:11.420
 but not so far from business that is a simple chair is saved and is that it has 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:16.230
 a composite video output so you can expose two other presentations 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.860
 photographs through the project so you save yourself the laptop 

00:02:21.419 --> 00:02:25.899
 Also not to miss when you go to a meeting incorporates gps 

00:02:26.669 --> 00:02:28.319
 and also has 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:29.879
 one on the moon 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:31.679
 palanquero can put 

00:02:31.679 --> 00:02:36.569
 Nitro's cards The jewel is so pretty hidden under the lid of the 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:37.200
 drums 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.779
 but here we have it 

00:02:38.779 --> 00:02:41.809
 this phone besides being used to talk 

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:46.789
 It is also a multimedia miku team because it produces snows and formats of 

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:49.329
 audio and child 

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:51.350
 one of the things that we liked the most 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:52.099
 is that it has 

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:54.129
 one like ana in economics 

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:57.289
 will be a continuist like you and playing a video game console 

00:02:58.339 --> 00:03:02.119
 this equipment costs 599 euros which is a fairly tight price 

00:03:02.969 --> 00:03:06.059
 what you see on professional phones 

00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:10.069
 and the truth is that we liked it a lot 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:13.909
 so I'm going to keep sending a few months because I have some 

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:15.480
 negotiate out there that one 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:16.689
 has no contacts 

00:03:16.689 --> 00:03:18.049
 see you in the next video
