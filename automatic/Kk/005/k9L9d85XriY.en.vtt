have<00:02:38.730> another<00:02:39.090> how-to<00:02:39.360> video<00:02:39.810> in<00:02:40.110> the

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
have another how-to video in the

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.610 
have another how-to video in the
description<00:02:40.950> that<00:02:41.670> i<00:02:42.390> use<00:02:42.810> the<00:02:43.200> first<00:02:43.440> time<00:02:43.590> i

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
description that i use the first time i

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.539 
description that i use the first time i
do<00:02:43.769> this<00:02:44.720> so<00:02:45.720> this<00:02:45.870> is<00:02:46.019> my<00:02:46.170> second<00:02:46.709> time<00:02:46.980> I've

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:47.549 
do this so this is my second time I've

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:52.930 
do this so this is my second time I've
done<00:02:47.580> this<00:02:48.590> all<00:02:49.590> right<00:02:51.110> I've<00:02:52.110> had<00:02:52.410> no<00:02:52.650> other

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
done this all right I've had no other

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.630 
done this all right I've had no other
splicing<00:02:53.959> instruction<00:02:54.959> before<00:02:55.079> this<00:02:55.640> so

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
splicing instruction before this so

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.729 
splicing instruction before this so
that's<00:02:56.910> through<00:02:57.590> you<00:02:58.590> pull<00:02:59.209> mark<00:03:00.209> a<00:03:00.739> about

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
that's through you pull mark a about

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:04.309 
that's through you pull mark a about
however<00:03:02.640> this<00:03:03.209> is<00:03:03.450> going<00:03:03.630> to<00:03:03.690> be<00:03:03.810> your<00:03:03.930> final

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 
however this is going to be your final

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:06.350 
however this is going to be your final
loop<00:03:04.489> almost<00:03:05.489> it<00:03:05.790> will<00:03:05.940> be<00:03:06.030> a<00:03:06.060> little<00:03:06.239> bit

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
loop almost it will be a little bit

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.819 
loop almost it will be a little bit
bigger<00:03:06.569> so<00:03:08.090> just<00:03:09.090> mark<00:03:09.360> it<00:03:09.480> and<00:03:09.630> then<00:03:10.019> you<00:03:10.650> take

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:10.829 
bigger so just mark it and then you take

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:19.190 
bigger so just mark it and then you take
the<00:03:10.890> other<00:03:11.190> end<00:03:16.069> that<00:03:17.069> goes<00:03:17.310> into<00:03:17.810> the<00:03:18.810> shorter

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
the other end that goes into the shorter

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.430 
the other end that goes into the shorter
hand<00:03:19.380> right<00:03:19.560> here<00:03:20.420> it<00:03:21.420> doesn't<00:03:22.049> matter<00:03:22.139> where

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
hand right here it doesn't matter where

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:27.050 
hand right here it doesn't matter where
you<00:03:22.470> put<00:03:22.709> it<00:03:22.829> in<00:03:25.160> all<00:03:26.160> kind<00:03:26.489> of<00:03:26.549> does<00:03:26.730> you<00:03:26.880> want

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
you put it in all kind of does you want

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:28.430 
you put it in all kind of does you want
it<00:03:27.150> kind<00:03:27.269> of<00:03:27.389> close<00:03:27.569> depending<00:03:27.900> on<00:03:28.139> how<00:03:28.230> big

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
it kind of close depending on how big

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:39.830 
it kind of close depending on how big
you<00:03:28.530> want<00:03:28.620> your<00:03:28.739> loop<00:03:33.680> okay<00:03:34.680> oh<00:03:38.299> my<00:03:39.299> just<00:03:39.359> split

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
you want your loop okay oh my just split

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:53.619 
you want your loop okay oh my just split
of<00:03:39.959> strands<00:03:40.470> so<00:03:40.620> want<00:03:40.799> to<00:03:40.950> redo<00:03:41.250> that<00:03:46.010> yeah

00:03:53.619 --> 00:03:53.629 

00:03:53.629 --> 00:04:02.449 

okay<00:03:54.650> so<00:03:55.970> pull<00:03:56.970> that<00:03:57.180> all<00:03:57.329> the<00:03:57.480> way<00:03:57.599> through<00:04:01.459> as

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
okay so pull that all the way through as

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:06.229 
okay so pull that all the way through as
you<00:04:02.640> can<00:04:02.760> see<00:04:03.000> that's<00:04:03.209> a<00:04:03.360> lot<00:04:03.930> of<00:04:03.959> left<00:04:05.239> nod

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 
you can see that's a lot of left nod

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:08.660 
you can see that's a lot of left nod
rope<00:04:06.480> left<00:04:06.720> so<00:04:06.989> you<00:04:07.049> don't<00:04:07.500> want<00:04:07.739> and<00:04:08.129> the

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 
rope left so you don't want and the

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:11.869 
rope left so you don't want and the
twists<00:04:09.569> in<00:04:09.720> there<00:04:10.129> just<00:04:11.129> want<00:04:11.370> to<00:04:11.459> pull<00:04:11.700> that

00:04:11.869 --> 00:04:11.879 
twists in there just want to pull that

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:17.680 
twists in there just want to pull that
through<00:04:12.299> make<00:04:12.840> sure<00:04:13.019> it's<00:04:13.200> nice<00:04:13.709> and<00:04:13.769> tidy<00:04:14.250> and

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.690 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:21.469 

that<00:04:18.690> is<00:04:18.889> your<00:04:19.889> lock<00:04:20.130> Brahman<00:04:20.579> splice<00:04:20.910> right

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:21.479 
that is your lock Brahman splice right

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:23.360 
that is your lock Brahman splice right
there<00:04:21.690> and<00:04:21.900> then<00:04:22.710> you<00:04:22.830> just<00:04:22.979> want<00:04:23.190> to<00:04:23.250> bury

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
there and then you just want to bury

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:28.250 
there and then you just want to bury
this<00:04:23.669> I<00:04:26.660> probably<00:04:27.660> could<00:04:27.930> have<00:04:27.960> made<00:04:28.139> this

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:28.260 
this I probably could have made this

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:29.900 
this I probably could have made this
little<00:04:28.470> shorter<00:04:28.860> if<00:04:29.160> I<00:04:29.250> wanted<00:04:29.490> to<00:04:29.550> I<00:04:29.669> could

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:29.910 
little shorter if I wanted to I could

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:31.659 
little shorter if I wanted to I could
just<00:04:30.090> cut<00:04:30.240> off<00:04:30.449> but<00:04:30.630> I<00:04:30.690> don't<00:04:30.870> care<00:04:31.260> that<00:04:31.320> much

00:04:31.659 --> 00:04:31.669 
just cut off but I don't care that much

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:37.270 
just cut off but I don't care that much
so<00:04:32.669> we<00:04:33.000> go<00:04:33.210> ahead<00:04:33.240> and<00:04:34.789> the<00:04:35.810> measurement<00:04:36.810> is

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:37.280 
so we go ahead and the measurement is

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.950 
so we go ahead and the measurement is
one<00:04:38.280> and<00:04:38.430> a<00:04:38.490> half<00:04:38.520> lengths<00:04:39.300> of<00:04:39.449> the<00:04:39.570> free<00:04:39.780> end

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960 
one and a half lengths of the free end

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:43.610 
one and a half lengths of the free end
so<00:04:40.260> I<00:04:40.289> could<00:04:40.530> go<00:04:40.680> down<00:04:40.889> to<00:04:41.130> here<00:04:41.600> I'm<00:04:42.600> not<00:04:42.840> if

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620 
so I could go down to here I'm not if

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.129 
so I could go down to here I'm not if
you<00:04:44.580> want<00:04:44.789> to<00:04:44.880> market<00:04:45.000> go<00:04:45.300> ahead<00:04:45.510> I<00:04:45.720> don't<00:04:45.900> I

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:46.139 
you want to market go ahead I don't I

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:54.439 
you want to market go ahead I don't I
didn't<00:04:46.889> and<00:04:47.190> I'm<00:04:47.460> not<00:04:47.910> going<00:04:48.180> to<00:04:48.300> now<00:04:50.960> so<00:04:53.449> you

00:04:54.439 --> 00:04:54.449 
didn't and I'm not going to now so you

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:59.570 
didn't and I'm not going to now so you
want<00:04:54.690> this<00:04:55.050> as<00:04:55.470> close<00:04:57.560> to<00:04:58.560> your<00:04:58.830> spot<00:04:59.280> as<00:04:59.460> you

00:04:59.570 --> 00:04:59.580 
want this as close to your spot as you

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:03.260 
want this as close to your spot as you
can<00:04:59.930> unfortunately<00:05:01.970> because<00:05:02.970> I<00:05:03.060> don't<00:05:03.240> have

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:03.270 
can unfortunately because I don't have

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:06.920 
can unfortunately because I don't have
that<00:05:03.539> much<00:05:03.660> free<00:05:03.870> end<00:05:04.110> I<00:05:05.210> have<00:05:06.210> just<00:05:06.630> enough

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:06.930 
that much free end I have just enough

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:10.969 
that much free end I have just enough
actually<00:05:09.080> well<00:05:10.080> what<00:05:10.199> you<00:05:10.320> can<00:05:10.440> do<00:05:10.560> is<00:05:10.770> you<00:05:10.949> can

00:05:10.969 --> 00:05:10.979 
actually well what you can do is you can

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:13.279 
actually well what you can do is you can
just<00:05:11.340> take<00:05:11.970> it<00:05:12.090> out<00:05:12.210> and<00:05:12.479> thought<00:05:12.960> about<00:05:13.169> this

00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:13.289 
just take it out and thought about this

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:17.950 
just take it out and thought about this
and<00:05:13.520> you're<00:05:14.520> placing<00:05:15.090> it<00:05:16.550> close<00:05:17.550> to<00:05:17.580> the

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:17.960 
and you're placing it close to the

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:26.960 
and you're placing it close to the
splice<00:05:18.960> and<00:05:20.449> then<00:05:22.880> feeding<00:05:23.880> it<00:05:25.250> just<00:05:26.250> putting

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:26.970 
splice and then feeding it just putting

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:29.210 
splice and then feeding it just putting
it<00:05:27.090> through<00:05:27.330> now<00:05:27.720> if<00:05:28.680> you<00:05:28.800> don't<00:05:28.949> have<00:05:29.190> a

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:29.220 
it through now if you don't have a

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:33.589 
it through now if you don't have a
retractable<00:05:30.320> ink<00:05:31.320> cartridge<00:05:32.150> you<00:05:33.150> can<00:05:33.419> use

00:05:33.589 --> 00:05:33.599 
retractable ink cartridge you can use

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:38.750 
retractable ink cartridge you can use
guitar<00:05:34.050> string<00:05:34.409> or<00:05:34.789> very<00:05:35.789> thin<00:05:36.150> wire<00:05:36.419> and<00:05:37.760> do

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:38.760 
guitar string or very thin wire and do

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:39.830 
guitar string or very thin wire and do
this<00:05:38.909> instead<00:05:39.210> of<00:05:39.270> pushing<00:05:39.539> it<00:05:39.810> through

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:39.840 
this instead of pushing it through

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:43.279 
this instead of pushing it through
pulling<00:05:40.680> it<00:05:40.770> through<00:05:41.510> there's<00:05:42.510> a<00:05:42.630> video<00:05:43.110> on

00:05:43.279 --> 00:05:43.289 
pulling it through there's a video on

00:05:43.289 --> 00:05:47.110 
pulling it through there's a video on
youtube<00:05:43.320> called<00:05:43.909> will<00:05:44.909> be<00:05:45.030> saline<00:05:45.210> conversion

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:47.120
