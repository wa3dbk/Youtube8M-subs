00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
or a square format and they were looking

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.479 
or a square format and they were looking
a<00:02:06.270> little<00:02:06.420> bit<00:02:06.600> smoother<00:02:07.049> and<00:02:07.200> crisper<00:02:07.560> and<00:02:08.129> if

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
a little bit smoother and crisper and if

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.339 
a little bit smoother and crisper and if

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
we go into a few of the apps you'll see

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:11.900 
we go into a few of the apps you'll see
that<00:02:10.560> LZ<00:02:10.920> is<00:02:10.950> gone<00:02:11.129> for<00:02:11.340> this<00:02:11.400> sort<00:02:11.610> of<00:02:11.670> color

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
that LZ is gone for this sort of color

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:12.830 
that LZ is gone for this sort of color
coding<00:02:12.270> thing

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
coding thing

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.570 
coding thing
or<00:02:12.930> I<00:02:12.959> think<00:02:13.260> they<00:02:13.500> called<00:02:13.739> it<00:02:13.860> better<00:02:14.099> task

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
or I think they called it better task

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.680 
or I think they called it better task
awareness<00:02:16.099> but<00:02:17.099> there's<00:02:17.400> not<00:02:18.060> too<00:02:18.300> much<00:02:18.480> in

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
awareness but there's not too much in

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.509 
awareness but there's not too much in
the<00:02:18.750> way<00:02:18.780> of<00:02:18.900> crazy<00:02:19.620> bright<00:02:19.860> colors<00:02:20.220> they<00:02:20.340> said

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:20.519 
the way of crazy bright colors they said

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:23.380 
the way of crazy bright colors they said
they've<00:02:20.640> gone<00:02:20.790> for<00:02:21.090> a<00:02:21.120> more<00:02:21.690> mature<00:02:21.989> palate

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
they've gone for a more mature palate

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.570 
they've gone for a more mature palate
the<00:02:24.390> camera<00:02:24.840> icon<00:02:25.170> looks<00:02:25.560> like<00:02:25.650> a<00:02:25.830> laundry

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
the camera icon looks like a laundry

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:32.780 
the camera icon looks like a laundry
machine<00:02:26.840> in<00:02:27.980> my<00:02:28.980> opinion<00:02:29.190> and<00:02:31.430> as<00:02:32.430> more<00:02:32.610> of<00:02:32.730> the

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
machine in my opinion and as more of the

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.339 
machine in my opinion and as more of the
color<00:02:32.940> coding<00:02:33.269> and<00:02:33.450> this<00:02:33.660> is<00:02:33.750> obviously<00:02:33.900> a

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:34.349 
color coding and this is obviously a

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:36.559 
color coding and this is obviously a
pre-production<00:02:34.980> Korean<00:02:35.580> version<00:02:36.090> so<00:02:36.450> it's

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569 
pre-production Korean version so it's

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:38.809 
pre-production Korean version so it's
not<00:02:36.690> a<00:02:36.930> final<00:02:37.530> international<00:02:38.489> version<00:02:38.730> or

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819 
not a final international version or

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:41.869 
not a final international version or
anything<00:02:39.060> like<00:02:39.090> that<00:02:39.769> LG<00:02:40.769> has<00:02:40.890> also<00:02:41.010> gone<00:02:41.310> for

00:02:41.869 --> 00:02:41.879 
anything like that LG has also gone for

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:44.360 
anything like that LG has also gone for
a<00:02:42.269> new<00:02:43.170> feature<00:02:43.410> which<00:02:43.680> they're<00:02:43.890> calling

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
a new feature which they're calling

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.330 
a new feature which they're calling
smart<00:02:45.120> bulletin<00:02:45.480> so<00:02:46.019> basically<00:02:46.530> LG<00:02:46.950> health<00:02:47.160> is

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
smart bulletin so basically LG health is

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.670 
smart bulletin so basically LG health is
a<00:02:47.790> permanent<00:02:48.450> fixture<00:02:48.750> like<00:02:49.200> we've<00:02:49.380> seen<00:02:49.410> in

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
a permanent fixture like we've seen in

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.229 
a permanent fixture like we've seen in
