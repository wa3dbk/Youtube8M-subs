definitely<00:00:55.770> I<00:00:56.190> think<00:00:56.340> shooting<00:00:57.090> quick

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
definitely I think shooting quick

definitely I think shooting quick
definitely<00:00:58.410> is<00:00:58.559> a<00:00:58.590> plus<00:00:59.129> to<00:00:59.430> be<00:00:59.550> honest<00:00:59.879> with

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
definitely is a plus to be honest with

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.240 
definitely is a plus to be honest with
you<00:01:00.059> actually<00:01:00.780> you<00:01:00.899> don't<00:01:01.170> get<00:01:01.410> an<00:01:01.559> arrow<00:01:01.859> for

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
you actually you don't get an arrow for

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.609 
you actually you don't get an arrow for
six<00:01:02.579> or<00:01:02.789> seven<00:01:03.270> you<00:01:03.629> only<00:01:03.870> start<00:01:04.229> getting<00:01:04.530> an

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
six or seven you only start getting an

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.740 
six or seven you only start getting an
arrow<00:01:04.830> once<00:01:05.129> you<00:01:05.280> get<00:01:05.460> eight<00:01:05.700> or<00:01:05.939> higher<00:01:06.180> I

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
arrow once you get eight or higher I

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.219
