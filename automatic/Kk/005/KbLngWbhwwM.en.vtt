00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
and teaching it to me you may look at

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.700 
and teaching it to me you may look at
what<00:00:25.920> I<00:00:25.949> doing<00:00:26.430> and<00:00:26.580> say<00:00:26.760> that<00:00:27.420> is<00:00:27.570> way<00:00:28.019> too

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
what I doing and say that is way too

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
tricks you do see well I didn't but you

tricks you do see well I didn't but you
did<00:01:04.939> upside<00:01:05.939> down<00:01:06.210> box<00:01:06.540> is<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:06.900> same<00:01:07.200> pattern

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
did upside down box is the same pattern

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.010 
did upside down box is the same pattern
in<00:01:07.830> size<00:01:08.040> office<00:01:08.520> what<00:01:08.700> I'm<00:01:08.820> doing<00:01:09.210> now<00:01:09.420> which

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
in size office what I'm doing now which

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.200 
in size office what I'm doing now which
is<00:01:10.200> normal<00:01:10.680> box<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.610> only<00:01:11.909> difference

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
is normal box the only difference

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.060 
is normal box the only difference
between<00:01:12.360> them<00:01:12.720> is<00:01:12.780> that<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.320> 2x<00:01:13.710> is<00:01:13.890> thrown

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
between them is that the 2x is thrown

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.240 
between them is that the 2x is thrown
below<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.610> 4<00:01:14.820> is<00:01:14.939> in<00:01:14.970> normal<00:01:15.450> box<00:01:16.250> while

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
below the 4 is in normal box while

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.520 
below the 4 is in normal box while
upside<00:01:17.700> down<00:01:17.970> box<00:01:18.270> has<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:18.750> 2x<00:01:19.110> throne<00:01:19.380> above

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
upside down box has the 2x throne above

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:26.039 
upside down box has the 2x throne above
the<00:01:19.710> fours<00:01:20.159> like<00:01:20.640> this

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:26.049 

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:28.469 

starting<00:01:26.829> from<00:01:26.979> his<00:01:27.130> most<00:01:27.340> basic<00:01:27.850> elements<00:01:28.359> in

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:28.479 
starting from his most basic elements in

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:30.660 
starting from his most basic elements in
building<00:01:28.810> it<00:01:28.929> up<00:01:29.049> there<00:01:29.619> are<00:01:29.770> three<00:01:30.070> exercises

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670 
building it up there are three exercises

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:32.819 
building it up there are three exercises
to<00:01:31.030> learn<00:01:31.210> before<00:01:31.450> trying<00:01:31.929> the<00:01:32.079> actual<00:01:32.530> trick

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:32.829 
to learn before trying the actual trick

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:35.399 
to learn before trying the actual trick
first<00:01:33.729> you<00:01:34.119> have<00:01:34.299> to<00:01:34.329> have<00:01:34.539> a<00:01:34.570> perfect<00:01:35.170> normal

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:35.409 
first you have to have a perfect normal

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:38.459 
first you have to have a perfect normal
box<00:01:36.000> one<00:01:37.000> that<00:01:37.149> is<00:01:37.270> perfectly<00:01:37.750> even<00:01:38.020> on<00:01:38.320> all

00:01:38.459 --> 00:01:38.469 
box one that is perfectly even on all

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:41.190 
box one that is perfectly even on all
sides<00:01:39.149> many<00:01:40.149> people<00:01:40.509> have<00:01:40.630> trouble<00:01:40.869> keeping

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:41.200 
sides many people have trouble keeping

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.039 
sides many people have trouble keeping
their<00:01:41.560> two<00:01:42.130> exes<00:01:42.490> going<00:01:42.759> straight<00:01:43.090> across<00:01:43.210> by

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:44.049 
their two exes going straight across by

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:48.419 
their two exes going straight across by
throwing<00:01:44.289> them<00:01:44.469> like<00:01:44.649> this<00:01:47.159> one<00:01:48.159> tip<00:01:48.399> for

00:01:48.419 --> 00:01:48.429 
throwing them like this one tip for

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:50.580 
throwing them like this one tip for
correcting<00:01:49.060> this<00:01:49.179> bad<00:01:49.420> habit<00:01:49.659> is<00:01:49.990> to<00:01:50.319> learn

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
correcting this bad habit is to learn

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.830 
correcting this bad habit is to learn
the<00:01:50.649> three-ball<00:01:51.189> shower<00:01:51.490> in<00:01:51.819> both<00:01:52.390> directions

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840 
the three-ball shower in both directions

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.620 
the three-ball shower in both directions
well<00:01:53.829> enough<00:01:54.100> that<00:01:54.280> people<00:01:54.459> can't<00:01:54.819> tell<00:01:55.060> which

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
well enough that people can't tell which

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:03.990 
well enough that people can't tell which
is<00:01:55.659> your<00:01:55.929> dominant<00:01:56.170> direction<00:02:02.579> after<00:02:03.579> you

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.000 
is your dominant direction after you

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.179 
is your dominant direction after you
have<00:02:04.119> perfected<00:02:04.720> your<00:02:05.049> normal<00:02:05.409> box<00:02:05.709> you<00:02:06.159> are

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:06.189 
have perfected your normal box you are

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:08.279 
have perfected your normal box you are
ready<00:02:06.489> to<00:02:06.670> move<00:02:06.849> on<00:02:07.030> to<00:02:07.090> the<00:02:07.360> second<00:02:07.780> exercise

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289 
ready to move on to the second exercise

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:11.580 
ready to move on to the second exercise
for<00:02:08.649> upside-down<00:02:09.069> box<00:02:09.700> this<00:02:10.479> exercise<00:02:11.110> only

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
for upside-down box this exercise only

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.490 
for upside-down box this exercise only
involves<00:02:12.069> two<00:02:12.340> balls<00:02:12.610> and<00:02:13.030> it<00:02:13.750> is<00:02:13.900> much<00:02:14.260> like

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
involves two balls and it is much like

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.050 
involves two balls and it is much like
the<00:02:14.530> exchange<00:02:15.190> that<00:02:15.489> you<00:02:15.640> learned<00:02:15.849> when

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
the exchange that you learned when

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.390 
the exchange that you learned when
learning<00:02:16.239> the<00:02:16.540> Cascade<00:02:17.140> this<00:02:17.860> is<00:02:18.069> what<00:02:18.250> it

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
learning the Cascade this is what it

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:26.290 
learning the Cascade this is what it
looks<00:02:18.610> like

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.010 
a sideways qua light catch this claw
light<00:02:55.400> catch<00:02:55.670> is<00:02:55.880> important<00:02:56.390> because<00:02:56.660> if<00:02:56.900> you

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:57.020 
light catch is important because if you

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:58.840 
light catch is important because if you
do<00:02:57.170> not<00:02:57.200> do<00:02:57.500> this<00:02:57.680> you<00:02:57.950> will<00:02:58.340> end<00:02:58.520> up<00:02:58.640> with<00:02:58.700> a

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:58.850 
do not do this you will end up with a

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:02.850 
do not do this you will end up with a

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860 
very arched upside-down box like this

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.410 
very arched upside-down box like this
practice<00:03:03.860> it<00:03:04.010> with<00:03:04.130> both<00:03:04.370> hands<00:03:04.850> and<00:03:05.000> when<00:03:05.330> you

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
practice it with both hands and when you

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.450 
practice it with both hands and when you
have<00:03:05.600> this<00:03:05.750> down<00:03:06.050> then<00:03:06.650> you<00:03:06.830> can<00:03:06.980> start<00:03:07.190> on<00:03:07.370> the
