pretty<00:00:26.550> much<00:00:26.640> the<00:00:26.789> only<00:00:26.820> person<00:00:27.240> that<00:00:27.330> ever

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
pretty much the only person that ever

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.480 
pretty much the only person that ever
uses<00:00:27.750> that<00:00:27.840> in<00:00:27.960> black<00:00:28.140> ops<00:00:28.260> 2<00:00:28.349> so<00:00:28.740> if<00:00:28.980> you<00:00:29.279> see

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
uses that in black ops 2 so if you see

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.659 
uses that in black ops 2 so if you see
that<00:00:29.699> is<00:00:29.939> a<00:00:30.000> very<00:00:30.510> very<00:00:30.720> good<00:00:30.929> chance<00:00:31.140> as<00:00:31.349> me<00:00:31.710> my

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
master of course we played for about 13

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.950 
master of course we played for about 13
days<00:00:38.000> we've<00:00:39.000> had<00:00:39.739> 62.6<00:00:40.739> k<00:00:41.100> kills<00:00:41.430> know<00:00:41.960> that's

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
days we've had 62.6 k kills know that's

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.160 
days we've had 62.6 k kills know that's
what<00:00:43.079> she<00:00:43.110> quite<00:00:43.350> a<00:00:43.379> lot<00:00:43.590> like<00:00:44.070> I<00:00:45.110> didn't<00:00:46.110> even

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
what she quite a lot like I didn't even

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.529 
what she quite a lot like I didn't even
realize<00:00:46.469> I<00:00:46.860> had<00:00:47.340> that<00:00:47.489> many<00:00:47.670> kills<00:00:47.940> I<00:00:48.180> thought

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
realize I had that many kills I thought

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.720 
realize I had that many kills I thought
it<00:00:48.629> had<00:00:48.750> a<00:00:48.780> lot<00:00:49.020> i<00:00:49.050> was<00:00:49.559> around<00:00:49.739> 50k<00:00:50.250> but<00:00:50.460> yeah

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
it had a lot i was around 50k but yeah

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.160 
it had a lot i was around 50k but yeah
obviously<00:00:50.940> i've<00:00:51.270> left<00:00:51.510> school<00:00:51.750> some<00:00:51.930> pinball

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
obviously i've left school some pinball

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.130 
obviously i've left school some pinball
so<00:00:52.500> just<00:00:52.949> kind<00:00:53.129> of<00:00:53.160> make<00:00:53.309> sense<00:00:53.340> I<00:00:53.899> KD<00:00:54.899> ratio

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
so just kind of make sense I KD ratio

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.560 
so just kind of make sense I KD ratio
actually<00:00:55.829> hasn't<00:00:56.010> moved<00:00:56.340> for<00:00:56.670> probably<00:00:57.420> about

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
actually hasn't moved for probably about

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.170 
actually hasn't moved for probably about
five<00:00:57.989> months<00:00:58.260> cell<00:00:58.590> but<00:00:59.579> it<00:00:59.699> just<00:00:59.879> literally

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
five months cell but it just literally

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.939 
five months cell but it just literally
won't<00:01:00.420> budge<00:01:00.660> I've<00:01:00.899> been<00:01:01.109> trying<00:01:01.500> to<00:01:01.590> make<00:01:01.770> it

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
won't budge I've been trying to make it

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.179 
won't budge I've been trying to make it
go<00:01:02.070> up<00:01:02.100> to<00:01:02.309> like<00:01:02.399> a<00:01:02.460> 2<00:01:02.730> KD<00:01:03.000> even<00:01:03.930> a<00:01:03.989> 1.8<00:01:04.500> KD<00:01:04.949> and

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
go up to like a 2 KD even a 1.8 KD and

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:06.800 
go up to like a 2 KD even a 1.8 KD and
it<00:01:05.549> literally<00:01:05.880> doesn't<00:01:06.090> move<00:01:06.270> I<00:01:06.420> can<00:01:06.540> get<00:01:06.659> more

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
it literally doesn't move I can get more

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.050 
it literally doesn't move I can get more
depth<00:01:07.140> i<00:01:07.290> can<00:01:07.439> get<00:01:07.560> you<00:01:08.070> know<00:01:08.159> more<00:01:08.369> kills<00:01:08.700> and

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
depth i can get you know more kills and

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.170 
depth i can get you know more kills and
it<00:01:09.150> just<00:01:09.299> doesn't<00:01:09.810> move<00:01:09.900> tool<00:01:10.229> so<00:01:10.820> 1.79<00:01:11.820> KD

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
it just doesn't move tool so 1.79 KD

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.010 
it just doesn't move tool so 1.79 KD
we've<00:01:13.049> got<00:01:13.229> 1.4<00:01:13.830> k<00:01:14.070> wins<00:01:14.340> a<00:01:14.580> 0.45<00:01:15.299> win-loss

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
we've got 1.4 k wins a 0.45 win-loss

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.080 
we've got 1.4 k wins a 0.45 win-loss
ratio<00:01:16.470> that's<00:01:17.130> actually<00:01:17.460> gone<00:01:17.610> up<00:01:17.640> which<00:01:17.970> is

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
ratio that's actually gone up which is

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.960 
ratio that's actually gone up which is
kind<00:01:18.270> of<00:01:18.330> surprising<00:01:18.420> since<00:01:18.960> my<00:01:19.110> last<00:01:19.229> video<00:01:19.470> i

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:19.970 
kind of surprising since my last video i

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.520 
kind of surprising since my last video i
wasn't<00:01:20.970> expected<00:01:21.360> it<00:01:21.450> to<00:01:21.630> I<00:01:21.840> really<00:01:22.320> wasn't

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
wasn't expected it to I really wasn't

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.120 
wasn't expected it to I really wasn't
but<00:01:22.890> it<00:01:23.600> just<00:01:24.600> uh<00:01:24.750> yeah<00:01:25.650> it's<00:01:25.740> just<00:01:25.890> it's<00:01:26.100> just

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
but it just uh yeah it's just it's just

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.550 
but it just uh yeah it's just it's just
gone<00:01:26.400> up<00:01:26.430> I<00:01:26.780> think<00:01:27.780> I<00:01:27.840> actually<00:01:27.960> leave<00:01:28.259> more

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
gone up I think I actually leave more

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.010 
gone up I think I actually leave more
games<00:01:28.860> then<00:01:29.520> I<00:01:29.549> stay<00:01:30.000> in<00:01:30.150> now<00:01:30.299> but<00:01:30.509> it<00:01:30.659> keeps

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
games then I stay in now but it keeps

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.539 
games then I stay in now but it keeps
going<00:01:31.200> up<00:01:31.350> it's<00:01:31.500> cool<00:01:31.619> it's<00:01:31.770> kind<00:01:31.979> of<00:01:32.009> kind<00:01:32.430> of

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
going up it's cool it's kind of kind of

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.630 
going up it's cool it's kind of kind of
strange<00:01:32.820> a<00:01:33.500> 7.6<00:01:34.500> million<00:01:34.950> score<00:01:35.460> that's

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
strange a 7.6 million score that's

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.359 
strange a 7.6 million score that's
pretty<00:01:35.880> decent<00:01:36.329> a<00:01:36.479> 412<00:01:37.380> scope<00:01:37.650> minute<00:01:38.009> a<00:01:38.040> scope

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
pretty decent a 412 scope minute a scope

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.219 
pretty decent a 412 scope minute a scope
and<00:01:38.579> it<00:01:38.670> has<00:01:38.909> risen<00:01:39.150> i'm<00:01:39.390> pretty<00:01:39.689> sure<00:01:39.900> since

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
and it has risen i'm pretty sure since

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.910 
and it has risen i'm pretty sure since
the<00:01:40.380> last<00:01:40.619> video<00:01:40.979> i<00:01:41.280> think<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.210> last<00:01:42.360> one<00:01:42.479> was

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
the last video i think the last one was

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.920 
the last video i think the last one was
407<00:01:43.920> so<00:01:44.850> we've<00:01:44.970> gone<00:01:45.090> up<00:01:45.180> about<00:01:45.299> five<00:01:45.630> score

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
407 so we've gone up about five score

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:46.969 
407 so we've gone up about five score
per<00:01:45.990> minute<00:01:46.200> which<00:01:46.290> doesn't<00:01:46.590> seem<00:01:46.710> like<00:01:46.860> a<00:01:46.890> lot

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
per minute which doesn't seem like a lot

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.670 
per minute which doesn't seem like a lot
and<00:01:47.700> it<00:01:47.850> in<00:01:48.180> a<00:01:48.270> way<00:01:48.390> it<00:01:48.600> really<00:01:48.780> isn't<00:01:49.140> but<00:01:49.170> when

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
and it in a way it really isn't but when

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.230 
and it in a way it really isn't but when
you<00:01:49.799> are<00:01:49.829> like<00:01:50.130> pressies<00:01:50.579> master<00:01:50.909> you<00:01:51.060> paid

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
you are like pressies master you paid

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.870 
you are like pressies master you paid
like<00:01:51.420> 13<00:01:51.810> days<00:01:51.990> your<00:01:52.560> stats<00:01:52.829> do<00:01:53.130> take<00:01:53.430> a<00:01:53.610> hell

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
like 13 days your stats do take a hell

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.460 
like 13 days your stats do take a hell
of<00:01:53.909> a<00:01:54.030> long<00:01:54.180> time<00:01:54.420> to<00:01:54.450> change<00:01:54.840> and<00:01:55.079> to<00:01:55.110> update

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
of a long time to change and to update

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.450 
of a long time to change and to update
and<00:01:55.619> stuff<00:01:55.860> so<00:01:56.930> you<00:01:57.930> know<00:01:57.960> if<00:01:58.920> you<00:01:59.159> if<00:01:59.189> you

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
and stuff so you know if you if you

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.999 
and stuff so you know if you if you
start<00:01:59.729> off<00:01:59.790> with<00:01:59.939> a<00:02:00.000> bad<00:02:00.180> KD<00:02:00.600> your<00:02:01.170> KD<00:02:01.590> isn't

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
start off with a bad KD your KD isn't

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.200 
start off with a bad KD your KD isn't
really<00:02:02.340> going<00:02:02.430> to<00:02:02.520> get<00:02:02.640> that<00:02:02.729> you<00:02:02.880> can<00:02:03.030> play

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
really going to get that you can play

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.969 
really going to get that you can play
better<00:02:03.390> but<00:02:03.990> you<00:02:04.079> kds<00:02:04.469> pretty<00:02:04.710> much<00:02:04.799> going<00:02:04.920> to

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
better but you kds pretty much going to

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.800 
better but you kds pretty much going to
stay<00:02:05.130> the<00:02:05.189> same<00:02:05.430> because<00:02:05.729> obviously<00:02:05.939> your

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
stay the same because obviously your

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.570 
stay the same because obviously your
kills<00:02:07.079> and<00:02:07.290> deaths<00:02:07.469> just<00:02:08.099> they're<00:02:08.429> really

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
kills and deaths just they're really

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:09.820 
kills and deaths just they're really
change<00:02:08.849> too<00:02:09.030> often

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
change too often

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.030

i think the pw may have got nerfed like

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.390 
i think the pw may have got nerfed like
other<00:03:39.360> maybe<00:03:39.780> a<00:03:39.870> month<00:03:39.989> or<00:03:40.170> so<00:03:40.320> ago<00:03:40.350> because<00:03:41.280> we

bullets<00:03:44.850> in<00:03:45.120> just<00:03:45.329> a<00:03:45.420> standard<00:03:45.780> magazine<00:03:45.930> you

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
bullets in just a standard magazine you

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:48.410 
bullets in just a standard magazine you
could<00:03:46.530> take<00:03:47.370> out<00:03:47.519> people<00:03:47.850> really<00:03:48.060> easily<00:03:48.209> and

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
could take out people really easily and

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:49.699 
could take out people really easily and
it<00:03:48.570> was<00:03:48.690> really<00:03:48.870> good<00:03:49.049> for<00:03:49.230> getting<00:03:49.290> Pheebs

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
it was really good for getting Pheebs

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:52.550 
it was really good for getting Pheebs
and<00:03:50.100> plainly<00:03:51.060> objective<00:03:51.600> but<00:03:52.200> now<00:03:52.380> it<00:03:52.530> seems

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
and plainly objective but now it seems

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.470 
and plainly objective but now it seems
really<00:03:52.860> weak<00:03:53.250> it<00:03:53.519> seems<00:03:53.760> that<00:03:54.030> there's<00:03:54.329> a<00:03:54.360> lot

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
really weak it seems that there's a lot

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.420 
really weak it seems that there's a lot
of<00:03:54.510> recoil<00:03:54.780> and<00:03:55.140> stuff<00:03:55.380> I<00:03:55.470> just<00:03:55.920> can't<00:03:56.100> use<00:03:56.250> out

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
of recoil and stuff I just can't use out

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.580 
of recoil and stuff I just can't use out
use<00:03:56.700> it<00:03:56.880> in<00:03:56.940> a<00:03:56.970> few<00:03:57.150> minutes<00:03:57.329> now<00:03:57.570> just<00:03:58.410> peel<00:03:58.560> it

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
use it in a few minutes now just peel it

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:01.039 
use it in a few minutes now just peel it
for<00:03:58.680> that<00:03:58.769> reason<00:03:58.829> the<00:03:59.720> equipment<00:04:00.720> hasn't

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:01.049 
for that reason the equipment hasn't

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:02.509 
for that reason the equipment hasn't
changed<00:04:01.320> too<00:04:01.350> much<00:04:01.470> you<00:04:01.860> can<00:04:02.010> see<00:04:02.160> it<00:04:02.280> going

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:02.519 
changed too much you can see it going

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:05.180 
changed too much you can see it going
down<00:04:02.549> slowly<00:04:03.709> scorestreaks<00:04:04.709> you<00:04:04.920> know<00:04:05.010> we<00:04:05.160> got

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190 
down slowly scorestreaks you know we got

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:08.690 
down slowly scorestreaks you know we got
almost<00:04:05.670> five<00:04:05.880> min<00:04:06.000> to<00:04:06.060> vsat<00:04:06.510> our<00:04:07.320> swarms<00:04:08.100> we've

had 115 swarms 1045 kills so for every

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:14.060 
had 115 swarms 1045 kills so for every
swarm<00:04:12.690> you<00:04:12.840> get<00:04:12.989> less<00:04:13.260> than<00:04:13.470> 10<00:04:13.650> kills<00:04:13.890> you

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
know for a 19 good streak to me that

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:18.680 
know for a 19 good streak to me that
just<00:04:17.370> doesn't<00:04:17.700> seem<00:04:17.910> worth<00:04:17.970> it<00:04:18.390> you<00:04:18.539> know<00:04:18.660> I

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690

just doesn't seem worth it you know I
much<00:04:19.440> more<00:04:19.650> rather<00:04:19.830> use

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:20.630 
much more rather use

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:22.780

the<00:04:23.030> lightning<00:04:23.780> strike<00:04:24.080> then<00:04:25.040> use<00:04:25.250> the

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:25.580 
the lightning strike then use the

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:28.330 
the lightning strike then use the
