00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:55.750
 Now we're going to show you how we're doing 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:58.780
 to go putting all a retract me to 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:00.700
 put it in the oven and it was super recipe 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.399

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:05.670
 theoretical taste and we continue with different 

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:05.670
 Steps 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.250

 I'm going to get done here and I have my 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:26.610
 more suicidal and this sauce has to 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.640
 be a bit more salty than normal 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:32.369
 I think it's going to be put in the oven there 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.140
 the refectory and then in the love that 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.880
