00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:12.290
 good and welcome to the tasting channel 

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:14.990
 crocker here we are on the pvd server 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:17.210
 league of legends and as always tried 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:20.120
 bring the news as fast 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:25.340
 possible here we have the clock 

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:29.690
 get to see how cool what aspect 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:32.870
 has now more what we see truth is 

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:35.330
 that is very cool the change that they have 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:38.630
 done in the skills set now 

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:40.790
 it already seems that a human person turns 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:43.310
 in common when we activate now 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:46.130
 we will see in action the escudito as it is 

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:48.780
 It puts plated the armor 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:51.270
 and the last one now we see it 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.650
 good, we start with the q 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.850
 there we see it 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:56.850
 with the escudito 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.160
 what has to happen just a 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:04.350
 helicopter at home 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.350
 and finally the ultimate 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:09.150
 we will remove the cv again and there what 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.020
 we have 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.020
 death too 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:38.530
 the animations are the following there 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:41.200
 we have it fixos the animations there 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:43.990
 doing push-ups with one hand 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:48.600
 this situation of pine in man 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:48.600
 the honor in your death to this 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:55.149
 there to leave and there you have it taken is it 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.149
 Take it, give it to him 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:01.229
 and last good laugh now we're going to 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.869
 see the aspects that have also 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.869
 received changes 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:09.090
 here we have draw in bloodthirsty 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:12.209
 fixes have also modified all the 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:14.099
 aspects visually this is the effect 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:17.129
 of the shield for example that changes the 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:19.200
 epaulettes and body to challenge the 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:22.340
 armor 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:26.280
 the e is still the same 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:29.640
 and the same thing we're going to try 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.080
 the skills with a champion we hope 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.650
 the q 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:36.340
 we have 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.340
 shield 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.730
 whirlwind 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.780
 and finally the ultimate 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:54.170
 let's see the following aspect 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:56.930
 here we have a garen command to look at 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:03:00.319
 the skills are identical lawn the 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:04.040
 only change there is the w let's see 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:06.290
 the w how it changes in silver color the 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:09.349
 shoulder pads is the only other change 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:12.319
 skills are identical does not change anything 

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:16.909
 even karen's way of running with 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:17.930
 q all the animations more identical 

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:20.269
 of the same 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:23.329
 therefore let's see the next 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:26.840
 It looks now the turn of Garen 

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:29.030
 knight of terror as I told you the 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:34.480
 skills do not change anything other than the w 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:34.480
 that gives you that silver tone 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:38.150
 everything remains the same 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.820
 and let's look at the following aspect 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.820
 it's the turn of garen type hard to fix 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:54.300
 this is also very cool the truth and 

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:57.420
 as always the w changes nothing more 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:04:00.210
 everything has the same animation the w that 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:03.470
 change the shadows of the champion let's 

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:03.470
 see him from behind for example 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:09.390
 and see what stability leaves a 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:12.240
 dust trail there we have the 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:14.990
 truth is that they have noticed everything 

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:18.330
 and well let's move on with the following aspect 

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:21.300
 well and finally we have to give in 

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:24.210
 legion of steel the truth that is the 

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:27.060
 I like looking at fijaros 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:29.550
 move the shoulder pads and in this if we have 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:31.920
 changes in skills for example 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:34.980
 well the cv simply gives a tone 

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:36.460
 bluish and kind of electricity in the 

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:42.180
 sword 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:44.740
 the w adds an electric scudito 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:48.700
 change the color 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:52.020
 and let's go see the ultimate 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:52.020
 there we see a blue sword 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:57.800
 again 

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:59.269
 and well nothing more from here to tell you that 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:02.239

00:04:59.269 --> 00:05:04.009
