how<00:03:38.090> it<00:03:38.450> scrolls<00:03:38.780> up<00:03:38.959> and<00:03:39.140> down<00:03:39.350> and<00:03:41.200> i

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 
how it scrolls up and down and i

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.199 
how it scrolls up and down and i
actually<00:03:42.410> i<00:03:42.830> think<00:03:42.890> it<00:03:43.310> scrolls<00:03:43.730> up<00:03:43.880> and<00:03:44.060> down

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:44.209 
actually i think it scrolls up and down

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:51.190 
actually i think it scrolls up and down
a<00:03:44.480> lot<00:03:44.900> better<00:03:46.000> it<00:03:47.000> goes<00:03:47.180> up<00:03:47.360> faster<00:03:48.130> like

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:51.200 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:54.400 

like<00:03:51.860> it's<00:03:52.190> just<00:03:52.310> as<00:03:52.730> fast<00:03:53.120> if<00:03:53.420> not<00:03:53.510> maybe<00:03:54.260> a

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:54.410 
like it's just as fast if not maybe a

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:58.540 
like it's just as fast if not maybe a
hair<00:03:54.890> faster<00:03:55.760> than<00:03:56.510> the<00:03:56.660> vol<00:03:56.959> 5<00:03:57.310> but<00:03:58.310> I<00:03:58.340> could

00:03:58.540 --> 00:03:58.550 
hair faster than the vol 5 but I could

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:00.070 
hair faster than the vol 5 but I could
definitely<00:03:58.730> say<00:03:59.269> that<00:03:59.300> it's<00:03:59.540> way<00:03:59.720> better<00:03:59.930> than

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:00.080 
definitely say that it's way better than

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:07.180 
definitely say that it's way better than
the<00:04:00.290> veal<00:04:00.500> three<00:04:00.860> when<00:04:01.730> I<00:04:01.760> first<00:04:02.030> got<00:04:02.330> it<00:04:06.190> as
