it I guess there's no apply that in here

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:40.060 
it I guess there's no apply that in here
like<00:01:33.750> so<00:01:34.820> bring<00:01:35.820> some<00:01:36.030> of<00:01:36.150> it<00:01:36.270> down

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:44.740 

grab<00:01:40.730> some<00:01:40.970> more<00:01:42.370> so<00:01:43.370> you<00:01:43.430> know<00:01:43.729> why<00:01:44.360> keep

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
grab some more so you know why keep

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:57.520 
grab some more so you know why keep
applying<00:01:45.140> some

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:03.470 

there<00:01:58.130> you<00:01:58.280> go<00:01:58.490> it's<00:01:58.820> kind<00:01:59.060> of

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:03.480 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:05.840 

excited<00:02:04.410> to<00:02:04.470> come<00:02:04.590> out<00:02:04.680> like<00:02:04.800> that<00:02:04.980> so<00:02:05.400> once<00:02:05.760> we

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
excited to come out like that so once we

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.130 
excited to come out like that so once we
remove<00:02:06.000> the<00:02:06.210> tape<00:02:06.420> so<00:02:06.810> you<00:02:06.840> just<00:02:06.990> keep

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
remove the tape so you just keep

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.730 
remove the tape so you just keep
applying<00:02:07.290> some<00:02:08.630> kind<00:02:09.630> of<00:02:09.690> make<00:02:09.900> some<00:02:10.410> go<00:02:10.680> to

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:10.740 
applying some kind of make some go to

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:15.550 
applying some kind of make some go to
the<00:02:11.160> end

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.740 

so<00:02:16.160> the<00:02:16.370> side<00:02:16.610> comes<00:02:16.849> out<00:02:16.940> a<00:02:17.000> little<00:02:17.120> bit<00:02:17.450> messy

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
so the side comes out a little bit messy

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:24.570 
so the side comes out a little bit messy
so<00:02:20.750> you're<00:02:20.870> going<00:02:20.989> to<00:02:21.080> keep<00:02:21.230> applying<00:02:21.590> some
