00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:04.080 
yes to tweak it to really get it it's

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.349 
yes to tweak it to really get it it's
funny<00:00:04.440> like<00:00:04.529> for<00:00:05.400> me<00:00:05.520> as<00:00:05.640> a<00:00:05.670> spirit<00:00:06.029> person<00:00:06.299> I

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
funny like for me as a spirit person I

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.110 
funny like for me as a spirit person I
can<00:00:06.509> all<00:00:06.660> see<00:00:06.930> whom<00:00:07.259> who<00:00:07.919> did<00:00:08.160> canoeing<00:00:08.880> and

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
can all see whom who did canoeing and

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.879 
can all see whom who did canoeing and
kayaking<00:00:09.360> on<00:00:09.750> for<00:00:10.050> because<00:00:10.349> there's<00:00:10.559> stroke

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
kayaking on for because there's stroke

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.499 
kayaking on for because there's stroke
is<00:00:11.040> similar<00:00:11.490> but<00:00:11.670> it's<00:00:11.849> different<00:00:12.210> too<00:00:12.710> so

00:00:14.499 --> 00:00:14.509 
is similar but it's different too so

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:18.260 
is similar but it's different too so
yeah<00:00:15.509> the<00:00:15.750> less<00:00:16.650> you<00:00:16.949> know<00:00:17.010> the<00:00:17.190> better<00:00:17.670> it<00:00:18.180> is

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
yeah the less you know the better it is

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.779 
yeah the less you know the better it is
sometimes<00:00:18.840> because<00:00:19.320> the<00:00:19.439> stroke<00:00:19.710> is<00:00:19.920> very<00:00:20.130> in

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
sometimes because the stroke is very in

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.090 
sometimes because the stroke is very in
order<00:00:21.060> to<00:00:21.210> be<00:00:21.359> in<00:00:21.539> unison<00:00:22.050> it's<00:00:22.230> very<00:00:22.500> strict

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
order to be in unison it's very strict

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.040 
order to be in unison it's very strict
how<00:00:23.550> we<00:00:23.609> want<00:00:24.119> how<00:00:24.539> we<00:00:24.600> wanted<00:00:26.330> just<00:00:27.330> rogan<00:00:27.900> in

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
how we want how we wanted just rogan in

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.200 
how we want how we wanted just rogan in
you<00:00:28.949> guys<00:00:29.099> could<00:00:29.340> go<00:00:29.460> out<00:00:29.609> there<00:00:29.880> and<00:00:30.000> try<00:00:30.150> to

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
you guys could go out there and try to

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.510 
you guys could go out there and try to
figure<00:00:30.480> it<00:00:30.660> out<00:00:30.810> and<00:00:31.260> I<00:00:31.410> mean<00:00:31.679> play<00:00:32.340> around

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
figure it out and I mean play around

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.520 
figure it out and I mean play around
with<00:00:32.730> it<00:00:32.820> it's<00:00:33.030> very<00:00:33.180> addictive<00:00:33.780> spoke<00:00:34.140> most

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
with it it's very addictive spoke most

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.990 
with it it's very addictive spoke most
people<00:00:34.950> stick<00:00:35.399> with<00:00:35.579> it<00:00:35.610> for<00:00:35.940> years<00:00:36.149> I<00:00:37.399> on<00:00:38.399> I

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
people stick with it for years I on I

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.740 
people stick with it for years I on I
don't<00:00:39.690> think<00:00:39.719> any<00:00:40.050> paddler<00:00:40.920> will<00:00:41.489> even<00:00:42.450> after

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
don't think any paddler will even after

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.139 
don't think any paddler will even after
years<00:00:43.079> will<00:00:43.469> will<00:00:43.800> say<00:00:44.070> what<00:00:44.309> I<00:00:44.579> don't<00:00:44.820> need<00:00:44.940> to

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
years will will say what I don't need to

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.590 
years will will say what I don't need to
run<00:00:45.300> this<00:00:46.550> maybe<00:00:47.550> they're<00:00:47.910> different

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
run this maybe they're different

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.720 
run this maybe they're different
different<00:00:49.350> approaches<00:00:49.710> to<00:00:49.920> things<00:00:50.070> later<00:00:50.640> on

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
different approaches to things later on

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.430 
different approaches to things later on
and<00:00:51.239> stuff<00:00:51.690> but<00:00:52.520> just<00:00:53.520> having<00:00:53.969> fun<00:00:54.000> I<00:00:54.690> think

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
and stuff but just having fun I think

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.139 
and stuff but just having fun I think
the<00:00:55.590> most<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:56.010> biggest<00:00:56.309> friggin<00:00:56.489> requisite

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
the most the biggest friggin requisite

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.260 
the most the biggest friggin requisite
is<00:00:57.329> not<00:00:57.539> to<00:00:57.719> take<00:00:57.899> yourself<00:00:58.260> too<00:00:58.410> seriously

00:00:59.260 --> 00:00:59.270 
is not to take yourself too seriously

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.119 
is not to take yourself too seriously
because<00:01:00.270> we're<00:01:00.629> not<00:01:00.809> this<00:01:01.379> is<00:01:01.500> not<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:01.710> most

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
because we're not this is not the most

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.320 
because we're not this is not the most
efficient<00:01:02.820> way<00:01:02.910> to<00:01:03.030> move<00:01:03.239> forward<00:01:04.369> a<00:01:05.369> full<00:01:06.000> a

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
efficient way to move forward a full a

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.929 
efficient way to move forward a full a
full<00:01:07.020> dragon<00:01:07.439> boat<00:01:07.590> with<00:01:07.830> boat<00:01:08.070> and<00:01:08.369> people<00:01:08.790> is

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
full dragon boat with boat and people is

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:14.359 
full dragon boat with boat and people is
actually<00:01:09.299> two<00:01:10.170> metric<00:01:10.530> tons<00:01:12.799> moved<00:01:13.799> out<00:01:14.010> along

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
actually two metric tons moved out along

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.420 
actually two metric tons moved out along
at<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:15.330> pace<00:01:15.780> we're<00:01:16.110> doing<00:01:16.500> it<00:01:16.619> there<00:01:16.830> but

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
at the pace we're doing it there but

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.190 
at the pace we're doing it there but
that's<00:01:17.640> also<00:01:17.939> the<00:01:18.210> challenge<00:01:18.630> for<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:18.900> scare

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
that's also the challenge for the scare

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.980 
that's also the challenge for the scare
because<00:01:19.430> you<00:01:20.430> have<00:01:20.580> to<00:01:20.790> in<00:01:21.119> an<00:01:21.450> emergency<00:01:21.689> you

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
because you have to in an emergency you

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.679 
because you have to in an emergency you
have<00:01:22.200> to<00:01:22.350> get<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.740> two<00:01:23.220> tons<00:01:23.580> stopping<00:01:24.509> as

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
have to get the two tons stopping as

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.730 
have to get the two tons stopping as
soon<00:01:24.900> as<00:01:25.049> you<00:01:25.170> can<00:01:25.380> right<00:01:26.130> so<00:01:26.750> that's<00:01:27.750> that

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
soon as you can right so that's that

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.249 
soon as you can right so that's that
that's<00:01:29.040> where<00:01:29.340> always<00:01:29.670> there<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:30.750> two-ton

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
that's where always there the two-ton

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.170 
that's where always there the two-ton
measurement<00:01:31.740> really<00:01:32.159> is<00:01:32.369> sometimes<00:01:32.909> even

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
measurement really is sometimes even

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.310 
measurement really is sometimes even
intimidating

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
intimidating

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.460 
intimidating
Oh<00:01:35.570> practices<00:01:36.570> later<00:01:36.780> on<00:01:36.960> in<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.290> boat

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
Oh practices later on in the boat

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.740 
mean especially here on the lake it's
fairly<00:02:04.550> where<00:02:05.550> it<00:02:05.640> gets<00:02:05.759> tricky<00:02:06.030> is<00:02:06.360> with

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
fairly where it gets tricky is with

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.880 
fairly where it gets tricky is with
motor<00:02:06.990> boat<00:02:08.660> where<00:02:09.660> other<00:02:10.020> people<00:02:10.140> might<00:02:10.649> not

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:31.100 
little hot and they're off to show that
they<00:02:27.840> can<00:02:28.019> make<00:02:28.170> waves<00:02:29.390> and<00:02:30.390> waves<00:02:30.540> are<00:02:30.810> always

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
they can make waves and waves are always

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.290 
they can make waves and waves are always
like<00:02:31.470> if<00:02:31.800> the<00:02:31.950> waves<00:02:32.130> hit<00:02:32.370> from<00:02:32.550> the<00:02:32.610> side<00:02:32.880> and

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
like if the waves hit from the side and

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:38.539 
like if the waves hit from the side and
then<00:02:33.959> we<00:02:34.110> get<00:02:34.260> a<00:02:34.410> little<00:02:34.680> more<00:02:36.739> um<00:02:37.739> no<00:02:37.800> you<00:02:38.280> can

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:38.549 
then we get a little more um no you can

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:40.970 
then we get a little more um no you can
can<00:02:39.180> use<00:02:39.390> some<00:02:39.660> tricks<00:02:39.989> I<00:02:40.230> mean<00:02:40.590> that's<00:02:40.709> the

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
can use some tricks I mean that's the

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.220 
can use some tricks I mean that's the
advantage<00:02:41.220> of<00:02:41.519> these<00:02:41.700> if<00:02:42.000> you<00:02:42.030> if<00:02:42.510> you<00:02:42.900> want<00:02:43.110> to

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
advantage of these if you if you want to

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.440 
advantage of these if you if you want to
turn<00:02:43.380> them<00:02:43.560> they<00:02:43.739> turn<00:02:43.950> faster<00:02:44.519> but<00:02:45.030> if<00:02:45.239> you

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
turn them they turn faster but if you

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.240 
turn them they turn faster but if you
don't<00:02:45.690> want<00:02:45.959> them<00:02:46.170> to<00:02:46.320> turn<00:02:46.470> they<00:02:46.650> turn<00:02:46.860> faster

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
don't want them to turn they turn faster

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.930 
don't want them to turn they turn faster
too<00:02:48.530> so<00:02:49.530> these<00:02:49.739> ones<00:02:49.980> are<00:02:50.130> more<00:02:50.340> stable<00:02:50.610> or<00:02:50.850> not

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
too so these ones are more stable or not

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.759 
too so these ones are more stable or not
as<00:02:51.269> tippy<00:02:51.870> that<00:02:52.079> way<00:02:52.320> they're<00:02:52.560> a<00:02:52.590> little

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
as tippy that way they're a little

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:58.160 
as tippy that way they're a little
heavier<00:02:52.890> yeah<00:02:53.640> um<00:02:55.940> and<00:02:56.940> they<00:02:57.329> don't<00:02:57.510> turn<00:02:57.900> as

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
heavier yeah um and they don't turn as

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.410 
heavier yeah um and they don't turn as
quickly<00:02:58.200> but<00:02:59.190> we<00:02:59.549> don't<00:02:59.670> want<00:02:59.970> them<00:03:00.090> to<00:03:00.239> turn

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
quickly but we don't want them to turn

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.690 
quickly but we don't want them to turn
in<00:03:00.570> a<00:03:00.660> race<00:03:00.840> we<00:03:01.049> want<00:03:01.260> them<00:03:01.440> to<00:03:01.470> be<00:03:01.680> like<00:03:02.370> on<00:03:02.670> a
