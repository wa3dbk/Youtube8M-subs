00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:07.490
 It is called John around the tray 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:09.790
 There is a giant of saxophone and it is the behavior of that person 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.440
 UK new people are tripled 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:14.440
 Until then I 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:16.370
 Folk songs and hydrogen have always been there 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:19.580
 I did classical music 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:24.909
 I'm shocked by the aggression 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:26.890

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:31.380
 Than the Liberal Democratic Party 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:31.380

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:48.230

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.920
 We will continue, of course 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:52.509
 However 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:57.640
 I really want to do my own 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:02:03.780
 In the shop where you really want to play music 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:08.210

 I 'm totally a pin 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:17.730
 I think it's good that it's Western music to say that jazz 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:23.489
 For example, assuming that it is a concert venue 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:28.650
 I came to take it , but I think that one thing is 12 I feel free to enter 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:33.310
 Facing forward is that everyone in the reverse to be easy to do Pureshii 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:34.730

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:40.610
 Hard to do 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:42.300
 So just because you've got a seat there , for example , your own concentration will be disturbed 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:45.220
 I have nothing to say 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:48.770
 I know all the money 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:50.280
 Well it's that balance 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:54.540
 Sense 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:56.760

00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:00.870
 There is 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:03.760
 Is it a festival or a bit too much that 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:08.710
 What can not happen 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:11.860
