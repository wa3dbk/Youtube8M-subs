00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:17.170
 comfortable nose and when he began to create

 very small us and the animals carefully 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:33.390
 inspected but the elephant and exclaimed 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:36.760
 before the elephant is actually the oldest of us 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:39.820

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:08.019
 recognize that I am the elder of the earth when I 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:11.049
 born the earth was not yet properly 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:14.049
 completed it was as soft as butter 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:18.209
 I couldn't walk on it 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:22.830
 only thanks to my needles 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:25.150
 The argument was convincing and all gathered 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:27.880
 greeted the porcupine by loud 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:31.120
 shouts yes yes can there be

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.739
 fell silent 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:36.180
 and prepared to listen to the decision 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:39.720
 anansie 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:43.019

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:46.630
 shook his head and said if you were 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:49.930

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:02.260
 nothing was not even what 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:05.320
 had to stand when my father died 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:10.920
 there was no place to bury him therefore for me 

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:12.700
 had to bury him in my head 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:16.920
 when the beast 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:21.970

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:24.780
