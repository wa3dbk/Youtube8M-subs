 this is the next lesson 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:06.900
 on which we will create a two-color 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.880
 glass 

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:12.060
 and open materials 

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:14.930
 I press the standard 

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:14.930
 I choose here 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:17.830
 the boat 

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:27.280
 the material consists of two components 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:33.060
 first top material 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.060
 upper 

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:37.330
 and like stuff 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.330
 below 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.520
 open the top slot 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:46.140
 here I click the standard and select and 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.140
 Heavenly material faith mt 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.300
 diffuse main color i choose black 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.110
 reflex power reflection 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:06.470
 I use the card 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.470
 file 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.590
 in this tab, select fresno 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.960
 5th grade 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:23.300
 this is a reflection reflection 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.300
 I put 098 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:31.430
 subdiv is responsible for the quality of the material i 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.430
 I put 8 for fast rendering 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.580
 fact 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:42.620
 refraction 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.620
 here we will adjust the transparency of the material 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.930
 I put white 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:50.980
 we include gram 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:58.049
 we see what we have 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.049
 there is material 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.189
 tick effects on us 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:09.650
 so that they do not get physically accurate 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.950
 I copy the top material 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.620
 here dying mines click 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:27.210
 open up 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:27.210
 second slot 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.240
 and change color fogg olya 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.319
 for example red 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.040
 can also be changed for color 1 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.760
 the material 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.760
 and open 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:15.650

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:15.650
 choosing here blue 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:27.950
 button light can be swapped 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:39.160
 blend 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:42.060
 this degree of mixing 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.060
 2 material 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:54.620
 positions 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.620
 defines the mix boundary 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:14.650
 i click romer 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:42.870
 At this point I finish the lesson do not forget
