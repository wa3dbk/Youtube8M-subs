00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
or even glass so that means Joe tar and

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.680

really intense and then eventually

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.360 
really intense and then eventually
Jotaro<00:02:48.810> finally<00:02:49.200> realizes<00:02:49.650> he<00:02:49.800> needs<00:02:49.830> to<00:02:50.160> stop
