watchmaking in Glasgow I wanted to

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:45.520

introduce it to its ancestors in the

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.750 
introduce it to its ancestors in the
museum<00:01:46.010> there<00:01:46.310> and<00:01:46.550> to<00:01:46.910> see<00:01:47.090> its<00:01:47.240> family<00:01:47.720> tree

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:51.130 
museum there and to see its family tree
and<00:01:49.760> because<00:01:50.090> my<00:01:50.330> watch<00:01:50.510> has<00:01:50.720> been<00:01:50.960> ticking

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
and because my watch has been ticking

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.920 
and because my watch has been ticking
away<00:01:51.410> without<00:01:51.680> a<00:01:51.830> service<00:01:52.310> since<00:01:52.550> the<00:01:52.720> 1970s<00:01:53.720> I

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:53.930 
away without a service since the 1970s I

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:55.660 
away without a service since the 1970s I
thought<00:01:54.440> it<00:01:54.560> would<00:01:54.680> be<00:01:54.800> a<00:01:54.830> good<00:01:55.100> idea<00:01:55.220> for<00:01:55.490> it

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
thought it would be a good idea for it

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.160 
thought it would be a good idea for it
