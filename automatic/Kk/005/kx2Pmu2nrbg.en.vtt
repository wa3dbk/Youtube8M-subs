doubling<00:02:47.030> up<00:02:47.150> the<00:02:47.180> thread<00:02:47.570> for<00:02:47.840> extra

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
doubling up the thread for extra

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.199 
doubling up the thread for extra
strength<00:02:48.410> bring<00:02:49.190> the<00:02:49.340> needle<00:02:49.489> up<00:02:49.730> through<00:02:50.120> one

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:50.209 
strength bring the needle up through one

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:52.060 
strength bring the needle up through one
of<00:02:50.269> the<00:02:50.420> ironed<00:02:50.780> edges<00:02:51.200> so<00:02:51.530> the<00:02:51.650> knot<00:02:51.800> is

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:52.070 
of the ironed edges so the knot is

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:54.850 
of the ironed edges so the knot is
hidden<00:02:52.510> then<00:02:53.510> go<00:02:53.720> to<00:02:53.780> the<00:02:53.959> opposite<00:02:54.410> side<00:02:54.470> and

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.860 
hidden then go to the opposite side and

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:56.500 
hidden then go to the opposite side and
slide<00:02:55.280> the<00:02:55.430> needle<00:02:55.550> through<00:02:55.940> the<00:02:55.970> top<00:02:56.090> of<00:02:56.420> the

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
slide the needle through the top of the

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.150 
slide the needle through the top of the
fold<00:02:56.720> so<00:02:57.140> you<00:02:57.200> pick<00:02:57.440> up<00:02:57.560> a<00:02:57.709> little<00:02:57.890> bit<00:02:58.070> of

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
fold so you pick up a little bit of

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.020 
fold so you pick up a little bit of
fabric<00:02:59.170> next<00:03:00.170> go<00:03:00.620> directly<00:03:01.220> across<00:03:01.580> to<00:03:01.940> the

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
fabric next go directly across to the

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.069 
fabric next go directly across to the
other<00:03:02.150> side<00:03:02.480> and<00:03:02.720> do<00:03:02.930> the<00:03:02.959> same<00:03:03.080> thing

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:05.079 
other side and do the same thing

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:08.410 
other side and do the same thing
repeat<00:03:06.079> this<00:03:06.230> a<00:03:06.439> couple<00:03:06.469> more<00:03:06.859> times<00:03:07.420> the

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
repeat this a couple more times the

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.300 
repeat this a couple more times the
trick<00:03:08.719> to<00:03:08.900> this<00:03:09.019> stitch<00:03:09.319> is<00:03:09.530> when<00:03:09.859> you<00:03:09.980> go<00:03:10.129> from

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
trick to this stitch is when you go from

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.940 
trick to this stitch is when you go from
side<00:03:10.579> to<00:03:10.609> side<00:03:10.760> go<00:03:11.540> straight<00:03:11.930> across<00:03:12.079> so<00:03:12.590> the

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
side to side go straight across so the

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.929 
side to side go straight across so the
thread<00:03:13.280> is<00:03:13.459> perpendicular<00:03:14.209> to<00:03:14.239> the<00:03:14.480> folds<00:03:15.939> the

00:03:16.929 --> 00:03:16.939 
thread is perpendicular to the folds the

00:03:16.939 --> 00:03:18.520 
thread is perpendicular to the folds the
thread<00:03:17.209> will<00:03:17.390> start<00:03:17.629> to<00:03:17.750> look<00:03:17.900> like<00:03:17.959> the<00:03:18.319> rungs

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
thread will start to look like the rungs

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:22.839 
thread will start to look like the rungs
on<00:03:18.829> a<00:03:18.859> ladder<00:03:20.920> when<00:03:21.920> you<00:03:22.010> pull<00:03:22.219> the<00:03:22.340> thread<00:03:22.489> top

00:03:22.839 --> 00:03:22.849 
on a ladder when you pull the thread top

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:26.170 
on a ladder when you pull the thread top
the<00:03:23.150> stitches<00:03:23.569> will<00:03:23.780> disappear<00:03:25.180> continue

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
the stitches will disappear continue

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.270 
the stitches will disappear continue
this<00:03:26.329> process<00:03:26.629> down<00:03:27.139> the<00:03:27.319> opening<00:03:27.769> pulling

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
this process down the opening pulling

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.869 
this process down the opening pulling
the<00:03:28.400> thread<00:03:28.639> top<00:03:28.939> every<00:03:29.420> couple<00:03:29.689> of<00:03:29.719> stitches

00:03:30.869 --> 00:03:30.879 
the thread top every couple of stitches

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:33.849 
the thread top every couple of stitches
when<00:03:31.879> you<00:03:31.969> get<00:03:32.150> to<00:03:32.239> the<00:03:32.359> end<00:03:32.569> pick<00:03:33.260> up<00:03:33.409> a<00:03:33.560> bit<00:03:33.739> of

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:33.859 
when you get to the end pick up a bit of

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:36.190 
when you get to the end pick up a bit of
fabric<00:03:34.040> like<00:03:34.459> before<00:03:34.849> this<00:03:35.450> time<00:03:35.719> bring<00:03:36.049> the

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.200 
fabric like before this time bring the

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:37.869 
fabric like before this time bring the
needle<00:03:36.500> through<00:03:36.799> the<00:03:36.859> loop<00:03:37.040> of<00:03:37.250> thread<00:03:37.400> so<00:03:37.669> you

00:03:37.869 --> 00:03:37.879 
needle through the loop of thread so you

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:40.210 
needle through the loop of thread so you
form<00:03:38.209> a<00:03:38.329> knot<00:03:38.540> then<00:03:39.169> repeat<00:03:39.500> this<00:03:39.739> going

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
form a knot then repeat this going

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.190 
form a knot then repeat this going
through<00:03:40.400> the<00:03:40.519> knot<00:03:40.700> you<00:03:40.849> just<00:03:40.879> made<00:03:41.329> do<00:03:42.049> this
