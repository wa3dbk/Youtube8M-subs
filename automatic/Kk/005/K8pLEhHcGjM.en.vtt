00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810 
would sound like played on a guitar

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.969 
would sound like played on a guitar
there<00:01:29.810> was<00:01:29.930> no<00:01:30.110> such<00:01:30.640> thing<00:01:31.640> as<00:01:31.670> a<00:01:31.970> five<00:01:32.390> string

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:32.979

there was no such thing as a five string
guitar<00:01:33.979> set<00:01:34.250> up<00:01:34.340> to<00:01:34.460> play<00:01:34.580> like<00:01:34.850> a<00:01:34.880> banjo<00:01:35.390> on

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600

guitar set up to play like a banjo on
the<00:01:36.080> market<00:01:36.530> and<00:01:37.630> so<00:01:38.630> Dustin<00:01:39.350> and<00:01:39.409> I<00:01:39.470> decided

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 
the market and so Dustin and I decided

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.300 
the market and so Dustin and I decided
to<00:01:40.070> make<00:01:40.310> one<00:01:40.340> and<00:01:41.530> we<00:01:42.530> built<00:01:42.829> a<00:01:43.009> crude

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
to make one and we built a crude

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.480 
to make one and we built a crude
prototype<00:01:44.140> basically<00:01:45.140> carved<00:01:45.740> out<00:01:45.890> a<00:01:45.920> banjo

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
prototype basically carved out a banjo

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.630 
prototype basically carved out a banjo
neck<00:01:46.729> from<00:01:46.970> six<00:01:47.299> string<00:01:47.540> guitar<00:01:47.570> and<00:01:48.579> added<00:01:49.579> a

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
neck from six string guitar and added a

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.960 
neck from six string guitar and added a
pitch<00:01:49.850> string<00:01:50.180> peg<00:01:51.100> tuned<00:01:52.100> it<00:01:52.220> like<00:01:52.369> a<00:01:52.400> banjo

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:52.970 
pitch string peg tuned it like a banjo

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:59.580 
pitch string peg tuned it like a banjo
and<00:01:53.270> we<00:01:53.600> found<00:01:53.869> out<00:01:54.130> didn't<00:01:55.130> sound<00:01:55.340> half<00:01:55.610> bad

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:02.170 

we<00:02:00.590> then<00:02:00.770> took<00:02:00.950> our<00:02:01.130> prototype<00:02:01.670> to<00:02:01.880> a<00:02:01.910> local

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 
we then took our prototype to a local

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.570 
we then took our prototype to a local
luthier<00:02:02.750> Brian<00:02:03.410> Applegate<00:02:03.920> and<00:02:04.100> had<00:02:04.370> him<00:02:04.550> make

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:04.580 
luthier Brian Applegate and had him make

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.330 
luthier Brian Applegate and had him make
us<00:02:04.880> a<00:02:05.000> nice<00:02:05.150> one<00:02:05.440> once<00:02:06.440> we<00:02:06.590> got<00:02:06.770> it<00:02:07.010> we<00:02:07.160> realized

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
us a nice one once we got it we realized

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.100 
us a nice one once we got it we realized
it<00:02:07.610> was<00:02:07.730> a<00:02:07.790> great<00:02:08.000> product<00:02:08.330> and<00:02:08.540> decided<00:02:09.020> we

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
it was a great product and decided we

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:10.810 
it was a great product and decided we
wanted<00:02:09.380> to<00:02:09.440> market<00:02:09.860> it<00:02:09.950> here's<00:02:10.580> where
