00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
couldn't pull him and then that's why I

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.729 
couldn't pull him and then that's why I
did<00:00:32.430> end<00:00:32.669> up<00:00:32.820> completing<00:00:33.239> the<00:00:33.739> 2013-2014

Rockets<00:00:35.520> collection<00:00:35.910> because<00:00:36.180> i<00:00:36.329> only<00:00:36.480> needed

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
Rockets collection because i only needed

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.060 
Rockets collection because i only needed
Omar<00:00:37.260> Casspi<00:00:37.739> and<00:00:38.059> he's<00:00:39.059> the<00:00:39.239> reward<00:00:39.570> for<00:00:39.629> the

2013-2014<00:00:41.070> rockets<00:00:41.700> collection<00:00:42.030> obviously

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
2013-2014 rockets collection obviously

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.720 
2013-2014 rockets collection obviously
and<00:00:42.840> I<00:00:43.440> pretty<00:00:43.620> much<00:00:43.710> just<00:00:43.860> killed<00:00:44.250> two<00:00:44.489> birds

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
and I pretty much just killed two birds

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.250 
and I pretty much just killed two birds
with<00:00:45.000> one<00:00:45.059> stone<00:00:45.210> right<00:00:45.719> completed<00:00:46.170> the

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
with one stone right completed the

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.160 
with one stone right completed the
Rockets<00:00:46.680> we've<00:00:46.770> got<00:00:46.980> me<00:00:47.100> Kenny<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.489> jet<00:00:47.520> Smith

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:48.170 
Rockets we've got me Kenny the jet Smith

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:50.270 
Rockets we've got me Kenny the jet Smith
so<00:00:49.170> I<00:00:49.200> pretty<00:00:49.469> much<00:00:49.590> didn't<00:00:49.920> get<00:00:50.039> a<00:00:50.070> duplicate

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
so I pretty much didn't get a duplicate

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.189 
so I pretty much didn't get a duplicate
Smith<00:00:50.850> and<00:00:51.090> it<00:00:51.239> probably<00:00:51.449> saved<00:00:51.600> me<00:00:51.899> a<00:00:51.930> ton<00:00:52.140> of

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
Smith and it probably saved me a ton of

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.560 
Smith and it probably saved me a ton of
ec<00:00:52.590> for<00:00:52.860> both<00:00:53.070> packs<00:00:53.430> and<00:00:53.699> that's<00:00:54.270> kind<00:00:54.449> of<00:00:54.510> the

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
ec for both packs and that's kind of the

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.299 
ec for both packs and that's kind of the
idea<00:00:54.660> behind<00:00:55.050> waiting<00:00:55.530> on<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.710> Celtics<00:00:56.129> get

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
idea behind waiting on the Celtics get

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.549 
idea behind waiting on the Celtics get
Kevin<00:00:56.640> McHale<00:00:56.969> have<00:00:57.899> them<00:00:58.079> already<00:00:58.230> in<00:00:58.410> that

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
Kevin McHale have them already in that

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.049 
Kevin McHale have them already in that
collection<00:00:58.800> just<00:00:59.100> wait<00:00:59.370> so<00:00:59.609> we<00:00:59.699> don't<00:00:59.850> have<00:00:59.940> to

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
collection just wait so we don't have to

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.939 
collection just wait so we don't have to
get<00:01:00.210> them<00:01:00.300> again<00:01:00.600> and<00:01:00.809> hopefully<00:01:01.500> I<00:01:01.770> don't

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
get them again and hopefully I don't

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.520 
get them again and hopefully I don't
spam<00:01:02.309> to<00:01:02.550> spend<00:01:02.760> a<00:01:02.789> ton<00:01:02.969> of<00:01:03.030> vc<00:01:03.449> because<00:01:04.290> i've

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
spam to spend a ton of vc because i've

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.410 
spam to spend a ton of vc because i've
done<00:01:04.710> two<00:01:04.920> collections<00:01:05.339> and<00:01:05.790> i've<00:01:06.030> noticed

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
done two collections and i've noticed

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.060 
done two collections and i've noticed
the<00:01:06.540> players<00:01:06.810> at<00:01:07.080> our<00:01:07.170> reward<00:01:07.590> collections

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
the players at our reward collections

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.010 
the players at our reward collections
for<00:01:08.549> some<00:01:08.760> reason<00:01:09.180> i<00:01:09.330> don't<00:01:09.630> know<00:01:09.810> if<00:01:09.900> it's

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
for some reason i don't know if it's

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.140 
for some reason i don't know if it's
like<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.320> game<00:01:10.590> itself<00:01:11.070> or<00:01:11.490> what<00:01:11.729> but<00:01:11.880> i<00:01:11.970> just

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
like the game itself or what but i just

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.210 
like the game itself or what but i just
don't<00:01:12.330> seem<00:01:12.630> to<00:01:12.780> get<00:01:12.900> lucky<00:01:13.260> and<00:01:13.409> pull<00:01:14.070> them

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
don't seem to get lucky and pull them

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.010 
don't seem to get lucky and pull them
very<00:01:14.460> often<00:01:14.700> it<00:01:15.450> seems<00:01:15.509> like<00:01:15.840> they're<00:01:15.990> a

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
very often it seems like they're a

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.630 
very often it seems like they're a
little<00:01:16.170> bit<00:01:16.380> rarer<00:01:16.710> than<00:01:16.950> some<00:01:17.159> other<00:01:17.310> cards

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
little bit rarer than some other cards

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.010 
little bit rarer than some other cards
because<00:01:17.790> they<00:01:18.030> are<00:01:18.090> a<00:01:18.180> collection<00:01:18.509> of<00:01:18.630> reward

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
because they are a collection of reward

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.660 
because they are a collection of reward
earlier<00:01:19.470> whatever<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:19.950> case<00:01:20.130> may<00:01:20.340> be<00:01:20.369> but

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
earlier whatever the case may be but

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.100 
earlier whatever the case may be but
that's<00:01:21.150> oh<00:01:21.240> I'm<00:01:21.299> gonna<00:01:21.390> hold<00:01:21.600> off<00:01:21.810> and<00:01:22.020> we're

one is like 75 or something that's not
very<00:02:09.810> good

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
very good

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.140 
very good
and<00:02:10.750> then<00:02:10.870> Hakim<00:02:11.200> the<00:02:11.320> dreams<00:02:11.590> like<00:02:11.770> 95<00:02:12.730> plus

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
and then Hakim the dreams like 95 plus

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.270 
and then Hakim the dreams like 95 plus
for<00:02:13.390> both<00:02:13.510> of<00:02:13.720> them<00:02:13.810> and<00:02:14.020> I<00:02:14.560> think<00:02:14.770> this<00:02:14.860> rookie

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
for both of them and I think this rookie

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.040 
for both of them and I think this rookie
Tim<00:02:15.550> Duncan<00:02:16.000> it's<00:02:16.120> kind<00:02:16.330> of<00:02:16.360> the<00:02:16.480> same<00:02:16.510> deal<00:02:16.900> I

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
Tim Duncan it's kind of the same deal I

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:18.540 
Tim Duncan it's kind of the same deal I
think<00:02:17.260> I<00:02:17.320> don't<00:02:17.500> he's<00:02:17.650> not<00:02:17.860> nearly<00:02:18.070> as<00:02:18.220> good<00:02:18.430> as

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
think I don't he's not nearly as good as

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.060 
think I don't he's not nearly as good as
a<00:02:18.670> team<00:02:18.880> but<00:02:19.630> I<00:02:19.930> think<00:02:20.320> both<00:02:20.530> of<00:02:20.560> them<00:02:20.710> is<00:02:20.920> like

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
a team but I think both of them is like

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:23.520 
a team but I think both of them is like
88<00:02:21.610> and<00:02:21.850> above<00:02:22.120> well<00:02:22.780> I<00:02:22.810> think<00:02:22.930> one<00:02:23.260> of<00:02:23.290> them's

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
88 and above well I think one of them's

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.350 
88 and above well I think one of them's
in<00:02:23.680> the<00:02:23.770> 90s<00:02:24.280> will<00:02:24.460> check<00:02:24.640> out<00:02:24.760> his<00:02:24.880> stats<00:02:25.180> if

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
in the 90s will check out his stats if

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:26.700 
in the 90s will check out his stats if
we<00:02:25.450> just<00:02:25.600> got<00:02:25.810> him<00:02:25.960> so<00:02:26.110> we'll<00:02:26.260> check<00:02:26.440> it<00:02:26.590> out

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:26.710 
we just got him so we'll check it out

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:28.170 
we just got him so we'll check it out
after<00:02:27.160> we<00:02:27.580> complete<00:02:27.910> the<00:02:28.000> collection

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
after we complete the collection

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.270 
after we complete the collection
hopefully<00:02:28.750> and<00:02:28.900> get<00:02:29.050> David<00:02:29.680> Robinson<00:02:29.860> will

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
hopefully and get David Robinson will

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:31.590 
hopefully and get David Robinson will
just<00:02:30.460> kind<00:02:30.550> of<00:02:30.640> compare<00:02:30.970> their<00:02:31.150> low<00:02:31.330> post

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:31.600 
just kind of compare their low post

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.020 
just kind of compare their low post
stats<00:02:31.960> but<00:02:32.800> I<00:02:32.860> I'm<00:02:33.160> like<00:02:33.340> literally<00:02:33.700> I<00:02:33.790> think

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
stats but I I'm like literally I think

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.080 
stats but I I'm like literally I think
this<00:02:34.120> rookie<00:02:34.510> Tim<00:02:34.690> Duncan<00:02:35.160> overall<00:02:36.160> only<00:02:36.610> 89<00:02:36.940> a

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
this rookie Tim Duncan overall only 89 a

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:38.670 
this rookie Tim Duncan overall only 89 a
little<00:02:37.480> bit<00:02:37.600> underwhelming<00:02:38.260> but<00:02:38.440> I<00:02:38.500> don't

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
little bit underwhelming but I don't

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.100 
little bit underwhelming but I don't
think<00:02:38.800> people<00:02:39.040> really<00:02:39.460> are<00:02:39.850> look<00:02:40.510> at<00:02:40.660> how<00:02:40.810> good

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
think people really are look at how good

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.410 
think people really are look at how good
overall<00:02:41.740> when<00:02:42.130> you're<00:02:42.250> 90<00:02:42.820> overall<00:02:43.240> in

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
something if there was a guy yet a 90

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.600 
something if there was a guy yet a 90
mid-range<00:02:45.850> at<00:02:46.030> ninety<00:02:46.570> three<00:02:46.780> pointer<00:02:47.610> that's

mid-range at ninety three pointer that's

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:51.630 
mid-range at ninety three pointer that's
ridiculous<00:02:49.380> that<00:02:50.380> is<00:02:50.530> amazing<00:02:50.830> which<00:02:51.490> is

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
ridiculous that is amazing which is

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.130 
ridiculous that is amazing which is
again<00:02:51.910> the<00:02:52.030> same<00:02:52.240> thing<00:02:52.450> in<00:02:52.600> the<00:02:52.750> low<00:02:52.900> post

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
a really high overall and I think people

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.130 
a really high overall and I think people
just<00:02:57.550> don't<00:02:57.820> really<00:02:58.000> use<00:02:58.420> guys<00:02:58.750> in<00:02:58.930> the<00:02:58.990> low

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
just don't really use guys in the low

just don't really use guys in the low
