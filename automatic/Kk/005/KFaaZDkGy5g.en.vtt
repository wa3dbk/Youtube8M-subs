00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:13.730
 tutorial I'm going to show you how to root 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:15.889
 the huawei of 330 from the mobile 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:19.520
 what we will need to root 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:22.430
 this phone is the network application 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:26.800
 master that in this case I will be 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:28.949
 leaving in the description of the video 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:31.720
 once the application is installed 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:34.950
 we proceed to open it 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.950
 we wait for him to load 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:42.109
 Here are the phone model 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:45.609
 in my case as it is already rooted 

00:00:42.109 --> 00:00:45.609
 appears instantly 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:51.910
 in your case 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:54.940
 You can take a little longer because it has 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:56.590
 that recognize the phone 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:00.250
 once you have recognized the 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:02.739
 phone as we can see here they appear 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:05.630
 three buttons give you the button 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:08.920
 in the middle where ruth says 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.920
 we wait for him to load 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:20.120
 and then this window appears again 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.120
 we give in surf 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:27.619
 you practically have to be dragging 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.619
 the phone 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:41.170
 it's not that it's over it will appear this 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:41.170
 window we give in the purple author 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:47.330
 and practically your phone is already 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.330
 rooted 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.299
 then d 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:56.229
 have done this then we proceed to 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:02:00.250
 restart I'm not going to do it because 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:03.760
 I'm recording and it's already rooted 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:08.070
 when it finishes restarting and go back to 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:08.070
 turn on it will appear 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.760
 the application like this 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:16.820
 that means they already have the 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:19.310
 Rooted phone is practically the 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:21.920
 granting permits to 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:25.750
 applications to the applications of the gift 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.750
