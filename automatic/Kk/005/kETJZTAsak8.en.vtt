well<00:01:18.689> a<00:01:18.720> long<00:01:19.110> time<00:01:19.140> ago<00:01:19.470> I<00:01:19.950> bought<00:01:20.400> this<00:01:20.580> thing

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:21.259 
well a long time ago I bought this thing

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:23.480 
well a long time ago I bought this thing
and<00:01:22.259> I'm<00:01:22.350> surprised<00:01:22.740> I<00:01:22.920> never<00:01:23.100> made<00:01:23.280> a<00:01:23.310> video

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
and I'm surprised I never made a video

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.060 
and I'm surprised I never made a video
about<00:01:23.729> it<00:01:23.880> before<00:01:24.390> but<00:01:25.200> this<00:01:25.380> is<00:01:25.530> called<00:01:25.710> a

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
about it before but this is called a

directly to a TV so if you don't want to
have<00:04:31.800> to<00:04:31.979> use<00:04:32.190> the<00:04:32.400> antenna<00:04:32.819> which<00:04:33.240> you<00:04:33.360> see

00:04:33.559 --> 00:04:33.569 
have to use the antenna which you see

00:04:33.569 --> 00:04:35.300 
have to use the antenna which you see
here<00:04:33.990> if<00:04:34.650> you<00:04:34.710> don't<00:04:34.830> want<00:04:34.919> to<00:04:35.069> have<00:04:35.190> to

here if you don't want to have to

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:36.920 
here if you don't want to have to
broadcast<00:04:35.580> it<00:04:36.060> over<00:04:36.240> the<00:04:36.330> antenna<00:04:36.690> you<00:04:36.900> can

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:36.930 
broadcast it over the antenna you can

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:38.870 
broadcast it over the antenna you can
just<00:04:37.259> broadcast<00:04:37.770> it<00:04:37.919> directly<00:04:38.370> like<00:04:38.550> a<00:04:38.580> little

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880 
just broadcast it directly like a little

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:42.110 
just broadcast it directly like a little
cable<00:04:39.240> box<00:04:39.419> and<00:04:39.800> send<00:04:40.800> it<00:04:40.919> through<00:04:40.949> channel<00:04:41.639> 27

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:42.120 
cable box and send it through channel 27

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.300 
cable box and send it through channel 27
that<00:04:43.020> way

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:44.310 
that way

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:47.629 
that way

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:50.430 
the unit here and you have the video

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:53.710 
the unit here and you have the video
sender<00:04:51.030> or<00:04:51.240> modulator<00:04:52.020> selection<00:04:52.979> there<00:04:53.190> and

light and my channel adjust so takes a

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:03.170 
light and my channel adjust so takes a
little<00:05:01.800> bit<00:05:01.979> of<00:05:02.039> fine-tuning<00:05:02.340> and<00:05:02.940> you<00:05:03.000> can

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:03.180 
little bit of fine-tuning and you can

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:04.909 
little bit of fine-tuning and you can
get<00:05:03.330> it<00:05:03.449> set<00:05:03.660> up<00:05:03.690> pretty<00:05:04.410> much<00:05:04.500> the<00:05:04.770> way<00:05:04.889> you

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:04.919 
get it set up pretty much the way you

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:05.540 
get it set up pretty much the way you
like<00:05:05.220> it

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:05.550 
like it

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:08.420 
like it
but<00:05:06.449> a<00:05:06.900> couple<00:05:07.320> of<00:05:07.470> applications<00:05:08.130> you<00:05:08.280> could

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:08.430 
but a couple of applications you could

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:10.249 
but a couple of applications you could
use<00:05:08.580> this<00:05:08.759> for<00:05:09.030> let's<00:05:09.210> say<00:05:09.389> you<00:05:09.449> have<00:05:09.780> a<00:05:09.810> church

00:05:10.249 --> 00:05:10.259 
use this for let's say you have a church

00:05:10.259 --> 00:05:13.700 
use this for let's say you have a church
event<00:05:10.650> or<00:05:10.889> you<00:05:10.979> have<00:05:11.190> a<00:05:11.870> play<00:05:12.870> at<00:05:13.110> school<00:05:13.440> where

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:13.710 
event or you have a play at school where

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:15.710 
event or you have a play at school where
you<00:05:13.800> want<00:05:13.979> to<00:05:14.039> set<00:05:14.220> up<00:05:14.250> a<00:05:14.430> bunch<00:05:14.699> of<00:05:14.820> TVs<00:05:15.270> and

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:15.720 
you want to set up a bunch of TVs and

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:17.930 
you want to set up a bunch of TVs and
have<00:05:16.410> them<00:05:16.590> all<00:05:16.710> broadcasting<00:05:17.550> the<00:05:17.699> same

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:17.940 
have them all broadcasting the same

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:21.080 
have them all broadcasting the same
thing<00:05:18.330> on<00:05:18.630> stage<00:05:19.289> for<00:05:19.650> example<00:05:20.099> you<00:05:20.820> could<00:05:20.970> use

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:21.090 
thing on stage for example you could use

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:23.899 
thing on stage for example you could use
a<00:05:21.120> unit<00:05:21.479> like<00:05:21.599> this<00:05:21.870> to<00:05:22.080> to<00:05:22.590> to<00:05:23.099> show<00:05:23.490> the<00:05:23.699> same

00:05:23.899 --> 00:05:23.909 
a unit like this to to to show the same

a unit like this to to to show the same
thing<00:05:24.180> on<00:05:24.330> all<00:05:24.419> those<00:05:24.599> TV<00:05:24.960> sets<00:05:25.229> make<00:05:25.740> make

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:25.919 
thing on all those TV sets make make

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:29.120 
thing on all those TV sets make make
like<00:05:26.639> a<00:05:26.669> video<00:05:26.970> wall<00:05:27.240> or<00:05:27.419> something<00:05:27.750> but<00:05:28.590> as

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:29.130 
like a video wall or something but as

video disc player any laserdisc player
which<00:05:47.219> is<00:05:47.400> piping<00:05:47.789> the<00:05:47.880> signal<00:05:48.270> in<00:05:48.570> and

00:05:48.969 --> 00:05:48.979 
which is piping the signal in and

00:05:48.979 --> 00:05:51.980 
which is piping the signal in and
broadcasting<00:05:49.979> it<00:05:50.130> out<00:05:50.340> of<00:05:50.610> this<00:05:51.539> antenna

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:28.730 
regular analog tuner in them or they
would<00:06:27.060> be<00:06:27.150> a<00:06:27.180> newer<00:06:27.449> TV<00:06:27.900> that<00:06:28.139> still<00:06:28.409> happens

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:28.740 
would be a newer TV that still happens

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:32.570 
would be a newer TV that still happens
to<00:06:28.889> have<00:06:29.099> an<00:06:29.460> analog<00:06:30.060> NTSC<00:06:30.889> to<00:06:31.889> Turin<00:06:32.190> not<00:06:32.430> an

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:32.580 
to have an analog NTSC to Turin not an

to have an analog NTSC to Turin not an
ATSC<00:06:33.389> but<00:06:33.599> in<00:06:34.039> TSE<00:06:35.039> tuner<00:06:35.400> in<00:06:35.520> them<00:06:35.729> so<00:06:36.599> you

00:06:36.649 --> 00:06:36.659 
ATSC but in TSE tuner in them so you

00:06:36.659 --> 00:06:39.709 
ATSC but in TSE tuner in them so you
know<00:06:36.990> another<00:06:37.339> application<00:06:38.339> would<00:06:38.490> be<00:06:38.550> to<00:06:38.969> if

00:06:39.709 --> 00:06:39.719 
know another application would be to if

00:06:39.719 --> 00:06:40.970 
know another application would be to if
you<00:06:39.870> restore<00:06:40.289> old

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:40.980 
you restore old

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:43.640 
you restore old
visions<00:06:41.400> like<00:06:42.120> you<00:06:42.660> know<00:06:42.780> 1950s
