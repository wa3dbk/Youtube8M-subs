here<00:02:57.770> is<00:02:57.950> stay<00:02:58.310> low<00:02:58.610> if<00:02:59.150> you<00:02:59.330> get<00:02:59.480> too<00:02:59.660> high<00:02:59.690> up

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
here is stay low if you get too high up

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:02.140 
here is stay low if you get too high up
the<00:03:00.440> head<00:03:00.650> on<00:03:00.860> David's<00:03:01.280> hair<00:03:01.490> right<00:03:02.000> in

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
the head on David's hair right in

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:03.370 
the head on David's hair right in
through<00:03:02.450> the<00:03:02.540> cross<00:03:02.720> line<00:03:02.900> here<00:03:03.080> he's<00:03:03.260> gonna

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
through the cross line here he's gonna

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.440 
through the cross line here he's gonna
start<00:03:03.650> to<00:03:03.800> porcupine<00:03:04.070> he's<00:03:04.850> gonna<00:03:04.970> start<00:03:05.300> to

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
start to porcupine he's gonna start to

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:07.240 
start to porcupine he's gonna start to
stick<00:03:05.690> out<00:03:05.870> so<00:03:06.080> while<00:03:06.260> we<00:03:06.470> want<00:03:06.709> to<00:03:06.800> taper<00:03:07.010> it

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
stick out so while we want to taper it

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.250 
stick out so while we want to taper it
nicely<00:03:07.550> we<00:03:08.270> don't<00:03:08.450> want<00:03:08.600> to<00:03:08.660> run<00:03:08.810> that<00:03:08.989> taper

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
nicely we don't want to run that taper

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.979 
nicely we don't want to run that taper
up<00:03:09.620> too<00:03:09.890> high<00:03:10.100> we<00:03:10.670> come<00:03:10.880> in<00:03:11.030> at<00:03:11.150> an<00:03:11.270> angle<00:03:11.750> and

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:11.989 
up too high we come in at an angle and

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:13.540 
up too high we come in at an angle and
it's<00:03:12.140> important<00:03:12.560> to<00:03:12.650> taper<00:03:12.890> on<00:03:13.160> both<00:03:13.370> the

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:13.550 
it's important to taper on both the

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:15.580 
it's important to taper on both the

as<00:03:15.920> we<00:03:16.040> travel<00:03:16.400> up<00:03:16.580> and<00:03:16.820> also<00:03:17.239> taper<00:03:17.630> from

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
as we travel up and also taper from

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:19.570 
as we travel up and also taper from
short<00:03:18.170> to<00:03:18.320> long<00:03:18.350> as<00:03:18.650> we<00:03:18.739> travel<00:03:19.070> back<00:03:19.190> along

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:19.580 
short to long as we travel back along
