00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.279
 to prepare another super skill 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.410
 refreshing and typically exotic today 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.809
 in fact we will literally tend to the 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.480
 cuddly transforming it into a yellow state 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.280
 solid in the liquid state 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.619
 yes, you have understood rightly 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.270
 we will prepare coconut milk together 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.550
 but first I would like to give you as usual 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.670
 some general notions to understand that 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.830
 what are we going to take on the slate 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.529
 I reported the general characteristics 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.080
 coconut milk like most 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.450
 of vegetable sides does not contain lactose 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.070
 does not contain caseins which means 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.989
 which can be taken by both 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.360
 developed a sensitivity towards 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.910
 of lactose then the classic sugar 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.559
 of cow's milk both from those who have one 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.079
 intolerance towards 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:49.020
 milk protein then does not contain 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.789
 traces of cholesterol and that's fine too 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.730
 for vegetarians 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.890
 narrow or vegan but but degree 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.350
 plant nature and absence of 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.289
 cholesterol in coconut milk at port 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.609
 many calories and a lot of fat 

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:04.920
 let's focus a little on the profile 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:08.189
 lipid of our coconut milk 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.460
 we discover that in this visit we find 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:13.680
 many fats in nature predominantly 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:16.530
 saturated among these is lauric acid 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.900
 which is a c 12 then a fatty acid a 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:22.409
 medium chain but unlike the 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:24.509
 other animal fatty acids or 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.950
 long chain fatty acids in the acid 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:31.439
 lauric acid does not affect plasma lipids 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:33.720
 moreover the lauric acid contained in the 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.189
 Coconut milk seems to contribute in 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.799
 some way to increase cholesterol 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.729
 good hdl in the blood 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.009
 for all these features 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.649
 we can say that coconut milk 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.780
 boasts potentially protective capabilities 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.360
 on cardiovascular risk what 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.220
 means prolonged intake 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:53.009
 some coconut milk can somehow 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:56.520
 reduce the development of dependent illnesses 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:59.490
 of the heart and vessels but the milk of 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.290
 coconut should be consumed with extreme 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.899
 moderation as I told you before 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.490
 this drink is highly caloric 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:09.270
 in fact 100 grams 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:11.700
 of coconut milk provide 197 kcal 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:14.099
 provided mainly by 21 percent 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.500
 fat from 2.8 percent sugar and 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:18.450
 from 2.2 percent protein 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:22.530
 also the coconut dates are also found 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.519
 about 2.1 grams of fiber per 100 grams 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.380
 of coconut milk 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:26.819
 so somehow this drink can be 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.860
 also consider some kind of 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:31.140
 hunger regulator because it increases the 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.670
 feeling of satiety 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.470
 having said that we finally discover 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.650
 together how to prepare the milk of 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:40.230
 coconut made of paper to prepare the 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:44.819
 Coconut milk is needed 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:46.890
 fresh coconut pulp about 300 grams e 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:49.739
 enough water then I do 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:53.489
 struggling to give you precise doses because 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:56.700
 here we go to part say a part of 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:59.989
 coconut and two parts of water then we see 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:03.860
 together how to calculate youth endowments 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:07.310
 first thing to do grate in coconut 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:09.900
 let's put some coconut pulp 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.670
 inside an electric grater 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.590
 or even manual if you don't have it 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:16.549
 that's fine 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.549
 let's start polar 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:23.280
 we grated 300 g of pulp of 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:27.569
 coconut and now we can too 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:30.299
 transfer it to the measuring cup because it is like there 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:33.209
 I said before we have to calculate for 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:36.150
 well the amount of water to add 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:38.489
 I always remember a part of the pulp 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:43.079
 of grated coconut and two parts of 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:47.400
 so let's see each other now and see 

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:52.739
 that here we are at the level of 800 ok therefore 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:59.220
 now we pour everything into a 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:04:03.450
 cup blender and own mo a 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:07.970
 heat the double 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:11.459
 the volume of water or one liter is 6 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:14.040
 we heated one liter and 6 of water 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:16.139
 and just bring it just 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:18.410
 at the boiling just a little you see 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:20.400
 only small bubbles are visible 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:22.320
 that's okay 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:26.820
 now let's pour our water 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:28.889
 inside the glass the water will be 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:32.340
 our solvent that will succeed to 

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:35.010
 extract the active ingredients from the matrix 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:37.199
 that is, the coconut fault we avoid 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:40.699
 put all the water in it if anything 

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:40.699
 let's put it later 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:44.750
 we whisper well 

00:04:44.819 --> 00:04:50.159
 remember that the more finely you will believe 

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:52.680
 the most nutritious coconut meat will succeed 

00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:57.810
 to extract the water from the pulp then 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:05:00.240
 we chop yes now that we have blended 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:01.590
 let's leave everything to rest 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.300
 about 20 minutes 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:05.219
 so let 's leave our pulp in 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:07.819
 will march so that always water 

00:05:05.219 --> 00:05:11.039
 is able to extract active ingredients 

00:05:07.819 --> 00:05:14.520
 after twenty minutes we can proceed with 

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:18.270
 filtration we die of threatened 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:20.490
 la with the pasta and then with a cloth 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:27.139
 clean that does not smell like detergent me 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:27.139
 then I recommend it however fails 

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:35.010
 you remember that we had obtained before 

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:37.170
 aside some water 

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:39.360
 now we can pour it inside 

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:43.020
 of the same glass for cleaning 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:50.490
 any residues because we have to 

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:53.670
 show everything ok and see that plan 

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:57.960
 slowly our coconut milk is 

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:59.730
 form and not even speed up the 

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:01.940
 filtration you can also make a 

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:01.940
 bundle 

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:10.590
 the slow going to do this 

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:14.430
 operation because if you leave a 

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:21.960
 spout of the kitchen towel open but the 

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:28.800
 pulp from the co however here is the milk 

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:31.250
 still lukewarm and clearly the problem 

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:31.250
 it's excellent 

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:37.320
 this is our coconut milk 

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:39.180
 filtered while here we find the 

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:40.800
 so-called or dear coconut so the 

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:43.919
 exhausted pulp 

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:46.970
 if you want it more clearly focused 

00:06:43.919 --> 00:06:49.440
 you have to decrease the amount of water 

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:51.600
 and instead to save even one 

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:54.210
 little on calories let's say I prefer 

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:56.640
 keep this proportion I remember one 

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:59.490
 part of coconut and two parts of water in 

00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:02.190
 volume is difficult to establish with 

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:04.230
 accuracy the calories of fat provided 

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:05.940
 from 100 grams of coconut milk made in 

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:08.700
 home because clearly we don't know 

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:11.280
 and we can't even know how many 

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:13.620
 nutrients were extracted from 

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:16.229
 pulp then from the matrix thanks to 

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:18.150
 solvent or water if you want 

00:07:16.229 --> 00:07:20.070
 make your coconut milk more 

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:22.169
 concentrate decrease the amount of 

00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:24.660
 water if you want to make it again 

00:07:22.169 --> 00:07:26.550
 lighter clearly increased the 

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:28.080
 amount of water solvent in 

00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:30.450
 this last case, however, be careful 

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:33.720
 because it is true that calories would be 

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:35.460
 lower but it is also true that yours 

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:37.320
 Coconut milk would also help it a little 

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:39.570
 coconut milk is watered down 

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:41.460
 excellent as a refreshing drink for 

00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:45.620
 summer but can also be used for 

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:45.620
 prepare size on a fighting way
