00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.040 
course let's put it that way final
thought<00:03:54.220> now<00:03:54.400> on<00:03:54.580> the<00:03:54.700> book<00:03:54.850> I<00:03:55.150> mean<00:03:55.570> what<00:03:55.959> is

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:56.050 
thought now on the book I mean what is

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:57.600 
thought now on the book I mean what is
the<00:03:56.110> one<00:03:56.260> thing<00:03:56.290> that<00:03:56.500> readers<00:03:57.280> should<00:03:57.400> come

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:57.610 
the one thing that readers should come

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:02.280 
the one thing that readers should come
and<00:03:57.730> look<00:03:57.850> for<00:03:58.030> in<00:03:58.120> this<00:03:58.239> book<00:03:59.070> I<00:04:01.080> just<00:04:02.080> hope

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.290 
and look for in this book I just hope

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:03.990 
and look for in this book I just hope
that<00:04:02.590> different<00:04:03.160> people<00:04:03.520> find<00:04:03.700> different

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 
that different people find different

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.190 
that different people find different
things<00:04:04.150> in<00:04:04.270> the<00:04:04.360> book<00:04:04.510> and<00:04:04.840> that's<00:04:04.989> what

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:05.200 
things in the book and that's what

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.440 
things in the book and that's what
usually<00:04:05.350> happens<00:04:05.920> some<00:04:06.730> people<00:04:07.030> who<00:04:07.120> read<00:04:07.330> it

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:07.450 
usually happens some people who read it

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:08.850 
usually happens some people who read it
for<00:04:07.600> romance<00:04:07.930> some<00:04:08.200> people<00:04:08.530> will<00:04:08.680> hopefully

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:08.860 
for romance some people will hopefully

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:11.520 
for romance some people will hopefully
read<00:04:09.459> it<00:04:09.610> for<00:04:09.790> humor<00:04:10.360> that's<00:04:10.900> how<00:04:11.020> it<00:04:11.170> works<00:04:11.380> so

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:11.530 
read it for humor that's how it works so

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:14.070 
read it for humor that's how it works so
for<00:04:12.000> whatever<00:04:13.000> it<00:04:13.150> is<00:04:13.300> I<00:04:13.330> think<00:04:13.540> all<00:04:13.840> books

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:14.080 
for whatever it is I think all books

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:15.150 
for whatever it is I think all books
should<00:04:14.200> be<00:04:14.260> different<00:04:14.680> things<00:04:14.830> for<00:04:15.100> different

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:15.160 
should be different things for different

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.390 
should be different things for different
people<00:04:15.580> that's<00:04:15.910> what<00:04:16.120> makes<00:04:16.299> them<00:04:16.480> rich<00:04:17.400> and

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.400 
people that's what makes them rich and

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:19.830 
people that's what makes them rich and
