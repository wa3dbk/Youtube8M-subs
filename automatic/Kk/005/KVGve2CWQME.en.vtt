00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.940 

so<00:02:13.360> that<00:02:13.599> works<00:02:13.810> perfectly<00:02:14.349> where<00:02:14.620> it's<00:02:14.770> set

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
so that works perfectly where it's set

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:16.830 
so that works perfectly where it's set
right<00:02:15.160> now<00:02:15.190> is<00:02:15.550> perfect<00:02:15.760> for<00:02:16.239> my<00:02:16.510> combination

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
right now is perfect for my combination

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.710 
right now is perfect for my combination
of<00:02:17.200> guitar<00:02:17.530> and<00:02:17.800> pedal<00:02:18.580> if<00:02:18.730> you<00:02:19.030> do<00:02:19.209> need<00:02:19.420> more
