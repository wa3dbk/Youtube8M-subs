00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:03.530
 n 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:26.950
 as stadiums and that is that we are in a 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:29.560
 new tutorial for my secondary channel 

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:31.690
 those that I on YouTube and then we're 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.520
 here these are just for tutorial these 

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:35.730
 things like that, so we're going to 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.730
 start 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:43.960
 we will teach how to solve the 

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:46.240
 problem 401 which is the error of the 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.220
 connection not that is primarily based 

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:50.420
 in which it tells you that the connection 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:52.770
 example to youtube 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:55.800
 the area that I wanted 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.750
 well I explain to you right now I 'm going 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:03.430
 to say how the thing is going 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:07.220
 we are in this is it android something like this 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:10.460
 Spanish is as 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:12.680
 and I like to be seeing I'm alive 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:15.380
 because it 's very interesting and now it 's what 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.390
 that for you it is not that I am the 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.950
 youtube with more subscribers than all the 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.370
 thing but then so they are a bit 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.370
 informed 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:30.310
 when we lend to the pine symbol and 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.310
 you have to open this tab 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:34.630
 We put them to load because it is 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:37.090
 taking a little bit because I keep abandoning 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:40.450
 Well, when it comes out, not good 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:42.880
 when I go out, mark that error, do not have 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:45.880
 get into your subscriptions or see your 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:48.640
 videos or your history 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.570
 nothing or its writers nothing that does not 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.700
 you have to give him nothing 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:57.369
 and in return 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.369
 how are we in for example 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:02.859
 when we get to place thor passes 

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:05.679
 Exactly the same, you do not let yourself see 

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:09.299
 videos the game came or whatever you want 

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:13.050
 after the track so 

00:02:09.299 --> 00:02:17.240
 you will need to download this multicolored 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.240
 which is in today's here 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.870
 now I will show you how and at the end of 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.090
 video I'll show you how to download 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:31.560
 the root explorer for the characters that 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:35.600
 do not know then apt and if I think that in 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.600
 aigÃ¼es is not missing this error 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:43.099
 well, it's supposed 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.099
 I think we were behind 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:51.640
 maybe here when we are in root that 

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:54.600
 let's adjust the file 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.600
 for its meaty 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:01.810
 search do not look for it in file 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:09.500
 and another thing they have to put here says 

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:11.830
 in ere or because if not not the good in 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.830
 can find 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.930
 etc etc etc etc 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:20.160
 two facts were added 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:31.860
 and now to look for ghost file 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:31.860
 just like you are going to see right now 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:40.319
 22 I may not like it because it has not 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:42.240
 like 401 because I'm not very 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:45.470
 safe 

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:45.470
 josh rouse 

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:48.840
 well 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:54.140
 well, theoretically, they have to follow 

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:57.400
 here a file that if you 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:57.400
 we need to eliminate 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:04.900
 an example as 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:07.710
 good those that lead to ferrero that 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:07.710
 has this project 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:12.439
 for example this blood or I think not 

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:13.840
 it's good for nothing, let's see keep 

00:04:12.439 --> 00:04:18.570
 tight 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:18.570
 and we are going to give him to eliminate who he is 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:28.009
 and here I am going to tell you that you are sure of 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:34.069
 which is to eliminate but why not and that's how it is 

00:04:28.009 --> 00:04:35.720
 how would you fix the error 401 ok ya 

00:04:34.069 --> 00:04:37.699
 if they want this, they can erase it 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:40.069
 You can put your YouTube or any 

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:41.660
 google company i say goes to any 

00:04:40.069 --> 00:04:42.770
 google application and they could 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:44.270
 solve 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:47.100
 now 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:48.750
 certainly by the way you need to do 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:50.650
 root user 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:53.320
 reuters 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:56.110
 the next video that they do showing them 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:05:00.540
 how the crows come back to me root user 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:00.540
 it's quite simple I recommend them 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:09.140
 my phone is the gym is a good brand 

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:14.600
 but it's a model that I do not know which ones I think 

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:16.080
 which is the optimal 3-3-1-3 optimum 3 something 

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:19.889
 A) Yes 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:21.689
 Well, this model is pretty old 

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:24.090
 well they are not old people but it is not 

00:05:21.689 --> 00:05:25.979
 it's not very good so if I do 

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:28.259
 serves the root here because I guess that 

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:30.060
 may serve on other phones not like this 

00:05:28.259 --> 00:05:33.379
 that what would follow would be to show you how 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:33.379
 download the kidnappers 

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:38.030
 because he finished loading 

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:44.200
 I'm from is a good application is like 

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:47.450
 look similar to a store obviously 

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:49.370
 our game is nothing that can not 

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:50.710
 use the block but do not want it 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:54.830
 to update 

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:58.810
 although it should 

00:05:54.830 --> 00:06:02.120
 ok now let's look 

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:04.449
 let's find forgiveness 

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:04.449
 ruth 

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:09.889
 let's load 

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:19.460
 we're not going to give you more search if it's not 

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:23.970
 if it does not appear in that place because 

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:27.240
 this will send them to the app's page 

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:29.610
 internet toy so here they can 

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:31.740
 are more likely to find the 

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:34.350
 application that you like not suitable and 

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:36.680
 of achievement I will give a review for 

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:36.680
 your 

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:46.620
 or if you are a root user 

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:49.040
 probably because this suits you 

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:52.520
 well, it 's time 

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:54.710
 what he continues to do is loan him here in 

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:57.600
 any part 

00:06:54.710 --> 00:07:01.440
 the one in the little box obviously not 

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:04.160
 ok and then we would have to give it in 

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:04.160
 install 

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:15.470
 let's find the spheres 

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:23.070
 then nothing else we would give in install 

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.590
 and we would return to the car of the 

00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:29.670
 application not of the page remember that 

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:32.550
 once you finish loading 

00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:34.050
 they are not going to teach us a message that 

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:36.510
 is going to say that if we wish jones to the 

00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:39.090
 quickly and we're going to put it on ok 

00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:41.090
 but not me because I am I already have 

00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:43.830
 the application is that I do not require 

00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:46.470
 download it again here we hope to 

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:48.750
 I load these good on my phone 

00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:50.030
 As I said, it's very, very, very, very 

00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:54.790
 good 

00:07:50.030 --> 00:07:54.790
 but then late 

00:07:57.790 --> 00:08:02.350
 and here also this needs to be 

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:06.070
 I recommend that you put in cancel because 

00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:07.960
 this is memory, not so, so 

00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:09.940
 nothing I hope you liked in like 

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:12.680
 comment and share 

00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:15.639
 and add to your favorites 

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:15.639
 so, goodbye
