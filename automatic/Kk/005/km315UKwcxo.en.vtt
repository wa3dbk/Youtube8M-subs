00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:43.510 
spots so when we find that recharger we
will<00:01:41.329> be<00:01:41.450> able<00:01:41.509> to<00:01:41.630> get<00:01:41.869> those<00:01:41.990> back<00:01:42.429> it's<00:01:43.429> a

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 
will be able to get those back it's a

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.130 
will be able to get those back it's a
chemical<00:01:43.640> storeroom<00:01:44.240> I<00:01:44.329> think<00:01:44.569> each<00:01:44.689> deck<00:01:44.960> has

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 
chemical storeroom I think each deck has

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.399 
chemical storeroom I think each deck has
one<00:01:45.439> right<00:01:46.390> each<00:01:47.390> deck<00:01:47.719> has<00:01:47.899> a<00:01:47.929> chemical

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:48.409 
one right each deck has a chemical

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:49.779 
one right each deck has a chemical
storeroom<00:01:48.950> where<00:01:49.130> you<00:01:49.250> can<00:01:49.399> find<00:01:49.579> the

00:01:49.779 --> 00:01:49.789 
storeroom where you can find the

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:51.429 
storeroom where you can find the
resources<00:01:50.000> you<00:01:50.509> need<00:01:50.539> to<00:01:50.840> research<00:01:51.229> the

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:51.439 
resources you need to research the

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:53.050 
resources you need to research the
artifacts<00:01:51.950> you'll<00:01:52.159> find<00:01:52.399> around<00:01:52.700> the<00:01:52.789> ship

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 
artifacts you'll find around the ship

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.209 
artifacts you'll find around the ship
don't<00:01:54.020> try<00:01:54.259> to<00:01:54.289> carry<00:01:54.590> around<00:01:54.770> all<00:01:55.069> the

00:01:55.209 --> 00:01:55.219 
don't try to carry around all the

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:57.899 
don't try to carry around all the
chemicals<00:01:55.640> at<00:01:55.789> once<00:01:56.030> it's<00:01:56.750> impractical<00:01:57.319> and

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:57.909 
chemicals at once it's impractical and

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:00.910 
chemicals at once it's impractical and
unnecessary<00:01:58.909> your<00:01:59.750> research<00:02:00.140> software<00:02:00.469> will

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:00.920 
unnecessary your research software will

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.620 
unnecessary your research software will
tell<00:02:01.130> you<00:02:01.250> what<00:02:01.429> chemicals<00:02:01.880> it<00:02:02.000> needs<00:02:02.240> and

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
tell you what chemicals it needs and

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.740 
tell you what chemicals it needs and
when<00:02:03.319> I<00:02:03.819> think<00:02:04.819> the<00:02:04.909> gun<00:02:05.090> off<00:02:05.270> of<00:02:05.390> that<00:02:05.479> guy<00:02:05.689> in

when I think the gun off of that guy in

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:07.690 
when I think the gun off of that guy in
some<00:02:05.989> bullets<00:02:06.289> in<00:02:06.439> there<00:02:06.649> it's<00:02:07.340> good<00:02:07.549> to<00:02:07.640> have

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
some bullets in there it's good to have

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.009 
some bullets in there it's good to have
a<00:02:07.789> backup<00:02:08.090> considering<00:02:08.569> they<00:02:08.690> defeat

one<00:07:49.449> of<00:07:49.569> the<00:07:49.629> things<00:07:49.749> I<00:07:49.929> picked<00:07:50.080> up<00:07:50.259> before<00:07:50.619> was

00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:50.860 
one of the things I picked up before was

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:53.909 
one of the things I picked up before was
a<00:07:50.889> surgical<00:07:51.490> unit<00:07:51.849> activation<00:07:52.419> key<00:07:52.659> I<00:07:52.899> can<00:07:53.649> use

00:07:53.909 --> 00:07:53.919 
a surgical unit activation key I can use

00:07:53.919 --> 00:07:55.709 
a surgical unit activation key I can use
that<00:07:54.099> on<00:07:54.219> an<00:07:54.309> incomplete<00:07:54.849> surgical<00:07:55.300> unit<00:07:55.569> and

00:07:55.709 --> 00:07:55.719 
that on an incomplete surgical unit and

00:07:55.719 --> 00:07:57.149 
that on an incomplete surgical unit and
plug<00:07:56.199> it<00:07:56.289> in<00:07:56.409> there<00:07:56.529> and<00:07:56.589> we'll<00:07:56.979> make<00:07:57.129> it

00:07:57.149 --> 00:07:57.159 
plug it in there and we'll make it

00:07:57.159 --> 00:07:59.839 
plug it in there and we'll make it
available<00:07:57.909> for<00:07:58.209> restoring<00:07:59.050> my<00:07:59.080> house<00:07:59.319> and

00:07:59.839 --> 00:07:59.849 
available for restoring my house and

00:07:59.849 --> 00:08:02.669

here<00:08:00.849> is<00:08:01.029> the<00:08:01.270> quantum<00:08:01.749> bio<00:08:01.929> reconstruction

00:08:02.669 --> 00:08:02.679 
here is the quantum bio reconstruction

00:08:02.679 --> 00:08:04.649 
here is the quantum bio reconstruction
unit<00:08:02.800> let's<00:08:03.159> turn<00:08:03.369> it<00:08:03.490> on<00:08:03.639> a<00:08:03.819> good<00:08:04.360> place<00:08:04.569> to

00:08:04.649 --> 00:08:04.659 
unit let's turn it on a good place to

00:08:04.659 --> 00:08:06.869 
unit let's turn it on a good place to
take<00:08:04.689> a<00:08:04.809> break<00:08:05.129> so<00:08:06.129> I'll<00:08:06.279> see<00:08:06.459> you<00:08:06.550> in<00:08:06.699> five

00:08:06.869 --> 00:08:06.879 
take a break so I'll see you in five

00:08:06.879 --> 00:08:09.270 
take a break so I'll see you in five
seconds
