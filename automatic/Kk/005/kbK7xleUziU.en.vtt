tough<00:02:05.220> to<00:02:05.369> say<00:02:05.580> I<00:02:05.849> mean<00:02:06.030> field<00:02:06.959> goal<00:02:07.200> is<00:02:07.470> like

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
tough to say I mean field goal is like

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.370 
tough to say I mean field goal is like
seeing<00:02:08.250> you<00:02:08.369> so<00:02:08.580> much<00:02:08.789> focus<00:02:09.000> and<00:02:09.660> but<00:02:10.259> it's

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 
seeing you so much focus and but it's

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:11.630 
seeing you so much focus and but it's
really<00:02:10.560> like<00:02:10.740> a<00:02:10.770> golf<00:02:11.009> swing<00:02:11.130> it's<00:02:11.370> the<00:02:11.430> same

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
really like a golf swing it's the same

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.640 
really like a golf swing it's the same
stroke<00:02:11.880> every<00:02:12.060> time<00:02:12.360> it<00:02:12.720> should<00:02:12.959> be<00:02:13.170> just<00:02:13.200> a

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
stroke every time it should be just a

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.190 
stroke every time it should be just a
natural<00:02:14.069> situation<00:02:14.390> and<00:02:15.390> I<00:02:15.720> have<00:02:15.840> to<00:02:15.930> say<00:02:16.080> it's

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
natural situation and I have to say it's

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.300 
natural situation and I have to say it's
probably<00:02:16.440> more<00:02:16.770> difficult<00:02:17.190> and<00:02:17.250> more

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
probably more difficult and more

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.370 
probably more difficult and more
stressful<00:02:17.610> to<00:02:17.790> play<00:02:17.940> a<00:02:17.970> goalkeeper<00:02:18.599> there's

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
stressful to play a goalkeeper there's

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:20.900 
stressful to play a goalkeeper there's
always<00:02:19.680> there's<00:02:19.860> constant<00:02:20.310> pressure<00:02:20.490> there's

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
always there's constant pressure there's

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.430 
always there's constant pressure there's
so<00:02:21.120> much<00:02:21.270> you<00:02:21.420> have<00:02:21.540> to<00:02:21.599> be<00:02:21.690> commanding<00:02:22.230> and

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
so much you have to be commanding and

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.680 
so much you have to be commanding and
helping<00:02:23.190> your<00:02:23.310> defenders<00:02:23.730> so<00:02:23.970> I<00:02:24.209> mean<00:02:24.480> both
