still half life 2 the only problem with

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.920 
still half life 2 the only problem with
this<00:01:40.740> is<00:01:40.799> you<00:01:41.729> can't<00:01:41.970> run<00:01:42.150> it<00:01:42.270> in<00:01:42.360> full<00:01:42.750> screen

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
this is you can't run it in full screen

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.380 
this is you can't run it in full screen
or<00:01:43.200> it<00:01:43.290> crashes<00:01:43.740> and<00:01:43.920> why<00:01:44.700> doesn't<00:01:45.000> crash<00:01:45.210> it

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390

you can't read text things like that and

you can't read text things like that and
when<00:03:57.940> I<00:03:58.030> say<00:03:58.269> that<00:03:58.450> it's<00:03:58.599> just<00:03:58.810> as<00:03:58.930> bad<00:03:58.959> I<00:03:59.440> tried

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.160 
when I say that it's just as bad I tried

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.520 
when I say that it's just as bad I tried
all<00:04:00.310> sorts<00:04:00.340> of<00:04:00.610> methods<00:04:01.030> to<00:04:01.420> convert<00:04:02.349> it<00:04:02.500> to

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:02.530 
all sorts of methods to convert it to

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:03.930 
all sorts of methods to convert it to
different<00:04:02.739> formats<00:04:03.220> but<00:04:03.400> as<00:04:03.489> far<00:04:03.640> as<00:04:03.700> I<00:04:03.879> can

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:03.940 
different formats but as far as I can

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:05.160 
different formats but as far as I can
see<00:04:04.060> there's<00:04:04.239> no<00:04:04.420> way<00:04:04.599> around<00:04:04.720> it<00:04:04.989> at<00:04:05.110> the

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:05.170 
see there's no way around it at the

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:08.070 
see there's no way around it at the
moment<00:04:05.519> so<00:04:06.519> on<00:04:06.880> the<00:04:07.090> content<00:04:07.420> creation<00:04:07.690> side

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:08.080 
moment so on the content creation side

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:10.320 
moment so on the content creation side
of<00:04:08.200> things<00:04:08.349> it's<00:04:08.650> kind<00:04:09.130> of<00:04:09.310> difficult<00:04:09.610> to<00:04:09.910> do<00:04:10.150> i

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:10.330 
of things it's kind of difficult to do i

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:13.020 
of things it's kind of difficult to do i
think<00:04:10.599> i'll<00:04:10.720> be<00:04:10.780> using<00:04:10.959> windows<00:04:11.319> for<00:04:11.530> that<00:04:12.030> now

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.030 
think i'll be using windows for that now

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:15.379 
think i'll be using windows for that now
that<00:04:13.989> that's<00:04:14.290> pretty<00:04:14.470> much<00:04:14.650> it<00:04:14.709> i<00:04:14.920> suppose

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:15.389 
that that's pretty much it i suppose

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:19.050 
that that's pretty much it i suppose
side<00:04:16.389> notes<00:04:16.720> i<00:04:17.100> really<00:04:18.100> like<00:04:18.250> the<00:04:18.459> fact<00:04:18.880> it

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.060 
side notes i really like the fact it

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.030

additional<00:04:30.250> drivers<00:04:30.610> and<00:04:30.729> you<00:04:30.790> can<00:04:30.910> install

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:31.180 
additional drivers and you can install

your graphics card drivers from there it
wasn't<00:04:35.350> really<00:04:35.590> much<00:04:35.650> of<00:04:35.710> an<00:04:35.889> issue<00:04:35.979> just<00:04:36.310> have

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:36.610 
wasn't really much of an issue just have

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:37.560 
wasn't really much of an issue just have
to<00:04:36.729> click<00:04:36.970> on<00:04:37.120> it<00:04:37.240> and<00:04:37.300> there<00:04:37.450> was<00:04:37.539> a

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:37.570 
to click on it and there was a

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:39.659 
to click on it and there was a
recommended<00:04:38.050> driver<00:04:38.320> for<00:04:38.620> my<00:04:38.860> card<00:04:39.280> can't

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:39.669 
recommended driver for my card can't

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:42.420 
recommended driver for my card can't
find<00:04:39.880> it<00:04:39.970> right<00:04:40.000> now<00:04:40.830> I'm<00:04:41.830> not<00:04:42.010> sure<00:04:42.039> where<00:04:42.340> it

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:42.430 
find it right now I'm not sure where it

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:47.159 
find it right now I'm not sure where it
would<00:04:42.520> be<00:04:43.440> probably<00:04:44.440> under<00:04:45.750> well<00:04:46.750> some<00:04:46.930> I<00:04:47.020> like

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:47.169 
would be probably under well some I like

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:48.750 
would be probably under well some I like
that<00:04:47.260> anyway<00:04:47.590> I<00:04:47.770> think<00:04:48.070> it<00:04:48.340> might<00:04:48.460> be<00:04:48.490> under

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:48.760 
that anyway I think it might be under

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:51.900 
that anyway I think it might be under
system<00:04:48.940> settings<00:04:50.190> yes<00:04:51.190> it<00:04:51.400> may<00:04:51.729> you<00:04:51.789> are

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:51.910

system settings yes it may you are
additional<00:04:52.330> drivers<00:04:52.720> so<00:04:53.350> you<00:04:53.440> click<00:04:53.590> on<00:04:53.650> that

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:53.770 
additional drivers so you click on that

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:56.740 
additional drivers so you click on that
thing<00:04:54.070> searches<00:04:54.580> for<00:04:54.669> your<00:04:54.789> drivers

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:56.750 
thing searches for your drivers

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:59.170 
thing searches for your drivers

go<00:05:16.430> downstairs<00:05:16.670> to<00:05:17.180> wait<00:05:17.450> for<00:05:17.600> it<00:05:17.630> to<00:05:17.720> install

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:18.440 
go downstairs to wait for it to install

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:21.340 
go downstairs to wait for it to install
and<00:05:19.160> it<00:05:19.460> sort<00:05:19.760> of<00:05:19.790> locks<00:05:20.000> the<00:05:20.210> system<00:05:20.570> up<00:05:20.660> not

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:21.350 
and it sort of locks the system up not

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:22.570 
and it sort of locks the system up not
very<00:05:21.560> efficient<00:05:21.980> not<00:05:22.130> sure<00:05:22.280> why<00:05:22.400> that<00:05:22.430> is

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:22.580 
very efficient not sure why that is

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:24.790 
very efficient not sure why that is
could<00:05:22.880> be<00:05:22.940> my<00:05:23.210> problem<00:05:23.750> or<00:05:24.440> something<00:05:24.560> like

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:24.800 
could be my problem or something like

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:26.770 
could be my problem or something like
that<00:05:24.970> another<00:05:25.970> thing<00:05:26.180> that<00:05:26.210> does<00:05:26.450> get<00:05:26.600> on<00:05:26.630> my

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:26.780 
that another thing that does get on my

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:28.450 
that another thing that does get on my
nerves<00:05:26.990> is<00:05:27.200> if<00:05:27.470> I<00:05:27.650> want<00:05:27.800> to<00:05:27.830> play<00:05:27.980> Minecraft

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:28.460 
nerves is if I want to play Minecraft

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:30.760 
nerves is if I want to play Minecraft
for<00:05:28.640> instance<00:05:28.940> down<00:05:29.120> here<00:05:29.360> if<00:05:30.169> I<00:05:30.320> click<00:05:30.350> on<00:05:30.620> it

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:30.770 
for instance down here if I click on it

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:32.850 
for instance down here if I click on it
then<00:05:31.430> it<00:05:31.610> loads<00:05:31.700> up<00:05:31.910> the<00:05:32.030> archive<00:05:32.510> manager

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:32.860 
then it loads up the archive manager

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:35.680 
then it loads up the archive manager
like<00:05:33.860> it's<00:05:34.070> a<00:05:34.190> zip<00:05:34.340> or<00:05:34.580> something<00:05:35.510> like<00:05:35.630> that

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:35.690 
like it's a zip or something like that

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:37.510 
like it's a zip or something like that
so<00:05:35.930> I<00:05:36.440> have<00:05:36.590> to<00:05:36.680> right<00:05:36.830> click<00:05:36.860> on<00:05:37.040> it<00:05:37.160> and<00:05:37.310> go<00:05:37.400> to

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:37.520 
so I have to right click on it and go to

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:40.960 
so I have to right click on it and go to

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:45.130 
really annoying i know you can set the
default<00:05:43.520> program<00:05:44.120> but<00:05:44.480> if<00:05:44.570> you<00:05:44.660> notice<00:05:44.810> when<00:05:45.080> i
