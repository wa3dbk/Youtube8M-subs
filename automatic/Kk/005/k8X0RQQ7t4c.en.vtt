00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.200 
seen so far is the concrete foundations
being<00:02:18.540> laid<00:02:18.960> and<00:02:19.350> layered<00:02:19.890> you're<00:02:20.850> saying<00:02:21.120> you

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:21.210 
being laid and layered you're saying you

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:22.880 
being laid and layered you're saying you
could<00:02:21.390> go<00:02:21.510> much<00:02:21.750> further<00:02:21.990> than<00:02:22.170> that<00:02:22.350> and<00:02:22.680> have

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
could go much further than that and have

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.770 
could go much further than that and have
a<00:02:22.920> gigantic<00:02:23.670> machine<00:02:24.090> that<00:02:24.210> builds<00:02:24.510> the<00:02:24.630> whole

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
a gigantic machine that builds the whole

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:25.840 
a gigantic machine that builds the whole
thing<00:02:25.140> really

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
thing really

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.730 
thing really
of<00:02:26.850> course<00:02:27.600> right<00:02:28.050> what<00:02:28.320> you're<00:02:28.470> saying

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
of course right what you're saying

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.920 
of course right what you're saying
actually<00:02:28.920> is<00:02:29.340> a<00:02:29.370> machine<00:02:30.270> that<00:02:30.330> is<00:02:30.570> building

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
actually is a machine that is building

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.030 
actually is a machine that is building
full-scale<00:02:31.500> walls<00:02:31.770> and<00:02:33.230> with<00:02:34.230> many<00:02:34.740> of<00:02:34.830> these

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
full-scale walls and with many of these

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.770 
full-scale walls and with many of these
walls<00:02:35.310> of<00:02:35.550> course<00:02:35.790> you<00:02:35.880> can<00:02:36.060> construct<00:02:36.390> a

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
walls of course you can construct a

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.040 
walls of course you can construct a
house<00:02:37.140> and<00:02:37.820> this<00:02:38.820> machine<00:02:39.390> can<00:02:39.780> build

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
house and this machine can build

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.430 
house and this machine can build
monolithic<00:02:40.710> houses<00:02:41.520> buildings<00:02:42.440> with

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
monolithic houses buildings with

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.340 
monolithic houses buildings with
multiple<00:02:43.890> rooms<00:02:44.270> door<00:02:45.270> and<00:02:45.510> window<00:02:45.810> opening

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
multiple rooms door and window opening

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.580 
multiple rooms door and window opening
and<00:02:47.300> that<00:02:48.300> will<00:02:48.630> be<00:02:48.780> the<00:02:48.900> shell<00:02:49.140> of<00:02:49.290> the<00:02:49.410> house

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
and that will be the shell of the house

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.950 
and that will be the shell of the house
of<00:02:49.830> course<00:02:50.070> you<00:02:50.220> have<00:02:50.370> to<00:02:50.520> manually<00:02:51.510> install

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:51.960 
of course you have to manually install

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:56.900 
of course you have to manually install
doors<00:02:52.380> and<00:02:52.620> windows<00:02:53.040> and<00:02:53.810> then<00:02:54.810> we<00:02:55.140> have<00:02:55.910> plans

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
doors and windows and then we have plans

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.870 
doors and windows and then we have plans
for<00:02:57.150> automatic<00:02:57.870> plumbing<00:02:58.740> and<00:02:59.160> electrical

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
for automatic plumbing and electrical

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.510 
for automatic plumbing and electrical
network<00:03:00.360> installation<00:03:01.170> and<00:03:01.410> even<00:03:02.160> finish

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:02.520 
network installation and even finish

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:07.640 
network installation and even finish
work<00:03:02.820> and<00:03:03.290> tiling<00:03:04.400> so<00:03:05.400> our<00:03:06.330> vision<00:03:06.660> is<00:03:07.050> total

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
work and tiling so our vision is total

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.040 
work and tiling so our vision is total
automation<00:03:08.190> of<00:03:08.250> building<00:03:08.640> construction

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:09.050 
automation of building construction

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:11.870 
automation of building construction
eventually<00:03:10.050> do<00:03:10.410> you<00:03:10.650> have<00:03:11.010> any<00:03:11.310> patent

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
eventually do you have any patent

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:17.210 
eventually do you have any patent
yourself<00:03:12.540> on<00:03:12.810> this<00:03:13.200> did<00:03:13.800> you<00:03:13.950> invent<00:03:14.370> this<00:03:16.190> yes

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
yourself on this did you invent this yes

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.990 
yourself on this did you invent this yes
I<00:03:17.570> initiated<00:03:18.570> the<00:03:18.690> idea<00:03:18.810> and<00:03:19.530> I<00:03:20.100> have<00:03:20.310> over<00:03:20.610> 20

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
I initiated the idea and I have over 20

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.420 
I initiated the idea and I have over 20
patent<00:03:21.420> summit<00:03:21.780> yeah<00:03:22.560> I'm<00:03:22.860> sorry<00:03:23.130> I<00:03:23.220> was

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
patent summit yeah I'm sorry I was

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.520 
patent summit yeah I'm sorry I was
distracted<00:03:24.090> for<00:03:24.450> a<00:03:24.540> moment<00:03:24.750> you<00:03:24.810> have<00:03:24.960> over<00:03:25.170> 20

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
distracted for a moment you have over 20

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.480 
distracted for a moment you have over 20
patents<00:03:26.010> did<00:03:26.160> you<00:03:26.250> say<00:03:27.170> yes<00:03:28.400> you're<00:03:29.400> gonna

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:29.490 
patents did you say yes you're gonna

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:36.590 
patents did you say yes you're gonna
make<00:03:29.670> a<00:03:29.700> lot<00:03:29.880> of<00:03:29.910> money<00:03:32.180> well<00:03:34.460> maybe<00:03:35.460> but<00:03:35.910> my

make a lot of money well maybe but my

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.670 
make a lot of money well maybe but my
objective<00:03:37.260> is<00:03:37.380> really<00:03:37.410> to<00:03:37.740> make<00:03:38.730> an<00:03:38.910> impact

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
objective is really to make an impact
