00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:05.300
 to be all welcome a week 

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:08.840
 more in the extreme schuster videos 

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:11.750
 road to riaza you are following us today 

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:13.639
 I have to explain a few things for 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:15.410
 example the last weeks I'm in 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:17.630
 madrid because this car is not in the theater 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:20.239
 fine arts with santi millÃ¡n we are already 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:22.369
 there and what happens I keep training or follow 

00:00:20.239 --> 00:00:24.769
 Giving or running but I can not 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:26.179
 service because it does not take you until this 

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:28.550
 weekend that I'm going to do a series 

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:31.339
 by bike and I'll do you know where in riad 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:33.590
 because I'm going to recognize the route 

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:36.290
 is a little ball of nobody and does me little 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:39.350
 the bike to opi for the one lap that is 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:41.690
 a 45 km and so I already know how are the 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.520
 trees the climbs the descents and already with 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.329
 that with doing the tour because I already 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:49.039
 I have 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:52.429
 guarantees to finish and does not explain anything 

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:54.980
 good that I can explain more in this 

00:00:52.429 --> 00:00:57.290
 set aside the issue of bars and ceres 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:59.329
 because they explained to me that you are adapting 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:00.980
 to all this little by little so that the 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:04.070
 body the seeds of the product be 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.489
 good to be told it is the beginning 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:09.649
 body 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:11.689
 if I do not put you goal but I'm going to a lot and 

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:13.620
 how are you adapting can you click 

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:16.050
 convoy and in the afternoon 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:17.760
 happend we lay three bars one 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:20.190
 pair of gels we are 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:23.610
 and the truth is that we are adapting little 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:25.230
 to little that more I can explain to you before 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.120
 to go to madrid I was training in the 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:30.180
 maresme that is where he trains 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:32.910
 Normally when I'm in Barcelona and 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.800
 I found a heat responsible for 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:36.270
 triathletes between who threw me a cable me 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.690
 explained the subject of respirations and 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.270
 I breathed every four 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:44.060
 he told me there are very few breaths 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.740
 take respite every three that happens it 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.150
 it's weird and raising your head to 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.910
 two different for left it costs me 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:51.830
 a little but good little by little then I 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:53.720
 I adapt that I can tell you that 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:56.210
 this weekend I'll be an address 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.800
 in theater but also train by sea 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.810
 and if someone wants to come by madrilla 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:02.270
 correctly, I know this route 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.520
 which is perfect because I love myself 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.979
 I adapt adapted to everything 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:09.200
 if I have to adapt to your rhythm 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:12.530
 because I'm not getting very strong by 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.420
 example I lie to change the sin that 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.230
 this chest has always cost me what 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:20.010
 that I'm going to have the truth is that 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:22.920
 it is logical that I understand and put what is 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:25.470
 the training of today or every day I do a 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.720
 shirt with what I have to train 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.610
 because because I have these forces that 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.209
 you can add for example in this respect to 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.580
 last video 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:35.350
 to say goodbye to me 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:38.260
 that today I think your ass is not for 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:40.810
 so much already reaches that conclusion 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.930
 you are thinking I have seen how it is 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:45.799
 putting mine 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.799
 yes 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:52.180
 I'm sorry guys I propose a challenge 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:54.070
 subject that now I do not know how to square 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.820
 but I'll leave it for the next 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:58.820
 video 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:58.820
 ah
