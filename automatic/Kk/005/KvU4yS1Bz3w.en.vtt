00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.570 
open as I did tell you about earlier on
last<00:00:30.509> month<00:00:30.840> I<00:00:31.020> do<00:00:31.080> believe<00:00:31.680> it<00:00:31.919> was<00:00:32.220> now<00:00:32.520> we

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:32.580 
last month I do believe it was now we

last month I do believe it was now we
have<00:00:32.880> the<00:00:33.060> mikromasch<00:00:33.840> you<00:00:34.020> want<00:00:34.200> to<00:00:34.320> open

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:34.740 
have the mikromasch you want to open

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:37.490 
have the mikromasch you want to open
first<00:00:35.010> this<00:00:35.610> is<00:00:35.670> all<00:00:36.060> ready<00:00:36.450> to<00:00:36.690> go<00:00:36.840> so<00:00:37.170> all<00:00:37.380> we

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
first this is all ready to go so all we

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.310 
first this is all ready to go so all we
need<00:00:37.650> to<00:00:37.710> do<00:00:37.920> is<00:00:38.100> look<00:00:38.400> for<00:00:38.750> number<00:00:39.750> one<00:00:39.960> there

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
need to do is look for number one there

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.340 
need to do is look for number one there
is<00:00:40.590> number<00:00:40.829> one<00:00:41.100> so<00:00:41.370> let's<00:00:41.579> see<00:00:41.940> what<00:00:42.840> we<00:00:43.110> get

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
is number one so let's see what we get

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.430 
is number one so let's see what we get
behind<00:00:44.100> a<00:00:44.700> number<00:00:45.180> one<00:00:45.360> there<00:00:45.900> is<00:00:46.020> a<00:00:46.050> code

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
behind a number one there is a code

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.630 
behind a number one there is a code
there<00:00:46.890> as<00:00:47.100> well

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
there as well

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.960 
there as well
I'm<00:00:48.060> not<00:00:48.300> sure<00:00:48.540> if<00:00:48.720> that<00:00:48.750> code<00:00:49.200> is<00:00:49.590> for<00:00:50.490> three

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:50.970 
I'm not sure if that code is for three

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:55.880 
I'm not sure if that code is for three
rocks<00:00:51.390> or<00:00:52.260> not<00:00:52.860> but<00:00:53.130> if<00:00:53.310> you<00:00:53.460> can<00:00:53.670> see<00:00:54.090> us<00:00:54.890> take

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
rocks or not but if you can see us take

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.440 
rocks or not but if you can see us take
that<00:00:56.220> code<00:00:56.670> and<00:00:57.630> see<00:00:57.900> if<00:00:57.990> it<00:00:58.110> works<00:00:58.440> online<00:00:59.450> for

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:00.450 
that code and see if it works online for

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:04.399 
that code and see if it works online for
three<00:01:00.930> rocks<00:01:01.770> as<00:01:02.640> I<00:01:02.820> assume<00:01:03.180> it's<00:01:03.390> mating<00:01:03.870> so

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
three rocks as I assume it's mating so

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.730 
three rocks as I assume it's mating so
let's<00:01:04.589> take<00:01:04.949> our<00:01:05.220> micro<00:01:05.909> Moshe<00:01:06.150> out<00:01:06.509> of<00:01:07.439> the

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
let's take our micro Moshe out of the

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.120 
let's take our micro Moshe out of the
calendar<00:01:08.250> if<00:01:08.460> that<00:01:09.270> sees<00:01:09.540> its<00:01:10.229> fulfill<00:01:10.619> comets

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
calendar if that sees its fulfill comets

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.600 
calendar if that sees its fulfill comets
is<00:01:11.820> proving<00:01:12.270> very<00:01:12.299> difficult<00:01:13.140> to<00:01:13.860> get<00:01:14.130> out<00:01:14.400> of

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
is proving very difficult to get out of

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.120 
is proving very difficult to get out of
this<00:01:14.850> okay<00:01:15.810> so<00:01:15.869> now<00:01:16.200> I'm<00:01:16.320> back<00:01:16.679> with<00:01:16.979> the

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
this okay so now I'm back with the

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.099 
this okay so now I'm back with the
calendar<00:01:17.399> so<00:01:17.700> guys<00:01:17.909> had<00:01:18.179> to<00:01:18.329> go<00:01:18.359> off<00:01:18.749> camera

00:01:19.099 --> 00:01:19.109

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:22.010 
calendar so guys had to go off camera
for<00:01:19.409> that<00:01:19.439> because<00:01:20.070> it<00:01:20.820> was<00:01:21.090> extremely

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
for that because it was extremely

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.209 
for that because it was extremely
difficult<00:01:22.460> to<00:01:23.460> remove<00:01:23.729> this<00:01:24.090> little<00:01:24.810> guy<00:01:25.219> from

00:01:26.209 --> 00:01:26.219 
difficult to remove this little guy from

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:28.279

quite a good one quite awesome I usually
are<00:02:01.350> there<00:02:01.590> he's<00:02:01.799> number<00:02:02.549> one<00:02:02.819> so<00:02:03.090> let's<00:02:03.299> open

00:02:03.559 --> 00:02:03.569 
are there he's number one so let's open

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:08.029 
are there he's number one so let's open
this<00:02:04.139> up<00:02:04.350> and<00:02:05.249> see<00:02:05.789> what<00:02:05.819> we<00:02:06.209> get<00:02:06.679> inside<00:02:07.679> we<00:02:07.889> do

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
this up and see what we get inside we do

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.150 
this up and see what we get inside we do
have<00:02:08.069> ourselves<00:02:08.399> an<00:02:09.060> astromech<00:02:09.479> droid<00:02:10.200> there

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
have ourselves an astromech droid there

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.230 
have ourselves an astromech droid there
it<00:02:11.520> is<00:02:11.910> there<00:02:12.180> is<00:02:12.270> a<00:02:12.300> code<00:02:12.660> on<00:02:12.870> there<00:02:13.050> as<00:02:13.200> well

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:14.240 
it is there is a code on there as well

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:18.199 
it is there is a code on there as well
so<00:02:15.240> if<00:02:15.480> you<00:02:15.630> want<00:02:15.810> to<00:02:15.870> take<00:02:16.140> that<00:02:16.560> code<00:02:17.209> I'm

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
so if you want to take that code I'm

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:21.589 
so if you want to take that code I'm
quite<00:02:18.480> sure<00:02:18.720> that<00:02:18.750> will<00:02:19.170> unlock<00:02:19.590> a<00:02:19.650> stuff<00:02:20.280> on<00:02:21.239> a

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599
