00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:19.440
 well here we are in the process of 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:21.520
 manufacture of the term cell 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:25.690
 Different give a few characteristics 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:27.700
 different will allow us to do the 

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:31.270
 ultrasound we need to break 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:33.700
 the molecule of cava and generated in a 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:35.940
 way more efficient happens with high 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:38.070
 voltage and 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:43.190
 obviously a company below 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.190
 one of the empires 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:49.670
 Imagine 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.670
 Y 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:53.830
 there is not a tail much 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:06.640
 we found here 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:06.640
 making a conical cell 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.360
 there is power 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:33.479
 look for yourself the other is not there is what 

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:36.869
 it's good that I'm happy because you 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:42.740
 you are producing very good 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:42.740
 and there and here of the diet to the cove 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.640
 is that here is the big projection 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.030
 I got nervous 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.560
 the nerves 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.690
 let's learn a piece of paper 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.870
 so the person pays one hour to the 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.870
 candle 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.460
 is one exploits at par and immediately 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:36.160
 good here just be the two 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:40.390
 large dominate in distilled water in 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:44.800
 This jar is 12 volts with a 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:47.050
 fourth in case between amperes I can 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.300
 believe that there is a 10% vinegar is not 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:51.940
 certain don Luis and suddenly a little 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:54.520
 less but let's say that 10% or less 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:57.280
 and we see the amount of hydrogen that 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:03:00.430
 vote is really we have to investigate 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:02.530
 why then we wanted to look to see and the 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:05.680
 consumption is strong or is the electrolyte or 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:08.020
 the vinegar as active electrolyte the 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.210
 water but we do not know what kind of 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:12.640
 hydrogen can really be 

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:16.330
 producing manhattan give us candelas 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:20.860
 of 12 volts 3 amps be 36 watts and 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:22.380
 it's bouncing a lot more people 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:27.180
 sparks 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:31.490
 the spark they create in you good here 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:34.110
 we see the consumption that is very good 

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:37.470
 yes from the cell 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:39.830
 but let's remember that he has this 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:42.530
 no electrolyte and there is no neutral 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:44.940
 in the pear it will surely be high 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:49.020
 but we're trying water 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:51.870
 distilled the other the other cell that 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:54.630
 we have here and with 12 for water 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:58.530
 hot if we see it and there there there as 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:04:01.010
 corrosion things very little there are there 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:03.019
 corrosion 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:05.150
 but very little that we think it can 

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:08.360
 be the wire is not wire that is 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:10.099
 here because then we do not really observe 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:11.420
 that the same accident was the most 

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:13.930
 sure it's wire we've already changed 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:18.519
 the hardware in stainless steel 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:18.519
 Well these are the tests for now 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:31.440
 well here we just where I 

00:04:27.539 --> 00:04:34.530
 connect the 12 cups at 0 with and 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:36.449
 with we put them first at 36 volts and 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:38.039
 that burned us the cable right now what 

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:40.169
 we have 12 volts there has a 

00:04:38.039 --> 00:04:44.490
 vinegar and water mixture 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:48.690
 50% demineralized and the amperage 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:50.370
 is at 2 amps if then there is very 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:53.240
 good production obviously, there is no 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:55.950
 neutral is like that 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:58.740
 there are no neutrals there 

00:04:55.950 --> 00:05:00.210
 very good production and then I already 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:02.190
 we change all the nuts 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:04.260
 screws to that to be born in 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:08.550
 everything they should do stainless then 

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:10.850
 Well, if the steel really is as it says 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:12.960
 So then we will not have there 

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:15.540
 elements there is corruption too 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:18.630
 corrosion or anything like that ok ok 

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:20.300
 very good production 

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:22.620
 and so far we have not seen corruption 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:26.150
 that obviously the water is going to put 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:26.150
 good hot not ok
