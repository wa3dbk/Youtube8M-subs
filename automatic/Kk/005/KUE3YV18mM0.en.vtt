00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.299
 exception well back flavia is like 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.639
 you always brought us so many colors and no 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.710
 so many colors for a particular flower 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.710
 what flower brought us today presents you 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.480
 slabs lizia which is a flower with its own 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.300
 very particular line with colors 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.490
 very marked like purple sun oranges 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.970
 blue and is a flower that comes from the south 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:26.220
 africa to in that list born one 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.500
 part of me comes here to study a little 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.570
 africa the door after and study a name 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.700
 particularly a bit particular 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.100
 we especially say the minimum lines from 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.140
 such a sense of royal is not really 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.000
 beautiful linear is a name that derives 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.950
 just from the name of a queen among 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.800
 the other also in Europe has arrived 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.600
 around the eighteenth century in the 1700s it was 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.610
 one of the qualities one of the varieties 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.620
 sorry for this flower was called 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.480
 strelitzia reggina in an hour of the queen 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.309
 of England of the time 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.530
 giorgio iii charlotte's wife 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.109
 straits therefore just the surname in 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:01.079
 reality and its meaning recalls 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:03.210
 just the nobility and presents itself in 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.379
 form as well as in the name but before 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.060
 go and see not just one 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.490
 composition that we will do today that 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.380
 we will be able to do even we are at 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.700
 our lady at home the parser is of 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.290
 new word a moment to giacomo 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.880
 because you also do the beautiful courses 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.770
 to learn how to make these beautiful 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.990
 compositions and real giacomo you want

 www.lav.it very simple colorful 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.720
 also the repetition daisy flowers pointit 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.829
 just like the daisies where it is 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.350
 You can obviously find the 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:36.509
 information on the courses to practice 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.060
 with these composition techniques e 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:41.100
 floral decoration also present on 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.110
 facebook the page and daisy flowers 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.700
 continue to increase i like it 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.430
 in short, we hope they are more and more 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.649
 our click already on the page 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.549
 of course, those too 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.380
 obviously they are pages 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.509
 colorful today we're going to do one 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.220
 composition but we said before that 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.990
 they were commenting with flavia not 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.880
 but as a gift not for women 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.740
 compositions for a wedding is one 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:05.040
 what we say maybe a little more practical for 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.780
 even every day true yes we say that 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.399
 today we work maybe on something that 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.070
 home a home maybe modern home 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.870
 young you can safely 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:15.270
 place on a table in the living room in 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.790
 an input can be carried out a a 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.320
 pain with very few gestures and with 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.420
 very few flowers because a lot of flowers 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.740
 clean very linear so you can 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.540
 work quietly even alone 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:26.970
 without saying let's combine it with others we say 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.320
 that this flower is already so beautiful 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.970
 and thanks just for having it 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.860
 brought today we're going to do this 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.780
 composition we say simple of course 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.080
 however, we also see a composition a 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.970
 little more with a complex we say i 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.800
 main steps indeed before you go 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.940
 to see the steps the elements there 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.560
 they serve to make this beautiful 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.090
 composition which are then we leave 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.770
 from the usual sponge that accompanies me 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.850
 practically always of the American 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.770
 exactly the sponge just for the 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:51.840
 wet flower arrangements like al 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:53.459
 usual and then I brought some flowers of 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.200
 strelizie in this case we will have one 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:57.180
 small composition we will use 1 but then 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.530
 how did we lead to examples of 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.670
 I usually work so hopefully 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:03.780
 35 elements of aspidistra leaves 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:06.120
 these are also the very leaves 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.640
 common readily available that last 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.350
 lots of it lends itself to many 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:12.810
 manipulations and then I took gods 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:14.580
 lametini di ruscus garden another green 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.630
 on the same shade as the gr leaves of 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:17.880
 aspidistra that there will be some 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:19.230
 movement to work all goes 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:22.470
 we will complete with some very small ones 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:23.880
 twigs of twisted hazel I have 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:26.239
 bring some very small ones for the 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:28.739
 our work and who go so 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:30.450
 hug our flowers to give them 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:32.430
 this continuous that among other things also 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:34.410
 let's say these hazel moments with 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.690
 remember a bit the season notes that 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:38.070
 we are just there and entered 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.900
 in the car we arrive in some 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:41.310
 very good intention because a flower 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.900
 which we say in nature blooms 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:45.120
 therefore from autumn to spring it is 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.180
 let's just say at the doors of the season 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.950
 even if then as usual in 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:50.239
 we say in the market we find it all 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:52.219
 the year because then we say the 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:54.439
 production is so started that it is 

00:03:52.219 --> 00:03:56.420
 readily available to everyone is more or 

00:03:54.439 --> 00:03:59.719
 less almost all the whole year and it is 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:02.060
 we easily say you can keep with 

00:03:59.719 --> 00:04:04.189
 tranquility or needs many of 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:06.079
 a lot of attention is not a durable flower 

00:04:04.189 --> 00:04:08.120
 you simply need to change them with a 

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:12.109
 tropical flower so that's fine 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:13.310
 we also say in warm environments then 

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:14.359
 even in an apartment now when 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:16.759
 the radiators are not switched on either 

00:04:14.359 --> 00:04:18.889
 for instance and in the specific case 

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:20.389
 of the sponge will be enough to tuck a little the 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:21.949
 my water add water after 23 

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:22.849
 days that the work was done and the 

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:24.380
 confession will accompany us 

00:04:22.849 --> 00:04:26.060
 quietly for a week that 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:28.160
 ten days to do without big 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:30.710
 Problems with us now we start a 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:32.030
 compose it yes then it started let's say 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:33.740
 taking my container I have 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:34.190
 chosen for this work a vase in 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:35.840
 glass 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:37.400
 clearly the container you can 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.750
 choose a discretion or expected 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.270
 this to let you catch a glimpse of that 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:42.949
 which will then be the base or from the leaf 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:44.300
 which will decorate that will cover ours 

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:46.610
 sponge 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:48.470
 I decide to work it in a way we say 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:50.449
 so asymmetric a little shifted respect 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:52.430
 in the center of the container and then 

00:04:50.449 --> 00:04:52.699
 my triangle cut my baron 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:54.349
 ok 

00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:56.539
 I point out that within the 

00:04:54.349 --> 00:04:58.699
 container or placed a small 

00:04:56.539 --> 00:05:01.070
 support this green that I brought 

00:04:58.699 --> 00:05:02.870
 we also say to himself that he is a pine 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:04.340
 of which I find a sponge block as if 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:06.110
 also wanted to work on a plate 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:07.880
 it would be enough to attack this 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:09.139
 let's say plastic holder and I could 

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:11.150
 work quietly even without a 

00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:13.340
 container that will work already has 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:14.720
 also under the adhesive just esa dog 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:16.789
 in short, the first film is if 

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:18.680
 attacked evenings adheres to the base of 

00:05:16.789 --> 00:05:19.729
 perfect experiential work nava 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:21.740
 we announce our working phase 

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:23.780
 I cut the stem of the leaf it was sending 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:26.860
 blacks gives us a terminal part for more 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:26.860
 what else to create a straight line 

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:31.340
 cut a little bit more because the part 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:36.050
 very stiff terminal rib 

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:39.290
 so I'm going to digest it slightly and 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:43.820
 then I simply adhere to the 

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:46.220
 sponge to all around the leaf in 

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:48.320
 all around ours to block 

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:50.450
 the leaf use of small hairpins 

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:52.520
 made with sine qua iron wires 

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:53.840
 the wire was clearly a 

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:55.490
 along I cut a little piece and it 

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:57.350
 fatah head exact user and I go to 

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:59.690
 make this your own type to fix 

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:01.700
 the threshold on the exact shell here I go to 

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:05.540
 cut the excess part on the 

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:08.750
 edge will go from within the year 

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:11.390
 in the meantime let's create this short 

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:14.180
 no sponge cover 

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:16.160
 the meaning of this flower which is the 

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:17.750
 special moment maybe when you 

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:20.060
 league are not moreno than in the rose 

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:22.820
 symbolizes the red rose symbolizes 

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:26.750
 love plates starts what then how 

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:28.340
 liliana therefore we give ourselves say in every 

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:29.600
 in short, like all flowers 

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:31.400
 so any good opportunity to give 

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:33.440
 let's remember a flower first 

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:35.300
 men since you hear so every 

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:36.890
 opportunity is good to give flowers 

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:38.600
 let's say that regarding i 

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:42.160
 meanings beyond that point of 

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:42.160
 nobility of never been
