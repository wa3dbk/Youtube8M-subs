at the same time we don't need to get
too<00:04:00.330> down<00:04:00.540> about<00:04:00.720> it<00:04:00.959> I<00:04:01.459> think<00:04:02.459> we<00:04:02.610> just<00:04:02.760> have

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
too down about it I think we just have

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:05.060 
too down about it I think we just have
to<00:04:03.060> move<00:04:03.360> forward<00:04:03.600> and<00:04:04.049> you<00:04:04.410> know<00:04:04.530> like<00:04:04.739> I<00:04:04.829> said

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:05.070 
to move forward and you know like I said

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:06.740 
to move forward and you know like I said
try<00:04:05.280> to<00:04:05.340> pull<00:04:05.549> some<00:04:05.760> some<00:04:06.120> big<00:04:06.269> lessons<00:04:06.630> from

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
try to pull some some big lessons from

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.120 
try to pull some some big lessons from
this<00:04:06.870> game<00:04:07.079> and<00:04:07.290> just<00:04:07.410> try<00:04:07.620> to<00:04:07.650> be<00:04:07.799> better<00:04:07.920> the

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 
this game and just try to be better the

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:09.949 
this game and just try to be better the
next<00:04:08.160> time<00:04:08.430> it's<00:04:08.850> as<00:04:08.940> simple<00:04:09.060> as<00:04:09.239> that<00:04:09.329> I<00:04:09.630> think

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
next time it's as simple as that I think

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:11.569 
next time it's as simple as that I think
that<00:04:10.019> you<00:04:10.709> know<00:04:10.799> you<00:04:10.890> have<00:04:11.010> to<00:04:11.070> stay<00:04:11.220> steady

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:11.579 
that you know you have to stay steady

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:13.490 
that you know you have to stay steady
especially<00:04:12.030> mentally<00:04:12.390> as<00:04:12.510> a<00:04:12.540> team<00:04:12.810> and<00:04:13.049> if<00:04:13.410> we

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
especially mentally as a team and if we

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.050 
especially mentally as a team and if we
keep<00:04:13.650> doing<00:04:13.709> that<00:04:14.070> you<00:04:14.580> know<00:04:14.700> I<00:04:14.730> think<00:04:14.849> we'll

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
keep doing that you know I think we'll

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:16.339 
keep doing that you know I think we'll
be<00:04:15.090> where<00:04:15.360> we<00:04:15.450> want<00:04:15.599> to<00:04:15.660> be<00:04:15.720> at<00:04:15.989> the<00:04:16.080> end<00:04:16.229> of<00:04:16.260> the

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:16.349 
be where we want to be at the end of the
