00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:07.799
 hello my friends my name 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:12.599
 Yevhen Lykov today want to share 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:14.219
 so that I love and so that I can and so I 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.520
 I want to step by step show how to knit 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:21.240
 crochet motif for fillet tablecloth for 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:24.810
 cover first I dial a chain of 8 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:29.820
 air loops and connect it so 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:35.910
 a ring further 3 lifting loops and 3 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:40.559
 double crochet in this ring plus 3 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:43.200
 air loops 4 double crochets 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:46.829
 plus 3 air loops 4 posts with 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:50.010
 nakida 3 air loops + 4 columns with 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:53.129
 double crochet and 3 air loops and a pillar 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:57.480
 without nakida we connect the first row here 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:01:01.800
 so it should turn out and you then 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:06.119
 I dial 3 lifting loops 3 columns with 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:07.049
 double crochet and two double crochets in this 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.010
 Arochka 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:14.369
 further 3 air loops 8 columns with 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:17.280
 nakida plus 3 air loops and 8 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:20.340
 double crochet of these four 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:24.090
 the bases do not need to cut four rhombus 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:27.920
 The first row of the base of the robe consists of 4 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:32.400
 double crochets in the second row can 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:34.680
 expands it turns out 8 bars with 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:38.430
 nakida each side 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:40.740
 Well, I finished the second from the same 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:44.579
 way but by 12 columns with 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:46.500
 nakida plus 3 air loops + 12 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:49.549
 double crochet with 3 air columns 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:52.970
 loop I'm tying the third row 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:56.399
 worlds expand even more 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:59.909
 fourth row according to the scheme I knit 3 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:03.299
 lift loops 9 double crochets plus 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:05.680
 3 air loops 16 double crochets 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:08.420
 plus with air loop 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:12.580
 16 double crochets and so on 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:14.030
 Row that is, the damage further expands 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.360
 front row 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:21.739
 there were 4 double crochets in the second 8 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:25.430
 third 12 double crochet 4 16 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:30.380
 columns in the fifth row I start 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:34.209
 reduce the sides of the rhombus and so 5 row 3 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:38.860
 lift loops 7 double crochets plus 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:40.390
 5 air loops 3 double crochets 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:44.030
 in the archway 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:48.230
 plus 3 air loops 3 columns with 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:51.380
 nakida again in this arch and 5 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:54.980
 air loops + 12 posts with 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:57.799
 nakida and new 5 air loops 3 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:00.709
 double crochet in the arch 3 air 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:03.530
 loops 3 double crochets in the same arch 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:07.489
 5 air loops 12 posts with 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:10.940
 nakida and in a circle until the end of the row 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:14.570
 so here is this motive on stage 5 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:18.500
 Row 3 lift loops + 5 posts with 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:21.500
 nakida plus 5 air loops I will do 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:25.790
 I make one arch and 5 air loops 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:28.940
 the second couple and the new three columns with 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:31.250
 nakida plus 3 air loops + 3 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:35.600
 double crochet plus 5 air 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:39.140
 loops + 5 air loops and 8 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:40.160
 double crochet and so I did 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:45.590
 sixth row 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:47.810
 in finished form, it looks like this 7 row 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:50.600
 I start with 3 lifting loops 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:54.290
 three double crochets and here already 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:59.109
 I make patriarchies with 5 air loops 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:04:03.109
 each and the seventh row need to finish so 

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:03.980
 two air loops and a column with two 

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:07.940
 naquids 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:10.900
 to stay off the edge of the party on her 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:14.269
 the middle of this arch 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:16.250
 I knit 5 air loops and 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:19.549
 connect and 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:22.670
 on their next single crochet 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:24.530
 the arch, I kind of make a bridge over 

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:28.400
 the base of my rhombus 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:33.230
 oh as shown on this my photo further 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:37.520
 3 archives on 5 air loops + 3 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:41.060
 double crochet and in the corner of my motive 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:44.090
 I already have 3 air loops again 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:48.020
 air loops on three columns with 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:51.410
 nakidom in the same arch plus all the arches on 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:55.610
 5 air loops + 3 columns with 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:59.000
 nakida 5 air loops this one 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:02.390
 my mother's side so we go for 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:05.360
 Now I have finished 8 row again 

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:06.260
 two air loops and a column with two 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:09.130
 naquids 

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:12.140
 to stay on top orfen 

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:14.930
 finishing row in mouth over diamond tops 

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:17.660
 I knit 5 double crochets 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:21.919
 I make a picot of three air loops 

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:25.729
 5 more double crochets in the same arch 

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:28.190
 as shown in this photo by a column without 

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:32.300
 nakida and fixed on top 

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:35.240
 next arch and next i do too 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:37.430
 the most like double crochet sticks of 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:40.430
 three air loops 5 posts with 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:44.180
 nakidom corner arch 

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:48.740
 I do like this 5 double crochets 

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:51.110
 easy to 5 double crochets and to 5 

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:53.960
 columns with sc and then I 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:58.040
 I attach a single crochet to 

00:05:53.960 --> 00:06:01.250
 next arch and next I again 

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:04.280
 knit 5 double crochet peaks 

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:05.000
 5 crochets and so knit 

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:09.020
 whole row 

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:11.540
 but do not forget about the corners of his mother there 5 

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:15.140
 double crochet columns with 5 bars 

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:16.700
 nakidom pike 5 double crochets 

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:21.710
 I got a motive 

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:24.770
 I cut the thread and hide this motive 

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:25.460
 tied 2 tablecloths get pretty 

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:27.280
 not bad 

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:30.580
 you can say 

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:33.550
 either a tablecloth or a dependency cover 

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:35.889
 whatever yarn you have 

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:38.169
 what material resources do you have and 

00:06:35.889 --> 00:06:41.410
 because in modern times the yarn 

00:06:38.169 --> 00:06:45.010
 it is very expensive and so 

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:48.180
 keep creating and good luck to you health 

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:48.180
 love and success
