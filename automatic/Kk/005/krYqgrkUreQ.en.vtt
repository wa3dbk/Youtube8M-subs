all<00:00:02.070> day<00:00:02.310> dr.<00:00:03.770> this<00:00:04.770> movements<00:00:05.310> were

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370 
all day dr. this movements were

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:06.980 
all day dr. this movements were
strengthening<00:00:05.910> the<00:00:06.060> knee<00:00:06.240> joint<00:00:06.270> as<00:00:06.720> you<00:00:06.810> see

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
strengthening the knee joint as you see

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.049 
strengthening the knee joint as you see
I'm<00:00:07.080> stepping<00:00:07.560> across<00:00:07.740> my<00:00:08.460> knee<00:00:08.519> so<00:00:08.730> it's<00:00:08.970> like

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
I'm stepping across my knee so it's like

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.480 
I'm stepping across my knee so it's like
a<00:00:09.090> crossover<00:00:09.690> step<00:00:10.080> move<00:00:10.290> with<00:00:10.500> the<00:00:10.620> knee<00:00:10.830> so

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
a crossover step move with the knee so

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:12.980 
a crossover step move with the knee so
you<00:00:11.550> get<00:00:11.730> a<00:00:11.790> little<00:00:12.000> bit<00:00:12.179> of<00:00:12.210> a<00:00:12.389> twisting

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
you get a little bit of a twisting

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.560 
you get a little bit of a twisting
action<00:00:13.170> in<00:00:13.620> that<00:00:14.340> knee<00:00:14.549> joint<00:00:14.910> area<00:00:15.150> at<00:00:15.450> the

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
action in that knee joint area at the

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.720 
action in that knee joint area at the
same<00:00:15.780> time<00:00:16.020> I'm<00:00:16.320> going<00:00:16.650> all<00:00:16.890> the<00:00:17.100> way<00:00:17.220> down<00:00:17.490> on

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
same time I'm going all the way down on

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.910 
same time I'm going all the way down on
that<00:00:17.760> leg<00:00:18.180> getting<00:00:19.050> into<00:00:19.350> a<00:00:19.380> squat<00:00:19.740> position

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
that leg getting into a squat position

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.859 
that leg getting into a squat position
with<00:00:20.340> the<00:00:20.430> red<00:00:20.609> crossed<00:00:21.029> over<00:00:21.270> so<00:00:21.600> this<00:00:21.750> is

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
with the red crossed over so this is

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.380 
with the red crossed over so this is
working<00:00:22.080> in<00:00:22.320> glutes<00:00:22.619> the<00:00:23.000> hamstrings<00:00:24.000> and

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
working in glutes the hamstrings and

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.029 
working in glutes the hamstrings and
also<00:00:24.869> working<00:00:25.109> to<00:00:25.289> strengthen<00:00:25.560> the<00:00:25.859> knee

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
also working to strengthen the knee

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.740 
also working to strengthen the knee
joint<00:00:26.070> the<00:00:26.519> outside<00:00:26.939> of<00:00:27.090> the<00:00:27.150> knee<00:00:27.180> joint<00:00:27.359> at

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
joint the outside of the knee joint at

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.580 
joint the outside of the knee joint at
the<00:00:27.810> same<00:00:28.230> time<00:00:28.470> so<00:00:29.279> just<00:00:29.460> a<00:00:29.580> crossover<00:00:30.029> step

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:30.590 
the same time so just a crossover step

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:33.920 
the same time so just a crossover step
squat<00:00:31.590> move<00:00:31.980> and<00:00:32.340> I'm<00:00:32.850> touching<00:00:33.120> down<00:00:33.420> so<00:00:33.750> i'll

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
squat move and I'm touching down so i'll

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.479 
squat move and I'm touching down so i'll
make<00:00:34.140> sure<00:00:34.170> that<00:00:34.469> i'm<00:00:34.530> getting<00:00:34.829> as<00:00:34.950> low<00:00:35.160> as<00:00:35.370> i

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
make sure that i'm getting as low as i

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.310 
make sure that i'm getting as low as i
need<00:00:35.670> to<00:00:35.760> be<00:00:35.880> getting<00:00:36.059> each<00:00:36.329> time<00:00:36.630> then<00:00:37.200> what

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
need to be getting each time then what

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.780 
need to be getting each time then what
i'm<00:00:37.410> going<00:00:37.469> to<00:00:37.590> do<00:00:37.710> with<00:00:37.860> some<00:00:38.070> pulses<00:00:38.309> and

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
i'm going to do with some pulses and

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.930 
i'm going to do with some pulses and
jumps<00:00:39.360> once<00:00:39.600> i<00:00:39.690> get<00:00:39.870> to<00:00:39.899> the<00:00:40.110> end<00:00:40.260> of<00:00:40.410> this<00:00:40.469> here

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:40.940 
jumps once i get to the end of this here

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:42.740 
jumps once i get to the end of this here
so<00:00:41.940> i'm<00:00:42.030> going<00:00:42.180> to<00:00:42.239> go<00:00:42.300> all<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.540> way<00:00:42.600> across

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
so i'm going to go all the way across

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.470 
so i'm going to go all the way across
bat<00:00:43.710> and<00:00:44.010> i'm<00:00:44.219> going<00:00:44.370> to<00:00:44.430> come<00:00:44.610> back<00:00:44.789> again<00:00:45.000> and

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
bat and i'm going to come back again and

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.240 
bat and i'm going to come back again and
then<00:00:45.899> we're<00:00:46.050> going<00:00:46.140> to<00:00:46.260> do<00:00:46.350> some<00:00:46.559> pulse<00:00:46.829> jumps

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
then we're going to do some pulse jumps

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.819 
then we're going to do some pulse jumps
both<00:00:47.550> on<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:47.969> when<00:00:48.690> I<00:00:48.719> have<00:00:48.930> my<00:00:49.110> right<00:00:49.410> leg

down my right knee touching the ground

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.779 
down my right knee touching the ground
then<00:00:52.620> I'm<00:00:52.710> going<00:00:52.860> to<00:00:52.949> do<00:00:53.010> post<00:00:53.309> jumps<00:00:53.640> when<00:00:53.730> I

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
then I'm going to do post jumps when I

have my left knee touching the ground

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.729 
have my left knee touching the ground
this<00:00:56.910> is<00:00:57.120> another<00:00:57.420> exercise<00:00:58.020> to<00:00:58.289> work<00:00:58.320> the

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
this is another exercise to work the

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.340 
this is another exercise to work the
glutes<00:00:59.070> and<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.430> hamstrings<00:01:00.090> which<00:01:00.420> are<00:01:00.629> very

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
glutes and the hamstrings which are very

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.689 
glutes and the hamstrings which are very
important<00:01:01.890> muscles<00:01:02.219> when<00:01:02.370> you're<00:01:02.520> playing

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
and jumping because that's where the

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.820 
and jumping because that's where the
power<00:01:06.060> comes<00:01:06.390> from<00:01:06.540> from<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.470> glutes<00:01:07.680> and

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
power comes from from the glutes and

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.380 
power comes from from the glutes and
hamstrings<00:01:08.280> especially<00:01:08.700> with<00:01:08.820> basketball

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
hamstrings especially with basketball

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.510 
hamstrings especially with basketball
you<00:01:09.659> have<00:01:09.689> things<00:01:10.290> like<00:01:10.470> boxing<00:01:11.040> out<00:01:11.159> trying

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
you have things like boxing out trying

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.820 
you have things like boxing out trying
to<00:01:11.610> hold<00:01:11.760> position<00:01:12.270> in<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.450> post<00:01:12.720> all<00:01:13.200> that

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
to hold position in the post all that

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.469 
to hold position in the post all that
stuff<00:01:14.070> comes<00:01:14.369> from<00:01:14.460> those<00:01:14.729> muscles<00:01:15.240> in<00:01:15.390> the

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
stuff comes from those muscles in the

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.690 
stuff comes from those muscles in the
upper<00:01:15.509> leg<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:15.990> glutes<00:01:16.409> in<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.650> hamstring<00:01:17.070> so

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
upper leg the glutes in the hamstring so

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.880 
upper leg the glutes in the hamstring so
then<00:01:17.939> we're<00:01:18.090> going<00:01:18.270> to<00:01:18.450> examine<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.560> holding

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
then we're going to examine the holding

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.289 
then we're going to examine the holding
position<00:01:20.009> here<00:01:20.490> then<00:01:20.640> I'm<00:01:20.729> going<00:01:20.909> to<00:01:20.970> do<00:01:21.060> some

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
position here then I'm going to do some

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:22.880 
position here then I'm going to do some
pulses<00:01:21.540> and<00:01:22.049> I'm<00:01:22.229> going<00:01:22.380> to<00:01:22.470> do<00:01:22.530> some<00:01:22.710> actual

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
pulses and I'm going to do some actual

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.640 
pulses and I'm going to do some actual
jumps<00:01:23.549> out<00:01:24.150> of<00:01:24.210> that<00:01:24.479> position<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:25.170> challenge

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
jumps out of that position the challenge

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.340 
jumps out of that position the challenge
is<00:01:25.740> keeping<00:01:25.979> that<00:01:26.280> balance<00:01:26.750> without<00:01:27.750> falling

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
is keeping that balance without falling

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.499 
is keeping that balance without falling
over<00:01:28.470> losing<00:01:29.159> your<00:01:29.280> spot<00:01:29.579> while<00:01:30.030> doing<00:01:30.270> them

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
over losing your spot while doing them

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.480 
over losing your spot while doing them
from<00:01:30.659> both<00:01:30.869> sides<00:01:31.170> so<00:01:31.829> you<00:01:31.890> can<00:01:32.189> check<00:01:32.340> the

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
from both sides so you can check the

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.010 
from both sides so you can check the
rest<00:01:32.640> of<00:01:32.820> that<00:01:32.939> out<00:01:33.090> check<00:01:33.390> out<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.630> ultimate

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
rest of that out check out the ultimate

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.600 
rest of that out check out the ultimate
