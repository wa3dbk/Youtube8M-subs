00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:05.879
 this is thomas müller thomas is 22 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.290
 years young and works as an employee 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:12.990
 with a monthly gross earnings 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:13.679
 of 2.905 euros that is just under 1800 60 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.870
 euro net 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.570
 thomas is already thinking today 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.880
 as it looks like later in the age therefore 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.230
 the question arose that it was true 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.539
 rich ten percent of his 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.490
 to save net income without any problems 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.830
 with his retirement plans 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.859
 Thomas plans to give him his pension 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.270
 allows 18 years until the 85th 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.280
 his current year 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.680
 maintain living standards 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.450
 that means he wants to continue over 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.660
 the same purchasing power as the current one 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.730
 time he expects a 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.379
 average inflation rate of 2 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.000
 3 percent a year 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.410
 He must earn these by 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.870
 compensate for increases 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.579
 Furthermore , thomas expects his 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:58.350
 current income with legal 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:01:00.180
 pension claims of 1.287 euro he believes 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.250
 that his pension claims annually 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.979
 however, it will only increase by a percentage 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.930
 thomas counts for the withdrawal time 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.020
 an annual interest rate of 4 5 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:13.619
 percent over the year increases be 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:16.409
 so come to 8083 euro its 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.460
 pension entitlement but only to 2014 euro 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.940
 monthly 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.830
 at the age of 67 thomas retires from there 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.610
 to his standard of living until his 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.060
 85 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.890
 he needs to be able to hold birthday 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:31.940
 Inflation-related more than 14 million 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.259
 euro of this amount will be scarce 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:37.590
 390,000 euros from the statutory pension 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:40.050
 covered the remaining about 1 million 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.180
 thomas has to pay € 45 during his 45th birthday 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:44.310
 Save working years privately 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.619
 suppose there is no 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.039
 inflation and no pension increase 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:52.160
 In this case, Thomas would only be around 

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:54.690
 630,000 euros need scarce of them 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:57.479
 280,000 euros from the statutory pension 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:02:02.039
 be accepted without inflation would 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:02.990
 thomas so only 349 1488 euro private 

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:05.520
 save up 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.950
 the difference of the he buzzes privately 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.789
 It must be saved at the first moment very much 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.619
 appear high 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:12.660
 But let's take a look at the one 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:15.230
 price history of a movie ticket in the 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.459
 Period from 1960 to today 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:20.110
 At that time it cost a visit to the cinema 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:21.550
 converted about 80 cents 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.580
 today you have to be eight in average 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:27.790
 pay in euros and in 2060 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:29.140
 same price increase 50 euro thomas 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.270
 now has an overview of that 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.880
 he can do that from his 67th 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:36.310
 will need years of life now he expects 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:40.660
 what he thinks with a 3% interest rate 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:42.730
 4 5% and 6% monthly would have to save around 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:45.880
 to generate the required amount 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:47.890
 he is surprised about the numbers though 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:50.560
 We now have a realistic one 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:52.780
 investment interest of 45 percent 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.510
 so the thomas is not enough if he only 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:57.940
 ten percent of his net income 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:00.370
 monthly for the age of saving visit
