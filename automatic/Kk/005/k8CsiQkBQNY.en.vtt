00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:28.800 
doing little pricey the oil seal off

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:39.809 
doing little pricey the oil seal off
till<00:01:29.800> the<00:01:30.009> year<00:01:32.130> bearing<00:01:33.130> itself<00:01:35.729> is<00:01:36.729> a<00:01:38.610> 6232

00:01:39.809 --> 00:01:39.819

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
the kpop fairly straightforward but you

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:08.640 
the kpop fairly straightforward but you
can<00:03:02.440> see<00:03:05.370> that<00:03:06.370> all<00:03:06.460> that<00:03:06.580> brand-new<00:03:07.380> now<00:03:08.380> will

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
can see that all that brand-new now will

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:10.200 
can see that all that brand-new now will
will<00:03:08.920> replace<00:03:09.250> these<00:03:09.460> because<00:03:09.790> we<00:03:09.970> need<00:03:10.120> to

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:10.210 
will replace these because we need to

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:11.700 
will replace these because we need to
make<00:03:10.360> sure<00:03:10.540> that<00:03:10.720> everything's<00:03:11.140> sorted<00:03:11.500> for

just<00:03:24.310> listen<00:03:24.580> to<00:03:24.730> the<00:03:24.820> noise

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:34.700 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:38.720 

definitely<00:03:35.700> some<00:03:36.270> resistance<00:03:36.990> there<00:03:37.230> so<00:03:37.670> or<00:03:38.670> a

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
definitely some resistance there so or a

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:40.610 
definitely some resistance there so or a
kidney<00:03:39.210> and<00:03:39.450> you<00:03:39.570> set<00:03:39.780> bearing<00:03:40.200> should<00:03:40.410> make

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
kidney and you set bearing should make

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.280 
kidney and you set bearing should make
it<00:03:40.740> go<00:03:40.860> faster
