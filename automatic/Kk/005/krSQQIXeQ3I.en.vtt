video though I was feeling really well
and<00:00:26.180> not<00:00:27.180> thinking<00:00:27.810> so<00:00:28.199> after<00:00:28.650> sitting<00:00:29.099> for<00:00:29.340> a

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
and not thinking so after sitting for a

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.450 
and not thinking so after sitting for a
long<00:00:29.580> time<00:00:29.880> I<00:00:29.910> stood<00:00:30.660> up<00:00:30.840> quickly<00:00:31.130> like<00:00:32.130> I<00:00:32.279> said

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
long time I stood up quickly like I said

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.940 
long time I stood up quickly like I said
without<00:00:32.640> thinking<00:00:32.820> and<00:00:33.680> walked<00:00:34.680> to<00:00:34.829> the

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
without thinking and walked to the

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.819 
without thinking and walked to the
bathroom<00:00:35.520> and<00:00:35.700> by<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:35.940> time<00:00:36.329> I<00:00:36.840> got<00:00:37.559> there

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
bathroom and by the time I got there

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.490 
bathroom and by the time I got there
which<00:00:38.040> was<00:00:38.309> probably<00:00:38.760> a<00:00:39.030> seven<00:00:39.660> second<00:00:40.290> walk

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
which was probably a seven second walk

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.090 
which was probably a seven second walk
so<00:00:40.829> it<00:00:40.980> wasn't<00:00:41.309> very<00:00:41.370> far<00:00:42.290> the<00:00:43.290> room<00:00:43.530> was<00:00:43.829> just

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
so it wasn't very far the room was just

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.250 
so it wasn't very far the room was just
going<00:00:44.520> black<00:00:45.270> on<00:00:45.750> me<00:00:46.079> and<00:00:46.440> I<00:00:47.219> was<00:00:47.809> very<00:00:48.809> dizzy<00:00:49.230> I

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
going black on me and I was very dizzy I

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.410 
going black on me and I was very dizzy I
was<00:00:49.469> actually<00:00:49.649> stumbling<00:00:50.550> quite<00:00:50.820> a<00:00:50.850> bit<00:00:51.120> and<00:00:51.360> I

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
was actually stumbling quite a bit and I

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.209 
was actually stumbling quite a bit and I
was<00:00:51.570> able<00:00:51.719> to<00:00:51.870> catch<00:00:52.110> myself<00:00:52.969> but<00:00:54.140> I<00:00:55.140> it<00:00:55.920> seemed

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
was able to catch myself but I it seemed

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.760 
was able to catch myself but I it seemed
to<00:00:56.340> be<00:00:56.370> a<00:00:56.460> little<00:00:56.610> bit<00:00:56.820> worse<00:00:57.000> than<00:00:57.469> it<00:00:58.469> has

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
to be a little bit worse than it has

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.709 
to be a little bit worse than it has
been<00:00:59.100> in<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.309> past<00:00:59.520> with<00:00:59.820> that<00:01:00.000> it's<00:01:00.239> probably

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
been in the past with that it's probably

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.410 
been in the past with that it's probably
just<00:01:00.840> because<00:01:01.289> I<00:01:02.000> completely<00:01:03.000> wasn't

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
just because I completely wasn't

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.010 
just because I completely wasn't
thinking<00:01:03.750> and<00:01:03.870> I<00:01:03.960> stood<00:01:04.199> up<00:01:04.260> too<00:01:04.619> fast<00:01:04.939> but

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.020 
thinking and I stood up too fast but

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.660 
thinking and I stood up too fast but
usually<00:01:07.020> I<00:01:07.380> do<00:01:07.530> feel<00:01:08.130> a<00:01:08.159> little<00:01:08.460> bit

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
usually I do feel a little bit

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.399 
usually I do feel a little bit
lightheaded<00:01:08.850> when<00:01:09.299> standing<00:01:09.810> but<00:01:09.960> that<00:01:10.140> time

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
lightheaded when standing but that time

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.760 
lightheaded when standing but that time
it<00:01:10.680> just<00:01:10.890> seemed<00:01:11.070> to<00:01:11.189> be<00:01:11.280> a<00:01:11.310> little<00:01:11.610> bit<00:01:11.790> worse

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
it just seemed to be a little bit worse

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.100 
it just seemed to be a little bit worse
because<00:01:13.770> I<00:01:13.979> just<00:01:14.369> about<00:01:14.670> fell<00:01:14.729> so<00:01:15.600> I've<00:01:15.840> got<00:01:16.020> to

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
because I just about fell so I've got to

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.580 
because I just about fell so I've got to
be<00:01:16.170> more<00:01:16.259> careful<00:01:16.770> with<00:01:16.860> that<00:01:18.229> today<00:01:19.229> went

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
be more careful with that today went

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.179 
be more careful with that today went
well<00:01:19.650> though<00:01:20.810> I've<00:01:21.810> noticed<00:01:22.409> that<00:01:22.619> mornings

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
well though I've noticed that mornings

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.940 
well though I've noticed that mornings
are<00:01:23.520> still<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.150> roughest<00:01:24.540> for<00:01:24.840> me<00:01:25.020> at

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
are still the roughest for me at

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.870 
are still the roughest for me at
nighttime<00:01:26.310> too<00:01:26.880> if<00:01:27.479> I<00:01:27.930> stay<00:01:28.200> up<00:01:28.380> too<00:01:28.710> late<00:01:29.009> but

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
nighttime too if I stay up too late but

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.929 
nighttime too if I stay up too late but
mornings<00:01:30.420> are<00:01:30.890> the<00:01:31.890> roughest<00:01:32.340> and<00:01:33.710> I<00:01:34.759> was<00:01:35.759> just

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
mornings are the roughest and I was just

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.999 
mornings are the roughest and I was just
very<00:01:36.180> tired<00:01:36.689> and<00:01:36.990> achy<00:01:37.350> laying<00:01:37.619> in<00:01:37.770> bed<00:01:37.950> I

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
very tired and achy laying in bed I

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.280 
very tired and achy laying in bed I
really<00:01:38.490> didn't<00:01:39.090> want<00:01:39.270> to<00:01:39.329> get<00:01:39.479> up<00:01:39.509> but<00:01:40.049> it<00:01:40.170> was

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
really didn't want to get up but it was

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.560 
really didn't want to get up but it was
kind<00:01:40.530> of<00:01:40.590> late<00:01:40.829> so<00:01:41.159> I<00:01:41.189> figured<00:01:41.670> I<00:01:41.880> should<00:01:41.909> and

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
kind of late so I figured I should and

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.819 
kind of late so I figured I should and
then<00:01:43.439> the<00:01:43.680> rest<00:01:43.890> of<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.340> day<00:01:44.780> did<00:01:45.780> go<00:01:45.990> well<00:01:46.229> um

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
then the rest of the day did go well um

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:51.649 
then the rest of the day did go well um
I<00:01:47.700> noticed<00:01:48.630> that<00:01:48.840> my<00:01:48.990> tongue<00:01:49.259> is<00:01:50.659> slightly

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
I noticed that my tongue is slightly

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.030 
I noticed that my tongue is slightly
coated<00:01:52.500> now<00:01:52.710> not<00:01:53.520> very<00:01:53.820> much<00:01:54.030> but<00:01:54.720> more<00:01:55.710> so

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
coated now not very much but more so

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.639 
coated now not very much but more so
than<00:01:56.340> it<00:01:56.520> would<00:01:56.670> be<00:01:56.700> if<00:01:56.969> I<00:01:57.119> wasn't<00:01:57.420> fasting<00:01:58.140> and

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
than it would be if I wasn't fasting and

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.429 
than it would be if I wasn't fasting and
I'm<00:01:59.579> beginning<00:01:59.880> to<00:02:00.329> get<00:02:00.630> that<00:02:00.810> bitter<00:02:01.110> taste

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
I'm beginning to get that bitter taste

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:01.999 
I'm beginning to get that bitter taste
in<00:02:01.619> my<00:02:01.680> mouth

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
in my mouth

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.630 
in my mouth
so<00:02:02.549> I<00:02:02.939> know<00:02:03.390> that<00:02:03.750> detox<00:02:04.200> is<00:02:04.560> slowly<00:02:04.950> creeping

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
so I know that detox is slowly creeping

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.490 
so I know that detox is slowly creeping
in<00:02:05.820> finally<00:02:08.660> one<00:02:09.660> thing<00:02:09.810> I<00:02:09.959> noticed<00:02:10.379> very

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
in finally one thing I noticed very

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.160 
in finally one thing I noticed very
different<00:02:11.190> about<00:02:11.310> this<00:02:11.489> fast

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
different about this fast

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.850 
different about this fast
paired<00:02:12.380> to<00:02:12.770> my<00:02:13.160> 21-day<00:02:14.090> fast<00:02:14.420> is<00:02:14.930> that<00:02:15.410> my

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
paired to my 21-day fast is that my

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.930 
paired to my 21-day fast is that my
cravings<00:02:16.550> are<00:02:18.040> well<00:02:19.040> basically<00:02:19.760> they're

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
cravings are well basically they're

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.660 
cravings are well basically they're
non-existent<00:02:20.150> I<00:02:21.140> mean<00:02:21.770> I<00:02:21.800> think<00:02:21.950> about<00:02:22.250> food

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
non-existent I mean I think about food

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.610 
non-existent I mean I think about food
and<00:02:22.880> I<00:02:22.970> think<00:02:23.030> well<00:02:23.420> that<00:02:23.450> sounds<00:02:24.080> good

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
and I think well that sounds good

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.370 
and I think well that sounds good
but<00:02:25.250> I<00:02:25.580> guess<00:02:26.180> they're<00:02:26.420> the<00:02:26.810> correct<00:02:27.140> word

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 
but I guess they're the correct word

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.190 
but I guess they're the correct word
would<00:02:27.560> be<00:02:27.590> my<00:02:27.860> temptations<00:02:28.580> my<00:02:29.569> temptations

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
would be my temptations my temptations

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.940 
would be my temptations my temptations
are<00:02:30.470> no<00:02:30.739> longer<00:02:31.300> existent<00:02:32.300> I<00:02:32.709> think<00:02:33.709> about

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
are no longer existent I think about

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.430 
are no longer existent I think about
food<00:02:34.220> and<00:02:34.370> I<00:02:34.630> think<00:02:35.630> about<00:02:35.840> it<00:02:35.989> in<00:02:36.140> a<00:02:36.230> more

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
food and I think about it in a more

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.460 
food and I think about it in a more
appreciative<00:02:37.069> kind<00:02:37.910> of<00:02:38.030> way<00:02:38.180> but<00:02:39.110> I'm<00:02:39.260> not

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
appreciative kind of way but I'm not

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.720 
appreciative kind of way but I'm not
tempted<00:02:40.040> to<00:02:40.340> actually<00:02:40.910> eat<00:02:41.120> it<00:02:41.150> or<00:02:41.540> in<00:02:41.780> my<00:02:42.019> fast

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
tempted to actually eat it or in my fast

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.250 
tempted to actually eat it or in my fast
I've<00:02:43.730> learned<00:02:44.090> that<00:02:44.239> it's<00:02:44.420> okay<00:02:44.810> to<00:02:44.870> go<00:02:45.230> a

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
I've learned that it's okay to go a

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.890 
I've learned that it's okay to go a
little<00:02:45.530> while<00:02:45.769> without<00:02:45.980> food<00:02:46.519> it's<00:02:46.900> it's

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
little while without food it's it's

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.110 
little while without food it's it's
healthy<00:02:48.440> and<00:02:48.590> it's<00:02:48.709> rejuvenating<00:02:49.120> especially

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
healthy and it's rejuvenating especially

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:55.809 
healthy and it's rejuvenating especially
at<00:02:50.299> the<00:02:50.480> end<00:02:50.630> so<00:02:52.720> it's<00:02:53.720> not<00:02:54.280> it's<00:02:55.280> not<00:02:55.519> nearly

00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:55.819 
at the end so it's not it's not nearly

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:59.320 
at the end so it's not it's not nearly
as<00:02:56.180> bad<00:02:56.450> as<00:02:56.510> it<00:02:56.720> was<00:02:56.870> before<00:02:57.580> like<00:02:58.580> today<00:02:59.299> I

00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.330 
as bad as it was before like today I

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.530 
as bad as it was before like today I
made<00:02:59.660> dinner<00:03:00.110> for<00:03:00.260> my<00:03:01.010> granny<00:03:01.310> I<00:03:01.670> made<00:03:02.330> her

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
made dinner for my granny I made her

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.740 
made dinner for my granny I made her
some<00:03:03.080> brown<00:03:03.319> rice<00:03:03.590> and<00:03:03.950> steamed<00:03:04.610> vegetables

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
some brown rice and steamed vegetables

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.930 
some brown rice and steamed vegetables
and<00:03:05.750> I<00:03:06.260> thought<00:03:06.560> you<00:03:07.130> know<00:03:07.220> this<00:03:07.430> looks<00:03:07.610> really

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
and I thought you know this looks really

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:09.970 
and I thought you know this looks really
good<00:03:08.209> I<00:03:08.239> bet<00:03:08.330> it<00:03:08.569> would<00:03:08.690> taste<00:03:08.720> good<00:03:09.230> but<00:03:09.620> I

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
good I bet it would taste good but I

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.400 
good I bet it would taste good but I
just<00:03:10.700> wasn't<00:03:10.970> tempted<00:03:11.660> to<00:03:11.750> eat<00:03:11.840> it<00:03:11.900> and<00:03:12.319> I'm

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.410 
just wasn't tempted to eat it and I'm

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:15.640 
just wasn't tempted to eat it and I'm
thinking<00:03:13.360> compared<00:03:14.360> to<00:03:14.480> my<00:03:14.569> last<00:03:14.810> fast<00:03:15.230> if<00:03:15.500> I

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
thinking compared to my last fast if I

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.180 
thinking compared to my last fast if I
had<00:03:15.860> tried<00:03:16.220> to<00:03:17.380> cook<00:03:18.380> for<00:03:18.620> somebody<00:03:18.980> during

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
had tried to cook for somebody during

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:21.190 
had tried to cook for somebody during
that<00:03:19.400> time<00:03:19.609> it<00:03:20.060> would<00:03:20.209> have<00:03:20.269> been<00:03:20.600> really

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
that time it would have been really

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.640 
that time it would have been really
really<00:03:21.530> difficult<00:03:22.329> but<00:03:23.329> today<00:03:24.290> I<00:03:24.320> actually

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
really difficult but today I actually

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:29.259 
really difficult but today I actually
enjoyed<00:03:25.250> it<00:03:25.519> so<00:03:26.829> go<00:03:27.829> figure<00:03:28.100> it's<00:03:28.400> a<00:03:28.640> it's<00:03:29.090> a

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:29.269 
enjoyed it so go figure it's a it's a

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:33.610 
enjoyed it so go figure it's a it's a
big<00:03:29.570> change<00:03:29.959> for<00:03:30.290> my<00:03:30.440> last<00:03:30.680> one<00:03:31.040> I<00:03:32.140> went<00:03:33.140> for<00:03:33.590> a

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:33.620 
big change for my last one I went for a

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:38.110 
big change for my last one I went for a
24<00:03:34.579> minute<00:03:34.730> walk<00:03:35.030> today<00:03:35.480> and<00:03:36.940> then<00:03:37.940> I<00:03:38.060> came
