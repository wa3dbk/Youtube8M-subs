00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
have a limited range as soon as you

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:16.180

start to run low on one battery you can

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:19.870 
start to run low on one battery you can
just<00:02:16.310> swap<00:02:16.459> the<00:02:16.580> old<00:02:16.730> for<00:02:16.940> the<00:02:17.030> new<00:02:18.670> so<00:02:19.670> in

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
just swap the old for the new so in

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.180

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
designing and boards reflex remote we

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.250 
designing and boards reflex remote we
wanted<00:02:22.430> to<00:02:22.550> focus<00:02:22.910> mainly<00:02:23.180> on<00:02:23.360> comfort<00:02:23.959> and

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
wanted to focus mainly on comfort and

so using this remote should be

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.150 
so using this remote should be
completely<00:02:29.660> effortless<00:02:29.800> so<00:02:30.800> we<00:02:30.920> took<00:02:31.099> a

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
completely effortless so we took a

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:32.830 
completely effortless so we took a
