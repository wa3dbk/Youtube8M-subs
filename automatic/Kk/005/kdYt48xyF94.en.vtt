00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
Brent's hang you know I've built a lot

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:07.280 
Brent's hang you know I've built a lot
of<00:00:05.970> racks<00:00:06.240> over<00:00:06.359> the<00:00:06.540> last<00:00:06.660> few<00:00:06.899> years<00:00:07.109> and

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
of racks over the last few years and

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.250 
of racks over the last few years and
I've<00:00:08.069> discovered<00:00:08.550> some<00:00:09.059> ways<00:00:09.269> of<00:00:09.570> making<00:00:10.139> my

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
I've discovered some ways of making my

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.499 
I've discovered some ways of making my
process<00:00:10.769> easier<00:00:11.340> and<00:00:11.519> I<00:00:11.969> want<00:00:12.150> to<00:00:12.210> let<00:00:12.330> you<00:00:12.480> in

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
process easier and I want to let you in

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.640 
process easier and I want to let you in
on<00:00:12.750> that

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.190 

one<00:00:17.610> of<00:00:17.700> the<00:00:17.760> most<00:00:17.910> irritating<00:00:18.390> things<00:00:18.900> in

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:19.200 
one of the most irritating things in

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.900 
one of the most irritating things in
using<00:00:19.470> curved<00:00:19.680> bars<00:00:19.950> when<00:00:20.160> building<00:00:20.340> racks<00:00:20.670> is

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
using curved bars when building racks is

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.260 
using curved bars when building racks is
getting<00:00:21.570> the<00:00:21.630> rack<00:00:21.810> level<00:00:22.640> now<00:00:23.640> I<00:00:23.700> always

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:24.270 
getting the rack level now I always

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:26.510 
getting the rack level now I always
start<00:00:24.630> in<00:00:24.840> building<00:00:25.290> the<00:00:25.650> front<00:00:25.890> section<00:00:26.400> of

start in building the front section of

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.250 
start in building the front section of
the<00:00:26.670> rack<00:00:26.850> first<00:00:27.119> because<00:00:27.600> the<00:00:27.720> front<00:00:27.930> section

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
the rack first because the front section

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.589 
the rack first because the front section
is<00:00:28.349> your<00:00:28.439> foundation<00:00:28.590> if<00:00:29.130> your<00:00:29.939> foundation<00:00:30.480> is

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
is your foundation if your foundation is

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.630 
is your foundation if your foundation is

not level your rack is not going to be

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.640 
not level your rack is not going to be
level<00:00:32.970> and<00:00:33.090> you're<00:00:33.930> going<00:00:34.050> to<00:00:34.080> lose<00:00:34.230> all<00:00:34.500> your

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:34.650 
level and you're going to lose all your

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:38.000 
level and you're going to lose all your
stability<00:00:35.720> the<00:00:36.720> most<00:00:37.080> important<00:00:37.590> tool<00:00:37.770> that<00:00:37.980> I

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
stability the most important tool that I

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.310 
stability the most important tool that I
use<00:00:38.340> when<00:00:38.610> I<00:00:38.640> build<00:00:38.850> racks<00:00:39.090> is<00:00:39.360> a<00:00:39.750> level<00:00:40.170> and

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
use when I build racks is a level and

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.590 
use when I build racks is a level and
you'll<00:00:41.280> find<00:00:41.610> that<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.150> more<00:00:42.330> you<00:00:42.449> build

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
you'll find that the more you build

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.290 
you'll find that the more you build
racks<00:00:42.930> that<00:00:43.110> a<00:00:43.500> level<00:00:44.070> will<00:00:44.820> be<00:00:44.940> one<00:00:45.150> of<00:00:45.239> your

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
racks that a level will be one of your

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.880 
racks that a level will be one of your
best<00:00:45.600> friends<00:00:45.960> that<00:00:46.080> you<00:00:46.260> could<00:00:46.470> ever<00:00:46.620> use

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
best friends that you could ever use

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.600 
best friends that you could ever use
when<00:00:47.100> building<00:00:47.220> rags<00:00:47.690> but<00:00:48.690> I<00:00:49.290> use<00:00:50.190> a<00:00:50.220> method

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
when building rags but I use a method

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.240 
when building rags but I use a method
that<00:00:50.730> I<00:00:50.790> call<00:00:51.090> three-way<00:00:51.899> leveling<00:00:52.320> and<00:00:52.800> what

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
that I call three-way leveling and what

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.889 
that I call three-way leveling and what
that<00:00:53.399> is<00:00:53.520> is<00:00:53.730> I<00:00:53.820> measure<00:00:54.030> it<00:00:54.239> once<00:00:54.450> in<00:00:54.750> the

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
that is is I measure it once in the

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.950 
that is is I measure it once in the
center<00:00:55.260> I<00:00:56.059> met<00:00:57.059> and<00:00:57.210> then<00:00:57.300> I<00:00:57.360> measure<00:00:57.570> it<00:00:57.660> once

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
center I met and then I measure it once

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:04.160 
center I met and then I measure it once
at<00:00:58.320> each<00:00:58.680> end<00:00:59.120> and<00:01:01.129> the<00:01:02.129> reason<00:01:02.610> I<00:01:02.930> measure<00:01:03.930> it

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
at each end and the reason I measure it

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.180 
at each end and the reason I measure it
on<00:01:04.350> both<00:01:04.680> ends<00:01:05.220> is<00:01:05.369> because<00:01:06.149> just<00:01:06.540> because<00:01:07.190> the

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:08.190 
on both ends is because just because the

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:10.219 
on both ends is because just because the
bar<00:01:08.399> is<00:01:08.610> level<00:01:08.940> in<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.119> center<00:01:09.450> does<00:01:09.660> not<00:01:09.960> mean

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
bar is level in the center does not mean

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.260 
bar is level in the center does not mean
that<00:01:10.500> it's<00:01:10.950> level<00:01:11.250> on<00:01:11.369> both<00:01:11.520> ends<00:01:11.910> I'll<00:01:12.060> show

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
that it's level on both ends I'll show

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:19.130 
that it's level on both ends I'll show
you<00:01:15.380> if<00:01:16.380> this<00:01:16.619> bar<00:01:16.860> is<00:01:17.210> bowed<00:01:18.210> up<00:01:18.509> a<00:01:18.720> little<00:01:18.960> bit

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
you if this bar is bowed up a little bit

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.910 
you if this bar is bowed up a little bit
or<00:01:19.560> even<00:01:19.590> bowed<00:01:20.130> out<00:01:20.399> a<00:01:20.789> little<00:01:21.179> bit<00:01:21.920> it'll

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
or even bowed out a little bit it'll

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.680 
or even bowed out a little bit it'll
still<00:01:23.130> show<00:01:23.310> that<00:01:23.459> it's<00:01:23.610> level<00:01:23.940> but<00:01:24.420> as<00:01:24.509> you

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:24.690 
still show that it's level but as you

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.080 
still show that it's level but as you
can<00:01:24.840> see<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.410> legs<00:01:25.619> are<00:01:25.979> nowhere<00:01:26.550> close<00:01:27.060> to

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
can see the legs are nowhere close to

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.570 
can see the legs are nowhere close to
being<00:01:27.330> straight<00:01:27.780> up<00:01:27.929> and<00:01:28.080> down<00:01:28.110> your<00:01:28.950> legs<00:01:29.459> are

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:29.580 
being straight up and down your legs are

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.370 
being straight up and down your legs are
all<00:01:29.670> concave<00:01:30.209> your<00:01:30.750> bars<00:01:30.959> are<00:01:31.110> going<00:01:31.229> to<00:01:31.289> be

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
all concave your bars are going to be

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.380 
all concave your bars are going to be
thrown<00:01:31.709> off<00:01:31.860> at<00:01:32.069> awkward<00:01:32.550> angles<00:01:32.940> your

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
thrown off at awkward angles your

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.620 
thrown off at awkward angles your
stability<00:01:33.660> disappears<00:01:34.759> so<00:01:35.759> you<00:01:36.330> take<00:01:36.509> this

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
stability disappears so you take this

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.199 
stability disappears so you take this
level<00:01:36.899> and<00:01:36.990> throw<00:01:37.110> it<00:01:37.200> over<00:01:37.349> here<00:01:38.179> shows<00:01:39.179> that

00:01:39.199 --> 00:01:39.209 
level and throw it over here shows that

00:01:39.209 --> 00:01:42.620 
level and throw it over here shows that
I'm<00:01:39.450> way<00:01:40.020> off<00:01:40.229> center<00:01:40.640> so<00:01:41.640> by<00:01:42.000> using<00:01:42.179> 3-way

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
I'm way off center so by using 3-way

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.669 
I'm way off center so by using 3-way
leveling<00:01:43.110> I<00:01:43.289> can<00:01:43.950> actually<00:01:44.459> accurately<00:01:45.679> make

00:01:46.669 --> 00:01:46.679 
leveling I can actually accurately make

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:49.699 
leveling I can actually accurately make
this<00:01:46.979> curved<00:01:47.700> bar<00:01:47.940> like<00:01:48.750> it's<00:01:48.959> laying<00:01:49.440> on<00:01:49.679> a

perfectly level vertically as well so

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.660 
perfectly level vertically as well so
let's<00:02:03.569> talk<00:02:03.750> about<00:02:03.959> height<00:02:04.289> you<00:02:05.280> may<00:02:05.399> look<00:02:05.550> at

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
let's talk about height you may look at

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.029 
let's talk about height you may look at
this<00:02:05.819> and<00:02:06.060> go<00:02:06.270> I<00:02:06.599> don't<00:02:07.530> want<00:02:07.709> to<00:02:07.800> play<00:02:07.860> my

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
this and go I don't want to play my

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.309 
this and go I don't want to play my
crossbar<00:02:08.489> that<00:02:08.670> high<00:02:08.880> I<00:02:09.149> want<00:02:09.780> it<00:02:09.869> mounted

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
crossbar that high I want it mounted

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.800 
crossbar that high I want it mounted
right<00:02:10.500> over<00:02:10.739> my<00:02:10.830> base<00:02:11.039> drum<00:02:11.420> well<00:02:12.420> what<00:02:12.569> I<00:02:12.599> like

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
right over my base drum well what I like

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.330 
right over my base drum well what I like
to<00:02:12.930> do<00:02:13.080> is<00:02:13.380> I<00:02:13.440> like<00:02:13.620> to<00:02:13.650> start<00:02:13.800> off<00:02:14.040> with<00:02:14.099> the

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
to do is I like to start off with the

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.880 
to do is I like to start off with the
clamps<00:02:14.670> on<00:02:14.790> each<00:02:14.970> leg<00:02:15.239> flush<00:02:15.959> to<00:02:16.170> the<00:02:16.200> top<00:02:16.650> of

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
clamps on each leg flush to the top of

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.220 
clamps on each leg flush to the top of
the<00:02:17.190> leg<00:02:17.370> this<00:02:18.060> gives<00:02:18.360> me<00:02:18.540> the<00:02:18.660> exact<00:02:19.020> same

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
the leg this gives me the exact same

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.010 
the leg this gives me the exact same
height<00:02:19.500> for<00:02:19.860> each<00:02:19.980> clamp<00:02:20.310> then<00:02:20.940> I<00:02:21.180> can<00:02:21.390> I<00:02:21.420> can

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
height for each clamp then I can I can

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.320 
height for each clamp then I can I can
establish<00:02:22.319> the<00:02:22.680> positioning<00:02:23.310> of<00:02:23.430> the<00:02:24.060> the

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
establish the positioning of the the

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.569 
establish the positioning of the the
crossbar<00:02:24.750> and<00:02:24.989> once<00:02:25.709> I<00:02:25.860> know<00:02:25.920> the<00:02:26.099> crossbar<00:02:26.549> is

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:26.579 
crossbar and once I know the crossbar is

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:27.860 
crossbar and once I know the crossbar is
completely<00:02:27.060> level<00:02:27.239> and<00:02:27.480> locked<00:02:27.689> into

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
completely level and locked into

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.020 
completely level and locked into
position<00:02:28.349> I<00:02:28.469> can<00:02:28.950> then<00:02:29.069> start<00:02:29.370> establishing

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
position I can then start establishing

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.620 
position I can then start establishing
the

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
the

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:34.100 
the
and<00:02:30.720> as<00:02:31.680> long<00:02:31.980> as<00:02:32.310> the<00:02:32.580> center<00:02:32.940> level<00:02:33.180> remains

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
and as long as the center level remains

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.430 
and as long as the center level remains
level<00:02:34.710> I<00:02:35.070> know<00:02:35.910> that<00:02:36.720> the<00:02:36.840> clamps<00:02:37.260> are<00:02:37.380> going

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
level I know that the clamps are going

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:38.960 
level I know that the clamps are going
to<00:02:37.650> be<00:02:37.740> the<00:02:37.890> exact<00:02:38.220> same<00:02:38.250> height<00:02:38.670> on<00:02:38.850> either

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
to be the exact same height on either

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:40.850 
to be the exact same height on either
side<00:02:39.270> because<00:02:39.660> the<00:02:39.780> relationship<00:02:40.380> stays<00:02:40.650> the

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
side because the relationship stays the

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.170 
side because the relationship stays the
same<00:02:41.900> so<00:02:42.900> now<00:02:43.050> let's<00:02:43.290> add<00:02:43.410> the<00:02:43.440> side<00:02:43.740> extension

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
same so now let's add the side extension

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.270 
same so now let's add the side extension
we<00:02:45.180> already<00:02:45.450> know<00:02:45.600> that<00:02:45.960> our<00:02:46.620> foundation<00:02:46.980> is

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
we already know that our foundation is

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.550 
we already know that our foundation is
level<00:02:47.550> in<00:02:47.640> its<00:02:47.760> solid<00:02:48.000> we<00:02:48.630> know<00:02:48.810> that<00:02:49.080> this<00:02:49.230> leg

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
level in its solid we know that this leg

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.120 
level in its solid we know that this leg
is<00:02:49.830> level<00:02:50.550> and<00:02:50.640> solid<00:02:51.350> side<00:02:52.350> extensions<00:02:52.800> easy

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
is level and solid side extensions easy

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.730 
is level and solid side extensions easy
add<00:02:53.400> the<00:02:53.970> curved<00:02:54.210> bar<00:02:54.450> on<00:02:54.630> to<00:02:55.080> the<00:02:55.200> addition<00:02:55.530> to

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:55.740 
add the curved bar on to the addition to

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:58.310 
add the curved bar on to the addition to
the<00:02:55.770> existing<00:02:56.010> leg<00:02:56.520> and<00:02:56.790> then<00:02:57.720> take<00:02:58.200> your

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
the existing leg and then take your

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:59.810 
the existing leg and then take your
level<00:02:58.650> and<00:02:58.860> this<00:02:59.190> is<00:02:59.280> what<00:02:59.370> I<00:02:59.430> like<00:02:59.580> to<00:02:59.610> do<00:02:59.790> I

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
level and this is what I like to do I

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.150 
level and this is what I like to do I
like<00:02:59.910> to<00:03:00.180> just<00:03:00.360> level<00:03:01.260> out<00:03:01.380> that<00:03:01.560> one<00:03:01.770> end<00:03:02.010> and

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
like to just level out that one end and

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.060 
like to just level out that one end and
once<00:03:02.700> I<00:03:02.850> see<00:03:03.060> that<00:03:03.090> this<00:03:03.300> end<00:03:03.600> the<00:03:04.440> exposed<00:03:04.860> end

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
once I see that this end the exposed end

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:07.550 
once I see that this end the exposed end
is<00:03:05.280> level<00:03:06.030> I<00:03:06.210> know<00:03:06.540> that<00:03:06.840> the<00:03:06.900> entire<00:03:06.990> bar<00:03:07.440> is

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
is level I know that the entire bar is

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.870 
is level I know that the entire bar is
level<00:03:09.080> now<00:03:10.080> it's<00:03:10.260> time<00:03:10.410> to<00:03:10.440> add<00:03:10.650> the<00:03:11.610> other<00:03:11.760> way

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
level now it's time to add the other way

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.060 
level now it's time to add the other way
I<00:03:11.910> gone<00:03:12.090> through<00:03:12.410> so<00:03:13.410> what<00:03:13.590> I'm<00:03:13.680> going<00:03:13.800> to<00:03:13.860> do

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
is I'm going to adjust this this clamp

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:29.320 
is I'm going to adjust this this clamp
and<00:03:18.950> this<00:03:19.950> leg<00:03:21.200> to<00:03:22.200> this<00:03:22.709> bar

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:29.330 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:31.470 

and<00:03:29.750> there<00:03:30.050> you<00:03:30.170> have<00:03:30.290> a<00:03:30.320> side<00:03:30.560> extension

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
and there you have a side extension

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.280 
and there you have a side extension
here's<00:03:32.480> a<00:03:32.540> really<00:03:32.750> annoying<00:03:32.930> thing<00:03:33.170> that

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290 
here's a really annoying thing that

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:35.620 
here's a really annoying thing that
happens<00:03:33.620> you<00:03:34.490> have<00:03:34.520> your<00:03:34.790> rack<00:03:34.910> all<00:03:35.120> set<00:03:35.390> up<00:03:35.480> at

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:35.630 
happens you have your rack all set up at

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:37.510 
happens you have your rack all set up at
home<00:03:35.810> you<00:03:36.350> get<00:03:36.530> everything<00:03:36.950> locked<00:03:37.190> in<00:03:37.400> at

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:37.520 
home you get everything locked in at

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:38.920 
home you get everything locked in at
position<00:03:37.640> you<00:03:37.970> give<00:03:38.090> it<00:03:38.180> memory<00:03:38.450> locks<00:03:38.660> which

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:38.930 
position you give it memory locks which

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:40.660 
position you give it memory locks which
I<00:03:39.110> don't<00:03:39.200> have<00:03:39.470> here<00:03:39.650> so<00:03:40.070> don't<00:03:40.220> follow<00:03:40.490> my

is that the surface that you built the

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:01.210 
is that the surface that you built the
rack<00:03:57.410> on<00:03:57.440> at<00:03:58.030> home<00:03:59.030> was<00:03:59.830> different<00:04:00.830> than<00:04:01.010> what

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:01.220 
rack on at home was different than what

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:02.920 
rack on at home was different than what
you're<00:04:01.430> setting<00:04:01.850> it<00:04:01.910> up<00:04:02.000> on<00:04:02.180> now<00:04:02.420> so<00:04:02.720> you've

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930 
you're setting it up on now so you've

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:05.170 
you're setting it up on now so you've
got<00:04:03.050> an<00:04:03.170> uneven<00:04:03.620> service<00:04:04.040> surface<00:04:04.730> compared

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:05.180 
got an uneven service surface compared

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:06.910 
got an uneven service surface compared
to<00:04:05.570> where<00:04:05.720> you<00:04:05.840> originally<00:04:06.410> built<00:04:06.590> the<00:04:06.710> rack

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:06.920 
to where you originally built the rack

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:08.830 
to where you originally built the rack
so<00:04:07.610> and<00:04:07.880> that<00:04:08.030> can<00:04:08.180> be<00:04:08.300> a<00:04:08.330> little<00:04:08.600> bit

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:08.840 
so and that can be a little bit

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.130 
so and that can be a little bit
irritating<00:04:09.740> so<00:04:10.220> a<00:04:10.520> really<00:04:11.210> easy<00:04:11.390> fix<00:04:11.750> for<00:04:11.900> this

easily and there's a tension wheel right
here<00:05:35.450> that<00:05:35.870> adds<00:05:36.140> tension<00:05:36.919> to<00:05:37.310> the<00:05:37.400> blade<00:05:37.610> and

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:37.820 
here that adds tension to the blade and

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:42.190 
here that adds tension to the blade and
it<00:05:38.720> creates<00:05:40.180> the<00:05:41.180> clamping<00:05:41.600> mechanism<00:05:41.630> right

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:42.200 
it creates the clamping mechanism right

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:43.150 
it creates the clamping mechanism right
here<00:05:42.260> that<00:05:42.500> the<00:05:42.590> blade

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:43.160 
here that the blade

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:45.430 
here that the blade
actually<00:05:43.400> starts<00:05:43.760> to<00:05:43.820> cut<00:05:44.090> into<00:05:44.360> the<00:05:44.450> tube<00:05:44.660> so

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:45.440 
actually starts to cut into the tube so

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:48.970 
actually starts to cut into the tube so
you<00:05:45.530> slowly<00:05:46.870> go<00:05:47.870> around<00:05:48.200> the<00:05:48.350> tube<00:05:48.590> but<00:05:48.830> you

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:48.980 
you slowly go around the tube but you

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:50.050 
you slowly go around the tube but you
want<00:05:49.160> to<00:05:49.190> make<00:05:49.340> sure<00:05:49.550> that<00:05:49.670> you're<00:05:49.850> going

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:50.060 
want to make sure that you're going

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:51.760 
want to make sure that you're going
straight<00:05:50.300> around<00:05:50.870> the<00:05:50.960> tube<00:05:51.170> otherwise

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:51.770 
straight around the tube otherwise

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:54.280 
straight around the tube otherwise
you're<00:05:52.370> going<00:05:52.460> to<00:05:52.520> get<00:05:52.760> a<00:05:52.970> spiral<00:05:53.690> effect<00:05:53.780> and

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:54.290 
you're going to get a spiral effect and

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:56.020 
you're going to get a spiral effect and
the<00:05:54.650> blade<00:05:54.890> is<00:05:54.920> not<00:05:55.340> going<00:05:55.610> to<00:05:55.700> stay<00:05:55.850> on<00:05:55.880> the

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:56.030 
the blade is not going to stay on the

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:59.830 
the blade is not going to stay on the
same<00:05:56.210> track<00:05:57.610> you<00:05:58.610> slowly<00:05:58.910> add<00:05:59.180> more<00:05:59.570> and<00:05:59.720> more

00:05:59.830 --> 00:05:59.840 
same track you slowly add more and more

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:07.990 
same track you slowly add more and more
tension<00:06:00.320> after<00:06:00.530> each<00:06:00.950> revolution<00:06:06.550> and<00:06:07.550> then

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:08.000 
tension after each revolution and then

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.470 
tension after each revolution and then
eventually<00:06:09.610> you've<00:06:10.610> got<00:06:10.820> two<00:06:10.970> pipes<00:06:11.210> out<00:06:11.360> of

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:11.480 
eventually you've got two pipes out of

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:15.580 
eventually you've got two pipes out of
one<00:06:12.010> okay<00:06:13.010> so<00:06:13.070> now<00:06:13.370> I<00:06:13.400> cut<00:06:13.790> my<00:06:13.910> pipe<00:06:14.120> and<00:06:14.330> I<00:06:15.080> want

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:15.590 
one okay so now I cut my pipe and I want

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:17.590 
one okay so now I cut my pipe and I want
to<00:06:15.680> clean<00:06:15.920> it<00:06:16.010> up<00:06:16.160> I<00:06:16.340> want<00:06:16.730> to<00:06:16.850> put<00:06:17.150> the<00:06:17.270> end<00:06:17.420> cap

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:17.600 
to clean it up I want to put the end cap

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:19.780 
to clean it up I want to put the end cap
back<00:06:17.810> on<00:06:17.990> but<00:06:18.530> if<00:06:18.620> you<00:06:18.740> notice<00:06:18.890> you've<00:06:19.640> been

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:19.790 
back on but if you notice you've been

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:21.340 
back on but if you notice you've been
putting<00:06:20.060> so<00:06:20.210> much<00:06:20.330> pressure<00:06:20.630> on<00:06:20.990> the

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:21.350 
putting so much pressure on the

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:22.570 
putting so much pressure on the
circumference<00:06:21.710> of<00:06:21.890> this<00:06:22.010> pipe<00:06:22.220> that<00:06:22.460> it's

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:22.580 
circumference of this pipe that it's

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:25.270 
circumference of this pipe that it's
bent<00:06:22.820> the<00:06:22.970> pipe<00:06:23.180> in<00:06:23.390> as<00:06:23.600> you<00:06:24.140> cut<00:06:24.410> it<00:06:24.530> so<00:06:24.980> in

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:25.280 
bent the pipe in as you cut it so in

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:26.890 
bent the pipe in as you cut it so in
order<00:06:25.490> to<00:06:25.580> put<00:06:25.760> the<00:06:25.850> end<00:06:26.000> cap<00:06:26.270> back<00:06:26.480> on<00:06:26.720> you

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:26.900 
order to put the end cap back on you

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:28.660 
order to put the end cap back on you
have<00:06:27.050> to<00:06:27.200> create<00:06:27.350> the<00:06:27.590> same<00:06:27.800> size<00:06:28.040> diameter

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:28.670 
have to create the same size diameter

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:30.520 
have to create the same size diameter
that<00:06:29.030> it<00:06:29.180> was<00:06:29.330> before<00:06:29.600> you<00:06:29.930> took<00:06:30.080> the<00:06:30.200> end<00:06:30.320> cap

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:30.530 
that it was before you took the end cap

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:34.210 
that it was before you took the end cap
off<00:06:30.940> so<00:06:31.940> just<00:06:32.480> take<00:06:32.630> a<00:06:32.660> file<00:06:33.080> and<00:06:33.230> just<00:06:33.410> file

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:34.220 
off so just take a file and just file

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:38.290 
off so just take a file and just file
the<00:06:34.430> inside<00:06:34.790> down<00:06:36.550> once<00:06:37.550> it's<00:06:37.700> complete<00:06:38.060> the

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:38.300 
the inside down once it's complete the

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:41.020 
the inside down once it's complete the
end<00:06:38.420> cap<00:06:38.630> will<00:06:38.810> slide<00:06:38.990> right<00:06:39.020> back<00:06:39.230> on<00:06:40.030> well

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:41.030 
end cap will slide right back on well

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:42.370 
end cap will slide right back on well
