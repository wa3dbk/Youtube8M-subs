welcome to my garden so we've built this

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:14.650 
welcome to my garden so we've built this
trellis<00:00:11.900> and<00:00:12.290> we've<00:00:13.160> planted<00:00:13.490> the<00:00:13.730> grapes<00:00:14.000> now

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:14.660 
trellis and we've planted the grapes now

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:16.179 
trellis and we've planted the grapes now
it's<00:00:14.840> time<00:00:14.990> to<00:00:15.110> start<00:00:15.290> to<00:00:15.440> train<00:00:15.740> the<00:00:15.950> grapes

00:00:16.179 --> 00:00:16.189 
it's time to start to train the grapes

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:17.800 
it's time to start to train the grapes
along<00:00:16.520> the<00:00:16.730> trellis<00:00:17.090> so<00:00:17.240> that<00:00:17.390> you<00:00:17.509> can<00:00:17.689> get

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:17.810 
along the trellis so that you can get

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:19.689 
along the trellis so that you can get
some<00:00:18.020> some<00:00:18.529> good<00:00:18.710> spread<00:00:19.099> and<00:00:19.340> some<00:00:19.490> good

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:19.699

production there's a couple of different

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:24.070 
production there's a couple of different
products<00:00:22.400> that<00:00:22.460> you<00:00:22.550> can<00:00:22.760> use<00:00:22.900> you<00:00:23.900> can<00:00:23.990> use

products that you can use you can use

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.890 
products that you can use you can use
twine<00:00:24.410> that's<00:00:24.830> that's<00:00:25.250> perfectly<00:00:25.609> fine<00:00:25.900> you

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:26.900 
twine that's that's perfectly fine you

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.670 
twine that's that's perfectly fine you
can<00:00:27.470> use<00:00:28.000> twist<00:00:29.000> eyes<00:00:29.150> you<00:00:29.510> can<00:00:29.660> use<00:00:29.689> all<00:00:30.410> sorts

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:30.680 
can use twist eyes you can use all sorts

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:32.979 
can use twist eyes you can use all sorts
of<00:00:30.769> things<00:00:30.920> I<00:00:31.130> choose<00:00:31.519> to<00:00:32.119> use<00:00:32.330> two<00:00:32.689> different

00:00:32.979 --> 00:00:32.989 
of things I choose to use two different

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:35.020 
of things I choose to use two different
products<00:00:33.350> that<00:00:33.920> I<00:00:34.309> actually<00:00:34.640> pick<00:00:34.760> up<00:00:34.879> at<00:00:34.970> the

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:35.030 
products that I actually pick up at the

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:37.090 
products that I actually pick up at the
garden<00:00:35.300> store<00:00:35.480> one<00:00:35.809> is<00:00:35.930> a<00:00:35.960> velcro<00:00:36.350> tape<00:00:36.559> and

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:37.100 
garden store one is a velcro tape and

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.060 
garden store one is a velcro tape and
all<00:00:37.219> this<00:00:37.370> does<00:00:37.579> is<00:00:37.640> velcro's<00:00:38.570> onto<00:00:38.899> itself<00:00:39.170> it

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:40.070 
all this does is velcro's onto itself it

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.630 
all this does is velcro's onto itself it
works<00:00:40.219> quite<00:00:40.550> well<00:00:40.579> and<00:00:41.000> the<00:00:41.960> other<00:00:42.110> is<00:00:42.640> a

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:43.640 
works quite well and the other is a

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.970 
works quite well and the other is a
greenhouse<00:00:44.510> tape<00:00:44.780> and<00:00:45.379> this<00:00:45.500> works<00:00:45.710> as<00:00:45.860> well

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:45.980 
greenhouse tape and this works as well

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.430 
greenhouse tape and this works as well
you<00:00:46.160> just<00:00:46.370> break<00:00:47.329> a<00:00:47.390> little<00:00:47.629> bit<00:00:47.750> off<00:00:47.899> tie<00:00:48.379> it

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:48.440 
you just break a little bit off tie it

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.819 
you just break a little bit off tie it
up<00:00:48.620> and<00:00:48.860> it<00:00:49.579> doesn't<00:00:49.840> deteriorate<00:00:50.840> as<00:00:51.289> fast<00:00:51.590> in

00:00:51.819 --> 00:00:51.829 
up and it doesn't deteriorate as fast in

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:53.860 
up and it doesn't deteriorate as fast in
the<00:00:51.920> Sun<00:00:52.160> that's<00:00:52.789> you<00:00:53.180> know<00:00:53.270> stretchy<00:00:53.660> and

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870 
the Sun that's you know stretchy and

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.830 
the Sun that's you know stretchy and
forgiving<00:00:54.350> I<00:00:54.500> prefer<00:00:55.370> the<00:00:55.610> greenhouse<00:00:56.210> or<00:00:56.690> the

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:56.840 
forgiving I prefer the greenhouse or the

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.770 
forgiving I prefer the greenhouse or the
the<00:00:57.440> velcro<00:00:58.129> tape<00:00:58.460> because<00:00:58.699> you<00:00:58.820> can<00:00:58.969> you<00:00:59.600> can

00:00:59.770 --> 00:00:59.780 
the velcro tape because you can you can

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:01.990 
the velcro tape because you can you can
adjust<00:01:00.140> it<00:01:00.350> and<00:01:00.590> it's<00:01:00.829> there's<00:01:01.460> nothing<00:01:01.640> lost

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
adjust it and it's there's nothing lost

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.139 
adjust it and it's there's nothing lost
it's<00:01:02.329> a<00:01:02.420> little<00:01:02.600> less<00:01:02.780> harmful<00:01:03.530> on<00:01:03.620> the<00:01:03.710> plant

00:01:04.139 --> 00:01:04.149 
it's a little less harmful on the plant

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:06.940 
it's a little less harmful on the plant
so<00:01:05.149> what<00:01:05.600> we're<00:01:05.780> gonna<00:01:05.840> try<00:01:05.960> to<00:01:06.229> do<00:01:06.530> is<00:01:06.800> we're

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950 
so what we're gonna try to do is we're

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:08.920 
so what we're gonna try to do is we're
gonna<00:01:07.009> try<00:01:07.250> to<00:01:07.310> send<00:01:07.580> one<00:01:07.760> runner<00:01:08.270> on<00:01:08.510> the

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:08.930 
gonna try to send one runner on the

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:10.690 
gonna try to send one runner on the
lower<00:01:09.350> wire<00:01:09.680> that<00:01:10.250> way

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
lower wire that way

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.510 
lower wire that way
the<00:01:11.630> main<00:01:11.930> went<00:01:12.229> up<00:01:12.439> and<00:01:12.740> hopefully<00:01:13.220> we'll<00:01:13.400> get

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
the main went up and hopefully we'll get

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.880 
the main went up and hopefully we'll get
some<00:01:14.000> side<00:01:14.210> shoots<00:01:14.540> and<00:01:14.810> one<00:01:15.439> on<00:01:15.710> the<00:01:16.540> lower

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:17.890 
some side shoots and one on the lower

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.350 
some side shoots and one on the lower
trellis<00:01:18.890> the<00:01:19.100> other<00:01:19.250> way<00:01:19.460> so<00:01:19.970> that<00:01:20.090> we<00:01:20.180> can

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 
trellis the other way so that we can

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.140 
trellis the other way so that we can
kind<00:01:20.570> of<00:01:20.600> maximize<00:01:21.140> the<00:01:21.640> area<00:01:22.640> that<00:01:23.000> it's

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:23.150 
kind of maximize the area that it's

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.510 
kind of maximize the area that it's
getting<00:01:23.330> the<00:01:23.540> Sun<00:01:23.810> and<00:01:24.049> covering<00:01:24.860> up<00:01:24.950> our<00:01:25.159> our

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 
getting the Sun and covering up our our

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.340 
getting the Sun and covering up our our
fence<00:01:25.850> here<00:01:26.150> so<00:01:26.780> why<00:01:26.869> don't<00:01:27.020> you<00:01:27.049> come<00:01:27.229> in

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
closer and I'll show you how I'm gonna

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.340 
closer and I'll show you how I'm gonna
do<00:01:28.790> this<00:01:28.939> and<00:01:29.150> some<00:01:29.270> of<00:01:29.299> the<00:01:29.509> neat<00:01:30.259> little

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.350 
do this and some of the neat little

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.850 
do this and some of the neat little
things<00:01:30.650> that<00:01:30.710> grapes<00:01:30.979> do<00:01:31.250> to<00:01:31.400> climb<00:01:32.619> so<00:01:33.619> grapes

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 
things that grapes do to climb so grapes

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.620 
things that grapes do to climb so grapes
put<00:01:34.159> out<00:01:34.250> these<00:01:34.460> little<00:01:34.790> things<00:01:35.000> and<00:01:35.479> most

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
put out these little things and most

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.330 
put out these little things and most
vines<00:01:35.960> do<00:01:36.229> this<00:01:36.409> it's<00:01:36.710> called<00:01:36.829> a<00:01:36.979> tendril

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
vines do this it's called a tendril

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.030 
vines do this it's called a tendril
these<00:01:37.939> things<00:01:38.210> are<00:01:38.360> an<00:01:38.479> amazingly<00:01:39.140> tough<00:01:39.530> and

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:40.040 
these things are an amazingly tough and

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.310 
these things are an amazingly tough and
once<00:01:40.340> they<00:01:40.520> wind<00:01:40.759> on<00:01:40.939> there<00:01:41.240> they<00:01:41.630> they<00:01:42.049> can

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 
once they wind on there they they can

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.730 
once they wind on there they they can
take<00:01:42.470> quite<00:01:42.680> a<00:01:42.710> quite<00:01:43.670> a<00:01:43.909> bit<00:01:44.210> of<00:01:44.390> abuse<00:01:44.900> so

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
take quite a quite a bit of abuse so

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.950 
take quite a quite a bit of abuse so
what<00:01:45.890> we're<00:01:46.040> actually<00:01:46.189> gonna<00:01:46.460> do<00:01:46.720> is<00:01:47.720> that

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
what we're actually gonna do is that

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.539 
what we're actually gonna do is that
this<00:01:48.200> has<00:01:48.380> already<00:01:48.530> grabbed<00:01:48.890> it<00:01:49.040> but<00:01:49.189> we<00:01:49.280> want

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:49.549 
this has already grabbed it but we want

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:52.929 
this has already grabbed it but we want
to<00:01:49.640> really<00:01:49.909> align<00:01:50.299> this<00:01:51.079> up<00:01:51.380> nicely<00:01:52.189> so<00:01:52.759> that

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:52.939 
to really align this up nicely so that

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:55.870 
to really align this up nicely so that
it<00:01:53.119> runs<00:01:53.509> along<00:01:53.899> the<00:01:54.079> cable<00:01:54.290> and<00:01:54.799> we're<00:01:55.729> just

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
it runs along the cable and we're just

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.469 
it runs along the cable and we're just
going<00:01:56.090> to<00:01:56.149> take<00:01:56.360> this<00:01:57.310> velcro<00:01:58.310> tape<00:01:58.700> and<00:01:58.939> not

00:01:59.469 --> 00:01:59.479 
going to take this velcro tape and not

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:01.480 
going to take this velcro tape and not
tight<00:01:59.869> you<00:02:00.259> don't<00:02:00.439> want<00:02:00.590> to<00:02:00.680> ever<00:02:00.860> make<00:02:01.189> it<00:02:01.310> too

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
tight you don't want to ever make it too

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:03.940 
tight you don't want to ever make it too
tight<00:02:01.700> if<00:02:02.390> you<00:02:02.570> make<00:02:02.719> it<00:02:02.869> too<00:02:02.990> tight<00:02:03.259> it<00:02:03.710> can

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
tight if you make it too tight it can

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.880 
tight if you make it too tight it can
either<00:02:04.159> strangle<00:02:04.729> the<00:02:04.820> plant<00:02:05.060> or<00:02:06.049> during<00:02:06.799> a

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
either strangle the plant or during a

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.490 
either strangle the plant or during a
windstorm<00:02:07.310> it<00:02:07.909> can<00:02:08.119> break<00:02:08.360> the<00:02:08.600> plant<00:02:08.869> you

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
windstorm it can break the plant you

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.190 
windstorm it can break the plant you
want<00:02:09.709> to<00:02:09.829> leave<00:02:10.310> it<00:02:10.429> a<00:02:10.489> little<00:02:10.640> bit<00:02:10.850> of<00:02:10.970> play<00:02:11.239> so

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
want to leave it a little bit of play so

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.449 
want to leave it a little bit of play so
we're<00:02:12.349> just<00:02:12.379> going<00:02:12.590> to<00:02:12.650> extend<00:02:13.010> this<00:02:13.099> as<00:02:13.280> much

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
we're just going to extend this as much

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:17.320 
we're just going to extend this as much
as<00:02:13.580> we<00:02:13.700> can<00:02:14.319> and<00:02:15.730> wrap<00:02:16.730> the

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
as we can and wrap the

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.660 
as we can and wrap the
and<00:02:17.420> roll<00:02:17.600> around<00:02:17.690> in<00:02:18.230> this<00:02:18.620> growth<00:02:18.890> tip<00:02:19.280> we're

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
and roll around in this growth tip we're

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.170 
and roll around in this growth tip we're
going<00:02:19.700> to<00:02:19.850> continue<00:02:20.240> to<00:02:20.660> attach<00:02:21.050> so<00:02:21.770> that<00:02:21.920> it

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
going to continue to attach so that it

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:28.270 
going to continue to attach so that it
grows<00:02:23.180> along<00:02:23.510> this<00:02:23.690> side<00:02:24.850> so<00:02:25.850> the<00:02:25.970> main<00:02:27.280> growth

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
grows along this side so the main growth

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.910 
grows along this side so the main growth
tip<00:02:28.700> we're<00:02:29.090> just<00:02:29.330> going<00:02:29.570> to<00:02:29.630> actually<00:02:29.990> tie

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
tip we're just going to actually tie

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.970 
tip we're just going to actually tie
with<00:02:31.100> this<00:02:31.280> greenhouse<00:02:31.640> tape<00:02:32.620> to<00:02:33.620> of<00:02:33.800> the

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:40.060 
bamboo now any little Newkirk rabbit
crevice<00:02:38.030> those<00:02:38.270> tendrils<00:02:38.720> will<00:02:38.840> grab<00:02:39.080> it<00:02:39.110> this

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:40.070 
crevice those tendrils will grab it this

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:41.740 
crevice those tendrils will grab it this
will<00:02:40.220> just<00:02:40.340> help<00:02:40.460> continue<00:02:41.180> to<00:02:41.330> Train<00:02:41.600> it

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
will just help continue to Train it

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.870 
will just help continue to Train it
vertically<00:02:42.110> because<00:02:42.320> this<00:02:42.680> the<00:02:43.370> main<00:02:43.610> one

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
vertically because this the main one

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.620 
vertically because this the main one
will<00:02:44.360> be<00:02:44.480> a<00:02:45.380> very<00:02:46.250> important<00:02:46.940> part<00:02:47.180> of<00:02:47.450> our

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630 
will be a very important part of our

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:51.220 
will be a very important part of our
perennial<00:02:48.500> grape<00:02:49.390> over<00:02:50.390> the<00:02:50.540> long<00:02:50.750> run

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
perennial grape over the long run

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.680 
perennial grape over the long run
so<00:02:51.710> we<00:02:51.800> just<00:02:51.950> want<00:02:52.130> to<00:02:52.250> Snug<00:02:52.880> that<00:02:53.060> up<00:02:53.240> again

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
so we just want to Snug that up again

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:57.580 
so we just want to Snug that up again
leaving<00:02:54.020> a<00:02:54.080> little<00:02:54.290> bit<00:02:54.500> of<00:02:54.590> space<00:02:54.860> so<00:02:56.440> that<00:02:57.440> it

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
leaving a little bit of space so that it

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:02.110 
leaving a little bit of space so that it
can<00:02:57.890> climb<00:02:58.130> vertically<00:03:00.220> so<00:03:01.220> this<00:03:01.400> left<00:03:01.760> lead

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
can climb vertically so this left lead

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.590 
can climb vertically so this left lead
is<00:03:03.070> we<00:03:04.070> tried<00:03:04.280> to<00:03:04.400> orient<00:03:04.670> it<00:03:04.790> as<00:03:05.000> best<00:03:05.510> we

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:05.600 
is we tried to orient it as best we

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:06.280 
is we tried to orient it as best we
could

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
could

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.050 
could
but<00:03:06.560> if<00:03:06.650> pushing<00:03:07.040> out<00:03:07.190> quite<00:03:07.670> a<00:03:07.700> bit<00:03:07.850> further

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
but if pushing out quite a bit further

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.360 
but if pushing out quite a bit further
from<00:03:08.390> the<00:03:08.600> trellis<00:03:08.930> than<00:03:09.140> we'd<00:03:09.320> like<00:03:09.350> so<00:03:10.280> all

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
from the trellis than we'd like so all

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:11.890 
from the trellis than we'd like so all
I'm<00:03:10.520> gonna<00:03:10.640> do<00:03:10.910> is<00:03:11.120> I've<00:03:11.270> already<00:03:11.480> attached

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
I'm gonna do is I've already attached

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.040 
I'm gonna do is I've already attached
the<00:03:12.230> lead<00:03:12.830> to<00:03:13.700> the<00:03:13.820> trellis<00:03:14.030> wire<00:03:14.390> I'm<00:03:14.870> just

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:15.050 
the lead to the trellis wire I'm just

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:21.880 
the lead to the trellis wire I'm just
gonna<00:03:15.170> use<00:03:15.320> this<00:03:15.500> bamboo<00:03:17.110> temporarily<00:03:20.140> to<00:03:21.140> I'm

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:21.890 
gonna use this bamboo temporarily to I'm

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:24.190 
gonna use this bamboo temporarily to I'm
gonna<00:03:22.160> sneak<00:03:22.430> that<00:03:22.580> behind<00:03:22.970> so<00:03:23.870> to<00:03:23.930> provide

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
gonna sneak that behind so to provide

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.420 
gonna sneak that behind so to provide
tension<00:03:24.590> to<00:03:25.070> continue<00:03:25.519> to<00:03:25.700> train<00:03:26.380> this

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
tension to continue to train this

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:33.940 
tension to continue to train this
towards<00:03:29.170> the<00:03:31.480> trellis<00:03:32.480> wire<00:03:32.720> and<00:03:33.380> that<00:03:33.590> should

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:33.950 
towards the trellis wire and that should

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:37.960 
towards the trellis wire and that should
help<00:03:34.310> keep<00:03:35.000> it<00:03:35.260> growing<00:03:36.260> that<00:03:36.650> way<00:03:36.880> even<00:03:37.880> in

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
help keep it growing that way even in

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:39.280 
help keep it growing that way even in
the<00:03:38.060> wind<00:03:38.239> it<00:03:38.360> doesn't<00:03:38.630> need<00:03:38.720> to<00:03:38.810> be<00:03:38.900> tight

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.290 
the wind it doesn't need to be tight

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:40.840 
the wind it doesn't need to be tight
doesn't<00:03:39.709> need<00:03:39.830> to<00:03:39.980> be<00:03:40.100> attached<00:03:40.430> here<00:03:40.730> it'll

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:40.850 
doesn't need to be attached here it'll

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:43.360 
doesn't need to be attached here it'll
just<00:03:40.940> continue<00:03:41.269> to<00:03:41.690> Train<00:03:41.930> this<00:03:42.080> gently<00:03:42.530> the

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
just continue to Train this gently the

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:48.130 
just continue to Train this gently the
direction<00:03:43.850> that<00:03:43.940> we<00:03:44.090> would<00:03:44.269> like<00:03:44.450> it<00:03:47.140> just

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:48.140 
direction that we would like it just

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:51.040 
direction that we would like it just
adjust<00:03:48.560> that<00:03:48.739> and<00:03:49.190> for<00:03:50.120> now<00:03:50.300> until<00:03:50.690> this<00:03:50.840> is

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:51.050 
adjust that and for now until this is

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:57.520 
adjust that and for now until this is
trained<00:03:53.739> same<00:03:54.739> way<00:03:55.070> that<00:03:55.430> I<00:03:55.489> want<00:03:55.970> it<00:03:56.530> I'm

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
trained same way that I want it I'm

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:59.800 
trained same way that I want it I'm
going<00:03:57.860> to<00:03:57.980> do<00:03:58.190> so<00:03:59.060> I'm<00:03:59.150> gonna<00:03:59.269> detach<00:03:59.630> this

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
going to do so I'm gonna detach this

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:01.240 
going to do so I'm gonna detach this
just<00:04:00.110> a<00:04:00.170> little<00:04:00.260> bit<00:04:00.410> tighter<00:04:00.860> than<00:04:00.980> I

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.250 
just a little bit tighter than I

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:05.460 
just a little bit tighter than I
normally<00:04:01.310> would<00:04:02.860> and<00:04:03.860> that<00:04:04.010> is<00:04:04.190> to<00:04:04.400> keep<00:04:04.580> this

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:05.470 
normally would and that is to keep this

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:11.890 
normally would and that is to keep this
going<00:04:08.950> and<00:04:09.950> we've<00:04:10.220> already<00:04:10.370> attached<00:04:10.790> it<00:04:11.090> the

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:11.900 
going and we've already attached it the

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:16.930 
going and we've already attached it the
right<00:04:12.860> leader<00:04:13.209> to<00:04:14.209> the<00:04:14.780> trellis<00:04:15.280> we<00:04:16.280> just<00:04:16.519> now

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:16.940 
right leader to the trellis we just now

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:20.320 
right leader to the trellis we just now
need<00:04:17.180> to<00:04:17.299> train<00:04:17.540> it<00:04:17.660> down<00:04:18.350> to<00:04:18.830> run<00:04:18.979> along<00:04:19.310> it<00:04:19.609> so

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:20.330 
need to train it down to run along it so

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:22.600 
need to train it down to run along it so
you<00:04:20.390> want<00:04:20.750> to<00:04:20.840> do<00:04:20.989> this<00:04:21.140> as<00:04:21.350> it's<00:04:21.650> growing<00:04:21.919> to

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:22.610 
you want to do this as it's growing to

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:24.280 
you want to do this as it's growing to
make<00:04:22.760> sure<00:04:22.910> that<00:04:23.150> you're<00:04:23.300> not<00:04:23.419> it's<00:04:24.050> as

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:24.290 
make sure that you're not it's as

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:27.700 
make sure that you're not it's as
flexible<00:04:24.740> as<00:04:24.890> possible<00:04:25.690> and<00:04:26.690> just<00:04:26.720> attach<00:04:27.680> it

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:27.710 
flexible as possible and just attach it

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:29.280 
flexible as possible and just attach it
like<00:04:27.919> that

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:29.290 
like that

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:31.330 
like that
so<00:04:30.290> the<00:04:30.410> grapes<00:04:30.560> have<00:04:30.800> been<00:04:30.920> in<00:04:31.040> the<00:04:31.160> ground

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:31.340 
so the grapes have been in the ground

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:33.850 
so the grapes have been in the ground
for<00:04:31.610> about<00:04:31.670> six<00:04:32.000> weeks<00:04:32.210> now<00:04:32.450> and<00:04:32.810> we've<00:04:33.710> been

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:33.860 
for about six weeks now and we've been

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:36.790 
for about six weeks now and we've been
training<00:04:34.250> them<00:04:34.400> using<00:04:34.760> the<00:04:34.850> velcro<00:04:35.240> tape<00:04:35.800> one

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:36.800 
training them using the velcro tape one

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.930 
training them using the velcro tape one
out<00:04:37.120> on<00:04:38.120> each<00:04:38.750> side<00:04:39.050> one<00:04:39.620> vertical<00:04:40.190> and<00:04:40.520> when

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:40.940 
out on each side one vertical and when

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:42.490 
out on each side one vertical and when
this<00:04:41.120> one<00:04:41.300> gets<00:04:41.420> to<00:04:41.600> the<00:04:41.690> top<00:04:41.870> we'll<00:04:42.080> actually

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:42.500 
this one gets to the top we'll actually

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:44.290 
this one gets to the top we'll actually
pinch<00:04:42.770> it<00:04:42.950> and<00:04:43.280> okay<00:04:43.610> and<00:04:43.700> hopefully<00:04:44.150> it'll

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:44.300 
pinch it and okay and hopefully it'll

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:46.960 
pinch it and okay and hopefully it'll
send<00:04:44.540> some<00:04:44.780> side<00:04:44.990> shoots<00:04:45.320> so<00:04:46.130> we've<00:04:46.370> we've<00:04:46.760> let

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:46.970 
send some side shoots so we've we've let

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:49.660 
send some side shoots so we've we've let
the<00:04:47.150> grape<00:04:47.450> establish<00:04:48.350> for<00:04:48.560> six<00:04:48.770> weeks<00:04:48.950> what

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:49.670 
the grape establish for six weeks what

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:51.340 
the grape establish for six weeks what
we<00:04:49.790> need<00:04:49.940> to<00:04:50.060> do<00:04:50.180> now<00:04:50.390> is<00:04:50.570> actually<00:04:50.720> clear<00:04:51.170> out

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:51.350 
we need to do now is actually clear out

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:54.250 
we need to do now is actually clear out
the<00:04:51.530> underbrush<00:04:52.100> here<00:04:52.610> so<00:04:53.150> basically<00:04:53.510> any<00:04:53.810> any

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:54.260 
the underbrush here so basically any any

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.070 
the underbrush here so basically any any
of<00:04:54.440> these<00:04:55.030> branches<00:04:56.030> that<00:04:56.180> are<00:04:56.240> not<00:04:56.840> going

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:57.080 
of these branches that are not going

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:58.690 
of these branches that are not going
anywhere<00:04:57.320> that<00:04:57.530> aren't<00:04:57.800> on<00:04:57.920> the<00:04:58.010> main<00:04:58.160> trellis

00:04:58.690 --> 00:04:58.700 
anywhere that aren't on the main trellis

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:00.280 
anywhere that aren't on the main trellis
we're<00:04:59.120> gonna<00:04:59.240> take<00:04:59.510> off<00:04:59.690> and<00:04:59.720> that<00:04:59.990> what

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:00.290 
we're gonna take off and that what

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:02.500 
we're gonna take off and that what
that'll<00:05:00.560> do<00:05:00.740> is<00:05:00.920> that'll<00:05:01.100> force<00:05:01.430> root<00:05:02.240> growth

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:02.510 
that'll do is that'll force root growth

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:04.510 
that'll do is that'll force root growth
and<00:05:02.780> that'll<00:05:03.290> also<00:05:03.590> force<00:05:03.860> the<00:05:04.040> vertical

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:04.520 
and that'll also force the vertical

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:06.250 
and that'll also force the vertical
growth<00:05:04.730> all<00:05:04.940> the<00:05:05.150> energy<00:05:05.480> into<00:05:05.780> the<00:05:05.930> the

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:06.260 
growth all the energy into the the

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:09.010 
growth all the energy into the the
branches<00:05:06.680> we<00:05:06.800> want<00:05:07.070> so<00:05:07.430> as<00:05:08.210> painful<00:05:08.720> as<00:05:08.840> this

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:09.020 
branches we want so as painful as this

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:11.470 
branches we want so as painful as this
is<00:05:09.080> you<00:05:09.890> just<00:05:10.100> take<00:05:10.280> your<00:05:10.430> pruners<00:05:10.760> and<00:05:11.000> clip

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:11.480 
is you just take your pruners and clip

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:17.320 
is you just take your pruners and clip
now<00:05:12.170> you<00:05:12.230> don't<00:05:12.560> want<00:05:12.830> to<00:05:13.180> compost<00:05:14.180> this<00:05:16.330> that

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:17.330 
now you don't want to compost this that

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:19.570 
now you don't want to compost this that
there's<00:05:18.110> there's<00:05:18.590> a<00:05:18.650> better<00:05:18.890> chance<00:05:18.980> of

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:19.580 
there's there's a better chance of

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:24.430 
there's there's a better chance of
having<00:05:21.490> problems<00:05:22.490> if<00:05:23.090> you<00:05:23.360> do<00:05:23.570> compost<00:05:24.140> it

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:24.440 
having problems if you do compost it

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:28.900 
having problems if you do compost it
because<00:05:25.430> of<00:05:26.020> scale<00:05:27.020> insects<00:05:27.740> so<00:05:28.040> I<00:05:28.310> have

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:28.910 
because of scale insects so I have

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:30.910 
because of scale insects so I have
noticed<00:05:29.150> some<00:05:29.390> damage<00:05:29.840> on<00:05:29.990> these<00:05:30.230> of<00:05:30.530> skin

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:30.920 
noticed some damage on these of skin

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:33.160 
noticed some damage on these of skin
from<00:05:31.310> scale<00:05:31.670> insects<00:05:32.180> and<00:05:32.690> we<00:05:32.780> just<00:05:32.990> need<00:05:33.140> to

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:33.170 
from scale insects and we just need to

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:36.990 
from scale insects and we just need to
take<00:05:33.530> care<00:05:33.770> of<00:05:33.830> it<00:05:34.570> early<00:05:35.570> on<00:05:35.600> as<00:05:35.870> we<00:05:36.020> can<00:05:36.320> and

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:37.000 
take care of it early on as we can and

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.120 
take care of it early on as we can and
protect<00:05:38.000> ourselves<00:05:38.650> so<00:05:39.650> we're<00:05:39.770> also<00:05:39.950> gonna

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:40.130 
protect ourselves so we're also gonna

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:45.070 
protect ourselves so we're also gonna
take<00:05:40.370> off<00:05:40.550> any<00:05:40.700> damaged<00:05:41.090> leaves<00:05:43.780> and<00:05:44.780> briefs

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:45.080 
take off any damaged leaves and briefs

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:48.070 
take off any damaged leaves and briefs
are<00:05:45.320> amazingly<00:05:45.980> resilient<00:05:46.430> plants<00:05:46.910> that<00:05:47.240> this

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:48.080 
are amazingly resilient plants that this

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:50.409 
are amazingly resilient plants that this
plant<00:05:48.470> will<00:05:48.710> bounce<00:05:48.950> back<00:05:49.130> not<00:05:49.700> a<00:05:49.730> problem<00:05:50.150> at

00:05:50.409 --> 00:05:50.419 
plant will bounce back not a problem at

00:05:50.419 --> 00:05:53.470 
plant will bounce back not a problem at
all<00:05:50.570> from<00:05:51.410> this<00:05:51.760> keeping<00:05:52.760> the<00:05:52.850> bottom<00:05:53.060> clear

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:53.480 
all from this keeping the bottom clear

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:55.780 
all from this keeping the bottom clear
what<00:05:53.810> this<00:05:53.930> does<00:05:54.200> is<00:05:54.380> it<00:05:54.500> keeps<00:05:54.860> air<00:05:55.250> flow<00:05:55.520> and

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:55.790 
what this does is it keeps air flow and

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:57.909 
what this does is it keeps air flow and
from<00:05:56.300> the<00:05:56.390> humidity<00:05:56.750> and<00:05:57.140> the<00:05:57.230> moisture<00:05:57.350> in

00:05:57.909 --> 00:05:57.919 
from the humidity and the moisture in

00:05:57.919 --> 00:06:00.220 
from the humidity and the moisture in
the<00:05:57.950> ground<00:05:58.040> to<00:05:58.970> the<00:05:59.000> leaves<00:05:59.360> the<00:06:00.050> better

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:00.230 
the ground to the leaves the better

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:02.980 
the ground to the leaves the better
there's<00:06:00.560> air<00:06:00.860> flow<00:06:01.130> here<00:06:01.580> they<00:06:02.120> less<00:06:02.450> likely

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:02.990 
there's air flow here they less likely

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:05.800 
there's air flow here they less likely
it<00:06:03.350> will<00:06:03.500> be<00:06:03.560> that<00:06:03.770> an<00:06:04.160> infection<00:06:04.820> of<00:06:04.940> any<00:06:05.419> sort

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:05.810 
it will be that an infection of any sort

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:07.420 
it will be that an infection of any sort
will<00:06:05.990> actually<00:06:06.350> hit<00:06:06.500> the<00:06:06.710> rest<00:06:06.890> of<00:06:07.070> the<00:06:07.160> grapes

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:07.430 
will actually hit the rest of the grapes

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:09.100 
will actually hit the rest of the grapes
which<00:06:07.700> is<00:06:07.850> also<00:06:08.030> why<00:06:08.300> we<00:06:08.330> have<00:06:08.570> it<00:06:08.690> a<00:06:08.750> foot<00:06:08.960> off

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:09.110 
which is also why we have it a foot off

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:12.640 
which is also why we have it a foot off
of<00:06:09.320> the<00:06:10.040> the<00:06:10.610> fence<00:06:10.820> so<00:06:11.120> that<00:06:11.270> it<00:06:11.419> has<00:06:11.900> air<00:06:12.260> flow

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:12.650 
of the the fence so that it has air flow

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:14.980 
of the the fence so that it has air flow
so<00:06:13.280> we've<00:06:13.430> now<00:06:13.610> clean<00:06:13.880> this<00:06:14.030> one<00:06:14.240> up<00:06:14.300> we'll

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:14.990 
so we've now clean this one up we'll

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:16.600
