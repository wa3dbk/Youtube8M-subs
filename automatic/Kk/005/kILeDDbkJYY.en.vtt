00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.510
 It was very strong, very different coming to Brazil. 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.430
 seems normal but has a certain way 7 teams have to be musicians 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.599
 It's good, have you heard? 

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:16.779
 football appeared in amsterdam in the netherlands almost 100 years ago 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:20.900
 but still little known here 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.429
 with almost 10 meters of the shoulder and in which his guess land lacked 

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:28.470
 first I thought nobody ever saw 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.089
 besides explaining this, you do not even know 

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:33.830
 The first time I heard between them they have more 

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:35.980
 there are eight players on each side 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.460
 four women and four men this rule does not 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:43.610
 The goal is to integrate 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:46.050
 following the interpol 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.620
 so different from what you've done so far 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.750
 very different in a timely manner 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.890
 the sport has its own rules most remembered 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:56.330
 formerly purse 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:58.810
 the player can not stay on the ground 

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:03.040
 just move on to another player or aline scabies party 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.780
 made of vinyl she stay a maximum height of three and a half meters 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.750
 hence the name of the sport 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.010
 Dutch cut means sixth 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.850
 - Just that the well-known good part is part of the world games beach 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.060
 the games happen with 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.620
 hugo de cascadura initiative of the teacher of education 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:28.620
 and explain marcelo 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:30.970
 viviane and luanda 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:33.870
 I intend to put in spirituality 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:37.870
 and I intend to give a demonstration of the Pan American Games in four 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:42.020
 years in Rio de Janeiro-2007 with this I'm sure that Botafogo will 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.970
 popularize 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.490
 the 70 students aged 10 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.320
 and 25 years of training that every Sunday 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.210
 And by the way, I will not leave the sport so soon. 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.270
 some physical progress 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.070
 with the preparation and such 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.060
 and feel good almost strong is not 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.100
 very violent 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:02.159
 can strengthen the cast
