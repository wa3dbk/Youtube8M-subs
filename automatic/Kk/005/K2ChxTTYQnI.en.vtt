Photoshop tutorial for you and this time
I<00:00:11.270> want<00:00:11.510> to<00:00:11.570> cover<00:00:11.780> increasing<00:00:12.650> contrast<00:00:13.250> in

00:00:13.449 --> 00:00:13.459 
I want to cover increasing contrast in

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:15.879 
I want to cover increasing contrast in
an<00:00:13.549> image<00:00:13.850> now<00:00:14.539> Photoshop<00:00:15.230> being<00:00:15.410> Photoshop

an image now Photoshop being Photoshop
there<00:00:16.010> are<00:00:16.100> countless<00:00:16.520> ways<00:00:16.789> that<00:00:17.029> we<00:00:17.119> can

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:17.240 
there are countless ways that we can

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.510 
there are countless ways that we can
increase<00:00:17.539> contrast<00:00:18.199> but<00:00:18.859> one<00:00:19.100> of<00:00:19.130> the<00:00:19.279> side

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:19.520 
increase contrast but one of the side

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.340 
increase contrast but one of the side
effects<00:00:19.820> generally<00:00:20.180> when<00:00:20.630> we<00:00:20.720> do<00:00:20.930> that<00:00:21.199> is

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:21.350 
effects generally when we do that is

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:22.929 
effects generally when we do that is
that<00:00:21.470> the<00:00:21.619> color<00:00:21.949> in<00:00:22.039> the<00:00:22.160> picture<00:00:22.490> can<00:00:22.669> become

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:22.939 
that the color in the picture can become

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:25.089 
that the color in the picture can become
quite<00:00:23.119> saturated<00:00:23.960> now<00:00:24.470> that<00:00:24.619> might<00:00:24.859> be<00:00:24.890> the

00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:25.099 
quite saturated now that might be the

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:26.919 
quite saturated now that might be the
kind<00:00:25.310> of<00:00:25.339> look<00:00:25.460> that<00:00:25.640> you're<00:00:25.730> going<00:00:25.910> for<00:00:26.089> but

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:26.929 
kind of look that you're going for but

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:28.419 
kind of look that you're going for but
if<00:00:27.019> you're<00:00:27.140> dealing<00:00:27.499> with<00:00:27.529> portraits<00:00:28.310> of

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:28.429 
if you're dealing with portraits of

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:30.669 
if you're dealing with portraits of
people<00:00:28.789> as<00:00:28.880> in<00:00:29.029> this<00:00:29.179> case<00:00:29.240> here<00:00:29.810> what<00:00:30.499> can

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:30.679 
people as in this case here what can

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:33.069 
people as in this case here what can
happen<00:00:30.890> is<00:00:31.249> when<00:00:31.460> you<00:00:32.060> increase<00:00:32.390> the<00:00:32.660> contrast

00:00:33.069 --> 00:00:33.079 
happen is when you increase the contrast

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:34.960 
happen is when you increase the contrast
that<00:00:33.320> colors<00:00:33.590> become<00:00:33.860> saturated<00:00:34.100> but<00:00:34.760> in<00:00:34.880> the

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:34.970 
that colors become saturated but in the

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:36.670 
that colors become saturated but in the
colors<00:00:35.300> in<00:00:35.390> this<00:00:35.570> instance<00:00:35.989> will<00:00:36.170> be<00:00:36.260> the<00:00:36.350> skin

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:36.680 
colors in this instance will be the skin

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.010 
colors in this instance will be the skin
tones<00:00:37.010> so<00:00:37.670> here's<00:00:37.850> what<00:00:37.970> I<00:00:38.000> mean<00:00:38.239> here<00:00:38.840> we<00:00:38.930> have

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:39.020 
tones so here's what I mean here we have

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:40.689 
tones so here's what I mean here we have
a<00:00:39.079> picture<00:00:39.320> in<00:00:39.379> front<00:00:39.410> of<00:00:39.739> us<00:00:39.920> and<00:00:40.100> just<00:00:40.489> our

00:00:40.689 --> 00:00:40.699 
a picture in front of us and just our

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:42.369 
a picture in front of us and just our
Waldo's<00:00:41.120> I'll<00:00:41.270> select<00:00:41.510> a<00:00:41.690> nice<00:00:41.870> strong

00:00:42.369 --> 00:00:42.379 
Waldo's I'll select a nice strong

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:44.439 
Waldo's I'll select a nice strong
contrast<00:00:43.070> just<00:00:43.309> for<00:00:43.430> illustration<00:00:43.820> purposes

00:00:44.439 --> 00:00:44.449 
contrast just for illustration purposes

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:46.930 
contrast just for illustration purposes
we<00:00:45.170> can<00:00:45.379> see<00:00:45.620> straight<00:00:45.920> away<00:00:46.039> that<00:00:46.190> contrast

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:46.940 
we can see straight away that contrast

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:48.939 
we can see straight away that contrast
has<00:00:47.059> been<00:00:47.210> added<00:00:47.539> but<00:00:48.109> also<00:00:48.500> when<00:00:48.649> we<00:00:48.710> look<00:00:48.739> at

00:00:48.939 --> 00:00:48.949 
has been added but also when we look at

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:51.099 
has been added but also when we look at
the<00:00:49.039> skin<00:00:49.370> tones<00:00:49.730> and<00:00:49.969> the<00:00:50.059> hair<00:00:50.390> the<00:00:50.660> color<00:00:50.960> in

00:00:51.099 --> 00:00:51.109 
the skin tones and the hair the color in

00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:53.110 
the skin tones and the hair the color in
those<00:00:51.260> areas<00:00:51.559> really<00:00:52.070> has<00:00:52.309> been<00:00:52.489> saturated<00:00:53.030> as

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:53.120 
those areas really has been saturated as

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.880 
those areas really has been saturated as
well<00:00:53.359> and<00:00:53.629> when<00:00:54.019> we're<00:00:54.140> looking<00:00:54.289> at<00:00:54.590> skin

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:54.890 
well and when we're looking at skin

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:56.200 
well and when we're looking at skin
tones<00:00:55.100> that's<00:00:55.309> not<00:00:55.579> the<00:00:55.730> kind<00:00:55.969> of<00:00:56.030> thing<00:00:56.179> that

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:56.210 
tones that's not the kind of thing that

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:57.490 
tones that's not the kind of thing that
we<00:00:56.329> want<00:00:56.510> to<00:00:56.570> do<00:00:56.719> because<00:00:57.050> it<00:00:57.140> just<00:00:57.289> does<00:00:57.469> not

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:57.500 
we want to do because it just does not

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.950 
we want to do because it just does not
realistic<00:00:58.280> one<00:00:59.120> way<00:00:59.300> that<00:00:59.449> we<00:00:59.570> can<00:00:59.690> deal<00:00:59.929> with

00:00:59.950 --> 00:00:59.960 
realistic one way that we can deal with

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.750 
realistic one way that we can deal with
that<00:01:00.140> is<00:01:00.440> because<00:01:00.620> this<00:01:00.949> curves<00:01:01.250> adjustment

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760 
that is because this curves adjustment

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.939 
that is because this curves adjustment
is<00:01:01.879> on<00:01:02.000> its<00:01:02.120> own<00:01:02.269> layer<00:01:02.539> we<00:01:03.109> have<00:01:03.260> available<00:01:03.559> to

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:03.949 
is on its own layer we have available to

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:05.920 
is on its own layer we have available to
us<00:01:04.070> all<00:01:04.190> the<00:01:04.280> blend<00:01:04.519> modes<00:01:04.790> and<00:01:05.059> if<00:01:05.510> I<00:01:05.660> select

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:05.930 
us all the blend modes and if I select

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.320 
us all the blend modes and if I select
luminosity<00:01:06.790> basically<00:01:07.790> what<00:01:07.970> I'm<00:01:08.060> telling

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:08.330 
luminosity basically what I'm telling

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.510 
luminosity basically what I'm telling
Photoshop<00:01:08.840> to<00:01:08.960> do<00:01:09.080> is<00:01:09.230> only<00:01:09.860> to<00:01:10.040> affect<00:01:10.369> the

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 
Photoshop to do is only to affect the

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.730 
Photoshop to do is only to affect the
light<00:01:10.820> and<00:01:11.150> dark<00:01:11.479> portions<00:01:12.140> of<00:01:12.229> the<00:01:12.350> picture

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
light and dark portions of the picture

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.310 
light and dark portions of the picture
but<00:01:13.220> not<00:01:13.400> the<00:01:13.610> colors<00:01:14.030> and<00:01:14.689> that<00:01:14.869> works<00:01:15.110> pretty

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:15.320 
but not the colors and that works pretty

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.120 
but not the colors and that works pretty
well<00:01:15.909> now<00:01:16.909> talking<00:01:17.360> of<00:01:17.570> luminosity<00:01:18.020> one<00:01:18.920> thing

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
well now talking of luminosity one thing

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:20.590 
well now talking of luminosity one thing
that<00:01:19.250> we<00:01:19.310> can<00:01:19.460> also<00:01:19.610> do<00:01:20.150> is<00:01:20.390> you<00:01:20.479> create

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600 
that we can also do is you create

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.740 
that we can also do is you create
luminosity<00:01:21.590> masks<00:01:22.189> one<00:01:22.820> for<00:01:23.030> the<00:01:23.090> shadows<00:01:23.479> and

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:23.750 
luminosity masks one for the shadows and

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.749 
luminosity masks one for the shadows and
one<00:01:24.229> for<00:01:24.409> the<00:01:24.470> highlights<00:01:25.040> so<00:01:25.250> that<00:01:25.460> we<00:01:25.549> can

00:01:25.749 --> 00:01:25.759 
one for the highlights so that we can

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:27.969 
one for the highlights so that we can
then<00:01:25.880> alter<00:01:26.329> the<00:01:26.659> values<00:01:27.229> of<00:01:27.380> the<00:01:27.470> shadows<00:01:27.860> and

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:27.979 
then alter the values of the shadows and

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:30.100 
then alter the values of the shadows and
the<00:01:28.070> heart<00:01:28.280> independently<00:01:29.240> of<00:01:29.329> each<00:01:29.420> other<00:01:29.600> to

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.110 
the heart independently of each other to

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.039 
the heart independently of each other to
get<00:01:30.259> the<00:01:30.320> car<00:01:30.590> look<00:01:30.799> we're<00:01:30.950> after<00:01:31.659> plus<00:01:32.659> what

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:33.049 
get the car look we're after plus what

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:35.139 
get the car look we're after plus what
we<00:01:33.140> can<00:01:33.320> do<00:01:33.560> we<00:01:33.920> can<00:01:33.950> create<00:01:34.310> actions<00:01:34.939> for

00:01:35.139 --> 00:01:35.149 
we can do we can create actions for

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:37.780 
we can do we can create actions for
those<00:01:35.299> so<00:01:35.780> that<00:01:35.810> later<00:01:36.140> on<00:01:36.530> our<00:01:36.770> workflow<00:01:37.610> can

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:37.790 
those so that later on our workflow can

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:39.880 
those so that later on our workflow can
become<00:01:38.030> so<00:01:38.299> much<00:01:38.450> quicker<00:01:38.750> and<00:01:39.140> here's<00:01:39.740> what<00:01:39.860> I

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 
become so much quicker and here's what I

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:40.840 
become so much quicker and here's what I
mean<00:01:39.950> right

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850 
mean right

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:42.370 
mean right
let's<00:01:41.090> say<00:01:41.240> we<00:01:41.329> have<00:01:41.450> this<00:01:41.570> portrait<00:01:42.049> in<00:01:42.170> front

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
let's say we have this portrait in front

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.109 
let's say we have this portrait in front
of<00:01:42.500> us<00:01:42.770> first<00:01:43.280> of<00:01:43.460> all<00:01:43.520> let's<00:01:43.729> create<00:01:43.969> an

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:44.119 
of us first of all let's create an

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:46.389 
of us first of all let's create an
action<00:01:44.479> for<00:01:44.659> boosting<00:01:45.020> the<00:01:45.110> highlights<00:01:45.590> so<00:01:46.310> we

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:46.399 
action for boosting the highlights so we

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:48.760 
action for boosting the highlights so we
go<00:01:46.520> to<00:01:46.549> our<00:01:46.670> actions<00:01:47.119> panel<00:01:47.450> here<00:01:47.780> and<00:01:47.990> we'll

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
go to our actions panel here and we'll

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:50.999 
go to our actions panel here and we'll
create<00:01:48.950> an<00:01:49.130> action<00:01:49.460> we<00:01:49.579> call<00:01:49.789> it<00:01:49.969> boost

00:01:50.999 --> 00:01:51.009 
create an action we call it boost

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:53.740 
create an action we call it boost
highlights<00:01:52.009> oops<00:01:52.820> didn't<00:01:53.240> misspell<00:01:53.509> it<00:01:53.570> right

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
highlights oops didn't misspell it right

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.600 
highlights oops didn't misspell it right
but<00:01:53.930> you<00:01:53.990> get<00:01:54.259> the<00:01:54.350> point<00:01:54.500> this<00:01:55.070> our<00:01:55.430> first

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 
but you get the point this our first

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:57.550 
but you get the point this our first
highlights<00:01:56.149> the<00:01:56.810> next<00:01:57.110> thing<00:01:57.259> we're<00:01:57.380> going<00:01:57.469> to

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
highlights the next thing we're going to

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.190 
highlights the next thing we're going to
do<00:01:57.770> we'll<00:01:58.340> come<00:01:58.490> over<00:01:58.610> to<00:01:58.759> our<00:01:58.820> channels<00:01:59.299> we'll

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
do we'll come over to our channels we'll

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.080 
do we'll come over to our channels we'll
hold<00:02:00.409> down<00:02:00.590> our<00:02:00.619> command<00:02:01.130> or<00:02:01.280> ctrl<00:02:01.670> key<00:02:01.909> and

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
hold down our command or ctrl key and

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.990 
hold down our command or ctrl key and
click<00:02:02.600> once<00:02:02.899> on<00:02:03.140> the<00:02:03.200> RGB<00:02:03.829> channel<00:02:04.280> and<00:02:04.460> when

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
click once on the RGB channel and when

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.700 
click once on the RGB channel and when
we<00:02:05.090> do<00:02:05.329> that<00:02:05.359> when<00:02:05.719> we<00:02:05.810> look<00:02:05.930> at<00:02:05.990> our<00:02:06.109> image<00:02:06.439> now

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
we do that when we look at our image now

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.109 
we do that when we look at our image now
we<00:02:06.770> can<00:02:07.039> see<00:02:07.189> we<00:02:07.280> have<00:02:07.310> marching<00:02:07.969> ants

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
we can see we have marching ants

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:09.940 
we can see we have marching ants
selecting<00:02:08.810> a<00:02:08.899> certain<00:02:09.110> part<00:02:09.500> of<00:02:09.619> the<00:02:09.680> picture

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
selecting a certain part of the picture

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:11.830 
selecting a certain part of the picture
and<00:02:10.399> basically<00:02:11.030> what<00:02:11.270> they're<00:02:11.390> doing<00:02:11.720> is

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
and basically what they're doing is

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.720 
and basically what they're doing is
they're<00:02:12.020> selecting<00:02:12.530> the<00:02:12.620> luminosity<00:02:13.160> values

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
they're selecting the luminosity values

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.699 
they're selecting the luminosity values
of<00:02:13.850> the<00:02:13.910> picture<00:02:14.330> which<00:02:14.959> is<00:02:15.080> an<00:02:15.170> effect<00:02:15.470> as<00:02:15.590> the

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
of the picture which is an effect as the

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:18.759 
of the picture which is an effect as the
highlight<00:02:16.220> areas<00:02:16.750> the<00:02:17.750> next<00:02:17.959> thing<00:02:18.080> I<00:02:18.200> do<00:02:18.440> is<00:02:18.650> I

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:18.769 
highlight areas the next thing I do is I

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:19.690 
highlight areas the next thing I do is I
go<00:02:18.950> back<00:02:19.190> to<00:02:19.340> our<00:02:19.459> layer

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
go back to our layer

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.449 
go back to our layer
panel<00:02:20.090> and<00:02:20.270> create<00:02:21.140> a<00:02:21.379> curves<00:02:21.800> adjustment

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
panel and create a curves adjustment

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:24.970 
panel and create a curves adjustment
layer<00:02:22.489> like<00:02:22.940> so<00:02:22.970> and<00:02:23.780> when<00:02:24.140> we<00:02:24.230> do<00:02:24.470> that<00:02:24.709> we<00:02:24.860> can

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
layer like so and when we do that we can

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:26.680 
layer like so and when we do that we can
see<00:02:25.040> that<00:02:25.400> the<00:02:25.550> mask<00:02:25.910> that<00:02:26.180> is<00:02:26.300> generally

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
see that the mask that is generally

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.380 
see that the mask that is generally
created<00:02:27.200> which<00:02:27.709> will<00:02:27.860> normally<00:02:28.040> be<00:02:28.250> plain<00:02:28.670> now

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
created which will normally be plain now

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.600 
created which will normally be plain now
has<00:02:29.660> the<00:02:29.810> luminosity<00:02:30.260> values<00:02:30.739> loaded<00:02:31.129> into<00:02:31.459> it

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
has the luminosity values loaded into it

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.270 
has the luminosity values loaded into it
so<00:02:32.060> any<00:02:32.269> adjustment<00:02:32.870> I<00:02:32.989> make<00:02:33.379> now<00:02:33.739> will<00:02:34.010> only

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
so any adjustment I make now will only

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.660 
so any adjustment I make now will only
affect<00:02:34.849> those<00:02:35.180> areas<00:02:35.890> so<00:02:36.890> the<00:02:37.130> next<00:02:37.340> thing<00:02:37.550> to

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
affect those areas so the next thing to

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.400 
affect those areas so the next thing to
do<00:02:37.819> will<00:02:38.090> become<00:02:38.390> for<00:02:38.690> adjustments<00:02:39.050> are

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
do will become for adjustments are

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:40.990 
do will become for adjustments are
curves<00:02:39.680> adjustment<00:02:40.099> here<00:02:40.310> and<00:02:40.670> I'll<00:02:40.760> put<00:02:40.970> a

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
curves adjustment here and I'll put a

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.449 
curves adjustment here and I'll put a
dot<00:02:41.300> in<00:02:41.480> the<00:02:41.569> line<00:02:41.810> in<00:02:42.110> the<00:02:42.500> top<00:02:42.830> portion<00:02:43.160> here

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.459 
dot in the line in the top portion here

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:45.160 
dot in the line in the top portion here
which<00:02:43.849> is<00:02:44.000> where<00:02:44.150> the<00:02:44.239> highlights<00:02:44.630> are<00:02:44.840> like

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
which is where the highlights are like

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.130 
which is where the highlights are like
so<00:02:45.590> and<00:02:45.890> I'll<00:02:46.519> use<00:02:46.730> my<00:02:46.760> up<00:02:47.030> arrow<00:02:47.180> key<00:02:47.330> just<00:02:47.989> to

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
so and I'll use my up arrow key just to

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:49.839 
so and I'll use my up arrow key just to
push<00:02:48.410> that<00:02:48.590> line<00:02:48.799> just<00:02:48.830> a<00:02:49.280> little<00:02:49.310> bit<00:02:49.640> higher

00:02:49.839 --> 00:02:49.849 
push that line just a little bit higher

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:52.690 
push that line just a little bit higher
there<00:02:50.209> so<00:02:50.480> increases<00:02:51.260> the<00:02:51.650> highlights<00:02:52.190> now

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
there so increases the highlights now

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:53.979 
there so increases the highlights now
what<00:02:52.849> I<00:02:52.880> do<00:02:52.970> that<00:02:53.299> we<00:02:53.420> can<00:02:53.569> see<00:02:53.720> that<00:02:53.870> the

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989 
what I do that we can see that the

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:55.539 
what I do that we can see that the
remainder<00:02:54.319> of<00:02:54.500> the<00:02:54.620> line<00:02:54.799> is<00:02:54.950> well<00:02:55.130> also<00:02:55.400> gets

00:02:55.539 --> 00:02:55.549 
remainder of the line is well also gets

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:57.460 
remainder of the line is well also gets
affected<00:02:56.060> and<00:02:56.180> I<00:02:56.209> don't<00:02:56.450> really<00:02:56.569> want<00:02:56.810> that<00:02:56.989> so

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
affected and I don't really want that so

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:58.330 
affected and I don't really want that so
I'm<00:02:57.590> just<00:02:57.680> going<00:02:57.829> to<00:02:57.860> put<00:02:58.010> a<00:02:58.040> few<00:02:58.310> more

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
I'm just going to put a few more

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.850 
I'm just going to put a few more
pointers<00:02:58.880> in<00:02:59.060> here<00:02:59.329> just<00:02:59.930> to<00:03:00.110> bring<00:03:00.380> this<00:03:00.590> line

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
pointers in here just to bring this line

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:03.490 
pointers in here just to bring this line
back<00:03:01.370> to<00:03:01.430> roughly<00:03:02.209> where<00:03:02.450> it<00:03:02.599> was<00:03:02.810> in<00:03:03.110> the

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
back to roughly where it was in the

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.140 
back to roughly where it was in the
first<00:03:03.739> place<00:03:04.010> so<00:03:04.160> it<00:03:04.250> follows<00:03:04.370> it's<00:03:04.610> kind<00:03:05.030> of

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
first place so it follows it's kind of

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.380 
first place so it follows it's kind of
like<00:03:05.269> as<00:03:05.390> original<00:03:05.810> path<00:03:06.079> like<00:03:07.010> so<00:03:07.519> and<00:03:08.269> then

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390 
like as original path like so and then

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:11.110 
like as original path like so and then
also<00:03:08.840> all<00:03:09.290> I<00:03:09.349> shall<00:03:09.799> do<00:03:09.920> then<00:03:10.160> is<00:03:10.340> lower<00:03:10.940> the

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
also all I shall do then is lower the

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:14.050 
also all I shall do then is lower the
opacity<00:03:11.209> of<00:03:11.599> this<00:03:11.780> layer<00:03:11.840> down<00:03:12.500> to<00:03:12.739> roughly<00:03:13.060> 25

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
opacity of this layer down to roughly 25

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.130 
opacity of this layer down to roughly 25
percent<00:03:14.090> something<00:03:14.930> like<00:03:15.079> that<00:03:16.000> okay<00:03:17.000> so<00:03:17.630> that

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.140 
percent something like that okay so that

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:22.300 
percent something like that okay so that
is<00:03:18.440> the<00:03:19.540> boost<00:03:20.540> the<00:03:20.810> highlights<00:03:21.349> action

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
is the boost the highlights action

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:25.539 
is the boost the highlights action
created<00:03:22.790> so<00:03:23.060> we'll<00:03:23.269> stop<00:03:24.109> that<00:03:24.319> there<00:03:24.620> will

00:03:25.539 --> 00:03:25.549 
created so we'll stop that there will

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:27.009 
created so we'll stop that there will
then<00:03:25.670> get<00:03:25.910> rid<00:03:26.030> of<00:03:26.090> this<00:03:26.329> because<00:03:26.720> we<00:03:26.810> now<00:03:26.989> I

00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:27.019 
then get rid of this because we now I

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:28.720 
then get rid of this because we now I
need<00:03:27.260> to<00:03:27.350> create<00:03:27.500> one<00:03:27.650> to<00:03:27.920> boost<00:03:28.160> the<00:03:28.340> shadows

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
need to create one to boost the shadows

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:31.120 
need to create one to boost the shadows
so<00:03:29.450> we'll<00:03:29.780> create<00:03:30.049> a<00:03:30.200> new<00:03:30.290> action<00:03:30.470> and<00:03:30.889> we'll

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.130 
so we'll create a new action and we'll

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:34.599 
so we'll create a new action and we'll
call<00:03:31.310> that<00:03:31.370> boost<00:03:32.319> shadows<00:03:33.319> and<00:03:34.190> we'll<00:03:34.459> move

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:34.609 
call that boost shadows and we'll move

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:36.879 
call that boost shadows and we'll move
that<00:03:34.790> aside<00:03:35.180> and<00:03:35.450> just<00:03:35.510> like<00:03:36.230> before<00:03:36.590> all

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:36.889 
that aside and just like before all

00:03:36.889 --> 00:03:38.949 
that aside and just like before all
we'll<00:03:37.100> do<00:03:37.250> is<00:03:37.400> come<00:03:37.549> up<00:03:37.639> the<00:03:37.790> channels<00:03:38.209> we'll

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:38.959 
we'll do is come up the channels we'll

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:40.840 
we'll do is come up the channels we'll
hold<00:03:39.200> down<00:03:39.380> our<00:03:39.500> command<00:03:39.859> or<00:03:39.980> control<00:03:40.370> key<00:03:40.639> and

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:40.850 
hold down our command or control key and

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:42.340 
hold down our command or control key and
what<00:03:41.150> we'll<00:03:41.299> do<00:03:41.389> that<00:03:41.569> we'll<00:03:41.780> then<00:03:41.900> click<00:03:42.139> once

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:42.350 
what we'll do that we'll then click once

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:45.039 
what we'll do that we'll then click once
on<00:03:42.590> the<00:03:42.650> RGB<00:03:43.220> channel<00:03:43.639> which<00:03:44.299> then<00:03:44.510> loads<00:03:44.840> in

00:03:45.039 --> 00:03:45.049 
on the RGB channel which then loads in

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:46.840 
on the RGB channel which then loads in
the<00:03:45.139> luminosity<00:03:45.650> values<00:03:46.160> of<00:03:46.310> the<00:03:46.400> picture

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:46.850 
the luminosity values of the picture

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:48.879 
the luminosity values of the picture
which<00:03:47.000> in<00:03:47.150> effect<00:03:47.239> is<00:03:47.510> the<00:03:47.660> highlights<00:03:48.139> but<00:03:48.769> we

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:48.889 
which in effect is the highlights but we

00:03:48.889 --> 00:03:50.229 
which in effect is the highlights but we
want<00:03:49.069> the<00:03:49.190> opposite<00:03:49.519> of<00:03:49.730> that<00:03:49.910> because<00:03:50.120> we

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:50.239 
want the opposite of that because we

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:52.509 
want the opposite of that because we
want<00:03:50.420> to<00:03:50.480> now<00:03:50.600> do<00:03:50.660> one<00:03:51.019> for<00:03:51.200> the<00:03:51.260> shadows<00:03:51.709> so<00:03:52.459> to

00:03:52.509 --> 00:03:52.519 
want to now do one for the shadows so to

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:54.699 
want to now do one for the shadows so to
select<00:03:53.060> the<00:03:53.150> opposite<00:03:53.569> all<00:03:53.720> we<00:03:53.870> do<00:03:54.049> come<00:03:54.590> to

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:54.709 
select the opposite all we do come to

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:55.840 
select the opposite all we do come to
the<00:03:54.769> top<00:03:54.920> of<00:03:54.950> the<00:03:55.100> screen<00:03:55.340> and<00:03:55.519> click<00:03:55.730> on

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:55.850 
the top of the screen and click on

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:59.530 
the top of the screen and click on
select<00:03:56.150> and<00:03:56.540> then<00:03:56.989> inverse<00:03:58.060> then<00:03:59.060> go<00:03:59.209> back<00:03:59.359> to

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
select and then inverse then go back to

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.569 
select and then inverse then go back to
layers<00:03:59.810> and<00:04:00.230> as<00:04:00.440> before<00:04:00.829> just<00:04:00.859> create<00:04:01.430> a<00:04:01.459> quick

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:01.579 
layers and as before just create a quick

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:04.720 
layers and as before just create a quick
curves<00:04:02.269> adjustment<00:04:02.930> like<00:04:03.230> so<00:04:03.739> and<00:04:04.459> when<00:04:04.639> we

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:04.730 
curves adjustment like so and when we

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:06.789 
curves adjustment like so and when we
come<00:04:04.940> over<00:04:04.970> to<00:04:05.359> the<00:04:05.480> layers<00:04:05.989> panel<00:04:06.260> now<00:04:06.470> we<00:04:06.530> can

00:04:06.789 --> 00:04:06.799 
come over to the layers panel now we can

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:08.890 
come over to the layers panel now we can
see<00:04:07.069> that<00:04:07.609> we<00:04:07.760> have<00:04:07.940> a<00:04:07.970> different<00:04:08.450> mask<00:04:08.660> which

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:08.900 
see that we have a different mask which

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:12.430 
see that we have a different mask which
is<00:04:08.930> now<00:04:09.319> selecting<00:04:10.250> the<00:04:11.060> shadow<00:04:11.810> values

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:12.440 
is now selecting the shadow values

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.050 
is now selecting the shadow values
within<00:04:12.739> the<00:04:12.859> picture<00:04:13.310> not<00:04:13.579> the<00:04:13.609> colors<00:04:14.030> just

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.060 
within the picture not the colors just

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.150 
within the picture not the colors just
the<00:04:14.359> dark<00:04:14.660> values<00:04:15.139> the<00:04:15.260> dark<00:04:15.560> luminosity

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:16.160 
the dark values the dark luminosity

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.940 
the dark values the dark luminosity
values<00:04:16.400> in<00:04:16.519> the<00:04:16.609> picture<00:04:16.910> okay<00:04:17.709> then<00:04:18.709> all<00:04:18.769> I'll

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:18.950 
values in the picture okay then all I'll

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:20.289 
values in the picture okay then all I'll
do<00:04:19.130> is<00:04:19.250> come<00:04:19.459> up<00:04:19.519> to<00:04:19.579> the<00:04:19.789> curves<00:04:20.180> adjustment

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:20.299 
do is come up to the curves adjustment

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:22.839 
do is come up to the curves adjustment
here<00:04:20.870> the<00:04:21.019> curve<00:04:21.229> line<00:04:21.530> and<00:04:22.190> we'll<00:04:22.430> put<00:04:22.639> one

00:04:22.839 --> 00:04:22.849 
here the curve line and we'll put one

00:04:22.849 --> 00:04:24.670 
here the curve line and we'll put one
dot<00:04:23.210> just<00:04:23.510> about<00:04:23.690> there<00:04:23.960> which<00:04:24.110> is<00:04:24.229> the<00:04:24.380> lower

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:24.680 
dot just about there which is the lower

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.230 
dot just about there which is the lower
left-hand<00:04:25.160> portion<00:04:25.370> of<00:04:25.669> the<00:04:25.729> line<00:04:25.940> which<00:04:26.120> is

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.240 
left-hand portion of the line which is

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.149 
left-hand portion of the line which is
where<00:04:26.360> the<00:04:26.450> shadows<00:04:26.840> are<00:04:27.050> and<00:04:27.289> use<00:04:27.710> my<00:04:27.890> down

00:04:28.149 --> 00:04:28.159 
where the shadows are and use my down

00:04:28.159 --> 00:04:29.680 
where the shadows are and use my down
arrow<00:04:28.190> we'll<00:04:28.760> just<00:04:28.940> bring<00:04:29.120> it<00:04:29.210> down<00:04:29.360> just<00:04:29.390> a

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:29.690 
arrow we'll just bring it down just a

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:31.529 
arrow we'll just bring it down just a
fraction<00:04:30.140> to<00:04:30.320> darken<00:04:30.919> those<00:04:31.010> shadows

00:04:31.529 --> 00:04:31.539 
fraction to darken those shadows

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:33.490 
fraction to darken those shadows
obviously<00:04:32.539> the<00:04:32.659> rest<00:04:32.840> of<00:04:32.990> the<00:04:33.050> line<00:04:33.200> has<00:04:33.320> been

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:33.500 
obviously the rest of the line has been

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:35.110 
obviously the rest of the line has been
altered<00:04:33.680> as<00:04:33.770> well<00:04:33.980> so<00:04:34.520> what<00:04:34.610> I'll<00:04:34.670> do<00:04:34.850> is<00:04:34.940> put<00:04:35.090> a

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:35.120 
altered as well so what I'll do is put a

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.180 
altered as well so what I'll do is put a
few<00:04:35.180> more<00:04:35.390> dots<00:04:35.870> around<00:04:36.110> here<00:04:36.500> to<00:04:36.710> bring<00:04:37.010> the

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:37.190 
few more dots around here to bring the

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:40.780 
few more dots around here to bring the
line<00:04:37.400> back<00:04:37.940> to<00:04:38.210> follow<00:04:38.560> its<00:04:39.560> original<00:04:40.160> path<00:04:40.490> or

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:40.790 
line back to follow its original path or

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:42.730 
line back to follow its original path or
as<00:04:41.030> near<00:04:41.270> as<00:04:41.300> damn<00:04:41.600> it<00:04:41.810> something<00:04:42.140> like<00:04:42.170> so<00:04:42.500> and

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:42.740 
as near as damn it something like so and

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.850 
as near as damn it something like so and
reduce<00:04:43.670> the<00:04:43.850> opacity<00:04:43.910> of<00:04:44.270> that<00:04:44.330> layer<00:04:44.510> down<00:04:45.020> to

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:45.860 
reduce the opacity of that layer down to

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:50.050 
reduce the opacity of that layer down to
25%<00:04:46.370> as<00:04:46.970> well<00:04:48.040> okay<00:04:49.040> and<00:04:49.250> then<00:04:49.610> we'll<00:04:49.790> short

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:50.060 
25% as well okay and then we'll short

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:53.290 
25% as well okay and then we'll short
stop<00:04:50.420> recording<00:04:51.140> so<00:04:51.460> now<00:04:52.460> what<00:04:52.730> we've<00:04:52.880> done<00:04:53.120> we

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:53.300 
stop recording so now what we've done we

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:55.960 
stop recording so now what we've done we
can<00:04:53.450> see<00:04:53.690> we've<00:04:53.870> created<00:04:54.020> two<00:04:54.770> actions<00:04:55.250> one

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:55.970 
can see we've created two actions one

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:57.940 
can see we've created two actions one
for<00:04:56.180> boosting<00:04:56.450> the<00:04:56.540> highlights<00:04:57.020> and<00:04:57.350> one<00:04:57.770> for

00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:57.950 
for boosting the highlights and one for

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:00.220 
for boosting the highlights and one for
boosting<00:04:58.280> the<00:04:58.430> shadows<00:04:58.880> but<00:04:59.450> none<00:04:59.840> of<00:04:59.870> those

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:00.230 
boosting the shadows but none of those

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:02.470 
boosting the shadows but none of those
boosts<00:05:00.980> in<00:05:01.130> contrast<00:05:01.610> will<00:05:01.790> affect<00:05:02.090> the<00:05:02.240> color

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:02.480 
boosts in contrast will affect the color

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:05.470 
boosts in contrast will affect the color
we<00:05:03.320> can<00:05:03.470> now<00:05:03.590> use<00:05:03.620> those<00:05:04.220> in<00:05:04.430> later<00:05:04.700> sort<00:05:05.390> of

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:05.480 
we can now use those in later sort of

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:07.390 
we can now use those in later sort of
post-processing<00:05:06.140> to<00:05:06.380> speed<00:05:06.680> up<00:05:06.770> our<00:05:06.860> workflow

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:07.400 
post-processing to speed up our workflow

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.490 
post-processing to speed up our workflow
so<00:05:08.240> let's<00:05:08.690> just<00:05:08.870> say<00:05:08.990> we've<00:05:09.110> got<00:05:09.200> this<00:05:09.290> picture

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:09.500 
so let's just say we've got this picture

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:11.890 
so let's just say we've got this picture
here<00:05:09.860> and<00:05:10.040> I<00:05:10.160> want<00:05:10.430> to<00:05:10.490> increase<00:05:10.850> the<00:05:11.000> shadow

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:11.900 
here and I want to increase the shadow

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:14.350 
here and I want to increase the shadow
areas<00:05:12.380> this<00:05:12.530> picture<00:05:12.950> all<00:05:13.520> I<00:05:13.550> need<00:05:13.790> to<00:05:13.910> do<00:05:14.090> is

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:14.360 
areas this picture all I need to do is

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:16.430 
click on the area here that says boost

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:18.730 
click on the area here that says boost
shadows<00:05:16.760> in<00:05:16.910> my<00:05:17.030> actions<00:05:17.390> panel<00:05:17.690> and<00:05:17.990> just

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:18.740 
shadows in my actions panel and just

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:21.190 
shadows in my actions panel and just
click<00:05:18.980> play<00:05:19.310> and<00:05:19.660> we<00:05:20.660> can<00:05:20.810> see<00:05:20.930> that<00:05:21.050> each<00:05:21.169> time

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:21.200 
click play and we can see that each time

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:24.070 
click play and we can see that each time
I<00:05:21.470> do<00:05:21.590> that<00:05:22.010> the<00:05:23.000> shadow<00:05:23.330> portions<00:05:23.900> of<00:05:23.990> the

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:24.080 
I do that the shadow portions of the

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:26.260 
I do that the shadow portions of the
picture<00:05:24.440> are<00:05:24.620> going<00:05:24.740> to<00:05:24.800> be<00:05:24.980> go<00:05:25.580> made<00:05:25.880> a<00:05:26.060> lot

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:26.270 
picture are going to be go made a lot

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:29.170 
picture are going to be go made a lot
darker<00:05:26.600> and<00:05:27.130> now<00:05:28.130> if<00:05:28.310> I've<00:05:28.460> sort<00:05:28.730> of<00:05:28.790> come<00:05:28.970> over

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:29.180 
darker and now if I've sort of come over

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:30.670 
darker and now if I've sort of come over
to<00:05:29.300> the<00:05:29.390> layers<00:05:29.630> panel<00:05:29.930> here<00:05:30.080> and<00:05:30.350> I'll<00:05:30.650> just

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:30.680 
to the layers panel here and I'll just

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:32.940 
to the layers panel here and I'll just
show<00:05:31.040> the<00:05:31.220> before<00:05:31.550> and<00:05:31.640> after<00:05:32.030> we<00:05:32.240> can<00:05:32.390> see

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:32.950 
show the before and after we can see

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:35.620 
show the before and after we can see
obviously<00:05:33.950> that's<00:05:34.160> way<00:05:34.700> too<00:05:34.730> far<00:05:35.300> but<00:05:35.450> just

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:35.630 
obviously that's way too far but just

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:37.150 
obviously that's way too far but just
gives<00:05:35.780> you<00:05:35.870> an<00:05:35.960> idea<00:05:36.050> of<00:05:36.500> what<00:05:36.680> we<00:05:36.770> can<00:05:36.919> do

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:37.160 
gives you an idea of what we can do

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:39.520 
gives you an idea of what we can do
there<00:05:37.400> just<00:05:37.669> by<00:05:37.790> quick<00:05:38.120> clicking<00:05:38.840> on<00:05:38.960> action

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:39.530 
there just by quick clicking on action

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:41.800 
there just by quick clicking on action
which<00:05:39.650> we<00:05:39.830> created<00:05:40.220> earlier<00:05:40.430> and<00:05:40.850> obviously

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:41.810 
which we created earlier and obviously

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:42.909 
which we created earlier and obviously
when<00:05:41.900> we<00:05:41.990> do<00:05:42.140> this<00:05:42.320> we're<00:05:42.440> going<00:05:42.530> to<00:05:42.590> get<00:05:42.710> quite

00:05:42.909 --> 00:05:42.919 
when we do this we're going to get quite

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:45.340 
when we do this we're going to get quite
a<00:05:42.950> few<00:05:43.040> layers<00:05:43.690> building<00:05:44.690> up<00:05:44.840> so<00:05:44.990> all<00:05:45.080> I<00:05:45.110> would

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:45.350 
a few layers building up so all I would

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:47.010 
a few layers building up so all I would
do<00:05:45.470> then<00:05:45.680> is<00:05:45.710> I<00:05:45.890> just<00:05:46.100> click<00:05:46.520> on<00:05:46.610> the<00:05:46.669> top<00:05:46.880> one

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:47.020 
do then is I just click on the top one

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:49.420 
do then is I just click on the top one
shift-click<00:05:48.020> on<00:05:48.110> the<00:05:48.169> bottom<00:05:48.620> one<00:05:48.770> and<00:05:48.979> then

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:49.430 
shift-click on the bottom one and then

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:51.520 
shift-click on the bottom one and then
just<00:05:49.610> put<00:05:49.790> new<00:05:50.120> group<00:05:50.419> from<00:05:50.600> layers<00:05:50.690> and<00:05:51.410> I'd

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:51.530 
just put new group from layers and I'd

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:54.310 
just put new group from layers and I'd
call<00:05:51.800> that<00:05:51.970> shadows<00:05:52.970> and<00:05:53.750> we<00:05:53.840> can<00:05:53.990> then<00:05:54.110> do

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:54.320 
call that shadows and we can then do

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:55.990 
call that shadows and we can then do
that<00:05:54.500> for<00:05:54.650> the<00:05:54.710> highlights<00:05:55.070> as<00:05:55.250> well<00:05:55.460> so<00:05:55.790> if<00:05:55.910> I

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:56.000 
that for the highlights as well so if I

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.540 
that for the highlights as well so if I
then<00:05:56.240> go<00:05:56.479> to<00:05:56.540> highlights<00:05:57.200> click<00:05:58.010> play<00:05:58.280> just

00:05:58.540 --> 00:05:58.550 
then go to highlights click play just

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:02.290 
then go to highlights click play just
the<00:05:58.610> ones<00:05:58.880> and<00:05:59.229> just<00:06:00.229> one<00:06:00.470> more<00:06:00.650> time<00:06:01.120> so<00:06:02.120> then

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:02.300 
the ones and just one more time so then

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:04.810 
the ones and just one more time so then
now<00:06:02.510> we<00:06:02.540> can<00:06:02.870> then<00:06:03.050> just<00:06:03.350> put<00:06:03.590> those<00:06:03.830> into<00:06:04.310> the

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:04.820 
now we can then just put those into the

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:08.050 
now we can then just put those into the
layer<00:06:05.210> new<00:06:05.750> and<00:06:06.140> we'll<00:06:06.830> go<00:06:06.950> to<00:06:07.010> new<00:06:07.669> group<00:06:07.940> from

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:08.060 
layer new and we'll go to new group from

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:11.320 
layer new and we'll go to new group from
layers<00:06:08.229> and<00:06:09.229> we'll<00:06:09.380> call<00:06:09.530> that<00:06:09.940> high<00:06:10.940> in<00:06:11.240> the

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:11.330 
layers and we'll call that high in the

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:14.710 
layers and we'll call that high in the
lights<00:06:11.570> spelled<00:06:12.470> correctly<00:06:12.620> that<00:06:12.919> time<00:06:13.330> so<00:06:14.330> no

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:14.720 
lights spelled correctly that time so no

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:16.390 
lights spelled correctly that time so no
done<00:06:14.990> that<00:06:15.110> wrong<00:06:15.290> let's<00:06:15.800> just<00:06:16.010> come<00:06:16.160> out<00:06:16.280> of

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:16.400 
done that wrong let's just come out of

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:18.760 
done that wrong let's just come out of
there<00:06:16.550> click<00:06:17.450> on<00:06:17.570> one<00:06:17.720> fat<00:06:17.900> one<00:06:18.080> shift-click

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:18.770 
there click on one fat one shift-click

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:20.560 
there click on one fat one shift-click
on<00:06:18.860> the<00:06:18.919> second<00:06:19.340> one<00:06:19.430> and<00:06:19.669> then<00:06:20.000> we'll<00:06:20.180> go<00:06:20.360> and

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:20.570 
on the second one and then we'll go and

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:22.000 
on the second one and then we'll go and
new<00:06:20.690> group<00:06:20.870> from<00:06:20.960> layers<00:06:21.050> and<00:06:21.620> we'll<00:06:21.800> call

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:22.010 
new group from layers and we'll call

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:25.900 
new group from layers and we'll call
that<00:06:22.930> highlights<00:06:24.100> so<00:06:25.100> they<00:06:25.220> go<00:06:25.400> there's<00:06:25.640> two

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:25.910 
that highlights so they go there's two

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:27.430 
that highlights so they go there's two
actions<00:06:26.419> created<00:06:26.750> one<00:06:27.020> for<00:06:27.050> boosting<00:06:27.380> the

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:27.440 
actions created one for boosting the

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:29.260 
actions created one for boosting the
highlights<00:06:27.830> want<00:06:28.400> for<00:06:28.580> boosting<00:06:28.790> the<00:06:28.850> shadows

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:29.270 
highlights want for boosting the shadows

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:30.820 
highlights want for boosting the shadows
but<00:06:29.450> the<00:06:29.600> main<00:06:29.870> thing<00:06:30.169> is<00:06:30.320> that<00:06:30.440> when<00:06:30.560> we<00:06:30.650> do

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:30.830 
but the main thing is that when we do

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:33.670 
but the main thing is that when we do
that<00:06:31.100> it's<00:06:31.370> nice<00:06:31.910> and<00:06:32.210> quick<00:06:32.540> but<00:06:33.200> the<00:06:33.350> color

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:33.680 
that it's nice and quick but the color

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:35.740 
that it's nice and quick but the color
isn't<00:06:34.100> being<00:06:34.220> affected<00:06:34.669> at<00:06:34.790> all<00:06:34.940> so<00:06:35.570> there<00:06:35.690> we

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:35.750 
isn't being affected at all so there we

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:35.920 
isn't being affected at all so there we
go

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:35.930 
go

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:37.900 
go
that's<00:06:36.200> it<00:06:36.380> for<00:06:36.500> now<00:06:36.620> I<00:06:36.830> shall<00:06:36.860> catch<00:06:37.430> you<00:06:37.700> next
