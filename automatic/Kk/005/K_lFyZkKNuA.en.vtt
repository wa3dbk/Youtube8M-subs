00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:36.990 

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:40.160 

I<00:00:38.030> don't<00:00:39.030> love<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.240> cutout<00:00:39.510> only<00:00:39.750> because<00:00:40.050> it

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
I don't love the cutout only because it

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.930 
I don't love the cutout only because it
was<00:00:40.260> overloaded<00:00:40.680> or<00:00:40.950> what<00:00:41.160> but<00:00:41.400> I<00:00:41.430> have<00:00:41.730> heard

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
was overloaded or what but I have heard

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.540 
was overloaded or what but I have heard
these<00:00:42.210> batteries<00:00:42.720> of<00:00:43.070> giving<00:00:44.070> some<00:00:44.280> people

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
these batteries of giving some people

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.060 
these batteries of giving some people
issue<00:00:45.110> if<00:00:46.110> you<00:00:46.230> guys<00:00:46.410> said<00:00:46.650> they're<00:00:46.800> cutting

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
issue if you guys said they're cutting

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.350 
issue if you guys said they're cutting
out<00:00:47.190> and<00:00:47.280> they<00:00:47.340> had<00:00:47.490> and<00:00:47.610> pull<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:47.820> battery<00:00:48.180> to

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
out and they had and pull the battery to

00:00:48.360 --> 00:01:01.850 
out and they had and pull the battery to
get<00:00:48.510> it<00:00:48.600> to<00:00:48.690> run<00:00:48.840> again

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:01.860 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:04.970 

I<00:01:02.870> want<00:01:03.870> to<00:01:03.960> cut<00:01:04.050> up<00:01:04.170> before<00:01:04.470> that<00:01:04.620> definitely

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:04.980 
I want to cut up before that definitely

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:06.260 
I want to cut up before that definitely
wasn't<00:01:05.129> overload<00:01:05.610> because<00:01:05.940> that's<00:01:06.090> what<00:01:06.180> I

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
wasn't overload because that's what I

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:22.020 
wasn't overload because that's what I
tried<00:01:06.480> to<00:01:06.570> do<00:01:06.720> there

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.030 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.330 

well<00:01:23.030> cuts<00:01:23.240> really<00:01:23.420> good<00:01:23.660> I<00:01:23.930> would<00:01:24.830> say<00:01:25.130> it's

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
well cuts really good I would say it's

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.730 
well cuts really good I would say it's
very<00:01:25.840> probably<00:01:26.840> pretty<00:01:27.080> darn<00:01:27.290> close<00:01:27.470> to<00:01:27.530> the

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
very probably pretty darn close to the

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:34.150 
very probably pretty darn close to the
421<00:01:28.370> let's<00:01:28.550> give<00:01:28.730> that<00:01:28.880> a<00:01:28.910> try<00:01:29.180> here<00:01:33.160> you'll

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:34.160 
421 let's give that a try here you'll

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.010 
421 let's give that a try here you'll
have<00:01:34.280> a<00:01:34.370> whole<00:01:34.520> lot<00:01:34.670> of<00:01:34.700> wood<00:01:34.970> left<00:01:35.630> to<00:01:35.870> make

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
have a whole lot of wood left to make

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:40.990 
have a whole lot of wood left to make
many<00:01:36.980> cuts<00:01:37.310> we<00:01:37.820> got<00:01:38.710> one<00:01:39.710> maybe<00:01:40.040> two<00:01:40.400> cuts<00:01:40.729> left

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
many cuts we got one maybe two cuts left

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:53.710 
many cuts we got one maybe two cuts left
on<00:01:41.240> that<00:01:51.160> that's<00:01:52.160> how<00:01:52.340> a<00:01:52.370> properly<00:01:53.119> tuned<00:01:53.450> soul

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:53.720 
on that that's how a properly tuned soul

00:01:53.720 --> 00:02:56.370 
on that that's how a properly tuned soul
should<00:01:54.320> start<00:01:54.680> by<00:01:54.890> the<00:01:54.950> way

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:01.930 

it's<00:02:57.380> a<00:02:57.440> piece<00:02:57.620> of<00:02:57.650> crap<00:02:57.860> I<00:03:00.520> think<00:03:01.520> I<00:03:01.610> have<00:03:01.760> to

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
it's a piece of crap I think I have to

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:04.020 
it's a piece of crap I think I have to
let<00:03:02.209> it<00:03:02.239> sit<00:03:02.330> for<00:03:02.510> a<00:03:02.690> second<00:03:03.020> let<00:03:03.140> it<00:03:03.230> reset

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
let it sit for a second let it reset

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.220 
let it sit for a second let it reset
processors<00:03:05.030> probably<00:03:05.630> getting<00:03:05.870> confused

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
processors probably getting confused

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:09.850 
processors probably getting confused
that's<00:03:06.380> my<00:03:07.989> understanding<00:03:08.989> of<00:03:09.470> how<00:03:09.620> that

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:09.860 
that's my understanding of how that

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:25.340 
that's my understanding of how that
usually<00:03:10.250> works

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:27.200 

powers<00:03:25.980> are<00:03:26.160> still<00:03:26.400> right<00:03:26.730> there<00:03:26.760> for<00:03:27.090> no

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:27.210 
powers are still right there for no

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:39.210 
powers are still right there for no
apparent<00:03:27.330> reason

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.580 

I'll<00:03:40.090> tell<00:03:40.360> you<00:03:40.420> this<00:03:40.600> that<00:03:41.110> is<00:03:41.260> about<00:03:41.440> the

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
I'll tell you this that is about the

00:03:41.590 --> 00:04:47.180 
I'll tell you this that is about the
flimsiest<00:03:42.010> bar<00:03:42.310> I've<00:03:42.460> ever<00:03:42.610> seen<00:03:42.940> by<00:03:43.300> the<00:03:43.360> way

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.190 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:49.320 

to<00:04:48.190> do<00:04:48.340> it<00:04:48.430> after<00:04:48.640> I<00:04:48.700> let<00:04:48.850> it<00:04:48.940> sit<00:04:49.090> for<00:04:49.120> a<00:04:49.300> few

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:49.330 
to do it after I let it sit for a few

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:57.450 
to do it after I let it sit for a few
seconds<00:04:49.870> here<00:04:55.140> let's<00:04:56.140> try<00:04:56.350> the<00:04:56.470> gas<00:04:56.920> one<00:04:57.190> again

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:57.460 
seconds here let's try the gas one again

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:57.890 
seconds here let's try the gas one again
and<00:04:57.730> see<00:04:57.940> how<00:04:57.970> that<00:04:58.150> works

00:05:57.890 --> 00:05:57.900 

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:00.210 

obviously<00:05:58.900> this<00:05:59.050> isn't<00:05:59.410> a<00:05:59.530> direct<00:05:59.830> comparison

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:00.220 
obviously this isn't a direct comparison

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:04.650 
obviously this isn't a direct comparison
in<00:06:00.520> power<00:06:02.760> gasps<00:06:03.760> oh<00:06:03.940> it's<00:06:03.970> definitely<00:06:04.240> yeah

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:04.660 
in power gasps oh it's definitely yeah

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:07.440 
in power gasps oh it's definitely yeah
quicker<00:06:05.340> and<00:06:06.340> like<00:06:06.640> I<00:06:06.760> said<00:06:07.030> I<00:06:07.060> really<00:06:07.180> don't

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:07.450 
quicker and like I said I really don't

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:08.940 
quicker and like I said I really don't
understand<00:06:07.990> people<00:06:08.230> complain<00:06:08.650> about<00:06:08.680> the

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:08.950 
understand people complain about the

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:11.850 
understand people complain about the
chainsaw<00:06:09.960> being<00:06:10.960> hard<00:06:11.140> to<00:06:11.200> start<00:06:11.500> it<00:06:11.620> should

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:11.860 
chainsaw being hard to start it should

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:13.620 
chainsaw being hard to start it should
be<00:06:12.040> it<00:06:12.700> is<00:06:12.820> there's<00:06:13.030> something<00:06:13.210> wrong<00:06:13.420> with<00:06:13.570> it
