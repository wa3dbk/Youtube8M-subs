00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.230
 'no metal with metal and here we have 

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:10.680
 this here that is not scratched that is 

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:10.680
 in good state 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:14.910
 do not 

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:20.670
 some last considerations when 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:24.210
 we replace the piece or when it is sent 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:27.660
 to repair in this case we have the 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:32.840
 sample of the piece the stump as 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:36.380
 It was previously shown as damaged 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:38.840
 the piece the metals and the rod are 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:40.850
 damaged in this case kawasaki recommends 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:44.360
 that when the piece is damaged from this 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:47.170
 way to replace the crankshaft not 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.170
 rectify 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.570
 this is the manufacturer's recommendation 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.510
 TomÃ¡s Aquino used to repair this 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.649
 type of pieces when they suffer this type 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.170
 Of Damage 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:08.830
 in this case union precisely 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:13.070
 there would be no need to measure it because 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:15.730
 it is visible that this piece is damaged 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:18.010
 in this case 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:21.780
 then no 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:24.630
 it is repaired but it is replaced 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:28.760
 and the damage is considered visible when not 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.760
 is very affected and you can simply 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:35.850
 the part where the metal works 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:39.060
 and that there is no damage like in this case 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:42.140
 if in that case you can use the same 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.280
 piece but here we see visually 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.380
 specifically visually that the piece 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.869
 It is very damaged 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.789
 and we also see the deformation of the 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:54.140
 metals 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:57.140
 then we define that we have to 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.140
 replace it 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:05.799
 we repeat in this case the recommendation 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:07.810
 is to replace the piece without needing 

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:10.959
 measure because visually we can 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:14.019
 check the damage verify the damage is not 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:16.709
 a superficial damage but that is more than 

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:16.709
 superficial
