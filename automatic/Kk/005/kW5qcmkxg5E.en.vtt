to<00:03:34.110> this<00:03:34.440> is<00:03:34.500> you<00:03:35.040> have<00:03:35.280> to<00:03:35.489> get<00:03:35.640> all<00:03:35.880> of<00:03:36.090> the

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
to this is you have to get all of the

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:38.900 
to this is you have to get all of the
moisture<00:03:36.390> out<00:03:36.630> whatever<00:03:37.610> moisture<00:03:38.610> is<00:03:38.670> left

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
moisture out whatever moisture is left

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.360 
moisture out whatever moisture is left
in<00:03:39.060> there<00:03:39.239> is<00:03:39.360> going<00:03:39.690> to<00:03:39.900> swell<00:03:40.739> the<00:03:40.770> hair<00:03:41.099> once

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
in there is going to swell the hair once

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:45.650 
in there is going to swell the hair once
it<00:03:41.580> is<00:03:42.230> drawn<00:03:43.230> to<00:03:43.590> the<00:03:44.010> humidity<00:03:44.819> outside<00:03:45.030> so

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
it is drawn to the humidity outside so

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.370 
it is drawn to the humidity outside so
you<00:03:46.620> do<00:03:46.739> have<00:03:46.920> to<00:03:47.069> pay<00:03:47.340> fine<00:03:47.610> attention<00:03:48.120> to

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:48.380 
you do have to pay fine attention to

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:53.180 
you do have to pay fine attention to
getting<00:03:49.380> into<00:03:50.120> the<00:03:51.120> you<00:03:51.989> know<00:03:52.140> the<00:03:52.650> bushy<00:03:52.890> area

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
getting into the you know the bushy area

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:57.500 
getting into the you know the bushy area
and<00:03:53.670> getting<00:03:53.700> all<00:03:54.420> the<00:03:54.630> moisture<00:03:54.930> out

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.330 

well<00:03:57.930> three<00:03:58.170> things<00:03:58.409> actually<00:03:58.620> this<00:03:59.189> is

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
well three things actually this is

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:00.679 
well three things actually this is
stretching<00:03:59.790> my<00:03:59.939> hair<00:04:00.120> getting<00:04:00.360> rid<00:04:00.540> of<00:04:00.569> the

00:04:00.679 --> 00:04:00.689 
stretching my hair getting rid of the

00:04:00.689 --> 00:04:04.880 
stretching my hair getting rid of the
extra<00:04:00.989> moisture<00:04:01.260> and<00:04:02.870> laying<00:04:03.870> it<00:04:04.049> down<00:04:04.110> laying

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890 
extra moisture and laying it down laying

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:07.729 
extra moisture and laying it down laying
it<00:04:05.069> down<00:04:05.099> otherwise<00:04:05.849> my<00:04:06.299> hair<00:04:06.540> would<00:04:06.780> stay<00:04:07.079> you

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:07.739 
it down otherwise my hair would stay you

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:11.050 
it down otherwise my hair would stay you
know<00:04:07.860> fuller<00:04:08.189> and<00:04:08.489> that's<00:04:08.640> a<00:04:08.790> different<00:04:09.150> look

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:11.060 
know fuller and that's a different look

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:13.780 
know fuller and that's a different look
but<00:04:11.540> I<00:04:11.569> did<00:04:11.840> kind<00:04:12.050> of<00:04:12.170> want<00:04:12.380> some<00:04:12.650> some<00:04:13.459> length

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:13.790 
but I did kind of want some some length

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:16.720 
but I did kind of want some some length
and<00:04:14.090> for<00:04:14.540> it<00:04:14.630> to<00:04:14.660> lay<00:04:14.900> down<00:04:14.930> this<00:04:15.380> morning<00:04:15.730> and

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:16.730 
and for it to lay down this morning and

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:19.240 
and for it to lay down this morning and
because<00:04:17.120> it<00:04:17.299> doesn't<00:04:17.570> take<00:04:17.720> me<00:04:17.870> much<00:04:18.019> time<00:04:18.350> I'm

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:19.250 
because it doesn't take me much time I'm

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:20.920 
because it doesn't take me much time I'm
going<00:04:19.400> to<00:04:19.459> do<00:04:19.579> this<00:04:19.730> so<00:04:20.269> I'll<00:04:20.389> be<00:04:20.540> back<00:04:20.720> with

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.030 
once I took down the Platts and that was

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:31.000 
once I took down the Platts and that was
that<00:04:29.300> was<00:04:29.419> whacked<00:04:29.720> out<00:04:29.990> because<00:04:30.500> it<00:04:30.830> was<00:04:30.980> a

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:31.010 
that was whacked out because it was a

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:32.950 
that was whacked out because it was a
bunch<00:04:31.310> of<00:04:31.430> fruit<00:04:31.700> and<00:04:32.450> what<00:04:32.630> I<00:04:32.660> love<00:04:32.900> about

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:32.960 
bunch of fruit and what I love about

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:37.690 
bunch of fruit and what I love about
doing<00:04:33.590> this<00:04:33.770> is<00:04:34.070> that<00:04:34.520> I<00:04:34.850> do<00:04:35.360> not<00:04:36.310> touch<00:04:37.310> the

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:37.700 
doing this is that I do not touch the

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:41.909 
doing this is that I do not touch the
ends<00:04:38.120> of<00:04:38.240> my<00:04:38.270> hair<00:04:38.480> just<00:04:40.120> definitely

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:41.919 
ends of my hair just definitely

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:44.110 
ends of my hair just definitely
something<00:04:42.919> that<00:04:42.950> I<00:04:43.100> do<00:04:43.220> not<00:04:43.580> like<00:04:43.790> putting

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:44.120 
something that I do not like putting

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:45.610 
something that I do not like putting
heat<00:04:44.300> on<00:04:44.330> so<00:04:44.720> I<00:04:44.750> like<00:04:44.990> that<00:04:45.139> I<00:04:45.200> don't<00:04:45.320> have<00:04:45.470> to

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:45.620 
heat on so I like that I don't have to

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:47.290 
heat on so I like that I don't have to
do<00:04:45.800> that<00:04:45.830> I'm<00:04:46.370> really<00:04:46.610> just<00:04:46.760> stretching<00:04:46.850> up

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:47.300 
do that I'm really just stretching up

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:51.969 
do that I'm really just stretching up
here<00:04:47.600> and<00:04:48.910> it<00:04:49.910> gets<00:04:50.060> the<00:04:50.240> job<00:04:50.270> done<00:04:50.510> as<00:04:51.410> far<00:04:51.740> as

00:04:51.969 --> 00:04:51.979 
here and it gets the job done as far as

00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:53.590 
here and it gets the job done as far as
filling<00:04:52.430> it<00:04:52.520> out<00:04:52.610> and<00:04:52.880> getting<00:04:53.210> some<00:04:53.389> length

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:53.600 
filling it out and getting some length

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.060 
filling it out and getting some length
and<00:04:53.870> this<00:04:53.990> sets<00:04:54.200> the<00:04:54.350> pace<00:04:54.560> for<00:04:54.620> the<00:04:54.919> week

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:55.070 
and this sets the pace for the week

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:58.600 
and this sets the pace for the week
because<00:04:55.460> that<00:04:56.090> eliminates<00:04:56.570> day<00:04:56.810> one<00:04:57.050> of<00:04:57.610> you

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:58.610 
because that eliminates day one of you

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:00.070 
because that eliminates day one of you
know<00:04:58.729> having<00:04:58.910> to<00:04:59.090> stretch<00:04:59.389> if<00:04:59.600> that's<00:04:59.840> the

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.080 
know having to stretch if that's the

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:01.360 
know having to stretch if that's the
look<00:05:00.110> that<00:05:00.260> you're<00:05:00.440> going<00:05:00.650> for<00:05:00.919> for<00:05:01.160> the<00:05:01.220> week

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:01.370 
look that you're going for for the week

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:11.159 
look that you're going for for the week
i<00:05:01.630> love<00:05:02.630> that<00:05:02.780> i<00:05:02.840> do<00:05:02.960> it<00:05:03.169> on<00:05:03.320> warm

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:11.169 

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:15.449 

I<00:05:11.379> keep<00:05:12.310> that<00:05:12.490> on<00:05:12.610> my<00:05:12.729> hand<00:05:12.969> all<00:05:13.090> morning
