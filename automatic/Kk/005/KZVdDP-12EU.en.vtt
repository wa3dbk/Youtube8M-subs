the<00:01:58.680> problem<00:01:59.070> with<00:01:59.100> it<00:01:59.340> is<00:01:59.369> it<00:01:59.579> can<00:01:59.759> put<00:01:59.909> things

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
the problem with it is it can put things

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.910 
the problem with it is it can put things
to<00:02:00.210> sleep<00:02:00.420> I<00:02:00.509> guess<00:02:00.659> dragonite<00:02:01.140> one<00:02:01.619> of<00:02:01.740> them

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
to sleep I guess dragonite one of them

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.709 
to sleep I guess dragonite one of them
dragonite<00:02:02.640> was<00:02:02.790> really<00:02:03.149> good<00:02:03.299> but<00:02:03.479> and<00:02:03.630> then

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
dragonite was really good but and then

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.359 
dragonite was really good but and then
it<00:02:03.810> goes<00:02:03.930> to<00:02:03.990> sleep<00:02:04.290> and<00:02:04.500> then<00:02:04.560> your<00:02:05.070> opponent

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
it goes to sleep and then your opponent

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:06.630 
it goes to sleep and then your opponent
gets<00:02:05.460> advantage

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
gets advantage

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.669 
gets advantage
it's<00:02:06.820> well<00:02:07.600> you<00:02:08.080> know<00:02:08.200> there<00:02:08.410> are<00:02:08.470> ways<00:02:08.649> to

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:08.679 
it's well you know there are ways to

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:10.200 
it's well you know there are ways to
deal<00:02:08.950> with<00:02:09.100> really<00:02:09.310> it<00:02:09.490> just<00:02:09.520> means<00:02:09.819> that<00:02:09.970> that

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:10.210 
deal with really it just means that that

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:11.670 
deal with really it just means that that
things<00:02:10.479> a<00:02:10.600> lot<00:02:10.720> easier<00:02:10.750> to<00:02:10.990> deal<00:02:11.200> with<00:02:11.230> how<00:02:11.560> is

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
things a lot easier to deal with how is

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.670 
things a lot easier to deal with how is
it<00:02:11.830> means<00:02:12.040> like<00:02:12.220> you're<00:02:12.940> no<00:02:13.150> longer<00:02:13.680> worrying

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
about carrying a dedicated sleep fodder

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.580 
about carrying a dedicated sleep fodder

those kind of things it's your go-to
pokemon<00:02:27.160> for<00:02:27.580> a<00:02:27.610> lot<00:02:28.030> of<00:02:28.180> stages<00:02:28.720> effects<00:02:29.020> and

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:29.320 
pokemon for a lot of stages effects and

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:32.040 
pokemon for a lot of stages effects and
sleep<00:02:30.070> most<00:02:30.370> of<00:02:30.520> all<00:02:30.670> because<00:02:30.820> poor<00:02:31.150> is<00:02:31.270> such<00:02:32.020> a

sleep most of all because poor is such a

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:34.260 
sleep most of all because poor is such a
pain<00:02:32.230> in<00:02:32.380> the<00:02:32.410> ass<00:02:32.560> to<00:02:32.590> deal<00:02:32.860> with<00:02:33.100> I<00:02:33.310> think

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:34.270 
pain in the ass to deal with I think

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:38.010 
pain in the ass to deal with I think
they've<00:02:35.190> they<00:02:36.190> balance<00:02:36.910> their<00:02:37.120> balancing<00:02:37.840> out

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:38.020 
they've they balance their balancing out

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:41.130 
they've they balance their balancing out
the<00:02:38.050> game<00:02:38.470> in<00:02:38.920> six<00:02:39.730> gem<00:02:40.000> and<00:02:40.270> they're<00:02:40.810> making

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
the game in six gem and they're making

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:43.290 
the game in six gem and they're making
every<00:02:41.650> type<00:02:41.920> have<00:02:42.250> its<00:02:42.400> own<00:02:42.610> advantages<00:02:42.880> and

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.300 
every type have its own advantages and

every type have its own advantages and
disadvantages<00:02:44.080> I<00:02:45.180> but<00:02:46.180> they're<00:02:46.330> more<00:02:46.600> they're

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
disadvantages I but they're more they're

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:51.050 
disadvantages I but they're more they're
more<00:02:47.290> relevant<00:02:47.800> so<00:02:48.630> it's<00:02:49.630> not<00:02:49.810> like<00:02:50.080> a

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
more relevant so it's not like a

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.009 
more relevant so it's not like a
poison-type<00:02:52.060> we're<00:02:52.330> pleased<00:02:52.510> that<00:02:52.540> was<00:02:52.870> just

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:53.019 
poison-type we're pleased that was just

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:55.110 
poison-type we're pleased that was just
completely<00:02:53.410> who<00:02:54.400> cares<00:02:54.640> about<00:02:54.790> it<00:02:55.000> cuz

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
completely who cares about it cuz

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.290 
completely who cares about it cuz
everything<00:02:55.390> learns<00:02:55.630> toxic<00:02:56.110> anyway<00:02:56.500> yeah<00:02:57.300> but

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:58.300 
everything learns toxic anyway yeah but

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:59.460 
everything learns toxic anyway yeah but
now<00:02:58.450> everything's<00:02:58.870> getting<00:02:59.140> like<00:02:59.260> a<00:02:59.290> nice

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
now everything's getting like a nice

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.920 
now everything's getting like a nice
balance<00:02:59.739> it<00:03:00.250> seems<00:03:00.550> i<00:03:00.880> think<00:03:01.360> the<00:03:01.510> nice<00:03:01.690> thing

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
balance it seems i think the nice thing

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:03.990 
balance it seems i think the nice thing
about<00:03:01.989> these<00:03:02.350> changes<00:03:02.950> are<00:03:03.100> the<00:03:03.310> is<00:03:03.550> that<00:03:03.880> they

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
about these changes are the is that they

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.199 
about these changes are the is that they
are<00:03:04.030> logical<00:03:04.780> and<00:03:05.370> I'm<00:03:06.370> kind<00:03:06.790> of<00:03:06.880> surprised

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:07.209 
are logical and I'm kind of surprised

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:08.430 
are logical and I'm kind of surprised
that<00:03:07.390> they<00:03:07.480> weren't<00:03:07.720> there<00:03:07.930> in<00:03:08.080> the<00:03:08.170> first

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440 
that they weren't there in the first

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.770 
that they weren't there in the first
place<00:03:08.590> you<00:03:08.769> know<00:03:09.160> like<00:03:09.430> electric-type<00:03:10.330> being

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
place you know like electric-type being

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.479 
place you know like electric-type being
able<00:03:11.049> to<00:03:11.170> be<00:03:11.260> paralyzed<00:03:11.799> is<00:03:12.010> something<00:03:12.370> that

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:12.489 
able to be paralyzed is something that

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:15.240 
able to be paralyzed is something that
shouldn't<00:03:12.910> have<00:03:13.090> been<00:03:13.120> a<00:03:13.480> thing<00:03:13.989> and<00:03:14.920> it's

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
shouldn't have been a thing and it's

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:16.949 
shouldn't have been a thing and it's
kind<00:03:15.489> of<00:03:15.549> like<00:03:15.730> they're<00:03:16.299> going<00:03:16.480> back<00:03:16.750> and

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 
kind of like they're going back and

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:18.390 
kind of like they're going back and
they're<00:03:17.079> reassessing<00:03:17.680> they're<00:03:17.799> like<00:03:17.980> oh<00:03:18.130> yeah

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
they're reassessing they're like oh yeah

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.460 
they're reassessing they're like oh yeah
that<00:03:18.670> actually<00:03:18.850> is<00:03:19.180> a<00:03:19.570> logical<00:03:20.049> thing<00:03:20.230> to<00:03:20.260> do

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
that actually is a logical thing to do

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.880 
that actually is a logical thing to do
let's<00:03:20.739> do<00:03:20.890> that<00:03:21.269> so<00:03:22.269> it's<00:03:22.870> cool<00:03:23.140> I<00:03:23.380> mean<00:03:23.709> it

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:23.890 
let's do that so it's cool I mean it

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:27.240 
let's do that so it's cool I mean it
does<00:03:24.070> kind<00:03:24.400> of<00:03:25.140> well<00:03:26.140> I<00:03:26.350> guess<00:03:26.799> you<00:03:26.950> know<00:03:27.040> T

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
does kind of well I guess you know T

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.340 
does kind of well I guess you know T
waves<00:03:27.459> going<00:03:27.640> to<00:03:27.730> be<00:03:27.910> going<00:03:28.750> down<00:03:28.930> a<00:03:28.989> little

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:29.350 
waves going to be going down a little

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:31.229 
waves going to be going down a little
bit<00:03:29.590> usage<00:03:30.070> because<00:03:30.250> now<00:03:30.579> you<00:03:30.640> got<00:03:30.700> two<00:03:31.000> types

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:31.239 
bit usage because now you got two types

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:33.600 
bit usage because now you got two types
that<00:03:31.450> are<00:03:31.480> immune<00:03:31.720> to<00:03:31.750> it<00:03:31.989> but<00:03:32.250> I<00:03:33.250> think<00:03:33.280> that's

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:33.610 
that are immune to it but I think that's

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:35.370 
that are immune to it but I think that's
a<00:03:33.730> good<00:03:34.150> thing<00:03:34.209> what<00:03:34.720> were<00:03:34.930> your<00:03:35.079> thoughts<00:03:35.110> on

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:35.380 
a good thing what were your thoughts on

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:38.610 
a good thing what were your thoughts on
electric<00:03:35.860> types<00:03:36.310> not<00:03:36.790> being<00:03:37.030> paralyzed<00:03:37.450> I<00:03:37.720> was

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.620 
electric types not being paralyzed I was

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.319 
electric types not being paralyzed I was
one<00:03:38.799> of<00:03:38.920> the<00:03:39.070> ones<00:03:39.190> that<00:03:39.370> was<00:03:39.610> crying<00:03:40.030> about<00:03:40.150> it

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:40.329 
one of the ones that was crying about it

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:43.800 
one of the ones that was crying about it
for<00:03:40.660> like<00:03:40.690> a<00:03:41.140> couple<00:03:41.980> years<00:03:42.549> well<00:03:43.239> not<00:03:43.450> for<00:03:43.780> a

think it comes to mind but from a

00:06:56.389 --> 00:06:58.839

logical<00:06:56.599> perspective<00:06:57.050> block<00:06:57.620> your<00:06:58.189> block

00:06:58.839 --> 00:06:58.849 
logical perspective block your block

00:06:58.849 --> 00:07:01.839 
logical perspective block your block
yeah<00:06:59.240> duh<00:06:59.539> um<00:07:00.439> did<00:07:01.159> you<00:07:01.370> think<00:07:01.550> this<00:07:01.669> watch

from<00:07:02.029> a<00:07:02.120> logical<00:07:02.300> perspective<00:07:02.719> in<00:07:03.229> terms<00:07:03.289> of

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:03.560 
from a logical perspective in terms of

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:05.769 
from a logical perspective in terms of
ghost<00:07:03.830> pokemon<00:07:04.039> being<00:07:04.520> able<00:07:04.759> to<00:07:04.939> get<00:07:05.629> all

00:07:05.769 --> 00:07:05.779 
ghost pokemon being able to get all

00:07:05.779 --> 00:07:08.860 
ghost pokemon being able to get all
definitely<00:07:06.289> present<00:07:07.180> it<00:07:08.180> does<00:07:08.419> kind<00:07:08.539> of<00:07:08.750> make

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:08.870 
definitely present it does kind of make

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:10.869 
definitely present it does kind of make
sense<00:07:08.930> because<00:07:09.379> mean<00:07:09.590> look<00:07:09.860> is<00:07:10.069> like<00:07:10.520> oh<00:07:10.729> it

00:07:10.869 --> 00:07:10.879 
sense because mean look is like oh it

00:07:10.879 --> 00:07:13.330 
sense because mean look is like oh it
kind<00:07:11.090> of<00:07:11.150> paralyzes<00:07:11.960> you<00:07:12.080> in<00:07:12.169> fear<00:07:12.439> but<00:07:12.710> why<00:07:12.979> it

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:13.340 
kind of paralyzes you in fear but why it

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:14.679 
kind of paralyzes you in fear but why it
goes<00:07:13.520> afraid<00:07:13.909> of<00:07:14.029> anything<00:07:14.210> they're<00:07:14.509> already

00:07:14.679 --> 00:07:14.689 
goes afraid of anything they're already

00:07:14.689 --> 00:07:19.209 
goes afraid of anything they're already
 dead<00:07:15.080> so<00:07:15.639> exactly<00:07:16.639> like<00:07:17.120> dead<00:07:18.069> if<00:07:19.069> you

00:07:19.209 --> 00:07:19.219 
 dead so exactly like dead if you

00:07:19.219 --> 00:07:20.920 
 dead so exactly like dead if you
call<00:07:19.400> fair<00:07:20.000> death<00:07:20.240> then<00:07:20.479> you<00:07:20.509> really<00:07:20.840> don't
