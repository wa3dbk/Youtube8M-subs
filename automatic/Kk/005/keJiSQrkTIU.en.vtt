 in the miners Ridder forged gold reserves 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:15.700
 republics in order to mine and 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:17.650
 recycle one of the most valuable items 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:19.000
 periodic tables work tirelessly 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:21.010
 thousands of people laborious process 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.349
 starts in deep mines and 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:25.570
 completed in the smelters of plants 

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:27.430
 to understand how from deposits 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:29.680
 polymetallic ores containing in 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:31.540
 mostly zinc and copper and lead get 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.610
 Gold of the highest standard our film crew 

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:35.110
 the group visited all stages 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.860
 production from mining 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:37.860
 before processing 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.180
 President of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev 

00:00:43.109 --> 00:00:46.800
 put in front of the metallurgists side 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.899
 task in the shortest time to increase 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.750
 gold mining and production in the country before 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.730
 70 tons per year East Kazakhstan 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.859
 areas the idea of ​​the president was supported 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.870
 labor achievements of production 

00:00:55.859 --> 00:01:00.089
 precious metal grows and technology 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.949
 its mining is constantly being improved 

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:03.149
 gold in the region is mined from 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.009
 complex ores 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.289
 several mines in one only Rid 

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:09.240
 Take them 2 for example reader Sakulskomu 

00:01:07.289 --> 00:01:10.920
 the field is already two hundred twenty seven 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.590
 years total length of underground 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.420
 workings and transitions about 150 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.440
 kilometers this is approximately the distance from 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.690
 Ust-Kamenogorsk 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:21.030
 gives a hole this is not a big one 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:23.369
 1800 underground city 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.649
 a man about a hundred years ago in this 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.539
 mine found kilogram nuggets 

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:29.819
 but the deeper underground the density 

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:30.270
 gold is less at a depth of 400 meters where 

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:32.399
 now 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.380
 and even several are under development 

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:36.690
 grams per ton is considered good 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.929
 content according to geological 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:43.560
 According to the content in this lived 19 4 

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:47.369
 grams per ton of order we lived 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:51.200
 already 110 meters and according to geological 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:53.969
 wells we will still pass tee meters 80 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:56.729
 85 miner is one of the most difficult 

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:59.159
 occupations 6 hours underground will not survive 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.020
 every 1800 people work on it 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.939
 deposit all as on selection 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.619
 one big family allows it 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.579
 work with full dedication and mine 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.950
 more ore 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:10.709
 collective very friendly in themselves so 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.690
 more everything is divided by teams just 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:14.130
 pull brigades brigade then right including 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.010
 personal rather insults i mean they 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:18.989
 it is the crews that live this family emission 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.940
 the company cares raising 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:22.950
 labor productivity from year to year 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:26.310
 underground tunnels appear more and more 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.810
 self-propelled mining machinery in 2018 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.690
 the percentage of manual work is planned 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.700
 cut everything else down to 30 percent 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.260
 I will make cars last four years 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.209
 there is an introduction to the mines 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.160
 self-propelled vehicles self-propelled vehicles 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:40.049
 great facilitates the work of hands 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.700
 miners directly much 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:44.420
 safer it's all much more convenient 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.530
 Well, about us works several times higher 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.120
 daily surface raises 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.129
 thousand tons of ore in each piece 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.440
 the smallest impregnations of precious 

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:54.150
 metals after the ore mined it 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.790
 brought here to the processing plant 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.830
 it was here going through a few 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:01.170
 the hardest recycling cycles she 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:03.660
 turns into gold containing 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:06.239
 concentrate which is then taken to the factory 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:08.819
 and already there he becomes the present 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:10.769
 precious metals nose concentrate in 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:12.180
 First you need to get technological 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:14.670
 genius designed sophisticated machines 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.650
 thanks to which every year from ore 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.099
 an increasing percentage of gold is extracted and 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.410
 silver 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:21.269
 technologies have significantly advanced and 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:23.610
 now even goes to processing 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:26.160
 spent ore which is another 50 years 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:27.450
 ago it was considered waste to obtain 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.730
 concentrate ore carefully first 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:32.069
 crushed then mixed with water and 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.420
 crushed again turning almost into 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:35.849
 gelatinous mass 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.590
 it is enough for disclosure gold 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:40.079
 then gravity begins and 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:42.299
 flotation thickening and other processes 

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:43.739
 technical works in general factory 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:45.989
 produces about five and a half 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:47.880
 kilograms of precious metal per day 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:50.880
 it is very much but to the naked eye 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:54.049
 gold is not visible gold itself for latin 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:56.780
 only 10 microns by size therefore it 

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:59.430
 visually difficult to determine 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:02.160
 since they have enough weight 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.760
 close with lead then basically you 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.640
 have seen 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:07.470
 namely lead and put all the gold 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:09.239
 precisely in this lead band 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:10.470
 after getting it concentrate 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:12.209
 send the height of Kamenogorsk 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:13.950
 metallurgical complex passing through 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:16.169
 chemical physical treatment here 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:18.000
 get their own gold 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:19.620
 four nines of the highest standard 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.139
 weighing twelve and a half 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:23.880
 kilograms in each and are the results 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:26.400
 the hardest process in which 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:28.169
 thousands of people are involved one such 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:31.169
 a bar on the world market costs about 

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:34.220
 700,000 us dollars for workers it is 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:38.190
 simple metal when catchwords and 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:42.560
 minutes melt this trace can say 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:44.460
 yes then this is my job for me 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:46.889
 laminate metals all 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:48.990
 nevertheless get such an ingot in 

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:50.940
 everyone wants a personal collection about gold 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:53.220
 There are several legends in the smelter 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:55.620
 among the factory workers there 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:58.520
 a parable that everyone who can lift 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:00.870
 gold bar with two fingers like this 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:04.110
 can easily take him home 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:06.600
 however, for the 21 years of operation of the plant it is still 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:08.669
 nobody managed the exact figure how much 

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:11.099
 gold per day smelted at the factory not 

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:12.930
 no one will say this information is closed to 

00:05:11.099 --> 00:05:15.030
 sharing however the fact that 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:17.160
 recent production has been noticeable 

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:19.699
 increased yet known gold 

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:23.300
 the stock of our country more and more bars 

00:05:19.699 --> 00:05:23.300
 East Kazakhstan labeling
