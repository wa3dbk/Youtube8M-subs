00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
depending on the strength of the weapon

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.160 
depending on the strength of the weapon
that<00:00:41.430> you're<00:00:41.550> using<00:00:41.760> you<00:00:42.600> will<00:00:42.780> knock<00:00:43.020> him

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
that you're using you will knock him

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.840 
that you're using you will knock him
down<00:00:43.320> and<00:00:43.530> stun<00:00:43.739> him<00:00:43.920> like<00:00:44.100> I<00:00:44.190> did<00:00:44.370> right<00:00:44.820> there

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
down and stun him like I did right there

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.790 
down and stun him like I did right there
and<00:00:45.570> when<00:00:45.750> he's<00:00:45.840> down<00:00:45.989> like<00:00:46.140> that<00:00:46.260> you<00:00:46.320> can<00:00:46.680> get

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
and when he's down like that you can get

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.830 
and when he's down like that you can get
off<00:00:46.920> a<00:00:46.950> ton<00:00:47.309> of<00:00:47.340> hits<00:00:47.730> and<00:00:47.910> do<00:00:48.030> a<00:00:48.059> ton<00:00:48.390> of<00:00:48.420> damage

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
off a ton of hits and do a ton of damage

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.110 
off a ton of hits and do a ton of damage
that's<00:00:49.829> really<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:50.340> only<00:00:50.370> trick<00:00:50.910> to<00:00:51.030> this

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
that's really the only trick to this

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.970 
that's really the only trick to this
fight<00:00:51.329> he<00:00:51.510> does<00:00:51.660> move<00:00:51.840> around<00:00:52.140> pretty<00:00:52.530> quickly

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
fight he does move around pretty quickly

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.189 
fight he does move around pretty quickly
and<00:00:53.699> if<00:00:53.940> he<00:00:54.059> gets<00:00:54.239> pretty<00:00:54.449> far<00:00:54.690> away<00:00:54.809> from<00:00:54.899> you

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
and if he gets pretty far away from you

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.049 
and if he gets pretty far away from you
you<00:00:55.949> want<00:00:56.100> to<00:00:56.129> make<00:00:56.190> sure<00:00:56.430> that<00:00:56.579> you<00:00:56.699> are<00:00:56.850> all

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
it can get pretty brutal so you want to

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.710 
it can get pretty brutal so you want to
stay<00:01:11.430> underneath<00:01:11.640> him<00:01:11.850> keep<00:01:12.390> hitting<00:01:12.630> his

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
stay underneath him keep hitting his

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.359 
stay underneath him keep hitting his
legs<00:01:12.930> don't<00:01:13.200> lock<00:01:13.530> on<00:01:13.740> to<00:01:13.920> him<00:01:14.040> whatever<00:01:14.280> you

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
legs don't lock on to him whatever you

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.399 
legs don't lock on to him whatever you
do<00:01:14.520> because<00:01:14.760> that<00:01:14.790> defaults<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:15.869> lock<00:01:16.110> on<00:01:16.290> to

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
do because that defaults the lock on to

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:17.780 
do because that defaults the lock on to
the<00:01:16.500> center<00:01:16.740> of<00:01:16.950> his<00:01:16.979> body<00:01:17.250> which<00:01:17.549> is<00:01:17.640> not

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
the center of his body which is not

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.100 
the center of his body which is not
where<00:01:17.939> you<00:01:18.030> want<00:01:18.150> to<00:01:18.210> hit<00:01:18.330> I'm<00:01:18.869> gonna<00:01:18.990> hit

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
where you want to hit I'm gonna hit

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.130 
where you want to hit I'm gonna hit
those<00:01:19.229> legs<00:01:19.970> so<00:01:20.970> not<00:01:21.450> being<00:01:21.630> able<00:01:21.720> to<00:01:21.810> walk<00:01:21.930> on

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
those legs so not being able to walk on

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.270 
those legs so not being able to walk on
can<00:01:22.380> make<00:01:22.530> it<00:01:22.650> kind<00:01:22.799> of<00:01:22.830> tricky<00:01:23.100> if<00:01:23.159> you're

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
can make it kind of tricky if you're

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.399 
can make it kind of tricky if you're
using<00:01:23.460> a<00:01:23.640> smaller<00:01:23.880> weapon<00:01:24.270> I<00:01:24.360> used<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:25.080> saw

using a smaller weapon I used the saw

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.530 
using a smaller weapon I used the saw
cleaver<00:01:25.680> for<00:01:26.520> this<00:01:26.640> fight<00:01:26.850> it<00:01:27.000> was<00:01:27.119> I<00:01:27.330> think

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
cleaver for this fight it was I think

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.620 
cleaver for this fight it was I think
upgraded<00:01:28.200> to<00:01:28.320> +6<00:01:28.829> and<00:01:29.490> it<00:01:29.670> made<00:01:29.880> pretty<00:01:30.210> short

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
upgraded to +6 and it made pretty short

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.030 
upgraded to +6 and it made pretty short
work<00:01:30.840> at<00:01:30.960> them<00:01:31.079> I<00:01:31.290> also<00:01:31.650> had<00:01:31.799> a<00:01:31.829> fire

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
work at them I also had a fire

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.440 
work at them I also had a fire
enchantment<00:01:32.520> on<00:01:32.549> there<00:01:32.729> so<00:01:32.880> if<00:01:33.119> you<00:01:33.270> found

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
enchantment on there so if you found

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.330 
enchantment on there so if you found
that<00:01:33.659> it<00:01:33.810> seemed<00:01:34.049> to<00:01:34.200> do<00:01:34.500> pretty<00:01:34.530> well<00:01:35.040> by<00:01:35.189> him

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
that it seemed to do pretty well by him

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.859 
that it seemed to do pretty well by him
but<00:01:35.460> I<00:01:35.610> don't<00:01:35.790> think<00:01:35.939> that's<00:01:36.090> necessary<00:01:36.750> by

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
but I don't think that's necessary by

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.960 
but I don't think that's necessary by
any<00:01:37.020> means<00:01:37.250> so<00:01:38.250> yeah<00:01:38.400> that's<00:01:38.640> how<00:01:38.700> you<00:01:38.790> take

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
any means so yeah that's how you take

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.700 
any means so yeah that's how you take
down<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.210> dark<00:01:39.570> beast<00:01:39.750> parl<00:01:40.079> just<00:01:40.439> remember

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
down the dark beast parl just remember

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.710 
down the dark beast parl just remember
to<00:01:40.799> stay<00:01:40.950> underneath<00:01:41.220> him<00:01:41.520> try<00:01:42.299> and<00:01:42.360> hit<00:01:42.600> his

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
to stay underneath him try and hit his

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.600 
to stay underneath him try and hit his
legs<00:01:42.960> as<00:01:43.350> much<00:01:43.500> as<00:01:43.770> you<00:01:43.829> can

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
legs as much as you can

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.039 
legs as much as you can
doing<00:01:45.060> so<00:01:45.180> quickly<00:01:45.479> enough<00:01:45.630> will<00:01:45.750> actually

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
doing so quickly enough will actually

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.260 
doing so quickly enough will actually
interrupt<00:01:46.560> his<00:01:46.799> AoE<00:01:47.130> attack<00:01:47.490> and<00:01:47.820> if<00:01:48.060> you<00:01:48.149> can

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
interrupt his AoE attack and if you can

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.460 
interrupt his AoE attack and if you can
do<00:01:48.329> that<00:01:48.450> enough<00:01:48.689> you<00:01:48.810> could<00:01:49.140> even<00:01:49.290> get

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
do that enough you could even get

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:50.450 
do that enough you could even get
through<00:01:49.619> this<00:01:49.740> fight<00:01:49.860> without<00:01:49.950> taking<00:01:50.369> a<00:01:50.430> hit

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
through this fight without taking a hit

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.580

at staying underneath him and hitting
his<00:01:54.930> legs<00:01:55.110> will<00:01:55.350> help<00:01:55.470> the<00:01:55.590> lock-on<00:01:55.950> and

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250
