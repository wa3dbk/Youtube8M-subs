look we gon be all right so the last DIY
is<00:03:13.690> definitely<00:03:14.140> most<00:03:14.319> time-consuming<00:03:14.680> but

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
is definitely most time-consuming but

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:16.920 
is definitely most time-consuming but
it's<00:03:15.580> still<00:03:15.790> easy<00:03:16.060> so<00:03:16.420> you're<00:03:16.540> going<00:03:16.630> to<00:03:16.720> need

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
then obviously a photo so I printed out

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:24.900 
then obviously a photo so I printed out
a<00:03:23.470> picture<00:03:23.800> of<00:03:23.920> marble<00:03:24.430> because<00:03:24.640> I<00:03:24.670> kind<00:03:24.880> of

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:30.809 
top in a way and I printed two of those
just<00:03:29.560> because<00:03:29.739> I<00:03:29.800> realized<00:03:30.100> my<00:03:30.190> canvas<00:03:30.640> was

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.030 
too big so i went ahead and i measured
that<00:03:33.730> out<00:03:33.910> and<00:03:34.180> cut<00:03:34.690> it<00:03:34.840> and<00:03:35.019> cut<00:03:35.739> off<00:03:35.860> any

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.430 
that out and cut it and cut off any
extra<00:03:36.489> and<00:03:36.910> made<00:03:37.150> sure<00:03:37.180> that<00:03:37.569> both<00:03:37.989> pieces

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
extra and made sure that both pieces

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.890 
extra and made sure that both pieces
would<00:03:38.860> fit<00:03:39.160> on<00:03:39.310> there<00:03:39.489> perfectly<00:03:40.060> and<00:03:40.390> then

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
would fit on there perfectly and then

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:42.750 
would fit on there perfectly and then
you<00:03:40.989> can<00:03:41.110> go<00:03:41.140> ahead<00:03:41.350> and<00:03:41.500> pour<00:03:42.010> some<00:03:42.250> oshkosh
