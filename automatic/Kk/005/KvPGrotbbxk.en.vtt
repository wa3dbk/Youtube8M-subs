00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:12.599
 practicable are really festive today 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.820
 As a council because the races 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.859
 studio fabrics of the same size in 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.980
 so you can store the cabinet or 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:22.850
 even inside a box for example the 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.920
 difference between an effect completely 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:28.619
 messy and a neat effect e 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.349
 this you see all the fabrics have the 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:35.010
 same size and fit perfectly 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:37.730
 in our shelf to do this 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:41.940
 we simply have to take the m 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:46.379
 go to measure the width and the 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:51.149
 depth of our shelf we will create 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:55.949
 then a card that has to come in a lot 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:57.840
 comfortably in our shelf at this 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.670
 point we just take the other 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.160
 stop detail to see these also 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:05.309
 all and half stalls the sup 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:09.720
 we are going to bend slightly for 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:12.810
 get a lot more measure 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.409
 great of our cardboard we must 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.409
 withdraw 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:24.630
 at this point how we take ours 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:29.130
 we put it in the middle of cardboard 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:32.329
 we are going to bend our fabric on 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.329
 our cardboard 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:40.710
 in this way we hide the vital tt 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.330
 the Italian parts we ask only the 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:49.370
 first gross 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:52.340
 let's go to this point 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:56.430
 we find our cardboard on the glass 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:02:03.540
 let's go to prevent areas above now 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:07.610
 this fabric is dead wrong for 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.610
 this point we make the second fold 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:17.190
 we remove the card this way 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:22.310
 also give final deployed and why 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:22.310
 our staff are bent 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:27.890
 I hope you have been helpful, see you 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:30.640
 the next time another board 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.640
 a big kiss hello
