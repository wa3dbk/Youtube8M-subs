 I 've already unpacked that 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:42.070
 quite as nicely packaged there's me but 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:43.989
 then the sd card suffers from greasy 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:45.010
 my camera and then yes animals rods 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:47.410
 history should actually 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:49.420
 This wish me already one day 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.890
 but soon it will be fitting 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.239
 you have new season friends too 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:54.730
 a new mouse, if you like 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:56.379
 Of course, how does it win? 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:58.780
 you see everything right after the band 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:00.370
 boxing so unpack first and then 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:05.400
 Any further friends I hope 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:09.240
 you enjoy it and you like it 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:13.619
 unboxing here is the pretty piece 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.619
 small movie shot 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:18.100
 but i was saying pack out the good 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:21.960
 piece of green first time out I hope 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.960
 again reasonably well 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:33.290
 So we put first to the side yes there is 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:34.300
 you order the idea 602 there was here 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:38.780
 a bit sharper 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:42.050
 all the worse off very nicely pack 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:44.900
 which definitely say on against tools 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:47.680
 Just imagine this as follows 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:50.750
 Now everything has been told before 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:54.220
 since I actually all in one 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:02:01.910
 infusion meant haug 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:02:04.310
 the kids will need the weather soon 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:05.690
 well we have the medium and get out 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.539

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.700
 really 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.600
 So it's that easy 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.560
 feeling man has become easy 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:30.290
 she is quite tall but for that as said 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:33.350
 you can here his finger perfectly all 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:37.010
 The buttons are the ones we run 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:40.430
 have here by on the sides is still 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:43.810
 Just do it here alone 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.810
 did that once with the way 

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:54.640
 If anyone in any case I do not know 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:03:02.290

 new extra buttons from the binger you can 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:09.700
 there are still a lot of evidence 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:12.850
 I would say that's the good piece 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.920
 now read brand data before the 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:20.080

 a race comment from that is so 

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:14.610

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:19.139
 Now he thinks he knows where that is 

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:21.119

 days a video comments that is 

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:53.900
 even theoretically if you have any video 

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:55.670
 would be commented on in the next few days 

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:56.570
 then even your chances of winning 

00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:57.890
 increase 

00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:59.360

 that we just saw by chance 

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:23.420
 and otherwise never looked at someone videos 

00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:24.770

00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:38.360
 ask to have that at all and 

00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:42.650

00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:47.190
