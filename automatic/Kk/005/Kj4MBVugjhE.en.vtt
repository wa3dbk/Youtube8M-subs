so<00:00:09.750> the<00:00:10.320> first<00:00:10.559> Matt<00:00:10.769> Kozar<00:00:11.030> arena<00:00:12.030> one<00:00:12.210> two

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
so the first Matt Kozar arena one two

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.240 
so the first Matt Kozar arena one two
three<00:00:12.599> now<00:00:12.750> what<00:00:12.900> these<00:00:13.049> do<00:00:13.230> is<00:00:13.259> when<00:00:14.099> you're

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
three now what these do is when you're

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.609 
three now what these do is when you're
playing<00:00:14.400> arena<00:00:14.790> you'll<00:00:15.089> have<00:00:15.299> a<00:00:15.330> three<00:00:15.990> like

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
playing arena you'll have a three like

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.170 
playing arena you'll have a three like
you<00:00:16.770> have<00:00:16.890> three<00:00:17.190> enemies<00:00:17.490> on<00:00:17.640> the<00:00:17.699> side<00:00:17.880> and

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
you have three enemies on the side and

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.090 
you have three enemies on the side and
then<00:00:18.539> from<00:00:18.990> top<00:00:19.230> to<00:00:19.260> bottom<00:00:19.470> so<00:00:19.710> the<00:00:19.770> top<00:00:19.920> ones

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
then from top to bottom so the top ones

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.340 
then from top to bottom so the top ones
one<00:00:20.330> then<00:00:21.330> in<00:00:21.480> the<00:00:21.570> middle<00:00:21.810> two<00:00:21.930> and<00:00:22.199> then<00:00:22.289> the

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
one then in the middle two and then the

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:23.509 
one then in the middle two and then the
bottom<00:00:22.529> three<00:00:22.710> and<00:00:22.890> then<00:00:23.070> you<00:00:23.220> have<00:00:23.340> these

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
bottom three and then you have these

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.009 
bottom three and then you have these
math<00:00:23.699> problems<00:00:23.730> to<00:00:24.029> target<00:00:24.390> one<00:00:24.539> two<00:00:24.720> three

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
math problems to target one two three

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.160 
math problems to target one two three
what<00:00:25.590> this<00:00:25.769> stops<00:00:26.070> is<00:00:26.340> like<00:00:26.630> for<00:00:27.630> me<00:00:27.779> clicking

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
what this stops is like for me clicking

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.810 
what this stops is like for me clicking
because<00:00:28.380> I<00:00:28.500> remember<00:00:28.890> I<00:00:28.949> used<00:00:28.980> to<00:00:29.189> click<00:00:29.429> to

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
because I remember I used to click to

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:30.980 
because I remember I used to click to
switch<00:00:29.970> targets<00:00:30.179> and<00:00:30.480> it<00:00:30.539> was<00:00:30.630> just<00:00:30.779> slower

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
switch targets and it was just slower

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.900 
switch targets and it was just slower
and<00:00:31.260> as<00:00:31.439> soon<00:00:31.590> as<00:00:31.619> I<00:00:31.710> started<00:00:31.920> using<00:00:31.980> these<00:00:32.279> the

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
and as soon as I started using these the

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.280 
and as soon as I started using these the
arena<00:00:33.090> became<00:00:33.210> a<00:00:33.450> lot<00:00:33.600> more<00:00:33.750> fluent<00:00:34.050> and<00:00:34.110> stuff

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
arena became a lot more fluent and stuff

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.170 
arena became a lot more fluent and stuff
so<00:00:35.100> I<00:00:35.130> recommend<00:00:35.579> you<00:00:35.640> try<00:00:35.760> that<00:00:35.940> if<00:00:36.030> you<00:00:36.059> do

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
so I recommend you try that if you do

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.150 
so I recommend you try that if you do
any<00:00:36.270> threes<00:00:36.450> so<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.440> next<00:00:37.559> macro<00:00:37.950> I've<00:00:38.010> got

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
any threes so the next macro I've got

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.340 
any threes so the next macro I've got
and<00:00:38.370> it<00:00:39.180> looks<00:00:39.600> like<00:00:39.660> a<00:00:39.750> normal<00:00:39.899> golf<00:00:40.170> swing

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
and it looks like a normal golf swing

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.540 
and it looks like a normal golf swing
from<00:00:40.469> a<00:00:40.530> girl<00:00:40.739> but<00:00:40.920> it<00:00:41.040> has<00:00:41.160> an<00:00:41.340> exclamation

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
from a girl but it has an exclamation

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.100 
from a girl but it has an exclamation
mark<00:00:42.030> in<00:00:42.120> front<00:00:42.270> of<00:00:42.360> it<00:00:42.450> and<00:00:42.600> now<00:00:42.719> I'll<00:00:42.930> show

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
mark in front of it and now I'll show

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.930 
mark in front of it and now I'll show
that<00:00:43.290> does<00:00:43.469> basically<00:00:44.219> when<00:00:44.640> you<00:00:44.700> in<00:00:44.760> gross

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
that does basically when you in gross

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.930 
that does basically when you in gross
wolf<00:00:45.180> and<00:00:45.539> you<00:00:46.469> see<00:00:47.190> you<00:00:47.280> expiring<00:00:47.579> it<00:00:47.730> to<00:00:47.820> get

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
wolf and you see you expiring it to get

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.040 
wolf and you see you expiring it to get
it<00:00:48.000> to<00:00:48.059> go<00:00:48.149> stuff<00:00:48.360> because<00:00:48.510> you<00:00:48.600> really<00:00:48.930> being

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
it to go stuff because you really being

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.959 
it to go stuff because you really being
all<00:00:49.230> sorts<00:00:49.469> amusing<00:00:49.829> now<00:00:50.010> if<00:00:50.640> you<00:00:50.760> press<00:00:50.940> it

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
all sorts amusing now if you press it

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.450 
all sorts amusing now if you press it
twice<00:00:51.199> usually<00:00:52.199> without<00:00:52.710> this<00:00:52.829> macro<00:00:53.219> you

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
twice usually without this macro you

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.369 
twice usually without this macro you
would<00:00:53.579> go<00:00:53.969> back<00:00:54.149> into<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.480> dwarf<00:00:54.780> form<00:00:54.960> or

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
would go back into the dwarf form or

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.500 
would go back into the dwarf form or
whatever<00:00:55.920> you're<00:00:56.039> playing<00:00:56.190> them<00:00:56.399> out<00:00:56.520> suck<00:00:56.850> so

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
whatever you're playing them out suck so

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.090 
whatever you're playing them out suck so
you<00:00:57.600> put<00:00:57.719> this<00:00:57.809> in<00:00:57.930> front<00:00:57.960> of<00:00:58.140> it<00:00:58.260> one<00:00:58.890> string

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
you put this in front of it one string

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.460 
you put this in front of it one string
goes<00:00:59.250> well<00:00:59.399> for<00:00:59.609> me<00:00:59.699> it<00:01:00.030> won't<00:01:00.270> be<00:01:00.390> canceled

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:03.470 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:06.020 

next<00:01:04.470> I've<00:01:04.589> got<00:01:04.619> grand<00:01:05.010> total<00:01:05.400> which<00:01:05.729> with

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
next I've got grand total which with

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.789 
next I've got grand total which with
their<00:01:06.240> stop<00:01:06.600> casting<00:01:06.780> in<00:01:06.990> front<00:01:07.170> of<00:01:07.229> it<00:01:07.320> now

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
their stop casting in front of it now

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.260 
their stop casting in front of it now
you<00:01:07.830> can<00:01:08.010> either<00:01:08.100> do<00:01:08.220> this<00:01:08.310> manually<00:01:08.670> or<00:01:09.030> like

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
you can either do this manually or like

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.830 
you can either do this manually or like
this<00:01:09.510> and<00:01:10.130> I<00:01:11.150> used<00:01:12.150> to<00:01:12.210> do<00:01:12.330> it<00:01:12.390> my<00:01:12.479> only<00:01:12.720> buddy

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
this and I used to do it my only buddy

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.020 
this and I used to do it my only buddy
well<00:01:13.350> I<00:01:13.380> still<00:01:13.799> do<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.040> morning<00:01:14.340> but<00:01:14.580> I<00:01:14.700> think

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
well I still do the morning but I think

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:15.980 
well I still do the morning but I think
I'm<00:01:15.150> probably<00:01:15.270> gonna<00:01:15.479> start<00:01:15.689> using<00:01:15.810> this

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
I'm probably gonna start using this

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.109 
I'm probably gonna start using this
again<00:01:16.229> just<00:01:16.439> because<00:01:16.530> it's<00:01:16.740> easier<00:01:17.130> my

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
again just because it's easier my

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.600 
again just because it's easier my
opinion<00:01:18.420> and<00:01:18.860> these<00:01:19.860> are<00:01:20.009> similar<00:01:20.189> to<00:01:20.369> arena

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
opinion and these are similar to arena

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.730 
opinion and these are similar to arena
1-2-3<00:01:21.090> but<00:01:21.330> they<00:01:21.479> cast<00:01:21.750> hex<00:01:22.049> on<00:01:22.320> that<00:01:22.470> target

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
1-2-3 but they cast hex on that target

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.039 
1-2-3 but they cast hex on that target
instead<00:01:23.159> so<00:01:23.430> you<00:01:23.460> don't<00:01:23.759> have<00:01:23.820> to<00:01:24.030> how<00:01:24.840> you'd

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
instead so you don't have to how you'd

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.690 
instead so you don't have to how you'd
have<00:01:25.140> to<00:01:25.229> switch<00:01:25.409> focus<00:01:25.619> and<00:01:26.159> then<00:01:26.340> hex<00:01:26.549> was

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
have to switch focus and then hex was

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.219
