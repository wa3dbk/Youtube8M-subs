 distracted welcome on we are going to play like that 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:24.310
 cynical games to play in studio 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:26.320
 with no card lingo and cut it like 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:28.960
 PR team knife with a score string sentry 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.340
 gun that machine and we confused machine 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.869
 immediately go over the right side of the 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:33.309
 walk because the middle does not go 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:34.780
 succeed with the cheese wrote about the blank 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:35.949
 chance is still possible but most go 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:37.540
 you die there too and I see three there 

00:00:35.949 --> 00:00:39.129
 enemy in my post right 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:40.360
 walking is just forced you on 

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:41.290
 during first time under rose 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.360
 don't test yet 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:44.559
 how is it there please boy 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.880
 we will wait a moment, look at your condition 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:47.620
 a sniper also once more to 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.360
 more knife holy shit that share and who 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.950
 teams home to face through that side of the 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.719
 map ok also share the chair that is rotating 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:54.070
 while is not turned on 

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:55.390
 you can see the light in the shoe 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.879
 my shoe is sitting next to me except for dinner 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:59.739
 have a nice long time so i'm playing wet 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:01.000
 I had to specify the schedule anyway 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:02.350
 buy new shoes so I do everything 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.640
 okay but the ksg 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:04.780
 super chill weapons to use though 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.850
 you just have to be a good one 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.289
 because otherwise you will miss everything like you 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.090
 can see because I also miss all the shit 

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:11.500
 man i venti stood still i that that goes 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.119
 move from left or right but you 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.470
 stopped and that's why it 's because me 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:15.729
 the ni estimated that more that do not 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.920
 but the parts do not move and 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:19.390
 therefore I suddenly shot everything ate mrs 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.130
 so annoying they all have to be tasty 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:22.750
 keep moving and at least I was hey 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:24.100
 hello from now thought i got going though 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.149
 walked over me 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.590
 yes you shoot but miss you 

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:28.300
 so much out i'm gonna try sometime 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.340
 sentry gun and the war machine that 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:31.569
 machine et cetera that we too 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.160
 one more time our killstreaks can 

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:34.869
 start using it and therefore something 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.819
 for scoring we are going to drop in this 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:38.979
 potty and that is someone again got him 

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:40.479
 rksg is really a chill weapon to 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:41.860
 and you can take one with you 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:43.390
 improved ksg 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:45.009
 such weapons is especially quick to sit 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.869
 and some other things then you can do one 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:48.520
 improve it through 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:50.440
 ago buying it so badly not so 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:53.140
 run around like this because this weapon is 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.970
 very accurate and correct it is one 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.140
 little Dutch To English word xl 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:57.489
 pronounce in the Netherlands but do not go 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:58.209
 succeed because in english only you 

00:01:57.489 --> 00:02:00.610
 understands what I mean 

00:01:58.209 --> 00:02:02.170
 And because of that you get better and better 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.509
 as you go with this we often 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.860
 play and this weapon is the super chill to 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:07.270
 to use they are not that good 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.800
 but the and him is that must not be 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:10.420
 be good if you are not so good one 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.860
 play with the weapon because it is very bad 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:13.870
 hard to play with because he really 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.310
 just sharpen bullets is the 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.420
 bullets just go straight ahead and they 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.709
 also just go to point where he 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.000
 directed they don't go like with the 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:20.500
 braking just left to right 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.880
 has gone up not down 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.830
 any way schagen 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.480
 fruit and therefore also just hits 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.680
 on your enemy you have to mock up on your enemy 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.340
 shoot because if this is no longer possible 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.810
 weapon 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.580
 it is difficult to play a weapon but 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.110
 really just a fun weapon to go with 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.730
 to play because it is hard to be there 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.170
 just get a good score with it 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.180
 to use it very much I 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.740
 have us my total is of six thousand 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.300
 kills on hem just a real chill weapon 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:41.650
 to use and you get better and better 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.270
 by so if you're not that good with 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.680
 use the trolley once try 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:46.480
 this wafer with you can be there 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.920
 getting better and here I am myself 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.060
 also got better again 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.520
 because I have played so much with it 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.750
 such as a tip in between and I have 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.450
 the feeling that there is someone here somewhere 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:57.130
 stands the Kempen but take the Irish building 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:58.360
 rockanje can not span more than 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:59.530
 they can also not kempen because if you 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.730
 team the trusses ca n't and no 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.290
 emmies are next to you 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.400
 So then you must always remember and 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.570
 now I am the and him for a moment 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.100
 bad boys 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:07.360
 that's how you'll all go 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.160
 everyone just stands still 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.750
 way with team what is with ten men it 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.100
 they are all literally just 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:14.890
 here you can then go upward climb 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:16.720
 he who done climbing that 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:18.070
 then walks to the right or so they do 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.170
 not really much they just have to be tasty 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:21.460
 keep moving and try that one 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:22.840
 go wrong by going on there 

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:24.430
 to run off we are not there 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.080
 they are just are all little 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.730
 silent holy shit files lots of energy 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.140
 crazy for going back soon and okay so 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.820
 once you get there we quickly leave 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:31.930
 run because I have so many and family 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:33.790
 playing him a little to go is there 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:35.740
 apparently just dead and sitting here 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:37.270
 one oh shit i also miss fatter 

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:38.410
 file I just missed it quietly 

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:39.940
 there was a corner 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:41.170
 they were pretty thick foam yet 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.000
 are we dying so I find everything 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:44.710
 best as long as the throat can just grab and 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.630
 if we do not die then I think it is rather 

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:48.700
 good if I knock you off 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:51.250
 I had never forgiven myself 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:52.690
 o shit o my god o my god never look 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:54.880
 Buying works like that eaten with the cheese 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:56.680
 that those bullets go straight ahead like you 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:58.390
 shipping or no scope then can 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.380
 that bullets deviation left to 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:01.600
 up and down 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:02.800
 you must always zoom in with this weapon and 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:04.900
 that's why it is just so delicious 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:07.030
 weapons to use but so if you 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.350
 tries has eggs so we are not going 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:10.810
 well and you miss everything and then you go 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:12.040
 still dead so yes around twelve 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:15.070
 but 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.540
 super trio except you have a tasty then 

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:18.250
 reason for stay because they stay 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:20.140
 player literally all with the sniper 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:21.640
 dynamic and actually the ksg too 

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:23.950
 just a sniper only then just one 

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:25.360
 striper shot can and this just wants 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:26.740
 not with the site I thought everyone was quiet 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.300
 with the veil except those have half 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:30.400
 those who come across when I say so 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:31.570
 and apart from these two so stupid you can 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.100
 we can put a figure behind it 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:34.780
 If you stand the Harz buy me 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:38.380
 stood close istock 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:39.490
 keep seat well so he turns 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:41.050
 time to live to right me that 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:42.580
 severely irritating as I am quite right of it 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:44.050
 sharp is and if he is 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:45.520
 turns then your new one is straight 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.930
 for your screen cunt so what the fuck 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:49.330
 I meet the press 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:51.130
 20,000 rupees at once in here oh my 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:52.419
 god all my god it is their rob potty 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:54.280
 with a team that does n't do much either 

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:55.570
 Kids are just everyone else 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:56.950
 is in the jar it can sneak me 

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:57.610
 had to grab it was chubby anyway 

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:59.650
 to become 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:01.780
 cover the stuff with the chance give in well 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:03.910
 my back please boy and play there 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:05.169
 also did one with a ramic ton 

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:08.320
 always zooming in with this weapon works us 

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:09.940
 or not was eating again 

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:11.350
 always have to keep zooming 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:12.580
 you just stay with any weapon as 

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:15.100
 such a flour with the cheese screen too 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:16.960
 just with on 94 also just with this that 

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:18.100
 This weapon zooming everywhere because 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:20.080
 then you are scared a lot 

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:21.610
 judge forward and they really all play 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:24.400
 with the snow is just thick cut the 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:25.750
 lobby or summer looked quite like him 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:26.770
 I now just played the normal apple 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:28.210
 I think they can probably do this 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:29.740
 packs a mention is I have such 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:31.570
 cheese skewer in jan a series of shit 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:33.280
 I should have made another one 

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:34.150
 yourself that she trains the Kempen 

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:36.760
 care is then the rest 

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:38.229
 bye bye bye was a nice gentleman 

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:39.790
 fogg that does not touch again because I am now 

00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:41.350
 almost touched me so he could 

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:43.150
 just keep going and now I am standing 

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:44.470
 subsites pop he is the kempvis 

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:46.060

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:47.320
 and I wait my shop if you like this 

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:49.000

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:54.520

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:55.720

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:56.710
 because that fat filled I just follow me then 

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:58.240
 now we go down quickly 

00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:00.039
 so the coach you can create them too 

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:01.600
 just run away again and the park road is 

00:06:00.039 --> 00:06:02.620
 the f alv these long distances and we 

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:03.970
 just have a game just it was 

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:05.530
 a super cup game to play 

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:06.760
 but as can see it is not always possible 

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:08.650
 go well in call or duty sometimes you go 

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:10.150

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:13.450
 So play a good score that with it 

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:14.919

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:16.300

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:20.380

00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:22.000
