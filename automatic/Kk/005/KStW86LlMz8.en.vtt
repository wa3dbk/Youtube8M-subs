00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:20.580
 unpacking 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:41.560
 inside we see this kind of packing box 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:44.530
 open the network storage itself 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:48.460
 rather timidly i am so how goes without 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:52.650
 built-in hard drives on the front 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:55.980
 the panel is visible indicators of work 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:02:01.240
 network hard disk operation 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:02.100
 voltage quick create button 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.970
 quick

 and voltage connection 60 millimeters 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:24.100
 the fan is pretty quiet 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:29.230
 Currently this storage facility for installation 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:32.080
 hard drives after very light 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:35.410
 opening it was enough shifted one 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:37.590
 from the lids we access the entrails 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:40.770
 from his store 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:46.000

 top panel to install two hard 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:58.260
 drive fan first drive already 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:03:01.620
 installed connector here it is located 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:03.730
 connection the second dinner will be required 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:13.020
 do not connect the clouds you bundled 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:13.020
 cables up to bundling still bundled 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:29.790
 power supply network cable rj-45 as 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.790
 were connecting the second drive 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:37.650
 quick install guide 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:46.019
 CD with drivers and software 

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:52.180
 collateral and prices 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:56.260

 four bolts on each drive on 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:03.969
 parents will set as 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:06.129
 maximum volume 4 terabytes will be spirit 

00:04:03.969 --> 00:04:11.400
 terabyte set should not buy 

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:11.400
 heavily expensive cheap enough 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:18.970
 network storage is not as full 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:21.699
 computer speed mines than any 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:27.240
 The main task is to save data and 

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:27.240
 access to them will install 1 disk 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:41.280
 so all 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:48.240
 the first disk got up and went into the slot 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:05:00.660

 connected to the entire assembly and installation that 

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:25.690
 skill 5 minutes, you can close the lid and 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:28.150
 price proceed directly to 

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:31.830
 setting use which will 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:35.820
