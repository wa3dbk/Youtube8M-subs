00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
things that makes hard flips so

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.240 
things that makes hard flips so
difficult<00:00:36.660> is<00:00:36.870> getting<00:00:37.380> your<00:00:37.500> front<00:00:37.770> foot<00:00:38.040> out

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
of the way while still being able to

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.740 
of the way while still being able to
flip<00:00:40.710> the<00:00:40.890> board<00:00:41.180> another<00:00:42.180> thing<00:00:42.450> that<00:00:42.600> I<00:00:42.629> do

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
flip the board another thing that I do

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.080 
flip the board another thing that I do
to<00:00:43.260> handle<00:00:43.440> this<00:00:43.770> is<00:00:44.010> I<00:00:44.460> put<00:00:44.610> my<00:00:44.730> front<00:00:44.969> foot

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
to handle this is I put my front foot

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.389 
to handle this is I put my front foot
almost<00:00:45.420> straight<00:00:45.899> on<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.200> board<00:00:46.440> you<00:00:47.219> can<00:00:47.370> see

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
almost straight on the board you can see

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.250 
almost straight on the board you can see
your<00:00:47.760> foot<00:00:48.030> is<00:00:48.210> almost<00:00:48.510> in<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:48.840> exact<00:00:49.079> same

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
your foot is almost in the exact same

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.040 
your foot is almost in the exact same
place<00:00:49.469> you<00:00:49.950> had<00:00:50.129> it<00:00:50.280> for<00:00:50.460> kick<00:00:50.730> flips<00:00:50.969> and<00:00:51.270> it's

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
place you had it for kick flips and it's

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.810 
place you had it for kick flips and it's
almost<00:00:52.289> like<00:00:52.500> you're<00:00:52.649> trying<00:00:52.800> to<00:00:52.980> do<00:00:53.129> a<00:00:53.399> kick

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
almost like you're trying to do a kick

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.670 
almost like you're trying to do a kick
flip<00:00:53.850> and<00:00:54.239> a<00:00:54.510> frontside<00:00:54.930> pop<00:00:55.140> shove-it

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
flip and a frontside pop shove-it

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.549 
flip and a frontside pop shove-it
which<00:00:56.219> is<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.879> trick<00:00:57.180> but<00:00:57.870> really<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.320> hard

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
which is the trick but really the hard

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.110 
which is the trick but really the hard
flip<00:00:58.770> once<00:00:59.010> you<00:00:59.129> put<00:00:59.309> it<00:00:59.399> all<00:00:59.489> together<00:00:59.640> it's<00:01:00.030> a

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
flip once you put it all together it's a

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.479 
flip once you put it all together it's a
little<00:01:00.300> bit<00:01:00.600> different<00:01:01.079> now<00:01:01.260> I<00:01:02.070> don't<00:01:02.370> know

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
little bit different now I don't know

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:03.799 
little bit different now I don't know
what<00:01:02.640> you<00:01:02.789> meant<00:01:03.000> by<00:01:03.149> this<00:01:03.210> I<00:01:03.449> don't<00:01:03.480> know<00:01:03.719> what

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
what you meant by this I don't know what

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.570 
what you meant by this I don't know what
it<00:01:03.899> means<00:01:04.080> pluck<00:01:04.439> it<00:01:04.710> and<00:01:04.920> I<00:01:05.070> don't<00:01:05.129> know<00:01:05.400> what

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
it means pluck it and I don't know what

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.990 
it means pluck it and I don't know what
a<00:01:05.610> frontside<00:01:06.180> varial<00:01:06.780> would<00:01:06.960> be<00:01:07.610> that<00:01:08.610> one<00:01:08.820> was

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
a frontside varial would be that one was

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.539 
a frontside varial would be that one was
great<00:01:09.270> you<00:01:09.630> landed<00:01:10.470> on<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.740> board<00:01:11.040> and<00:01:11.369> you're

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
great you landed on the board and you're

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:12.890 
great you landed on the board and you're
so<00:01:11.939> close

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
so close

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.260 
so close
you're<00:01:13.470> a<00:01:13.500> little<00:01:13.890> bit<00:01:14.040> under<00:01:14.369> rotated<00:01:14.939> on<00:01:15.060> the

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
you're a little bit under rotated on the

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.080 
you're a little bit under rotated on the
board<00:01:16.229> spinning<00:01:16.680> a<00:01:16.770> 180<00:01:17.159> but<00:01:17.670> other<00:01:17.850> than<00:01:18.000> that

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
board spinning a 180 but other than that

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.090 
board spinning a 180 but other than that
you<00:01:18.360> are<00:01:18.540> really<00:01:18.869> close<00:01:19.049> on<00:01:19.229> that<00:01:19.350> one<00:01:19.409> so

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
you are really close on that one so

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.380 
you are really close on that one so
we'll<00:01:20.250> look<00:01:20.340> at<00:01:20.490> my<00:01:20.610> foot<00:01:20.820> position<00:01:21.240> right

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
we'll look at my foot position right

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.270 
we'll look at my foot position right
here<00:01:21.420> my<00:01:21.780> front<00:01:21.990> foot<00:01:22.110> is<00:01:22.439> almost<00:01:22.710> straight

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
here my front foot is almost straight

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.120 
here my front foot is almost straight
and<00:01:23.670> vertical<00:01:23.850> on<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.420> board<00:01:24.780> and<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.710> reason

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
and vertical on the board and the reason

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.550 
and vertical on the board and the reason
I<00:01:26.250> do<00:01:26.310> that<00:01:26.549> is<00:01:27.000> so<00:01:27.360> that<00:01:27.720> when<00:01:27.840> I<00:01:27.900> flip<00:01:28.020> the

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
I do that is so that when I flip the

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.890 
I do that is so that when I flip the
board<00:01:28.770> around<00:01:28.979> my<00:01:29.700> front<00:01:30.000> foot<00:01:30.060> can<00:01:30.479> get<00:01:30.720> out

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
board around my front foot can get out

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.620 
board around my front foot can get out
of<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.259> way<00:01:31.670> now<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.759> thing<00:01:33.030> that<00:01:33.180> makes<00:01:33.390> this

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
of the way now the thing that makes this

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.780 
of the way now the thing that makes this
trick<00:01:34.200> a<00:01:34.229> little<00:01:34.619> bit<00:01:34.950> different<00:01:35.430> than<00:01:35.610> just

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
trick a little bit different than just

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.819 
trick a little bit different than just
thinking<00:01:36.240> with<00:01:36.600> it<00:01:36.780> like<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.290> same<00:01:37.530> as<00:01:37.740> you

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
thinking with it like the same as you

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.499 
thinking with it like the same as you
would<00:01:37.979> a<00:01:38.040> frontside<00:01:38.579> shove-it<00:01:39.060> and<00:01:39.270> a

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
would a frontside shove-it and a

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.020 
would a frontside shove-it and a
kickflip<00:01:39.930> is<00:01:40.110> that<00:01:40.860> your<00:01:41.009> board<00:01:41.340> goes<00:01:41.640> almost

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
kickflip is that your board goes almost

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.080 
kickflip is that your board goes almost
up<00:01:42.479> it<00:01:42.960> goes<00:01:43.170> almost<00:01:43.409> vertical<00:01:44.189> so<00:01:44.820> you<00:01:44.880> see

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
up it goes almost vertical so you see

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.940 
up it goes almost vertical so you see
how<00:01:45.270> I<00:01:45.299> practice<00:01:45.899> flipping<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:46.530> board<00:01:46.770> there

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
how I practice flipping the board there

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.350 
how I practice flipping the board there
with<00:01:47.100> stepping<00:01:47.340> off<00:01:47.579> with<00:01:47.759> my<00:01:47.909> back<00:01:48.149> foot

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
with stepping off with my back foot

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.690 
with stepping off with my back foot
that's<00:01:49.079> what<00:01:49.259> I<00:01:49.350> suggest<00:01:49.799> you<00:01:49.920> do<00:01:50.070> is<00:01:50.189> practice

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
that's what I suggest you do is practice

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.160 
that's what I suggest you do is practice
while<00:01:50.939> stepping<00:01:51.240> off<00:01:51.509> with<00:01:51.630> your<00:01:51.720> back<00:01:51.899> foot<00:01:52.110> a

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
while stepping off with your back foot a

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.139 
while stepping off with your back foot a
little<00:01:52.320> bit<00:01:52.470> but<00:01:53.369> now<00:01:53.460> let's<00:01:53.640> check<00:01:53.790> this<00:01:53.939> out

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
little bit but now let's check this out

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.910 
little bit but now let's check this out
you<00:01:54.450> see<00:01:54.630> how<00:01:54.780> my<00:01:54.930> board<00:01:55.229> it<00:01:55.380> almost<00:01:55.590> flips

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
you see how my board it almost flips

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.490 
you see how my board it almost flips
like<00:01:56.130> vertical<00:01:56.759> up<00:01:56.939> into<00:01:57.270> the<00:01:57.390> air<00:01:57.570> and<00:01:57.810> then

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
like vertical up into the air and then

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.300 
like vertical up into the air and then
spins<00:01:58.860> around

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310 
spins around

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:01.950 
spins around
the<00:02:00.909> less<00:02:01.119> that<00:02:01.330> you<00:02:01.420> can<00:02:01.600> make<00:02:01.780> it<00:02:01.930> go

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:01.960 
the less that you can make it go

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.080 
the less that you can make it go
vertical<00:02:02.590> and<00:02:02.830> the<00:02:02.979> more<00:02:03.159> that<00:02:03.340> you<00:02:03.400> can<00:02:03.490> make

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
vertical and the more that you can make

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.840 
vertical and the more that you can make
it<00:02:04.270> wrap<00:02:04.600> around<00:02:05.080> the<00:02:05.409> better<00:02:05.670> just<00:02:06.670> like<00:02:06.820> a

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 
it wrap around the better just like a

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.900 
it wrap around the better just like a
real<00:02:07.210> like<00:02:07.600> around<00:02:08.200> the<00:02:08.470> side<00:02:08.679> hardflip<00:02:09.250> but

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
real like around the side hardflip but

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.809 
real like around the side hardflip but
you<00:02:09.970> can<00:02:10.149> see<00:02:10.330> how<00:02:10.509> like<00:02:11.050> my<00:02:11.500> back<00:02:12.100> foot<00:02:12.310> slaps

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
you can see how like my back foot slaps

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:15.960 
you can see how like my back foot slaps
the<00:02:13.060> board<00:02:13.330> my<00:02:14.020> nose<00:02:14.319> comes<00:02:14.740> up<00:02:14.980> and<00:02:15.190> then<00:02:15.730> my

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
the board my nose comes up and then my

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.350 
the board my nose comes up and then my
front<00:02:16.510> foot<00:02:16.569> just<00:02:17.260> Nick's<00:02:17.950> it<00:02:18.160> just<00:02:18.610> enough<00:02:19.060> to

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
front foot just Nick's it just enough to

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.050 
front foot just Nick's it just enough to
make<00:02:19.720> it<00:02:19.870> do<00:02:20.110> that<00:02:20.350> rotation<00:02:21.069> and<00:02:21.280> then<00:02:21.790> gets

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
make it do that rotation and then gets

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.940 
make it do that rotation and then gets
out<00:02:22.239> of<00:02:22.390> the<00:02:22.510> way<00:02:22.690> and<00:02:23.170> then<00:02:23.410> you<00:02:23.500> see<00:02:23.680> how<00:02:23.800> my

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
out of the way and then you see how my

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.650 
out of the way and then you see how my
front<00:02:24.250> foot<00:02:24.310> comes<00:02:24.760> around<00:02:25.000> and<00:02:25.180> catches<00:02:25.510> the

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
front foot comes around and catches the

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.990 
front foot comes around and catches the
board<00:02:25.870> and<00:02:26.110> then<00:02:26.319> my<00:02:26.500> back<00:02:26.770> foot<00:02:27.010> just<00:02:27.069> goes

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
board and then my back foot just goes

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.620 
board and then my back foot just goes
right<00:02:28.360> over<00:02:28.390> the<00:02:28.720> edge<00:02:28.959> so<00:02:29.920> it's<00:02:30.880> not<00:02:31.150> quite

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
right over the edge so it's not quite

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.540 
right over the edge so it's not quite
you<00:02:31.959> can't<00:02:32.230> quite<00:02:32.590> think<00:02:32.620> with<00:02:33.130> this<00:02:33.280> trick

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
you can't quite think with this trick

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:35.310 
you can't quite think with this trick
like<00:02:33.760> just<00:02:34.060> a<00:02:34.180> frontside<00:02:34.630> shove-it<00:02:34.989> in<00:02:35.200> a

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:35.320 
like just a frontside shove-it in a

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.710 
like just a frontside shove-it in a
kickflip<00:02:35.800> you<00:02:36.640> have<00:02:36.820> to<00:02:37.000> kind<00:02:37.239> of<00:02:37.300> think<00:02:37.510> with

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
kickflip you have to kind of think with

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.350 
kickflip you have to kind of think with
popping<00:02:38.200> the<00:02:38.320> board<00:02:38.620> a<00:02:38.920> little<00:02:39.670> bit<00:02:39.910> in

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
popping the board a little bit in

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.180 
popping the board a little bit in
between<00:02:40.750> your<00:02:40.900> legs<00:02:41.080> and<00:02:41.350> getting<00:02:41.500> that<00:02:41.739> front

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
between your legs and getting that front

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:44.520 
between your legs and getting that front
foot<00:02:42.489> out<00:02:42.760> of<00:02:42.940> the<00:02:43.090> way<00:02:43.239> you<00:02:43.989> can<00:02:44.110> see<00:02:44.320> how

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
foot out of the way you can see how

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.949 
foot out of the way you can see how
close<00:02:44.830> my<00:02:45.069> feet<00:02:45.340> are<00:02:45.459> together<00:02:45.670> and<00:02:46.180> again<00:02:46.750> my

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
close my feet are together and again my

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:49.020 
close my feet are together and again my
front<00:02:47.319> foot<00:02:47.590> is<00:02:47.830> almost<00:02:48.190> vertical<00:02:48.459> like

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
front foot is almost vertical like

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:50.729 
front foot is almost vertical like
straight<00:02:49.480> up<00:02:49.510> and<00:02:49.810> down<00:02:49.870> on<00:02:50.110> the<00:02:50.200> board<00:02:50.500> I

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739 
straight up and down on the board I

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:52.830 
straight up and down on the board I
think<00:02:51.130> if<00:02:51.430> you<00:02:51.550> change<00:02:51.850> that<00:02:52.060> one<00:02:52.330> thing<00:02:52.690> in

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
think if you change that one thing in

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.530 
think if you change that one thing in
the<00:02:52.959> foot<00:02:53.170> position<00:02:53.709> and<00:02:53.920> then<00:02:54.459> practice<00:02:54.760> just

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
the foot position and then practice just

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.030 
the foot position and then practice just
flipping<00:02:55.930> the<00:02:55.959> board<00:02:56.230> while<00:02:56.500> stepping<00:02:56.920> off

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
flipping the board while stepping off

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.949 
flipping the board while stepping off
with<00:02:57.220> your<00:02:57.340> back<00:02:57.580> foot<00:02:57.819> that<00:02:58.630> you're<00:02:58.810> gonna

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
with your back foot that you're gonna

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:02.640 
with your back foot that you're gonna
get<00:02:59.170> this<00:02:59.380> trick<00:02:59.680> down<00:03:00.750> this<00:03:01.750> is<00:03:02.019> a<00:03:02.050> little<00:03:02.500> bit

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
get this trick down this is a little bit

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.350 
get this trick down this is a little bit
more<00:03:02.830> of<00:03:02.950> a<00:03:03.010> difficult<00:03:03.489> trick<00:03:03.730> but<00:03:04.060> once<00:03:04.239> you

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
more of a difficult trick but once you
