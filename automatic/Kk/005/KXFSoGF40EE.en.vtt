expensive to operate the fuel would be

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.760 
expensive to operate the fuel would be
about<00:01:28.880> a<00:01:28.940> third<00:01:29.390> of<00:01:29.660> a<00:01:29.720> conventional<00:01:30.319> vessel

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
about a third of a conventional vessel

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:32.800 
about a third of a conventional vessel
and<00:01:30.979> also<00:01:31.670> you<00:01:31.729> could<00:01:32.030> have<00:01:32.179> a<00:01:32.240> reduction<00:01:32.720> in

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
and also you could have a reduction in

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:34.419 
and also you could have a reduction in
the<00:01:32.929> number<00:01:32.959> of<00:01:33.289> crew<00:01:33.590> so<00:01:34.069> it's<00:01:34.250> all<00:01:34.399> about

00:01:34.419 --> 00:01:34.429 
the number of crew so it's all about

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:36.490 
the number of crew so it's all about
cost<00:01:34.910> savings<00:01:35.030> but<00:01:35.720> many<00:01:35.929> Islanders<00:01:36.470> say

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
cost savings but many Islanders say

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:44.650 
the technology been used in salt water I
think<00:01:43.640> they're<00:01:43.759> trying<00:01:44.000> to<00:01:44.060> use<00:01:44.300> what<00:01:44.569> is

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:44.660 
think they're trying to use what is

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:47.589 
think they're trying to use what is
essentially<00:01:45.170> a<00:01:45.200> lake<00:01:45.500> system<00:01:45.800> on<00:01:46.599> ocean
