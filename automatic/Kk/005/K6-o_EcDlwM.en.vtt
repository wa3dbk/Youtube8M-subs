00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.140
 drones and I have the dragonfire engine 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:46.420

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:50.440
 game on a 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:52.749
 so the first tree and I had this may 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:55.719
 most of all 

00:00:52.749 --> 00:00:57.100
 oh sniper however 

00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:58.960
 you almost never see man or here 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.629
 these gas directories always on top of it 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:04.180
 always launches thing 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:06.370
 come up with an original as a man so that 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.510
 you are said to be sharpeners 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:09.640
 week somewhere and then you have these mats 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:13.799
 if it is then it is up to this directory itself 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.799
 and you are the many snipers on this folder 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:18.610

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.180
 to reload 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:30.400
 I had forgotten that I didn't have any 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:33.430
 dead leaf foil 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:35.729
 in other words, reloading is simply slow again 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:37.900
 you may have performed your weapon 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.380
 but reloading then is not really possible 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.380

 last time i liked it 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:14.790
