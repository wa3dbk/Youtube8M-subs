and<00:00:43.920> I<00:00:43.980> think<00:00:44.280> it's<00:00:44.489> from<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.390> video<00:00:45.960> itself

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:46.940

thing probably hahaha and at the end of
this<00:01:48.180> video<00:01:48.479> this<00:01:49.140> will<00:01:49.530> be<00:01:49.770> playing<00:01:50.430> at

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
this video this will be playing at

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.310 
this video this will be playing at
another<00:01:51.869> fifty<00:01:52.439> percent<00:01:52.829> reduction<00:01:53.100> in<00:01:53.670> speed

another fifty percent reduction in speed

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.200 
another fifty percent reduction in speed
just<00:01:55.320> because<00:01:55.649> I<00:01:55.680> usually<00:01:56.130> talk<00:01:56.399> too<00:01:56.700> long<00:01:56.939> and

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
just because I usually talk too long and

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.990 
just because I usually talk too long and
I<00:01:57.240> thought<00:01:57.450> we<00:01:57.630> might<00:01:57.840> need<00:01:58.020> the<00:01:58.200> room<00:01:59.000> now

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
I thought we might need the room now

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.389 
I thought we might need the room now
here<00:02:00.390> we<00:02:00.540> have<00:02:00.659> the<00:02:00.810> maxwellian<00:02:01.380> traps<00:02:02.040> which

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
here we have the maxwellian traps which

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:05.359 
here we have the maxwellian traps which
I<00:02:02.549> demonstrated<00:02:03.360> in<00:02:03.540> Lua<00:02:03.810> and<00:02:04.200> there's<00:02:05.159> some

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
I demonstrated in Lua and there's some

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.850 
I demonstrated in Lua and there's some
trees<00:02:06.000> coming<00:02:06.360> up<00:02:06.570> the<00:02:06.719> marble<00:02:07.170> trees<00:02:07.530> as<00:02:07.740> I

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
trees coming up the marble trees as I

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.550 
trees coming up the marble trees as I
demonstrated<00:02:08.550> in<00:02:08.849> Lua<00:02:09.410> video

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
demonstrated in Lua video

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.270

as<00:02:10.619> I<00:02:10.770> did<00:02:11.009> are<00:02:11.599> also<00:02:12.599> here<00:02:13.140> now<00:02:14.040> those

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
as I did are also here now those

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.750 
as I did are also here now those
rectangular<00:02:15.209> looking<00:02:15.810> ones<00:02:16.050> are<00:02:16.440> marble<00:02:17.400> and

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
rectangular looking ones are marble and

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.479 
rectangular looking ones are marble and
you<00:02:17.849> can<00:02:18.030> mine<00:02:18.270> them<00:02:18.450> for<00:02:18.660> marble<00:02:19.160> but<00:02:20.160> why<00:02:20.430> you

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
you can mine them for marble but why you

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:22.880 
you can mine them for marble but why you
would<00:02:20.849> be<00:02:21.000> in<00:02:21.120> this<00:02:21.270> part<00:02:21.569> of<00:02:21.660> the<00:02:21.720> bio<00:02:22.020> mining

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
would be in this part of the bio mining

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:28.370 
would be in this part of the bio mining
I<00:02:23.130> don't<00:02:23.520> know<00:02:25.940> so<00:02:26.940> these<00:02:27.150> are<00:02:27.209> not<00:02:27.599> new<00:02:27.900> trees

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
I don't know so these are not new trees

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.009 

so<00:03:07.560> they're<00:03:07.739> just<00:03:08.000> pimping<00:03:09.000> the<00:03:09.150> companies

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
so they're just pimping the companies

so they're just pimping the companies
are<00:03:10.260> supporting<00:03:10.950> them<00:03:11.099> or<00:03:11.280> whatever<00:03:11.459> the<00:03:11.760> hell

00:03:11.869 --> 00:03:11.879

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:13.670 
are supporting them or whatever the hell
I<00:03:12.030> don't<00:03:12.090> know<00:03:12.299> how<00:03:12.450> all<00:03:12.659> that<00:03:12.780> works<00:03:13.049> out<00:03:13.349> back

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
I don't know how all that works out back

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.910 
I don't know how all that works out back
and<00:03:13.860> forth<00:03:15.260> somebody's<00:03:16.260> scratching

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
and forth somebody's scratching

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
and forth somebody's scratching
somebody's<00:03:17.430> behind<00:03:17.750> arriving<00:03:18.750> back<00:03:18.959> I<00:03:25.940> did

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
somebody's behind arriving back I did

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.449 
somebody's behind arriving back I did
now<00:03:27.150> i<00:03:27.180> believe<00:03:27.720> we<00:03:27.900> go<00:03:28.080> down<00:03:28.319> to<00:03:28.560> the<00:03:28.590> slowdown

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
now i believe we go down to the slowdown

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:31.339 
now i believe we go down to the slowdown
up<00:03:29.790> to<00:03:30.030> the<00:03:30.150> slow<00:03:30.450> down<00:03:30.720> version<00:03:31.230> of<00:03:31.319> that

00:03:31.339 --> 00:03:31.349 
up to the slow down version of that

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:37.430 
up to the slow down version of that
little<00:03:31.739> Rumble<00:03:32.160> it<00:03:32.310> was<00:03:32.430> going<00:03:32.790> up<00:03:35.989> ok<00:03:36.989> this<00:03:37.200> is

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
little Rumble it was going up ok this is

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.039 
little Rumble it was going up ok this is
this<00:03:37.650> little<00:03:38.010> Rumble<00:03:38.579> out<00:03:38.790> here<00:03:39.239> slowed<00:03:39.780> down

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:40.049 
this little Rumble out here slowed down

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:43.550 
this little Rumble out here slowed down
another<00:03:40.470> fifty<00:03:41.010> percent<00:03:41.959> just<00:03:42.959> for<00:03:43.170> the<00:03:43.290> sake

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
another fifty percent just for the sake

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.110 
another fifty percent just for the sake
of<00:03:43.590> doing<00:03:43.980> it<00:03:44.310> I<00:03:44.400> thought<00:03:44.609> it<00:03:44.730> might<00:03:44.760> be

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
of doing it I thought it might be

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.990 
of doing it I thought it might be
entertaining<00:03:45.629> in<00:03:45.959> the<00:03:46.370> thing<00:03:47.370> with<00:03:47.609> the<00:03:47.730> chess

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
entertaining in the thing with the chess

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.270 
entertaining in the thing with the chess
pieces<00:03:48.030> this<00:03:48.599> is<00:03:48.720> also<00:03:49.200> coming<00:03:49.470> up<00:03:49.739> slowed

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
pieces this is also coming up slowed

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.410 
pieces this is also coming up slowed
another<00:03:50.849> fifty<00:03:51.329> percent<00:03:52.609> so<00:03:53.609> both<00:03:53.879> those<00:03:54.209> will

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
another fifty percent so both those will

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.900 
another fifty percent so both those will
be<00:03:54.450> at<00:03:54.690> one-quarter<00:03:55.319> speed<00:03:55.859> at<00:03:56.190> this<00:03:56.400> point<00:03:56.760> in

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
be at one-quarter speed at this point in

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:01.130 
be at one-quarter speed at this point in

jump for their sleeve and are also
committed<00:05:23.260> to<00:05:23.730> updates<00:05:24.730> every<00:05:25.000> two<00:05:25.360> weeks<00:05:25.660> for

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:25.810 
committed to updates every two weeks for

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:30.660 
committed to updates every two weeks for
six<00:05:26.170> months<00:05:26.740> and<00:05:27.810> I<00:05:29.310> imagine<00:05:30.310> if<00:05:30.430> somebody

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:30.670 
six months and I imagine if somebody

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:32.730 
six months and I imagine if somebody
gave<00:05:31.120> them<00:05:31.330> the<00:05:31.450> money<00:05:31.630> they<00:05:31.810> keep<00:05:32.200> on<00:05:32.410> doing

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:32.740 
gave them the money they keep on doing

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:34.710 
gave them the money they keep on doing
updates<00:05:33.190> so<00:05:33.490> we'll<00:05:33.640> see<00:05:33.850> how<00:05:33.880> that<00:05:34.030> works<00:05:34.270> out

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:34.720 
updates so we'll see how that works out

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:39.480 
updates so we'll see how that works out
after<00:05:35.200> the<00:05:35.320> six<00:05:35.590> months<00:05:38.010> now<00:05:39.010> I<00:05:39.040> didn't<00:05:39.370> notice

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:39.490 
after the six months now I didn't notice

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:41.490 
after the six months now I didn't notice
the<00:05:39.760> first<00:05:40.030> time<00:05:40.300> there<00:05:40.510> is<00:05:40.600> that<00:05:40.630> spider<00:05:41.230> egg

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:41.500 
the first time there is that spider egg

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:43.950 
the first time there is that spider egg
there<00:05:41.800> so<00:05:42.070> this<00:05:42.250> is<00:05:42.460> going<00:05:42.730> to<00:05:42.790> be<00:05:42.970> some<00:05:43.600> really

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:43.960 
there so this is going to be some really

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:47.580 
there so this is going to be some really
busy<00:05:44.170> stuff<00:05:45.240> it<00:05:46.240> will<00:05:46.390> put<00:05:46.630> the<00:05:46.750> adventurer<00:05:47.410> at

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:47.590 
busy stuff it will put the adventurer at

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:50.160 
busy stuff it will put the adventurer at
the<00:05:47.710> higher<00:05:47.890> levels<00:05:48.370> of<00:05:48.550> adventure<00:05:49.120> and<00:05:49.360> it

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:50.170 
the higher levels of adventure and it

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:53.730 
the higher levels of adventure and it
may<00:05:50.350> be<00:05:50.410> just<00:05:50.740> as<00:05:50.980> well<00:05:51.190> Matt<00:05:52.380> Wolfgang<00:05:53.380> didn't

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:53.740 
may be just as well Matt Wolfgang didn't

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:55.500 
may be just as well Matt Wolfgang didn't
get<00:05:53.890> any<00:05:54.100> further<00:05:54.310> than<00:05:54.610> he<00:05:54.700> did<00:05:54.910> since<00:05:55.300> all

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:55.510 
get any further than he did since all

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:58.080 
get any further than he did since all
this<00:05:55.660> will<00:05:55.900> be<00:05:56.020> ahead<00:05:56.140> of<00:05:56.350> it<00:05:56.560> now<00:05:56.800> or<00:05:57.790> I<00:05:57.850> hope

00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:58.090 
this will be ahead of it now or I hope

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:02.340 
this will be ahead of it now or I hope
it<00:05:58.300> will<00:05:58.480> I<00:06:00.180> assume<00:06:01.180> he<00:06:01.420> can<00:06:01.630> go<00:06:01.810> through<00:06:02.140> his

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:02.350 
it will I assume he can go through his

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:05.870 
it will I assume he can go through his
teleport<00:06:03.100> Otto's<00:06:03.520> and<00:06:03.760> reach<00:06:03.940> this<00:06:04.180> stuff<00:06:04.510> I

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:05.880 
teleport Otto's and reach this stuff I

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:08.850 
teleport Otto's and reach this stuff I

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:26.410 
to the thread that i'm seeing that seems

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:28.410 
to the thread that i'm seeing that seems
to<00:06:26.620> be<00:06:26.680> the<00:06:26.770> main<00:06:27.070> thread<00:06:27.550> and<00:06:27.700> forms<00:06:28.150> right

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:28.420 
to be the main thread and forms right

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:31.230 
to be the main thread and forms right
now<00:06:28.660> but<00:06:28.960> there's<00:06:29.170> not<00:06:29.950> actually<00:06:30.250> much<00:06:30.820> on<00:06:31.120> it

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:31.240 
now but there's not actually much on it

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:33.360 
now but there's not actually much on it
because<00:06:31.510> there's<00:06:31.750> not<00:06:31.900> much<00:06:32.230> in<00:06:32.500> this<00:06:32.980> it's

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:33.370 
because there's not much in this it's

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:37.050 
because there's not much in this it's
just<00:06:33.700> a<00:06:34.770> lot<00:06:35.770> of<00:06:35.800> it's<00:06:36.100> been<00:06:36.310> dug<00:06:36.610> out<00:06:36.820> of<00:06:36.970> the

just a lot of it's been dug out of the

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:39.450 
just a lot of it's been dug out of the
little<00:06:37.300> code<00:06:37.630> by<00:06:37.870> people<00:06:38.350> and<00:06:38.770> they'll<00:06:38.950> be<00:06:39.160> I

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:39.460 
little code by people and they'll be I

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:41.850 
little code by people and they'll be I
won't<00:06:40.420> put<00:06:40.630> a<00:06:40.660> link<00:06:40.990> up<00:06:41.200> but<00:06:41.440> if<00:06:41.530> you<00:06:41.620> go<00:06:41.800> to

won't put a link up but if you go to

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:43.830 
won't put a link up but if you go to
forums<00:06:42.370> there<00:06:42.580> will<00:06:42.670> be<00:06:42.760> puzzle<00:06:43.270> links<00:06:43.660> where

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:43.840 
forums there will be puzzle links where

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:45.300 
forums there will be puzzle links where
people<00:06:44.170> are<00:06:44.260> trying<00:06:44.470> to<00:06:44.620> figure<00:06:44.770> out<00:06:44.920> what<00:06:45.130> all

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:45.310 
people are trying to figure out what all

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:49.500 
people are trying to figure out what all
those<00:06:45.490> flashes<00:06:46.150> fit<00:06:46.390> together<00:06:46.720> to<00:06:46.990> be<00:06:47.190> so<00:06:48.510> but

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:49.510 
those flashes fit together to be so but

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:52.770 
those flashes fit together to be so but
I<00:06:49.600> figure<00:06:49.900> you<00:06:49.990> can<00:06:50.140> probably<00:06:50.530> find<00:06:50.770> those<00:06:51.780> so

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:52.780 
I figure you can probably find those so

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:54.810 
I figure you can probably find those so
anyway<00:06:53.140> y'all<00:06:53.380> take<00:06:53.680> care<00:06:53.710> of<00:06:54.010> yourselves<00:06:54.130> and

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:54.820 
anyway y'all take care of yourselves and

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:57.930 
anyway y'all take care of yourselves and
I'll<00:06:55.360> be<00:06:55.690> back<00:06:55.930> with<00:06:56.260> more<00:06:56.920> of<00:06:56.980> my<00:06:57.190> kind<00:06:57.790> of

00:06:57.930 --> 00:06:57.940 
I'll be back with more of my kind of

00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:01.230 
I'll be back with more of my kind of
adventures<00:06:58.540> and<00:06:59.460> hopefully<00:07:00.460> Wolfgang<00:07:01.000> will

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:01.240 
adventures and hopefully Wolfgang will

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:03.630 
adventures and hopefully Wolfgang will
live<00:07:01.930> long<00:07:02.260> enough<00:07:02.500> to<00:07:02.650> reach<00:07:03.040> some<00:07:03.370> of<00:07:03.520> this

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:03.640 
live long enough to reach some of this

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:06.690 
live long enough to reach some of this
stuff<00:07:03.940> in<00:07:04.180> the<00:07:04.270> future
