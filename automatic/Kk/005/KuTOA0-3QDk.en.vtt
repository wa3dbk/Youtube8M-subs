 It's time to make the most of your income and reduce 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:14.739
 minimum preventable expenses 

00:00:14.739 --> 00:00:18.339
 until a few years ago the phenomenon of raising the bet was associated with 

00:00:18.339 --> 00:00:20.029
 certain annual moments 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:23.289

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:27.170
 of the price of food from mortgages or the cost of oil 

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:31.160
 numerous domestic economies must rise by the economic bet 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:33.909

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.680
 instead of overwhelming the family consumption experts recommend applying a 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:46.060
 series of basic ideas to stretch income and be able to make ends meet without 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:47.690
 feeling of suffocation

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:04.670
 income 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.130
 the so-called plastic money is very comfortable fast and tempting but also 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.660
 increases the risk of overspending because the consumer does not become aware 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:18.040
 of spending money and can also become a means of indebtedness 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.150

 consumers we advise against insuring a car at all risk when its 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.480
