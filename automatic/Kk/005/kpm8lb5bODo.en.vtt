talk about how much cuttings I get off
of<00:00:05.880> my<00:00:06.880> plants<00:00:07.450> and<00:00:07.660> all<00:00:07.990> that<00:00:08.230> other<00:00:08.320> nonsense

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:08.440 
of my plants and all that other nonsense

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:11.190

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.470 
but I hardly ever show you exactly what
that<00:00:11.230> equates<00:00:11.710> to<00:00:11.830> in<00:00:12.070> volume<00:00:12.460> so<00:00:12.730> for<00:00:13.389> this

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:13.480 
that equates to in volume so for this

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:14.940 
that equates to in volume so for this
particular<00:00:13.690> video<00:00:14.139> I'm<00:00:14.440> going<00:00:14.559> to<00:00:14.650> spend<00:00:14.860> a

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:14.950

harvest one of these things will
actually<00:00:24.789> give<00:00:25.149> you<00:00:25.300> so<00:00:26.259> what<00:00:26.619> I've<00:00:26.769> got<00:00:26.800> is<00:00:27.189> a

actually give you so what I've got is a

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:33.120 
actually give you so what I've got is a
standard<00:00:28.810> Tupperware<00:00:29.319> container<00:00:31.500> and<00:00:32.500> I'm

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:33.130 
standard Tupperware container and I'm

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:34.920 
standard Tupperware container and I'm
simply<00:00:33.490> going<00:00:33.610> to<00:00:33.790> nestle<00:00:34.420> that<00:00:34.600> someplace

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:34.930 
simply going to nestle that someplace

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:38.040 
simply going to nestle that someplace
where<00:00:35.350> it's<00:00:35.470> convenient<00:00:35.890> and<00:00:36.810> start<00:00:37.810> cutting

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:38.050 
where it's convenient and start cutting

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:40.170 
where it's convenient and start cutting
away<00:00:38.290> I'm<00:00:39.250> going<00:00:39.460> to<00:00:39.520> go<00:00:39.580> after<00:00:39.700> the<00:00:39.970> oregano

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:40.180 
away I'm going to go after the oregano

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:41.850 
away I'm going to go after the oregano
because<00:00:40.480> the<00:00:40.570> oregano<00:00:40.720> was<00:00:40.990> really<00:00:41.380> overgrown

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:41.860 
because the oregano was really overgrown

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:44.430 
because the oregano was really overgrown
and<00:00:42.360> again<00:00:43.360> you<00:00:43.540> can<00:00:43.720> once<00:00:43.930> you<00:00:44.020> cut<00:00:44.290> these

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:44.440 
and again you can once you cut these

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.100 
and again you can once you cut these
down<00:00:44.770> you<00:00:45.240> can<00:00:46.240> actually<00:00:46.450> just<00:00:46.750> put<00:00:46.960> these

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:47.110 
down you can actually just put these

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:48.810 
down you can actually just put these
hang<00:00:47.410> these<00:00:47.590> up<00:00:47.620> somewhere<00:00:48.160> and<00:00:48.370> dry<00:00:48.550> them<00:00:48.730> out

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:48.820 
hang these up somewhere and dry them out

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.990 
hang these up somewhere and dry them out
and<00:00:49.090> they<00:00:49.390> will<00:00:49.740> absolutely<00:00:50.740> positively<00:00:51.610> last

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:52.000 
and they will absolutely positively last

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.080 
and they will absolutely positively last
you<00:00:52.210> forever<00:00:52.860> if<00:00:53.860> you<00:00:54.040> like<00:00:54.220> trite<00:00:54.490> oregano<00:00:54.910> in

00:01:08.429 --> 00:01:08.439 
have frayed at the edges I didn't do a

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:09.859 
have frayed at the edges I didn't do a
very<00:01:08.649> good<00:01:08.710> job<00:01:08.920> of<00:01:08.979> filling<00:01:09.280> them<00:01:09.520> I'm<00:01:09.640> afraid

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
very good job of filling them I'm afraid

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.330 
very good job of filling them I'm afraid
but<00:01:10.869> nonetheless<00:01:11.499> they're<00:01:11.979> easy<00:01:12.100> enough<00:01:12.189> just

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:12.340 
but nonetheless they're easy enough just

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.209 
but nonetheless they're easy enough just
to<00:01:12.549> take<00:01:12.700> out<00:01:13.350> so<00:01:14.350> I<00:01:14.380> am<00:01:14.710> going<00:01:14.859> to<00:01:14.950> probably

00:01:15.209 --> 00:01:15.219 
to take out so I am going to probably

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:19.770 
to take out so I am going to probably
yield<00:01:15.759> about<00:01:15.939> 4<00:01:16.929> cups<00:01:17.350> of<00:01:17.999> oregano<00:01:18.999> out<00:01:19.450> of

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780 
yield about 4 cups of oregano out of

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.599 
yield about 4 cups of oregano out of
this<00:01:19.960> particular<00:01:20.259> group<00:01:20.770> of<00:01:20.979> clippers<00:01:21.219> which

00:01:21.599 --> 00:01:21.609 
this particular group of clippers which

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:23.580 
this particular group of clippers which
the<00:01:22.299> predominance<00:01:22.869> of<00:01:22.990> it<00:01:23.109> I'm<00:01:23.200> going<00:01:23.380> to<00:01:23.469> end

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:23.590 
the predominance of it I'm going to end

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:25.109 
the predominance of it I'm going to end
up<00:01:23.679> giving<00:01:23.829> away<00:01:24.159> because<00:01:24.490> there's<00:01:24.700> no<00:01:24.969> way

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:25.119 
up giving away because there's no way

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:27.450 
up giving away because there's no way
I'm<00:01:25.210> going<00:01:25.329> to<00:01:25.420> use<00:01:25.740> four<00:01:26.740> cups<00:01:27.009> of<00:01:27.159> oregano

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:27.460 
I'm going to use four cups of oregano

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.870 
I'm going to use four cups of oregano
anytime<00:01:28.240> soon<00:01:29.189> but<00:01:30.189> you<00:01:30.369> can<00:01:30.520> just<00:01:30.729> see<00:01:30.850> that

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:30.880 
anytime soon but you can just see that

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.929 
anytime soon but you can just see that
as<00:01:31.209> I'm<00:01:31.389> sniffing<00:01:32.130> I'm<00:01:33.130> literally<00:01:33.700> pulling

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:33.939 
as I'm sniffing I'm literally pulling

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:35.730 
as I'm sniffing I'm literally pulling
off<00:01:34.179> handfuls<00:01:34.719> of<00:01:34.899> it<00:01:35.079> because<00:01:35.319> the<00:01:35.469> plant

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:35.740 
off handfuls of it because the plant

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.239 
off handfuls of it because the plant
really<00:01:36.539> just<00:01:37.539> grows<00:01:37.959> and<00:01:38.350> grows<00:01:38.649> and<00:01:39.159> grows

00:01:39.239 --> 00:01:39.249 
really just grows and grows and grows

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:43.349 
really just grows and grows and grows
and<00:01:39.850> grows<00:01:40.119> and<00:01:40.509> grows<00:01:40.600> and<00:01:41.999> don't<00:01:42.999> keep<00:01:43.179> your

and grows and grows and don't keep your

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:47.010 
and grows and grows and don't keep your
plants<00:01:44.670> reasonably<00:01:45.670> well<00:01:45.850> trimmed<00:01:46.179> then

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 
plants reasonably well trimmed then

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:48.830 
plants reasonably well trimmed then
you're<00:01:47.259> just<00:01:47.380> going<00:01:47.590> to<00:01:47.649> have<00:01:47.799> a<00:01:47.829> big

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
you're just going to have a big

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.620 
you're just going to have a big
intertwine<00:01:49.840> net<00:01:50.740> and<00:01:51.420> that's<00:01:52.420> what<00:01:52.539> I'm

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630 
intertwine net and that's what I'm

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:54.179 
intertwine net and that's what I'm
afraid<00:01:52.749> of<00:01:52.959> with<00:01:53.170> this<00:01:53.319> particular<00:01:53.829> batch<00:01:54.009> of

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:54.189 
afraid of with this particular batch of

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:56.669 
afraid of with this particular batch of
oregano<00:01:54.459> because<00:01:54.909> it's<00:01:55.090> just<00:01:55.329> getting<00:01:55.600> to<00:01:56.560> the

00:01:56.669 --> 00:01:56.679 
oregano because it's just getting to the

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:58.199 
oregano because it's just getting to the
point<00:01:56.709> where<00:01:57.069> I<00:01:57.099> can't<00:01:57.490> keep<00:01:57.819> it<00:01:57.999> under

00:01:58.199 --> 00:01:58.209 
point where I can't keep it under

00:01:58.209 --> 00:02:00.779 
point where I can't keep it under
control<00:01:58.240> anymore<00:01:58.889> it's<00:01:59.889> a<00:02:00.009> very<00:02:00.249> aggressive

00:02:00.779 --> 00:02:00.789 
control anymore it's a very aggressive

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:04.730 
control anymore it's a very aggressive
and<00:02:00.939> a<00:02:00.999> very<00:02:01.179> invasive<00:02:01.719> plant<00:02:02.289> as<00:02:02.499> it<00:02:02.619> is<00:02:03.359> but

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
and a very invasive plant as it is but

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.510 
and a very invasive plant as it is but
particularly<00:02:05.740> when<00:02:05.829> you<00:02:05.920> place<00:02:06.099> it<00:02:06.249> next<00:02:06.369> to

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 
particularly when you place it next to

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.940 
particularly when you place it next to
another<00:02:06.670> oregano<00:02:07.209> plant<00:02:07.509> it<00:02:08.440> tends<00:02:08.710> to<00:02:08.830> get

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
another oregano plant it tends to get

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:10.449 
another oregano plant it tends to get
even<00:02:09.190> more<00:02:09.400> aggressive

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:10.459 
even more aggressive

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:12.130 
even more aggressive
and<00:02:11.060> it<00:02:11.209> tries<00:02:11.390> to<00:02:11.420> take<00:02:11.659> over<00:02:11.959> whatever

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
and it tries to take over whatever

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.020 
and it tries to take over whatever
territory<00:02:12.769> the<00:02:12.920> other<00:02:13.040> the<00:02:13.340> other<00:02:13.400> plant<00:02:13.760> has

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
territory the other the other plant has

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.640 
territory the other the other plant has
so<00:02:15.099> you<00:02:16.099> can't<00:02:16.340> really<00:02:16.519> say<00:02:16.760> that<00:02:17.500> oregano<00:02:18.500> is

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
so you can't really say that oregano is

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:19.990 
so you can't really say that oregano is
not<00:02:18.859> something<00:02:19.250> that<00:02:19.310> has<00:02:19.489> a<00:02:19.519> thinking

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
not something that has a thinking

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.099 
not something that has a thinking
mentality<00:02:20.510> about<00:02:20.810> it<00:02:20.959> it's<00:02:21.079> very<00:02:21.280> very<00:02:22.280> very

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:23.109 
mentality about it it's very very very

00:02:23.109 --> 00:02:26.259 
mentality about it it's very very very
aggressive<00:02:24.280> so<00:02:25.280> this<00:02:25.640> may<00:02:25.819> look<00:02:26.000> like<00:02:26.090> I'm

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:26.269 
aggressive so this may look like I'm

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:29.140 
aggressive so this may look like I'm
cutting<00:02:26.569> off<00:02:26.750> a<00:02:26.780> lot<00:02:27.079> but<00:02:27.950> one<00:02:28.639> thing<00:02:28.819> I<00:02:28.939> can

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
cutting off a lot but one thing I can

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.509 
cutting off a lot but one thing I can
tell<00:02:29.180> you<00:02:29.359> is<00:02:29.750> that<00:02:29.829> this<00:02:30.829> will<00:02:31.040> grow<00:02:31.219> back

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:31.519 
tell you is that this will grow back

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:34.770 
tell you is that this will grow back
literally<00:02:32.090> in<00:02:32.629> about<00:02:32.750> a<00:02:32.930> week<00:02:33.109> and<00:02:33.260> a<00:02:33.319> half<00:02:33.349> so

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
literally in about a week and a half so

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.089 
literally in about a week and a half so
obviously<00:02:35.780> look<00:02:35.959> like<00:02:35.989> a<00:02:36.139> lot<00:02:36.379> it<00:02:36.709> really<00:02:37.010> is

00:02:37.089 --> 00:02:37.099 
obviously look like a lot it really is

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:39.699 
obviously look like a lot it really is
not<00:02:37.280> so<00:02:37.689> here's<00:02:38.689> the<00:02:38.840> quantity<00:02:39.260> that<00:02:39.379> I've<00:02:39.500> cut

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709 
not so here's the quantity that I've cut

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:44.110 
not so here's the quantity that I've cut
off<00:02:40.540> that's<00:02:41.540> full<00:02:42.010> that<00:02:43.010> will<00:02:43.280> probably<00:02:43.879> dry

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
off that's full that will probably dry

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.849 
off that's full that will probably dry
out<00:02:44.299> to<00:02:44.480> be<00:02:44.599> about<00:02:44.780> a<00:02:44.840> third<00:02:45.169> of<00:02:45.260> that<00:02:45.319> and<00:02:45.739> that

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:45.859 
out to be about a third of that and that

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:48.399 
out to be about a third of that and that
literally<00:02:46.189> for<00:02:46.549> almost<00:02:46.760> nothing<00:02:47.030> is<00:02:47.450> the

00:02:48.399 --> 00:02:48.409 
literally for almost nothing is the

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:52.179 
literally for almost nothing is the
entire<00:02:49.220> volume<00:02:49.579> of<00:02:49.849> a<00:02:49.970> bag<00:02:50.180> of<00:02:50.480> a<00:02:50.659> bag<00:02:51.620> or<00:02:51.829> a<00:02:51.889> jar

00:02:52.179 --> 00:02:52.189 
entire volume of a bag of a bag or a jar

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:55.420 
entire volume of a bag of a bag or a jar
of<00:02:53.290> oregano<00:02:54.290> that<00:02:54.319> you<00:02:54.530> buy<00:02:54.650> in<00:02:54.799> the<00:02:54.829> store<00:02:54.950> so

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
of oregano that you buy in the store so

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.159 
of oregano that you buy in the store so
I'm<00:02:55.609> going<00:02:55.760> to<00:02:55.819> wait<00:02:55.909> to<00:02:56.030> dry<00:02:56.209> this<00:02:56.389> out<00:02:56.569> then

00:02:57.159 --> 00:02:57.169 
I'm going to wait to dry this out then

00:02:57.169 --> 00:02:58.479 
I'm going to wait to dry this out then
