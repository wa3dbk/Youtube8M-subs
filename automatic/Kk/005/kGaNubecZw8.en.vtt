 the hand probably knows you 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.490
 from the basic principle of the past 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:26.439
 months out that is ours 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:29.410

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:30.939
 give them the windows streak-free 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:33.070

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:34.480
 have been with pleasant things of the 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:35.890
 to occupy life 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.360
 the reason why but just one 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:39.670
 breaking news broadcast for you 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.800
 be prepared is the consistent 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:45.010
 further development of our original 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.870
 sure window cleaner robots for us 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.850
 We have heard from our customers often 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.380
 that just the first model from the 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.720
 first generation of the 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:54.880
 noise development sometimes a bit too 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:56.079
 was loud and that 's why ours have 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:58.510
 technician there again something 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:00.610
 touched up and actually have here 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.410
 according to the latest findings again 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:03.989
 something improved so one 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:07.719
 improved so-called company 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:10.509
 applied this is the version 2 with 

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:13.270
 state-of-the-art technology and that means 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:15.280
 the device is now much quieter in the 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.930
 normal use with it so times 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.850
 See what that can look like if there is one 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:21.310
 Window cleaner robots her disc 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.659
 streak free cleans off while they are 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.150
 with more pleasant things in life 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:26.770
 For example, you employ beautiful ones 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:28.119
 telephone conversation with the girlfriend or 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.260
 maybe even a delicious cup 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:31.240
 coffee and a look in it 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.530
 I would like to give them all that 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.240
 like to show it 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.610
 the bang at our window 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.990
 cleaning robot is the point that we are here 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.460
 also with a double or with 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.990
 a triple glazed pane 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.030
 can work because the device works 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.920
 with negative pressure and not with one 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.020
 magnet is just it 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.159
 set and in the lower part 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.770
 turned on and then comes almost the 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:52.810
 supplied remote control to wear 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:55.240
 You have three different cleaning 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.039
 Modes for different window sizes 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.079
 but quite honestly a whole 

00:01:57.039 --> 00:02:00.820
 simple standard program ranges in the 

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:03.219
 rule out already around the slices 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:05.140
 reliable to clean and how that 

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:06.969
 I would like to see them here completely 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.340
 like to show a little hint 

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:10.660
 my personal experience 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.519
 just spray the one side something 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:15.190
 damp and leave the second 

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:16.989
 Just dry then know 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.000
 Namely on the one hand on the 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:21.160
 dry on the other side 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.980
 please look at how reliable 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.840
 not only about his sensors here 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.880
 Obstacles in the case, of course, the 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.040
 window frame recognizes but also 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:32.260
 reliable here the pollution of the 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.299
 it cleans up and that's what he does 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.739
 long until the sensors no 

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:36.610
 Dirt more on the disc 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:38.590
 recognize 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.780
 then a small signal sounds and that 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:43.000
 everything is finished 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.799
 then you have to make the window cleaner 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.599
 robot again from the disc down to 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:47.260
 Take it and go back to the cupboard 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:49.540
 clear 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:52.079
 you can hear it sometimes even a little closer 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:54.760
 with my microphone to the device off 

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:56.709
 we are from the noise development 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.350
 now here at the level of a whole 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:00.910
 normal conversation at room volume 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:02.769
 and that's why the device is natural 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:04.950
 now here by the consistent 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:07.470
 further development of the firmware 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:10.090
 actually perfect for home use 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.290
 suitable now he defends here the whole 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.090
 time down here I can, of course 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:15.100
 sometimes go upstairs when I do that 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:17.560
 would like to either use the remote 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:19.959
 or anytime, of course, over 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.489
 the corresponding cleaning programs 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:22.810
 I think it's great to see us now 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:25.540
 so really reliable in the 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:27.519
 lower part here the window frame 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.530
 with selection not that means dripping 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:31.900
 on the bright carpet you can 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.250
 with it simply forgetting 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.620
 dear spectators, of course you will get it 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:38.079
 from our side a complete set 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:40.780
 at home and included in this set 

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:43.180
 is of course the window cleaner robot 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:45.160
 on the one hand the remote control 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.620
 will of course be delivered with us but we 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:50.620
 yes have twelve times this microfiber 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:52.180
 containing patch for them in the scope of supply 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:54.099
 that means they always can 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:55.599
 with large windows or sometimes 

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:57.250
 with smooth surfaces on mine 

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:59.320
 Shower cabin for example or the 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:01.180
 Tile mirror in the bathroom always 

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:02.950
 use several towels 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:04.510
 and can the second set completely 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:06.219
 just look in the washing machine 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:08.260
 clean if they are dirty 

00:04:06.219 --> 00:04:09.700
 simply the next with this the 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.170
 is very simple i can give them that 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.829
 here on the other model again 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:13.810
 demonstrate 

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:15.430
 So there is no factory tool 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:18.310
 to use one simply takes the pads 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:20.769
 down and pull a new back on it 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:23.100
 a perfect device it is a whole 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:25.660
 clear luxury for me if you are here 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:27.970
 clear a significant time advantage 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:30.280
 in the leisure time has to take over here 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:32.979
