00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:38.019 
know that doesn't even run on the

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:39.629 
know that doesn't even run on the
original<00:03:38.380> iPad<00:03:38.739> it<00:03:38.919> was<00:03:39.040> a<00:03:39.220> little<00:03:39.430> too

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:39.639 
original iPad it was a little too

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:41.759 
original iPad it was a little too
sluggish<00:03:39.940> some<00:03:40.660> people<00:03:40.959> have<00:03:41.079> hacked<00:03:41.290> it<00:03:41.500> so

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:41.769 
sluggish some people have hacked it so

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:43.559 
sluggish some people have hacked it so
it<00:03:41.829> could<00:03:41.980> work<00:03:42.130> but<00:03:42.160> it<00:03:42.489> shows<00:03:43.150> that<00:03:43.180> without

00:03:43.559 --> 00:03:43.569 
it could work but it shows that without

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:47.909 
it could work but it shows that without
the<00:03:43.840> a5<00:03:44.200> processor<00:03:44.440> it<00:03:45.040> is<00:03:45.160> pretty<00:03:45.400> slow<00:03:46.919> so

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:47.919 
the a5 processor it is pretty slow so

00:03:47.919 --> 00:03:50.400 
the a5 processor it is pretty slow so
that's<00:03:48.669> basically<00:03:48.880> it<00:03:49.299> that's<00:03:49.870> all<00:03:50.049> I<00:03:50.079> wanted

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 
that's basically it that's all I wanted

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:53.069 
that's basically it that's all I wanted
to<00:03:50.530> show<00:03:50.709> you<00:03:50.970> it<00:03:51.970> does<00:03:52.209> work<00:03:52.480> you<00:03:52.690> can<00:03:52.870> put

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:53.079 
to show you it does work you can put

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:54.240 
to show you it does work you can put
anything<00:03:53.319> up<00:03:53.590> there<00:03:53.769> you<00:03:53.889> can<00:03:54.040> put<00:03:54.160> your
