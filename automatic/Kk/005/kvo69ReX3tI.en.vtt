00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
will need a triangle arch circle and the

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.890 
will need a triangle arch circle and the
second<00:00:25.050> lieutenant<00:00:25.670> so<00:00:26.670> first<00:00:27.150> you<00:00:27.539> want<00:00:27.779> to

second lieutenant so first you want to
start<00:00:28.019> with<00:00:28.529> a<00:00:28.800> triangle<00:00:29.519> make<00:00:30.029> up<00:00:30.150> the

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210

you<00:00:34.559> will<00:00:34.710> get<00:00:34.860> another<00:00:35.219> triangle<00:00:36.020> skinny

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
you will get another triangle skinny

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.680 
you will get another triangle skinny
whatever<00:00:39.559> this<00:00:40.559> one's<00:00:40.860> all<00:00:41.430> your<00:00:41.760> preference

and all that but if you just follow my

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.250 
and all that but if you just follow my

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
general direction then you will have

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.410 
general direction then you will have
something<00:00:49.739> that<00:00:49.920> looks<00:00:50.579> kind<00:00:50.940> of<00:00:51.120> like<00:00:51.300> the

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:53.420 
something that looks kind of like the

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:58.310 
something that looks kind of like the
logo<00:00:56.059> so<00:00:57.059> right<00:00:57.239> here<00:00:57.510> you<00:00:57.840> just<00:00:58.020> use<00:00:58.230> the

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
logo so right here you just use the

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.709 
logo so right here you just use the
second<00:00:58.649> lieutenant<00:00:59.160> make<00:00:59.910> it<00:01:00.059> all<00:01:00.180> skinny<00:01:00.600> and

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
second lieutenant make it all skinny and

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.520 
second lieutenant make it all skinny and
stuff<00:01:02.300> mega<00:01:03.300> into<00:01:03.570> an<00:01:03.629> ass<00:01:03.780> look<00:01:04.290> like<00:01:04.320> a

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
stuff mega into an ass look like a

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:10.429 
stuff mega into an ass look like a
dollar<00:01:05.189> sign<00:01:05.519> at<00:01:05.760> least<00:01:08.180> see<00:01:09.180> but<00:01:09.439> those

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
dollar sign at least see but those

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.230 
dollar sign at least see but those
triangles<00:01:11.130> you<00:01:11.310> can<00:01:11.340> tell<00:01:11.670> there's<00:01:11.939> a<00:01:12.000> big

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
triangles you can tell there's a big

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.240 
triangles you can tell there's a big
difference<00:01:12.479> in<00:01:12.840> between<00:01:12.990> them<00:01:13.350> because<00:01:13.920> one

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
difference in between them because one

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.840 
difference in between them because one
of<00:01:14.280> them<00:01:14.520> is<00:01:14.700> tilted<00:01:15.360> slightly<00:01:16.100> slightly<00:01:17.100> not

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
of them is tilted slightly slightly not

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:23.179 
of them is tilted slightly slightly not
slightly<00:01:18.890> so<00:01:19.890> that<00:01:19.950> it<00:01:20.400> looks<00:01:20.659> like<00:01:21.860> the<00:01:22.860> logo

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
slightly so that it looks like the logo

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.030 
slightly so that it looks like the logo
if<00:01:23.400> you<00:01:23.490> look<00:01:23.670> at<00:01:23.790> the<00:01:23.909> logo<00:01:24.270> it<00:01:24.810> looks<00:01:25.040> just

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
if you look at the logo it looks just

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.789 
if you look at the logo it looks just
like<00:01:26.220> it<00:01:26.610> now<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:27.630> triangles<00:01:28.229> they're<00:01:28.650> gonna

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
like it now the triangles they're gonna

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.359 
like it now the triangles they're gonna
be<00:01:28.979> difficult<00:01:29.520> so<00:01:30.090> you<00:01:30.479> do<00:01:31.110> your<00:01:31.770> preference

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
be difficult so you do your preference

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.520 
be difficult so you do your preference
look<00:01:32.640> at<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:32.850> logo<00:01:33.240> it's<00:01:33.479> you<00:01:33.960> have<00:01:34.079> something

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530

look at the logo it's you have something
to<00:01:34.619> look<00:01:34.799> at<00:01:35.450> instead<00:01:36.450> of<00:01:36.780> just<00:01:37.020> off<00:01:37.409> of<00:01:37.470> my

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:39.470 
to look at instead of just off of my

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:43.219 
to look at instead of just off of my
preference<00:01:40.470> and<00:01:40.710> stuff<00:01:42.079> it's<00:01:43.079> actually

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
preference and stuff it's actually

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:44.090 
preference and stuff it's actually
pretty<00:01:43.649> good

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
pretty good

pretty good
easy<00:01:44.369> I'm<00:01:44.729> well<00:01:44.939> not<00:01:45.149> a<00:01:45.180> good<00:01:46.130> easy<00:01:47.130> level<00:01:47.430> you

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
easy I'm well not a good easy level you

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.740 
easy I'm well not a good easy level you
just<00:01:48.329> have<00:01:48.509> to<00:01:48.659> have<00:01:48.930> patience<00:01:49.619> and<00:01:50.750> right

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
here you see the archway to a little

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.100 
here you see the archway to a little
indentation<00:01:56.340> like<00:01:56.850> right<00:01:57.479> there<00:01:58.520> right<00:01:59.520> there

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
indentation like right there right there

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
that you just have to get the arch and

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.959 
that you just have to get the arch and
like<00:02:04.649> make<00:02:04.890> it<00:02:04.920> skinny<00:02:05.310> or<00:02:05.610> something<00:02:05.880> like

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
like make it skinny or something like

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.609 
like make it skinny or something like
that<00:02:06.149> just<00:02:06.180> get<00:02:06.630> something<00:02:07.170> that'll<00:02:07.350> make<00:02:07.439> it

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619
