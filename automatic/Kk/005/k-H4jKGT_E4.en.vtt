space right here this was closed off
before<00:01:03.270> and<00:01:03.480> kind<00:01:03.690> of<00:01:03.780> wasted<00:01:05.299> let's<00:01:06.299> just<00:01:06.450> do

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750

nice view from here and this little room
was<00:01:50.820> here<00:01:51.570> in<00:01:51.720> the<00:01:52.049> previous<00:01:53.180> design<00:01:54.180> which

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
was here in the previous design which

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.080 
was here in the previous design which
was<00:01:55.110> kind<00:01:55.380> of<00:01:55.500> ponderous<00:01:56.250> why<00:01:56.490> this<00:01:56.549> didn't

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
was kind of ponderous why this didn't

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.609 
was kind of ponderous why this didn't
appear<00:01:57.299> downstairs<00:01:57.869> on<00:01:57.960> the<00:01:57.990> first<00:01:58.229> floor<00:01:58.380> in

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
appear downstairs on the first floor in

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.550 
appear downstairs on the first floor in
that<00:01:58.770> design<00:01:59.070> but<00:01:59.880> all's<00:02:00.630> good<00:02:01.049> now<00:02:01.229> in<00:02:01.500> the

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
that design but all's good now in the

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.709 
that design but all's good now in the
world<00:02:01.829> and<00:02:02.159> we<00:02:02.549> are<00:02:02.700> going<00:02:02.939> to<00:02:03.180> head<00:02:03.420> to<00:02:03.689> the

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
world and we are going to head to the

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:07.760 
world and we are going to head to the
roof

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.339 

this<00:02:07.950> dedicated<00:02:08.729> stairway<00:02:09.509> leads<00:02:09.899> to<00:02:10.200> the

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
this dedicated stairway leads to the

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.500 
this dedicated stairway leads to the
roof<00:02:10.560> and<00:02:10.739> it<00:02:10.890> actually<00:02:11.129> has<00:02:11.700> a<00:02:11.730> door<00:02:12.180> at<00:02:12.420> the
