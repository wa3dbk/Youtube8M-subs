00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
12 volts on it keeping it that's all

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:22.420 
12 volts on it keeping it that's all
going<00:01:19.250> to<00:01:19.340> twist<00:01:19.580> in<00:01:19.700> the<00:01:19.790> video<00:01:21.130> you<00:01:22.130> see<00:01:22.160> the

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:22.430 
going to twist in the video you see the

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:23.950 
going to twist in the video you see the
meter<00:01:22.640> says<00:01:22.880> 12<00:01:23.180> volts<00:01:23.480> on<00:01:23.630> it

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.800 
meter says 12 volts on it
pull<00:01:24.380> back<00:01:24.560> let<00:01:24.770> us<00:01:24.890> see<00:01:25.010> why<00:01:25.160> measure<00:01:25.810> and

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 
pull back let us see why measure and

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.580 
pull back let us see why measure and
that's<00:01:27.050> good<00:01:27.730> so<00:01:28.840> 12<00:01:29.840> volts<00:01:30.110> is<00:01:30.230> definitely

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
that's good so 12 volts is definitely

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.500 
that's good so 12 volts is definitely

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:46.690 
power going to the unit we're pretty

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:48.730 
power going to the unit we're pretty
we're<00:01:47.690> pretty<00:01:47.900> assured<00:01:48.229> that<00:01:48.380> the<00:01:48.470> unit

we're pretty assured that the unit

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.590 
we're pretty assured that the unit
itself<00:01:49.010> is<00:01:49.190> bad<00:01:49.340> so<00:01:50.090> now<00:01:50.180> we're<00:01:50.270> going<00:01:50.360> to<00:01:50.420> pull
