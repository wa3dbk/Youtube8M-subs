00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.420 
are for high quality and preview okay so
high<00:02:25.480> quality<00:02:25.900> mode<00:02:26.110> allows<00:02:26.530> it<00:02:26.740> to<00:02:26.770> lag<00:02:27.070> quite

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
high quality mode allows it to lag quite

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.300 
high quality mode allows it to lag quite
a<00:02:27.460> bit<00:02:27.780> but<00:02:28.780> in<00:02:29.110> later<00:02:29.470> lessons<00:02:29.740> when<00:02:30.100> we're

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
a bit but in later lessons when we're

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.460 
a bit but in later lessons when we're
looking<00:02:30.610> at<00:02:30.760> textures<00:02:31.210> high<00:02:31.720> quality<00:02:32.140> mode<00:02:32.320> is

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
looking at textures high quality mode is

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.930 
looking at textures high quality mode is
very<00:02:32.950> very<00:02:33.990> essential<00:02:35.370> to<00:02:36.370> kind<00:02:36.580> of<00:02:36.640> look<00:02:36.790> at

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
very very essential to kind of look at

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.500 
very very essential to kind of look at
how<00:02:37.300> your<00:02:37.510> textures<00:02:37.870> look<00:02:38.140> in<00:02:38.530> real<00:02:38.680> time<00:02:39.510> all

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
how your textures look in real time all

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.000 
how your textures look in real time all
right<00:02:40.690> so<00:02:40.900> that's<00:02:41.020> it<00:02:41.290> I<00:02:41.440> just<00:02:41.740> wanted<00:02:41.980> to

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
right so that's it I just wanted to

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.970 
right so that's it I just wanted to
cover<00:02:42.220> some<00:02:42.580> of<00:02:42.610> the<00:02:42.960> number<00:02:43.960> one<00:02:43.990> things<00:02:44.260> that

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
cover some of the number one things that

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:46.710 
cover some of the number one things that
I<00:02:45.010> always<00:02:45.220> kind<00:02:45.550> of<00:02:45.670> have<00:02:45.790> to<00:02:45.910> cover<00:02:46.150> the<00:02:46.480> very

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
I always kind of have to cover the very

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.060 
I always kind of have to cover the very
first<00:02:46.990> day<00:02:47.230> of<00:02:47.350> class<00:02:47.620> right<00:02:48.610> in<00:02:48.700> one<00:02:48.850> video
