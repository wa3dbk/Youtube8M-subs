part<00:02:22.450> 2<00:02:22.720> I<00:02:22.990> felt<00:02:23.709> that<00:02:23.950> this<00:02:24.130> album<00:02:24.550> was<00:02:25.120> it<00:02:25.360> is

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:25.569 
part 2 I felt that this album was it is

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:27.180 
part 2 I felt that this album was it is
a<00:02:25.599> continuation<00:02:26.050> of<00:02:26.410> the<00:02:26.560> love<00:02:26.770> series

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
a continuation of the love series

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:28.900 
a continuation of the love series
obviously<00:02:27.400> but<00:02:28.030> it<00:02:28.120> doesn't<00:02:28.450> make<00:02:28.630> an

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
obviously but it doesn't make an

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:30.910 
obviously but it doesn't make an
off<00:02:28.970> of<00:02:29.150> attempt<00:02:29.600> to<00:02:30.080> stand<00:02:30.380> out<00:02:30.620> from<00:02:30.650> the

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
off of attempt to stand out from the

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.500 
off of attempt to stand out from the
crowd<00:02:31.160> from<00:02:31.610> other<00:02:31.910> Angels<00:02:32.300> and<00:02:32.450> Airwaves

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
crowd from other Angels and Airwaves

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.240 
crowd from other Angels and Airwaves
songs<00:02:32.930> like<00:02:33.590> anxiety<00:02:34.400> is<00:02:35.180> a<00:02:35.210> great<00:02:35.480> song<00:02:35.720> and

songs like anxiety is a great song and

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.440 
songs like anxiety is a great song and
I'm<00:02:37.250> glad<00:02:37.460> they<00:02:37.640> chose<00:02:37.790> that<00:02:38.030> as<00:02:38.180> the<00:02:38.270> lead

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
I'm glad they chose that as the lead

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.030 
I'm glad they chose that as the lead
single<00:02:38.810> and<00:02:38.990> the<00:02:39.080> music<00:02:39.320> video<00:02:39.530> is<00:02:39.680> great<00:02:39.890> for

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 
enough an attempt to stand out and

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:44.410 
enough an attempt to stand out and
although<00:03:42.470> that<00:03:42.819> everything<00:03:43.819> was<00:03:44.030> still<00:03:44.180> great

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:44.420
