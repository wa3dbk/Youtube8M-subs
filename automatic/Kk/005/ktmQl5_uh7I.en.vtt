00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:06.630
 hi there on alexander and rest 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:10.590
 all this we have 200 ok shlifmashinka 

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:13.430
 skill 73 38 per set with grinder 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.660
 three such sandpaper different gradations 

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:17.039
 equipped with a combination grinder 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.220
 the basis that is, you can use 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.929
 nazhdachki prilepi or ordinary fishing pole 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.480
 which will deal with these 

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:25.220
 clamps 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:28.560
 there is an exit for connection 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:32.669
 technical vacuum cleaner at least eccentric 2 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:35.820
 millimeter now as always before the giblets 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:40.470
 for a start unscrewed the pad a sake 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.130
 growth we have four screws pad 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:52.950
 unscrewed 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:54.030
 now start pulling arman here 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:57.630
 what ours look like 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.340
 retainer checks means our basis 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:02.340
 held on four plastic 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.610
 posts he such well let's just 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.610
 deeper 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.310
 Well, having untwisted naturally disassemble 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.840
 bollards our removable go immediately with 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.300
 guides 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.770
 i.e. wrong put them not 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.600
 get score points are removed 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.960
 naturally just enough 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:40.970
 neatly gouge 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.970
 screwdriver and she filmed 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:50.480
 here's how our brushes look close 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:56.530
 come with two grooves 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:02:00.380
 size 5 by 6 well, and now we get the mouths 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:07.840
 for this, neatly rising from 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:11.930
 Tatars here is how our anchor looks close 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:14.690
 naturally not armored stator too 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:17.860
 normal well and before you collect 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.980
 it remains to look only at the switch than 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:22.400
 usual 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:25.370
 such a kind of silk public 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.270
 so by the way forgot to say our 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:30.260
 counterweight 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:32.990
 rests on the slots but the parts we have 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:41.360
 run out so let's give take 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:43.990
 our rotor stator and start 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.990
 aim 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:53.450
 when everything was all right 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.880
 turns then you can put 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.650
 electrical brushes 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:02.270
 take the brush up against the collector and 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:09.290
 click clearly set now possible 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:11.860
 bet button set laundresses paste 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.860
 button 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:18.050
 make sure all the wires are good 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:22.610
 wound up and covered with corps follow 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:27.440
 so that our plastic poles hit the 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:33.019
 grooves and everything will come together well well 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:36.890
 naturally twist well and we will 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:39.170
 laying a foundation with clamps means 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:51.709
 First of all, we put our clamps on 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:53.989
 place first and second now take our 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:54.380
 Saturday is more convenient for us on the platform 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:57.739
 collect 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:04:01.010
 means to put in each 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:08.930
 it was easier we needed ours these 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:10.549
 clamps like this well in the grooves both well 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:12.230
 if the pad will lie on 

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:16.789
 surface of the cult that is with these 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:26.479
 things so not to miss and now corny 

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:29.240
 aim and press the ground 

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:31.520
 set left screwed 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:40.280
 4 screws which we unscrewed at the beginning 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:40.910
 video well here we are our miracle of technology 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:44.050
 have collected 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:44.050
 so let's check 

00:04:52.939 --> 00:04:58.680
 well what can I say about this 

00:04:55.259 --> 00:05:00.479
 ordinary small household grinders 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:02.370
 sander that is for home for 

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:04.620
 some small works will be quite 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:05.939
 enough but by no means 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:08.699
 Naturally not for professional 

00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:10.860
 so I can say that well 

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:13.349
 balanced that is when i'm here 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:16.229
 turn me off into this hand almost not 

00:05:13.349 --> 00:05:16.710
 gives a situation that is it seems started 

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:18.569
 stage 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:20.939
 well i hope the video was helpful 

00:05:18.569 --> 00:05:23.419
 so subscribe to the channel are sharing 

00:05:20.939 --> 00:05:23.419
