00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.460
 hi this is a team it's nicolas 

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:03.899
 who was talking to you before I started 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.259
 where was the welcome to the whole 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.370
 first video of the aele team 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:09.690
 explain later how this 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.090
 chain will work but for 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.259
 the moment not care of videos we go 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.400
 take a look at a question that's 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.080
 go back where you are probably already 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.060
 asked before what is my body 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.140
 and it's possible that some of 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.640
 you already had the answer to this 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.900
 question but let's look at our 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.250
 body of the human scale things 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.470
 that we can see and from there we will go 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.160
 up to her the one of the very small 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:27.480
 let's start with the beginning 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.220
 our body is made of materials 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.510
 organic obviously the man and all 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.940
 the animals are made is she 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.360
 composed mostly of carbon that 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.500
 the idea of ​​the carbon deal on earth 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.820
 but unfortunately will not have the 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.100
 time to explore it more deeply 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.690
 this scale for now let's move on to 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.370
 another channel if I take my material 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.289
 basic organic and that I'm doing something 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.250
 thing to see what molecules had 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.010
 more present in the human body 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.329
 the result will be unsurprisingly the water in 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.640
 effect our body is composed of about 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.079
 65% of water is the main component 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.579
 of many species of which we humans 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.109
 this combination of two atoms 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.879
 of hydrogen and one of oxygen is 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:04.710
 indispensable to human life then 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:06.210
 are we to flask bag of water yes for 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.549
 the atoms the oxygen is the most present 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.140
 indeed 65 % of the total mass of 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.600
 human body being the mass of oxygen 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.700
 in our body it is followed by carbon 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.040
 with 18% hydrogen and 10% 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.900
 nitrogen with 3% which cm with one for 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.409
 hundred and a half the fake spell with about 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.960
 1% 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.310
 he list is long but the others 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.610
 are in minimal amounts like lead 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.140
 sulfur or even arsenic but let's move on 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.070
 an even smaller scale of what 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.750
 are made all the atoms 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.430
 they are composed of two parts the 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.900
 core that concentrates almost all of 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.490
 mass of hematomas and electrons 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.930
 fundamental particles almost 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.939
 without a mask, you can almost say 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.140
 that he gravitates around the shirt I say 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.180
 almost because it's not really good 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.770
 term to use the nucleus is constituted 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.570
 of nucleons which are the protons and the 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.220
 proton neutrons at a positive charge 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.170
 while another one has no charge 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.729
 is an electron a negative charge all 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.100
 together the balances the load of 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.329
 atom 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.409
 It is generally accepted that 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.790
 electrons are particles 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:00.689
 elementary which means they do not 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.890
 can not be cut but the protons 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.270
 and neutrons are made up of 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.540
 something even smaller the 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.920
 quarks and usually people say 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.569
 that there are two kinds of quarks not 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.679
 really but only 2 and multitude 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.080
 of races that exist are 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.070
 interesting for us now 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.410
 I 'm not going to talk about the colors of 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:16.760
 quarks or other things the quarks not 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.290
 with a negative interest charge and 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.660
 the top quarks with a charge of two 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.070
 positive thirds 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.240
 there are two SBA hiccups and an up quark 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:26.030
 in a neutron that make it 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:27.680
 electrically neutral for the proto it 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.980
 there is a low quack and quark at it 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.880
 confers a positive charge 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:35.390
 we are therefore a mountain 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.680
 gigantic quarks and that's you have 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.970
 finally what are the main 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.680
 components of everything you are 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.909
 or so know it really 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.049
 because today we still 

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:44.790
 will spend something inside the 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:46.200
 headdresses and string theory too 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.670
 known as the theory of everything 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.230
 tells us that quarks and even the 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.939
 electrons are made of oak which also 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.189
 to form all the matter of 

00:02:50.939 --> 00:02:55.409
 the universe so are we made the 

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:57.329
 no chords we can not really 

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:59.639
 know for now but who does not find 

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:01.139
 nothing more I lied 

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:02.939
 we are not just composed of 

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:05.329
 strings but mostly empty because the atom 

00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:09.019
 is composed of 89% empty rain 

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:09.019
 sorry for the ad lie 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:12.549
 I will cover topics that I have 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.620
 not cover in this video anymore 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:16.269
 late for other occasions it's 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.530
 submit your own ideas on our 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:18.879
 facebook page that I suggest you 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.109
 strongly to like or in the 

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:21.400
 comments just down and you 

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:23.049
 subscribe to our channel to be at 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.760

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:26.170
 on the channel or whatever you can 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.670
 find links to everything you 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.560
 need the description below 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:32.099
 thank you for watching and good luck 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.099
 until next week
