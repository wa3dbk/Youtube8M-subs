this<00:00:01.829> section<00:00:02.280> is<00:00:02.460> about<00:00:02.490> human<00:00:03.179> blood

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:03.540 
this section is about human blood

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.920 
this section is about human blood
circulation<00:00:04.879> it<00:00:05.879> covers<00:00:06.330> how<00:00:06.480> the<00:00:06.540> heart

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
circulation it covers how the heart

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.589 
circulation it covers how the heart
circulates<00:00:07.770> blood<00:00:07.980> around<00:00:08.370> the<00:00:08.519> body<00:00:08.580> and<00:00:09.030> a

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
circulates blood around the body and a

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.009 
circulates blood around the body and a
composition<00:00:10.230> of<00:00:10.410> blood<00:00:10.650> itself<00:00:11.750> first<00:00:12.750> we

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
composition of blood itself first we

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.700 
composition of blood itself first we
look<00:00:13.230> at<00:00:13.349> how<00:00:13.500> the<00:00:13.559> heart<00:00:13.830> circulates<00:00:14.610> blood

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:15.710 
look at how the heart circulates blood

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:18.380 
look at how the heart circulates blood
the<00:00:16.710> heart<00:00:16.920> of<00:00:17.190> the<00:00:17.279> complex<00:00:17.789> muscle

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
the heart of the complex muscle

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.890 
the heart of the complex muscle
it<00:00:18.810> beats<00:00:19.400> 3,000<00:00:20.400> million<00:00:20.699> times<00:00:21.210> in<00:00:21.480> a<00:00:21.539> human

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
it beats 3,000 million times in a human

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.990 
it beats 3,000 million times in a human
lifespan<00:00:22.220> forcing<00:00:23.220> the<00:00:23.340> blood<00:00:23.430> round<00:00:23.820> the

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
lifespan forcing the blood round the

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.580 
lifespan forcing the blood round the
body<00:00:24.180> once<00:00:24.510> every<00:00:24.990> minute

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
body once every minute

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.540 
body once every minute
if<00:00:26.279> we<00:00:26.460> look<00:00:26.609> inside<00:00:26.820> a<00:00:27.420> heart<00:00:27.900> and<00:00:28.439> we<00:00:29.130> can<00:00:29.279> see

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
if we look inside a heart and we can see

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.089 
if we look inside a heart and we can see
there<00:00:29.789> is<00:00:29.939> a<00:00:30.179> thin<00:00:30.599> walled<00:00:30.900> chamber<00:00:31.619> and<00:00:31.800> a

thick walled chamber the smaller chamber

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.420 
thick walled chamber the smaller chamber
delivers<00:00:36.989> blood<00:00:37.710> through<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.219> pulmonary

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
delivers blood through the pulmonary

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.650
