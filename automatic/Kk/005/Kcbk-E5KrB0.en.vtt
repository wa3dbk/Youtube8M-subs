00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:10.129
 good friends of the channel I am animal 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:12.230
 how good today we are in another rotation 

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:14.750
 God legend and let's start 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:16.520
 talk about the champions and then I lost 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:18.320
 its cons as you are seeing in the 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.930
 principle and that here on the screen 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:24.230
 the right we have the rotation like 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:28.699
 you are watching, wait, urban calling area 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:32.239
 twist of fate 60 na its erramos and 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:34.790
 morgana good for people who just me 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:36.140
 see why once in this video if 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:37.700
 you pass the mouse over the 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.920
 photograph by each of the 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:42.410
 characters if you have guidance it lights up and you 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.840
 you give him a vile and takes the guide very 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.700
 ok let's go starting let's go 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.710
 starting by talking about oakland blanc like 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.270
 you know a good magician for the medium and 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.280
 has a lot of damage in the 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:54.980
 area can kill to try in mind with 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.480
 his combo also has a good there 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.969
 a passive that tells that I also like 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:01.250
 hope they left and there's no future their 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:03.260
 definitive can dominate the team fai and 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.770
 I also want to tell you that they have a 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:08.240
 good stun if we learn to launch the cv 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.619
 as you know is a magical character 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.330
 the magical characters is usually 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:11.870
 pretty soft I also have to have 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.510
 a little 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:15.800
 with a double-double to better impact 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:18.470
 our enemies and I also want 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:20.180
 tell you how good or a little bit of 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:23.040
 the practice is missing because it is difficult to go to 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:25.410
 the w at the exact moment 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.760
 now we talk about area as you know is a 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:29.400
 pretty easy to learn character 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:31.560
 to play with it is very versatile has 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.470
 very little of his character the skills 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.270
 has a good cc for dustin fai can 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.730
 going around in the game helps 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.730
 accumulate very quickly 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:44.550
 defenses and attacks and really 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:46.410
 it's pretty good now we're going to one of 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:48.720
 the cons as you know this character 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:50.880
 It's very soft from the beginning 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:54.360
 very low manna so when you're 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.940
 examining a lot of low music a lot has 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.910
 a terrible healing relationship with your 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.560
 app has a cc that is unique 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:03.270
 definitive and you have to have them very well 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.430
 This character has just 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.080
 escape mechanisms and I also want 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.940
 tell you that they are very focused to be you 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.300
 the focus since the armor of the 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.860
 character in base has hardly 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.800
 now let's talk about harvard like 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:19.400
 you know already keeps very very good passive 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:22.010
 also has the ability to harass the 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.540
 enemy and families very easily is very 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.090
 so that the character can also be 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.880
 off so and very has to say very a 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.860
 very physical character and I want to tell you 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.180
 one thing has a bestial combo lae that 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.820
 put the flag and gain attack speed 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.530
 armor with the q is hooked and can 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:38.150
 lift the enemy and with the ultimate 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.640
 can prevent them from escaping further with 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:42.140
 the w increases an armor and slows down 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.940
 moss our enemies is also very 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.980
 good in the jungle also serves even 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.660
 of support galvan is one of the 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.790
 characters that more positions can 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:51.740
 be as you know the cons of 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.870
 saved that at the beginning of it being 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:55.430
 a lot of herd you will need objects 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.800
 as for example a social veteran for 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.270
 hold a little more in the tap and 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.040
 I also have to tell you that you have to 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:03.290
 have much in mind the practice with the 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.670
 dance and the flag because you have to 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:05.990
 be very careful if you put the 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:08.570
 flag and one night 'inquires with the 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:09.920
 dance and that say ice also has 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:11.240
 Be careful with the definitive one because you can 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.680
 leave locked allies 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:14.209
 try to escape 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.760
 now we talk about hayling as you know 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:19.189
 Caijing has a is one of those that 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:22.189
 marcan has of the game has 650 

00:03:19.189 --> 00:03:23.959
 It has a lot of variety of running and 

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:26.090
 shoot or for example to push the 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:27.680
 line with the q also as you know has 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:30.319
 a very good final because when 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.579
 marks a goal and the shot does not go 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:33.500
 is going to escape except someone 

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:35.840
 third lock also has a good 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.420
 escape with the network has a good way 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.439
 is for enemies with traps 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:40.790
 but you have to also take into account 

00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:43.700
 the position if this is a position 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:45.980
 right is going to be one of the champions 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.540
 the best there is of meat as you know its 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:50.510
 cons is that at the beginning of the game 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:52.700
 has very little manna the traps of the 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:54.280
 goals can be dodged very easily 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:56.180
 because of the visibility so easy 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.519
 you also have to keep in mind that 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:01.000
 the network does not serve to prioritize it because it is 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:03.680
 ape and you have to have also finally 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.599
 very very very much in mind is the definitive 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.849
 when you try to try not to have 

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:09.980
 no enemy allies of good enemies 

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:11.490
 close to their allies so they can not 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:13.080
 and then there is the bullet 

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:15.120
 now after this face as you know 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:18.209
 has a good push with jokers picks 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:20.310
 a letter also has a good damage 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:21.750
 area with the q not usually lack of mana 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:24.120
 Grace takes a letter from the blue 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:26.070
 You can also see the whole map with the 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:28.020
 definitive voice and its passive helps a lot 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:29.730
 the team to win more gold cons has 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:32.250
 have to take into account a lot of time 

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:34.410
 Be alert to react quickly to 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:35.790
 correct letters also if you have not 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:37.980
 ever played with this effect will cost a 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:40.140
 little also the issue of launching 

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:41.100
 letters with the cv and the other topic that 

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:43.320
 has is that the speed of movement 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:45.360
 base is very low 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:47.250
 now we go from grace to grace 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:49.710
 you know has an amazing bus has 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:53.070
 a lot of power also has a good 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:55.800
 escape with the jump is a good changer 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:57.420
 and also with the battle of smoke we can 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:58.620
 give complications to rivals too 

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:00.390
 of a final good that ends 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:03.780
 always when they are left with a bit of 

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:05.700
 life cons as you know has a 

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:07.529
 very low attack speed does not have a 

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:10.289
 it's hard it's missing 

00:05:07.529 --> 00:05:12.659
 as it lacks power in the end and 

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:15.149
 has very short range now we have to 

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:17.639
 do as you know you have a damage 

00:05:15.149 --> 00:05:19.919
 immediate explosive its damage has also 

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:21.979
 been is quite strong has a 

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:24.509
 safe jungle has a high mobility 

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:26.279
 you can escape with your copy your definitive 

00:05:24.509 --> 00:05:27.839
 it's very good because it leaves a mark and 

00:05:26.279 --> 00:05:30.689
 explode then with all the damage that you have 

00:05:27.839 --> 00:05:32.429
 impacted the cons is that it is missing 

00:05:30.689 --> 00:05:33.689
 always energy you will need to make yourself 

00:05:32.429 --> 00:05:36.149
 a group to recover faster the 

00:05:33.689 --> 00:05:38.719
 energy is not very hard does not have these 

00:05:36.149 --> 00:05:40.769
 good and it's pretty hard to play 

00:05:38.719 --> 00:05:42.899
 now we talk about the anses as you know 

00:05:40.769 --> 00:05:45.269
 its strong point is the q when it is good 

00:05:42.899 --> 00:05:47.939
 formed is very fun to play 

00:05:45.269 --> 00:05:49.109
 has a good stealing of life in passive and 

00:05:47.939 --> 00:05:51.479
 is one of the characters that in only 

00:05:49.109 --> 00:05:53.419
 everything endures a lot we also have 

00:05:51.479 --> 00:05:55.499
 need to add that it has a slowdown 

00:05:53.419 --> 00:05:57.479
 has a definite one that can give you 

00:05:55.499 --> 00:05:59.339
 more life and endure bad team faith and 

00:05:57.479 --> 00:06:03.630
 you can also reduce the armor with your 

00:05:59.339 --> 00:06:06.000
 area the contra depends a lot on the film or 

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:07.800
 at the beginning of the game he also has a 

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.060
 defect in way that is to say consume 

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:12.060
 very much every time it hits 

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:13.980
 cv tail and it's also a character that if 

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:17.040
 It is not well equipped with a very good 

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:19.110
 it's going to cost you to win the line now 

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:20.970
 we talk about bouquets as you know is a 

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:23.670
 very tan character that has good to 

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:25.770
 gross is very good the jungle is also 

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:27.210
 very good changing thanks to that it has 

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:29.670
 a definite one that does a lot of damage 

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:31.410
 in area and I also want to say or that 

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:33.060
 It is one of the most resistant characters 

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:35.010
 what is there since when you get in shape 

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:37.020
 defensive can return all the damage 

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:39.150
 and finally from the list we have 

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:40.980
 morgana as you know is a character that 

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:42.570
 he has a lot of strength he can hold 

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:45.510
 very well the middle lane of surfing and 

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:48.030
 of his voice has immunity to two stunts a 

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:49.920
 great damage in area a good stucco the cv and 

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:51.810
 a definitive one definitively 

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:53.940
 bestial would be given to avoid in a team 

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:56.280
 enemy and you can catch everyone and 

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:58.530
 study them at the same time against as you know 

00:06:56.280 --> 00:07:00.300
 the against that morgana in which you have 

00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:01.740
 that know how to point with the q you have to 

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:03.420
 keep in mind also know how to throw 

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:04.920
 definitive when it is together with your 

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:06.360
 team and it also means that 

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:08.250
 You also have to know when to throw yourself 

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:10.910
 the black shield or cast are a companion 

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:13.650
 for example on point is important as 

00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:15.420
 he needs the black shield the blows 

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:17.160
 good friend of channel I hope that there 

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:18.660
 liked this rotation as you know what 

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:20.490
 I repeat again if you pass closed by
