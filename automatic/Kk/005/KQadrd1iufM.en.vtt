 seafood without using the fish if 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.690
 because in the sea you are not the only fish 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.640
 what the ingredient will be 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.859
 we will replace the fish with the algae that 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.050
 however they will carry a lot of vitamins 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.880
 precious mineral salts proteins fiber 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.400
 let's see how to prepare the tricks and tele 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.160
 sea-scented dog ingredients for 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:32.099
 10 12 croquettes 100 grams of approx 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:35.160
 hemp tofu or pure soy 10 grams 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:38.309
 of wakame seaweed 140 grams of chickpeas 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:41.190
 boiled salt pepper a tablespoon of oil 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.649
 extra virgin olive oil 20 grams approx 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.129
 dry 8 grams of brewer's yeast in 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:49.440
 flake a tablespoon of breadcrumbs 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:51.719
 to cover 60 grams intra seeds of 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.059
 sesame poppy 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:58.440
 the first thing to do is rehydrate the 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:01:03.290
 from the co which is a root and also secular 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:06.990
 we simply pour water 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:08.430
 if in one bowl is in the other 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.010
 I bought both products 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.020
 online but you can request them in 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.000
 herbalist pharmacy or 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.409
 buy them in stores specializing in 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.409
 organic and macrobiotic products 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:25.010
 in short about ten minutes in short 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:28.730
 wakame had hydrated as well as the 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:31.880
 our prepared with here I have prepared 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:34.430
 of hemp tofu as you do I repeat to you 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.320
 quickly the recipe I prepared the 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:38.630
 milk with hemp seeds blending 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.610
 simply the 6 min not peeled 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.820
 so the integral with water 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:46.760
 then I poured hemp milk into one 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:49.450
 casserole and I brought it to 80 85 degrees 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:51.620
 or added in di garhi that would be the 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.810
 coagulant that is used for the 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:55.490
 preparation of the mouse in general not 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.610
 you can replace with some juice 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:00.860
 lemon and then it coagulated and I removed 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.810
 I saw the curd with a colander in it 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.850
 a cell and this is the result anyway 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.640
 I will also put the recipe in a link 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:10.580
 in overlay or at the end of the video 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:13.850
 meanwhile or drained the drained lay 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:16.190
 the algae and here all was of the chickpeas the 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:19.070
 weight that I suggested is of course 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:23.840
 from the already cooked cc we gather everything 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:25.760
 inside a blender like 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.459
 alternative chickpeas naturally you can 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.860
 also use other legumes such as the 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:35.930
 soy peas lentils or a mix 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:37.910
 what you want then also in the 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:40.250
 institutions you can change them 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:42.590
 according to your tastes as a booster 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.540
 of flavor I would add also of the 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.770
 this yeast is also in flakes 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.770
 I bought it in a store 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:50.780
 specialized in organic products 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:53.330
 if you don't have it you can either put it or 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:55.370
 replace it with del gomasio add 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:03:00.980
 now you see the hemp top 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:03.020
 rather soft you can replace it 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:06.380
 quietly with cheese 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:09.590
 spreadable vega or with soy tofu 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:11.660
 so classic we add a goccino 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:14.270
 of extra virgin olive oil 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:15.950
 salt and pepper peanuts as required and then 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:18.200
 we drill everything until we get one 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:20.450
 cream and add a lot of bread 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.860
 grated as needed until 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:26.050
 get the consistency that we 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:26.050
 we wish to model with our hands 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:33.270
 see how the consistency is after some 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:35.190
 minutes of maturation I still can't 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:37.080
 but mold it that the hands are 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:41.810
 therefore another little bit of bread 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:41.810
 grated and to your own 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:48.170
 here it is the perfect consistency 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.620
 we have to make some croquettes 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:53.920
 so in a plan I prepared a mix 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:55.940
 of poppy seeds and sesame seeds 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.470
 I distribute a little on the mixing plate 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:01.330
 of course you can also choose 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:01.330
 other seeds, the ones you prefer 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:07.150
 I expected a spoonful of the mixture 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.950
 let's put another little bit 

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:23.370
 we cover with seeds and then we perish 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:35.820
 in your hands until you form one 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:37.790
 croquette and then we arrange one 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:40.470
 baking tin 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:42.000
 my idea and cook them after all though 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:49.950
 you want you can also cook in the pan 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:53.040
 for an extra fancy version or so 

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:57.180
 obtained 12 crosses or a tad bit of 

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:59.700
 oil on even if it is not needed in 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:01.050
 oven at 180 degrees for about 20 minutes 

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:04.380
 the last five minutes 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:06.690
 put the function in the Brill and 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:09.300
 this is my presentation idea 

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:12.360
 alternative on a nice little saucer 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:14.970
 we can serve it as a very appetizer 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:17.220
 particular and also elegant and refined 

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:18.990
 I served it with a senate sauce it is 

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:21.060
 homemade thanks to the attention 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:23.780
 see a like me if you liked 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:23.780
 hello to the next one
