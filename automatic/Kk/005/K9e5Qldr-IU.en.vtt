 Today I teach you this nail art of 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.849
 butterfly wing 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.530
 I had already done it once he asked me 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.299
 a tutorial but at the time did not have 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.109
 how to record then I made a panel in 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.180
 Photos 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:21.810
 so today I brought this video option 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:24.060
 For you guys, go and do this nail. 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.769
 used these natural she will lose 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.279
 long time I'll show you a 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.439
 one 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.269
 my first video but I used the 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.300
 five colors of enamel to make a 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.579
 gradient but then you choose colors 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.100
 vc see fully adapted to this 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:41.670
 part and I forgot to put the sponge 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:44.399
 in this photo but it is also a sponge 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.920
 I started with the lines mounted on white 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:49.260
 and blue or black white cries and base 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.629
 this basis of which it is a base 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.670
 very beautiful in china and it's very good 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.899
 sponge to use these glazes that I 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.899
 I jurei da ana hickmann 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.410
 my uncle the colorama show 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.640
 left 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:08.360
 the great attraction of colorama and a 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.360
 kitchen sponge 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:15.780
 I start the pink color I put one 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.520
 little enamel cd sponge fashion and 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.259
 There was access for me to be able to 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.630
 unite because there has not been a 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:25.979
 very large enamel and does not 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:27.780
 taking effect and stripped and now came 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:32.310
 with purple and do the same procedure 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:34.439
 government soon beats pink I 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.110
 I'm drawing this diagonally 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:56.569
 But you can do it the way you do. 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:56.569
 now do with the same blue color thing 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.799
 seeing 

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:17.910
 with these see clear and comes with a 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:20.940
 second layer of it is now with a 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:27.450
 orange I do it at the tip of the nail 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:29.700
 I'm tapping the same thing and it's a 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.690
 clear also has been doing more 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.690
 scumbags on top 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.840
 to improve the color gamut 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.360
 I came back with the blue and I'm giving 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.130
 in this transition that was the 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.500
 better is softer do not stay that 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:49.870
 nail marking 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:52.210
 now the quiet link I like to use 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:54.430
 the bevelled brush to wipe around 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:56.050
 of the cuticle is a technique called 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:03:01.570
 American swimming for making a video 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:03.490
 still explaining how she does it then 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:06.220
 just downloaded I thought it would be 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:10.440
 cool to put a green between blue and 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:13.300
 Orange I used this fashion continuum 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:18.700
 now comes with a pen in it's already this 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:19.570
 Pen nba or do not know how you 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.970
 pronunciation 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:24.010
 but a black gel stone and I like 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:25.380
 drawings things is not with her not 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:28.150
 need more 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:32.110
 I'll do it on the half-moon right there. 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:35.500
 I'll make a ball and 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:37.750
 I'm going from the middle to the ends 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:40.450
 I think it's better done now 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:44.910
 We're going to do a couple of things with 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.910
 vaduz to the side of the nail 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:55.840
 I thought snow was the shame that year 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:08.750
 I thought 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:08.750
 the act me and I think I 'm fine 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:14.970
 Hey 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:24.470
 That's what I needed the most for my thumb. 

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:24.470
 to do the same thing as the others 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:32.670
 Now we will mend a skin which 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:36.030
 so I'll do a little things and go 

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:41.330
 sending all the risks to form the 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:41.330
 that black part of beauty knows 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:17.750
 now I'm going to use a black fabric paint 

00:05:03.349 --> 00:05:21.280
 and I will fill that space that was the 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:21.280
 my hand I have 

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:35.010
 now I'm going to use fabric paint in color 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:37.590
 white that watch polka dots with a 

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:40.440
 scorer and if goal scorer that I am using 

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:42.300
 is ready and the relative is fine 

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:46.820
 dripping, I'm not doing several 

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:46.820
 white polka dots on all the pieces 

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:11.780
 was going to unload again 

00:06:10.009 --> 00:06:13.759
 and not to wait, she wants to be 

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:15.409
 because it was too late 

00:06:13.759 --> 00:06:20.090
 I already I finished I'll tell you 

00:06:15.409 --> 00:06:22.659
 What I did I took the pen a gel and 

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:24.139
 I've refined the cases to let 

00:06:22.659 --> 00:06:27.169
 next 

00:06:24.139 --> 00:06:32.960
 I passed a layer of dowry 

00:06:27.169 --> 00:06:39.080
 and if I do not meet and I spent a 

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:43.330
 layer of disco ball in paulo and 

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:43.330
 finished with the extra brightness of the ideal 

00:06:44.439 --> 00:06:49.789
 and this was the end result of the nails 

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:51.430
 I hope you have enjoyed it. 

00:06:49.789 --> 00:06:55.969
 has nothing to understand 

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:58.069
 so they look really pretty 

00:06:55.969 --> 00:07:01.009
 Do you like this if you write that 

00:06:58.069 --> 00:07:05.319
 channel not playing green and to help in 

00:07:01.009 --> 00:07:05.319
 dissemination and until the next
