clones<00:02:54.200> like<00:02:54.590> you<00:02:55.549> know<00:02:55.670> my<00:02:55.790> custom<00:02:56.180> clones

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
clones like you know my custom clones

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.350 
clones like you know my custom clones
some<00:02:56.989> of<00:02:57.110> them<00:02:57.230> are<00:02:57.350> stormtroopers<00:02:58.060> sure<00:02:59.060> he

00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360 
some of them are stormtroopers sure he

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:04.449 
some of them are stormtroopers sure he
is<00:02:59.420> and<00:02:59.840> oh<00:03:02.079> here<00:03:03.079> he<00:03:03.260> is<00:03:03.290> compared<00:03:03.799> to<00:03:03.890> Altair

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:04.459 
is and oh here he is compared to Altair

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:07.990 
is and oh here he is compared to Altair
and<00:03:05.350> Altair<00:03:06.380> sometimes<00:03:07.190> kind<00:03:07.459> of<00:03:07.519> stands<00:03:07.820> on

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
and Altair sometimes kind of stands on

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.979 
and Altair sometimes kind of stands on
his<00:03:08.090> own<00:03:08.299> legs<00:03:09.760> sometimes<00:03:10.760> if<00:03:11.420> you<00:03:11.540> stabilize

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:11.989 
his own legs sometimes if you stabilize

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:17.979 
his own legs sometimes if you stabilize
a<00:03:12.019> tail<00:03:12.380> you<00:03:12.739> will<00:03:15.010> yeah<00:03:16.209> anyway<00:03:17.209> here's<00:03:17.900> the

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:17.989 
a tail you will yeah anyway here's the

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:21.580 
a tail you will yeah anyway here's the
comparison<00:03:18.549> so<00:03:19.549> I<00:03:19.579> made<00:03:19.880> Altair<00:03:20.329> vive<00:03:21.230> in

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
comparison so I made Altair vive in

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.729 
comparison so I made Altair vive in
scale<00:03:22.100> to<00:03:22.130> a<00:03:22.400> minute<00:03:22.760> figure<00:03:23.470> he<00:03:24.470> should<00:03:24.650> have

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:24.739 
scale to a minute figure he should have

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:27.370 
scale to a minute figure he should have
been<00:03:24.859> a<00:03:24.890> bit<00:03:25.100> bigger<00:03:25.310> but<00:03:25.549> yeah<00:03:25.940> and<00:03:26.380> now

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.380 
been a bit bigger but yeah and now

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:29.199 
been a bit bigger but yeah and now
booths<00:03:27.859> ability

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 
booths ability

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:32.849 
booths ability
he<00:03:29.810> can<00:03:29.989> move<00:03:30.200> his<00:03:30.260> neck<00:03:30.500> from<00:03:31.340> right<00:03:31.640> there

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:32.859 
he can move his neck from right there

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:37.500 
he can move his neck from right there
all<00:03:33.859> right<00:03:35.019> there

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
all right there

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:40.000 
all right there
from<00:03:38.510> right<00:03:38.989> there

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
from right there

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:43.869 
from right there
and<00:03:41.230> from<00:03:42.230> there<00:03:42.530> but<00:03:42.769> you<00:03:43.099> can<00:03:43.250> only<00:03:43.400> move<00:03:43.700> it

00:03:43.869 --> 00:03:43.879 
and from there but you can only move it

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:46.420 
and from there but you can only move it
down<00:03:44.090> from<00:03:44.299> there<00:03:44.510> and<00:03:44.689> then<00:03:45.349> the<00:03:45.590> horns<00:03:45.950> for

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
down from there and then the horns for

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:51.580 
down from there and then the horns for
split<00:03:46.819> from<00:03:47.030> the<00:03:47.829> actual<00:03:48.829> headpiece<00:03:49.430> so<00:03:50.590> then

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:51.590 
split from the actual headpiece so then

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:59.289 
split from the actual headpiece so then
legs<00:03:52.370> can<00:03:52.730> move<00:03:52.760> a<00:03:53.420> bit<00:03:55.689> yeah<00:03:56.750> and<00:03:58.060> the<00:03:59.060> wings

00:03:59.289 --> 00:03:59.299 
legs can move a bit yeah and the wings

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:03.729 
legs can move a bit yeah and the wings
the<00:03:59.900> horn<00:04:00.139> of<00:04:00.379> course<00:04:00.739> can<00:04:01.069> move<00:04:01.840> now<00:04:02.840> tail<00:04:03.409> can

00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:03.739 
the horn of course can move now tail can

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:07.300 
the horn of course can move now tail can
go<00:04:03.950> side<00:04:04.579> to<00:04:04.609> side<00:04:04.849> and<00:04:05.689> from<00:04:06.650> there<00:04:06.829> it<00:04:06.950> can<00:04:07.099> go

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:07.310 
go side to side and from there it can go

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:13.869 
go side to side and from there it can go
up<00:04:07.549> down<00:04:09.609> same<00:04:10.609> joint<00:04:10.970> there<00:04:11.599> and<00:04:12.639> these<00:04:13.639> piece

00:04:13.869 --> 00:04:13.879 
up down same joint there and these piece

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:18.789 
up down same joint there and these piece
of<00:04:14.060> course<00:04:14.419> can<00:04:14.629> move<00:04:14.900> now<00:04:16.389> wings<00:04:17.389> can<00:04:17.989> go<00:04:18.229> down

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:18.799 
of course can move now wings can go down

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:22.629 
of course can move now wings can go down
up<00:04:19.549> and<00:04:20.259> have<00:04:21.259> another<00:04:21.470> click<00:04:21.919> joint<00:04:22.160> right

00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:22.639 
up and have another click joint right

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:26.800 
up and have another click joint right
there<00:04:22.940> which<00:04:23.410> allows<00:04:24.410> them<00:04:25.090> allows<00:04:26.090> them<00:04:26.630> to

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:26.810 
there which allows them allows them to

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:30.670 
there which allows them allows them to
click<00:04:27.139> around<00:04:27.349> and<00:04:27.919> everything<00:04:28.750> you<00:04:29.750> know<00:04:29.900> go
