00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.790 

all<00:00:00.659> right<00:00:00.780> so<00:00:00.989> this<00:00:01.260> is<00:00:01.319> the<00:00:01.439> heart<00:00:01.650> right

00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:01.800 
all right so this is the heart right

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.789 
all right so this is the heart right
here<00:00:02.040> right<00:00:02.929> coming<00:00:03.929> out<00:00:04.049> of<00:00:04.140> the<00:00:04.200> heart<00:00:04.410> is

00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:04.799 
here right coming out of the heart is

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:07.490 
here right coming out of the heart is
the<00:00:05.330> aorta<00:00:06.330> so<00:00:06.450> this<00:00:06.569> is<00:00:06.690> the<00:00:06.810> aortic<00:00:07.379> arch

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
the aorta so this is the aortic arch

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.320 
the aorta so this is the aortic arch
right<00:00:07.830> here<00:00:07.859> might<00:00:08.340> be<00:00:08.460> kinda<00:00:08.970> hard<00:00:09.000> to<00:00:09.179> see

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
right here might be kinda hard to see

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:10.459 
right here might be kinda hard to see
right<00:00:09.360> here<00:00:09.540> but<00:00:09.660> it's<00:00:09.780> just<00:00:09.840> this<00:00:10.260> big

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
right here but it's just this big

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.190 
right here but it's just this big
arching<00:00:10.980> thing<00:00:11.450> vessel<00:00:12.450> and<00:00:12.719> the<00:00:13.019> first

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
arching thing vessel and the first

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.419 
arching thing vessel and the first
branch<00:00:13.349> off<00:00:13.620> the<00:00:13.710> aorta<00:00:13.830> is<00:00:14.250> the

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
branch off the aorta is the

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.070 
branch off the aorta is the
brachiocephalic<00:00:14.790> artery<00:00:15.480> because<00:00:15.809> in<00:00:15.960> the

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
brachiocephalic artery because in the

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.150 
brachiocephalic artery because in the
cat<00:00:16.260> you<00:00:16.500> know<00:00:16.619> just<00:00:16.859> like<00:00:16.949> in<00:00:17.070> the<00:00:17.130> human

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
cat you know just like in the human

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.710 
cat you know just like in the human
that's<00:00:17.520> the<00:00:17.670> first<00:00:17.850> branch<00:00:18.119> but<00:00:18.359> different

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
that's the first branch but different

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.960 
that's the first branch but different
from<00:00:18.779> the<00:00:18.900> human<00:00:19.260> for<00:00:19.800> the<00:00:19.830> typical<00:00:20.220> human<00:00:20.430> the

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
from the human for the typical human the

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.370 
from the human for the typical human the
brachiocephalic<00:00:21.330> artery<00:00:21.840> comes<00:00:22.050> up<00:00:22.170> and<00:00:22.260> then

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
brachiocephalic artery comes up and then

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.320 
brachiocephalic artery comes up and then
branches<00:00:22.710> into<00:00:22.859> three<00:00:23.310> different<00:00:24.180> blood

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
branches into three different blood

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.529 
branches into three different blood
vessels<00:00:25.130> so<00:00:26.130> the<00:00:26.550> three<00:00:27.090> that<00:00:27.210> it<00:00:27.300> branches

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
vessels so the three that it branches

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:33.319 
vessels so the three that it branches
into<00:00:31.369> over<00:00:32.369> here<00:00:32.520> if<00:00:32.579> we<00:00:32.640> kind<00:00:32.940> of<00:00:33.059> lift<00:00:33.210> all

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
into over here if we kind of lift all

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.120 
into over here if we kind of lift all
this<00:00:33.450> up<00:00:33.660> right<00:00:33.809> here<00:00:33.989> there's<00:00:34.350> a<00:00:34.410> branch<00:00:34.620> it's

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
this up right here there's a branch it's

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.049 
this up right here there's a branch it's
the<00:00:35.309> right<00:00:36.149> subclavian<00:00:36.480> artery<00:00:37.440> and<00:00:38.059> then

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
the right subclavian artery and then

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.910 
the right subclavian artery and then
going<00:00:39.960> up<00:00:40.050> either<00:00:40.200> side<00:00:40.500> of<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:40.620> neck<00:00:40.770> leave

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
going up either side of the neck leave

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.670 
going up either side of the neck leave
the<00:00:41.100> carotid<00:00:41.550> arteries<00:00:41.940> so<00:00:42.180> that<00:00:42.210> so<00:00:42.600> this<00:00:43.530> is

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
the carotid arteries so that so this is

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.740 
the carotid arteries so that so this is
the<00:00:43.800> right<00:00:44.129> common<00:00:44.520> carotid<00:00:44.640> artery<00:00:45.149> and<00:00:45.360> this

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
the right common carotid artery and this

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.330 
the right common carotid artery and this
over<00:00:45.930> here<00:00:46.020> is<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.260> left<00:00:46.469> common<00:00:47.100> carotid

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
over here is the left common carotid

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.139 
over here is the left common carotid
artery<00:00:47.940> so<00:00:48.480> so<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.170> right<00:00:49.320> subclavian<00:00:49.559> artery

00:00:50.139 --> 00:00:50.149 
artery so so the right subclavian artery

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:52.700 
artery so so the right subclavian artery
left<00:00:51.149> common<00:00:51.449> carotid<00:00:51.570> artery<00:00:52.050> or<00:00:52.260> right

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
left common carotid artery or right

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.139 
left common carotid artery or right
komak<00:00:52.980> artery<00:00:53.280> and<00:00:53.430> left<00:00:53.579> common<00:00:53.820> carotid<00:00:53.879> are

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
komak artery and left common carotid are

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:55.430 
komak artery and left common carotid are
all<00:00:54.539> branches<00:00:54.899> off<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.110> brachiocephalic

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
all branches off the brachiocephalic

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.279 
all branches off the brachiocephalic
artery<00:00:56.070> in<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.250> cat<00:00:56.520> then<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.690> second<00:00:58.109> branch

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
artery in the cat then the second branch

00:00:58.289 --> 00:00:59.900 
artery in the cat then the second branch
off<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:58.649> aorta<00:00:58.770> is<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.280> left<00:00:59.550> subclavian

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
off the aorta is the left subclavian

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.580 
off the aorta is the left subclavian
artery<00:01:00.600> it's<00:01:00.780> going<00:01:00.899> to<00:01:00.960> go<00:01:01.079> out<00:01:01.199> towards<00:01:01.530> the

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
artery it's going to go out towards the

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:02.810 
artery it's going to go out towards the
arm<00:01:01.739> and<00:01:01.920> then<00:01:02.039> branch<00:01:02.280> into<00:01:02.489> cement<00:01:02.730> of

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
arm and then branch into cement of

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.320 
arm and then branch into cement of
things<00:01:03.830> so<00:01:04.830> if<00:01:04.890> we<00:01:04.979> follow<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.400> aorta<00:01:05.880> down<00:01:06.060> so

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
things so if we follow the aorta down so

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.880 
things so if we follow the aorta down so
the<00:01:06.420> whole<00:01:06.570> vessel<00:01:06.780> is<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.110> aorta<00:01:07.560> coming<00:01:07.740> out

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
the whole vessel is the aorta coming out

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.109 
the whole vessel is the aorta coming out
of<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.070> heart<00:01:08.250> and<00:01:08.369> going<00:01:08.640> all<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:08.790> way<00:01:08.909> down

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
of the heart and going all the way down

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.490 
of the heart and going all the way down
before<00:01:09.240> it<00:01:09.420> branches<00:01:09.720> off<00:01:09.840> in<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.080> legs<00:01:10.290> but

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
before it branches off in the legs but

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.230 
before it branches off in the legs but
the<00:01:11.040> first<00:01:11.250> part<00:01:11.400> you<00:01:11.520> call<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:11.729> aortic<00:01:12.119> arch

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
the first part you call the aortic arch

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.469 
the first part you call the aortic arch
then<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.350> rest<00:01:13.560> of<00:01:13.680> this<00:01:13.740> part<00:01:14.010> up<00:01:14.130> here<00:01:14.479> above

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
then the rest of this part up here above

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.090 
then the rest of this part up here above
the<00:01:15.630> diaphragm<00:01:15.810> so<00:01:16.320> in<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:16.500> thoracic<00:01:16.650> body

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
the diaphragm so in the thoracic body

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.090 
the diaphragm so in the thoracic body
cavity<00:01:17.549> is<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.729> thoracic<00:01:18.450> aorta<00:01:19.020> and<00:01:19.320> then

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
cavity is the thoracic aorta and then

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.950 
cavity is the thoracic aorta and then
branching<00:01:20.610> off<00:01:20.729> of<00:01:20.759> that<00:01:21.090> are<00:01:21.720> the

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
branching off of that are the

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.020 
branching off of that are the
intercostal<00:01:22.799> arteries<00:01:23.250> so<00:01:23.490> there's<00:01:23.790> one

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
intercostal arteries so there's one

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:24.800 
intercostal arteries so there's one
right<00:01:24.479> there

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
right there

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.420 
right there
there's<00:01:25.439> other<00:01:25.650> ones<00:01:25.770> going<00:01:26.040> out<00:01:26.100> here<00:01:26.250> to<00:01:26.340> the

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
there's other ones going out here to the

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.149 
there's other ones going out here to the
intercostal<00:01:26.970> muscles<00:01:28.009> this<00:01:29.009> is<00:01:29.100> the

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
intercostal muscles this is the

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.609 
intercostal muscles this is the
diaphragm<00:01:29.780> and<00:01:30.780> so<00:01:31.110> above<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.470> diaphragm

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
diaphragm and so above the diaphragm

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.200 
diaphragm and so above the diaphragm
this<00:01:32.070> is<00:01:32.130> a<00:01:32.159> thoracic<00:01:32.400> body<00:01:32.759> cavity<00:01:33.090> below

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
this is a thoracic body cavity below

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.609 
this is a thoracic body cavity below
it's<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:33.509> abdominal<00:01:33.960> body<00:01:34.110> cavity<00:01:34.470> so

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
it's the abdominal body cavity so

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.140 
it's the abdominal body cavity so
whenever<00:01:34.860> that<00:01:34.979> a<00:01:35.040> aware<00:01:35.430> that<00:01:35.549> passes<00:01:36.030> across

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
whenever that a aware that passes across

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.179 
whenever that a aware that passes across
the<00:01:37.020> diaphragm<00:01:37.470> it<00:01:37.619> goes<00:01:37.740> into<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:37.979> abdominal

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
the diaphragm it goes into the abdominal

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:39.649 
the diaphragm it goes into the abdominal
body<00:01:38.520> cavity<00:01:38.909> it's<00:01:39.090> then<00:01:39.299> called<00:01:39.540> the

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
body cavity it's then called the

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.899 
body cavity it's then called the
abdominal<00:01:40.140> aorta<00:01:40.229> all<00:01:40.979> the<00:01:41.400> way<00:01:41.490> down<00:01:41.670> from

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
abdominal aorta all the way down from

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.910 
abdominal aorta all the way down from
there<00:01:42.180> so<00:01:42.750> where<00:01:42.930> it<00:01:43.020> splits<00:01:43.229> off<00:01:43.470> in<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:43.710> legs

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
there so where it splits off in the legs

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.760 
there so where it splits off in the legs
and<00:01:44.070> we'll<00:01:44.159> get<00:01:44.250> there<00:01:44.430> in<00:01:44.490> just<00:01:44.610> a<00:01:44.700> second<00:01:45.119> so

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
and we'll get there in just a second so

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.609 
and we'll get there in just a second so
right<00:01:46.770> after<00:01:47.630> this<00:01:48.630> is<00:01:48.810> sort<00:01:48.990> of<00:01:49.049> been<00:01:49.140> being

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
right after this is sort of been being

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.670 
right after this is sort of been being
cut<00:01:49.860> right<00:01:50.070> here<00:01:50.310> but<00:01:50.520> um<00:01:50.670> so<00:01:51.630> imagine<00:01:52.500> that<00:01:52.590> it

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
cut right here but um so imagine that it

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.170 
cut right here but um so imagine that it
hasn't<00:01:52.920> been<00:01:52.979> cut<00:01:53.220> so<00:01:53.549> we've<00:01:53.759> just<00:01:53.790> crossed

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
hasn't been cut so we've just crossed

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.420 
hasn't been cut so we've just crossed
into<00:01:55.079> the<00:01:55.290> abdominal<00:01:55.500> body<00:01:55.860> cavity<00:01:56.219> so<00:01:56.369> it

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
into the abdominal body cavity so it

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.069 
into the abdominal body cavity so it
becomes<00:01:56.670> the<00:01:56.759> abdominal<00:01:57.149> aorta<00:01:57.210> the<00:01:57.840> first

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
becomes the abdominal aorta the first

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.649 
becomes the abdominal aorta the first
main<00:01:58.320> branch<00:01:58.619> here<00:01:58.890> off<00:01:59.070> the<00:02:00.000> abdominal<00:02:00.630> aorta

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
main branch here off the abdominal aorta

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.020 
main branch here off the abdominal aorta
is<00:02:01.049> the<00:02:01.079> celiac<00:02:01.680> trunk<00:02:01.710> and<00:02:02.430> that's<00:02:02.820> going<00:02:02.969> to

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
is the celiac trunk and that's going to

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.670 
is the celiac trunk and that's going to
go<00:02:03.119> out<00:02:03.180> and<00:02:03.360> branch<00:02:03.540> into<00:02:03.869> the<00:02:04.020> splenic

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
go out and branch into the splenic

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:05.640 
go out and branch into the splenic
artery<00:02:04.979> and

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:05.650 
artery and

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:06.630 
artery and
some<00:02:05.770> other<00:02:05.890> things<00:02:05.950> but<00:02:06.370> we're<00:02:06.520> not

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
some other things but we're not

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:07.950 
some other things but we're not
concerning<00:02:07.060> ourselves<00:02:07.240> with<00:02:07.480> those<00:02:07.660> in<00:02:07.810> here

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:07.960 
concerning ourselves with those in here

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.260 
concerning ourselves with those in here
so<00:02:08.229> celiac<00:02:09.070> trunk<00:02:09.100> that<00:02:09.550> first<00:02:09.790> branch<00:02:10.119> off

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270 
so celiac trunk that first branch off

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:12.600 
so celiac trunk that first branch off
the<00:02:10.360> abdominal<00:02:10.750> aorta<00:02:11.140> then<00:02:12.040> the<00:02:12.190> second

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
the abdominal aorta then the second

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.760 
the abdominal aorta then the second
branch<00:02:12.790> is<00:02:12.970> going<00:02:13.120> to<00:02:13.180> be<00:02:13.330> the<00:02:13.990> superior

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
branch is going to be the superior

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:16.830 
branch is going to be the superior
mesenteric<00:02:15.160> artery<00:02:16.150> it's<00:02:16.390> going<00:02:16.600> to<00:02:16.660> come

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
mesenteric artery it's going to come

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.510 
mesenteric artery it's going to come
down<00:02:16.990> here<00:02:17.230> it's<00:02:17.830> going<00:02:17.950> to<00:02:18.010> branch<00:02:18.250> out<00:02:18.460> and

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
down here it's going to branch out and

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.030 
down here it's going to branch out and
it's<00:02:19.330> some<00:02:19.630> branches<00:02:20.200> that<00:02:20.290> to<00:02:20.470> the<00:02:20.560> mesentery

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
it's some branches that to the mesentery

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.360 
it's some branches that to the mesentery
so<00:02:21.280> this<00:02:21.580> is<00:02:21.670> the<00:02:22.680> you<00:02:23.680> know<00:02:23.710> the<00:02:23.890> intestines

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
so this is the you know the intestines

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.100 
so this is the you know the intestines
out<00:02:24.490> here<00:02:24.790> and<00:02:25.420> so<00:02:25.570> all<00:02:25.690> the<00:02:25.810> stuff<00:02:25.990> in<00:02:26.080> between

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
out here and so all the stuff in between

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:27.630 
out here and so all the stuff in between
this<00:02:26.500> mesentery<00:02:27.010> and<00:02:27.130> all<00:02:27.190> these<00:02:27.280> little<00:02:27.400> peak

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
this mesentery and all these little peak

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.280 
this mesentery and all these little peak
geyser<00:02:27.940> branches<00:02:28.540> that<00:02:28.690> superior<00:02:28.990> mesenteric

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
geyser branches that superior mesenteric

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:30.840 
geyser branches that superior mesenteric

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
artery and there's an inferior

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:33.300 
artery and there's an inferior
mesenteric<00:02:31.000> artery<00:02:31.630> also<00:02:31.900> but<00:02:32.110> but<00:02:32.320> um<00:02:32.440> that

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
mesenteric artery also but but um that

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.130 
mesenteric artery also but but um that
comes<00:02:33.910> down<00:02:34.150> here<00:02:34.330> as<00:02:34.420> well<00:02:34.540> then<00:02:34.780> anyway<00:02:34.960> but

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
comes down here as well then anyway but

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:36.180 
comes down here as well then anyway but
we're<00:02:35.230> not<00:02:35.350> we're<00:02:35.530> not<00:02:35.560> learning<00:02:35.830> that<00:02:36.040> for

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
we're not we're not learning that for

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.730 
we're not we're not learning that for
this<00:02:36.310> practical<00:02:36.940> um<00:02:37.900> so<00:02:38.140> okay<00:02:38.320> anyway<00:02:38.709> so

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:38.740

you<00:02:42.670> come<00:02:42.820> down<00:02:43.000> here<00:02:43.209> and<00:02:43.390> then<00:02:43.540> we<00:02:43.600> have

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
you come down here and then we have

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.480 
you come down here and then we have

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:45.490 
branches that go out to the kidneys so

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:47.040 
branches that go out to the kidneys so
this<00:02:45.670> is<00:02:45.760> a<00:02:45.820> kidney<00:02:46.120> that<00:02:46.240> has<00:02:46.450> some<00:02:46.900> blue

this is a kidney that has some blue

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:49.080 
this is a kidney that has some blue

going to be the left renal artery that

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:55.980 
going to be the left renal artery that

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:55.990 
goes out here to the kidney and then

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:58.020 
goes out here to the kidney and then
there's<00:02:56.170> a<00:02:56.230> right<00:02:56.650> renal<00:02:57.010> artery<00:02:57.340> over<00:02:57.580> here

there's a right renal artery over here

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.210 
there's a right renal artery over here
that<00:02:58.240> you<00:02:58.959> can't<00:02:59.230> see<00:02:59.530> as<00:02:59.680> well<00:02:59.890> because<00:03:00.100> it's

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
the right kidney and we keep coming down

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:05.250 
the right kidney and we keep coming down
there's<00:03:04.300> some<00:03:04.390> other<00:03:04.510> branches<00:03:04.959> that<00:03:05.110> we're

not concerning ourselves with and then

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.210

we<00:03:07.870> get<00:03:07.959> down<00:03:08.140> to<00:03:08.230> the<00:03:08.380> legs<00:03:08.590> and<00:03:08.890> then<00:03:09.100> it

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
we get down to the legs and then it

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.640 
we get down to the legs and then it

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.360 
branches that donnelly order branches
into<00:03:11.830> the<00:03:12.070> the<00:03:12.760> left<00:03:13.200> external<00:03:14.200> iliac<00:03:14.800> artery

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
into the the left external iliac artery

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.840 
into the the left external iliac artery
and<00:03:15.550> the<00:03:16.000> right<00:03:16.209> external<00:03:17.019> iliac<00:03:17.290> artery<00:03:17.850> so

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:18.850 
and the right external iliac artery so

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:20.340 
and the right external iliac artery so
it's<00:03:19.060> external<00:03:19.330> iliac<00:03:19.690> artery<00:03:20.019> till<00:03:20.260> about

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:20.350 
it's external iliac artery till about

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:21.780 
it's external iliac artery till about
right<00:03:20.739> there<00:03:20.950> we<00:03:21.100> have<00:03:21.130> this<00:03:21.370> other<00:03:21.550> branch

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
right there we have this other branch

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.520 
right there we have this other branch
right<00:03:22.150> here<00:03:22.209> after<00:03:22.570> that<00:03:22.690> branch<00:03:23.019> it<00:03:23.230> becomes

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
right here after that branch it becomes

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.440 
right here after that branch it becomes
the<00:03:23.680> femoral<00:03:24.130> artery<00:03:24.700> right<00:03:24.970> it<00:03:25.120> right<00:03:25.269> here

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
the femoral artery right it right here

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.870 
the femoral artery right it right here
with<00:03:25.510> a<00:03:25.600> femur<00:03:25.870> is<00:03:26.140> and<00:03:26.440> this<00:03:26.950> femoral<00:03:27.430> artery

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:27.880 
with a femur is and this femoral artery

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:28.979 
with a femur is and this femoral artery
right<00:03:28.030> in<00:03:28.180> there<00:03:28.330> and<00:03:28.570> then<00:03:28.780> we're<00:03:28.870> not

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:28.989 
right in there and then we're not

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:30.060 
right in there and then we're not
learning<00:03:29.170> the<00:03:29.350> rest<00:03:29.440> of<00:03:29.650> them<00:03:29.739> down<00:03:29.860> in<00:03:30.010> the

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.070 
learning the rest of them down in the

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:35.759 
learning the rest of them down in the
way<00:03:32.190> okay<00:03:33.190> so<00:03:33.250> uh<00:03:34.410> sometimes<00:03:35.410> you<00:03:35.590> can't

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:35.769 
way okay so uh sometimes you can't

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:38.699 
way okay so uh sometimes you can't
really<00:03:36.010> see<00:03:36.220> the<00:03:36.580> internal<00:03:37.570> jugular<00:03:38.170> vein<00:03:38.320> of

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:38.709 
really see the internal jugular vein of

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:40.680 
really see the internal jugular vein of
everything<00:03:39.040> I've<00:03:39.130> every<00:03:39.310> cat<00:03:39.519> so<00:03:39.850> um<00:03:40.090> so<00:03:40.570> we're

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.690 
everything I've every cat so um so we're

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:42.449 
everything I've every cat so um so we're
just<00:03:40.720> gonna<00:03:40.870> call<00:03:41.110> this<00:03:41.350> the<00:03:41.860> jugular<00:03:42.190> vein

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:42.459 
just gonna call this the jugular vein

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:44.550 
just gonna call this the jugular vein
coming<00:03:43.269> down<00:03:43.480> here<00:03:43.750> from<00:03:43.870> from<00:03:44.260> the<00:03:44.380> head

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
coming down here from from the head

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.120 
coming down here from from the head
jugular<00:03:45.430> vein<00:03:45.610> and<00:03:45.820> then<00:03:46.540> we<00:03:46.720> have<00:03:47.130> the

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:48.130 
jugular vein and then we have the

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:50.670 
jugular vein and then we have the
supposed<00:03:49.060> to<00:03:49.150> be<00:03:49.239> that<00:03:49.510> left<00:03:50.170> checking<00:03:50.470> on<00:03:50.620> the

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680 
supposed to be that left checking on the

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.490 
supposed to be that left checking on the
right<00:03:50.799> gently<00:03:51.190> and<00:03:51.489> then<00:03:52.150> over<00:03:53.049> here<00:03:53.080> we<00:03:53.350> have

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
right gently and then over here we have

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.830 
right gently and then over here we have
the<00:03:53.680> right<00:03:53.920> subclavian<00:03:54.220> vein<00:03:54.850> left

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 
the right subclavian vein left

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.750 
the right subclavian vein left
subclavian<00:03:56.049> vein<00:03:56.709> and<00:03:57.010> then<00:03:57.549> those<00:03:57.730> are

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
subclavian vein and then those are

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.930 
subclavian vein and then those are
meeting<00:03:58.269> up<00:03:58.420> with<00:03:58.739> the<00:03:59.739> jugular<00:04:00.160> veins<00:04:00.459> to

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:00.940 
meeting up with the jugular veins to

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:02.759 
meeting up with the jugular veins to
form<00:04:01.180> the<00:04:01.299> brachiocephalic<00:04:01.720> vein<00:04:02.380> so<00:04:02.590> there's

00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:02.769 
form the brachiocephalic vein so there's

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:04.350 
form the brachiocephalic vein so there's
two<00:04:02.920> brachiocephalic<00:04:03.370> veins<00:04:03.940> even<00:04:04.120> though<00:04:04.299> is

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:04.360 
two brachiocephalic veins even though is

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:07.620 
two brachiocephalic veins even though is
only<00:04:04.510> one<00:04:04.720> brachiocephalic<00:04:05.080> artery<00:04:06.120> and<00:04:07.120> so

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:07.630 
only one brachiocephalic artery and so

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:09.780 
only one brachiocephalic artery and so
this<00:04:07.810> would<00:04:07.930> be<00:04:08.049> the<00:04:08.260> left<00:04:09.220> brachiocephalic

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:09.790 
this would be the left brachiocephalic

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:12.949 
this would be the left brachiocephalic
vein<00:04:10.480> right<00:04:11.140> brachiocephalic<00:04:11.410> vein

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 
vein right brachiocephalic vein

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:15.740 
vein right brachiocephalic vein
empty<00:04:13.739> into<00:04:14.159> the<00:04:14.340> superior<00:04:14.790> vena<00:04:15.090> cava<00:04:15.239> this

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
empty into the superior vena cava this

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:16.909 
empty into the superior vena cava this
is<00:04:15.810> gonna<00:04:15.989> go<00:04:16.079> into<00:04:16.199> the<00:04:16.259> right<00:04:16.410> atrium<00:04:16.470> of<00:04:16.859> the

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 
is gonna go into the right atrium of the

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:20.629 
is gonna go into the right atrium of the
heart<00:04:17.870> and<00:04:18.870> and<00:04:19.620> so<00:04:19.829> then<00:04:20.009> everything<00:04:20.489> down

00:04:20.629 --> 00:04:20.639 
heart and and so then everything down

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:23.450 
heart and and so then everything down
here<00:04:21.090> from<00:04:21.630> the<00:04:21.810> legs<00:04:22.019> and<00:04:22.470> then<00:04:22.710> that<00:04:22.919> the<00:04:23.190> the

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
here from the legs and then that the the

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.550 
here from the legs and then that the the
trunk<00:04:23.729> of<00:04:23.820> the<00:04:23.880> body<00:04:23.970> like<00:04:24.210> in<00:04:24.330> the<00:04:24.419> epilim<00:04:24.780> I'm

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
trunk of the body like in the epilim I'm

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.800 
trunk of the body like in the epilim I'm
so<00:04:25.830> the<00:04:26.100> chocolate<00:04:26.250> in<00:04:26.550> the<00:04:26.639> abdomen<00:04:27.570> of<00:04:27.690> the

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:27.810 
so the chocolate in the abdomen of the

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:29.360 
so the chocolate in the abdomen of the
cat<00:04:28.020> it's<00:04:28.530> all<00:04:28.680> gonna<00:04:28.800> be<00:04:28.889> empty<00:04:29.009> into<00:04:29.280> the

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 
cat it's all gonna be empty into the

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:32.480 
cat it's all gonna be empty into the
inferior<00:04:29.820> vena<00:04:30.150> cava<00:04:30.650> so<00:04:31.650> on<00:04:31.919> the<00:04:32.070> legs<00:04:32.280> is

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.490 
inferior vena cava so on the legs is

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:35.420 
inferior vena cava so on the legs is
where<00:04:32.639> it<00:04:32.699> gets<00:04:32.850> tricky<00:04:33.889> so<00:04:34.889> right<00:04:35.070> here<00:04:35.280> where

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.430 
where it gets tricky so right here where

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.939 
where it gets tricky so right here where
the<00:04:35.490> femoral<00:04:36.350> artery<00:04:37.350> is<00:04:37.530> there's<00:04:37.830> the

00:04:37.939 --> 00:04:37.949 
the femoral artery is there's the

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:40.159 
the femoral artery is there's the
femoral<00:04:38.280> vein<00:04:38.580> right<00:04:38.940> next<00:04:39.270> to<00:04:39.360> it<00:04:39.389> and<00:04:39.690> then

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:40.169 
femoral vein right next to it and then

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:42.860 
femoral vein right next to it and then
we<00:04:40.289> have<00:04:40.470> the<00:04:41.340> actually<00:04:42.240> the<00:04:42.389> deep<00:04:42.570> femoral

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:42.870 
we have the actually the deep femoral

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:44.090 
we have the actually the deep femoral
vein<00:04:43.080> which<00:04:43.259> we're<00:04:43.440> not<00:04:43.530> learned<00:04:43.740> that<00:04:43.919> comes

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:44.100 
vein which we're not learned that comes

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:45.529 
vein which we're not learned that comes
up<00:04:44.220> and<00:04:44.310> joins<00:04:44.550> with<00:04:44.759> it<00:04:44.910> and<00:04:45.060> it<00:04:45.150> becomes<00:04:45.360> the

00:04:45.529 --> 00:04:45.539 
up and joins with it and it becomes the

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:49.040 
up and joins with it and it becomes the
external<00:04:46.229> iliac<00:04:46.800> vein<00:04:47.750> then<00:04:48.750> there's<00:04:48.930> an

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.050 
external iliac vein then there's an

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:51.050 
external iliac vein then there's an
internal<00:04:49.650> iliac<00:04:50.039> vein<00:04:50.430> of<00:04:50.550> the<00:04:50.610> cat<00:04:50.850> that's

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060 
internal iliac vein of the cat that's

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:54.110 
internal iliac vein of the cat that's
very<00:04:51.330> deep<00:04:51.630> about<00:04:51.960> it<00:04:52.320> right<00:04:52.940> then<00:04:53.940> we<00:04:54.030> have

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 
very deep about it right then we have

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.150 
very deep about it right then we have
the<00:04:54.210> internal<00:04:54.660> iliac<00:04:54.900> vein<00:04:55.169> down<00:04:55.440> inside<00:04:55.860> here

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:56.160 
the internal iliac vein down inside here

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.010 
the internal iliac vein down inside here
that<00:04:56.460> joins<00:04:57.060> up<00:04:57.240> with<00:04:57.270> the<00:04:57.389> external<00:04:57.780> iliac

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:58.020 
that joins up with the external iliac

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:00.110 
that joins up with the external iliac
vein<00:04:58.229> to<00:04:58.380> form<00:04:58.590> the<00:04:58.740> common<00:04:59.250> iliac<00:04:59.580> vein<00:04:59.940> and

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.120 
vein to form the common iliac vein and

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.870

then we're going back up towards the

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.219 
then we're going back up towards the

along<00:05:28.560> the<00:05:28.680> way<00:05:28.909> we<00:05:29.909> have<00:05:30.120> the<00:05:30.300> this<00:05:30.870> would<00:05:31.050> be

00:05:31.129 --> 00:05:31.139 
along the way we have the this would be

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:34.580 
along the way we have the this would be

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:39.080 
that and vena cava then we go up here

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:40.969 
that and vena cava then we go up here
and<00:05:40.080> there's<00:05:40.260> stuff<00:05:40.470> in<00:05:40.590> here<00:05:40.620> that<00:05:40.770> we're<00:05:40.949> not

00:05:40.969 --> 00:05:40.979 
and there's stuff in here that we're not

00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:43.430 
and there's stuff in here that we're not
talking<00:05:41.460> about<00:05:41.490> but<00:05:42.330> you<00:05:42.449> can<00:05:42.570> see<00:05:42.750> the<00:05:42.900> so

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:43.440 
talking about but you can see the so

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:44.930 
talking about but you can see the so
right<00:05:43.770> here<00:05:43.919> this<00:05:44.010> is<00:05:44.159> sort<00:05:44.400> of<00:05:44.460> that<00:05:44.610> sort<00:05:44.909> of

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:44.940 
right here this is sort of that sort of

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:47.089 
right here this is sort of that sort of
explode<00:05:45.360> right<00:05:45.630> here<00:05:45.810> with<00:05:45.960> latex<00:05:46.320> but<00:05:46.620> but

00:05:47.089 --> 00:05:47.099 
explode right here with latex but but

00:05:47.099 --> 00:05:49.460 
explode right here with latex but but
this<00:05:47.340> is<00:05:47.520> where<00:05:47.699> the<00:05:47.849> inferior<00:05:48.810> vena<00:05:48.930> cava<00:05:49.050> is

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:49.470 
this is where the inferior vena cava is

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:50.930 
this is where the inferior vena cava is
and<00:05:49.800> that's<00:05:49.979> going<00:05:50.130> to<00:05:50.190> go<00:05:50.280> up<00:05:50.430> so<00:05:50.729> it<00:05:50.789> goes

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:50.940 
and that's going to go up so it goes

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:52.370 
and that's going to go up so it goes
around<00:05:51.090> the<00:05:51.300> sort<00:05:51.690> of<00:05:51.750> like<00:05:51.870> the<00:05:51.960> backside<00:05:52.349> of

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:52.380 
around the sort of like the backside of

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:54.140 
around the sort of like the backside of
the<00:05:52.470> liver<00:05:52.680> and<00:05:52.919> also<00:05:53.430> have<00:05:53.639> tea<00:05:53.760> seems<00:05:53.909> to<00:05:54.060> be

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:54.150 
the liver and also have tea seems to be

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:56.420 
the liver and also have tea seems to be
a<00:05:54.180> right<00:05:54.449> atrium<00:05:54.900> of<00:05:55.199> the<00:05:55.800> heart<00:05:55.889> and<00:05:56.190> then<00:05:56.370> we

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:56.430 
a right atrium of the heart and then we

00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:00.210 
a right atrium of the heart and then we
have<00:05:56.550> one<00:05:56.729> more<00:05:56.909> vein<00:05:57.289> to<00:05:58.289> look<00:05:58.650> at

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:00.220 
have one more vein to look at

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:04.270 
have one more vein to look at
this<00:06:01.220> kidney<00:06:01.669> around<00:06:02.800> so<00:06:03.800> on<00:06:03.950> the<00:06:04.040> right<00:06:04.250> side

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:04.280 
this kidney around so on the right side

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:07.450 
this kidney around so on the right side
of<00:06:04.760> the<00:06:04.820> body<00:06:05.000> if<00:06:05.720> it's<00:06:05.900> on<00:06:06.169> the<00:06:06.710> dorsal<00:06:07.310> side

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:07.460 
of the body if it's on the dorsal side

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:09.430 
of the body if it's on the dorsal side
of<00:06:07.520> that<00:06:07.610> thoracic<00:06:08.090> body<00:06:08.630> cavity<00:06:09.020> we<00:06:09.200> have<00:06:09.320> the

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:09.440 
of that thoracic body cavity we have the

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:11.770 
of that thoracic body cavity we have the
azygos<00:06:09.980> vein<00:06:10.130> and<00:06:10.910> that<00:06:11.180> comes<00:06:11.389> up<00:06:11.540> here<00:06:11.720> and

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:11.780 
azygos vein and that comes up here and

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:13.270 
azygos vein and that comes up here and
it<00:06:11.990> meets<00:06:12.110> up<00:06:12.260> with<00:06:12.320> the<00:06:12.440> superior<00:06:12.919> vena<00:06:13.010> cava

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:13.280 
it meets up with the superior vena cava

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:16.210 
it meets up with the superior vena cava
right<00:06:13.580> before<00:06:13.820> it<00:06:13.880> goes<00:06:14.000> in
