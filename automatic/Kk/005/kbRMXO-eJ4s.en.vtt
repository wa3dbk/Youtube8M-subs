00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.879 
we just have had typical discussions and
all<00:00:08.700> the<00:00:08.820> things<00:00:09.030> on<00:00:09.179> football<00:00:09.420> and<00:00:09.750> and<00:00:10.620> where

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
all the things on football and and where

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:12.430 
all the things on football and and where
where<00:00:11.490> we're<00:00:11.639> at<00:00:11.670> what<00:00:12.000> we've<00:00:12.150> done<00:00:12.330> and

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:12.440 
where we're at what we've done and

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.480 
where we're at what we've done and
progress<00:00:13.440> we've<00:00:13.620> made<00:00:13.650> which<00:00:14.040> there's<00:00:14.250> been<00:00:14.460> a

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490

lot and so I think that those are
obvious<00:00:17.430> things<00:00:17.699> and<00:00:18.140> really<00:00:19.140> man<00:00:19.890> there's<00:00:20.100> a

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
obvious things and really man there's a

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.330

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
a big rebuilding project isn't a typical

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.719 
a big rebuilding project isn't a typical
rebuilding<00:01:46.500> project<00:01:46.890> in<00:01:46.979> that<00:01:47.100> regard<00:01:47.460> just

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
rebuilding project in that regard just

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.730 
rebuilding project in that regard just
because<00:01:48.000> of<00:01:48.149> what<00:01:48.299> what<00:01:48.689> was<00:01:48.810> was<00:01:49.200> there<00:01:49.500> but

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
because of what what was was there but

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.810 
because of what what was was there but
what<00:01:50.670> I<00:01:50.700> can<00:01:50.970> say<00:01:51.000> is<00:01:51.509> that<00:01:52.100> I<00:01:53.100> really<00:01:53.640> felt

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
what I can say is that I really felt

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.429 
what I can say is that I really felt
this<00:01:53.970> was<00:01:54.149> a<00:01:54.210> team<00:01:54.689> that<00:01:54.720> could<00:01:54.990> make<00:01:55.170> a<00:01:55.200> bowl

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
this was a team that could make a bowl

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:56.959 
this was a team that could make a bowl
this<00:01:55.590> year<00:01:55.649> but<00:01:56.009> we<00:01:56.100> needed<00:01:56.369> to<00:01:56.430> happy<00:01:56.729> healthy

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
this year but we needed to happy healthy

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.459 
this year but we needed to happy healthy
at<00:01:57.210> the<00:01:57.299> quarterback<00:01:57.570> position<00:01:57.719> all<00:01:58.290> year

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
at the quarterback position all year

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.740 
at the quarterback position all year
have<00:01:58.649> some<00:01:58.829> continuity<00:01:59.219> there<00:01:59.640> and<00:02:00.509> I<00:02:00.570> think

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
have some continuity there and I think

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.749 
have some continuity there and I think
we<00:02:00.840> missed<00:02:00.960> out<00:02:01.170> because<00:02:01.350> of<00:02:01.649> that<00:02:01.829> I<00:02:02.040> thought

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
we missed out because of that I thought

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.389 
we missed out because of that I thought
we<00:02:02.939> were<00:02:03.030> capable<00:02:03.240> of<00:02:03.540> six<00:02:03.780> or<00:02:03.869> seven<00:02:04.170> wins

00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:04.399 
we were capable of six or seven wins

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:06.740 
we were capable of six or seven wins
knowing<00:02:05.399> all<00:02:05.520> the<00:02:05.610> players<00:02:05.820> are<00:02:06.090> back<00:02:06.299> and<00:02:06.630> no

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
knowing all the players are back and no

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.190 
knowing all the players are back and no
one<00:02:06.930> no<00:02:07.350> one

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
one no one

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.830 
one no one
or<00:02:08.310> the<00:02:09.310> growth<00:02:09.550> is<00:02:09.729> coming<00:02:09.940> from<00:02:10.270> and<00:02:10.539> the

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
or the growth is coming from and the

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.930 
or the growth is coming from and the
guys<00:02:10.989> coming<00:02:11.319> back<00:02:11.530> to<00:02:11.830> emerge<00:02:12.190> and<00:02:12.370> improve<00:02:12.730> I

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
guys coming back to emerge and improve I

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:14.580 
guys coming back to emerge and improve I
think<00:02:13.390> this<00:02:13.540> is<00:02:13.629> a<00:02:13.660> team<00:02:13.870> that<00:02:13.900> can<00:02:14.140> win<00:02:14.319> you

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
think this is a team that can win you

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.890 
think this is a team that can win you
