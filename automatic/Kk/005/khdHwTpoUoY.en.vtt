00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.820
 hello to all and all these evils 

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:11.650
 reagan we end up so for the 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:14.080
 second part my tutorial on the new 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:15.490
 raid the fall of croo pts so has this 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.110
 once again we come back as I 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:19.570
 you told the adar once on a step 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:21.070
 who plays a lot on the activated bridge 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:22.540
 with the platforms 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:24.520
 so we really have two parts 

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:27.310
 separated by a bridge and he'll have to 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:29.020
 play on the fact that we have 6 so we have 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:31.059
 a platform in the middle 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:32.410
 on the bridge so if we go on this 

00:00:31.059 --> 00:00:33.790
 platform must at all costs 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:36.670
 also on the two points that there is 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:38.050
 on the sides so I keep one on 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.090
 the video you'll see where it's 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.769
 to prevent them from getting 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:43.420
 triggers to a phenomenon that kills any 

00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:45.010
 the team simply it becomes 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.899
 red actually at these pylons 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.280
 and if these pylons are activated by hand 

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:50.440
 the whole team and you have to stay 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.570
 above for the fire to be able to 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.910
 maintain the bridge without any 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.530
 the team dies so when the bridge effect 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:58.690
 you are going to see the bridge is built 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:00.129
 we must not go before of course and 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:01.989
 so to be able to cross this bridge of 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:03.609
 anyway you need a sword that goes 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:06.270
 have to recover on the sword bearer 

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:09.490
 which appears fairly frequently enough 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.540
 so level 31 like all the enemies of 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.869
 this part of the raid 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:16.090
 so you have to put slaves on the 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:17.290
 bearer of the pay of the knights of 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:18.759
 the other side we also have other 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:22.119
 enemies I'm going to talk about right after 

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:23.979
 so what happens is the strategy that 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:25.570
 we have adopted so we are two 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:28.210
 people who keep the platforms 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:30.909
 a person who activates the bridge the 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:33.700
 others are mobile and so go all 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:35.200
 just then you are the bearer of this 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.670
 what will happen then is that the 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.990
 nobody who will recover the sword is going 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:38.979
 cross the bridge must the bridge be 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.170
 built at that time false 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:43.869
 coordinates will go to hide from 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:45.939
 the other side lama so you have to go 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:46.539
 towards the bottom left or right is 

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:48.490
 true that the enemies appear 

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:50.259
 randomly left or right they 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.729
 come out of the fund gates so if 

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:53.770
 it's not the good side just go 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:55.240
 on the other side and you wait 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.799
 normally the enemies on the other side 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.600
 do not attack yourself if you are at home 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:01:59.229
 bottom of the soul so that's good 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.179
 convenient 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:02.979
 then same thing for the second 

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:05.500
 who also passes a 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:06.729
 third member of the team passes alas 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.160
 what will happen is that so the 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:10.929
 three who maintained the bridge of the first 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.690
 art side is to maintain this bridge 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:14.110
 can go up on the side 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.030
 two 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.040
 of the map on the left side to be 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.890
 quiet and there it is the turn of those 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:23.320
 who went through to activate the bridge so 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.120
 exactly the same way there are two 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:27.250
 platforms maintain if not any 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.950
 the team is dying there is this platform 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.970
 which is built on the other hand if you 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.100
 to go to the other side you have to 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.870
 prepare the enemies are stronger than 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.850
 on the first side so it's true he 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.740
 better to leave the lowest level of 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.720
 first side and pass the most 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:43.209
 high level first and so you go 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.459
 have knights felt proud even a 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:47.200
 enemy who is called m then describes that 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:49.840
 yet it is a deer and sanctified 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.640
 so all at level 31 again enough 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.320
 hard to knock down what we 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.850
 did it is we did not care too much 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:56.830
 preoccupied with his enemies in the end they are 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:59.890
 rather simply avoided 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:01.330
 using the jumps the invisibility the 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.550
 titan bubbles if you have any 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:05.770
 did not have the resurrection that can 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:07.959
 well helped of course and so once 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:09.430
 the point built on the second side those 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:11.110
 who had stayed on the first side 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:12.970
 must again retrieved a sword on 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:14.890
 a dp carrier you need to be sync 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:16.239
 Thursday once but the idea is 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:17.560
 to really sync of course 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:20.110
 again it's very important 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:23.080
 to have his microphone in the raid still has 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:24.670
 more in this one is so to turn of 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:26.890
 role the people you go from again to 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.299
 the other side to know that when the 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:29.920
 first went to paris 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:32.890
 new enemy who is therefore a priestess 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:34.959
 so with a fire shield that goes 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:36.220
 we must therefore have to go 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:38.230
 protect those here you can 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:40.120
 eventually kill her because he does 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:42.100
 still a lot of damage then 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:45.250
 so pass the other people 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:47.980
 is here to finish the level this 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:49.450
 state there are going to be two works 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.920
 works that are going to appear 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:52.209
 and you have to get rid of it faster 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.250
 possible because they hurt well 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:55.870
 heard and once the trees are 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:56.890
 killed that's it we can move on as a result 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:58.720
 in August 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:00.790
 so I was listening to the dream boots 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.650
 I was very happy you will see in 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:06.190
 the screen that my aisles or also not bad 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:08.290
 woman to him stuff so so there 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:11.290
 then there is one last little step 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:12.850
 for a transition actually between this 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:14.829
 step number two is step number 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:17.560
 three and consisted through this one 

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:19.870
 hallway with slaves in fairly large 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:22.150
 number and lookouts but that's enough 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:25.150
 simple there is nothing exceptional about 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:26.730
 this state to know that I find that 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:28.140
 when the lookouts exploded 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:30.210
 you know they make these species of 

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:32.280
 tracer balls that are ready for you 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:33.960
 explode in the face by making 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.130
 lateral movements so left right 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.140
 left right as you will see me 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:39.960
 to do on the screen it works rather well 

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:41.640
 I amelle amelle and its species of 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:44.520
 earplugs she sent when she 

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:47.100
 dies so I advise you to do that 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:48.540
 of course so in the end this second 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:51.390
 part is not very complicated it's 

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:54.420
 simply coordinate and know 

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:56.130
 the strategy of two displacements so 

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:57.450
 I hope it has been helpful if 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:59.640
 this is the case do not hesitate to comment to 

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:02.040
 share and I find again very quickly to 

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:04.460
 following this tutorial and for all 

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:04.460
 other videos
