going<00:00:00.179> to<00:00:00.269> be<00:00:00.359> the<00:00:00.920> external<00:00:01.920> loop<00:00:02.570> right<00:00:03.570> and

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:03.840 
going to be the external loop right and

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.260 
going to be the external loop right and
in<00:00:04.200> in<00:00:04.440> the<00:00:04.710> inner<00:00:04.950> loop<00:00:05.250> we're<00:00:05.879> going<00:00:05.910> to<00:00:06.060> loop

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
in in the inner loop we're going to loop

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.709 
in in the inner loop we're going to loop
through<00:00:06.540> the<00:00:07.529> width<00:00:07.859> right<00:00:08.340> going<00:00:08.700> from<00:00:08.970> 0<00:00:09.660> 0

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
through the width right going from 0 0

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:16.129 
through the width right going from 0 0
to<00:00:10.550> 641<00:00:11.630> 640<00:00:12.630> to<00:00:12.960> 640<00:00:13.860> so<00:00:14.340> now<00:00:14.490> we<00:00:14.549> have<00:00:15.139> this

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
to 641 640 to 640 so now we have this

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.620 
to 641 640 to 640 so now we have this
loop<00:00:16.500> that<00:00:16.529> we're<00:00:16.890> going<00:00:17.039> through<00:00:17.570> now<00:00:18.570> we

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
loop that we're going through now we

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:25.460 
loop that we're going through now we
have<00:00:19.020> a<00:00:22.880> method<00:00:23.880> here<00:00:24.180> that<00:00:24.359> we've<00:00:24.810> built<00:00:25.080> and

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
have a method here that we've built and

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.910 
have a method here that we've built and
what<00:00:26.369> it's<00:00:26.490> going<00:00:26.580> to<00:00:26.730> do<00:00:26.970> is<00:00:27.269> is<00:00:27.920> calculate

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
what it's going to do is is calculate

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.780 
what it's going to do is is calculate
the<00:00:29.220> distance<00:00:30.590> with<00:00:31.590> a<00:00:31.619> player<00:00:32.040> index<00:00:32.430> so<00:00:32.669> we

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
the distance with a player index so we

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.549 
the distance with a player index so we
show<00:00:32.940> two<00:00:33.180> formulas<00:00:33.660> before<00:00:34.050> this<00:00:34.290> is<00:00:34.410> going

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
show two formulas before this is going

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.750 
show two formulas before this is going
to<00:00:34.620> be<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:34.829> formula<00:00:36.980> let's<00:00:37.980> just<00:00:38.219> jump<00:00:38.489> to<00:00:38.640> it

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
to be the formula let's just jump to it

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.380 
to be the formula let's just jump to it
formula<00:00:39.270> for<00:00:39.510> calculating<00:00:40.379> with<00:00:40.590> depth<00:00:41.390> depth

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
formula for calculating with depth depth

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.110 
formula for calculating with depth depth
distance<00:00:43.350> with<00:00:43.500> player<00:00:43.739> index<00:00:44.100> so<00:00:44.789> remember

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
distance with player index so remember

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.760 
distance with player index so remember
we<00:00:45.239> have<00:00:45.329> to<00:00:45.450> pass<00:00:45.629> in<00:00:45.840> two<00:00:46.050> frames<00:00:46.289> at<00:00:46.469> a<00:00:46.530> time

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
we have to pass in two frames at a time

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.979 
we have to pass in two frames at a time
so<00:00:47.160> for<00:00:47.340> point<00:00:47.460> zero<00:00:47.760> zero<00:00:47.820> we<00:00:48.539> pass<00:00:48.780> in<00:00:48.960> the

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
so for point zero zero we pass in the

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.369 
so for point zero zero we pass in the
first<00:00:49.260> byte<00:00:49.590> and<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:50.460> second<00:00:50.850> byte<00:00:51.170> we<00:00:52.170> do

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
first byte and the second byte we do

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.450 
first byte and the second byte we do
this<00:00:52.530> bit<00:00:52.800> shifting<00:00:53.190> operator<00:00:53.670> operation

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:55.460 
this bit shifting operator operation

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.119 
this bit shifting operator operation
make<00:00:56.460> sure<00:00:56.610> to<00:00:56.699> do<00:00:56.789> this<00:00:56.940> to<00:00:57.859> account<00:00:58.859> for<00:00:58.949> the

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
make sure to do this to account for the

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.389 
make sure to do this to account for the
player<00:00:59.340> index<00:00:59.699> being<00:00:59.940> in<00:01:00.980> depth<00:01:01.980> with<00:01:02.129> player

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
player index being in depth with player

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.240 
player index being in depth with player
index<00:01:02.730> and<00:01:02.969> we<00:01:03.180> return<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:03.899> distance<00:01:04.350> so<00:01:05.129> at

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
index and we return the distance so at

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.710 
index and we return the distance so at
this<00:01:05.430> point<00:01:06.110> let's<00:01:07.110> just<00:01:07.250> scroll<00:01:08.250> back<00:01:08.720> four

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
this point let's just scroll back four

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.140 
this point let's just scroll back four
point<00:01:09.930> zero<00:01:10.020> zero<00:01:10.290> we<00:01:10.799> now<00:01:11.100> know<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.670> distance

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
point zero zero we now know the distance

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.420 
point zero zero we now know the distance
and<00:01:12.470> this<00:01:13.470> is<00:01:13.650> where<00:01:13.799> we're<00:01:14.010> choosing<00:01:14.189> the

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
and this is where we're choosing the

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.070 
and this is where we're choosing the
colorization<00:01:14.790> so<00:01:15.210> this<00:01:15.360> is<00:01:15.479> where<00:01:15.630> you<00:01:15.869> all

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
colorization so this is where you all

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.719 
colorization so this is where you all
can<00:01:16.560> do<00:01:16.650> this<00:01:16.799> and<00:01:16.979> this<00:01:17.070> is<00:01:17.189> just<00:01:17.369> a<00:01:17.490> very

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
can do this and this is just a very

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.990 
can do this and this is just a very
basic<00:01:18.049> colorization<00:01:19.640> we<00:01:20.640> mentioned<00:01:20.939> the

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
basic colorization we mentioned the

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.780 
basic colorization we mentioned the
range<00:01:21.210> is<00:01:21.360> 850<00:01:21.869> to<00:01:21.990> 4000<00:01:22.710> so<00:01:23.220> it's<00:01:23.400> anything

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
range is 850 to 4000 so it's anything

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.570 
range is 850 to 4000 so it's anything
less<00:01:24.330> than<00:01:24.810> equal<00:01:25.080> to<00:01:25.110> 900<00:01:25.799> we're<00:01:26.340> really

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
less than equal to 900 we're really

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.120 
less than equal to 900 we're really
close<00:01:26.939> to<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.180> Kinect<00:01:27.740> so<00:01:28.740> if<00:01:28.829> that's<00:01:28.950> the

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
close to the Kinect so if that's the

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.390 
close to the Kinect so if that's the
case<00:01:29.369> I'm<00:01:30.150> gonna<00:01:30.509> choose<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.560> color<00:01:31.799> blue<00:01:32.130> and

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
case I'm gonna choose the color blue and

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.090 
case I'm gonna choose the color blue and
max<00:01:33.090> out<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.479> color<00:01:33.689> blue<00:01:33.990> and<00:01:34.200> not<00:01:34.710> use<00:01:34.890> any

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
max out the color blue and not use any

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.380 
max out the color blue and not use any
green<00:01:35.340> or<00:01:35.520> red<00:01:36.680> now<00:01:37.680> if<00:01:37.950> we're<00:01:38.159> between<00:01:38.579> 900

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
green or red now if we're between 900

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.280 
green or red now if we're between 900
and<00:01:39.420> 4<00:01:40.259> mm<00:01:40.979> which<00:01:41.070> is<00:01:41.100> about<00:01:41.369> 1/2<00:01:42.170> we're<00:01:43.170> going

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
and 4 mm which is about 1/2 we're going

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.069 
and 4 mm which is about 1/2 we're going
to<00:01:43.350> make<00:01:43.470> everything<00:01:43.799> green<00:01:44.329> and<00:01:45.329> if<00:01:45.930> we're

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
to make everything green and if we're

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.810 
to make everything green and if we're
over<00:01:46.439> 2000<00:01:46.979> meaning<00:01:47.189> we're<00:01:47.310> a<00:01:47.340> little<00:01:47.520> farther

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
over 2000 meaning we're a little farther

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.730 
over 2000 meaning we're a little farther
away<00:01:48.030> you<00:01:48.720> can<00:01:48.869> do<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:51.049> being<00:01:52.049> it<00:01:52.170> to<00:01:52.439> convert

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
away you can do the being it to convert

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.280 
away you can do the being it to convert
2000<00:01:53.280> millimeters<00:01:53.729> into<00:01:54.030> inches<00:01:54.570> or<00:01:55.049> whatever

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
2000 millimeters into inches or whatever

2000 millimeters into inches or whatever
your<00:01:55.619> favorite<00:01:56.090> form<00:01:57.090> of<00:01:57.180> measurement<00:01:57.659> is

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
your favorite form of measurement is

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:03.230 
your favorite form of measurement is
meters<00:01:58.170> of<00:01:58.850> hectares<00:01:59.850> etc<00:02:01.729> if<00:02:02.729> it's<00:02:02.939> greater

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
meters of hectares etc if it's greater

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.889 
meters of hectares etc if it's greater
than<00:02:03.390> 2000<00:02:04.520> this<00:02:05.520> is<00:02:05.759> we're<00:02:06.570> gonna<00:02:06.659> color

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
than 2000 this is we're gonna color

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:10.089 
than 2000 this is we're gonna color
everything<00:02:07.110> red<00:02:07.940> so<00:02:08.940> I<00:02:08.970> have<00:02:09.119> some<00:02:09.330> code

00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:10.099 
everything red so I have some code

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:12.900 
everything red so I have some code
commented<00:02:11.099> out<00:02:11.250> here

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
commented out here

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:15.480 
commented out here
and<00:02:13.000> at<00:02:13.210> 0-0<00:02:13.870> we<00:02:14.110> got<00:02:14.320> the<00:02:14.470> distance<00:02:14.920> we're

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.490 
and at 0-0 we got the distance we're

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:18.960 
and at 0-0 we got the distance we're
choosing<00:02:15.850> the<00:02:16.090> color<00:02:16.300> and<00:02:17.250> we<00:02:18.250> are<00:02:18.280> adding<00:02:18.700> to

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
choosing the color and we are adding to

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.080 
choosing the color and we are adding to
our<00:02:19.000> color<00:02:19.300> frame<00:02:19.690> the<00:02:20.620> blue<00:02:20.950> green<00:02:21.250> red<00:02:21.460> index

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
our color frame the blue green red index

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:23.940 
our color frame the blue green red index
based<00:02:22.390> on<00:02:22.630> the<00:02:22.990> distance<00:02:23.380> from<00:02:23.440> that<00:02:23.650> value

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
based on the distance from that value

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.100 
based on the distance from that value
and<00:02:24.100> just<00:02:24.580> remember<00:02:25.000> at<00:02:25.450> the<00:02:25.660> end<00:02:25.840> of<00:02:26.020> this

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
and just remember at the end of this

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.800 
and just remember at the end of this
loop<00:02:26.380> we<00:02:26.830> do<00:02:27.040> need<00:02:27.310> to<00:02:27.340> because<00:02:27.910> each<00:02:28.300> color

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
loop we do need to because each color

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:30.990 
loop we do need to because each color
represents<00:02:29.110> two<00:02:29.620> we're<00:02:30.160> always<00:02:30.340> going<00:02:30.700> to<00:02:30.730> at

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
represents two we're always going to at

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.340 
represents two we're always going to at
a<00:02:31.060> time<00:02:32.490> each<00:02:33.490> color<00:02:33.850> represents<00:02:34.350> represents

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
a time each color represents represents

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.190 
a time each color represents represents
two<00:02:36.070> two<00:02:36.640> bytes

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
two two bytes

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.350 
two two bytes
okay<00:02:38.200> let's<00:02:38.860> we've<00:02:39.370> talked<00:02:39.700> a<00:02:39.790> lot<00:02:39.820> about<00:02:40.030> the

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
okay let's we've talked a lot about the

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.040 
okay let's we've talked a lot about the
code<00:02:40.570> let's<00:02:40.810> just<00:02:40.990> see<00:02:41.140> it<00:02:41.260> in<00:02:41.440> action<00:02:43.050> so

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.050 
code let's just see it in action so

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:46.530 
code let's just see it in action so
here's<00:02:44.410> our<00:02:44.560> awesome<00:02:45.250> histogram<00:02:45.790> and<00:02:46.090> what

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
here's our awesome histogram and what

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.710 
here's our awesome histogram and what
you<00:02:46.630> see<00:02:46.810> here<00:02:47.050> is<00:02:47.230> three<00:02:47.710> colors<00:02:48.600> let's<00:02:49.600> see

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
you see here is three colors let's see

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.960 
you see here is three colors let's see
if<00:02:49.780> we<00:02:49.870> can<00:02:49.990> go<00:02:50.080> green<00:02:50.530> and<00:02:50.860> as<00:02:51.190> my<00:02:51.430> hand<00:02:51.730> goes

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
if we can go green and as my hand goes

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.510 
if we can go green and as my hand goes
closer<00:02:52.360> it<00:02:52.780> becomes<00:02:53.260> blue<00:02:53.590> and<00:02:53.830> you<00:02:53.920> can<00:02:54.040> see<00:02:54.280> I

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:54.520 
closer it becomes blue and you can see I

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:57.390 
closer it becomes blue and you can see I
think<00:02:55.150> the<00:02:55.270> cold<00:02:55.960> was<00:02:56.140> nine<00:02:56.350> hundred<00:02:56.800> so<00:02:57.220> this

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
think the cold was nine hundred so this

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.580 
think the cold was nine hundred so this
is<00:02:57.550> the<00:02:57.670> nine<00:02:57.880> hundred<00:02:58.120> threshold<00:02:58.900> and<00:02:59.200> if<00:02:59.470> I

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
is the nine hundred threshold and if I

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.460 
is the nine hundred threshold and if I
move<00:03:00.040> my<00:03:00.070> hand<00:03:00.430> way<00:03:00.700> far<00:03:01.150> back<00:03:01.420> you<00:03:02.050> can<00:03:02.080> see<00:03:02.350> it

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
move my hand way far back you can see it

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.380 
move my hand way far back you can see it
on<00:03:02.590> here<00:03:02.890> it<00:03:03.130> actually<00:03:03.580> passes<00:03:03.910> the<00:03:04.210> two

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390 
on here it actually passes the two

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.480 
on here it actually passes the two
thousand<00:03:04.990> threshold<00:03:05.980> to<00:03:06.100> make<00:03:06.220> everything

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:06.490 
thousand threshold to make everything

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:10.140 
thousand threshold to make everything
red<00:03:07.530> so<00:03:08.530> what<00:03:08.740> we've<00:03:08.860> done<00:03:09.010> is<00:03:09.070> just<00:03:09.400> decided

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
red so what we've done is just decided

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.620 
red so what we've done is just decided
based<00:03:10.480> on<00:03:10.720> on<00:03:10.960> the<00:03:11.320> data<00:03:11.560> that<00:03:11.770> we<00:03:11.890> had<00:03:12.630> based

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630 
based on on the data that we had based

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:15.690 
based on on the data that we had based
on<00:03:13.750> the<00:03:13.810> distance<00:03:14.140> for<00:03:14.320> each<00:03:14.410> pixel<00:03:14.770> what<00:03:15.370> what

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
on the distance for each pixel what what

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.620 
on the distance for each pixel what what
are<00:03:15.820> those<00:03:15.910> three<00:03:16.330> colors<00:03:16.570> to<00:03:16.870> choose<00:03:18.630> fun

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
are those three colors to choose fun

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:23.490 
are those three colors to choose fun
stuff<00:03:20.250> now<00:03:21.250> one<00:03:21.790> thing<00:03:22.000> we<00:03:22.750> talked<00:03:23.410> about

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
stuff now one thing we talked about

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.130 
stuff now one thing we talked about
earlier<00:03:23.950> with<00:03:24.460> the<00:03:24.610> player<00:03:24.910> index<00:03:25.480> so<00:03:26.110> we

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.140 
earlier with the player index so we

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.600 
earlier with the player index so we
actually<00:03:26.680> I'm<00:03:27.040> going<00:03:27.160> to<00:03:27.220> uncomment<00:03:27.700> this<00:03:29.610> we

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:30.610 
actually I'm going to uncomment this we

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:32.790 
actually I'm going to uncomment this we
can<00:03:30.760> actually<00:03:30.910> choose<00:03:31.540> when<00:03:32.410> we're<00:03:32.590> looping

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:32.800 
can actually choose when we're looping

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.550 
can actually choose when we're looping
through<00:03:33.340> the<00:03:33.790> pixels<00:03:34.180> we<00:03:34.420> can<00:03:34.690> find<00:03:34.990> out<00:03:35.170> if

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
through the pixels we can find out if

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.600 
through the pixels we can find out if
that<00:03:36.310> pixel<00:03:36.940> represents<00:03:37.210> a<00:03:37.630> specific<00:03:37.840> player

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610 
that pixel represents a specific player

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:41.430 
that pixel represents a specific player
so<00:03:39.610> I<00:03:39.640> have<00:03:40.030> a<00:03:40.090> helper<00:03:40.660> method<00:03:41.080> here<00:03:41.230> I'm<00:03:41.320> going

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
so I have a helper method here I'm going

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.420 
so I have a helper method here I'm going
to<00:03:41.530> go<00:03:41.680> to<00:03:42.280> get<00:03:42.490> player<00:03:42.790> index<00:03:43.180> and<00:03:44.430> the

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
to go to get player index and the

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:49.710 
to go to get player index and the
formula<00:03:46.060> for<00:03:46.090> this<00:03:46.390> is<00:03:47.790> now<00:03:48.790> it's<00:03:49.060> only<00:03:49.360> the

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720 
formula for this is now it's only the

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.090 
formula for this is now it's only the
player<00:03:49.900> index<00:03:50.230> remember<00:03:50.560> is<00:03:50.620> only<00:03:50.860> in<00:03:51.040> that

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:51.100 
player index remember is only in that

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:53.280 
player index remember is only in that
first<00:03:51.430> one<00:03:51.640> because<00:03:51.880> we<00:03:52.030> we<00:03:52.420> bit<00:03:52.780> shifted<00:03:53.110> by

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290 
first one because we we bit shifted by

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:55.920 
first one because we we bit shifted by
three<00:03:53.640> now<00:03:54.640> we're<00:03:54.760> going<00:03:54.850> to<00:03:54.910> do<00:03:55.120> a<00:03:55.150> bitwise

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 
three now we're going to do a bitwise

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:59.280 
three now we're going to do a bitwise
and<00:03:56.290> on<00:03:56.800> the<00:03:57.100> first<00:03:57.370> frame<00:03:57.700> and<00:03:58.080> that's<00:03:59.080> going

00:03:59.280 --> 00:03:59.290 
and on the first frame and that's going

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:01.500 
and on the first frame and that's going
to<00:03:59.380> return<00:03:59.590> the<00:03:59.740> player<00:03:59.950> index<00:04:00.370> valid<00:04:01.209> values

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510 
to return the player index valid values

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:04.320 
to return the player index valid values
are<00:04:01.660> zero<00:04:01.959> it's<00:04:02.560> not<00:04:02.770> a<00:04:02.800> person<00:04:03.280> or<00:04:04.000> it's<00:04:04.150> not<00:04:04.270> a

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:04.330 
are zero it's not a person or it's not a

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:06.180 
are zero it's not a person or it's not a
player<00:04:04.600> that's<00:04:04.750> being<00:04:04.959> tracked<00:04:05.230> one<00:04:05.920> is<00:04:06.070> the

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.190 
player that's being tracked one is the

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:09.780 
player that's being tracked one is the
first<00:04:06.430> one<00:04:06.970> represent<00:04:07.750> skeleton<00:04:08.200> zero<00:04:08.790> and

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:09.790 
first one represent skeleton zero and

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:12.690 
first one represent skeleton zero and
then<00:04:09.940> to<00:04:10.180> represent<00:04:10.450> skeleton<00:04:11.110> one<00:04:11.610> and<00:04:12.610> if

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:12.700 
then to represent skeleton one and if

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:15.690 
then to represent skeleton one and if
that<00:04:12.790> isn't<00:04:12.970> confusing<00:04:14.160> you<00:04:15.160> can<00:04:15.310> check<00:04:15.520> this

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:15.700 
that isn't confusing you can check this

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:17.640 
that isn't confusing you can check this
slide<00:04:16.000> and<00:04:16.330> and<00:04:16.690> make<00:04:16.930> sure<00:04:17.140> you're<00:04:17.380> doing<00:04:17.410> the

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.650 
slide and and make sure you're doing the

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:21.620 
slide and and make sure you're doing the
right<00:04:17.770> thing<00:04:17.830> so<00:04:19.380> let<00:04:20.380> me<00:04:20.500> just<00:04:20.680> show<00:04:20.950> you<00:04:20.979> oh

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630 
right thing so let me just show you oh

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.909 
right thing so let me just show you oh
actually<00:04:22.630> let's<00:04:23.050> let's<00:04:23.380> talk<00:04:23.620> about<00:04:23.740> the

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:23.919 
actually let's let's talk about the

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:25.900 
actually let's let's talk about the
colors<00:04:24.250> we're<00:04:24.430> doing<00:04:24.640> so<00:04:24.820> if<00:04:25.030> we<00:04:25.270> have

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:25.910 
colors we're doing so if we have

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:29.170 
colors we're doing so if we have
a<00:04:27.190> player<00:04:28.190> now<00:04:28.460> we<00:04:28.520> could<00:04:28.790> choose<00:04:28.970> a<00:04:29.000> different

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:29.180 
a player now we could choose a different

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:33.550 
a player now we could choose a different
color<00:04:29.540> for<00:04:29.660> player<00:04:30.200> 1<00:04:30.470> versus<00:04:30.830> player<00:04:31.040> 2<00:04:32.560> orde

color for player 1 versus player 2 orde
find<00:04:33.950> out<00:04:34.100> we<00:04:34.400> can<00:04:34.520> choose<00:04:34.670> whatever<00:04:34.880> way

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:35.090 
find out we can choose whatever way

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:36.550 
find out we can choose whatever way
these<00:04:35.270> are<00:04:35.420> really<00:04:35.690> basic<00:04:35.840> ways<00:04:36.200> that<00:04:36.410> we're

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:36.560 
these are really basic ways that we're

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.920 
these are really basic ways that we're
coloring<00:04:37.040> right<00:04:37.820> we're<00:04:38.060> basically<00:04:38.450> in<00:04:38.600> this

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:38.930 
coloring right we're basically in this

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:43.510 
coloring right we're basically in this
case<00:04:39.160> choosing<00:04:40.160> full<00:04:40.490> green<00:04:40.880> and<00:04:41.180> full<00:04:41.420> red<00:04:42.520> to

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:43.520 
case choosing full green and full red to

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:46.960 
case choosing full green and full red to
color<00:04:43.760> any<00:04:44.360> player<00:04:45.110> greater<00:04:45.680> than<00:04:45.890> zero<00:04:46.160> means

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:46.970 
color any player greater than zero means

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:48.280 
color any player greater than zero means
that<00:04:47.090> it's<00:04:47.360> either<00:04:47.480> going<00:04:47.690> to<00:04:47.780> be<00:04:47.870> player<00:04:48.080> one

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:48.290 
that it's either going to be player one

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:50.980 
that it's either going to be player one
or<00:04:48.440> player<00:04:48.650> two<00:04:49.090> and<00:04:50.090> we<00:04:50.240> can<00:04:50.270> track<00:04:50.570> up<00:04:50.750> to<00:04:50.780> two

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:50.990 
or player two and we can track up to two

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:54.640 
or player two and we can track up to two
skeletons<00:04:51.290> poor<00:04:52.100> connect<00:04:52.430> and<00:04:53.560> what<00:04:54.560> I'm

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:54.650 
skeletons poor connect and what I'm

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:56.380 
skeletons poor connect and what I'm
going<00:04:54.740> to<00:04:54.800> do<00:04:54.920> is<00:04:55.040> just<00:04:55.250> stand<00:04:55.550> up<00:04:55.880> here<00:04:55.940> and

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:56.390 
going to do is just stand up here and

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:58.900 
going to do is just stand up here and
with<00:04:57.350> any<00:04:57.530> luck<00:04:57.620> or<00:04:57.950> skeleton<00:04:58.430> tracking<00:04:58.820> will

00:04:58.900 --> 00:04:58.910 
with any luck or skeleton tracking will

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:00.640 
with any luck or skeleton tracking will
turn<00:04:59.120> on<00:04:59.270> and<00:04:59.570> as<00:04:59.690> you<00:04:59.870> can<00:04:59.960> see<00:05:00.020> here<00:05:00.470> the

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:00.650 
turn on and as you can see here the

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:02.800 
turn on and as you can see here the
combination<00:05:00.830> those<00:05:01.700> two<00:05:01.940> color<00:05:02.180> combinations

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:02.810 
combination those two color combinations

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:05.980 
combination those two color combinations
make<00:05:03.140> me<00:05:03.320> sort<00:05:03.560> of<00:05:03.590> this<00:05:03.740> yellow<00:05:04.460> gold<00:05:04.790> person

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:05.990 
make me sort of this yellow gold person

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:08.170 
make me sort of this yellow gold person
and<00:05:06.140> I'm<00:05:06.560> now<00:05:06.710> tracked<00:05:07.130> and<00:05:07.460> what<00:05:07.820> you<00:05:07.940> see<00:05:08.090> is

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:08.180 
and I'm now tracked and what you see is

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:09.760 
and I'm now tracked and what you see is
it<00:05:08.330> doesn't<00:05:08.510> matter<00:05:08.840> what<00:05:09.170> distance<00:05:09.620> is

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:09.770 
it doesn't matter what distance is

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:12.610 
it doesn't matter what distance is
because<00:05:10.250> that<00:05:10.910> that<00:05:11.570> colorization<00:05:11.990> is<00:05:12.350> at<00:05:12.500> the

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:12.620 
because that that colorization is at the

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:14.590 
because that that colorization is at the
very<00:05:12.800> end<00:05:12.860> of<00:05:13.100> my<00:05:13.160> code<00:05:13.490> and<00:05:13.730> I'm<00:05:14.120> saying<00:05:14.390> hey

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:14.600 
very end of my code and I'm saying hey

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:16.840 
very end of my code and I'm saying hey
if<00:05:14.780> this<00:05:15.320> is<00:05:15.380> this<00:05:15.920> point<00:05:16.190> represents<00:05:16.760> the

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:16.850 
if this is this point represents the

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:20.340 
if this is this point represents the
skeleton<00:05:17.360> then<00:05:17.960> I<00:05:18.050> want<00:05:18.290> you<00:05:18.440> to<00:05:18.500> color<00:05:18.830> it

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:20.350 
skeleton then I want you to color it

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:22.810 
skeleton then I want you to color it
full<00:05:21.350> green<00:05:21.650> and<00:05:21.890> full<00:05:22.040> red<00:05:22.250> which<00:05:22.430> gives<00:05:22.670> me

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:22.820 
full green and full red which gives me

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:28.360 
full green and full red which gives me
that<00:05:23.060> that<00:05:23.360> wonderful<00:05:23.630> yellow<00:05:24.260> glow<00:05:25.750> okay<00:05:27.370> so

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:28.370 
that that wonderful yellow glow okay so

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:29.950 
that that wonderful yellow glow okay so
we've<00:05:28.520> seen<00:05:28.550> how<00:05:28.880> we<00:05:28.910> can<00:05:29.060> get<00:05:29.300> player<00:05:29.570> index

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:29.960 
we've seen how we can get player index

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:33.550 
we've seen how we can get player index
information<00:05:30.550> combined<00:05:31.550> with<00:05:31.820> depth<00:05:32.300> data<00:05:32.600> the

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:33.560 
information combined with depth data the

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:34.830 
information combined with depth data the
last<00:05:33.770> thing<00:05:33.920> I<00:05:33.980> want<00:05:34.130> to<00:05:34.190> show<00:05:34.310> you<00:05:34.400> is<00:05:34.670> just

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:34.840 
last thing I want to show you is just

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:37.180 
last thing I want to show you is just
the<00:05:35.840> formula<00:05:36.410> that<00:05:36.440> we<00:05:36.620> actually<00:05:36.890> use<00:05:37.010> in<00:05:37.130> the

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:37.190 
the formula that we actually use in the

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:38.920 
the formula that we actually use in the
coding<00:05:37.490> for<00:05:37.670> fun<00:05:37.820> connect<00:05:38.240> library<00:05:38.690> and

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:38.930 
coding for fun connect library and

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:40.890 
coding for fun connect library and
that's<00:05:39.440> actually<00:05:39.830> in<00:05:39.890> the<00:05:39.920> skeletal<00:05:40.460> viewer

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:40.900 
that's actually in the skeletal viewer

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:44.590 
that's actually in the skeletal viewer
sample<00:05:41.900> as<00:05:42.020> well<00:05:42.260> and<00:05:42.850> this<00:05:43.850> is<00:05:44.000> calculating

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:44.600 
sample as well and this is calculating

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:46.030 
sample as well and this is calculating
intensity<00:05:45.110> based<00:05:45.320> on<00:05:45.590> depth

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:46.040 
intensity based on depth

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:48.820 
intensity based on depth
so<00:05:46.610> we've<00:05:46.850> hard-coded<00:05:47.750> said<00:05:48.020> if<00:05:48.350> you're

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:48.830 
so we've hard-coded said if you're

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:51.580 
so we've hard-coded said if you're
either<00:05:48.980> this<00:05:49.250> your<00:05:50.090> the<00:05:50.240> close<00:05:50.510> middle<00:05:51.110> or<00:05:51.320> far

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:51.590 
either this your the close middle or far

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:54.070 
either this your the close middle or far
or<00:05:51.950> your<00:05:52.669> player<00:05:52.940> those<00:05:53.330> are<00:05:53.419> the<00:05:53.480> four<00:05:53.720> sonars

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:54.080 
or your player those are the four sonars

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:56.140 
or your player those are the four sonars
that<00:05:54.290> we've<00:05:54.410> done<00:05:54.560> so<00:05:54.740> far<00:05:54.790> instead<00:05:55.790> what<00:05:56.030> we

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:56.150 
that we've done so far instead what we

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:57.909 
that we've done so far instead what we
can<00:05:56.270> do<00:05:56.390> is<00:05:56.480> actually<00:05:56.570> scale<00:05:57.230> the<00:05:57.560> value

00:05:57.909 --> 00:05:57.919 
can do is actually scale the value

00:05:57.919 --> 00:06:02.230 
can do is actually scale the value
meaning<00:05:58.720> choose<00:05:59.720> different<00:06:00.850> choose<00:06:01.850> what

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:02.240 
meaning choose different choose what

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:05.050 
meaning choose different choose what
value<00:06:02.690> for<00:06:02.960> 255<00:06:03.590> to<00:06:04.280> do<00:06:04.400> it<00:06:04.550> and<00:06:04.730> apply<00:06:05.030> it

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:05.060 
value for 255 to do it and apply it

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:08.080 
value for 255 to do it and apply it
equally<00:06:05.750> across<00:06:06.140> these<00:06:06.550> what<00:06:07.550> this<00:06:07.730> is<00:06:07.880> going

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:08.090 
equally across these what this is going

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:16.000 
equally across these what this is going
to<00:06:08.150> do<00:06:08.360> is<00:06:09.430> choose<00:06:10.430> a<00:06:10.490> shade<00:06:10.970> of<00:06:11.150> gray<00:06:14.169> so<00:06:15.169> let

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:16.010 
to do is choose a shade of gray so let

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:17.890 
to do is choose a shade of gray so let
me<00:06:16.100> just<00:06:16.280> jump<00:06:16.700> to<00:06:16.880> this<00:06:17.000> value<00:06:17.240> so<00:06:17.480> we<00:06:17.600> have<00:06:17.780> an

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:17.900 
me just jump to this value so we have an

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:21.730 
me just jump to this value so we have an
intent<00:06:18.970> intensity<00:06:19.970> and<00:06:20.230> we<00:06:21.230> set<00:06:21.440> it<00:06:21.470> across

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:21.740 
intent intensity and we set it across

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:24.940 
intent intensity and we set it across
all<00:06:22.040> three<00:06:22.370> and<00:06:23.260> that's<00:06:24.260> the<00:06:24.410> same<00:06:24.680> thing<00:06:24.890> that

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:24.950 
all three and that's the same thing that

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:26.620 
all three and that's the same thing that
we're<00:06:25.250> going<00:06:25.370> to<00:06:25.460> show<00:06:25.640> let<00:06:25.850> me<00:06:25.910> just<00:06:26.090> jump

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:26.630 
we're going to show let me just jump

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:31.080 
we're going to show let me just jump
into<00:06:26.900> the<00:06:27.020> formula

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:31.090 

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:34.590 

and<00:06:31.180> we<00:06:31.870> do<00:06:32.260> the<00:06:32.470> four<00:06:32.860> thousand<00:06:33.370> eight<00:06:34.120> fifty

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:34.600 
and we do the four thousand eight fifty

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:36.240 
and we do the four thousand eight fifty
and<00:06:34.780> then<00:06:34.900> the<00:06:35.020> max<00:06:35.290> distance<00:06:35.590> offset<00:06:36.130> which

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:36.250 
and then the max distance offset which

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:37.890 
and then the max distance offset which
is<00:06:36.400> just<00:06:36.610> the<00:06:36.730> subtraction<00:06:37.240> of<00:06:37.510> those<00:06:37.660> two

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:37.900 
is just the subtraction of those two

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:40.200 
is just the subtraction of those two
let's<00:06:38.710> just<00:06:38.889> fullscreen<00:06:39.100> this<00:06:39.550> so<00:06:40.000> four

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:40.210 
let's just fullscreen this so four

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:44.010 
let's just fullscreen this so four
thousand<00:06:40.660> -<00:06:40.960> 850<00:06:41.590> and<00:06:41.800> then<00:06:42.580> I<00:06:43.300> won't<00:06:43.690> bother

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:44.020 
thousand - 850 and then I won't bother

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:45.659 
thousand - 850 and then I won't bother
going<00:06:44.380> through<00:06:44.530> this<00:06:44.800> formula<00:06:45.070> but<00:06:45.370> basically

00:06:45.659 --> 00:06:45.669 
going through this formula but basically

00:06:45.669 --> 00:06:48.090 
going through this formula but basically
what<00:06:45.940> this<00:06:45.970> is<00:06:46.150> going<00:06:46.330> to<00:06:46.419> return<00:06:46.720> is<00:06:47.050> a<00:06:47.620> value

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:48.100 
what this is going to return is a value

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:50.730 
what this is going to return is a value
between<00:06:48.840> 0<00:06:49.840> and<00:06:50.050> 255

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:50.740 
between 0 and 255

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:53.040 
between 0 and 255
and<00:06:51.010> it<00:06:51.160> basically<00:06:51.250> scales<00:06:51.970> whether<00:06:52.780> you're

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:53.050 
and it basically scales whether you're

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:55.860 
and it basically scales whether you're
very<00:06:53.500> light<00:06:53.770> gray<00:06:54.040> to<00:06:54.100> white<00:06:54.220> or<00:06:54.729> very<00:06:55.540> dark

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:55.870 
very light gray to white or very dark

00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:57.719 
very light gray to white or very dark
gray<00:06:56.050> to<00:06:56.080> black<00:06:56.380> it's<00:06:57.130> going<00:06:57.250> to<00:06:57.310> scale<00:06:57.520> that

00:06:57.719 --> 00:06:57.729 
gray to black it's going to scale that

00:06:57.729 --> 00:07:00.689 
gray to black it's going to scale that
value<00:06:58.000> 0<00:06:58.270> to<00:06:58.360> 255<00:06:58.810> and<00:06:59.320> when<00:06:59.919> you<00:07:00.130> set<00:07:00.490> that

00:07:00.689 --> 00:07:00.699 
value 0 to 255 and when you set that

00:07:00.699 --> 00:07:06.240 
value 0 to 255 and when you set that
across<00:07:01.210> all<00:07:01.540> of<00:07:02.260> your<00:07:03.010> colors<00:07:04.830> the<00:07:05.830> way<00:07:05.919> we<00:07:06.100> do

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:06.250 
across all of your colors the way we do

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:10.740 
across all of your colors the way we do
here<00:07:07.919> then<00:07:09.210> then<00:07:10.210> you're<00:07:10.360> going<00:07:10.450> to<00:07:10.510> get<00:07:10.630> those

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:10.750 
here then then you're going to get those

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:12.180 
here then then you're going to get those
shades<00:07:11.020> of<00:07:11.169> grey<00:07:11.350> and<00:07:11.380> let's<00:07:11.650> just<00:07:11.800> show<00:07:11.950> that

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:12.190 
shades of grey and let's just show that

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:14.010 
shades of grey and let's just show that
in<00:07:12.520> action<00:07:12.910> and<00:07:13.330> this<00:07:13.570> is<00:07:13.720> just<00:07:13.840> going<00:07:13.960> to

00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:14.020 
in action and this is just going to

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:16.469 
in action and this is just going to
overwrite<00:07:14.560> data<00:07:14.590> a<00:07:15.280> bus<00:07:15.880> as<00:07:16.060> we're<00:07:16.210> putting<00:07:16.419> at

00:07:16.469 --> 00:07:16.479 
overwrite data a bus as we're putting at

00:07:16.479 --> 00:07:18.270 
overwrite data a bus as we're putting at
the<00:07:16.540> bottom<00:07:16.900> and<00:07:17.200> now<00:07:17.440> we<00:07:17.500> have<00:07:17.740> the<00:07:17.889> shades<00:07:18.130> of

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:18.280 
the bottom and now we have the shades of

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:20.909 
the bottom and now we have the shades of
grey<00:07:18.430> the<00:07:18.669> darker<00:07:19.120> the<00:07:20.050> farther<00:07:20.320> away<00:07:20.470> you<00:07:20.590> get

00:07:20.909 --> 00:07:20.919 
grey the darker the farther away you get

00:07:20.919 --> 00:07:23.129 
grey the darker the farther away you get
it's<00:07:21.310> now<00:07:21.580> choosing<00:07:22.479> the<00:07:22.570> different<00:07:22.930> shades

00:07:23.129 --> 00:07:23.139 
it's now choosing the different shades

00:07:23.139 --> 00:07:26.279 
it's now choosing the different shades
of<00:07:23.320> gray<00:07:23.500> so<00:07:24.220> and<00:07:24.970> I<00:07:25.270> think<00:07:25.330> skeletal<00:07:25.960> tracking

00:07:26.279 --> 00:07:26.289 
of gray so and I think skeletal tracking

00:07:26.289 --> 00:07:28.800 
of gray so and I think skeletal tracking
should<00:07:26.470> still<00:07:26.740> work<00:07:26.950> if<00:07:27.280> order<00:07:28.240> of<00:07:28.330> operations

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:28.810 
should still work if order of operations

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:33.060 
should still work if order of operations
is<00:07:28.960> correct<00:07:29.260> so<00:07:29.500> now<00:07:29.620> I<00:07:29.650> have<00:07:31.169> gold<00:07:32.169> man<00:07:32.470> inside

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:33.070 
is correct so now I have gold man inside

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:37.350 
is correct so now I have gold man inside
monochrome<00:07:34.000> world<00:07:34.710> which<00:07:35.710> is<00:07:35.860> a<00:07:36.090> new<00:07:37.090> upcoming

00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:37.360 
monochrome world which is a new upcoming

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:40.860 
monochrome world which is a new upcoming
title<00:07:37.930> on<00:07:38.020> building<00:07:38.320> okay<00:07:39.039> so<00:07:39.520> we've<00:07:39.870> walked

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:40.870 
title on building okay so we've walked

00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:42.510 
title on building okay so we've walked
through<00:07:41.020> a<00:07:41.169> lot<00:07:41.530> of<00:07:41.710> things<00:07:41.919> within<00:07:42.130> the<00:07:42.310> depth

00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:42.520 
through a lot of things within the depth

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:44.850 
through a lot of things within the depth
data<00:07:42.700> we'll<00:07:43.150> put<00:07:43.360> the<00:07:43.450> samples<00:07:43.870> available<00:07:44.410> but

00:07:44.850 --> 00:07:44.860 
data we'll put the samples available but

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:46.110 
data we'll put the samples available but
the<00:07:44.979> point<00:07:45.220> is<00:07:45.430> when<00:07:45.700> you're<00:07:45.820> working<00:07:46.090> with

00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:46.120 
the point is when you're working with

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:48.330 
the point is when you're working with
depth<00:07:46.419> data<00:07:46.690> you're<00:07:47.440> not<00:07:47.650> getting<00:07:48.099> an<00:07:48.190> actual

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:48.340 
depth data you're not getting an actual

00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:50.279 
depth data you're not getting an actual
image<00:07:48.729> you're<00:07:49.330> getting<00:07:49.570> a<00:07:49.630> distance<00:07:50.080> per

00:07:50.279 --> 00:07:50.289 
image you're getting a distance per

00:07:50.289 --> 00:07:52.589 
image you're getting a distance per
pixel<00:07:50.560> what<00:07:51.520> you<00:07:51.669> do<00:07:51.849> with<00:07:52.030> a<00:07:52.060> distance<00:07:52.479> per

00:07:52.589 --> 00:07:52.599 
pixel what you do with a distance per

00:07:52.599 --> 00:07:55.140 
pixel what you do with a distance per
pixel<00:07:52.810> and<00:07:53.020> how<00:07:53.260> you<00:07:53.320> color<00:07:53.740> it<00:07:53.919> is<00:07:54.039> up<00:07:54.700> to<00:07:54.970> you

00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:55.150 
pixel and how you color it is up to you

00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:57.629 
pixel and how you color it is up to you
the<00:07:55.389> next<00:07:55.900> thing<00:07:56.020> is<00:07:56.139> to<00:07:56.169> is<00:07:56.680> you<00:07:57.220> can<00:07:57.370> choose

00:07:57.629 --> 00:07:57.639 
the next thing is to is you can choose

00:07:57.639 --> 00:08:00.420 
the next thing is to is you can choose
different<00:07:57.880> colors<00:07:58.450> based<00:07:59.080> on<00:07:59.380> player<00:07:59.740> data<00:08:00.160> as

00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:00.430 
different colors based on player data as

00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:03.270 
different colors based on player data as
well<00:08:01.229> thanks<00:08:02.229> that<00:08:02.349> in<00:08:02.440> our<00:08:02.560> next<00:08:02.800> video<00:08:03.039> we're

00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:03.280 
well thanks that in our next video we're

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:04.320 
well thanks that in our next video we're
going<00:08:03.430> to<00:08:03.490> walk<00:08:03.669> through<00:08:03.700> now<00:08:04.090> that<00:08:04.240> we've

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:04.330 
going to walk through now that we've

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:06.600 
going to walk through now that we've
shown<00:08:04.539> skeletal<00:08:05.169> tracking<00:08:05.590> for<00:08:06.130> depth<00:08:06.370> data

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:06.610 
shown skeletal tracking for depth data

00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:08.219 
shown skeletal tracking for depth data
we're<00:08:07.180> actually<00:08:07.270> going<00:08:07.479> to<00:08:07.539> show<00:08:07.630> how<00:08:07.930> you<00:08:07.990> can

00:08:08.219 --> 00:08:08.229 
we're actually going to show how you can

00:08:08.229 --> 00:08:10.260 
we're actually going to show how you can
track<00:08:08.530> different<00:08:08.740> joints<00:08:09.250> within<00:08:09.520> positions

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:10.270 
track different joints within positions

00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:13.440 
track different joints within positions
in<00:08:10.510> the<00:08:10.720> skeleton<00:08:11.139> engine
