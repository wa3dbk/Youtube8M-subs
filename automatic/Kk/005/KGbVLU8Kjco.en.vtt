00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
been friends for a long time so we

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.039 
been friends for a long time so we
figured<00:01:20.490> you<00:01:20.759> know<00:01:20.790> once<00:01:21.390> this<00:01:21.600> whole<00:01:21.840> thing

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
figured you know once this whole thing

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.719 
figured you know once this whole thing
was<00:01:22.200> announced<00:01:22.439> that<00:01:22.740> these<00:01:23.340> two<00:01:23.520> guys<00:01:23.670> are

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
was announced that these two guys are

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.609 
was announced that these two guys are
gonna<00:01:23.939> become<00:01:25.759> something<00:01:26.759> so<00:01:27.720> we<00:01:28.320> figured

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
gonna become something so we figured

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.410 
gonna become something so we figured
it'd<00:01:28.710> be<00:01:28.799> real<00:01:28.920> easy<00:01:28.950> to<00:01:29.220> start<00:01:29.610> with<00:01:29.850> a<00:01:29.880> short

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
it'd be real easy to start with a short

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.300 
it'd be real easy to start with a short
piece<00:01:30.720> and<00:01:31.020> we<00:01:31.320> were<00:01:31.409> just<00:01:31.560> talking<00:01:31.770> yesterday

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
piece and we were just talking yesterday

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.670 
piece and we were just talking yesterday
but<00:01:32.579> let's<00:01:32.729> do<00:01:32.850> a<00:01:32.880> Batman<00:01:33.360> like<00:01:34.140> anyway<00:01:34.439> and

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
but let's do a Batman like anyway and

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.770 
but let's do a Batman like anyway and
see<00:01:34.799> if<00:01:34.890> DC<00:01:35.189> will<00:01:35.280> be<00:01:35.310> interested<00:01:35.939> and<00:01:36.450> we<00:01:36.630> come

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
see if DC will be interested and we come

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.330 
see if DC will be interested and we come
up<00:01:36.869> with<00:01:37.020> our<00:01:37.170> way<00:01:37.350> of<00:01:37.380> doing<00:01:37.860> it<00:01:37.979> that<00:01:38.009> I<00:01:38.130> think

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
up with our way of doing it that I think

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.160 
up with our way of doing it that I think
is<00:01:38.430> really<00:01:38.670> unusual<00:01:38.939> and<00:01:39.450> really<00:01:39.659> new<00:01:39.869> and<00:01:40.079> it

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
is really unusual and really new and it

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.539 
is really unusual and really new and it
was<00:01:40.259> based<00:01:40.439> a<00:01:40.590> little<00:01:40.770> bit<00:01:40.920> stuff<00:01:41.250> that<00:01:41.430> you'd

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
was based a little bit stuff that you'd

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.380 
was based a little bit stuff that you'd
come<00:01:41.850> up<00:01:42.000> with<00:01:43.700> so<00:01:44.700> we<00:01:44.820> thought<00:01:44.970> we'd<00:01:45.119> start

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
come up with so we thought we'd start

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.450 
come up with so we thought we'd start
with<00:01:45.479> that<00:01:45.780> and<00:01:45.930> then<00:01:46.020> see<00:01:46.320> once<00:01:46.590> we<00:01:46.680> once<00:01:47.250> we

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:00.580 
what I wanted to see so maybe what I

what I wanted to see so maybe what I
wanted<00:05:00.970> to<00:05:01.060> see<00:05:01.240> is<00:05:01.300> a<00:05:01.360> bit<00:05:01.600> off<00:05:01.780> from<00:05:02.050> what

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:02.200 
wanted to see is a bit off from what

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:03.659 
wanted to see is a bit off from what
somebody<00:05:02.440> else<00:05:02.560> wants<00:05:02.980> to<00:05:03.070> see<00:05:03.250> but<00:05:03.460> luckily

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:03.669 
somebody else wants to see but luckily

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:05.820 
somebody else wants to see but luckily
as<00:05:03.970> I've<00:05:04.690> been<00:05:04.870> lucky<00:05:05.200> enough<00:05:05.380> to<00:05:05.530> have<00:05:05.620> a<00:05:05.680> lot

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:05.830 
as I've been lucky enough to have a lot

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:08.930 
as I've been lucky enough to have a lot
of<00:05:05.950> people<00:05:06.190> enjoy<00:05:06.480> that<00:05:07.480> oddness

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:08.940 
of people enjoy that oddness

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:12.750 
of people enjoy that oddness
and<00:05:09.940> I<00:05:10.060> think<00:05:10.419> it<00:05:10.570> seems<00:05:11.530> weird<00:05:11.919> perhaps<00:05:12.460> if

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:12.760 
and I think it seems weird perhaps if

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:16.050 
and I think it seems weird perhaps if
you<00:05:13.240> couldn't<00:05:13.510> contrast<00:05:14.290> it<00:05:14.470> with<00:05:14.500> say<00:05:14.860> an<00:05:15.340> 80s

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:16.060 
you couldn't contrast it with say an 80s

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:17.700 
you couldn't contrast it with say an 80s
DC<00:05:16.600> car<00:05:16.840> maker<00:05:17.230> oh<00:05:17.260> yeah

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:19.570 
but it was never weird this wasn't weird

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:46.240 
thing it seemed completely normal and

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:47.969 
thing it seemed completely normal and
when<00:05:46.419> people<00:05:46.570> say<00:05:46.900> is<00:05:47.020> weird<00:05:47.410> I<00:05:47.500> can<00:05:47.680> I<00:05:47.710> just

that<00:05:54.610> seems<00:05:54.910> to<00:05:55.030> be<00:05:55.060> the<00:05:55.300> answer<00:05:55.450> that<00:05:55.780> comes

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:56.050 
that seems to be the answer that comes

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:57.810 
that seems to be the answer that comes
out<00:05:56.350> when<00:05:56.560> people<00:05:56.890> ask<00:05:57.100> where<00:05:57.550> their

00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:57.820 
out when people ask where their

00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:59.520 
out when people ask where their
inspiration<00:05:58.450> comes<00:05:58.660> from<00:05:58.780> it's<00:05:59.260> just

00:05:59.520 --> 00:05:59.530 
inspiration comes from it's just

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:01.290 
inspiration comes from it's just
whatever<00:05:59.860> occurs<00:06:00.340> to<00:06:00.490> you<00:06:00.580> on<00:06:00.669> the<00:06:00.760> day<00:06:00.940> but

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:12.040 
things that have come into play um I

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:14.219 
things that have come into play um I
think<00:06:12.460> you<00:06:13.120> know<00:06:13.240> all<00:06:13.270> the<00:06:13.600> stuff<00:06:13.810> that<00:06:13.870> I<00:06:14.080> do

00:06:14.219 --> 00:06:14.229 
think you know all the stuff that I do

00:06:14.229 --> 00:06:16.600 
think you know all the stuff that I do
is<00:06:14.830> is<00:06:15.130> generally<00:06:15.790> relative<00:06:16.360> to

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:16.610 
is is generally relative to

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:19.330 
is is generally relative to
each<00:06:16.669> other<00:06:16.789> so<00:06:17.090> I<00:06:17.389> just<00:06:17.930> figure<00:06:18.620> out<00:06:18.650> what<00:06:19.280> the

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:19.340 
each other so I just figure out what the

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:21.119 
each other so I just figure out what the
best<00:06:19.729> way<00:06:19.909> to<00:06:19.939> channel<00:06:20.389> that<00:06:20.569> is<00:06:20.750> like

00:06:21.119 --> 00:06:21.129 
best way to channel that is like

00:06:21.129 --> 00:06:23.890 
best way to channel that is like
Umbrella<00:06:22.129> Academy<00:06:22.219> to<00:06:22.879> me<00:06:23.090> will<00:06:23.389> always<00:06:23.629> be

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:23.900 
Umbrella Academy to me will always be

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:26.320 
Umbrella Academy to me will always be
