00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
artistic engraving of some sort but

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.580 
artistic engraving of some sort but
couldn't<00:00:32.820> elaborate<00:00:33.239> beyond<00:00:33.600> that<00:00:33.840> it<00:00:34.410> was<00:00:34.559> a

carving projects I was fairly

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.270 
carving projects I was fairly
comfortable<00:00:40.379> taking<00:00:40.620> on<00:00:40.829> this<00:00:41.010> sort<00:00:41.219> of

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.630 
challenge after a bit of research I
discovered<00:00:43.680> these<00:00:44.040> designs<00:00:44.399> called

discovered these designs called

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.910 
discovered these designs called
calligraphic<00:00:45.239> elements<00:00:45.809> and<00:00:45.960> as<00:00:46.559> it<00:00:46.739> turns

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
calligraphic elements and as it turns

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.200 
calligraphic elements and as it turns
out<00:00:47.100> they're<00:00:47.399> actually<00:00:47.700> a<00:00:47.730> pretty<00:00:48.000> big<00:00:48.180> thing

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
out they're actually a pretty big thing

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.880 
out they're actually a pretty big thing
