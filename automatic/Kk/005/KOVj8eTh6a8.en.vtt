okay<00:00:07.350> so<00:00:07.410> there's<00:00:07.649> two<00:00:07.830> things<00:00:07.859> that<00:00:08.099> we<00:00:08.189> need

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
okay so there's two things that we need

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.339 
okay so there's two things that we need
to<00:00:08.429> do<00:00:08.550> the<00:00:08.730> first<00:00:08.880> one<00:00:09.179> is<00:00:09.420> getting<00:00:10.080> the<00:00:10.230> right

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
to do the first one is getting the right

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.120 
to do the first one is getting the right
amount<00:00:10.469> of<00:00:10.620> tape<00:00:10.830> the<00:00:11.490> second<00:00:11.820> one<00:00:11.940> is

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:13.130 
amount of tape the second one is

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:15.470 
amount of tape the second one is
alignment<00:00:14.130> so<00:00:14.370> let's<00:00:14.610> talk<00:00:14.790> about<00:00:14.849> tape<00:00:15.240> first

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
alignment so let's talk about tape first

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.620 
alignment so let's talk about tape first
so<00:00:15.839> this<00:00:15.990> is<00:00:16.199> carpet<00:00:16.590> tape<00:00:17.060> this<00:00:18.060> is<00:00:18.240> just<00:00:18.510> a

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
so this is carpet tape this is just a

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:19.730 
so this is carpet tape this is just a
standard<00:00:18.840> carpet<00:00:19.289> tape<00:00:19.410> from<00:00:19.590> Home<00:00:19.710> Depot

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
standard carpet tape from Home Depot

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.939 
standard carpet tape from Home Depot
it's<00:00:20.670> fairly<00:00:20.939> thin<00:00:21.359> it's<00:00:22.109> fairly<00:00:22.350> sticky<00:00:22.830> and

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
it's fairly thin it's fairly sticky and

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.160 
it's fairly thin it's fairly sticky and
sticky<00:00:23.070> on<00:00:23.430> both<00:00:23.609> sides<00:00:23.880> so<00:00:24.300> we're<00:00:25.080> gonna

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
sticky on both sides so we're gonna

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.349 
sticky on both sides so we're gonna
mount<00:00:25.410> this<00:00:25.529> piece<00:00:25.920> to<00:00:26.250> the<00:00:26.340> table<00:00:26.789> like<00:00:26.939> this

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
mount this piece to the table like this

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.480 
mount this piece to the table like this
we<00:00:28.109> need<00:00:28.170> a<00:00:28.260> mount<00:00:28.470> to<00:00:28.590> the<00:00:28.740> same<00:00:28.949> spot<00:00:29.279> so

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
we need a mount to the same spot so

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.999 
we need a mount to the same spot so
we're<00:00:29.640> gonna<00:00:29.730> use<00:00:29.820> parallel<00:00:30.390> bars<00:00:30.650> one<00:00:31.650> here

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
we're gonna use parallel bars one here

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.250 
we're gonna use parallel bars one here
and<00:00:32.520> one<00:00:32.759> here<00:00:32.790> that<00:00:33.239> lets<00:00:33.480> us<00:00:33.630> put<00:00:33.870> this<00:00:34.020> in

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
and one here that lets us put this in

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.350 
and one here that lets us put this in
exactly<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.370> same<00:00:35.430> spot<00:00:35.670> every<00:00:35.940> time<00:00:36.090> we

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
exactly the same spot every time we

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.270 
exactly the same spot every time we
mount<00:00:36.570> it<00:00:36.719> but<00:00:37.200> also<00:00:37.350> gives<00:00:37.649> us<00:00:37.770> clearance<00:00:38.160> so

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
mount it but also gives us clearance so

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.799 
mount it but also gives us clearance so
that<00:00:38.309> we<00:00:38.489> have<00:00:38.640> room<00:00:38.879> to<00:00:39.000> cut<00:00:39.180> around<00:00:39.300> if<00:00:39.660> you

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
that we have room to cut around if you

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.910 
that we have room to cut around if you
need<00:00:39.960> to<00:00:40.850> in<00:00:41.850> order<00:00:42.059> to<00:00:42.239> mount<00:00:43.110> this<00:00:43.350> we're

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
need to in order to mount this we're

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.160 
need to in order to mount this we're
gonna<00:00:44.010> use<00:00:44.219> about<00:00:44.370> 20<00:00:44.820> inches<00:00:44.940> of<00:00:45.210> tape<00:00:45.390> if<00:00:45.809> you

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
gonna use about 20 inches of tape if you

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.650 
gonna use about 20 inches of tape if you
use<00:00:46.559> six<00:00:47.160> inches<00:00:47.430> of<00:00:47.610> tape<00:00:47.789> that's<00:00:48.090> not<00:00:48.390> enough

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
use six inches of tape that's not enough

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.229 
use six inches of tape that's not enough
if<00:00:48.899> you<00:00:49.140> use<00:00:49.350> 20<00:00:49.739> inches<00:00:50.039> that<00:00:50.640> does<00:00:50.850> seem<00:00:51.090> like

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
if you use 20 inches that does seem like

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.000 
if you use 20 inches that does seem like
it's<00:00:51.420> enough<00:00:51.660> so<00:00:51.930> that's<00:00:52.500> basically<00:00:52.860> what

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
it's enough so that's basically what

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.220 
it's enough so that's basically what
we're<00:00:53.129> gonna<00:00:53.190> do<00:00:54.920> so<00:00:56.600> you<00:00:57.600> want<00:00:57.690> to<00:00:57.840> be<00:00:57.899> careful

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
we're gonna do so you want to be careful

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.479 
we're gonna do so you want to be careful
when<00:00:58.350> you<00:00:58.440> put<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:58.680> tape<00:00:58.800> down<00:00:58.829> not<00:00:59.219> to<00:00:59.370> have

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
when you put the tape down not to have

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.450 
when you put the tape down not to have
any<00:00:59.609> bubbles<00:01:00.030> and<00:01:00.590> you<00:01:01.590> don't<00:01:01.980> want<00:01:02.129> to<00:01:02.280> take

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
any bubbles and you don't want to take

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.600 
any bubbles and you don't want to take
to<00:01:02.760> stick<00:01:03.329> out<00:01:03.539> on<00:01:04.140> any<00:01:04.920> of<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.159> edges<00:01:05.309> you're

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
to stick out on any of the edges you're

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.760 
to stick out on any of the edges you're
going<00:01:05.850> to<00:01:05.970> align<00:01:06.210> with<00:01:06.420> so<00:01:06.689> in<00:01:06.840> our<00:01:06.869> case<00:01:07.140> we're

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
going to align with so in our case we're

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.480 
going to align with so in our case we're
gonna<00:01:07.830> align<00:01:08.189> to<00:01:08.369> this<00:01:08.460> edge<00:01:08.670> and<00:01:08.850> this<00:01:08.970> edge

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490 
gonna align to this edge and this edge

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.310 
gonna align to this edge and this edge
which<00:01:11.490> means<00:01:11.760> that<00:01:12.720> we<00:01:12.840> want<00:01:13.020> to<00:01:13.170> make<00:01:13.290> sure

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
which means that we want to make sure

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.370 
which means that we want to make sure
our<00:01:13.500> tape<00:01:13.920> doesn't<00:01:14.880> stick<00:01:15.240> out<00:01:15.750> on<00:01:15.990> this<00:01:16.140> edge

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
our tape doesn't stick out on this edge

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.749 
our tape doesn't stick out on this edge
of<00:01:16.500> this<00:01:16.619> edge<00:01:16.830> otherwise<00:01:17.159> it<00:01:17.369> will<00:01:17.430> affect

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
of this edge otherwise it will affect

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.240 
of this edge otherwise it will affect
our<00:01:17.880> alignment<00:01:18.360> so<00:01:18.869> and<00:01:19.830> since<00:01:20.009> we're<00:01:20.159> gonna

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
our alignment so and since we're gonna

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.710 
our alignment so and since we're gonna
flip<00:01:20.430> it<00:01:20.549> like<00:01:20.790> that<00:01:21.380> that<00:01:22.380> means<00:01:23.509> this<00:01:24.509> edge

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
flip it like that that means this edge

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:25.789 
flip it like that that means this edge
of<00:01:24.930> this<00:01:25.049> edge<00:01:25.259> of<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.470> ones<00:01:25.619> we're<00:01:25.740> gonna

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
of this edge of the ones we're gonna

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:32.249 
of this edge of the ones we're gonna
keep<00:01:26.070> clean

00:01:32.249 --> 00:01:32.259 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:36.270 

so<00:01:33.259> in<00:01:33.890> order<00:01:34.070> to<00:01:34.220> keep<00:01:34.399> bubbles<00:01:34.759> out

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.280 
so in order to keep bubbles out

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.219 
so in order to keep bubbles out
you<00:01:37.280> don't<00:01:37.460> just<00:01:37.689> attach<00:01:38.689> the<00:01:38.840> tape<00:01:39.020> straight

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:39.229 
you don't just attach the tape straight

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:41.280 
you don't just attach the tape straight
down<00:01:39.409> you<00:01:39.770> want<00:01:39.920> to<00:01:40.009> hold<00:01:40.130> it<00:01:40.250> at<00:01:40.369> an<00:01:40.460> angle<00:01:40.580> and

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:41.290 
down you want to hold it at an angle and

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:59.350 
down you want to hold it at an angle and
squeegee<00:01:42.290> it<00:01:42.470> down<00:01:42.680> basically<00:01:58.000> do<00:01:59.000> the<00:01:59.270> same

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
squeegee it down basically do the same

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:06.070 
squeegee it down basically do the same
thing<00:01:59.509> for<00:01:59.899> the<00:02:00.049> other<00:02:04.000> it's<00:02:05.000> okay<00:02:05.360> I<00:02:05.690> kind<00:02:05.990> of

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:06.080 
thing for the other it's okay I kind of

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.600 
thing for the other it's okay I kind of
like<00:02:06.259> to<00:02:06.409> leave<00:02:06.560> the<00:02:06.679> tape<00:02:06.860> sticking<00:02:07.340> out<00:02:07.580> a

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
like to leave the tape sticking out a

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.219 
like to leave the tape sticking out a
little<00:02:07.940> bit<00:02:08.119> a<00:02:08.360> little<00:02:08.600> bit<00:02:08.810> of<00:02:08.899> overhang

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
little bit a little bit of overhang

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.410 
little bit a little bit of overhang
seems<00:02:09.530> to<00:02:09.679> be<00:02:09.799> good<00:02:10.030> because<00:02:11.030> they<00:02:11.150> can<00:02:11.299> see

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
seems to be good because they can see

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.479 
seems to be good because they can see
something<00:02:11.780> to<00:02:11.959> grab<00:02:12.470> if<00:02:12.830> you<00:02:13.010> have<00:02:13.130> trouble

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:13.489 
something to grab if you have trouble

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:25.300 
something to grab if you have trouble
getting<00:02:13.519> tape<00:02:13.970> off<00:02:14.150> later<00:02:22.630> all<00:02:23.630> right

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
getting tape off later all right

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.850 
getting tape off later all right
you'll<00:02:25.940> see<00:02:26.239> a<00:02:26.270> few<00:02:26.330> bubbles<00:02:26.930> that's<00:02:27.620> not

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
you'll see a few bubbles that's not

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:29.260 
you'll see a few bubbles that's not
actually<00:02:28.069> the<00:02:28.340> tape<00:02:28.580> that's<00:02:28.760> actually<00:02:29.120> the

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.270 
actually the tape that's actually the

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:33.250 
actually the tape that's actually the
wax<00:02:29.900> paper<00:02:30.140> backing<00:02:30.440> on<00:02:30.739> it<00:02:30.790> so<00:02:31.790> when<00:02:32.540> we<00:02:32.569> pull

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
wax paper backing on it so when we pull

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.670 
wax paper backing on it so when we pull
the<00:02:33.290> wax<00:02:33.470> paper<00:02:33.709> off<00:02:34.040> it's<00:02:34.670> gonna<00:02:34.849> look<00:02:35.150> good

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
the wax paper off it's gonna look good

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.930 
the wax paper off it's gonna look good
double<00:02:36.680> stick<00:02:36.830> tape<00:02:36.860> is<00:02:37.160> a<00:02:37.190> little<00:02:37.489> hard<00:02:37.730> to

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
double stick tape is a little hard to

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.660 
double stick tape is a little hard to
remove<00:02:38.690> so<00:02:39.560> the<00:02:39.680> best<00:02:39.860> way<00:02:40.010> I<00:02:40.040> found<00:02:40.280> to<00:02:40.400> do<00:02:40.550> it

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
remove so the best way I found to do it

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:42.360 
remove so the best way I found to do it
is<00:02:40.790> to<00:02:41.300> leave<00:02:41.450> a<00:02:41.480> little<00:02:41.660> bit<00:02:41.780> of<00:02:41.870> overhang

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
is to leave a little bit of overhang

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.820 
is to leave a little bit of overhang
fold<00:02:43.370> it<00:02:43.519> back<00:02:43.730> and<00:02:44.120> the<00:02:45.080> wax<00:02:45.260> paper<00:02:45.500> is<00:02:45.800> a

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
fold it back and the wax paper is a

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:47.559 
fold it back and the wax paper is a
little<00:02:46.099> stiffer<00:02:46.489> than<00:02:46.519> the<00:02:46.760> tape<00:02:46.970> itself<00:02:47.300> so

00:02:47.559 --> 00:02:47.569 
little stiffer than the tape itself so

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:49.390 
little stiffer than the tape itself so
you<00:02:47.660> can<00:02:47.810> usually<00:02:47.900> just<00:02:48.230> kind<00:02:48.349> of<00:02:48.500> peel<00:02:49.099> it<00:02:49.250> off

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
you can usually just kind of peel it off

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:56.050 
you can usually just kind of peel it off
and<00:02:49.840> that<00:02:50.840> lets<00:02:51.019> you<00:02:51.140> get<00:02:51.260> that<00:02:51.470> off<00:02:54.880> you<00:02:55.880> might

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
and that lets you get that off you might

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:01.449 
and that lets you get that off you might
take<00:02:56.209> a<00:02:56.269> couple<00:02:56.360> tries<00:02:59.799> this<00:03:00.799> is<00:03:00.950> a<00:03:00.980> perfect

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:01.459 
take a couple tries this is a perfect

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:03.520 
take a couple tries this is a perfect
fit<00:03:01.640> it's<00:03:01.819> okay<00:03:02.090> and<00:03:02.330> so<00:03:02.450> here<00:03:02.660> this<00:03:03.200> is<00:03:03.260> the

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
fit it's okay and so here this is the

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:05.410 
fit it's okay and so here this is the
edge<00:03:03.650> we're<00:03:03.860> gonna<00:03:03.950> use<00:03:04.130> for<00:03:04.310> alignment<00:03:04.549> so

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
edge we're gonna use for alignment so

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.090 
edge we're gonna use for alignment so
put<00:03:05.600> it<00:03:05.690> down<00:03:05.810> like<00:03:05.840> that<00:03:06.019> and<00:03:06.470> that<00:03:06.739> as<00:03:06.890> well

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:07.100 
put it down like that and that as well

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:12.220 
put it down like that and that as well
you<00:03:07.459> know<00:03:09.160> we<00:03:10.160> have<00:03:10.340> our<00:03:10.700> block<00:03:11.209> it's<00:03:11.840> taped

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
you know we have our block it's taped

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:14.770 
you know we have our block it's taped
it's<00:03:12.560> ready<00:03:12.769> to<00:03:12.890> stick<00:03:13.130> down<00:03:13.299> the<00:03:14.299> back<00:03:14.540> can<00:03:14.750> be

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
it's ready to stick down the back can be

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:16.030 
it's ready to stick down the back can be
cleaned<00:03:15.110> off<00:03:15.260> the<00:03:15.290> board<00:03:15.650> where<00:03:15.830> we're<00:03:15.980> gonna

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
cleaned off the board where we're gonna

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.720 
cleaned off the board where we're gonna
put<00:03:16.280> this<00:03:16.430> piece<00:03:16.959> so<00:03:17.959> that<00:03:17.989> it's<00:03:18.260> clean<00:03:18.730> except

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
put this piece so that it's clean except

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.860 
put this piece so that it's clean except
for<00:03:19.849> these<00:03:19.910> sticky<00:03:20.180> notes

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:26.080 

okay<00:03:23.950> now<00:03:24.950> the<00:03:25.010> way<00:03:25.340> that<00:03:25.489> we're<00:03:25.670> doing<00:03:25.700> this

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
okay now the way that we're doing this

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:30.009 
okay now the way that we're doing this
today<00:03:26.299> is<00:03:26.660> we're<00:03:27.310> aligning<00:03:28.310> to<00:03:28.819> this<00:03:29.690> edge

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:30.019 
today is we're aligning to this edge

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:32.830 
today is we're aligning to this edge
that<00:03:30.380> I've<00:03:30.470> pre-cut<00:03:30.829> to<00:03:31.280> be<00:03:31.570> square<00:03:32.570> to<00:03:32.600> the

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840 
that I've pre-cut to be square to the

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.650 
that I've pre-cut to be square to the
x-axis<00:03:33.530> or<00:03:34.070> parallel<00:03:34.700> to<00:03:34.850> the<00:03:34.940> x-axis<00:03:35.239> and

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660 
x-axis or parallel to the x-axis and

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:37.630 
x-axis or parallel to the x-axis and
this<00:03:36.200> edge<00:03:36.410> which<00:03:36.620> I've<00:03:36.769> just<00:03:36.799> got<00:03:37.220> to<00:03:37.459> be

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:37.640 
this edge which I've just got to be

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.170 
this edge which I've just got to be
parallel<00:03:38.540> to<00:03:38.810> the<00:03:38.900> y-axis<00:03:39.760> so<00:03:40.760> now<00:03:40.910> when<00:03:41.150> I

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:41.180 
parallel to the y-axis so now when I

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.870 
parallel to the y-axis so now when I
take<00:03:41.420> my<00:03:41.480> part<00:03:42.280> again<00:03:43.280> the<00:03:43.459> edge<00:03:43.579> I'm<00:03:43.730> gonna

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:43.880 
take my part again the edge I'm gonna

00:03:43.880 --> 00:04:03.000 
take my part again the edge I'm gonna
line<00:03:44.150> with

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.010 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:06.729 

it's<00:04:04.010> square<00:04:04.549> to<00:04:05.180> bowed<00:04:05.389> axis<00:04:05.870> because<00:04:06.409> I<00:04:06.560> used

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:06.739 
it's square to bowed axis because I used

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:10.839 
it's square to bowed axis because I used
to<00:04:06.829> 1<00:04:06.980> inch<00:04:07.159> parallels<00:04:07.639> I<00:04:09.159> can<00:04:10.159> repeatedly<00:04:10.519> get

00:04:10.839 --> 00:04:10.849 
to 1 inch parallels I can repeatedly get

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:13.209 
to 1 inch parallels I can repeatedly get
to<00:04:10.969> this<00:04:11.090> point<00:04:11.359> every<00:04:11.810> time<00:04:11.840> I<00:04:12.049> do<00:04:12.230> it<00:04:12.319> and<00:04:13.129> you

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:13.219 
to this point every time I do it and you

00:04:13.219 --> 00:04:14.110 
to this point every time I do it and you
press<00:04:13.430> it<00:04:13.579> down<00:04:13.700> real<00:04:13.909> good

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:14.120 
press it down real good

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:19.629 
press it down real good
so<00:04:14.359> tape<00:04:14.870> will<00:04:15.049> hold<00:04:15.200> it

00:04:19.629 --> 00:04:19.639 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:21.789 

using<00:04:20.539> the<00:04:20.599> parallels<00:04:21.019> lets<00:04:21.410> me<00:04:21.590> have<00:04:21.769> a

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:21.799 
using the parallels lets me have a

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:23.529 
using the parallels lets me have a
consistent<00:04:22.400> point<00:04:22.550> of<00:04:22.729> alignment<00:04:23.180> so<00:04:23.300> I<00:04:23.360> can

00:04:23.529 --> 00:04:23.539 
consistent point of alignment so I can

00:04:23.539 --> 00:04:25.330 
consistent point of alignment so I can
pull<00:04:23.690> this<00:04:23.780> up<00:04:24.020> and<00:04:24.199> drop<00:04:24.740> it<00:04:24.889> down<00:04:24.919> and<00:04:25.250> come

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:25.340 
pull this up and drop it down and come

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:27.159 
pull this up and drop it down and come
back<00:04:25.370> to<00:04:25.639> the<00:04:25.699> same<00:04:25.849> spot<00:04:26.030> if<00:04:26.780> I'm<00:04:26.960> cutting

00:04:27.159 --> 00:04:27.169 
back to the same spot if I'm cutting

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:28.839 
back to the same spot if I'm cutting
multiples<00:04:27.710> on<00:04:27.860> the<00:04:27.919> same<00:04:28.099> part<00:04:28.370> I<00:04:28.490> can<00:04:28.669> easily

00:04:28.839 --> 00:04:28.849 
multiples on the same part I can easily

00:04:28.849 --> 00:04:32.499 
multiples on the same part I can easily
put<00:04:29.750> multiples<00:04:30.320> of<00:04:30.470> the<00:04:30.590> same<00:04:30.740> part<00:04:31.039> down<00:04:31.639> but

00:04:32.499 --> 00:04:32.509 
put multiples of the same part down but

00:04:32.509 --> 00:04:34.839 
put multiples of the same part down but
also<00:04:33.110> a<00:04:33.590> lot<00:04:34.099> of<00:04:34.220> times<00:04:34.400> when<00:04:34.550> you're<00:04:34.669> cutting

00:04:34.839 --> 00:04:34.849 
also a lot of times when you're cutting

00:04:34.849 --> 00:04:36.879 
also a lot of times when you're cutting
apart<00:04:35.240> the<00:04:35.479> CMC<00:04:35.870> needs<00:04:36.080> some<00:04:36.289> access<00:04:36.650> to<00:04:36.770> the

00:04:36.879 --> 00:04:36.889 
apart the CMC needs some access to the

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:38.890 
apart the CMC needs some access to the
outside<00:04:37.310> of<00:04:37.340> it<00:04:37.610> if<00:04:38.060> I<00:04:38.240> put<00:04:38.509> it<00:04:38.599> right<00:04:38.630> up

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:38.900 
outside of it if I put it right up

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:40.689 
outside of it if I put it right up
against<00:04:39.199> the<00:04:39.380> material<00:04:39.530> that<00:04:40.280> against<00:04:40.550> this

00:04:40.689 --> 00:04:40.699 
against the material that against this

00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:44.159 
against the material that against this
stop<00:04:41.060> I<00:04:41.389> would<00:04:41.900> be<00:04:42.020> cutting<00:04:42.259> into<00:04:42.470> this<00:04:42.710> stop

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:44.169 
stop I would be cutting into this stop
