is your purchase it from from your
dealer<00:00:24.330> first<00:00:24.960> and<00:00:25.109> foremost<00:00:25.260> the<00:00:26.010> actual

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
dealer first and foremost the actual

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.839 
dealer first and foremost the actual
visor<00:00:27.150> seal<00:00:27.750> is<00:00:28.529> left<00:00:28.769> intact<00:00:28.949> inside<00:00:29.580> the

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
visor seal is left intact inside the

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.209 
visor seal is left intact inside the
base<00:00:30.000> rubber<00:00:30.300> again<00:00:30.929> is<00:00:31.199> also<00:00:31.500> left<00:00:31.740> in<00:00:31.949> place

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
base rubber again is also left in place

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:33.860 
base rubber again is also left in place
and<00:00:32.579> again<00:00:32.940> if<00:00:33.059> this<00:00:33.210> is<00:00:33.360> removed<00:00:33.690> it<00:00:33.840> will

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
and again if this is removed it will

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.170 
and again if this is removed it will
never<00:00:34.079> actually<00:00:34.230> go<00:00:34.440> back<00:00:34.620> on<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:34.980> same<00:00:35.190> so<00:00:35.579> to

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
never actually go back on the same so to

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.760 
never actually go back on the same so to
do<00:00:36.300> that<00:00:36.329> would<00:00:36.660> mean<00:00:36.809> destroying<00:00:37.230> the<00:00:37.440> helmet

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
do that would mean destroying the helmet

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.350 
do that would mean destroying the helmet
the<00:00:38.040> rest<00:00:38.280> is<00:00:38.460> pretty<00:00:38.790> easy<00:00:39.590> to<00:00:40.590> dismantle<00:00:41.360> the

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
the rest is pretty easy to dismantle the

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.869 
the rest is pretty easy to dismantle the
exterior<00:00:42.840> vents<00:00:43.160> that<00:00:44.160> they<00:00:44.250> can<00:00:44.670> be<00:00:44.760> removed

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
exterior vents that they can be removed

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.700 
exterior vents that they can be removed
painted<00:00:45.570> separately<00:00:46.050> and<00:00:46.200> then<00:00:46.260> reapplied

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
painted separately and then reapplied

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.430 
painted separately and then reapplied
afterwards<00:00:47.360> which<00:00:48.360> is<00:00:48.480> great<00:00:48.809> because

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
afterwards which is great because

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.959 
afterwards which is great because
basically<00:00:49.739> just<00:00:50.160> means<00:00:50.340> that<00:00:50.460> you<00:00:50.579> get<00:00:50.730> a<00:00:50.789> much

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
basically just means that you get a much

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.670 
basically just means that you get a much
cleaner<00:00:51.210> finish<00:00:51.449> and<00:00:51.930> also<00:00:52.079> these<00:00:52.440> are

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
cleaner finish and also these are

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.560 
cleaner finish and also these are
damaged<00:00:53.039> later<00:00:53.280> on<00:00:53.460> after<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.329> paintwork

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
damaged later on after the the paintwork

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.479 
damaged later on after the the paintwork
they<00:00:54.989> can<00:00:55.140> be<00:00:55.260> removed<00:00:55.500> repainted<00:00:56.370> and

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
they can be removed repainted and

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.389 
they can be removed repainted and
replaced<00:00:56.850> again<00:00:57.440> also<00:00:58.440> there<00:00:58.680> is<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:58.800> advice

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
replaced again also there is the advice

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.619 
replaced again also there is the advice
of<00:00:59.430> piety<00:00:59.789> mechanism<00:01:01.039> one<00:01:02.039> of<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.190> great<00:01:02.629> one

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
of piety mechanism one of the great one

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.539 
of piety mechanism one of the great one
of<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.809> great<00:01:04.019> features<00:01:04.049> of<00:01:04.650> a<00:01:04.890> narrow<00:01:05.070> helmet

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
of the great features of a narrow helmet

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.969 
of the great features of a narrow helmet
is<00:01:05.670> that<00:01:05.850> these<00:01:06.000> side<00:01:06.360> pots<00:01:06.979> removed

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
is that these side pots removed

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.399 
is that these side pots removed
repainted<00:01:08.909> so<00:01:09.180> what<00:01:09.420> I<00:01:09.450> will<00:01:09.540> do<00:01:09.750> next<00:01:10.020> is<00:01:10.260> I'll

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
repainted so what I will do next is I'll

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.679 
repainted so what I will do next is I'll
remove<00:01:10.740> all<00:01:10.920> these<00:01:11.100> parts<00:01:11.510> but<00:01:12.510> then

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
remove all these parts but then

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.700 
remove all these parts but then
carefully<00:01:13.790> mask<00:01:14.790> out<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.479> areas<00:01:16.110> such<00:01:16.320> as<00:01:16.350> the

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
carefully mask out the areas such as the

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.219 
carefully mask out the areas such as the
rubbers<00:01:17.070> and<00:01:18.030> also<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:18.390> ventilation<00:01:18.990> holes

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
rubbers and also the ventilation holes

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.520 
rubbers and also the ventilation holes
which<00:01:19.590> lie<00:01:19.860> beneath<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.700> diffusers<00:01:21.540> again

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
which lie beneath the diffusers again

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.280 
which lie beneath the diffusers again
they<00:01:22.799> must<00:01:23.040> be<00:01:23.780> masked<00:01:24.780> out<00:01:24.900> very<00:01:25.229> very

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
they must be masked out very very

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.499 
they must be masked out very very
accurately<00:01:25.890> so<00:01:26.250> that<00:01:26.400> gain<00:01:26.610> their<00:01:26.820> tights<00:01:27.210> and

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
accurately so that gain their tights and

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.810 
accurately so that gain their tights and
those<00:01:27.600> solvents<00:01:27.900> or<00:01:28.290> any<00:01:28.590> paint<00:01:28.950> properties

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
those solvents or any paint properties

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.460 
those solvents or any paint properties
can<00:01:30.000> actually<00:01:30.360> get<00:01:30.540> through<00:01:30.810> and<00:01:30.990> penetrate

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
can actually get through and penetrate

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.590 
can actually get through and penetrate
the<00:01:31.680> historian<00:01:32.460> shell<00:01:32.700> once<00:01:33.119> those<00:01:33.329> are<00:01:33.509> all

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
the historian shell once those are all

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.210 
the historian shell once those are all
removed<00:01:33.930> and<00:01:34.200> if<00:01:34.290> you<00:01:34.380> think<00:01:34.409> is<00:01:34.650> taped<00:01:34.890> up<00:01:35.100> a

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
removed and if you think is taped up a

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.179 
removed and if you think is taped up a
master<00:01:36.229> sufficiently<00:01:37.229> then<00:01:37.770> it's<00:01:37.920> a<00:01:37.979> case

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
master sufficiently then it's a case

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.210 
master sufficiently then it's a case
than<00:01:38.400> they're<00:01:38.520> just<00:01:38.729> wet<00:01:39.000> dry<00:01:39.240> wet<00:01:39.509> flatting

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.220 
than they're just wet dry wet flatting

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:44.240 
than they're just wet dry wet flatting
the<00:01:41.360> the<00:01:42.360> actual<00:01:42.659> shell<00:01:42.960> using<00:01:43.770> a<00:01:43.829> wet/dry

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
the the actual shell using a wet/dry

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.030 
the the actual shell using a wet/dry
flying<00:01:44.579> paper<00:01:44.869> and<00:01:45.869> I<00:01:45.990> basically<00:01:46.259> use<00:01:46.680> a<00:01:46.710> very

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
flying paper and I basically use a very

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.060 
flying paper and I basically use a very
fine<00:01:47.369> graded<00:01:47.970> paper<00:01:48.229> so<00:01:49.229> it<00:01:49.290> doesn't<00:01:49.649> mark<00:01:49.979> the

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
fine graded paper so it doesn't mark the

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.980 
fine graded paper so it doesn't mark the
surface<00:01:50.610> too<00:01:50.939> much<00:01:51.149> it's<00:01:51.390> not<00:01:51.450> too<00:01:51.689> abrasive

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
surface too much it's not too abrasive

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.719 
surface too much it's not too abrasive
but<00:01:52.409> it's<00:01:52.590> just<00:01:52.710> basically<00:01:53.040> takes<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.490> shine

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
but it's just basically takes the shine

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.120 
but it's just basically takes the shine
or<00:01:54.030> enough<00:01:54.630> of<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:54.869> shine<00:01:55.079> away<00:01:55.110> so<00:01:55.439> the<00:01:55.890> paint

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
or enough of the shine away so the paint

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.679 
or enough of the shine away so the paint
then<00:01:56.310> that<00:01:56.460> I<00:01:56.490> apply<00:01:56.939> or<00:01:57.119> the<00:01:57.180> first<00:01:57.420> coat<00:01:57.659> of

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
then that I apply or the first coat of

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.690 
then that I apply or the first coat of
paint<00:01:57.930> i<00:01:58.110> will<00:01:58.380> apply<00:01:58.590> with<00:01:59.159> here<00:01:59.430> to<00:01:59.579> it

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
paint i will apply with here to it

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.030 
paint i will apply with here to it
sufficiently<00:02:00.270> and<00:02:01.140> therefore<00:02:01.560> it<00:02:01.649> makes<00:02:01.860> it

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
sufficiently and therefore it makes it

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.359 
sufficiently and therefore it makes it
more<00:02:02.189> stone<00:02:02.729> chip<00:02:03.570> resistant<00:02:04.110> so<00:02:04.770> that<00:02:05.219> is

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
more stone chip resistant so that is

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.700 
more stone chip resistant so that is
then<00:02:05.549> the<00:02:05.670> next<00:02:05.790> process<00:02:06.170> is<00:02:07.170> just<00:02:07.350> to<00:02:07.500> really

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
then the next process is just to really

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.760 
then the next process is just to really
sort<00:02:08.069> of<00:02:08.190> get<00:02:08.729> it<00:02:08.819> back<00:02:09.000> to

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:09.770 
sort of get it back to

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:12.610 
sort of get it back to
a<00:02:09.830> paintable<00:02:10.490> finish<00:02:10.940> and<00:02:11.900> then<00:02:11.990> yet<00:02:12.260> been<00:02:12.470> the

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
a paintable finish and then yet been the

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.670 
a paintable finish and then yet been the
the<00:02:13.100> actual<00:02:13.480> first<00:02:14.480> base<00:02:14.840> coat<00:02:15.110> color<00:02:15.410> which

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
the actual first base coat color which

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.200 
the actual first base coat color which
will<00:02:15.860> be<00:02:15.980> a<00:02:16.010> very<00:02:16.160> light<00:02:16.460> grade<00:02:16.760> of<00:02:16.880> orange

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:17.210 
will be a very light grade of orange

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:20.950 
will be a very light grade of orange
will<00:02:17.600> be<00:02:17.780> will<00:02:18.230> be<00:02:18.260> ready<00:02:18.530> to<00:02:18.710> supply<00:02:19.570> and<00:02:20.570> yet

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:20.960 
will be will be ready to supply and yet

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:22.960 
will be will be ready to supply and yet
hopefully<00:02:21.500> by<00:02:21.650> then<00:02:21.890> we<00:02:22.160> should<00:02:22.190> be<00:02:22.520> well<00:02:22.880> on

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
hopefully by then we should be well on

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:34.330 
hopefully by then we should be well on
their<00:02:23.060> way<00:02:30.880> stage<00:02:31.880> 2<00:02:32.150> i've<00:02:33.080> met<00:02:33.350> helmet<00:02:34.130> and

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
their way stage 2 i've met helmet and

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.230 
their way stage 2 i've met helmet and
and<00:02:34.990> this<00:02:35.990> stage<00:02:36.280> if<00:02:37.280> you<00:02:37.400> can<00:02:37.580> see<00:02:37.910> i

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:38.240 
and this stage if you can see i

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:41.950 
and this stage if you can see i
basically<00:02:38.900> just<00:02:39.020> applied<00:02:39.530> the<00:02:40.210> the<00:02:41.210> orange

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:41.960 
basically just applied the the orange

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:44.800 
basically just applied the the orange
base<00:02:42.230> color<00:02:42.850> which<00:02:43.850> is<00:02:43.970> designed<00:02:44.150> color<00:02:44.600> that

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
base color which is designed color that

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.580 
base color which is designed color that
that<00:02:45.230> matt<00:02:45.410> wanted<00:02:45.770> to<00:02:45.890> achieve<00:02:47.140> the<00:02:48.140> second

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
that matt wanted to achieve the second

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.720 
that matt wanted to achieve the second
process<00:02:49.490> to<00:02:49.760> this<00:02:49.940> now<00:02:50.470> is<00:02:51.470> to<00:02:51.860> is<00:02:52.280> to<00:02:52.340> add<00:02:52.610> the

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
process to this now is to is to add the

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.140 
process to this now is to is to add the
detailing<00:02:53.210> man<00:02:54.200> actually<00:02:54.560> requires<00:02:55.150> his

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
detailing man actually requires his

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.710 
detailing man actually requires his
initials<00:02:56.630> MK<00:02:57.440> which<00:02:58.340> will<00:02:58.490> actually

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
initials MK which will actually

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.810 
initials MK which will actually
encapsulate<00:02:59.720> the<00:03:00.410> hangouts<00:03:00.740> i'm<00:03:00.980> from<00:03:01.400> pretty

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:01.820 
encapsulate the hangouts i'm from pretty

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:05.350 
encapsulate the hangouts i'm from pretty
much<00:03:01.940> from<00:03:02.150> side<00:03:02.450> angle<00:03:02.930> here<00:03:04.180> which<00:03:05.180> will

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 
much from side angle here which will

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.350 
much from side angle here which will
probably<00:03:05.570> reach<00:03:06.020> around<00:03:06.380> about<00:03:06.790> the<00:03:07.790> middle

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:08.360 
probably reach around about the middle

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.990 
probably reach around about the middle
sector<00:03:08.690> really<00:03:09.380> of<00:03:09.470> the<00:03:09.620> shell<00:03:09.860> from<00:03:10.790> whether

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 
sector really of the shell from whether

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.710 
sector really of the shell from whether
year<00:03:11.240> the<00:03:11.390> visor<00:03:11.770> mechanism<00:03:12.770> sort<00:03:13.250> of<00:03:13.310> end<00:03:13.720> and

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
year the visor mechanism sort of end and

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.120 
year the visor mechanism sort of end and
this<00:03:14.900> will<00:03:15.080> actually<00:03:15.170> wrap<00:03:15.500> around<00:03:15.830> the

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130 
this will actually wrap around the

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:19.240 
this will actually wrap around the
entire<00:03:16.430> back<00:03:17.060> area<00:03:17.990> of<00:03:18.050> the<00:03:18.170> helmet<00:03:18.440> so<00:03:19.190> the

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
entire back area of the helmet so the

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.400 
entire back area of the helmet so the
letters<00:03:19.550> will<00:03:19.730> actually<00:03:20.030> be<00:03:20.180> quite<00:03:20.480> large<00:03:20.720> but

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:21.410 
letters will actually be quite large but

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:23.650 
letters will actually be quite large but
why<00:03:21.890> i<00:03:21.920> intend<00:03:22.340> to<00:03:22.430> do<00:03:22.610> this<00:03:23.240> is<00:03:23.390> something

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:23.660 
why i intend to do this is something

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:26.290 
why i intend to do this is something
that<00:03:23.980> formats<00:03:24.980> and<00:03:25.100> i've<00:03:25.220> discussed<00:03:25.670> when<00:03:26.270> we

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:26.300 
that formats and i've discussed when we

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:29.290 
that formats and i've discussed when we
met<00:03:26.600> and<00:03:26.930> to<00:03:27.110> discuss<00:03:27.380> the<00:03:27.500> design<00:03:28.300> we're

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:29.300 
met and to discuss the design we're

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:31.270 
met and to discuss the design we're
stretching<00:03:29.540> incorporates<00:03:30.500> on<00:03:30.709> detailing<00:03:31.100> in

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 
stretching incorporates on detailing in

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.130 
stretching incorporates on detailing in
this<00:03:31.400> to<00:03:31.550> this<00:03:31.670> world<00:03:31.910> just<00:03:32.180> to<00:03:32.300> make<00:03:32.840> it<00:03:32.870> look

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:33.140 
this to this world just to make it look

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:35.110 
this to this world just to make it look
as<00:03:33.380> though<00:03:33.410> he<00:03:33.800> does<00:03:34.070> stand<00:03:34.700> out<00:03:34.820> from<00:03:35.090> the

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
as though he does stand out from the

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.540 
as though he does stand out from the
base<00:03:35.360> color<00:03:35.570> I<00:03:35.860> just<00:03:36.860> give<00:03:37.100> it<00:03:37.190> a<00:03:37.220> little<00:03:37.370> bit

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:37.550 
base color I just give it a little bit

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:39.550 
base color I just give it a little bit
of<00:03:37.640> fine<00:03:37.850> sort<00:03:38.180> of<00:03:38.240> an<00:03:38.330> edge<00:03:38.450> to<00:03:38.660> it<00:03:38.690> so<00:03:39.020> that<00:03:39.050> it

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
of fine sort of an edge to it so that it

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:40.930 
of fine sort of an edge to it so that it
looks<00:03:39.709> impressive<00:03:40.010> close<00:03:40.370> up<00:03:40.580> as<00:03:40.700> well<00:03:40.850> as

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:40.940 
looks impressive close up as well as

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:43.030 
looks impressive close up as well as
from<00:03:41.060> a<00:03:41.150> distance<00:03:41.570> but<00:03:41.900> once<00:03:42.110> I<00:03:42.230> got<00:03:42.410> to<00:03:42.470> the

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 
from a distance but once I got to the

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:44.770 
from a distance but once I got to the
stage<00:03:43.459> applying<00:03:44.060> the<00:03:44.330> letters<00:03:44.600> and<00:03:44.720> the

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
stage applying the letters and the

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:46.750 
stage applying the letters and the
detail<00:03:45.170> I<00:03:45.380> will<00:03:45.800> show<00:03:45.950> you<00:03:46.010> how<00:03:46.310> that's<00:03:46.640> done

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:46.760 
detail I will show you how that's done

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.100 
detail I will show you how that's done
and<00:03:47.150> show<00:03:47.390> you<00:03:47.420> a<00:03:47.510> couple<00:03:47.630> of<00:03:47.810> the<00:03:47.930> little

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:48.110 
and show you a couple of the little

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:50.380 
and show you a couple of the little
tricks<00:03:48.260> as<00:03:48.470> well<00:03:48.620> that<00:03:48.740> i<00:03:48.800> use<00:03:49.040> and<00:03:49.390> hopefully

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:50.390 
tricks as well that i use and hopefully

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:58.309 
tricks as well that i use and hopefully
it<00:03:50.480> will<00:03:50.570> be<00:03:50.690> successful

00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:58.319 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:03.180 

now<00:03:59.319> it's<00:03:59.530> stage<00:04:00.160> three<00:04:00.519> of<00:04:01.360> the<00:04:02.190> paintwork

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.190 
now it's stage three of the paintwork

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:05.729 
now it's stage three of the paintwork
process<00:04:04.019> basically<00:04:05.019> where<00:04:05.470> I've<00:04:05.590> actually

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:05.739 
process basically where I've actually

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:09.360 
process basically where I've actually
got<00:04:06.129> to<00:04:06.400> now<00:04:06.879> we<00:04:06.940> sort<00:04:07.269> of<00:04:07.300> actually<00:04:08.370> lacquered

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.370 
got to now we sort of actually lacquered

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:11.369 
got to now we sort of actually lacquered
the<00:04:09.700> helmets<00:04:10.090> so<00:04:10.360> that<00:04:10.690> he<00:04:10.810> actually<00:04:10.959> has<00:04:11.349> a

00:04:11.369 --> 00:04:11.379 
the helmets so that he actually has a

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:15.210 
the helmets so that he actually has a
clear<00:04:11.890> coat<00:04:12.129> barrier<00:04:12.720> between<00:04:13.720> the<00:04:14.220> the

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
clear coat barrier between the the

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:18.620 
clear coat barrier between the the
initial<00:04:15.670> base<00:04:15.849> coat<00:04:16.120> color<00:04:16.359> and<00:04:16.630> now<00:04:17.290> with<00:04:17.620> the

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
initial base coat color and now with the

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:21.150 
initial base coat color and now with the
detailer<00:04:19.630> that<00:04:19.840> I'm<00:04:19.930> going<00:04:20.049> to<00:04:20.139> put<00:04:20.320> on<00:04:20.470> top<00:04:20.709> of

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:21.160 
detailer that I'm going to put on top of

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.640 
detailer that I'm going to put on top of
that<00:04:21.310> which<00:04:21.820> consists<00:04:22.300> of<00:04:22.389> the<00:04:22.600> M<00:04:23.169> and<00:04:23.350> the<00:04:23.380> K

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:23.650 
that which consists of the M and the K

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:26.430 
that which consists of the M and the K
of<00:04:24.370> match<00:04:24.580> name<00:04:24.880> with<00:04:25.180> the<00:04:25.449> initials<00:04:25.660> so

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440 
of match name with the initials so

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.230 
of match name with the initials so
basically<00:04:26.889> where<00:04:27.310> I'm<00:04:27.400> at<00:04:27.520> now<00:04:27.550> is<00:04:27.940> everything

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:28.240 
basically where I'm at now is everything

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:31.440 
basically where I'm at now is everything
has<00:04:28.479> been<00:04:28.600> masked<00:04:28.990> up<00:04:29.139> just<00:04:29.710> to<00:04:29.860> reveal<00:04:30.450> the

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:31.450 
has been masked up just to reveal the

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:32.969 
has been masked up just to reveal the
the<00:04:31.690> letters<00:04:31.990> and<00:04:32.110> the<00:04:32.169> shapes<00:04:32.470> that<00:04:32.590> I<00:04:32.710> need

00:04:32.969 --> 00:04:32.979 
the letters and the shapes that I need

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:35.310 
the letters and the shapes that I need
to<00:04:33.100> now<00:04:33.250> spray<00:04:33.610> and<00:04:34.060> what<00:04:34.240> I<00:04:34.270> will<00:04:34.450> do<00:04:34.660> is<00:04:34.960> I'll

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:35.320 
to now spray and what I will do is I'll

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.650 
to now spray and what I will do is I'll
apply<00:04:35.919> a<00:04:36.280> darker<00:04:36.700> shade<00:04:36.729> of<00:04:36.940> orange<00:04:37.180> which

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:37.660 
apply a darker shade of orange which

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:40.530 
apply a darker shade of orange which
will<00:04:37.870> then<00:04:37.990> stand<00:04:38.380> out<00:04:38.880> perfectly<00:04:39.880> upon<00:04:40.389> the

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:40.540 
will then stand out perfectly upon the

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:43.110 
will then stand out perfectly upon the
the<00:04:41.139> base<00:04:41.290> color<00:04:41.560> and<00:04:42.460> you'll<00:04:42.580> be<00:04:42.700> able<00:04:42.790> to<00:04:42.940> see

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:43.120 
the base color and you'll be able to see

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.120 
the base color and you'll be able to see
a<00:04:43.150> key<00:04:43.389> transition<00:04:43.900> between<00:04:44.200> those<00:04:44.500> two<00:04:44.740> so

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:45.130 
a key transition between those two so

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:47.400 
a key transition between those two so
it's<00:04:45.580> not<00:04:45.700> going<00:04:45.880> to<00:04:46.000> be<00:04:46.090> too<00:04:46.419> obvious<00:04:46.720> so<00:04:47.020> that

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:47.410 
it's not going to be too obvious so that

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:49.320 
it's not going to be too obvious so that
it's<00:04:47.979> a<00:04:48.100> very<00:04:48.280> stark<00:04:48.550> color<00:04:48.880> on<00:04:49.030> top<00:04:49.060> of

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:49.330 
it's a very stark color on top of

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:51.450 
it's a very stark color on top of
another<00:04:49.510> but<00:04:49.870> the<00:04:50.650> difference<00:04:50.950> will<00:04:51.130> be<00:04:51.160> clear

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:51.460 
another but the difference will be clear

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:53.310 
another but the difference will be clear
enough<00:04:51.700> and<00:04:51.970> then<00:04:52.389> once<00:04:52.570> I've<00:04:52.750> achieved<00:04:52.870> that

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:53.320 
enough and then once I've achieved that

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:55.290 
enough and then once I've achieved that
then<00:04:53.680> I'll<00:04:53.830> actually<00:04:54.010> go<00:04:54.280> about<00:04:54.400> applying

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:55.300 
then I'll actually go about applying

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:57.510 
then I'll actually go about applying
some<00:04:55.600> of<00:04:55.660> the<00:04:55.750> finer<00:04:55.990> detailing<00:04:56.620> and<00:04:57.340> what<00:04:57.490> I

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:57.520 
some of the finer detailing and what I

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.040 
some of the finer detailing and what I
aim<00:04:57.729> to<00:04:57.760> do<00:04:58.030> is<00:04:58.150> make<00:04:58.330> it<00:04:58.360> look<00:04:58.630> as<00:04:58.750> though<00:04:58.900> the

00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.050 
aim to do is make it look as though the

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:01.020 
aim to do is make it look as though the
letters<00:04:59.350> are<00:04:59.410> actually<00:04:59.710> embossed<00:04:59.979> and<00:05:00.760> raised

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:01.030 
letters are actually embossed and raised

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:03.930 
letters are actually embossed and raised
upon<00:05:01.570> the<00:05:02.500> base<00:05:02.680> color<00:05:03.010> apart<00:05:03.430> from<00:05:03.520> the<00:05:03.669> shell

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:03.940 
upon the base color apart from the shell

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:08.430 
upon the base color apart from the shell
also<00:05:04.780> the<00:05:05.320> various<00:05:05.650> vents<00:05:06.520> and<00:05:06.840> side<00:05:07.840> possible

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:08.440 
also the various vents and side possible

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:13.320 
also the various vents and side possible
so<00:05:09.030> being<00:05:10.030> being<00:05:10.780> masked<00:05:11.110> out<00:05:12.180> because<00:05:13.180> of

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:13.330 
so being being masked out because of

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:14.670 
so being being masked out because of
this<00:05:13.450> the<00:05:13.660> way<00:05:13.840> the<00:05:13.990> design<00:05:14.349> is<00:05:14.560> actually

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:14.680 
this the way the design is actually

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:18.270 
this the way the design is actually
situated<00:05:15.210> the<00:05:16.210> top<00:05:16.419> fence<00:05:16.690> or<00:05:17.560> the<00:05:17.650> diffusers

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:18.280 
situated the top fence or the diffusers

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:22.830 
situated the top fence or the diffusers
on<00:05:19.210> this<00:05:19.479> helmet<00:05:19.800> actually<00:05:20.800> run<00:05:21.039> through<00:05:21.840> the

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:22.840 
on this helmet actually run through the

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:25.529 
on this helmet actually run through the
the<00:05:23.110> detail<00:05:23.560> on<00:05:24.400> the<00:05:24.520> shelves<00:05:24.789> so<00:05:25.180> it's

00:05:25.529 --> 00:05:25.539 
the detail on the shelves so it's

00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:27.360 
the detail on the shelves so it's
important<00:05:25.930> that<00:05:26.050> everything<00:05:26.349> matches<00:05:26.710> and

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:27.370 
important that everything matches and

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:29.670 
important that everything matches and
line<00:05:27.580> up<00:05:27.610> correctly<00:05:28.060> because<00:05:28.630> if<00:05:29.110> it<00:05:29.410> doesn't

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:29.680 
line up correctly because if it doesn't

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:31.170 
line up correctly because if it doesn't
even<00:05:29.979> if<00:05:30.220> it's<00:05:30.340> a<00:05:30.430> couple<00:05:30.729> of<00:05:30.789> millimeters

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:31.180 
even if it's a couple of millimeters

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:33.690 
even if it's a couple of millimeters
around<00:05:31.510> it<00:05:31.780> looks<00:05:32.050> very<00:05:32.110> obvious<00:05:32.680> and<00:05:32.950> it

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:33.700 
around it looks very obvious and it

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:35.670 
around it looks very obvious and it
doesn't<00:05:34.419> look<00:05:34.450> particularly<00:05:34.870> well<00:05:35.289> finished

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:35.680 
doesn't look particularly well finished

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:38.909 
doesn't look particularly well finished
off<00:05:35.860> so<00:05:36.220> I<00:05:36.910> took<00:05:37.210> the<00:05:37.479> time<00:05:37.690> to<00:05:38.260> make<00:05:38.560> sure<00:05:38.620> that

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:38.919 
off so I took the time to make sure that

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:40.980 
off so I took the time to make sure that
everything<00:05:38.950> lines<00:05:39.340> up<00:05:39.520> perfectly<00:05:40.030> and<00:05:40.300> that

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:40.990 
everything lines up perfectly and that

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:49.560 
everything lines up perfectly and that
should<00:05:41.139> give<00:05:41.289> an<00:05:41.620> overall<00:05:41.860> better<00:05:42.070> finish

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:49.570 

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:53.740 

right<00:05:50.570> I'm<00:05:50.900> not<00:05:51.110> a<00:05:51.170> final<00:05:51.590> stages<00:05:52.010> now<00:05:52.270> of<00:05:53.270> the

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:53.750 
right I'm not a final stages now of the

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:54.760 
right I'm not a final stages now of the
hammock<00:05:54.020> before<00:05:54.320> it<00:05:54.380> actually<00:05:54.470> goes<00:05:54.740> to

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:54.770 
hammock before it actually goes to

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:57.610 
hammock before it actually goes to
spinal<00:05:55.190> apricots<00:05:55.790> and<00:05:56.120> as<00:05:56.990> you<00:05:57.110> can<00:05:57.260> see<00:05:57.290> i'm

00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:57.620 
spinal apricots and as you can see i'm

00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:59.230 
spinal apricots and as you can see i'm
basically<00:05:57.980> now<00:05:58.250> getting<00:05:58.580> ready<00:05:58.700> just<00:05:59.120> to

00:05:59.230 --> 00:05:59.240 
basically now getting ready just to

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:03.000 
basically now getting ready just to
apply<00:05:59.740> very<00:06:00.740> finer<00:06:01.010> details<00:06:01.550> to<00:06:02.420> the<00:06:02.510> letters

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:03.010 
apply very finer details to the letters

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:05.710 
apply very finer details to the letters
just<00:06:04.010> to<00:06:04.100> basically<00:06:04.280> enhance<00:06:05.240> them<00:06:05.450> slightly

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:05.720 
just to basically enhance them slightly

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:07.900 
just to basically enhance them slightly
and<00:06:06.260> to<00:06:06.470> give<00:06:06.650> them<00:06:06.950> a<00:06:07.190> little<00:06:07.370> bit<00:06:07.580> more<00:06:07.730> of<00:06:07.820> an

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:07.910 
and to give them a little bit more of an

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:10.360 
and to give them a little bit more of an
impressive<00:06:08.390> feel<00:06:08.600> above<00:06:09.200> the<00:06:09.950> base<00:06:10.130> coat

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:10.370 
impressive feel above the base coat

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:12.430 
impressive feel above the base coat
color<00:06:10.610> this<00:06:10.940> is<00:06:11.000> how<00:06:11.300> I've<00:06:11.450> mask<00:06:11.750> these<00:06:11.990> areas

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:12.440 
color this is how I've mask these areas

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:14.650 
color this is how I've mask these areas
out<00:06:12.650> using<00:06:13.040> fine<00:06:13.370> line<00:06:13.610> tape<00:06:13.850> or<00:06:14.030> masking<00:06:14.150> tape

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:14.660 
out using fine line tape or masking tape

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:17.920 
out using fine line tape or masking tape
which<00:06:15.500> gives<00:06:15.680> me<00:06:15.800> a<00:06:15.830> financial<00:06:16.550> fine<00:06:16.760> line<00:06:17.060> and

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:17.930 
which gives me a financial fine line and

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:19.960 
which gives me a financial fine line and
I'm<00:06:18.050> able<00:06:18.230> then<00:06:18.590> to<00:06:18.620> come<00:06:19.340> introduce<00:06:19.610> the

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:19.970 
I'm able then to come introduce the

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:22.000 
I'm able then to come introduce the
color<00:06:20.210> to<00:06:20.690> build<00:06:20.900> the<00:06:21.050> color<00:06:21.260> and<00:06:21.500> depths<00:06:21.890> and

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:22.010 
color to build the color and depths and

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:25.420 
color to build the color and depths and
layers<00:06:22.220> and<00:06:23.090> this<00:06:23.270> would<00:06:23.510> or<00:06:24.080> should<00:06:24.430> then

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:25.430 
layers and this would or should then

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:26.680 
layers and this would or should then
sort<00:06:25.700> of<00:06:25.730> just<00:06:25.910> promote<00:06:26.240> the

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:26.690 
sort of just promote the

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:27.700 
sort of just promote the
three-dimensional<00:06:27.320> effect<00:06:27.380> that<00:06:27.620> I'm

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:27.710 
three-dimensional effect that I'm

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:29.470 
three-dimensional effect that I'm
looking<00:06:27.800> for<00:06:27.980> so<00:06:28.490> what's<00:06:28.700> up<00:06:28.790> to<00:06:29.120> that<00:06:29.240> stage

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:29.480 
looking for so what's up to that stage

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:31.120 
looking for so what's up to that stage
I'll<00:06:29.690> show<00:06:29.900> you<00:06:29.990> what<00:06:30.410> that<00:06:30.470> looks<00:06:30.590> like<00:06:30.830> and

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:31.130 
I'll show you what that looks like and

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:37.180 
give you an overall sort of feel of how
the<00:06:34.490> design<00:06:34.910> will<00:06:35.150> will<00:06:35.840> work<00:06:35.990> out<00:06:36.260> and<00:06:37.070> then

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:37.190 
the design will will work out and then

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:39.370 
the design will will work out and then
it's<00:06:37.370> time<00:06:37.580> to<00:06:37.640> put<00:06:38.300> the<00:06:38.480> the<00:06:38.510> final<00:06:38.960> lap<00:06:39.200> of

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:39.380 
it's time to put the the final lap of

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:41.470 
it's time to put the the final lap of
coats<00:06:39.650> on<00:06:39.800> and<00:06:39.950> then<00:06:40.490> by<00:06:40.820> that<00:06:40.850> point<00:06:41.210> I'm

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:41.480 
coats on and then by that point I'm

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:43.570 
coats on and then by that point I'm
pretty<00:06:41.630> close<00:06:41.990> to<00:06:42.200> being<00:06:42.500> finished<00:06:42.710> the<00:06:43.370> only

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:43.580 
pretty close to being finished the only

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:44.950 
pretty close to being finished the only
thing<00:06:43.760> that<00:06:43.880> he's<00:06:44.000> left<00:06:44.210> then<00:06:44.420> is<00:06:44.600> just<00:06:44.750> to

thing that he's left then is just to

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:46.990 
thing that he's left then is just to
reassemble<00:06:45.650> the<00:06:45.740> helmet<00:06:46.040> and<00:06:46.220> give<00:06:46.580> it<00:06:46.610> a<00:06:46.700> good
