also in a variety of conditions so today
we're<00:00:16.680> looking<00:00:16.710> at<00:00:17.039> three<00:00:17.279> of<00:00:17.400> these<00:00:17.490> areas

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
we're looking at three of these areas

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.029 
we're looking at three of these areas
particularly<00:00:18.570> where<00:00:18.900> you'd<00:00:19.109> look<00:00:19.289> standing

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
particularly where you'd look standing

up on your PwC and advanced earning
technique<00:00:23.630> the<00:00:24.630> first<00:00:24.660> thing<00:00:25.109> we're<00:00:25.260> going<00:00:25.380> to

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
technique the first thing we're going to

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.380 
technique the first thing we're going to
look<00:00:25.590> at<00:00:25.769> for<00:00:26.039> advanced<00:00:26.369> riders<00:00:26.849> is<00:00:27.029> where<00:00:27.269> you

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
look at for advanced riders is where you

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.480 
look at for advanced riders is where you
should<00:00:27.570> be<00:00:27.689> looking<00:00:27.720> it<00:00:28.470> may<00:00:28.680> sound<00:00:28.980> odd<00:00:29.189> but<00:00:29.369> I

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
should be looking it may sound odd but I

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.099 
should be looking it may sound odd but I
see<00:00:29.730> many<00:00:29.939> riders<00:00:30.210> out<00:00:30.449> there<00:00:30.510> looking<00:00:30.929> at<00:00:31.019> the

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
see many riders out there looking at the

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.380 
see many riders out there looking at the
wrong<00:00:31.349> things<00:00:31.890> it's<00:00:32.610> great<00:00:32.820> to<00:00:33.059> look<00:00:33.180> at<00:00:33.270> the

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
wrong things it's great to look at the

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.510 
wrong things it's great to look at the
scenery<00:00:33.630> around<00:00:33.870> you<00:00:34.230> and<00:00:34.559> even<00:00:34.890> other<00:00:35.070> riders

scenery around you and even other riders

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.580

but<00:00:35.910> only<00:00:36.180> a<00:00:36.300> few<00:00:36.510> are<00:00:36.630> confident<00:00:37.140> conditions

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
but only a few are confident conditions

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.130 
but only a few are confident conditions
will<00:00:37.739> stay<00:00:37.950> consistent<00:00:38.719> similarly<00:00:39.719> if<00:00:39.870> you

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
will stay consistent similarly if you

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.470 
will stay consistent similarly if you
want<00:00:40.170> to<00:00:40.410> rider<00:00:40.649> increase<00:00:41.190> speed<00:00:41.489> then<00:00:42.300> where

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
want to rider increase speed then where

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.299 
want to rider increase speed then where
you<00:00:42.600> are<00:00:42.719> looking<00:00:42.960> becomes<00:00:43.350> very<00:00:43.649> important

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
you are looking becomes very important

you are looking becomes very important
the<00:00:45.000> first<00:00:45.270> rule<00:00:45.510> here<00:00:45.809> is<00:00:45.930> always<00:00:46.200> look<00:00:46.350> ahead

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
the first rule here is always look ahead

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.010 
the first rule here is always look ahead
don't<00:00:47.219> look<00:00:47.430> at<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.610> very<00:00:47.820> front<00:00:48.000> of<00:00:48.239> your<00:00:48.300> PwC

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
don't look at the very front of your PwC

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.439 
don't look at the very front of your PwC
or<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.530> horizon<00:00:50.070> rather<00:00:50.610> try<00:00:51.149> and<00:00:51.329> look

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
or the horizon rather try and look

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.779 
or the horizon rather try and look
around<00:00:51.600> 50<00:00:52.140> meters<00:00:52.410> in<00:00:52.530> front<00:00:52.770> of<00:00:52.860> you<00:00:53.039> on<00:00:53.280> the

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
around 50 meters in front of you on the

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:54.490 
around 50 meters in front of you on the

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.810 
water
head<00:00:55.500> position<00:00:55.680> is<00:00:56.070> also<00:00:56.399> something<00:00:56.699> that's

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
head position is also something that's

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.819 
head position is also something that's
pretty<00:00:57.239> simple<00:00:57.480> and<00:00:57.780> not<00:00:58.079> thought<00:00:58.289> about<00:00:58.559> much

pretty simple and not thought about much

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.979 
pretty simple and not thought about much
but<00:00:59.460> it's<00:00:59.579> vital<00:01:00.059> to<00:01:00.180> remember<00:01:00.629> your<00:01:00.840> head

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
but it's vital to remember your head

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.569 
but it's vital to remember your head
should<00:01:01.170> always<00:01:01.379> be<00:01:01.590> perpendicular<00:01:01.829> to<00:01:02.340> the

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
stage you'll need to look at standing up

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.570 
stage you'll need to look at standing up

standing<00:01:30.299> up<00:01:30.420> on<00:01:30.540> your<00:01:30.689> PW<00:01:31.020> so<00:01:31.320> you<00:01:31.439> can

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
standing up on your PW so you can

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.800 
standing up on your PW so you can
significantly<00:01:31.860> reduce<00:01:32.430> fatigue<00:01:32.880> as<00:01:33.360> the

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
significantly reduce fatigue as the

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.539 
significantly reduce fatigue as the
craft<00:01:34.049> isn't<00:01:34.320> hitting<00:01:34.799> you<00:01:34.890> in<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.070> backside

quite<00:01:35.909> so<00:01:36.090> much<00:01:36.240> but<00:01:36.540> remember<00:01:37.200> as<00:01:37.350> a<00:01:37.380> result

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
quite so much but remember as a result

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.380 
quite so much but remember as a result
you'll<00:01:38.220> need<00:01:38.430> strong<00:01:38.759> legs<00:01:39.030> and<00:01:39.180> knees

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
you'll need strong legs and knees

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.539 
you'll need strong legs and knees
compensate<00:01:40.320> or<00:01:40.710> your<00:01:40.920> fatigue<00:01:41.280> will<00:01:41.460> be

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
compensate or your fatigue will be

compensate or your fatigue will be
increased<00:01:42.030> instead<00:01:42.600> of<00:01:42.720> reducing

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:43.689
