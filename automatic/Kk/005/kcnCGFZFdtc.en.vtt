00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:04.980

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.240
 mahd presentation of kazuma land in the 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.599
 version 7 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:12.509
 with an incredible new version 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.340
 stylus madness the sir robin has us 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.500
 so to speak, just before Christmas 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.720
 provided beautiful pictures 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.270
 beautifully written description 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.710
 on murder hoster and also the mods the 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:28.109
 you need animation webtrekk 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:29.789
 grower and jobs straw as well 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:33.840
 stateless friends we will not be here 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:35.489
 We wait a long time for the commissioner 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.059
 Friends gambled the hobby for the 13th 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:41.640
 friends would bid 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.110
 this is going to be 60 but 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.879
 Activate fly again 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.390
 of course, the me can 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:51.149
 Meter-accurate already and also various 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.640
 Just ignore things because 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.620
 usually like to fly what they use 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.739
 I certainly drove well at the yard 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.719
 here in baselland is the fact that 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.539
 the really very cool place with these 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.400
 Timber framed brick houses and barns 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.710
 that look really good 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:11.790
 and we also have a kärcher horny 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:14.070
 placed and here, for example 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.939
 ever to open this gate with a 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.830
 Barn inside 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.990
 So you do not get the horny details 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:23.900
 stories and also some city 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:26.400
 Vehicles so here eg vehicles here 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:28.890
 visible crass state vehicles what you 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.200
 look exactly like friends would now 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.150
 Of course you will be there accordingly 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.479
 To tax you should the sheaf of man 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:39.180
 xm - like everything else 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.850
 and then only lonely okay so very 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.399
 a lot of crass tractors 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:48.659
 frontlader history but there together 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:53.420
 of course the max 5 and the committee 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:56.009
 machines us where we have a lot here 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:02:00.229
 while it or with dungstreuer here 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:02.579
 liquid manure times seen 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:04.430
 that is now one of the church that grew 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:08.310
 mountain has seen the norma 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:10.679
 Wind turbine is interesting because you 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.560
 relatively difficult for heard 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.840
 one is coming 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.550
 This is real looks and what is mine 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.989
 Well , that's really great 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:19.120
 surfaces or to turn around 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:21.040
 So here you can definitely comforted the 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.450
 already a larger machines play this 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.860
 is not a problem friends at all 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.989
 we'll take a look at the map in the 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.060
 Survey where there is definitely one 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:32.590
 is worth mentioning is fact that 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:35.650
 We are well arranged here and there only 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:39.130
 the fact that we are doing relatively well here 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:42.400
 except for this one - so below and below 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:43.600
 The name and description are there 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.560
 There is really nothing to complain about 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.110
 some fields 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:49.180
 I would even say cautious 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.830
 that this map he is for the multiplayer 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.959
 you then the state vehicles so 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:55.000
 the map is maybe a bit 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:57.040
 difficult to get, of course, logically 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.870
 but I think a bit difficult 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.940
 is to edit in singleplayer 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.069
 So friends do not play in the wörz 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:05.250
 I do not have to say single more here 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:08.080
 could you have been happy going 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:10.000
 start and we'll take a look 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:12.190
 they are just ahead of important points 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.180
 important feel this is the one 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:16.780
 Naturally 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:18.190
 Here you can see the landscape you have to 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.900
 Look how you drive here once 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:23.019
 river place where you absolutely have to perform 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:27.880
 Maybe we would like and up front 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:33.600
 a lake a big one with the mill as 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:33.600
 the sawmill that would be interesting 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:40.540
 okay that does not matter if that does not matter where 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:44.440
 forests trees 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:47.470
 in total, 8000 trees have about four 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:50.290
 haven mad for here times the 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:53.859
 forestry with the sale of 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:56.230
 tree trunks per train, he fits well 

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:58.030
 So think here you have the same trees us 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:01.180
 you can already see the bgh back there 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:04.120
 friends there you can already here 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:07.299
 the bgh is working coarser 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:09.370
 here there are bland as the driveway and 

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:11.650
 Here it goes over and you can only because 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:12.940
 use what I find very sympathetic 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:15.430
 have to be honest when you go here 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:17.680
 has just as unterstand because just on the 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:19.120
 map come almost directly maison friends 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:26.170
 here 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:33.400
 I have him going on here should be lager 

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:36.470
 So we have here in the version ok 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:38.780
 some things happen at the garden center 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:41.660
 Sawmill is added 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:44.450
 power plant is to come klee and 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:47.900
 lucerne added what next 

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:51.500
 times made at lidl mineral water but 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:54.800
 nothing else here is the shop about who 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:58.550
 others do not humor what to do 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:01.490
 bisserl what was going on a customer in the future 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:04.790
 big wide flat land it insane 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:06.620
 okay that's really blatant what only customers in 

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:08.620
 future requires disregard 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:11.540
 namely pigs and cattle breeding plants 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:14.780
 Signage is completed there 

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:17.540
 will be revised and depending on where you are 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:21.590
 now is on invasions hobbies friends 

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:25.450
 then also considered something nice 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:28.450
 is now and now 

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:30.470
 is the fact that here 

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:33.320
 economic cycles are planned 

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:34.490
 that may of course be curious what 

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:37.100
 in the next versions 

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:39.170
 only so will come who is looking for the app 

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:43.250
 for multiplayer will definitely be 

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:45.260
 so find here so great free maps net 

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:46.670
 klasing how obstructed is one 

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:50.000
 is plastered with any 

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:51.650
 Deco products will definitely be fun 

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.380
 you can say that 

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:59.480
 otherwise I would not know anyone what I did 

00:05:54.380 --> 00:06:00.980
 to say you have nothing to follow there 

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:02.639
 more that I say thank you for 

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:04.319
