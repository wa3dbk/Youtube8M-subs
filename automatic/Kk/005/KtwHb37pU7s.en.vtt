00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:08.950
 Today is the blog of the live door 

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:12.480
 Paste the number of routes etc. in bulk to the above thing 

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:12.480
 I will explain the way 

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:22.800
 This is a blog of Lifeza I created for testing 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:22.800
 So we will insert ads in bulk here 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:29.460
 First of all 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:32.970
 As a method, first login to the live door 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:37.740
 Then it will come to my page like this 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:43.760
 Click the place to say here on the blog settings and 

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:43.760
 Click the place called blog parts here since the screen is switched 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:51.230
 This is the screen, so next is 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.230
 Click on the place of customization 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:58.460
 Of a little more at the bottom 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:58.460
 It's an individual article page, click here 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:03.990
 Here is 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:08.430
 Of each fabric of the blog 

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:10.770
 It looks like a template for all pages, so here 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:18.710
 In bulk 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:18.710
 You can insert the ad into all articles at once by modifying here 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:28.750
 It is dry street to see 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:31.000
 A lot of alphabets which seem very difficult for people who do not understand are lined up 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:33.200
 This alphabet 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:37.200
 It is Toka symbol and the face 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:42.020
 I delete one letter by mistake 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:49.040
 The whole thing is because George sometimes gets weird 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:56.210
 Be sure to make a backup as a precaution before you mess with this 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:58.159
 It is easy to take a backup, and paste and save all of them in text or long 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:01.610
 only 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:04.390
 Right-click here to do all the strategies 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:09.150
 Because you can choose all this 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:09.150
 Right click once more to copy 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:16.340
 Because it is a notepad of windows 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:19.920
 If pasting is done, the current state is all 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:26.099
 I will paste it, so leave this 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:28.420
 If the wrong place is erased by mistake and the display becomes weird, the original 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:32.880
 Can be returned to 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.880
 Please be sure to take a backup 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:40.490
 Real 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:42.520
 It is a method to put a report, but in this individual article page 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:46.200
 If you go below 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:48.440
 There is an article body 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.470
 The whole article is a bit 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:55.440
 Because like watching 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:58.500
 It is that the article body Please do not confuse 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:01.520
 Surprised mark after the key date - 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.650
 It is the person who is the article text 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:05.910
 If you find this 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:08.180
 9 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:10.850
 Up and down 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:13.860
 I will tag the ad 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:16.400
 In the ad tab 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:23.010
 Something like a template 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:29.269
 Oite placed up to leave the plate at the description of the bottom of this video 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:29.269
 I will be able to paste by copy paste, so please try using it 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:37.379
 So First First It is the upper part of the article body 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.379
 In the context of the detective body 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:44.060
 Tag the top of the dog plate 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:47.020
 Paste 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.020
 It feels like this 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:57.390
 No salt in the article text and one more article text below 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:04:02.190

 Will attach 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:16.790
 Then we will look at and press the button that says this preview 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:16.790
 Contains the Tteyuu this is it Adsense 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:20.820
 Even under the article 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:22.600
 Adsense is included 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:24.760
 Yeah eh 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:26.980
 with this 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:33.030
 In the above 

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:33.030
 It was a good sense and it was still time but now I can insert this 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:37.840
 Then let's actually save and see 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:42.260
 It is the blog of the beginning 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:48.849
 In this way the dough 

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:52.409
 Top and dough 

00:04:48.849 --> 00:04:52.409
 I 'm writing adsense 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:57.880
 This is it 

00:04:55.449 --> 00:05:00.980
 Because it is a template now 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:07.720
 I endure the adsense with letters 

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:12.260
 Tags here for adsense tags with their own adsense tap 

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:14.230
 Even if you are not a teacher after all, it is an ad of 8 nets 

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:16.200
 Fish that is an advertisement for sp 

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:22.100
 If you paste it here 

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:22.100
 You can display the ad in one place in all articles 

00:05:24.689 --> 00:05:28.370
 adsense's 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:30.270
 Recommended 

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:33.680
 As an explanation 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:37.139
 Well, there are many ways to do this 

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:40.199
 There is no need to worry in particular 

00:05:37.139 --> 00:05:42.750
 As the way you are pretty reaction is said to be good 

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:46.160
 On the top of the dough 

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:46.160
 Say I link unit 

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:51.160
 adsense's 

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:53.660
 Link Uni 

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:55.550
 To see this 

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:59.410
 Next in this kind of form 

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:59.410
 It is of the type where the link is lined up 

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:06.980
 This is on the dough 

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:06.980
 It is said that you are 

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:13.280
 In the lower part of the article is also the text fragrant wood 

00:06:13.449 --> 00:06:18.700
 Guy is in Rectangle 

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:20.790
 300 open 250 

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:25.210
 Because I think the size of 

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:31.210
 This is said to be effective under the article 

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:34.229
 As this is way of personal preference already , put your favorite things on it 

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:34.229
 But I think that should I put 

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:43.729
 If you are wondering which one to put on, let's just make a rectangle on the top 

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:49.270
 On the top with link trigger 

00:06:43.729 --> 00:06:49.270
 I think it is better to put a land table below the article 

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:52.170
 that's all
