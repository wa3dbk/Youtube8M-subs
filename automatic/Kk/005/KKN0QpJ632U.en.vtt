favorite<00:01:09.220> out<00:01:09.340> of<00:01:09.369> all<00:01:09.580> the<00:01:09.729> weeks<00:01:09.909> I<00:01:10.060> ordered

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
favorite out of all the weeks I ordered

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.560 
favorite out of all the weeks I ordered
the<00:01:11.890> length<00:01:12.220> is<00:01:12.900> not<00:01:13.900> super<00:01:14.320> long<00:01:15.330> it's<00:01:16.330> like

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:16.570 
the length is not super long it's like

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:18.690 
the length is not super long it's like
very<00:01:16.810> well<00:01:17.140> layered<00:01:17.470> so<00:01:17.920> it<00:01:18.040> doesn't<00:01:18.369> feel

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:18.700 
very well layered so it doesn't feel

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.249 
very well layered so it doesn't feel
that<00:01:18.759> very<00:01:19.420> heavy<00:01:19.720> but<00:01:20.080> um<00:01:20.259> I'm<00:01:20.740> 5-2<00:01:21.810> this<00:01:22.810> goes

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:23.259 
that very heavy but um I'm 5-2 this goes

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:25.889 
that very heavy but um I'm 5-2 this goes
a<00:01:23.770> little<00:01:24.369> bit<00:01:24.850> higher<00:01:25.090> than<00:01:25.299> my<00:01:25.420> belly<00:01:25.570> button

00:01:25.889 --> 00:01:25.899 
a little bit higher than my belly button

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:30.539 
a little bit higher than my belly button
so<00:01:26.500> I<00:01:26.530> can<00:01:26.590> take<00:01:26.920> that<00:01:27.100> well<00:01:28.830> and<00:01:29.830> there<00:01:30.520> is

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:30.549 
so I can take that well and there is

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:32.520 
so I can take that well and there is
very<00:01:31.090> minimal<00:01:31.299> shedding<00:01:31.899> I<00:01:32.049> think<00:01:32.350> that's

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.530 
very minimal shedding I think that's

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.300 
very minimal shedding I think that's
because<00:01:32.920> if<00:01:33.490> you<00:01:33.549> do<00:01:33.970> brush<00:01:34.300> it<00:01:35.130> since<00:01:36.130> it's

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.310 
because if you do brush it since it's

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:37.919 
because if you do brush it since it's
straight<00:01:36.700> they're<00:01:36.910> not<00:01:37.119> that<00:01:37.270> much<00:01:37.330> the<00:01:37.690> pull

00:01:37.919 --> 00:01:37.929 
straight they're not that much the pull

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:40.260 
straight they're not that much the pull
so<00:01:38.679> the<00:01:39.070> weight<00:01:39.250> was<00:01:39.429> a<00:01:39.460> little<00:01:39.700> bit<00:01:39.820> wavy<00:01:40.030> or

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
so the weight was a little bit wavy or

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:41.880 
so the weight was a little bit wavy or
curly<00:01:40.390> it<00:01:40.960> might<00:01:41.110> get<00:01:41.259> some<00:01:41.409> a<00:01:41.470> little<00:01:41.770> bit

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:41.890 
curly it might get some a little bit

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.279 
curly it might get some a little bit
more<00:01:42.009> so<00:01:42.729> there's<00:01:42.970> not<00:01:43.479> that<00:01:43.539> much<00:01:43.810> shedding

00:01:46.279 --> 00:01:46.289 
more so there's not that much shedding

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:49.350 
more so there's not that much shedding
the<00:01:47.289> week<00:01:47.500> cap<00:01:47.830> so<00:01:48.190> let<00:01:48.610> me<00:01:48.700> take<00:01:48.819> this<00:01:48.970> on<00:01:49.179> for

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590 
amazing

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:55.380 
amazing
the<00:01:53.860> fact<00:01:54.100> that<00:01:54.190> all<00:01:54.310> these<00:01:54.610> things<00:01:54.670> are<00:01:55.210> kind

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.390 
the fact that all these things are kind

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:57.389 
the fact that all these things are kind
of<00:01:55.509> like<00:01:55.659> just<00:01:55.929> swoop<00:01:56.110> to<00:01:56.140> the<00:01:56.409> side<00:01:56.649> and<00:01:57.130> it

00:01:57.389 --> 00:01:57.399 
of like just swoop to the side and it

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:59.880 
of like just swoop to the side and it
still<00:01:57.700> almost<00:01:58.149> looks<00:01:58.479> like<00:01:58.659> skin<00:01:58.960> is<00:01:59.229> so<00:01:59.590> great

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 
still almost looks like skin is so great

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.399 
still almost looks like skin is so great
so<00:02:00.610> this<00:02:00.970> is<00:02:01.210> the<00:02:01.360> wig<00:02:01.539> cap<00:02:01.569> this<00:02:02.050> is<00:02:02.259> the

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:02.409 
so this is the wig cap this is the

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:03.120
