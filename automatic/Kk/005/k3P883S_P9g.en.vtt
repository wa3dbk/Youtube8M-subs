I'm not gonna call the right side his

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:42.220 
I'm not gonna call the right side his
truck<00:05:41.090> cuz<00:05:41.210> he<00:05:41.300> can<00:05:41.420> easily<00:05:41.720> see<00:05:41.870> me<00:05:42.050> through

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:42.230 
truck cuz he can easily see me through

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:47.110 
truck cuz he can easily see me through
that<00:05:42.320> door<00:05:42.530> so<00:05:42.740> I'm<00:05:42.800> going<00:05:42.950> this<00:05:43.070> way<00:05:43.280> and<00:05:46.120> I

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:47.120 
that door so I'm going this way and I

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:48.610
