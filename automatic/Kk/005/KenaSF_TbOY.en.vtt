basically<00:00:50.879> started<00:00:51.270> with<00:00:51.480> this<00:00:51.690> leather<00:00:51.930> crop

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
basically started with this leather crop

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.590 
basically started with this leather crop
top<00:00:52.530> and<00:00:52.800> then<00:00:53.550> I<00:00:53.640> was<00:00:53.789> looking<00:00:53.879> for<00:00:54.270> a<00:00:54.300> bottom

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
top and then I was looking for a bottom

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:55.850 
top and then I was looking for a bottom
to<00:00:54.719> wear<00:00:54.870> with<00:00:55.020> it<00:00:55.170> I<00:00:55.230> didn't<00:00:55.440> want<00:00:55.500> to<00:00:55.649> go<00:00:55.739> with

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
more leather on the bottom because I

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.540 
more leather on the bottom because I
don't<00:00:57.660> like<00:00:57.899> too<00:00:58.260> much<00:00:58.469> leather<00:00:58.829> in<00:00:59.129> one<00:00:59.340> look

I thought they sort of contrasted with
the<00:03:40.810> skirt<00:03:41.200> and<00:03:41.650> the<00:03:41.860> outfit<00:03:42.250> a<00:03:42.459> little<00:03:42.670> bit

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
the skirt and the outfit a little bit

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.449 
the skirt and the outfit a little bit
and<00:03:43.209> we're<00:03:43.450> not<00:03:43.600> the<00:03:44.140> usual<00:03:44.350> expected<00:03:45.250> shoe

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:45.459 
and we're not the usual expected shoe

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:47.699 
and we're not the usual expected shoe
for<00:03:45.700> this<00:03:45.820> look<00:03:46.030> and<00:03:46.209> that's<00:03:46.870> precisely<00:03:47.380> why<00:03:47.680> I

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 
for this look and that's precisely why I

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:49.199

chose<00:03:47.980> them<00:03:48.190> they<00:03:48.459> had<00:03:48.640> sort<00:03:48.940> of<00:03:49.030> that

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:49.209 
chose them they had sort of that

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:50.940 
chose them they had sort of that
schoolgirl<00:03:49.690> vibe<00:03:49.900> to<00:03:50.170> them<00:03:50.320> and<00:03:50.500> I<00:03:50.560> just<00:03:50.770> like
