00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:25.610 
responsive the touch screen is I know
it's<00:02:11.270> a<00:02:11.300> little<00:02:11.420> bit<00:02:11.630> tall

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.530 

so<00:02:26.190> having<00:02:26.430> the<00:02:26.549> optical<00:02:27.000> trap<00:02:27.150> that<00:02:27.180> is<00:02:27.420> a

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
so having the optical trap that is a

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.140 
so having the optical trap that is a
nice<00:02:27.750> feature<00:02:28.530> to<00:02:28.799> make<00:02:29.610> things<00:02:29.819> a<00:02:29.909> little<00:02:30.000> bit

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
nice feature to make things a little bit

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.899 
nice feature to make things a little bit
smoother<00:02:30.599> than<00:02:30.750> navigate<00:02:31.280> we<00:02:32.280> are<00:02:32.489> close<00:02:32.700> the

00:02:32.899 --> 00:02:32.909 
smoother than navigate we are close the

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:39.410 
smoother than navigate we are close the
device<00:02:33.180> just<00:02:33.540> to<00:02:33.659> see<00:02:33.840> how<00:02:33.989> compact<00:02:34.470> it<00:02:34.650> is<00:02:38.420> so

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
device just to see how compact it is so

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:40.820 
device just to see how compact it is so
there's<00:02:39.599> a<00:02:39.659> clamshell<00:02:39.959> device<00:02:40.500> you<00:02:40.709> can

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
there's a clamshell device you can

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.910 
there's a clamshell device you can
actually<00:02:41.060> fold<00:02:42.060> it<00:02:42.239> up<00:02:42.360> and<00:02:42.709> transport<00:02:43.709> it's

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
actually fold it up and transport it's

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.240 
actually fold it up and transport it's
nothing<00:02:44.220> smaller<00:02:44.519> than<00:02:44.670> like<00:02:44.940> a<00:02:44.970> 7-inch<00:02:45.480> Slade

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
nothing smaller than like a 7-inch Slade

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:53.390 
nothing smaller than like a 7-inch Slade
and<00:02:47.820> it's<00:02:48.000> a<00:02:48.120> profile<00:02:49.050> shot<00:02:51.710> the<00:02:52.710> battery<00:02:53.010> pops

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
and it's a profile shot the battery pops

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.940 
and it's a profile shot the battery pops
out<00:02:53.670> from<00:02:53.970> underneath<00:02:54.330> here<00:02:54.810> it<00:02:55.500> does<00:02:55.650> have<00:02:55.800> as

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
out from underneath here it does have as

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:57.770 
out from underneath here it does have as
well<00:02:56.130> today<00:02:56.430> batteries<00:02:56.970> so<00:02:57.240> if<00:02:57.360> we<00:02:57.450> run<00:02:57.600> out<00:02:57.750> of

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
well today batteries so if we run out of

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.690 
well today batteries so if we run out of
juice<00:02:57.900> and<00:02:58.230> always<00:02:58.530> have<00:02:58.710> a<00:02:58.740> spare<00:02:59.070> battery

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
juice and always have a spare battery

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.180 
juice and always have a spare battery
with<00:03:00.150> you<00:03:00.450> to<00:03:00.720> extend<00:03:01.170> your<00:03:01.440> computing<00:03:01.950> on<00:03:02.100> the

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
with you to extend your computing on the

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.250 
with you to extend your computing on the
go<00:03:02.450> let's<00:03:03.450> take<00:03:03.660> a<00:03:03.690> look<00:03:03.870> at<00:03:03.930> some<00:03:04.080> of<00:03:04.200> the

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
go let's take a look at some of the

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.350 
go let's take a look at some of the
ports<00:03:04.560> on<00:03:04.709> this<00:03:04.830> device<00:03:05.160> it<00:03:05.790> does<00:03:05.940> have<00:03:06.120> Wi-Fi

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
ports on this device it does have Wi-Fi

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.780 
ports on this device it does have Wi-Fi
in<00:03:06.840> addition<00:03:07.260> to<00:03:07.380> 3G<00:03:07.860> I'm<00:03:08.370> does<00:03:08.610> have

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
in addition to 3G I'm does have

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.510 
in addition to 3G I'm does have
bluetooth<00:03:09.240> as<00:03:09.510> well<00:03:09.780> yeah

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:12.520 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:15.000 

so<00:03:13.150> here<00:03:13.510> you<00:03:13.720> have<00:03:13.750> it<00:03:14.290> looks<00:03:14.470> like<00:03:14.590> a<00:03:14.620> memory

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
so here you have it looks like a memory

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:19.620 
so here you have it looks like a memory
card<00:03:15.040> a<00:03:15.640> USB<00:03:16.570> port<00:03:16.960> and<00:03:17.170> a<00:03:17.830> close<00:03:18.400> to<00:03:19.030> hdmi

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
card a USB port and a close to hdmi

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:23.220 
card a USB port and a close to hdmi
block<00:03:20.070> with<00:03:21.070> that<00:03:21.250> low<00:03:21.910> hdmi<00:03:22.480> be<00:03:22.660> enabled<00:03:23.110> or

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
block with that low hdmi be enabled or

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:31.910 
block with that low hdmi be enabled or
communities<00:03:23.950> hdmi<00:03:24.640> output<00:03:25.090> you<00:03:25.720> move<00:03:25.900> out

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.170 

that's<00:03:32.920> the<00:03:33.040> top<00:03:33.250> of<00:03:33.400> the<00:03:33.460> device<00:03:33.700> and<00:03:33.760> on<00:03:34.060> the

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
that's the top of the device and on the

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:39.780 
that's the top of the device and on the
other<00:03:34.360> side<00:03:35.250> I<00:03:36.250> don't<00:03:36.670> need<00:03:36.760> the<00:03:37.000> judgment<00:03:38.790> so

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
other side I don't need the judgment so

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:41.220 
other side I don't need the judgment so
it's<00:03:39.940> a<00:03:40.030> sim<00:03:40.240> part<00:03:40.540> underneath<00:03:40.810> the<00:03:41.080> battery

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
it's a sim part underneath the battery

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:52.370 
it's a sim part underneath the battery
then<00:03:41.740> for<00:03:42.190> it<00:03:42.940> just

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:52.380 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:56.000 

so<00:03:53.010> I<00:03:53.070> guess<00:03:53.360> this<00:03:54.360> isn't<00:03:54.570> dissimilar<00:03:54.900> the<00:03:55.470> 3g

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
so I guess this isn't dissimilar the 3g

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:57.620 
so I guess this isn't dissimilar the 3g
model<00:03:56.370> but<00:03:56.490> the<00:03:56.610> 3g<00:03:56.970> model<00:03:57.270> would<00:03:57.360> have<00:03:57.420> the

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
model but the 3g model would have the

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.930 
model but the 3g model would have the
sim<00:03:57.840> card<00:03:57.870> right<00:03:58.290> here<00:03:58.320> that<00:03:58.770> and<00:03:59.100> then<00:03:59.820> it

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 
sim card right here that and then it

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.580 
sim card right here that and then it
looks<00:04:00.090> like<00:04:00.270> you<00:04:00.390> have<00:04:00.480> a<00:04:00.510> style<00:04:00.780> this<00:04:01.020> year<00:04:01.080> on

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
looks like you have a style this year on

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:03.320 
looks like you have a style this year on
the<00:04:01.800> same<00:04:02.010> side<00:04:02.700> with<00:04:02.970> the<00:04:03.060> battery

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:03.330 
the same side with the battery

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:05.990 
the same side with the battery
detachment<00:04:04.050> so<00:04:04.620> you<00:04:04.710> can<00:04:05.040> use<00:04:05.250> the<00:04:05.400> stylist<00:04:05.820> to

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
detachment so you can use the stylist to

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.570 
detachment so you can use the stylist to
navigate<00:04:06.420> the<00:04:06.540> resistive<00:04:07.050> touchscreen<00:04:07.580> it's

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:08.580 
navigate the resistive touchscreen it's

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:11.450 
navigate the resistive touchscreen it's
a<00:04:08.760> four<00:04:09.030> point<00:04:09.240> eight<00:04:09.300> inch<00:04:09.510> resistive<00:04:10.290> 1024<00:04:11.280> x

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:11.460 
a four point eight inch resistive 1024 x

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:14.360 
a four point eight inch resistive 1024 x
600<00:04:11.790> touchscreen<00:04:12.680> great<00:04:13.680> so<00:04:13.920> this<00:04:14.070> is<00:04:14.190> the

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
600 touchscreen great so this is the
