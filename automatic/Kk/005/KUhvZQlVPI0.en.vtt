rather<00:01:05.460> than<00:01:05.670> a<00:01:05.700> theoretical<00:01:06.299> level<00:01:06.450> you<00:01:06.930> can

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
rather than a theoretical level you can

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.810 
rather than a theoretical level you can
learn<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.470> language<00:01:07.500> of<00:01:08.040> engineering<00:01:08.580> how<00:01:08.760> to

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
learn the language of engineering how to

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.330 
learn the language of engineering how to
draw<00:01:09.119> how<00:01:09.450> to<00:01:09.510> do<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:09.869> math<00:01:10.080> all<00:01:10.740> those<00:01:11.070> things

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
draw how to do the math all those things

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.740 
draw how to do the math all those things
that<00:01:11.490> would<00:01:11.610> be<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:11.850> language<00:01:12.060> but<00:01:12.479> it's<00:01:12.630> the

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
that would be the language but it's the

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.690 
that would be the language but it's the
creativity<00:01:13.380> that's<00:01:13.710> really<00:01:14.010> important<00:01:14.490> it's

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
creativity that's really important it's

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.340 
creativity that's really important it's
whether<00:01:14.909> they<00:01:15.119> understand<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.659> concepts<00:01:16.170> and

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
whether they understand the concepts and

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.020 
whether they understand the concepts and
it<00:01:16.439> can<00:01:16.650> they<00:01:16.799> take<00:01:17.040> those<00:01:17.220> concepts<00:01:17.820> and

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
it can they take those concepts and

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.999 
it can they take those concepts and
think<00:01:18.240> about<00:01:18.479> how<00:01:18.630> to<00:01:18.689> apply<00:01:18.930> them<00:01:19.290> need<00:01:19.979> to

think about how to apply them need to

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.280 
think about how to apply them need to

engineering<00:01:46.920> quite<00:01:47.100> a<00:01:47.130> bit<00:01:47.340> that's<00:01:47.640> pretty

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
engineering quite a bit that's pretty

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.030 
engineering quite a bit that's pretty
exciting<00:01:48.060> to<00:01:48.299> me<00:01:48.420> to<00:01:48.869> actually<00:01:49.079> see<00:01:49.320> an<00:01:49.649> idea

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
exciting to me to actually see an idea

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.859 
exciting to me to actually see an idea
through<00:01:50.340> to<00:01:50.549> creation<00:01:51.119> of<00:01:51.299> an<00:01:51.509> actual

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
through to creation of an actual

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.719 
through to creation of an actual
physical<00:01:52.049> product<00:01:52.649> that's<00:01:52.979> really<00:01:53.310> the<00:01:53.549> key

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
physical product that's really the key

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.130 
physical product that's really the key
to<00:01:53.880> engineering<00:01:54.329> is<00:01:54.479> to<00:01:54.509> be<00:01:54.689> able<00:01:54.810> to<00:01:54.990> be

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
to engineering is to be able to be

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.499 
to engineering is to be able to be
involved<00:01:55.439> in<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:56.040> entire<00:01:56.340> process<00:01:56.399> I<00:01:57.149> look

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
involved in the entire process I look

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.539 
involved in the entire process I look
forward<00:01:57.840> to<00:01:57.899> being<00:01:58.409> involved<00:01:58.799> with<00:01:58.979> projects

forward to being involved with projects

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.100 
forward to being involved with projects
that<00:01:59.729> are<00:02:00.240> gonna<00:02:00.329> make<00:02:00.420> a<00:02:00.600> difference<00:02:00.960> in

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
that are gonna make a difference in

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:01.700 
that are gonna make a difference in
people's

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
people's

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.649 
people's
I<00:02:04.190> had<00:02:05.190> a<00:02:05.220> really<00:02:05.580> great<00:02:05.790> experience<00:02:05.970> in<00:02:06.570> this

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
I had a really great experience in this

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:11.090 
I had a really great experience in this
faculty<00:02:07.290> there<00:02:08.039> is<00:02:08.670> so<00:02:08.940> much<00:02:09.179> going<00:02:09.959> on<00:02:10.080> and<00:02:10.649> it

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.100 
faculty there is so much going on and it

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.400 
faculty there is so much going on and it
has<00:02:11.250> so<00:02:11.430> much<00:02:11.580> to<00:02:11.819> offer<00:02:11.850> really<00:02:12.690> enjoyed<00:02:13.260> all

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
has so much to offer really enjoyed all

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.030 
has so much to offer really enjoyed all
the<00:02:13.560> classes<00:02:14.100> and<00:02:14.459> sort<00:02:15.030> of<00:02:15.120> the<00:02:15.630> applied

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
the classes and sort of the applied

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.340 
the classes and sort of the applied
aspect<00:02:17.040> of<00:02:17.280> it<00:02:17.430> all<00:02:17.550> because<00:02:18.270> we<00:02:18.660> have<00:02:18.810> a<00:02:18.840> more

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
aspect of it all because we have a more

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.110 
aspect of it all because we have a more
intimate<00:02:19.800> faculty<00:02:20.400> in<00:02:20.520> the<00:02:20.610> sense<00:02:20.819> that<00:02:20.910> it's

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
intimate faculty in the sense that it's

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.150 
intimate faculty in the sense that it's
not<00:02:21.239> as<00:02:21.480> big<00:02:21.900> as<00:02:22.200> some<00:02:22.620> of<00:02:22.709> the<00:02:22.770> others<00:02:22.980> I'd

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
not as big as some of the others I'd

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.500 
not as big as some of the others I'd
actually<00:02:23.459> see<00:02:23.580> that's<00:02:23.760> one<00:02:23.910> of<00:02:24.000> our<00:02:24.090> strengths

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
actually see that's one of our strengths

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.809 
actually see that's one of our strengths
knowing<00:02:25.140> that<00:02:25.440> the<00:02:25.739> class<00:02:25.980> sizes<00:02:26.220> are<00:02:26.550> fairly

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
knowing that the class sizes are fairly

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:28.850 
knowing that the class sizes are fairly
small<00:02:27.000> and<00:02:27.450> that<00:02:27.600> you're<00:02:27.810> actually<00:02:28.440> forming

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
small and that you're actually forming

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.710 
small and that you're actually forming
an<00:02:28.980> engineering<00:02:29.520> community<00:02:30.120> was<00:02:30.360> something

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
an engineering community was something

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.600 
an engineering community was something
that<00:02:30.750> was<00:02:31.020> really<00:02:31.050> appealing<00:02:31.860> to<00:02:32.010> me<00:02:32.250> when

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
that was really appealing to me when

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.610 
that was really appealing to me when
speaking<00:02:33.030> with<00:02:33.180> professors<00:02:33.870> you<00:02:34.230> can<00:02:34.410> tell

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
speaking with professors you can tell

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.680 
speaking with professors you can tell
that<00:02:34.830> they<00:02:35.040> want<00:02:35.220> you<00:02:35.400> to<00:02:35.519> succeed<00:02:35.910> and<00:02:36.180> they

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
that they want you to succeed and they

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.540 
that they want you to succeed and they
like<00:02:36.930> when<00:02:37.260> students<00:02:37.980> show<00:02:38.130> that<00:02:38.370> they're

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
like when students show that they're

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.360 
like when students show that they're
taking<00:02:39.030> initiative<00:02:39.540> best<00:02:40.220> academics<00:02:41.220> in
