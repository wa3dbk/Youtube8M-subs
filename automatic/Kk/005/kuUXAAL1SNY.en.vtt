00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:09.090
 and it's a team that welcomes you to one more 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:12.360
 video guys this time i'm on 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:15.000
 Fat Room This is a game where you 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.510
 have to use your army of the day night 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.170
 and enhancing your civilization 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:23.760
 Believe it or not and email was worth it. 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:25.890
 another thing guys this different game 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.039
 burial as you may find much 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:31.920
 it does not allow you to control 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:34.890
 one face only, but several faces at the same time 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.750
 time it's a little more strategy than 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.489
 that the terrarium bury is a bit more 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.290
 action where you have only one 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.309
 character is evolving by doing 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.260
 weapons etc. 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.090
 here not here you have endless 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.719
 joking characters do not know if it is 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.430
 infinite 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.440
 but at least nine I know you can 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.230
 have every time you evolve the level 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.390
 You win more one not those at night. 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:58.530
 they have equipment they have will 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:01.070
 themselves and they clearly provide the 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.359
 that you both need to pay is the cake to go 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.309
 how do i evolve monarchy is 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.110
 simple when you start you get 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.180
 with only one I'm not playing here 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.979
 About a couple of hours. 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.650
 so my use is no longer 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:16.320
 evolved and there are more things here like 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.570
 for example I have a kraft station ' 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.840
 workbench I have a place for you 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:24.090
 blacksmith work that allows me 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:28.049
 to build more noble and 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:30.090
 best total good etc each does not have 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.460
 an inventory and inventory of you 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.560
 allows you to call a gun that in the case 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.840
 of this guy is a skeleton a cyber that 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.420
 I got him by killing a skeleton. 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.020
 obviously he also has an ax of 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:45.210
 iron which is the second level of the ax and 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:47.909
 he has the aero peek also the second 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.100
 level of the pib ex the obvious ax always 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.729
 to cut wood ap what is it for 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.759
 you 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:56.219
 dig the tunnels of the dwarves, do not you know 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.079
 that the dwarves they are creatures 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:59.310
 mythologies that they usually love 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:01.680
 dig 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.079
 I love building mines in mine 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.920
 rich and exploring the gold and this game is not 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:07.469
 different 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:10.050
 besides, you can equip something in your 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:12.629
 head on your chest that would be the shirt 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.270
 on your foot and you have a utility 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:15.520
 also the 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.690
 which is a utility galley are several 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.630
 different items that can be 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:21.640
 used this one is the clay niches 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:24.100
 allowed me to climb more easily 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:26.170
 but if I did not want to use the km rain 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.400
 could use the beque pec that increases the 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.890
 amount of items they run 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:32.080
 able to load all items that 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.870
 they catch people they put this 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:37.360
 portal here and then this portal goes to the 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.910
 sky or shop and here are all items 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.200
 that you have or can confuse what 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:43.630
 you can do 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:46.300
 the way you want to tape things is 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:48.520
 very simple you take the container that 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:50.410
 is in the container're not wrong was the 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:52.660
 container recipe is something that you 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:54.640
 if there is something you can use 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:57.520
 because there are other things inside I do not 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:00.910
 I know what's happening to me, it's okay. 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:02.740
 the door galera is an okay and 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:05.770
 you make her I need I need 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:09.310
 of the dineck is wood and would need 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:10.990
 a lock to Iporã where's my one locke 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.750
 lock is a boring thing you have to 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:15.760
 do and you need iron then ok 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.800
 Here we are, let's build an okay 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.690
 let's build to that locke 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:22.330
 you see there you need to put a 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:25.600
 metal here a metal ac here and here 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:28.090
 Butt build a lock now I go 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:30.520
 able to build the wood with ease 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:33.220
 for example, look at the wood in the 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:36.130
 door I'm going to put the loc in the middle 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:38.740
 And the door if I'm not mistaken and face it 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:41.380
 do not let the portable look is loki on 

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:46.209
 half there and fills the rest of the wood 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:49.180
 let's go wood wood wood organ 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:53.620
 mature and one more wood and now 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:55.420
 loc here beauty good so I graffiti 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:58.660
 a door and I'll place where I 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:00.880
 want to like for example here like 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:02.709
 do that will be this line of the 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:05.050
 blacksmith then he'll have to open a 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:06.580
 door to enter very well who does not have 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:08.110
 I hope he can get through 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:10.270
 here but anything we can 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:12.190
 take that door home from here too. 

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:15.280
 small people I build and 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:17.830
 destroys powerful people in that sense 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:20.620
 see then it was a little something that 

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:24.430
 you will be able to spend in the future is 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:26.500
 weapons of fire weapons of firing that 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:28.480
 then have advanced constructions 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:30.130
 you will have another type of roof to 

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:32.590
 you are hone your base 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:36.310
 you will have a grid for you to make a 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:38.590
 place process over there 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:40.510
 Illumination shape leaves the thing 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:43.630
 certain that gives comfort both of thing 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:46.690
 people are the thousand weapons and the 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:48.100
 thousand is solid for you to be a magician your 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:53.380
 ring it can be thin it can be 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:55.510
 myopic ex rocket archer has face lift 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:57.610
 which has higher lift which really crazy 

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:59.800
 this seems to be a game of you your 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:01.600
 goal is to build 1 on a 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:04.120
 possible of course that your world is 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:08.320
 limited okay he's not infinite that 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:10.690
 no minecraft then type have like 

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:12.400
 will be the quotation mark between us that would be 

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:15.010
 So here then I wanted to see I will 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:16.180
 be minerals here in a way that does not 

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:17.590
 I was able to improve 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:20.740
 another thing I forgot to talk to 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:23.230
 you win is that each character he 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:25.150
 have specific skills eg 

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:26.380
 This one is a great swimmer. 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:29.380
 so whenever you need to make a 

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:30.580
 task he has to swim the game to 

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:32.470
 artificial intelligence of the game is 

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:33.850
 probably send it because it is 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:36.729
 intelligent 

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:38.800
 the rangers specializes in hunting 

00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:41.020
 animals then click to hunt 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:43.630
 the animal, for example, I want to hunt and 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:45.850
 it's already worth who will probably send 

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:48.280
 honor to have this blue whiting here that is good 

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:50.950
 not see if we can find it and not 

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:53.229
 It is a pride to know that they can have another 

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:55.510
 but I do not think he did. 

00:05:53.229 --> 00:05:57.310
 André let me see that yesterday's is what 

00:05:55.510 --> 00:06:00.640
 He sent Lohan to have the script. 

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:03.520
 that bearded glasses I do not know if he 

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:06.040
 Send the championship guys I think this 

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:08.260
 is the agent can click on it there is only 

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:12.070
 This damn thing runs like a dog. 

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:15.160
 crazy for I sent the beautiful be alone where 

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:16.630
 do not see any of the blooming is dying 

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:21.550
 I do not know why he sent me time. 

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:22.900
 send lohan a beetle appeared that 

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:24.910
 is attacking every time I have to 

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:27.910
 chopping wood may be the beetle 

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:29.680
 Fall try to kill me, it 's good too. 

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:32.320
 Another interesting thing about the game is that 

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:34.570
 You give me an hour is attacked by a 

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:37.000
 monster bug so if you do not have 

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:39.510
 I will fast evolving enough're 

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.940
 fucked it is possible you lost 

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:43.860
 It is possible that the game and I had so many 

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:46.050
 monsters if you do not have access to the 

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:48.120
 enough they will destroy the whole 

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:50.010
 society kill all theirs at night 

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:52.230
 And then you're going to lose so it's a 

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:53.790
 game where you have a goal that is 

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:56.280
 Build the fucking civilization 

00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:58.920
 possible but you also have a way of 

00:06:56.280 --> 00:07:01.230
 miss mission 06 you may fail in 

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:02.400
 mission if you fail in the mission you have 

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:04.410
 to continue 

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:06.810
 have to create another game unfortunately 

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:09.240
 well I'm here evolving I'm here 

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:11.100
 progressing but I'm staying here for 

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:13.350
 video I hope you understood 

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:14.700
 It's a very complex game. 

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:16.620
 thing you can do 

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:18.900
 but the premise as you have seen is well 

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:20.760
 simple then I thank everyone who 

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:23.160

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:25.140
 next and that's what I like 

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:27.360
 mega delicious 

00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:30.240
 in the video and clicking is two seconds of 

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:31.500
 Your life helps a lot in Monaco, thanks. 

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:32.520
 a boy talking in marketing using a 

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:34.670
 hug 

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:34.670
 went
