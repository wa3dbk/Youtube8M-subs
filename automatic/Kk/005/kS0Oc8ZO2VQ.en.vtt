00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:09.990
 we missed the sun while shooting 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.759
 the African our wonderful 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.830
 Assistant her baywatch outfit 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.830
 rausgeholt and the world my order 

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:25.980
 today it is about usb we talk often of 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.989
 a clinical letter to the danish 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.880
 speed is very pithy but today there is 

00:00:27.989 --> 00:00:32.879
 apps brief is known for that 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:37.710
 that is very very tender they have here 

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:40.470
 a usb strip leun and ph me a us 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.699
 black angus and rico and jerseys 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:44.760
 French means between rib 

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:46.589
 especially tender meat and that will be 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.019
 we prepare today what can be better 

00:00:46.589 --> 00:00:51.059
 Do a perfect day instead 

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:53.220
 just directly grill on one side 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.150
 right and on the other side and it 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:56.790
 let it draw indirectly 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:59.670
 There are even better ways and we do 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:00.689
 talk about pepper before and from here 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.680
 salt 

00:01:00.689 --> 00:01:06.090
 many say no do not do that 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.500
 removes the moisture from the meat 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.619
 but there is a secret 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:15.090
 we put the perfect steak on hey hey 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:17.640
 salt from the grill leadership in front of the 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.900
 gets it right and that's the meat 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.360
 the room temperature has to be assumed 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:25.560
 and then 20 to 30 minutes before 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.210
 no problem then sees why do you 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.820
 it before 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:32.039
 the reason for this is the salt draws 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.329
 moisture from the meat and if 

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:36.569
 the meat comes on the rust forms 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:38.789
 a crust together with protein sugar 

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:41.130
 and it caramelized and this crust 

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:43.859
 makes the loss of moisture more than 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:48.479
 So that's the perfect spirit 

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:52.229
 only perfect the perfect usb salted 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:54.510
 clear before, yes, a little oil is always 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:58.200
 good thing 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:02:00.380
 higher prices make yes I think so 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:05.760
 out 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:07.230
 Peppers like to use coarse-grained salt 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.650
 You always get three people with liquid too 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:11.010
 do 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:14.760
 In our case I always think one with 

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:16.470
 Baywatch costs if you really have 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.940
 one shelves prefer a team made 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.410
 He also told me he is still 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.170
 very strong long a 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:24.030
 We also want to do that like amon grill 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.760
 nice preheated in the local 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:30.240
 temperature and now one earned 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.200
 direct combustion so we have here 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.090
 the station 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.380
 that brings heat that is 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.730
 exactly what we need for the stick 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.400
 There is still a little tip if you can 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:41.130
 strip new booms lids or roast beef 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.470
 there you should first the grease layer 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:47.160
 tackle something then chooses the 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:49.140
 do not grill and we have no 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.620
 trouble with the chrome meat everything 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.620
 stay straight 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:03:00.470
 What does station mean here station 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:04.570
 at this grill for decent power 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.570
 Direct hate 300 degrees plus 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.950
 what does the bar say ? 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:29.350
 the train says to us because in california 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:31.209
 is a must finally for that the two 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:33.819
 words napa valley 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:35.140
 I was there and ask for beautiful wines 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:38.050
 I've learned a little something 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:40.870
 have the trade and are of those 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:42.459
 We actually say we learned as one 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:45.040
 the most important wines there because of that 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:46.540
 also offer not turn actually at 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.239
 but here in the case of gallo 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:51.760
 all the biggest ones would have to be 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:53.230
 wikipedia read what gallo everything 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.520
 is how they developed 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.070
 they were only with a fusel was a 

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:59.700
 high worked but now after 

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:01.330
 there are some in their thirties 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:03.580
 can be seen 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:05.290
 I really wanted that too 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:09.310
 the same time know the one 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:10.690
 mika and helmut brinkmann there as well 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:12.660
 I can do a very deserted find 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:14.640
 Well recommend not so cheap but 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:17.739
 you have to taste something too 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:22.060
 california is also too light 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:24.460
 fish a piaggio in the program of it 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:27.070
 also pretty tasty and ideal for fish 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:28.450
 so long now that you have to do it 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:29.320
 yes they taste carla do you want 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:32.790
 to sacrifice 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:32.790
 I will care if he 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:38.139
 retail from california 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:47.550
 it's a dream it's better to surf 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:49.230
 or at home in this case, the guard post 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:51.150
 at baywatch bay 

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:53.400
 she briefly presents a last wine 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:55.560
 of course, and enjoy 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:57.800
 almost the sunset of the west coast 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.800
 the usa 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:15.710
 love look over that there are new ones 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:18.170
 bauble from California from the 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:20.930
 silicon valley here the thing is, a 

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:22.760
 grill is also a chic that 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:24.050
 this hardware is the hardware itself 

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:26.300
 actually price does not compare with 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:29.390
 a radio thermometer can do the thing 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:31.940
 me an ipad or iphone with bluetooth 

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:34.370
 be connected and you're on 

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:35.060
 the ipad has the complete measurement data of this 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:37.040
 is working 

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:39.020
 you can also data on this display 

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:41.330
 but that is not recommended 

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:43.700
 I think you should do that one 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:44.990
 order function meter but buy with 

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:48.170
 The iPad is fun 

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:50.390
 short of this hardware this device can 

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:52.910
 ten drivers hold our celsius 

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:53.510
 but cool you can add more for now 

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:55.690
 connect 

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:58.550
 who even does space 

00:05:55.690 --> 00:06:00.530
 Temperature sensor with in offer and one 

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:02.630
 Protective cover not everything very cheap 

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:05.870
 but good apple has already got used to it 

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:08.090
 the price categories here at ipad me 

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:09.290
 I'd like to show you the menu here 

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:11.780
 now the measurement data will be smooth 

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:13.070
 displayed 36 degrees is not quite 

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:15.710
 california but we are also in 

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:17.300
 Germany and you can then many 

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:19.070
 Settings personal settings 

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:20.720
 specify one can name the sensor 

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:22.940
 there is no meat on the hook 

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:26.780
 depends so to say you can kaymer 

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:27.950
 set and a graph and you 

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:29.870
 it looks like it's always at the 

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:32.330
 Operation Heartbeat as the temperature 

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:35.960
 it always moves equally well 

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:37.660
 we passed the disadvantage of being grilled 

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:39.110
 it only up to 204 degrees core temperature 

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:41.640
 can measure 

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:43.750
 we had a pity 

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:45.550
 We do not know exactly how 

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:48.130
 but that's the reason why the first one stops for a long time 

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:50.730
 Impression is rewarding and I speak 

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:50.730
 recommendation 

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:54.830
 thank you california
