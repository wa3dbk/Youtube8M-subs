of<00:06:35.339> forty<00:06:35.729> kmpl<00:06:36.149> my<00:06:36.269> friend<00:06:36.539> owns<00:06:36.749> a<00:06:36.929> 350

00:06:37.339 --> 00:06:37.349 
of forty kmpl my friend owns a 350

00:06:37.349 --> 00:06:39.319 
of forty kmpl my friend owns a 350
classic<00:06:37.709> he<00:06:38.129> is<00:06:38.189> getting<00:06:38.489> 40<00:06:38.819> kmpl

classic he is getting 40 kmpl
consistency<00:06:40.229> consistently<00:06:41.189> so<00:06:41.639> that<00:06:41.669> I<00:06:41.849> guess

00:06:42.199 --> 00:06:42.209 
consistency consistently so that I guess

00:06:42.209 --> 00:06:44.419 
consistency consistently so that I guess
is<00:06:42.449> a<00:06:42.479> pretty<00:06:42.839> practical<00:06:43.110> for<00:06:43.559> a<00:06:43.589> bike<00:06:43.799> in<00:06:44.249> this

00:06:44.419 --> 00:06:44.429 
is a pretty practical for a bike in this

00:06:44.429 --> 00:06:45.889 
is a pretty practical for a bike in this
class<00:06:44.669> so<00:06:44.999> that's<00:06:45.119> pretty<00:06:45.449> much<00:06:45.569> it

00:06:45.889 --> 00:06:45.899 
class so that's pretty much it

00:06:45.899 --> 00:06:47.689 
class so that's pretty much it
I<00:06:45.929> this<00:06:46.229> I<00:06:46.619> just<00:06:46.860> hope<00:06:47.009> you<00:06:47.159> found<00:06:47.369> this<00:06:47.519> video
