have to worry about if there's another

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.950 
have to worry about if there's another

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
team in the air of hockey's in here we

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.080 
team in the air of hockey's in here we
don't<00:01:40.140> have<00:01:40.290> to<00:01:40.410> do<00:01:40.560> that<00:01:40.740> so<00:01:41.040> we<00:01:41.610> have<00:01:41.880> the

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
don't have to do that so we have the

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.790 
don't have to do that so we have the
flexibility<00:01:42.780> to<00:01:42.869> be<00:01:42.960> able<00:01:43.050> to<00:01:43.170> work<00:01:43.380> out<00:01:43.590> and

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:43.800 
flexibility to be able to work out and

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.010 
flexibility to be able to work out and
really<00:01:44.130> pinpoint<00:01:44.670> what<00:01:44.790> each<00:01:45.360> position<00:01:45.750> and

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
really pinpoint what each position and

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.780 
really pinpoint what each position and
what<00:01:46.229> each<00:01:46.320> player<00:01:46.590> needs<00:01:46.860> that's<00:01:47.430> the

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
what each player needs that's the

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.330 
what each player needs that's the
biggest<00:01:48.060> treasure<00:01:48.600> of<00:01:48.869> having<00:01:49.320> your<00:01:49.770> own<00:01:50.009> room

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
biggest treasure of having your own room

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.700 
biggest treasure of having your own room
you<00:01:50.550> could<00:01:50.700> spend<00:01:51.060> more<00:01:51.360> quality<00:01:51.690> time<00:01:52.470> with

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
you could spend more quality time with

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.590 
you could spend more quality time with
the<00:01:53.070> players<00:01:53.340> and<00:01:53.640> I<00:01:53.970> think<00:01:54.210> that's<00:01:54.360> really

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
the players and I think that's really

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:07.499 
the players and I think that's really
gonna<00:01:54.720> help<00:01:54.930> us<00:01:55.140> in<00:01:55.259> a<00:01:55.320> long<00:01:55.500> run

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:07.509 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:09.510 

football<00:02:08.200> is<00:02:08.289> so<00:02:08.470> unique<00:02:08.770> because<00:02:08.800> there's

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:09.520 
football is so unique because there's

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:10.949 
football is so unique because there's
people<00:02:09.700> who<00:02:09.940> throw<00:02:10.209> there's<00:02:10.569> people<00:02:10.869> who

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:10.959 
people who throw there's people who

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:12.300 
people who throw there's people who
catch<00:02:11.170> there's<00:02:11.530> people<00:02:11.800> who<00:02:11.860> have<00:02:11.980> to<00:02:12.130> run

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
catch there's people who have to run

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:13.860 
catch there's people who have to run
fast<00:02:12.580> there's<00:02:13.000> people<00:02:13.180> who<00:02:13.360> got<00:02:13.510> to<00:02:13.599> be<00:02:13.660> big

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
fast there's people who got to be big

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.650 
fast there's people who got to be big
and<00:02:13.989> strong<00:02:14.050> so<00:02:14.739> I<00:02:14.770> think<00:02:14.890> it's<00:02:15.340> just<00:02:15.660> trying

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
and strong so I think it's just trying

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.420 
and strong so I think it's just trying
to<00:02:16.780> work<00:02:16.900> all<00:02:17.230> the<00:02:17.470> different<00:02:17.800> dynamics<00:02:18.310> of

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
to work all the different dynamics of

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:19.920 
to work all the different dynamics of
the<00:02:18.520> sport<00:02:18.849> of<00:02:18.940> football<00:02:18.970> is<00:02:19.420> what<00:02:19.599> makes<00:02:19.780> it

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
the sport of football is what makes it

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.570 
the sport of football is what makes it
so<00:02:20.050> much<00:02:20.230> different<00:02:20.709> I<00:02:20.860> mean<00:02:21.280> you<00:02:21.459> know

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
so much different I mean you know

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:22.890 
so much different I mean you know
obviously<00:02:22.000> you<00:02:22.330> know<00:02:22.420> you<00:02:22.480> something

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
obviously you know you something

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.210 
obviously you know you something
everyone's<00:02:23.380> got<00:02:23.500> to<00:02:23.530> get<00:02:23.709> stronger<00:02:23.980> because

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
everyone's got to get stronger because

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.040 
everyone's got to get stronger because
you<00:02:24.430> get<00:02:24.550> faster<00:02:24.940> when<00:02:25.060> you're<00:02:25.180> stronger<00:02:25.420> but

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
you get faster when you're stronger but

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.140 
you get faster when you're stronger but
it's<00:02:26.290> the<00:02:26.440> different<00:02:26.890> dynamics<00:02:27.040> I<00:02:27.670> think<00:02:27.700> in

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
it's the different dynamics I think in

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.630 
it's the different dynamics I think in
the<00:02:28.330> game<00:02:28.540> that<00:02:28.810> make<00:02:29.020> it<00:02:29.200> so<00:02:29.380> different<00:02:29.860> the

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
the game that make it so different the

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.240 
the game that make it so different the
new<00:02:30.790> weight<00:02:31.000> room<00:02:31.209> is<00:02:31.360> part<00:02:31.569> of<00:02:31.720> a<00:02:32.250> 55,000

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
new weight room is part of a 55,000

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.090 
new weight room is part of a 55,000
square<00:02:33.370> foot<00:02:33.760> facility<00:02:34.680> 7,000<00:02:35.680> of<00:02:35.739> which<00:02:35.890> are

square foot facility 7,000 of which are

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.370 
square foot facility 7,000 of which are
right<00:02:36.310> here<00:02:36.370> in<00:02:36.640> this<00:02:37.120> room<00:02:37.450> and<00:02:37.720> all<00:02:38.140> of<00:02:38.290> the

right here in this room and all of the
