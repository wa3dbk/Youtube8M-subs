00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 At home I often ask what I have 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.830
 I like that for programs on my mac 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.900
 or for games and so on, there are in 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.269
 this video now a what's on my 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.160
 mac and in that word for my mac 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.859
 I now all the programs on 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.630
 Show my kids and to every program 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.660
 lose two more words about it 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:24.800
 what I do with it and what use it 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.800
 this program has 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:33.360
 let's start with the first folder 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.940
 I called that apple and here 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:39.030
 you will find this program in there like eg 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.220
 app store itunes so you are here 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.260
 really only the standard programs in it 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:45.629
 I just have them now as 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.540
 single folder still summarized 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.430
 the next folder is called video that 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:52.650
 so all my programs for the net 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.170
 video editing in there or 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:58.080
 for the recording here I have now 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.730
 a final cut pro in it is mine 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:02.070
 video clip program itself 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.619
 use actually for each video of me 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.869
 I can really recommend this for you 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.210
 good at the beginning but also a movie 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.550
 the next program is n break and 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.540
 I do my videos from time to time 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:15.240
 compress 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.399
 if you are too big files because of me 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.960
 not so good a note there tonight 

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:21.390
 Can you make it nice and compact 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.300
 thus compress in the data 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.440
 faster yes, upload the next one up 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.600
 quicktime player 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.550
 I used it very often in the past 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.130
 to make screen shots 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:33.750
 the whole now but currently here with 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.940
 this program what I bought myself 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.940
 have screen flea 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:41.880
 that could be your face com resp 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:45.000
 stop recording the integrated camera 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.190
 then your computer screen sound 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.560
 and now he's just sounding 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:52.500
 A microphone is really that 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.840
 practically because all the tracks are perfect 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.850
 synchronized on top of each other are direct 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.190
 then the next program is called 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.500
 or city I actually use 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:03.990
 for every one of my videos I'm in this one 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.929
 program to record a sound and then 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.099
 in the end only a little 

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:09.990
 reworked the next order for 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:12.000
 the image editing here I have only 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.420

 here is still memory clean 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:24.490

 I did not only say what I did not do at all 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:05:00.490
 because of archive microsoft silverlight so 

00:04:57.699 --> 00:05:02.290

 that's up here I have now 

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:16.090
 for example, the temperature gauge so 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:17.830
 I'm warming my mac right now and that 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:19.780
 In any case, I find it very convenient 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:21.910
 you always have an overview like warm 

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:23.800
 is the mac and there you can also 

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:26.350
 much more about it but set 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:29.080
 I only use this ad then have 

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:30.850
 I still have the vlc player if I am here 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:32.919
 Somehow the file has become in 

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:34.900
 Quicktime does not open then too 

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:37.720
 here the clip body so that can 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:40.300
 things or entire videos from youtube 

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:41.850
 then download the black magic discs 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:44.500
 speed it up so that could 

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:47.139
 speed of your hard drive 

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:48.940
 and then here also two adobe programs 

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:51.039
 I do not know what work anymore 

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:53.740
 I have four now 

00:05:51.039 --> 00:05:57.340
 more apps here for a coffee in 

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:58.960
 is also extremely awesome I must say there 

00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:59.710
 I can also give you a short break here 

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:01.060
 demonstrate 

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:03.760
 there you have one up here 

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:05.770
 coffee mug and if the coffee mug 

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:08.380
 polish is not your mac in that 

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:10.300
 screen already mode if you then 

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:12.639
 then he goes after the 

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:15.130
 specified time in the system simply im 

00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:16.990
 I'm definitely resting 

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:18.550
 practically because the mac does not even work that way 

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:20.530
 out if you want to be 

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:22.780
 the next program is the app cleaner 

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:24.760
 and that would be the time now 

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:27.490
 on it can the old program 

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:30.550
 select and then really looking for it 

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:32.770
 all files out of the system and 

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:34.599
 thus no unnecessary garbage remains 

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:37.090
 your computer if you have a program 

00:06:34.599 --> 00:06:39.460
 wanted to delete thus is everything 

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:42.280
 removed and then I have now 

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:44.169
 two additional browsers to safari 

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:46.539
 I actually only use it from time to time 

00:06:44.169 --> 00:06:49.449
 crooked, for example, for the upload 

00:06:46.539 --> 00:06:52.180
 at youtube and firefox now and then 

00:06:49.449 --> 00:06:54.099
 fill a trifle so have 

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:56.050
 I just just keep it extra 

00:06:54.099 --> 00:06:57.910
 if one does not work 

00:06:56.050 --> 00:07:00.010
 installed that was it already 

00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:01.840
 with the word salmegg here you can 

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:03.260
 Now all the programs see each other 

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:04.760
 my there are 

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:08.420
 Write me again in the 

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:10.880

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:13.190
