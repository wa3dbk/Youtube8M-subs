00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.459
 before installing the components in the 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.859
 steam box 720 you must first 

00:00:05.459 --> 00:00:09.780
 cpu cooler and the mainboard ready 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.460
 first come the two fortifications 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.620
 plates for all the processors in the 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.780
 then they put the heat sink 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.779
 processor carefully in the cpu version 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.369
 and lock them with it 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.900
 processor cooler fits on the board 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.529
 need the two retention modules 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.240
 give way 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.009
 pull the donor from the 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.749
 middle of it spreads about one 

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:29.339
 centimeters up then let yourself go 

00:00:27.749 --> 00:00:30.150
 the two black modules slightly from the 

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:32.099
 solve the board 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.870
 Then they put the RAM 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.879
 in the two dimm slots 1 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.680
 Plug in the two connection cables 

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:41.370
 for the antennas, carefully with a light weight 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.750
 pressure on the wlan card stuck you 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.760
 now the matching screws through the 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.140
 backplate and the mainboard the rubber 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.149
 slices prevent this from happening again 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.949
 do not forget to slip out 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.989
 thermal grease on the boards of the 

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:53.550
 before applying the processor 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.030
 put on cooler and screw 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.030
 attract 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.740
 before you install the mainboard you have to 

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:03.660
 partially disassemble the housing 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:05.040
 remove the middle brace the 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.470
 multi-purpose bracket and the 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.090
 hard disk cage then fix it 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.400
 the hybrid hard drive with four screws 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.900
 in the cage the sata connections must be in 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.360
 pointing direction of the mainboard 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.340
 The housing fan finds in the 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.080
 rear of the two installation positions 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.970
 the right side wall sheltered 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.530
 make sure to install them that way 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.050
 that he can get the air out of the housing 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.800
 blows the screws do not tighten 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:26.790
 firmly on 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.080
 because otherwise the frame can 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.420
 warp and the fan blades 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.500
 grind 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.600
 then wander the plates cage 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.880
 diao blind of the mainboard and the sfx 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.800
 the power supply is the power supply 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.030
 fan has to show up because 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.030
 otherwise he will not get any air 

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:48.390
 in the next step, the antennas come 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.780
 bushings in the aperture of the sports 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.880
 connect sata cable to the atx 24 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.520
 and the atx 12 volt plug the posts 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.259
 plug for the leds usb3 and push button 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.630
 as well as the fan cables outside of the 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.429
 housing with the board for occupancy 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.770
 and position of the connections pull them 

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:06.360
 the mainboard manual to advise afterwards 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.009
 put the board in the housing 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.299
 The easiest way to succeed if the 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.500
 page of the sports with the connections 

00:02:09.299 --> 00:02:12.500
 first dive 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.709
 so that the cable tangles the airflow 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.420
 Do not stow them away 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:19.829
 Excess lines are best 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.260
 between power supply and hard drive cage 

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:24.269
 or injured in the free shafts 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:27.569
 hold the area around the cpu cooler 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:29.040
 free otherwise there is a heat accumulation threatens 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:30.870
 The result is the narrow crossbeam 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.579
 but not on the housing frame 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.159
 the more time bracket the otherwise in cpu 

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:37.379
 fan blocked in the pack of 

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:39.480
 silverstone milow ml 06 is on 

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:40.680
 dust filter with magnetic holder at the 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.109
 under the suction opening of the 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.189
 housing cover slips to the end missing 

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:46.439
 still the wlan antenna 

00:02:44.189 --> 00:02:49.129
 after that you can do this teambox 120 in 

00:02:46.439 --> 00:02:49.129
 take operation
