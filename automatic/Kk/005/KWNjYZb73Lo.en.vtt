00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:31.750
 wants to do for a 4 and then but can 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:34.830
 there you should do it quietly and for 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:38.440
 to prepare the work accordingly 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:41.430

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:47.020
 imagine the dial of one

 clock on the body with the digits 6 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:55.960
 9 12 and 3 and position yours 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:58.360
 finger on the six and move the 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.910

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:05.830
 a concept of touches and exercise 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.380
 what we develop with help 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:11.500
 our coworker kati almost daily 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:13.660
 have applied that has a lot 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.510

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.629

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:20.610
 it drives I could with him one 

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:22.680

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:26.939
 national grand prix exams with 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:28.980
 percentages up to 80 gain space 

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:31.530
 was unrecognizable 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.150
 without the work of intelligence or 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.340
 certainly not possible 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:38.930
 I can therefore recommend it to anyone even 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.930
 to deal with the patches
