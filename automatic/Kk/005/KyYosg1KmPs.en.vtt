00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:38.190 
even cut it to the door you know I might

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:41.540 
even cut it to the door you know I might
just<00:01:38.400> end<00:01:39.080> up<00:01:40.080> bolting<00:01:40.530> it<00:01:40.650> to<00:01:40.770> here<00:01:40.980> and<00:01:41.130> you

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:41.550 
just end up bolting it to here and you

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:43.160 
just end up bolting it to here and you
know<00:01:41.790> reinforcing<00:01:42.450> this<00:01:42.570> so<00:01:42.810> it's<00:01:42.930> a<00:01:43.020> new

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170
