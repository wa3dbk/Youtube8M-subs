00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:09.290 

once<00:00:07.020> again<00:00:07.170> Roger<00:00:07.589> this<00:00:07.980> panel<00:00:08.790> of<00:00:08.910> melamine

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
once again Roger this panel of melamine

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.509 
once again Roger this panel of melamine
is<00:00:09.660> too<00:00:09.870> big<00:00:10.170> and<00:00:10.410> too<00:00:10.440> heavy<00:00:10.800> for<00:00:10.920> us<00:00:11.219> to<00:00:11.340> cut

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
is too big and too heavy for us to cut

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.129 
is too big and too heavy for us to cut
reasonably<00:00:12.030> on<00:00:12.179> the<00:00:12.300> table<00:00:12.660> sauce<00:00:12.870> so<00:00:13.110> I

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
reasonably on the table sauce so I

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.650 
reasonably on the table sauce so I
thought<00:00:13.440> we'd<00:00:13.620> buck<00:00:13.889> it<00:00:14.040> down<00:00:14.280> cutting<00:00:15.240> on<00:00:15.420> top

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
thought we'd buck it down cutting on top

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.960 
thought we'd buck it down cutting on top
of<00:00:15.809> this<00:00:15.870> piece<00:00:16.109> of<00:00:16.289> styrofoam<00:00:16.560> and<00:00:17.130> I<00:00:17.760> thought

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
of this piece of styrofoam and I thought

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.480 
of this piece of styrofoam and I thought
we'd<00:00:18.150> show<00:00:18.390> this<00:00:18.630> method<00:00:19.140> because<00:00:19.560> the

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
we'd show this method because the

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.010 
we'd show this method because the
styrofoam<00:00:20.970> in<00:00:21.090> many<00:00:21.270> case<00:00:21.510> is<00:00:21.660> going<00:00:21.840> to<00:00:21.930> be

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
styrofoam in many case is going to be

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.080 
styrofoam in many case is going to be
easier<00:00:22.350> to<00:00:22.470> use<00:00:22.500> in<00:00:22.859> a<00:00:22.920> set<00:00:23.130> of<00:00:23.250> sawhorses<00:00:23.490> it's

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
easier to use in a set of sawhorses it's

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.009 
easier to use in a set of sawhorses it's
the<00:00:24.150> kind<00:00:24.330> of<00:00:24.359> thing<00:00:24.510> you<00:00:24.570> can<00:00:24.660> just<00:00:24.840> throw

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
the kind of thing you can just throw

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.140 
the kind of thing you can just throw
right<00:00:25.230> on<00:00:25.260> your<00:00:25.470> garage<00:00:25.710> floor<00:00:26.070> and<00:00:26.609> cut<00:00:26.820> on<00:00:27.000> it

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
right on your garage floor and cut on it

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.089 
right on your garage floor and cut on it
well<00:00:27.630> you<00:00:27.689> know<00:00:27.810> not<00:00:28.109> only<00:00:28.140> that<00:00:28.380> there's<00:00:28.920> the

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
well you know not only that there's the

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:30.980 
well you know not only that there's the
fact<00:00:29.369> that<00:00:29.490> wherever<00:00:29.789> you<00:00:30.029> buy<00:00:30.240> any<00:00:30.840> of<00:00:30.900> the

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
fact that wherever you buy any of the

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.170 
fact that wherever you buy any of the
sheet<00:00:31.230> stock<00:00:31.500> they<00:00:31.740> sell<00:00:31.980> the<00:00:32.219> insulation

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
sheet stock they sell the insulation

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.000 
sheet stock they sell the insulation
board<00:00:33.420> in<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:33.660> same<00:00:33.870> sizes<00:00:34.500> so<00:00:34.680> you<00:00:34.710> just

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
board in the same sizes so you just

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.950 
board in the same sizes so you just
throw<00:00:35.250> one<00:00:35.430> of<00:00:35.520> those<00:00:35.670> on<00:00:35.910> when<00:00:36.480> you<00:00:36.570> pick<00:00:36.809> up

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
throw one of those on when you pick up

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.869 
throw one of those on when you pick up
your<00:00:37.079> materials<00:00:37.649> lay<00:00:37.860> that<00:00:38.040> down<00:00:38.219> first<00:00:38.610> and

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
your materials lay that down first and

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.060 
your materials lay that down first and
you<00:00:38.940> can<00:00:39.090> do<00:00:39.180> all<00:00:39.329> your<00:00:39.480> cutting<00:00:39.860> also<00:00:40.860> that

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
you can do all your cutting also that

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.619 
you can do all your cutting also that
styrofoam<00:00:41.430> isn't<00:00:41.940> going<00:00:42.059> to<00:00:42.120> be<00:00:42.180> any<00:00:42.329> problem

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
styrofoam isn't going to be any problem

00:00:42.629 --> 00:01:00.930 
styrofoam isn't going to be any problem
for<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:42.809> blade<00:00:43.050> is<00:00:43.260> it<00:00:43.410> no<00:00:43.739> not<00:00:44.190> at<00:00:44.309> all

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:00.940 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.160 

you<00:01:01.940> know<00:01:02.030> this<00:01:02.240> edge<00:01:02.450> is<00:01:02.630> really<00:01:02.930> terrific

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:03.170 
you know this edge is really terrific

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:05.290 
you know this edge is really terrific
particularly<00:01:04.070> when<00:01:04.190> you<00:01:04.280> consider<00:01:04.309> the

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:05.300 
particularly when you consider the

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.300 
particularly when you consider the
tendency<00:01:05.810> that<00:01:05.840> melamine<00:01:06.410> surface<00:01:06.860> to<00:01:07.010> flake

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.310 
tendency that melamine surface to flake

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:09.850 
tendency that melamine surface to flake
off<00:01:07.550> from<00:01:07.880> the<00:01:08.000> saw<00:01:08.240> cut<00:01:08.540> yeah<00:01:09.140> I<00:01:09.380> think<00:01:09.530> we<00:01:09.740> can

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860 
off from the saw cut yeah I think we can

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:11.200 
off from the saw cut yeah I think we can
even<00:01:10.100> clean<00:01:10.280> it<00:01:10.340> up<00:01:10.550> a<00:01:10.640> little<00:01:10.729> more<00:01:10.970> when<00:01:11.120> to

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
even clean it up a little more when to

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:12.850 
even clean it up a little more when to
go<00:01:11.300> to<00:01:11.360> the<00:01:11.510> table<00:01:11.720> saw<00:01:12.020> well<00:01:12.620> that'll<00:01:12.830> be

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:12.860 
go to the table saw well that'll be

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.340 
go to the table saw well that'll be
perfect<00:01:13.400> in<00:01:13.580> yep<00:01:13.910> well<00:01:14.780> let's<00:01:14.990> cut<00:01:15.200> up<00:01:15.229> that

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.350 
perfect in yep well let's cut up that

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.620 
perfect in yep well let's cut up that
veneer<00:01:15.830> plywood<00:01:16.010> the<00:01:16.460> veneer<00:01:16.729> oak<00:01:16.880> plywood<00:01:17.240> -

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:17.630 
veneer plywood the veneer oak plywood -

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:19.090 
veneer plywood the veneer oak plywood -
and<00:01:17.900> then<00:01:17.990> we<00:01:18.110> can<00:01:18.200> go<00:01:18.320> to<00:01:18.350> the<00:01:18.500> table<00:01:18.800> saw<00:01:18.950> what

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
and then we can go to the table saw what

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.540 
and then we can go to the table saw what
do<00:01:19.160> you<00:01:19.220> say

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:19.550

do you say
great<00:01:20.890> hey<00:01:21.890> John<00:01:22.130> what<00:01:22.370> the<00:01:22.400> heck<00:01:22.580> are<00:01:22.670> these

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:22.790 
great hey John what the heck are these

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:26.020 
great hey John what the heck are these
lines<00:01:23.120> all<00:01:23.330> about<00:01:23.600> on<00:01:23.780> here<00:01:24.580> well<00:01:25.580> you<00:01:25.670> can<00:01:25.820> see

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
lines all about on here well you can see

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.510 
lines all about on here well you can see
that<00:01:26.060> this<00:01:26.360> panel<00:01:26.750> which<00:01:27.110> is<00:01:27.320> a<00:01:27.369> sort<00:01:28.369> of<00:01:28.400> a

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
that this panel which is a sort of a

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.700 
that this panel which is a sort of a
half<00:01:28.759> rounder<00:01:29.270> rotary<00:01:29.660> cut<00:01:30.020> veneer<00:01:30.470> has<00:01:30.500> a

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:30.710 
half rounder rotary cut veneer has a

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.820 
half rounder rotary cut veneer has a
very<00:01:31.040> wild<00:01:31.400> pattern<00:01:32.090> yeah<00:01:32.600> so<00:01:33.170> wild<00:01:33.590> that<00:01:33.650> I'm

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:33.830 
very wild pattern yeah so wild that I'm

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:35.800 
very wild pattern yeah so wild that I'm
afraid<00:01:34.190> unless<00:01:34.520> we<00:01:34.670> take<00:01:34.880> care<00:01:35.119> and<00:01:35.330> matching

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
afraid unless we take care and matching

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:37.840 
afraid unless we take care and matching
it<00:01:35.930> as<00:01:36.110> the<00:01:36.650> various<00:01:36.979> pieces<00:01:37.220> go<00:01:37.610> on<00:01:37.729> the

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
it as the various pieces go on the

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:39.510 
it as the various pieces go on the
cabinet<00:01:38.360> the<00:01:38.540> cabinets<00:01:38.930> going<00:01:39.140> to<00:01:39.229> look<00:01:39.440> cheap

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 
cabinet the cabinets going to look cheap

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.430 
cabinet the cabinets going to look cheap
uh-huh<00:01:40.550> so<00:01:40.790> what<00:01:41.210> I've<00:01:41.360> done<00:01:41.390> is<00:01:41.720> I<00:01:42.170> very

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:42.440 
uh-huh so what I've done is I very

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.950 
uh-huh so what I've done is I very
carefully<00:01:42.770> traced<00:01:43.550> a<00:01:43.820> centerline<00:01:44.270> this<00:01:44.810> is<00:01:44.930> a

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
carefully traced a centerline this is a

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.230 
carefully traced a centerline this is a
matched<00:01:45.350> line<00:01:45.740> and<00:01:46.040> there's<00:01:46.580> another<00:01:46.880> match

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
matched line and there's another match

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.200 
matched line and there's another match
line<00:01:47.630> those<00:01:48.619> will<00:01:48.770> be<00:01:48.860> the<00:01:48.979> center's<00:01:49.430> first<00:01:49.970> of

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 
line those will be the center's first of

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.990 
line those will be the center's first of
the<00:01:50.390> one<00:01:50.600> door<00:01:50.899> and<00:01:51.200> then<00:01:51.860> over<00:01:52.340> here<00:01:52.369> of<00:01:52.820> the

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
the one door and then over here of the

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.559 
the one door and then over here of the
next<00:01:53.450> door<00:01:53.690> and<00:01:54.399> then<00:01:55.399> in<00:01:55.700> this<00:01:55.880> area<00:01:56.270> this

next door and then in this area this

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:59.050 
next door and then in this area this
will<00:01:56.780> be<00:01:56.990> the<00:01:57.140> cabinet<00:01:57.649> side<00:01:58.039> and<00:01:58.460> there<00:01:58.970> will

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
will be the cabinet side and there will

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.389 
will be the cabinet side and there will
be<00:01:59.090> another<00:01:59.240> cabinet<00:01:59.899> side<00:02:00.170> and<00:02:00.530> these<00:02:01.160> will

00:02:01.389 --> 00:02:01.399 
be another cabinet side and these will

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:03.520 
be another cabinet side and these will
reflect<00:02:01.789> one<00:02:02.210> another

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
reflect one another

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.430 
reflect one another
centered<00:02:04.490> around<00:02:04.610> those<00:02:05.000> axes<00:02:05.569> kind<00:02:06.259> of<00:02:06.319> like

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:06.440 
centered around those axes kind of like

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.440 
centered around those axes kind of like
a<00:02:06.470> mirror<00:02:06.800> image<00:02:06.890> of<00:02:07.250> each<00:02:07.399> other<00:02:07.729> exactly<00:02:08.179> I

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
a mirror image of each other exactly I

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.050 
a mirror image of each other exactly I
got<00:02:08.690> it<00:02:08.869> okay<00:02:09.319> well<00:02:10.250> what's<00:02:10.429> this<00:02:10.580> line<00:02:10.819> over

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
got it okay well what's this line over

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:12.640 
got it okay well what's this line over
here<00:02:11.090> about<00:02:11.480> them<00:02:11.750> now<00:02:12.110> there's<00:02:12.350> this<00:02:12.440> too

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
here about them now there's this too

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.199 
here about them now there's this too
narrow<00:02:12.860> to<00:02:13.010> cut<00:02:13.190> a<00:02:13.220> piece<00:02:13.490> of<00:02:13.700> oh<00:02:13.880> absolutely

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:14.209 
narrow to cut a piece of oh absolutely

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:17.440 
narrow to cut a piece of oh absolutely
but<00:02:14.870> this<00:02:15.140> this<00:02:15.380> is<00:02:15.590> a<00:02:15.620> with<00:02:16.520> some<00:02:16.819> extra

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
but this this is a with some extra

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.620 
but this this is a with some extra
margin<00:02:17.690> this<00:02:18.650> is<00:02:18.830> enough<00:02:19.190> area<00:02:19.850> that<00:02:20.510> I<00:02:20.600> can

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
margin this is enough area that I can

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:22.900 
margin this is enough area that I can
cut<00:02:21.020> a<00:02:21.050> door<00:02:21.319> beyond<00:02:21.650> it<00:02:21.830> but<00:02:21.980> it's<00:02:22.100> a<00:02:22.220> parallel

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
cut a door beyond it but it's a parallel

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.559 
cut a door beyond it but it's a parallel
line<00:02:23.240> to<00:02:23.540> those<00:02:23.720> Center<00:02:24.110> lines<00:02:24.640> so<00:02:25.640> that<00:02:25.850> the

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:26.569 
line to those Center lines so that the

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:28.720 
line to those Center lines so that the
original<00:02:27.230> match<00:02:27.560> lines<00:02:27.980> of<00:02:28.190> the<00:02:28.280> veneer<00:02:28.550> are

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
original match lines of the veneer are

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:30.820 
original match lines of the veneer are
not<00:02:28.940> parallel<00:02:29.420> to<00:02:29.600> the<00:02:29.810> edges<00:02:30.050> of<00:02:30.230> the<00:02:30.410> panel

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
not parallel to the edges of the panel

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.000 
not parallel to the edges of the panel
so<00:02:31.370> I'm<00:02:31.520> going<00:02:31.790> to<00:02:31.880> cut<00:02:32.180> this<00:02:32.569> line<00:02:32.959> so<00:02:33.800> that<00:02:33.830> we

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
so I'm going to cut this line so that we

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:35.530 
so I'm going to cut this line so that we
have<00:02:34.220> something<00:02:34.550> to<00:02:34.670> index<00:02:35.060> against<00:02:35.420> the

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
have something to index against the

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.960 
have something to index against the
fence<00:02:35.780> of<00:02:35.959> a<00:02:36.050> table<00:02:36.410> saw<00:02:36.620> okay<00:02:37.160> so<00:02:37.640> this<00:02:37.790> will

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
fence of a table saw okay so this will

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:39.520 
fence of a table saw okay so this will
now<00:02:38.090> become<00:02:38.270> our<00:02:38.540> reference<00:02:38.990> edge<00:02:39.170> then

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
now become our reference edge then

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.620 
now become our reference edge then
exactly<00:02:40.069> all<00:02:40.430> right<00:02:40.580> now<00:02:41.060> we're<00:02:41.300> gonna<00:02:41.390> cross

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630 
exactly all right now we're gonna cross

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.199 
exactly all right now we're gonna cross
cut<00:02:41.959> it<00:02:42.080> first<00:02:42.340> yes<00:02:43.370> because<00:02:43.819> we<00:02:43.940> will<00:02:44.090> need

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209 
cut it first yes because we will need

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:48.400 
cut it first yes because we will need
the<00:02:44.330> smaller<00:02:44.660> piece<00:02:44.990> here<00:02:45.230> easier<00:02:45.950> to<00:02:46.069> handle
