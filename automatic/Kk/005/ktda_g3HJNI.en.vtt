00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:25.769
 coupe where unfortunately no navi 

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:30.199
 is available in europe because of that 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.199
 I am looking for the after market solution 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:37.520

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.780
 a really nice solution 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.890
 Among other things, I want to on the 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.030
 new feature android car actually 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:50.329
 the radio carries one of the 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:54.829
 few radius so far in the market 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:58.049

00:00:54.829 --> 00:01:00.269
 Then choose my son 

00:00:58.049 --> 00:01:04.110

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:08.850
 The pension looks clever come to us

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.430
 on 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:14.840
 that means we are our different ones 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.840
 inputs can choose this 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:20.800
 We always come back to the current 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.660
 switch over to come and the 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.570

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:27.130

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.920
 Here I can switch on my mobile phone 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:34.150
 when 15 is docked because I have the cellphone 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:37.000
 connect to the computer via usb 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:40.780
 then the radio will close 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.580
 automatically activate the bluetooth and 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.500
 then the device automatically complete 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:46.360
 then here too the phone function 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.590
 Benefit if I believe that the 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.200
 changed car then have coupled 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:52.030
 automatically this causes the android 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:56.860

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:25.000
 already installed the android app and 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:26.799
 various other small apps are the same 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.549
 the old ones are compatible 

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:29.549

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:41.540
 The mobile phone will automatically start 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:44.780
 loaded and is immediately recognized as 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:46.190
 android car knows which cell phone 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:50.530

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.530
 point out that nothing is going on here 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:56.570

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:59.080

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:09.410
 Pack away because your view is here now 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:10.540

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:17.120

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:20.840

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:31.510
 our navigation tabs below 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:35.020
 here we have the navigation app on the left 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:35.020
 then we have the 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:40.600
 We have the phone again 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:42.970

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:51.880

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.590

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:09.520

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:16.780
 and the other I have spotfire 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:20.160
 installed or even that is called 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:23.920
 if we're on this path right now 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:27.280
 we can below with the fashion button what 

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:28.720
 they see the whole mirrored again 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:31.930
 so to speak, that the information from the 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:33.160
 google play music app directly to 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:35.320
 car radio also passed 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:38.170
 here you can also see the interpreters and 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:39.970
 the title and yes the album cover 

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:42.990
 which one does not hold the other 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:42.990
 is reached 

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:51.600
 the whole thing here with fashion and lands 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:53.760
 could be fun again 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:58.020
 once we switch to the spotify app us 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:05:03.300
 runs relatively smoothly and if the whole 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:06.240
 speak again here test 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:09.690
 have internet connections and we too 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:13.200
 here music we can do that again 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:16.380
 test as well as the title information 

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:22.080
 from spotify be as author but the 

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:24.590
 club not so lean discover that 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:26.640
 old canada play even more 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:29.580
 Of course you could do that again 

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:31.740
 customize the view you want up here 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:34.130
 one of the options like re-auto app too 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:34.130
 switch 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:43.659
 but nonetheless there are keys 

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:49.030
 Of course, also from the car radio itself 

00:05:43.659 --> 00:05:50.800
 in the android car and then we still have 

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:52.270
 Now you have to change the button again 

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:55.419
 can switch back to the car radio 

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:57.460
 So I got him in the car wheel 

00:05:55.419 --> 00:06:01.270
 This model now has three options 

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:03.789
 to change the android app that stop 

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:08.080
 the mode button I but I find am 

00:06:03.789 --> 00:06:11.469
 the most animated is we always have 

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:17.039
 this home button and we have it here too 

00:06:11.469 --> 00:06:17.039
 again in the fifth classes can 

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:23.620
 that was a lot more 

00:06:21.009 --> 00:06:25.930
 functions we now have here first 

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:30.930
 not as we have the usual here 

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:30.930
 features from google maps 

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:41.410
 of course, up there the only history 

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:44.960
 language input but do not want now 

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:46.670
 then we have the dog off we have 

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:51.380
 again the option language input 

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:53.540
 how will the weather be tomorrow weather 

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:56.020
 bombs in the east 18 degrees and partly 

00:06:53.540 --> 00:07:03.110
 cloudy 

00:06:56.020 --> 00:07:05.560
 it's raining outside just how is the weather 

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:05.560
 current 

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:15.390
 Rostock is 16 degrees when talking 

00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:23.520
 We also stuck here he said in places 

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:24.990
 okay with the current temperature 

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:28.020
 it should have been only once when 

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:29.970
 you have questions like to ask since this 

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:31.890
 week is the android app even 

00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:34.410
 officially in Germany available the 

00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:36.030
 means that can now also on simple 

00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:38.450
 get off the place de downloaded 

00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:38.450
 become 

00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:45.180
 I hope that more will come 

00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:46.830
 that manufacturers are developing their app 

00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:50.640
 adapt their apps accordingly that 

00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:52.350
 which can also be used here then 

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:54.690
 So far, if I have one now, for example 

00:07:52.350 --> 00:07:55.830
 Although whatsapp war after I appeared 

00:07:54.690 --> 00:07:57.210
 I see who wrote to me but 

00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:58.530
 when I push on it happens 

00:07:57.210 --> 00:08:00.600
 absolutely nothing since briefly 

00:07:58.530 --> 00:08:02.100
 the sound is interrupted or the current one 

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:03.480
 music and then nothing happens that means 

00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:05.190
 the message was not full 

00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:07.620
 I do not know if it's because of that 

00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:10.080
 whatsapp itself no support for 

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:11.970
 a car has so far but I guess 

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:12.270
 there is still a lot to come is everything 

00:08:11.970 --> 00:08:15.090
 clear 

00:08:12.270 --> 00:08:17.360
 thanks for coming and then the tournament 

00:08:15.090 --> 00:08:17.360
 made
