consigned to the dumpster long long ago
this<00:02:04.890> is<00:02:05.100> high<00:02:05.670> value<00:02:06.270> computing<00:02:06.840> probably

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
this is high value computing probably

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.740 
this is high value computing probably
value<00:02:07.530> exceeded<00:02:08.340> because<00:02:08.700> i<00:02:08.970> know<00:02:09.270> this<00:02:09.539> would

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
value exceeded because i know this would

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.110 
value exceeded because i know this would
not<00:02:09.899> be<00:02:09.959> a<00:02:10.110> very<00:02:10.410> tenable<00:02:10.890> existence

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
not be a very tenable existence

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.390 
not be a very tenable existence
but<00:02:12.720> I<00:02:12.930> just<00:02:12.959> had<00:02:13.349> to<00:02:13.379> capture<00:02:13.650> some<00:02:13.890> video<00:02:14.190> of

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
but I just had to capture some video of

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.330 
but I just had to capture some video of
this<00:02:14.700> happening<00:02:15.239> because<00:02:15.500> like<00:02:16.500> stereophonic

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
this happening because like stereophonic

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.850 
this happening because like stereophonic
stuff<00:02:17.580> I<00:02:17.760> was<00:02:18.090> extremely<00:02:18.690> surprised<00:02:19.500> that

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
stuff I was extremely surprised that

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.180 
stuff I was extremely surprised that
this<00:02:20.489> was<00:02:20.760> actually<00:02:21.000> working<00:02:21.690> at<00:02:22.200> all<00:02:22.500> yeah

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
this was actually working at all yeah

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.360 
this was actually working at all yeah
check<00:02:23.580> that<00:02:23.849> out<00:02:24.680> oddly<00:02:25.680> enough<00:02:25.980> there's<00:02:26.220> some

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
check that out oddly enough there's some

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.059 
check that out oddly enough there's some
kind<00:02:26.549> of<00:02:26.580> an<00:02:26.700> odd<00:02:26.909> image<00:02:27.360> defect<00:02:27.870> where<00:02:28.799> only

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
kind of an odd image defect where only

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:31.460 
kind of an odd image defect where only
the<00:02:29.280> mid<00:02:30.180> portion<00:02:30.420> of<00:02:30.780> the<00:02:30.900> picture<00:02:31.230> and<00:02:31.349> I<00:02:31.409> do

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
the mid portion of the picture and I do

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.430 
the mid portion of the picture and I do
well<00:02:31.980> now<00:02:32.310> i<00:02:32.340> take<00:02:32.549> that<00:02:32.610> back<00:02:32.790> it's<00:02:33.209> in

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
well now i take that back it's in

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.660 
well now i take that back it's in
widescreen<00:02:34.440> mode<00:02:34.860> right<00:02:35.129> now<00:02:35.190> but<00:02:35.610> it

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
widescreen mode right now but it

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.309 
widescreen mode right now but it
wouldn't<00:02:35.909> really<00:02:36.030> matter<00:02:36.180> if<00:02:36.629> I<00:02:36.750> changed<00:02:37.170> it

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:37.319 
wouldn't really matter if I changed it

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:40.460 
wouldn't really matter if I changed it
back<00:02:37.500> because<00:02:37.909> it<00:02:38.909> was<00:02:39.090> still<00:02:39.390> cutting<00:02:40.049> out<00:02:40.200> a

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
back because it was still cutting out a

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.339 
back because it was still cutting out a
portion<00:02:40.739> of<00:02:41.159> the<00:02:41.519> image<00:02:41.670> not<00:02:42.599> displaying<00:02:43.110> the

indicates<00:02:46.410> for<00:02:46.680> example<00:02:47.040> that's<00:02:47.190> what<00:02:47.370> the

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
indicates for example that's what the

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:50.119 
indicates for example that's what the
