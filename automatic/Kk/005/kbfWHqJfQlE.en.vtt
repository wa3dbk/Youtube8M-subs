with mold casting in the 1700s always
had<00:02:50.360> a<00:02:50.390> an<00:02:51.380> interest<00:02:51.800> in<00:02:51.950> the<00:02:52.040> industrial<00:02:52.519> side

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
had a an interest in the industrial side

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.509 
had a an interest in the industrial side
of<00:02:52.849> things<00:02:53.050> when<00:02:54.050> I<00:02:54.080> went<00:02:54.290> on<00:02:54.769> a<00:02:54.830> visit<00:02:55.010> to<00:02:55.220> the

then<00:02:59.360> became<00:02:59.630> the<00:02:59.690> key<00:02:59.989> the<00:03:00.349> inspiration

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
then became the key the inspiration

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:04.539 
then became the key the inspiration
