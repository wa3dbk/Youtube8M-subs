00:00:38.009 --> 00:00:38.019 
go remember back we basically figured

00:00:38.019 --> 00:00:39.990 
go remember back we basically figured
that<00:00:38.350> there<00:00:38.470> were<00:00:38.589> three<00:00:38.920> main<00:00:39.190> chords<00:00:39.610> or

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:40.000 
that there were three main chords or

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.359 
that there were three main chords or
three<00:00:40.300> main<00:00:40.680> left<00:00:41.680> hand<00:00:41.949> positions<00:00:42.309> that

00:00:42.359 --> 00:00:42.369 
three main left hand positions that

00:00:42.369 --> 00:00:43.350 
three main left hand positions that
we're<00:00:42.519> going<00:00:42.610> to<00:00:42.670> be<00:00:42.760> doing<00:00:43.000> it<00:00:43.089> we're<00:00:43.269> gonna

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:43.360 
we're going to be doing it we're gonna

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:50.640 
we're going to be doing it we're gonna
do<00:00:43.510> AB<00:00:46.979> and<00:00:47.979> C<00:00:48.960> we<00:00:49.960> can<00:00:50.080> do<00:00:50.170> a<00:00:50.199> little<00:00:50.320> jiggy

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:50.650 
do AB and C we can do a little jiggy

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:54.780 
do AB and C we can do a little jiggy
style<00:00:52.199> so<00:00:53.199> it's<00:00:53.739> also<00:00:53.949> gonna<00:00:54.190> be<00:00:54.280> pretty<00:00:54.640> much

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:54.790 
style so it's also gonna be pretty much

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:57.899 
style so it's also gonna be pretty much
three<00:00:55.210> right<00:00:55.629> hand<00:00:55.900> positions<00:00:56.290> as<00:00:56.470> well<00:00:56.739> so<00:00:57.369> if

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:57.909 
three right hand positions as well so if

00:00:57.909 --> 00:01:00.960 
three right hand positions as well so if
you<00:00:58.059> listen<00:00:58.449> back<00:00:58.659> on<00:00:58.960> how<00:00:59.830> Liberace<00:01:00.460> does<00:01:00.790> it

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:00.970 
you listen back on how Liberace does it

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:03.179 
you listen back on how Liberace does it
he<00:01:01.390> basically<00:01:01.809> has<00:01:02.140> a<00:01:02.470> very<00:01:02.710> complicated

00:01:03.179 --> 00:01:03.189 
he basically has a very complicated

00:01:03.189 --> 00:01:05.580 
he basically has a very complicated
melody<00:01:03.850> but<00:01:04.210> if<00:01:04.330> you<00:01:04.420> break<00:01:04.659> it<00:01:04.689> down<00:01:05.379> and

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:05.590 
melody but if you break it down and

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:06.810 
melody but if you break it down and
really<00:01:05.799> kind<00:01:05.950> of<00:01:05.979> take<00:01:06.040> out<00:01:06.280> all<00:01:06.400> that<00:01:06.549> extra

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:06.820 
really kind of take out all that extra

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.090 
really kind of take out all that extra
stuff<00:01:07.000> that<00:01:07.330> you<00:01:07.390> don't<00:01:07.570> really<00:01:07.689> need<00:01:07.960> it<00:01:08.229> ends

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100 
stuff that you don't really need it ends

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:27.709 
stuff that you don't really need it ends
up<00:01:09.189> sounding<00:01:09.400> kind<00:01:09.790> of<00:01:09.909> like<00:01:10.060> this

00:01:27.709 --> 00:01:27.719 

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:31.349 

that's<00:01:28.719> pretty<00:01:29.079> much<00:01:29.289> it<00:01:29.590> so<00:01:29.909> what<00:01:30.909> he<00:01:31.060> really

00:01:31.349 --> 00:01:31.359 
that's pretty much it so what he really

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:32.580 
that's pretty much it so what he really
does<00:01:31.539> he<00:01:31.719> adds<00:01:31.869> a<00:01:32.020> whole<00:01:32.170> bunch<00:01:32.380> of<00:01:32.469> these

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 
does he adds a whole bunch of these

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:34.380 
does he adds a whole bunch of these
extra<00:01:32.890> notes<00:01:33.039> that<00:01:33.159> don't<00:01:33.189> really<00:01:33.640> add<00:01:34.329> to

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:34.390 
extra notes that don't really add to

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.990 
extra notes that don't really add to
anything<00:01:34.990> except<00:01:35.439> make<00:01:35.560> it<00:01:35.679> sound<00:01:35.829> fancier<00:01:36.520> so

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.000 
anything except make it sound fancier so

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.010 
anything except make it sound fancier so
the<00:01:37.119> whole<00:01:37.299> thing<00:01:37.450> together<00:01:37.569> sounds<00:01:37.929> like

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020 
the whole thing together sounds like

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:53.880 
the whole thing together sounds like
this<00:01:51.149> so<00:01:52.149> we're<00:01:52.959> gonna<00:01:53.079> go<00:01:53.259> over<00:01:53.289> some<00:01:53.560> of<00:01:53.829> the

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
this so we're gonna go over some of the

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:55.559 
this so we're gonna go over some of the
basic<00:01:54.250> notes<00:01:54.459> so<00:01:54.610> the<00:01:54.909> first<00:01:55.119> position<00:01:55.329> we're

00:01:55.559 --> 00:01:55.569 
basic notes so the first position we're

00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:57.539 
basic notes so the first position we're
gonna<00:01:55.659> be<00:01:55.869> in<00:01:56.049> is<00:01:56.259> f<00:01:56.770> just<00:01:57.159> like<00:01:57.280> we<00:01:57.369> did<00:01:57.489> with

00:01:57.539 --> 00:01:57.549 
gonna be in is f just like we did with

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:00.929 
gonna be in is f just like we did with
the<00:01:57.670> left<00:01:57.849> hand<00:01:58.000> so<00:01:58.299> for<00:01:58.659> F<00:01:59.310> the<00:02:00.310> main<00:02:00.610> notes

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:00.939 
the left hand so for F the main notes

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:05.389 
the left hand so for F the main notes
are<00:02:01.239> as<00:02:01.450> follows

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:10.650 

so<00:02:06.399> we<00:02:06.459> have<00:02:06.549> G<00:02:06.929> atha<00:02:07.929> E<00:02:08.560> and<00:02:09.310> E<00:02:10.060> flat<00:02:10.239> and

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
so we have G atha E and E flat and

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.809 
so we have G atha E and E flat and
that's<00:02:10.989> kind<00:02:11.230> of<00:02:11.260> the<00:02:11.319> melody<00:02:11.829> but<00:02:12.310> he<00:02:12.459> adds<00:02:12.670> a

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
that's kind of the melody but he adds a

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:18.600 
that's kind of the melody but he adds a
little<00:02:12.940> swoop<00:02:13.360> at<00:02:13.540> the<00:02:13.660> bottom<00:02:17.160> so<00:02:18.160> the<00:02:18.280> slope

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
little swoop at the bottom so the slope

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:25.170 
little swoop at the bottom so the slope
is<00:02:18.849> f-sharp<00:02:19.480> G<00:02:20.290> a<00:02:20.680> flat<00:02:21.269> and<00:02:22.269> a<00:02:23.790> we've<00:02:24.790> got<00:02:24.940> F

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
is f-sharp G a flat and a we've got F

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:36.070 
is f-sharp G a flat and a we've got F
sharp<00:02:25.629> G<00:02:25.690> a<00:02:26.170> flat<00:02:26.350> a<00:02:27.190> G<00:02:28.200> F<00:02:29.579> and<00:02:30.579> E<00:02:30.670> flat

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.840 

you<00:02:37.080> can<00:02:37.230> add<00:02:37.320> is<00:02:37.380> edible<00:02:37.590> pattern<00:02:37.980> now<00:02:38.550> he

a C sharp or D flat with the E and a see

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.010 
a C sharp or D flat with the E and a see
with<00:02:55.620> the<00:02:55.920> E<00:02:56.130> flat<00:02:56.400> so<00:02:57.180> it<00:02:57.270> ends<00:02:57.480> up<00:02:57.540> being<00:02:57.780> very

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020 
with the E flat so it ends up being very

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:08.510 
with the E flat so it ends up being very
slowly<00:02:58.470> like<00:02:58.710> this<00:03:06.290> and<00:03:07.290> that's<00:03:07.440> it<00:03:07.560> she<00:03:08.430> just

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:08.520 
slowly like this and that's it she just

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:13.520 
slowly like this and that's it she just
repeated<00:03:08.640> in<00:03:09.000> this<00:03:09.090> little<00:03:09.300> pattern<00:03:12.380> you<00:03:13.380> can

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
repeated in this little pattern you can

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.110 
repeated in this little pattern you can
also<00:03:13.710> kind<00:03:14.070> of<00:03:14.130> wobble<00:03:14.490> back<00:03:14.610> and<00:03:14.640> forth<00:03:14.850> if

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
also kind of wobble back and forth if

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.280 
also kind of wobble back and forth if
you<00:03:15.210> want<00:03:15.390> it's<00:03:15.570> really<00:03:15.810> up<00:03:15.900> to<00:03:16.080> you<00:03:18.230> so<00:03:19.230> I

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
you want it's really up to you so I

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:20.480 
you want it's really up to you so I
added<00:03:19.470> that<00:03:19.620> little<00:03:19.890> a<00:03:19.950> bit<00:03:20.160> just<00:03:20.280> kind<00:03:20.370> of

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:20.490 
added that little a bit just kind of

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:23.090 
added that little a bit just kind of
wobble<00:03:21.260> makes<00:03:22.260> a<00:03:22.350> little<00:03:22.620> more<00:03:22.710> boogie-woogie

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
wobble makes a little more boogie-woogie

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:31.790 
wobble makes a little more boogie-woogie
ish<00:03:28.010> now<00:03:29.010> let's<00:03:29.550> move<00:03:29.700> on<00:03:29.850> to<00:03:30.230> position<00:03:31.230> to<00:03:31.500> the

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:31.800 
ish now let's move on to position to the

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:38.920 
ish now let's move on to position to the
B<00:03:31.980> flat<00:03:32.190> one<00:03:32.520> here<00:03:32.820> we<00:03:32.880> go

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:38.930 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:41.240 

exactly<00:03:39.930> same<00:03:40.170> pattern<00:03:40.650> all<00:03:40.799> we're<00:03:41.010> doing<00:03:41.189> is

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
exactly same pattern all we're doing is

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.039 
exactly same pattern all we're doing is
changing<00:03:41.549> the<00:03:41.730> notes<00:03:41.909> by<00:03:42.090> just<00:03:42.269> moving<00:03:42.810> it<00:03:42.900> up

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:43.049 
changing the notes by just moving it up

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:47.720 
changing the notes by just moving it up
so<00:03:43.829> the<00:03:44.370> main<00:03:44.610> notes<00:03:44.879> again<00:03:45.420> are<00:03:45.659> C<00:03:46.409> B<00:03:47.159> flat<00:03:47.489> a

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
so the main notes again are C B flat a

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:52.069 
so the main notes again are C B flat a
an<00:03:48.689> A<00:03:49.500> flat<00:03:49.970> but<00:03:50.970> he<00:03:51.090> has<00:03:51.209> the<00:03:51.390> swoop<00:03:51.659> and<00:03:51.840> the

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:52.079 
an A flat but he has the swoop and the

00:03:52.079 --> 00:04:05.360 
an A flat but he has the swoop and the
swoop<00:03:52.290> this<00:03:52.470> time<00:03:52.769> is<00:03:52.980> PE<00:03:53.519> C<00:03:54.390> C<00:03:55.319> sharp<00:03:55.620> and<00:04:04.370> of

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
swoop this time is PE C C sharp and of

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:06.710 
swoop this time is PE C C sharp and of
course<00:04:05.609> he<00:04:05.760> does<00:04:05.879> the<00:04:05.970> exact<00:04:06.269> same<00:04:06.299> thing<00:04:06.540> you

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
course he does the exact same thing you

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.330 
course he does the exact same thing you
did<00:04:06.870> last<00:04:06.900> time<00:04:07.170> and<00:04:07.439> adds<00:04:07.560> a<00:04:07.680> little<00:04:07.890> third<00:04:08.159> in

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 
did last time and adds a little third in

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:10.819 
did last time and adds a little third in
the<00:04:08.430> top<00:04:08.640> the<00:04:09.510> top<00:04:09.720> notes<00:04:10.049> just<00:04:10.379> add<00:04:10.590> a<00:04:10.620> little

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:10.829 
the top the top notes just add a little

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:17.710 
the top the top notes just add a little
flair<00:04:11.280> so<00:04:11.579> you<00:04:11.670> got<00:04:12.500> an<00:04:13.500> A<00:04:14.099> flat<00:04:14.340> with<00:04:14.670> the<00:04:14.790> C<00:04:14.970> a

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:17.720

G<00:04:18.720> with<00:04:19.109> the<00:04:19.320> B<00:04:19.500> flat<00:04:19.680> an<00:04:20.630> F<00:04:21.630> sharp<00:04:21.690> with<00:04:22.620> the<00:04:22.860> a

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.010 
G with the B flat an F sharp with the a

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:29.300 
G with the B flat an F sharp with the a
and<00:04:23.990> an<00:04:24.990> F<00:04:25.229> with<00:04:25.830> the<00:04:25.860> a<00:04:26.010> flat<00:04:26.370> you<00:04:26.550> got<00:04:28.310> pretty

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
and an F with the a flat you got pretty

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.490 
and an F with the a flat you got pretty
cool<00:04:29.550> and<00:04:29.970> again<00:04:30.720> I<00:04:30.750> added<00:04:31.020> a<00:04:31.050> little<00:04:31.199> wobbly

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500 
cool and again I added a little wobbly

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.409 
cool and again I added a little wobbly
cuz<00:04:31.740> I<00:04:31.770> think<00:04:31.860> Liberace<00:04:32.400> does<00:04:32.550> too<00:04:32.760> but<00:04:33.330> that's

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:33.419 
cuz I think Liberace does too but that's

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:42.770 
cuz I think Liberace does too but that's
completely<00:04:33.870> up<00:04:34.020> to<00:04:34.050> you<00:04:34.229> guys<00:04:40.729> that's<00:04:41.729> it<00:04:41.910> now

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:46.050 
to the final position position three the

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:48.710 
to the final position position three the
top<00:04:46.260> notes<00:04:46.560> again<00:04:47.010> are<00:04:47.190> the<00:04:47.580> same<00:04:47.820> just<00:04:48.389> moving

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:48.720 
top notes again are the same just moving

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:59.350 
top notes again are the same just moving
in<00:04:48.810> them<00:04:48.900> up<00:04:50.960> so<00:04:51.960> we've<00:04:52.410> got<00:04:52.560> d<00:04:53.510> c<00:04:54.510> b<00:04:55.520> and<00:04:56.520> b<00:04:56.970> flat

00:04:59.350 --> 00:04:59.360 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.640 

adding<00:05:00.360> the<00:05:00.449> bottom<00:05:00.840> part<00:05:01.080> of<00:05:01.139> the<00:05:01.229> right<00:05:01.409> hand

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:01.650 
adding the bottom part of the right hand

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:04.279 
adding the bottom part of the right hand
is<00:05:01.830> just<00:05:02.400> the<00:05:02.789> same<00:05:02.940> as<00:05:03.060> before<00:05:03.210> so<00:05:03.599> this<00:05:04.080> time

00:05:04.279 --> 00:05:04.289 
is just the same as before so this time

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:14.100 
is just the same as before so this time
the<00:05:04.380> note<00:05:05.330> C<00:05:06.330> sharp<00:05:06.630> D<00:05:07.500> E<00:05:07.860> flat<00:05:08.789> E

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:14.110 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:16.330 

this<00:05:15.110> time<00:05:15.319> I<00:05:15.470> went<00:05:15.680> ahead<00:05:15.770> and<00:05:16.039> added<00:05:16.130> that

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:16.340 
this time I went ahead and added that

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:17.559 
this time I went ahead and added that
third<00:05:16.610> just<00:05:16.850> like<00:05:16.940> we<00:05:17.030> did<00:05:17.150> the<00:05:17.180> last<00:05:17.270> two

00:05:17.559 --> 00:05:17.569 
third just like we did the last two

00:05:17.569 --> 00:05:19.990 
third just like we did the last two
times<00:05:17.810> so<00:05:18.169> the<00:05:18.289> third<00:05:18.500> will<00:05:18.650> be<00:05:18.770> B<00:05:19.400> flat<00:05:19.759> and<00:05:19.880> D

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:20.000 
times so the third will be B flat and D

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.839 
times so the third will be B flat and D
a<00:05:20.500> and<00:05:21.500> C<00:05:21.740> a<00:05:22.419> flat<00:05:23.419> and<00:05:23.660> B<00:05:23.900> and<00:05:24.590> G<00:05:25.520> and<00:05:25.669> B<00:05:25.759> flat

00:05:25.839 --> 00:05:25.849 
a and C a flat and B and G and B flat

00:05:25.849 --> 00:05:32.950 
a and C a flat and B and G and B flat
and<00:05:26.539> so<00:05:26.630> we've<00:05:26.720> got<00:05:31.060> pretty<00:05:32.060> good<00:05:32.300> so<00:05:32.750> let's

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:32.960 
and so we've got pretty good so let's

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:40.659 
and so we've got pretty good so let's
review<00:05:33.580> position<00:05:34.580> one<00:05:38.050> Neph<00:05:39.050> sharp<00:05:39.380> G<00:05:40.099> a<00:05:40.370> flat
