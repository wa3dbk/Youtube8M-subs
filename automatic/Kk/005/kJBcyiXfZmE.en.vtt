00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:09.600
 He should be welcomed by a team 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.930
 deathmatch mp3 gameplay on the map 

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:16.740
 restaurants yes I have here with the 

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:19.080
 style baptized and as killstreaks here 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:22.650
 i had the drone chain burger 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:25.110
 and the low-flying and the perks were 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.450
 faster nimbly or pull 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:30.090
 or dexterity and 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:32.160
 masters shooter so in principle every time 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.949
 I think I was so on 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:39.000
 Pretty much on it to gameplay 

00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:42.450
 I believe sometime in the beginning of August 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.980
 me he plays about five weeks about 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.620
 or I do not have it anymore 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.470
 Consider and the score is not 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.680
 outstanding but he still thinks I am 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:55.410
 All right , it was neither a very 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.780
 good gameplay on the worst one 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.540
 can show but you do not need it yet 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.370
 a lot of beer picture pro always do here 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:05.670
 thumb it should not go today 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:09.509
 but reading the title can be about 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:11.670
 the top 5 of the month so the top 5 

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:12.899
 of the month those of you the 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.429
 not subscribed for a long time 

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:17.249
 2010 or 2011 

00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:19.979
 They know the series on many too 

00:01:17.249 --> 00:01:22.079
 not more unless you see everyone 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.689
 also the older videos on but that does 

00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:26.549
 not everyone always i have the series 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.759
 actually always very happy doing so 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:32.219
 I think I have them between february 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:35.009
 2011 and november made 11 at am 

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:37.020
 at first it was just keys from me and 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.200
 every two weeks after that, too 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.180
 much of others 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.829
 and once a month a break again 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.659
 but the last episodes came 

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:45.490
 actually always relatively regularly 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:47.710
 once a month the likes have 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.909
 tuned the feet were there it always came 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:51.490
 very good 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:52.899
 but now almost certainly well if 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:53.710
 that has everything fit why have you 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:56.560
 would not be done anymore 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:59.020
 many want the yes and terror 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.149
 again and again pms betonbahn made again 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.009
 top 5 of the month I found the series like this 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:04.179
 cool the commented do that 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:06.549
 not anymore 

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:08.410
 I think that's the time before that 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:09.970
 genie offender has started but we 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:12.190
 something is ever going on in the german area 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:14.440
 no one else so what is this top 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.599
 I shot cod have the landlord 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.069
 be criticized but genocide 

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:19.569
 the reason why I do not do that anymore 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:22.120
 It's just that I've done a lot 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:25.810
 So you did not receive enough submissions 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:28.810
 I'm just struggling with the 15 too 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:30.910
 because if i only total eight 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.579
 videos has been sent and a 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:36.160
 it does not come 3 at first 

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:37.870
 look already throw away and the places 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.489
 one two three were pretty good then 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.599
 but places four and five were only 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:43.810
 gap filler wave 

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:44.620
 actually it was okay then 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.049
 nothing special 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.370
 and then I think 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:51.069
 or I thought so well 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:53.590
 yes that's easy you are a few 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:56.049
 months more subscribers may have 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:58.239
 also more clicks meanwhile and let 

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:59.769
 the chance not necessarily submissions 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:01.900
 gets higher too 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:04.389
 and yes now I'm trying mine again 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:07.660
 luck, how many see from now on me 

00:03:04.389 --> 00:03:10.000
 to come up with something so important 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:13.000
 it need not be a cod 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.769
 it can also be battlefield or 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.170
 I do not care about counterstrike 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:19.630
 under which it is to detail it is 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:23.139
 a very small one can be both black ops 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:25.900
 be mp3 as well as mw 1 mb two or too 

00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:29.230
 the very old c2 and c3 parts that is 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:30.760
 I really totally rail main thing 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:32.650
 is a cool action either one 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.630
 cool church or a cool kill fried 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:37.000
 or a multi keel with a grenade 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:39.489
 that's pretty important to me 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.310
 It looks cool the main thing you can do it 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:43.840
 show the people 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:46.480
 and yes, I just ask those 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:49.810
 among you who have a recording device 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.490
 or those who do not have many 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:51.810
 of you 

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:54.330
 yes maybe someone has something like that again 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:55.140
 and you are fine you get regular 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:57.750
 cool action 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:59.520
 then it's not listed 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:02.310
 on youtube, write me a pm 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:03.930
 with the title top 15 months or top 5 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:07.790
 of the month application or I have in the 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:10.440
 top 50 and sent the 1 is the kilgus 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:11.760
 pack i hope i link you 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:14.250
 Of course I have too 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:18.450
 and then everybody is happy 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:20.550
 because I would be happy if not 

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:21.780
 get more submissions because there must 

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:24.330
 I will not bring all the people in again 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:26.490
 cold questions if I anyway and 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:28.650
 20 get 30 consignments per month 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:30.630
 then the thing goes by completely 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:33.750
 alone and say of the twenty 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:35.580
 Thirty can use eight but in 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:37.140
 Of course, the first episode comes only 5 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:38.730
 then I automatically have three 

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:39.770
 more for the next application if 

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:41.790
 he still has five good ones 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:44.760
 then I have to come back 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:46.140
 Plus , it was good that I just 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:48.030
 get enough submissions that it 

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:50.220
 theoretically also for two episodes 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:52.650
 would be enough 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:54.810
 the whole thing by itself and us 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:56.490
 could be made anytime individual 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:05:00.000
 You do not have to wait until again 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:01.560
 A fifth month will come from today on 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.940
 you could see the video for me 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:04.800
 theoretically send that up 

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:06.600
 infinitely tomorrow you can give me the 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.460
 will be leaving next week in three weeks 

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:10.200
 Now the action is on again and you 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:12.990
 can send me something every day 

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:15.750
 as soon as you have something and yes I will 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:17.900
 just once a month the episode 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:20.790
 I think now september 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:23.430
 Either I start at the end of September 

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:25.530
 with or in october depending on 

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:27.000
 how fast i am carrying shipments but 

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:28.350
 I would be happy because many 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.280
 Subscribers meant that was one 

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:33.080
 cool series that continued 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:36.030
 should be 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:37.680
 and those who have uploaded 

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:40.380
 we also what of it because they will 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:42.270
 mentioned and if the when the scene 

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:43.860
 it's really cool then look too 

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:46.590
 repeatedly accuse some people 

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:49.380
 So depending on how special it is 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:51.690
 that so ye also gets his 

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:53.310
 because we are looking at people on the canal 

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:55.470
 when you see that the type for 

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:58.620
 example many videos has then 

00:05:55.470 --> 00:06:01.350
 Subscribe to it and maybe that 

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:03.870
 can not really hurt anyone 

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:08.910
 I would be happy if the series 

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:10.590
 so it would be up to me again 

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:15.890
 yes, I do not have to comment it 

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:19.320
 it's up to you and how many 

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:22.740
 fans with beat with a top 5 video me 

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:27.570
 just war and yes I hope you 

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:29.760
 finds the idea good and helps with it 

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:31.950
 continue the series again 

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:36.600
 and yes that was it from me today 

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:39.210
 gameplay changes from 29 to eight at the same time 

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:40.560
 I think yes the video if it you 

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:43.820
 liked and we listen 

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:43.820
 next time rider shock 

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:11.250
 Yes
