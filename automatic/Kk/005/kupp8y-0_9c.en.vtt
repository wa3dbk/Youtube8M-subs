00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:05.879
 hey people today we show you like you 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.589
 if you could make a semolina cake 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.280
 interested just stay tuned 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:10.280
 have fun 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:19.440
 First, the oven was heated to 180 degrees 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:19.440
 under and above before 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:26.520
 then the protein separated from 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.710
 yolks and goes both in two 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:31.200
 different bowl if you 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.239
 great you have three eggs for 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:36.830
 would have small or medium-sized eggs 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.830
 I recommend to take four pieces 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:47.160
 Now you have to get the egg white stiff 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.550
 beat and then you make the knife 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.550
 sample 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:02.500
 Now he adds the sugar and stirs 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.500
 the whole is watching me 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.840
 Now he gives the semolina and touches 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:18.840
 the whole thing good 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.040
 Now , the protein might still be careful 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:29.040
 under 

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:46.030
 Now you have to vettel the baking dish 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.549
 then you lead the whole into the 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.549
 baking pan 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:04.620
 the whole city ​​now at 180 degrees approx 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.620
 25 minutes in the oven 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:09.100
 as long as the cake is in the oven you have to 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.380
 I heat up 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.670
 add some water to a pot 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.800
 and then the milk pure 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:18.400
 then you have to milk the milk well 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:20.740
 they are cooked as soon as the stir 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.440
 milk cook gives two packets to aline 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:25.450
 Sugar stirs the whole well and 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.860
 There is about the semolina cake in the beginning 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.350
 there will be some milk left on the surface 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:32.340
 The milk will swim with time 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:32.340
 absorbed by cancer 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:44.040
 and so the whole thing looks from finished 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.840
 It really does not look very spectacular 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.490
 but he really tastes very much 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.170
