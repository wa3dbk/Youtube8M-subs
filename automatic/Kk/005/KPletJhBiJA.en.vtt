 difficult on food

 mistakes which certainly explains 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.670
 why there is no true wizard 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:38.820

 the wonderful and the unspeakable horror 

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:54.360
 are the two sides of the same coin and 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.209
 innocence exists only to fly in 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:59.819
 splinters so is forging small souls 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:02.120
 trampled on by reality and by

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:39.520
 steal the see and if moment to kick

 the buttocks you see too michael I confess 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:42.670
 that I was skeptical but embarrassed but 

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:44.260
 that there is progress of small 

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:46.300
 hot croissants on Saturday morning without 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:48.480
 go out of my home I say bravo you are the 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.480
 Queen 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:53.400
 attention this strip is likely to 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:54.960
 contain shocking images that may 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:57.330
 cause nightmare written anxiety 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:59.310
 every day when I get home from work 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.960
 pass in front of the same van all 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:01.950
 the days back from work I do not 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.480
 can not help but cogitate on 

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:05.700
 the foul creatures that decorate with 

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:07.410
 smash the recovery vehicle and all 

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:09.870
 days when I get home from work I 

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:11.910
 say that do the guy who dared to draw 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:13.980
 this kind of foul aura that serves as 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:15.980
 mascot to this respectable artisans do not 

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:18.720
 can not kill him anyway and yet 

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:20.040
 we should do something and 

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:20.940
 every time the impression of a moment a 

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:22.710
 little esoteric 

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:24.180
 I expect at any moment to have sunk 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:24.870
 in horror as in a film of 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:26.430
 David Lynch 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:28.950
 because we want to make a 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:31.080
 mascot ok I understand that we want 

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:32.370
 take for model a shaggy beaver and 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:34.340
 muddy because they pile wood 

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:37.860
 in the stagnant water I still understand 

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:39.120
 fhci the idea certainly a little naive down there 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:40.680
 must still be possible to find 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:43.680
 an acceptable compromise to remove 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:46.020
 cute tanners with a minimum of taste 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:48.750
 even with the inevitable overalls then 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:51.690
 why why mascots that 

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:53.460
 see are systematically why 

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:55.170
 do we always see on the flyers and 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:56.670
 the picket trucks creatures 

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:58.830
 infernal who terrorizes children 

00:05:56.670 --> 00:06:00.660
 it's ready why always a beaver 

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:02.310
 why always in nerdy overalls 

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:06.300
 and why still doing 

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:07.710
 this gesture to the con super the worst is 

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:09.810
 we feel that the person who drew 

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:10.140
 applied what she did with her 

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:11.910
 better 

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:14.430
 so why does not anyone do anything 

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:15.750
 super why are we leaving at liberty the 

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:18.450
 late and who draws these monsters from 

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:21.600
 nightmare gold it makes me tickle 

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:23.220
 really and if it was true if it was 

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:25.500
 always the same guy who decides everything 

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:27.090
 the unhealthy mascots of France if that 

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:30.040
 is they live in my building 

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:31.990
 and suddenly I come to doubt 

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:33.280
 done so after all it's almost a 

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:34.240
 mascot also now that they get 

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:34.810
 found on bags and 

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:36.730
 tee-shirts 

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:39.430
 maybe he's atrociously nerdy 

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:40.990
 him too horribly a spin and that I 

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:43.030
 do not even notice it as the type 

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:45.550
 who draws all these rodents denies no 

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:47.980
 these different facts to north is real 

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:49.300
 before being a mascot one made me 

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:51.490
 while you're not really a mascot 

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:52.840
 you feast of pathé and mascots 

00:06:51.490 --> 00:07:01.530
 do not eat legs and I have not 

00:06:52.840 --> 00:07:06.940
 reason done in north of the country hamburg 

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:13.360
 I equal crazy price the brush not stop at 

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:17.550
 do not frion not extra price shocks 

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:23.350
 super monsters 24 hours a day 

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:24.790
 the cap is really from his movies me 

00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:26.020
 I wonder if I'm the only one 

00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:26.640
 nobody is traumatized by the 

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:29.200
 mascots 

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:33.720
 luckily all this is just a super 

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:33.720
 strip seen on the internet severe
