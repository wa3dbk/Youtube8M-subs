okay we're gonna talk a little bit about
usage<00:00:07.600> of<00:00:07.750> energy<00:00:08.730> not<00:00:09.730> so<00:00:09.910> much

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
usage of energy not so much

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.490 
usage of energy not so much
'<00:00:12.250> how<00:00:12.400> different<00:00:13.389> postures<00:00:13.869> use<00:00:14.139> the<00:00:14.289> same

now and talk about replacing a monkey
we're<00:00:36.940> generally<00:00:37.360> talking<00:00:37.630> about<00:00:38.050> for

we're generally talking about for

treating retreating from someone using a
strike<00:00:43.950> and<00:00:44.950> since<00:00:45.670> then<00:00:45.910> we're<00:00:46.510> here

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.600 

retreating<00:00:52.210> from<00:00:53.200> the<00:00:53.260> strike<00:00:53.739> at<00:00:54.129> the<00:00:54.370> same

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:54.610 
retreating from the strike at the same

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:58.950 
retreating from the strike at the same
time<00:00:55.079> where<00:00:56.079> we're<00:00:56.949> applying<00:00:57.219> a<00:00:57.760> strike<00:00:58.180> to

00:00:58.950 --> 00:00:58.960 
time where we're applying a strike to

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:00.990 
time where we're applying a strike to
them<00:00:59.140> I'm<00:01:00.070> going<00:01:00.250> to<00:01:00.309> turn<00:01:00.489> around<00:01:00.760> this<00:01:00.940> way

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:01.000 
them I'm going to turn around this way

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.079 
them I'm going to turn around this way
so<00:01:01.180> you<00:01:01.480> can<00:01:01.540> see<00:01:01.750> inside<00:01:01.899> what's<00:01:02.470> going<00:01:02.739> on

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:03.089 
so you can see inside what's going on

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:05.609 
so you can see inside what's going on
what's<00:01:04.089> going<00:01:04.150> on<00:01:04.420> here<00:01:04.720> is<00:01:04.930> I'm<00:01:05.140> retreating

00:01:05.609 --> 00:01:05.619 
what's going on here is I'm retreating

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:09.090 
what's going on here is I'm retreating
with<00:01:05.920> the<00:01:06.009> ward<00:01:06.250> off<00:01:06.460> and<00:01:07.450> at<00:01:08.350> the<00:01:08.560> same<00:01:08.770> time

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100 
with the ward off and at the same time

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.020 
with the ward off and at the same time
I'm<00:01:10.030> shifting<00:01:10.840> my<00:01:11.170> weight<00:01:11.200> to<00:01:12.190> the<00:01:12.310> rear<00:01:12.490> and

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:13.030 
I'm shifting my weight to the rear and

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.910 
I'm shifting my weight to the rear and
I'm<00:01:13.450> applying<00:01:13.780> the<00:01:14.020> strike<00:01:14.320> with<00:01:15.100> my<00:01:15.450> that<00:01:16.450> pan

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
I'm applying the strike with my that pan

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.740 
I'm applying the strike with my that pan
which<00:01:17.920> comes<00:01:18.190> out<00:01:18.399> from<00:01:18.700> the<00:01:19.090> turning<00:01:19.450> of<00:01:19.540> my

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:19.750 
which comes out from the turning of my

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.800 
which comes out from the turning of my
waist<00:01:20.050> just<00:01:20.800> try<00:01:20.979> come<00:01:21.220> in<00:01:21.340> the<00:01:21.399> chest<00:01:21.670> area<00:01:21.909> in

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:22.810 
waist just try come in the chest area in

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:26.310 
waist just try come in the chest area in
this<00:01:23.020> case<00:01:23.340> so<00:01:24.340> in<00:01:24.429> this<00:01:24.520> case<00:01:24.759> I'm<00:01:25.390> warding

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:26.320 
this case so in this case I'm warding

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.600 
this case so in this case I'm warding
off<00:01:26.759> as<00:01:27.759> I'm<00:01:28.149> retreating<00:01:28.570> to<00:01:28.840> the<00:01:28.929> rear<00:01:29.110> leg<00:01:29.610> my

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:30.610 
off as I'm retreating to the rear leg my

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:35.130 
off as I'm retreating to the rear leg my
waist<00:01:30.940> turns<00:01:31.979> as<00:01:32.979> a<00:01:33.039> dozen<00:01:33.670> in<00:01:34.390> all<00:01:34.570> movements

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:35.140 
waist turns as a dozen in all movements

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.790 
waist turns as a dozen in all movements
the<00:01:35.830> hand<00:01:36.070> comes<00:01:36.340> out<00:01:36.580> and<00:01:37.289> what<00:01:38.289> happens<00:01:38.679> is

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:38.800 
the hand comes out and what happens is

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.740 
the hand comes out and what happens is
since<00:01:39.009> I'm<00:01:39.250> retreating<00:01:39.820> that<00:01:40.090> forces<00:01:40.509> him<00:01:40.690> to

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750 
since I'm retreating that forces him to

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:44.310 
since I'm retreating that forces him to
extend<00:01:41.470> after<00:01:42.280> me<00:01:42.429> to<00:01:42.610> reach<00:01:42.850> in<00:01:43.060> after<00:01:43.479> me<00:01:43.630> so

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.320 
extend after me to reach in after me so

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.950 
extend after me to reach in after me so
as<00:01:44.500> he's<00:01:44.740> reaching<00:01:45.009> in<00:01:45.369> my<00:01:45.640> hand<00:01:46.509> comes<00:01:46.780> out

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960 
as he's reaching in my hand comes out

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.840 
as he's reaching in my hand comes out
and<00:01:47.229> I<00:01:47.560> extend<00:01:47.920> my<00:01:48.039> shoulder

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 
and I extend my shoulder

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:51.419 
and I extend my shoulder
by<00:01:49.390> using<00:01:49.690> the<00:01:49.899> waist<00:01:50.140> time<00:01:50.470> what<00:01:51.039> that<00:01:51.220> does

00:01:51.419 --> 00:01:51.429 
by using the waist time what that does

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:53.999 
by using the waist time what that does
is<00:01:51.610> meant<00:01:51.850> in<00:01:52.000> my<00:01:52.149> arm<00:01:52.420> so<00:01:53.020> as<00:01:53.259> he's<00:01:53.470> coming<00:01:53.710> in

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:54.009 
is meant in my arm so as he's coming in

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:56.010 
is meant in my arm so as he's coming in
my<00:01:54.220> harm<00:01:54.460> gets<00:01:54.759> minted<00:01:55.179> by<00:01:55.300> way<00:01:55.780> of<00:01:55.810> the

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
my harm gets minted by way of the

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.500 
my harm gets minted by way of the
shoulder

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:58.510 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:21.580 

coming<00:01:59.260> out<00:01:59.550> so<00:02:00.550> again

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:27.110 

so<00:02:22.010> I<00:02:22.340> retreat<00:02:23.030> here

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:33.460 

were<00:02:27.390> actually<00:02:28.049> losing<00:02:28.620> weight

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.240 

right

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.670 

now<00:02:37.250> play<00:02:37.610> arms<00:02:37.940> like<00:02:38.120> baths<00:02:38.390> we<00:02:39.170> use<00:02:39.319> the<00:02:39.440> same

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
now play arms like baths we use the same

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.390 
now play arms like baths we use the same
exact<00:02:40.159> type<00:02:40.489> of<00:02:40.659> type<00:02:41.659> of<00:02:41.810> energy<00:02:42.230> and<00:02:42.709> basic

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
exact type of type of energy and basic

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.729 
exact type of type of energy and basic
mechanics<00:02:43.940> the<00:02:44.360> strategies<00:02:44.900> will<00:02:45.170> never<00:02:45.470> be

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:45.739 
mechanics the strategies will never be

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:48.150 
mechanics the strategies will never be
conquered

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
conquered

00:02:48.160 --> 00:03:14.020 
conquered
as<00:02:48.610> he<00:02:48.820> strikes

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:18.130 

'we<00:03:14.630> still<00:03:14.960> turns<00:03:15.610> and<00:03:16.610> still<00:03:17.270> strikes<00:03:17.660> and

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.140 
'we still turns and still strikes and

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:21.250 
'we still turns and still strikes and
the<00:03:18.380> shorter<00:03:18.830> still<00:03:19.160> gets

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
the shorter still gets

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:31.010 
the shorter still gets
but<00:03:21.830> it<00:03:21.950> gets<00:03:22.099> lengthen<00:03:22.610> by<00:03:23.480> using<00:03:23.720> the<00:03:23.959> waist

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:31.020 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:33.170 

and<00:03:31.380> that's<00:03:31.620> the<00:03:32.130> energy<00:03:32.310> that<00:03:32.520> comes<00:03:32.820> flying

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
and that's the energy that comes flying

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:34.670 
and that's the energy that comes flying
out

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
out

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:58.380 
out
solid<00:03:35.400> base<00:03:35.610> of<00:03:36.569> your<00:03:36.840> stance

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:58.390 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:02.580 

so<00:03:59.390> use<00:03:59.690> the<00:03:59.870> same<00:04:00.140> term<00:04:00.470> that's<00:04:01.220> used<00:04:01.310> to
