00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:37.010 
sorry I really like that the only

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:40.000 
sorry I really like that the only
downfall<00:04:37.250> with<00:04:38.000> this<00:04:38.240> mascara<00:04:39.050> is<00:04:39.200> that<00:04:39.680> the

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:40.010 
downfall with this mascara is that the

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:45.040 
downfall with this mascara is that the
opening<00:04:40.640> is<00:04:41.950> very<00:04:42.950> small<00:04:43.580> it's<00:04:44.539> very<00:04:44.720> narrow

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:45.050 
opening is very small it's very narrow

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:50.560 
opening is very small it's very narrow
and<00:04:46.000> when<00:04:47.000> you<00:04:47.180> put<00:04:48.110> the<00:04:48.229> brush<00:04:48.410> back<00:04:48.710> in<00:04:49.570> you

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:50.570 
and when you put the brush back in you

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:54.719 
and when you put the brush back in you
get<00:04:50.780> a<00:04:50.810> lot<00:04:51.020> of<00:04:51.050> the<00:04:51.229> product<00:04:51.680> on<00:04:51.950> the<00:04:52.820> rim<00:04:53.030> so<00:04:53.930> I

00:04:54.719 --> 00:04:54.729 
get a lot of the product on the rim so I

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:56.770 
get a lot of the product on the rim so I
guess<00:04:55.729> that's<00:04:55.850> kind<00:04:56.090> of<00:04:56.120> wasteful<00:04:56.510> in<00:04:56.600> a<00:04:56.660> way

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:56.780 
guess that's kind of wasteful in a way

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:59.200 
guess that's kind of wasteful in a way
but<00:04:57.650> other<00:04:58.160> than<00:04:58.370> that<00:04:58.460> that's<00:04:58.789> the<00:04:59.060> only

00:04:59.200 --> 00:04:59.210 
but other than that that's the only

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:00.790 
but other than that that's the only
downfall<00:04:59.390> to<00:04:59.750> that<00:04:59.870> product<00:05:00.140> I<00:05:00.380> really<00:05:00.590> liked

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:00.800 
downfall to that product I really liked

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.850 
downfall to that product I really liked
it<00:05:00.950> and<00:05:01.780> what<00:05:02.780> else<00:05:02.930> I<00:05:03.169> think<00:05:03.470> that's<00:05:03.620> all<00:05:03.800> I

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:03.860
