00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.440 
of I think the only one in depth that
actually<00:00:14.549> forms<00:00:14.820> Devastator<00:00:15.269> that's

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
actually forms Devastator that's

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.050 
actually forms Devastator that's
actually<00:00:15.719> in<00:00:15.870> Constructicons<00:00:16.680> green<00:00:17.130> as<00:00:17.550> I

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
actually in Constructicons green as I

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.990 
actually in Constructicons green as I
like<00:00:18.240> to<00:00:18.359> call<00:00:18.390> it

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:20.000

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
assembly and actually you see the

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.119 
assembly and actually you see the
Pistons<00:00:57.149> working<00:00:57.480> under<00:00:57.690> here<00:00:57.870> actually<00:00:58.129> do

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
Pistons working under here actually do

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.150 
Pistons working under here actually do
it<00:00:59.250> like<00:00:59.370> a<00:00:59.399> dump<00:00:59.670> truck<00:00:59.789> hangar<00:01:00.090> and<00:01:01.160> dumps

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160

all the stuff out and then right back
down<00:01:04.170> which<00:01:04.530> i<00:01:04.619> think<00:01:04.680> is<00:01:04.830> pretty<00:01:04.979> cool<00:01:05.100> that

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
down which i think is pretty cool that

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.370 
down which i think is pretty cool that
they<00:01:06.119> gave<00:01:06.299> him<00:01:06.330> that<00:01:06.510> transformation<00:01:07.140> and

them<00:04:08.519> however<00:04:08.670> you'd<00:04:08.879> like<00:04:08.909> you<00:04:09.150> can<00:04:09.269> rotate

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
them however you'd like you can rotate

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:13.039 
them however you'd like you can rotate
them<00:04:09.720> back<00:04:09.989> if<00:04:10.290> you<00:04:10.409> want<00:04:10.790> and<00:04:11.790> kind<00:04:12.000> of<00:04:12.120> if

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:13.049 
them back if you want and kind of if

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:14.180 
them back if you want and kind of if
you've<00:04:13.230> got<00:04:13.349> the<00:04:13.440> arms<00:04:13.680> all<00:04:13.799> the<00:04:13.830> way<00:04:13.890> you<00:04:14.010> can

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
you've got the arms all the way you can

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:16.879 
you've got the arms all the way you can
fold<00:04:14.489> them<00:04:14.640> down<00:04:14.670> like<00:04:15.090> this<00:04:15.440> but<00:04:16.440> this<00:04:16.590> metal

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:16.889 
fold them down like this but this metal

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:19.699 
fold them down like this but this metal
this<00:04:17.070> gray<00:04:17.430> blue<00:04:18.389> bar<00:04:18.690> is<00:04:18.930> not<00:04:19.109> going<00:04:19.440> to<00:04:19.560> go

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709 
this gray blue bar is not going to go

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:23.570 
this gray blue bar is not going to go
anywhere<00:04:20.630> unfortunately<00:04:22.040> I'd<00:04:23.040> love<00:04:23.280> to<00:04:23.400> say

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 
anywhere unfortunately I'd love to say

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.010 
anywhere unfortunately I'd love to say
it<00:04:23.610> wasn't<00:04:23.820> the<00:04:23.940> case<00:04:24.150> I<00:04:24.479> was<00:04:24.570> really<00:04:24.810> looking

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.020 
it wasn't the case I was really looking

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:26.900 
it wasn't the case I was really looking
forward<00:04:25.260> to<00:04:25.410> getting<00:04:26.040> him<00:04:26.310> and<00:04:26.460> showing<00:04:26.669> how

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
forward to getting him and showing how

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:29.120 
forward to getting him and showing how
these<00:04:27.150> folded<00:04:27.630> down<00:04:27.810> but<00:04:28.199> it's<00:04:28.680> just<00:04:28.949> not

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:29.130 
these folded down but it's just not

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:33.350 
these folded down but it's just not
gonna<00:04:29.310> happen<00:04:30.590> but<00:04:31.590> there<00:04:31.740> is<00:04:32.010> in<00:04:32.970> robot<00:04:33.330> mode

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 
gonna happen but there is in robot mode

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:34.939 
gonna happen but there is in robot mode
he<00:04:33.660> also<00:04:33.810> has<00:04:34.080> these<00:04:34.229> panels<00:04:34.680> right<00:04:34.800> here

00:04:34.939 --> 00:04:34.949 
he also has these panels right here

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:36.980 
he also has these panels right here
which<00:04:35.070> you<00:04:35.100> can<00:04:35.280> leave<00:04:35.460> like<00:04:35.669> this<00:04:35.880> or<00:04:36.360> you<00:04:36.870> can

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
which you can leave like this or you can

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:39.680 
which you can leave like this or you can
rotate<00:04:37.199> out<00:04:37.500> to<00:04:37.620> the<00:04:37.740> side<00:04:38.010> like<00:04:38.669> this<00:04:38.699> and<00:04:39.180> if

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:39.690 
rotate out to the side like this and if

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:40.790 
rotate out to the side like this and if
you<00:04:39.780> do<00:04:39.930> that<00:04:40.110> there's<00:04:40.289> a<00:04:40.350> little<00:04:40.560> button

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 
you do that there's a little button

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.610 
you do that there's a little button
right<00:04:40.830> here<00:04:41.690> it's<00:04:42.690> a<00:04:42.750> little<00:04:42.960> button<00:04:43.350> on<00:04:43.470> this

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620 
right here it's a little button on this

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.010 
right here it's a little button on this
thing<00:04:43.680> that<00:04:44.190> pops<00:04:44.970> out<00:04:45.120> a<00:04:45.180> little<00:04:45.389> clear<00:04:45.780> acts

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:46.020 
thing that pops out a little clear acts

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:50.540 
thing that pops out a little clear acts
and<00:04:46.410> it<00:04:47.130> does<00:04:47.310> that<00:04:47.520> on<00:04:47.669> both<00:04:48.060> sides<00:04:48.389> of<00:04:48.660> his<00:04:49.550> of

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.550 
and it does that on both sides of his of

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:53.379 
and it does that on both sides of his of
its<00:04:50.729> robot<00:04:51.090> mode<00:04:51.330> but<00:04:52.139> our<00:04:52.260> both<00:04:52.500> arms<00:04:52.830> I<00:04:52.949> guess

00:04:53.379 --> 00:04:53.389 
its robot mode but our both arms I guess

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:56.060 
its robot mode but our both arms I guess
so<00:04:54.389> you<00:04:54.449> can<00:04:54.630> have<00:04:54.810> a<00:04:54.960> lot<00:04:55.380> of<00:04:55.410> dual<00:04:55.680> wielding

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:56.070 
so you can have a lot of dual wielding

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:57.379 
so you can have a lot of dual wielding
swords<00:04:56.220> and<00:04:56.460> once<00:04:56.580> they're<00:04:56.729> out<00:04:56.850> you<00:04:57.000> can<00:04:57.240> if

00:04:57.379 --> 00:04:57.389 
swords and once they're out you can if

00:04:57.389 --> 00:04:59.240 
swords and once they're out you can if
you<00:04:57.479> want<00:04:57.600> fold<00:04:58.320> these<00:04:58.470> back<00:04:58.680> down<00:04:58.949> so<00:04:59.160> it

00:04:59.240 --> 00:04:59.250 
you want fold these back down so it

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:01.340 
you want fold these back down so it
looks<00:04:59.370> like<00:04:59.490> he's<00:04:59.610> got<00:04:59.729> more<00:05:00.169> you<00:05:01.169> get<00:05:01.289> a

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:01.350 
looks like he's got more you get a

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:02.629 
looks like he's got more you get a
little<00:05:01.530> bit<00:05:01.650> more<00:05:01.830> the<00:05:01.979> broad<00:05:02.220> side<00:05:02.460> of<00:05:02.580> the

00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:02.639 
little bit more the broad side of the

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:03.980 
little bit more the broad side of the
weapons<00:05:02.970> that<00:05:03.120> are<00:05:03.240> just<00:05:03.449> a<00:05:03.570> clear<00:05:03.750> plastic

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:03.990 
weapons that are just a clear plastic

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:07.820 
weapons that are just a clear plastic
which<00:05:04.229> is<00:05:04.350> kind<00:05:04.620> of<00:05:04.650> cool<00:05:06.500> so<00:05:07.500> there<00:05:07.650> is<00:05:07.770> a

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:07.830 
which is kind of cool so there is a

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:10.430 
which is kind of cool so there is a
Voyager<00:05:08.580> Class<00:05:08.610> long<00:05:09.210> haul<00:05:09.449> in<00:05:09.660> robot<00:05:09.990> mode

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:10.440 
Voyager Class long haul in robot mode

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:14.140 
Voyager Class long haul in robot mode
and<00:05:11.220> this<00:05:11.340> real<00:05:11.610> quick<00:05:11.849> ball<00:05:12.440> show<00:05:13.440> yeah<00:05:13.650> I

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:14.150

and this real quick ball show yeah I
mean<00:05:15.150> I<00:05:15.270> know<00:05:15.330> if<00:05:15.539> everyone<00:05:16.320> complain<00:05:16.680> that<00:05:16.710> I

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:20.010 
you're serious side by side with the

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:23.420 
you're serious side by side with the
other<00:05:20.810> Constructicons<00:05:21.840> it<00:05:22.710> does<00:05:22.889> kind<00:05:23.250> of

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:23.430 
other Constructicons it does kind of

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:26.240 
other Constructicons it does kind of
long<00:05:24.180> hauls<00:05:24.389> not<00:05:24.510> really<00:05:24.900> the<00:05:25.680> Voyager<00:05:26.099> long

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:26.250 
long hauls not really the Voyager long

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:29.089 
long hauls not really the Voyager long
hauls<00:05:26.460> not<00:05:26.550> really<00:05:26.970> of<00:05:27.330> a<00:05:27.570> size<00:05:27.810> to<00:05:28.380> to<00:05:28.889> work

00:05:29.089 --> 00:05:29.099 
hauls not really of a size to to work

00:05:29.099 --> 00:05:31.580 
hauls not really of a size to to work
with<00:05:29.130> that<00:05:29.490> kind<00:05:30.240> of<00:05:30.360> impromptu<00:05:30.780> Devastator<00:05:31.470> I

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:31.590 
with that kind of impromptu Devastator I

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:35.930 
with that kind of impromptu Devastator I
showed<00:05:31.889> off<00:05:32.150> in<00:05:33.150> pictures<00:05:33.510> on<00:05:33.690> TFW<00:05:34.139> so<00:05:34.849> if<00:05:35.849> you

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:35.940 
showed off in pictures on TFW so if you

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:38.450 
showed off in pictures on TFW so if you
if<00:05:36.150> you're<00:05:36.240> gonna<00:05:36.360> if<00:05:36.570> you<00:05:36.630> want<00:05:36.780> to<00:05:36.870> make<00:05:37.460> your

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:38.460 
if you're gonna if you want to make your

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:39.740 
if you're gonna if you want to make your
own<00:05:38.610> Devastator<00:05:39.060> you're<00:05:39.240> probably<00:05:39.510> gonna

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:39.750 
own Devastator you're probably gonna

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:41.420 
own Devastator you're probably gonna
have<00:05:39.900> to<00:05:39.960> use<00:05:40.139> the<00:05:40.260> fast<00:05:40.440> action<00:05:40.740> battlers

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:41.430 
have to use the fast action battlers

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:45.080 
have to use the fast action battlers
because<00:05:42.180> he's<00:05:42.780> way<00:05:42.960> too<00:05:42.990> big<00:05:43.669> but<00:05:44.669> the<00:05:44.760> others

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:45.090 
because he's way too big but the others

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:46.219 
because he's way too big but the others
just<00:05:45.330> to<00:05:45.419> get<00:05:45.510> an<00:05:45.599> idea<00:05:45.870> there's<00:05:46.080> all<00:05:46.200> that

00:05:46.219 --> 00:05:46.229 
just to get an idea there's all that

00:05:46.229 --> 00:05:47.750 
just to get an idea there's all that
construction<00:05:46.530> cons<00:05:46.950> that<00:05:47.130> are<00:05:47.250> out<00:05:47.340> so<00:05:47.550> far

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:47.760 
construction cons that are out so far

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:53.839 
construction cons that are out so far
together<00:05:51.200> there<00:05:52.200> you<00:05:52.260> have<00:05:52.410> it<00:05:52.530> a<00:05:52.610> wager<00:05:53.610> class

00:05:53.839 --> 00:05:53.849 
together there you have it a wager class

00:05:53.849 --> 00:05:57.110 
together there you have it a wager class
long<00:05:54.840> haul
