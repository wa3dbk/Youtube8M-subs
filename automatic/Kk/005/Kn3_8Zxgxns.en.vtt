00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 we tie Vilsak something that never 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.370
 played clash of clans 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.529
 soared because I'm not a similar genre 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.570
 I love but then I turned up my arm and 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.820
 jeff fury as clash-of-clans only in 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.500
 3d and it became interesting let's see 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.049
 place apple discounts to all subscribers 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.760
 from partner and apple store just.ru 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.500
 then the developers offered money and 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.090
 became quite well you know quite 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.100
 skeptical attitude to all this 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.650
 just because in jocuri you have 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.080
 three types of resources gold apples mono 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.420
 some spent on the acquisition of units 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.250
 some kind of construction for acceleration and so 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.469
 further very much like in all similar games 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.780
 but in people who do reviews on 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.180
 youtube resource 1 and duck rights very 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.469
 it's just the trust of the audience that is, you 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.930
 can you imagine how much 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.489
 all kinds of clone firms reviews 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.800
 popular toys 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.960
 daily refuse but i never 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.360
 I was a snob and I did not zapadlo look 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.590
 screenshots and if the game interested me 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.050
 try it yourself 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.510
 to make final decisions 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.670
 it's worth my and most importantly your 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.949
 attention or not about here with such 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.229
 thoughts I downloaded and jocuri type ok 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.900
 another clash of clans clone but let's 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.250
 let's see was trained and somehow here 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.630
 suddenly tightened 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.610
 that is, on the one hand everything is enough 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.770
 just but gradually you start 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.360
 dive into this world and no longer 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.939
 pay attention to everything around 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.710
 building a city at first it is scattered 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.960
 all tekhanno tyap-lyap as it is necessary 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.150
 then some strategic and 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.220
 tactical streak you begin to understand 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.320
 what should stand for as much as possible 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.780
 effective defense what units are needed 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.850
 you for an effective attack and so on 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.369
 nor will i say straight as great 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:38.729
 strategy is really not difficult but 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:42.570
 at the same time gives a variable approach to attack 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:44.549
 and the protection of pvp so I did not understand why people 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.740
 love like game real clone always 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.720
 worse than the original with these thoughts I downloaded 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.820
 Klash of Clans try and find out and 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.560
 in general somehow did not like us and those 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.420
 who is long 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.399
 playing with me of course disagree and 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.290
 there is probably a lot of fun at depth 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:59.750
 but so from the schedule all the same 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:02.030
 outdated and jocuri is really very happy 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.549
 your honest camera you 3d picture 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.200
 can and heal three planes 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:08.360
 zoom in delete track and fly over 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.610
 battlefield general like a real kite 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:13.580
 strategist directing his troops 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:15.290
 and here it would seem a trifle but dramatically 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.120
 changes the perception from the game that is how 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.819
 the man who grew up on starcraft and 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.010
 warcraft June z I certainly like 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:24.260
 strategy close wushu strongly inserted but 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:27.049
 for those who are fan of this 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:29.870
 easy genre let's call it so jocuri 

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:32.660
 very decent story about donate 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:35.150
 you know I bought mana for 169 rubles and 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:37.220
 saved the princess and it is obvious that near 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.470
 I have a need for a cup in the future 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:41.420
 no resources are needed all in 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.670
 In principle, the game way is quite 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.560
 realizable the coolest that the game is not 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:48.019
 requires you to spend hours there 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.030
 presence went in for out of 15 minutes played 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:51.739
 came out and so I already played 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:53.780
 a few hours and beyond 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:55.549
 the most interesting is all socialization 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:58.280
 clans so have a desire to continue 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:03:00.739
 summing up the line with my position tus i'm not 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.959
 an expert in this genre seemed to me 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:05.540
 that jocuri 3d is such a clash of clans 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:07.640
 20 probably for those who missed the boom 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.829
 original clash of clans but at the same time 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:12.109
 respect and love this genre in such 

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:12.980
 case, try here definitely not 

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:14.630
 will be disappointed 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.709
