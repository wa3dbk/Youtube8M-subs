00:00:02.119 --> 00:00:02.129 
doing really wants to have some sort of

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:03.290 
doing really wants to have some sort of
detection<00:00:02.429> on<00:00:02.639> the<00:00:02.730> way<00:00:02.820> soon<00:00:03.030> he's<00:00:03.240> gonna

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:03.300 
detection on the way soon he's gonna

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.840 
detection on the way soon he's gonna
have<00:00:03.510> a<00:00:03.570> lot<00:00:03.750> of<00:00:03.780> Tanks<00:00:04.140> out<00:00:04.290> there<00:00:04.500> range<00:00:05.279> and

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850 
have a lot of Tanks out there range and

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.709 
have a lot of Tanks out there range and
almost<00:00:06.359> a<00:00:07.460> range<00:00:08.460> or<00:00:08.940> seizure<00:00:09.330> mode<00:00:09.510> rather

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
almost a range or seizure mode rather

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.580 
almost a range or seizure mode rather
siege<00:00:10.469> mode<00:00:10.679> and<00:00:11.630> mines<00:00:12.630> and<00:00:12.990> such<00:00:13.200> on<00:00:13.410> the<00:00:13.500> way

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
siege mode and mines and such on the way

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.589 
siege mode and mines and such on the way
most<00:00:13.769> likely<00:00:14.280> for<00:00:14.519> mines<00:00:14.910> would<00:00:15.210> really<00:00:15.450> also

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
most likely for mines would really also

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:16.970 
most likely for mines would really also
be<00:00:15.839> a<00:00:15.870> big<00:00:16.049> helping<00:00:16.320> in<00:00:16.470> cities<00:00:16.740> because<00:00:16.920> you

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
be a big helping in cities because you

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:17.990 
be a big helping in cities because you
had<00:00:17.100> some<00:00:17.279> mines<00:00:17.460> in<00:00:17.609> the<00:00:17.640> front<00:00:17.820> it's<00:00:17.910> gonna

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
had some mines in the front it's gonna

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.779 
had some mines in the front it's gonna
do<00:00:18.240> a<00:00:18.270> robotics<00:00:19.160> robotic<00:00:20.160> facility<00:00:20.460> out<00:00:20.580> there

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
do a robotics robotic facility out there

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.759 
do a robotics robotic facility out there
so<00:00:21.480> this<00:00:21.630> is<00:00:21.660> most<00:00:21.990> likely<00:00:22.109> gonna<00:00:22.230> be<00:00:22.410> a<00:00:22.439> dt

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
so this is most likely gonna be a dt

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.349 
so this is most likely gonna be a dt
drop<00:00:23.010> coming<00:00:23.220> in<00:00:23.400> there's<00:00:23.609> just<00:00:23.939> pressing<00:00:24.300> a

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
drop coming in there's just pressing a

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:25.790 
drop coming in there's just pressing a
little<00:00:24.420> bit<00:00:24.630> the<00:00:24.720> front<00:00:24.900> of<00:00:25.019> those<00:00:25.109> goons<00:00:25.380> and

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
little bit the front of those goons and

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.250 
little bit the front of those goons and
unfortunately<00:00:26.430> for<00:00:26.789> see<00:00:26.939> still<00:00:27.240> hasn't<00:00:27.539> get

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
unfortunately for see still hasn't get

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.960 
unfortunately for see still hasn't get
less<00:00:28.439> calendar<00:00:28.830> inside<00:00:29.160> the<00:00:29.279> main<00:00:29.460> pushing

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
less calendar inside the main pushing

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:30.950 
less calendar inside the main pushing
out<00:00:30.090> with<00:00:30.210> nice<00:00:30.359> to<00:00:30.449> be<00:00:30.539> trying<00:00:30.779> to<00:00:30.840> get

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
out with nice to be trying to get

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.030 
out with nice to be trying to get
another<00:00:31.140> scattering<00:00:31.500> but<00:00:31.619> that's<00:00:31.740> gonna<00:00:31.859> get

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
another scattering but that's gonna get

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.950 
another scattering but that's gonna get
blockaded<00:00:32.610> just<00:00:33.450> wondering<00:00:33.719> what<00:00:33.809> this<00:00:33.870> is

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
blockaded just wondering what this is

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.630 
blockaded just wondering what this is
going<00:00:34.050> to<00:00:34.110> give<00:00:34.620> see<00:00:34.800> a<00:00:34.829> sort<00:00:35.040> of<00:00:35.070> idea<00:00:35.340> he's

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
going to give see a sort of idea he's

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.880 
going to give see a sort of idea he's
gonna<00:00:35.820> expand<00:00:36.450> already<00:00:36.870> wow<00:00:37.170> we<00:00:37.559> ready<00:00:37.739> gonna

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
gonna expand already wow we ready gonna

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.500 
gonna expand already wow we ready gonna
plop<00:00:38.190> down<00:00:38.370> another<00:00:38.579> commencer<00:00:38.969> he<00:00:39.210> is<00:00:39.300> I

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
plop down another commencer he is I

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.030 
plop down another commencer he is I
think<00:00:39.989> in<00:00:40.079> a<00:00:40.140> slightly<00:00:40.350> better<00:00:40.440> composition

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
think in a slightly better composition

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.459 
think in a slightly better composition
just<00:00:41.399> because<00:00:41.670> a<00:00:42.210> Terran<00:00:42.930> onto<00:00:43.110> base<00:00:43.260> against

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
just because a Terran onto base against

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:44.990 
just because a Terran onto base against

freeze<00:02:35.660> gonna<00:02:35.840> keep<00:02:35.959> up<00:02:36.080> this<00:02:36.110> DT<00:02:36.440> pressure

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
freeze gonna keep up this DT pressure

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.320 
freeze gonna keep up this DT pressure
don't<00:02:36.830> think<00:02:37.010> he<00:02:37.069> really<00:02:37.280> needs<00:02:37.489> to<00:02:37.730> count

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
don't think he really needs to count

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.630 
don't think he really needs to count
let's<00:02:38.599> take<00:02:38.750> a<00:02:38.870> look<00:02:39.050> cam<00:02:39.319> hamsa<00:02:40.010> stations<00:02:40.489> on

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
let's take a look cam hamsa stations on

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.490 
let's take a look cam hamsa stations on
the<00:02:40.819> way<00:02:41.030> does<00:02:41.660> he<00:02:41.750> actually<00:02:41.870> think<00:02:42.260> he<00:02:42.410> has

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
the way does he actually think he has

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:43.930 
the way does he actually think he has
enough<00:02:42.530> now<00:02:42.920> because<00:02:43.190> the<00:02:43.310> teachers<00:02:43.640> yeah

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
enough now because the teachers yeah

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:45.130 
enough now because the teachers yeah
just<00:02:44.090> being<00:02:44.300> blockade<00:02:44.660> and<00:02:44.780> make<00:02:44.930> sure<00:02:44.959> he's

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
just being blockade and make sure he's

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:46.809 
just being blockade and make sure he's
not<00:02:45.170> getting<00:02:45.470> inside<00:02:45.680> the<00:02:45.769> main<00:02:45.950> mine<00:02:46.280> mine

if I saw my was there am i okay there's
not<00:02:50.510> mine<00:02:50.720> let's<00:02:51.500> go<00:02:51.680> mine<00:02:51.950> in<00:02:52.130> there<00:02:52.340> so<00:02:53.090> that

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
not mine let's go mine in there so that

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.460 
not mine let's go mine in there so that
would<00:02:53.569> have<00:02:53.660> been<00:02:53.720> absolutely<00:02:53.840> horrific
