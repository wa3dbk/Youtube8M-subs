charge<00:01:18.930> as<00:01:19.350> far<00:01:19.590> as<00:01:19.710> battery<00:01:19.979> life<00:01:20.159> is

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
charge as far as battery life is

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.039 
charge as far as battery life is
concerned<00:01:20.729> you're<00:01:20.880> going<00:01:21.000> to<00:01:21.060> get<00:01:21.150> about<00:01:21.390> 75%

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
concerned you're going to get about 75%

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.050 
concerned you're going to get about 75%
per<00:01:22.590> battery<00:01:22.860> so<00:01:23.220> that's<00:01:23.369> actually<00:01:23.580> pretty

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
per battery so that's actually pretty

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.500 
per battery so that's actually pretty
good<00:01:24.270> for<00:01:24.330> charging<00:01:25.080> case<00:01:25.260> like<00:01:25.470> this<00:01:26.330> next<00:01:27.330> up

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:27.510 
good for charging case like this next up

stuff later so let's look at the incipio

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.130 
stuff later so let's look at the incipio
off-grid<00:01:38.549> pro<00:01:38.850> this<00:01:39.119> is<00:01:39.270> a<00:01:39.299> very<00:01:39.659> nice<00:01:39.840> case

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
off-grid pro this is a very nice case

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.660 
off-grid pro this is a very nice case
it's<00:01:40.320> actually<00:01:40.590> one<00:01:40.680> of<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.830> thinner<00:01:41.250> battery

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
it's actually one of the thinner battery

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.210 
it's actually one of the thinner battery
cases<00:01:42.060> that<00:01:42.270> I've<00:01:42.420> used<00:01:42.450> and<00:01:43.049> that's<00:01:43.920> one<00:01:44.130> of

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
cases that I've used and that's one of

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.530 
cases that I've used and that's one of
the<00:01:44.280> reasons<00:01:44.549> why<00:01:44.670> I<00:01:44.700> was<00:01:44.909> attracted<00:01:45.000> to<00:01:45.360> it

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
the reasons why I was attracted to it

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:46.999 
the reasons why I was attracted to it
because<00:01:45.840> it<00:01:46.020> comes<00:01:46.229> with<00:01:46.350> that<00:01:46.439> spare<00:01:46.710> battery

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
because it comes with that spare battery

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.950 
because it comes with that spare battery
but<00:01:47.430> because<00:01:47.759> it's<00:01:47.909> a<00:01:48.000> very<00:01:48.030> thin<00:01:48.570> case<00:01:48.780> it

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
but because it's a very thin case it

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.749 
but because it's a very thin case it
doesn't<00:01:49.200> add<00:01:49.290> too<00:01:49.439> much<00:01:49.560> bulk<00:01:49.860> you<00:01:50.579> see

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
doesn't add too much bulk you see

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.100 
doesn't add too much bulk you see
there's<00:01:50.970> a<00:01:51.030> little<00:01:51.090> tab<00:01:51.390> there<00:01:51.630> to<00:01:51.780> pull<00:01:51.990> the

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
there's a little tab there to pull the

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.840 
there's a little tab there to pull the
case<00:01:52.259> apart<00:01:52.560> because<00:01:52.740> it<00:01:52.979> is<00:01:53.070> a<00:01:53.100> two-part<00:01:53.579> case

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
case apart because it is a two-part case

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.460 
case apart because it is a two-part case
you<00:01:54.060> have<00:01:54.210> the<00:01:54.360> back<00:01:54.540> piece<00:01:54.750> that<00:01:55.020> holds<00:01:55.259> all

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
you have the back piece that holds all

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.440 
you have the back piece that holds all
the<00:01:55.530> battery<00:01:55.890> components<00:01:56.520> and<00:01:56.670> then<00:01:57.240> you<00:01:57.329> also

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
the battery components and then you also

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.690 
the battery components and then you also
have<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:57.840> bumper<00:01:58.170> so<00:01:59.040> take<00:01:59.280> the<00:01:59.399> battery<00:01:59.670> out

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
have the bumper so take the battery out

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:00.950 
have the bumper so take the battery out
it's<00:01:59.939> real<00:02:00.060> simple<00:02:00.240> you<00:02:00.509> just<00:02:00.540> pull<00:02:00.930> up

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
it's real simple you just pull up

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.260 
it's real simple you just pull up
underneath<00:02:01.530> the<00:02:01.680> tab<00:02:01.890> there<00:02:02.130> got<00:02:03.000> the<00:02:03.119> battery

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
underneath the tab there got the battery

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.700 
underneath the tab there got the battery
right<00:02:03.600> there<00:02:03.869> we'll<00:02:04.170> go<00:02:04.290> ahead<00:02:04.350> and<00:02:04.439> plug<00:02:04.649> that

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
right there we'll go ahead and plug that

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.280 
right there we'll go ahead and plug that
back<00:02:04.890> in<00:02:05.340> and<00:02:05.579> let's<00:02:06.479> go<00:02:06.630> ahead<00:02:06.720> and<00:02:06.840> grab<00:02:07.110> the

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
back in and let's go ahead and grab the

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.409 
back in and let's go ahead and grab the
iphone<00:02:07.710> 4s<00:02:08.159> and<00:02:08.519> let's<00:02:08.700> throw<00:02:08.939> it<00:02:09.059> on<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:09.269> case

00:02:09.409 --> 00:02:09.419 
iphone 4s and let's throw it on the case

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:11.360 
iphone 4s and let's throw it on the case
just<00:02:09.689> to<00:02:09.749> see<00:02:09.929> what<00:02:10.079> it<00:02:10.169> looks<00:02:10.319> like<00:02:10.499> now<00:02:10.769> of

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
just to see what it looks like now of

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.890 
just to see what it looks like now of
course<00:02:11.579> i<00:02:11.760> got<00:02:11.909> the<00:02:12.029> white<00:02:12.180> case<00:02:12.419> because<00:02:12.749> i<00:02:12.779> do

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
course i got the white case because i do

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.700 
course i got the white case because i do
have<00:02:12.959> a<00:02:13.139> white<00:02:13.319> phone

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
have a white phone

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.230 
have a white phone
but<00:02:13.830> they<00:02:13.950> do<00:02:14.010> have<00:02:14.280> other<00:02:14.460> colors<00:02:14.760> they<00:02:15.090> have

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
but they do have other colors they have

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.970 
but they do have other colors they have
a<00:02:15.270> black<00:02:15.570> and<00:02:16.080> they<00:02:16.170> also<00:02:16.320> have<00:02:16.530> a<00:02:16.560> gunmetal

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
a black and they also have a gunmetal

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.280 
a black and they also have a gunmetal
color<00:02:17.280> those<00:02:17.940> are<00:02:18.060> both<00:02:18.150> Matt<00:02:18.600> this<00:02:18.960> one<00:02:19.140> is<00:02:19.260> a

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
color those are both Matt this one is a

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.230 
color those are both Matt this one is a
glossy<00:02:19.770> so<00:02:20.340> it<00:02:20.400> just<00:02:20.550> depends<00:02:20.820> on<00:02:20.940> what<00:02:21.090> you'd

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
glossy so it just depends on what you'd
