00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:51.190 
are found on the Xbox controller not the

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:53.850 
are found on the Xbox controller not the
ps3<00:01:51.730> I'm<00:01:51.970> sure<00:01:52.150> the<00:01:52.240> ps3<00:01:52.690> have<00:01:52.930> similar

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:53.860 
ps3 I'm sure the ps3 have similar

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:56.340 
ps3 I'm sure the ps3 have similar
controllers<00:01:54.340> but<00:01:54.460> not<00:01:55.090> exactly<00:01:55.900> called<00:01:56.170> that

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 
controllers but not exactly called that

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.540 
controllers but not exactly called that
on<00:01:56.530> the<00:01:56.770> controller<00:01:57.150> but<00:01:58.980> anyways<00:01:59.980> I<00:02:00.220> got<00:02:00.430> off

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:00.550 
on the controller but anyways I got off

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:04.740 
on the controller but anyways I got off
the<00:02:00.580> ground<00:02:00.820> by<00:02:01.150> pulling<00:02:01.780> the<00:02:02.400> il<00:02:03.450> stick<00:02:04.450> back

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:04.750 
the ground by pulling the il stick back

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:09.630 
the ground by pulling the il stick back
and<00:02:06.420> so<00:02:07.420> it's<00:02:08.410> very<00:02:08.590> easy<00:02:08.740> to<00:02:08.950> get<00:02:09.130> off<00:02:09.250> the<00:02:09.369> air

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
and so it's very easy to get off the air

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.780 
and so it's very easy to get off the air
get<00:02:09.880> started<00:02:10.240> but<00:02:10.420> you<00:02:10.660> had<00:02:10.960> to<00:02:11.050> get<00:02:11.230> um<00:02:11.790> the

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
get started but you had to get um the

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.030 
get started but you had to get um the
hard<00:02:13.000> part<00:02:13.420> about<00:02:13.540> this<00:02:13.750> is<00:02:14.020> getting<00:02:14.530> past<00:02:14.890> the

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
hard part about this is getting past the

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.910 
hard part about this is getting past the
police<00:02:15.190> and<00:02:15.610> not<00:02:16.000> getting<00:02:16.180> shot<00:02:16.480> I<00:02:16.750> your<00:02:17.710> first

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.540 
police and not getting shot I your first
tries<00:02:18.670> will<00:02:19.000> probably<00:02:19.330> fail<00:02:20.080> or<00:02:20.830> not<00:02:20.860> fail<00:02:21.280> but

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
tries will probably fail or not fail but

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.360 
tries will probably fail or not fail but

you know not be so good because the
police<00:02:24.610> will<00:02:24.760> probably<00:02:24.850> shoot<00:02:25.150> you<00:02:25.440> but

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440
