expensive<00:00:57.269> teams<00:00:57.949> because<00:00:58.949> i<00:00:59.190> thought<00:00:59.489> was

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
expensive teams because i thought was

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.910 
expensive teams because i thought was
the<00:00:59.730> best<00:00:59.760> way<00:01:00.149> to<00:01:00.210> test<00:01:00.870> this<00:01:01.050> team<00:01:01.289> come<00:01:01.800> up

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
the best way to test this team come up

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.319 
the best way to test this team come up
against<00:01:02.249> expensive<00:01:02.519> team<00:01:02.820> so<00:01:02.969> i<00:01:02.999> made<00:01:03.210> the

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
against expensive team so i made the

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:04.729 
against expensive team so i made the
bench<00:01:03.539> all<00:01:03.780> informs<00:01:04.199> blah<00:01:04.409> blah<00:01:04.530> blah<00:01:04.559> and

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
bench all informs blah blah blah and

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.370 
bench all informs blah blah blah and
then<00:01:04.830> you<00:01:04.980> find<00:01:05.220> higher<00:01:06.210> rated<00:01:06.540> teams<00:01:06.750> etc<00:01:06.960> and

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
then you find higher rated teams etc and

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.260 
then you find higher rated teams etc and
i<00:01:07.470> think<00:01:07.680> that's<00:01:07.800> the<00:01:07.920> best<00:01:08.070> way<00:01:08.340> to<00:01:08.820> test<00:01:09.060> this

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
i think that's the best way to test this

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.149 
i think that's the best way to test this
team<00:01:09.540> now<00:01:10.020> if<00:01:10.140> we<00:01:10.230> can<00:01:10.350> smash<00:01:10.560> a<00:01:10.620> thousand
