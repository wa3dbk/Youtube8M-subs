00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:39.790 
with it like that you can generally get
it<00:05:38.300> up<00:05:38.449> if<00:05:38.630> you<00:05:38.690> just<00:05:38.810> kind<00:05:39.260> of<00:05:39.380> work<00:05:39.560> on<00:05:39.770> it

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:39.800 
it up if you just kind of work on it

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:42.570 
it up if you just kind of work on it
especially<00:05:40.100> if<00:05:40.520> you<00:05:40.610> have<00:05:40.699> a<00:05:40.729> knife

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:42.580 
especially if you have a knife

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:47.350 
especially if you have a knife
look<00:05:43.580> these<00:05:43.880> ones<00:05:44.150> really<00:05:44.360> stuff<00:05:46.330> you<00:05:47.330> just

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:47.360 
look these ones really stuff you just

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:52.120 
look these ones really stuff you just
put<00:05:47.810> that<00:05:47.840> kind<00:05:48.380> of<00:05:48.500> ugly<00:05:48.680> side<00:05:49.190> now<00:05:49.490> down<00:05:51.130> on

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:52.130 
put that kind of ugly side now down on

00:05:52.130 --> 00:06:00.650 
put that kind of ugly side now down on
the<00:05:52.580> cupcake

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:00.660 

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:10.730 

like<00:06:01.380> that<00:06:02.900> and<00:06:03.900> then<00:06:04.560> take<00:06:05.340> some<00:06:05.370> red<00:06:09.740> and

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:10.740 
like that and then take some red and

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:17.780 
like that and then take some red and
roll<00:06:11.070> it<00:06:11.340> out<00:06:14.810> and<00:06:15.810> it's<00:06:16.050> fast<00:06:16.830> so<00:06:17.550> we're<00:06:17.760> just

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:17.790 
roll it out and it's fast so we're just

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:27.830 
roll it out and it's fast so we're just
cutting<00:06:20.480> two<00:06:21.480> strips<00:06:26.300> since<00:06:27.300> we<00:06:27.450> haven't<00:06:27.690> put

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:27.840 
cutting two strips since we haven't put

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:29.570 
cutting two strips since we haven't put
them<00:06:27.900> together<00:06:28.110> yet<00:06:28.590> we<00:06:28.890> don't<00:06:29.100> know<00:06:29.370> exactly

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:29.580 
them together yet we don't know exactly

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:32.440 
them together yet we don't know exactly
how<00:06:29.940> long<00:06:30.300> we<00:06:30.480> want<00:06:30.690> them<00:06:30.900> so<00:06:31.380> we'll<00:06:31.560> make<00:06:31.740> them

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:32.450 
how long we want them so we'll make them

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:34.910 
how long we want them so we'll make them
longer<00:06:33.450> than<00:06:33.480> we<00:06:33.810> need<00:06:33.840> and<00:06:34.380> then<00:06:34.740> you'll

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:34.920 
longer than we need and then you'll

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:37.700 
longer than we need and then you'll
actually<00:06:35.100> assemble<00:06:35.850> this<00:06:36.000> on<00:06:36.270> the<00:06:36.710> cupcake

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:37.710

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:41.540

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:00.030 

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:04.930 

pretty<00:07:00.660> close<00:07:02.690> and<00:07:03.690> then<00:07:03.900> the<00:07:04.080> smaller<00:07:04.440> mast

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:04.940

or sail here like that and then that's

00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:15.950 
or sail here like that and then that's
how<00:07:12.210> it<00:07:12.240> will<00:07:12.570> actually<00:07:12.690> look<00:07:14.480> once<00:07:15.480> you<00:07:15.630> put
