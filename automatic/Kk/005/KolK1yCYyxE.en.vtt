00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
it's really really weird and my personal

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.430 
it's really really weird and my personal
opinion<00:03:44.670> slight<00:03:45.210> chance<00:03:45.570> that<00:03:45.810> that<00:03:45.930> Tuesday

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
opinion slight chance that that Tuesday

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.220 
opinion slight chance that that Tuesday
night<00:03:46.680> we<00:03:47.550> get<00:03:47.730> the<00:03:47.940> update<00:03:48.420> I<00:03:48.630> can't<00:03:48.960> see<00:03:49.200> a

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230

DLC getting put I don't know Wednesday
that's<00:03:51.630> just<00:03:51.930> so<00:03:52.200> odd<00:03:52.470> for<00:03:52.770> me<00:03:52.890> so<00:03:53.400> maybe<00:03:53.520> they

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
that's just so odd for me so maybe they

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:55.700 
that's just so odd for me so maybe they
showcase<00:03:54.150> tremor<00:03:54.480> a<00:03:54.570> week<00:03:54.900> in<00:03:55.020> advance<00:03:55.140> if
