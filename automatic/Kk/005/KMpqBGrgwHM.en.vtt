actually turned out really well I've got
to<00:00:15.450> get<00:00:15.630> two<00:00:15.900> more<00:00:16.080> LEDs<00:00:16.590> and<00:00:16.619> possibly<00:00:17.250> two

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
to get two more LEDs and possibly two

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.790 
to get two more LEDs and possibly two
more<00:00:17.670> for<00:00:17.910> the<00:00:17.940> front<00:00:18.240> the<00:00:19.170> first<00:00:19.439> thing<00:00:19.650> i<00:00:19.740> did

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
more for the front the first thing i did

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.960 
more for the front the first thing i did
was<00:00:20.160> i<00:00:20.220> installed<00:00:20.880> leds<00:00:21.449> on<00:00:22.460> the<00:00:23.460> floor<00:00:23.730> will

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
was i installed leds on the floor will

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.259 
was i installed leds on the floor will
on<00:00:24.210> the<00:00:24.990> inside<00:00:25.350> and<00:00:25.699> now<00:00:26.699> this<00:00:26.849> gives<00:00:27.090> me

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
on the inside and now this gives me

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:34.430 
on the inside and now this gives me
lighting<00:00:28.730> on<00:00:29.730> both<00:00:30.510> sides<00:00:31.940> which<00:00:32.940> has<00:00:33.780> worked

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
lighting on both sides which has worked

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.380 
lighting on both sides which has worked
out<00:00:34.649> well<00:00:36.380> i'm<00:00:37.380> going<00:00:37.530> to<00:00:37.590> shut<00:00:37.890> my<00:00:38.700> flash<00:00:39.090> off

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
out well i'm going to shut my flash off

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.360 
out well i'm going to shut my flash off
here<00:00:40.640> and<00:00:42.290> then<00:00:43.290> I've<00:00:43.379> also<00:00:43.500> installed<00:00:44.219> the

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
here and then I've also installed the

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.010 
here and then I've also installed the
LEDs<00:00:44.879> in<00:00:45.950> the<00:00:46.950> dome<00:00:47.160> light<00:00:47.489> and<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:48.539> map<00:00:48.750> light

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
LEDs in the dome light and the map light

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.520 
LEDs in the dome light and the map light
as<00:00:49.170> well<00:00:50.449> but<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.600> real<00:00:51.780> thing<00:00:52.050> that<00:00:52.199> was<00:00:52.289> cool

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
as well but the real thing that was cool

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.770 
as well but the real thing that was cool
how<00:00:52.680> it<00:00:52.860> turned<00:00:53.039> out<00:00:53.219> was<00:00:53.629> underneath<00:00:54.629> the

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
how it turned out was underneath the

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.310 
how it turned out was underneath the
Jeep<00:00:54.989> now<00:00:55.260> I've<00:00:56.190> got<00:00:56.460> I<00:00:56.989> think<00:00:57.989> it's<00:00:58.109> called

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
Jeep now I've got I think it's called

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.490 
Jeep now I've got I think it's called

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:03.500 
superflex LED lights I've got two on the

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.609 
superflex LED lights I've got two on the
rear<00:01:04.500> bumper<00:01:04.680> on<00:01:05.460> this<00:01:06.270> side<00:01:06.600> I've<00:01:06.990> got<00:01:07.260> five

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
rear bumper on this side I've got five

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.649 
rear bumper on this side I've got five
I've<00:01:07.920> got<00:01:08.130> two<00:01:08.430> in<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.640> front<00:01:08.820> two<00:01:09.210> in<00:01:09.240> a<00:01:09.420> rear

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
I've got two in the front two in a rear

I've got two in the front two in a rear
and<00:01:09.930> plus<00:01:10.229> i<00:01:10.409> put<00:01:10.619> this<00:01:10.740> blue<00:01:11.040> one<00:01:11.220> kind<00:01:11.460> of

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
and plus i put this blue one kind of

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.280 
and plus i put this blue one kind of
pointing<00:01:11.850> out<00:01:11.970> since<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.450> Jeep<00:01:12.630> is<00:01:12.810> Cosmo

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
pointing out since the Jeep is Cosmo

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:21.560 
pointing out since the Jeep is Cosmo
blue<00:01:14.090> and<00:01:15.090> then<00:01:15.990> on<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.350> other<00:01:16.380> side<00:01:20.570> I've

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
blue and then on the other side I've

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:27.890 
blue and then on the other side I've
only<00:01:21.810> got<00:01:22.049> three<00:01:22.380> right<00:01:22.619> now<00:01:25.939> but<00:01:26.939> even<00:01:27.720> that

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
only got three right now but even that

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.140 
only got three right now but even that
gets<00:01:27.930> enough<00:01:28.439> lighting<00:01:28.829> underneath<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:30.180> Jeep

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:32.150 
gets enough lighting underneath the Jeep

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:34.520 
gets enough lighting underneath the Jeep
now<00:01:33.150> I'm<00:01:33.329> going<00:01:33.450> to<00:01:33.540> try<00:01:33.780> to<00:01:33.810> crawl<00:01:34.200> underneath

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
now I'm going to try to crawl underneath

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:35.780 
now I'm going to try to crawl underneath
the<00:01:34.740> Jeep<00:01:34.950> just<00:01:35.159> kind<00:01:35.369> of<00:01:35.400> give<00:01:35.549> you<00:01:35.610> an<00:01:35.640> idea

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
the Jeep just kind of give you an idea

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.359 
the Jeep just kind of give you an idea
how<00:01:36.090> it<00:01:36.360> was<00:01:36.509> installed<00:01:37.009> um<00:01:38.360> oddly<00:01:39.360> enough<00:01:39.390> I

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:40.369 
how it was installed um oddly enough I

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:47.240 
how it was installed um oddly enough I
was<00:01:41.369> able<00:01:41.549> to<00:01:41.759> use<00:01:42.150> hot<00:01:42.479> glue<00:01:45.829> to<00:01:46.829> mount<00:01:47.070> the

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
was able to use hot glue to mount the

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.460 
was able to use hot glue to mount the
lights<00:01:47.490> up<00:01:50.329> which<00:01:51.329> worked<00:01:51.659> out<00:01:51.840> really<00:01:52.170> well<00:01:52.290> i

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
lights up which worked out really well i

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.889 
lights up which worked out really well i
mean<00:01:52.710> it's<00:01:53.210> it's<00:01:54.210> really<00:01:54.720> honoured<00:01:55.310> securely

00:01:56.889 --> 00:01:56.899 
mean it's it's really honoured securely

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:01.399 
mean it's it's really honoured securely
but<00:01:57.899> with<00:01:58.170> enough<00:01:58.439> force<00:01:59.840> you<00:02:00.840> can<00:02:00.869> easily

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
but with enough force you can easily

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.289 
but with enough force you can easily
take<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:01.770> lights<00:02:01.979> right<00:02:02.219> off<00:02:02.460> and<00:02:02.700> reposition

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
take the lights right off and reposition

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.630 
take the lights right off and reposition
them<00:02:03.420> in<00:02:03.600> a<00:02:04.350> different<00:02:04.710> position<00:02:04.829> if<00:02:05.250> you<00:02:05.280> want

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
them in a different position if you want

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:13.460 
them in a different position if you want
to<00:02:05.850> I<00:02:09.080> even<00:02:10.080> use<00:02:10.500> the<00:02:10.950> hot<00:02:11.160> glue<00:02:11.310> to<00:02:12.290> mount<00:02:13.290> the

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
to I even use the hot glue to mount the

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.880 
to I even use the hot glue to mount the
wire

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
wire

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.620 
wire
to<00:02:14.040> the<00:02:14.160> body<00:02:15.080> and<00:02:16.580> this<00:02:17.580> right<00:02:17.819> here<00:02:17.850> is<00:02:18.180> going

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
to the body and this right here is going

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.500 
to the body and this right here is going
through<00:02:19.500> this<00:02:19.650> crossmember<00:02:19.980> right<00:02:20.430> here<00:02:20.760> to

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
through this crossmember right here to

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:27.920 
through this crossmember right here to
the<00:02:21.630> other<00:02:21.780> side<00:02:23.420> for<00:02:24.420> the<00:02:24.510> other<00:02:24.630> lights<00:02:26.930> so

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
the other side for the other lights so

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.390 
the other side for the other lights so
all<00:02:28.260> in<00:02:28.410> all<00:02:28.500> that<00:02:28.680> worked<00:02:28.860> out<00:02:28.980> really<00:02:29.040> well<00:02:29.250> i

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
all in all that worked out really well i

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.810 
all in all that worked out really well i
got<00:02:29.640> my<00:02:29.760> power<00:02:30.000> source<00:02:30.450> i<00:02:31.610> actually<00:02:32.610> got<00:02:32.700> my

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
got my power source i actually got my

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.600 
got my power source i actually got my
power<00:02:33.000> source<00:02:33.390> from<00:02:33.660> the<00:02:33.810> cluster<00:02:34.550> behind<00:02:35.550> the

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
power source from the cluster behind the

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:43.970 
power source from the cluster behind the
gauge<00:02:35.820> cluster<00:02:36.440> but<00:02:40.670> right<00:02:41.670> here<00:02:42.560> I'm<00:02:43.560> getting
