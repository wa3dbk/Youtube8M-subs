00:00:00.259 --> 00:00:07.680

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:15.289
 man who or tuning out 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:18.419
 I know that hair is false eyes 

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:21.240
 cars and mobiles probably i'm in them 

00:00:18.419 --> 00:00:23.519
 I do not understand well, with pleasure on this 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.849
 beast ride an older dragon 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:29.640
 dragons are like giant ribs like 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:33.800
 gaming ribs here agree i can yes 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.800
 of course my goodness 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:49.629
 the first thing we do in the car and there 

00:00:41.179 --> 00:00:49.629
 and will come? 

00:00:50.359 --> 00:00:59.329
 And so you know where to start, what to start. 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.280
 let's talk about travel and water 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:03.890
 and the fact is that really 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:07.399
 car and fashion have always gone together 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:09.470
 just beat there were only 110 years 

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:12.409
 back and fashion of course very much 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:15.619
 responded but in the past of course it 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:17.929
 was solely the lot of men men 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:20.450
 then they were called chauffeurs 

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:22.159
 if you remember from history that first 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:25.100
 car that even went 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:29.149
 aspirations had no top toaster he was 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:32.090
 open type sled on wheels and these 

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:35.569
 open stamps required special 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:38.750
 clothes so fashionable entered the male wolf 

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:41.450
 the teeth and the first motorists got behind the wheel 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:44.570
 in wolf noise our plastic is single 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:47.180
 it is in 1920 when it passed 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:49.670
 situation women not only got behind the wheel 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:53.390
 car to have changed their head 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:55.789
 headwear while the roof was high in 20 water 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:58.880
 hats were higher for then gradually 

00:01:55.789 --> 00:02:00.619
 they just completely disappeared and the hats came off 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.789
 yes no precisely because of the car 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:05.000
 car killed 

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:08.270
 women's hat because and of course 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.710
 dressed women in Lyublino 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:11.580
 of 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:14.310
 given 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:17.910
 cases of cars I had very 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.690
 many funny funny ones once them 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.410
 thank God 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:26.180
 the only thing that I have not experienced 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:30.360
 I was in a small accident only once 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:34.590
 in my whole life and just back on 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:36.600
 ice in Iceland crashed into us 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:39.300
 the car a little bit there 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:42.440
 the headlamp broke nothing special but if 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:45.000
 turned the neck of shock although he was tied and 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:48.270
 since then i know what if i am near 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:52.640
 cars from always keep your head like 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:52.640
 can be closer to this pillow hare 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:03:01.209
 Alexander but the smell in the car at all 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:03.370
 Yes, of course, I will return the Christmas trees, but in principle I 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:05.950
 I think that if a person uses 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.569
 perfume from the very cars already smell 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:10.480
 I think that in general in the car should 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:13.480
 smell good just eat very cheap 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:15.489
 smells all sorts of Christmas trees cherries 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:18.040
 you can buy it at the gas station myself 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:20.680
 the driver always buy a house 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.540
 I try to go all the same different 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.939
 gamma prices because you can buy more expensive 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:27.730
 truth may be cheaper depends on 

00:03:24.939 --> 00:03:29.799
 of your money but if it smells bad 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.930
 terrible and where do you like best 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:35.079
 driving all the same in paris or in moscow 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:37.150
 no i like it in empty cities if 

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:39.790
 honestly, I think that in this sense 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:42.040
 ideal Vilnius where very little 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:44.079
 cars where there are no traffic jams pistol 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.159
 such an ideal city because there still 

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:47.739
 small population 

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:48.250
 that's what i want to draw yours and 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:50.590
 like 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:55.030
 something that absolutely shocks me in moscow 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:58.379
 these are traffic jams that even exist at night 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:04:02.799
 and I perfectly understand that we must 

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:04.510
 play by the rules that gives us 

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:08.620
 here is the reality so I'm in the car 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:12.010
 always computer i always music i think 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:14.590
 about the future i make plans i chat on 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:16.720
 phone so by car I 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:20.670
 a little 2 tons 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.670
 on nsk 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.940
 only on the media we did not have a car 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:32.210
 which is not in your heart, I bought 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:34.819
 and caused no need to worry and drove no 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:39.259
 well old yes beautiful i look at them 

00:04:34.819 --> 00:04:41.150
 I look at them at all I am aesthetically pleasing to me 

00:04:39.259 --> 00:04:43.190
 really liked at the time the car 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.550
 victory turned out to be so streamlined 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:45.770
 the form 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:49.310
 then I really liked volkswagen 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:52.069
 somehow like a rounded orbit 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:53.960
 which since I seem both new and 

00:04:52.069 --> 00:04:56.180
 old old still limit me too 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:59.150
 I like even one time 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:01.879
 inclined my driver to put a new one 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:05.060
 motor in victory he will say impossible 

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:07.009
 strain is nothing to do before 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:08.960
 tune it in order to ride but 

00:05:07.009 --> 00:05:11.270
 he cheats you actually can go there 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:13.490
 put in 8 truth is Moscow 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:15.289
 instances in which stands at 8 but just 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:17.389
 from the car turns it just 

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:18.800
 like a toy and that's just me 

00:05:17.389 --> 00:05:20.569
 like this toy 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:23.169
 i like your gloves rubbing 

00:05:20.569 --> 00:05:23.169
 the car 

00:05:40.569 --> 00:05:46.389
 what color do you like yes yes i am in the world 

00:05:43.869 --> 00:05:48.539

00:05:48.539 --> 00:05:55.319
