00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
in it which I don't think you'll be able

to<00:00:51.780> see<00:00:52.879> and<00:00:53.879> they<00:00:54.870> cling<00:00:55.260> to<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.469> lashes<00:00:55.949> when

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
to see and they cling to the lashes when

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.459 
to see and they cling to the lashes when
you<00:00:56.219> apply<00:00:56.550> it<00:00:56.610> and<00:00:57.090> really<00:00:57.390> build<00:00:57.690> up<00:00:57.960> your

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
you apply it and really build up your

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.830 
you apply it and really build up your
look<00:00:58.739> and<00:00:59.100> it<00:01:00.090> doesn't<00:01:00.420> say<00:01:00.570> that<00:01:00.690> on<00:01:00.750> the

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
look and it doesn't say that on the

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.180 
look and it doesn't say that on the
packaging<00:01:01.289> which<00:01:01.410> is<00:01:01.440> a<00:01:01.620> shame<00:01:01.859> because<00:01:01.920> I

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
packaging which is a shame because I

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.740 
packaging which is a shame because I
think<00:01:02.309> some<00:01:02.699> people<00:01:02.850> would<00:01:03.030> probably<00:01:03.329> like<00:01:03.719> to

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
think some people would probably like to

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.950 
think some people would probably like to
know<00:01:04.049> that<00:01:04.290> and<00:01:04.500> I<00:01:05.220> guess<00:01:05.610> some<00:01:05.850> people<00:01:06.270> that

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
know that and I guess some people that

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.780 
know that and I guess some people that
might<00:01:07.260> wear<00:01:07.409> contact<00:01:07.740> lenses<00:01:07.979> for<00:01:08.159> example

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
might wear contact lenses for example

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.359 
might wear contact lenses for example
could<00:01:09.630> have<00:01:09.900> sensitivity<00:01:10.530> to<00:01:10.560> it<00:01:10.830> I've<00:01:11.040> never

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
could have sensitivity to it I've never

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.219 
could have sensitivity to it I've never
experienced<00:01:12.210> that<00:01:12.360> and<00:01:12.540> I<00:01:12.630> wear<00:01:12.810> contact

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
experienced that and I wear contact

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.810 
experienced that and I wear contact
lenses<00:01:13.530> but<00:01:13.590> everybody<00:01:14.130> is<00:01:14.250> different

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
lenses but everybody is different

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.310 
lenses but everybody is different
so<00:01:15.270> things<00:01:15.750> are<00:01:15.840> going<00:01:15.990> to<00:01:16.049> get<00:01:16.110> a<00:01:16.170> little

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.010 
really easy to get right down into the
base<00:01:50.100> of<00:01:50.130> your<00:01:50.399> lashes<00:01:50.700> although<00:01:51.509> sometimes<00:01:51.750> I

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
base of your lashes although sometimes I

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.840 
base of your lashes although sometimes I
do<00:01:52.079> find<00:01:52.470> that<00:01:52.560> it<00:01:52.710> clumps<00:01:53.130> a<00:01:53.220> little<00:01:53.490> bit<00:01:53.670> when

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
do find that it clumps a little bit when

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.190 
do find that it clumps a little bit when
you<00:01:53.970> take<00:01:54.210> it<00:01:54.360> out<00:01:54.509> of<00:01:54.540> the<00:01:54.689> tube<00:01:54.930> so<00:01:55.110> you

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
you take it out of the tube so you

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.289 
you take it out of the tube so you
really<00:01:55.439> need<00:01:55.530> to<00:01:55.590> wipe<00:01:56.490> that<00:01:56.520> off<00:01:56.969> a<00:01:57.060> little

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
really need to wipe that off a little

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:04.249 
really need to wipe that off a little
bit<00:01:59.090> okay<00:02:01.969> this<00:02:02.969> is<00:02:03.090> ridiculously<00:02:03.780> hard<00:02:03.990> in

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
bit okay this is ridiculously hard in

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:22.680 
bit okay this is ridiculously hard in
the<00:02:04.380> mirror<00:02:04.619> which<00:02:04.799> is<00:02:04.829> by<00:02:05.130> my<00:02:05.280> camera

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.140 

you<00:02:23.290> can<00:02:23.500> see<00:02:23.740> that<00:02:23.890> it's<00:02:24.070> not<00:02:24.250> clumping<00:02:24.910> which

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
you can see that it's not clumping which

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.150 
you can see that it's not clumping which
I<00:02:25.330> was<00:02:25.510> the<00:02:25.900> first<00:02:26.290> time<00:02:26.470> I<00:02:26.530> tried<00:02:26.770> this<00:02:26.800> Lowe's

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
I was the first time I tried this Lowe's

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.790 
I was the first time I tried this Lowe's
worried<00:02:27.580> that<00:02:27.730> it<00:02:27.850> would<00:02:27.970> clump<00:02:28.560> with<00:02:29.560> those

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
worried that it would clump with those

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.040 
worried that it would clump with those
little<00:02:30.100> fibers<00:02:30.370> but<00:02:30.760> it<00:02:30.880> really<00:02:31.450> doesn't<00:02:31.750> and

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
little fibers but it really doesn't and

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:35.610 
little fibers but it really doesn't and
it's<00:02:32.170> so<00:02:32.440> easy<00:02:32.770> to<00:02:33.160> just<00:02:33.310> get<00:02:33.550> into<00:02:33.760> the<00:02:34.620> corner

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
it's so easy to just get into the corner

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:42.650 
it's so easy to just get into the corner
lashes<00:02:35.830> there<00:02:39.840> it's<00:02:40.840> a<00:02:40.960> really<00:02:41.200> nice<00:02:41.610> defined

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
lashes there it's a really nice defined

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:52.610 
lashes there it's a really nice defined
separated<00:02:43.660> look

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.619 

if<00:02:53.280> you<00:02:53.430> wanted<00:02:53.790> you<00:02:53.940> could<00:02:54.060> put<00:02:54.269> a<00:02:54.300> logo<00:02:54.480> on

00:02:54.619 --> 00:02:54.629 
if you wanted you could put a logo on

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:56.570 
if you wanted you could put a logo on
the<00:02:54.840> bottom<00:02:55.200> lash<00:02:55.440> since<00:02:55.739> I<00:02:55.860> tend<00:02:56.129> not<00:02:56.190> to<00:02:56.340> go

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
the bottom lash since I tend not to go

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:12.030 
the bottom lash since I tend not to go
too<00:02:56.640> crazy<00:02:56.819> with<00:02:57.269> my<00:02:57.450> bottom<00:02:57.780> lashes

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.850 

I'm<00:03:12.760> just<00:03:12.939> gonna<00:03:13.120> try<00:03:13.360> and<00:03:13.390> get<00:03:13.629> some<00:03:13.860> these

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:14.860 
I'm just gonna try and get some these

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:32.550 
I'm just gonna try and get some these
little<00:03:15.099> fibers<00:03:15.670> onto<00:03:15.969> the<00:03:16.090> ends<00:03:16.569> a<00:03:16.659> little<00:03:16.810> bit

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.900 

okay<00:03:33.560> so<00:03:33.620> you<00:03:33.920> can<00:03:34.160> see<00:03:34.370> the<00:03:34.490> difference

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:34.910 
okay so you can see the difference

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:37.060 
okay so you can see the difference
nobody<00:03:35.390> is<00:03:35.510> gonna<00:03:35.720> think<00:03:35.960> like<00:03:36.230> oh<00:03:36.470> she's<00:03:36.920> got

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:37.070 
nobody is gonna think like oh she's got

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:39.580 
nobody is gonna think like oh she's got
false<00:03:37.280> lashes<00:03:37.520> on<00:03:37.850> but<00:03:38.630> it<00:03:38.870> definitely<00:03:39.140> has

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 
false lashes on but it definitely has

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:41.860 
false lashes on but it definitely has
helped<00:03:40.040> to<00:03:40.220> lengthen<00:03:40.730> and<00:03:40.880> define<00:03:41.420> I<00:03:41.690> think

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
helped to lengthen and define I think

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:43.600 
helped to lengthen and define I think
it's<00:03:42.020> also<00:03:42.230> helping<00:03:42.740> to<00:03:42.920> hold<00:03:43.100> the<00:03:43.370> curl<00:03:43.580> a

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:43.610 
it's also helping to hold the curl a

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:45.610 
it's also helping to hold the curl a
little<00:03:44.030> bit<00:03:44.210> I<00:03:44.390> forgot<00:03:45.020> to<00:03:45.170> mention<00:03:45.260> that<00:03:45.560> I

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.620 
little bit I forgot to mention that I

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:47.350 
little bit I forgot to mention that I
had<00:03:45.860> already<00:03:46.040> curled<00:03:46.400> my<00:03:46.580> lashes<00:03:46.610> before

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:47.360 
had already curled my lashes before

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.900 
had already curled my lashes before
filming<00:03:47.630> this<00:03:47.990> just<00:03:48.920> to<00:03:49.010> open<00:03:49.160> them<00:03:49.430> up<00:03:49.490> my

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:49.910 
filming this just to open them up my

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:52.420 
filming this just to open them up my
lashes<00:03:50.530> not<00:03:51.530> bad<00:03:51.800> I'll<00:03:52.010> show<00:03:52.160> you<00:03:52.250> the<00:03:52.340> one

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430 
lashes not bad I'll show you the one

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:57.280 
lashes not bad I'll show you the one
without<00:03:52.520> mascara<00:03:53.060> on<00:03:54.160> they<00:03:55.930> they're<00:03:56.930> pretty

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 
without mascara on they they're pretty

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:02.170 
without mascara on they they're pretty
long<00:03:58.450> and<00:03:59.450> I<00:03:59.690> guess<00:03:59.900> average<00:04:00.410> thickness<00:04:01.180> you

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.180 
long and I guess average thickness you

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:05.700 
long and I guess average thickness you
know<00:04:02.300> I<00:04:02.330> I<00:04:02.420> do<00:04:02.690> favor<00:04:03.200> a<00:04:03.440> volumizing<00:04:04.070> mascara

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:05.710 
know I I do favor a volumizing mascara

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:07.930 
know I I do favor a volumizing mascara
but<00:04:06.710> they<00:04:06.830> do<00:04:06.890> tend<00:04:07.160> to<00:04:07.280> stick<00:04:07.520> out<00:04:07.670> quite

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:07.940 
but they do tend to stick out quite

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:10.510 
but they do tend to stick out quite
straight<00:04:08.330> and<00:04:08.570> not<00:04:08.810> have<00:04:09.020> a<00:04:09.050> natural<00:04:09.560> curl<00:04:09.800> so

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:10.520 
straight and not have a natural curl so

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:12.610 
straight and not have a natural curl so
I<00:04:10.910> curled<00:04:11.330> them<00:04:11.510> before<00:04:11.870> I<00:04:11.900> started<00:04:12.380> and<00:04:12.530> you

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:12.620 
I curled them before I started and you

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:13.840 
I curled them before I started and you
can<00:04:12.650> really<00:04:12.980> see<00:04:13.160> the<00:04:13.280> difference<00:04:13.400> I<00:04:13.820> think

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:13.850 
can really see the difference I think

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:23.530 
can really see the difference I think
down<00:04:14.780> for<00:04:15.050> you<00:04:21.550> volumizing<00:04:22.550> is<00:04:22.760> not<00:04:22.910> bad<00:04:23.210> I

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:23.540 
down for you volumizing is not bad I

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:27.070 
down for you volumizing is not bad I
mean<00:04:23.660> I<00:04:23.810> prefer<00:04:25.150> use<00:04:26.150> something<00:04:26.480> like<00:04:26.630> bad<00:04:26.840> gal

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080 
mean I prefer use something like bad gal

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.440 
mean I prefer use something like bad gal
lash<00:04:27.290> which<00:04:27.680> definitely<00:04:28.310> has<00:04:28.580> volumizing

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:29.450 
lash which definitely has volumizing

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:32.440 
lash which definitely has volumizing
effects<00:04:29.870> and<00:04:30.080> this<00:04:30.410> is<00:04:30.560> definitely<00:04:31.130> more<00:04:31.610> of<00:04:31.880> a

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:32.450 
effects and this is definitely more of a

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:35.200 
effects and this is definitely more of a
lengthening<00:04:32.960> and<00:04:33.320> defining<00:04:33.830> mascara<00:04:34.430> so<00:04:35.150> if

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.210 
lengthening and defining mascara so if

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:36.490 
lengthening and defining mascara so if
you<00:04:35.360> are<00:04:35.510> looking<00:04:35.750> for<00:04:35.930> that<00:04:36.050> then<00:04:36.230> this<00:04:36.350> could

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:36.500 
you are looking for that then this could

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.040 
you are looking for that then this could
be<00:04:36.560> a<00:04:36.650> good<00:04:36.860> choice<00:04:37.040> for<00:04:37.100> you<00:04:37.490> so<00:04:38.390> to<00:04:38.450> summarize

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.050 
be a good choice for you so to summarize

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:41.500 
be a good choice for you so to summarize
I<00:04:39.260> really<00:04:39.740> like<00:04:39.919> this<00:04:40.130> mascara<00:04:40.340> I'm<00:04:41.060> I'd

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:41.510 
I really like this mascara I'm I'd

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:44.080 
I really like this mascara I'm I'd
probably<00:04:41.930> prefer<00:04:42.260> if<00:04:43.100> it<00:04:43.310> had<00:04:43.460> a<00:04:43.490> little<00:04:43.940> bit

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:44.090 
probably prefer if it had a little bit

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:45.820 
probably prefer if it had a little bit
more<00:04:44.270> of<00:04:44.360> a<00:04:44.419> volumizing<00:04:44.930> effect<00:04:45.410> but<00:04:45.620> for<00:04:45.650> the

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:45.830 
more of a volumizing effect but for the

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:47.590 
more of a volumizing effect but for the
definition<00:04:46.340> and<00:04:46.460> lengthing<00:04:46.910> I<00:04:47.090> think<00:04:47.510> it's

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:47.600 
definition and lengthing I think it's

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.450

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:03.110 
it's a fiber mascara I wear contact

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:04.810 
it's a fiber mascara I wear contact
lenses<00:05:03.380> and<00:05:03.500> I<00:05:03.590> personally<00:05:04.070> haven't<00:05:04.370> had<00:05:04.640> any

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:04.820 
lenses and I personally haven't had any

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:07.210 
lenses and I personally haven't had any
issues<00:05:05.150> with<00:05:05.390> it<00:05:05.419> the<00:05:06.110> formula<00:05:06.530> feels<00:05:06.710> really

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:07.220 
issues with it the formula feels really

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:08.920 
issues with it the formula feels really
lightweight<00:05:07.460> on<00:05:07.880> the<00:05:08.030> lashes<00:05:08.210> as<00:05:08.510> well<00:05:08.720> I<00:05:08.840> mean

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:08.930 
lightweight on the lashes as well I mean

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:10.000 
lightweight on the lashes as well I mean
at<00:05:09.140> the<00:05:09.200> moment<00:05:09.230> I<00:05:09.470> don't<00:05:09.530> feel<00:05:09.770> like<00:05:09.890> I'm

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:10.010 
at the moment I don't feel like I'm

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:11.770 
at the moment I don't feel like I'm
wearing<00:05:10.160> any<00:05:10.340> mascara<00:05:10.820> at<00:05:11.030> all<00:05:11.240> and<00:05:11.570> I<00:05:11.720> think

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:11.780 
wearing any mascara at all and I think

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:13.600 
wearing any mascara at all and I think
that<00:05:12.050> that<00:05:12.230> really<00:05:12.410> helps<00:05:12.530> it<00:05:13.070> to<00:05:13.220> hold<00:05:13.250> the

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:13.610 
that that really helps it to hold the

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:15.400 
that that really helps it to hold the
curl<00:05:13.820> all<00:05:14.090> day<00:05:14.300> and<00:05:14.570> really<00:05:14.840> lift<00:05:15.020> the<00:05:15.260> lashes

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:15.410 
curl all day and really lift the lashes

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:18.159 
curl all day and really lift the lashes
so<00:05:16.280> I<00:05:16.310> really<00:05:16.760> do<00:05:16.940> like<00:05:17.090> this<00:05:17.450> one<00:05:17.930> thing<00:05:18.110> I

00:05:18.159 --> 00:05:18.169 
so I really do like this one thing I

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:19.780 
so I really do like this one thing I
will<00:05:18.320> say<00:05:18.350> is<00:05:18.710> that<00:05:18.740> if<00:05:19.010> you<00:05:19.190> rub<00:05:19.430> your<00:05:19.460> eyes<00:05:19.760> a

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:19.790 
will say is that if you rub your eyes a

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:21.550 
will say is that if you rub your eyes a
lot<00:05:20.150> you<00:05:20.300> need<00:05:20.450> to<00:05:20.600> be<00:05:20.690> careful<00:05:20.870> firstly

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:21.560 
lot you need to be careful firstly

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.650 
lot you need to be careful firstly
because<00:05:21.830> it's<00:05:21.980> a<00:05:22.100> fiber<00:05:22.310> mascara<00:05:22.610> and<00:05:23.210> also

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:23.660 
because it's a fiber mascara and also

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:25.480 
because it's a fiber mascara and also
because<00:05:23.900> it<00:05:24.020> will<00:05:24.200> smudge<00:05:24.530> but<00:05:25.040> other<00:05:25.280> than

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:25.490 
because it will smudge but other than

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:27.100 
because it will smudge but other than
that<00:05:25.550> I<00:05:25.730> think<00:05:25.910> it's<00:05:26.270> a<00:05:26.360> really<00:05:26.660> good<00:05:26.780> mascara

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:27.110 
that I think it's a really good mascara

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:28.930 
that I think it's a really good mascara
and<00:05:27.590> it's<00:05:27.680> easy<00:05:27.950> to<00:05:28.160> remove<00:05:28.430> at<00:05:28.580> the<00:05:28.669> end<00:05:28.820> of

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:28.940 
and it's easy to remove at the end of

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:30.460 
and it's easy to remove at the end of
the<00:05:29.000> day<00:05:29.180> as<00:05:29.360> well<00:05:29.630> if<00:05:29.960> you're<00:05:30.169> in<00:05:30.260> the<00:05:30.320> market
