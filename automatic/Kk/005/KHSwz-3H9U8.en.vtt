 tutorials that released today I 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.480
 will do a trick alone 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:11.280
 how to make the thumbnails appear 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.860
 on-screen administration tools 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.049
 windows 8 points 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:18.930
 we go there from this not so I'm going 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.150
 lower that and I think my mouse in 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.730
 the upper right corner to make 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.150
 appear on board charms and I'm going 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.650
 click on the home screen here 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:30.269
 as you can see when you 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.030
 go to the lower left corner 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:36.870
 a small arrow that appears one clicks 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.520
 top and the oils of apps that 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.469
 appear below the screen 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:47.940
 Home 

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:50.160
 if I go directly to see them 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.129
 options we have ergonomics options 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:56.670
 and the administration tools by 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:59.820
 defect are not visible 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:02.520

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:05.880
 welcome camps then we will do 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:08.250

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:15.150
 arrow in the upper right corner of 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.930

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.170

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:27.180
 settings in settings you have 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:30.270
 the thumbnail option so you click on 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.560
 thumbnails and a file the tools 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.350

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.890
