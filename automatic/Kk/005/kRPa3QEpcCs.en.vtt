00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
we went through

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.900 
we went through
if<00:00:57.090> we<00:00:57.239> studied<00:00:57.570> users<00:00:57.930> and<00:00:58.110> we<00:00:58.200> talked<00:00:58.470> to

00:00:58.900 --> 00:00:58.910 
if we studied users and we talked to

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:01.970 
if we studied users and we talked to
psychologists<00:00:59.910> we<00:01:00.149> found<00:01:00.480> is<00:01:00.870> that<00:01:01.170> there's

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
psychologists we found is that there's

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.920 
psychologists we found is that there's
this<00:01:02.129> idea<00:01:02.340> of<00:01:02.579> the<00:01:02.640> paradox<00:01:03.030> of<00:01:03.149> choice<00:01:03.210> so<00:01:03.809> we

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
this idea of the paradox of choice so we

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.540 
this idea of the paradox of choice so we
have<00:01:04.019> so<00:01:04.320> many<00:01:04.470> combination<00:01:05.070> so<00:01:05.339> many

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:05.550 
have so many combination so many

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:07.670 
have so many combination so many
different<00:01:05.729> options<00:01:06.260> people<00:01:07.260> sometimes<00:01:07.409> get

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
different options people sometimes get

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.920 
different options people sometimes get
overwhelmed<00:01:08.159> so<00:01:08.970> what<00:01:09.119> we<00:01:09.270> did<00:01:09.420> is<00:01:09.479> we<00:01:09.690> have

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
overwhelmed so what we did is we have

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.600 
overwhelmed so what we did is we have
categorize<00:01:10.500> these<00:01:10.650> into<00:01:10.920> themes<00:01:11.130> such<00:01:11.490> as

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
categorize these into themes such as

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.210 
categorize these into themes such as
cool<00:01:11.880> colors<00:01:12.270> neutral<00:01:12.869> colors<00:01:13.229> warm<00:01:13.800> colors

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
cool colors neutral colors warm colors

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.520 
cool colors neutral colors warm colors
so<00:01:14.700> that<00:01:14.850> it's<00:01:15.180> very<00:01:15.479> easy<00:01:15.660> for<00:01:15.840> users<00:01:16.320> to

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
so that it's very easy for users to

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.980 
so that it's very easy for users to
select<00:01:17.070> and<00:01:17.610> understand<00:01:18.060> which<00:01:18.450> one<00:01:18.660> wants

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990
