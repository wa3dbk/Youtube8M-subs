tornados sweep is the most useful since

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.170 
tornados sweep is the most useful since
you<00:02:46.959> can<00:02:47.110> attack<00:02:47.410> from<00:02:47.680> a<00:02:47.770> safe<00:02:47.980> distance<00:02:48.180> even

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
you can attack from a safe distance even

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:50.670 
you can attack from a safe distance even
though<00:02:49.270> it<00:02:49.420> does<00:02:49.600> take<00:02:49.630> a<00:02:49.870> few<00:02:50.140> seconds<00:02:50.560> to

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
can be quite frustrating a time since it

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.050 
can be quite frustrating a time since it
does<00:03:04.830> seem<00:03:05.040> like<00:03:05.070> the<00:03:05.340> enemies<00:03:05.640> in<00:03:05.790> the<00:03:05.880> game
