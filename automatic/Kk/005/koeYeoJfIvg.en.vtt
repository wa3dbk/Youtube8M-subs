00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
camera I'm going to make some calcium

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.470 
camera I'm going to make some calcium
blocks<00:00:07.290> these<00:00:07.859> are<00:00:08.099> for<00:00:08.309> mainly<00:00:08.820> for<00:00:09.090> finches

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
blocks these are for mainly for finches

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.400 
blocks these are for mainly for finches
these<00:00:09.660> ones<00:00:10.820> in<00:00:11.820> for<00:00:12.690> the<00:00:12.780> finches<00:00:13.110> I<00:00:13.230> don't

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
these ones in for the finches I don't

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.799 
these ones in for the finches I don't
put<00:00:13.590> as<00:00:13.679> much<00:00:13.860> plaster<00:00:14.670> Paris<00:00:15.030> in<00:00:15.210> the<00:00:15.330> mix<00:00:15.540> and

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
put as much plaster Paris in the mix and

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.010 
put as much plaster Paris in the mix and
it's<00:00:16.350> a<00:00:16.470> softer<00:00:16.859> more<00:00:17.010> crumbly<00:00:17.400> sort<00:00:17.760> of

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:18.020 
it's a softer more crumbly sort of

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:22.130 
it's a softer more crumbly sort of
calcium<00:00:19.020> block<00:00:19.230> and<00:00:20.660> this<00:00:21.660> is<00:00:21.840> what<00:00:21.960> we've<00:00:22.109> got

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
calcium block and this is what we've got

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:30.200 
calcium block and this is what we've got
okay<00:00:22.910> first<00:00:23.910> off<00:00:24.800> we've<00:00:25.800> got<00:00:29.029> this<00:00:30.029> is

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
okay first off we've got this is

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.620 
okay first off we've got this is
dolomite<00:00:30.890> now<00:00:31.890> dolomite<00:00:32.399> is<00:00:32.640> magnificent

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
dolomite now dolomite is magnificent

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.209 
dolomite now dolomite is magnificent
because<00:00:34.440> it's<00:00:34.710> a<00:00:34.800> mixture<00:00:35.790> of<00:00:36.410> both<00:00:37.410> calcium

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
because it's a mixture of both calcium

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:43.700 
because it's a mixture of both calcium
as<00:00:38.790> calcium<00:00:39.660> carbonate<00:00:40.379> with<00:00:41.219> magnesium<00:00:42.710> and

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
as calcium carbonate with magnesium and

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.779 
as calcium carbonate with magnesium and
it's<00:00:44.700> a<00:00:44.820> balanced<00:00:45.450> form<00:00:46.110> of<00:00:46.379> it<00:00:46.530> and<00:00:47.250> it's

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
it's a balanced form of it and it's

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.660 
it's a balanced form of it and it's
great<00:00:48.390> for<00:00:48.629> your<00:00:48.719> birds<00:00:49.010> okay<00:00:50.120> we've<00:00:51.120> got

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
calcium carbonate alright which is this

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.860 
calcium carbonate alright which is this
white<00:00:58.260> powder<00:00:59.420> okay<00:01:01.039> and<00:01:02.039> that's<00:01:02.190> a<00:01:02.570> good<00:01:03.570> form

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.410 
white powder okay and that's a good form
of<00:01:03.960> calcium<00:01:04.409> for<00:01:04.559> your<00:01:04.650> birds

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:05.420

then<00:01:06.420> we've<00:01:06.600> got<00:01:08.840> plaster<00:01:09.840> Paris<00:01:10.260> now<00:01:10.500> a<00:01:10.710> lot

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
then we've got plaster Paris now a lot

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.250 
then we've got plaster Paris now a lot
of<00:01:10.950> people<00:01:11.130> believe<00:01:11.640> plaster<00:01:12.270> Paris<00:01:12.689> is<00:01:13.170> just

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
of people believe plaster Paris is just

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.640 
of people believe plaster Paris is just
calcium<00:01:13.920> carbonate<00:01:14.400> I<00:01:14.610> can<00:01:15.509> guarantee<00:01:15.810> you<00:01:16.170> if

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
calcium carbonate I can guarantee you if

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.440 
calcium carbonate I can guarantee you if
you<00:01:16.860> just<00:01:17.040> mix<00:01:17.310> calcium<00:01:17.759> carbonate<00:01:18.180> in<00:01:18.299> there

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
you just mix calcium carbonate in there

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.560 
you just mix calcium carbonate in there
it<00:01:18.630> won't<00:01:18.960> go<00:01:19.290> it<00:01:19.619> won't<00:01:19.799> go<00:01:19.920> hard<00:01:20.189> at<00:01:20.340> all<00:01:20.570> so

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
it won't go it won't go hard at all so

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.570 
it won't go it won't go hard at all so
this<00:01:21.780> is<00:01:21.960> a<00:01:22.140> fixing<00:01:22.650> agent<00:01:23.040> it<00:01:23.159> has<00:01:23.310> something

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
this is a fixing agent it has something

if<00:02:43.049> you're<00:02:43.230> doing<00:02:43.379> parrot<00:02:43.830> blocks<00:02:44.129> just<00:02:45.000> gives

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
if you're doing parrot blocks just gives

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.130
