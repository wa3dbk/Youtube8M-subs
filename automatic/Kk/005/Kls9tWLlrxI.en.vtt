 lemonade and today we talk to you about 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:11.190
 such a thing as music in contact many 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:14.340
 of you don't use the usual player for 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.740
 iPhones and iPads and enjoy music 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.770
 which you have social networks 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.660
 contact here and let's consider now 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.930
 some applications that will 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:27.090
 do an excellent job with this task and 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:34.170
 At the end I will tell which one is the most. 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:39.000
 better now let's make brightness 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:41.690
 more I will immediately say in this review we i 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:48.149
 I'll show you 4 programs 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:55.050
 two of them are paid 2 no and probably still 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:58.199
 all the waves let's start go music 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:01.489
 and that means first I can quit 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:05.149
 caboose music music fan and in to playlist 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:05.149
 let's start the very first 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:11.729
 means that it is worth saying this program 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:16.950
 free because it is light narrow 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:21.420
 version well go away the real version is worth 1 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:23.340
 a dollar of 33 rubles in our mean when 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.280
 the first entrance as always force 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.890
 log in and we have a spider here it appears 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.810
 songs 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:33.720
 which you need to download on 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.759
 them from clicking on any and happening 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.210
 loading 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:43.380
 here is one of the downsides even if you song 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:45.149
 already here so loaded okay now 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:49.130
 I will say it appears green then we are on 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:51.600
 click it and download the song but 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:55.200
 let's let's show you what we 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:57.500
 we leave back by the way another knife this 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:01.409
 the program pretty much lags 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:04.530
 here it is, yes, I go here and here it goes 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:07.020
 download and moreover there is no one 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:11.150
 playlist have to switch to 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:15.849
 music he downloads without problems it was 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:19.239
 we have fourth place another look in to 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:22.879
 playlist app for free and 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:26.000
 also allows you to download music but she 

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:30.379
 downloads and not so cool that is it 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:35.420
 we just have a playlist song go 

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:38.379
 the playlist is loading and here we are you 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:40.730
 calmly we can click download and 

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:44.269
 song is downloaded then go 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:45.620
 downloads and also this is all listening also 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:47.329
 not very comfortable especially here 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:50.269
 advertising is constantly turning 

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:53.060
 cool and not very beautiful design and 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:55.879
 here are two programs we came two 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:59.209
 programs that are not and more cool 

00:02:55.879 --> 00:03:01.209
 doing your function here let's 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:04.370
 let's see first this music fan 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:07.370
 I think many programs already know well 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:10.189
 it is free and very good 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:13.420
 cope with their abilities 

00:03:10.189 --> 00:03:16.430
 authorization you have a playlist pops up and 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:18.889
 when listening fee you can click 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:20.810
 here on this star and immediately 

00:03:18.889 --> 00:03:23.180
 automatically download songs 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:25.400
 after which this little star happily 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:28.519
 jumps over as he is elected and here you are 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:36.319
 you can listen to her 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:38.299
 pumped the song permin here and through 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:42.919
 some time we will be shown as 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:44.319
 asterisk jumps from songs to 

00:03:42.919 --> 00:03:48.500
 favorites 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:50.780
 now let's wait worth saying 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:57.819
 that this program does not hang and also 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:04:02.479
 suitable for all more or less new 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:04.370
 platforms here jumped an asterisk and here 

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:06.919
 here we have a song now 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:09.739
 well correct your function and here 

00:04:06.919 --> 00:04:12.109
 one of the new arrivals over the centuries 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:14.389
 musician did very well their 

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:19.340
 great design opportunities 

00:04:14.389 --> 00:04:21.320
 programs mean that we go in my 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:25.340

 Windu quickly all I want to say one 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:34.240
 of the minuses is the program that the program 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:38.320
 requires almost every time you enter 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:41.240

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:45.650
