00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 well friends of the face of proof plus one 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:07.020
 Turns out gleidson rodrigues turned out to be 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.370
 the champion of the rodeo that champion moçada 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.500
 that changes but if I have a guy who 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.230
 Send the emotion, it's no use, huh? 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.299
 this brand is a first to find 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.250
 once again the program a great 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:21.630
 I'm happy to know that this is a 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:24.539
 Bigger balance there and all over Brazil soon 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:28.320
 Also, felipe is here in douradina 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:30.750
 to congratulate the staff add the 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.700
 rodrigo the cabeção is that the mayor 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.250
 for this party is exceptional 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.380
 here 's nardini you clear right? 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.110
 the ranch of the race without hitting a race 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.940
 with everyone hates uncertainty remains 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.809
 that we have to take into account is the 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:47.700
 public often admire the aac everything 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.980
 what you do because you have to 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.079
 spin a magic thing that is not just in the 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.910
 Brazil but it's in the United States in all 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.460
 the places where people really are 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.260
 are passionate about this practice and you 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:02.219
 have an important part is to lead the 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:04.290
 emotion that is every opening is upon request 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.630
 of protection that prayer that is a 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.000
 thing that the whole public is 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.970
 also an energy that is a nothingness within 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.030
 of an arena because you have and if that 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.890
 gift that is almost that would be a a shepherd 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.229
 playful but a preacher with certainty 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.360
 because there it is exalting calling 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.460
 all the positive energy of the activity 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.250
 make present in this world that the 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.409
 around it is actually the sporting Dodge 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.049
 I think it 's the only sport in the world that 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.720
 to say a prayer before starting it 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:36.150
 You know I think rodeo is a sport. 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:40.409
 we asked god our lady 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:42.659
 appeared that covers peace of love and 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.390
 that nothing bad happens the cowboys do not 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.659
 only cowboys as well as animals 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.340
 rodeo 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.740
 I think we have to preserve the 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.210
 animals is also very important because 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.140
 without them, the 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.579
 Show 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.950
 so we're always asking for the prayers 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.649
 what 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:01.310
 and always cover the cowboys and also the 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:03.079
 animals and that's cool, I guess 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.420
 a force also for spiritual people 

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:06.710
 very large and we rodeo speaker with 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.090
 his goal at the beginning to its vendors 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:10.250
 of emotions 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.500
 we sell different emotion in the 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.090
 united states people's lives 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.569
 Some people in Brazil have 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:19.910
 tried to put the rodeo speakers 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:21.860
 equal speaker of the United States under the 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.200
 egg all the united states 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:26.810
 he makes more comments when speaking to 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.420
 tension and so - and-so will go out the bull 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:32.150
 Tallow, Brazil 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.500
 are several beats if you pick it up here 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.319
 in these fingers 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:38.810
 there will be more rhythms then there are several 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:41.720
 musical rhythms that brazil has to 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:43.099
 Our culture is very rich and it did not 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.510
 right the way they wanted it 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:46.209
 I did there in the United States. 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:49.069
 I think leaving our reverence 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:50.780
 brazilian speaker joy songs 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:52.910
 because the Brazilian has a samba in the foot 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.590
 likes all the rhythms and the same 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.720
 time we transform the joy of the 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.430
 rodeo narration pass the information to 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.299
 the public the people who are in the 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.910
 watching 

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:03.859
 so this I think will not give up 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:05.660
 in any way and also of a game 

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:08.480
 all Brazil that wants to change what we 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:10.130
 we have around here and look at the squid 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.650
 is talking an interesting lot in 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:14.840
 relation to rodeo animals is is there 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:17.269
 Personal refers to the defenders 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.400
 animals is that thing all sessions 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:21.109
 It's but we want you to be one of those. 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.930
 come to know how to treat the animals 

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:25.609
 moder boy is true champions 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:27.530
 a rodeo ox on a horse and rode a 

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:29.420
 true athlete then this business that 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:31.160
 the animal is mistreated this is a 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:33.109
 tremendous on the highway we have 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.639
 registered has always shown rare 

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:36.139
 some exceptions from the manager suddenly 

00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:38.329
 there is any part of the 

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:41.150
 Brazil world and there are people 

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:42.799
 responsible but on average the animals 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:45.139
 They are also true athletes and you 

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:48.139
 tell if large amounts of 

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:50.359
 animal there is bulls there that the 

00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:54.349
 tropeiro paid 100 thousand reais of the animal 

00:03:50.359 --> 00:03:55.849
 to 80 thousand 60 and 70 in bulls where the 

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:57.440
 staff sometimes the other the turkey wants 

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:59.480
 pay 120 thousand 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:02.569
 but if it's a cool thing because the 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:04.290
 Next there is the pedophile priest not 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:07.860
 there is the politician 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:10.439
 corrupt or evil pastor too 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:12.930
 there is the bad cop 

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:15.840
 then we can not rodeo knots 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:18.900
 Let's pay that we are good for the bad. 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:21.090
 these tropeiros they speak 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:23.430
 which ties the bull's testicles so that 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:25.880
 he will come and jump the man who ties the 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:27.930
 test of an ox or a horse for him 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:31.110
 stimulate there has to be this guy 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:34.680
 prisoner without bail and more leads 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:37.139
 a chain beating or even doing the 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:39.780
 even with it ties his testicle 

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:41.810
 hang play up there is the guy who 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:44.190
 make a deal and not to the tissue of the animal 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:46.620
 For example, the mare has no 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:49.050
 testicle and she by a 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:52.380
 what happens to the animal in aoo 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:56.430
 animal if you catch and 1,000 bulls 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:59.669
 You're going to take this one did not have 10% of it. 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:01.919
 out to dodge this is still the 

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:02.610
 animal are the animals are more with the 

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:05.160
 500 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:07.919
 I came here today, you make yourself 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:10.229
 You do not have it then I think the cd in 

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:13.260
 which was to stimulate a certain animal not 

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:16.380
 I think it's the people repentes 

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:19.050
 use of animals is even closer 

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:20.760
 because it would be great if we did not 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:22.800

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:23.940

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:26.250
 dependency 

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:28.139
 these animals that the bad ones are 

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:31.260
 mistreating the face that mistreats a 

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:33.479

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:36.750
