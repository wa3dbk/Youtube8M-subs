00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
in my last video but then actually did a

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.660 
in my last video but then actually did a
little<00:03:16.750> bit<00:03:16.840> better<00:03:17.020> job<00:03:17.440> with<00:03:18.280> the<00:03:18.460> box

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670

the real civilian you can see the logo

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:59.940 
the real civilian you can see the logo
is<00:03:56.860> very<00:03:57.040> dark<00:03:57.250> on<00:03:57.490> it<00:03:57.610> and<00:03:58.110> the<00:03:59.110> g10<00:03:59.620> is<00:03:59.770> much

00:03:59.940 --> 00:03:59.950 
is very dark on it and the g10 is much

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:02.160 
is very dark on it and the g10 is much
grippier<00:04:00.460> that<00:04:01.420> wouldn't<00:04:01.690> say<00:04:01.780> much

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:02.170 
grippier that wouldn't say much

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:07.910 
grippier that wouldn't say much
it's<00:04:02.290> grippier<00:04:03.180> so<00:04:05.430> so<00:04:06.430> if<00:04:06.670> you<00:04:06.880> purchase<00:04:07.240> a

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:30.420 
flares out too much so they still have a

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:33.680 
flares out too much so they still have a
little<00:05:30.540> bit<00:05:30.660> of<00:05:30.750> work<00:05:30.930> to<00:05:31.140> do<00:05:31.290> in<00:05:31.470> it<00:05:31.620> but<00:05:32.690> good
