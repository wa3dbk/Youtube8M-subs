we're really not gonna surf that way
we're<00:00:06.629> gonna<00:00:06.720> do<00:00:06.930> temperature<00:00:07.379> surfing<00:00:07.859> on<00:00:08.099> a

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
we're gonna do temperature surfing on a

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.169 
we're gonna do temperature surfing on a
single<00:00:09.120> boiler<00:00:09.450> machine<00:00:09.840> and<00:00:10.550> I'm<00:00:11.550> using<00:00:12.000> the

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
single boiler machine and I'm using the

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.120 
single boiler machine and I'm using the
ranch<00:00:12.360> ilio<00:00:12.690> because<00:00:13.230> it's<00:00:13.410> just<00:00:13.740> a<00:00:13.830> good<00:00:13.980> one

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
ranch ilio because it's just a good one

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.029 
ranch ilio because it's just a good one
to<00:00:14.280> demonstrate<00:00:14.549> on<00:00:15.170> any<00:00:16.170> single<00:00:16.529> boiler

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
to demonstrate on any single boiler

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.490 
to demonstrate on any single boiler
machine<00:00:17.430> when<00:00:18.420> you<00:00:18.449> have<00:00:18.750> it<00:00:18.900> in<00:00:19.020> the<00:00:19.170> steam

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
machine when you have it in the steam

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.960 
machine when you have it in the steam
mode<00:00:19.740> this<00:00:20.160> one's<00:00:20.369> already<00:00:20.550> up<00:00:20.850> to

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
mode this one's already up to

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.710 
mode this one's already up to
temperature<00:00:21.390> for<00:00:21.570> steam<00:00:21.810> is<00:00:22.250> to<00:00:23.250> 85<00:00:23.730> to<00:00:24.359> 90

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
temperature for steam is to 85 to 90

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.529 
temperature for steam is to 85 to 90
right<00:00:24.869> in<00:00:25.019> through<00:00:25.230> there<00:00:26.000> when<00:00:27.000> you<00:00:27.119> go<00:00:27.300> back

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
right in through there when you go back

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.500 
right in through there when you go back
to<00:00:27.779> brewing<00:00:28.289> you<00:00:28.680> want<00:00:28.920> it<00:00:29.039> to<00:00:29.160> be<00:00:29.340> between<00:00:29.699> 195

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
to brewing you want it to be between 195

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.280 
to brewing you want it to be between 195
and<00:00:30.689> 204<00:00:31.669> so<00:00:32.669> let's<00:00:33.450> just<00:00:33.719> pretend<00:00:33.899> we've

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
and 204 so let's just pretend we've

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.299 
and 204 so let's just pretend we've
steamed<00:00:36.200> what<00:00:37.200> we're<00:00:37.320> gonna<00:00:37.410> do<00:00:37.649> to<00:00:37.800> cool<00:00:38.070> that

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
steamed what we're gonna do to cool that

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.850 
steamed what we're gonna do to cool that
boiler<00:00:38.760> down<00:00:39.030> without<00:00:39.660> waiting<00:00:40.050> cuz<00:00:40.500> if<00:00:40.680> I

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
boiler down without waiting cuz if I

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.410 
boiler down without waiting cuz if I
mean<00:00:41.010> if<00:00:41.040> I<00:00:41.250> shut<00:00:41.430> this<00:00:41.579> off<00:00:41.760> I'm<00:00:42.090> gonna<00:00:42.210> have

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
mean if I shut this off I'm gonna have

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.260 
mean if I shut this off I'm gonna have
to<00:00:42.540> wait<00:00:42.780> now<00:00:43.020> until<00:00:43.370> this<00:00:44.370> is<00:00:44.520> ready<00:00:44.789> to<00:00:45.000> brew

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
to wait now until this is ready to brew

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.720 
to wait now until this is ready to brew
and<00:00:45.510> we<00:00:45.660> won't<00:00:45.809> know<00:00:45.989> exactly<00:00:46.170> until<00:00:46.739> this

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
and we won't know exactly until this

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.100 
and we won't know exactly until this
light<00:00:48.000> comes<00:00:48.239> on<00:00:48.360> we're<00:00:48.539> not<00:00:48.660> really<00:00:48.899> gonna

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
light comes on we're not really gonna

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.020 
light comes on we're not really gonna
know<00:00:49.320> so<00:00:49.739> I'm<00:00:49.890> gonna<00:00:50.039> cool<00:00:50.760> it<00:00:50.879> down

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
know so I'm gonna cool it down

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.170 
know so I'm gonna cool it down
prematurely<00:00:51.949> by<00:00:52.949> making<00:00:53.340> cold<00:00:53.670> water<00:00:53.879> run

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
prematurely by making cold water run

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:00.529 
prematurely by making cold water run
from<00:00:54.590> here<00:00:55.590> into<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.489> boiler

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:05.499 

and<00:01:00.989> it<00:01:01.379> does<00:01:01.530> a<00:01:01.559> couple<00:01:01.679> of<00:01:02.039> things<00:01:02.280> actually

00:01:05.499 --> 00:01:05.509 

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:07.880 

it<00:01:06.509> cleans<00:01:06.780> out<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.020> scene<00:01:07.380> knobs<00:01:07.619> that<00:01:07.830> are

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
it cleans out the scene knobs that are

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:23.249 
it cleans out the scene knobs that are
the<00:01:08.130> screen<00:01:08.400> tip<00:01:08.960> after<00:01:09.960> your<00:01:10.259> tuning

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:23.259 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:25.929 

and<00:01:24.259> what<00:01:24.530> we're<00:01:24.680> waiting<00:01:25.040> to<00:01:25.159> do<00:01:25.340> is<00:01:25.579> to<00:01:25.759> we're

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:25.939 
and what we're waiting to do is to we're

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:33.399 
and what we're waiting to do is to we're
waiting<00:01:26.180> for<00:01:26.210> that<00:01:26.390> light<00:01:26.600> to<00:01:26.630> come<00:01:26.869> on

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:33.409 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:38.200 

that's<00:01:33.950> gonna<00:01:34.130> come<00:01:34.340> on<00:01:34.490> any<00:01:35.060> second<00:01:35.479> now<00:01:37.210> so

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
that's gonna come on any second now so

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.810 
that's gonna come on any second now so
oh<00:01:38.509> there<00:01:38.869> we<00:01:38.960> go<00:01:38.990> I<00:01:39.340> knew<00:01:40.340> it<00:01:40.460> was<00:01:40.580> gonna<00:01:40.729> come

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:40.820 
oh there we go I knew it was gonna come

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:45.490 
oh there we go I knew it was gonna come
on<00:01:41.030> any<00:01:41.180> second<00:01:41.570> see<00:01:41.659> clairvoyant<00:01:42.759> mm<00:01:44.500> anyway

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
on any second see clairvoyant mm anyway

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.359 
on any second see clairvoyant mm anyway
so<00:01:45.860> now<00:01:46.190> the<00:01:47.180> boiler<00:01:47.680> when<00:01:48.680> the<00:01:48.799> boiler<00:01:49.100> is<00:01:49.220> in

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:49.369 
so now the boiler when the boiler is in

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:52.960 
so now the boiler when the boiler is in
the<00:01:49.430> brew<00:01:49.670> mode<00:01:50.740> when<00:01:51.740> the<00:01:51.890> boiler<00:01:52.460> kicks<00:01:52.729> in

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:52.970 
the brew mode when the boiler kicks in

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:55.779 
the brew mode when the boiler kicks in
to<00:01:53.180> heat<00:01:53.390> up<00:01:53.570> it<00:01:54.350> could<00:01:54.560> be<00:01:54.619> as<00:01:54.830> much<00:01:55.039> as<00:01:55.100> 15

00:01:55.779 --> 00:01:55.789 
to heat up it could be as much as 15

00:01:55.789 --> 00:02:00.370 
to heat up it could be as much as 15
degrees<00:01:56.270> less<00:01:56.930> than<00:01:57.229> that<00:01:57.409> 195<00:01:58.280> to<00:01:58.610> 204<00:01:59.380> that's

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
degrees less than that 195 to 204 that's

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:01.930 
degrees less than that 195 to 204 that's
too<00:02:00.649> cold<00:02:00.920> to<00:02:01.039> brew<00:02:01.159> you're<00:02:01.310> gonna<00:02:01.460> get<00:02:01.580> a<00:02:01.640> sour

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:01.940 
too cold to brew you're gonna get a sour

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:04.870 
too cold to brew you're gonna get a sour
shot<00:02:02.350> so<00:02:03.350> your<00:02:04.190> weight<00:02:04.340> to<00:02:04.460> the<00:02:04.520> light<00:02:04.670> comes

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
shot so your weight to the light comes

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.790 
shot so your weight to the light comes
on<00:02:05.000> then<00:02:05.630> your<00:02:05.780> wait<00:02:05.990> for<00:02:06.229> the<00:02:06.289> light<00:02:06.530> to<00:02:06.560> go

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:06.800 
on then your wait for the light to go

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.160 
on then your wait for the light to go
off<00:02:06.979> when<00:02:07.520> the<00:02:07.640> light<00:02:07.789> goes<00:02:08.030> off<00:02:08.330> these

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
off when the light goes off these

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.250 
off when the light goes off these
boilers<00:02:09.590> actually<00:02:10.069> go<00:02:10.250> a<00:02:10.489> little<00:02:10.759> bit<00:02:10.940> above

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
boilers actually go a little bit above

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.440 
boilers actually go a little bit above
205<00:02:12.260> they<00:02:12.440> gonna<00:02:12.590> melt<00:02:12.800> up<00:02:12.980> to<00:02:13.160> 210<00:02:13.640> 211<00:02:13.970> 212

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
205 they gonna melt up to 210 211 212

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.170 
205 they gonna melt up to 210 211 212
right<00:02:14.959> up<00:02:15.050> in<00:02:15.200> there<00:02:15.430> what<00:02:16.430> we<00:02:16.580> found<00:02:16.850> is<00:02:17.150> that

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
right up in there what we found is that

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.410 
right up in there what we found is that
once<00:02:17.810> the<00:02:17.989> light<00:02:18.170> goes<00:02:18.200> off<00:02:18.940> you<00:02:19.940> then<00:02:20.120> wait

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
once the light goes off you then wait

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:25.390 
once the light goes off you then wait
about<00:02:21.010> 30<00:02:22.010> to<00:02:22.370> 45<00:02:23.000> seconds<00:02:23.450> or<00:02:23.600> so<00:02:24.040> the<00:02:25.040> boiler

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
about 30 to 45 seconds or so the boiler

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.330 
about 30 to 45 seconds or so the boiler
comes<00:02:25.910> down<00:02:26.150> off<00:02:26.510> of<00:02:26.720> its<00:02:26.900> peak<00:02:27.230> and<00:02:27.590> drops

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
comes down off of its peak and drops

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.880 
comes down off of its peak and drops
down<00:02:28.580> to<00:02:28.640> about<00:02:29.120> that<00:02:29.299> 204<00:02:29.810> 205<00:02:30.350> right<00:02:30.769> in

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
down to about that 204 205 right in

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:32.850 
down to about that 204 205 right in
through<00:02:31.069> there<00:02:31.130> now<00:02:32.000> you're<00:02:32.209> ready<00:02:32.390> to<00:02:32.600> brew

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
through there now you're ready to brew

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.580 
through there now you're ready to brew
so<00:02:33.860> when<00:02:34.010> that<00:02:34.100> light<00:02:34.280> goes<00:02:34.310> out<00:02:34.640> wait<00:02:35.420> 32<00:02:35.870> 30

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
so when that light goes out wait 32 30

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.910 
so when that light goes out wait 32 30
to<00:02:36.860> 45<00:02:37.459> seconds<00:02:37.880> or<00:02:38.030> so<00:02:38.209> brew<00:02:39.110> you<00:02:39.709> get<00:02:39.890> a

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
to 45 seconds or so brew you get a

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
to 45 seconds or so brew you get a
better<00:02:40.100> shot<00:02:40.370> and<00:02:40.549> that's<00:02:40.640> called

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
better shot and that's called

temperature surfing you're just you're

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.140 
temperature surfing you're just you're
just<00:02:43.280> fooling<00:02:43.519> the<00:02:43.790> boiler<00:02:44.180> into<00:02:44.829> getting<00:02:45.829> it

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
just fooling the boiler into getting it

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.080 
just fooling the boiler into getting it
closer<00:02:47.440> there<00:02:48.440> it<00:02:48.859> just<00:02:49.070> went<00:02:49.250> out<00:02:49.310> I<00:02:49.609> heard<00:02:49.970> it
