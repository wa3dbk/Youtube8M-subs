00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:12.170 
two pedals I'm building a new hardtail

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:14.419 
two pedals I'm building a new hardtail
mountainbike<00:00:13.170> and<00:00:13.559> I<00:00:13.590> obviously<00:00:13.860> needed<00:00:14.160> some

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
mountainbike and I obviously needed some

mountainbike and I obviously needed some
pedals<00:00:14.759> for<00:00:14.969> it<00:00:15.120> now<00:00:15.269> I'm<00:00:15.330> on<00:00:15.450> holiday<00:00:15.870> at<00:00:15.990> the

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
pedals for it now I'm on holiday at the

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.810 
pedals for it now I'm on holiday at the
moment<00:00:16.379> I<00:00:16.470> saw<00:00:16.650> these<00:00:16.859> in<00:00:17.010> a<00:00:17.070> local<00:00:17.400> bike<00:00:17.550> shop

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
moment I saw these in a local bike shop

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.029 
moment I saw these in a local bike shop
and<00:00:18.480> thought<00:00:18.660> you<00:00:18.840> know<00:00:18.869> what<00:00:18.990> the<00:00:19.500> hell<00:00:19.650> I've

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
and thought you know what the hell I've

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.790 
and thought you know what the hell I've
never<00:00:20.369> heard<00:00:20.640> of<00:00:20.760> HT<00:00:21.180> components<00:00:21.689> before<00:00:21.840> but

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
never heard of HT components before but

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.410 
never heard of HT components before but
after<00:00:23.340> doing<00:00:23.430> a<00:00:23.609> little<00:00:23.760> bit<00:00:23.910> of<00:00:24.000> research

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
after doing a little bit of research

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.359 
after doing a little bit of research
apparently<00:00:25.160> HT<00:00:26.160> components<00:00:26.789> makes<00:00:28.310> quite<00:00:29.310> a

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
apparently HT components makes quite a

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.490 
apparently HT components makes quite a
few<00:00:29.820> different<00:00:30.210> products<00:00:30.630> pedals<00:00:31.109> being<00:00:31.349> one

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
few different products pedals being one

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.080 
few different products pedals being one
of<00:00:31.529> them<00:00:31.769> but<00:00:31.949> they<00:00:32.579> also<00:00:32.669> do<00:00:32.969> the

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
of them but they also do the

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.270 
of them but they also do the
manufacturing<00:00:33.360> for<00:00:34.110> many<00:00:34.290> other<00:00:34.530> brands<00:00:35.010> of

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
manufacturing for many other brands of

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.819 
manufacturing for many other brands of
pedals<00:00:35.640> a<00:00:35.730> new<00:00:36.210> proof<00:00:36.510> for<00:00:36.870> example<00:00:37.380> is<00:00:37.530> one<00:00:37.710> of

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
pedals a new proof for example is one of

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.920 
pedals a new proof for example is one of
them<00:00:38.040> so<00:00:38.579> if<00:00:38.879> you<00:00:39.030> actually<00:00:39.149> go<00:00:39.390> onto<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.600> HT

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
them so if you actually go onto the HT

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.700 
them so if you actually go onto the HT
components<00:00:40.440> website<00:00:40.829> you<00:00:40.950> can<00:00:41.129> buy<00:00:41.390> pedals

we're over here they're nothing but it
says<00:01:11.540> 305<00:01:12.540> grams<00:01:12.570> per<00:01:13.170> pair<00:01:13.470> which<00:01:13.799> is<00:01:13.939> very

says 305 grams per pair which is very

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.910 
says 305 grams per pair which is very
very<00:01:15.390> lightweight<00:01:15.689> for<00:01:16.290> pedals<00:01:16.590> so<00:01:16.799> we're

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
very lightweight for pedals so we're

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.980 
very lightweight for pedals so we're
gonna<00:01:17.009> see<00:01:17.250> how<00:01:17.280> how<00:01:18.090> these<00:01:18.330> hold<00:01:18.600> up<00:01:18.780> over

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
gonna see how how these hold up over

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.460 
gonna see how how these hold up over
time<00:01:19.610> on<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:20.640> back<00:01:20.850> of<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.060> box<00:01:21.240> more<00:01:21.990> imagery

they<00:02:45.519> have<00:02:45.670> this<00:02:45.850> concave<00:02:46.530> tip<00:02:47.819> throughout

00:02:48.809 --> 00:02:48.819 
they have this concave tip throughout

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:51.120 
they have this concave tip throughout
the<00:02:49.030> middle<00:02:49.299> here<00:02:49.830> which<00:02:50.830> apparently

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
the middle here which apparently

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:53.100 
the middle here which apparently
according<00:02:51.970> to<00:02:52.060> the<00:02:52.150> guy<00:02:52.269> at<00:02:52.390> the<00:02:52.420> shop<00:02:52.480> you

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
according to the guy at the shop you

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:54.570 
according to the guy at the shop you
know<00:02:53.230> is<00:02:53.380> gonna<00:02:53.500> be<00:02:53.650> quite<00:02:53.830> useful<00:02:54.100> for

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:54.580 
know is gonna be quite useful for

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:56.280 
know is gonna be quite useful for
keeping<00:02:54.700> your<00:02:55.000> feet<00:02:55.150> on<00:02:55.420> the<00:02:55.600> pedals<00:02:55.930> by

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
keeping your feet on the pedals by

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.740 
keeping your feet on the pedals by
sinking<00:02:56.830> them<00:02:56.920> into<00:02:57.190> this<00:02:57.280> hole<00:02:57.540> the<00:02:58.540> only

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
sinking them into this hole the only

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.300 
sinking them into this hole the only
thing<00:02:58.870> that<00:02:58.989> really<00:02:59.170> gave<00:02:59.290> me<00:02:59.530> concern<00:03:00.010> in<00:03:00.220> the

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
thing that really gave me concern in the

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:05.250 
thing that really gave me concern in the
shop<00:03:00.610> was<00:03:00.880> the<00:03:01.030> exposed<00:03:01.569> axle<00:03:03.660> but<00:03:04.660> apparently

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
shop was the exposed axle but apparently

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.090 
shop was the exposed axle but apparently
this<00:03:05.590> isn't<00:03:05.799> a<00:03:05.980> big<00:03:06.130> deal<00:03:06.810> so<00:03:07.810> they<00:03:08.739> were<00:03:08.799> quite

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:09.100 
this isn't a big deal so they were quite

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:12.360 
this isn't a big deal so they were quite
cheap<00:03:09.489> and<00:03:10.480> like<00:03:10.720> I<00:03:10.840> said<00:03:10.900> HT<00:03:11.470> is<00:03:11.799> essentially

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
cheap and like I said HT is essentially

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.660 
cheap and like I said HT is essentially
the<00:03:12.549> OEM<00:03:13.060> brand<00:03:13.590> for<00:03:14.590> many<00:03:15.070> different<00:03:15.280> types

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
the OEM brand for many different types

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.060 
the OEM brand for many different types
of<00:03:15.850> pedals<00:03:16.239> and<00:03:16.750> I<00:03:16.810> don't<00:03:16.870> know<00:03:17.109> if<00:03:17.200> these<00:03:17.380> sold

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:18.070 
of pedals and I don't know if these sold

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:21.810 
of pedals and I don't know if these sold
under<00:03:18.459> another<00:03:18.760> name<00:03:20.070> perhaps<00:03:21.070> someone<00:03:21.549> can

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:21.820 
under another name perhaps someone can

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:25.890 
under another name perhaps someone can
tell<00:03:22.540> me<00:03:22.780> that<00:03:23.790> but<00:03:24.790> yeah<00:03:25.000> they<00:03:25.180> looked<00:03:25.359> really

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
tell me that but yeah they looked really

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.099 
tell me that but yeah they looked really
cool<00:03:26.079> a<00:03:26.769> good<00:03:27.220> price<00:03:27.519> so<00:03:28.390> I<00:03:28.420> figured<00:03:28.840> I'd<00:03:28.930> get

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:29.109 
cool a good price so I figured I'd get

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:32.009 
cool a good price so I figured I'd get
some<00:03:29.730> the<00:03:30.730> other<00:03:30.760> shop<00:03:31.239> also<00:03:31.450> had<00:03:31.750> them<00:03:31.900> in

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:32.019 
some the other shop also had them in

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:33.599 
some the other shop also had them in
black<00:03:32.350> I'm<00:03:32.680> not<00:03:32.859> sure<00:03:33.010> if<00:03:33.160> there<00:03:33.400> are<00:03:33.430> any

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:33.609

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:35.970 
black I'm not sure if there are any
other<00:03:33.820> colors<00:03:34.390> as<00:03:34.540> well<00:03:34.780> but<00:03:35.530> yeah<00:03:35.769> they<00:03:35.950> only

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980
