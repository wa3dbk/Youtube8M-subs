00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:48.990 
from these bricks so instead of building

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:52.340 
from these bricks so instead of building
a<00:00:49.340> truck<00:00:50.340> or<00:00:50.580> a<00:00:50.640> vehicle<00:00:51.330> we're<00:00:52.080> going<00:00:52.260> to

build a robot so in order to be a lego
creator<00:00:56.970> you've<00:00:57.330> probably<00:00:57.540> built<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:58.080> main

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
creator you've probably built the main

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.380 
creator you've probably built the main
model<00:00:58.470> in<00:00:58.650> the<00:00:58.770> set<00:00:59.010> which<00:00:59.460> is<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.850> digger<00:01:00.060> out

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
model in the set which is the digger out

model in the set which is the digger out
of<00:01:00.930> these<00:01:01.140> bricks<00:01:01.440> I'm<00:01:01.740> now<00:01:02.400> going<00:01:02.580> to<00:01:02.640> show

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
of these bricks I'm now going to show

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.870 
of these bricks I'm now going to show
you<00:01:02.910> how<00:01:03.690> we<00:01:03.750> can<00:01:04.049> build<00:01:04.290> a<00:01:04.530> robot<00:01:04.949> so<00:01:05.640> I'll

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
you how we can build a robot so I'll

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:12.620 
you how we can build a robot so I'll
quickly<00:01:06.090> dismantle<00:01:06.810> them<00:01:11.119> so<00:01:12.119> what<00:01:12.329> does<00:01:12.450> any

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
quickly dismantle them so what does any

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.389 
quickly dismantle them so what does any
a<00:01:12.659> robot<00:01:13.079> need<00:01:13.200> to<00:01:13.350> do<00:01:13.469> first<00:01:13.770> well<00:01:14.100> he<00:01:14.219> needs

00:01:14.389 --> 00:01:14.399 
a robot need to do first well he needs

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:17.300 
a robot need to do first well he needs
to<00:01:14.429> get<00:01:14.579> around<00:01:14.729> doesn't<00:01:15.210> he<00:01:15.299> so<00:01:15.990> be<00:01:16.920> silly<00:01:17.130> not

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
to get around doesn't he so be silly not

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.760 
to get around doesn't he so be silly not
to<00:01:17.369> use<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.759> wheels<00:01:17.939> to<00:01:18.149> make<00:01:18.270> him<00:01:18.450> do<00:01:18.600> this<00:01:18.810> so

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
to use the wheels to make him do this so

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.380 
to use the wheels to make him do this so
we<00:01:19.859> get<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.100> wheels<00:01:20.310> let's<00:01:21.030> join<00:01:21.240> them

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
we get the wheels let's join them

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.270 
we get the wheels let's join them
together<00:01:21.570> with<00:01:21.929> one<00:01:22.109> of<00:01:22.200> these<00:01:22.350> 2<00:01:22.590> by<00:01:22.619> 4<00:01:22.979> plates

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
together with one of these 2 by 4 plates

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.840 
together with one of these 2 by 4 plates
like<00:01:24.179> so<00:01:24.450> if<00:01:25.020> he's<00:01:25.950> zooming<00:01:26.280> about<00:01:26.520> a<00:01:26.549> lot

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
like so if he's zooming about a lot

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.429 
like so if he's zooming about a lot
maybe<00:01:27.390> you<00:01:27.539> need<00:01:27.689> a<00:01:27.719> bumper<00:01:28.170> on<00:01:28.289> the<00:01:28.320> front

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
maybe you need a bumper on the front

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.099 
maybe you need a bumper on the front
these<00:01:29.009> lamp<00:01:29.310> holders<00:01:29.729> would<00:01:29.850> be<00:01:29.999> perfect<00:01:30.570> to

00:01:31.099 --> 00:01:31.109 
these lamp holders would be perfect to

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:33.289 
these lamp holders would be perfect to
use<00:01:31.259> for<00:01:31.289> that<00:01:31.640> and<00:01:32.640> they'll<00:01:32.850> stop<00:01:33.090> you<00:01:33.119> in

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
use for that and they'll stop you in

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:34.279 
use for that and they'll stop you in
crashing<00:01:33.659> into<00:01:33.869> anything

00:01:34.279 --> 00:01:34.289 
crashing into anything

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:35.899 
crashing into anything
now<00:01:34.590> let's<00:01:34.799> strengthen<00:01:35.069> move<00:01:35.369> it<00:01:35.490> in<00:01:35.640> a<00:01:35.729> bit

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
now let's strengthen move it in a bit

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.779 
now let's strengthen move it in a bit
with<00:01:36.149> another<00:01:36.509> 2x4<00:01:37.229> black<00:01:37.499> plate<00:01:37.740> maybe<00:01:38.579> you

00:01:38.779 --> 00:01:38.789 
with another 2x4 black plate maybe you

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:41.120 
with another 2x4 black plate maybe you
could<00:01:38.939> have<00:01:39.060> a<00:01:39.090> tow<00:01:39.359> bar<00:01:39.539> on<00:01:39.749> the<00:01:39.840> back<00:01:40.130> this

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
could have a tow bar on the back this

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.010 
could have a tow bar on the back this
element<00:01:41.579> could<00:01:41.700> be<00:01:41.819> good<00:01:41.969> for<00:01:42.090> that<00:01:42.240> place

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
element could be good for that place

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.630 
element could be good for that place
that<00:01:43.229> on<00:01:43.350> there

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
that on there

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.149 
that on there
how's<00:01:45.359> he<00:01:45.569> going<00:01:45.719> to<00:01:45.840> power<00:01:46.200> himself<00:01:46.469> he<00:01:47.009> needs

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
how's he going to power himself he needs

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.429 
how's he going to power himself he needs
an<00:01:47.340> engine<00:01:47.729> these<00:01:48.240> grilles<00:01:48.689> give<00:01:49.139> a<00:01:49.289> good

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
an engine these grilles give a good

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.620 
an engine these grilles give a good
impression<00:01:49.979> of<00:01:50.039> an<00:01:50.189> engine<00:01:50.549> underneath<00:01:50.850> you

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
impression of an engine underneath you

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.959 
impression of an engine underneath you
place<00:01:51.899> those<00:01:52.139> on<00:01:52.409> and<00:01:52.710> get<00:01:53.310> these<00:01:53.490> two<00:01:53.759> yellow

00:01:53.959 --> 00:01:53.969 
place those on and get these two yellow

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:56.389 
place those on and get these two yellow
2<00:01:54.179> by<00:01:54.569> 3<00:01:54.840> plates<00:01:55.109> stack<00:01:55.649> them<00:01:55.829> together<00:01:56.009> to

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
2 by 3 plates stack them together to

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:57.139 
2 by 3 plates stack them together to
build<00:01:56.520> him<00:01:56.700> up<00:01:56.789> a<00:01:56.939> bit

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
build him up a bit

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.330 
build him up a bit
it's<00:01:57.929> going<00:01:58.079> to<00:01:58.139> be<00:01:58.229> a<00:01:58.259> nice<00:01:58.469> fast<00:01:58.740> big<00:01:59.039> engine

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
it's going to be a nice fast big engine

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.720 
it's going to be a nice fast big engine
in<00:01:59.459> there

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:01.730 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:05.110 

and<00:02:01.820> maybe<00:02:02.630> we<00:02:02.900> have<00:02:02.930> some<00:02:03.500> pipe<00:02:03.860> pipe<00:02:04.760> work

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:05.120 
and maybe we have some pipe pipe work

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.230 
and maybe we have some pipe pipe work
with<00:02:05.600> these<00:02:05.840> gray<00:02:06.200> dots<00:02:06.500> we<00:02:07.490> place<00:02:07.790> these

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:08.240 
with these gray dots we place these

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:11.140 
with these gray dots we place these
there<00:02:08.600> like<00:02:08.900> so<00:02:09.230> then<00:02:10.190> what<00:02:10.790> else<00:02:10.940> does<00:02:11.120> a

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
there like so then what else does a

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.150 
there like so then what else does a
robot<00:02:11.390> need<00:02:11.750> well<00:02:11.990> he<00:02:12.080> needs<00:02:12.290> to<00:02:12.440> carry<00:02:12.860> stuff

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
robot need well he needs to carry stuff

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.740 
robot need well he needs to carry stuff
around<00:02:13.490> maybe<00:02:14.090> we<00:02:14.270> should<00:02:14.420> give<00:02:14.540> him<00:02:14.630> some

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
around maybe we should give him some

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:15.280 
around maybe we should give him some
arms

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
arms

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.260 
arms
these<00:02:15.860> look<00:02:16.100> like<00:02:16.130> arms<00:02:16.640> but<00:02:16.880> how<00:02:17.030> do<00:02:17.090> we

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
these look like arms but how do we

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:20.110 
these look like arms but how do we
attach<00:02:17.570> them<00:02:17.780> to<00:02:17.960> the<00:02:18.080> body<00:02:18.490> maybe<00:02:19.490> we<00:02:19.880> could

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
attach them to the body maybe we could

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.170 
attach them to the body maybe we could
use<00:02:20.480> this<00:02:20.840> element<00:02:21.350> this<00:02:21.470> hinge<00:02:21.800> we<00:02:22.700> place<00:02:22.940> one

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
use this element this hinge we place one

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.590 
use this element this hinge we place one
on<00:02:23.210> each<00:02:23.330> side<00:02:24.430> then<00:02:25.430> that<00:02:25.670> lets<00:02:25.910> us<00:02:26.120> place<00:02:26.390> the

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
on each side then that lets us place the

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:33.250 
on each side then that lets us place the
arms<00:02:26.930> on<00:02:27.670> like<00:02:28.670> this<00:02:29.320> there<00:02:30.320> we<00:02:30.470> go<00:02:31.270> right<00:02:32.270> what

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
arms on like this there we go right what

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.140 
arms on like this there we go right what
else<00:02:33.320> does<00:02:33.710> he<00:02:33.830> need<00:02:33.860> well<00:02:34.250> robot<00:02:34.760> needs<00:02:35.000> a

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
else does he need well robot needs a

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:36.670 
else does he need well robot needs a
heart<00:02:35.390> doesn't<00:02:35.690> it<00:02:35.810> he<00:02:35.960> needs<00:02:36.170> to<00:02:36.320> be<00:02:36.440> powered

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
heart doesn't it he needs to be powered

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.480 
heart doesn't it he needs to be powered
somehow<00:02:37.280> so<00:02:37.850> if<00:02:38.330> we<00:02:38.570> get<00:02:38.750> these<00:02:38.980> elements<00:02:39.980> two

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:40.490 
somehow so if we get these elements two

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:43.120 
somehow so if we get these elements two
of<00:02:40.640> those<00:02:40.850> stack<00:02:41.510> them<00:02:41.690> together<00:02:41.810> place<00:02:42.710> it<00:02:42.950> on

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
of those stack them together place it on

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:48.370 
of those stack them together place it on
like<00:02:43.370> so<00:02:43.400> and<00:02:44.800> we<00:02:45.800> pop<00:02:46.100> a<00:02:46.780> Technic<00:02:47.780> snap<00:02:48.080> into

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
like so and we pop a Technic snap into

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:53.580 
like so and we pop a Technic snap into
it<00:02:49.220> like<00:02:49.400> so<00:02:49.810> we<00:02:50.810> can<00:02:50.840> give<00:02:51.380> him<00:02:51.410> a<00:02:51.920> power<00:02:52.520> light

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
it like so we can give him a power light

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.720 
it like so we can give him a power light
there<00:02:54.590> we<00:02:54.710> go<00:02:54.890> so<00:02:55.160> we<00:02:55.310> know<00:02:55.460> if<00:02:55.580> he's

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
there we go so we know if he's

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.080 
there we go so we know if he's
short-circuited<00:02:56.540> or<00:02:56.660> not<00:02:57.520> and<00:02:58.520> if<00:02:58.730> we<00:02:58.850> build

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
short-circuited or not and if we build

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:04.970 
short-circuited or not and if we build
up<00:02:59.270> the<00:02:59.420> back<00:02:59.570> with<00:02:59.840> some<00:03:00.050> slopes<00:03:01.570> like<00:03:02.570> say

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.670 

we<00:03:05.980> could<00:03:06.250> maybe<00:03:06.520> use<00:03:06.940> this<00:03:07.180> element<00:03:07.600> it<00:03:08.440> kind

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
we could maybe use this element it kind

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.520 
we could maybe use this element it kind
of<00:03:08.740> looks<00:03:08.920> like<00:03:09.010> shoulder<00:03:09.520> pads<00:03:10.230> yeah<00:03:11.230> let's

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
of looks like shoulder pads yeah let's

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.460 
of looks like shoulder pads yeah let's
put<00:03:11.740> those<00:03:11.890> on<00:03:12.190> like<00:03:13.030> that<00:03:13.360> that<00:03:13.870> works<00:03:14.170> really

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
put those on like that that works really

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:19.020 
put those on like that that works really
well<00:03:15.270> now<00:03:16.270> if<00:03:16.750> we<00:03:17.200> stack<00:03:17.830> two<00:03:18.280> gray<00:03:18.670> plates

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
well now if we stack two gray plates

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.150 
well now if we stack two gray plates
together<00:03:19.300> we<00:03:19.930> can<00:03:20.140> start<00:03:20.410> to<00:03:20.560> get<00:03:20.710> some<00:03:20.770> height

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
together we can start to get some height

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:26.610 
together we can start to get some height
for<00:03:21.610> his<00:03:21.700> head<00:03:22.770> I'll<00:03:23.770> no<00:03:24.220> hang<00:03:24.430> on<00:03:24.550> maybe<00:03:25.620> we

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
for his head I'll no hang on maybe we

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.340 
for his head I'll no hang on maybe we
should<00:03:26.830> actually<00:03:27.300> give<00:03:28.300> him<00:03:28.450> a<00:03:28.600> mouth<00:03:28.960> first

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:29.350 
should actually give him a mouth first

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:35.100 
should actually give him a mouth first
if<00:03:29.910> we<00:03:30.910> take<00:03:31.330> this<00:03:32.230> element<00:03:32.710> and<00:03:33.660> the<00:03:34.660> same<00:03:34.900> one

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:35.110 
if we take this element and the same one

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:40.050 
if we take this element and the same one
again<00:03:37.260> that<00:03:38.260> kind<00:03:38.560> of<00:03:38.680> looks<00:03:38.860> like<00:03:38.950> a<00:03:39.100> smiley

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
again that kind of looks like a smiley

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.370 
again that kind of looks like a smiley
mouth<00:03:40.410> yeah<00:03:41.410> we<00:03:42.370> build<00:03:42.610> up<00:03:42.730> behind<00:03:43.150> then<00:03:44.080> put

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:44.380 
mouth yeah we build up behind then put

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:48.680 
mouth yeah we build up behind then put
these<00:03:44.530> two<00:03:45.490> stacked<00:03:45.910> 2x2<00:03:46.480> grey<00:03:46.870> plates<00:03:47.170> on<00:03:47.470> top

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
these two stacked 2x2 grey plates on top

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.990 
these two stacked 2x2 grey plates on top
then<00:03:49.690> maybe<00:03:49.959> we<00:03:50.200> can<00:03:50.380> start<00:03:50.709> to<00:03:51.040> work<00:03:51.640> on<00:03:51.850> the

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 
then maybe we can start to work on the

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.370 
then maybe we can start to work on the
eyes<00:03:52.150> now<00:03:52.540> how<00:03:52.720> we're<00:03:52.930> going<00:03:53.050> to<00:03:53.140> give<00:03:53.260> him

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:53.380 
eyes now how we're going to give him

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:55.680 
eyes now how we're going to give him
some<00:03:53.410> eyes<00:03:53.770> we<00:03:54.730> love<00:03:55.000> this<00:03:55.209> element<00:03:55.600> in

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:55.690 
some eyes we love this element in

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:57.210 
some eyes we love this element in
created<00:03:56.080> because<00:03:56.230> it<00:03:56.380> lets<00:03:56.530> us<00:03:56.680> build<00:03:56.920> in

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 
created because it lets us build in

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.790 
created because it lets us build in
other<00:03:57.610> directions<00:03:57.990> maybe<00:03:58.990> if<00:03:59.200> we<00:03:59.350> place<00:03:59.560> this

00:03:59.790 --> 00:03:59.800 
other directions maybe if we place this

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:03.090 
other directions maybe if we place this
here<00:04:00.720> we<00:04:01.720> could<00:04:01.900> actually<00:04:02.020> attach<00:04:02.380> something

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:03.100 
here we could actually attach something

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:06.420 
here we could actually attach something
that<00:04:03.640> could<00:04:03.850> look<00:04:03.970> like<00:04:04.209> eyes<00:04:05.160> how<00:04:06.160> are<00:04:06.220> we

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:06.430 
that could look like eyes how are we

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:09.240 
that could look like eyes how are we
going<00:04:06.610> to<00:04:06.730> do<00:04:06.910> eyes<00:04:07.300> well<00:04:07.930> we<00:04:08.860> could<00:04:09.040> take<00:04:09.220> a

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250 
going to do eyes well we could take a

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:12.380 
going to do eyes well we could take a
red<00:04:09.550> dot<00:04:09.959> place<00:04:10.959> it<00:04:11.170> on<00:04:11.290> a<00:04:11.320> lamp<00:04:11.560> holder<00:04:11.980> and

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:12.390 
red dot place it on a lamp holder and

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:16.349 
red dot place it on a lamp holder and
then<00:04:13.390> place<00:04:13.660> it<00:04:13.870> on<00:04:13.989> like<00:04:14.200> this<00:04:15.030> and<00:04:16.030> it<00:04:16.120> kind

rocket boosters now we've got this brick
here<00:04:58.690> that<00:04:59.690> could<00:04:59.900> be<00:05:00.050> an<00:05:00.260> exhaust<00:05:00.680> pipe<00:05:00.950> on

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:01.130

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:04.510 
here that could be an exhaust pipe on
the<00:05:01.190> back<00:05:01.430> like<00:05:01.640> that<00:05:01.670> and<00:05:02.120> maybe<00:05:02.930> we<00:05:03.050> put<00:05:03.520> the
