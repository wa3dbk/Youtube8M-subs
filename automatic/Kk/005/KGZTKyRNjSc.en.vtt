to the picture it's not huge rocking
rock<00:02:01.570> rocket<00:02:02.410> science<00:02:02.860> and<00:02:04.049> this<00:02:05.049> builds

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:06.330 
rock rocket science and this builds

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:12.630 
rock rocket science and this builds
creativity<00:02:09.600> so<00:02:10.600> the<00:02:10.780> next<00:02:11.019> person<00:02:11.459> who<00:02:12.459> has
