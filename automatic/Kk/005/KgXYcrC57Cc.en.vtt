for<00:02:29.980> the<00:02:30.970> sport<00:02:31.209> that<00:02:31.300> you<00:02:31.420> do<00:02:31.570> in<00:02:31.750> this<00:02:31.870> guy

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
for the sport that you do in this guy

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:33.810 
for the sport that you do in this guy
sure<00:02:32.320> I<00:02:32.470> went<00:02:32.620> over<00:02:32.860> the<00:02:32.950> falls<00:02:33.130> on<00:02:33.430> them<00:02:33.550> on

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:33.820 
sure I went over the falls on them on

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:38.100 
sure I went over the falls on them on
about<00:02:34.150> a<00:02:34.180> 45<00:02:34.990> 50<00:02:35.290> foot<00:02:35.440> wave<00:02:35.620> and<00:02:36.870> when<00:02:37.870> I<00:02:37.900> went

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
about a 45 50 foot wave and when I went

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.860 
about a 45 50 foot wave and when I went
over<00:02:38.410> it<00:02:38.470> and<00:02:38.830> it<00:02:38.980> broke<00:02:39.190> morning<00:02:40.150> I<00:02:40.330> got

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
over it and it broke morning I got

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.510 
over it and it broke morning I got
sucked<00:02:41.200> over<00:02:41.350> when<00:02:41.680> it<00:02:41.770> broke<00:02:42.040> it<00:02:42.250> took<00:02:42.400> my

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:42.520 
sucked over when it broke it took my

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:45.420 
sucked over when it broke it took my
armor<00:02:42.790> on<00:02:42.910> my<00:02:43.000> back<00:02:43.180> and<00:02:43.209> snap<00:02:43.840> my<00:02:44.190> PEC<00:02:45.190> minor

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
armor on my back and snap my PEC minor

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.580 
armor on my back and snap my PEC minor
which<00:02:45.790> is<00:02:45.970> this<00:02:46.360> big<00:02:46.840> muscle<00:02:47.200> that<00:02:47.260> comes<00:02:47.470> out

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
which is this big muscle that comes out

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.250 
which is this big muscle that comes out
of<00:02:47.620> your<00:02:47.680> armpit<00:02:48.010> to<00:02:48.610> hear<00:02:48.910> snap<00:02:49.870> it<00:02:50.020> off<00:02:50.080> the

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
of your armpit to hear snap it off the

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.009 
of your armpit to hear snap it off the
bounce<00:02:50.440> of<00:02:50.620> thing<00:02:50.769> that<00:02:51.420> it<00:02:52.420> cut<00:02:52.570> me<00:02:52.600> open<00:02:52.720> and

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:53.019 
bounce of thing that it cut me open and

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:55.199 
bounce of thing that it cut me open and
drill<00:02:53.260> four<00:02:53.470> holes<00:02:53.500> in<00:02:53.860> my<00:02:53.950> arm<00:02:54.160> and<00:02:54.370> lace<00:02:55.030> it

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
drill four holes in my arm and lace it

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:57.420 
drill four holes in my arm and lace it
like<00:02:55.330> a<00:02:55.360> shoe<00:02:55.660> reattach<00:02:56.200> this<00:02:56.890> whole<00:02:57.130> muscle

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
like a shoe reattach this whole muscle

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.600 
like a shoe reattach this whole muscle
which<00:02:57.760> is<00:02:57.910> your<00:02:58.060> pet<00:02:58.269> back<00:02:58.950> to<00:02:59.950> them<00:03:00.100> to<00:03:00.489> the

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
which is your pet back to them to the

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:02.400 
which is your pet back to them to the
bone<00:03:00.790> so<00:03:01.300> I<00:03:01.330> have<00:03:01.510> a<00:03:01.540> little<00:03:01.690> dents<00:03:02.170> in<00:03:02.260> there

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
bone so I have a little dents in there

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.640 
bone so I have a little dents in there
where<00:03:02.530> they<00:03:02.590> pulled<00:03:02.860> it<00:03:02.950> all<00:03:03.100> right<00:03:03.250> but<00:03:04.239> um<00:03:04.650> so

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
where they pulled it all right but um so

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:07.949 
where they pulled it all right but um so
I<00:03:05.680> just<00:03:05.860> kind<00:03:06.070> of<00:03:06.100> felt<00:03:06.420> some<00:03:07.420> and<00:03:07.720> I<00:03:07.780> don't

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
I just kind of felt some and I don't

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:09.270 
I just kind of felt some and I don't
know<00:03:08.019> how<00:03:08.140> I<00:03:08.170> did<00:03:08.350> I<00:03:08.440> think<00:03:08.680> I<00:03:08.739> pulled<00:03:09.010> the<00:03:09.100> jet

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
know how I did I think I pulled the jet

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:10.650 
know how I did I think I pulled the jet
ski<00:03:09.459> trailer<00:03:09.580> if<00:03:09.790> I<00:03:09.850> put<00:03:10.030> it<00:03:10.120> on<00:03:10.180> my<00:03:10.239> arm<00:03:10.330> like

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
ski trailer if I put it on my arm like

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:23.380 
ski trailer if I put it on my arm like
this<00:03:10.720> stuff<00:03:11.050> though<00:03:11.650> i<00:03:11.680> propped<00:03:12.130> up<00:03:16.260> there

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:23.390 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:26.780 

probably<00:03:24.390> high<00:03:24.510> on<00:03:24.540> this<00:03:24.930> side<00:03:25.140> huh<00:03:25.290> yeah<00:03:25.790> and

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
probably high on this side huh yeah and

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.320 
probably high on this side huh yeah and
a<00:03:27.120> half<00:03:27.530> neuromuscular<00:03:28.530> therapy<00:03:28.560> actually

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:29.330 
a half neuromuscular therapy actually

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:31.820 
a half neuromuscular therapy actually
reduces<00:03:30.330> the<00:03:30.750> curve<00:03:31.110> in<00:03:31.290> the<00:03:31.379> spine<00:03:31.409> the

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:31.830 
reduces the curve in the spine the

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:33.530 
reduces the curve in the spine the
scoliosis<00:03:32.220> so<00:03:32.700> the<00:03:32.819> shoulder<00:03:33.030> of<00:03:33.180> the<00:03:33.269> tire

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
scoliosis so the shoulder of the tire

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.570 
scoliosis so the shoulder of the tire
the<00:03:34.140> hip<00:03:34.319> this<00:03:34.500> higher<00:03:34.709> actually<00:03:35.069> comes<00:03:35.370> back

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:35.580 
the hip this higher actually comes back

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:37.610 
the hip this higher actually comes back
down<00:03:35.760> so<00:03:36.540> when<00:03:36.690> it<00:03:36.780> comes<00:03:36.840> back<00:03:37.049> down<00:03:37.110> the

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
down so when it comes back down the

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.740 
down so when it comes back down the
nerves<00:03:37.830> are<00:03:37.980> not<00:03:38.159> being<00:03:38.340> pinched<00:03:38.700> anymore<00:03:39.120> so

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
nerves are not being pinched anymore so

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.180 
nerves are not being pinched anymore so
the<00:03:40.080> first<00:03:40.230> blood<00:03:40.470> gets<00:03:40.620> back<00:03:40.769> into<00:03:40.950> all<00:03:41.099> the

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
the first blood gets back into all the

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.400 
the first blood gets back into all the
muscles<00:03:41.549> so<00:03:41.819> when<00:03:42.180> the<00:03:42.330> nerves<00:03:42.930> that<00:03:43.019> actually

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
muscles so when the nerves that actually

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.050 
muscles so when the nerves that actually
make<00:03:43.650> those<00:03:43.890> muscles<00:03:44.310> work<00:03:44.580> in<00:03:44.760> the<00:03:44.849> first

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
make those muscles work in the first

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.990 
make those muscles work in the first
place<00:03:45.799> affecting<00:03:46.799> performance<00:03:46.980> when<00:03:47.849> they're

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
place affecting performance when they're

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.900 
place affecting performance when they're
the<00:03:48.510> scoliosis<00:03:49.110> actually<00:03:49.799> reduces<00:03:50.459> the

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
the scoliosis actually reduces the

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:53.930 
the scoliosis actually reduces the
ability<00:03:51.000> for<00:03:51.420> people<00:03:51.930> to<00:03:52.110> enjoy<00:03:53.040> their<00:03:53.400> sport

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
ability for people to enjoy their sport

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:56.059 
ability for people to enjoy their sport
so<00:03:54.299> I<00:03:54.329> actually<00:03:54.629> change<00:03:55.019> all<00:03:55.200> that<00:03:55.230> and<00:03:55.739> get

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:56.069 
so I actually change all that and get

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:57.949 
so I actually change all that and get
people<00:03:56.370> back<00:03:56.459> having<00:03:56.849> fun<00:03:57.030> again<00:03:57.120> kind<00:03:57.690> of<00:03:57.720> but

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
people back having fun again kind of but

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:05.479 
people back having fun again kind of but
I<00:03:58.670> right<00:03:59.670> we<00:03:59.819> push<00:04:00.180> to<00:04:00.480> right<00:04:00.989> in<00:04:01.109> there<00:04:04.489> that's

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:05.489 
I right we push to right in there that's

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:06.979 
I right we push to right in there that's
good<00:04:05.670> i<00:04:05.760> brought<00:04:05.970> the<00:04:06.090> hydrofoil<00:04:06.599> the<00:04:06.810> other

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:06.989 
good i brought the hydrofoil the other

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:08.210 
good i brought the hydrofoil the other
day<00:04:07.109> these<00:04:07.290> muscles<00:04:07.650> have<00:04:07.739> been<00:04:07.829> too<00:04:07.950> big<00:04:08.069> so

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
day these muscles have been too big so

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.809 
day these muscles have been too big so
much<00:04:08.400> and<00:04:08.780> a<00:04:09.780> repetitive<00:04:10.470> motion<00:04:10.920> and<00:04:11.129> so

00:04:11.809 --> 00:04:11.819 
much and a repetitive motion and so

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:13.819 
much and a repetitive motion and so
repetitive<00:04:12.180> motion<00:04:12.660> is<00:04:12.900> making<00:04:13.739> these

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:13.829 
repetitive motion is making these

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:15.770 
repetitive motion is making these
muscles<00:04:14.190> super<00:04:14.430> tight<00:04:14.640> from<00:04:14.879> the<00:04:15.000> from<00:04:15.660> the

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
muscles super tight from the from the

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:17.779 
muscles super tight from the from the
rib<00:04:15.930> cage<00:04:16.169> rib<00:04:16.500> cage<00:04:16.709> right<00:04:16.949> here<00:04:17.010> the<00:04:17.459> top<00:04:17.639> of

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:17.789 
rib cage rib cage right here the top of

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:20.270 
rib cage rib cage right here the top of
the<00:04:17.850> hips<00:04:18.030> is<00:04:18.269> like<00:04:18.479> right<00:04:18.690> here<00:04:18.989> so<00:04:19.799> then

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
the hips is like right here so then

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.510 
the hips is like right here so then
these<00:04:20.639> muscles<00:04:21.030> are<00:04:21.090> always<00:04:21.419> being<00:04:22.520> twisted

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
these muscles are always being twisted

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.150 
these muscles are always being twisted
and<00:04:24.020> as<00:04:25.020> you<00:04:25.260> know<00:04:25.380> as<00:04:25.530> surface<00:04:25.949> you're

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 
and as you know as surface you're

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:27.770 
and as you know as surface you're
working<00:04:26.729> instead<00:04:27.060> of<00:04:27.360> the<00:04:27.419> flow<00:04:27.570> of<00:04:27.599> the<00:04:27.720> water

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780

the<00:04:28.260> current<00:04:28.860> having<00:04:29.820> to<00:04:29.880> stay<00:04:30.090> up<00:04:30.300> working

00:04:31.219 --> 00:04:31.229 
the current having to stay up working

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:33.560 
the current having to stay up working
out<00:04:31.380> working<00:04:32.310> in<00:04:32.520> every<00:04:32.760> way<00:04:32.880> you<00:04:32.910> can<00:04:33.180> to<00:04:33.389> stay

out working in every way you can to stay
on<00:04:33.690> the<00:04:33.810> board<00:04:34.080> so<00:04:34.200> I<00:04:34.680> have<00:04:35.250> to<00:04:35.370> get<00:04:35.520> the<00:04:35.700> these

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
on the board so I have to get the these

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.390 
on the board so I have to get the these
muscles<00:04:36.750> lengthen<00:04:37.620> because<00:04:38.160> they<00:04:38.250> get

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.400 
muscles lengthen because they get

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:39.770 
muscles lengthen because they get
shorter<00:04:38.789> and<00:04:38.910> tighter<00:04:38.970> shorter<00:04:39.630> and<00:04:39.720> tighter

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:41.930 
and then they get really really

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:43.820 
and then they get really really
irritated<00:04:42.930> because<00:04:42.990> the<00:04:43.200> nerves<00:04:43.410> are<00:04:43.590> being

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830 
irritated because the nerves are being

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:47.540 
irritated because the nerves are being
pinched<00:04:44.190> and<00:04:45.650> again<00:04:46.650> I<00:04:46.919> don't<00:04:47.220> know<00:04:47.280> if<00:04:47.370> anyone
