that oxidative system what's going to

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:31.060 
that oxidative system what's going to
happen<00:04:29.030> is<00:04:29.260> we're<00:04:30.260> going<00:04:30.350> to<00:04:30.410> be<00:04:30.500> very<00:04:30.620> fat<00:04:30.890> but

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:31.070 
happen is we're going to be very fat but

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:33.100 
happen is we're going to be very fat but
we're<00:04:31.220> also<00:04:31.460> going<00:04:31.910> to<00:04:31.970> be<00:04:32.090> breaking<00:04:32.870> down<00:04:32.900> a

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:33.110 
we're also going to be breaking down a

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:37.390 
we're also going to be breaking down a
lot<00:04:33.620> of<00:04:33.860> muscle<00:04:34.310> tissue<00:04:34.840> forearm<00:04:35.840> for<00:04:36.530> ATP<00:04:36.950> and

lot of muscle tissue forearm for ATP and

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.460 
lot of muscle tissue forearm for ATP and
that's<00:04:38.000> not<00:04:38.210> something<00:04:38.419> we<00:04:38.690> want<00:04:38.720> we<00:04:39.080> want<00:04:39.260> to

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:39.470 
that's not something we want we want to

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:41.560 
that's not something we want we want to
maintain<00:04:39.650> all<00:04:40.130> the<00:04:40.310> muscle<00:04:40.610> we<00:04:40.700> have<00:04:40.910> so

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:41.570 
maintain all the muscle we have so

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:44.770 
maintain all the muscle we have so
that's<00:04:42.229> number<00:04:42.650> one<00:04:43.070> why<00:04:43.760> I<00:04:43.789> like<00:04:44.270> doing<00:04:44.510> more

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:44.780 
that's number one why I like doing more

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:47.920 
that's number one why I like doing more
metabolic<00:04:45.080> conditioning<00:04:45.740> so<00:04:46.070> do<00:04:47.030> not<00:04:47.270> do<00:04:47.570> any

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:47.930 
metabolic conditioning so do not do any

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:51.279 
metabolic conditioning so do not do any

of the stationary bike number 14 for

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:53.440 
of the stationary bike number 14 for
that<00:04:51.530> fact<00:04:51.770> number<00:04:52.130> two<00:04:52.460> that's<00:04:53.090> going<00:04:53.300> to<00:04:53.360> get

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:53.450 
that fact number two that's going to get

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:55.060 
that fact number two that's going to get
your<00:04:53.660> hip<00:04:53.840> flexors<00:04:53.960> pretty<00:04:54.500> tight<00:04:54.710> which<00:04:54.889> we

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:55.070 
your hip flexors pretty tight which we

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:58.240 
your hip flexors pretty tight which we
don't<00:04:55.190> want<00:04:55.460> it<00:04:55.580> any<00:04:55.729> power<00:04:55.970> sport<00:04:56.360> um<00:04:56.830> I<00:04:57.830> would

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:58.250 
don't want it any power sport um I would

00:04:58.250 --> 00:04:59.600 
don't want it any power sport um I would
say<00:04:58.610> if<00:04:58.760> you<00:04:58.789> do<00:04:59.060> want<00:04:59.270> to<00:04:59.300> use

00:04:59.600 --> 00:04:59.610 
say if you do want to use

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:01.580 
say if you do want to use
concept<00:05:00.120> two<00:05:00.270> rower<00:05:00.300> that's<00:05:00.870> great<00:05:01.259> you<00:05:01.530> know

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:01.590 
concept two rower that's great you know

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:03.439 
concept two rower that's great you know
for<00:05:01.949> forgetting<00:05:02.340> the<00:05:02.430> blood<00:05:02.610> flowing<00:05:02.879> before

00:05:03.439 --> 00:05:03.449 
for forgetting the blood flowing before

00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:05.570 
for forgetting the blood flowing before
you<00:05:03.659> do<00:05:03.840> your<00:05:03.870> dynamic<00:05:04.409> warmup<00:05:04.830> and<00:05:05.129> also

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:05.580 
you do your dynamic warmup and also

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:07.700 
you do your dynamic warmup and also
treadmill<00:05:06.090> I<00:05:06.330> can<00:05:06.870> think<00:05:07.020> of<00:05:07.139> a<00:05:07.199> thousand

00:05:12.439 --> 00:05:12.449 
on a treadmill all right so of all those

first probably 10 pounds when I'm diving
down<00:05:39.770> from<00:05:39.979> my<00:05:40.129> metamorphosis<00:05:40.490> is<00:05:41.120> really

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:41.840 
down from my metamorphosis is really

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:44.050 
down from my metamorphosis is really
easy<00:05:42.080> to<00:05:42.349> lose<00:05:42.560> all<00:05:43.039> right<00:05:43.280> with<00:05:43.819> that<00:05:43.849> a

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:44.060 
easy to lose all right with that a

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:45.610 
easy to lose all right with that a
couple<00:05:44.539> weeks<00:05:44.719> I'm<00:05:44.990> going<00:05:45.110> to<00:05:45.199> get<00:05:45.349> pretty

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:45.620 
couple weeks I'm going to get pretty

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:47.980 
couple weeks I'm going to get pretty
