00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
out of the fuse form technology fuse

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.339 
out of the fuse form technology fuse
form<00:00:25.619> technology<00:00:26.250> for<00:00:26.460> us<00:00:26.580> is<00:00:26.789> a<00:00:26.820> very<00:00:27.349> unique

form technology for us is a very unique

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.950 
form technology for us is a very unique
way<00:00:28.650> to<00:00:28.680> integrate<00:00:29.670> two<00:00:30.539> different

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
way to integrate two different

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.420 
way to integrate two different
properties<00:00:31.560> into<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:32.820> same<00:00:33.120> piece<00:00:33.690> of<00:00:33.719> fabric

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:34.430 
properties into the same piece of fabric

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.420 
properties into the same piece of fabric
without<00:00:35.430> actually<00:00:36.149> cutting<00:00:36.899> and<00:00:37.469> suing

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
without actually cutting and suing

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.299 
without actually cutting and suing
assembling<00:00:39.210> pieces<00:00:39.510> together<00:00:39.989> so<00:00:40.950> you<00:00:41.010> can

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
assembling pieces together so you can

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.970 
assembling pieces together so you can
see<00:00:41.550> here<00:00:42.059> on<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.600> jacket<00:00:43.050> and<00:00:43.290> on<00:00:43.559> the<00:00:43.710> front

so basically this part here on the

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.650 
so basically this part here on the
shoulders<00:01:06.470> creates<00:01:07.340> a<00:01:07.610> way<00:01:07.850> more<00:01:08.090> abrasion

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:08.660 
shoulders creates a way more abrasion

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:11.560 
shoulders creates a way more abrasion
resistant<00:01:09.260> zone<00:01:09.620> compared<00:01:10.520> to<00:01:10.760> the<00:01:11.390> lower

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
resistant zone compared to the lower

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:13.660 
resistant zone compared to the lower
part<00:01:11.990> of<00:01:12.110> the<00:01:12.260> body<00:01:12.410> which<00:01:12.710> is<00:01:12.950> lighter

part of the body which is lighter
weights<00:01:14.060> a<00:01:14.360> bit<00:01:14.510> more<00:01:14.720> softer<00:01:15.260> hand<00:01:15.560> fill<00:01:15.830> and

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:16.370 
weights a bit more softer hand fill and

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:19.540 
weights a bit more softer hand fill and
this<00:01:16.580> is<00:01:16.790> achieved<00:01:16.970> without<00:01:17.750> any<00:01:18.380> seams<00:01:19.160> and

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:19.550
