well<00:00:01.020> let's<00:00:01.199> look<00:00:01.350> at<00:00:01.530> the<00:00:01.800> anatomy<00:00:02.129> our<00:00:02.580> back

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:02.790 
well let's look at the anatomy our back

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.150 
well let's look at the anatomy our back
now<00:00:03.030> now<00:00:03.210> the<00:00:03.300> back<00:00:03.600> is<00:00:03.840> the<00:00:04.259> central<00:00:04.859> part<00:00:05.100> of

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:05.160 
now now the back is the central part of

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:06.800 
now now the back is the central part of
our<00:00:05.279> body<00:00:05.549> and<00:00:05.730> if<00:00:05.879> this<00:00:06.029> is<00:00:06.180> not<00:00:06.359> working

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810 
our body and if this is not working

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:07.280 
our body and if this is not working
right

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
right

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:08.839 
right
it<00:00:07.529> creates<00:00:07.890> issues<00:00:08.040> for<00:00:08.490> all<00:00:08.639> our

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
it creates issues for all our

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.390 
it creates issues for all our
extremities<00:00:09.210> so<00:00:10.050> let's<00:00:10.920> have<00:00:11.070> a<00:00:11.130> look<00:00:11.250> at

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
extremities so let's have a look at

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.209 
extremities so let's have a look at
basil<00:00:11.790> here<00:00:11.940> basil<00:00:12.660> the<00:00:12.750> back<00:00:12.929> this<00:00:13.889> is<00:00:13.950> what

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
basil here basil the back this is what

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.519 
basil here basil the back this is what
we<00:00:14.610> would<00:00:14.820> look<00:00:15.000> like<00:00:15.269> if<00:00:15.509> we<00:00:15.540> were<00:00:15.690> scum<00:00:16.260> or

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
we would look like if we were scum or

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:17.450 
we would look like if we were scum or
degloved

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
degloved

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.540 
degloved

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
lump in the back of your neck then we go

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.700 
lump in the back of your neck then we go
to<00:00:34.739> our<00:00:35.070> thoracic<00:00:35.780> vertebra<00:00:36.780> and<00:00:37.110> there<00:00:37.290> is<00:00:37.410> t1

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
to our thoracic vertebra and there is t1

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.660 
to our thoracic vertebra and there is t1
being<00:00:38.460> Rasik<00:00:39.149> 1<00:00:39.329> through<00:00:39.899> 2<00:00:40.020> to<00:00:40.230> 12<00:00:40.649> and<00:00:41.010> then

being Rasik 1 through 2 to 12 and then

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.049 
being Rasik 1 through 2 to 12 and then
we<00:00:41.790> have<00:00:42.000> 5<00:00:42.690> lumber<00:00:43.530> vertebra<00:00:43.860> that<00:00:44.040> is<00:00:44.160> l1<00:00:44.460> 2

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
we have 5 lumber vertebra that is l1 2

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.330 
we have 5 lumber vertebra that is l1 2
or<00:00:45.239> 5<00:00:45.570> which<00:00:46.140> end<00:00:46.379> down<00:00:46.469> here<00:00:46.770> and<00:00:46.950> then<00:00:47.309> we

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
or 5 which end down here and then we

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.910 
or 5 which end down here and then we
work<00:00:47.550> our<00:00:47.730> way<00:00:47.969> into<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:49.140> sacrum<00:00:49.710> and<00:00:49.829> the

create this amazing bit of human
machinery<00:01:00.239> so<00:01:00.960> what<00:01:01.109> we've<00:01:01.230> got<00:01:01.410> here<00:01:01.620> we've

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
machinery so what we've got here we've

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.950 
machinery so what we've got here we've
got<00:01:01.920> these<00:01:02.100> bony<00:01:02.430> vertebra<00:01:03.120> these<00:01:03.600> bodies

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
got these bony vertebra these bodies

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.280 
got these bony vertebra these bodies
better<00:01:04.140> play<00:01:04.470> a<00:01:04.710> number<00:01:04.979> of<00:01:05.220> roles<00:01:05.990> first<00:01:06.990> of

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
better play a number of roles first of

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.140 
better play a number of roles first of
course<00:01:07.530> it<00:01:07.979> keeps<00:01:08.189> your<00:01:08.430> head<00:01:08.610> from<00:01:08.790> your<00:01:08.850> bump

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
course it keeps your head from your bump

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.880 
course it keeps your head from your bump
so<00:01:09.450> it<00:01:09.540> gives<00:01:09.780> you<00:01:09.900> structure<00:01:10.260> and<00:01:10.560> gives<00:01:10.770> you

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
so it gives you structure and gives you

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.880 
so it gives you structure and gives you
shape<00:01:11.479> these<00:01:12.479> wings<00:01:12.930> out<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.439> back<00:01:13.619> these

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
shape these wings out the back these

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.570 
shape these wings out the back these

to see here but you can see these yellow

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.270 
to see here but you can see these yellow
nerves<00:01:27.180> coming<00:01:27.570> out<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.780> side<00:01:28.020> most<00:01:28.680> vertebra

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
nerves coming out the side most vertebra

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.950 
nerves coming out the side most vertebra
have<00:01:29.490> a<00:01:29.520> nerve<00:01:29.820> ending<00:01:30.210> that<00:01:30.329> comes<00:01:30.540> out<00:01:30.720> each

have a nerve ending that comes out each

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.679 
have a nerve ending that comes out each
side<00:01:31.320> and<00:01:31.820> those<00:01:32.820> know<00:01:33.090> they<00:01:33.240> need<00:01:33.390> to<00:01:33.479> come

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
side and those know they need to come

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.289 
side and those know they need to come
from<00:01:33.810> your<00:01:33.960> spinal<00:01:34.259> cord<00:01:34.560> now<00:01:35.220> these<00:01:35.820> wings

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
from your spinal cord now these wings

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.020 
from your spinal cord now these wings
form<00:01:36.990> from<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.680> main<00:01:37.950> body<00:01:38.250> as<00:01:38.520> you<00:01:38.640> can<00:01:38.790> see

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
form from the main body as you can see

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.660 
form from the main body as you can see
here<00:01:39.420> and<00:01:39.900> they<00:01:40.619> create<00:01:40.890> these<00:01:41.009> wings<00:01:41.280> out<00:01:41.549> to

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
here and they create these wings out to

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.520 
here and they create these wings out to
the<00:01:41.759> side<00:01:42.000> and<00:01:42.270> they<00:01:42.689> create<00:01:42.960> a<00:01:42.990> hole<00:01:43.320> behind

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
the side and they create a hole behind

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.530 
the side and they create a hole behind
them<00:01:43.799> or<00:01:43.890> conduit<00:01:44.430> which<00:01:44.939> is<00:01:45.090> your<00:01:45.240> spinal

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
them or conduit which is your spinal

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.389 
them or conduit which is your spinal
canal<00:01:45.960> and<00:01:46.380> that's<00:01:46.530> where<00:01:46.710> your<00:01:46.829> spinal<00:01:47.130> cord

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
canal and that's where your spinal cord

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.389 
canal and that's where your spinal cord
runs<00:01:47.610> all<00:01:47.880> the<00:01:47.909> way<00:01:48.030> through<00:01:48.170> so<00:01:49.170> these<00:01:49.860> bony

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399

spinal cord and the other thing you'll

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.929 
spinal cord and the other thing you'll
notice<00:01:57.600> if<00:01:58.290> you<00:01:58.439> can<00:01:58.560> see<00:01:58.710> quite<00:01:58.979> closely<00:01:59.340> here

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
notice if you can see quite closely here

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.209 
notice if you can see quite closely here
is<00:02:00.299> that<00:02:01.140> when<00:02:01.320> you<00:02:01.350> pull<00:02:01.619> these<00:02:01.740> vertebra

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
is that when you pull these vertebra

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.639 
is that when you pull these vertebra
part<00:02:02.490> there<00:02:03.000> is<00:02:03.030> two<00:02:03.390> joints<00:02:03.899> this<00:02:04.259> vertebra

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
part there is two joints this vertebra

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.119 
part there is two joints this vertebra
here<00:02:04.860> for<00:02:05.070> instance<00:02:05.399> actually<00:02:06.290> joins<00:02:07.290> up<00:02:07.560> with

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
here for instance actually joins up with

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:09.740 
here for instance actually joins up with
these<00:02:08.310> two<00:02:08.610> wings<00:02:08.849> here<00:02:09.149> and<00:02:09.270> creates<00:02:09.539> two

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
these two wings here and creates two

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.600 
these two wings here and creates two
joints<00:02:10.200> then<00:02:10.619> above<00:02:10.950> it<00:02:11.099> here<00:02:11.220> you'll<00:02:11.400> see

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
joints then above it here you'll see

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.040 
joints then above it here you'll see
that<00:02:11.760> these<00:02:11.970> two<00:02:12.239> wings<00:02:12.450> here

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
that these two wings here

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.040 
that these two wings here
attached<00:02:13.680> up<00:02:13.860> to<00:02:14.010> the<00:02:14.100> vertebra<00:02:14.520> above<00:02:15.090> it<00:02:15.240> so

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
attached up to the vertebra above it so

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.680 
attached up to the vertebra above it so
what<00:02:16.260> you<00:02:16.290> have<00:02:16.650> most<00:02:16.980> vertebra<00:02:17.610> have<00:02:18.120> a<00:02:18.300> joint

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
what you have most vertebra have a joint

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.050 
what you have most vertebra have a joint
with<00:02:19.080> two<00:02:19.290> joints<00:02:19.680> above<00:02:19.830> and<00:02:20.280> below<00:02:20.520> now

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
with two joints above and below now

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.360 
with two joints above and below now
their<00:02:21.300> job<00:02:21.600> is<00:02:21.780> basically<00:02:22.050> to<00:02:22.560> stop<00:02:23.220> your

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
their job is basically to stop your

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.250 
their job is basically to stop your
bending<00:02:23.760> back<00:02:23.940> too<00:02:24.150> far<00:02:24.420> because<00:02:24.870> if<00:02:25.050> you<00:02:25.110> bend

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
bending back too far because if you bend

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:26.930 
bending back too far because if you bend
back<00:02:25.500> too<00:02:25.650> far<00:02:25.890> what<00:02:26.100> they'll<00:02:26.250> actually<00:02:26.460> do<00:02:26.790> is

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
back too far what they'll actually do is

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.370 
back too far what they'll actually do is
they'll<00:02:27.090> actually<00:02:27.270> lock<00:02:27.690> up<00:02:27.900> and<00:02:28.110> stop<00:02:28.290> you

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
they'll actually lock up and stop you

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:29.960 
they'll actually lock up and stop you
from<00:02:28.410> going<00:02:28.650> too<00:02:28.770> far<00:02:28.800> back<00:02:29.190> what<00:02:29.730> they<00:02:29.820> also

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
from going too far back what they also

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.670 
from going too far back what they also
do<00:02:30.240> is<00:02:30.270> when<00:02:30.480> you<00:02:30.570> turn<00:02:30.870> too<00:02:31.170> far

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
do is when you turn too far

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.800 
do is when you turn too far
they<00:02:32.100> basically<00:02:32.400> jam<00:02:33.180> up<00:02:33.390> and<00:02:33.510> put<00:02:33.660> pressure

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
they basically jam up and put pressure

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.020 
they basically jam up and put pressure
through<00:02:34.170> other<00:02:34.320> parts<00:02:34.740> of<00:02:34.800> your<00:02:34.950> back<00:02:35.130> so

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
through other parts of your back so

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.890 
through other parts of your back so
that's<00:02:36.270> the<00:02:36.510> job<00:02:36.780> of<00:02:36.990> the<00:02:37.410> vertebra<00:02:38.900> okay

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
that's the job of the vertebra okay

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.290 
that's the job of the vertebra okay
let's<00:02:40.110> talk<00:02:40.320> about<00:02:40.380> discs<00:02:41.250> now<00:02:41.460> now<00:02:41.670> discs<00:02:42.120> are

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
let's talk about discs now now discs are

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.900 
let's talk about discs now now discs are
those<00:02:42.540> sort<00:02:43.200> of<00:02:43.320> marshmellow<00:02:44.010> type<00:02:44.490> objects

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
those sort of marshmellow type objects

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.690 
those sort of marshmellow type objects
between<00:02:45.090> the<00:02:45.630> vertebra<00:02:46.080> now<00:02:46.830> they<00:02:47.220> have<00:02:47.430> some

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
between the vertebra now they have some

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.790 
between the vertebra now they have some
pretty<00:02:47.940> unique<00:02:48.180> qualities<00:02:48.900> I<00:02:49.110> guess<00:02:49.650> the

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
pretty unique qualities I guess the

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.050 
pretty unique qualities I guess the
first<00:02:50.010> thing<00:02:50.280> we<00:02:50.400> should<00:02:50.550> understand<00:02:51.000> about

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
first thing we should understand about

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.780 
first thing we should understand about
discs<00:02:51.600> are<00:02:51.750> that<00:02:52.260> discs<00:02:52.680> have<00:02:53.070> a<00:02:53.130> pretty<00:02:53.550> poor

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
discs are that discs have a pretty poor

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.150 
discs are that discs have a pretty poor
blood<00:02:54.120> supply<00:02:54.330> and<00:02:54.810> that<00:02:55.260> means<00:02:55.500> if<00:02:55.800> we<00:02:55.950> damage

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
blood supply and that means if we damage

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.590 
blood supply and that means if we damage
a<00:02:56.370> disc<00:02:56.670> they<00:02:56.910> don't<00:02:57.090> really<00:02:57.210> repair

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
a disc they don't really repair

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.860 
a disc they don't really repair
themselves<00:02:57.780> very<00:02:58.350> well<00:02:58.380> if<00:02:59.070> at<00:02:59.340> all<00:02:59.660> the<00:03:00.660> next

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
themselves very well if at all the next

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.390 
themselves very well if at all the next
thing<00:03:00.990> we<00:03:01.050> have<00:03:01.170> to<00:03:01.290> realize<00:03:01.410> about<00:03:01.710> this<00:03:02.070> are

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
thing we have to realize about this are

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.900 
thing we have to realize about this are
that<00:03:02.850> they<00:03:03.060> are<00:03:03.090> squashing<00:03:03.900> I<00:03:04.080> guess<00:03:04.470> the<00:03:04.650> best

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
that they are squashing I guess the best

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:07.610 
that they are squashing I guess the best
analogy<00:03:05.910> for<00:03:06.570> discs<00:03:06.810> is<00:03:06.990> if<00:03:07.140> you've<00:03:07.290> got<00:03:07.320> some

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
analogy for discs is if you've got some

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.100 
analogy for discs is if you've got some
silicon<00:03:08.190> you<00:03:08.490> squirt<00:03:08.820> it<00:03:08.940> on<00:03:09.030> a<00:03:09.060> table<00:03:09.540> into<00:03:10.080> a

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
silicon you squirt it on a table into a

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.140 
silicon you squirt it on a table into a
round<00:03:10.380> disc<00:03:10.680> about<00:03:10.830> this<00:03:11.190> big<00:03:11.400> came<00:03:11.940> back

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
round disc about this big came back

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:13.880 
round disc about this big came back
tomorrow<00:03:12.510> peeled<00:03:13.170> off<00:03:13.350> the<00:03:13.470> table<00:03:13.800> and

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
tomorrow peeled off the table and

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:15.740 
tomorrow peeled off the table and
started<00:03:14.220> squeezing<00:03:14.460> it<00:03:14.820> that's<00:03:15.330> what<00:03:15.570> they

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
started squeezing it that's what they

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.600 
started squeezing it that's what they
would<00:03:15.930> feel<00:03:16.200> like<00:03:16.410> it's<00:03:16.920> sort<00:03:17.100> of<00:03:17.130> dry<00:03:17.340> on<00:03:17.489> the

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
would feel like it's sort of dry on the

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:19.310 
would feel like it's sort of dry on the
outside<00:03:17.970> but<00:03:18.150> they<00:03:18.270> still<00:03:18.510> squishy<00:03:18.870> up<00:03:19.080> a<00:03:19.200> bit

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
outside but they still squishy up a bit

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.470 
outside but they still squishy up a bit
and<00:03:19.560> in<00:03:19.860> the<00:03:19.950> middle<00:03:20.250> there's<00:03:20.610> a<00:03:20.730> servicios

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
and in the middle there's a servicios

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.500 
and in the middle there's a servicios
material<00:03:22.200> I<00:03:22.489> guess<00:03:23.489> the<00:03:23.670> thing<00:03:23.910> we<00:03:24.120> have<00:03:24.360> to

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
material I guess the thing we have to

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.150 
material I guess the thing we have to
remember<00:03:24.660> about<00:03:24.810> discs<00:03:25.320> are<00:03:25.470> that<00:03:26.010> we've

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
remember about discs are that we've

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.280 
remember about discs are that we've
either<00:03:26.340> evolved<00:03:27.120> from<00:03:27.300> four<00:03:27.690> legs<00:03:27.930> up<00:03:28.110> of<00:03:28.200> the

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
either evolved from four legs up of the

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:31.370 
either evolved from four legs up of the
two<00:03:28.500> legs<00:03:28.770> we've<00:03:29.430> been<00:03:29.610> created<00:03:30.290> depends<00:03:31.290> on

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
two legs we've been created depends on

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:34.880 
two legs we've been created depends on
your<00:03:31.500> theories<00:03:31.920> on<00:03:32.130> the<00:03:32.790> two<00:03:33.000> legs<00:03:33.330> where<00:03:34.050> we

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
your theories on the two legs where we

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:36.530 
your theories on the two legs where we
have<00:03:35.040> gravity<00:03:35.459> pushing<00:03:36.030> us<00:03:36.120> into<00:03:36.270> the<00:03:36.390> ground

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
have gravity pushing us into the ground

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.490 
have gravity pushing us into the ground
so<00:03:37.050> discs<00:03:37.530> have<00:03:37.709> evolved<00:03:38.370> being<00:03:39.000> able<00:03:39.150> to<00:03:39.500> cope

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
so discs have evolved being able to cope

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.949 
so discs have evolved being able to cope
with<00:03:40.560> pressures<00:03:41.220> straight<00:03:41.489> up<00:03:41.670> and<00:03:41.850> down<00:03:42.060> the

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
with pressures straight up and down the

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:44.990 
with pressures straight up and down the
problem<00:03:43.410> comes<00:03:43.709> when<00:03:44.250> we<00:03:44.489> start<00:03:44.760> putting

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
problem comes when we start putting

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.030 
problem comes when we start putting
uneven<00:03:45.570> pressure<00:03:45.780> on<00:03:45.989> those<00:03:46.140> discs<00:03:46.380> so<00:03:46.830> rather

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
uneven pressure on those discs so rather

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.160 
uneven pressure on those discs so rather
than<00:03:47.130> having<00:03:47.340> squash<00:03:47.850> like<00:03:48.120> this<00:03:48.420> we<00:03:48.930> start

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.170 
than having squash like this we start

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:52.100 
than having squash like this we start
tilting<00:03:49.470> like<00:03:49.830> this<00:03:50.130> or<00:03:50.640> like<00:03:51.000> this<00:03:51.060> we<00:03:51.780> bend

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.110 
tilting like this or like this we bend

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:54.199 
tilting like this or like this we bend
the<00:03:52.200> wrong<00:03:52.440> way<00:03:52.620> forward<00:03:53.040> or<00:03:53.160> back<00:03:53.430> now<00:03:54.120> the

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
the wrong way forward or back now the

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:56.449 
the wrong way forward or back now the
issue<00:03:54.540> of<00:03:54.780> that<00:03:54.870> of<00:03:54.989> course<00:03:55.170> is<00:03:55.470> the<00:03:55.680> problem

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
issue of that of course is the problem

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:57.890 
issue of that of course is the problem
with<00:03:56.610> discs<00:03:57.000> or<00:03:57.150> something<00:03:57.420> that<00:03:57.510> people<00:03:57.660> just

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
with discs or something that people just

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.560 
with discs or something that people just
don't<00:03:58.050> realize<00:03:58.560> is<00:03:58.830> that<00:03:59.010> there's<00:03:59.459> no<00:03:59.670> nerve

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:00.570 
don't realize is that there's no nerve

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:03.080 
don't realize is that there's no nerve
system<00:04:01.170> that<00:04:01.830> goes<00:04:02.010> back<00:04:02.280> to<00:04:02.430> our<00:04:02.459> brain<00:04:02.880> to

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
system that goes back to our brain to

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.420 
system that goes back to our brain to
say<00:04:03.270> stop<00:04:03.630> doing<00:04:03.989> that<00:04:04.140> you're<00:04:04.620> putting<00:04:04.920> huge

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
say stop doing that you're putting huge

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.250 
say stop doing that you're putting huge
loads<00:04:05.760> through<00:04:05.970> that<00:04:06.150> disc<00:04:06.390> and<00:04:06.660> you're<00:04:07.080> going

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
loads through that disc and you're going

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:08.780 
loads through that disc and you're going
to<00:04:07.320> harm<00:04:07.560> me<00:04:07.739> eventually<00:04:08.010> if<00:04:08.340> not<00:04:08.550> then

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
to harm me eventually if not then

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.580 
to harm me eventually if not then
perhaps<00:04:09.209> later<00:04:09.600> on<00:04:09.690> is<00:04:09.840> that<00:04:09.870> bit<00:04:10.200> that<00:04:10.380> load

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
perhaps later on is that bit that load

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:12.979 
perhaps later on is that bit that load
builds<00:04:10.980> up<00:04:11.130> that's<00:04:12.090> why<00:04:12.300> when<00:04:12.420> we<00:04:12.540> say<00:04:12.750> we<00:04:12.959> want

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:12.989 
builds up that's why when we say we want

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:14.449 
builds up that's why when we say we want
you<00:04:13.230> to<00:04:13.320> be<00:04:13.470> in<00:04:13.530> the<00:04:13.650> maintain<00:04:14.100> certain

you to be in the maintain certain

to feel a whole lot different initially

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.130 
to feel a whole lot different initially
it's<00:04:17.640> because<00:04:18.269> it's<00:04:18.450> going<00:04:18.570> to<00:04:18.660> stop<00:04:18.930> the

way but they hate this and the reason I
