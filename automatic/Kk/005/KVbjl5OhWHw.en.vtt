 chain I find you today for 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:34.200
 a review monster high 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:40.150

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:43.120

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:45.600
 storaÃ¯ and one a drawing that the 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.600
 represent 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:55.809
 here we have a photo and there a hole for 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:58.870
 to be able to try then we can see at 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:01:01.269
 through the box here a ground she 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:02.890
 passed through 

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:07.210
 here we have small holes to be able to 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:09.240
 hear him here his name shining with 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:13.060
 simple game if a text 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:16.720
 if the side with francky claudine and 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:19.750
 spectra a drawing the back of the box 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:22.450
 with always the storai monsters logo 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:24.790
 fantastic an extract from the cartoon 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:27.610
 spectra vanderkaay activates the function of 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:31.240
 your character mister hype referee 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:33.940
 wants to review his drawing here here we 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:38.380
 inspect will light up and loved ones are 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:41.950
 ghostly we find spectra cloud 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:45.850
 in and francky I will now open 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:48.070
 the way so I opened the box you 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.110
 show how nice we are 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:52.630
 so she goes through 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:55.270
 you did a nice presentation so 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:57.130
 we have the base here so I'll remove 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:00.370
 the doll and the lot and I'll get it to you 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:03.909
 present so here spectrum before our 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:05.679
 gas goodlife pay 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:07.749
 I wanted to present it at the same time 

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:10.420
 as basic to show you the 

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:12.910
 differences there are not many by 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:15.060
 report to clarin and francky this is where 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:19.629
 the one that looks the most that the most 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:23.590
 respected I started with his face to 

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:29.620
 the blue purple makeup height of the 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:34.590
 eyes a purple lipstick so that's 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.590
 identical to asia 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:51.340
 then at the level of his hair they 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:53.610
 are purple is long raid with two 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.610
 tone 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:59.750
 which are almost the same compared to the 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.750
 basic 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.150
 now I've gone to loops 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:14.069
 there is a difference 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:17.370
 so here we have a ball that is black except 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:20.010
 that chain and black here the ball is 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:22.459
 well black but here the chain and crisis 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:25.080
 so it's different 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:28.319
 then the head of the basic and soft 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:34.170
 but also go hard we sent some 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:37.819
 mutations like his electro differently 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:37.819
 one of the most brilliant game 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.460
 then I went through his necklace 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:51.800
 it's silver chains normally 

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:54.640
 and they are exactly the same in 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.640
 the app is different 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:04:01.310
 so regarding his garment 

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:04.400
 it's almost identical so we have a 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:08.209
 black purple silver dress with 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:10.310
 braces so it's almost the same except 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:15.200
 here than at the chains there they 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:17.930
 are well fabric of the three oaks here 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:20.120
 we really have small chains in 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:23.110
 metal so we see it maybe not the 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:27.290
 camera but there it is really more 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:30.640
 fignole what the original and better the 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:33.800
 material here and a little leather effect 

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:36.220
 while vermand cdu of the fabric so 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:39.260
 less good 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:39.560
 then the belt is almost the 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:44.540
 even 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:47.180
 so with donkeys today so we have 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:53.000
 tulle then see the same dress 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:56.570
 the Caribbean cedh except that below 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:59.540
 there are silvery patterns like 

00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:02.600
 chains while on the basic had 

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:06.250
 nothing so we'll say that the lago that 

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:06.250
 did a little better on that side 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:14.590
 so I 'm going to talk to you about boots 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:18.370
 they are really identical 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:18.370
 as you can see 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:26.639
 still so beautiful so that's where he 

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:28.630
 did not change because I love them 

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:33.750
 we may see a difference 

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:33.750
 between the two at the color level 

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:39.889
 I do not know if I see you at the 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:41.300
 camera it's true especially dark 

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:44.629
 if I'm going to talk to you a little about the 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:47.509
 doll then the arms are articulated 

00:05:44.629 --> 00:05:48.759
 like that can not bend them as 

00:05:47.509 --> 00:05:51.379
 the basic 

00:05:48.759 --> 00:05:55.129
 then the handles are not at all 

00:05:51.379 --> 00:05:57.460
 articulated because of the mechanism of the 

00:05:55.129 --> 00:05:57.460
 light 

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:07.150
 here are the legs is the same 

00:06:03.919 --> 00:06:07.150
 we can not bend them 

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:21.750
 the juice stop but turned on sledge in the footsteps 

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:21.750
 too much I'm afraid of breaking it 

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:29.169
 then the base is of course different 

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:31.810
 represents a skull it is very beautiful game 

00:06:29.169 --> 00:06:36.940
 love it so we can think of the 

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:45.510
 lift like crazy to operate it 

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:50.560
 in support on the belly so there is a sound 

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:51.510
 and lights in the arms and 

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:56.410
 legs 

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:58.180
 I will show you in the dark then 

00:06:56.410 --> 00:07:03.100
 same month in the dark we show you 

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:06.090
 and spectra so it lights up well 

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:06.090
 I really like 

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:13.690
 pity the face is not writing 

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:16.930
 a little bit too much but it's already 

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:19.630
 well so that's for my review of 

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:23.729
 spectra before gas 2 age I you 

00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:23.729
 see you soon on my chain hi
