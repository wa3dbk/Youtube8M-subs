growth<00:05:28.270> aids<00:05:28.710> but<00:05:29.710> I<00:05:30.010> think<00:05:30.490> with<00:05:30.880> the

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:31.240 
growth aids but I think with the

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:34.920 
growth aids but I think with the
reduction<00:05:31.930> of<00:05:32.110> shedding<00:05:33.070> and<00:05:33.690> sticking<00:05:34.690> with

reduction of shedding and sticking with

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:37.560 
reduction of shedding and sticking with
a<00:05:35.139> routine<00:05:35.620> which<00:05:35.860> is<00:05:36.039> now<00:05:36.220> a<00:05:36.250> routine<00:05:36.940> like

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:37.570 
a routine which is now a routine like

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:41.399 
a routine which is now a routine like
every<00:05:38.139> day<00:05:38.409> as<00:05:38.740> opposed<00:05:39.190> to<00:05:39.430> every<00:05:39.820> week<00:05:40.409> it's

00:05:41.399 --> 00:05:41.409 
every day as opposed to every week it's

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:43.260 
every day as opposed to every week it's
really<00:05:41.650> making<00:05:41.919> my<00:05:42.220> hair<00:05:42.490> thrive<00:05:42.849> and<00:05:43.180> I
