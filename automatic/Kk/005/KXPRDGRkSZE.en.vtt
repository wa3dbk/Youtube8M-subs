00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.430
 so 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:12.959
 whatever 

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:20.199
 heavy dies 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:22.240
 hello, friends, I'm daisy and they're 

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:25.390
 I bring a recipe that I'm sure that 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:28.300
 you're going to love hot spicy soup 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:30.310
 typical Chinese good recipe let's go to 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.070
 to put with it the ingredients for 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:34.500
 this dish are 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:38.100
 two eggs of which only 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:42.809
 we will use the whites an onion a 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:45.660
 bamboo carrot can be buds or 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:48.449
 branches as I will use in this case 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:51.199
 some Chinese mushrooms that in this case are 

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:54.660
 quote that but you can use the one you want 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:57.030
 pork about 150 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:00.300
 grams we can also use meat from 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:03.180
 chicken bean sprouts a handful a piece 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:07.790
 of tofu chicken broth approximately 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:11.090
 a liter soy sauce rice vinegar 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:14.420
 two tablespoons cornstarch and spicy 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:17.870
 in this case I will use cayenne also 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:19.640
 we will use a little pepper salt and 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:21.060
 a splash of virgin olive oil 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.210
 extra 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:28.159
 well then let's start first we have to 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.159
 chop all the ingredients in small pieces 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.640
 and now we put the casserole on medium heat 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:41.510
 we will add a dash of oil 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.510
 extra virgin olive 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:49.320
 I'm sorry original china evidently 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.880
 olive oil is not used but I 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:56.270
 I add because it gives a different touch 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.270
 very tasty we add the onions 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:03.869
 and the carrot 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:14.120
 stir well and when you are a little 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.120
 golden add the chicken broth 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.879
 we add it and we keep stirring 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.670
 and now we add the mushrooms 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:46.189
 you do not see everything is in squares 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:46.189
 we remove a little 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:51.000
 we also add bamboo 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.310
 there all 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.310
 we remove 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:04.730
 and the cayena I'm going to open them and I'm going 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:07.489
 to throw only the seeds for then not 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:10.390
 find me the pieces of the cayenne and 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:10.390
 that apply a lot 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:19.330
 you see it like that only the nuggets 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:22.210
 and we do it with all of you 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:24.670
 to your liking if you like more spicy 

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:27.300
 you get more and you like less spicy 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:27.300
 well less 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:35.079
 we see how it starts to boil and in about 10 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:37.500
 minutes approximately the soup will be 

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:37.500
 list 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:44.670
 now we put with the eggs 

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:48.049
 we separate the white from the yolks and we 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:48.049
 we will be left alone with the whites 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:03.020
 well, now we have two more good 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:05.569
 clear now we beat them and 

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:08.050
 We will reserve to give the final touch to 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:08.050
 Soup 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:13.110
 Well, well, it's worth it, we reserve it 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:18.079
 Now we take the cornstarch and put it in 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:22.030
 a bowl 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:25.740
 we will mix it with half a glass of water 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:28.530
 and we'll pour it into the soup so it thickens 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:33.410
 we mix everything very well that they do not remain 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:33.410
 lumps is very important and it is already 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:40.450
 well guys now five minutes before 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:45.720
 to finish the soup we will add the rest 

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:45.720
 ingredients that are tofu 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:51.869
 we add everything 

00:04:48.689 --> 00:04:54.149
 all in cubes and we remove it so that 

00:04:51.869 --> 00:04:59.169
 do not stay stuck we will also add 

00:04:54.149 --> 00:05:03.009
 the pork also in cubes 

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:05.499
 and we remove everything 

00:05:03.009 --> 00:05:09.180
 and now we will add the two soybeans 

00:05:05.499 --> 00:05:09.180
 tablespoons 

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:18.320
 we put a pinch of salt 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:18.320
 also a pinch of pepper 

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:27.470
 we remove 

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:27.470
 and now we try to see how it is 

00:05:31.529 --> 00:05:36.750
 delicious 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:39.720
 if you see that it is not good of state of 

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:42.009
 pepper or spicy because I already add 

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:44.680
 to your liking 

00:05:42.009 --> 00:05:46.749
 now we will add the cornstarch mixture 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:50.669
 with the water in the soup and let's go 

00:05:46.749 --> 00:05:50.669
 stirring little by little 

00:05:55.289 --> 00:06:04.660
 you're going to see how this is thickening 

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:04.660
 Notice how the soup is already expressing 

00:06:05.169 --> 00:06:12.930
 now we will add the bean sprouts 

00:06:07.599 --> 00:06:12.930
 in the end because this is done very fast 

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:16.840
 we see it 

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:25.060
 we will add as a final touch the clear 

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:26.950
 egg with the soup boiling little by little 

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:30.790
 that the soup is boiling is very 

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:33.550
 important we keep casting little by little 

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:36.870
 and we see how it solidifies in the 

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:36.870
 soup well 

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:45.590
 and we have the soup ready only 

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:49.370
 it remains to be plated and eaten 

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:51.860
 we already have the soup plated ready for 

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:53.900
 enjoy and do not see how good it smells 

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:57.350
