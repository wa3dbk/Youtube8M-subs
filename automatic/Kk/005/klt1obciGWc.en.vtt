00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
as well get the what's it called the

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.940 
as well get the what's it called the
completion<00:04:11.880> escape<00:04:12.120> and<00:04:12.870> you<00:04:13.109> know<00:04:13.230> it's<00:04:13.859> a

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:13.950 
completion escape and you know it's a

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:16.340 
completion escape and you know it's a
good<00:04:14.130> way<00:04:14.310> to<00:04:14.340> for<00:04:14.850> lower<00:04:15.569> level<00:04:15.900> players<00:04:16.139> to

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.350 
good way to for lower level players to

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:18.170 
good way to for lower level players to
show<00:04:16.560> they<00:04:16.739> have<00:04:16.769> max<00:04:17.130> in<00:04:17.430> all<00:04:17.579> skills<00:04:17.820> and<00:04:18.120> I

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
show they have max in all skills and I

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.599 
show they have max in all skills and I
do<00:04:18.570> think<00:04:18.900> that<00:04:18.959> will<00:04:19.200> kind<00:04:19.410> of<00:04:19.470> useful<00:04:19.620> for

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
do think that will kind of useful for

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:22.460 
do think that will kind of useful for
scalars<00:04:21.000> and<00:04:21.209> lower<00:04:21.359> level<00:04:22.019> players<00:04:22.229> who<00:04:22.409> are

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
scalars and lower level players who are

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.930 
scalars and lower level players who are
interested<00:04:23.070> in<00:04:23.300> skills<00:04:24.300> instead<00:04:24.630> of<00:04:24.750> combat

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:25.940 
interested in skills instead of combat

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:27.820 
interested in skills instead of combat
most<00:04:26.690> people<00:04:27.140> would<00:04:27.260> said<00:04:27.440> that<00:04:27.590> this<00:04:27.680> is

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830 
most people would said that this is

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:30.370 
most people would said that this is
about<00:04:28.070> it<00:04:28.280> there<00:04:28.490> and<00:04:28.670> I<00:04:29.570> can<00:04:29.840> understand

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:30.380 
about it there and I can understand

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:32.020 
about it there and I can understand
where<00:04:30.530> they're<00:04:30.650> coming<00:04:30.680> from<00:04:30.980> it<00:04:31.460> may<00:04:31.970> be

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.030 
where they're coming from it may be

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:35.320 
where they're coming from it may be
because<00:04:32.770> that<00:04:33.770> it's<00:04:34.370> not<00:04:34.550> necessarily<00:04:35.150> needed

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
because that it's not necessarily needed

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:36.880 
because that it's not necessarily needed
or<00:04:35.630> because<00:04:35.900> it's<00:04:36.110> a<00:04:36.170> lot<00:04:36.290> of<00:04:36.410> capes<00:04:36.620> in<00:04:36.770> the

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:36.890 
or because it's a lot of capes in the

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:38.770 
or because it's a lot of capes in the
game<00:04:37.070> or<00:04:37.340> things<00:04:38.060> like<00:04:38.300> this<00:04:38.510> but<00:04:38.750> I

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:38.780 
game or things like this but I

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:41.260 
game or things like this but I
personally<00:04:39.260> I<00:04:39.470> think<00:04:39.530> that<00:04:39.770> it<00:04:40.460> gives<00:04:40.940> players

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:41.270 
personally I think that it gives players

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:44.320 
personally I think that it gives players
a<00:04:41.750> chance<00:04:42.080> to<00:04:42.460> customize<00:04:43.460> their<00:04:43.850> account<00:04:44.180> a

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:44.330 
a chance to customize their account a

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:45.520 
a chance to customize their account a
lot<00:04:44.480> better<00:04:44.690> and<00:04:44.900> kind<00:04:45.050> of<00:04:45.080> show<00:04:45.260> off<00:04:45.290> their

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:45.530 
lot better and kind of show off their

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:48.190 
lot better and kind of show off their
achievements<00:04:46.070> because<00:04:47.110> achievements<00:04:48.110> you

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:48.200 
achievements because achievements you

achievements because achievements you
know<00:04:48.350> even<00:04:48.890> though<00:04:48.980> it's<00:04:49.130> not<00:04:49.190> like<00:04:49.340> not<00:04:49.520> in<00:04:49.670> a

off as well and I do kind of think that
is<00:05:08.330> a<00:05:08.540> usable<00:05:09.230> idea<00:05:09.500> small<00:05:09.830> with<00:05:10.070> the<00:05:10.540> 5%<00:05:11.540> bonus

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:11.900 
is a usable idea small with the 5% bonus

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:14.200 
is a usable idea small with the 5% bonus
experience<00:05:12.280> idea<00:05:13.280> because<00:05:13.760> that<00:05:13.970> would<00:05:14.090> kind

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:14.210 
experience idea because that would kind

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:16.270 
experience idea because that would kind
of<00:05:14.240> make<00:05:14.960> people<00:05:15.350> wear<00:05:15.470> this<00:05:15.620> capes<00:05:15.920> Agana

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:16.280 
of make people wear this capes Agana

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:18.640 
of make people wear this capes Agana
give<00:05:16.880> a<00:05:16.910> reason<00:05:17.330> to<00:05:17.930> go<00:05:18.110> for<00:05:18.320> them<00:05:18.410> especially

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:18.650 
give a reason to go for them especially

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:21.100 
give a reason to go for them especially
if<00:05:19.100> they're<00:05:19.250> going<00:05:19.280> for<00:05:19.730> 200<00:05:20.660> million<00:05:20.810> some

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:21.110 
if they're going for 200 million some

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:22.900 
if they're going for 200 million some
kind<00:05:21.350> of<00:05:21.440> skill<00:05:21.650> you<00:05:21.770> know<00:05:21.920> that<00:05:22.460> would<00:05:22.640> mean

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:22.910 
kind of skill you know that would mean

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:25.060 
kind of skill you know that would mean
it's<00:05:23.210> a<00:05:23.420> lot<00:05:23.540> easier<00:05:23.780> to<00:05:24.080> get<00:05:24.380> these<00:05:24.590> skills<00:05:24.950> to

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:25.070 
it's a lot easier to get these skills to

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:27.130 
it's a lot easier to get these skills to
know<00:05:25.190> bogus<00:05:25.460> 5%<00:05:26.150> it's<00:05:26.330> not<00:05:26.540> that<00:05:26.720> much<00:05:26.900> more

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:27.140 
know bogus 5% it's not that much more

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:28.780 
know bogus 5% it's not that much more
experienced<00:05:27.740> and<00:05:27.890> it<00:05:27.980> wouldn't<00:05:28.130> really<00:05:28.280> count

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:28.790 
experienced and it wouldn't really count

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:30.910 
experienced and it wouldn't really count
that<00:05:28.880> much<00:05:29.150> but<00:05:29.360> it<00:05:29.450> will<00:05:29.810> add<00:05:29.990> up<00:05:30.260> eventually

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:30.920 
that much but it will add up eventually

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:33.010 
that much but it will add up eventually
and<00:05:31.130> people<00:05:31.460> were<00:05:31.550> there<00:05:31.760> for<00:05:31.790> go<00:05:32.630> for<00:05:32.660> it<00:05:32.870> and

and people were there for go for it and

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:34.510 
and people were there for go for it and

skills<00:05:34.790> and<00:05:35.060> of<00:05:35.630> course<00:05:35.900> you<00:05:36.020> know<00:05:36.140> there<00:05:36.320> are

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:36.470 
skills and of course you know there are

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:38.350 
skills and of course you know there are
a<00:05:36.500> lot<00:05:36.650> of<00:05:36.830> capes<00:05:37.280> in<00:05:37.520> this<00:05:37.730> game<00:05:38.000> but<00:05:38.270> that

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:38.360 
a lot of capes in this game but that

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:40.480 
a lot of capes in this game but that
doesn't<00:05:38.840> mean<00:05:38.960> that<00:05:38.990> we<00:05:39.830> can't<00:05:40.070> have<00:05:40.220> more<00:05:40.400> you

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:40.490 
doesn't mean that we can't have more you

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:41.940 
doesn't mean that we can't have more you
know<00:05:40.610> I<00:05:40.940> said<00:05:41.150> I<00:05:41.180> think<00:05:41.300> I<00:05:41.510> mentioned<00:05:41.690> that

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:41.950 
know I said I think I mentioned that

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:44.230 
know I said I think I mentioned that
that<00:05:42.950> we<00:05:43.100> it<00:05:43.370> kind<00:05:43.520> of<00:05:43.550> gives<00:05:43.760> the<00:05:43.910> chance<00:05:44.120> to

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:44.240 
that we it kind of gives the chance to

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:46.060 
that we it kind of gives the chance to
customize<00:05:44.419> your<00:05:44.780> character<00:05:44.840> more<00:05:45.290> and<00:05:45.860> to

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:46.070 
customize your character more and to

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:47.770 
customize your character more and to
what<00:05:46.220> we<00:05:46.310> wanted<00:05:46.610> to<00:05:46.730> be<00:05:46.880> and<00:05:47.120> what<00:05:47.300> we<00:05:47.450> want<00:05:47.570> to

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:47.780 
what we wanted to be and what we want to

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:49.240 
what we wanted to be and what we want to
look<00:05:47.930> like<00:05:48.140> and<00:05:48.320> stuff<00:05:48.470> and<00:05:48.680> if<00:05:48.860> the<00:05:49.010> capes

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:49.250 
look like and stuff and if the capes

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:50.950 
look like and stuff and if the capes
looks<00:05:49.520> good<00:05:49.760> people<00:05:50.090> wear<00:05:50.390> it<00:05:50.510> anyways<00:05:50.810> you

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:50.960 
looks good people wear it anyways you

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:52.570 
looks good people wear it anyways you
know<00:05:50.990> so<00:05:51.290> it's<00:05:51.440> kind<00:05:51.860> of<00:05:51.890> a<00:05:52.010> win-win<00:05:52.190> kind<00:05:52.520> of

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:52.580 
know so it's kind of a win-win kind of

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:54.159 
know so it's kind of a win-win kind of
thing<00:05:52.700> I<00:05:52.790> believe<00:05:52.910> then<00:05:53.660> if<00:05:53.780> you<00:05:53.870> don't<00:05:54.020> like

00:05:54.159 --> 00:05:54.169 
thing I believe then if you don't like

00:05:54.169 --> 00:05:55.900 
thing I believe then if you don't like
you<00:05:54.290> don't<00:05:54.320> have<00:05:54.650> to<00:05:54.770> wear<00:05:54.919> it<00:05:55.070> I<00:05:55.130> guess

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:55.910 
you don't have to wear it I guess

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:58.420 
you don't have to wear it I guess
as<00:05:56.390> for<00:05:56.600> the<00:05:56.750> emotes<00:05:57.110> do<00:05:57.590> we<00:05:57.710> need<00:05:57.860> a<00:05:57.890> most<00:05:58.220> for

00:05:58.420 --> 00:05:58.430 
as for the emotes do we need a most for

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:00.310 
as for the emotes do we need a most for
them<00:05:58.550> I<00:05:58.640> I<00:05:58.669> don't<00:05:58.970> really<00:05:59.090> know<00:05:59.270> every<00:06:00.110> there's

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:00.320 
them I I don't really know every there's

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:02.620 
them I I don't really know every there's
emotes<00:06:00.800> if<00:06:01.130> you<00:06:01.220> need<00:06:01.370> it<00:06:01.490> for<00:06:01.610> capes<00:06:01.910> like

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:02.630 
emotes if you need it for capes like

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:04.090 
emotes if you need it for capes like
that<00:06:02.870> you<00:06:02.990> know<00:06:03.110> it<00:06:03.230> kind<00:06:03.380> of<00:06:03.410> just<00:06:03.680> a<00:06:03.770> show<00:06:03.919> of

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:04.100 
that you know it kind of just a show of

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:06.550 
that you know it kind of just a show of
cape<00:06:04.280> or<00:06:04.490> if<00:06:04.700> it<00:06:04.790> looks<00:06:04.820> good<00:06:05.060> you<00:06:05.270> can<00:06:05.440> wear<00:06:06.440> it

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:06.560 
cape or if it looks good you can wear it

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:08.409 
cape or if it looks good you can wear it
I<00:06:06.620> guess<00:06:06.800> yeah<00:06:07.010> and<00:06:07.220> it's<00:06:07.400> pretty<00:06:07.760> decent

00:06:08.409 --> 00:06:08.419 
I guess yeah and it's pretty decent

00:06:08.419 --> 00:06:11.260 
I guess yeah and it's pretty decent
in<00:06:08.810> my<00:06:08.990> opinion<00:06:09.400> and<00:06:10.400> of<00:06:10.550> course<00:06:10.760> you<00:06:10.910> know<00:06:11.030> it

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:11.270 
in my opinion and of course you know it

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:13.360 
in my opinion and of course you know it
not<00:06:11.540> necessarily<00:06:12.169> need<00:06:12.440> it<00:06:12.470> in<00:06:12.770> the<00:06:12.919> game<00:06:13.130> but

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:13.370 
not necessarily need it in the game but

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:14.800 
not necessarily need it in the game but
then<00:06:13.550> again<00:06:13.669> we<00:06:13.880> have<00:06:14.060> a<00:06:14.090> lot<00:06:14.240> of<00:06:14.390> items<00:06:14.540> who

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:14.810 
then again we have a lot of items who

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:18.490 
then again we have a lot of items who
don't<00:06:15.080> really<00:06:15.470> need<00:06:15.590> take<00:06:16.220> for<00:06:16.400> example<00:06:16.430> my<00:06:17.500> my

it's<00:06:33.740> a<00:06:33.830> good<00:06:33.979> idea<00:06:34.160> and<00:06:34.460> I<00:06:35.090> think<00:06:35.330> it's

00:06:35.469 --> 00:06:35.479 
it's a good idea and I think it's

00:06:35.479 --> 00:06:37.750 
it's a good idea and I think it's
something<00:06:35.960> that<00:06:36.140> could<00:06:36.530> be<00:06:36.740> done<00:06:36.890> but<00:06:37.460> at<00:06:37.640> the

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:37.760 
something that could be done but at the

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:39.040 
something that could be done but at the
same<00:06:37.910> time<00:06:38.120> I<00:06:38.180> don't<00:06:38.479> really<00:06:38.600> think<00:06:38.690> it<00:06:38.960> will

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:39.050 
same time I don't really think it will

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:39.730 
same time I don't really think it will
be<00:06:39.229> implemented

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:39.740 
be implemented

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:41.680 
be implemented
anytime<00:06:40.100> soon<00:06:40.520> but<00:06:40.940> I<00:06:40.970> thought<00:06:41.330> it<00:06:41.450> would<00:06:41.540> be

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:41.690 
anytime soon but I thought it would be

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:44.050 
anytime soon but I thought it would be
pretty<00:06:42.320> much<00:06:42.410> okay<00:06:42.890> there<00:06:43.520> to<00:06:43.700> get<00:06:43.790> it<00:06:43.940> out

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:44.060 
pretty much okay there to get it out

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:46.660 
pretty much okay there to get it out
there<00:06:44.240> and<00:06:44.690> let<00:06:44.780> you<00:06:44.990> guys<00:06:45.200> give<00:06:46.070> your<00:06:46.220> opinion
