thumbs down and I'll tell you why what
we're<00:00:29.689> doing<00:00:29.900> is<00:00:30.050> we're<00:00:30.199> paying<00:00:30.470> more<00:00:30.769> for

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:30.800

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:34.790 
less education and from my experience if

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:36.100 
less education and from my experience if
you're<00:00:34.880> paying<00:00:35.060> more<00:00:35.270> you<00:00:35.510> should<00:00:35.570> get<00:00:35.900> more

and I've heard students say like oh it's

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:41.500 
and I've heard students say like oh it's
great<00:00:39.380> because<00:00:39.650> we<00:00:39.770> get<00:00:39.980> extra<00:00:40.280> days<00:00:40.430> off<00:00:40.670> but

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:41.510 
great because we get extra days off but

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:43.450 
great because we get extra days off but
I<00:00:41.570> mean<00:00:41.810> like<00:00:42.020> who's<00:00:42.890> flipping<00:00:43.190> the<00:00:43.310> bill

that much time in class anyways and

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.600 
that much time in class anyways and
losing<00:00:54.020> more<00:00:54.200> is<00:00:54.350> not<00:00:54.560> the<00:00:54.680> answer<00:00:54.800> today<00:00:55.580> I

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:55.610 
losing more is not the answer today I

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.080

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.240 
days it's I go back and forth screen
like<00:01:02.360> I<00:01:02.420> think<00:01:02.660> it's<00:01:02.930> like<00:01:03.170> obviously<00:01:03.440> there's

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.250 
like I think it's like obviously there's

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:05.859 
like I think it's like obviously there's
not<00:01:04.430> much<00:01:04.670> else<00:01:04.850> you<00:01:04.970> can<00:01:05.059> really<00:01:05.269> do<00:01:05.479> to<00:01:05.509> help

00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:05.869 
not much else you can really do to help

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:07.899 
not much else you can really do to help
with<00:01:06.110> budget<00:01:06.409> cuts<00:01:06.590> but<00:01:07.400> it's<00:01:07.549> kinda<00:01:07.790> nice

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:07.909 
with budget cuts but it's kinda nice

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:10.510 
with budget cuts but it's kinda nice
like<00:01:08.509> in<00:01:08.630> a<00:01:08.689> way<00:01:08.840> because<00:01:09.350> and<00:01:09.890> we<00:01:09.950> like<00:01:10.249> have<00:01:10.460> a

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 
like in a way because and we like have a

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.880 
like in a way because and we like have a
break<00:01:10.820> from<00:01:11.060> class<00:01:11.329> already<00:01:11.689> and<00:01:12.649> it's<00:01:12.770> only

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890 
break from class already and it's only

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.160 
break from class already and it's only
like<00:01:13.219> nine<00:01:13.460> days<00:01:13.640> out<00:01:13.789> of<00:01:13.820> the<00:01:13.939> year<00:01:14.179> um<00:01:14.869> I

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
like nine days out of the year um I

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:16.620 
like nine days out of the year um I
think<00:01:15.229> furloughs<00:01:15.859> are<00:01:15.890> kind<00:01:16.159> of<00:01:16.249> ridiculous

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:16.630 
think furloughs are kind of ridiculous

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.450 
think furloughs are kind of ridiculous
because<00:01:17.630> we're<00:01:18.259> getting<00:01:18.499> less<00:01:18.679> class<00:01:19.070> time

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460 
because we're getting less class time

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.690 
because we're getting less class time
and<00:01:19.850> so<00:01:20.600> we<00:01:20.960> were<00:01:21.920> paying<00:01:22.159> twenty<00:01:22.490> percent

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
and so we were paying twenty percent

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.669 
and so we were paying twenty percent
more<00:01:23.119> to<00:01:23.359> come<00:01:23.509> here<00:01:23.539> to<00:01:23.780> chico<00:01:24.020> state<00:01:24.229> but

00:01:24.669 --> 00:01:24.679 
more to come here to chico state but

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:27.010 
more to come here to chico state but
we're<00:01:24.829> getting<00:01:24.979> ten<00:01:25.249> percent<00:01:25.640> less<00:01:25.880> and<00:01:26.270> i

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
we're getting ten percent less and i

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:28.359 
we're getting ten percent less and i
think<00:01:27.200> it's<00:01:27.319> kind<00:01:27.469> of<00:01:27.499> ridiculous<00:01:27.679> in<00:01:28.130> a<00:01:28.189> way<00:01:28.310> i

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:28.369 
think it's kind of ridiculous in a way i

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:29.770 
think it's kind of ridiculous in a way i
mean<00:01:28.700> i<00:01:28.729> understand<00:01:29.030> like<00:01:29.240> the<00:01:29.359> economy<00:01:29.719> in

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
mean i understand like the economy in

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.889 
mean i understand like the economy in
the<00:01:29.840> way<00:01:29.929> things<00:01:29.990> are<00:01:30.289> going<00:01:30.319> I<00:01:31.689> think<00:01:32.689> the

00:01:32.889 --> 00:01:32.899 
the way things are going I think the

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:34.539 
the way things are going I think the
furloughs<00:01:33.229> they<00:01:33.439> need<00:01:33.619> to<00:01:33.710> be<00:01:33.890> set<00:01:34.340> up<00:01:34.369> a

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:34.549 
furloughs they need to be set up a

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:36.609 
furloughs they need to be set up a
little<00:01:34.729> bit<00:01:34.819> better<00:01:34.909> well<00:01:35.719> if<00:01:35.960> I<00:01:36.139> had<00:01:36.170> to<00:01:36.530> do

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:36.619 
little bit better well if I had to do

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:38.410 
little bit better well if I had to do
the<00:01:36.740> furloughs<00:01:37.069> what<00:01:37.340> I<00:01:37.369> would<00:01:37.639> do<00:01:37.789> instead<00:01:37.939> is

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
the furloughs what I would do instead is

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.020 
the furloughs what I would do instead is
instead<00:01:39.380> of<00:01:39.439> having<00:01:39.530> six<00:01:40.189> random<00:01:40.670> days<00:01:40.850> that

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
instead of having six random days that

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.029 
instead of having six random days that
the<00:01:41.119> professor's<00:01:41.569> get<00:01:41.719> a<00:01:41.749> pic<00:01:41.990> I<00:01:42.259> think<00:01:42.920> we

00:01:43.029 --> 00:01:43.039 
the professor's get a pic I think we

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:45.069 
the professor's get a pic I think we
should<00:01:43.189> have<00:01:43.340> just<00:01:43.549> nine<00:01:43.880> days<00:01:43.909> flat<00:01:44.539> outset

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:45.079 
should have just nine days flat outset

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:47.050 
should have just nine days flat outset
that<00:01:45.109> are<00:01:45.409> for<00:01:45.590> those<00:01:45.740> days<00:01:45.979> because<00:01:46.939> if

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060 
that are for those days because if

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:48.669 
that are for those days because if
you're<00:01:47.210> going<00:01:47.389> to<00:01:47.479> try<00:01:47.719> and<00:01:47.749> cut<00:01:47.990> costs<00:01:48.229> mazel

00:01:48.669 --> 00:01:48.679 
you're going to try and cut costs mazel

that you know over 12 million dollar

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.480 
that you know over 12 million dollar
expense<00:02:42.810> right<00:02:43.050> there<00:02:43.350> so<00:02:44.040> definitely<00:02:44.220> I

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:44.490 
expense right there so definitely I

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:47.030 
expense right there so definitely I
would<00:02:44.640> look<00:02:44.970> at<00:02:45.180> more<00:02:45.570> of<00:02:45.600> focusing<00:02:46.260> on<00:02:46.440> what's

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
would look at more of focusing on what's

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.340 
would look at more of focusing on what's
best<00:02:47.280> for<00:02:47.520> the<00:02:47.580> student<00:02:48.000> and<00:02:48.150> pooling<00:02:49.110> all<00:02:49.230> the

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
best for the student and pooling all the

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.080 
best for the student and pooling all the
resources<00:02:49.620> into<00:02:50.010> the<00:02:50.100> student<00:02:50.520> definitely

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
resources into the student definitely

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:52.460 
resources into the student definitely
looking<00:02:51.360> at<00:02:51.540> reducing<00:02:51.990> how<00:02:52.140> much<00:02:52.290> we're

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
looking at reducing how much we're

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.230 
looking at reducing how much we're
paying<00:02:52.500> some<00:02:53.070> you<00:02:53.550> know<00:02:53.610> some<00:02:53.670> of<00:02:53.850> the<00:02:54.000> upper

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:54.240 
paying some you know some of the upper

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:55.730 
paying some you know some of the upper
level<00:02:54.510> teachers<00:02:54.720> and<00:02:55.140> the<00:02:55.380> hundreds<00:02:55.680> of

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:55.740 
level teachers and the hundreds of

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:58.040 
level teachers and the hundreds of
thousands<00:02:56.220> of<00:02:56.250> dollars<00:02:56.970> bringing<00:02:57.600> those<00:02:57.750> down

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
thousands of dollars bringing those down

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.229 
thousands of dollars bringing those down
so<00:02:58.350> we<00:02:58.470> have<00:02:58.680> more<00:02:59.370> money<00:02:59.580> to<00:02:59.670> focus<00:03:00.090> on

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
so we have more money to focus on

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:02.180 
so we have more money to focus on
learning<00:03:00.450> more<00:03:01.110> money<00:03:01.320> to<00:03:01.410> focus<00:03:01.770> on<00:03:01.860> what<00:03:02.040> the

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
learning more money to focus on what the

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:13.290 
learning more money to focus on what the
institution<00:03:02.730> is<00:03:02.820> actually<00:03:03.300> about

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:13.300
