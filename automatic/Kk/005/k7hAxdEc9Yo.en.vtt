00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.320
 this second part of the course covers the sampling procedures 

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:08.689
 that includes 

00:00:08.689 --> 00:00:10.929
 the aggregate display 

00:00:10.929 --> 00:00:12.199
 asphalt 

00:00:12.199 --> 00:00:14.829
 and bituminous mixtures 

00:00:14.829 --> 00:00:18.859
 aggregate samples are collected from the cells of the conveyor belts 

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:22.009
 and said of the customers of the gravimetric plant 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:27.660
 to collect samples of aggregates from a hold cell need the mataboi 

00:00:27.659 --> 00:00:30.460
 or tea can metal to avoid segregation 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:32.160
 a sampling paddle 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.200
 and a container to wait for the show 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.820
 for each withdrawal of the show in a pile place the taboa or japan logo 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:41.770
 above the sampling area 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:46.100
 and this will help protect the sample from particles that are believed to be group and roll 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.050
 to the sampling area 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.800
 before taking the sample remove 10 to 15 centimeters of surface material 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.830
 in order to be able to reach the interior of the pile where there is the 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:00.590
 segregation 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:05.860
 so anyway and apathy shows gennari discovery remove the material 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:10.729
 this in the container with care to avoid spilling material 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:16.410
 repeat the procedure at the medium level 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:18.930
 at the top level 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.870
 and on the opposite side 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:23.870
 so that the show represents every stack 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.970
 to do the aggregate display of the conveyor belt 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.929
 most volumetric plants have a mechanical 

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:36.899
 sampling 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:40.120
 kind of straying to the show without stopping the belt 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:44.410
 first check to see if the display device is clean and free of 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:46.150
 any loose material 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:50.290
 only then the device used to divert the belt aggregates 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.320
 the fine particles that tend to adhere to the device are brushed to 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.320
 inside the sample and shows it transferred to the container 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:02.530
 sometimes need to separate the rush to collect the show 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.540
 this occurs when it is necessary to approve the mechanical device 

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:13.189
 to withdraw an aggregate sample from a rush to the pose of separating 

00:02:13.189 --> 00:02:14.840
 from a container for the display 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.840
 a special template 'adjusted to the shape of the conveyor belt 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.590
 the map to the scoop to remove most of the material 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:25.610
 and a brush to revolver the fine particles that they will welcome 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:26.929
 to plan 

00:02:26.929 --> 00:02:31.159
 first make sure that the belt is operating normally with the flow 

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:34.539
 representative of aggregate then stopped for conveyor belt 

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:39.029
 and push the template into the assembly until it is 

00:02:39.029 --> 00:02:39.779
 rush 

00:02:39.779 --> 00:02:43.729
 and remove the material from the template using the spoon to the largest 

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:45.119
 part of the material 

00:02:45.119 --> 00:02:49.479
 and the brush to collect the rest of the material into the template including the 

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:52.249
 fine particles 

00:02:52.249 --> 00:02:56.139
 for the b and you will have samples of the hot silos of the 

00:02:56.139 --> 00:03:00.829
 you will need a special device for the display like this it should have 

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:04.729
 sufficient length to completely interrupt the flow of aggregate to the 

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:07.409
 measure being discharged into the silo 

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:10.760
 first allow some material to pass so that the sample is 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:11.890
 representative 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.940
 then in wire device under the discharge stream remove 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:20.640
 and place it showing the sample container repeat the procedure for each 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:21.749
 hot stamp 

00:03:21.749 --> 00:03:23.930
 putting the show of each one 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.930
 in its own container 

00:03:27.469 --> 00:03:31.000
 now we will see the procedures for the asphalt show 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.170
 in the distributors the sample can be obtained directly from one of the peaks of the 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.009
 distribution bar 

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:41.469
 the circulation pipes of the storage tanks shall be 

00:03:41.469 --> 00:03:44.769
 equipped with the motorneiro to show to this 

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:46.079
 for what will it show 

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:49.730
 you will need gloves to protect your hands from hot asphalt 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:53.500
 an empty container which may contain at least 5 liters of material 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:57.080
 and two 5-liter containers each 

00:03:57.859 --> 00:04:01.449
 cans and battles for asphalt cement and dilute asphalt 

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:10.649
 it may sometimes be necessary to be the sampling tap before using it 

00:04:10.649 --> 00:04:15.269
 remove at least 5 liters of material for the first container and this helps 

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:18.570
 to clean the valve from any contamination and pull more material 

00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:20.749
 representative for the faucet 

00:04:20.749 --> 00:04:24.169
 then the first container to be shown 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:27.009
 and a second resident 

00:04:27.009 --> 00:04:31.150
 this second shows saved as a spare sample 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:35.100
 sally these containers immediately it fills the cards 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:38.100
 betting identification 

00:04:39.319 --> 00:04:44.280
 you should also know how to collect samples of tarmac bituminous mixtures 

00:04:44.279 --> 00:04:45.659
 and on trucks 

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:49.119
 most samples of asphalt concrete the removal of the coating 

00:04:49.119 --> 00:04:51.300
 right behind the paver 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:54.930
 to sample the bituminous mixtures on the track you will need to 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:59.009
 a long metal plate with children the map as last tragic in a 

00:04:59.009 --> 00:05:01.270
 25 liter container 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:04.860
 that is placed in front of the paver's finishing boat. 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:06.150
 crossing the track 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:09.150
 and at least 30 centimeters from the tip of the coating layer 

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:13.219
 the ends are secure while the paver throws mixture over the 

00:05:13.219 --> 00:05:14.110
 plate 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:16.940
 after the hard paving passes beyond the plate 

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:19.309
 the wires are used to locate it 

00:05:19.309 --> 00:05:23.599
 and shows the withdrawal of the center of the sheet with each portion being placed 

00:05:23.599 --> 00:05:26.900
 in the sample container 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:31.190
 the plaque then removed and the place of show restored by hand center 

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:33.860
 fresh mix 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:38.220
 for various asphalt concrete and asphalt concrete for the layer 

00:05:38.219 --> 00:05:41.439
 friction as the samples are removed from the trucks 

00:05:41.439 --> 00:05:45.669
 the sample shall consist of several portions of the mixture obtained from various 

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:47.580
 points within the paddle 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:48.889
 at each point 

00:05:48.889 --> 00:05:51.860
 caught material fire from the surface of the mass 

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:53.969
 to enter inside the load 

00:05:53.969 --> 00:05:58.479
 the panini a spoonful of material and place in the container of the show 

00:06:00.259 --> 00:06:03.030
 for the asphalt concrete of the friction layer 

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:06.690
 the sample must be collected at the plant has everything from five minutes after the 

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:10.700
 loading using a spoonful of sugar and a can to show up of 5 

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:12.719
 liters 

00:06:12.719 --> 00:06:16.419
 In this part of the video we cover the procedures for the 

00:06:16.419 --> 00:06:18.490
 aggregates of cells 

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:21.960
 of a moving conveyor belt using a 

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:23.190
 mechanic shows 

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:26.430
 of a stopped conveyor belt and of the customers' isi 

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:31.720
 We also discussed the procedures for the jean asphalt 

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:33.000
 runway mixes 

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.160
 and the mixing of trucks
