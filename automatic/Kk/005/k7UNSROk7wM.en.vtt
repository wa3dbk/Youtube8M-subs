those are some like really big
influences<00:01:30.420> for<00:01:30.600> us<00:01:30.720> so<00:01:30.899> we<00:01:30.929> fit<00:01:31.170> somewhere<00:01:31.439> in

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
influences for us so we fit somewhere in

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.919 
influences for us so we fit somewhere in
between<00:01:31.619> that<00:01:31.979> I<00:01:32.039> mean<00:01:32.280> asking<00:01:32.659> Jesus<00:01:33.659> what<00:01:33.810> we

00:01:33.919 --> 00:01:33.929 
between that I mean asking Jesus what we

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:36.440 
between that I mean asking Jesus what we
can<00:01:34.079> describe<00:01:34.380> it's<00:01:34.740> very<00:01:34.920> hard<00:01:35.100> but<00:01:35.280> uh<00:01:35.450> you'd

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
can describe it's very hard but uh you'd

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:37.760 
can describe it's very hard but uh you'd
like<00:01:36.630> to<00:01:36.780> think<00:01:36.960> it's<00:01:37.079> a<00:01:37.170> little<00:01:37.289> bit<00:01:37.409> unique

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
like to think it's a little bit unique

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.840 
like to think it's a little bit unique
so<00:01:38.689> yeah<00:01:39.689> yeah<00:01:40.140> and<00:01:40.640> terms<00:01:41.640> of<00:01:41.759> our

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
so yeah yeah and terms of our

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.120 
so yeah yeah and terms of our
progression<00:01:42.350> we<00:01:43.350> I<00:01:43.380> guess<00:01:43.679> we<00:01:43.829> get<00:01:43.979> better

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
progression we I guess we get better

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.410 
progression we I guess we get better
every<00:01:44.340> CD<00:01:45.920> we<00:01:46.920> get<00:01:47.039> an<00:01:47.130> older<00:01:47.310> every<00:01:47.520> CD<00:01:47.759> so<00:01:48.090> we

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
every CD we get an older every CD so we

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.029 
every CD we get an older every CD so we
learn<00:01:48.599> more<00:01:48.630> we<00:01:49.319> get<00:01:49.439> better<00:01:49.590> what<00:01:49.890> we're

00:01:50.029 --> 00:01:50.039 
learn more we get better what we're

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:52.639 
learn more we get better what we're
doing<00:01:50.310> new<00:01:50.909> experiences<00:01:51.450> new<00:01:51.720> experiences

just<00:02:04.190> it<00:02:04.400> was<00:02:04.430> it<00:02:04.760> was<00:02:04.880> we<00:02:05.750> were<00:02:05.840> trying<00:02:06.020> to

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:06.050 
just it was it was we were trying to

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:07.240 
just it was it was we were trying to
think<00:02:06.140> of<00:02:06.290> a<00:02:06.320> cool<00:02:06.590> name<00:02:06.800> something<00:02:07.130> that

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
think of a cool name something that

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.450 
think of a cool name something that
wasn't<00:02:07.490> like<00:02:07.990> you<00:02:08.990> hear<00:02:09.830> everyday<00:02:10.040> kind<00:02:10.310> of

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:10.460 
wasn't like you hear everyday kind of

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:13.260 
wasn't like you hear everyday kind of
think<00:02:10.640> like<00:02:10.700> that<00:02:11.600> Bell<00:02:11.810> bands<00:02:12.020> or<00:02:12.320> not<00:02:12.530> so<00:02:13.130> we

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
think like that Bell bands or not so we

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.210 
think like that Bell bands or not so we
decided<00:02:14.270> to<00:02:14.360> go<00:02:14.510> with<00:02:14.810> a<00:02:15.080> name<00:02:15.920> that's<00:02:16.070> a

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
decided to go with a name that's a

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.220 
decided to go with a name that's a
little<00:02:16.400> bit<00:02:16.490> out<00:02:16.580> there<00:02:16.610> not<00:02:17.360> like<00:02:17.480> that<00:02:17.630> so

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
little bit out there not like that so

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.310 
little bit out there not like that so
that<00:02:18.380> that<00:02:18.560> is<00:02:18.910> it<00:02:19.910> stays<00:02:20.180> this<00:02:20.480> is<00:02:20.660> relative

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:21.320 
that that is it stays this is relative
