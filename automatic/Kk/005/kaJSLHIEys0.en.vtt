00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
side and I'm shaking the gesso and then

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.760 
side and I'm shaking the gesso and then
I<00:00:44.190> thought<00:00:44.430> about<00:00:44.670> it<00:00:44.910> and<00:00:45.600> I<00:00:45.750> was<00:00:45.870> like<00:00:45.989> nah

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
I thought about it and I was like nah

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.490
