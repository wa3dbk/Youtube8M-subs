00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:06.540
 every night without working 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.730
 blessings today we are going to do the 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.100
 oil joy of san tutorial 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.850
 thick frames the first part of the 

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.850
 basic song 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.680
 and 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:37.270
 Sun 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.270
 and 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:45.820
 this song starts on the sun rope 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.820
 and on the number 10 to 12 fret 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:51.080
 after lowering the rope they continue to 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:55.260
 fret number 13 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:57.560
 previous to sun in the junk number 9 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.560
 to 10 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.609
 and your points are like that 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:07.510
 and from there on the same string you go to 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:10.570
 fret 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:14.620
 8 and 7 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:17.909
 today you go down to fret 5 and you go up one 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:22.040
 fret rope 6 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:24.920
 and between fat the sun rope at twelve 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:27.310
 and from there they are based on the same string in 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.310
 the fret 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:31.479
 and together they are like that 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:33.700
 the 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.270
 and 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:45.590
 and hence to say that the same string in 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:49.070
 fret 9 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:55.820
 do not do a string to the bottom 13 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:59.540
 and after 16 15 on the sun rope 15 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:03.130
 on the fret strings 10 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:03.130
 and then the fret 7 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:09.049
 and hopefully 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.049
 and nothing like that 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:20.600
 and from there 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:22.420
 is based on the string only on 3 5 7 and 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:27.290
 8 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:32.720
 and then back on the string like that in the 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:38.020
 fret number 6 and 8 and a string gives me 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:38.020
 to fret 6 and 8 are like that 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:43.120
 and there you are from the rope 10 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:51.640
 eleven 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:51.640
 13 and 15 and together they are like that 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:00.630
 and the notes that accompany the voice go like this 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.630
 they are two 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:06.659
 B flat 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.659
 with the sun sustained 

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:13.460
 after 

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:15.910
 and you end up in sunshine this is the line of 

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:15.910
 trumpets 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:49.650
 that part goes all in the rope me 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:52.650
 start at the number 11 10 and 8 fret 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.650

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:21.400
 and you finish in 15 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:25.610
 and next to each other 

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:31.960
 and 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:31.960
 perfect 

00:04:40.029 --> 00:04:44.700
 at the top when you go up you start at 

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:48.200

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:48.200

 and from 11 to 18 and go up to 13 11 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:12.419

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:20.939
 and on the string on the second string in 

00:05:16.319 --> 00:05:24.490
 the number 16 fret and then 

00:05:20.939 --> 00:05:26.680
 you play 16 on the first string 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:29.460
 and you return to the 16th on the second string 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:29.460
 pulling the 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:32.629
 and next to each other 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:36.310
