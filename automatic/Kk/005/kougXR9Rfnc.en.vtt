g'day folks well the following footage

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:05.420 
g'day folks well the following footage
is<00:00:03.840> actually<00:00:04.350> made<00:00:04.560> before<00:00:04.980> I<00:00:05.009> got<00:00:05.250> this

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
is actually made before I got this

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.290 
is actually made before I got this
engine<00:00:05.819> going<00:00:06.649> I<00:00:07.649> discovered<00:00:08.580> a<00:00:08.670> few<00:00:08.700> little

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
engine going I discovered a few little

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.060 
engine going I discovered a few little
problems<00:00:09.660> with<00:00:09.840> the<00:00:10.019> injection<00:00:10.500> pump<00:00:10.769> it<00:00:10.980> was

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
problems with the injection pump it was

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.730 
problems with the injection pump it was
bit<00:00:11.219> dirty<00:00:11.490> and<00:00:12.650> the<00:00:13.700> piston<00:00:14.700> retainer<00:00:15.740> which

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
bit dirty and the piston retainer which

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.439 
bit dirty and the piston retainer which
is<00:00:16.890> on<00:00:17.010> the<00:00:17.130> inside<00:00:17.460> so<00:00:17.670> the<00:00:17.760> piston<00:00:18.119> sleeve

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
is on the inside so the piston sleeve

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.410 
is on the inside so the piston sleeve
retainer<00:00:19.189> wasn't<00:00:20.189> all<00:00:20.369> that<00:00:20.430> tight<00:00:21.090> so<00:00:21.359> I'm

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
retainer wasn't all that tight so I'm

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.390 
retainer wasn't all that tight so I'm
guessing<00:00:21.689> it<00:00:21.779> was<00:00:21.869> leaking<00:00:22.199> a<00:00:22.260> bit<00:00:22.380> inside

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:25.400 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.700 

yeah<00:00:26.400> so<00:00:26.670> obviously<00:00:27.090> after<00:00:27.439> cleaning<00:00:28.439> it<00:00:28.590> and

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
yeah so obviously after cleaning it and

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.429 
yeah so obviously after cleaning it and
reconditioning<00:00:29.369> it<00:00:29.519> and<00:00:30.019> just<00:00:31.019> going<00:00:31.199> for

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
reconditioning it and just going for

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.020 
reconditioning it and just going for
broke<00:00:31.650> and<00:00:31.800> cranking<00:00:32.219> the<00:00:32.340> nuts<00:00:32.550> off<00:00:32.759> it<00:00:32.910> with

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
broke and cranking the nuts off it with

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.549 
broke and cranking the nuts off it with
a<00:00:33.059> little<00:00:33.329> bit<00:00:33.510> of<00:00:33.660> engine<00:00:33.960> oil<00:00:34.079> down<00:00:34.410> the

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
a little bit of engine oil down the

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.670 
a little bit of engine oil down the
intake<00:00:34.920> it<00:00:35.850> decided<00:00:36.300> to<00:00:36.360> fire<00:00:36.540> up<00:00:36.870> like<00:00:37.559> it<00:00:37.649> was

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
intake it decided to fire up like it was

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.229 
intake it decided to fire up like it was
a<00:00:37.800> bit<00:00:37.920> rough<00:00:38.070> at<00:00:38.250> first<00:00:38.550> I<00:00:38.760> didn't<00:00:38.969> get<00:00:39.120> that

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
a bit rough at first I didn't get that

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.040 
a bit rough at first I didn't get that
on<00:00:39.420> film<00:00:40.340> but<00:00:41.340> after<00:00:41.910> doing<00:00:42.149> that<00:00:42.480> and<00:00:42.780> got<00:00:43.020> a

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
on film but after doing that and got a

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.380 
on film but after doing that and got a
little<00:00:43.290> bit<00:00:43.379> of<00:00:43.469> heat<00:00:43.649> into<00:00:43.950> it<00:00:44.100> and<00:00:45.090> I<00:00:45.149> grabbed

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
little bit of heat into it and I grabbed

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.299 
little bit of heat into it and I grabbed
the<00:00:45.510> camera<00:00:45.690> and<00:00:46.020> fired<00:00:46.379> away<00:00:46.500> and<00:00:46.829> of<00:00:47.070> course

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
the camera and fired away and of course

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.779 
the camera and fired away and of course
it<00:00:47.430> worked<00:00:47.610> again<00:00:48.289> so<00:00:49.289> as<00:00:50.100> you<00:00:50.280> can<00:00:50.370> see<00:00:50.610> I've

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
it worked again so as you can see I've

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.880 
it worked again so as you can see I've
come<00:00:50.940> a<00:00:50.969> bit<00:00:51.149> further<00:00:51.510> I've<00:00:51.840> cleaned<00:00:52.379> up<00:00:52.649> a<00:00:52.680> bit

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
come a bit further I've cleaned up a bit

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.130 
come a bit further I've cleaned up a bit
more<00:00:53.100> giving<00:00:53.789> it<00:00:53.879> a<00:00:53.940> spray<00:00:54.270> I've<00:00:54.899> got<00:00:55.050> the

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
more giving it a spray I've got the

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.750 
more giving it a spray I've got the
governor<00:00:55.500> connected<00:00:55.949> to<00:00:56.160> a<00:00:56.190> point<00:00:56.489> where<00:00:56.670> it

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
governor connected to a point where it

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:57.200 
governor connected to a point where it
works

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
works

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.170 
works
I<00:00:57.360> have<00:00:57.780> run<00:00:57.960> it<00:00:58.109> a<00:00:58.199> few<00:00:58.230> times<00:00:58.590> after<00:00:58.859> that<00:00:59.250> not

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
I have run it a few times after that not

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.349 
I have run it a few times after that not
too<00:01:00.420> much<00:01:00.629> though<00:01:01.160> I'm<00:01:02.160> just<00:01:02.370> cleaning<00:01:03.120> other

too much though I'm just cleaning other

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:04.759 
too much though I'm just cleaning other
parts<00:01:03.719> and<00:01:03.840> you're<00:01:03.930> like<00:01:04.049> troll<00:01:04.260> assist<00:01:04.530> tank

assembly that comes off here for dual
alternators<00:01:13.110> and<00:01:14.990> yet<00:01:15.990> it's<00:01:16.470> just<00:01:16.530> painted

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
alternators and yet it's just painted

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.580 
alternators and yet it's just painted
I've<00:01:17.220> changed<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:17.790> oil<00:01:17.820> in<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:18.590> reduction

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
I've changed the oil in the reduction

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.640 
I've changed the oil in the reduction
drive<00:01:20.070> or<00:01:20.490> propeller<00:01:20.939> drive<00:01:21.240> unit<00:01:21.630> that<00:01:22.500> was

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
drive or propeller drive unit that was

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.030 
drive or propeller drive unit that was
rather<00:01:22.830> milky<00:01:23.340> and<00:01:23.369> nasty<00:01:24.409> so<00:01:25.409> changed<00:01:25.890> all

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
rather milky and nasty so changed all

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.999 
rather milky and nasty so changed all
that<00:01:26.070> out<00:01:26.369> it's<00:01:26.670> all<00:01:26.909> good<00:01:27.150> and<00:01:27.680> ready<00:01:28.680> to<00:01:28.770> go

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
but here the following is injection pump

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.330 
but here the following is injection pump
disassembly<00:01:33.329> and<00:01:33.360> inspection<00:01:34.200> so<00:01:34.829> I<00:01:34.860> hope<00:01:35.220> you

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
disassembly and inspection so I hope you

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.870 
disassembly and inspection so I hope you
enjoy<00:01:35.670> it<00:01:36.049> okay<00:01:37.049> folks<00:01:37.470> I'm<00:01:38.430> just<00:01:38.640> messing

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
enjoy it okay folks I'm just messing

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.120 
enjoy it okay folks I'm just messing
around<00:01:38.939> with<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.299> an<00:01:39.479> Myers<00:01:39.780> diesel<00:01:40.770> system

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
around with the an Myers diesel system

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.060 
around with the an Myers diesel system
again<00:01:41.430> and<00:01:41.990> then<00:01:42.990> I'm<00:01:43.320> pretty<00:01:43.590> sure<00:01:43.860> there's<00:01:44.040> a

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
again and then I'm pretty sure there's a

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.499 
again and then I'm pretty sure there's a
problem<00:01:44.310> with<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.610> injection<00:01:45.090> system

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
problem with the injection system

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:46.969 
problem with the injection system
because<00:01:45.689> it<00:01:45.780> seems<00:01:45.990> to<00:01:46.110> be<00:01:46.170> either<00:01:46.380> full<00:01:46.740> bore

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
because it seems to be either full bore

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.819 
because it seems to be either full bore
or<00:01:47.220> nothing<00:01:47.869> and<00:01:48.869> I've<00:01:49.049> tried<00:01:49.350> it<00:01:49.530> on<00:01:49.619> another

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
or nothing and I've tried it on another

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.859 
or nothing and I've tried it on another
injector<00:01:50.520> which<00:01:50.850> is<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.119> same<00:01:51.360> as<00:01:51.509> what<00:01:51.630> I<00:01:51.659> put

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
injector which is the same as what I put

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.249 
injector which is the same as what I put
on<00:01:51.899> the<00:01:52.049> Chinese<00:01:52.470> diesel<00:01:53.009> and<00:01:53.509> I<00:01:54.509> get<00:01:54.990> the<00:01:55.110> same

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
on the Chinese diesel and I get the same

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:56.030 
on the Chinese diesel and I get the same
result

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
result

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.980 
result
one<00:01:56.640> big<00:01:57.060> squirt<00:01:57.570> when<00:01:59.420> the<00:02:00.420> governor<00:02:00.899> is

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
one big squirt when the governor is

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.340 
one big squirt when the governor is
fully<00:02:01.229> shut<00:02:01.560> and<00:02:02.630> absolutely<00:02:03.630> nothing<00:02:04.110> in<00:02:04.229> any

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
fully shut and absolutely nothing in any

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.789 
fully shut and absolutely nothing in any
other<00:02:04.530> position<00:02:05.869> like<00:02:06.869> it<00:02:06.990> is<00:02:07.079> pumping<00:02:07.619> that's

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
other position like it is pumping that's

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.169 
other position like it is pumping that's
the<00:02:07.920> thing<00:02:08.160> if<00:02:08.280> it<00:02:08.369> was<00:02:08.459> leaking<00:02:08.879> it<00:02:08.970> wouldn't

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
the thing if it was leaking it wouldn't

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.790 
the thing if it was leaking it wouldn't
be<00:02:09.239> doing<00:02:09.450> anything

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
be doing anything

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.710 
be doing anything
but<00:02:11.190> so<00:02:11.400> if<00:02:11.490> I<00:02:11.580> close<00:02:11.850> the<00:02:12.030> governor<00:02:12.390> screw

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
but so if I close the governor screw

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:18.440 
but so if I close the governor screw
hard<00:02:15.320> it<00:02:16.320> does<00:02:16.560> put<00:02:16.800> out<00:02:16.830> pressure<00:02:17.210> it's<00:02:18.210> a<00:02:18.330> bit

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
hard it does put out pressure it's a bit

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:19.970 
hard it does put out pressure it's a bit
hard<00:02:18.630> one-handed<00:02:19.260> but<00:02:19.410> I'll<00:02:19.500> set<00:02:19.710> the<00:02:19.830> camera

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
hard one-handed but I'll set the camera

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.100 
hard one-handed but I'll set the camera
up<00:02:20.250> and<00:02:20.400> demonstrate<00:02:20.970> it<00:02:21.150> but<00:02:21.750> this<00:02:21.840> pump<00:02:22.080> is

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
up and demonstrate it but this pump is

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:23.780 
up and demonstrate it but this pump is
incredibly<00:02:22.680> simple<00:02:23.130> there's<00:02:23.280> really<00:02:23.430> nothing

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
incredibly simple there's really nothing

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:24.320 
incredibly simple there's really nothing
to<00:02:24.000> it

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
to it

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.540 
to it
and<00:02:24.560> as<00:02:25.560> the<00:02:25.650> other<00:02:25.680> part<00:02:25.980> of<00:02:26.040> this<00:02:26.130> video<00:02:26.370> I'll

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
and as the other part of this video I'll

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.650 
and as the other part of this video I'll
pull<00:02:26.730> it<00:02:26.760> to<00:02:26.940> bits<00:02:27.120> in<00:02:27.330> it<00:02:27.480> and<00:02:27.660> show<00:02:27.960> it<00:02:29.660> try

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
pull it to bits in it and show it try

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.980 
pull it to bits in it and show it try
not<00:02:30.690> to<00:02:30.870> drop<00:02:31.140> that<00:02:31.320> pinched<00:02:31.740> piston<00:02:32.190> there

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:32.990 
not to drop that pinched piston there

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:36.260 
not to drop that pinched piston there
and<00:02:33.990> it's<00:02:34.860> under<00:02:35.130> a<00:02:35.160> couple<00:02:35.310> psi<00:02:35.910> from<00:02:36.150> the

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
and it's under a couple psi from the

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:40.360 
and it's under a couple psi from the
fuel<00:02:36.510> pump<00:02:36.780> so<00:02:37.020> it's<00:02:37.140> trying<00:02:37.350> to<00:02:37.410> come<00:02:37.530> out<00:02:37.560> now

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:47.750 

damn<00:02:41.370> it

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:57.030 

okay

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.949 

with<00:02:57.520> that<00:02:57.670> back<00:02:57.879> together<00:02:58.060> again<00:02:58.629> with<00:02:58.810> that

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
with that back together again with that

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:02.009 
with that back together again with that
the<00:02:59.890> governor<00:03:00.310> screw<00:03:00.730> pushes<00:03:01.300> down<00:03:01.480> on<00:03:01.540> little

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:02.019 
the governor screw pushes down on little

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:04.800 
the governor screw pushes down on little
needle<00:03:02.470> and<00:03:03.220> forces<00:03:03.670> it<00:03:03.790> down<00:03:03.940> on<00:03:04.090> a<00:03:04.180> seat<00:03:04.510> so

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
needle and forces it down on a seat so

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.559 
needle and forces it down on a seat so
the<00:03:05.110> fuel<00:03:05.709> can't<00:03:06.310> bypass<00:03:06.610> back<00:03:07.180> to<00:03:07.360> the<00:03:07.450> low

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:07.569 
the fuel can't bypass back to the low

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:13.339 
the fuel can't bypass back to the low
pressure<00:03:07.780> side<00:03:08.019> I<00:03:09.390> push<00:03:10.390> on<00:03:10.540> the<00:03:10.720> spring<00:03:11.110> now

00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:13.349 
pressure side I push on the spring now

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:18.900 
pressure side I push on the spring now
it<00:03:14.349> works<00:03:16.140> till<00:03:17.140> I<00:03:17.170> get<00:03:17.319> air<00:03:17.440> in<00:03:17.590> it<00:03:17.709> again<00:03:17.920> home

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
it works till I get air in it again home

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:24.300 
it works till I get air in it again home
blood<00:03:19.180> the<00:03:19.330> system<00:03:19.660> very<00:03:19.840> well<00:03:22.799> okay<00:03:23.799> or<00:03:24.099> if<00:03:24.220> it

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 
blood the system very well okay or if it

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:25.710 
blood the system very well okay or if it
moves<00:03:24.549> a<00:03:24.670> fraction<00:03:25.120> like<00:03:25.239> that<00:03:25.390> have<00:03:25.510> moved

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
moves a fraction like that have moved

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.039 
moves a fraction like that have moved
off<00:03:25.930> tiny<00:03:26.260> little<00:03:26.650> turns<00:03:27.780> and<00:03:28.780> get<00:03:28.930> absolutely

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:29.049 
off tiny little turns and get absolutely

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:35.720 
off tiny little turns and get absolutely
nothing<00:03:29.590> I<00:03:32.910> that<00:03:33.910> it's<00:03:34.030> a<00:03:34.090> gradual<00:03:34.540> thing<00:03:34.599> I

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
nothing I that it's a gradual thing I

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.120 
nothing I that it's a gradual thing I
think<00:03:36.730> there's<00:03:36.849> more<00:03:37.000> air<00:03:37.209> in<00:03:37.360> there<00:03:37.480> now

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
think there's more air in there now

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:42.930 
think there's more air in there now
but<00:03:39.130> you<00:03:39.220> get<00:03:39.310> the<00:03:39.459> idea<00:03:39.489> so<00:03:41.190> I'm<00:03:42.190> not<00:03:42.519> entirely

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
but you get the idea so I'm not entirely

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:44.670 
but you get the idea so I'm not entirely
sure<00:03:43.150> if<00:03:43.540> can<00:03:43.690> inject<00:03:44.019> the<00:03:44.170> problem<00:03:44.530> but<00:03:44.620> I

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
sure if can inject the problem but I

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:46.380 
sure if can inject the problem but I
have<00:03:44.739> tried<00:03:45.069> another<00:03:45.340> injector<00:03:45.970> and<00:03:46.060> it<00:03:46.180> seems

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:46.390 
have tried another injector and it seems

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:48.020 
have tried another injector and it seems
to<00:03:46.510> work<00:03:46.690> okay

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
to work okay

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.370 
to work okay
that's<00:03:49.030> the<00:03:49.209> little<00:03:49.329> plunger<00:03:49.930> there<00:03:50.170> and

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:50.380 
that's the little plunger there and

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:51.870 
that's the little plunger there and
there's<00:03:50.560> also<00:03:50.680> a<00:03:50.860> plunger<00:03:51.400> in<00:03:51.430> there<00:03:51.670> with<00:03:51.790> an

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:51.880 
there's also a plunger in there with an

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:59.150 
there's also a plunger in there with an
o-ring<00:03:51.970> on<00:03:52.360> it<00:03:52.480> the<00:03:53.170> o-ring<00:03:53.530> is<00:03:53.650> good<00:03:56.940> so<00:03:57.940> yeah

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 
o-ring on it the o-ring is good so yeah

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.559 
o-ring on it the o-ring is good so yeah
screw<00:04:00.160> down<00:04:00.430> will<00:04:00.670> be<00:04:00.760> full<00:04:01.000> throttle<00:04:01.450> I

00:04:01.559 --> 00:04:01.569 
screw down will be full throttle I

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:04.410 
screw down will be full throttle I
imagine<00:04:02.019> and<00:04:02.230> then<00:04:02.579> wind<00:04:03.579> it<00:04:03.700> up<00:04:03.790> a<00:04:03.940> bit<00:04:03.970> will

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:04.420 
imagine and then wind it up a bit will

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.140 
imagine and then wind it up a bit will
allow<00:04:04.690> the<00:04:05.130> spring-loaded<00:04:06.130> needle<00:04:06.609> to<00:04:06.700> bypass

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.150 
allow the spring-loaded needle to bypass

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:16.219 
allow the spring-loaded needle to bypass
fuel<00:04:07.600> pressure<00:04:13.319> so<00:04:14.319> it's<00:04:14.470> working<00:04:14.680> fine<00:04:14.980> now

00:04:16.219 --> 00:04:16.229 
fuel pressure so it's working fine now

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:21.539 
fuel pressure so it's working fine now
back<00:04:17.229> it<00:04:17.380> off<00:04:17.470> a<00:04:17.500> fraction<00:04:19.650> nothing<00:04:20.650> a<00:04:20.829> couple

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:21.549 
back it off a fraction nothing a couple

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:23.420 
back it off a fraction nothing a couple
of<00:04:21.669> trips<00:04:21.850> that<00:04:22.000> are<00:04:22.060> already<00:04:22.330> in<00:04:22.419> there<00:04:22.630> so

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
of trips that are already in there so

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.469 
of trips that are already in there so
yeah<00:04:24.430> that's<00:04:24.610> what<00:04:24.760> we're<00:04:24.850> up<00:04:24.910> to<00:04:24.970> on<00:04:25.210> the<00:04:25.330> end

00:04:25.469 --> 00:04:25.479 
yeah that's what we're up to on the end

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:28.110 
yeah that's what we're up to on the end
ma<00:04:26.100> anyone<00:04:27.100> messed<00:04:27.610> around<00:04:27.760> with<00:04:27.940> these
