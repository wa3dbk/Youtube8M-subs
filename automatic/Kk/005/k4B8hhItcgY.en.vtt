00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:41.640
 with a time of authentic Ivan phenomenon 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.949
 Álvarez won the championship of 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.289
 madrid media distance of triathlon in the 

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:49.289
 town of manzanares el real with a 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.940
 3 hours and 41 minutes very 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.769
 putting like this I have fought in the 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.420
 principle was a personal challenge more than 

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:56.280
 nothing fights against my own time 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.500
 for frankfurt that within two weeks 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.149
 and I think that what was achieved with a note 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.070
 Iván Álvarez was only behind 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.260
 its persecutors in the test of 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.660
 swimming but then marked the course of the 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.030
 competition in the cycling segment and the 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:11.940
 skin race behind the triathlete 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.370
 madrileño arrived josé manuel gómez to 9 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.960
 minutes of Ivan's winner is in a 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:17.790
 step above 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.850
 I knew I knew you had to try 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:23.869
 but it was going to be very complicated and javier 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.869
 Moreno in third position 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.090
 ah 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.150
 and special mention also deserves the 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.879
 female participation was awarded the 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:26.230
 test yolanda saints with a time of 4 

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:26.230
 hours and 24 minutes 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:34.630
 more beautiful than valero my partner and 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:37.360
 friend and a great triathlete 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:38.890
 right now it has made me very difficult 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.260
 until I've been able to get it out 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:43.390
 enough to relax me a little 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.730
 but but very well is a champion 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:48.610
 scarce distance from the dragon and valero 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:50.020
 and air isabel estévez she is stronger 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:51.880
 in the race so they knew I was going 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:53.080
 to leave before the water on the bike life 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.450
 to maintain and in the race I will 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:58.230
 spend it having been a mom in February 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.879
 because you could hardly train but 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.340
 I allow myself to try everything for the 

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:04.640
 race for the circuit I liked the 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.640
 mind 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:45.980
 yes 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:09.759
