00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:15.030
 Hello guys 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.100
 Rome that new and rips the blog 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.630
 literature if today I came here to comment 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.670
 a little with you about mine 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.529
 first experience with the shelf site 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:26.880
 virtual I'm not here for a 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:28.920
 nostalgia session because I wanted to have the 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.560
 books that made me start reading there 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.860
 many years because I'm 21 years old 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.600
 I started reading at the age of nine through 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.610
 books from my old library 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.460
 those books launched by the 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:44.250
 Martin sources are then childish but 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.829
 so it's a very sweet price then I 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.559
 it took me to get them to find 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:52.289
 watch a video booth literary what 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.210
 in the afternoon did talking about your videos 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.550
 about these books saying that she 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.460
 bought it in sebum and she gave me the suggestion 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:02.399
 has been rated as a virtual shelf and many 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.799
 people or even after I said I love 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:07.110
 the tallow and I love to buy books in 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.150
 I was asked if I had bought it on 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.010
 virtual stadium and I had never 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.950
 bought the law I never had because I 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.990
 I never really got on with the site 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.880
 I think I've never found the books that 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.040
 I wanted because I never go in 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:24.570
 thus looking for a specific level or 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:27.210
 To know to see if I think it's cool at last. 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:30.150
 search also say the Internet is 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.310
 difficult because there are many do not have photos and 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.650
 very much you just see the title you want to see 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:38.610
 the book mainly when I receive 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:41.220
 so it took me a while to start buying 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:45.360
 a virtual rack up the activity 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:48.780
 suggestion and behind these books that is 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:54.060
 so the reason for having started badly and 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:58.320
 so it was not roger who usually harry 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:00.240
 potter does not even make the little ones 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.119
 to read but I started reading a little bit 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:07.229
 before then I started with these 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:09.599
 series in here is I looked for a tallow that 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.400
 had to bring together the majority of 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.510
 books I wanted because this series 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:17.189
 I think it has 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:19.290
 nine books 8 bits eight books and is 

00:02:17.189 --> 00:02:22.530
 It's hard for you to find them all in the same 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:24.900
 being and today I came that I was selling 6 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.129
 so they were missing 2 anyway I 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.170
 I found superlegal 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:31.709
 the idea of ​​buying there and I ended up buying 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.670
 and it was very good, I do not have anything 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:34.860
 to complain 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.569
 understanding was super good because I 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.860
 had to talk to them at the time of 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:40.140
 payment and they answered me 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.030
 promptly on the same day and also enter 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:45.540
 was very fast and very safe because 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:47.549
 they came very cheap but this goes 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.019
 a lot of samba to be good then the 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:52.260
 Sometimes you may have the misfortune to 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:54.480
 tallow that is not good that is not a loan 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.970
 a good service but I think a little 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.859
 hard to do because they I 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:02.609
 met a gentleman who physically in June and 

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:04.889
 That's where your web site stands for 

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:09.209
 because it ended up profiting 

00:03:04.889 --> 00:03:11.730
 so it's difficult they do not know how to do 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:13.590
 good service , but it can happen 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.180
 Everyone knows this and this is mine. 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.430
 greater fear just like I never bought 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:21.120
 in the free market I think that's because 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:23.340
 fear of finally delivering the state of the 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.989
 product you are buying 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.030
 I did not know it's the way you are. 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:29.519
 get in touch ask some photos some 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.840
 then this is also a suggestion 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:33.510
 for those who are thinking of buying a 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:36.359
 book but does not have the photo there on the site is 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:38.910
 have several options for payment are as 

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:42.720
 pay the boleto has as you pay for 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:44.609
 transfer is know has many types 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.260
 so it's really cool, yes, for those who like 

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:49.440
 for those who do not mind books 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:51.269
 old and used as I do because I 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.849
 I'm really excited about these 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:57.090
 I want to make a video because 

00:03:53.849 --> 00:04:00.599
 only you one so far have come six is ​​just the 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:01.849
 first and are rather separated 

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:03.840
 so you can read these books 

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:06.269
 separately does not need to read in an 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:08.750
 there is no order in truth but what 

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:11.579
 explains the first wants the beginning of everything 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:13.769
 who is a little vampire I do not know if 

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:15.930
 Have you heard of this series? 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:18.419
 but she is very famous in the 70's 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:22.590
 has even a movie about this series that 

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:25.060
 it's nothing short of Indian ethics is for the 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:27.160
 afternoon session and there is nothing faithful 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:30.190
 he will not follow what's here in 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:32.590
 books so I do not advise who to 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:36.100
 you are not even aware of this 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:38.740
 history this story youthful child 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:40.840
 I do not tell anyone who wants to give something 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:43.810
 present by a child and a 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:46.630
 teenager until he was 13 and I was 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:49.690
 very confessed fear of beauty series 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:52.900
 because it is something that has always been in my 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:56.860
 Imagination how beautiful it tastes wonderful 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:59.860
 You can not explain this but it's the 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:01.960
 childhood is the reason I start reading 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:04.840
 so I was not too scared not to 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:07.150
 to like this series of laws with our 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:09.850
 How ridiculous because I know this but not 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:11.950
 that's what happened he the first one 

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:15.389
 book and thus being sensational so 

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:18.760
 more than I found back then I think 

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:22.750
 So I kept on, my love. 

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:27.340
 then these books is a book is well 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:31.180
 and has an average of 130 pages 

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:33.520
 most have some images are then the 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:34.990
 a normal children's book after I do 

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:36.160
 a drawing for you about him so do not 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:39.310
 I'll comment much more 

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:41.350
 ah but it is famous screen mainly 

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:43.870
 abroad then we have a small 

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:45.940
 vampire in danger the little vampire in the 

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:48.190
 the little vampire in the 

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:50.410
 regrets that did not want the chronicle 

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:52.630
 family a little vampire the great 

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:55.060
 Little vampire's love is were six 

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:58.240
 I paid books I think 50 today in 

00:05:55.060 --> 00:06:01.450
 each and are in a very good condition. 

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:03.400
 knows this thesis's sensational total 

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:05.470
 white on the edge while the others 

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:07.510
 they are not and cooler than that 

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:12.160
 then I went to find out that these books 

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:13.000
 the six are from 1993 which is the year of my 

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:15.160
 birth 

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.260
 so it's much more special still people 

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:19.120
 I'm not a big seller on the 

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:21.310

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:23.050
