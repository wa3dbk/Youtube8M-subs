as you can see there I make a lot of
like<00:00:18.960> in<00:00:19.770> the<00:00:19.890> main<00:00:20.070> gear<00:00:20.430> and<00:00:20.670> gym<00:00:21.660> gear<00:00:21.930> this

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
like in the main gear and gym gear this

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.950 
like in the main gear and gym gear this
is<00:00:22.560> actually<00:00:22.920> a<00:00:22.949> plastic<00:00:23.279> skipping<00:00:23.970> rope<00:00:24.180> as

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
you can see it has ball bearings so it

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.709 
you can see it has ball bearings so it
spins<00:00:29.670> around<00:00:29.880> it<00:00:30.300> has<00:00:30.480> a<00:00:30.510> little<00:00:32.390> volume<00:00:33.390> part

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
spins around it has a little volume part

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.910 
spins around it has a little volume part
here<00:00:34.020> so<00:00:34.770> when<00:00:34.890> you're<00:00:35.040> gripping<00:00:35.309> it<00:00:36.920> your

hands which I've never actually seen
this<00:00:39.480> in<00:00:39.600> a<00:00:39.660> rope<00:00:39.840> before<00:00:39.989> a<00:00:40.350> little<00:00:40.770> foam<00:00:40.920> pad

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:41.690 
this in a rope before a little foam pad

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.209 
this in a rope before a little foam pad
if<00:00:42.690> it's<00:00:42.930> wooden<00:00:43.200> as<00:00:43.320> well<00:00:43.500> like<00:00:43.770> it<00:00:43.920> is<00:00:44.040> all

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
if it's wooden as well like it is all

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.080 
finding a missing but yeah it's gone
needless<00:00:47.250> but<00:00:47.610> it<00:00:47.969> doesn't<00:00:48.210> hurt<00:00:48.870> you<00:00:50.090> it's

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
needless but it doesn't hurt you it's

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.069 
needless but it doesn't hurt you it's
adjustable<00:00:51.629> so<00:00:52.230> these<00:00:52.710> two<00:00:53.510> metal<00:00:54.510> Clips<00:00:54.840> you

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
adjustable so these two metal Clips you

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.110 
adjustable so these two metal Clips you
can<00:00:55.110> mason<00:00:55.590> move<00:00:55.739> them<00:00:55.920> up<00:00:56.010> and<00:00:56.160> down<00:00:56.250> and<00:00:56.730> you

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
can mason move them up and down and you

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.360 
can mason move them up and down and you
pull<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.420> rope<00:00:57.600> through<00:00:57.710> the<00:00:58.710> clips

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
pull the rope through the clips

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.189 
pull the rope through the clips
themselves<00:01:00.020> are<00:01:01.020> not<00:01:01.410> very<00:01:02.750> sturdy<00:01:03.750> so

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
themselves are not very sturdy so

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.520 
themselves are not very sturdy so
basically<00:01:04.769> you<00:01:04.890> have<00:01:05.010> to<00:01:05.100> pin<00:01:05.369> them<00:01:05.549> down<00:01:06.530> and

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
basically you have to pin them down and

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.310 
basically you have to pin them down and
they'll<00:01:07.710> clamp<00:01:08.010> on<00:01:08.340> to<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:08.640> rope<00:01:08.909> but<00:01:09.689> after<00:01:10.290> a

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
they'll clamp on to the rope but after a

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.929 
they'll clamp on to the rope but after a
while<00:01:10.470> they<00:01:10.650> become<00:01:10.890> loose<00:01:11.159> and<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.760> rope

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
while they become loose and the rope

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.440 
while they become loose and the rope
will<00:01:12.090> probably<00:01:12.360> move<00:01:13.460> apart<00:01:14.460> from<00:01:14.610> that<00:01:14.850> it's

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
will probably move apart from that it's

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.450 
will probably move apart from that it's
a<00:01:15.479> pretty<00:01:15.630> good<00:01:15.810> Rope<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:18.590> Rope<00:01:19.590> itself<00:01:20.009> is<00:01:20.280> is

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
a pretty good Rope the Rope itself is is

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.730 
a pretty good Rope the Rope itself is is
plastic<00:01:21.240> it's<00:01:21.960> actually<00:01:22.200> quite<00:01:22.409> stretchy

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
plastic it's actually quite stretchy

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.920 
plastic it's actually quite stretchy
whereas<00:01:23.700> normally<00:01:24.180> they've<00:01:24.360> really<00:01:24.750> really

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
whereas normally they've really really

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.249 
whereas normally they've really really
really<00:01:25.530> tight<00:01:26.040> kind<00:01:26.369> of<00:01:26.549> a<00:01:26.670> plastic<00:01:27.030> so<00:01:27.900> after

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
really tight kind of a plastic so after

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.170 
really tight kind of a plastic so after
Wally<00:01:28.470> just<00:01:28.740> snap<00:01:29.040> was<00:01:29.250> I<00:01:29.369> think<00:01:29.579> because<00:01:29.970> this

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
Wally just snap was I think because this

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.050 
Wally just snap was I think because this
is<00:01:30.329> a<00:01:31.040> little<00:01:32.040> bit<00:01:32.130> bendy<00:01:32.460> when<00:01:32.610> you<00:01:32.729> kind<00:01:32.970> of

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
is a little bit bendy when you kind of

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.289 
is a little bit bendy when you kind of
every<00:01:33.900> soft<00:01:34.170> a<00:01:34.259> new<00:01:34.380> trip<00:01:34.680> or<00:01:34.950> you<00:01:35.009> land<00:01:35.970> on<00:01:36.119> it

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
every soft a new trip or you land on it

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.300 
every soft a new trip or you land on it

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
it caught it it Springs rather than this

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.850 
it caught it it Springs rather than this
it's<00:01:38.610> gonna<00:01:38.759> it's<00:01:39.030> going<00:01:39.270> to<00:01:39.390> snap<00:01:39.860> it's

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
some speed like I was doing some tricks

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.520 
some speed like I was doing some tricks
today<00:02:05.240> if<00:02:06.240> you've<00:02:06.630> used<00:02:06.869> a<00:02:07.020> different<00:02:07.259> rope

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
today if you've used a different rope

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.050 
today if you've used a different rope
before<00:02:07.890> like<00:02:08.160> if<00:02:08.280> you<00:02:08.340> didn't<00:02:08.580> use<00:02:08.819> one<00:02:08.970> of

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
before like if you didn't use one of

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.360 
before like if you didn't use one of
those<00:02:09.149> cheap<00:02:09.470> three-pound<00:02:10.470> ropes<00:02:10.739> and<00:02:11.039> you

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
those cheap three-pound ropes and you

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.010 
those cheap three-pound ropes and you
move<00:02:11.550> to<00:02:11.580> this

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
move to this

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.240 
move to this
and<00:02:13.110> take<00:02:13.320> you<00:02:13.470> while<00:02:13.590> to<00:02:13.740> get<00:02:13.860> used<00:02:14.040> to<00:02:14.130> it

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
and take you while to get used to it

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.820 
and take you while to get used to it
because<00:02:14.750> basically<00:02:15.750> it's<00:02:16.140> a<00:02:16.170> rotating<00:02:16.650> along

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
because basically it's a rotating along

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.660 
because basically it's a rotating along
there<00:02:17.100> but<00:02:17.700> this<00:02:17.880> little<00:02:18.090> bit<00:02:18.330> of<00:02:18.390> plastic

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
there but this little bit of plastic

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:21.920 
there but this little bit of plastic
messes<00:02:20.670> up<00:02:20.790> the<00:02:20.880> swing<00:02:21.150> a<00:02:21.180> little<00:02:21.300> bit<00:02:21.450> I<00:02:21.540> think

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
messes up the swing a little bit I think

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.560 
messes up the swing a little bit I think
personally<00:02:22.440> and<00:02:22.640> also<00:02:23.640> when<00:02:24.240> you're<00:02:24.330> skipping

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570 
personally and also when you're skipping

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:25.250 
personally and also when you're skipping
along

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
along

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.860 
along
it<00:02:26.220> doesn't<00:02:26.580> always<00:02:26.730> doesn't<00:02:27.210> spin<00:02:27.570> just<00:02:27.750> like

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
it doesn't always doesn't spin just like

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.420 
it doesn't always doesn't spin just like
that<00:02:28.340> you<00:02:29.340> go<00:02:29.490> round<00:02:29.730> like<00:02:30.000> this<00:02:30.230> so<00:02:31.430> because

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
that you go round like this so because

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.230 
that you go round like this so because
there's<00:02:32.610> two<00:02:32.880> click<00:02:33.810> just<00:02:34.080> fit<00:02:34.290> in<00:02:34.380> the<00:02:34.440> middle

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:35.240 
there's two click just fit in the middle

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.060 
there's two click just fit in the middle
basically<00:02:36.440> it's<00:02:37.440> not<00:02:37.500> going<00:02:37.680> to<00:02:37.740> spin<00:02:37.950> like

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
basically it's not going to spin like

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:40.790 
basically it's not going to spin like
that<00:02:38.930> that's<00:02:39.930> not<00:02:40.080> that's<00:02:40.260> the<00:02:40.440> natural

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
that that's not that's the natural

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.860 
that that's not that's the natural
movement<00:02:41.190> you<00:02:41.250> would<00:02:41.400> it's<00:02:42.270> going<00:02:42.510> to<00:02:42.600> go<00:02:42.720> like

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
movement you would it's going to go like

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.570 
movement you would it's going to go like
here<00:02:43.080> so<00:02:43.320> every<00:02:43.890> so<00:02:44.010> often<00:02:44.190> it<00:02:44.370> will<00:02:44.430> just

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
here so every so often it will just

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.750 
here so every so often it will just
flick<00:02:44.850> through

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
flick through

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.880 
flick through
so<00:02:47.760> basically<00:02:48.150> kind<00:02:48.600> of<00:02:48.660> messes<00:02:49.320> up<00:02:49.440> your<00:02:49.560> spin

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
so basically kind of messes up your spin

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.100 
so basically kind of messes up your spin
a<00:02:49.920> little<00:02:50.130> bit<00:02:50.340> I<00:02:50.460> think<00:02:50.840> personally<00:02:51.840> because

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
a little bit I think personally because

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:58.100 
a little bit I think personally because
my<00:02:52.260> old<00:02:52.500> rope<00:02:53.090> which<00:02:54.090> is<00:02:54.440> here<00:02:56.900> it's<00:02:57.900> one

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
my old rope which is here it's one

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:03.920 
my old rope which is here it's one
movement<00:03:02.180> yeah<00:03:03.180> if<00:03:03.420> you're<00:03:03.630> used<00:03:03.870> to

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
movement yeah if you're used to

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.600 
movement yeah if you're used to
something<00:03:04.140> up<00:03:04.320> that<00:03:04.350> when<00:03:05.130> you<00:03:05.220> move<00:03:05.460> to

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
something up that when you move to

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:09.170 
something up that when you move to
something<00:03:05.820> like<00:03:07.550> it<00:03:08.550> takes<00:03:08.730> a<00:03:08.820> while<00:03:08.910> to<00:03:08.970> get

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
something like it takes a while to get

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.320 
something like it takes a while to get
used<00:03:09.360> to<00:03:09.450> with<00:03:10.080> this<00:03:10.230> like<00:03:10.620> with<00:03:11.520> this<00:03:11.610> one<00:03:11.670> you

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
used to with this like with this one you

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
used to with this like with this one you
get<00:03:13.550> a<00:03:14.550> good<00:03:15.300> spin<00:03:16.940> just<00:03:17.940> keep<00:03:18.090> going<00:03:18.420> so<00:03:18.990> this

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
get a good spin just keep going so this

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:20.990 
get a good spin just keep going so this
rope<00:03:19.530> actually<00:03:19.920> really<00:03:20.220> good<00:03:20.400> like<00:03:20.760> I

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
rope actually really good like I

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.030 
rope actually really good like I
underestimate<00:03:21.840> how<00:03:22.020> good<00:03:22.260> this<00:03:22.350> rope<00:03:22.530> is<00:03:22.709> but

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
underestimate how good this rope is but

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.250 
underestimate how good this rope is but
only<00:03:23.160> things<00:03:23.400> that<00:03:23.580> it's<00:03:23.760> got<00:03:23.940> its<00:03:24.209> got<00:03:24.300> shelf

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
only things that it's got its got shelf

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.650 
only things that it's got its got shelf
life<00:03:25.470> so<00:03:26.400> if<00:03:26.490> you<00:03:26.610> were<00:03:26.760> to<00:03:26.940> get<00:03:27.060> rope<00:03:27.330> up<00:03:27.510> this

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
life so if you were to get rope up this

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.449 
life so if you were to get rope up this
which<00:03:27.870> is<00:03:28.020> listening<00:03:28.380> to<00:03:28.530> metal<00:03:28.680> wire<00:03:28.980> and

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
which is listening to metal wire and

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:31.580 
which is listening to metal wire and
it's<00:03:30.209> got<00:03:30.450> ball<00:03:30.660> bearings<00:03:31.080> a<00:03:31.200> forgotten<00:03:31.500> name

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
it's got ball bearings a forgotten name

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.780 
it's got ball bearings a forgotten name
to<00:03:31.770> company<00:03:33.170> he<00:03:34.170> doesn't<00:03:34.380> even<00:03:34.500> say<00:03:34.680> yeah<00:03:35.160> I've

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:38.070 
one named a company these are good but

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:40.310 
one named a company these are good but
they<00:03:38.160> won't<00:03:38.340> last<00:03:38.550> very<00:03:38.670> long<00:03:38.940> and<00:03:39.870> also<00:03:40.050> this

skipping<00:03:43.890> rope<00:03:44.360> all<00:03:45.360> the<00:03:45.390> noise<00:03:45.630> is<00:03:45.900> a<00:03:45.959> good

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
skipping rope all the noise is a good

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.440 
skipping rope all the noise is a good
purchase<00:03:46.560> and<00:03:46.880> after<00:03:47.880> a<00:03:47.910> while<00:03:48.060> I'll<00:03:48.300> get

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
purchase and after a while I'll get

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.270 
purchase and after a while I'll get
better<00:03:48.600> and<00:03:48.840> better<00:03:48.930> with<00:03:49.230> it<00:03:49.350> doing<00:03:49.980> Dublin

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
better and better with it doing Dublin

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.340 
better and better with it doing Dublin
this<00:03:50.430> thing<00:03:50.730> that<00:03:50.880> was<00:03:50.970> fine<00:03:51.240> I<00:03:51.510> was<00:03:51.810> doing

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.350 
this thing that was fine I was doing

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:54.380 
this thing that was fine I was doing
criss<00:03:53.190> cross<00:03:53.459> where<00:03:53.700> that's<00:03:53.970> called<00:03:54.180> and<00:03:54.330> that

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
criss cross where that's called and that

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:56.630 
criss cross where that's called and that
was<00:03:54.510> fine<00:03:54.780> it's<00:03:55.500> just<00:03:55.650> a<00:03:55.740> case<00:03:55.950> of<00:03:55.980> making<00:03:56.250> sure

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 
was fine it's just a case of making sure

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.460 
was fine it's just a case of making sure
it's<00:03:56.880> the<00:03:56.940> right<00:03:57.150> length<00:03:57.360> for<00:03:57.510> you<00:03:57.750> you<00:03:58.020> adjust

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
it's the right length for you you adjust

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:00.890 
it's the right length for you you adjust
it<00:03:58.620> because<00:03:59.209> if<00:04:00.209> it's<00:04:00.420> not<00:04:00.540> the<00:04:00.630> right<00:04:00.720> length

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
it because if it's not the right length

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.390 
it because if it's not the right length
it's<00:04:01.140> really<00:04:01.410> it's<00:04:01.500> not<00:04:01.620> going<00:04:01.740> to<00:04:01.800> spin<00:04:02.010> like

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
it's really it's not going to spin like

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.500 
it's really it's not going to spin like
how<00:04:02.610> it<00:04:02.820> should<00:04:02.850> do<00:04:04.730> no<00:04:05.730> it's<00:04:05.970> a<00:04:06.060> good<00:04:06.240> it's<00:04:06.390> a

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
how it should do no it's a good it's a

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.870 
how it should do no it's a good it's a
good<00:04:06.540> work<00:04:06.810> it's<00:04:07.410> a<00:04:07.470> good<00:04:07.590> rope<00:04:07.770> it<00:04:08.610> doesn't

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:08.880 
good work it's a good rope it doesn't

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:10.850 
good work it's a good rope it doesn't
spin<00:04:09.150> as<00:04:09.390> fast<00:04:09.750> as<00:04:10.110> to<00:04:10.200> rope<00:04:10.380> I<00:04:10.500> just<00:04:10.709> showed

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:10.860 
spin as fast as to rope I just showed

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:14.479 
spin as fast as to rope I just showed
you<00:04:10.910> but<00:04:11.910> I<00:04:12.530> would<00:04:13.530> say<00:04:13.980> is<00:04:14.100> more<00:04:14.280> durable

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:14.489 
you but I would say is more durable

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:16.400 
you but I would say is more durable
because<00:04:15.060> this<00:04:15.239> is<00:04:15.390> plastic<00:04:15.840> and<00:04:16.080> that's<00:04:16.200> metal

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
because this is plastic and that's metal

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.199 
because this is plastic and that's metal
the<00:04:16.919> only<00:04:17.070> thing<00:04:17.220> is<00:04:17.340> that<00:04:17.370> because<00:04:17.880> that<00:04:18.090> is

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
the only thing is that because that is

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:21.409 
the only thing is that because that is
wire<00:04:18.720> and<00:04:19.230> it's<00:04:20.070> quite<00:04:20.340> thick<00:04:20.640> wire<00:04:20.910> it

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:21.419 
wire and it's quite thick wire it

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:24.230 
wire and it's quite thick wire it
actually<00:04:21.840> bends<00:04:22.470> to<00:04:22.740> a<00:04:22.770> certain<00:04:23.040> shape<00:04:23.280> so<00:04:23.550> it

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
actually bends to a certain shape so it

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.969 
actually bends to a certain shape so it
even<00:04:24.750> though<00:04:24.810> it's<00:04:24.960> durable<00:04:25.320> if<00:04:25.470> then<00:04:25.620> becomes

00:04:25.969 --> 00:04:25.979 
even though it's durable if then becomes

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:26.930 
even though it's durable if then becomes
useful

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
useful

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:30.050 
useful
sorry<00:04:27.720> it<00:04:27.810> becomes<00:04:28.140> not<00:04:28.440> useful<00:04:29.310> because<00:04:29.670> it's

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 
sorry it becomes not useful because it's

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:33.800 
sorry it becomes not useful because it's
bent<00:04:30.300> or<00:04:30.540> some<00:04:30.720> shape<00:04:31.140> where's<00:04:31.470> this<00:04:32.810> it's

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:33.810 
bent or some shape where's this it's

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:35.570 
bent or some shape where's this it's
just<00:04:33.960> plastic<00:04:34.140> all<00:04:34.470> this<00:04:34.650> really<00:04:34.920> it's<00:04:35.280> little

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:35.580 
just plastic all this really it's little

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:37.400 
just plastic all this really it's little
wife<00:04:35.760> but<00:04:36.570> when<00:04:36.690> you're<00:04:36.810> spinning<00:04:37.020> that<00:04:37.290> way

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:37.410 
wife but when you're spinning that way

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:39.710 
wife but when you're spinning that way
doesn't<00:04:37.620> mean<00:04:37.800> anything<00:04:38.190> whereas<00:04:38.820> in<00:04:39.510> this

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:39.720 
doesn't mean anything whereas in this

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:40.280 
doesn't mean anything whereas in this
rope

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:40.290 
rope

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:45.410 
rope
you<00:04:40.560> get<00:04:40.710> lot<00:04:43.220> likey<00:04:44.220> a<00:04:44.250> massive<00:04:44.820> way<00:04:44.970> like<00:04:45.300> I'm

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:45.420 
you get lot likey a massive way like I'm

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:47.270 
you get lot likey a massive way like I'm
not<00:04:45.570> holding<00:04:45.810> Matt<00:04:45.960> and<00:04:46.080> he<00:04:46.140> just<00:04:46.290> bends<00:04:46.530> just

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:47.280 
not holding Matt and he just bends just

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:50.000 
not holding Matt and he just bends just
you<00:04:47.400> spin<00:04:47.720> so<00:04:48.720> yeah<00:04:48.930> why<00:04:49.200> it<00:04:49.260> skipping<00:04:49.890> work

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.010 
you spin so yeah why it skipping work

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:53.540 
you spin so yeah why it skipping work
thick<00:04:50.550> why<00:04:50.790> skip<00:04:51.180> knows<00:04:52.070> yeah<00:04:53.070> this<00:04:53.340> won't

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:53.550 
thick why skip knows yeah this won't

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:56.510 
thick why skip knows yeah this won't
quite<00:04:53.910> a<00:04:54.000> long<00:04:54.210> video<00:04:54.390> hopefully<00:04:55.490> you'll<00:04:56.490> be

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:56.520 
quite a long video hopefully you'll be

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:57.560 
quite a long video hopefully you'll be
able<00:04:56.640> to<00:04:56.850> make<00:04:57.000> an<00:04:57.120> informed<00:04:57.540> decision

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:57.570 
able to make an informed decision

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:01.130 
able to make an informed decision
whether<00:04:58.200> or<00:04:58.380> not<00:04:58.470> to<00:04:58.650> buy<00:04:59.010> an<00:04:59.640> ID<00:04:59.940> yet<00:05:00.210> plastic

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:01.140 
whether or not to buy an ID yet plastic

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:03.620 
whether or not to buy an ID yet plastic
in<00:05:01.980> terms<00:05:02.250> of<00:05:02.460> plastic<00:05:02.640> tape<00:05:02.970> and<00:05:03.120> ropes<00:05:03.270> I'd

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:03.630 
in terms of plastic tape and ropes I'd

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:06.350 
in terms of plastic tape and ropes I'd
rate<00:05:04.380> this<00:05:04.410> higher<00:05:04.860> than<00:05:05.160> your<00:05:05.310> usual<00:05:05.520> plastic

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:06.360 
rate this higher than your usual plastic

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.840 
rate this higher than your usual plastic
skipping<00:05:06.660> rope<00:05:06.780> usually<00:05:07.430> this<00:05:08.430> bit<00:05:08.670> here

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:08.850 
skipping rope usually this bit here

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:11.810 
skipping rope usually this bit here
because<00:05:09.720> if<00:05:10.080> you<00:05:10.110> put<00:05:10.380> this<00:05:10.650> plastic<00:05:10.980> inside

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:11.820 
because if you put this plastic inside

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:13.970 
because if you put this plastic inside
like<00:05:12.720> I<00:05:12.990> just<00:05:13.140> showed<00:05:13.320> you<00:05:13.350> everyone

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:13.980 
like I just showed you everyone

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:16.070 
like I just showed you everyone
basically<00:05:14.490> it<00:05:14.850> wears<00:05:15.150> a<00:05:15.270> rock<00:05:15.540> way<00:05:15.810> of<00:05:15.990> the

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:16.080 
basically it wears a rock way of the

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:17.990 
basically it wears a rock way of the
plastic<00:05:16.500> and<00:05:16.620> that<00:05:16.770> person<00:05:17.430> bit<00:05:17.640> and<00:05:17.760> then<00:05:17.880> it

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.000 
plastic and that person bit and then it

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.310 
plastic and that person bit and then it
snaps<00:05:18.300> there<00:05:18.570> that's<00:05:18.870> usually<00:05:19.110> where<00:05:19.230> they

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:19.320 
snaps there that's usually where they

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:21.710 
snaps there that's usually where they
listen<00:05:19.620> up<00:05:19.740> so<00:05:20.250> don't<00:05:20.430> if<00:05:20.880> you<00:05:21.240> just<00:05:21.420> stand<00:05:21.540> out

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:33.120 
skipping rope which I bought which is

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:35.090 
skipping rope which I bought which is
why<00:05:33.360> up<00:05:33.600> it's<00:05:33.810> a<00:05:33.870> lot<00:05:34.020> thinner<00:05:34.260> wire<00:05:34.560> check

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:35.100 
why up it's a lot thinner wire check
