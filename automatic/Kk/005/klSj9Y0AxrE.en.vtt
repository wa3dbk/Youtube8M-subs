00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:05.320 
hey guys this is version 2 of my GoPro

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:07.740 
hey guys this is version 2 of my GoPro
self<00:00:05.770> leveling<00:00:06.190> mount<00:00:06.430> I'm<00:00:07.150> gonna<00:00:07.330> give<00:00:07.630> you<00:00:07.720> a

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:07.750 
self leveling mount I'm gonna give you a

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:10.289 
self leveling mount I'm gonna give you a
quick<00:00:07.960> overview<00:00:08.500> of<00:00:08.530> it<00:00:08.860> and<00:00:09.070> then<00:00:09.910> compare<00:00:10.269> it

00:00:10.289 --> 00:00:10.299 
quick overview of it and then compare it

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:11.999 
quick overview of it and then compare it
to<00:00:10.450> the<00:00:10.599> the<00:00:10.900> first<00:00:11.139> version<00:00:11.469> real<00:00:11.620> quick<00:00:11.830> and

00:00:11.999 --> 00:00:12.009 
to the the first version real quick and

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:14.640 
to the the first version real quick and
then<00:00:12.129> we'll<00:00:12.400> get<00:00:12.730> right<00:00:13.030> into<00:00:13.209> the<00:00:13.419> build<00:00:13.650> the

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:14.650 
then we'll get right into the build the

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:16.859 
then we'll get right into the build the
purpose<00:00:14.950> of<00:00:15.129> these<00:00:15.219> self<00:00:15.820> leveling<00:00:16.270> mounts<00:00:16.660> is

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:16.869 
purpose of these self leveling mounts is

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:19.290 
purpose of these self leveling mounts is
that<00:00:17.260> they<00:00:17.470> will<00:00:17.650> keep<00:00:17.830> the<00:00:18.070> camera<00:00:18.760> pointed

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:19.300 
that they will keep the camera pointed

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.540 
that they will keep the camera pointed
the<00:00:19.449> horizon<00:00:20.109> when<00:00:20.980> the<00:00:21.099> mounting<00:00:21.400> base

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:21.550 
the horizon when the mounting base

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.839 
the horizon when the mounting base
changes<00:00:22.119> angle<00:00:23.250> I'll<00:00:24.250> show<00:00:24.460> you<00:00:24.519> a<00:00:24.640> little

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:24.849 
changes angle I'll show you a little

changes angle I'll show you a little
demonstration<00:00:25.060> footage<00:00:25.720> real<00:00:26.259> quick<00:00:26.500> here

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:26.830 
demonstration footage real quick here

00:00:26.830 --> 00:01:12.940 
demonstration footage real quick here
just<00:00:27.220> to<00:00:27.310> show<00:00:27.490> you<00:00:27.550> what<00:00:27.730> I'm<00:00:27.789> talking<00:00:27.910> about

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.340 

this<00:01:13.640> is<00:01:13.789> version<00:01:14.000> two<00:01:14.329> of<00:01:14.360> the<00:01:14.630> mouth<00:01:15.079> that<00:01:15.289> I

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.350 
this is version two of the mouth that I

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.279 
this is version two of the mouth that I
just<00:01:15.560> finished<00:01:15.920> here's<00:01:16.880> the<00:01:17.240> first<00:01:17.750> version

00:01:18.279 --> 00:01:18.289 
just finished here's the first version

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:20.679 
just finished here's the first version
and<00:01:18.500> they<00:01:18.979> both<00:01:19.159> have<00:01:19.399> some<00:01:19.700> some<00:01:20.509> positive

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:20.689 
and they both have some some positive

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:24.370 
and they both have some some positive
and<00:01:21.170> negative<00:01:21.469> aspects<00:01:22.360> version<00:01:23.360> one<00:01:23.630> has<00:01:24.170> it

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
and negative aspects version one has it

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.109 
and negative aspects version one has it
has<00:01:24.619> a<00:01:24.649> bearing<00:01:25.070> in<00:01:25.219> here<00:01:25.429> so<00:01:25.700> it<00:01:25.789> keeps<00:01:25.909> the

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:26.119 
has a bearing in here so it keeps the

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:28.660 
has a bearing in here so it keeps the
camera<00:01:26.299> point<00:01:26.780> of<00:01:26.899> the<00:01:27.020> horizon<00:01:27.170> by<00:01:27.979> balancing

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 
camera point of the horizon by balancing

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.669 
camera point of the horizon by balancing
it<00:01:30.819> the<00:01:31.819> downsides<00:01:32.390> are<00:01:32.689> that<00:01:32.750> it's<00:01:33.079> it's<00:01:33.439> hard

00:01:33.669 --> 00:01:33.679 
it the downsides are that it's it's hard

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:36.160 
it the downsides are that it's it's hard
to<00:01:33.770> balance<00:01:34.159> this<00:01:34.610> and<00:01:34.939> when<00:01:35.299> you<00:01:35.329> do<00:01:35.630> it's

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 
to balance this and when you do it's

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.169 
to balance this and when you do it's
only<00:01:36.409> balanced<00:01:36.799> for<00:01:36.950> one<00:01:37.130> case<00:01:37.429> you<00:01:37.969> know<00:01:38.090> if

00:01:38.169 --> 00:01:38.179 
only balanced for one case you know if

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:39.850 
only balanced for one case you know if
you're<00:01:38.329> changing<00:01:38.509> cases<00:01:39.079> from<00:01:39.319> water<00:01:39.590> proof

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:39.860 
you're changing cases from water proof

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.770 
you're changing cases from water proof
to<00:01:40.159> the<00:01:41.030> frame<00:01:41.329> that<00:01:41.810> may<00:01:42.079> may<00:01:42.979> come<00:01:43.250> into<00:01:43.369> play

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.780 
to the frame that may may come into play

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.330 
to the frame that may may come into play
it's<00:01:44.780> possibly<00:01:45.349> a<00:01:45.470> little<00:01:45.649> bit<00:01:45.799> more<00:01:46.039> fragile

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
it's possibly a little bit more fragile

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.039 
it's possibly a little bit more fragile
than<00:01:46.819> the<00:01:47.060> second<00:01:47.390> version<00:01:47.950> the<00:01:49.929> positive<00:01:50.929> is

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:51.049 
than the second version the positive is

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:54.460 
than the second version the positive is
that<00:01:51.079> it<00:01:51.319> can<00:01:51.560> rotate<00:01:51.890> 360<00:01:52.640> degrees<00:01:53.079> if<00:01:54.079> that

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:54.470 
that it can rotate 360 degrees if that

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.729 
that it can rotate 360 degrees if that
comes<00:01:55.220> into<00:01:55.399> play<00:01:55.490> for<00:01:55.670> your<00:01:55.939> application<00:01:56.739> and

00:01:57.729 --> 00:01:57.739 
comes into play for your application and

00:01:57.739 --> 00:01:59.889 
comes into play for your application and
it<00:01:57.890> can<00:01:58.099> be<00:01:58.310> blown<00:01:58.549> by<00:01:58.579> wind<00:01:58.759> which<00:01:59.360> is<00:01:59.390> a

00:01:59.889 --> 00:01:59.899 
it can be blown by wind which is a

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:03.190 
it can be blown by wind which is a
negative<00:02:00.459> -<00:02:01.659> definitely<00:02:02.659> think<00:02:02.810> about<00:02:02.840> that

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
negative - definitely think about that

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.550 
negative - definitely think about that
the<00:02:04.069> second<00:02:04.640> version<00:02:04.929> there's<00:02:05.929> no<00:02:06.079> balancing

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
the second version there's no balancing

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.889 
the second version there's no balancing
involved<00:02:07.159> you<00:02:07.670> can<00:02:07.819> easily<00:02:08.179> switch<00:02:08.420> from<00:02:08.660> case

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
involved you can easily switch from case

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:10.960 
involved you can easily switch from case
to<00:02:08.929> case<00:02:09.340> because<00:02:10.340> you<00:02:10.459> don't<00:02:10.700> have<00:02:10.819> to

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
to case because you don't have to

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.890 
to case because you don't have to
balance<00:02:11.120> it<00:02:11.450> it<00:02:12.260> could<00:02:12.769> be<00:02:12.799> slightly<00:02:13.250> stronger

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
balance it it could be slightly stronger

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.780 
balance it it could be slightly stronger
that's<00:02:14.900> kind<00:02:15.200> of<00:02:15.260> one<00:02:15.530> factor<00:02:16.040> or<00:02:16.310> one<00:02:16.489> reason

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
that's kind of one factor or one reason

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.170 
that's kind of one factor or one reason
I<00:02:16.880> built<00:02:17.090> it<00:02:17.920> it's<00:02:18.920> not<00:02:19.160> susceptible<00:02:19.549> to<00:02:19.880> wind

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
I built it it's not susceptible to wind

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.440 
I built it it's not susceptible to wind
but<00:02:20.930> the<00:02:21.709> downside<00:02:21.950> is<00:02:22.250> that<00:02:22.430> only<00:02:22.790> pivots

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
but the downside is that only pivots

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:29.289 
but the downside is that only pivots
about<00:02:24.100> 180<00:02:25.100> degrees<00:02:26.290> so<00:02:27.609> most<00:02:28.609> applications

00:02:29.289 --> 00:02:29.299 
about 180 degrees so most applications

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:32.620 
about 180 degrees so most applications
that<00:02:30.049> would<00:02:30.230> be<00:02:30.350> enough<00:02:30.650> but<00:02:31.239> if<00:02:32.239> you<00:02:32.420> need<00:02:32.569> to

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
that would be enough but if you need to

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:34.900 
that would be enough but if you need to
do<00:02:32.750> over<00:02:33.049> 180<00:02:33.560> degrees<00:02:34.250> you<00:02:34.280> might<00:02:34.670> want<00:02:34.850> to

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
do over 180 degrees you might want to

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.059 
do over 180 degrees you might want to
build<00:02:35.090> this<00:02:35.269> first<00:02:35.600> version<00:02:35.840> but<00:02:36.440> I'll<00:02:36.889> put<00:02:37.010> a

it's<00:03:01.370> about<00:03:01.519> eleven<00:03:02.030> dollars<00:03:02.420> for<00:03:02.750> this<00:03:02.870> tiny

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
it's about eleven dollars for this tiny

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.059 
it's about eleven dollars for this tiny
little<00:03:03.470> thing<00:03:03.880> amazingly<00:03:05.170> but<00:03:06.170> that's<00:03:06.380> the

00:03:07.059 --> 00:03:07.069 
little thing amazingly but that's the

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:09.610 
little thing amazingly but that's the
only<00:03:07.370> place<00:03:07.549> that<00:03:07.579> I<00:03:07.760> could<00:03:07.940> find<00:03:08.150> these<00:03:08.620> it's

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
only place that I could find these it's

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.680 
only place that I could find these it's
pretty<00:03:09.919> tiny<00:03:10.489> but<00:03:10.819> that's<00:03:10.970> that's<00:03:11.299> the<00:03:11.450> heart

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690 
pretty tiny but that's that's the heart

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:14.800 
pretty tiny but that's that's the heart
of<00:03:11.750> the<00:03:11.840> whole<00:03:11.989> system<00:03:12.760> the<00:03:13.760> part<00:03:13.970> number<00:03:14.299> from

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
of the whole system the part number from

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.300 
of the whole system the part number from
mcmaster-carr<00:03:15.319> is<00:03:15.889> six<00:03:16.669> five<00:03:16.880> nine<00:03:16.910> seven<00:03:18.310> k-8

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 
mcmaster-carr is six five nine seven k-8

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:22.119 
mcmaster-carr is six five nine seven k-8
and<00:03:19.549> I'll<00:03:20.329> put<00:03:20.630> a<00:03:20.870> link<00:03:21.230> in<00:03:21.379> the<00:03:21.409> in<00:03:22.040> the

00:03:22.119 --> 00:03:22.129 
and I'll put a link in the in the

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:25.679 
and I'll put a link in the in the
description<00:03:23.079> so<00:03:24.079> this<00:03:24.709> is<00:03:24.980> the

00:03:25.679 --> 00:03:25.689 
description so this is the

00:03:25.689 --> 00:03:29.759 
description so this is the
apart<00:03:26.409> that's<00:03:26.620> the<00:03:26.890> key<00:03:28.019> it<00:03:29.019> resists<00:03:29.709> the

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:29.769 
apart that's the key it resists the

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:34.020 
apart that's the key it resists the
torque<00:03:30.549> and<00:03:30.909> only<00:03:31.840> lets<00:03:32.049> it<00:03:32.200> spin<00:03:33.069> smoothly<00:03:33.459> so

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
torque and only lets it spin smoothly so

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:36.809 
torque and only lets it spin smoothly so
that<00:03:34.359> is<00:03:35.079> the<00:03:35.230> key<00:03:35.379> to<00:03:35.409> the<00:03:35.590> whole<00:03:35.680> thing<00:03:35.819> the

00:03:36.809 --> 00:03:36.819 
that is the key to the whole thing the

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:40.649 
that is the key to the whole thing the
frame<00:03:37.469> is<00:03:38.469> pretty<00:03:39.040> rudimentary<00:03:39.430> here<00:03:39.939> it's

00:03:40.649 --> 00:03:40.659 
frame is pretty rudimentary here it's

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:43.289 
frame is pretty rudimentary here it's
made<00:03:40.900> out<00:03:41.079> of<00:03:41.109> eighth<00:03:41.709> inch<00:03:42.099> thick<00:03:42.299> aluminum

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:43.299 
made out of eighth inch thick aluminum

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:46.979 
made out of eighth inch thick aluminum
and<00:03:43.840> it's<00:03:44.709> an<00:03:44.859> inch<00:03:45.010> and<00:03:45.159> a<00:03:45.189> quarter<00:03:45.340> wide<00:03:45.989> this

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:46.989 
and it's an inch and a quarter wide this

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:49.800 
and it's an inch and a quarter wide this
is<00:03:47.049> roughly<00:03:47.680> four<00:03:47.950> and<00:03:48.099> a<00:03:48.129> half<00:03:48.159> long<00:03:48.549> but<00:03:49.180> you

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
is roughly four and a half long but you

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:51.569 
is roughly four and a half long but you
might<00:03:49.959> want<00:03:50.139> to<00:03:50.170> alter<00:03:50.319> that<00:03:50.590> for<00:03:51.430> your

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:51.579 
might want to alter that for your

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:57.270 
might want to alter that for your
situation<00:03:54.569> the<00:03:55.569> ears<00:03:55.900> on<00:03:56.230> here<00:03:56.560> I<00:03:56.769> was<00:03:56.919> worried

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 
situation the ears on here I was worried

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.240 
situation the ears on here I was worried
are<00:03:57.459> kind<00:03:58.090> of<00:03:58.180> flimsy<00:03:58.389> so<00:03:58.900> I<00:03:59.230> built<00:03:59.769> this<00:03:59.950> mount

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250 
are kind of flimsy so I built this mount

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:03.000 
are kind of flimsy so I built this mount
to<00:04:00.579> sandwich<00:04:01.239> it<00:04:01.569> between<00:04:01.840> two<00:04:02.620> pieces<00:04:02.650> of

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.010 
to sandwich it between two pieces of

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:05.759 
to sandwich it between two pieces of
aluminum<00:04:03.510> so<00:04:04.510> you<00:04:04.659> can<00:04:04.870> see<00:04:05.019> this<00:04:05.199> slides

00:04:05.759 --> 00:04:05.769 
aluminum so you can see this slides

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:08.159 
aluminum so you can see this slides
through<00:04:06.040> like<00:04:06.310> this<00:04:06.549> and<00:04:06.849> then<00:04:07.599> that<00:04:07.750> bolts

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:08.169 
through like this and then that bolts

00:04:08.169 --> 00:04:11.039 
through like this and then that bolts
together<00:04:08.319> and<00:04:08.859> sandwiches<00:04:09.459> it<00:04:09.639> okay<00:04:10.510> so<00:04:10.959> I've

00:04:11.039 --> 00:04:11.049 
together and sandwiches it okay so I've

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:12.959 
together and sandwiches it okay so I've
got<00:04:11.079> this<00:04:11.379> bolted<00:04:12.069> together<00:04:12.219> that<00:04:12.939> just

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:12.969 
got this bolted together that just

00:04:12.969 --> 00:04:15.629 
got this bolted together that just
sandwiches<00:04:13.689> the<00:04:13.900> rotary<00:04:14.260> damper<00:04:14.500> in<00:04:15.069> there

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:15.639 
sandwiches the rotary damper in there

00:04:15.639 --> 00:04:20.430 
sandwiches the rotary damper in there
just<00:04:16.030> some<00:04:16.299> small<00:04:16.989> some<00:04:17.680> small<00:04:17.949> bolts<00:04:18.509> I<00:04:19.509> did

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:20.440 
just some small some small bolts I did

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:21.719 
just some small some small bolts I did
want<00:04:20.620> to<00:04:20.650> point<00:04:20.799> out<00:04:20.889> that<00:04:20.949> it's<00:04:21.220> important<00:04:21.699> to

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:21.729 
want to point out that it's important to

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:24.300 
want to point out that it's important to
get<00:04:21.910> this<00:04:22.120> specific<00:04:22.780> damper<00:04:23.169> if<00:04:23.800> you<00:04:23.949> get<00:04:24.099> one

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310 
get this specific damper if you get one

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:27.570 
get this specific damper if you get one
smaller<00:04:25.210> or<00:04:25.599> larger<00:04:26.199> the<00:04:26.650> torque<00:04:27.099> rating<00:04:27.430> will

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:27.580 
smaller or larger the torque rating will

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:29.850 
smaller or larger the torque rating will
be<00:04:27.610> different<00:04:28.120> and<00:04:28.330> the<00:04:29.020> camera<00:04:29.380> either<00:04:29.530> won't

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:29.860 
be different and the camera either won't

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:31.800 
be different and the camera either won't
be<00:04:30.070> able<00:04:30.220> to<00:04:30.310> swing<00:04:30.639> because<00:04:31.000> the<00:04:31.180> torque<00:04:31.720> is

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810 
be able to swing because the torque is

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:34.379 
be able to swing because the torque is
too<00:04:31.930> high<00:04:32.110> or<00:04:32.500> it'll<00:04:33.009> just<00:04:33.310> be<00:04:33.460> too<00:04:33.669> small<00:04:34.030> and

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:34.389 
too high or it'll just be too small and

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:38.040 
too high or it'll just be too small and
be<00:04:34.990> floppy<00:04:35.320> and<00:04:35.500> fragile<00:04:36.630> okay<00:04:37.630> so<00:04:37.690> I've<00:04:38.020> got

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.050 
be floppy and fragile okay so I've got

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:42.990 
be floppy and fragile okay so I've got
it<00:04:38.970> mounted<00:04:39.970> in<00:04:40.270> there<00:04:41.370> I've<00:04:42.370> wanted<00:04:42.729> to<00:04:42.849> make

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:43.000 
it mounted in there I've wanted to make

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.640 
it mounted in there I've wanted to make
this<00:04:43.120> as<00:04:43.330> simple<00:04:43.479> as<00:04:43.720> possible<00:04:43.900> so<00:04:44.199> I<00:04:44.409> just

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:44.650 
this as simple as possible so I just

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:49.170 
this as simple as possible so I just
took<00:04:44.830> a<00:04:44.889> long<00:04:45.759> GoPro<00:04:46.599> arm<00:04:46.870> and<00:04:47.729> it<00:04:48.729> just<00:04:48.940> kind

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:49.180 
took a long GoPro arm and it just kind

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:52.260 
took a long GoPro arm and it just kind
of<00:04:49.270> slides<00:04:50.110> on<00:04:50.380> on<00:04:50.620> the<00:04:50.800> shaft<00:04:51.070> the<00:04:51.820> shaft<00:04:51.849> is

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:52.270 
of slides on on the shaft the shaft is

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:55.159 
of slides on on the shaft the shaft is
keyed<00:04:52.570> on<00:04:52.780> one<00:04:53.020> side<00:04:53.229> so<00:04:53.710> that<00:04:53.979> that<00:04:54.400> keeps<00:04:54.699> the

00:04:55.159 --> 00:04:55.169 
keyed on one side so that that keeps the

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:58.620 
keyed on one side so that that keeps the
arm<00:04:56.169> from<00:04:56.620> spinning<00:04:57.070> on<00:04:57.280> the<00:04:57.310> shaft<00:04:57.610> so<00:04:58.449> that's

00:04:58.620 --> 00:04:58.630 
arm from spinning on the shaft so that's

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:03.180 
arm from spinning on the shaft so that's
the<00:04:58.810> basic<00:04:59.639> motion<00:05:00.639> of<00:05:00.789> the<00:05:00.909> mount<00:05:02.009> it's<00:05:03.009> just

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:03.190 
the basic motion of the mount it's just

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:07.170 
the basic motion of the mount it's just
a<00:05:03.400> smooth<00:05:03.849> arc<00:05:05.159> you<00:05:06.159> can<00:05:06.280> see<00:05:06.430> I<00:05:06.460> had<00:05:06.729> to<00:05:06.759> remove

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:07.180 
a smooth arc you can see I had to remove

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:08.939 
a smooth arc you can see I had to remove
some<00:05:07.509> material<00:05:07.599> down<00:05:08.110> here<00:05:08.320> so<00:05:08.560> that<00:05:08.710> it<00:05:08.800> would

00:05:08.939 --> 00:05:08.949 
some material down here so that it would

00:05:08.949 --> 00:05:12.270 
some material down here so that it would
clear<00:05:09.400> this<00:05:09.580> nut<00:05:10.000> and<00:05:10.620> so<00:05:11.620> you<00:05:11.680> just<00:05:11.800> put<00:05:11.919> it<00:05:12.130> on

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:12.280 
clear this nut and so you just put it on

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:15.060 
clear this nut and so you just put it on
and<00:05:12.550> then<00:05:12.669> I've<00:05:12.759> got<00:05:12.880> a<00:05:13.440> bolt<00:05:14.440> in<00:05:14.620> a<00:05:14.680> nut<00:05:14.889> and

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:15.070 
and then I've got a bolt in a nut and

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:17.520 
and then I've got a bolt in a nut and
you<00:05:15.130> just<00:05:15.250> tighten<00:05:15.550> it<00:05:15.580> up<00:05:15.699> and<00:05:15.969> that<00:05:16.840> keeps<00:05:17.409> it

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:17.530 
you just tighten it up and that keeps it

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:20.159 
you just tighten it up and that keeps it
on<00:05:17.620> there<00:05:17.860> okay<00:05:18.490> now<00:05:18.699> I've<00:05:18.940> got<00:05:18.969> it<00:05:19.120> bolted<00:05:20.050> on

00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:20.169 
on there okay now I've got it bolted on

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:23.430 
on there okay now I've got it bolted on
there<00:05:20.699> you<00:05:21.699> can<00:05:21.820> see<00:05:22.000> it's<00:05:22.180> still<00:05:22.419> not<00:05:22.840> real

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:23.440 
there you can see it's still not real

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:27.149 
there you can see it's still not real
secure<00:05:24.190> on<00:05:24.430> there<00:05:24.610> so<00:05:25.030> I<00:05:25.389> wanted<00:05:26.289> to<00:05:26.500> try<00:05:27.130> to

00:05:27.149 --> 00:05:27.159 
secure on there so I wanted to try to

00:05:27.159 --> 00:05:30.120 
secure on there so I wanted to try to
make<00:05:27.370> this<00:05:27.490> a<00:05:27.550> bulletproof<00:05:28.150> mount<00:05:28.570> so<00:05:28.930> I<00:05:29.199> bent

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:30.130 
make this a bulletproof mount so I bent

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:34.850 
make this a bulletproof mount so I bent
up<00:05:30.310> a<00:05:30.430> piece<00:05:30.610> of<00:05:30.759> sheet<00:05:30.940> metal<00:05:31.240> and<00:05:33.419> it's<00:05:34.419> just

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:34.860 
up a piece of sheet metal and it's just

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:38.910 
up a piece of sheet metal and it's just
through<00:05:35.860> bolts<00:05:36.310> with<00:05:36.880> some<00:05:37.090> some<00:05:37.930> long<00:05:38.139> screws

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:38.920 
through bolts with some some long screws

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:41.550 
through bolts with some some long screws
all<00:05:39.100> the<00:05:39.370> way<00:05:39.460> through<00:05:39.700> it<00:05:39.850> and<00:05:40.260> that<00:05:41.260> that

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:41.560 
all the way through it and that that

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:43.650 
all the way through it and that that
just<00:05:41.740> keeps<00:05:42.010> him<00:05:42.160> out<00:05:42.280> from<00:05:42.610> from<00:05:43.000> flexing<00:05:43.450> out

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:43.660 
just keeps him out from from flexing out

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:48.020 
just keeps him out from from flexing out
and<00:05:44.050> coming<00:05:44.590> off<00:05:44.770> the<00:05:44.890> shaft<00:05:45.210> I<00:05:46.260> thought<00:05:47.260> about

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:48.030 
and coming off the shaft I thought about

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:51.330 
and coming off the shaft I thought about
making<00:05:49.030> something<00:05:49.540> that<00:05:49.690> could<00:05:50.340> securely

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:51.340 
making something that could securely

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:54.180 
making something that could securely
clamp<00:05:52.240> on<00:05:52.450> to<00:05:52.540> the<00:05:52.630> shaft<00:05:52.900> but<00:05:53.650> I<00:05:53.710> wanted<00:05:54.100> to

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:54.190 
clamp on to the shaft but I wanted to

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:55.590 
clamp on to the shaft but I wanted to
make<00:05:54.310> this<00:05:54.430> something<00:05:54.640> that<00:05:54.820> other<00:05:55.240> people

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:55.600 
make this something that other people

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:57.540 
make this something that other people
could<00:05:55.750> build<00:05:55.870> easily<00:05:56.440> so<00:05:57.010> that's<00:05:57.130> why<00:05:57.310> I<00:05:57.340> chose

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:57.550 
could build easily so that's why I chose

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:01.850 
could build easily so that's why I chose
to<00:05:57.610> go<00:05:57.760> this<00:05:58.000> direction<00:05:58.350> so<00:05:59.670> this<00:06:00.750> just

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:01.860 
to go this direction so this just

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:04.530 
to go this direction so this just
threads<00:06:02.860> in<00:06:02.980> here<00:06:03.220> and<00:06:03.430> threads<00:06:03.670> through<00:06:04.030> so

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:04.540 
threads in here and threads through so

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:05.670 
threads in here and threads through so
I've<00:06:04.630> got<00:06:04.750> the<00:06:04.900> piece<00:06:05.200> of<00:06:05.320> sheet<00:06:05.530> metal

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:05.680 
I've got the piece of sheet metal

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:08.250 
I've got the piece of sheet metal
mounted<00:06:06.400> on<00:06:06.490> there<00:06:06.700> just<00:06:07.420> real<00:06:07.690> rudimentary

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:08.260 
mounted on there just real rudimentary

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.890 
mounted on there just real rudimentary
as<00:06:08.440> you<00:06:08.560> can<00:06:08.680> tell<00:06:08.860> just<00:06:09.580> through<00:06:10.210> bolted<00:06:10.570> and

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:10.900 
as you can tell just through bolted and

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:13.350 
as you can tell just through bolted and
then<00:06:11.080> snug<00:06:11.830> some<00:06:12.010> nuts<00:06:12.220> up<00:06:12.400> there<00:06:12.610> and<00:06:12.850> that

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:13.360 
then snug some nuts up there and that

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:15.510 
then snug some nuts up there and that
just<00:06:13.570> keeps<00:06:13.750> the<00:06:13.960> arm<00:06:14.230> from<00:06:14.590> coming<00:06:14.890> off<00:06:15.070> and

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:15.520 
just keeps the arm from coming off and

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:17.490 
just keeps the arm from coming off and
it<00:06:16.090> doesn't<00:06:16.270> really<00:06:16.480> provide<00:06:16.900> any<00:06:17.080> friction

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:17.500 
it doesn't really provide any friction

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:21.110 
it doesn't really provide any friction
so<00:06:17.950> it<00:06:17.980> it's<00:06:18.610> still<00:06:18.850> pivots<00:06:19.270> really<00:06:19.510> easily

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:21.120 
so it it's still pivots really easily

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:24.120 
so it it's still pivots really easily
obviously<00:06:22.120> the<00:06:22.270> GoPro<00:06:22.720> camera<00:06:23.530> cases<00:06:23.920> just

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:24.130 
obviously the GoPro camera cases just

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:28.350 
obviously the GoPro camera cases just
slide<00:06:24.370> on<00:06:24.400> like<00:06:24.730> normal<00:06:24.940> and<00:06:27.030> you<00:06:28.030> can<00:06:28.150> see

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:28.360 
slide on like normal and you can see

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:30.030 
slide on like normal and you can see
it's<00:06:28.570> it<00:06:28.900> doesn't<00:06:29.320> have<00:06:29.470> the<00:06:29.530> camera<00:06:29.860> in<00:06:29.920> there

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:30.040 
it's it doesn't have the camera in there

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:33.290 
it's it doesn't have the camera in there
but<00:06:30.220> it's<00:06:30.640> still<00:06:30.730> doing<00:06:31.390> its<00:06:31.630> function

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:33.300 
but it's still doing its function

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:37.130 
but it's still doing its function
I'm<00:06:34.300> not<00:06:34.510> -<00:06:34.720> a<00:06:34.750> lot<00:06:34.930> of<00:06:35.050> metal<00:06:35.380> objects<00:06:35.830> so<00:06:36.550> I

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:37.140 
I'm not - a lot of metal objects so I

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:41.820 
I'm not - a lot of metal objects so I
use<00:06:38.970> magnet<00:06:39.970> magnet<00:06:40.960> basis<00:06:41.350> you<00:06:41.650> can<00:06:41.740> get

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:41.830 
use magnet magnet basis you can get

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:43.380 
use magnet magnet basis you can get
these<00:06:41.920> at<00:06:42.100> Harbor<00:06:42.370> Freight<00:06:42.640> or<00:06:42.700> Hobby<00:06:43.240> Lobby

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:43.390 
these at Harbor Freight or Hobby Lobby

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:48.090 
these at Harbor Freight or Hobby Lobby
and<00:06:44.940> just<00:06:45.990> just<00:06:46.990> through<00:06:47.500> bolt<00:06:47.800> them<00:06:47.950> like

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:48.100 
and just just through bolt them like

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:51.450 
and just just through bolt them like
that<00:06:49.020> and<00:06:50.020> here<00:06:50.320> I've<00:06:50.410> got<00:06:50.440> it<00:06:50.620> back<00:06:51.280> together

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:51.460 
that and here I've got it back together

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:54.360 
that and here I've got it back together
with<00:06:51.910> the<00:06:51.940> magnets<00:06:52.360> mounted<00:06:52.950> you<00:06:53.950> need<00:06:54.160> these

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:54.370 
with the magnets mounted you need these

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:56.550 
with the magnets mounted you need these
spacers<00:06:54.910> these<00:06:55.150> are<00:06:55.270> just<00:06:55.420> nuts<00:06:55.750> over<00:06:56.260> the

00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:56.560 
spacers these are just nuts over the

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:58.500 
spacers these are just nuts over the
over<00:06:56.860> the<00:06:56.920> bolts<00:06:57.250> but<00:06:57.430> you<00:06:57.550> need<00:06:57.790> the<00:06:58.030> spacers

00:06:58.500 --> 00:06:58.510 
over the bolts but you need the spacers

00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:02.370 
over the bolts but you need the spacers
so<00:06:58.840> that<00:06:59.080> the<00:06:59.620> camera<00:07:00.750> when<00:07:01.750> it's<00:07:01.900> mounted<00:07:02.290> on

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:02.380 
so that the camera when it's mounted on

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:05.250 
so that the camera when it's mounted on
here<00:07:02.760> the<00:07:03.760> side<00:07:04.150> of<00:07:04.330> the<00:07:04.390> camera<00:07:04.630> will<00:07:04.930> clear

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:05.260 
here the side of the camera will clear

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:08.310 
here the side of the camera will clear
whatever<00:07:05.790> whatever<00:07:06.990> object<00:07:07.990> you're<00:07:08.140> mounting

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:08.320 
whatever whatever object you're mounting

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:12.480 
whatever whatever object you're mounting
it<00:07:08.530> to<00:07:08.670> so<00:07:10.320> I'm<00:07:11.320> mounting<00:07:11.710> to<00:07:11.860> a<00:07:11.890> lot<00:07:12.130> of<00:07:12.160> metal

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:12.490 
it to so I'm mounting to a lot of metal

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:14.190 
it to so I'm mounting to a lot of metal
stuff<00:07:12.700> like<00:07:12.850> I<00:07:12.880> said<00:07:13.150> but<00:07:13.540> you<00:07:13.720> might<00:07:13.930> want<00:07:14.140> to

00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:14.200 
stuff like I said but you might want to

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:16.380 
stuff like I said but you might want to
mount<00:07:14.380> this<00:07:14.530> to<00:07:14.940> different<00:07:15.940> objects<00:07:16.270> you

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:16.390 
mount this to different objects you

00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:19.260 
mount this to different objects you
could<00:07:16.540> put<00:07:16.750> you<00:07:17.650> clamps<00:07:18.190> on<00:07:18.340> here<00:07:18.880> or<00:07:18.970> you<00:07:19.180> know

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:19.270 
could put you clamps on here or you know

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:20.550 
could put you clamps on here or you know
just<00:07:19.510> mount<00:07:19.690> it<00:07:19.780> to<00:07:19.840> a<00:07:19.930> lot<00:07:20.110> of<00:07:20.230> different

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:20.560 
just mount it to a lot of different

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:24.720 
just mount it to a lot of different
things<00:07:21.100> so<00:07:21.480> use<00:07:22.480> your<00:07:22.660> imagination<00:07:23.320> and<00:07:23.730> you

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:24.730 
things so use your imagination and you
