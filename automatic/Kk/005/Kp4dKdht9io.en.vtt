comes to like DIY we often think of like

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.560 
comes to like DIY we often think of like
a<00:00:26.279> weekend<00:00:26.699> project<00:00:26.789> being<00:00:27.180> nothing<00:00:27.420> more

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
a weekend project being nothing more

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.000 
a weekend project being nothing more
than<00:00:27.840> perhaps<00:00:27.990> I<00:00:28.260> don't<00:00:28.680> know<00:00:28.740> a<00:00:28.769> lick<00:00:28.980> of

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
than perhaps I don't know a lick of

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.500 
than perhaps I don't know a lick of
paint<00:00:29.279> on<00:00:29.490> the<00:00:29.670> walls<00:00:29.849> but<00:00:30.179> we<00:00:30.330> wouldn't

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
paint on the walls but we wouldn't

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.510 
paint on the walls but we wouldn't
perhaps<00:00:30.720> think<00:00:31.170> that<00:00:31.320> with<00:00:31.470> change<00:00:32.340> our

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
perhaps think that with change our

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.160 
perhaps think that with change our
staircase<00:00:32.759> would<00:00:33.090> with<00:00:33.270> no<00:00:33.660> I<00:00:33.690> think<00:00:34.050> you're

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
staircase would with no I think you're

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.280 
staircase would with no I think you're
right<00:00:34.320> it<00:00:34.620> is<00:00:34.829> often<00:00:35.370> overlooked<00:00:36.059> yeah<00:00:36.360> and

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
right it is often overlooked yeah and

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.020 
right it is often overlooked yeah and
the<00:00:37.469> main<00:00:37.649> reasons<00:00:38.160> for<00:00:38.370> that<00:00:38.489> is<00:00:38.760> often

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
the main reasons for that is often

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.540 
the main reasons for that is often
people<00:00:39.329> think<00:00:39.480> spell<00:00:40.140> more<00:00:40.350> expensive<00:00:41.040> then

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
people think spell more expensive then

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.549 
people think spell more expensive then
actually<00:00:42.059> it<00:00:42.180> is<00:00:42.360> people<00:00:42.899> are<00:00:43.140> pleasantly

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
actually it is people are pleasantly

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.100 
actually it is people are pleasantly
surprised<00:00:44.070> about<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.700> price<00:00:45.000> and<00:00:45.390> also

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
surprised about the price and also

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.900 
surprised about the price and also
people<00:00:46.770> think<00:00:47.070> it's<00:00:47.160> a<00:00:47.219> lot<00:00:47.340> more<00:00:47.370> complex

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
people think it's a lot more complex

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.990 
people think it's a lot more complex
than<00:00:48.149> it<00:00:48.390> actually<00:00:48.629> really<00:00:49.170> is<00:00:49.379> and<00:00:50.000> simply

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
than it actually really is and simply

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.970 
than it actually really is and simply
it's<00:00:51.239> about<00:00:51.449> awareness<00:00:51.750> people<00:00:52.710> are<00:00:52.829> not

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
it's about awareness people are not

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.900 
it's about awareness people are not
aware<00:00:53.270> of<00:00:54.270> all<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.320> off-the-shelf<00:00:56.309> options

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
aware of all the off-the-shelf options

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.090 
aware of all the off-the-shelf options
which<00:00:57.390> which<00:00:57.690> are<00:00:57.899> available<00:00:58.050> yeah<00:00:58.859> sure<00:00:59.070> I

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
which which are available yeah sure I

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.349 
which which are available yeah sure I
think<00:00:59.399> people<00:00:59.520> probably<00:00:59.760> have<00:00:59.940> an<00:01:00.000> idea<00:01:00.239> that

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
think people probably have an idea that

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:01.939 
think people probably have an idea that
it's<00:01:00.480> structurally<00:01:01.199> part<00:01:01.440> your<00:01:01.620> home<00:01:01.770> and

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
it's structurally part your home and

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:02.900 
it's structurally part your home and
it's<00:01:02.070> something<00:01:02.219> that<00:01:02.309> honor<00:01:02.550> you<00:01:02.699> can't

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
it's something that honor you can't

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.399 
it's something that honor you can't
touch<00:01:03.030> that<00:01:03.090> it's<00:01:03.480> like<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:03.989> walls<00:01:04.140> or<00:01:04.379> the

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
touch that it's like the walls or the

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.260 
touch that it's like the walls or the
roof<00:01:04.619> you<00:01:04.860> leave<00:01:05.010> that<00:01:05.159> alone<00:01:05.250> yeah<00:01:05.850> you're

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
roof you leave that alone yeah you're

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.380 
roof you leave that alone yeah you're
right<00:01:06.479> it's<00:01:06.900> it's<00:01:07.229> just<00:01:07.770> about<00:01:08.100> changing<00:01:08.970> the

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
right it's it's just about changing the

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.330 
right it's it's just about changing the
guarding<00:01:09.930> on<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.200> side<00:01:10.409> of<00:01:10.439> your<00:01:10.650> stairs<00:01:11.010> it's

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
guarding on the side of your stairs it's

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.649 
guarding on the side of your stairs it's
not<00:01:11.520> about<00:01:11.820> ripping<00:01:12.210> out<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.510> whole

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
not about ripping out the whole

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.810 
not about ripping out the whole
staircase<00:01:13.020> right<00:01:13.740> I<00:01:14.010> what<00:01:14.400> sort<00:01:14.640> of<00:01:14.670> you<00:01:14.760> know

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
staircase right I what sort of you know

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.429 
staircase right I what sort of you know
how<00:01:15.030> can<00:01:15.299> it<00:01:15.390> transform<00:01:15.900> you<00:01:15.990> and<00:01:16.020> what<00:01:16.259> kind

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
how can it transform you and what kind

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.740 
how can it transform you and what kind
of<00:01:16.500> effect<00:01:17.070> can<00:01:17.340> you<00:01:17.430> have<00:01:17.640> well<00:01:18.150> I<00:01:18.180> think<00:01:18.330> the

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
of effect can you have well I think the

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.840 
of effect can you have well I think the
first<00:01:18.930> thing<00:01:19.110> is<00:01:19.290> we<00:01:19.590> often<00:01:20.100> think<00:01:20.130> it's<00:01:20.700> the

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
first thing is we often think it's the

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.280 
first thing is we often think it's the
first<00:01:21.090> thing<00:01:21.210> you<00:01:21.420> see<00:01:21.630> when<00:01:21.659> you<00:01:21.869> walk<00:01:22.080> in

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
first thing you see when you walk in

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.870 
first thing you see when you walk in
through<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.530> home<00:01:22.799> so<00:01:23.130> why<00:01:23.280> wouldn't<00:01:23.640> you

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
through the home so why wouldn't you

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.810 
through the home so why wouldn't you
change<00:01:24.240> it<00:01:24.540> and<00:01:24.720> I<00:01:25.200> think<00:01:25.259> also<00:01:25.770> these<00:01:26.549> days

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
change it and I think also these days

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.230 
change it and I think also these days
rooms<00:01:27.330> are<00:01:27.540> getting<00:01:28.049> smaller<00:01:28.350> yeah<00:01:29.009> and<00:01:29.240> it

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
rooms are getting smaller yeah and it

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.450 
rooms are getting smaller yeah and it
can<00:01:30.509> give<00:01:30.840> an<00:01:31.110> illusion<00:01:31.560> of<00:01:31.680> space<00:01:31.979> especially

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
can give an illusion of space especially

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.480 
can give an illusion of space especially
if<00:01:33.060> you<00:01:33.210> use<00:01:33.240> something<00:01:33.900> like<00:01:33.930> glass<00:01:34.439> so<00:01:35.220> can

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
if you use something like glass so can

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.179 
if you use something like glass so can
make<00:01:35.700> a<00:01:35.729> roommate<00:01:36.390> feel<00:01:36.720> a<00:01:37.020> lot<00:01:37.680> lot<00:01:37.920> bigger

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
make a roommate feel a lot lot bigger
