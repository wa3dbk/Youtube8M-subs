00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:15.450
 welcome to episode four th 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.390
 very last of well in any case 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.430
 from this series of the swimmer who succeeds 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.010

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.390
 girl and despite all want about her 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.279
 I still think it is said 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.260
 where a beautiful woman and she work 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.810
 sick every day tip-top out and find that 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.340
 I really worth a compliment and I can 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.440
 remember typical honor with her 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.690
 blonde hair and would also like makeup 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.250
 and me too so i thought i choose lock of hair 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.780
 I really think her the red carpet 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.860
 often mood 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.690
 it is very important for this 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.300
 look that everything is very louis and shiny 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.950
 is a bit so theologian and to have 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.300
 chosen to have a lot of liquid product and 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.430
 use queen products instead 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.050
 of powder product have a start with the 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.789
 Bourjois Foundation helps that mix that 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.980
 is actually known for its glow and 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.289
 it really stays all day without having to 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.600
 who picks up and then I have one 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:03.359
 bronzer uses from neck the goal number 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.760
 someone shine and a bronzer sylvie lengths 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.920
 what the best are no she does 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.330
 so go a lot to the sun and or 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.770
 objects of free time 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.140
 always quite a sub-box 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:16.380
 look so I've done that too now 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:19.290
 and then I have orgasm with the nars 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.060
 miss ingram fair I have my blush on 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.500
 my cheeks don't do any powder either 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.060
 product is but again a cream blush 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.920
 I spread 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.630
 then i went further and my eyes i 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.920
 already let me slide you for it 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.350
 we can do to do you have to 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.820
 see what is best for yourself 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.799
 and then I actually started 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.540
 go with my pallet I have 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.950
 then first color the puppy 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.720
 used and just with a brush and 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.549
 line under my eyes and above 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.470
 my eyes and the reason that with one 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.880
 brush is done so that the line 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.369
 which becomes wider because it is all necessary 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.930
 not so very careful then 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.790
 with half a stream it color my whole 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.280
 eyelid and also colored the top 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.390
 that is really the golden color and then have 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.890
 I still with sidecar 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.780
 the outside and some more and touch 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.869
 data that it is just now you 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.100
 a little clearer follows 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.110
 I'm going to work with the eye pencil 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.210
 and then with an eye pencil 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.340
 I have the inside of my waterline 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.950
 colored in for an extra smokey extra 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:13.709
 and making violent and then blue 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.300
 my the fake eyelashes and those fake eyelashes 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:18.600
 also from the hema i've read the son neck 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:20.280
 litters chosen and I just think so 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:23.610
 good if the starter is a bit thicker and that 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:26.130
 that upwards what yes not so whole 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.950
 present just 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.880
 He walks slowly around I would say 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.470
 and then I still have my 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.270
 eyebrow neatly combed a little bit 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.950
 I signed a brush, but they do have to 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:36.480
 not to be very striking 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.700
 and I finished my last work 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.959
 with a lip gloss and that lip gloss is from 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.660
 mac one is the lemon 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:44.700
 it is a lip gloss and yes this state 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.310
 just to know one that is very light one 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.800
 bit of a baby child but be bad 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:51.269
 so nice that we like it 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.920
 these were our four celebrity looks 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:54.000
 if you think I want too 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.650
 actually a look of the celebrity 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.440
