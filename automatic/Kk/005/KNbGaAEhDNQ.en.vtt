00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590 
little bit about the changes that happen

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:28.170 
little bit about the changes that happen
from<00:01:26.920> a<00:01:27.160> wellness<00:01:27.580> and<00:01:27.760> a<00:01:27.790> health<00:01:27.970> perspective

from a wellness and a health perspective
for<00:01:28.750> these<00:01:28.900> kids<00:01:29.170> but<00:01:29.560> there's<00:01:30.130> also<00:01:30.430> other

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:30.850 
for these kids but there's also other

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:32.460 
for these kids but there's also other
changes<00:01:31.360> that<00:01:31.510> happen<00:01:31.870> in<00:01:32.020> around<00:01:32.320> their

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:32.470 
changes that happen in around their

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:34.620 
changes that happen in around their
academics<00:01:33.130> and<00:01:33.340> also<00:01:33.700> in<00:01:34.000> kind<00:01:34.300> of<00:01:34.390> who<00:01:34.510> they

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:34.630 
academics and also in kind of who they

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:36.180 
academics and also in kind of who they
are<00:01:34.660> in<00:01:34.930> the<00:01:35.020> world<00:01:35.050> right<00:01:35.890> well

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:36.190 
are in the world right well

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:37.980 
are in the world right well
self-confidence<00:01:37.060> obviously<00:01:37.540> is<00:01:37.630> a<00:01:37.660> huge

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990 
self-confidence obviously is a huge

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:39.690 
self-confidence obviously is a huge
issue<00:01:38.170> for<00:01:38.620> children<00:01:39.250> as<00:01:39.370> they're<00:01:39.490> trying<00:01:39.670> to

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700 
issue for children as they're trying to

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.040 
issue for children as they're trying to
find<00:01:39.910> their<00:01:40.060> way<00:01:40.300> and<00:01:40.540> who<00:01:40.660> they<00:01:40.810> are<00:01:40.930> and

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:41.050 
find their way and who they are and

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:42.870 
find their way and who they are and
their<00:01:41.170> identity<00:01:41.680> but<00:01:42.130> we're<00:01:42.460> starting<00:01:42.790> to

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 
their identity but we're starting to

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.460 
their identity but we're starting to
really<00:01:43.060> see<00:01:43.360> in<00:01:43.540> the<00:01:43.660> research<00:01:44.020> is<00:01:44.200> really

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:44.470 
really see in the research is really

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:46.650 
really see in the research is really
just<00:01:44.740> there's<00:01:45.430> is<00:01:45.640> very<00:01:45.910> limited<00:01:46.150> but<00:01:46.540> we're

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:46.660 
just there's is very limited but we're

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:48.750 
just there's is very limited but we're
starting<00:01:46.960> to<00:01:47.050> understand<00:01:47.500> the<00:01:48.100> link<00:01:48.670> between

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:48.760 
starting to understand the link between

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:51.450 
starting to understand the link between
the<00:01:49.450> mind<00:01:49.690> of<00:01:49.900> the<00:01:49.990> body<00:01:50.200> between<00:01:50.710> physical

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.460 
the mind of the body between physical

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.390 
the mind of the body between physical
and<00:01:51.810> academics<00:01:52.810> obviously<00:01:53.650> if<00:01:53.770> a<00:01:53.860> child<00:01:54.100> can

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:54.400 
and academics obviously if a child can

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.060 
and academics obviously if a child can
move<00:01:54.610> more<00:01:54.940> and<00:01:54.970> get<00:01:55.240> that<00:01:55.330> oxygen<00:01:55.570> going<00:01:56.170> and

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.070 
move more and get that oxygen going and

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:58.680 
move more and get that oxygen going and
the<00:01:57.490> right<00:01:57.700> the<00:01:57.910> right<00:01:57.940> and<00:01:58.210> the<00:01:58.270> left<00:01:58.300> brain

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:58.690 
the right the right and the left brain

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:00.810 
the right the right and the left brain
going<00:01:59.110> that<00:01:59.740> they're<00:01:59.920> going<00:02:00.220> to<00:02:00.310> do<00:02:00.460> better<00:02:00.670> on

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:00.820 
going that they're going to do better on

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:02.550

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:03.930 
their math tests and they're going to do
better<00:02:02.770> in<00:02:03.100> science<00:02:03.490> they're<00:02:03.670> going<00:02:03.790> to<00:02:03.850> be

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:03.940 
better in science they're going to be

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:05.460 
better in science they're going to be
more<00:02:04.090> engaged<00:02:04.450> in<00:02:04.690> class<00:02:04.900> we're<00:02:05.140> going<00:02:05.260> to<00:02:05.320> see

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.470 
more engaged in class we're going to see

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.560 
more engaged in class we're going to see
less<00:02:05.680> absenteeism<00:02:06.100> and<00:02:06.880> so<00:02:07.240> we're<00:02:07.360> really

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:07.570 
less absenteeism and so we're really

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:09.809 
less absenteeism and so we're really
starting<00:02:07.750> to<00:02:08.019> see<00:02:08.200> the<00:02:08.470> efforts<00:02:08.979> of<00:02:09.069> that<00:02:09.280> so

00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:09.819 
starting to see the efforts of that so

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:12.449 
starting to see the efforts of that so
getting<00:02:10.239> the<00:02:10.420> body<00:02:10.539> moving<00:02:11.080> goes<00:02:11.709> way<00:02:12.099> beyond

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
getting the body moving goes way beyond

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:14.430 
getting the body moving goes way beyond
anything<00:02:12.909> it<00:02:13.420> really<00:02:13.930> does<00:02:14.110> have<00:02:14.230> anything

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
anything it really does have anything

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.020 
anything it really does have anything
you<00:02:14.590> need<00:02:14.739> to<00:02:14.769> do<00:02:14.980> with<00:02:15.129> weight<00:02:15.370> loss<00:02:15.400> it<00:02:15.849> has

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
you need to do with weight loss it has

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.110 
you need to do with weight loss it has
to<00:02:16.840> do<00:02:16.989> with<00:02:17.260> the<00:02:17.560> feeling<00:02:18.159> that<00:02:18.459> you<00:02:18.580> get<00:02:18.849> from

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
to do with the feeling that you get from

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.080 
to do with the feeling that you get from
moving<00:02:19.659> your<00:02:19.810> body<00:02:19.959> in<00:02:20.380> a<00:02:20.500> way<00:02:20.680> that<00:02:21.069> is<00:02:21.370> brings

aspect into life

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.350 
aspect into life
then<00:02:26.110> obviously<00:02:26.560> the<00:02:26.950> spirituality<00:02:27.580> of<00:02:27.700> that

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
then obviously the spirituality of that

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.690 
then obviously the spirituality of that
mind-body-spirit<00:02:29.320> connection<00:02:29.740> awesome<00:02:30.490> and

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
mind-body-spirit connection awesome and

so you know when you're working with

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:34.200 
so you know when you're working with
these<00:02:32.890> kids<00:02:33.130> you've<00:02:33.550> got<00:02:33.730> two<00:02:33.940> school

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:56.350 
kids come into PE class and they get

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:58.640 
kids come into PE class and they get
wired<00:02:56.650> up<00:02:56.890> basically<00:02:57.310> although<00:02:57.730> the<00:02:57.880> the<00:02:58.360> real

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
wired up basically although the the real

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.510 
wired up basically although the the real
wireless<00:02:59.650> system<00:02:59.980> is<00:03:00.070> right<00:03:00.190> here<00:03:00.400> inside

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:00.520 
wireless system is right here inside

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:01.740 
wireless system is right here inside
their<00:03:00.820> body<00:03:01.000> of<00:03:01.150> course<00:03:01.420> you<00:03:01.480> through<00:03:01.660> their

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
their body of course you through their

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.570 
their body of course you through their
veins<00:03:01.900> but<00:03:02.620> they<00:03:02.770> come<00:03:02.950> in<00:03:03.070> and<00:03:03.220> they<00:03:03.310> put<00:03:03.460> on<00:03:03.550> a

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 
veins but they come in and they put on a

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.010 
veins but they come in and they put on a
piece<00:03:03.820> of<00:03:03.850> equipment<00:03:04.210> a<00:03:04.690> heart<00:03:04.870> rate<00:03:04.960> monitor

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:05.020 
piece of equipment a heart rate monitor

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:07.860 
piece of equipment a heart rate monitor
and<00:03:05.650> they<00:03:06.490> love<00:03:06.790> it<00:03:06.820> it's<00:03:07.150> again<00:03:07.540> it's<00:03:07.570> where

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
they live their lives technology is so

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.330 
they live their lives technology is so
integrating<00:03:10.510> ingrained<00:03:11.260> in<00:03:11.470> them<00:03:11.650> so<00:03:12.070> to<00:03:12.130> come

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
integrating ingrained in them so to come

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.820 
integrating ingrained in them so to come
into<00:03:12.460> PE<00:03:12.670> class<00:03:13.000> and<00:03:13.330> run<00:03:13.990> around<00:03:14.110> I'll<00:03:14.620> go<00:03:14.770> to

into PE class and run around I'll go to

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:17.040 
into PE class and run around I'll go to
some<00:03:15.010> of<00:03:15.070> my<00:03:15.130> pilot<00:03:15.550> schools<00:03:15.820> and<00:03:16.180> have<00:03:16.930> the

some of my pilot schools and have the
kids<00:03:17.200> yell<00:03:17.470> out<00:03:17.590> their<00:03:17.710> heart<00:03:17.890> rate<00:03:18.040> monitor

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
kids yell out their heart rate monitor

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.690 
kids yell out their heart rate monitor
and<00:03:18.730> their<00:03:19.150> heart<00:03:19.360> rate<00:03:19.540> and<00:03:19.780> 182<00:03:20.710> they'll

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
and their heart rate and 182 they'll

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.340 
and their heart rate and 182 they'll
come<00:03:21.880> and<00:03:22.030> run<00:03:22.150> faster<00:03:22.630> and<00:03:22.660> they<00:03:23.020> start<00:03:23.260> to

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:23.350 
come and run faster and they start to

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:24.870 
come and run faster and they start to
get<00:03:23.470> in<00:03:23.560> a<00:03:23.620> little<00:03:23.770> bit<00:03:23.860> of<00:03:23.920> a<00:03:23.980> competition<00:03:24.310> or

science let's throw a few more science
questions<00:04:25.030> at<00:04:25.180> him<00:04:25.390> he<00:04:25.930> starts<00:04:26.169> answering

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.380 
questions at him he starts answering

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:28.110 
questions at him he starts answering
them<00:04:26.800> without<00:04:27.100> even<00:04:27.340> really<00:04:27.490> knowing<00:04:27.610> that

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.120 
them without even really knowing that

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.140 
them without even really knowing that
he's<00:04:28.330> answering<00:04:28.780> the<00:04:28.930> questions<00:04:29.410> and

he's answering the questions and
bringing<00:04:31.150> in<00:04:31.270> that<00:04:31.450> movement<00:04:31.750> in<00:04:32.200> physical

00:04:32.909 --> 00:04:32.919 
bringing in that movement in physical

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:34.800 
bringing in that movement in physical
education<00:04:32.980> at<00:04:33.430> the<00:04:33.490> same<00:04:33.669> time<00:04:33.880> just

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:34.810 
education at the same time just

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:36.780 
education at the same time just
solidifying<00:04:35.320> that<00:04:35.740> foundation<00:04:36.310> that's

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:36.790 
solidifying that foundation that's

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:39.390 
solidifying that foundation that's
awesome<00:04:37.210> so<00:04:37.450> you<00:04:37.510> know<00:04:37.810> kids<00:04:38.110> healthier

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.400 
awesome so you know kids healthier

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.999 
awesome so you know kids healthier
doing<00:04:39.610> better<00:04:39.790> in<00:04:40.060> school<00:04:40.090> right<00:04:40.990> so<00:04:41.320> she

00:04:41.999 --> 00:04:42.009 
doing better in school right so she

00:04:42.009 --> 00:04:43.800 
doing better in school right so she
might<00:04:42.310> have<00:04:42.790> a<00:04:42.850> little<00:04:43.210> bit<00:04:43.449> something

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:43.810 
might have a little bit something

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:46.110 
might have a little bit something
different<00:04:44.620> go<00:04:44.740> on<00:04:44.919> in<00:04:45.250> her<00:04:45.460> interaction<00:04:46.090> with

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:46.120 
different go on in her interaction with

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.360 
different go on in her interaction with
other<00:04:46.389> kids<00:04:46.660> and<00:04:47.080> an<00:04:47.350> interaction<00:04:48.160> with<00:04:48.280> the

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:48.370 
other kids and an interaction with the

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:50.100 
other kids and an interaction with the
teachers<00:04:48.699> are<00:04:48.729> perhaps<00:04:49.210> interaction<00:04:49.990> with

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:50.110 
teachers are perhaps interaction with

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:51.990 
teachers are perhaps interaction with
the<00:04:50.229> family<00:04:50.650> of<00:04:50.680> you<00:04:50.919> heard<00:04:51.460> anything<00:04:51.669> about

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 
the family of you heard anything about

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.390 
the family of you heard anything about
that<00:04:52.360> as<00:04:52.630> well<00:04:52.780> yeah<00:04:53.229> it<00:04:53.470> one<00:04:54.039> of<00:04:54.130> the<00:04:54.190> biggest

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:54.400 
that as well yeah it one of the biggest

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:56.129 
that as well yeah it one of the biggest
benefits<00:04:55.060> of<00:04:55.270> the<00:04:55.419> program<00:04:55.600> that<00:04:55.900> we're<00:04:56.020> doing

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:56.139 
benefits of the program that we're doing

00:04:56.139 --> 00:04:57.629 
benefits of the program that we're doing
and<00:04:56.440> we're<00:04:56.530> halfway<00:04:56.740> through<00:04:56.919> this<00:04:57.190> pilot

00:04:57.629 --> 00:04:57.639 
and we're halfway through this pilot

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:00.689 
and we're halfway through this pilot
it'll<00:04:58.419> end<00:04:58.660> in<00:04:58.810> May<00:04:59.020> of<00:04:59.199> two<00:04:59.350> thousand<00:04:59.830> of<00:05:00.340> 10

00:05:00.689 --> 00:05:00.699 
it'll end in May of two thousand of 10

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:03.029 
it'll end in May of two thousand of 10
and<00:05:01.080> just<00:05:02.080> looking<00:05:02.289> at<00:05:02.410> the<00:05:02.470> results<00:05:02.620> from<00:05:02.919> our

00:05:03.029 --> 00:05:03.039 
and just looking at the results from our

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:05.370 
and just looking at the results from our
Texas<00:05:03.430> State<00:05:03.610> researchers<00:05:04.210> yeah<00:05:04.930> it's<00:05:05.199> about

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:05.380 
Texas State researchers yeah it's about

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:06.900 
Texas State researchers yeah it's about
getting<00:05:05.530> kids<00:05:05.830> healthy<00:05:06.310> but<00:05:06.580> the<00:05:06.669> biggest

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:06.910 
getting kids healthy but the biggest

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:08.760 
getting kids healthy but the biggest
thing<00:05:07.150> we're<00:05:07.539> seeing<00:05:07.780> is<00:05:07.930> the<00:05:08.139> behavioral

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:08.770 
thing we're seeing is the behavioral

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:11.249 
thing we're seeing is the behavioral
changes<00:05:09.220> the<00:05:09.370> self-confidence<00:05:09.970> the<00:05:10.479> again

00:05:11.249 --> 00:05:11.259 
changes the self-confidence the again

00:05:11.259 --> 00:05:13.350 
changes the self-confidence the again
the<00:05:11.340> empowerment<00:05:12.340> and<00:05:12.520> when<00:05:13.090> I<00:05:13.120> say

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:13.360 
the empowerment and when I say

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.290 
the empowerment and when I say
spirituality<00:05:14.289> all<00:05:14.669> spirituality<00:05:15.669> is<00:05:15.850> is

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:16.300 
spirituality all spirituality is is

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:18.810 
spirituality all spirituality is is
getting<00:05:16.750> to<00:05:16.900> know<00:05:17.050> yourself<00:05:17.229> first<00:05:18.010> and<00:05:18.250> then

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:18.820 
getting to know yourself first and then

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:21.180 
getting to know yourself first and then
building<00:05:19.210> a<00:05:19.330> support<00:05:19.780> team<00:05:19.990> around<00:05:20.260> that<00:05:20.919> to

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:21.190 
building a support team around that to

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:23.939 
building a support team around that to
sustain<00:05:21.669> that<00:05:22.090> health<00:05:22.750> and<00:05:22.960> fitness<00:05:23.110> so<00:05:23.830> if

00:05:23.939 --> 00:05:23.949 
sustain that health and fitness so if
