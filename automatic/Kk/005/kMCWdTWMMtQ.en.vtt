00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:57.430 
explosive like c4 grenades sent texts

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:59.730 
explosive like c4 grenades sent texts
all<00:01:57.610> that<00:01:57.760> stuff<00:01:58.060> and<00:01:58.270> it<00:01:58.840> ended<00:01:59.170> really<00:01:59.410> it's

00:01:59.730 --> 00:01:59.740 
all that stuff and it ended really it's

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.370 
all that stuff and it ended really it's
the<00:02:00.670> number<00:02:00.970> one<00:02:01.000> thing<00:02:01.420> for<00:02:01.810> this<00:02:01.900> class<00:02:02.170> that

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
the number one thing for this class that

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.350 
the number one thing for this class that
I'd<00:02:02.470> lose<00:02:02.680> killstreaks<00:02:03.160> for<00:02:03.400> so<00:02:03.940> if<00:02:04.120> you<00:02:04.210> want

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 
I'd lose killstreaks for so if you want

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:05.820 
I'd lose killstreaks for so if you want
to<00:02:04.390> slap<00:02:04.600> on<00:02:04.810> flat<00:02:05.110> Jack<00:02:05.320> and<00:02:05.470> I<00:02:05.500> said<00:02:05.650> of<00:02:05.740> that

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:05.830 
to slap on flat Jack and I said of that

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.550 
to slap on flat Jack and I said of that
hard<00:02:06.040> line<00:02:06.250> go<00:02:06.490> ahead<00:02:06.790> but<00:02:07.060> uh<00:02:07.200> one<00:02:08.200> thing<00:02:08.380> why

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
hard line go ahead but uh one thing why

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.210 
hard line go ahead but uh one thing why
use<00:02:08.830> a<00:02:09.510> hard<00:02:10.510> line<00:02:10.720> is<00:02:10.900> Piazza<00:02:11.200> orbitals<00:02:11.800> they

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
use a hard line is Piazza orbitals they

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.550 
use a hard line is Piazza orbitals they
take<00:02:12.460> ten<00:02:12.670> killed<00:02:12.940> instead<00:02:13.150> of<00:02:13.270> 13<00:02:13.690> and<00:02:13.870> that's

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
take ten killed instead of 13 and that's

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.400 
take ten killed instead of 13 and that's
a<00:02:14.650> huge<00:02:14.950> advantage<00:02:15.190> because<00:02:16.200> most<00:02:17.200> of<00:02:17.290> the

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
a huge advantage because most of the

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.080 
a huge advantage because most of the
time<00:02:17.650> it'll<00:02:18.010> be<00:02:18.130> really<00:02:18.460> hard<00:02:18.760> to<00:02:18.820> get<00:02:18.970> that

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
time it'll be really hard to get that

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.990 
time it'll be really hard to get that

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:24.460 
that stuff without an orbital because

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:26.130 
that stuff without an orbital because
pretty<00:02:24.640> much<00:02:24.730> once<00:02:25.480> you<00:02:25.570> get<00:02:25.660> to<00:02:25.720> orbital

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
pretty much once you get to orbital

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.100 
pretty much once you get to orbital
that's<00:02:26.350> like<00:02:27.090> snap<00:02:28.090> you're<00:02:28.330> done<00:02:28.540> like<00:02:29.020> you

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
that's like snap you're done like you

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:30.960 
that's like snap you're done like you

just wait for people to come to you get

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:32.070 
just wait for people to come to you get
all<00:02:31.060> those<00:02:31.150> kill<00:02:31.390> streaks<00:02:31.660> and<00:02:31.810> you're<00:02:31.930> done

all those kill streaks and you're done

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.840 
all those kill streaks and you're done
you<00:02:32.560> get<00:02:32.680> those<00:02:32.860> kill<00:02:33.100> streaks<00:02:33.340> and<00:02:33.460> usually

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
you get those kill streaks and usually

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:35.670 
you get those kill streaks and usually
once<00:02:34.420> you<00:02:34.510> get<00:02:34.630> an<00:02:34.720> overall<00:02:35.020> your<00:02:35.230> teammate

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.270 
picks up another orbital and then just

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:40.260 
picks up another orbital and then just
announced<00:02:37.780> a<00:02:38.160> non-stop<00:02:39.160> cycle<00:02:39.580> of<00:02:39.700> killing

these<00:02:44.170> killstreaks<00:02:44.710> is<00:02:44.860> up<00:02:45.660> black<00:02:46.660> hats<00:02:47.010> I

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
these killstreaks is up black hats I

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.580 
these killstreaks is up black hats I
have<00:02:48.760> black<00:02:49.030> hats<00:02:49.300> because<00:02:49.570> if<00:02:49.870> you<00:02:50.350> hack

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
have black hats because if you hack

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.650 
have black hats because if you hack
enemy<00:02:51.010> equipments<00:02:51.610> UAV<00:02:51.940> almost<00:02:52.390> anything

enemy equipments UAV almost anything

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.380 
enemy equipments UAV almost anything
that's<00:02:53.280> that's<00:02:54.280> why<00:02:54.430> i<00:02:54.459> use<00:02:54.610> engineer<00:02:55.030> to<00:02:55.180> find

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
that's that's why i use engineer to find

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.060 
that's that's why i use engineer to find
all<00:02:55.510> the<00:02:55.630> equipment<00:02:56.050> almost<00:02:56.560> anything<00:02:56.860> you

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.070 
all the equipment almost anything you

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:00.720 
all the equipment almost anything you
can<00:02:57.550> hack<00:02:57.760> and<00:02:58.030> get<00:02:58.240> 50<00:02:58.660> 20<00:02:59.560> points<00:02:59.980> hundred

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
can hack and get 50 20 points hundred

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:02.699 
can hack and get 50 20 points hundred
points<00:03:00.880> or<00:03:01.240> 75<00:03:01.690> points<00:03:01.930> of<00:03:02.170> paint<00:03:02.350> on<00:03:02.410> what

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709 
points or 75 points of paint on what

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:05.190 
points or 75 points of paint on what
you're<00:03:02.830> taking<00:03:03.100> down<00:03:03.250> and<00:03:03.490> i<00:03:04.330> have<00:03:04.630> scavengers

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
you're taking down and i have scavengers

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.750 
you're taking down and i have scavengers
so<00:03:05.350> i<00:03:05.410> can<00:03:05.650> keep<00:03:05.800> doing<00:03:05.860> that<00:03:06.220> over<00:03:06.280> and<00:03:06.580> over

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
so i can keep doing that over and over

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.550 
so i can keep doing that over and over
and<00:03:06.940> over<00:03:07.090> so<00:03:07.660> i<00:03:07.750> kept<00:03:07.930> getting<00:03:07.959> kill<00:03:08.350> streaks

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
and over so i kept getting kill streaks

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:09.420 
and over so i kept getting kill streaks
like<00:03:08.620> right<00:03:08.860> now<00:03:09.010> i'm<00:03:09.100> going<00:03:09.190> to<00:03:09.280> show<00:03:09.400> you

most of the equipment i hack was going

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.730 
most of the equipment i hack was going
red<00:04:03.390> if<00:04:04.390> you're<00:04:04.570> going<00:04:04.690> to<00:04:04.750> use<00:04:04.900> black<00:04:05.170> hat<00:04:05.440> or
