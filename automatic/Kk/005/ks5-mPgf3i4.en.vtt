overclocked solid state drives what does

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.630 
overclocked solid state drives what does
that<00:00:47.640> mean<00:00:48.440> well<00:00:49.440> ok<00:00:49.860> so<00:00:49.920> for<00:00:50.309> solid-state

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
that mean well ok so for solid-state

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.189 
that mean well ok so for solid-state
drive<00:00:50.879> it<00:00:51.000> works<00:00:51.149> kind<00:00:51.449> of<00:00:51.510> similar<00:00:51.719> to<00:00:51.870> video

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
drive it works kind of similar to video

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:53.959 
drive it works kind of similar to video
card<00:00:52.410> overclocking<00:00:52.949> so<00:00:53.399> you<00:00:53.489> have<00:00:53.610> like<00:00:53.760> your

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
card overclocking so you have like your

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.670 
card overclocking so you have like your
GPU<00:00:54.480> clock<00:00:54.870> speed<00:00:55.230> and<00:00:55.379> then<00:00:55.469> you<00:00:55.530> have<00:00:55.649> your

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
GPU clock speed and then you have your

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.799 
GPU clock speed and then you have your
memory<00:00:56.070> bandwidth<00:00:56.610> kind<00:00:57.149> of<00:00:57.239> specs<00:00:57.510> for<00:00:57.750> a

video card some kind of thing happens
inside<00:00:59.850> nessus<00:01:00.149> do<00:01:00.239> you<00:01:00.329> have<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.570> SSD

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
inside nessus do you have the SSD

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.959 
inside nessus do you have the SSD
controller<00:01:01.500> that<00:01:02.219> has<00:01:02.430> a<00:01:02.460> certain<00:01:02.789> frequency

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
controller that has a certain frequency

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.789 
controller that has a certain frequency
its<00:01:03.329> operating<00:01:03.719> at<00:01:03.840> and<00:01:04.019> then<00:01:04.290> you<00:01:04.379> have<00:01:04.530> the

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
its operating at and then you have the

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.560 
its operating at and then you have the
bus<00:01:05.129> work<00:01:05.400> that<00:01:05.670> connects<00:01:06.030> that<00:01:06.210> controller

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
bus work that connects that controller

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.990 
bus work that connects that controller
to<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:06.840> flash<00:01:07.409> chips<00:01:07.740> and<00:01:08.010> that<00:01:08.189> works<00:01:08.400> at<00:01:08.729> a

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
to the flash chips and that works at a

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.359 
to the flash chips and that works at a
separate<00:01:09.420> frequency<00:01:09.869> as<00:01:09.960> well<00:01:10.140> so<00:01:10.380> until<00:01:11.159> went

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
separate frequency as well so until went

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.330 
separate frequency as well so until went
from<00:01:11.520> 83<00:01:12.180> to<00:01:12.360> 100<00:01:12.780> megahertz<00:01:13.020> on<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:14.070> flash

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
from 83 to 100 megahertz on the flash

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.359 
from 83 to 100 megahertz on the flash

controller<00:01:17.970> in<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.600> 730<00:01:19.110> series<00:01:19.320> and<00:01:19.560> it's

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
controller in the 730 series and it's

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.100 
controller in the 730 series and it's
kind<00:01:19.920> of<00:01:20.040> funny<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.310> 730<00:01:20.909> is<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.540> overclocked

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
kind of funny the 730 is the overclocked

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.230 
kind of funny the 730 is the overclocked
version<00:01:22.619> of<00:01:22.920> one<00:01:23.490> of<00:01:23.520> their<00:01:23.700> enterprise

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
version of one of their enterprise

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.149 
version of one of their enterprise
drives<00:01:24.659> I<00:01:24.930> mean<00:01:25.049> is<00:01:25.259> it<00:01:25.290> is<00:01:25.619> it<00:01:25.770> much<00:01:25.920> faster

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
drives I mean is it is it much faster

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.249 
drives I mean is it is it much faster
than<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:26.580> other<00:01:26.729> offerings<00:01:27.060> out<00:01:27.299> there<00:01:27.509> is<00:01:28.049> it

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
than the other offerings out there is it

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.010 
than the other offerings out there is it
fat<00:01:28.380> all<00:01:29.450> it<00:01:30.450> depends<00:01:30.750> on<00:01:30.780> what<00:01:30.900> you're<00:01:30.990> using

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
fat all it depends on what you're using

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.399 
fat all it depends on what you're using
it<00:01:31.320> for<00:01:31.880> what<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:33.150> enterprise<00:01:33.420> drives<00:01:33.960> were

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
it for what the enterprise drives were

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.390 
it for what the enterprise drives were
very<00:01:34.740> very<00:01:34.979> good<00:01:35.220> for<00:01:35.460> were<00:01:35.670> their<00:01:37.400> maximum

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
very very good for were their maximum

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.039 
very very good for were their maximum
latency<00:01:38.790> so<00:01:39.060> they're<00:01:39.210> always<00:01:39.390> very<00:01:39.570> good<00:01:39.930> at

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
latency so they're always very good at

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.690 
latency so they're always very good at
turning<00:01:40.229> around<00:01:40.470> an<00:01:40.770> i/o<00:01:40.950> within<00:01:41.460> a<00:01:41.520> certain

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
turning around an i/o within a certain

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.760 
turning around an i/o within a certain
amount<00:01:41.939> of<00:01:42.030> time<00:01:42.180> and<00:01:43.079> that<00:01:43.290> kind<00:01:43.470> of<00:01:43.530> bled

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
amount of time and that kind of bled

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.710 
amount of time and that kind of bled
over<00:01:43.799> into<00:01:44.070> this<00:01:44.610> consumer<00:01:45.299> level<00:01:45.420> drive

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
over into this consumer level drive

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:46.940

mainly<00:01:46.049> because<00:01:46.170> it's<00:01:46.409> the<00:01:46.500> same<00:01:46.680> kind<00:01:46.710> of

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
mainly because it's the same kind of

mainly because it's the same kind of
controller<00:01:47.310> it's<00:01:47.579> just<00:01:47.790> they<00:01:48.450> did<00:01:48.630> some<00:01:48.750> more

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
controller it's just they did some more

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.889 
controller it's just they did some more
tweaks<00:01:49.140> under<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.470> hood<00:01:49.619> it<00:01:50.520> actually

00:01:50.889 --> 00:01:50.899 
tweaks under the hood it actually

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:53.929 
tweaks under the hood it actually
outperforms<00:01:51.899> the<00:01:52.140> data<00:01:52.799> center<00:01:52.979> s<00:01:53.189> 3500<00:01:53.820> which

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
is what it's based on cool which is

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.080 
is what it's based on cool which is
pretty<00:01:56.009> cool<00:01:56.250> and<00:01:56.460> it<00:01:56.610> carries<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:56.969> same

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
warranty which is also pretty cool but

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.069 
warranty which is also pretty cool but
it's<00:01:59.700> not<00:01:59.759> rated<00:02:00.000> for<00:02:00.149> the<00:02:00.420> longevity<00:02:00.570> that

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
enterprise version Oh interesting so if

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.080 
enterprise version Oh interesting so if
you've<00:02:04.829> got<00:02:04.860> like<00:02:05.040> a<00:02:05.070> five<00:02:05.310> year<00:02:05.340> warranty<00:02:05.670> but

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
you've got like a five year warranty but

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.950 
you've got like a five year warranty but
I'm<00:02:06.180> not<00:02:06.299> telling<00:02:06.540> you<00:02:06.600> you're<00:02:06.719> going<00:02:06.810> to<00:02:06.869> get

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
I'm not telling you you're going to get

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.540 
I'm not telling you you're going to get
all<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:07.290> terabytes<00:02:07.710> for<00:02:07.950> a<00:02:07.979> thousand<00:02:08.520> years

all the terabytes for a thousand years
right<00:02:09.539> they<00:02:09.690> rated<00:02:09.869> for<00:02:10.110> I<00:02:10.170> think<00:02:10.440> it's<00:02:10.560> 70<00:02:11.009> 70

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640

right they rated for I think it's 70 70
gig<00:02:11.760> per<00:02:11.910> day<00:02:12.060> so<00:02:12.989> a<00:02:13.020> consumer<00:02:13.410> you

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830

it compare to the fastest drive from
samsung<00:02:17.580> or<00:02:17.730> corsair<00:02:18.200> uh<00:02:19.200> it<00:02:19.530> beats<00:02:20.100> them<00:02:20.340> on

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
samsung or corsair uh it beats them on

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.900 
samsung or corsair uh it beats them on

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
the really low queue depth iOS so if

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.810 
the really low queue depth iOS so if
you're<00:02:24.090> really<00:02:24.270> beating<00:02:24.720> it<00:02:24.840> up<00:02:24.930> on<00:02:25.110> on<00:02:25.790> what<00:02:26.790> I

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
you're really beating it up on on what I

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:28.730 
you're really beating it up on on what I
would<00:02:26.970> consider<00:02:27.060> just<00:02:27.420> regular<00:02:27.720> consumer<00:02:28.590> use

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
would consider just regular consumer use

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.290 
would consider just regular consumer use
right<00:02:29.160> which<00:02:29.580> is<00:02:29.700> where<00:02:29.820> your<00:02:29.940> queue<00:02:30.120> depth

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
right which is where your queue depth

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.390 
right which is where your queue depth
stays<00:02:30.570> on<00:02:30.750> the<00:02:30.840> low<00:02:31.020> numbers<00:02:31.440> to<00:02:31.680> death<00:02:31.830> is<00:02:31.980> how

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
stays on the low numbers to death is how

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.160 
stays on the low numbers to death is how
many<00:02:32.580> iOS<00:02:32.850> Windows<00:02:33.210> is<00:02:33.360> piling<00:02:33.750> on<00:02:33.840> the<00:02:33.870> driver

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
many iOS Windows is piling on the driver

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.920 
many iOS Windows is piling on the driver
at<00:02:34.590> the<00:02:34.650> same<00:02:34.890> time<00:02:35.240> so<00:02:36.240> as<00:02:36.360> long<00:02:36.450> as<00:02:36.510> you<00:02:36.690> stick

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
at the same time so as long as you stick

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.260 
at the same time so as long as you stick
somewhere<00:02:37.500> between<00:02:37.950> are<00:02:38.340> underneath<00:02:38.790> a<00:02:38.970> four

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.430 
or eight of a queue depth value on this
drive<00:02:41.520> it's<00:02:42.060> gonna<00:02:42.210> actually<00:02:42.690> outperforms

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
drive it's gonna actually outperforms

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.200 
drive it's gonna actually outperforms
everything<00:02:44.220> else<00:02:44.340> we<00:02:44.460> compared<00:02:44.790> it<00:02:44.880> to<00:02:44.910> in

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:45.210 
everything else we compared it to in

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:46.610 
everything else we compared it to in
that<00:02:45.420> in<00:02:45.570> that<00:02:45.600> band<00:02:45.930> which<00:02:46.200> is<00:02:46.320> actually<00:02:46.590> very

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
that in that band which is actually very

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.200 
that in that band which is actually very
good<00:02:46.860> for<00:02:46.920> consumers<00:02:47.100> so<00:02:47.760> this<00:02:47.970> is<00:02:48.090> the

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:48.210 
good for consumers so this is the

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:50.600 
good for consumers so this is the
classic<00:02:48.390> SSD<00:02:49.050> benchmark<00:02:49.500> question<00:02:49.950> you<00:02:50.400> can

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
classic SSD benchmark question you can

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:51.800 
classic SSD benchmark question you can
benchmark<00:02:50.940> the<00:02:51.180> difference<00:02:51.540> in<00:02:51.660> performance

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
benchmark the difference in performance

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.750 
benchmark the difference in performance
can<00:02:52.530> anybody<00:02:52.709> actually<00:02:53.040> tell<00:02:53.340> the<00:02:53.459> difference

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
can anybody actually tell the difference

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.660 
can anybody actually tell the difference
in<00:02:53.880> real<00:02:54.030> world<00:02:54.240> use<00:02:54.540> uh<00:02:55.400> it's<00:02:56.400> gonna<00:02:56.550> be

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
in real world use uh it's gonna be

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:57.830 
in real world use uh it's gonna be
pretty<00:02:56.730> close<00:02:57.030> on<00:02:57.180> this<00:02:57.330> one<00:02:57.390> that's<00:02:57.720> actually

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
pretty close on this one that's actually

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.620 
pretty close on this one that's actually
it's<00:02:58.650> actually<00:02:58.920> pretty<00:02:59.040> close<00:02:59.280> on<00:02:59.459> almost<00:03:00.420> all

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
it's actually pretty close on almost all

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.170 
it's actually pretty close on almost all

for a while now several years in fact so

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.410 
for a while now several years in fact so
it's<00:03:10.560> really<00:03:10.709> just<00:03:10.980> kind<00:03:11.250> of<00:03:11.340> a<00:03:11.490> you<00:03:12.270> know<00:03:12.390> a

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
it's really just kind of a you know a

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:13.820 
it's really just kind of a you know a
little<00:03:12.720> bit<00:03:12.900> gain<00:03:13.200> here<00:03:13.440> a<00:03:13.470> little<00:03:13.560> bit<00:03:13.709> of

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
little bit gain here a little bit of

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:16.790 
little bit gain here a little bit of
game<00:03:13.950> there<00:03:14.160> i<00:03:14.850> would<00:03:15.240> consider<00:03:15.390> the<00:03:16.050> 730<00:03:16.530> when

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 
game there i would consider the 730 when

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.500 
game there i would consider the 730 when
you<00:03:16.890> compare<00:03:17.220> it<00:03:17.250> to<00:03:17.370> like<00:03:17.400> a<00:03:17.520> samsung<00:03:18.060> or<00:03:18.330> you

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
you compare it to like a samsung or you

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:19.580 
you compare it to like a samsung or you

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.330 
kind of I gotta qualify it and say

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.840 
kind of I gotta qualify it and say
certain<00:03:27.600> kind<00:03:27.810> of<00:03:27.900> iOS<00:03:28.230> but<00:03:28.530> really<00:03:29.489> like<00:03:29.670> when

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
certain kind of iOS but really like when

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:31.009 
certain kind of iOS but really like when
you're<00:03:29.970> just<00:03:30.090> hammering<00:03:30.510> the<00:03:30.660> drive<00:03:30.870> when

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:31.019 
you're just hammering the drive when

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:31.910 
you're just hammering the drive when
you're<00:03:31.080> just<00:03:31.230> hitting<00:03:31.410> it<00:03:31.560> with<00:03:31.620> a<00:03:31.680> lot<00:03:31.890> of

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
you're just hitting it with a lot of

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.949 
you're just hitting it with a lot of
things<00:03:32.190> in<00:03:32.340> parallel<00:03:32.670> it's<00:03:33.330> able<00:03:33.600> to<00:03:33.690> really

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
things in parallel it's able to really

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:35.630 
things in parallel it's able to really
pull<00:03:34.140> those<00:03:34.350> through<00:03:34.590> those<00:03:34.739> you<00:03:35.519> know<00:03:35.610> a

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
pull those through those you know a

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:36.979 
pull those through those you know a
little<00:03:36.209> bit<00:03:36.360> better<00:03:36.510> than<00:03:36.720> the<00:03:36.780> competition

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
little bit better than the competition

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:39.380 
little bit better than the competition
but<00:03:37.769> for<00:03:37.980> most<00:03:38.100> like<00:03:38.400> you<00:03:38.610> know<00:03:38.700> open<00:03:39.000> up<00:03:39.090> large

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
but for most like you know open up large

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:41.509 
but for most like you know open up large
files<00:03:39.840> or<00:03:40.290> stuff<00:03:40.830> like<00:03:40.980> that<00:03:41.040> it's<00:03:41.340> pretty

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 
files or stuff like that it's pretty

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:43.460 
files or stuff like that it's pretty
much<00:03:41.670> going<00:03:41.790> to<00:03:41.850> be<00:03:41.959> units<00:03:42.959> not<00:03:43.140> gonna<00:03:43.350> be<00:03:43.410> able

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
much going to be units not gonna be able

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.550 
much going to be units not gonna be able
to<00:03:43.650> tell<00:03:43.769> the<00:03:43.890> difference<00:03:43.920> it's<00:03:44.550> pretty<00:03:45.060> close

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
to tell the difference it's pretty close

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.810 
to tell the difference it's pretty close
the<00:03:46.560> the<00:03:46.800> rights<00:03:47.070> on<00:03:47.280> this<00:03:47.430> are<00:03:47.550> going<00:03:47.670> to<00:03:47.730> be

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:47.820 
the the rights on this are going to be

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:49.490 
the the rights on this are going to be
better<00:03:47.970> than<00:03:48.060> something<00:03:48.360> like<00:03:48.600> an<00:03:48.720> 840<00:03:49.200> Evo

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
better than something like an 840 Evo

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.320 
better than something like an 840 Evo
from<00:03:49.950> Samsung<00:03:50.370> because<00:03:50.670> it<00:03:50.790> doesn't<00:03:51.030> have<00:03:51.150> to

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:51.330 
from Samsung because it doesn't have to

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:53.000 
from Samsung because it doesn't have to
use<00:03:51.480> a<00:03:51.510> certain<00:03:51.750> cache<00:03:52.110> just<00:03:52.590> speed<00:03:52.769> up<00:03:52.800> the

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
use a certain cache just speed up the

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:54.740 
use a certain cache just speed up the
rights<00:03:53.190> and<00:03:53.340> then<00:03:53.489> that<00:03:53.670> cash<00:03:53.910> fills<00:03:54.269> up<00:03:54.450> after

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
rights and then that cash fills up after

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:56.570 
rights and then that cash fills up after
a<00:03:54.780> certain<00:03:54.959> time<00:03:55.080> this<00:03:55.709> is<00:03:55.860> just<00:03:55.980> going<00:03:56.220> full

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:56.580 
a certain time this is just going full

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:59.240 
a certain time this is just going full
speed<00:03:56.730> all<00:03:57.090> the<00:03:57.150> time<00:03:57.830> so<00:03:58.830> it<00:03:58.920> doesn't<00:03:59.100> have<00:03:59.190> to

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
speed all the time so it doesn't have to

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:00.770 
speed all the time so it doesn't have to
do<00:03:59.340> any<00:03:59.459> kind<00:03:59.610> of<00:03:59.700> any<00:03:59.850> of<00:04:00.120> that<00:04:00.209> trickery<00:04:00.630> that

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
do any kind of any of that trickery that

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.840 
do any kind of any of that trickery that
the<00:04:00.870> 840<00:04:01.200> Evo<00:04:01.380> does<00:04:01.590> but<00:04:01.890> it's<00:04:02.489> more<00:04:02.640> expensive

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:02.850 
the 840 Evo does but it's more expensive

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:06.740 
the 840 Evo does but it's more expensive
so<00:04:04.250> Samsung<00:04:05.250> is<00:04:05.370> 840<00:04:05.880> the<00:04:06.090> Evo's<00:04:06.420> are<00:04:06.450> those

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
so Samsung is 840 the Evo's are those

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:07.759 
so Samsung is 840 the Evo's are those
still<00:04:06.900> kind<00:04:07.110> of<00:04:07.140> your<00:04:07.290> favorite

you know anything you can talk about
that's<00:04:50.070> coming<00:04:50.310> up<00:04:50.370> soon<00:04:50.430> for<00:04:50.820> ssds<00:04:51.390> is<00:04:51.900> it

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:52.170 
that's coming up soon for ssds is it

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:54.020 
that's coming up soon for ssds is it
safe<00:04:52.470> to<00:04:52.680> buy<00:04:52.770> an<00:04:52.890> SSD<00:04:53.280> for<00:04:53.310> the<00:04:53.550> next<00:04:53.760> month<00:04:53.850> or

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.030 
safe to buy an SSD for the next month or

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:56.330 
safe to buy an SSD for the next month or
two<00:04:54.180> oh<00:04:54.530> yeah<00:04:55.530> you're<00:04:55.710> good<00:04:55.860> you're<00:04:56.040> good<00:04:56.100> for

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:56.340 
two oh yeah you're good you're good for

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:58.250 
two oh yeah you're good you're good for
a<00:04:56.430> while<00:04:56.610> I<00:04:57.060> think<00:04:57.540> the<00:04:57.630> thing<00:04:57.750> we<00:04:57.930> might<00:04:58.080> see

00:04:58.250 --> 00:04:58.260 
a while I think the thing we might see

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:02.330 
a while I think the thing we might see
things<00:04:59.100> move<00:04:59.460> to<00:04:59.810> is<00:05:00.810> we<00:05:01.560> saw<00:05:01.710> at<00:05:01.800> CES<00:05:02.100> we<00:05:02.190> saw<00:05:02.310> a

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:02.340 
things move to is we saw at CES we saw a

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:04.220 
things move to is we saw at CES we saw a
lot<00:05:02.400> of<00:05:02.520> m<00:05:02.670> dot<00:05:02.850> to<00:05:03.090> stuff<00:05:03.390> sure<00:05:03.720> coming<00:05:04.110> out

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:04.230 
lot of m dot to stuff sure coming out

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:05.750 
lot of m dot to stuff sure coming out
which<00:05:04.620> is<00:05:04.740> basically<00:05:05.100> just<00:05:05.220> the<00:05:05.460> mobile

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:05.760 
which is basically just the mobile

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:07.910 
which is basically just the mobile
version<00:05:05.790> of<00:05:06.180> a<00:05:06.330> a<00:05:06.540> port<00:05:07.200> that<00:05:07.260> can<00:05:07.530> connect<00:05:07.830> to

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:07.920 
version of a a port that can connect to

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:10.580 
version of a a port that can connect to
SATA<00:05:08.160> or<00:05:08.370> PCI<00:05:08.970> Express<00:05:09.270> mm-hmm<00:05:09.900> and<00:05:10.410> I<00:05:10.530> think

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:10.590 
SATA or PCI Express mm-hmm and I think

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:13.160 
SATA or PCI Express mm-hmm and I think
the<00:05:11.250> desktop<00:05:12.120> side<00:05:12.360> is<00:05:12.510> eventually<00:05:12.750> going<00:05:13.110> to

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:13.170 
the desktop side is eventually going to

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:15.800 
the desktop side is eventually going to
try<00:05:13.830> to<00:05:13.890> shift<00:05:14.160> to<00:05:14.340> that<00:05:14.810> there's

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:15.810 
try to shift to that there's

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:17.600 
try to shift to that there's
motherboards<00:05:16.410> that<00:05:16.590> a<00:05:16.620> different<00:05:17.250> companies

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:17.610 
motherboards that a different companies

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:18.560 
motherboards that a different companies
have<00:05:17.640> been<00:05:17.760> testing<00:05:18.030> the<00:05:18.090> waters<00:05:18.300> with<00:05:18.390> mother

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:18.570 
have been testing the waters with mother

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:20.930 
have been testing the waters with mother
boards<00:05:18.780> that<00:05:18.870> have<00:05:18.930> a<00:05:19.050> SATA<00:05:19.890> Express<00:05:20.460> port<00:05:20.760> on

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:20.940 
boards that have a SATA Express port on

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:23.480 
boards that have a SATA Express port on
it<00:05:21.410> which<00:05:22.410> actually<00:05:22.590> lets<00:05:22.890> you<00:05:22.950> connect<00:05:23.280> to

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:23.490 
it which actually lets you connect to

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:25.400 
it which actually lets you connect to
see<00:05:24.000> related<00:05:24.210> ports<00:05:24.630> or<00:05:24.750> a<00:05:24.810> device<00:05:25.260> that

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:35.880 
stuff you see coming in in Apple

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:37.250 
stuff you see coming in in Apple
computers<00:05:36.270> for<00:05:36.450> example<00:05:36.810> right<00:05:36.990> how<00:05:37.110> their

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:37.260 
computers for example right how their

shift into that Samsung PCI Express
based<00:05:39.810> controller<00:05:40.200> this<00:05:40.680> would<00:05:40.800> allow<00:05:40.890> you<00:05:41.040> to

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:41.280

do<00:05:42.060> that<00:05:42.090> on<00:05:42.390> all<00:05:42.630> the<00:05:42.960> other<00:05:43.050> regular<00:05:43.530> desktop

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:43.710 
do that on all the other regular desktop

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:45.770 
do that on all the other regular desktop
PCs<00:05:44.220> and<00:05:44.250> have<00:05:44.820> that<00:05:44.970> kind<00:05:45.210> of<00:05:45.240> a<00:05:45.330> solution<00:05:45.720> in

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:45.780 
PCs and have that kind of a solution in

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:47.060 
PCs and have that kind of a solution in
the<00:05:45.870> upgrade<00:05:46.169> path<00:05:46.380> that<00:05:46.770> would<00:05:46.830> be<00:05:46.919> pretty

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:47.070 
the upgrade path that would be pretty

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:49.130 
the upgrade path that would be pretty
awesome<00:05:47.190> I'm<00:05:47.790> any<00:05:48.000> you<00:05:48.210> know<00:05:48.300> how<00:05:48.750> long<00:05:48.960> before

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:49.140 
awesome I'm any you know how long before

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:50.810 
awesome I'm any you know how long before
we<00:05:49.380> start<00:05:49.590> getting<00:05:49.680> you<00:05:50.220> know<00:05:50.340> SSDs<00:05:50.790> and

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:50.820 
we start getting you know SSDs and

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:52.550 
we start getting you know SSDs and
rotating<00:05:51.360> media<00:05:51.600> getting<00:05:51.990> closer<00:05:52.260> to<00:05:52.440> the

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:52.560 
rotating media getting closer to the

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.500 
rotating media getting closer to the
same<00:05:52.800> cost<00:05:53.100> per<00:05:53.400> gig<00:05:53.640> or<00:05:53.880> is<00:05:54.180> that<00:05:54.270> just<00:05:54.330> a

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:54.510 
same cost per gig or is that just a

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:56.270 
same cost per gig or is that just a
ridiculous<00:05:54.630> can<00:05:55.380> we<00:05:55.440> expect<00:05:55.710> much<00:05:55.890> of<00:05:55.950> a<00:05:56.070> drop

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:56.280 
ridiculous can we expect much of a drop

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:57.440 
ridiculous can we expect much of a drop
between<00:05:56.460> now<00:05:56.730> in<00:05:56.850> the<00:05:56.940> end<00:05:57.060> of<00:05:57.150> the<00:05:57.210> year<00:05:57.240> on

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:57.450 
between now in the end of the year on

00:05:57.450 --> 00:06:01.730 
between now in the end of the year on
the<00:05:57.570> cost<00:05:57.840> of<00:05:58.020> SSDs<00:05:58.500> mutt<00:06:00.110> we<00:06:01.110> now<00:06:01.350> on<00:06:01.500> the<00:06:01.620> end

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:01.740 
the cost of SSDs mutt we now on the end

the cost of SSDs mutt we now on the end
of<00:06:01.800> the<00:06:01.890> year<00:06:02.130> I<00:06:02.310> don't<00:06:03.180> think<00:06:03.300> there's<00:06:03.419> going

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:03.510 
of the year I don't think there's going

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:05.690 
of the year I don't think there's going
to<00:06:03.600> be<00:06:03.630> a<00:06:03.690> huge<00:06:04.050> huge<00:06:04.770> dip<00:06:05.100> because<00:06:05.370> we<00:06:05.490> haven't

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:05.700 
to be a huge huge dip because we haven't

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:08.390 
to be a huge huge dip because we haven't
seen<00:06:05.820> any<00:06:05.940> large<00:06:06.840> process<00:06:07.380> node<00:06:07.650> shrinks<00:06:08.250> any

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:08.400 
seen any large process node shrinks any

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:12.290 
seen any large process node shrinks any
kind<00:06:08.580> of<00:06:08.610> dice<00:06:08.820> ranks<00:06:09.210> happening<00:06:09.600> on<00:06:09.750> that<00:06:11.300> so

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:12.300 
kind of dice ranks happening on that so

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:14.450 
kind of dice ranks happening on that so
pretty<00:06:12.600> much<00:06:12.660> 20<00:06:13.020> nanometer<00:06:13.350> is<00:06:13.530> the<00:06:14.190> standard

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:14.460 
pretty much 20 nanometer is the standard

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:15.530 
pretty much 20 nanometer is the standard
across<00:06:14.610> the<00:06:14.700> board<00:06:14.970> which<00:06:15.060> is<00:06:15.180> actually<00:06:15.300> the

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:15.540 
across the board which is actually the

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:20.570 
across the board which is actually the
same<00:06:15.720> flash<00:06:16.410> that's<00:06:16.620> in<00:06:16.740> the<00:06:17.040> 730<00:06:18.169> the<00:06:19.169> I<00:06:19.800> think

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:20.580 
same flash that's in the 730 the I think

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:21.740 
same flash that's in the 730 the I think
the<00:06:20.669> point<00:06:20.910> where<00:06:21.030> the<00:06:21.120> hard<00:06:21.270> drives<00:06:21.510> and<00:06:21.690> the

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:21.750 
the point where the hard drives and the

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:23.450 
the point where the hard drives and the
SSDs<00:06:22.110> are<00:06:22.140> going<00:06:22.290> to<00:06:22.350> match<00:06:22.560> on<00:06:22.860> cost<00:06:23.130> per<00:06:23.280> gig

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:23.460 
SSDs are going to match on cost per gig

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:24.920 
SSDs are going to match on cost per gig
is<00:06:23.640> when<00:06:23.910> the<00:06:24.060> hard<00:06:24.270> drives<00:06:24.510> start<00:06:24.780> becoming

is when the hard drives start becoming

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:27.350 
is when the hard drives start becoming
so<00:06:25.380> uncommon<00:06:26.040> that<00:06:26.460> the<00:06:26.640> cost<00:06:26.850> starts<00:06:27.120> going

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:27.360 
so uncommon that the cost starts going

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:29.120 
so uncommon that the cost starts going
up<00:06:27.510> because<00:06:27.780> they're<00:06:28.080> not<00:06:28.230> shipping<00:06:28.800> and

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:29.130 
up because they're not shipping and

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:31.460 
up because they're not shipping and

large volume in a wow that's my
suspicions<00:06:32.190> I<00:06:32.340> think<00:06:32.700> they're<00:06:32.850> going<00:06:32.940> to

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:33.030 
suspicions I think they're going to

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:34.550 
suspicions I think they're going to
chase<00:06:33.270> each<00:06:33.450> other<00:06:33.660> all<00:06:33.870> the<00:06:33.990> way<00:06:34.080> down<00:06:34.320> and

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:34.560 
chase each other all the way down and

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:36.980 
chase each other all the way down and
then<00:06:34.729> finally<00:06:35.729> it'll<00:06:36.510> just<00:06:36.539> get<00:06:36.720> to<00:06:36.810> the<00:06:36.870> point

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:36.990 
then finally it'll just get to the point

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:38.390 
then finally it'll just get to the point
where<00:06:37.169> but<00:06:37.320> he's<00:06:37.440> using<00:06:37.590> solid<00:06:37.979> state<00:06:38.190> for

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:38.400 
where but he's using solid state for

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:40.279 
where but he's using solid state for

00:06:40.279 --> 00:06:40.289 
most of their stuff and then the hard

most of their stuff and then the hard
