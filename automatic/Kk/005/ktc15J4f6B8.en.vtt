00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:04.490 
alright in this video we'll take a look

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:06.670 
alright in this video we'll take a look
at<00:00:04.760> the<00:00:04.940> temperature<00:00:05.420> sensor<00:00:05.810> on<00:00:06.080> the<00:00:06.350> Garmin

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:06.680 
at the temperature sensor on the Garmin

Phoenix<00:00:07.100> today<00:00:08.029> we're<00:00:08.360> just<00:00:08.599> going<00:00:08.749> to<00:00:08.780> go<00:00:08.900> for

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:09.080 
Phoenix today we're just going to go for

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:11.289 
Phoenix today we're just going to go for
about<00:00:09.230> an<00:00:09.379> hour<00:00:09.499> walk<00:00:09.889> it's<00:00:10.339> about<00:00:10.669> minus

00:00:11.289 --> 00:00:11.299 
about an hour walk it's about minus

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:14.680 
about an hour walk it's about minus
twelve<00:00:11.690> Celsius<00:00:12.410> outside<00:00:13.269> so<00:00:14.269> in<00:00:14.419> order<00:00:14.539> to

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:14.690 
twelve Celsius outside so in order to

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:18.730 
twelve Celsius outside so in order to
get<00:00:14.900> a<00:00:15.079> good<00:00:15.139> reading<00:00:15.670> we<00:00:16.670> have<00:00:16.880> to<00:00:17.530> not<00:00:18.530> have

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:18.740 
get a good reading we have to not have

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:20.530 
get a good reading we have to not have
the<00:00:18.890> watch<00:00:19.040> touching<00:00:19.700> our<00:00:19.790> skin<00:00:20.090> which<00:00:20.240> might

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:20.540 
the watch touching our skin which might

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:22.030 
the watch touching our skin which might
affect<00:00:20.780> the<00:00:20.930> sensor<00:00:21.200> so<00:00:21.320> we<00:00:21.440> have<00:00:21.560> outside<00:00:21.830> our

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:22.040 
affect the sensor so we have outside our

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.580 
affect the sensor so we have outside our
jacket<00:00:22.460> and<00:00:23.080> I'll<00:00:24.080> put<00:00:24.290> a<00:00:24.320> link<00:00:24.440> in<00:00:24.560> the

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:24.590 
jacket and I'll put a link in the

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:26.260 
jacket and I'll put a link in the

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:28.040 
station which were only a few kilometres

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.260 
station which were only a few kilometres
away<00:00:28.160> so<00:00:28.310> you<00:00:28.520> can<00:00:28.640> take<00:00:28.790> a<00:00:28.820> look<00:00:29.000> at<00:00:29.120> the

additional weather information for today

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:33.880 
additional weather information for today
but<00:00:32.509> we're<00:00:32.960> just<00:00:33.230> going<00:00:33.350> to<00:00:33.380> go<00:00:33.470> for<00:00:33.710> a<00:00:33.740> walk

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:33.890 
but we're just going to go for a walk

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:36.370 
but we're just going to go for a walk
and<00:00:34.070> see<00:00:34.160> once<00:00:34.760> we're<00:00:34.910> done<00:00:35.060> or<00:00:35.450> how<00:00:35.930> long<00:00:36.170> it

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:36.380 
and see once we're done or how long it

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:39.460 
and see once we're done or how long it
takes<00:00:36.590> to<00:00:36.829> get<00:00:37.250> an<00:00:37.550> accurate<00:00:38.120> reading<00:00:38.470> all

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:39.470 
takes to get an accurate reading all

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:41.470 
takes to get an accurate reading all
right<00:00:39.620> so<00:00:39.770> we're<00:00:39.980> about<00:00:40.220> thirty<00:00:40.760> minutes<00:00:41.060> into

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:41.480 
right so we're about thirty minutes into

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.010 
right so we're about thirty minutes into
our<00:00:41.540> activity<00:00:41.960> the<00:00:42.140> manual<00:00:42.650> does<00:00:42.950> say<00:00:43.420> to<00:00:44.420> wait

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:45.020 
our activity the manual does say to wait

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:46.960 
our activity the manual does say to wait
about<00:00:45.170> 20<00:00:45.680> to<00:00:45.800> 30<00:00:46.010> minutes<00:00:46.280> before<00:00:46.370> getting<00:00:46.670> a

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:46.970 
about 20 to 30 minutes before getting a

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:48.430 
about 20 to 30 minutes before getting a
reading<00:00:47.300> so<00:00:47.630> what<00:00:47.750> we're<00:00:47.930> going<00:00:48.079> to<00:00:48.110> do<00:00:48.260> now

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:48.440 
reading so what we're going to do now

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.740 
reading so what we're going to do now
we're<00:00:48.860> halfway<00:00:49.070> through<00:00:49.220> our<00:00:49.520> walk<00:00:49.750> we're

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:50.750 
we're halfway through our walk we're

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.520 
we're halfway through our walk we're
going<00:00:51.020> to<00:00:51.260> remove<00:00:51.680> the<00:00:52.430> Fenix<00:00:52.970> from<00:00:53.090> our<00:00:53.660> wrist

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:54.530 
going to remove the Fenix from our wrist

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.380 
going to remove the Fenix from our wrist
and<00:00:55.040> we're<00:00:55.370> just<00:00:55.550> going<00:00:55.700> to<00:00:55.760> carry<00:00:56.000> it<00:00:56.120> by<00:00:56.329> the

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.390 
and we're just going to carry it by the

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.900 
and we're just going to carry it by the
wrist<00:00:56.690> straps<00:00:56.960> and<00:00:57.230> see<00:00:57.950> if<00:00:58.190> that<00:00:58.460> will<00:00:58.730> make<00:00:58.760> a

00:00:58.900 --> 00:00:58.910 
wrist straps and see if that will make a

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:01.780 
wrist straps and see if that will make a
difference<00:00:59.270> so<00:01:00.050> our<00:01:00.469> actual<00:01:00.920> temperature<00:01:01.579> is

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:01.790 
difference so our actual temperature is

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:03.490 
difference so our actual temperature is
closer<00:01:02.090> to<00:01:02.210> minus<00:01:02.780> twelve<00:01:03.020> so<00:01:03.260> we've<00:01:03.350> got<00:01:03.469> a

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:03.500 
closer to minus twelve so we've got a

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:04.180 
closer to minus twelve so we've got a
little<00:01:03.649> ways<00:01:03.860> to<00:01:03.890> go

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:04.190 
little ways to go

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:07.660 
little ways to go
all<00:01:04.970> right<00:01:05.120> so<00:01:05.239> about<00:01:05.390> another<00:01:06.070> 15<00:01:07.070> 20<00:01:07.250> minutes

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:07.670 
all right so about another 15 20 minutes

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:09.789 
all right so about another 15 20 minutes
interactivity<00:01:08.420> we<00:01:08.630> do<00:01:08.780> have<00:01:09.020> the<00:01:09.440> Phoenix

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:09.799 
interactivity we do have the Phoenix

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:10.840 
interactivity we do have the Phoenix
clipped<00:01:10.040> or<00:01:10.159> carabiner

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
clipped or carabiner

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.780 
clipped or carabiner
we<00:01:11.240> did<00:01:11.390> get<00:01:11.540> it<00:01:11.630> 2-1<00:01:12.409> but<00:01:12.860> just<00:01:13.190> by<00:01:13.310> holding<00:01:13.490> it

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:13.790 
we did get it 2-1 but just by holding it

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:15.820 
we did get it 2-1 but just by holding it
in<00:01:13.880> my<00:01:13.909> hand<00:01:14.270> it<00:01:14.810> raised<00:01:15.049> the<00:01:15.200> temperature<00:01:15.680> up

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:15.830 
in my hand it raised the temperature up

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:18.010 
in my hand it raised the temperature up
to<00:01:16.040> plus<00:01:16.700> five<00:01:16.940> we're<00:01:17.210> still<00:01:17.390> quite<00:01:17.750> a<00:01:17.780> ways

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
to plus five we're still quite a ways

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.609 
to plus five we're still quite a ways
from<00:01:18.430> minus<00:01:19.430> twelve<00:01:19.760> now<00:01:20.659> you<00:01:20.720> can<00:01:20.990> also<00:01:21.110> get<00:01:21.440> a

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:21.619 
from minus twelve now you can also get a

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:23.890 
from minus twelve now you can also get a
temp<00:01:22.159> a<00:01:22.310> wireless<00:01:22.850> sensor<00:01:23.090> so<00:01:23.600> if<00:01:23.690> you<00:01:23.780> don't

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:23.900 
temp a wireless sensor so if you don't

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:25.840 
temp a wireless sensor so if you don't
want<00:01:24.049> to<00:01:24.110> use<00:01:24.200> the<00:01:24.320> sensor<00:01:24.710> that<00:01:25.310> is<00:01:25.369> on<00:01:25.670> the

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
want to use the sensor that is on the

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.490 
want to use the sensor that is on the
Phoenix<00:01:26.210> you<00:01:26.990> can<00:01:27.140> use<00:01:27.320> that<00:01:27.560> and<00:01:28.900> but<00:01:29.900> if<00:01:30.290> you

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
Phoenix you can use that and but if you

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.020 
Phoenix you can use that and but if you
do<00:01:30.650> want<00:01:30.860> to<00:01:30.950> use<00:01:31.100> the<00:01:31.250> sensor<00:01:31.460> you<00:01:31.670> can<00:01:31.820> always

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.030 
do want to use the sensor you can always

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.080 
do want to use the sensor you can always
use<00:01:32.720> the<00:01:33.110> carabiner<00:01:33.740> attachment<00:01:34.400> so<00:01:34.549> so<00:01:34.729> using

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
use the carabiner attachment so so using

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:36.760 
use the carabiner attachment so so using
the<00:01:35.210> wrist<00:01:35.390> strap<00:01:35.479> you<00:01:36.380> would<00:01:36.560> have<00:01:36.740> a

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
the wrist strap you would have a

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.460 
the wrist strap you would have a
carabiner<00:01:37.250> that<00:01:37.729> would<00:01:38.030> hopefully<00:01:38.540> give<00:01:39.350> you

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:39.470 
carabiner that would hopefully give you

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:42.789 
carabiner that would hopefully give you
a<00:01:39.530> better<00:01:40.570> accurate<00:01:41.570> reading<00:01:41.900> now<00:01:42.260> I<00:01:42.290> am<00:01:42.500> using

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:42.799 
a better accurate reading now I am using

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:45.310 
a better accurate reading now I am using
the<00:01:43.430> GPS<00:01:43.880> right<00:01:44.090> now<00:01:44.210> to<00:01:44.270> track<00:01:44.630> this<00:01:44.810> activity

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.320 
the GPS right now to track this activity

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.760 
the GPS right now to track this activity
so<00:01:45.830> you<00:01:45.920> can<00:01:46.040> see<00:01:46.220> where<00:01:46.430> we're<00:01:46.580> at<00:01:46.700> and<00:01:47.000> also

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770 
so you can see where we're at and also

only a few kilometers away I'll post

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.730 
only a few kilometers away I'll post
that<00:01:52.520> into<00:01:53.000> the<00:01:53.360> description<00:01:53.689> but<00:01:54.530> there<00:01:54.680> you

have it

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.249 
have it
temperature<00:01:55.850> sensor<00:01:56.180> on<00:01:56.420> the<00:01:56.570> Garmin<00:01:56.900> Phoenix

00:01:57.249 --> 00:01:57.259 
temperature sensor on the Garmin Phoenix

00:01:57.259 --> 00:01:59.440 
temperature sensor on the Garmin Phoenix
like<00:01:57.799> the<00:01:58.040> electronic<00:01:58.700> compass<00:01:59.119> barometer

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
like the electronic compass barometer

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.200 
like the electronic compass barometer
altimeter<00:01:59.979> also<00:02:00.979> the<00:02:01.130> temperature<00:02:01.340> so<00:02:02.119> you

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 
altimeter also the temperature so you

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:03.520 
altimeter also the temperature so you
click<00:02:02.450> on<00:02:02.600> the<00:02:02.659> orange<00:02:02.869> button<00:02:03.020> here<00:02:03.500> for

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:08.569 
setup we'll go down to our setup and

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:11.970 
setup we'll go down to our setup and
just<00:02:09.110> going<00:02:09.200> to<00:02:09.289> scroll<00:02:09.560> down<00:02:09.970> to<00:02:10.970> our<00:02:11.120> sensors

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
just going to scroll down to our sensors

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:13.869 
just going to scroll down to our sensors
now<00:02:12.980> if<00:02:13.069> you're<00:02:13.189> using<00:02:13.219> a<00:02:13.489> heart<00:02:13.730> rate<00:02:13.819> monitor

00:02:13.869 --> 00:02:13.879 
now if you're using a heart rate monitor

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:17.199 
now if you're using a heart rate monitor
you<00:02:14.299> can<00:02:14.450> still<00:02:14.780> use<00:02:15.590> that<00:02:15.879> simply<00:02:16.879> go<00:02:17.030> into
