know where where that is loading that

00:06:36.639 --> 00:06:40.800 
know where where that is loading that
stuff<00:06:36.700> at<00:06:37.150> is<00:06:37.360> if<00:06:37.720> you<00:06:37.840> go<00:06:37.990> to<00:06:38.050> run<00:06:38.430> and<00:06:39.430> you<00:06:39.810> go

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:40.810 
stuff at is if you go to run and you go

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:51.930 
stuff at is if you go to run and you go
to<00:06:40.870> registry<00:06:41.320> edit<00:06:42.240> registry<00:06:43.240> editor<00:06:43.660> and<00:06:45.240> you

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:58.930 

not<00:06:52.940> that<00:06:53.210> one

00:06:58.930 --> 00:06:58.940 

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:00.850 

but<00:06:59.510> we<00:06:59.630> look<00:06:59.810> in<00:06:59.930> environment<00:07:00.530> right<00:07:00.650> here

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:00.860 
but we look in environment right here

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:02.860 
but we look in environment right here
here<00:07:01.520> is<00:07:01.610> where<00:07:01.760> that<00:07:01.850> stuff<00:07:02.090> is<00:07:02.240> being<00:07:02.540> stored

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:02.870 
here is where that stuff is being stored

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:05.950 
here is where that stuff is being stored
so<00:07:03.410> here<00:07:04.370> you<00:07:04.700> see<00:07:04.730> the<00:07:05.090> C<00:07:05.330> dot<00:07:05.540> womp

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:05.960 
so here you see the C dot womp

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:09.490 
so here you see the C dot womp
bla<00:07:06.500> bla<00:07:06.530> bla<00:07:06.740> bla<00:07:06.950> bla<00:07:07.340> so<00:07:08.200> just<00:07:09.200> to<00:07:09.290> let<00:07:09.380> you
