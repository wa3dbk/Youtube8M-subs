so<00:00:00.810> this<00:00:01.260> our<00:00:01.530> plan<00:00:01.829> is<00:00:01.979> twin<00:00:03.770> check<00:00:04.770> out<00:00:04.920> all

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.100 
so this our plan is twin check out all

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.519 
so this our plan is twin check out all
these<00:00:05.339> awesome<00:00:05.640> lunar<00:00:06.180> eclipse<00:00:06.480> photos<00:00:06.870> and

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
these awesome lunar eclipse photos and

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:19.490 
these awesome lunar eclipse photos and
someone<00:00:08.040> has<00:00:08.189> a<00:00:08.220> birthday<00:00:17.390> so<00:00:18.390> what's<00:00:18.930> this<00:00:19.230> I

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
someone has a birthday so what's this I

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.939 
someone has a birthday so what's this I
hear<00:00:19.529> about<00:00:19.920> Earth's<00:00:20.430> twin<00:00:21.000> being<00:00:21.359> found<00:00:21.949> well

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
hear about Earth's twin being found well

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.500 
hear about Earth's twin being found well
let's<00:00:23.189> slow<00:00:23.400> down<00:00:23.430> a<00:00:23.609> bit<00:00:23.730> and<00:00:23.939> take<00:00:24.060> a<00:00:24.119> look<00:00:24.330> at

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
let's slow down a bit and take a look at

teleconference where they shared the
news<00:00:34.380> that<00:00:34.680> they<00:00:34.800> have<00:00:35.010> confirmed<00:00:35.760> the

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
news that they have confirmed the

news that they have confirmed the
discovery<00:00:36.719> of<00:00:36.930> an<00:00:37.350> earth-sized<00:00:37.950> planet

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
discovery of an earth-sized planet

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.540 
discovery of an earth-sized planet
orbiting<00:00:39.510> a<00:00:39.629> star<00:00:39.690> in<00:00:40.260> its<00:00:40.620> habitable<00:00:41.280> zone

orbiting a star in its habitable zone

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.209 
orbiting a star in its habitable zone
but<00:00:42.059> what<00:00:42.480> does<00:00:42.629> that<00:00:42.780> mean<00:00:43.050> well<00:00:43.649> first<00:00:43.920> let's

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
but what does that mean well first let's

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.450 
but what does that mean well first let's
take<00:00:44.370> a<00:00:44.430> look<00:00:44.700> at<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:45.000> star<00:00:46.039> kepler-186f<00:00:47.039> is

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
take a look at the star kepler-186f is

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.360 
take a look at the star kepler-186f is
orbiting<00:00:48.210> an<00:00:48.390> M<00:00:48.690> dwarf<00:00:48.750> star<00:00:49.649> which<00:00:50.100> is<00:00:50.250> also

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
orbiting an M dwarf star which is also

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.549 
orbiting an M dwarf star which is also
known<00:00:50.670> as<00:00:50.789> a<00:00:50.820> red<00:00:51.120> dwarf<00:00:51.239> though<00:00:51.930> I<00:00:51.960> didn't<00:00:52.469> see

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
known as a red dwarf though I didn't see

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.250 
known as a red dwarf though I didn't see
any<00:00:52.770> signs<00:00:52.980> and<00:00:53.340> rumor<00:00:53.579> or<00:00:53.820> Crichton<00:00:54.390> now

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
any signs and rumor or Crichton now

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.470 
any signs and rumor or Crichton now
these<00:00:55.800> M<00:00:56.070> dwarf<00:00:56.430> stars<00:00:56.760> are<00:00:56.969> much<00:00:57.120> smaller

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
these M dwarf stars are much smaller

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.479 
these M dwarf stars are much smaller
than<00:00:57.629> a<00:00:57.930> star<00:00:58.260> like<00:00:58.410> our<00:00:58.530> Sun<00:00:58.829> but<00:00:59.250> it's<00:00:59.370> also

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
than a star like our Sun but it's also

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.150 
than a star like our Sun but it's also
much<00:00:59.850> cooler<00:01:00.320> now<00:01:01.320> I<00:01:01.559> know<00:01:01.680> what<00:01:01.949> you're

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
much cooler now I know what you're

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.549 
much cooler now I know what you're
thinking<00:01:02.550> if<00:01:02.730> this<00:01:03.390> star<00:01:03.780> is<00:01:03.809> so<00:01:04.170> much<00:01:04.320> cooler

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
thinking if this star is so much cooler

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.410 
thinking if this star is so much cooler
or<00:01:04.860> how<00:01:04.979> can<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.280> planet<00:01:05.729> be<00:01:05.880> inside<00:01:06.180> the

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
or how can the planet be inside the

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.750 
or how can the planet be inside the
habitable<00:01:07.080> zone<00:01:07.110> well<00:01:08.010> that's<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.520> kicker

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
habitable zone well that's the kicker

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.820 
habitable zone well that's the kicker
even<00:01:09.570> though<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:09.990> planet<00:01:10.380> is<00:01:10.470> around<00:01:10.710> the

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
even though the planet is around the

even though the planet is around the

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
size of Earth its orbit is actually on

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.499 
size of Earth its orbit is actually on
the<00:01:13.380> size<00:01:13.590> of<00:01:13.740> mercury<00:01:14.310> meaning<00:01:15.210> that<00:01:15.360> is

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
the size of mercury meaning that is

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.120 
the size of mercury meaning that is
receiving<00:01:15.960> around<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:16.500> same<00:01:16.740> amount<00:01:16.860> of

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
few really good reasons first of all we

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.950 
few really good reasons first of all we
only<00:01:28.170> know<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.340> size<00:01:29.790> of<00:01:30.210> this<00:01:30.329> planet<00:01:30.840> which

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
only know the size of this planet which

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.660 
only know the size of this planet which
is<00:01:30.990> around<00:01:31.229> ten<00:01:31.530> percent<00:01:31.890> larger<00:01:32.159> than<00:01:32.490> Earth

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
is around ten percent larger than Earth

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.630 
is around ten percent larger than Earth
in<00:01:32.909> diameter<00:01:33.540> but<00:01:34.259> we<00:01:34.380> don't<00:01:34.710> have<00:01:34.829> any<00:01:35.280> idea

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
in diameter but we don't have any idea

about what the mass is or what the

about what the mass is or what the
