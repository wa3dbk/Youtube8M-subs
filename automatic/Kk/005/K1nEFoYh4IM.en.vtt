00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.800 
recommend it and but I only did a little
bit<00:01:38.250> of<00:01:38.280> it<00:01:38.520> and<00:01:38.640> it<00:01:38.729> comes<00:01:38.909> already<00:01:39.119> pre-made

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
bit of it and it comes already pre-made

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.780 
bit of it and it comes already pre-made
it<00:01:40.320> doesn't<00:01:40.650> smell<00:01:40.829> like<00:01:41.009> an<00:01:41.280> ax<00:01:41.310> or<00:01:41.430> anything

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
it doesn't smell like an ax or anything

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.550 
it doesn't smell like an ax or anything
so<00:01:42.509> I<00:01:42.540> don't<00:01:42.659> know<00:01:42.840> why<00:01:42.960> they<00:01:43.110> call<00:01:43.290> it<00:01:43.320> hitter

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
so I don't know why they call it hitter

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.190 
so I don't know why they call it hitter
cream<00:01:43.920> but<00:01:44.399> it<00:01:44.850> doesn't<00:01:45.180> have<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.329> Miss<00:01:45.659> it's

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
cream but it doesn't have the Miss it's

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.499 
cream but it doesn't have the Miss it's
easy<00:01:46.530> it's<00:01:46.829> fast<00:01:47.100> it's<00:01:47.610> inexpensive<00:01:48.180> with

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
easy it's fast it's inexpensive with

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.080 
easy it's fast it's inexpensive with
less<00:01:48.659> than<00:01:48.780> $15<00:01:49.619> and<00:01:49.829> so<00:01:50.460> I<00:01:50.490> think<00:01:50.670> this<00:01:51.030> is

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
less than $15 and so I think this is

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.690 
less than $15 and so I think this is
enough<00:01:51.540> for<00:01:51.570> me<00:01:51.869> to<00:01:52.560> have<00:01:52.799> at<00:01:52.979> least<00:01:53.009> four<00:01:53.670> or

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
enough for me to have at least four or

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.700 
enough for me to have at least four or
five<00:01:53.790> treatments<00:01:54.689> so<00:01:54.990> I<00:01:55.259> think<00:01:55.380> it<00:01:55.560> was<00:01:55.619> a

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
five treatments so I think it was a

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.859 
five treatments so I think it was a
great<00:01:55.860> deal<00:01:56.219> and<00:01:56.490> so<00:01:57.119> for<00:01:57.360> those<00:01:57.450> of<00:01:57.509> you<00:01:57.659> out

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
great deal and so for those of you out

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.420 
great deal and so for those of you out
there<00:01:57.899> with<00:01:58.170> gray<00:01:58.380> hair<00:01:58.710> you<00:01:58.890> might<00:01:59.189> want<00:01:59.399> to

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
there with gray hair you might want to

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.100 
there with gray hair you might want to
try<00:01:59.640> the<00:01:59.700> brown<00:02:00.000> I<00:02:00.270> heard<00:02:00.540> that<00:02:00.659> it<00:02:00.810> makes<00:02:00.990> your

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
hair brown and not as reddish because it

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.569 
hair brown and not as reddish because it
did<00:02:03.600> make<00:02:03.810> it<00:02:03.840> a<00:02:04.020> little<00:02:04.259> red<00:02:04.469> but<00:02:05.100> anyway

did make it a little red but anyway

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.389
