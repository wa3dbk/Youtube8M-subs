00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.720
 we begin a new heading on our channel 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:09.599
 which will be devoted to mods for gta 5 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.370

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.809

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.320
 data headings 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:18.199

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.420
 major 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:23.070
 so to speak modifications that will allow 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.160
 then install others later 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:29.609

 below the video you download it here 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.930
 there will be three files 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:39.180
 simply dump them in the gta 5 directory 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:43.110
 to peter but they already throw off and 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:46.219
 and then we run in gta 5 and 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:49.200

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:50.309
 so dear friends we are actually with you 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.789
 we are on the mountain of chiliad 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:56.370
 and this allowed us to make the mod more precisely he 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.809
 we just suffered what we do after 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.469
 how to throw off all run the game 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:03.539

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.729
 another one wanted to write it down already 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.200
 small spoiler and actually look 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.080
 we have here 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.659
 find the trainer roughly speaking which 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:17.700
 allows you to change everything managed by 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:20.130
 the keys are exactly 846 2 pyaterochka 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.740

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.560
 im a character let's say i can put 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.170
 there drivers and at the same time changing it 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.320
 look save up randomly absolutely 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.150
 appearance is added randomly 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:36.299
 hairstyles you comfortable accessories here 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.530
 let's say generally a strange kind 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:41.280
 here is such 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:43.259
 snow cleaner but it's like he 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:47.030
 allows you to change the appearance allows 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:48.590

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.250
 let's see what else you can allows us 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.770

 shorter airport house franken there michael and 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:15.610

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:23.020
 skin can also add police stars 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:25.990

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:28.810
