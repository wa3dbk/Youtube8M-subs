00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
double points for getting a kill so I

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.410 
double points for getting a kill so I
was<00:00:19.710> really<00:00:19.980> beneficial<00:00:20.220> to<00:00:20.789> have<00:00:21.060> the<00:00:21.210> flag

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
was really beneficial to have the flag

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.380 
was really beneficial to have the flag
at<00:00:21.600> all<00:00:21.750> times<00:00:21.990> so<00:00:22.890> team<00:00:23.250> defender<00:00:23.730> in<00:00:23.970> my

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
at all times so team defender in my

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.779 
at all times so team defender in my
opinion<00:00:24.720> is<00:00:25.109> one<00:00:25.949> of<00:00:26.039> those<00:00:26.130> game<00:00:26.340> types<00:00:26.580> that

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
opinion is one of those game types that

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.700 
opinion is one of those game types that
takes<00:00:27.060> the<00:00:27.210> most<00:00:27.390> teamwork<00:00:28.080> and<00:00:28.289> coordination

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
takes the most teamwork and coordination

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.470 
takes the most teamwork and coordination
and<00:00:29.130> because<00:00:29.670> of<00:00:29.699> this<00:00:29.849> i<00:00:30.029> would<00:00:30.240> definitely

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480

players from a couple nights ago
actually<00:00:35.880> and<00:00:36.390> we<00:00:36.840> did<00:00:36.989> a<00:00:37.020> bunch<00:00:37.200> of<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:37.380> team

defenders that night our main goal was
to<00:00:41.010> win<00:00:41.040> games<00:00:41.450> so<00:00:42.450> yeah<00:00:42.719> we<00:00:42.899> got<00:00:43.020> on<00:00:43.170> a<00:00:43.200> decent

to win games so yeah we got on a decent
win<00:00:43.980> streak<00:00:44.219> I<00:00:44.399> think<00:00:44.610> we<00:00:44.700> hit<00:00:44.789> about<00:00:45.000> 18<00:00:45.390> wins

win streak I think we hit about 18 wins
that<00:00:45.870> night<00:00:46.079> and<00:00:46.289> we<00:00:46.829> definitely<00:00:47.010> would<00:00:47.370> have

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.660 
you still have time to get it back don't
be<00:01:39.869> afraid<00:01:39.990> to<00:01:40.200> take<00:01:40.799> your<00:01:40.950> time<00:01:41.130> and<00:01:41.159> kind<00:01:41.549> of

be afraid to take your time and kind of
be<00:01:41.820> sneaky<00:01:42.360> and<00:01:43.189> use<00:01:44.189> cover<00:01:44.490> to<00:01:44.820> move<00:01:45.060> your<00:01:45.180> way

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
be sneaky and use cover to move your way

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.020 
be sneaky and use cover to move your way
across<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:45.840> map<00:01:46.399> unless<00:01:47.399> they're<00:01:47.670> in<00:01:47.759> a<00:01:47.820> full

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
across the map unless they're in a full

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.789 
across the map unless they're in a full
party<00:01:48.420> it<00:01:48.630> shouldn't<00:01:49.020> be<00:01:49.110> that<00:01:49.140> hard<00:01:49.500> to<00:01:49.619> get

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
party it shouldn't be that hard to get

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.130 
party it shouldn't be that hard to get
the<00:01:49.920> flag<00:01:50.130> back<00:01:50.159> I<00:01:50.700> mean<00:01:51.420> a<00:01:51.720> lot<00:01:51.840> of<00:01:52.049> people

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
the flag back I mean a lot of people

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.560 
the flag back I mean a lot of people
don't<00:01:52.619> realize<00:01:52.710> that<00:01:53.009> the<00:01:53.970> walls<00:01:54.210> in<00:01:54.420> this

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
don't realize that the walls in this

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:55.969 
don't realize that the walls in this
game<00:01:54.810> a<00:01:55.110> lot<00:01:55.350> of<00:01:55.470> the<00:01:55.560> walls<00:01:55.740> for<00:01:55.920> the

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
game a lot of the walls for the

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.039 
game a lot of the walls for the
buildings<00:01:56.369> are<00:01:56.520> just<00:01:56.729> like<00:01:56.850> paper<00:01:57.090> thin<00:01:57.210> so

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
buildings are just like paper thin so

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.380 
buildings are just like paper thin so
some<00:01:58.950> people<00:01:59.219> will<00:01:59.340> take<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.670> flag<00:01:59.909> and<00:02:00.240> then

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
some people will take the flag and then

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:01.609 
some people will take the flag and then
they'll<00:02:00.630> just<00:02:00.780> go<00:02:00.899> to<00:02:00.960> a<00:02:01.200> corner<00:02:01.469> of<00:02:01.560> the

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
they'll just go to a corner of the

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.440 
they'll just go to a corner of the
building<00:02:02.009> thinking<00:02:02.579> they're<00:02:02.700> safe<00:02:02.909> but

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
building thinking they're safe but

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:04.999 
building thinking they're safe but
really<00:02:03.780> you<00:02:03.990> could<00:02:04.560> shoot<00:02:04.799> right<00:02:04.979> through

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
really you could shoot right through

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.770 
really you could shoot right through
that<00:02:05.219> like<00:02:05.579> I<00:02:05.729> can't<00:02:06.030> tell<00:02:06.210> you<00:02:06.329> how<00:02:06.719> many

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
that like I can't tell you how many

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.529 
that like I can't tell you how many
times<00:02:07.110> I've<00:02:07.610> killed<00:02:08.610> a<00:02:08.700> flag<00:02:08.910> guy<00:02:09.090> just<00:02:09.420> by

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
times I've killed a flag guy just by

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.660 
times I've killed a flag guy just by
shooting<00:02:09.840> right<00:02:10.229> through<00:02:10.410> the<00:02:10.500> building

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
shooting right through the building

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.580 
shooting right through the building
I<00:02:11.760> know<00:02:12.240> it<00:02:12.390> seems<00:02:12.510> obvious<00:02:12.750> but<00:02:13.020> believe<00:02:13.470> it

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
I know it seems obvious but believe it

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.230 
I know it seems obvious but believe it
or<00:02:13.650> not<00:02:13.770> a<00:02:13.830> lot<00:02:14.099> of<00:02:14.220> people<00:02:14.459> would<00:02:14.880> ignore

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
or not a lot of people would ignore

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.720 
or not a lot of people would ignore
ignore<00:02:15.599> that<00:02:16.050> and<00:02:16.260> just<00:02:16.709> keep<00:02:17.040> running<00:02:17.430> into

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
ignore that and just keep running into

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.110 
ignore that and just keep running into
the<00:02:17.910> building<00:02:18.270> and<00:02:18.480> keep<00:02:18.810> dying<00:02:19.489> so<00:02:20.489> once<00:02:21.030> you

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
the building and keep dying so once you

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.940 
the building and keep dying so once you
get<00:02:21.209> the<00:02:21.330> flag<00:02:21.569> you<00:02:21.840> and<00:02:21.989> your<00:02:22.110> team<00:02:22.319> want<00:02:22.830> to

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
get the flag you and your team want to

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.580 
get the flag you and your team want to
set<00:02:23.190> up<00:02:23.340> and<00:02:23.610> create<00:02:24.480> a<00:02:24.540> perimeter<00:02:24.810> around<00:02:25.080> the

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
set up and create a perimeter around the

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.240 
set up and create a perimeter around the
flag<00:02:26.099> carrier<00:02:26.870> so<00:02:27.870> right<00:02:28.230> now<00:02:28.260> we<00:02:28.410> have<00:02:28.709> the

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
flag carrier so right now we have the

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.550 
flag carrier so right now we have the
flag<00:02:29.459> guy<00:02:29.670> in<00:02:30.000> a<00:02:30.300> building<00:02:30.690> with<00:02:30.900> two<00:02:31.290> of<00:02:31.410> our

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
flag guy in a building with two of our

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.870 
flag guy in a building with two of our
teammates<00:02:31.950> and<00:02:32.220> they<00:02:33.180> place<00:02:33.420> down<00:02:33.660> the

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 
teammates and they place down the

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.280 
teammates and they place down the
jammers<00:02:35.880> so<00:02:36.090> that<00:02:36.300> when<00:02:36.510> the<00:02:36.600> enemy<00:02:36.870> team<00:02:37.050> gets

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
jammers so that when the enemy team gets

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:38.809 
jammers so that when the enemy team gets
close<00:02:37.500> they<00:02:37.800> still<00:02:38.220> don't<00:02:38.370> know<00:02:38.580> exactly

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819 
close they still don't know exactly

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:41.180 
close they still don't know exactly
where<00:02:39.330> we<00:02:39.360> are<00:02:39.650> one<00:02:40.650> thing<00:02:40.800> I<00:02:40.890> forgot<00:02:40.920> to

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
where we are one thing I forgot to

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.040 
where we are one thing I forgot to
mention<00:02:41.310> earlier<00:02:41.730> about<00:02:42.120> team<00:02:42.390> defender<00:02:42.870> is

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
mention earlier about team defender is

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.100 
mention earlier about team defender is
that<00:02:43.530> the<00:02:44.069> team<00:02:44.310> with<00:02:44.459> the<00:02:44.489> flag<00:02:44.880> shows<00:02:45.660> up<00:02:45.930> on

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
that the team with the flag shows up on

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.440 
that the team with the flag shows up on
the<00:02:46.500> radar<00:02:46.890> for<00:02:47.100> the<00:02:47.310> other<00:02:47.430> team<00:02:47.670> around<00:02:48.180> the

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
the radar for the other team around the

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.920 
the radar for the other team around the
flag<00:02:48.660> carrier<00:02:49.140> in<00:02:49.350> a<00:02:49.620> small<00:02:50.280> area<00:02:50.840> that's<00:02:51.840> a

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
flag carrier in a small area that's a

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.350 
flag carrier in a small area that's a
really<00:02:52.170> cool<00:02:52.380> feature<00:02:52.590> that<00:02:53.040> I<00:02:53.400> like<00:02:53.850> because

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
really cool feature that I like because

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.860 
really cool feature that I like because
this<00:02:55.319> makes<00:02:55.590> it<00:02:55.739> so<00:02:55.890> that<00:02:55.920> the<00:02:56.700> one<00:02:57.420> team<00:02:57.690> won't

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
this makes it so that the one team won't

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.600 
this makes it so that the one team won't
be<00:02:58.049> able<00:02:58.170> to<00:02:58.319> control<00:02:58.650> a<00:02:58.709> flag<00:02:59.040> forever

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
be able to control a flag forever

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:01.370 
be able to control a flag forever
basically<00:03:00.030> it's<00:03:00.660> why<00:03:00.780> the<00:03:00.840> Scrambler<00:03:01.350> is

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
basically it's why the Scrambler is

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.830 
basically it's why the Scrambler is
definitely<00:03:02.100> really<00:03:02.459> useful<00:03:02.910> its<00:03:03.209> radius

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
definitely really useful its radius

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.110 
definitely really useful its radius
isn't<00:03:04.260> as<00:03:04.350> big<00:03:04.560> as<00:03:04.739> it<00:03:04.920> was<00:03:05.069> in<00:03:05.280> black<00:03:05.640> ops<00:03:05.850> I

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
isn't as big as it was in black ops I

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.720 
isn't as big as it was in black ops I
don't<00:03:06.330> think<00:03:06.420> and<00:03:06.810> also<00:03:07.680> it<00:03:07.830> doesn't<00:03:08.040> disable

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
don't think and also it doesn't disable

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.180 
don't think and also it doesn't disable
enemy<00:03:09.630> equipment<00:03:10.080> just<00:03:10.799> like<00:03:10.920> it<00:03:11.040> did<00:03:11.130> in

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
enemy equipment just like it did in

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:12.949 
enemy equipment just like it did in
black<00:03:11.459> ops<00:03:11.670> but<00:03:12.090> it's<00:03:12.330> still<00:03:12.540> very<00:03:12.600> effective

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
black ops but it's still very effective

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:14.840 
black ops but it's still very effective
especially<00:03:13.530> for<00:03:13.980> this<00:03:14.040> game<00:03:14.280> mode<00:03:14.489> I<00:03:14.670> would

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
especially for this game mode I would

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:16.729 
especially for this game mode I would
definitely<00:03:15.000> recommend<00:03:15.380> being<00:03:16.380> a<00:03:16.500> team<00:03:16.709> player

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 
definitely recommend being a team player

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:23.930 
definitely recommend being a team player
slapping<00:03:17.489> that<00:03:17.579> on<00:03:22.190> as<00:03:23.190> you<00:03:23.370> can<00:03:23.459> see<00:03:23.609> here<00:03:23.850> our

reason<00:03:25.829> for<00:03:25.980> this<00:03:26.070> is<00:03:26.130> uh<00:03:26.519> I<00:03:27.230> am<00:03:28.230> a<00:03:28.260> pretty<00:03:28.620> good

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:28.799 
reason for this is uh I am a pretty good

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:30.500 
reason for this is uh I am a pretty good
Slayer<00:03:29.070> i<00:03:29.190> usually<00:03:29.579> get<00:03:29.730> most<00:03:30.060> of<00:03:30.180> the<00:03:30.269> kills

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
Slayer i usually get most of the kills

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.270 
Slayer i usually get most of the kills
if<00:03:30.780> not<00:03:30.959> a<00:03:30.989> lot<00:03:31.350> of<00:03:31.380> the<00:03:31.530> kills<00:03:31.709> for<00:03:31.920> my<00:03:32.040> team

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
if not a lot of the kills for my team

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.670 
if not a lot of the kills for my team
and<00:03:32.549> we<00:03:33.090> decided<00:03:33.390> that<00:03:33.630> i<00:03:33.780> would<00:03:34.019> run<00:03:34.530> the

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
and we decided that i would run the

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.920 
and we decided that i would run the
juggernaut<00:03:35.190> kill<00:03:35.400> streak<00:03:35.670> and<00:03:35.930> hopefully

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
juggernaut kill streak and hopefully

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.380 
juggernaut kill streak and hopefully
that<00:03:37.109> would<00:03:37.200> help<00:03:37.290> us<00:03:37.500> out<00:03:37.590> a<00:03:37.650> lot<00:03:38.060> in<00:03:39.060> theory

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
that would help us out a lot in theory

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:42.680 
that would help us out a lot in theory
it's<00:03:40.019> great<00:03:40.410> and<00:03:40.700> it<00:03:41.700> has<00:03:42.000> helped<00:03:42.390> us<00:03:42.450> out<00:03:42.630> a

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
it's great and it has helped us out a

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:44.960 
it's great and it has helped us out a
lot<00:03:42.900> in<00:03:43.079> a<00:03:43.140> few<00:03:43.350> games<00:03:43.590> but<00:03:44.040> for<00:03:44.609> the<00:03:44.670> most<00:03:44.850> part

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
lot in a few games but for the most part

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.590 
lot in a few games but for the most part
by<00:03:45.329> the<00:03:45.390> time<00:03:45.660> i<00:03:45.690> end<00:03:46.230> up<00:03:46.620> getting<00:03:46.950> it<00:03:47.209> we<00:03:48.209> the

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
by the time i end up getting it we the

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.170 
by the time i end up getting it we the
game<00:03:48.780> is<00:03:48.959> either<00:03:49.290> over<00:03:49.859> or<00:03:49.890> really<00:03:50.820> close<00:03:51.000> to

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
game is either over or really close to

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.000 
game is either over or really close to
over<00:03:51.299> like<00:03:51.720> as<00:03:51.900> you<00:03:52.049> see<00:03:52.230> here<00:03:52.440> the<00:03:52.590> score<00:03:52.859> is

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
over like as you see here the score is

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:55.849 
over like as you see here the score is
not<00:03:53.310> even<00:03:53.549> close<00:03:53.670> and<00:03:54.350> we<00:03:55.350> just<00:03:55.380> finish<00:03:55.799> these

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:55.859 
not even close and we just finish these

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:57.830

really ugly I know but believe it or not
it's<00:04:10.200> actually<00:04:11.040> useful<00:04:11.579> uh<00:04:12.230> it's<00:04:13.230> called<00:04:13.470> the

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:13.769 
it's actually useful uh it's called the

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:15.680 
it's actually useful uh it's called the
trophy<00:04:14.130> system<00:04:14.549> it's<00:04:14.760> brand<00:04:15.030> new<00:04:15.120> to<00:04:15.420> modern

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
trophy system it's brand new to modern

trophy system it's brand new to modern
warfare<00:04:15.720> 3<00:04:16.019> and<00:04:16.470> what<00:04:17.280> it<00:04:17.400> does<00:04:17.519> is<00:04:17.579> it

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:18.440 
warfare 3 and what it does is it

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:21.080 
warfare 3 and what it does is it
deflects<00:04:19.440> any<00:04:19.709> incoming<00:04:20.159> grenades<00:04:20.820> or

explosives or even some kill streaks and

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.610 
explosives or even some kill streaks and
it's<00:04:24.210> really<00:04:24.390> helpful<00:04:24.870> for<00:04:25.200> holding

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
it's really helpful for holding

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:28.850 
it's really helpful for holding
a<00:04:26.130> part<00:04:26.760> of<00:04:26.850> the<00:04:26.940> map<00:04:27.150> it's<00:04:27.930> great<00:04:28.169> for<00:04:28.410> things

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 
a part of the map it's great for things

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:30.530 
a part of the map it's great for things
like<00:04:28.949> team<00:04:29.310> defender<00:04:29.760> obviously<00:04:30.330> and

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:30.540 
like team defender obviously and

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:32.900 
like team defender obviously and
headquarters<00:04:31.530> where<00:04:31.710> you<00:04:31.949> have<00:04:32.430> to<00:04:32.550> control<00:04:32.790> a

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:32.910 
headquarters where you have to control a

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:35.629 
headquarters where you have to control a
small<00:04:33.300> portion<00:04:33.570> of<00:04:33.720> the<00:04:33.780> map<00:04:33.990> so<00:04:34.530> that<00:04:34.639> they

00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:35.639 
small portion of the map so that they

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:37.969 
small portion of the map so that they
can't<00:04:35.910> kill<00:04:36.600> you<00:04:36.720> with<00:04:36.870> great<00:04:37.139> grenades<00:04:37.830> or

00:04:37.969 --> 00:04:37.979 
can't kill you with great grenades or

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:39.980 
can't kill you with great grenades or
anything<00:04:38.370> and<00:04:38.550> it's<00:04:39.300> going<00:04:39.449> to<00:04:39.510> make<00:04:39.630> it<00:04:39.780> a<00:04:39.840> lot

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:39.990 
anything and it's going to make it a lot

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:41.900 
anything and it's going to make it a lot
harder<00:04:40.020> to<00:04:40.500> kill<00:04:40.680> you<00:04:40.830> the<00:04:41.160> only<00:04:41.460> downside<00:04:41.669> is

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:41.910 
harder to kill you the only downside is

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:44.780 
harder to kill you the only downside is
it<00:04:42.240> only<00:04:42.600> has<00:04:42.810> two<00:04:43.199> it<00:04:43.919> can<00:04:44.100> only<00:04:44.160> deflect<00:04:44.610> to

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:44.790 
it only has two it can only deflect to

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:47.780 
it only has two it can only deflect to
explosives<00:04:45.479> but<00:04:45.870> overall<00:04:46.740> it's<00:04:47.100> pretty<00:04:47.130> great

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:47.790 
explosives but overall it's pretty great

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:50.689 
explosives but overall it's pretty great
equipment<00:04:48.060> it's<00:04:49.050> situational<00:04:49.770> but<00:04:50.040> it<00:04:50.280> can<00:04:50.490> be

00:04:50.689 --> 00:04:50.699 
equipment it's situational but it can be

00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:52.909 
equipment it's situational but it can be
great<00:04:50.940> and<00:04:51.210> i<00:04:51.389> would<00:04:51.570> suggest<00:04:51.830> slapping<00:04:52.830> that

00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:52.919 
great and i would suggest slapping that

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:55.340 
great and i would suggest slapping that
on<00:04:53.100> as<00:04:53.280> well<00:04:53.460> so<00:04:54.300> what<00:04:54.660> you're<00:04:54.810> watching<00:04:54.930> here

is me my team defending the flag outside
on<00:04:59.039> the<00:04:59.280> map<00:04:59.430> outpost<00:04:59.970> the<00:05:00.630> reason<00:05:01.050> I'm

00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:01.139 
on the map outpost the reason I'm

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:02.900 
on the map outpost the reason I'm
showing<00:05:01.289> you<00:05:01.470> this<00:05:01.620> is<00:05:01.830> because<00:05:01.910> defending

showing you this is because defending
the<00:05:03.090> flag<00:05:03.330> can<00:05:04.110> be<00:05:04.139> really<00:05:04.800> really<00:05:04.979> different

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:05.550 
the flag can be really really different

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:08.150 
the flag can be really really different
from<00:05:05.880> if<00:05:06.720> you<00:05:06.960> choose<00:05:07.139> spot<00:05:07.500> in<00:05:07.710> a<00:05:07.800> building
