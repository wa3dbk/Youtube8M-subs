on the field the best way to test that

mode and test out the play-action I do

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.090 
mode and test out the play-action I do
strongly<00:00:51.600> recommend<00:00:52.140> running<00:00:52.289> plays<00:00:52.710> and

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
strongly recommend running plays and

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.450 
strongly recommend running plays and
passing<00:00:53.489> plays<00:00:53.730> but

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:55.460 
passing plays but

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:01.010 
passing plays but
running<00:00:56.460> plays<00:00:56.700> are<00:00:57.320> definitely<00:00:59.390> going<00:01:00.390> to<00:01:00.600> be

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
running plays are definitely going to be

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.720 
running plays are definitely going to be
determined<00:01:01.200> by<00:01:01.649> how<00:01:01.860> good<00:01:01.920> your<00:01:02.280> running<00:01:02.579> back

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
determined by how good your running back

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.649 
determined by how good your running back
is<00:01:03.000> how<00:01:03.270> good<00:01:03.329> your<00:01:03.660> offensive<00:01:04.019> line<00:01:04.199> is

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:05.659 
is how good your offensive line is

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:08.750 
is how good your offensive line is
passing<00:01:06.659> plays<00:01:06.869> also<00:01:07.260> dependent<00:01:07.770> on<00:01:07.950> how<00:01:08.580> good

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
passing plays also dependent on how good

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.090 
passing plays also dependent on how good
your<00:01:08.940> receivers<00:01:09.720> are<00:01:09.900> and<00:01:10.200> how<00:01:10.320> accurate<00:01:10.860> your

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
your receivers are and how accurate your

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.150 
your receivers are and how accurate your
quarterback<00:01:11.550> is<00:01:11.990> but<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.080> play<00:01:13.320> action<00:01:13.560> is<00:01:14.100> a

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:14.160 
quarterback is but the play action is a

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.310 
quarterback is but the play action is a
combination<00:01:14.700> of<00:01:15.180> all<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.690> players<00:01:15.930> on<00:01:16.200> the

field<00:01:16.530> on<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:17.400> offense<00:01:17.820> and<00:01:18.650> it's<00:01:19.650> important

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
field on the offense and it's important

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.649 
field on the offense and it's important
for<00:01:21.320> deception<00:01:22.320> to<00:01:23.310> be<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.790> main<00:01:24.000> focus<00:01:24.030> of

you're doing in a play action is you're

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.190 
you're doing in a play action is you're
faking<00:01:33.330> the<00:01:33.450> run<00:01:33.720> and<00:01:34.550> this<00:01:35.550> cannot<00:01:35.910> be<00:01:35.970> done

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
faking the run and this cannot be done

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:41.690 
faking the run and this cannot be done
unless<00:01:37.200> players<00:01:38.039> actually<00:01:38.990> sell<00:01:40.520> sell<00:01:41.520> the

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
unless players actually sell sell the

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.270 
unless players actually sell sell the
play<00:01:41.940> and<00:01:42.210> I<00:01:42.840> played<00:01:43.440> wide<00:01:43.619> receiver<00:01:43.649> in<00:01:44.130> high

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
play and I played wide receiver in high

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.359 
play and I played wide receiver in high
school<00:01:44.580> and<00:01:45.590> that<00:01:46.590> was<00:01:46.710> a<00:01:46.740> good<00:01:46.890> example<00:01:47.310> of

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
school and that was a good example of

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:48.620 
school and that was a good example of
what<00:01:47.520> happens<00:01:47.550> when<00:01:48.000> you<00:01:48.090> hold<00:01:48.240> on<00:01:48.420> to<00:01:48.539> the

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
what happens when you hold on to the

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.400 
what happens when you hold on to the
ball<00:01:48.780> for<00:01:49.020> too<00:01:49.170> long<00:01:49.410> in<00:01:49.740> a<00:01:49.920> play<00:01:50.130> action<00:01:51.410> when

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:52.410 
ball for too long in a play action when

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:54.620 
ball for too long in a play action when
I<00:01:52.440> played<00:01:52.710> wide<00:01:52.890> receiver<00:01:52.920> I<00:01:53.369> learned<00:01:54.119> very

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
I played wide receiver I learned very

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.529 
I played wide receiver I learned very
early<00:01:54.720> that<00:01:55.080> in<00:01:56.070> my<00:01:56.789> opinion<00:01:56.910> the<00:01:57.360> wide

00:01:57.529 --> 00:01:57.539 
early that in my opinion the wide

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:00.200 
early that in my opinion the wide
receivers<00:01:58.229> are<00:01:58.950> one<00:01:59.159> of<00:01:59.250> the<00:01:59.310> most<00:01:59.549> up<00:01:59.820> really

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
receivers are one of the most up really

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.230 
receivers are one of the most up really
pretty<00:02:00.540> much<00:02:00.720> the<00:02:00.869> most<00:02:01.110> important<00:02:01.799> in

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 
pretty much the most important in

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.969 
pretty much the most important in
selling<00:02:03.240> that<00:02:03.509> play<00:02:03.869> because<00:02:04.680> they<00:02:04.860> are<00:02:04.920> the

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
selling that play because they are the

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.039 
selling that play because they are the
ones<00:02:05.189> that<00:02:05.340> are<00:02:05.610> out<00:02:06.240> there<00:02:06.299> to<00:02:06.659> catch<00:02:06.869> the

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
ones that are out there to catch the

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.830 
ones that are out there to catch the
pass<00:02:07.579> but<00:02:08.579> what<00:02:08.790> I<00:02:08.820> was<00:02:09.030> playing<00:02:09.329> I<00:02:09.420> remember

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
that we had to actually make it seem

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.170 
that we had to actually make it seem

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:07.040 
that first down so if you run the play

that first down so if you run the play
action<00:05:07.220> on<00:05:07.520> third<00:05:07.730> and<00:05:07.850> ten<00:05:08.090> and<00:05:08.390> you're

successful more power to you i don't
think<00:05:10.610> it's<00:05:10.730> a<00:05:10.910> wise<00:05:11.630> move<00:05:11.960> in<00:05:12.170> a<00:05:12.260> video<00:05:12.530> game
