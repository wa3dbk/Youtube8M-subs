even better because you can control the
heat<00:00:45.660> settings<00:00:46.110> which<00:00:46.320> is<00:00:46.469> great<00:00:46.680> for<00:00:46.860> your

piece from my Oh wake up and set and

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.070 
piece from my Oh wake up and set and
I'll<00:01:11.880> tell<00:01:12.119> you<00:01:12.240> guys<00:01:12.390> more<00:01:12.689> about<00:01:12.810> these

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
I'll tell you guys more about these

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:22.780 
I'll tell you guys more about these
extensions<00:01:13.799> in<00:01:14.040> a<00:01:14.130> little<00:01:14.369> bit

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:22.790 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.310 

so<00:01:23.790> I<00:01:23.820> like<00:01:24.030> to<00:01:24.060> start<00:01:24.509> by<00:01:24.570> clipping<00:01:24.960> the

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
so I like to start by clipping the

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.410 
so I like to start by clipping the
middle<00:01:25.560> clip<00:01:25.950> in<00:01:26.100> first<00:01:26.399> and<00:01:26.670> then<00:01:26.790> do<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.119> two

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
middle clip in first and then do the two

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.560 
middle clip in first and then do the two
on<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:27.720> sides<00:01:27.960> and<00:01:28.500> I<00:01:29.430> like<00:01:29.610> sectioning<00:01:30.270> each

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
on the sides and I like sectioning each

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.990 
on the sides and I like sectioning each
section<00:01:31.170> into<00:01:31.799> fours<00:01:32.130> if<00:01:32.430> that<00:01:32.670> makes<00:01:32.880> sense

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
section into fours if that makes sense

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.149 
section into fours if that makes sense
so<00:01:33.330> it's<00:01:33.479> easy<00:01:33.659> to<00:01:33.930> just<00:01:34.170> split<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:34.890> hair<00:01:35.039> in

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
so it's easy to just split the hair in

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.340 
so it's easy to just split the hair in
half<00:01:35.310> on<00:01:35.580> each<00:01:35.820> side<00:01:36.090> and<00:01:36.330> then<00:01:36.509> divide<00:01:37.110> each

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
half on each side and then divide each

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.800 
half on each side and then divide each
of<00:01:37.590> those<00:01:37.710> halves<00:01:38.070> into<00:01:38.520> halves<00:01:38.939> again<00:01:39.299> so

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
of those halves into halves again so

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.630 
of those halves into halves again so
first<00:01:40.020> I'll<00:01:40.200> just<00:01:40.229> brush<00:01:40.770> through<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:41.429> piece

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
first I'll just brush through the piece

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.490 
first I'll just brush through the piece
that<00:01:41.850> I'm<00:01:41.939> working<00:01:41.970> with<00:01:42.360> and<00:01:42.720> this<00:01:43.049> helps<00:01:43.409> to

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
that I'm working with and this helps to

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.050 
that I'm working with and this helps to
blend<00:01:43.740> your<00:01:44.009> natural<00:01:44.490> hair<00:01:44.670> with<00:01:44.909> the

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
blend your natural hair with the

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.779 
blend your natural hair with the
extensions<00:01:45.780> before<00:01:46.200> you<00:01:46.320> add<00:01:46.500> heat<00:01:46.770> to<00:01:46.799> it<00:01:47.100> so

00:01:47.779 --> 00:01:47.789 
extensions before you add heat to it so

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:49.550 
extensions before you add heat to it so
using<00:01:48.299> my<00:01:48.330> straightener<00:01:48.780> I'm<00:01:49.049> gonna<00:01:49.259> clamp

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
using my straightener I'm gonna clamp

through<00:03:26.609> when<00:03:26.700> I<00:03:26.760> stoned<00:03:27.030> it<00:03:27.180> again<00:03:27.389> with<00:03:27.540> a

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:27.569 
through when I stoned it again with a

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:29.599 
through when I stoned it again with a
different<00:03:27.959> brand<00:03:28.200> and<00:03:28.590> I<00:03:28.739> liked<00:03:29.010> it<00:03:29.159> more<00:03:29.430> but

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:29.609

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:31.190 
different brand and I liked it more but
I<00:03:29.670> was<00:03:29.849> still<00:03:30.120> having<00:03:30.299> that<00:03:30.540> ombre<00:03:31.019> look

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
I was still having that ombre look

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.830 
I was still having that ombre look
instead<00:03:31.680> of<00:03:31.799> a<00:03:31.920> full<00:03:32.129> balayage<00:03:32.700> effect<00:03:33.209> so<00:03:33.810> I

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
instead of a full balayage effect so I

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.629 
instead of a full balayage effect so I
went<00:03:34.049> back<00:03:34.230> to<00:03:34.260> Sally's<00:03:34.859> and<00:03:35.069> I<00:03:35.129> comb<00:03:35.370> through

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:35.639 
went back to Sally's and I comb through

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:37.819 
went back to Sally's and I comb through
the<00:03:35.730> hair<00:03:35.760> with<00:03:36.239> the<00:03:36.659> honey<00:03:36.930> brown<00:03:37.200> dye<00:03:37.530> from

the Clairol beautiful collection line

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:41.839 
the Clairol beautiful collection line
and<00:03:40.019> this<00:03:40.200> gave<00:03:40.379> my<00:03:40.560> hair<00:03:40.799> less<00:03:41.129> of<00:03:41.370> an<00:03:41.459> ombre

00:03:41.839 --> 00:03:41.849
