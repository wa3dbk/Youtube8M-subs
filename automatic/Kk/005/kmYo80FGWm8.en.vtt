factors you know it's all about balance

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.650 
factors you know it's all about balance
right<00:00:35.040> and<00:00:35.100> you<00:00:35.430> and<00:00:35.640> you<00:00:35.790> have<00:00:36.000> this<00:00:36.180> pre-op

right and you and you have this pre-op

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.380 
right and you and you have this pre-op
photograph<00:00:37.230> to<00:00:37.469> show<00:00:37.579> exactly<00:00:38.579> that<00:00:39.120> and

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
photograph to show exactly that and

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.200 
photograph to show exactly that and
obviously<00:00:40.110> this<00:00:40.860> forehead<00:00:41.460> is<00:00:41.610> way<00:00:41.910> out<00:00:42.180> of

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
obviously this forehead is way out of

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.750 
obviously this forehead is way out of
proportion<00:00:42.930> to<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.469> rest<00:00:43.649> of<00:00:43.800> her<00:00:43.920> face<00:00:44.160> if<00:00:44.700> we

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
proportion to the rest of her face if we

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.610 
proportion to the rest of her face if we
look<00:00:45.059> at<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.239> relationships<00:00:46.050> between<00:00:46.289> the

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
look at the relationships between the

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.430 
look at the relationships between the
top<00:00:46.860> of<00:00:47.070> her<00:00:47.190> brow<00:00:47.520> and<00:00:47.910> where<00:00:48.600> this<00:00:48.870> hairline

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
top of her brow and where this hairline

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.770 
top of her brow and where this hairline
starts<00:00:49.950> and<00:00:50.129> we<00:00:50.190> don't<00:00:50.399> this<00:00:50.910> thinning<00:00:51.300> hair

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
starts and we don't this thinning hair

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.500 
starts and we don't this thinning hair
is<00:00:51.989> not<00:00:52.469> really<00:00:52.920> her<00:00:53.039> hairline<00:00:53.370> her<00:00:53.789> hairline

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
is not really her hairline her hairline

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.319 
is not really her hairline her hairline
is<00:00:54.870> up<00:00:55.500> in<00:00:55.680> there<00:00:55.949> so<00:00:56.250> what<00:00:56.430> we<00:00:56.550> want<00:00:56.820> to<00:00:56.940> do<00:00:57.120> is

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
is up in there so what we want to do is

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.229 
is up in there so what we want to do is

time<00:02:13.120> and<00:02:13.450> we'll<00:02:13.960> camouflage<00:02:14.620> it<00:02:14.860> to<00:02:15.040> the

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
time and we'll camouflage it to the

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:17.250 
time and we'll camouflage it to the
point<00:02:15.340> where<00:02:15.490> it's<00:02:15.990> practically<00:02:16.990> invisible

and finally some before and after
pictures<00:02:20.140> so<00:02:20.800> we<00:02:20.920> have<00:02:21.040> two<00:02:21.220> patients<00:02:21.490> that<00:02:21.790> we

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
pictures so we have two patients that we

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.360 
pictures so we have two patients that we
can<00:02:22.120> see<00:02:22.330> clearly<00:02:22.630> in<00:02:23.050> both<00:02:23.290> of<00:02:23.530> these<00:02:23.770> the

can see clearly in both of these the

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.610 
can see clearly in both of these the
foreheads<00:02:24.970> look<00:02:25.240> too<00:02:25.480> large<00:02:25.750> particularly<00:02:26.350> in

it's more of a generalized issue and

it's more of a generalized issue and
those<00:03:18.100> guys<00:03:18.490> are<00:03:18.730> usually<00:03:18.910> would<00:03:19.390> generalize

benefit more from other procedures like

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.350 
benefit more from other procedures like
hair<00:03:26.350> grafting<00:03:27.010> or<00:03:27.490> you<00:03:27.910> know<00:03:27.970> there<00:03:28.150> are<00:03:28.210> new

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:28.360 
hair grafting or you know there are new

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.630 
hair grafting or you know there are new
techniques<00:03:28.870> like<00:03:29.200> micropigmentation<00:03:29.830> of<00:03:30.490> the

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:30.640 
techniques like micropigmentation of the

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.180 
techniques like micropigmentation of the
scalp<00:03:30.940> to<00:03:31.540> decrease<00:03:32.230> that<00:03:32.260> contrast<00:03:33.040> between

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190 
scalp to decrease that contrast between
