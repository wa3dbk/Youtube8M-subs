00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:18.140
 always had some touches me 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.820
 they were very annoying 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.080
 some more specifically at the time of 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.449
 to sleep 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.150
 one of these stocks was to leave some 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.330
 door of the wardrobe open as it always 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.669
 gave me the feeling of having it in there 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:36.750
 someone or something that could get 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:39.210
 watching the whole night so always 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.620
 had to raise and lock all 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.230
 doors 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.719
 otherwise I would not be able to sleep 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.309
 no way 

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:50.160
 Another thing that bothered me a lot in 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.410
 my room was a large mirror that with 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.270
 certainty was planned to be built-in. 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.789
 along with the wall 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.859
 I do not know who had the idea but when 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:03.300
 My parents bought the house many years ago. 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:05.400
 behind it was already there in the reflection of this 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.170
 mirror I could see one of the 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.710
 corridors where I lived 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.810
 it made me shiver because whenever 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:16.520
 looked at him it seemed that someone 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:19.380
 would be standing there looking at me 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.390
 but it was not only that 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.119
 I was too scared to sleep in the 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.250
 dark and always left the light of my 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:29.189
 room lit for more quiet sleep 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:32.090
 but my parents always insisted turn it off 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:35.040
 after I fell asleep 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:37.350
 I knew this because sometimes when I wake up 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.570
 at dawn or the other day in the morning 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.340
 she was off 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:45.149
 so I was sure that he would always 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.100
 they would go out in that 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.750
 night 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:51.210
 I think in some important dinners 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.320
 business or simply just wanted to 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.570
 get out a little 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.690
 will be 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:58.700
 and since I already have 13 to 14 years 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:01.900
 I think it was large enough to 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:04.360
 spend a night alone with a pizza base 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:07.400
 internet cooler 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:10.250
 I was excited about the idea would 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:13.310
 spend the night alone my 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.900
 first night without an adult nearby that 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.709
 the teenager would not get excited about 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.920
 that 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:20.900
 and has more for the first time to sleep 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.870
 whole night with the light on 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:27.890
 At last the house now mine by dawn 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:29.959
 whole until they returned fire 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.420
 me from my parents who would not 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:33.350
 morning around 10 in the morning as 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.989
 they said 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:37.730
 after that I turned on the television and 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:41.690
 I put a tv channel to try 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:43.610
 watch some movie but I do not know 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.890
 giving me an affliction staying there alone 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.930
 in that room 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:49.640
 so I decided to go to my room where 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.850
 I turned on the computer and went sailing 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.950
 little on the internet 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:57.080
 I happen to find a page of terror 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:59.390
 I was reading a post saying that 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:01.850
 some spirits managed to appear to 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:04.280
 people in the form of dreams 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:05.750
 so when you wake up you 'd think 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.900
 they were never there 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:10.519
 It made me shiver and solved. 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:13.040
 turn off the computer 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:14.930
 I took a shower , put on my pajamas and went 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:18.560
 straight to the bed 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:20.630
 and of course do not turn off the light and so I stayed 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.040
 thinking about some things until you get the 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:26.680
 sleep 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:29.799
 but that night I had a nightmare 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:32.799
 a shadow of a person walking from 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:36.069
 totally bizarre way he was walking 

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:38.920
 corridor and I managed to see the hair 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:41.650
 mirror reflection from my bedroom 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:44.650
 she walked in a horrible way 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:46.540
 the steps will be crooked and her waist 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:49.000
 it seemed like it was soft 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:53.920
 the body falling from one side to the other 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:55.659
 while she walked that walked 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:58.989
 up to my bedroom door 

00:03:55.659 --> 00:04:02.400
 I turned the light off and stood there watching me 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:02.400
 in total darkness 

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:09.790
 after the fright of the early morning and 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:12.959
 I can only think of one thing who 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:12.959
 Turned off the light from my room. 

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:38.919
