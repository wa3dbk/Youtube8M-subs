00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.670
 mushrooms are one of my ingredients 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:08.340
 favorite with the ribs I used the 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.650
 champignons for their firm consistency 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.190
 but there are endless varieties of mushrooms 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.360
 perfect for ghettos with slow culture 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:17.220
 to know more 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.580
 listen to the borough's greengrocer 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.289
 market friends forster 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.960
 I started working at the counter 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.699
 of my father's fruit with his 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.869
 experience can write an encyclopedia 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.869
 of mushrooms 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:35.960
 the fundamental rule concerning i 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:38.449
 mushrooms is that you have to buy them only 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.100
 When they sometimes buy fresh 

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:42.949
 of products because we are attracted to 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:45.260
 perfume the mushrooms do not smell good 

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:48.829
 so to understand which ones are good 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:50.600
 one must observe their sight and meaning 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:55.309
 most important when buying 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:57.769
 mushrooms this is the Spanish mushroom is 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:01:00.079
 fantastic and it's very difficult to 

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:02.929
 find in the woods the particular thing is 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:06.259
 that tastes of wood and that 

00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:07.640
 cooking it, its flavor increases 

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:09.170
 Spanish are ideal 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.240
 especially when you prepare i 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.369
 the excellent laborers are also the 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.310
 so-called death trumpets from 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:18.350
 very intense flavor another variety 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.360
 which you must taste on mayfield early 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.179
 delicious cooked in a pan with butter 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.770
 parsley and garlic 

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:25.970
 when you are dealing with mushrooms 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.399
 not cultivated 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.710
 you have to clean them for good it is a 

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:32.539
 very slow process , remember not to 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:35.180
 never use water with mushrooms because 

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:37.790
 you risk ruining the pleurotus funds 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:40.909
 they are very meaty and they really are 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:43.250
 delicious tasty to see if they are 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:46.579
 fresh must be bright when 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:48.829
 they are old are gray 

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:51.079
 pleurotus mushrooms are grown 

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:53.750
 also on an industrial level as well as i 

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:57.020
 perfect inoki mushrooms in salads and 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.460

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.590
 for last 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:03.920
 obviously the best ones ever are 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:09.979
 truffles are very sought after have a 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:13.010
 intense odor is an engine or difficult to 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:15.590
 describe why the truffle is unique 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.720
 it is clear the more intense its scent will be 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.030
 and therefore very little will be needed when 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:23.030
 cooked a dish to look for them one 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:25.370

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:28.519
 instead the dogs because the pigs if them 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:31.069

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:33.290
 of the most expensive ingredients in the world

 it's great to eat raw dashed 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.790
