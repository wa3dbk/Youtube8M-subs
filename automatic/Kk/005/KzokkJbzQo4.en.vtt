00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 and you saw that the digital version of gta 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.899
 five playstation 3 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.780
 runs worse than the same disk version 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:12.750
 the digital version runs at worst 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.030
 k and was compared by the digital site 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.029
 I said then this comparison showed that 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.109
 the game turned him in hd rotated there by 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.840
 digital version 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:24.689
 shows some things that neither objects 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.609
 which appear half the mind a scenario 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.070
 called the spared 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:32.130
 the textures also not so great thing 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.260
 it looks like there is an average texture 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.329
 quality and know that the details of the 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.850
 car headlights and also notice a 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.500
 good sharpness difference and when you 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.110
 drive at high speed 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.600
 parties appear from the city to the 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.700
 few like in those games a little more 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.850
 of the other test is also done 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:54.000
 knows that within ps 13 has hdl hogan 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:56.489
 from it you can exchange for another hd 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.230
 notebook is similar and the next 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.719
 they exchanged they put on sale for more 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.539
 fastest speed in 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.850
 of playstation 3 and ran a little better 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.710
 improved the group that improves 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.820
 things have been appearing 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.119
 faster 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.520
 gta 5 only it was not the same versions of 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.950
 disk the solution is true all this 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.840
 happens because I said that it runs with the 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.369
 speed and hd also counts on the 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.530
 speed together with the two 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.560
 speeds is what makes the version 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.869
 Really good what gta5 rod da 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.780
 their maximum quality these observations 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:33.560
 not official and rockstar not yet 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.970
 commented on the problem 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.810
 stock arrives the hour I comment 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.810
 It's about the problem. 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:48.260
 the game over for now to comment 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.260
 about the problem
