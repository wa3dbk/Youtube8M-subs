with<00:06:53.040> Fay<00:06:53.250> blades<00:06:53.580> I<00:06:55.370> think<00:06:56.370> those<00:06:56.490> weapons

00:06:56.630 --> 00:06:56.640 
with Fay blades I think those weapons

00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:57.830 
with Fay blades I think those weapons
are<00:06:56.880> really<00:06:57.090> cool<00:06:57.300> I<00:06:57.330> just<00:06:57.570> think<00:06:57.690> they're

00:06:57.830 --> 00:06:57.840 
are really cool I just think they're

00:06:57.840 --> 00:06:59.900 
are really cool I just think they're
really<00:06:57.870> weak<00:06:58.320> so<00:06:58.560> I<00:06:58.590> don't<00:06:58.830> really<00:06:59.130> use<00:06:59.400> them<00:06:59.610> I

00:06:59.900 --> 00:06:59.910 
really weak so I don't really use them I

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:01.970
