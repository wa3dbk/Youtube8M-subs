truck number one we've hit our Enter key
and<00:01:20.000> we<00:01:20.720> now<00:01:20.950> begin<00:01:21.950> the<00:01:22.220> unloading<00:01:22.610> process

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640 
and we now begin the unloading process

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:29.340 
and we now begin the unloading process
by<00:01:23.270> engaging<00:01:23.630> our<00:01:23.899> PTO<00:01:24.289> and<00:01:24.619> raising<00:01:25.280> our<00:01:25.369> rpms

once<00:01:30.350> we<00:01:30.530> have<00:01:30.649> done<00:01:30.829> that<00:01:31.070> the<00:01:31.430> indicator

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
once we have done that the indicator

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.260 
once we have done that the indicator
will<00:01:32.119> tell<00:01:32.390> us<00:01:32.570> to<00:01:32.750> engage<00:01:32.899> our<00:01:33.259> hydraulics

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.270 
will tell us to engage our hydraulics

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:38.469 
will tell us to engage our hydraulics
and<00:01:36.100> finally<00:01:37.100> verify<00:01:37.759> that<00:01:38.000> everything<00:01:38.119> is

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479 
and finally verify that everything is

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:41.020 
and finally verify that everything is

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
correct and the auto unload process will

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.910 
correct and the auto unload process will
begin<00:01:43.810> the<00:01:44.810> operator<00:01:45.259> will<00:01:45.409> continue<00:01:45.829> to

being<00:02:49.519> able<00:02:49.760> to<00:02:49.940> preset<00:02:50.540> the<00:02:50.690> pounds<00:02:51.140> each

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
being able to preset the pounds each

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.319 
being able to preset the pounds each
truck<00:02:51.890> at<00:02:52.069> all<00:02:52.250> and<00:02:52.640> then<00:02:52.730> have<00:02:52.879> the<00:02:53.060> cart

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:53.329 
truck at all and then have the cart

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:55.720 
truck at all and then have the cart
automatically<00:02:54.140> load<00:02:54.379> that<00:02:54.650> weight<00:02:54.920> by<00:02:55.250> simply

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
automatically load that weight by simply

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.250 
automatically load that weight by simply
choosing<00:02:56.120> that<00:02:56.269> truck<00:02:56.599> and<00:02:56.750> the<00:02:56.840> monitor

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
choosing that truck and the monitor

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.349 
choosing that truck and the monitor
ensures<00:02:57.799> compliance<00:02:58.280> with<00:02:58.640> load<00:02:58.819> them<00:02:59.030> as

00:02:59.349 --> 00:02:59.359 
ensures compliance with load them as

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:01.780 
ensures compliance with load them as
also<00:02:59.750> saves<00:03:00.290> on<00:03:00.500> fuel<00:03:00.530> by<00:03:01.159> reducing<00:03:01.670> the

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
also saves on fuel by reducing the

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:03.610 
also saves on fuel by reducing the
number<00:03:02.090> of<00:03:02.209> short<00:03:02.480> moles<00:03:02.720> going<00:03:03.109> to<00:03:03.260> market

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
number of short moles going to market

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.830 
number of short moles going to market
and<00:03:03.859> thus<00:03:04.129> the<00:03:04.430> total<00:03:04.609> loads<00:03:04.940> by<00:03:05.329> maximizing

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
and thus the total loads by maximizing

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.050 
and thus the total loads by maximizing
each<00:03:06.290> load<00:03:06.620> and<00:03:07.040> making<00:03:07.400> it<00:03:07.489> simpler<00:03:07.760> for<00:03:07.849> the

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
each load and making it simpler for the

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:43.750 
each load and making it simpler for the
operator

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760
