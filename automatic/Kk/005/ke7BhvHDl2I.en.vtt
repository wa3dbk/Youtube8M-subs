00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
show you guys it's like from the

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.450 
show you guys it's like from the
seventies<00:00:11.910> and<00:00:12.290> it's<00:00:13.290> solid<00:00:13.799> state<00:00:14.040> and<00:00:14.280> it's

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
seventies and it's solid state and it's

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.380 
seventies and it's solid state and it's
the<00:00:14.730> echo<00:00:15.179> chorus<00:00:15.509> and<00:00:16.640> it<00:00:17.640> has<00:00:17.880> some<00:00:18.240> pretty

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
the echo chorus and it has some pretty

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.090 
the echo chorus and it has some pretty
cool<00:00:18.600> features<00:00:19.140> mostly<00:00:19.560> what<00:00:19.740> I'll<00:00:19.830> be<00:00:19.920> using

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
cool features mostly what I'll be using

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.390 
cool features mostly what I'll be using
is<00:00:20.340> the<00:00:20.490> pool<00:00:20.670> feedback<00:00:21.270> feature<00:00:21.539> that

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:22.400 
is the pool feedback feature that

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.590 
is the pool feedback feature that
feedback<00:00:23.400> feature<00:00:23.670> like<00:00:24.000> that's<00:00:24.269> something

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
feedback feature like that's something

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.890 
feedback feature like that's something
new<00:00:25.310> but<00:00:26.310> on<00:00:26.550> this<00:00:26.880> pedal<00:00:27.240> the<00:00:27.359> feedback<00:00:27.720> will

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
new but on this pedal the feedback will

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.310 
new but on this pedal the feedback will
actually<00:00:28.289> go<00:00:29.070> past<00:00:29.490> what<00:00:30.359> most<00:00:30.570> other<00:00:30.869> pedals

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
actually go past what most other pedals

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.990 
actually go past what most other pedals
will<00:00:31.710> do<00:00:31.859> so<00:00:32.189> it<00:00:32.340> ends<00:00:32.579> up<00:00:32.640> with<00:00:32.790> this<00:00:32.850> really

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
will do so it ends up with this really

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.840 
will do so it ends up with this really
distorted<00:00:33.600> buzzy<00:00:34.020> sound<00:00:34.100> that's<00:00:35.100> really<00:00:35.610> cool

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
distorted buzzy sound that's really cool

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.150 
distorted buzzy sound that's really cool
and<00:00:36.120> if<00:00:36.630> you<00:00:36.690> use<00:00:36.809> that<00:00:37.050> with<00:00:37.230> the<00:00:37.469> delay<00:00:37.920> knob

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
and if you use that with the delay knob

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.010 
and if you use that with the delay knob
the<00:00:38.430> speed<00:00:38.670> it<00:00:38.940> creates<00:00:39.480> some<00:00:39.629> really<00:00:39.870> cool

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
the speed it creates some really cool

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.240 
the speed it creates some really cool
sound<00:00:40.290> so<00:00:40.500> I<00:00:40.530> just<00:00:40.680> wanted<00:00:40.860> to<00:00:40.920> show<00:00:41.070> you<00:00:41.100> guys

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
sound so I just wanted to show you guys

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.700 
sound so I just wanted to show you guys
I<00:00:41.640> need<00:00:42.059> you<00:00:42.149> to<00:00:42.180> create<00:00:42.450> our<00:00:42.660> FX<00:00:42.930> 15-2<00:00:43.500> run<00:00:43.530> the

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
I need you to create our FX 15-2 run the

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.430 
I need you to create our FX 15-2 run the
pedal<00:00:43.950> through<00:00:44.100> and<00:00:44.840> it's<00:00:45.840> just<00:00:46.140> distorted

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
pedal through and it's just distorted

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.860 
pedal through and it's just distorted
and<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:47.160> pedals<00:00:47.399> going<00:00:47.640> directly<00:00:47.969> into<00:00:48.090> it<00:00:48.420> so

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
and the pedals going directly into it so

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.290 
and the pedals going directly into it so
you<00:00:49.500> get<00:00:49.590> that<00:00:49.710> distorted<00:00:50.190> delay<00:00:50.550> thing<00:00:50.850> going

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
you get that distorted delay thing going

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.080 
you get that distorted delay thing going
on<00:00:51.800> either<00:00:52.800> way<00:00:52.980> and<00:00:53.219> this<00:00:53.280> is<00:00:53.430> a<00:00:53.460> switch<00:00:53.910> by

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
on either way and this is a switch by

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.680 
on either way and this is a switch by
brazil<00:00:54.480> guitar<00:00:55.199> pretty<00:00:56.010> cool<00:00:56.160> guitar<00:00:56.600> if<00:00:57.600> you

so if there's any of you circuitbenders

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:55.840 
so if there's any of you circuitbenders
out<00:04:54.410> there<00:04:54.590> you<00:04:54.710> might<00:04:54.890> really<00:04:55.130> like<00:04:55.280> messing
