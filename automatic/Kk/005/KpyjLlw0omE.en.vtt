the<00:04:32.950> most<00:04:33.160> experienced<00:04:33.820> healthy<00:04:34.300> young<00:04:34.419> guys

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:34.630 
the most experienced healthy young guys

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:36.870 
the most experienced healthy young guys
out<00:04:34.870> but<00:04:35.680> the<00:04:35.980> biggest<00:04:36.130> thing<00:04:36.400> was<00:04:36.460> just<00:04:36.669> to

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:36.880 
out but the biggest thing was just to

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:39.240 
out but the biggest thing was just to
stay<00:04:37.120> relaxed<00:04:37.570> at<00:04:37.810> home<00:04:37.840> I<00:04:38.380> know<00:04:38.770> it<00:04:39.040> might<00:04:39.220> be

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:39.250 
stay relaxed at home I know it might be

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:41.430 
stay relaxed at home I know it might be
sad<00:04:39.640> but<00:04:39.940> it<00:04:40.030> needs<00:04:40.510> that<00:04:40.630> he<00:04:40.720> said<00:04:40.960> that<00:04:41.200> it's

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:41.440 
sad but it needs that he said that it's

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.170 
sad but it needs that he said that it's
it's<00:04:41.800> just<00:04:42.040> it's<00:04:42.370> just<00:04:42.430> like<00:04:42.580> any<00:04:42.820> other<00:04:42.910> beat

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:43.180 
it's just it's just like any other beat

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:45.780 
it's just it's just like any other beat
so<00:04:43.930> I<00:04:43.960> think<00:04:44.140> staying<00:04:44.800> calm<00:04:45.100> not<00:04:45.430> letting<00:04:45.669> that

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:45.790 
so I think staying calm not letting that

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:48.270 
so I think staying calm not letting that
