00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:12.450
 Hi, people we are at party time. 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.070
 Junina and this time I'm going to leave a little bit 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.839
 of traditional recipes that I 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.820
 to teach you how to make a quota 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:23.449
 That pack is a delight. Let's go. 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:27.930
 there 30 units of chocolate donut 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:31.260
 100 grams of butter eight units of 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:36.170
 paÃ§oquinha half a cup of cream tea 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.170
 of milk and two eggs 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.360
 this recipe I will need to make a 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.820
 then I'll make that 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.260
 Classic bocce plus butter here at 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.450
 If I'm using donuts 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.670
 chocolate but you can use which one you 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.170
 want the taste also does not matter that I 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.700
 I'll look for everything here on the processor. 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.969
 but you can also do it on 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:57.829
 blender using the pulse button and 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.829
 I'll look to become a daughter. 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.940
 now condition that butter you 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.710
 can also pass margarine or 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.720
 add a little and beat because at 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.460
 times just a little bit of enough 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:14.970
 even because I'm already wearing boules 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:18.180
 buttery then got well formed 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:21.290
 a mass but I think you still need 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.290
 a little more butter 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:29.930
 I'm going to spice it up with a spoon. 

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:29.930
 to be able to release 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.619
 I'm going to hit a little more 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:37.679
 Now, yes, I had a tightly knitted dough. 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.560
 also it together 

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:42.630
 now I'll put everything in the picture here 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.280
 my form is quite small but if 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.920
 You can double that recipe. 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.030
 making a bigger shape in my case not 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.380
 I'll say inform 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.539
 so that's why I'm doing this 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.090
 you want, then a form of 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:57.460
 Removable background need not be in 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:02:00.140
 nothing because it already has enough fat 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.190
 pay well here in the background and also upload 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.960
 here on the sides 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:04.400
 I do not want a very thick layer 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.970
 because otherwise it is difficult to cut and 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:09.530
 even eating does not spread well after 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.630
 putting the dough in shape is important 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.190
 make a few holes with place for 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.530
 because we're going now. 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.430
 there go pass by 180 degrees for ten 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.020
 little 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:23.270
 but it's just to hurry you do not have to leave 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:25.100
 she will look crunchy now while 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:26.870
 the dough is thinking about the oven I go 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:28.430
 Here prepare the cream for this is 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.830
 condition the cream here I 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.840
 I'm using it from cans in serum. 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.850
 It is important to use the 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.040
 because his fat is bigger 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:41.660
 that the box also condition the 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:43.960
 eggs and I'm going to beat up treating myself a lot 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.960
 good 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:49.110
 Now I'll join you here, peace. 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:51.510
 in this recipe I will not use sugar 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:53.460
 Why did you pull my sweater off so sweetly? 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.380
 your experiment cream and see if you need 

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:58.350
 sugar and then you hit it. 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:00.150
 I 'm not going to talk about cnaa any more 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:01.980
 I'm using this type of cork but you 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:05.670
 you can use that square as well 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:08.660
 It's okay to mix everything up. 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.660
 to be okay compared 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:19.310
 it is already well mixed and now it's just 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:21.709
 to pass on to ours is put here and this 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:23.959
 mass as it has no yeast it does not 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:26.720
 grows a lot but it grows a little bit 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:28.250
 case the eggs then tried to pass 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.900
 too much of the limit of its shape to 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.849
 to be in danger of overflowing 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:35.720
 I'm going to give a little shake to 

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:37.819
 set everything up very well and now it's just 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:40.010
 carry the preheated oven to 200 degrees 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:42.260
 for about 30 minutes or until you take the test 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:43.430
 of the toothpick and leave afterwards is good 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:47.750
 to the refrigerator to give a 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:49.549
 and then just enjoy and 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:51.409
 Tortinha was ready and if you want 

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:53.569
 make it even more beautiful you can do 

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:55.280
 I did it here to decorate the whipped cream or 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:56.000
 with chocolate ganache what you 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.989
 want to 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.989
 now to prove 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:07.970
 and with a crispy bowl pitcher 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:10.580
 the center is very soft where the peace 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:12.319
 if you do not make much peace here 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:18.220
 still for a little bit like this 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:18.220
 Do at home and talk what you found 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:26.160
 Hi, people we are at party time. 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:31.220
 But this time I decided to make a 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:31.220
 equal fat of fat is greater 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:40.560
 So or so but I do not know I 'm not going 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:45.500
 hit 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:45.500
 No, I did not hit the long ball.
