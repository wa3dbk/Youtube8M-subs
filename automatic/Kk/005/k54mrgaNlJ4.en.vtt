00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.140 
here this is the Gerber clutch mini
plier<00:01:07.080> tool<00:01:07.439> and<00:01:07.740> it's<00:01:08.430> kind<00:01:08.610> of<00:01:08.670> competing<00:01:09.000> I

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
plier tool and it's kind of competing I

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.370 
plier tool and it's kind of competing I
guess<00:01:09.330> with<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:10.189> the<00:01:11.189> leatherman<00:01:12.380> the

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
guess with the the leatherman the

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.289 
guess with the the leatherman the
miniature<00:01:13.799> like<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.159> juices<00:01:14.700> or<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:14.970> squirts

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
miniature like the juices or the squirts

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:16.940 
miniature like the juices or the squirts
or<00:01:15.540> something<00:01:15.840> against<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.229> smaller<00:01:16.500> ones<00:01:16.770> of

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
or something against the smaller ones of

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.969 
or something against the smaller ones of
the<00:01:17.580> two<00:01:17.759> and<00:01:17.970> this<00:01:18.750> has<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.140> pliers<00:01:19.439> it's<00:01:19.860> got

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
the two and this has the pliers it's got

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.140 
the two and this has the pliers it's got
a<00:01:20.009> couple<00:01:20.220> of<00:01:20.369> different<00:01:20.610> things<00:01:20.790> on<00:01:20.939> it<00:01:21.090> I

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
a couple of different things on it I

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.270 
a couple of different things on it I
think<00:01:21.180> a<00:01:21.360> blade<00:01:21.600> can<00:01:22.020> opener<00:01:22.470> small

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
think a blade can opener small

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.429 
think a blade can opener small
screwdrivers<00:01:24.119> stuff<00:01:24.750> like<00:01:24.960> that<00:01:24.990> and<00:01:25.200> I<00:01:25.409> think

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
screwdrivers stuff like that and I think

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.920 
screwdrivers stuff like that and I think
this<00:01:25.650> would<00:01:25.740> be<00:01:25.770> pretty<00:01:26.100> good<00:01:26.250> size<00:01:26.520> and<00:01:26.930> for

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
this would be pretty good size and for

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.289 
this would be pretty good size and for
the<00:01:27.990> weight<00:01:28.200> and<00:01:28.409> everything<00:01:28.500> like<00:01:28.890> that<00:01:29.299> it's

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
the weight and everything like that it's

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.359 
the weight and everything like that it's
only<00:01:30.420> two<00:01:30.600> point<00:01:30.869> four<00:01:31.079> ounces<00:01:31.560> and<00:01:31.799> two<00:01:32.189> and<00:01:32.310> a

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
only two point four ounces and two and a

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.520 
only two point four ounces and two and a
half<00:01:32.460> inches<00:01:32.640> long<00:01:33.150> when<00:01:33.390> it's<00:01:33.540> closed<00:01:33.869> so<00:01:34.320> I

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
half inches long when it's closed so I

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.170 
half inches long when it's closed so I
think<00:01:35.100> as<00:01:35.250> far<00:01:35.310> as<00:01:35.490> fitting<00:01:35.700> in<00:01:35.759> your<00:01:35.850> pocket

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
think as far as fitting in your pocket

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.460 
think as far as fitting in your pocket
and<00:01:36.210> everything<00:01:36.509> that's<00:01:36.570> pretty<00:01:36.900> decent<00:01:37.380> I

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
and everything that's pretty decent I

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.679 
and everything that's pretty decent I
mean<00:01:37.530> that's<00:01:37.799> compared<00:01:38.490> to<00:01:38.610> about<00:01:38.790> I<00:01:39.270> guess

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
mean that's compared to about I guess

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.420 
mean that's compared to about I guess
you're<00:01:39.840> average-sized<00:01:40.380> folder<00:01:40.920> or<00:01:41.070> something

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
you're average-sized folder or something

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:42.770 
you're average-sized folder or something

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
to be able to fit this much into that

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.289 
to be able to fit this much into that
smaller<00:01:43.350> package<00:01:43.829> that<00:01:43.950> is<00:01:44.070> pretty<00:01:44.280> cool<00:01:44.490> so

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
smaller package that is pretty cool so

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.359 
smaller package that is pretty cool so
we'll<00:01:46.020> check<00:01:46.259> that<00:01:46.320> out<00:01:46.530> and<00:01:46.890> see<00:01:47.040> how<00:01:47.189> that

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
we'll check that out and see how that

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.660 
we'll check that out and see how that
works<00:01:47.579> and<00:01:48.439> next<00:01:49.439> we<00:01:49.680> have<00:01:49.829> our<00:01:50.070> streamlight

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
works and next we have our streamlight

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.780 
works and next we have our streamlight

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
showing the brightness like kind of

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.350 
showing the brightness like kind of
demonstrating<00:02:12.720> lumens<00:02:13.050> on

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
demonstrating lumens on

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:14.550 
demonstrating lumens on
all<00:02:13.390> of<00:02:13.480> these<00:02:13.630> lights<00:02:14.080> here<00:02:14.320> I've<00:02:14.410> got<00:02:14.440> a

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
all of these lights here I've got a

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:15.990 
all of these lights here I've got a
couple<00:02:14.770> others<00:02:15.070> to<00:02:15.250> that<00:02:15.430> I<00:02:15.460> want<00:02:15.610> to<00:02:15.700> throw<00:02:15.820> in

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
couple others to that I want to throw in

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.640 
couple others to that I want to throw in
there<00:02:16.120> and<00:02:16.840> I've<00:02:16.930> got<00:02:17.050> another<00:02:17.230> video<00:02:17.590> that

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
there and I've got another video that

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.800 
there and I've got another video that
I'll<00:02:17.980> probably<00:02:18.130> take<00:02:18.790> down<00:02:19.060> and<00:02:19.360> replace<00:02:19.780> with

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
I'll probably take down and replace with

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:21.810 
I'll probably take down and replace with
this<00:02:20.320> one<00:02:20.530> after<00:02:21.040> having<00:02:21.220> so<00:02:21.520> many<00:02:21.610> more

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:21.820 
this one after having so many more

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:24.300 
this one after having so many more
lights<00:02:22.030> added<00:02:22.390> to<00:02:22.540> it<00:02:22.690> but<00:02:23.410> you<00:02:23.740> get<00:02:23.860> lanyards

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
lights added to it but you get lanyards

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.090 
lights added to it but you get lanyards
on<00:02:24.460> both<00:02:24.870> it<00:02:25.870> is<00:02:26.020> nice<00:02:26.230> this<00:02:26.410> is<00:02:26.560> a<00:02:26.590> triple-a

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.100 
on both it is nice this is a triple-a

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.760 
on both it is nice this is a triple-a
and<00:02:27.340> this<00:02:27.970> here<00:02:28.180> uses<00:02:28.570> some<00:02:29.290> little<00:02:29.500> button

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
and this here uses some little button

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:31.410 
and this here uses some little button
batteries<00:02:30.220> or<00:02:30.430> something<00:02:30.730> like<00:02:30.820> that<00:02:30.880> watch

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
batteries or something like that watch

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.360 
batteries or something like that watch
batteries<00:02:31.900> probably<00:02:32.290> so<00:02:32.890> you<00:02:32.980> have<00:02:33.100> to<00:02:33.190> pick

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
batteries probably so you have to pick

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.670 
batteries probably so you have to pick
those<00:02:33.550> up<00:02:33.580> but<00:02:34.060> I<00:02:34.090> mean<00:02:34.300> for<00:02:34.750> the<00:02:34.840> size<00:02:35.080> and<00:02:35.470> the

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
those up but I mean for the size and the

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.070 
those up but I mean for the size and the
weight<00:02:35.710> that's<00:02:36.190> insane<00:02:36.640> so<00:02:37.000> this<00:02:37.690> be<00:02:37.840> a<00:02:37.900> pretty

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
weight that's insane so this be a pretty

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.960 
weight that's insane so this be a pretty
good<00:02:38.260> addition<00:02:38.680> I<00:02:38.740> think<00:02:39.010> and<00:02:39.190> as<00:02:39.610> long<00:02:39.730> as<00:02:39.880> it

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
good addition I think and as long as it

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:41.520 
good addition I think and as long as it
can<00:02:40.030> stand<00:02:40.240> up<00:02:40.480> to<00:02:40.510> what<00:02:40.630> I<00:02:40.810> do<00:02:40.930> to<00:02:41.200> my<00:02:41.320> keys

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
can stand up to what I do to my keys

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.280 
can stand up to what I do to my keys
then<00:02:42.190> we<00:02:42.310> should<00:02:42.370> be<00:02:42.580> hot<00:02:42.760> right<00:02:42.970> so<00:02:43.360> uh<00:02:43.390> that's

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
then we should be hot right so uh that's

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:46.470 
then we should be hot right so uh that's
a<00:02:44.410> pretty<00:02:44.530> cool<00:02:44.740> little<00:02:44.800> option<00:02:45.360> we've<00:02:46.360> got

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
a pretty cool little option we've got

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.240 
a pretty cool little option we've got
two<00:02:46.630> of<00:02:46.720> these<00:02:46.810> uh<00:02:46.870> maglite<00:02:47.530> solitaires<00:02:48.070> that

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
two of these uh maglite solitaires that

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.400 
two of these uh maglite solitaires that
were<00:02:48.310> pretty<00:02:48.490> cheap<00:02:48.730> I<00:02:48.850> think<00:02:49.200> four<00:02:50.200> and<00:02:50.350> a

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
were pretty cheap I think four and a

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:52.050 
were pretty cheap I think four and a
half<00:02:50.440> bucks<00:02:50.800> or<00:02:51.070> something<00:02:51.220> like<00:02:51.489> that<00:02:51.550> so

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
half bucks or something like that so

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.430 
half bucks or something like that so
that<00:02:52.780> was<00:02:52.959> home<00:02:53.470> depot<00:02:53.920> so<00:02:54.430> not<00:02:54.910> too<00:02:55.090> bad

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
that was home depot so not too bad

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.800 
that was home depot so not too bad
price-wise<00:02:56.440> a<00:02:56.920> couple<00:02:57.700> of<00:02:57.760> color<00:02:57.940> options<00:02:58.450> I

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
price-wise a couple of color options I

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.720 
price-wise a couple of color options I
figured<00:02:59.770> I'd<00:02:59.860> just<00:02:59.950> use<00:03:00.100> one<00:03:00.310> of<00:03:00.340> these<00:03:00.459> things

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
figured I'd just use one of these things

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.270 
figured I'd just use one of these things
you<00:03:00.940> know<00:03:01.030> throw<00:03:01.420> in<00:03:01.570> a<00:03:01.630> pocket<00:03:01.840> throw<00:03:02.680> in<00:03:02.860> my

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
you know throw in a pocket throw in my

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:04.740 
you know throw in a pocket throw in my
wife's<00:03:03.489> purse<00:03:03.820> whatever<00:03:04.300> in<00:03:04.480> the<00:03:04.540> glove<00:03:04.720> box

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
wife's purse whatever in the glove box

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.000 
wife's purse whatever in the glove box
is<00:03:05.170> there<00:03:05.290> something<00:03:05.530> like<00:03:05.620> that<00:03:05.770> just<00:03:05.800> to

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
is there something like that just to

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.190 
is there something like that just to
have<00:03:06.220> another<00:03:06.510> small<00:03:07.510> little<00:03:07.660> light<00:03:07.900> source

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
have another small little light source

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.810 
have another small little light source
there<00:03:08.470> just<00:03:08.739> in<00:03:08.830> case<00:03:08.980> I'll<00:03:09.130> forget<00:03:09.370> my<00:03:09.520> EDC

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:09.820 
there just in case I'll forget my EDC

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:12.390 
there just in case I'll forget my EDC
light<00:03:10.150> or<00:03:10.390> something<00:03:10.540> like<00:03:10.810> that<00:03:10.870> and<00:03:11.400> this

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
light or something like that and this

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.010 
light or something like that and this
one<00:03:12.550> here<00:03:12.670> would<00:03:12.820> just<00:03:12.970> be<00:03:13.120> a<00:03:13.330> backup<00:03:13.690> light

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:14.020 
one here would just be a backup light

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:16.020 
one here would just be a backup light
really<00:03:14.230> and<00:03:14.530> I<00:03:14.620> think<00:03:14.800> this<00:03:14.950> was<00:03:15.310> about<00:03:15.790> eight

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
really and I think this was about eight

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.259 
really and I think this was about eight
dollars<00:03:16.450> at<00:03:16.660> bass<00:03:16.840> pro<00:03:17.110> so<00:03:18.040> uh<00:03:18.070> maybe<00:03:18.850> seven

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:19.269 
dollars at bass pro so uh maybe seven

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:20.250 
dollars at bass pro so uh maybe seven
something<00:03:19.720> like<00:03:19.810> that<00:03:19.959> don't<00:03:20.110> really

in four and a half a piece on these I'm
keeping<00:03:28.660> with<00:03:28.780> the<00:03:28.870> lights<00:03:29.080> for<00:03:29.320> right<00:03:29.530> now

here's the streamlight stylus pro and
this<00:03:34.299> is<00:03:34.420> pretty<00:03:34.630> cool<00:03:34.690> it<00:03:35.170> uses<00:03:35.410> to<00:03:35.980> triple-a

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:36.459 
this is pretty cool it uses to triple-a

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:38.460 
this is pretty cool it uses to triple-a
batteries<00:03:36.940> and<00:03:37.150> there's<00:03:38.110> a<00:03:38.200> couple<00:03:38.320> other

details of it but you can see here with

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.009 
details of it but you can see here with
the<00:03:44.350> testing<00:03:44.830> I<00:03:44.980> mean<00:03:45.250> I<00:03:45.370> think<00:03:45.400> it's<00:03:46.019> once

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:47.019 
the testing I mean I think it's once

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:49.350 
the testing I mean I think it's once
it's<00:03:47.230> only<00:03:47.440> 24<00:03:47.920> lumens<00:03:48.370> but<00:03:48.610> I<00:03:48.820> mean<00:03:49.150> enough

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:49.360 
it's only 24 lumens but I mean enough

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:50.970 
it's only 24 lumens but I mean enough
for<00:03:49.540> app<00:03:49.600> in<00:03:49.780> app<00:03:50.140> in<00:03:50.350> light<00:03:50.530> that's<00:03:50.739> pretty

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
for app in app in light that's pretty

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.130 
for app in app in light that's pretty
sweet<00:03:51.160> that's<00:03:51.910> pretty<00:03:52.030> good<00:03:52.269> and<00:03:52.540> in

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:53.140 
sweet that's pretty good and in

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:55.259 
sweet that's pretty good and in
comparison<00:03:53.830> I've<00:03:54.580> got<00:03:54.790> a<00:03:54.820> couple<00:03:55.060> other

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:55.269 
comparison I've got a couple other

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:57.539

cheaper<00:03:55.900> pin<00:03:56.110> lights<00:03:56.380> and<00:03:57.100> stuff<00:03:57.310> like<00:03:57.489> that

00:03:57.539 --> 00:03:57.549 
cheaper pin lights and stuff like that

00:03:57.549 --> 00:03:59.640 
cheaper pin lights and stuff like that
I've<00:03:57.790> grabbed<00:03:58.030> over<00:03:58.330> the<00:03:58.450> years<00:03:58.750> and<00:03:59.080> this<00:03:59.590> is

00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.650 
I've grabbed over the years and this is

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:01.620 
I've grabbed over the years and this is
what<00:03:59.890> i<00:03:59.920> normally<00:04:00.010> carried<00:04:00.640> with<00:04:00.790> me<00:04:00.820> now<00:04:01.150> and

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:01.630 
what i normally carried with me now and

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:05.150 
what i normally carried with me now and
this<00:04:01.900> is<00:04:02.049> just<00:04:02.200> a<00:04:02.380> rayovac<00:04:03.100> little<00:04:03.549> pin<00:04:03.730> light

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.160 
this is just a rayovac little pin light

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.789 
this is just a rayovac little pin light
not<00:04:06.160> very<00:04:06.340> strong<00:04:06.580> but<00:04:07.120> uh<00:04:07.230> after<00:04:08.230> i<00:04:08.260> unwrap

00:04:08.789 --> 00:04:08.799 
not very strong but uh after i unwrap

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:10.380 
not very strong but uh after i unwrap
these<00:04:08.980> things<00:04:09.250> I'll<00:04:09.549> show<00:04:09.760> you<00:04:09.820> size-wise

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:10.390 
these things I'll show you size-wise

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:13.199 
these things I'll show you size-wise
fairly<00:04:11.019> comparable<00:04:11.350> and<00:04:11.970> this<00:04:12.970> thing's

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:13.209 
fairly comparable and this thing's

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:15.330 
fairly comparable and this thing's
obviously<00:04:14.110> a<00:04:14.140> lot<00:04:14.290> tougher<00:04:14.560> a<00:04:14.829> lot<00:04:15.010> stronger

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.340 
obviously a lot tougher a lot stronger

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:17.340 
obviously a lot tougher a lot stronger
know<00:04:15.970> people<00:04:16.239> talk<00:04:16.359> about<00:04:16.419> using<00:04:16.810> this<00:04:16.900> pommel

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:17.350 
know people talk about using this pommel

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:18.960 
know people talk about using this pommel
devices<00:04:17.799> or<00:04:17.919> something<00:04:18.220> like<00:04:18.340> that<00:04:18.400> if<00:04:18.669> it<00:04:18.790> had

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:18.970 
devices or something like that if it had

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:21.750 
devices or something like that if it had
to<00:04:19.239> if<00:04:19.840> that<00:04:19.900> was<00:04:20.229> my<00:04:20.380> last<00:04:20.590> resort<00:04:21.160> no<00:04:21.580> I<00:04:21.609> mean

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:21.760 
to if that was my last resort no I mean

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:22.830 
to if that was my last resort no I mean
I<00:04:21.910> guess<00:04:22.060> this<00:04:22.180> would<00:04:22.330> be<00:04:22.390> a<00:04:22.419> little<00:04:22.570> stronger

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840 
I guess this would be a little stronger

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.860 
I guess this would be a little stronger
for<00:04:23.110> that<00:04:23.260> so<00:04:23.590> that'd<00:04:24.460> be<00:04:24.550> pretty<00:04:24.669> good<00:04:24.910> but

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:25.870 
for that so that'd be pretty good but

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:27.180 
for that so that'd be pretty good but
that's<00:04:26.500> just<00:04:26.680> a<00:04:26.740> weapon<00:04:27.070> of<00:04:27.160> opportunity

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
that's just a weapon of opportunity

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:29.219 
that's just a weapon of opportunity
anyway<00:04:27.940> so<00:04:28.000> you<00:04:28.180> can<00:04:28.270> grab<00:04:28.449> all<00:04:28.840> kinds<00:04:29.139> of

00:04:29.219 --> 00:04:29.229 
anyway so you can grab all kinds of

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:32.460 
anyway so you can grab all kinds of
things<00:04:29.380> for<00:04:29.530> that<00:04:29.650> stuff<00:04:29.919> but<00:04:30.790> uh<00:04:31.229> yeah<00:04:32.229> this

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
things for that stuff but uh yeah this

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:35.040 
things for that stuff but uh yeah this
is<00:04:32.560> what<00:04:32.740> it<00:04:32.830> is<00:04:32.860> just<00:04:33.280> a<00:04:33.340> little<00:04:33.460> like<00:04:34.050> that'll

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
is what it is just a little like that'll

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:36.450 
is what it is just a little like that'll
be<00:04:35.139> replacing<00:04:35.620> it's<00:04:35.830> got<00:04:35.949> a<00:04:35.979> metal<00:04:36.190> clip

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:36.460 
be replacing it's got a metal clip

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.180 
be replacing it's got a metal clip
versus<00:04:36.850> the<00:04:36.940> little<00:04:37.120> plastic<00:04:37.270> clip<00:04:37.780> and<00:04:38.190> seals

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:39.190 
versus the little plastic clip and seals

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:41.340 
versus the little plastic clip and seals
for<00:04:39.639> waterproof<00:04:40.180> this<00:04:40.630> was<00:04:40.780> just<00:04:40.960> so<00:04:41.110> light

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:41.350 
for waterproof this was just so light

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:43.790 
for waterproof this was just so light
and<00:04:41.560> so<00:04:41.650> cheap<00:04:41.979> uses<00:04:42.850> one<00:04:43.000> triple<00:04:43.330> a<00:04:43.419> and

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:43.800 
and so cheap uses one triple a and

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.930 
and so cheap uses one triple a and
that's<00:04:44.800> why<00:04:44.919> i<00:04:45.040> got<00:04:45.310> it<00:04:45.430> i<00:04:45.520> think<00:04:45.610> it<00:04:45.729> was<00:04:45.790> like

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:45.940 
that's why i got it i think it was like

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:47.310 
that's why i got it i think it was like
two<00:04:46.060> and<00:04:46.180> a<00:04:46.210> half<00:04:46.300> dollars<00:04:46.630> at<00:04:46.750> walmart<00:04:47.199> or

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:47.320 
two and a half dollars at walmart or

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:48.450 
two and a half dollars at walmart or
something<00:04:47.590> like<00:04:47.650> that<00:04:47.710> three<00:04:48.100> dollars<00:04:48.370> at

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:48.460 
something like that three dollars at

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:50.460 
something like that three dollars at
walmart<00:04:48.790> this<00:04:49.449> is<00:04:49.540> a<00:04:49.600> pretty<00:04:49.750> good<00:04:49.930> option<00:04:50.320> and

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:50.470 
walmart this is a pretty good option and

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:53.189 
walmart this is a pretty good option and
i<00:04:51.160> don't<00:04:51.970> know<00:04:52.030> this<00:04:52.270> would<00:04:52.540> place<00:04:52.780> it<00:04:52.810> this

00:04:53.189 --> 00:04:53.199 
i don't know this would place it this

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:59.040 
i don't know this would place it this
was<00:04:53.410> a<00:04:53.440> I<00:04:53.919> believe<00:04:54.729> 24<00:04:55.389> at<00:04:55.840> bass<00:04:56.260> pro<00:04:56.530> so<00:04:58.050> that's

00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.050 
was a I believe 24 at bass pro so that's

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:01.050 
was a I believe 24 at bass pro so that's
pretty<00:04:59.260> good<00:04:59.410> we'll<00:05:00.280> check<00:05:00.430> it<00:05:00.580> out<00:05:00.699> see<00:05:01.030> how

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:01.060 
pretty good we'll check it out see how

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:02.850 
pretty good we'll check it out see how
it<00:05:01.240> works<00:05:01.510> and<00:05:01.750> I've<00:05:02.320> opened<00:05:02.500> this<00:05:02.620> will<00:05:02.770> be

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:02.860 
it works and I've opened this will be

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:04.469 
it works and I've opened this will be
definitely<00:05:03.340> a<00:05:03.639> better<00:05:03.820> upgrade<00:05:04.000> than<00:05:04.389> this

00:05:04.469 --> 00:05:04.479 
definitely a better upgrade than this

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:06.330 
definitely a better upgrade than this
here<00:05:04.750> it<00:05:04.840> should<00:05:05.050> be<00:05:05.229> by<00:05:05.410> any<00:05:05.530> you<00:05:06.250> know<00:05:06.280> any

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:06.340 
here it should be by any you know any

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:08.010 
here it should be by any you know any
standards<00:05:06.970> really<00:05:07.270> so<00:05:07.539> you're<00:05:07.720> getting<00:05:07.780> so

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:08.020 
standards really so you're getting so

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:10.200 
standards really so you're getting so
much<00:05:08.139> more<00:05:08.199> for<00:05:08.620> what<00:05:08.770> you<00:05:08.860> got<00:05:09.090> for<00:05:10.090> your

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:10.210 
much more for what you got for your

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:12.719 
much more for what you got for your
money<00:05:10.389> and<00:05:10.600> everything<00:05:11.340> so<00:05:12.340> hopefully<00:05:12.639> this

00:05:12.719 --> 00:05:12.729 
money and everything so hopefully this

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:13.980 
money and everything so hopefully this
will<00:05:12.850> be<00:05:12.940> a<00:05:13.000> pretty<00:05:13.150> good<00:05:13.360> addition<00:05:13.810> I<00:05:13.870> guess

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:13.990 
will be a pretty good addition I guess

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:15.260 
will be a pretty good addition I guess
it<00:05:14.110> comes<00:05:14.199> with<00:05:14.320> a<00:05:14.440> sheath<00:05:14.650> of<00:05:14.800> some<00:05:14.949> sort

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:15.270 
it comes with a sheath of some sort

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:18.260 
it comes with a sheath of some sort
probably<00:05:16.270> won't<00:05:16.419> use<00:05:16.660> it<00:05:16.690> but<00:05:17.169> we'll<00:05:17.680> see<00:05:17.889> and

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:18.270 
probably won't use it but we'll see and

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:21.719 
probably won't use it but we'll see and
this<00:05:19.270> here<00:05:19.440> sable<00:05:20.440> self<00:05:20.710> to<00:05:20.830> sprint's<00:05:21.160> defense

00:05:21.719 --> 00:05:21.729 
this here sable self to sprint's defense

00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:25.830 
this here sable self to sprint's defense
spray<00:05:21.970> I<00:05:22.300> guess<00:05:22.900> it's<00:05:23.080> a<00:05:23.260> red<00:05:23.889> pepper<00:05:24.360> CS<00:05:25.360> tear

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:25.840 
spray I guess it's a red pepper CS tear

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:28.200 
spray I guess it's a red pepper CS tear
gas<00:05:26.139> or<00:05:26.470> something<00:05:26.620> like<00:05:26.860> that<00:05:26.919> and<00:05:27.280> UV<00:05:27.729> dye<00:05:27.940> in

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:28.210 
gas or something like that and UV dye in

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:30.960 
gas or something like that and UV dye in
it<00:05:28.330> some<00:05:28.710> three-in-one<00:05:29.710> formula<00:05:30.250> I<00:05:30.280> guess<00:05:30.340> so

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:30.970 
it some three-in-one formula I guess so

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:35.940 
it some three-in-one formula I guess so
I<00:05:31.419> say<00:05:32.289> the<00:05:32.410> NYPD<00:05:33.070> carries<00:05:33.490> it<00:05:33.639> so<00:05:33.940> yeah<00:05:34.330> I<00:05:35.050> just

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:35.950 
I say the NYPD carries it so yeah I just

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:37.320 
I say the NYPD carries it so yeah I just
really<00:05:36.160> wanted<00:05:36.340> a<00:05:36.430> non-legal<00:05:36.849> often<00:05:37.240> I've

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:37.330 
really wanted a non-legal often I've

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:38.940 
really wanted a non-legal often I've
seen<00:05:37.479> a<00:05:37.510> couple<00:05:37.570> of<00:05:37.840> guys<00:05:37.960> out<00:05:38.169> there<00:05:38.229> and<00:05:38.800> i

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:38.950 
seen a couple of guys out there and i

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:40.770 
seen a couple of guys out there and i
really<00:05:39.190> wanted<00:05:39.430> something<00:05:39.789> honestly<00:05:40.150> just<00:05:40.539> to

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:40.780 
really wanted something honestly just to

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:42.779 
really wanted something honestly just to
grab<00:05:41.590> if<00:05:41.919> i<00:05:42.010> knew<00:05:42.160> i<00:05:42.190> couldn't<00:05:42.460> carry<00:05:42.669> my

00:05:42.779 --> 00:05:42.789 
grab if i knew i couldn't carry my

00:05:42.789 --> 00:05:44.310 
grab if i knew i couldn't carry my
pistol<00:05:43.180> or<00:05:43.330> something<00:05:43.570> like<00:05:43.690> that<00:05:43.750> if<00:05:44.110> i<00:05:44.200> was

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:44.320 
pistol or something like that if i was

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:45.750 
pistol or something like that if i was
heading<00:05:44.919> somewhere<00:05:45.099> where<00:05:45.340> i<00:05:45.370> didn't<00:05:45.610> want

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:45.760 
heading somewhere where i didn't want

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:49.110 
heading somewhere where i didn't want
the<00:05:45.880> bulk<00:05:46.090> of<00:05:46.210> the<00:05:46.300> pistol<00:05:46.630> and<00:05:48.000> needed<00:05:49.000> an

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:49.120 
the bulk of the pistol and needed an

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:51.390 
the bulk of the pistol and needed an
option<00:05:49.510> you<00:05:49.840> know<00:05:49.990> to<00:05:50.050> carry<00:05:50.410> I<00:05:50.860> think<00:05:51.340> this

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:51.400 
option you know to carry I think this

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:53.129 
option you know to carry I think this
will<00:05:51.550> be<00:05:51.610> a<00:05:51.910> pretty<00:05:52.300> good<00:05:52.479> substitute<00:05:52.990> for

00:05:53.129 --> 00:05:53.139 
will be a pretty good substitute for

00:05:53.139 --> 00:05:54.719 
will be a pretty good substitute for
what<00:05:53.440> you<00:05:53.680> know<00:05:53.800> for<00:05:54.160> what<00:05:54.190> I<00:05:54.310> would<00:05:54.460> need<00:05:54.610> it

00:05:54.719 --> 00:05:54.729 
what you know for what I would need it

00:05:54.729 --> 00:05:56.070 
what you know for what I would need it
for<00:05:54.940> I<00:05:54.970> wouldn't<00:05:55.210> carry<00:05:55.449> it<00:05:55.539> all<00:05:55.630> the<00:05:55.660> time<00:05:55.780> and

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:56.080 
for I wouldn't carry it all the time and

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:57.360 
for I wouldn't carry it all the time and
place<00:05:56.169> in<00:05:56.380> my<00:05:56.440> hand<00:05:56.650> guns<00:05:56.860> or<00:05:57.070> anything<00:05:57.099> like

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:57.370 
place in my hand guns or anything like

00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:59.730 
place in my hand guns or anything like
that<00:05:57.520> but<00:05:57.940> this<00:05:58.570> is<00:05:58.690> a<00:05:58.750> pretty<00:05:58.930> good<00:05:59.139> option

00:05:59.730 --> 00:05:59.740 
that but this is a pretty good option

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:00.510 
that but this is a pretty good option
it's<00:05:59.860> got<00:06:00.039> you<00:06:00.190> know<00:06:00.250> kind<00:06:00.490> of

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:00.520 
it's got you know kind of

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:04.050 
it's got you know kind of
self-explanatory<00:06:02.400> steps<00:06:03.400> or<00:06:03.580> whatever<00:06:03.880> on

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:04.060 
self-explanatory steps or whatever on

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:06.659 
self-explanatory steps or whatever on
the<00:06:04.180> back<00:06:04.360> and<00:06:04.770> it's<00:06:05.770> got<00:06:05.889> a<00:06:05.919> safety<00:06:06.160> on<00:06:06.430> it<00:06:06.460> I

00:06:06.659 --> 00:06:06.669 
the back and it's got a safety on it I

00:06:06.669 --> 00:06:08.969 
the back and it's got a safety on it I
did<00:06:06.820> like<00:06:06.970> that<00:06:07.180> and<00:06:07.449> I<00:06:07.630> guess<00:06:07.810> this<00:06:07.960> case<00:06:08.740> you

00:06:08.969 --> 00:06:08.979 
did like that and I guess this case you

00:06:08.979 --> 00:06:10.830 
did like that and I guess this case you
can<00:06:09.130> refill<00:06:09.820> it<00:06:09.880> I'm<00:06:10.150> not<00:06:10.270> really<00:06:10.449> a<00:06:10.539> hundred

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:10.840 
can refill it I'm not really a hundred

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:12.060 
can refill it I'm not really a hundred
percent<00:06:10.930> how<00:06:11.260> that<00:06:11.410> works<00:06:11.620> comes<00:06:11.889> with<00:06:12.010> this

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:12.070 
percent how that works comes with this

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:15.000 
percent how that works comes with this
little<00:06:12.160> keychain<00:06:13.090> thing<00:06:13.570> that's<00:06:13.840> actually<00:06:14.229> to

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:15.010 
little keychain thing that's actually to

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:16.330 
me a little bit more exciting than this

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:18.120 
me a little bit more exciting than this
