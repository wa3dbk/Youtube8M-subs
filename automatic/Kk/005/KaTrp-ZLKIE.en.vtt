00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 Hello everyone, welcome this 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:07.170
 montani mike rann world today is worth one 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.849
 of a fashion day 1.8 boys 1.8 from 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.380
 Modena speaks today knows of 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.719
 you can all see it already from mine 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.670
 little hand and leaning them is the lucky block 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.830
 mode has finally been updated for 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.840
 1.8 many of you definitely already there 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.510
 they know and someone is left who doesn't 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.619
 he knows it is a very interesting fashion 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:28.920
 if I do crafting first 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:32.070
 gold and drop per win of hot of gold e 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.200
 a drop here it is plug in block e 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.940
 lucky zero because the zeroes then 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.219
 as we know and bloc lakes have the 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.320
 characteristic of making things happen 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.300
 events that can be both positive 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.750
 that negatives to make you understand can 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.670
 it happens quietly that you fall 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.809
 of the diamond on the head and therefore you have 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.940
 devil for free 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.920
 gives you some with the armor makes you 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.629
 dropping of the rainbow ships then of the 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.800
 all different colored sheep that they are 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.129
 positive ones 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.410
 or another small example of things 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.579
 negative we have that a whole is formed 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.920
 cage around you with lava 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.689
 on the head a skilled man falls on 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.060
 right does you harm and I have to kill 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:12.180
 or a hole forms below you 3x3 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.740
 that goes into the infinite below an area 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.140
 made of lava with anger of the 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.140
 soap don't let me take it out of there then 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.340
 you will die really bad may happen to 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.530
 anything and everything can be 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.000
 lucky or unlucky and go 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.220
 very well combined with fashions 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.799
 because I can also do random elements 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.509
 so really beautiful fashions 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.310
 then also another feature e 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.079
 lakes blog can be lucky bit 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.119
 unfortunate how do you make it 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.790
 lucky or unlucky just take it 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:41.640
 the elements in this case that are for 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:45.149
 example boldi amodei meran go up 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:47.070
 blok lakes you put them for diamond 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.570
 make you understand will increase your luck 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.549
 puts of the emerald obviously was 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.770
 I still don't know how much luck 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:55.290
 can be upgraded let's see if 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.329
 we can enhance it with so much shear 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.500
 of the pack the ok we arrived until 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.450
 68 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.189
 I think if we put it exclusively 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.450
 diamonds should really become 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.280
 lucky 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.890
 let's see all the diamonds now 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.360
 wind all the diamonds and we try it 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.330
 I want to see how much it really is 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.160
 lucky this blog 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:16.170
 we go potential up to 96 perfect 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:20.880
 then I have now taken and lakes block 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:24.360
 boosted to 96 notches then I get up 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:27.800
 from game mode then gam and mode and zero 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:32.600
 because you remember here there is no moles 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.600
 northug and let's see how lucky we are 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:39.450
 wow has spurred countless cats 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:41.490
 all ours are all 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.860
 really fond of us 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:46.170
 oh my god we have all our cats 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.510
 that's cool 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:51.270
 and this is nice then we see a 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:53.220
 a little lucky instead blocks that 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:55.470
 practically on the contrary more 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:58.530
 we put this stuff that are the poufs 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:00.600
 airfish spider aie ferment spyder is 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.200
 the lower our fortune falls 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.950
 live blog 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:08.090
 in this case we will go with the 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:11.580
 game mode 1 the same the other the i block 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:13.530
 then a lucky block that is the least one 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:16.140
 84 we have already prepared it so ve 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:18.330
 I show him then the lakes block 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.340
 there was almost no luck rightly 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:21.720
 zero should therefore come out by force 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.390
 something negative so I do 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:29.430
 I put back how it is so I die badly 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:31.380

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.390
