00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 very good we're all good here 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:07.440
 mysterium or with a new video is up 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:10.139
 with informative video as you see new 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.630
 game announced in May and this because 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.750
 well in Japan's famitsu magazine 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.160
 have posted on the pages that are 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.140
 very attentive your readers that in the 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.730
 next month of May we assume that 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.949
 be the next publication of this 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.050
 magazine the new game has been announced 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.269
 of pokémon and with this we refer in 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.640
 a pokémon type game rumble and shuffle 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.529
 which are mini- games like I call 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.960
 free to play that are free if not the 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.880
 official game such edit games 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.760
 and well with all this well you want 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.469
 do this video as you can see, I've already 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.020
 put the background of Carlos because 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.820
 I think the next game will be good 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.700
 then the second part of pokemon xe and 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.250
 which will be in the region of calos and good 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.800
 Well with many new areas as I have already 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.059
 said in previous videos with many 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.649
 new areas to discover new 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.660
 legendary good 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.489
 the first theory that gives you have in 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.430
 other videos is that it may come out 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.769
 pokemon z pokemon z was told he was not going 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.680
 to leave for one of the workers of 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.570
 pokemon game freak 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.830
 like this title but it can be good 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.690
 let it out since and well then we have 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.850
 to arrive from having nothing of 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:17.340
 protagonism did not come out none did not have 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.860
 nothing in the judge in x and is only in the 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.320
 cave is what it captures and it's already good at 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.540
 the second theory that you have in my 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.310
 last video of theories is this you 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.490
 I will leave the link in the description or by 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.770
 here for the video is pokemon zx and for 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.210
 what one is there this theory is created 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.490
 more than anything by fans who published 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.620
 someone was bored took a picture with 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.140
 these two mergers and I did the 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:42.090
 what breaks these but this theory does not 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.550
 It has a lot of foundation and I do not think it 's 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.500
 real if it were real I do not know already with these 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:49.410
 pokemon as I said in my video 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:52.200
 where he talked about this but well let's go 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:55.080
 to start with the theory that I believe that 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.420
 it can be good or it can be no but 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.860
 that has some possibility and to 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.070
 we have to put in a situation 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:05.369
 so we're not going to start with this is 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:08.310
 a little weird and pokémon gold and silver well 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:10.080
 because I put this in 1999 in japan 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.770
 here in Spain good Spain in europe 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.650
 he left in 2001 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:16.420
 pokémon came out gold and silver with their 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.730
 respective legendary that are these 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.560
 we have a jewel we have the lodge that 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.000
 are the legendary representatives of 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.550
 these editions and then we have three 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.130
 legendary dogs these are in tain 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:28.810
 rayco and sui coon are good then 3 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:31.510
 legendary pokémon that are together 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:34.120
 with the other two in the game and well 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:37.000
 because I say all this let's focus 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:39.010
 in sui with which one year later everything 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.900
 for its official game or the game in 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.820
 the one that he was the legendary pokemon a 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.010
 game totally based on suite that was 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:47.460
 the crystal pokemon and this game is 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:51.010
 based on enric a which is a pokémon 

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:52.660
 that is part of a trio and is not a 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.760
 I think it's special how it could be 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.860
 me that is tour gave cl wine that are 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.540
 unique and could have had its edition 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:00.670
 and they did not have it but had it this 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.770
 pokemon that was part of a trio and 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:05.710
 nobody expected it with all this that 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:09.940
 means in 2013 came pokemon xy 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:11.680
 as you well know and we have cherry asia 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:13.680
 and see as the protagonists of 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.240
 these two editions are the legendary 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.920
 representative of these editions the 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:19.750
 legionaries that 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:23.140
 before the league and all this all this 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:25.180
 roll but well they also came out three 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:29.170
 new legendary together with these 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:32.410
 that are from annecy okupa and volcano jones 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:34.510
 diane if you can already get 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:36.310
 they made an event where we could 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:39.370
 get adrián if with your mega stone 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:41.319
 the dian chinita and all good not then 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:42.970
 we have here for which they have not 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:44.319
 made no event but they are 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:45.790
 doing is going to continue the new movie 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:48.010
 As you all know, you have all the 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.989
 trailers and analysis on me on my channel 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:52.150
 in case you have not seen but good 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:53.500
 juba we already have all the information but 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:55.060
 all do not but we have a lot of 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.580
 information is the protagonist of a new 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:59.950
 film and well then we do something of 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:01.750
 fault but the third pokemon that is 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:04.600
 volcano jon volcano is no longer known 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:07.060
 absolutely nothing of this good pokemon 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:09.459
 you know the attacks because there are good 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.290
 certain Castroists illegal ways of 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:13.150
 get all the pokémon yes good 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:14.890
 because we have managed to discover 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.989
 would overturn but if not we would not have 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:19.269
 we would have known nothing we have a volcano 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:21.639
 in which it has not been distributed by 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:22.690
 event they have not published anything no no 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:24.340
 they have no movie or have 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:26.080
 absolutely nothing 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:28.150
 with all this I want to get it right 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:31.270
 we have cherne ace we have there back and 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:33.790
 we have zoom in of which are zx6 and 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:36.010
 which are the axes of the plane 

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:37.600
 they are mathematical things but good and 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:39.430
 then we have a volcano that would be the 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:41.050
 I had a thing called a vector 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:43.060
 uve that is also math and everything 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:45.610
 I would have some relationship with which I 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:48.639
 I have decided to make this cover 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:50.680
 if pokemon v in which then volcano is 

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:52.830
 was the protagonist of this new 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:54.879
 edition just as a loft is rich it was 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:57.580
 after having taken pokémon gold and 

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:59.139
 silver and be one of the trio with which 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:02.289
 his icon and overturned have certain 

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:04.599
 Ball relationship that is part of a trio 

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:06.610
 or something different are not dogs are 

00:05:04.599 --> 00:05:09.159
 Pajarones are similar things but they are 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:11.560
 a trio of legendaries apart from the 

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:13.509
 main and well then I decide 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:15.219
 make this cover that I hope you 

00:05:13.509 --> 00:05:17.889
 like I would not like it to stop being 

00:05:15.219 --> 00:05:20.439
 the comments as I always say if you 

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:23.169
 liked the design of the covers 

00:05:20.439 --> 00:05:25.599
 I do quite encouraging me if you 

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:28.960
 they like and well all this then 

00:05:25.599 --> 00:05:30.460
 it could be that they pulled out pokemon vo 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:33.099
 otherwise it could be that they removed 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:35.169
 pokemon z juve the two together could be 

00:05:33.099 --> 00:05:37.479
 that take both at the same time did not say 

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:39.039
 he said no because he was not going to leave 

00:05:37.479 --> 00:05:41.110
 pokemon z but just would not go out 

00:05:39.039 --> 00:05:43.599
 because 11 is alone and it could be that 

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:44.800
 it would come out zv pokemon but hey 

00:05:43.599 --> 00:05:47.050
 leaving the comments what do you think 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:49.000
 about all this I would like quite a lot 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:51.310
 know your opinions so we compare 

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.630
 opinions and good can also be the 

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:54.430
 possibility of pokemon coming out 

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:57.160
 because in tournament as a big game 

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:59.950
 I do not play for Wii and that in the video 

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:01.480
 previous you have the trailer that you are 

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:02.530

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:13.240

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:16.000
