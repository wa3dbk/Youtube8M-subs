cars<00:01:58.770> and<00:01:59.770> the<00:02:00.250> catch<00:02:00.430> is<00:02:00.460> that<00:02:00.909> that<00:02:01.119> this

00:02:01.529 --> 00:02:01.539 
cars and the catch is that that this

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:04.770 
cars and the catch is that that this
route<00:02:01.930> only<00:02:02.140> has<00:02:02.380> the<00:02:02.530> one<00:02:02.649> block<00:02:02.950> X<00:02:03.780> which

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:04.780 
route only has the one block X which

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.170 
route only has the one block X which
then<00:02:05.469> goes<00:02:05.680> into<00:02:05.890> here<00:02:06.219> so<00:02:06.490> you'll<00:02:06.640> see<00:02:06.850> for

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:07.180 
then goes into here so you'll see for

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.749 
then goes into here so you'll see for
each<00:02:07.210> block<00:02:07.539> X<00:02:07.840> it<00:02:08.619> requires<00:02:09.039> you<00:02:09.340> to<00:02:09.369> put<00:02:09.640> in

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
each block X it requires you to put in

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:11.699 
each block X it requires you to put in
one<00:02:09.910> extra<00:02:10.269> train<00:02:10.600> for<00:02:10.899> wear<00:02:11.079> and<00:02:11.230> tear<00:02:11.470> that

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:11.709 
one extra train for wear and tear that

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:13.650 
one extra train for wear and tear that
has<00:02:11.950> cause<00:02:12.190> of<00:02:12.370> mountains<00:02:12.700> ropes<00:02:13.000> so<00:02:13.570> you

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
has cause of mountains ropes so you

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.170 
has cause of mountains ropes so you
would<00:02:13.750> then<00:02:13.780> put<00:02:14.170> a<00:02:14.200> fifth<00:02:14.650> train<00:02:14.980> into<00:02:15.940> here

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
would then put a fifth train into here

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:17.880 
would then put a fifth train into here
for<00:02:16.390> that<00:02:16.510> route<00:02:16.780> which<00:02:17.170> then<00:02:17.380> gives<00:02:17.560> you<00:02:17.709> two

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
for that route which then gives you two

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.520 
for that route which then gives you two
points<00:02:18.220> for<00:02:18.370> each<00:02:18.430> train<00:02:18.880> that<00:02:19.239> goes<00:02:19.420> into<00:02:19.810> the

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
points for each train that goes into the

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.220 
points for each train that goes into the
mouths<00:02:20.650> in<00:02:20.799> this<00:02:20.890> route<00:02:21.130> stockpile<00:02:22.000> here<00:02:22.269> so

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
mouths in this route stockpile here so

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.349 
mouths in this route stockpile here so
you<00:02:23.290> had<00:02:23.590> then<00:02:23.739> received<00:02:24.130> your<00:02:24.370> normal<00:02:24.730> seven

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:25.359 
you had then received your normal seven

00:02:25.359 --> 00:02:28.949 
you had then received your normal seven
points<00:02:25.720> for<00:02:25.900> building<00:02:26.620> that<00:02:26.769> track<00:02:27.690> plus<00:02:28.690> the

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
points for building that track plus the

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:30.990 
points for building that track plus the
no.2<00:02:29.440> for<00:02:29.470> the<00:02:30.070> extra<00:02:30.400> strain<00:02:30.609> that<00:02:30.790> you<00:02:30.880> have

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
no.2 for the extra strain that you have

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.759 
no.2 for the extra strain that you have
to<00:02:31.209> use<00:02:31.480> for<00:02:31.660> wear<00:02:31.810> and<00:02:31.930> tear<00:02:32.140> so<00:02:32.380> you'd

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:32.769 
to use for wear and tear so you'd

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:34.020 
to use for wear and tear so you'd
receive<00:02:33.010> nine<00:02:33.220> points<00:02:33.579> of<00:02:33.670> building<00:02:33.910> that

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
receive nine points of building that

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.310 
receive nine points of building that
track<00:02:34.410> whereas<00:02:35.410> if<00:02:35.560> you<00:02:35.680> were<00:02:35.799> to<00:02:36.010> look<00:02:36.190> at

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
track whereas if you were to look at

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:42.120 
track whereas if you were to look at
going<00:02:38.320> from<00:02:39.030> Mandalay<00:02:40.030> to<00:02:40.359> Hanoi<00:02:40.920> you'll<00:02:41.920> see

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
going from Mandalay to Hanoi you'll see

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.250 
going from Mandalay to Hanoi you'll see
that<00:02:42.190> there<00:02:42.430> there's<00:02:43.060> two<00:02:43.150> and<00:02:43.720> they're<00:02:44.049> both

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
that there there's two and they're both

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.000 
that there there's two and they're both
black<00:02:44.590> X's<00:02:45.010> so<00:02:45.310> you<00:02:46.000> would<00:02:46.120> play<00:02:46.630> your<00:02:46.900> two<00:02:47.140> red

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
black X's so you would play your two red

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:51.509 
black X's so you would play your two red
cards<00:02:48.430> like<00:02:48.579> usual<00:02:48.970> and<00:02:49.829> then<00:02:50.829> put<00:02:51.280> down<00:02:51.370> your

00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:51.519 
cards like usual and then put down your

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:54.360 
cards like usual and then put down your
two<00:02:51.670> trains<00:02:51.970> but<00:02:52.150> since<00:02:52.359> they<00:02:52.480> are<00:02:52.510> both<00:02:53.370> since

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
two trains but since they are both since

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.220 
two trains but since they are both since
there's<00:02:54.580> two<00:02:54.970> black<00:02:55.180> X's<00:02:55.599> you<00:02:55.750> would<00:02:55.870> then<00:02:55.959> put

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
there's two black X's you would then put

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.380 
there's two black X's you would then put
two<00:02:56.860> trains<00:02:57.700> into<00:02:58.030> that

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
two trains into that

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:02.610 
two trains into that
rock<00:02:58.510> pile<00:02:58.720> so<00:02:59.380> you'd<00:02:59.560> receive<00:03:01.020> the<00:03:02.020> usual<00:03:02.410> two

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
rock pile so you'd receive the usual two

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.620 
rock pile so you'd receive the usual two
points<00:03:03.010> for<00:03:03.130> building<00:03:03.400> that<00:03:03.520> road<00:03:03.700> plus<00:03:04.480> an

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:04.630 
points for building that road plus an

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:06.390 
points for building that road plus an
extra<00:03:04.840> two<00:03:05.110> for<00:03:05.350> each<00:03:05.440> train<00:03:05.830> so<00:03:06.130> that<00:03:06.160> would

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
extra two for each train so that would

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.309 
extra two for each train so that would
then<00:03:06.550> give<00:03:07.090> you<00:03:07.180> six<00:03:07.450> points<00:03:07.780> or<00:03:07.900> billion<00:03:08.170> that

00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:08.319 
then give you six points or billion that

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:10.410 
then give you six points or billion that
wrote<00:03:08.560> there<00:03:08.890> but<00:03:09.490> you<00:03:09.610> would<00:03:09.790> lose<00:03:10.090> two

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
wrote there but you would lose two

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.180 
wrote there but you would lose two
trains<00:03:10.780> to<00:03:11.110> the<00:03:11.170> stockpile<00:03:11.620> assuming<00:03:12.069> that
