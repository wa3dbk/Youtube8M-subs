00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.000
I feel melting like a slice of butter, looking for a way out

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:37.800
so I can get away for a moment, this isn't normal, I don't always feel this

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.300
sometimes I try to fly like the wind but without success I fall and crash to the concrete

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:49.110
and from a big strike I come back to the reality, I wanna get away from it so I can fantasize

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.859
I wanna sleep but don't wake me up, I wanna disappear no matter what

00:00:54.859 --> 00:01:00.649
no matter what it takes, no matter where I be, and after that I want to watch that sunset again

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:05.460
so yearned and so orange, I wanna be here, I wanne be there, I wanna be anywhere

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.560
my heart beats and beats, miles per hour

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:14.200
these are the words that honor it, my mind explores like Dora the explorer

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.200
I don't have water, I only got rhymes
in the canteen

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:34.509
this is my getaway, I know you notice it, don't say a word the one who's coward cause I can't stand them

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.630
can't stand them, can't stand them, can't stand them. you feel what I say or I have to repeat it?

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.200
I will get away in a possible seesaw or what a about a train, free of stress

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:51.200
free of shyness and at the same time free of stupidity, I will get away with all that belongs to me

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:57.020
every time I get free, I never try to come back, the life, the soul, the love, this is my pact

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:02.390
that will remain loyal until my death,
instead a long jump, I prefer to fly high

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:08.069
I wanna go(yeah) I wanna run, I wanna get away from here and then I wanna get there

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:13.840
where no one can judge you and lie to you, how can I keep on in this sick world?

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:19.349
what If I go off quietly while I sleep?
fly with the angels and become eternal

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:25.000
then I will chat, it will be all good and perfect, but I won't ever forget my notebook

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.300
Perhaps I wasn't made to be or to born here, this society never convinced me

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:47.560
one love for my baby, my hommies and my family, this world is black like a fuckin fatality

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:52.590
playing mario bros I went back to my childhood, then I saw myself hooked up in this beat

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.939
and I learned that years don't make you grow up, but the experience does

00:02:55.939 --> 00:02:58.870
I took my shot, I didn't screw it up, I kept going

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:05.800
until I got here, I packed a lot of words and raise my fuckin level

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.800
In different shape or way

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.800
but most of all, at least... at one time

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.800
have wanted to get away...
