00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.389
 the datasheet of the sony alpha 7 mr 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.790
 marx 2 reads like a wish list 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.740
 by photographer hermann high resolution 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:11.070
 full format sensor with image stabilization 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:14.630
 4k videos a rapid autofocus us 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.630
 show what the camera really has on it 

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:20.250
 the helper 7er markt 2 makes you one 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.779
 all-round impression we have one 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.880
 sealed against dust and moisture 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.199
 The magnesium casing has one 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.330
 big grip so the camera really 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.590
 well in hand we have each one 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.119
 Lot of wheels for manual 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.149
 Exposure control view for the 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.469
 manual control we have a display 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.270
 that is up and a bit too 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.800
 fold down and we have 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:43.290
 a big and bright electronic 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:44.940
 Sucher one looks at the alpha 7er 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.649
 market 2 from the top then you see that 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.219
 the housing is quite thick fails 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.079
 his reason 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.210
 and installed sony here as in 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.070
 the alpha 7 2 1 5 axis 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.989
 image stabilizer directly on the sensor 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.460
 of course needs a bit of space 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.440
 advantage of the stabilization in the 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.090
 Cameraman can also use objective 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.489
 which have no stabilizer and receives 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.660
 still a stabilized picture now 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.100
 one wonders what happens when 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.360
 for example, the objective 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.040
 stabilized then you have yes here 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.900
 a combination of both the 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.580
 works as long as it is a sony 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.930
 original lenses then it will 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.450
 that means three axes 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.700
 takes over the sensor and two axes 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.590
 the stabilizer takes over in the lens 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.299
 one must now foreign objects such as 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.310
 example canon nikon via an adapter 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.080
 then it is recommended stabilization 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.119
 turn off because the camera otherwise 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.770
 not not sensible what 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.270
 Now if you are objective where the 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.950
 focal length is not recognized at all 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.329
 then you can do the menu manually 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.799
 adjust so that the bildstelle the 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.540
 about white with what kind of one 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.890
 Objectively, this has to do and what 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.020
 he really has to make up for it here 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.960
 We now come to the full frame sensor that 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.119
 sony alpha 7 m2 in contrast to the alpha 7 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.700
 he had the 36 megapixels here 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:50.009
 42 megapixel and not only that it is 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.380
 also the first full-format sensor with 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.360
 sonys exmor r technology we know 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.759
 since 2009 out of the compact camera 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.950
 cybershot wegs 1 one speaks of 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:01.740
 a back-illuminated sensor what 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.670
 Does that mean that sony layers 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.350
 on the sensor a bit 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.900
 has restructured so that now the 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.790
 Sensor capture more light 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:10.190
 what does that have to follow, we have to 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:11.930
 a significantly increased iso 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:15.350
 sensitivity of now maximum iso 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:19.190
 100 2400 in comparison the seven he 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:21.260
 could only a maximum of 25,600 and the second 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.220
 advantage sony says that the noise 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.080
 should be lower 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.150
 if that's really true shows us that 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.100
 lab the zeal you see 2 comes up 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.390
 an extremely high edge sharpness who through 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:31.430
 the higher resolution is also one 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.270
 stronger image noise is suspected of being 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.550
 be surprised 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:35.840
 in comparison to the 7er that in the 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:37.130
 actually practice images 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.630
 recognize no difference 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:40.850
 So you get a little higher 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:42.950
 dissolving image without loss in the 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:44.959
 image quality on the contrary even looks 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.959
 you look at the shots of the 7er Markt 2 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:48.440
 at iso 51.200 so in high iso 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:50.270
 Area 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.010
 then they even see something sharper and 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:55.190
 better than at the older 7th at 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.810
 So we have a maximum of 25,600 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.890
 every case a win in the 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.110
 higher iso area 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:02.420
 Overall, both cameras are what the 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:03.380
 image quality is about in 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:05.540
 comparable level 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:07.400
 the sony alpha 7 times 2 still brings 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.410
 use another great feature though is 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.630
 it is the first full frame of the alpha slm 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:13.340
 not only in 4k film but this one 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:15.530
 material also internally on the 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.780
 memory card can drop eleven wm it 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:19.459
 was 2004 k film but you had to 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.600
 because the whole material on an external 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:22.790
 Save recorder 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:24.800
 which now falls off stores directly 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:27.440
 the memory card is filmed with 25 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:29.630
 Images in seconds at 60 mbit or 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:32.180
 at 100 mbit there is the data rate 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:33.560
 vary is important who 100 mbit 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:35.480
 wants to film the needs synonymous one 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:38.180
 fast strong card in felting 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:41.000
 here at least one sdxc card with 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.739
 64 gb and according to the us 13 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.290
 standard who does not have such a thing if one 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:46.940
 the slower card has to be in 60 mbit 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.550
 But film is also enough for great 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:50.930
 Recordings 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:52.850
 in the video recording you have two 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:56.030
 Options one can in full format mode 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:57.890
 film in which case the camera takes one 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:00.950
 cutout of the sensor about 36 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:03.800
 megapixel corresponds to the 16 9 format and 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:05.480
 these 36 megapixels will be on 8 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:07.160
 megapixel downscaled that 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:09.200
 then corresponds to the 4k resolution 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.400
 thereby pixels are summarized the 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.470
 is a common procedure 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.300
 but who the maximum at four 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:16.430
 want to bring out quality 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:21.620
 The changes in the menu on the so-called 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:23.300
 super 35mm aps-c mode in the case takes 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.340
 the sensor a much smaller 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:28.280
 cut one of the approximately 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:30.500
 aps c size matches and in the case 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:31.520
 all pixels are read out individually 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.690
 definitely fits one 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.590
 significant increase in the 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:35.150
 video quality 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:36.560
 However, you have to think about it 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:38.900
 no head factor that means you have 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:40.580
 less in the picture than in the full-frame mode 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:41.810
 You can do that now if we film completely 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:43.790
 see well in the moment where we 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:45.590
 you see that you switch from the 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:46.940
 building has much less to see 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:49.400
 So they are so-called crop factor 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:51.500
 So extension factor right class 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:55.250
 you the combination of contrast and 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:57.290
 phase autofocus have a whopping 399 phase 

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:58.400
 We are here in the 7th market 2 after 

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:00.500
 especially then fun and at 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:02.270
 series picture mode take pictures with you 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:03.950
 example autofocus tracking that is 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:05.210
 we want to follow the motive we 

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:06.500
 you can demonstrate here 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:08.240
 my hand you can see this right 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:10.370
 little autofocus fields the my hand 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:13.100
 follow is right afloat have that 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:14.960
 Whole even in a box event 

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:15.980
 the sample and you can also 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:17.540
 you end up in the series 

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:19.100
 take pictures and get the best picture out of it 

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:20.990
 Here we are looking for example in 

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:22.880
 the blow is done so it does 

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:24.680
 the fun creates the total 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:28.640
 camera five pictures in seconds 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:30.740
 full resolution and 24 inch text or 

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:31.440
 raw recordings in sequence that is at the 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:33.300
 resolution 

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:36.750
 the crowd comes with a battery 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:38.460
 alpha 7 2 on 290 600 recordings 

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:40.920
 it's a little less than that 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:42.090
 as mr the good news sony packs 

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:42.750
 a second battery in the 

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:45.840
 delivery 

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:47.550
 our conclusion sony is with the alpha 7 times 

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:48.570
 2 a really nice camera 

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:50.790
 we have succeeded here a great 

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:54.090
 full format sensor with image stabilization 

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:56.640
 a first class picture quality 4k video 

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:59.040
 rapid autofocus so right 

00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:00.270
 really good overall package for scarce 

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:01.890
 three and a half thousand euros to 

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:04.640
 the launch is the camera, however 

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:04.640
 not a bargain either
