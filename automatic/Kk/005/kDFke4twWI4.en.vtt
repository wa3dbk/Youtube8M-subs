now<00:02:05.030> the<00:02:05.090> guys<00:02:05.329> at<00:02:05.539> Revelation<00:02:06.109> race<00:02:06.319> supplies

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
now the guys at Revelation race supplies

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:08.589 
now the guys at Revelation race supplies
have<00:02:07.069> really<00:02:07.490> thought<00:02:07.700> about<00:02:07.759> this<00:02:08.209> to<00:02:08.450> make

00:02:08.589 --> 00:02:08.599 
have really thought about this to make

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:10.719 
have really thought about this to make
it<00:02:08.810> as<00:02:08.929> easy<00:02:09.410> an<00:02:09.619> installation<00:02:10.190> as<00:02:10.280> possible

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
it as easy an installation as possible

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:12.670 
it as easy an installation as possible
in<00:02:11.060> fact<00:02:11.300> most<00:02:11.569> of<00:02:11.720> the<00:02:11.840> pre<00:02:11.989> fabrications

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
in fact most of the pre fabrications

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.559 
in fact most of the pre fabrications
already<00:02:12.950> done<00:02:13.129> for<00:02:13.370> you<00:02:13.459> all<00:02:14.030> you<00:02:14.150> need<00:02:14.269> to<00:02:14.420> do

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:14.569 
already done for you all you need to do

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:18.670 
already done for you all you need to do
is<00:02:14.780> mark<00:02:15.140> cut<00:02:15.890> weld<00:02:16.489> and<00:02:16.760> finish<00:02:17.420> it<00:02:17.569> off<00:02:17.660> so<00:02:18.560> if

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
is mark cut weld and finish it off so if

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:19.990 
is mark cut weld and finish it off so if
you<00:02:18.799> take<00:02:19.010> your<00:02:19.069> time<00:02:19.400> with<00:02:19.610> a<00:02:19.670> flooring
