 As a general overview, the following is a company that focuses mainly on online content. 

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:29.460
 The content is directed, but hardware performance or external connectivity is weak. 

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:35.340

 I think it's scarce. 

00:06:43.199 --> 00:06:54.900
 If you mix two products at night , 

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:57.060
 Still they lack a lot of content and because large number of users in fact consumers want 

00:06:54.900 --> 00:07:03.060
