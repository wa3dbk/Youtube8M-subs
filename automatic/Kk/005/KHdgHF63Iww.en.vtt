00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:24.869
 sometimes a man is now verb to shoot 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:28.559
 the first snow is all your prediction 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:39.230
 what does it mean it means what to 

00:00:28.559 --> 00:00:39.230
 we go had got down 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:52.220
 division by 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:55.100
 it's just a grader snow score can 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:01:11.150
 be disguised as traps especially 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:16.040
 water so we continue our our goal 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:17.840
 pantin they are very close here 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:24.590
 stopped their air 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:27.380
 see how the snow fell as you think 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:30.650
 what are they doing here they want to capture 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:36.009
 peace and lead natalia 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:37.810
 but this is what a strange construction 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:43.000
 zbika 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:51.110
 it's a cipher now it's their haven they 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:54.259
 going there and starting to clone i 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:02:00.289
 thought what kind of strange building 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:02:04.060
 really planning here and here 

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:04.060
 see there is such a strange house 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:13.040
 don't resist so what is it 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:15.870
 This means that its by its aliens 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.640
 Soon, good luck to small houses will not be and 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:21.180
 they will build another part 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:24.780
 and there they will land flying 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:27.150
 the device and probably there too will live 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:32.160
 aliens because I apparently 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:39.540
 it's not made for i love freaks 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:44.300
 Anatolicha if you very much snow 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.300
 which thread and area separately it means 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:55.220
 it is clear that 

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:58.430
 do what we will go bunker 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.030
 cover yes though our cool 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.620
 subsided 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.620
 but you can think of nothing 

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:07.880
 him to you 

00:04:34.559 --> 00:04:37.559
 smell 

00:05:26.249 --> 00:05:30.349
