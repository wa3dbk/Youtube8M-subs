 This is the same function you have since 

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:51.429
 The difference is 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:57.059
 After the world is over 

00:04:51.429 --> 00:04:59.709
 I get up and use the toilet paper once or twice. 

00:04:57.059 --> 00:05:01.800

 Existing volume adjustment Ball unrolling 

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:45.820
 If only our plug is plugged in like this 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:50.200
 After the installation is complete, 

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:54.760
 People will not do so if the human body detection 

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:59.800
 And I have been grasping the functionality of the laser off 

00:05:54.760 --> 00:06:03.400

 We save, but we can. 

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:30.350
 4 So far, I've given you a description of the function 

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:33.590
 If it is a product that only saves water 

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:40.450
 It will take a lot of time to cultivate the culture . 

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:43.310
 So, this time we will use the product to replace the effect of moving away 

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:49.580
 I'll explain. 

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:55.930
 In particular, SME products are difficult to adopt without validation . 

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:55.930
 Now I will be happy to explain to seobuteo has proven its rough results 

00:06:56.750 --> 00:07:04.009

00:07:00.259 --> 00:07:07.490
 We will install the upgrade and install our products. 

00:07:04.009 --> 00:07:12.949
 Our products are breaking into the counter 

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:15.620
 So for a week I'll leave it manually and check it out and for the next week 

00:07:12.949 --> 00:07:19.460
 It will be automatically checked and confirmed 

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:21.830
 This will result in the following: 

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:28.910
 Add to 

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:30.110
 Now, not something that a person is one who is writing the data to see who 

00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:33.590
 twice 

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:37.820
 Some love is falling three times 

00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:42.800
 So many of these writings have come up with quantitative data . 

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:45.410
 Water conservation is basically like coming . 

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:48.710
 And we install our products 

00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:51.770
 Just for a week, 

00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:54.380
 Just do not press me 

00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:58.220
 I feel that it is hygienic. 

00:07:54.380 --> 00:08:01.440
 Because I do not press an additional four feet 

00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:05.009
 You will feel convenient. 

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:12.800
 The core of our products is convenience 

00:08:05.009 --> 00:08:12.800
 Hygienic and strategic.
