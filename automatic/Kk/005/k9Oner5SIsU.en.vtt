of size when I keep it next to a smart

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:27.220 
of size when I keep it next to a smart
phone<00:03:25.130> like<00:03:25.459> the<00:03:25.610> Samsung<00:03:25.940> Galaxy<00:03:26.269> s5<00:03:26.570> you<00:03:27.080> can

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
phone like the Samsung Galaxy s5 you can

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.229 
phone like the Samsung Galaxy s5 you can
clearly<00:03:27.500> see<00:03:27.590> that<00:03:27.680> it's<00:03:27.920> almost<00:03:28.430> the<00:03:28.760> size<00:03:28.940> of

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:29.239 
clearly see that it's almost the size of

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:33.540 
clearly see that it's almost the size of
the<00:03:29.480> s5<00:03:29.840> or<00:03:30.370> almost<00:03:31.370> the<00:03:31.760> in<00:03:32.510> terms<00:03:32.810> of<00:03:32.989> length

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:33.550 
the s5 or almost the in terms of length

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:36.550 
the s5 or almost the in terms of length
so<00:03:34.550> overall<00:03:34.760> this<00:03:34.940> is<00:03:35.000> the<00:03:35.420> zukes<00:03:35.690> all<00:03:36.200> bank

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560 
so overall this is the zukes all bank

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.590 
so overall this is the zukes all bank
which<00:03:36.860> we<00:03:37.190> have<00:03:37.280> been<00:03:37.430> using<00:03:37.459> overall<00:03:38.120> already
