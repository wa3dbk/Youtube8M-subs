00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
so you put this over the mic to help

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.260 
so you put this over the mic to help
when<00:01:28.680> you're<00:01:28.829> filming<00:01:29.100> outside<00:01:29.640> to<00:01:29.939> cut<00:01:30.119> down

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
on the wind noise this is the microphone

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.140 
on the wind noise this is the microphone
itself<00:01:33.110> so<00:01:34.110> I'm<00:01:34.380> just<00:01:34.560> gonna<00:01:34.700> rotate<00:01:35.700> it<00:01:36.060> out<00:01:36.090> a

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
itself so I'm just gonna rotate it out a

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.670 
itself so I'm just gonna rotate it out a
little<00:01:36.299> bit<00:01:36.540> so<00:01:36.780> that<00:01:36.810> you<00:01:36.960> can<00:01:37.200> see<00:01:37.409> it<00:01:37.500> from

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
little bit so that you can see it from

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.980 
little bit so that you can see it from
all<00:01:37.799> angles<00:01:38.900> and<00:01:40.130> this<00:01:41.130> is<00:01:41.369> the<00:01:41.720> place<00:01:42.720> where

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
all angles and this is the place where

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.080 
all angles and this is the place where
you<00:01:43.110> would<00:01:43.259> insert<00:01:43.740> this<00:01:43.979> into<00:01:44.310> the<00:01:44.460> shoe<00:01:44.820> of

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
you would insert this into the shoe of

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.899 
you would insert this into the shoe of
your<00:01:45.810> camera<00:01:46.590> and<00:01:46.799> then<00:01:47.310> you<00:01:47.399> can<00:01:47.549> tighten

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
your camera and then you can tighten

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.520 
your camera and then you can tighten
down<00:01:47.939> the<00:01:48.509> knob<00:01:49.250> the<00:01:50.250> microphone<00:01:51.090> has<00:01:51.540> you<00:01:52.380> can

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
down the knob the microphone has you can

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.130 
down the knob the microphone has you can
see<00:01:52.770> that<00:01:53.070> it's<00:01:53.610> it's<00:01:53.850> actually<00:01:54.149> got<00:01:54.780> kind<00:01:55.049> of

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
see that it's it's actually got kind of

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.670 
see that it's it's actually got kind of
a<00:01:55.259> suspension<00:01:56.060> built<00:01:57.060> into<00:01:57.450> it<00:01:57.600> and<00:01:57.869> the

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
a suspension built into it and the

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.249 
a suspension built into it and the
purpose<00:01:59.009> of<00:01:59.219> the<00:01:59.340> suspension<00:02:00.090> is<00:02:00.299> so<00:02:00.899> that<00:02:01.110> in

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
purpose of the suspension is so that in

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.459 
purpose of the suspension is so that in
case<00:02:01.469> your<00:02:01.740> your<00:02:02.040> camera<00:02:02.610> vibrates<00:02:03.469> this

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
case your your camera vibrates this

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.310 
case your your camera vibrates this
suspension<00:02:05.219> cuts<00:02:05.759> down<00:02:06.060> on<00:02:06.360> the<00:02:06.630> noise<00:02:06.840> that

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
suspension cuts down on the noise that

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.850 
suspension cuts down on the noise that
would<00:02:07.409> be<00:02:07.590> transmitted<00:02:08.340> to<00:02:08.369> the<00:02:08.729> microphones

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
would be transmitted to the microphones

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.570 
would be transmitted to the microphones
another<00:02:10.860> interesting<00:02:11.370> feature<00:02:11.520> is

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
another interesting feature is

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.940 
another interesting feature is
these<00:02:12.790> these<00:02:13.390> are<00:02:13.570> two<00:02:13.960> microphones<00:02:14.290> so<00:02:14.890> you

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
these these are two microphones so you

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.200 
these these are two microphones so you
you're<00:02:15.490> you're<00:02:15.820> capturing<00:02:16.330> stereo<00:02:16.960> audio<00:02:17.290> and

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.210 
you're you're capturing stereo audio and

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:21.630 
you're you're capturing stereo audio and
there's<00:02:19.210> a<00:02:19.330> cardioid<00:02:20.050> response<00:02:20.950> pattern<00:02:21.460> to

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
there's a cardioid response pattern to

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.540 
there's a cardioid response pattern to
these<00:02:21.760> microphones<00:02:22.300> so<00:02:22.570> you<00:02:22.630> can<00:02:22.870> actually

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
these microphones so you can actually

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:28.800 
these microphones so you can actually
rotate<00:02:24.550> the<00:02:25.390> microphones<00:02:26.020> 180<00:02:26.920> degrees<00:02:27.810> to

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
rotate the microphones 180 degrees to

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.290 
rotate the microphones 180 degrees to
point<00:02:29.140> it<00:02:29.290> towards<00:02:29.890> your<00:02:30.160> sound<00:02:30.490> source<00:02:30.820> and

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
point it towards your sound source and

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.090 
point it towards your sound source and
that's<00:02:31.810> also<00:02:32.020> important<00:02:32.620> because<00:02:32.710> you<00:02:32.980> all

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
that's also important because you all

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.710 
that's also important because you all
you<00:02:33.340> you<00:02:33.640> want<00:02:33.820> to<00:02:33.880> be<00:02:33.970> sure<00:02:34.150> and<00:02:34.180> point<00:02:34.570> your

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
you you want to be sure and point your

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.190 
you you want to be sure and point your
mics<00:02:35.020> toward<00:02:35.920> the<00:02:36.100> sound<00:02:36.340> source<00:02:36.960> because<00:02:37.960> of

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
mics toward the sound source because of

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.250 
mics toward the sound source because of
its<00:02:38.380> it's<00:02:38.590> cardioid<00:02:39.100> response<00:02:39.970> pattern<00:02:40.360> some

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
its it's cardioid response pattern some

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:42.960 
its it's cardioid response pattern some
other<00:02:41.380> interesting<00:02:41.830> features<00:02:42.190> of<00:02:42.220> the

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
other interesting features of the

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.050 
other interesting features of the
microphone<00:02:43.690> are<00:02:44.110> that<00:02:44.560> it's<00:02:44.830> got<00:02:45.070> a<00:02:45.280> low<00:02:45.730> and

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
microphone are that it's got a low and

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.710 
microphone are that it's got a low and
high<00:02:46.150> sensitivity<00:02:47.080> switch<00:02:47.560> here<00:02:48.220> so<00:02:48.420> that<00:02:49.420> you

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
high sensitivity switch here so that you

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.810 
high sensitivity switch here so that you
know<00:02:49.810> high<00:02:50.050> is<00:02:50.110> obviously<00:02:51.010> a<00:02:51.130> lot<00:02:51.459> a<00:02:51.610> lot<00:02:51.760> more

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:51.820 
know high is obviously a lot a lot more

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:54.150 
know high is obviously a lot a lot more
sensitive<00:02:52.360> and<00:02:52.600> your<00:02:53.260> audio<00:02:53.560> will<00:02:53.770> be<00:02:53.920> louder

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
sensitive and your audio will be louder

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.840 
sensitive and your audio will be louder
and<00:02:54.430> on<00:02:55.120> this<00:02:55.240> side<00:02:55.510> we<00:02:55.780> have<00:02:55.810> a<00:02:56.320> flat<00:02:57.130> end<00:02:57.310> low

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:57.850 
and on this side we have a flat end low

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:01.199 
and on this side we have a flat end low
cut<00:02:58.090> frequency<00:02:58.600> filter<00:02:59.760> built-in<00:03:00.760> in<00:03:01.000> case

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209 
cut frequency filter built-in in case

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:03.360 
cut frequency filter built-in in case
you<00:03:01.420> you<00:03:01.750> you<00:03:02.080> need<00:03:02.260> to<00:03:02.290> cut<00:03:02.590> out<00:03:02.709> some<00:03:02.740> some

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
you you you need to cut out some some

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:08.370 
you you you need to cut out some some
low<00:03:03.520> end<00:03:03.900> audio<00:03:04.900> and<00:03:06.090> this<00:03:07.090> plugs<00:03:07.570> into<00:03:07.900> the

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
low end audio and this plugs into the

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.460 
low end audio and this plugs into the
3.5<00:03:08.890> millimeter<00:03:09.340> audio<00:03:09.850> jack<00:03:10.209> on<00:03:10.450> your<00:03:10.540> camera

3.5 millimeter audio jack on your camera

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:14.310 
3.5 millimeter audio jack on your camera
so<00:03:12.390> first<00:03:13.390> you<00:03:13.600> might<00:03:13.720> want<00:03:13.870> to<00:03:13.900> be<00:03:13.990> sure<00:03:14.170> and

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:14.320 
so first you might want to be sure and

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.080 
so first you might want to be sure and
checked<00:03:14.620> make<00:03:14.830> sure<00:03:15.040> that<00:03:15.280> your<00:03:15.400> camera<00:03:15.820> has

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
checked make sure that your camera has

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.479 
checked make sure that your camera has
an<00:03:16.510> audio<00:03:17.080> jack<00:03:17.140> so<00:03:17.650> that<00:03:17.830> you<00:03:17.920> can<00:03:18.130> connect

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:18.489 
an audio jack so that you can connect

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:21.690 
an audio jack so that you can connect
this<00:03:18.840> external<00:03:19.840> microphone<00:03:20.500> I<00:03:20.739> don't<00:03:21.489> have<00:03:21.610> an

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
this external microphone I don't have an

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.160 
this external microphone I don't have an
extra<00:03:21.880> camera<00:03:22.120> here<00:03:22.390> to<00:03:22.480> show<00:03:22.630> you<00:03:22.690> but<00:03:22.930> you

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
extra camera here to show you but you

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.350 
extra camera here to show you but you
would<00:03:23.560> insert<00:03:24.070> the<00:03:24.459> microphone<00:03:24.940> into<00:03:25.269> the

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:25.360 
would insert the microphone into the

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.440 
would insert the microphone into the
shoe<00:03:25.600> on<00:03:25.630> top<00:03:25.840> of<00:03:26.230> your<00:03:26.380> DSLR<00:03:27.190> camera<00:03:27.640> and<00:03:27.940> then

shoe on top of your DSLR camera and then
plug<00:03:28.690> this<00:03:28.900> into<00:03:29.200> the<00:03:29.380> audio<00:03:29.920> jack<00:03:30.090> now<00:03:31.090> my

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
plug this into the audio jack now my

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.199 
plug this into the audio jack now my
camera<00:03:32.290> is<00:03:32.650> very<00:03:33.190> loud<00:03:33.459> actually

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:34.209 
camera is very loud actually

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:36.780 
camera is very loud actually
when<00:03:34.450> the<00:03:34.540> lens<00:03:34.750> focuses<00:03:35.500> it's<00:03:36.040> a<00:03:36.190> very<00:03:36.400> loud

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
when the lens focuses it's a very loud

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:40.440

your cameras shoe sloth so this helps
give<00:04:00.340> the<00:04:00.370> microphone<00:04:00.880> a<00:04:01.150> little<00:04:01.239> bit<00:04:01.480> of

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:01.660 
give the microphone a little bit of

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:05.820 
give the microphone a little bit of
distance<00:04:02.290> away<00:04:02.620> from<00:04:03.150> the<00:04:04.230> noisy<00:04:05.230> camera<00:04:05.650> lens

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:05.830 
distance away from the noisy camera lens

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:08.550 
distance away from the noisy camera lens
and<00:04:06.100> this<00:04:06.910> also<00:04:07.150> helps<00:04:07.630> put<00:04:07.989> the<00:04:08.110> microphone

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.650 
and this also helps put the microphone
just<00:04:09.070> a<00:04:09.370> little<00:04:09.640> bit<00:04:09.730> closer<00:04:10.000> to<00:04:10.299> your<00:04:10.420> sound

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:10.660 
just a little bit closer to your sound

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:13.229 
just a little bit closer to your sound
source<00:04:11.049> now<00:04:11.739> one<00:04:11.980> benefit<00:04:12.489> that<00:04:12.700> I<00:04:12.730> really

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:13.239 
source now one benefit that I really

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:15.330 
source now one benefit that I really
like<00:04:13.450> about<00:04:13.690> this<00:04:14.019> camera<00:04:14.320> and<00:04:14.650> at<00:04:14.980> first<00:04:15.130> I

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.340 
like about this camera and at first I

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:17.280 
like about this camera and at first I
was<00:04:15.430> a<00:04:15.459> little<00:04:15.489> bit<00:04:15.760> skeptical<00:04:16.269> but<00:04:16.930> this

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:17.290 
was a little bit skeptical but this

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:20.070 
was a little bit skeptical but this
camera<00:04:17.560> does<00:04:17.890> not<00:04:18.130> need<00:04:18.519> its<00:04:19.150> own<00:04:19.450> 9-volt

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:20.080 
camera does not need its own 9-volt

problems<00:04:42.199> I<00:04:42.500> was<00:04:43.160> a<00:04:43.190> little<00:04:43.460> skeptical<00:04:43.910> of

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:44.180 
problems I was a little skeptical of

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:46.930 
problems I was a little skeptical of
that<00:04:44.240> though<00:04:44.600> because<00:04:45.020> all<00:04:45.350> other<00:04:45.940> external

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:46.940 
that though because all other external

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:49.150 
that though because all other external
microphones<00:04:47.630> that<00:04:48.050> got<00:04:48.290> all<00:04:48.560> of<00:04:48.740> its<00:04:48.889> power

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:49.160 
microphones that got all of its power

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.820 
microphones that got all of its power
from<00:04:49.729> the<00:04:49.940> audio<00:04:50.240> jack<00:04:50.600> the<00:04:51.110> sound<00:04:51.350> quality

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:51.830 
from the audio jack the sound quality

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:53.950 
from the audio jack the sound quality
was<00:04:51.949> not<00:04:52.160> so<00:04:52.310> good<00:04:52.460> but<00:04:53.419> you'll<00:04:53.600> see<00:04:53.780> in<00:04:53.870> a

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:53.960 
was not so good but you'll see in a

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.170 
was not so good but you'll see in a
second<00:04:54.350> that<00:04:54.440> the<00:04:54.860> sound<00:04:55.130> quality<00:04:55.610> on<00:04:55.700> this<00:04:55.880> is

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:56.180 
second that the sound quality on this is

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:58.450 
second that the sound quality on this is
very<00:04:56.690> good<00:04:56.990> considering<00:04:57.740> the<00:04:57.950> fact<00:04:58.160> that<00:04:58.340> it

00:04:58.450 --> 00:04:58.460 
very good considering the fact that it

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:00.610 
very good considering the fact that it
does<00:04:58.610> not<00:04:58.760> need<00:04:58.970> its<00:04:59.150> own<00:04:59.240> battery<00:04:59.510> so<00:05:00.229> how

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:00.620 
does not need its own battery so how

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:02.920 
does not need its own battery so how
does<00:05:00.680> the<00:05:01.010> microphone<00:05:01.400> sound<00:05:01.729> well<00:05:02.389> up<00:05:02.600> until

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:02.930 
does the microphone sound well up until

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:04.450 
does the microphone sound well up until
now<00:05:03.050> you've<00:05:03.290> been<00:05:03.440> hearing<00:05:03.620> audio<00:05:04.070> from<00:05:04.400> my

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:04.460 
now you've been hearing audio from my

suddenly<00:05:41.960> there<00:05:42.860> came<00:05:43.099> a<00:05:43.370> tapping<00:05:43.520> as<00:05:43.960> if

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:44.960 
suddenly there came a tapping as if

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:47.920 
suddenly there came a tapping as if
someone<00:05:45.349> gently<00:05:45.889> rapping<00:05:46.070> rapping<00:05:46.870> at<00:05:47.870> my

tapping at my chamber door only this and

tapping at my chamber door only this and
nothing<00:05:55.010> more<00:05:56.110> so<00:05:57.110> hopefully<00:05:57.500> from<00:05:57.590> that

00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:57.800 
nothing more so hopefully from that

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:59.290 
nothing more so hopefully from that
experiment<00:05:58.190> and<00:05:58.550> in<00:05:58.669> fact<00:05:58.820> I've<00:05:59.000> got<00:05:59.150> the

00:05:59.290 --> 00:05:59.300 
experiment and in fact I've got the

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:01.180 
experiment and in fact I've got the
microphone<00:05:59.810> installed<00:06:00.440> in<00:06:00.650> the<00:06:00.740> camera<00:06:01.070> now

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:01.190 
microphone installed in the camera now

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:04.180 
microphone installed in the camera now
so<00:06:01.970> even<00:06:02.690> if<00:06:02.780> you<00:06:02.870> couldn't<00:06:03.080> tell<00:06:03.320> from<00:06:03.650> me

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:04.190 
so even if you couldn't tell from me

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:06.550 
so even if you couldn't tell from me
reading<00:06:04.490> those<00:06:04.700> couple<00:06:05.539> lines<00:06:05.750> from<00:06:06.139> Edgar

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:06.560 
reading those couple lines from Edgar

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:09.040 
reading those couple lines from Edgar
Allan<00:06:06.770> Poe's<00:06:06.979> the<00:06:07.010> Raven<00:06:07.300> go<00:06:08.300> back<00:06:08.510> and<00:06:08.720> listen

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:09.050 
Allan Poe's the Raven go back and listen

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:11.710 
Allan Poe's the Raven go back and listen
to<00:06:09.080> this<00:06:09.530> portion<00:06:10.099> of<00:06:10.190> the<00:06:10.280> video<00:06:10.570> versus<00:06:11.570> the

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:11.720 
to this portion of the video versus the

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:13.960 
to this portion of the video versus the
audio<00:06:12.080> from<00:06:12.380> the<00:06:12.950> video<00:06:13.520> at<00:06:13.729> the<00:06:13.849> beginning

audio from the video at the beginning

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:15.990 
audio from the video at the beginning
and<00:06:14.450> hopefully<00:06:14.810> you<00:06:15.169> can<00:06:15.200> tell<00:06:15.740> a<00:06:15.800> difference

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:16.000 
and hopefully you can tell a difference

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.750 
and hopefully you can tell a difference
that<00:06:17.000> is<00:06:17.330> the<00:06:17.570> benefit<00:06:18.080> of<00:06:18.410> using<00:06:18.950> an<00:06:19.220> external

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:19.760 
that is the benefit of using an external

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:21.879 
that is the benefit of using an external
microphone<00:06:19.940> instead<00:06:20.900> of<00:06:21.139> your<00:06:21.320> camera's

microphone instead of your camera's
built-in<00:06:22.270> microphone<00:06:23.270> now<00:06:23.780> obviously<00:06:24.289> you're

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:24.440 
built-in microphone now obviously you're

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:26.080 
built-in microphone now obviously you're
still<00:06:24.650> going<00:06:24.770> to<00:06:24.800> be<00:06:24.919> using<00:06:25.370> your<00:06:25.490> camera's

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:26.090 
still going to be using your camera's

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:29.589 
still going to be using your camera's
internal<00:06:26.690> audio<00:06:27.340> circuitry<00:06:28.340> and<00:06:28.460> software<00:06:29.090> to

00:06:29.589 --> 00:06:29.599 
internal audio circuitry and software to

00:06:29.599 --> 00:06:32.200 
internal audio circuitry and software to
process<00:06:29.930> that<00:06:30.500> audio<00:06:30.889> but<00:06:31.520> by<00:06:31.640> using<00:06:31.909> this

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:32.210 
process that audio but by using this

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:35.020 
process that audio but by using this
external<00:06:32.690> microphone<00:06:33.349> you'll<00:06:33.860> upgrade<00:06:34.219> your

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:35.030 
external microphone you'll upgrade your

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:35.959 
external microphone you'll upgrade your
audio<00:06:35.390> quality

00:06:35.959 --> 00:06:35.969 
audio quality

00:06:35.969 --> 00:06:38.059 
audio quality
so<00:06:36.419> much<00:06:36.659> more<00:06:36.929> than<00:06:36.989> relying<00:06:37.709> on<00:06:37.919> your

00:06:38.059 --> 00:06:38.069 
so much more than relying on your

00:06:38.069 --> 00:06:40.249 
so much more than relying on your
camera's<00:06:38.459> own<00:06:38.699> internal<00:06:39.449> microphone<00:06:39.899> and

00:06:40.249 --> 00:06:40.259 
camera's own internal microphone and

00:06:40.259 --> 00:06:42.169 
camera's own internal microphone and
with<00:06:40.649> the<00:06:40.769> benefit<00:06:41.159> of<00:06:41.189> the<00:06:41.489> extension<00:06:41.969> arm

00:06:42.169 --> 00:06:42.179 
with the benefit of the extension arm

00:06:42.179 --> 00:06:45.109 
with the benefit of the extension arm
the<00:06:42.809> shock<00:06:43.349> mount<00:06:43.709> and<00:06:43.979> the<00:06:44.610> directional

00:06:45.109 --> 00:06:45.119 
the shock mount and the directional

00:06:45.119 --> 00:06:47.809 
the shock mount and the directional
stereo<00:06:45.719> cardioid<00:06:46.379> microphones<00:06:47.009> you'll<00:06:47.669> be

00:06:47.809 --> 00:06:47.819 
stereo cardioid microphones you'll be

00:06:47.819 --> 00:06:50.029 
stereo cardioid microphones you'll be
able<00:06:47.939> to<00:06:48.209> isolate<00:06:48.449> the<00:06:48.989> sound<00:06:49.259> that<00:06:49.649> much<00:06:49.799> more

00:06:50.029 --> 00:06:50.039 
able to isolate the sound that much more

00:06:50.039 --> 00:06:52.399 
able to isolate the sound that much more
and<00:06:50.399> the<00:06:51.029> fact<00:06:51.239> that<00:06:51.449> it<00:06:51.569> doesn't<00:06:51.749> require<00:06:52.079> an

00:06:52.399 --> 00:06:52.409 
and the fact that it doesn't require an

00:06:52.409 --> 00:06:54.589 
and the fact that it doesn't require an
external<00:06:52.799> battery<00:06:52.919> makes<00:06:53.579> it<00:06:53.759> that<00:06:53.969> much<00:06:54.209> more

00:06:54.589 --> 00:06:54.599 
external battery makes it that much more

00:06:54.599 --> 00:06:56.569 
external battery makes it that much more
convenient<00:06:55.079> so<00:06:55.709> this<00:06:55.829> has<00:06:55.949> been<00:06:56.069> a<00:06:56.129> look<00:06:56.369> at

00:06:56.569 --> 00:06:56.579 
convenient so this has been a look at

00:06:56.579 --> 00:07:00.319 
convenient so this has been a look at
the<00:06:56.699> tascam<00:06:57.209> TM<00:06:58.019> 2x<00:06:58.559> stereo<00:06:59.219> microphone<00:06:59.759> for

00:07:00.319 --> 00:07:00.329 
the tascam TM 2x stereo microphone for

00:07:00.329 --> 00:07:03.109 
the tascam TM 2x stereo microphone for
