00:04:53.449 --> 00:04:53.459 
got hurt that he didn't know how to

00:04:53.459 --> 00:04:55.730 
got hurt that he didn't know how to
defend<00:04:53.849> himself<00:04:53.999> the<00:04:54.749> way<00:04:54.899> he<00:04:55.110> did<00:04:55.349> defend

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:55.740 
defend himself the way he did defend

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:57.649 
defend himself the way he did defend
himself<00:04:55.889> was<00:04:56.279> just<00:04:56.309> to<00:04:56.580> go<00:04:56.729> right<00:04:56.999> back<00:04:57.270> at<00:04:57.509> him

himself was just to go right back at him

00:04:57.659 --> 00:04:59.899 
himself was just to go right back at him
expression<00:04:58.589> I<00:04:58.800> kept<00:04:59.009> hearing<00:04:59.219> when<00:04:59.520> I<00:04:59.550> did<00:04:59.789> the

00:04:59.899 --> 00:04:59.909 
expression I kept hearing when I did the

00:04:59.909 --> 00:05:01.850 
expression I kept hearing when I did the
interview<00:05:00.119> guys<00:05:00.869> was<00:05:01.169> that<00:05:01.319> he<00:05:01.409> couldn't<00:05:01.649> hold

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:01.860 
interview guys was that he couldn't hold

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:02.600 
interview guys was that he couldn't hold
the<00:05:02.069> punch

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:02.610 
the punch

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:04.549 
the punch
I<00:05:02.639> thought<00:05:03.179> he<00:05:03.330> held<00:05:03.509> it<00:05:03.659> well<00:05:03.839> because<00:05:04.050> Ali

00:05:04.549 --> 00:05:04.559 
I thought he held it well because Ali

00:05:04.559 --> 00:05:07.070 
I thought he held it well because Ali
even<00:05:04.860> wound<00:05:05.219> up<00:05:05.429> like<00:05:05.580> a<00:05:05.610> sidearm<00:05:05.999> picture<00:05:06.749> and

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:07.080 
even wound up like a sidearm picture and

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:09.859 
even wound up like a sidearm picture and
look<00:05:07.259> at<00:05:07.409> him<00:05:07.559> and<00:05:08.069> gun<00:05:08.969> kept<00:05:09.300> coming<00:05:09.689> back

00:05:09.859 --> 00:05:09.869 
look at him and gun kept coming back

00:05:09.869 --> 00:05:11.720 
look at him and gun kept coming back
which<00:05:10.169> was<00:05:10.319> amazing

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:11.730 
which was amazing

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:14.570 
which was amazing
even<00:05:12.420> when<00:05:12.540> a<00:05:12.570> referee<00:05:13.050> called<00:05:13.440> it<00:05:13.680> no<00:05:14.250> fight

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:14.580 
even when a referee called it no fight

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:19.490 
even when a referee called it no fight
dunce<00:05:15.030> cap<00:05:15.450> Howard<00:05:15.780> no<00:05:15.960> no<00:05:16.440> no<00:05:16.860> there<00:05:17.280> is<00:05:18.500> and

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:19.500 
dunce cap Howard no no no there is and

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:22.100 
dunce cap Howard no no no there is and
at<00:05:19.620> that<00:05:19.740> point<00:05:19.950> I<00:05:20.160> felt<00:05:20.370> the<00:05:20.640> referee<00:05:21.360> hit<00:05:22.050> a

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:22.110 
at that point I felt the referee hit a

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:23.690 
at that point I felt the referee hit a
happy<00:05:22.560> medium<00:05:22.980> as<00:05:23.130> much<00:05:23.340> as<00:05:23.520> could<00:05:23.640> be

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:23.700 
happy medium as much as could be

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:25.190 
happy medium as much as could be
expected<00:05:23.820> you<00:05:24.240> want<00:05:24.420> the<00:05:24.510> Challenger<00:05:24.960> to<00:05:25.080> have

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:25.200 
expected you want the Challenger to have

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:26.810 
expected you want the Challenger to have
a<00:05:25.230> chance<00:05:25.530> to<00:05:25.710> win<00:05:25.830> the<00:05:25.980> fight<00:05:26.190> on<00:05:26.430> the<00:05:26.490> other

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:26.820 
a chance to win the fight on the other

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:28.160 
a chance to win the fight on the other
hand<00:05:27.030> you<00:05:27.150> do<00:05:27.300> want<00:05:27.480> him<00:05:27.570> to<00:05:27.690> leave<00:05:27.870> the<00:05:27.990> ring

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:28.170 
hand you do want him to leave the ring

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:30.050 
hand you do want him to leave the ring
permanently<00:05:28.680> injured<00:05:29.040> and<00:05:29.340> I<00:05:29.430> thought<00:05:29.640> he<00:05:29.760> he

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:30.060 
permanently injured and I thought he he

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:31.400 
permanently injured and I thought he he
drew<00:05:30.270> the<00:05:30.420> line<00:05:30.450> rather<00:05:30.840> well<00:05:31.050> maybe<00:05:31.260> the

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:31.410 
drew the line rather well maybe the

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:32.960 
drew the line rather well maybe the

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:34.590 
that is the unpleasant part of the game

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:35.990 
that is the unpleasant part of the game
