00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:08.100
 in a little while and then there will not only be the year 2009 but also it again 

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:11.249
 first decade of the 21st century 

00:00:11.249 --> 00:00:14.469
 we do not have to ignore that for us 

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:17.749
 was not exactly a great decade 

00:00:17.749 --> 00:00:19.949
 make two national championships 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.390
 actually but in the european campaign which according to really with the strongest 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:25.279
 could measure 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:28.369
 in the tent is a member of 2002 2003 what is that 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:32.370
 then olympique eliminated lyon from arsenal 

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:36.030
 the eu is roma and in the end as in iran just not 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.230
 That first decade of the 21st century was also the first decade in which we too 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:43.760
 had to do with the Bosman judgment 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.370
 and that bosman judgment has it all for clubs from smaller football countries 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.250
 made very difficult to retain good players for a long time and there it is 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.250
 ajax confronts nine hard times 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:59.640
 it has led h to be as spoiled as we were in the nineties 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.640
 scanty were actually the nineties 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:07.840
 we are very good at doing sports in difficult times 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.580
 as if nothing good at our club anymore 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.910
 and in that they temporarily flee I like to this place 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:15.210
 the future 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.619
 the home port of young ajax but also the home port of our youth teams and the 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:24.630
 Saturday amateurs there is the Amsterdam arena across the street 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:26.150
 here 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.420
 beats as it is then called the heart of the association 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.440
 and that is really true 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.110
 People who claim that Ajax has become a cold company where everything is alone 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:39.030
 but the money revolves around which I gladly take with me on one 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.260
 Monday night when young ajax plays there or on a Saturday afternoon when we're on here 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.410
 all fields youth and amateur competitions take place 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.590
 the people that I then take here are often surprised about it 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.670
 DIY atmosphere that hangs here 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.680
 here ajax is still close the association in the canteen there in the main building 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:02.060
 there was no anonymous catering staff behind the bar easy people official language 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.750
 is generally civilized Amsterdam you can buy a beer here a sandwich ball 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.709
 and then you just pay with money not with the end of the ride chip card 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:14.270
 no nonsense things like that are even harder here in the future 

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:18.989
 far too expensive residents always sit in the stands 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:22.810
 because the future also lies in the middle of the society of Amsterdam South East 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.810
 You also come here many I players against another club of people 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.790
 in the wild, for example, makes watching football from very close by 

00:02:30.689 --> 00:02:35.099
 this makes me realize the future more than anywhere else, what a great club 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:36.959
 ajax actually is 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:41.310
 You may not be able to do a great series in the NFL cup that young Ajax 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.610
 ever made in the 2010 season 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:44.989
 2002 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:45.969
 the most famous 

00:02:45.969 --> 00:02:48.320
 the matches of that series are against 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.320
 Twente and Utrecht became that were played there in the Amsterdam arena 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:56.229
 To this the future began the adventure here were Haarlem and the county 

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:57.569
 already disabled 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:58.720
 bush 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.780
 the intimates of the future who already knew how well that young Ajax team really did 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:03.260
 used to be 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.489
 it was also trained Jan olde Riekerink the man who 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:09.809
 who is now head of the youth academy again 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:13.369
 I just want to say 

00:03:13.369 --> 00:03:16.240
 ajax is more than just the aex and 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.290
 and I can also recommend it ajacied 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:21.900
 to occasionally come here for an afternoon or evening playing football here in the future 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.990
 firstly because it is very cozy and secondly it is also one 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:30.190
 very good medicine for an ajaxied who has 7 bales of the way things are 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:33.570
 around the first team and let's face it we have it over 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:36.570
 have experienced it all over the decade 

00:03:37.189 --> 00:03:40.909
 a visit to the future it is a good way to believe one hundred and twenty 

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:45.259
 to believe again I let it all happen at this club 

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:48.589
 to feel ideas completely ajax 

00:03:48.589 --> 00:03:52.699
 football I see more fun than the average chip league game 

00:03:53.559 --> 00:03:54.550
 I believe 

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:55.340
 in the future
