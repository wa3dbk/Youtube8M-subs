00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:15.430 
have a surge and let me take a look at
the<00:03:14.000> post<00:03:14.239> to<00:03:14.420> see<00:03:14.599> what<00:03:14.780> we<00:03:14.870> want<00:03:15.049> to<00:03:15.140> do<00:03:15.260> with

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
the post to see what we want to do with

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.640 
the post to see what we want to do with
that<00:03:15.620> I<00:03:15.890> just<00:03:16.730> double<00:03:17.090> check<00:03:17.299> the<00:03:17.450> post<00:03:17.660> we

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
that I just double check the post we

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:21.400 
that I just double check the post we
certainly<00:03:19.010> have<00:03:19.220> plenty<00:03:19.250> of<00:03:19.849> range<00:03:20.239> here<00:03:20.720> to

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:21.410 
certainly have plenty of range here to

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:25.300 
certainly have plenty of range here to
hit<00:03:21.769> the<00:03:21.920> target<00:03:22.129> and<00:03:23.530> the<00:03:24.530> player<00:03:24.769> wants<00:03:25.190> to

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310 
hit the target and the player wants to

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:28.659 
hit the target and the player wants to
use<00:03:25.609> the<00:03:25.940> surge<00:03:26.540> to<00:03:26.900> regain<00:03:27.260> fatigue<00:03:28.099> perhaps

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:28.669 
use the surge to regain fatigue perhaps

00:03:28.669 --> 00:03:33.550 
use the surge to regain fatigue perhaps
I<00:03:28.880> should<00:03:29.090> say<00:03:30.370> recover<00:03:31.389> stamina<00:03:32.560> suffer

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
I should say recover stamina suffer

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.430 
I should say recover stamina suffer
fatigue<00:03:34.010> and<00:03:34.340> recover<00:03:34.849> stamina<00:03:35.359> I<00:03:35.389> guess<00:03:35.690> so

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
fatigue and recover stamina I guess so

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.879 
fatigue and recover stamina I guess so
we'll<00:03:36.590> take<00:03:36.739> that<00:03:36.889> off<00:03:37.299> no<00:03:38.299> fatigue<00:03:38.870> on<00:03:39.139> the

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:39.889 
we'll take that off no fatigue on the

00:03:39.889 --> 00:03:42.009 
we'll take that off no fatigue on the
widow<00:03:40.099> thara<00:03:40.430> at<00:03:40.639> this<00:03:40.849> time<00:03:41.090> well<00:03:41.870> the

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:42.019 
widow thara at this time well the

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:44.710 
widow thara at this time well the
barghest<00:03:42.440> has<00:03:42.680> a<00:03:42.709> health<00:03:43.250> of<00:03:43.519> four<00:03:44.090> but<00:03:44.569> it

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720 
barghest has a health of four but it

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:50.289 
barghest has a health of four but it
certainly<00:03:44.930> suffered<00:03:46.359> one<00:03:47.359> damage<00:03:47.750> there<00:03:49.299> well

00:03:50.289 --> 00:03:50.299 
certainly suffered one damage there well

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:52.809 
certainly suffered one damage there well
we're<00:03:50.690> not<00:03:50.810> quite<00:03:51.109> done<00:03:51.139> the<00:03:51.919> familiar<00:03:52.579> gets

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.620 
will make its attack on the adjacent

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:16.449 
will make its attack on the adjacent

you<00:04:54.050> can<00:04:54.230> see<00:04:54.410> on<00:04:54.560> the<00:04:54.680> card<00:04:54.950> there<00:04:55.250> I<00:04:55.750> believe

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:56.750 
you can see on the card there I believe

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:58.930 
you can see on the card there I believe
it<00:04:56.900> can<00:04:57.020> still<00:04:57.320> take<00:04:57.530> a<00:04:57.560> move<00:04:57.890> action<00:04:58.130> if<00:04:58.610> i'm

00:04:58.930 --> 00:04:58.940 
it can still take a move action if i'm

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:01.360 
it can still take a move action if i'm
not<00:04:59.090> mistaken<00:04:59.410> so<00:05:00.410> let<00:05:00.620> me<00:05:00.710> know<00:05:00.860> if<00:05:01.040> you<00:05:01.160> want

seven range one damage and two surges
well<00:06:02.030> it's<00:06:02.660> also<00:06:02.930> got<00:06:03.260> Pierce<00:06:03.710> which<00:06:04.370> in<00:06:04.640> this

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:04.760 
well it's also got Pierce which in this

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:06.930 
well it's also got Pierce which in this
instance<00:06:04.940> is<00:06:05.360> not<00:06:05.510> going<00:06:05.660> to<00:06:05.720> do<00:06:05.900> anything<00:06:06.140> but

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:06.940 
instance is not going to do anything but

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:09.880 
instance is not going to do anything but
certainly<00:06:07.940> we<00:06:08.150> can<00:06:08.180> boost<00:06:08.540> the<00:06:08.660> damage<00:06:09.140> by<00:06:09.440> two

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:09.890 
certainly we can boost the damage by two

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:11.830 
certainly we can boost the damage by two
that's<00:06:10.280> going<00:06:10.490> to<00:06:10.550> be<00:06:10.700> three<00:06:11.240> points<00:06:11.720> of

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:11.840 
that's going to be three points of

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:15.010 
that's going to be three points of
damage<00:06:11.990> and<00:06:12.410> then<00:06:13.400> we<00:06:13.550> can<00:06:13.580> possibly<00:06:14.300> activate

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:15.020 
damage and then we can possibly activate

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:18.760 
damage and then we can possibly activate
the<00:06:15.200> second<00:06:15.770> surge<00:06:16.570> which<00:06:17.570> is<00:06:17.840> plus<00:06:18.230> 1<00:06:18.530> damage

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:18.770 
the second surge which is plus 1 damage

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:23.250 
the second surge which is plus 1 damage
and<00:06:19.160> move<00:06:19.280> the<00:06:19.460> target<00:06:19.670> one<00:06:20.060> space<00:06:20.590> however<00:06:22.240> 1

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:23.260 
and move the target one space however 1

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:28.510 
and move the target one space however 1
2<00:06:24.260> 3<00:06:24.290> 4<00:06:25.930> 4<00:06:26.930> damage<00:06:27.230> is<00:06:27.620> going<00:06:28.070> to<00:06:28.220> kill<00:06:28.490> that

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:28.520 
2 3 4 4 damage is going to kill that

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:34.630

let's<00:06:47.810> see<00:06:48.080> what<00:06:48.230> the<00:06:48.350> range<00:06:48.620> would<00:06:48.920> be<00:06:48.980> to<00:06:49.340> try

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:49.670 
let's see what the range would be to try

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:56.130 
let's see what the range would be to try
go<00:06:49.790> after<00:06:50.090> this<00:06:50.210> next<00:06:51.250> minion<00:06:52.250> Argost<00:06:54.520> 1234

go after this next minion Argost 1234

00:06:56.140 --> 00:07:02.140 
go after this next minion Argost 1234
you'd<00:06:57.140> need<00:06:57.320> 5<00:06:57.650> range<00:06:58.130> to<00:06:58.460> hit<00:06:58.760> it<00:07:00.580> let's<00:07:01.580> see<00:07:01.910> I

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:02.150 
you'd need 5 range to hit it let's see I

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:05.170 
you'd need 5 range to hit it let's see I
just<00:07:02.630> double<00:07:03.470> check<00:07:03.680> the<00:07:03.830> post<00:07:04.100> and<00:07:04.400> Robert

what he's going to do we just need some
good<00:07:15.320> range<00:07:15.620> to<00:07:16.130> get<00:07:16.280> this<00:07:16.430> same<00:07:17.180> dice<00:07:17.720> as

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:18.080 
good range to get this same dice as

good range to get this same dice as
before<00:07:22.630> and<00:07:23.800> I<00:07:24.800> don't<00:07:25.100> think<00:07:25.370> we're<00:07:25.490> going<00:07:25.580> to

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:25.670 
before and I don't think we're going to

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:32.070 
before and I don't think we're going to
come<00:07:25.850> up<00:07:25.880> with<00:07:26.120> enough<00:07:26.360> range<00:07:26.690> here<00:07:29.680> for

come up with enough range here for
damage<00:07:33.080> and<00:07:34.090> damage<00:07:36.010> but<00:07:37.010> I<00:07:37.040> don't<00:07:37.280> see<00:07:37.430> any

damage and damage but I don't see any
way<00:07:37.730> to<00:07:37.790> boost<00:07:38.090> the<00:07:38.570> range<00:07:40.960> so<00:07:41.960> unless<00:07:42.230> I've

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:42.470 
way to boost the range so unless I've

way to boost the range so unless I've
missed<00:07:42.770> anything<00:07:44.500> we<00:07:45.500> take<00:07:45.710> a<00:07:45.740> look<00:07:45.950> at<00:07:46.070> this

00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:46.190 
missed anything we take a look at this
