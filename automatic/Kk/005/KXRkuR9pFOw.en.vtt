00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
once or twice a week and think they're

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.310 
once or twice a week and think they're
working<00:02:30.310> them<00:02:30.550> quite<00:02:30.730> hard<00:02:30.940> but<00:02:31.360> generally<00:02:31.930> we

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:32.320 
working them quite hard but generally we

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.260 
working them quite hard but generally we
do<00:02:32.440> find<00:02:32.740> this<00:02:32.830> more<00:02:33.100> and<00:02:33.250> more<00:02:33.310> that<00:02:33.910> ponies

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:34.270 
do find this more and more that ponies

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:35.310 
do find this more and more that ponies
are<00:02:34.390> just<00:02:34.510> left<00:02:34.630> in<00:02:34.780> the<00:02:34.840> field<00:02:34.990> for<00:02:35.110> the<00:02:35.170> whole

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:35.320 
are just left in the field for the whole

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.620 
are just left in the field for the whole
of<00:02:35.350> the<00:02:35.620> summer<00:02:36.400> sometimes<00:02:37.060> it<00:02:37.210> rectifies

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
of the summer sometimes it rectifies

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:39.900 
of the summer sometimes it rectifies
itself<00:02:37.960> in<00:02:38.080> the<00:02:38.140> winter<00:02:38.470> as<00:02:38.620> nature<00:02:39.310> intended

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
itself in the winter as nature intended

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:41.820 
itself in the winter as nature intended
but<00:02:40.210> generally<00:02:40.660> then<00:02:41.110> the<00:02:41.290> owner<00:02:41.410> starts<00:02:41.740> to

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830 
but generally then the owner starts to

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:42.990 
but generally then the owner starts to
feed<00:02:42.010> them<00:02:42.130> even<00:02:42.400> more<00:02:42.580> because<00:02:42.790> it's

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
feed them even more because it's

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.460 
feed them even more because it's
wintertime<00:02:43.450> so<00:02:43.480> it's<00:02:43.900> a<00:02:43.990> never-ending<00:02:44.230> cycle

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
wintertime so it's a never-ending cycle

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:47.280 
wintertime so it's a never-ending cycle
and<00:02:44.950> we<00:02:45.010> find<00:02:45.250> it<00:02:45.370> more<00:02:46.060> and<00:02:46.300> more<00:02:46.540> that<00:02:47.200> the

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
and we find it more and more that the

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:49.380 
and we find it more and more that the
horses<00:02:47.560> are<00:02:47.830> getting<00:02:48.280> fatter<00:02:48.820> and<00:02:48.940> staying

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
horses are getting fatter and staying

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:50.940 
horses are getting fatter and staying
fat<00:02:49.750> all<00:02:49.990> year<00:02:50.290> round<00:02:50.500> and<00:02:50.710> that<00:02:50.800> obviously

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
fat all year round and that obviously

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.160 
fat all year round and that obviously
leads<00:02:51.280> to<00:02:51.550> massive<00:02:51.970> problems<00:02:52.420> once<00:02:53.020> you've

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
leads to massive problems once you've

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:54.630 
leads to massive problems once you've
identified<00:02:53.260> the<00:02:53.800> problem<00:02:54.220> and<00:02:54.310> we<00:02:54.430> know

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
identified the problem and we know

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.190 
identified the problem and we know
further<00:02:55.000> action<00:02:55.360> has<00:02:55.450> got<00:02:55.570> to<00:02:55.660> be<00:02:55.750> taken

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
further action has got to be taken

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.650 
further action has got to be taken
we<00:02:56.650> will<00:02:56.800> then<00:02:56.980> try<00:02:57.790> and<00:02:57.970> knock<00:02:58.480> on<00:02:58.510> doors

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
we will then try and knock on doors

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:02.610 
we will then try and knock on doors
locally<00:02:59.350> farms<00:02:59.980> local<00:03:00.880> houses<00:03:01.350> try<00:03:02.350> and<00:03:02.470> find
