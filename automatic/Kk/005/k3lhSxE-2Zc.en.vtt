00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:07.770
 Hey, people, beauty. 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:11.790
 I'm reading silva and recently I've done 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:15.719
 a photograph on the street and soon as I 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:18.539
 I posted on youtube on facebook some 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.820
 people kept asking me what 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.410
 I had made to do that 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.480
 photography 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:28.920
 I had also said that I had recorded 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:32.160
 a video and some people is f 1 ever 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.440
 see this video is precisely why 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.760
 I'm recording this half hour to do 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.950
 this presentation 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.379
 and to show some people too 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.510
 who told me that I had not done 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.120
 that photograph I had taken 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.890
 Internet 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:49.860
 But I wanted to tell people who 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.050
 yes you can take it beautiful 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.870
 photos not only of the moon but also 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.980
 from the sunrise, only many 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.039
 other things 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.370
 when you have a lens like that that 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.750
 It was exactly what I used to do. 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:10.850
 the photograph 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:14.330
 she is a 55 all 250 of the canon of the canon 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:16.680
 and I have it, just have talent for 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:20.670
 because she was allowing me to give a 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:23.250
 very long zoom focus 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:27.180
 You can see that she does this. 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:29.220
 movement is precisely this here already the 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.970
 zoom and that's it guys I use a lot 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:37.290
 this lens because it allows me to bring 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:39.420
 It's close to a lens to dismantle. 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:46.110
 lets bring something close 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:50.939
 meters the same kilometers from 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:53.189
 distance then she brings some I can 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:55.710
 go a very good distance and without 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:58.320
 lose quality and it has stabilizer 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.509
 image is very important and I go 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.909
 be showing I'm talking and you 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:05.850
 can see this video that in some 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:08.840
 moments is because it is a 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.840
 very close proximity 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:18.129
 Let's go like this is any movement of 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:20.980
 effect or anything that allows you 

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:24.040
 balance a little is for less than the 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:26.079
 camera you will notice that it rocks 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:30.120
 a little to right top to give it to one side 

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:33.549
 to the other and this was it is due to 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:39.250
 her absence that is very close and I 

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:41.379
 I used the record for him to balance - 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:45.790
 for whom this time of birth 

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:48.700
 I made two leagues picture made one with the 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:53.560
 slow temperature is slightly hot and is 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:57.040
 the one you are seeing now and made the 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:03:01.209
 filming that has already been with a 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:04.150
 temperate color temperature of the lens is 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:06.069
 a little colder than the one you 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:12.900
 You're seeing now that you can see more. 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:12.900
 clear details some details of the moon 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:22.299
 you can observe that with the 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:23.799
 cold or programmed temperature 

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:28.209
 cold 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:30.310
 it allows you to view the moon with a 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:32.739
 little more detail than she with the 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:36.220
 hot color 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:39.000
 I'll do a review of a comparison 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:39.000
 between the two 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:50.370
 and that's it guys so you should 

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:54.940
 wondering is it possible to do 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:59.740
 photographs of the moon or the sun 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:04:02.740
 I have a mind, it's how it's possible. 

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:04.180
 I've seen it and sometimes it's not that I do not 

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:08.580
 It's cool, but I played it a few times. 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:13.840
 people use is is a planet 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:17.560
 to take pictures and I've also seen 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:19.750
 people use a type of magnifying glass not 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:22.930
 these helps that we use to see 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:25.380
 a way better thing of the type but it is 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:28.330
 a type of fight specific to 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:32.170
 Photography 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:33.520
 quality but it 's possible to have some photos 

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:35.560
 cool 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:40.090
 So these guys if you liked the 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:41.560
 quality of the image or video is to 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:44.070
 11 j 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:49.270
 there that will help quite place the channel 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:50.880
 and disclose is share click liked 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:53.530
 if I liked 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:56.650
 add favorites this helps 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:58.120
 much the channel that I have on youtube 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:59.920
 I'll leave the link in the description of the 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:03.940
 video for anyone who wants to buy weapons 

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:07.300
 this or for those who want to also name 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:09.910
 additional on the channel on youtube is the link 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:19.440
 is in the description of the video should appear 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:19.440
 in the corner of the hug to everyone
