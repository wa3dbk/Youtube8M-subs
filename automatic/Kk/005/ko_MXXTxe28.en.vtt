gigabytes<00:00:35.340> of<00:00:35.430> RAM<00:00:35.700> this<00:00:36.180> is<00:00:36.329> one<00:00:36.780> of<00:00:36.809> the

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
gigabytes of RAM this is one of the

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.690 
gigabytes of RAM this is one of the
things<00:00:37.140> that<00:00:37.230> sets<00:00:37.500> it<00:00:37.590> apart<00:00:37.680> from<00:00:38.010> a<00:00:38.550> lot<00:00:38.579> of

the other devices is that it has two
gigabytes<00:00:40.680> of<00:00:40.800> RAM<00:00:41.100> which<00:00:41.640> means<00:00:41.850> that<00:00:41.879> you

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
gigabytes of RAM which means that you

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.369 
gigabytes of RAM which means that you
can<00:00:42.059> do<00:00:42.210> a<00:00:42.239> lot<00:00:42.390> of<00:00:42.420> multitasking<00:00:42.660> if<00:00:43.170> we<00:00:43.260> go

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.430 
there I'm gonna do looking I'm actually
cleared<00:00:48.450> my<00:00:48.539> memory<00:00:48.809> recently<00:00:49.140> but<00:00:49.230> you<00:00:49.320> can

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
cleared my memory recently but you can

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.869 
cleared my memory recently but you can
do<00:00:49.500> a<00:00:49.559> lot<00:00:49.770> of<00:00:49.800> multitasking<00:00:50.100> obviously<00:00:50.760> right

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
do a lot of multitasking obviously right

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.310 
do a lot of multitasking obviously right
here<00:00:51.000> I<00:00:51.030> just<00:00:51.210> started<00:00:51.390> at<00:00:51.510> my<00:00:51.570> phone<00:00:51.809> they

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
here I just started at my phone they

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.229 
here I just started at my phone they
don't<00:00:52.440> have<00:00:52.500> many<00:00:52.649> tasks<00:00:52.920> open<00:00:53.399> but<00:00:54.000> it<00:00:54.120> has

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
don't have many tasks open but it has

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:55.760 
don't have many tasks open but it has
two<00:00:54.510> GU<00:00:54.690> bytes<00:00:54.870> of<00:00:54.960> RAM<00:00:55.170> so<00:00:55.320> you<00:00:55.410> can<00:00:55.530> store<00:00:55.710> a

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
two GU bytes of RAM so you can store a

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.950 
two GU bytes of RAM so you can store a
lot<00:00:56.129> of<00:00:56.280> processes<00:00:57.210> in<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.390> background<00:00:57.870> which

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
lot of processes in the background which

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.510 
lot of processes in the background which
is<00:00:58.079> really<00:00:58.260> really<00:00:58.350> cool<00:00:58.559> for<00:00:58.710> multitasking<00:00:59.010> I

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
is really really cool for multitasking I

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.670 
is really really cool for multitasking I
flipped<00:01:00.300> back<00:01:00.449> to<00:01:00.600> apps<00:01:00.780> from<00:01:00.930> a<00:01:00.989> day<00:01:01.170> ago<00:01:01.320> and

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
flipped back to apps from a day ago and

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.709 
flipped back to apps from a day ago and
had<00:01:01.770> no<00:01:01.949> trouble<00:01:02.309> reloading<00:01:02.730> them<00:01:02.820> they<00:01:03.570> don't

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
had no trouble reloading them they don't

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.359 
had no trouble reloading them they don't
have<00:01:03.840> to<00:01:03.930> refresh<00:01:04.320> their<00:01:04.559> physically<00:01:04.949> inside

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
have to refresh their physically inside

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.250 
have to refresh their physically inside
the<00:01:05.519> memory<00:01:05.790> so<00:01:05.909> you<00:01:06.000> just<00:01:06.150> tap<00:01:06.420> them<00:01:06.600> and<00:01:06.780> it's

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
the memory so you just tap them and it's

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.719 
the memory so you just tap them and it's
to<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.439> exact<00:01:07.830> point<00:01:08.040> that<00:01:08.189> you<00:01:08.280> left<00:01:08.430> it<00:01:08.580> two

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729

days ago really really handy also about

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.250 
days ago really really handy also about
the<00:01:11.310> devices<00:01:11.700> it's<00:01:11.820> so<00:01:11.909> customizable<00:01:12.360> is<00:01:13.140> he

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
the devices it's so customizable is he

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.750 
the devices it's so customizable is he
right<00:01:13.409> here<00:01:13.439> I've<00:01:13.619> got<00:01:13.650> a<00:01:13.799> nova<00:01:14.610> launcher

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
right here I've got a nova launcher

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.090 
right here I've got a nova launcher
which<00:01:15.180> is<00:01:15.330> one<00:01:15.509> of<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.659> launchers<00:01:16.080> that<00:01:16.650> is

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
which is one of the launchers that is

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.560 
which is one of the launchers that is
available<00:01:17.340> from<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:17.939> app<00:01:18.030> store<00:01:18.060> but<00:01:18.479> it's

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
available from the app store but it's

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.300

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
live backgrounds I think that's the

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.110 
live backgrounds I think that's the
neatest<00:02:20.080> thing<00:02:20.350> it<00:02:20.470> has<00:02:20.650> over<00:02:20.890> the<00:02:21.100> iOS<00:02:21.490> that

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
neatest thing it has over the iOS that

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.820

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
you get live backgrounds and normally

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:25.410 
you get live backgrounds and normally
they<00:02:23.950> really<00:02:24.190> eat<00:02:24.220> your<00:02:24.460> battery<00:02:24.790> and<00:02:24.970> this

by<00:03:36.100> Apple's<00:03:36.459> so<00:03:36.670> they're<00:03:37.240> a<00:03:37.270> little<00:03:37.450> behind

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
by Apple's so they're a little behind

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.510

the times they're down a little bit so I

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.130

think that's why the updates are getting
pushed<00:03:41.410> back<00:03:41.590> and<00:03:41.830> back<00:03:42.010> because<00:03:42.550> they're<00:03:42.700> so

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:42.880 
pushed back and back because they're so

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:44.010
