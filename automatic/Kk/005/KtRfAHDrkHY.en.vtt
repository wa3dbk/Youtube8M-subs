00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:41.430
 dryer power when the dryer has 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:43.260
 less than 1,600 power it will only dry 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.230

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:05.400

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.960
 make pointed tips and pepe such then 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.470
 are you going to buy the dryer you have 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:14.010
 above 1600 and preferably the dryer 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:28.590
 which is above 600 and which also has 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:31.890
 the best beds give brighter then 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:45.420
 when you pain you will observe the 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:49.320
 dryer power above 1600 is the 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:54.450
 be the power of being switched on during 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:02:04.950

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.229
 of mexico it dies is true 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:13.720
 Worth waiting for a little rest. 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.670

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.130

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:21.340
 I have 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.500
 the ideal is a dryer that has a motor 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.420
 be the professional engine 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.940

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.570
 something else I'm going to tell you 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:37.180
 What checks our hair is not the source. 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:39.490
 heat is the wind so if the dryer 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:42.490
 has a fairly large area concentration 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:45.190
 Great you'll get much faster. 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:47.860

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.570
