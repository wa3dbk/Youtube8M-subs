00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:09.540
 today we talk about how to enter 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.889
 in a modeling agency as far as I am 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.320
 concerns as I said in the first 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:16.049
 tutorial I did a course then finished 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.000
 this course I went directly to 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.820
 being part of the agency because they are me 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.630
 they considered fit to work like 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.180
 model 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.359
 but if you can't do this course 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:30.720
 or at least you don't have a chance to 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:32.700
 have an agency in the city where you are 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.390
 then I advise you to go on 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:40.469
 internet will be a fashion agency search and 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:42.239
 put milano bologna rome florence la 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.219
 city closer to your home 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:47.719
 normally there de facto internet sites 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:50.390
 it says what they ask 

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:52.710
 very often though they are photos of their own 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.680
 simple in the photo made with one 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:59.340
 normal camera with 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:03.449
 a white background or anyway neutral you 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:06.600
 with hair as well as I normal 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:09.470
 not daily without make-up without lipstick 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.960
 without mascara with a normal expression 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:14.990
 quiet relaxed but get in on 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:19.610
 pause type things like this or so or with it 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:21.830
 look yes no fishes so clean instead 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:24.700
 you have an opportunity to go there to 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:27.800
 show directly in the agency 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:30.980
 provided that these users do 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:32.770
 times to be able to visit it and it is 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:36.230
 normally written on the website 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:38.990
 I advise you if you have already done some 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:42.800
 professional or semi-professional photos 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:48.170
 which means studio photo photos with 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:50.210
 flashes with a lot of styled with a 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:53.530
 special makeup not davis types 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:56.750
 details with things if you have them 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.100
 but bring them not only those 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.770
 also take your own photos 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.690
 very simple they can give you two 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:07.640
 ways even if then very often 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:10.959
 they will themselves lose you don't hear 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:14.510
 never to an agency on your height 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:19.040
 because so much they will come to measure and 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:24.800
 then also because very often they are 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:28.610
 interested in you as you are everything ie 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:30.960
 you don't have to be m 78 to force you can 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:33.180
 also be a meter and 70 71 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:36.870
 but maybe you are such a special guy 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:40.010
 that they like so much to work in 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:43.050
 fashion is also a bit on the part of agents 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:46.850
 follow the fashions on the types that go 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:49.470
 in fact, notice the top models 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:52.040
 understands berna we can 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:55.440
 all the girls seem to be born 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:57.990
 beautiful the sun and then there was all 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.490
 another phase instead the whole model is 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:03.420
 the opposite 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:06.780
 a little anorexic a little special not 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:09.660
 extremely beautiful or with features 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:12.630
 angelic but if you have always been 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:16.770
 considered the beauty of the school but not 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:19.710
 it is said that if you have considered the 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:21.390
 beautiful of the moment in that context of 

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:24.210
 fashion and vice versa 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:27.540
 that is if you have always heard yourself 

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:32.700
 strange maybe others with a nice body but 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:35.880
 split I do n't know I like network or you feel 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:38.760
 particular different maybe just that 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:40.490
 point is your strength thing 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.440
 happens when you go to an agency 

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:47.250
 often they measure then measure 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:50.040
 take the cm velopass return less 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:54.510
 around the waist around flames and 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:57.800
 the size you need is the one 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:04:00.510
 perfect for a model is size 40 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:03.240
 38 also sometimes 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:05.660
 now these models are also going 

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:09.610
 precisely with 44 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:13.070
 6 if you try to work more fashion 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:18.070
 parades less than a certain height not 

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:20.780
 you can be less than 75, even 76 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:23.210
 instead there are many agencies that do 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:26.270
 only advertising or other work 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:28.760
 commercial advertising then below 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:31.180
 what you see on TV and the height 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:33.920
 it really doesn't count except in fact 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:36.230
 he only needs specific requests 

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:37.310
 the face ie you have the face that a 

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:39.650
 they like it 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:40.610
 you have something more than you are more than 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:42.460
 others 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:47.030
 in your smile in yours 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:49.670
 expression and then make sense then today 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:52.370
 I told you how to try to get into 

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:56.000
 an agency because it is important to find 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:58.700
 an agency because they are the only ones 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.630
 can be a link between you and 

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:02.780
 a casting 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:05.840
 be more protected because they can 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:09.800
 help you in your career in the jobs in 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:13.990
 choices and simply because it works 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:13.990
 so then hi to all
