00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:32.920 
with the axle of the truck poke through

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.889 
with the axle of the truck poke through
the<00:01:33.189> holes<00:01:33.399> where<00:01:34.000> the<00:01:34.149> screws<00:01:34.420> are<00:01:34.630> going<00:01:34.659> to

00:01:34.889 --> 00:01:34.899 
the holes where the screws are going to

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:38.999 
the holes where the screws are going to
go<00:01:35.549> this<00:01:36.549> creates<00:01:37.000> a<00:01:37.630> place<00:01:38.409> for<00:01:38.649> the<00:01:38.740> screws

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:39.009 
go this creates a place for the screws

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:41.459 
go this creates a place for the screws
to<00:01:39.219> go<00:01:39.369> so<00:01:39.759> if<00:01:40.090> you<00:01:40.240> want<00:01:40.479> to<00:01:40.630> switch<00:01:41.319> out

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 
duplicate this eight times for the eight

00:01:52.880 --> 00:02:07.449 
duplicate this eight times for the eight
different<00:01:53.270> holes<00:01:53.450> on<00:01:53.720> the<00:01:53.930> fingerboard

00:02:07.449 --> 00:02:07.459 

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:09.710 

once<00:02:08.459> finished<00:02:08.729> it<00:02:09.090> should<00:02:09.209> look<00:02:09.270> something

you previously screwed in and screw in
again<00:03:12.120> this<00:03:13.120> just<00:03:13.360> makes<00:03:13.630> the<00:03:13.840> bond<00:03:14.020> between

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
again this just makes the bond between

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:15.840 
again this just makes the bond between
the<00:03:14.500> truck<00:03:14.740> and<00:03:14.770> the<00:03:15.040> screw<00:03:15.310> and<00:03:15.550> that<00:03:15.580> much

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:15.850 
the truck and the screw and that much

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:22.410 
the truck and the screw and that much
stronger<00:03:20.460> now<00:03:21.460> all<00:03:21.670> you<00:03:21.790> need<00:03:21.940> to<00:03:22.030> do<00:03:22.180> is

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
stronger now all you need to do is

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.740 
stronger now all you need to do is
repeat<00:03:22.780> this<00:03:22.960> with<00:03:23.140> the<00:03:23.200> other<00:03:23.470> side<00:03:23.770> and

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
repeat this with the other side and

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.320 
repeat this with the other side and
screw<00:03:25.750> in<00:03:25.990> the<00:03:26.170> other<00:03:26.290> three<00:03:26.680> screws<00:03:27.430> you<00:03:28.150> also

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:28.330 
screw in the other three screws you also

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:30.180 
screw in the other three screws you also
may<00:03:28.630> notice<00:03:28.990> that<00:03:29.020> your<00:03:29.410> hanger<00:03:29.830> on<00:03:30.040> your
