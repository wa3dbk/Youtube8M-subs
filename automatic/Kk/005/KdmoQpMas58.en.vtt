00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.420 
get luck is it in a BPL team extremely
easily<00:03:08.450> and<00:03:08.930> I<00:03:09.170> yeah<00:03:09.500> but<00:03:09.710> another<00:03:10.190> thing

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
easily and I yeah but another thing

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:11.890 
easily and I yeah but another thing
about<00:03:10.580> in<00:03:10.790> this<00:03:10.880> is<00:03:11.060> positioning<00:03:11.600> you<00:03:11.690> know<00:03:11.780> he

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
about in this is positioning you know he

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.540 
about in this is positioning you know he
always<00:03:12.110> seems<00:03:12.410> to<00:03:12.500> be<00:03:12.770> in<00:03:13.040> a<00:03:13.130> position<00:03:13.280> to

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:13.550 
always seems to be in a position to

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:16.060 
always seems to be in a position to
score<00:03:13.760> which<00:03:14.360> is<00:03:14.480> obviously<00:03:14.930> a<00:03:15.050> massive<00:03:15.740> bonus

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:16.070 
score which is obviously a massive bonus

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:17.440 
score which is obviously a massive bonus
and<00:03:16.250> obviously<00:03:16.550> the<00:03:16.730> full<00:03:16.940> star<00:03:17.180> skill

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
and obviously the full star skill

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:19.720 
and obviously the full star skill
there's<00:03:17.870> also<00:03:18.170> very<00:03:18.500> similar<00:03:18.860> to<00:03:18.890> a<00:03:19.040> grown<00:03:19.370> so

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
there's also very similar to a grown so

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:21.040 
there's also very similar to a grown so
the<00:03:19.850> fact<00:03:20.060> that<00:03:20.120> he's<00:03:20.300> just<00:03:20.330> got<00:03:20.690> the<00:03:20.810> skill

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:21.050 
the fact that he's just got the skill

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:22.570 
the fact that he's just got the skill
but<00:03:21.200> look<00:03:21.380> at<00:03:21.530> this<00:03:21.650> this<00:03:22.220> is<00:03:22.370> pretty<00:03:22.460> much

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:22.580 
but look at this this is pretty much

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:24.070 
but look at this this is pretty much
what<00:03:22.700> you<00:03:22.910> expect<00:03:23.270> from<00:03:23.330> a<00:03:23.660> player<00:03:23.870> who's

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:24.080
