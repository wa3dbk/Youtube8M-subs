bit of extra cheese in here because I
like<00:02:55.010> cheese<00:02:55.280> and<00:03:00.790> we're<00:03:01.790> going<00:03:02.000> to<00:03:02.120> place<00:03:02.360> the

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:02.570 
like cheese and we're going to place the

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:16.240 
like cheese and we're going to place the
top<00:03:02.750> on<00:03:03.020> here<00:03:12.670> and<00:03:13.990> the<00:03:14.990> way<00:03:15.200> you<00:03:15.260> do<00:03:15.650> this<00:03:15.920> is

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
top on here and the way you do this is

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:19.510 
top on here and the way you do this is
I'm<00:03:16.580> going<00:03:16.610> to<00:03:16.970> flip<00:03:17.390> this<00:03:17.690> on<00:03:18.100> crank<00:03:19.100> it<00:03:19.220> up<00:03:19.280> to

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:19.520 
I'm going to flip this on crank it up to

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:23.020 
I'm going to flip this on crank it up to
ten<00:03:19.820> then<00:03:20.300> turn<00:03:20.630> it<00:03:20.810> on<00:03:20.989> high<00:03:21.320> and<00:03:21.709> I<00:03:22.280> think<00:03:22.610> you

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
ten then turn it on high and I think you

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.690 
ten then turn it on high and I think you
let<00:03:23.239> it<00:03:23.360> blend<00:03:23.600> for<00:03:23.989> six<00:03:24.290> minutes<00:03:24.770> and<00:03:24.980> the

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700 
let it blend for six minutes and the

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.180 
let it blend for six minutes and the
blades<00:03:26.090> spin<00:03:26.600> fast<00:03:26.959> enough<00:03:27.170> that<00:03:27.410> is<00:03:27.709> also

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.190 
blades spin fast enough that is also

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:30.310 
blades spin fast enough that is also
going<00:03:28.459> to<00:03:28.580> heat<00:03:29.060> up<00:03:29.209> the<00:03:29.540> soup<00:03:29.780> at<00:03:29.930> the<00:03:30.080> same

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:30.320 
going to heat up the soup at the same

00:03:30.320 --> 00:04:00.000 
going to heat up the soup at the same
time<00:03:30.680> so<00:03:31.580> here<00:03:31.940> we<00:03:32.030> go

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.010 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:02.560 

so<00:04:01.010> like<00:04:01.220> I<00:04:01.340> said<00:04:01.550> it<00:04:01.700> steam<00:04:01.970> coming<00:04:02.420> out<00:04:02.510> the

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:02.570 
so like I said it steam coming out the

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:05.440 
so like I said it steam coming out the
top<00:04:02.870> from<00:04:03.320> blending<00:04:03.740> it<00:04:03.890> I<00:04:04.130> have<00:04:04.640> a<00:04:04.940> little<00:04:05.300> bit

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:05.450 
top from blending it I have a little bit
