00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
 the land deals down the mountain to 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.620
 show how the banana harvest is 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.910
 on the coast near the border with 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.340
 Santa Catarina 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.150
 in the region the activity employs many 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.130
 families 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:18.410
 producers have already invented a 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:21.570
 a very particular way of harvesting 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:23.670
 in the region of Cubatão in the 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.789
 guaratuba has 3 thousand hectares of 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.250
 banana plantations is the fruit harvested the 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.140
 whole year 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:33.390
 Ninety per cent of production is family 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.980
 and farmers sometimes suffer from 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.230
 weather conditions 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.510
 fábio account that during the winter did 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.899
 It's very cold here in the Kacha season . 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:45.239
 she took a lot of cold rain and the 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:48.989
 of the cold weather is that it was his forte that 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.620
 gave and disturbed the quality of the 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.750
 fruit 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.930
 the banana is sold in parana and são 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:57.239
 paulo for 70 cents a pound the farm 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.879
 has an air-cable system powered by the 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:03.109
 strength of a mule so the curls do not 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.109
 break even the mass 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:14.290
 in the next lands a method is still the 

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:16.899
 traditional state reaps 270 thousand 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:19.750
 tonnes per year and occupies the second 

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:22.390
 place in the country in productivity beyond 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.259
 fertilization and soil control. 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.420
 diseases 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:27.430
 producers invest other 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.830
 so that the plants produce a cluster 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:32.619
 per year almost the entire process is manual 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:34.210
 with one person working in five 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:36.250
 hectares of property 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:38.560
 culture is the one that uses the most labor 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.520
 in Brazil, generating 500 thousand jobs 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.090
 rural 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:45.310
 I believed also practice already 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.080
 local agronomist works with an eye on 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.670
 pests that attack the leaves 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.520
 she says the region is just 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:53.200
 our entire production area 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.729
 here inside guaratuba she is 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.750
 inserted within the protection area 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:57.909
 environmental 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.409
 then all the management techniques that the 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:01.810
 people use they have to be 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:03.909
 accordance with the management plan of the 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.560
 application of agrotoxic 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:07.690
 people do she has to be based on 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.239
 monitoring we can only apply 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:13.379
 when the levels of 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:13.379
 such high damages 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:25.650
 and how we saw the worker there 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.650
 The rural field is hard on the field
