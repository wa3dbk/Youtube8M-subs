00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:48.940 
always focus are probably train you like
in<00:01:47.450> mypos<00:01:47.749> first<00:01:47.990> whatever<00:01:48.350> you<00:01:48.560> train<00:01:48.740> first

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
in mypos first whatever you train first

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:50.559 
in mypos first whatever you train first
gonna<00:01:49.159> take<00:01:49.340> the<00:01:49.490> most<00:01:49.639> of<00:01:49.789> your<00:01:49.969> energy<00:01:50.090> and

00:01:50.559 --> 00:01:50.569 
gonna take the most of your energy and

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:52.690 
gonna take the most of your energy and
then<00:01:50.719> the<00:01:51.319> next<00:01:51.619> one<00:01:51.740> and<00:01:52.069> the<00:01:52.130> next<00:01:52.159> one<00:01:52.399> and

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
then the next one and the next one and

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.279 
then the next one and the next one and
then<00:01:52.759> whatever<00:01:52.999> you<00:01:53.210> end<00:01:53.240> up<00:01:53.420> doing<00:01:53.479> last<00:01:53.899> is

00:01:54.279 --> 00:01:54.289 
then whatever you end up doing last is

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:58.239 
then whatever you end up doing last is
gonna<00:01:54.530> get<00:01:55.009> the<00:01:55.159> most<00:01:55.460> out<00:01:55.729> of<00:01:55.759> it<00:01:55.999> and<00:01:56.859> so<00:01:57.859> at

00:01:58.239 --> 00:01:58.249 
gonna get the most out of it and so at

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:59.349 
gonna get the most out of it and so at
the<00:01:58.340> end<00:01:58.460> of<00:01:58.520> the<00:01:58.579> day<00:01:58.670> your<00:01:58.850> body<00:01:58.939> parts<00:01:59.240> gonna

00:01:59.349 --> 00:01:59.359 
the end of the day your body parts gonna

00:01:59.359 --> 00:02:01.539 
the end of the day your body parts gonna
suffer<00:01:59.719> like<00:01:59.810> I<00:01:59.929> said<00:02:00.109> for<00:02:00.829> example<00:02:00.889> at<00:02:01.340> one

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:01.549 
suffer like I said for example at one

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:03.819 
suffer like I said for example at one
point<00:02:01.729> I<00:02:02.030> would<00:02:02.569> do<00:02:02.749> my<00:02:02.869> chest<00:02:03.109> last<00:02:03.439> cuz<00:02:03.709> it

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:03.829 
point I would do my chest last cuz it

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:05.319 
point I would do my chest last cuz it
was<00:02:03.950> my<00:02:04.100> most<00:02:04.340> dominant<00:02:04.700> by<00:02:04.819> the<00:02:04.880> port<00:02:05.149> back

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:05.329 
was my most dominant by the port back

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:07.120 
was my most dominant by the port back
then<00:02:05.569> but<00:02:05.959> now<00:02:06.139> if<00:02:06.229> you<00:02:06.319> guys<00:02:06.439> noticed<00:02:06.889> my

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
then but now if you guys noticed my

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.279 
then but now if you guys noticed my
chest<00:02:07.399> is<00:02:07.490> actually<00:02:07.909> lagging<00:02:08.330> now<00:02:08.479> enough<00:02:09.200> to

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 
chest is actually lagging now enough to

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:11.260 
chest is actually lagging now enough to
show<00:02:09.440> you<00:02:09.500> that<00:02:09.770> the<00:02:10.190> priority<00:02:10.670> principle<00:02:11.150> is

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 
show you that the priority principle is

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:12.340 
show you that the priority principle is
really<00:02:11.569> really<00:02:11.780> important

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
really really important

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.590 
really really important
but<00:02:12.709> you<00:02:12.800> train<00:02:13.040> last<00:02:13.310> you<00:02:14.270> know<00:02:14.420> in<00:02:14.510> the

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
but you train last you know in the

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.660 
but you train last you know in the
workout<00:02:14.930> will<00:02:15.530> not<00:02:15.709> have<00:02:15.830> the<00:02:15.980> same<00:02:16.130> results

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
workout will not have the same results

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:18.130 
workout will not have the same results
as<00:02:16.819> the<00:02:17.060> ones<00:02:17.240> that<00:02:17.270> you<00:02:17.360> trained<00:02:17.630> first<00:02:17.870> and

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
as the ones that you trained first and

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.620 
as the ones that you trained first and
the<00:02:19.040> problem<00:02:19.340> with<00:02:19.459> that<00:02:19.550> is<00:02:19.790> some<00:02:20.240> sort<00:02:20.390> of

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
the problem with that is some sort of

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:21.970 
the problem with that is some sort of
alternate<00:02:21.050> like<00:02:21.200> I<00:02:21.290> start<00:02:21.620> off<00:02:21.709> with<00:02:21.860> like<00:02:21.920> a

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
alternate like I start off with like a

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.370 
alternate like I start off with like a
like<00:02:22.700> a<00:02:22.730> lagging<00:02:23.120> body<00:02:23.420> part<00:02:23.750> on<00:02:23.840> one<00:02:24.080> full

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
like a lagging body part on one full

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:27.309 
like a lagging body part on one full
body<00:02:24.530> workout<00:02:24.830> dated<00:02:25.189> next<00:02:25.760> day<00:02:25.879> of<00:02:26.000> rc4<00:02:26.659> then

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319 
body workout dated next day of rc4 then

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:29.649 
body workout dated next day of rc4 then
but<00:02:28.310> then<00:02:28.430> if<00:02:28.670> I<00:02:28.819> stop<00:02:29.030> your<00:02:29.360> progressive

00:02:29.649 --> 00:02:29.659 
but then if I stop your progressive

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:30.470 
but then if I stop your progressive
overload

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
overload

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.050 
overload
meaning<00:02:30.900> if<00:02:31.200> you're<00:02:31.349> trying<00:02:31.530> to<00:02:31.590> beat<00:02:31.800> one<00:02:32.760> set

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
meaning if you're trying to beat one set

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.640 
meaning if you're trying to beat one set
of<00:02:33.239> ten<00:02:33.480> reps<00:02:33.720> with<00:02:33.870> a<00:02:33.930> certain<00:02:34.230> weight<00:02:34.379> and

of ten reps with a certain weight and

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.860 
of ten reps with a certain weight and
you<00:02:35.069> train<00:02:35.310> that<00:02:35.340> when<00:02:36.000> you<00:02:36.090> fresh<00:02:36.420> and<00:02:36.450> strong

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
you train that when you fresh and strong

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.690 
you train that when you fresh and strong
well<00:02:37.290> in<00:02:37.410> the<00:02:37.500> data<00:02:37.680> you<00:02:37.739> try<00:02:38.010> not<00:02:38.190> that<00:02:38.519> body

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
well in the data you try not that body

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.089 
well in the data you try not that body
part<00:02:38.970> last<00:02:39.440> your<00:02:40.440> energy<00:02:40.769> levels<00:02:41.069> a

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:41.099 
part last your energy levels a

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:42.890 
part last your energy levels a
difference<00:02:41.519> so<00:02:41.640> it<00:02:41.790> kind<00:02:42.390> of<00:02:42.690> up<00:02:42.810> the

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
difference so it kind of up the

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.270 
difference so it kind of up the
stats<00:02:43.170> that's<00:02:43.560> why<00:02:43.680> I<00:02:43.709> sort<00:02:43.890> of<00:02:43.950> alternate

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
stats that's why I sort of alternate

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.460 
stats that's why I sort of alternate
between<00:02:44.370> full-body<00:02:44.849> workouts<00:02:45.209> and<00:02:45.510> splits

between full-body workouts and splits

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.440 
between full-body workouts and splits
another<00:02:47.250> reason<00:02:47.519> why<00:02:47.610> you<00:02:47.849> can't<00:02:48.150> do<00:02:48.269> full

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
another reason why you can't do full

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:49.820 
another reason why you can't do full
body<00:02:48.480> workouts<00:02:48.900> come<00:02:49.140> you<00:02:49.349> know<00:02:49.470> all<00:02:49.650> year

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
being burnt out is the fact that

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.870 
being burnt out is the fact that
