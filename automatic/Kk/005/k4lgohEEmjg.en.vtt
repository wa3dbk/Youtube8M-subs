00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.220
 hello everyone peter hour or grandma 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.130
 teenage girl with a new commentary today 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.320
 today is day 26 of my august 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:13.650
 marathon and today I have another 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.509
 oldskool p90 joke for you 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.980
 I had a P90 new for a while 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.699
 used and and frankly became one 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.980
 little dusty 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.869
 I was even thinking about the class 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.730
 to remove from that anyway 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.529
 not used anymore but 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.090
 I finally decided to do the 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.500
 not to do it anyway because the one is 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.380
 weapon is what i used a lot 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.969
 in my call of duty mw3 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.829
 playing time and I thought it was a bit 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.730
 thankless to him so just at once 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.649
 to delete 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.090
 so I didn't do that either 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.040
 just used it again and 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.500
 three times I immediately recommend it 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.059
 what with it is a breeding ground so he is 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.430
 pretty fast him on whatever not so 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.899
 is quite surprising when you play so botlek 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.910
 maybe even special if you 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.530
 get a slow matte white on bootleg 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.850
 through all the bullshit that will make you die quickly 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.140
 can go 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.969
 but at least he is so reasonable 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.410
 fast so I need a quick subject 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.289
 because I wanted it today 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.820
 you have over in maps in call 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.189
 of duty in general and that is 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.960
 actually a bit of a connection 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.150
 why I personally do not have an opinion yet 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.280
 have given about call of duty ghosts man 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.659
 too many people already have an opinion there 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.299
 about data about call of duty ghosts 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.500
 without having played it 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.020
 and then I think it's pretty handsome 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.479
 then I still have a long one and then one 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.700
 and then ask yourself how you do that 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.710
 I personally think it is like that or 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.570
 A call duty is good or not hang 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.590
 hardly get rid of the weapons of the 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.299
 people who play it 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.049
 that all remains in principle 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.040
 the same thing your weapons will all know 

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:36.479
 unbelievably fast in relation to 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.610
 other games like this compares with 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.220
 battlefield the recoil 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.600
 I mean recoil by that 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.729
 it's pretty much the same 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.740
 we have treyarch about it once 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.509
 generally slightly more risk real 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.890
 mono mar free games or infiniti war 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.200
 I have to say games 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.240
 but that remains to be one it remains 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.070
 practically the same and therefore 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.079
 I personally also think that you are there 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.490
 not to hurt your opinion 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:01.140
 Also don't base your opinion on 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.210
 things like killstreaks and I know it 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.280
 all be clear also that this is a 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.489
 bit nonsense what in my opinion 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:11.190
 determines whether a game is going to be good 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:13.020
 actually purely and only the maps 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.300
 if you compare mono marver two wax 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.820
 a 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.770
 game had good maps, however, were one 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:19.270
 small adjustments needed to my 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:20.440
 view the and with two knife of this 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:22.960
 namely all a bit on the 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.310
 large side and therefore were sol gravel 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:25.960
 is doing reasonably well with 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.480
 except for the ub he claims that 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:31.150
 of the machines that just about anything 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.070
 for the rest, shopkins were dominant 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.450
 blackops and gold also the same maps 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:36.220
 were here again a piece of action 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.800
 fuller but still not that action-packed 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.690
 if that were the maps in mono marver 3 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.130
 boert leg is really a perfect one 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:44.950
 example 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:46.570
 You really need to get involved with this in any case 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.550
 the same applies to this with bootleg 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:50.500
 for mission the map is in itself 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:52.450
 as the crow flies if you look at it very much 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.070
 small it is a small square 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.410
 not as small as a variety as in mono 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:59.200
 marver two but the folder is still real 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:01.270
 extremely small but you still have this 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.430
 map almost never span and shows and that is 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:05.230
 so they really have something handsome 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.420
 well thought about how to put this folder in 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.310
 sat together and therefore because you are with 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.500
 so many people in such a small area 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.600
 the folder is very active and 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.590
 of course the same applies to maps as 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.270
 mission 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.040
 and that is why I also monitor the grief 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:19.959
 better game compared to black or 2 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.150
 black or two has everywhere and 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:24.280
 head glitch what in my opinion a 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.739
 bit snowy from the game 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:30.220
 how fast you can say and span can be flipped 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:31.420
 and how quickly everything goes smoothly 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:33.040
 I hope you think this too 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.660
 therefore I have no opinion 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.520
 to give up on call or duty black 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:37.780
 clean or from call or duty ghosts 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:39.459
 I actually say so 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.750
 just pure and just because I like the maps 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:42.640
 I haven't played yet and so have I 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:45.010
 actually not really one by one 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.450
 can give an opinion 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.160
 you liked this video please provide 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:49.989
 please a thumbs up thanks 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.260
 for the many ladies, really cool to wear 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:53.800
 see 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:55.480
 and yes leave a comment with you 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.100
 opinion I want then I am 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.270
 curious about actually i think 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:58.930
 personally the maps so it 

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:01.120
 main 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:02.170
 but if you find anything else late 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.720
 that the sure 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:06.730
 and then I would say until tomorrow at the 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:10.080
 next episode of my August 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:10.080
 marathon leaves the guests
