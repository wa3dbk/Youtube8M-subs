00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.080 
outside and dirtying five situation
right<00:01:01.020> now<00:01:01.079> so<00:01:01.559> he's<00:01:02.399> this<00:01:02.730> time<00:01:02.879> we<00:01:02.969> decided

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
right now so he's this time we decided

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.939 
right now so he's this time we decided
to<00:01:03.359> pass<00:01:03.570> when<00:01:03.780> men<00:01:03.899> to<00:01:04.199> man<00:01:04.409> we're<00:01:04.769> really

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
to pass when men to man we're really

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.440 
to pass when men to man we're really
close<00:01:05.250> this<00:01:05.519> time<00:01:05.729> he<00:01:05.880> threw<00:01:06.030> a<00:01:06.119> little<00:01:06.270> bit

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
close this time he threw a little bit

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.870 
close this time he threw a little bit
early<00:01:06.720> and<00:01:06.890> therefore<00:01:07.890> he<00:01:08.100> just<00:01:08.400> decides<00:01:08.729> to

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
early and therefore he just decides to

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.370 
early and therefore he just decides to
go<00:01:09.030> conservative<00:01:09.420> once<00:01:09.840> again<00:01:10.140> and<00:01:10.350> I

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380
