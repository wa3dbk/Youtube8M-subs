double benefit he can now use twice the

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.230 
double benefit he can now use twice the
amount<00:01:22.500> of<00:01:22.770> imagination<00:01:23.549> so<00:01:23.700> it<00:01:23.820> can<00:01:23.939> sort<00:01:24.119> of

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
amount of imagination so it can sort of

chapters<00:01:49.170> of<00:01:49.200> bleach<00:01:49.470> this<00:01:49.680> one<00:01:49.860> just<00:01:50.040> flew

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
chapters of bleach this one just flew

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.910 
chapters of bleach this one just flew
right<00:01:50.909> by<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.810> minute<00:01:52.110> I<00:01:52.200> started<00:01:52.560> reading<00:01:52.770> it

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
right by the minute I started reading it

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.710 
right by the minute I started reading it
it<00:01:53.070> seemed<00:01:53.280> like<00:01:53.460> it<00:01:53.610> was<00:01:53.759> done<00:01:53.909> however<00:01:54.390> what

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
it seemed like it was done however what

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.780 
it seemed like it was done however what
was<00:01:54.899> there<00:01:55.200> was<00:01:55.680> still<00:01:55.890> really<00:01:56.130> entertaining

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
was there was still really entertaining

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.999 
was there was still really entertaining
and<00:01:57.060> I<00:01:57.119> think<00:01:57.329> if<00:01:57.420> they<00:01:57.540> ever<00:01:57.719> decide<00:01:58.200> to<00:01:58.469> get

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
and I think if they ever decide to get

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.980 
and I think if they ever decide to get
back<00:01:59.219> to<00:01:59.369> an<00:01:59.490> anime<00:01:59.850> form<00:01:59.909> of<00:02:00.240> bleach<00:02:00.479> this<00:02:00.869> is

he might not even have to use them yet
this<00:02:18.239> could<00:02:18.360> be<00:02:18.480> just<00:02:18.510> another<00:02:18.959> big<00:02:19.230> tease

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470
