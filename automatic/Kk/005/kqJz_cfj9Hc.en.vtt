 Hachioji p mailer 

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:11.830

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:18.450
 Produce music with vocaloid in Japan 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:24.670
 It is idle afterward 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:27.360
 Other artists' music offerings produced by DJ 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:27.360
 How are you 

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:32.920
 At that time it was awkward so a 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:38.920
 The audience really 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:42.650
 I was very nervous because it was a performance in front of that many people 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:47.780
 There is in that well really in 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:49.820
 Also Toka towards the fans what it Toka or was arson Lloyd have me know that my 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:54.140
 You are very welcome 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:56.640
 That I was happy to there is was fun memory 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:59.280
 So this time too 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:02.960
 I can not open it to full open 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.960
 I think I could format it 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:11.370
 The last time was a little over at the World Expo 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:15.210
 The Well did not look better if the city say what either 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:20.570
 First of all, the usual touristic place 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:22.620
 That of the audience and the place that say I want to enjoy 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:25.190
 I think a little more 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:29.820
 I think it will change 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:33.260

 Anison or Vocaloid Game Music 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:52.630
 I think it will take a lot of work, so of course you are your own music 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:54.890
 Since vocaloid activity is active, vocaloid songs 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:59.890
 Besides that a 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:04.020
