00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:08.710
 because the chain switching to the video 

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:10.950
 instruction of bike workshops bruck 

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:13.570
 Help despite careful 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.020
 basic setting and adjustment not 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:18.250
 can be reasonably adjusted 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.610
 you should the following possible 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:22.740
 Check sources of error times and 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:26.289
 work off 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:29.740
 because when talking on the next 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:32.050
 minor puzzle the chain h can the 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:33.040
 move or the outer shell of the 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.460
 pay dirt 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:39.300
 the outer shell then say something 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:42.690
 flush out the internal pressure or clean 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:46.059
 renew both 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:49.390
 then you should also check if 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:53.230
 the circuit does not envelop itself in one 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:54.670
 To narrow radius in the frame pass 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:58.289
 that could also be a possible one 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:00.820
 source of error are different for that 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:04.629
 then it could be that the 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:10.259
 sound to tilt rocker lever jammed 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:14.910
 has in the rocker could the grid 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:17.860
 be glued or damaged 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:19.920
 then you should marie the rocker 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.990
 Rinse the beaters 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:27.030
 these possible sources of error 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.030
 also affect the difference 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:35.679
 then you should check if that 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:37.899
 Eye is not bent that can be on 

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:41.560
 best by a view from behind 

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:46.649
 If necessary , you have to check that eye 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.649
 then just bend or renew 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:55.140
 the switch could be hidden 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.039
 the circuit could scroll to 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.310
 have versatile game 

00:01:57.039 --> 00:02:03.520
 this should not be like 0.5 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:08.160
 be millimeter if it is more 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.160
 you exchange the circuit trolls 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:15.780
 all these possible sources of error can 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:19.290
 the switching characteristics at 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:22.080
 switch down and turn on 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:25.600
 influence 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:29.710
 a video tutorial and text instructions 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:30.780
 for a shimano and forced circuit 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:33.850
 adjust 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.610
 there is in the circuit workshop of 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:39.060
 bike workshop sprockhÃ¶vel 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:50.140
 I show them how to get there 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:52.080
 go to the page www.shopping.de has 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:03:01.330
 to call these 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:03:09.220
 If you go also tips workshop then goes 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:10.930
 for example mdb workshop then 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.030
 you can get the appropriate 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.700
 select factory gate 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:21.010
 in this case it is the circuit 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:23.500
 sweat shop design workshop is available 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:26.140
 then the text and video instructions like 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:30.300
 for example here the video shimano 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.300
 adjust the circuit
