 Thank you 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:39.900
 as you know this very night 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.900
 a couple of presidential candidates 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:46.190
 To fix 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:53.340
 however we are arranging this country 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:56.160
 to improve this country but to 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:59.790
 fix the whole world welcome to 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.949

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:04.019
 Gentlemen is usually a presenter 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.519
 gala always presented summer 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.930
 cinema three environments to embody plus 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.310
 but like the video game industry 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.990
 gave more money 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.369
 I thought about spending my mission 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.650
 as what I did not know is that this was 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.050
 so it 's possible that it's my last time 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.539
 they just named captain I'm the captain 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:21.000
 I was going to present a game 

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:23.830
 but now I'm going to be in charge of 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.960
 a mission and you are in my face 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:27.960
 so since it's my first day 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:33.360
 It's quiet 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:40.050
 of a bad news notification 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.980
 but the good news 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:45.900
 the news is that if you are here it is 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:48.330
 because a few days ago we sent you some 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.640
 coded codes are worth the redundancy 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:54.900
 for you flowers to code is 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:57.680
 true that you have managed to decode 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.680
 the message 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:15.050
 well yes yes sir then means 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.050

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.860
 I love 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:37.379
 but very well this afternoon has launched a 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:37.379
 missile of exactly 74 megatons 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:44.340
 millions of tons of dynamite and 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:44.340
 where will it fall 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:54.159
 57 million tons of dynamite not 

00:02:51.939 --> 00:02:56.819
 it's just going to destroy this it's going to destroy 

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:56.819
 more things 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.120
 to me 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:11.320
 we all have all have family 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:16.000
 i 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:16.000
 please do not subordinate 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:22.700
 it is happening now shortly 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:24.950
 you are going to see an image on this screen 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.140
 like this one 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:32.900
 these are the codes that you have to 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:35.830
 decipher for the air to be removed all 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.830
 the medicine that has 

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:15.190
 throughout Europe 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:15.190
 military and intelligence actions 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:24.550
 the chemists without eggs that do not 

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:24.550
 strength fall or dedazos 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:29.240
 all this is the fault of his greed 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.700
 it's like killing 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:39.030
 I do not think about it 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.979
 his previous life has disappeared 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:47.270
 we will fight to recover it 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:01.110
 and modern warfare 3 already available
