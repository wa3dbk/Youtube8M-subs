00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:11.130 

the<00:00:09.700> way<00:00:09.880> the<00:00:10.060> procedure<00:00:10.450> is<00:00:10.690> done<00:00:10.720> the

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:11.140 
the way the procedure is done the

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:14.110 
the way the procedure is done the
patient<00:00:11.350> is<00:00:11.830> brought<00:00:12.460> to<00:00:12.580> the<00:00:12.610> operating<00:00:13.060> room

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:14.120 
patient is brought to the operating room

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:16.450 
patient is brought to the operating room
they're<00:00:14.570> actually<00:00:15.080> awake<00:00:15.470> although<00:00:16.010> we<00:00:16.309> do

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:16.460 
they're actually awake although we do

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:18.700 
they're actually awake although we do
give<00:00:16.640> sedation<00:00:17.240> and<00:00:17.510> local<00:00:17.590> anesthetic<00:00:18.590> so

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:18.710 
give sedation and local anesthetic so

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:19.840 
give sedation and local anesthetic so
they're<00:00:18.830> very<00:00:18.860> comfortable<00:00:19.250> while<00:00:19.730> we're

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:19.850 
they're very comfortable while we're

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:22.030 
they're very comfortable while we're
doing<00:00:19.910> the<00:00:20.090> procedure<00:00:20.480> and<00:00:20.900> what<00:00:21.470> we<00:00:21.590> do<00:00:21.770> is<00:00:21.920> we

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:22.040 
doing the procedure and what we do is we

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.670 
doing the procedure and what we do is we
look<00:00:22.340> for<00:00:22.610> the<00:00:23.330> specific<00:00:23.510> landmarks<00:00:24.140> so<00:00:24.529> we

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:24.680 
look for the specific landmarks so we

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:27.280 
look for the specific landmarks so we
look<00:00:24.920> for<00:00:25.369> the<00:00:25.580> tail<00:00:25.790> bone<00:00:26.029> and<00:00:26.390> then<00:00:27.140> we

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:27.290 
look for the tail bone and then we

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:30.340 
look for the tail bone and then we
identify<00:00:28.029> the<00:00:29.029> bones<00:00:29.270> by<00:00:29.599> feeling<00:00:30.080> through

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:30.350 
identify the bones by feeling through

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:33.580 
identify the bones by feeling through
the<00:00:30.500> skin<00:00:30.830> and<00:00:31.190> then<00:00:32.000> once<00:00:32.599> we've<00:00:32.840> located<00:00:33.110> the

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:33.590 
the skin and then once we've located the

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:35.950 
the skin and then once we've located the
area<00:00:33.980> where<00:00:34.699> we<00:00:34.879> believe<00:00:35.210> the<00:00:35.720> appropriate

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:35.960 
area where we believe the appropriate

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.670 
area where we believe the appropriate
nerve<00:00:36.500> root<00:00:36.739> is<00:00:36.920> we<00:00:37.580> actually<00:00:37.940> take<00:00:38.120> a<00:00:38.180> small

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:38.680 
nerve root is we actually take a small

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.560 
nerve root is we actually take a small
electrical<00:00:39.680> conduction<00:00:40.040> needle<00:00:40.580> and<00:00:40.790> place

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:41.570 
electrical conduction needle and place

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:43.390 
electrical conduction needle and place
it<00:00:41.840> through<00:00:42.260> the<00:00:42.410> skin<00:00:42.769> that's<00:00:43.190> been

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:43.400 
it through the skin that's been

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.110 
it through the skin that's been
anesthetized<00:00:44.059> and<00:00:44.330> down<00:00:45.050> into<00:00:45.890> the<00:00:46.640> opening

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 
anesthetized and down into the opening

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.959 
anesthetized and down into the opening
in<00:00:47.239> the<00:00:47.360> bone<00:00:47.540> and<00:00:47.980> that<00:00:48.980> then<00:00:49.399> sits<00:00:49.760> down

00:00:49.959 --> 00:00:49.969 
in the bone and that then sits down

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:53.319 
in the bone and that then sits down
right<00:00:50.239> alongside<00:00:50.510> the<00:00:50.989> nerve<00:00:51.170> and<00:00:51.670> then<00:00:52.670> once

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:53.329 
right alongside the nerve and then once

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:56.549 
right alongside the nerve and then once
that's<00:00:53.510> in<00:00:53.809> place<00:00:53.840> we<00:00:54.620> test<00:00:55.010> it<00:00:55.280> electrically

00:00:56.549 --> 00:00:56.559 
that's in place we test it electrically

00:00:56.559 --> 00:00:59.049 
that's in place we test it electrically
and<00:00:57.559> we<00:00:57.680> take<00:00:57.890> some<00:00:58.070> x-ray<00:00:58.370> pictures<00:00:58.760> to<00:00:58.940> make

00:00:59.049 --> 00:00:59.059 
and we take some x-ray pictures to make

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:00.479 
and we take some x-ray pictures to make
sure<00:00:59.239> that<00:00:59.390> we're<00:00:59.539> in<00:00:59.660> the<00:00:59.750> right<00:00:59.780> position

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:00.489 
sure that we're in the right position

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:03.010 
sure that we're in the right position
once<00:01:01.489> we're<00:01:01.730> sure<00:01:01.760> that<00:01:02.300> we're<00:01:02.719> in<00:01:02.899> the

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:03.020 
once we're sure that we're in the

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.800 
once we're sure that we're in the
correct<00:01:03.379> placement<00:01:03.789> we<00:01:04.789> exchange<00:01:05.449> this

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810 
correct placement we exchange this

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:10.150 
correct placement we exchange this
needle<00:01:06.340> for<00:01:07.340> an<00:01:07.610> electrode<00:01:08.530> that<00:01:09.530> has<00:01:09.740> four

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:10.160 
needle for an electrode that has four

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.730 
needle for an electrode that has four
small<00:01:10.789> contact<00:01:11.450> points<00:01:11.899> on<00:01:12.050> it<00:01:12.200> and<00:01:12.619> that

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
small contact points on it and that

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.680 
small contact points on it and that
actually<00:01:13.100> again<00:01:13.369> goes<00:01:13.640> through<00:01:14.000> the<00:01:14.149> bone<00:01:14.330> and

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:14.690 
actually again goes through the bone and

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:17.320 
actually again goes through the bone and
sits<00:01:15.020> down<00:01:15.229> right<00:01:15.530> alongside<00:01:16.310> the<00:01:16.789> nerve<00:01:16.970> so

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:17.330 
sits down right alongside the nerve so

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.060 
sits down right alongside the nerve so
the<00:01:17.450> nerve<00:01:17.600> would<00:01:17.780> be<00:01:17.930> coming<00:01:18.140> out<00:01:18.350> kind<00:01:19.010> of

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.070 
the nerve would be coming out kind of

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.000 
the nerve would be coming out kind of
down<00:01:19.250> in<00:01:19.400> this<00:01:19.549> area<00:01:20.000> and<00:01:20.740> that's<00:01:21.740> what's

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:22.010 
down in this area and that's what's

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:23.890 
down in this area and that's what's
going<00:01:22.159> to<00:01:22.189> give<00:01:22.369> the<00:01:22.490> electrical<00:01:23.000> impulses<00:01:23.689> to

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:23.900 
going to give the electrical impulses to

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.880 
going to give the electrical impulses to
the<00:01:24.290> nerve<00:01:24.670> the<00:01:25.670> patient<00:01:26.150> wears<00:01:26.960> this<00:01:27.320> for<00:01:27.710> one

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890 
the nerve the patient wears this for one

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.130 
the nerve the patient wears this for one
to<00:01:28.040> two<00:01:28.220> weeks<00:01:28.430> it's<00:01:29.060> connected<00:01:29.720> to<00:01:29.869> a<00:01:29.900> little

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:30.140 
to two weeks it's connected to a little

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.170 
to two weeks it's connected to a little
external<00:01:30.860> wire<00:01:31.070> that<00:01:31.340> comes<00:01:31.549> out<00:01:31.700> of<00:01:31.820> the<00:01:31.909> skin

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:32.180 
external wire that comes out of the skin

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.270 
external wire that comes out of the skin
and<00:01:32.840> the<00:01:32.960> patient<00:01:33.320> hooks<00:01:33.500> it<00:01:33.650> up<00:01:33.710> to<00:01:33.920> a<00:01:33.950> small

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280 
and the patient hooks it up to a small

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.130 
and the patient hooks it up to a small
generator<00:01:34.759> it<00:01:35.180> looks<00:01:35.390> sort<00:01:35.540> of<00:01:35.630> like<00:01:35.689> a<00:01:35.810> pager

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 
generator it looks sort of like a pager

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.410 
generator it looks sort of like a pager
and<00:01:36.560> they<00:01:36.830> keep<00:01:37.009> a<00:01:37.100> diary<00:01:37.310> for<00:01:37.790> us<00:01:37.970> about<00:01:38.270> their

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
and they keep a diary for us about their

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.719 
and they keep a diary for us about their
symptoms<00:01:38.710> when<00:01:39.710> they<00:01:39.740> come<00:01:40.040> back<00:01:40.189> in<00:01:40.430> one<00:01:40.549> to

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
symptoms when they come back in one to

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:43.179 
symptoms when they come back in one to
two<00:01:40.909> weeks<00:01:40.990> if<00:01:41.990> it<00:01:42.320> looks<00:01:42.530> like<00:01:42.770> they've<00:01:43.009> had<00:01:43.130> a

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:43.189 
two weeks if it looks like they've had a

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:45.010 
two weeks if it looks like they've had a
good<00:01:43.400> response<00:01:43.670> and<00:01:44.240> an<00:01:44.420> improvement<00:01:44.780> in

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
good response and an improvement in

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.200 
good response and an improvement in
their<00:01:45.140> symptoms<00:01:45.400> then<00:01:46.400> what<00:01:46.670> we<00:01:46.790> do<00:01:47.000> is

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210 
their symptoms then what we do is

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:51.069 
their symptoms then what we do is
connect<00:01:47.990> this<00:01:48.229> lead<00:01:48.560> to<00:01:49.369> a<00:01:49.400> small<00:01:50.079> internal

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:51.079 
connect this lead to a small internal

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:53.109 
connect this lead to a small internal
generator<00:01:51.650> so<00:01:52.280> it's<00:01:52.430> basically<00:01:52.850> like<00:01:52.970> a

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:53.119 
generator so it's basically like a

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:56.800 
generator so it's basically like a
pacemaker<00:01:53.479> battery<00:01:54.460> and<00:01:55.460> this<00:01:55.670> is<00:01:56.090> put<00:01:56.509> just

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
pacemaker battery and this is put just

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.109 
pacemaker battery and this is put just
under<00:01:57.079> the<00:01:57.229> skin<00:01:57.530> kind<00:01:58.189> of<00:01:58.250> in<00:01:58.340> the<00:01:58.430> lower<00:01:58.579> part

00:01:59.109 --> 00:01:59.119 
under the skin kind of in the lower part

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:04.480 
under the skin kind of in the lower part
of<00:01:59.180> the<00:01:59.240> back<00:01:59.689> kind<00:01:59.990> of<00:02:00.020> above<00:02:00.290> the<00:02:00.439> hip

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.670 

it's<00:02:05.490> very<00:02:05.760> thin<00:02:06.120> and<00:02:06.600> so<00:02:07.140> for<00:02:07.320> most<00:02:07.500> patients

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
it's very thin and so for most patients

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.230 
it's very thin and so for most patients
they<00:02:08.040> really<00:02:08.310> don't<00:02:08.430> even<00:02:08.550> feel<00:02:08.880> it<00:02:08.910> unless

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:09.240 
they really don't even feel it unless
