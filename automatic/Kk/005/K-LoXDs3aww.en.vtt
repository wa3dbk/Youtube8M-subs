00:06:57.780 --> 00:06:57.790 
vary it with a legato base so I'll play

00:06:57.790 --> 00:06:59.909 
vary it with a legato base so I'll play
one<00:06:58.000> that's<00:06:58.240> the<00:06:58.420> cut<00:06:58.600> to<00:06:58.720> base<00:06:58.900> and<00:06:59.560> then<00:06:59.680> one

00:06:59.909 --> 00:06:59.919 
one that's the cut to base and then one

one that's the cut to base and then one
that's<00:07:00.070> legato<00:07:00.490> base<00:07:00.760> the<00:07:00.910> base<00:07:01.030> that's<00:07:01.240> tied
