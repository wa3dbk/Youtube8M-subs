00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.790
 a very good interview but they are not 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.970
 So obvious questions to answer or 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:14.399
 stupid quiet that's not like that 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.979
 first question how it feels to be what 

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:18.990
 Whole is simply exciting 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.909
 know that many people like 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.250
 my videos and that I admire second 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.810
 question does not bother you that users 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.479
 follow them and demand that the 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.310
 chapter 6 that do it a few months 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.320
 after uploading my video is 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.020
 well but do it on the same day as 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.560
 I uploaded the video and it is churlish has 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.630
 reason 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.360
 many people are quick to climb 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.580
 another video that's boring besides I've 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.979
 seen in the comments of chapter 5 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:46.890
 and they say go up to chapter 6 or also 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.929
 upload another video in one the subscription what 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.899
 believe like a robot sega and they those that 

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:54.380
 they send that art before that third 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:56.970
 ask how did you know in loquendo 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.039
 looking for videos of funny falls by 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.289
 youtube if you ask me in the 

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:03.530
 comments as I discovered it was by the 

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:06.409
 videos loquendo from 7 to ha ha 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.780
 fourth question he plans to continue with 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:11.030
 the series that leads I want to take it up 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.470
 a point that no longer becomes a series and 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.390
 return a funny video of the 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.970
 characters where they the only thing that 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.530
 they do is do things that make you laugh 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.400
 I understand boss 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:24.110
 15 question as support to the pieces 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:27.020
 erasing your comments and blocking 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.760
 its users that well these three are a 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.410
 annoyance and it's the worst thing that exists 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.360
 youtube because young until death 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:35.520
 uploading videos to the asshole and giving 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:38.520
 advertising also for the spam they make 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:41.640
 sixth question how the hamptons stand 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:43.920
 If they are mine, I tell them that I am not a 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.840
 god if they are from others not what whole 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.640
 He made it clear that what I do sometimes is 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.010
 a parody of what whole they 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.810
 they admire is that these zombies are made 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.820
 They are re mammon because they make Spain in 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.830
 other channels to publicize your 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:58.080
 Local favorite and also that 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:00.630
 begin to demand and demand as what 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:03.120
 happens with the usr they're rushed that 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:05.010
 upload a video if in the comments I 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.320
 they ask what I do the interviews for 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:10.170
 fame because they are wrong and I do it because 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:13.440
 I like it I do not do it for fame 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:16.440
 let's change the seventh question boss topic 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:18.560
 has played the big this car 4 clear 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:21.180
 that I have played it is more I already earn it 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:23.220
 I wish I had it, but my 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:26.280
 computer does not support it for 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:29.280
 textures and on the good side let's go 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:31.860
 ending the section the last question 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:34.290
 is what advice would you give to the new 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:36.810

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:39.090
 his videos is just a face that is used 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:41.420
 for the chats I used it before but 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:43.459
 I let him either do his for his not 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:45.709
 in videos and make a funny story 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:47.630
 not something stupid if they are going to start 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:50.180
 make videos look for tutorials for 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:52.030
 to learn first, good sega, the end of 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:55.130
