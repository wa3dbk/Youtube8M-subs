00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
don't think this will be enough but I do

with the hair that I got especially the
14<00:02:20.120> i<00:02:20.150> guess<00:02:20.510> it<00:02:20.840> was<00:02:20.870> shorter<00:02:21.500> i<00:02:21.709> got<00:02:22.160> quite<00:02:22.489> a

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:22.519 
14 i guess it was shorter i got quite a

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:25.030 
14 i guess it was shorter i got quite a
bit<00:02:22.790> of<00:02:22.880> hair<00:02:23.150> on<00:02:23.480> you<00:02:24.290> know<00:02:24.410> the<00:02:24.440> tracks<00:02:24.860> or

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
bit of hair on you know the tracks or

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.940 
bit of hair on you know the tracks or
whatever<00:02:25.310> but<00:02:25.850> anyways<00:02:26.330> I<00:02:26.360> got<00:02:27.260> it<00:02:27.590> was<00:02:27.739> pretty

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
whatever but anyways I got it was pretty

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.130 
whatever but anyways I got it was pretty
much<00:02:28.130> I<00:02:28.459> think<00:02:28.850> it<00:02:29.300> was<00:02:29.420> like<00:02:29.600> more<00:02:29.870> like<00:02:30.110> a

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
much I think it was like more like a

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:31.930 
much I think it was like more like a
brownish<00:02:30.830> looking<00:02:31.100> color<00:02:31.310> when<00:02:31.550> I<00:02:31.580> got<00:02:31.790> the

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
brownish looking color when I got the

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.040 
brownish looking color when I got the
hair<00:02:32.180> so<00:02:34.000> this<00:02:35.000> is<00:02:35.180> the<00:02:35.300> code<00:02:35.510> that<00:02:35.540> it<00:02:35.870> is

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
hair so this is the code that it is

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.970 
hair so this is the code that it is
right<00:02:36.470> up<00:02:36.680> top<00:02:36.950> and<00:02:37.250> I<00:02:37.370> dyed<00:02:37.670> the<00:02:38.150> hair<00:02:38.980> I

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
right up top and I dyed the hair I

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.380 
right up top and I dyed the hair I
bleached<00:02:40.790> it<00:02:41.060> with<00:02:41.630> the<00:02:42.080> l'oreal<00:02:42.790> i<00:02:43.790> think<00:02:44.269> it

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
bleached it with the l'oreal i think it

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.710
