00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:03.550
 Let's see 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.550
 good good good we're here and 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.770
 friends of the games you who have 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.260
 wanted that since it is the beta then I 

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:15.150
 put here to try to kill people 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:17.100
 but without firing or be flat what I 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.289
 then as I am a brave uncle I 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.940
 they just killed you see what happens good 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.170
 let's go see if we can move 

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:24.690
 through the mapping and we can 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.400
 surprise some from behind that to 

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:29.670
 that's the ability to make me 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:32.680
 invisible to see if he shoots me around here 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.960
 there is fear before one in the distance 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:37.720
 if you use the titan I will also have 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.400
 to tell you what it will be to kill the 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.830
 people in plan fight see this map such 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:44.470
 wave is not blown is what happens 

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:46.989
 when you put yourself in the middle they have turned me 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:49.270
 kill to see who has been father in fit 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:51.370
 from far and something other but worse than me 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:53.080
 still but nothing happens I am that 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:56.770
 shoot and shoot to intimidate a 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:59.470
 little fair and so around here a titan to see 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:01.390
 if I can escape from the shooting range in 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:04.260
 your visit at level 11 good the goal you 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:04.260
 you left at level 14 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:09.070
 and I do not see anything I have the map around here 

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:14.280
 internet but the truth is that many 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:18.329
 Sometimes they hide but good to see 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.329
 Let see if I can 

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:36.869
 sir equals where they take off 

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:40.460
 I want to climb the titan to crush 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:42.710
 it is very very very well 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:45.909
 up 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:48.350
 to the very well up come 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:51.740
 let's go to it and see where the other one is 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:53.510
 titan because now I like a lot to do 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.200
 kill the enemies to the militia not 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:58.289
 go down 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:01.110
 they are shooting me escaped here 

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:02.430
 escaped over there to be releasing paper 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.229
 and say that why have any 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.680
 effectively here is one let's see 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:09.259
 if I can kill him 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:12.520
 and this normal I like to start the 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:12.520
 pilot inside yes sir 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.480
 others 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:28.130
 we have already returned sometimes it is because 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:31.280
 the ping is very high but nothing happens 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:32.720
 another go to your meals and be 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:36.140
 mixed against gods 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:38.890
 I am robotic 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.890
 I want to look for another 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.570
 it never goes 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:03:01.810
 and well let's get on top of him and 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:04.060
 then burst of this after having here 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:08.070
 I already have you around here if I'm going to shoot 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.070
 but as another one comes out but it's also worth not 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:18.060
 I think it is 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:24.400
 well let's continue they will no longer be deaths 

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:26.220
 today they are gaining certainly not 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.860
 we are talking about us 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:32.220
 let's win us 207 dead 41 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:33.810
 now let's see if I can move here the 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:37.360
 mapping helped me a lot the truth for 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:39.370
 Orient where the reds are 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:42.940
 let's see if you see here any I can 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:46.000
 camouflage in some way and surprise 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:47.560
 I think the buildings 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.940
 but I will pass because until the 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:52.569
 titans helping for hair 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:54.969
 to see how long a little 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:56.720
 the people around here are better the best 

00:03:54.969 --> 00:03:58.910
 there is no level 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:01.270
 I already have the titan in there 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:01.270
 brief 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:16.700
 the story without shooting is so that of 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:19.299
 moment the challenge overcome to start 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:28.139
 move a little more to see 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:28.139
 over here and another for another 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.990
 I'll see if I can call the titan not me 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:36.240
 kill 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:38.520
 young man less killed and several behind 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:41.490
 well right there I want military 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:44.330
 give me my twitter 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:44.330
 go get him 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:49.360
 let's go for him 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:51.730
 multi so good there's only one titan I think 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.590
 that is atlas class is the only titan 

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:54.880
 it has moment in the beta but good I think 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:55.810
 we're going to leave it here because the 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:57.910
 time does not give for more 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:00.670
 the rest exceeded that the new format to 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:03.840
 I have rarely killed many and toasts 

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:03.840
 for you so
