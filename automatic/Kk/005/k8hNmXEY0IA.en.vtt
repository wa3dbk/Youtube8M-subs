00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.009
 hello today i want you 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.440
 tell about a very interesting such 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:10.820
 unusual for me water diet about 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:15.269
 water a lot of different talk goes yes and 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:17.609
 here's a water diet for where not here such 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.439
 Here is an interesting question and I decided to 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.480
 you too share such times 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:25.500
 information got mean you need to share 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:29.220
 that's what's interesting in this one diet as 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:32.550
 it says yes what is the process 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:35.130
 aging it is generally directly related to 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.500
 lack of fluid in the cells and dry 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.290
 skin old noticed probably she's so 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.420
 here is lifeless dryish here the same 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.789
 that is the most need to drink plenty of water about 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.640
 this already says a lot in different 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.940
 sources say this before but what 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.350
 for me it was new here in this 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.879
 diet in this practice as if not himself 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.530
 cope at all I really like because 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.420
 have something like 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.770
 refuse yes immediately some 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:04.019
 such thoughts 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:06.360
 it's a little different here and people 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.830
 often overweight 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.150
 consumes an insufficient amount 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:13.020
 water water in the cells is not enough and 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:15.150
 the body starts this water 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.210
 accumulate with fat cells 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.890
 yes and save in order to then in 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.110
 the right time could be spent 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.299
 when water is not enough water begins 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.420
 from these processes , that's what needs to be done 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:30.840
 in order to get rid of excess 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:33.060
 weight let's say so and what is it 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.780
 the most water diet actually 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:39.509
 to lose weight with water is very easy and 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:43.439
 the rule is very simple 1 glass of water 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:47.159
 in the morning and one glass of water in the evening somewhere 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:50.220
 three hours before bedtime 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:52.320
 should be at room temperature not 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:56.070
 cold I will drink not hot room 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:58.799
 temperatures for what it is in the morning when you 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.730
 drink a glass of water the body wakes up 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:03.790
 and tuned to active work 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:06.130
 here and so the evening begins 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:07.930
 cleansing process plus everything 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:08.920
 a glass of water which spit in the evening for 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:14.560
 three hours to sleep 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:17.800
 which is also important he starts giving your 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:21.340
 stomach signals that all 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.470
 he is a full signal of holiness and you have not 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:28.180
 there will be feelings of hunger 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:30.400
 also works very well for me 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:34.570
 interesting discovery was in this diet 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:37.330
 as they say before that you can not drink water 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:40.510
 or something on this tea coffee still something 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:42.130
 right after the meal for me the truth was 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:45.820
 discovery maybe you already know about it 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:48.790
 but what is the essence of why the most important 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:51.130
 the question is why such is why when you 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:53.260
 eat you starts to produce a zhopny 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:55.240
 gastric juice which that digest 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.480
 your food is all great 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:00.690
 now imagine grew immediately drank 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:05.290
 something tea-coffee 40 no matter what the hell 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:07.450
 drank water and here is this liquid she 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:08.920
 starts once diluted that 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.860
 concentrated gastric juice which 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:14.860
 need in order to digest the food that 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:16.930
 it turns out he is not up to digested this food and 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:20.620
 not until digested arch by this gastric 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:23.230
 the juice of the food goes further it turns out not 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.970
 quite right yes then you need to continue 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:28.000
 its more like digesting on 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:31.180
 digest there are these processes 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.620
 which are wrong and in order to 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.730
 the body to digest food properly 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:38.230
 need accordingly 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:41.470
 ate then waited it turns out like 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:43.840
 at least at least and then drink tea 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:47.350
 there or coffee or her that you still there 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.940
 drink before either just here but the most 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:50.980
 the main thing is not to dilute the gastric juice 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:53.200
 so he managed to work it very 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:55.989
 unusual when I started doing it 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:58.780
 prim think how you ate need to drink and 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:04:01.030
 Immediately the note became easier 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.860
 to replace this water here which is 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:05.080
 liquid video yes a little can help 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:08.110
 be the stomach for this what applies 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:08.930
 why is it useful to eat soups 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:10.430
 yes they are 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:13.790
 digestion because they are no longer 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:14.269
 liquid is why it is good to eat vegetables and 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:17.229
 fruits 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:19.850
 because they also have liquid and 

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:21.500
 less will you need liquid in order 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:23.620
 to drink up to sing for 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:25.460
 feeling good 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:27.560
 just on time then 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:31.570
 breakfasts and lunches and dinners include more 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:34.789
 something and here something containing liquid 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:39.199
 but ideally here regarding this water 

00:04:34.789 --> 00:04:42.740
 diets need to drink again I will remind to 

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:45.289
 a glass of water for room temperature 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:49.940
 half an hour before meals 

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:53.690
 so that this liquid does not dilute that 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:57.400
 most gastric juice and optimally on 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:05:00.050
 in fact, an hour and a half after eating 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:00.889
 drink tons of glass of room water 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:03.910
 temperatures 

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:08.210
 so here and a half hour after eating 

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:11.300
 see and during the day you need to drink water 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:14.960
 and according to this one again 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:18.289
 aquatic diet need at least 2 liters 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:20.150
 drink water every day but always 

00:05:18.289 --> 00:05:22.460
 need to understand that now is the time for food 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:23.930
 will be up planned then this is water 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:25.610
 drank and ate in an hour and a half 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:28.280
 times-once-again drank the water 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:30.199
 that is, it is necessary here that all things are wise 

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:31.789
 combine wrong all understand this 

00:05:30.199 --> 00:05:33.400
 see if you have a glass in the morning you 

00:05:31.789 --> 00:05:36.470
 and kolyada in the evening before going to bed glass 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:39.020
 finish the glass in an hour and a half after 

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:41.330
 food from a glass is now at least 

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:44.720
 four glasses you should be 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:46.099
 drink some water 

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:49.490
 room temperature water 

00:05:46.099 --> 00:05:51.349
 see when if you suddenly drink 

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:55.310
 cold water is wrong why 

00:05:51.349 --> 00:05:57.320
 because when you drank it to the body 

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:59.599
 required by the energy that when first 

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:02.240
 heat from the fact that while digest 

00:05:59.599 --> 00:06:05.330
 or turn into something else required 

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:07.580
 still energy does not need to force the body 

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:09.860
 excessive length it still work right away 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:13.400
 water and warmed and a warm vodichku 

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:13.849
 drank to not myself easier to do and body wars 

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:16.879
 kart 

00:06:13.849 --> 00:06:19.580
 thank you at least do not overheat so yet 

00:06:16.879 --> 00:06:20.419
 help yourself in general 

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:22.699
 water diet 

00:06:20.419 --> 00:06:25.429
 try to start eating like this to drink 

00:06:22.699 --> 00:06:28.429
 drink water like this in the right quantities 

00:06:25.429 --> 00:06:29.059
 water right and see for yourself 

00:06:28.429 --> 00:06:31.849
 the result 

00:06:29.059 --> 00:06:34.189
 I also start to eat so much of ours 

00:06:31.849 --> 00:06:37.219
 do we will watch ourselves with our 

00:06:34.189 --> 00:06:40.449
 weight for their condition but for now all 

00:06:37.219 --> 00:06:40.449
 dollar see you soon
