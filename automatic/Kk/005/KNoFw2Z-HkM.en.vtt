balloon with air being blown in its
expanding<00:02:09.380> the<00:02:09.470> balloon<00:02:09.769> the<00:02:10.009> balloon

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:10.039 
expanding the balloon the balloon

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:11.650 
expanding the balloon the balloon
stretches<00:02:10.849> and<00:02:10.940> then<00:02:11.030> when<00:02:11.150> you<00:02:11.209> let<00:02:11.390> the<00:02:11.510> air

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
stretches and then when you let the air

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.360 
stretches and then when you let the air
out<00:02:11.690> whether<00:02:12.110> it's<00:02:12.290> quickly<00:02:12.620> or<00:02:12.739> slowly<00:02:12.890> it

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
out whether it's quickly or slowly it

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.360 
out whether it's quickly or slowly it
leaves<00:02:13.660> marks<00:02:14.660> in<00:02:14.870> it<00:02:14.989> okay<00:02:15.890> let's<00:02:16.130> take<00:02:16.310> a

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
leaves marks in it okay let's take a

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:21.220 
leaves marks in it okay let's take a
look<00:02:16.640> at<00:02:16.790> Caroline<00:02:17.269> here<00:02:19.600> let's<00:02:20.600> take<00:02:20.810> a<00:02:20.870> peek

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
look at Caroline here let's take a peek

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:22.660 
look at Caroline here let's take a peek
now<00:02:21.470> I<00:02:21.500> had<00:02:21.650> a<00:02:21.680> chance<00:02:21.950> to<00:02:22.100> meet<00:02:22.250> Caroline

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
now I had a chance to meet Caroline

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:27.039 
now I had a chance to meet Caroline
before<00:02:22.820> and<00:02:23.769> she's<00:02:24.769> unusual<00:02:25.340> in<00:02:25.459> that<00:02:25.930> she<00:02:26.930> has

00:02:27.039 --> 00:02:27.049

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:28.840 
before and she's unusual in that she has
stretch<00:02:27.350> marks<00:02:27.680> in<00:02:27.799> a<00:02:27.859> variety<00:02:28.280> of<00:02:28.310> places<00:02:28.609> and

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:28.850 
stretch marks in a variety of places and

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:30.789 
stretch marks in a variety of places and
you<00:02:29.000> see<00:02:29.209> on<00:02:29.390> the<00:02:29.570> belly<00:02:29.840> area<00:02:30.109> here<00:02:30.530> she's

00:02:30.789 --> 00:02:30.799 
you see on the belly area here she's

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:32.680 
you see on the belly area here she's
still<00:02:31.040> very<00:02:31.070> very<00:02:31.549> firm<00:02:31.970> she<00:02:32.329> doesn't<00:02:32.480> have

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
still very very firm she doesn't have

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:34.059 
still very very firm she doesn't have
extra<00:02:32.959> skin<00:02:33.200> there<00:02:33.500> isn't<00:02:33.739> really<00:02:33.920> that

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:34.069 
extra skin there isn't really that

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:38.559 
extra skin there isn't really that
laxity<00:02:34.819> that<00:02:35.090> that<00:02:35.440> apron<00:02:36.440> and<00:02:37.069> so<00:02:37.760> if<00:02:38.239> there

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:38.569 
laxity that that apron and so if there

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:40.840 
laxity that that apron and so if there
were<00:02:38.690> a<00:02:39.019> lot<00:02:39.200> of<00:02:39.319> excess<00:02:39.650> skin<00:02:39.709> then<00:02:40.280> the

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850 
were a lot of excess skin then the

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:42.430 
were a lot of excess skin then the
plastic<00:02:41.060> surgical<00:02:41.600> people<00:02:41.959> would<00:02:42.109> remove

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
plastic surgical people would remove

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.650 
plastic surgical people would remove
that<00:02:42.500> and<00:02:42.829> then<00:02:42.980> maybe<00:02:43.190> I<00:02:43.310> would<00:02:43.579> work<00:02:43.819> on<00:02:44.060> the

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
that and then maybe I would work on the

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.259 
that and then maybe I would work on the
leftover<00:02:45.470> remnants<00:02:45.739> after<00:02:46.670> the<00:02:46.819> excess<00:02:47.180> skin

00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:47.269 
leftover remnants after the excess skin

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:49.000 
leftover remnants after the excess skin
will<00:02:47.540> removed<00:02:47.870> but<00:02:48.200> you<00:02:48.319> can<00:02:48.440> sort<00:02:48.620> of<00:02:48.680> see<00:02:48.859> the

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
will removed but you can sort of see the

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:50.410 
will removed but you can sort of see the
little<00:02:49.220> streams<00:02:49.579> is<00:02:49.790> sort<00:02:50.000> of<00:02:50.030> like<00:02:50.120> dried-out

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
little streams is sort of like dried-out

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.110 
little streams is sort of like dried-out
riverbeds<00:02:50.600> and<00:02:51.470> she<00:02:52.190> has<00:02:52.310> it<00:02:52.489> all<00:02:52.609> over<00:02:52.940> and<00:02:53.060> if

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
riverbeds and she has it all over and if

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.970 
riverbeds and she has it all over and if
you<00:02:53.209> turn<00:02:53.420> to<00:02:53.600> the<00:02:53.720> side<00:02:53.750> you<00:02:54.410> can<00:02:54.829> actually

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
you turn to the side you can actually

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.610 
you turn to the side you can actually
see<00:02:55.489> that<00:02:55.880> there<00:02:56.090> red<00:02:56.299> are<00:02:56.450> here<00:02:56.750> so<00:02:57.290> stretch

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
see that there red are here so stretch

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.949 
see that there red are here so stretch
marks<00:02:58.010> different<00:02:58.790> shapes<00:02:59.060> different<00:02:59.299> sizes

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
marks different shapes different sizes

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:01.690 
marks different shapes different sizes
some<00:03:00.170> are<00:03:00.319> red<00:03:00.530> some<00:03:00.889> are<00:03:01.040> white<00:03:01.220> some<00:03:01.519> are

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
some are red some are white some are

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.340 
some are red some are white some are
brown<00:03:01.910> black<00:03:02.269> different<00:03:02.720> colors<00:03:03.079> and

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.350 
brown black different colors and

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.710 
brown black different colors and
treatments<00:03:03.980> are<00:03:04.130> dictated<00:03:05.090> by<00:03:05.269> the<00:03:05.329> color

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 
treatments are dictated by the color

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.680 
treatments are dictated by the color
intensity<00:03:06.680> exactly<00:03:07.639> so<00:03:08.180> what<00:03:08.359> would<00:03:08.510> you

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690 
intensity exactly so what would you

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:10.539 
intensity exactly so what would you
suggest<00:03:08.870> for<00:03:09.230> Caroline<00:03:09.739> when<00:03:10.010> one<00:03:10.250> given

00:03:10.539 --> 00:03:10.549 
suggest for Caroline when one given

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:12.069 
suggest for Caroline when one given
individual<00:03:11.090> they're<00:03:11.329> different<00:03:11.630> in

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:12.079 
individual they're different in

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:13.780 
individual they're different in
different<00:03:12.260> anatomic<00:03:13.069> areas<00:03:13.459> and<00:03:13.639> therefore

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
different anatomic areas and therefore

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:15.849 
different anatomic areas and therefore
they're<00:03:14.120> treated<00:03:14.480> differently<00:03:14.870> but<00:03:15.500> the

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:15.859 
they're treated differently but the

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:19.240 
they're treated differently but the
bottom<00:03:16.220> line<00:03:16.250> is<00:03:16.700> her<00:03:17.600> ancestry<00:03:18.590> her<00:03:18.739> her

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
bottom line is her ancestry her her

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.099 
bottom line is her ancestry her her
ethnicity<00:03:19.850> is<00:03:19.910> a<00:03:20.030> very<00:03:20.239> important<00:03:20.720> question

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:21.109 
ethnicity is a very important question

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:23.559 
ethnicity is a very important question
here<00:03:21.319> the<00:03:21.920> darker<00:03:22.400> the<00:03:22.519> individual<00:03:23.209> the<00:03:23.359> more

00:03:23.559 --> 00:03:23.569 
here the darker the individual the more

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:25.479 
here the darker the individual the more
mixed<00:03:23.900> the<00:03:23.989> ethnicity<00:03:24.139> the<00:03:24.739> more<00:03:24.920> careful<00:03:25.400> you

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:25.489 
mixed the ethnicity the more careful you

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:27.309 
mixed the ethnicity the more careful you
have<00:03:25.580> to<00:03:25.640> be<00:03:25.879> in<00:03:26.000> treatment<00:03:26.269> the<00:03:26.840> first<00:03:27.049> thing

00:03:27.309 --> 00:03:27.319 
have to be in treatment the first thing

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:29.380 
have to be in treatment the first thing
is<00:03:27.439> medical<00:03:27.860> treatment<00:03:28.310> and<00:03:28.519> I<00:03:28.909> brought<00:03:29.150> some

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:29.390 
is medical treatment and I brought some

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.770 
is medical treatment and I brought some
of<00:03:29.510> the

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
of the

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:32.920 
of the
for<00:03:30.170> her<00:03:30.319> to<00:03:30.530> take<00:03:30.709> home<00:03:30.920> and<00:03:31.100> try<00:03:31.569> the<00:03:32.569> product

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
for her to take home and try the product

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:36.280 
for her to take home and try the product
away<00:03:33.620> at<00:03:33.770> the<00:03:33.920> end<00:03:34.069> this<00:03:34.580> over<00:03:35.000> is<00:03:35.209> really<00:03:36.170> the

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
away at the end this over is really the

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:37.809 
away at the end this over is really the
most<00:03:36.440> important<00:03:36.860> it's<00:03:37.010> a<00:03:37.040> form<00:03:37.280> of<00:03:37.370> retinoic

00:03:37.809 --> 00:03:37.819 
most important it's a form of retinoic

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:40.870 
most important it's a form of retinoic
acid<00:03:37.940> a<00:03:38.480> retinol<00:03:38.990> retinyl<00:03:39.560> and<00:03:39.860> it's<00:03:40.520> safe<00:03:40.700> to

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:40.880 
acid a retinol retinyl and it's safe to

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.270 
acid a retinol retinyl and it's safe to
use<00:03:40.910> it's<00:03:41.270> applied<00:03:41.600> once<00:03:42.200> or<00:03:42.380> twice<00:03:42.590> daily<00:03:42.890> for

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 
use it's applied once or twice daily for

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.460 
use it's applied once or twice daily for
about<00:03:43.340> 30<00:03:43.700> days<00:03:44.020> just<00:03:45.020> like<00:03:45.140> we<00:03:45.260> treat

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470 
about 30 days just like we treat

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:47.680 
about 30 days just like we treat
wrinkles<00:03:45.860> you're<00:03:46.040> stimulating<00:03:46.360> exactly<00:03:47.360> 3

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.690 
wrinkles you're stimulating exactly 3

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:50.440 
wrinkles you're stimulating exactly 3
horizontals<00:03:48.500> help<00:03:49.280> out<00:03:49.459> elastin<00:03:49.970> alone<00:03:50.180> right

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.450 
horizontals help out elastin alone right

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:51.820 
horizontals help out elastin alone right
so<00:03:50.660> there's<00:03:50.840> a<00:03:50.900> medical<00:03:51.290> treatment<00:03:51.709> you're

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:51.830 
so there's a medical treatment you're

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:53.890 
so there's a medical treatment you're
trying<00:03:52.100> to<00:03:52.220> improve<00:03:52.640> the<00:03:52.970> biology<00:03:53.630> of<00:03:53.780> the

trying to improve the biology of the
skin<00:03:54.230> you<00:03:55.160> want<00:03:55.400> to<00:03:55.520> see<00:03:55.730> that<00:03:56.330> it's<00:03:56.450> becoming

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810 
skin you want to see that it's becoming

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:00.160 
skin you want to see that it's becoming
lively<00:03:57.620> again<00:03:57.739> these<00:03:58.459> are<00:03:58.610> areas<00:03:59.540> of<00:03:59.750> scar

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:00.170 
lively again these are areas of scar

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:01.600 
lively again these are areas of scar
tissue<00:04:00.200> you<00:04:00.590> want<00:04:00.770> to<00:04:00.830> bring<00:04:00.980> it<00:04:01.069> back<00:04:01.220> to<00:04:01.400> life

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:01.610 
tissue you want to bring it back to life

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:04.120 
tissue you want to bring it back to life
and<00:04:01.880> then<00:04:02.239> once<00:04:02.540> that's<00:04:02.720> done<00:04:02.930> then<00:04:03.830> you<00:04:03.950> can

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:04.130 
and then once that's done then you can

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:05.680 
and then once that's done then you can
think<00:04:04.310> about<00:04:04.340> lasers<00:04:04.880> what<00:04:05.300> do<00:04:05.360> you<00:04:05.450> what<00:04:05.630> do

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:05.690 
think about lasers what do you what do

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:08.050 
think about lasers what do you what do
you<00:04:05.720> think<00:04:05.810> of<00:04:06.140> some<00:04:06.350> of<00:04:06.380> these<00:04:06.560> at<00:04:06.890> home<00:04:07.060> items

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.060 
you think of some of these at home items

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.210 
you think of some of these at home items
that<00:04:08.300> people<00:04:08.330> do<00:04:08.810> I<00:04:08.840> know<00:04:09.019> they<00:04:09.260> try<00:04:09.560> olive<00:04:09.830> oil

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:10.220 
that people do I know they try olive oil

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:13.000 
that people do I know they try olive oil
they<00:04:10.700> try<00:04:11.000> aloe<00:04:11.300> they<00:04:11.989> try<00:04:12.290> cocoa<00:04:12.739> butter

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.010 
they try aloe they try cocoa butter

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:15.580 
they try aloe they try cocoa butter
vitamin<00:04:13.910> E<00:04:14.120> vitamin<00:04:14.150> A<00:04:14.810> do<00:04:14.870> you<00:04:15.140> think<00:04:15.350> any<00:04:15.530> of

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:15.590 
vitamin E vitamin A do you think any of

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:17.170 
vitamin E vitamin A do you think any of
those<00:04:15.769> things<00:04:16.040> actually<00:04:16.340> work<00:04:16.820> do<00:04:16.970> they<00:04:17.060> have

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:17.180 
those things actually work do they have

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.740 
those things actually work do they have
a<00:04:17.209> place

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750 
a place

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:19.930 
a place
have<00:04:18.140> you<00:04:18.290> tried<00:04:18.530> feathers<00:04:19.130> I<00:04:19.340> have<00:04:19.579> tried

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:19.940 
have you tried feathers I have tried

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:21.759 
have you tried feathers I have tried
I've<00:04:20.180> only<00:04:20.390> tried<00:04:20.720> cocoa<00:04:21.200> bar<00:04:21.500> throughout

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:21.769 
I've only tried cocoa bar throughout

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:24.310 
I've only tried cocoa bar throughout
both<00:04:22.400> of<00:04:22.580> my<00:04:22.669> pregnancies<00:04:23.240> and<00:04:23.450> I<00:04:23.810> still<00:04:24.169> got

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:24.320 
both of my pregnancies and I still got

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.170 
both of my pregnancies and I still got
them<00:04:24.530> even<00:04:25.130> though<00:04:25.250> I<00:04:25.280> I<00:04:25.550> use<00:04:25.820> them<00:04:26.000> almost

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:26.180 
them even though I I use them almost

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:28.360 
them even though I I use them almost
every<00:04:26.600> day<00:04:26.630> you<00:04:27.500> were<00:04:27.620> using<00:04:27.800> them<00:04:28.010> from<00:04:28.280> the

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:28.370 
every day you were using them from the

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:30.129 
every day you were using them from the
beginning<00:04:28.490> of<00:04:28.910> the<00:04:29.000> first<00:04:29.270> pregnancy<00:04:29.720> Yeah

00:04:30.129 --> 00:04:30.139 
beginning of the first pregnancy Yeah

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:32.830 
beginning of the first pregnancy Yeah
right<00:04:30.320> so<00:04:31.190> the<00:04:31.669> the<00:04:32.060> truth<00:04:32.300> of<00:04:32.450> the<00:04:32.540> matter<00:04:32.750> is

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:32.840 
right so the the truth of the matter is

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.290 
right so the the truth of the matter is
I'm<00:04:33.229> not<00:04:33.410> sure<00:04:33.470> that<00:04:33.919> they<00:04:34.070> have<00:04:34.220> any<00:04:34.430> benefit

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:35.300 
I'm not sure that they have any benefit

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:37.110 
I'm not sure that they have any benefit
they<00:04:35.419> probably<00:04:35.600> don't<00:04:35.810> do<00:04:35.960> any<00:04:36.169> harm<00:04:36.470> but

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 
they probably don't do any harm but

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.580 
they probably don't do any harm but
there's<00:04:38.120> sometimes<00:04:38.330> an<00:04:38.630> emotional<00:04:39.140> benefit

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:39.590 
there's sometimes an emotional benefit

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:41.380 
there's sometimes an emotional benefit
to<00:04:39.710> using<00:04:39.919> them<00:04:40.250> so<00:04:40.490> some<00:04:40.669> people<00:04:40.820> like<00:04:41.000> to<00:04:41.150> use

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:41.390 
to using them so some people like to use

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:43.840 
to using them so some people like to use
them<00:04:41.540> for<00:04:41.690> that<00:04:41.780> benefit<00:04:42.320> that's<00:04:42.919> fine<00:04:43.280> but<00:04:43.790> I

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:43.850 
them for that benefit that's fine but I

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:45.340 
them for that benefit that's fine but I
don't<00:04:43.940> think<00:04:44.390> they<00:04:44.510> do<00:04:44.570> anything<00:04:45.140> for

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:45.350 
don't think they do anything for

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:47.440 
don't think they do anything for
stopping<00:04:45.800> this<00:04:45.919> difficult<00:04:46.729> problem<00:04:46.940> it's<00:04:47.330> a

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:47.450 
stopping this difficult problem it's a

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:48.940 
stopping this difficult problem it's a
difficult<00:04:47.690> problem<00:04:48.020> and<00:04:48.229> somewhere<00:04:48.650> down<00:04:48.800> the

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:48.950 
difficult problem and somewhere down the

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:50.830 
difficult problem and somewhere down the
road<00:04:48.979> after<00:04:49.550> she's<00:04:49.880> been<00:04:50.060> primed<00:04:50.390> enough<00:04:50.690> with

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:50.840 
road after she's been primed enough with

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:52.510 
road after she's been primed enough with
medical<00:04:51.530> therapy<00:04:51.950> than<00:04:52.130> there<00:04:52.280> are<00:04:52.370> lasers

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:52.520 
medical therapy than there are lasers

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:54.070 
medical therapy than there are lasers
that<00:04:52.789> can<00:04:52.910> be<00:04:53.120> used<00:04:53.360> if<00:04:53.539> you<00:04:53.660> have<00:04:53.690> some

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:54.080 
that can be used if you have some

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.500 
that can be used if you have some
results<00:04:54.710> to<00:04:54.950> show<00:04:55.190> us<00:04:55.340> of<00:04:55.550> whether<00:04:56.000> you<00:04:56.180> what

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:56.510 
results to show us of whether you what

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:58.330 
results to show us of whether you what
you<00:04:56.660> can<00:04:56.870> get<00:04:57.050> with<00:04:57.200> stretch<00:04:57.440> marks<00:04:57.470> with

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:58.340 
you can get with stretch marks with

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:03.190 
you can get with stretch marks with
laser<00:04:58.700> treatment<00:05:01.240> you<00:05:02.240> see<00:05:02.479> here<00:05:02.750> there<00:05:03.169> are

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:03.200 
laser treatment you see here there are

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:05.740 
laser treatment you see here there are
two<00:05:03.410> photographs<00:05:03.680> right<00:05:04.640> up<00:05:04.789> here<00:05:05.060> if<00:05:05.419> you<00:05:05.539> can

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:05.750 
two photographs right up here if you can

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:08.950 
two photographs right up here if you can
focus<00:05:05.990> in<00:05:06.350> the<00:05:06.979> stretch<00:05:07.340> marks<00:05:07.700> are<00:05:07.910> wide<00:05:08.240> you

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:08.960 
focus in the stretch marks are wide you

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:10.540 
focus in the stretch marks are wide you
can<00:05:09.080> see<00:05:09.289> the<00:05:09.410> linear<00:05:09.620> nature<00:05:09.830> and<00:05:10.370> if<00:05:10.430> you

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:10.550 
can see the linear nature and if you

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:13.090 
can see the linear nature and if you
were<00:05:10.669> able<00:05:10.880> to<00:05:11.060> feel<00:05:11.479> them<00:05:11.740> you<00:05:12.740> can<00:05:12.890> really

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:13.100 
were able to feel them you can really

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:14.980 
were able to feel them you can really
almost<00:05:13.310> put<00:05:13.610> your<00:05:13.760> all<00:05:14.240> the<00:05:14.270> way<00:05:14.510> through<00:05:14.900> it

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:14.990 
almost put your all the way through it

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:17.080 
almost put your all the way through it
because<00:05:15.500> the<00:05:15.860> upper<00:05:16.130> and<00:05:16.220> middle<00:05:16.310> layers<00:05:16.789> of

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:17.090 
because the upper and middle layers of

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:19.990 
because the upper and middle layers of
skin<00:05:17.450> are<00:05:17.750> pretty<00:05:18.050> much<00:05:18.229> eaten<00:05:18.590> up<00:05:18.740> here<00:05:19.520> after

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:20.000 
skin are pretty much eaten up here after

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.820 
skin are pretty much eaten up here after
some<00:05:20.539> medical<00:05:20.870> treatment<00:05:21.080> and<00:05:21.470> some<00:05:21.620> laser

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:21.830 
some medical treatment and some laser

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:23.409 
some medical treatment and some laser
treatment<00:05:22.400> there's<00:05:22.850> still<00:05:23.060> a<00:05:23.090> little<00:05:23.270> bit

00:05:23.409 --> 00:05:23.419 
treatment there's still a little bit

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:26.020 
treatment there's still a little bit
visible<00:05:24.020> but<00:05:24.260> much<00:05:24.500> much<00:05:24.919> more<00:05:25.250> better<00:05:25.789> so

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:26.030 
visible but much much more better so

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:28.029 
visible but much much more better so
this<00:05:26.180> was<00:05:26.390> a<00:05:26.419> combined<00:05:26.930> treatment<00:05:27.260> you<00:05:27.830> did

00:05:28.029 --> 00:05:28.039 
this was a combined treatment you did

00:05:28.039 --> 00:05:29.650 
this was a combined treatment you did
some<00:05:28.250> medical<00:05:28.550> treatment<00:05:28.789> first<00:05:29.240> got<00:05:29.510> the

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:29.660 
some medical treatment first got the

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:31.630 
some medical treatment first got the
skin<00:05:29.930> ready<00:05:30.140> followed<00:05:30.890> up<00:05:31.010> by<00:05:31.160> some<00:05:31.340> lasers

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:31.640 
skin ready followed up by some lasers
