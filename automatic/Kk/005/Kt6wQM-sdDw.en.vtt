00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:07.830
 here are the different elements 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.620
 needed to mount the big 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.080
 crate you have it's this tyrant 16 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.570
 amount a shim for the pedal of 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:20.730
 bass drum fat taxes for 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:22.710
 levis is a key of batteries this side 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.000
 of the drums and the drummer side and 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.519
 the other side and obviously side 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.340
 spectators you take the skin and you 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:32.369
 lay it directly on the side 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:36.030
 of the model label you have 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.469
 then the strapping you will notice the 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.329
 strapping seal it's better the 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:44.010
 put under good pub aesthetics 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:46.140
 battery then you have 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.500
 every tyrant putting the screw as 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:52.379
 this will hook you the amount at 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.879
 strapping and you life is your screw there 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.350
 must then arranged in a cross it is at 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.430
 say that once screwed and on one side we 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.260
 screw the opposite side 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.879
 we continue so on 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.039
 always doing in opposition the 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.899
 battery assembly game it's on purpose 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.080
 in the starting hand to avoid doing 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.909
 too much tension on the skin 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.140
 then you flip your skin back to you 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.570
 do the same for the skin 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.159
 resonance of the resonant and 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.140
 written with a pearl on it you can 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.729
 do it as you wish me 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.390
 prefer to place the pearl well aligned 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.950
 with the tom stand to protect 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.420
 this part of the stripes that can 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.960
 cause the claws of the pedal to 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.119
 bass drum 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.939
 you have seven plastic elements 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:32.479
 you're just disposed by removing the 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.479
 protective tape 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:40.640
 and placing it directly in the 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:45.030
 strapping the bass drum 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:46.500
 so by installing your pedals you 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.729
 will never have a problem and you 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.729
 will not like your bass drum 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.630
 the assembly of the low volume takes place from 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:55.930
 the same way as for the big 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.780
 checkout 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.200
 so you take the skin no matter 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.060
 which 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.010
 because these are the same two for fear 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.920
 leuthard gates you have 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:12.070
 the pearls indication directly on the 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:16.090
 logo you then place the strapping by 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:19.210
 above and you can do the 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:21.550
 different faces pulling like us 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:23.530
 have seen for the bass drum for the 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:27.040
 resonance skin you performed the same 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:29.830
 operation by placing the skin next 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:32.680
 you will place the strapping and finally 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:35.110
 the different screws of tyrants in 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:38.890
 always using the technique of 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:40.780
 cross clamping so that your tom 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:43.390
 bass stand on the ground you have to 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.730
 unscrewed on the side the tyrants and 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:48.790
 slide inside 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:51.430
 your feet no matter the meaning a little 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:53.440
 does the assembly of the missing the three 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.800
 feet are put equally in 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.800
 height 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:02.200
 in order to fix the volumes on the big 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.560
 crate you will have to use the arms of 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.920
 volumes 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:08.070
 for this it is necessary to open the arm the 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.840
 place in the hole reserved for this purpose 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:14.290
 unscrewed the memory ball if it is 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:17.620
 tight so as not to be embarrassed and for 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:19.750
 finish screwed on the bass drum you 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:23.170
 just put your tom in 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:25.630
 the holes reserved for this purpose for the 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:28.030
 moment it is a provisional provision 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:31.390
 we will set the battery for a 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:32.980
 best disposition afterwards a 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:36.730
 once our men are placed as 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:39.280
 this must be adjusted to this mill 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:41.830
 you have the autome acute like those 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.720
 it will be necessary to preserve and 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:45.730
 be careful that the items do not fit 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:49.330
 in direct contact between them to avoid 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:51.370
 scratches and costs you will not have 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:54.640
 more than arranging your bass tom 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:56.860
 adjust the height of the feet and place 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:59.160
 in the right place for the perfect game of 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:59.160
 drummer 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:07.580
 to mount the snare you have to 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:12.380
 open like these this part you 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:14.959
 will also have to open the foot and 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:17.290
 then arrange the two elements one 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:17.290
 in the other 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:22.610
 by opening the brackets you have the 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:28.419
 place to snare at 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:32.060
 inside you take the snare 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:34.490
 always the indication of the label of 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:38.330
 the mark towards the outside ie 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:40.100
 to the public avoid that the stamp of 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:43.880
 the snare drum is on one of the 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:45.490
 hooks and finally you will not have 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:48.650
 to screw from below 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:50.889
 the tightening screw of the foot of the body 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:50.889
 clear 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:05:00.150
 in order to set up the foot of 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:03.479
 cymbals you have to open your feet in 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:06.210
 tightening the screw place for this purpose insert 

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:09.510
 the tube in the reserved place and re 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:09.919
 series also the adjustment screw of the 

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:13.530
 height 

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:16.520
 you will only have to open your foot and 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:18.780
 have it on this side of the battery 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:21.540
 to fit the cymbal 

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:24.870
 ride for the hi-hat foot you 

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:27.419
 must first place the bindings 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:29.220
 of the pedal in the holes you 

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:31.500
 then spread the feet so that they 

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:33.389
 touch the ground as well as the element 

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:36.870
 central that is to say the pedal 

00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:38.539
 it will then be necessary to separate by drawing the 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:41.370
 stem of its location 

00:05:38.539 --> 00:05:46.440
 the place is in the hole reserved for this 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:48.870
 effect and life is completely a 

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:52.050
 time she will notice and it takes 

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:56.370
 remove the twitter replace the tube in 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:58.229
 its location puts us close 

00:05:56.370 --> 00:06:01.550
 round while waiting for the tilt hours are the 

00:05:58.229 --> 00:06:01.550
 foot not to lose it 

00:06:04.529 --> 00:06:10.009
 today I'm going to install a 

00:06:07.259 --> 00:06:13.079
 101 post kit on this battery 

00:06:10.009 --> 00:06:14.609
 it is not necessarily the kit that will be 

00:06:13.079 --> 00:06:17.459
 winter with your battery 

00:06:14.609 --> 00:06:18.569
 indeed we can use kits 

00:06:17.459 --> 00:06:20.969
 other brands 

00:06:18.569 --> 00:06:21.619
 it will not change the sound quality 

00:06:20.969 --> 00:06:25.649
 drums 

00:06:21.619 --> 00:06:27.599
 we discover an 18 inch crash that 

00:06:25.649 --> 00:06:30.989
 we will place on the foot of cymbals 

00:06:27.599 --> 00:06:31.469
 ride us lives are so the screw of 

00:06:30.989 --> 00:06:34.619
 Tightening 

00:06:31.469 --> 00:06:36.959
 we remove one of the buffers you 

00:06:34.619 --> 00:06:39.209
 see that there is still a buffer for 

00:06:36.959 --> 00:06:42.149
 protect the cymbal on the lower side 

00:06:39.209 --> 00:06:45.419
 we put the cymbal on top we put 

00:06:42.149 --> 00:06:46.799
 the stamp and the screw to finish you 

00:06:45.419 --> 00:06:49.319
 do not have to squeeze hard 

00:06:46.799 --> 00:06:50.749
 it's enough for the cymbal to hold 

00:06:49.319 --> 00:06:53.609
 they do not need to be completely 

00:06:50.749 --> 00:06:56.189
 maintained by the foot you will replace 

00:06:53.609 --> 00:06:58.859
 then your foot two symbols and you 

00:06:56.189 --> 00:07:01.499
 adjust ray so that the height is 

00:06:58.859 --> 00:07:03.959
 comfortable for the second drummer 

00:07:01.499 --> 00:07:07.139
 cymbals and the hi-hat cymbal which 

00:07:03.959 --> 00:07:08.879
 is it composed of two symbols on 

00:07:07.139 --> 00:07:13.079
 his cymbals are indicated mentions 

00:07:08.879 --> 00:07:15.689
 top which means the symbol of the top and 

00:07:13.079 --> 00:07:18.479
 there on the second bottom that indicates the 

00:07:15.689 --> 00:07:20.909
 lower cymbal we will place 

00:07:18.479 --> 00:07:24.479
 so the first cymbals indicated bottom 

00:07:20.909 --> 00:07:26.489
 on the foot then open by unscrewing 

00:07:24.479 --> 00:07:29.369
 the tilt hours remove one of the foams 

00:07:26.489 --> 00:07:31.439
 timing square cymbal in 

00:07:29.369 --> 00:07:33.959
 put back the moss and finally 

00:07:31.439 --> 00:07:36.689
 tightened the screw you can then 

00:07:33.959 --> 00:07:39.449
 adjust the cymbal using the screw 

00:07:36.689 --> 00:07:41.219
 from above your Charleston symbol is 

00:07:39.449 --> 00:07:44.849
 so installed you will only have 

00:07:41.219 --> 00:07:48.499
 adjust the height of the cymbals and 

00:07:44.849 --> 00:07:48.499
 foot to adjust to your game
