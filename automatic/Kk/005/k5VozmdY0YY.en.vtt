it now back in the showy and it's great
every<00:00:56.340> time<00:00:56.520> we<00:00:56.610> get<00:00:56.730> a<00:00:56.790> new<00:00:56.940> model<00:00:57.270> it's<00:00:57.750> so

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
every time we get a new model it's so

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.840 
every time we get a new model it's so
much<00:00:58.140> better<00:00:58.290> than<00:00:58.560> the<00:00:58.680> last<00:00:58.860> one<00:00:59.190> and<00:00:59.370> just

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
much better than the last one and just

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:00.980 
much better than the last one and just
when<00:01:00.030> you<00:01:00.120> don't<00:01:00.270> think<00:01:00.450> you<00:01:00.510> can<00:01:00.600> get<00:01:00.780> any

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:00.990 
when you don't think you can get any

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:02.960 
when you don't think you can get any
better<00:01:01.200> it<00:01:01.740> seems<00:01:02.010> to<00:01:02.280> get<00:01:02.430> better<00:01:02.580> every<00:01:02.940> time

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:02.970 
better it seems to get better every time

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:05.690 
better it seems to get better every time
so<00:01:03.540> for<00:01:04.140> me<00:01:04.260> on<00:01:04.380> the<00:01:04.500> racetrack<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:05.220> I<00:01:05.250> port

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
so for me on the racetrack the I port

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.270 
so for me on the racetrack the I port
the<00:01:05.880> vision<00:01:06.240> it<00:01:06.590> seems<00:01:07.590> to<00:01:07.680> be<00:01:07.740> larger<00:01:08.160> at

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
the vision it seems to be larger at

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.450 
the vision it seems to be larger at
least<00:01:08.460> increased<00:01:08.970> on<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.240> top<00:01:09.420> side<00:01:09.690> so<00:01:10.560> that

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
least increased on the top side so that

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.710 
least increased on the top side so that
definitely<00:01:11.670> helps<00:01:12.030> out<00:01:12.180> when<00:01:12.360> you're<00:01:12.510> tucked

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
definitely helps out when you're tucked

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.510 
definitely helps out when you're tucked
in<00:01:12.869> behind<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.290> fairing<00:01:13.680> and<00:01:13.830> definitely<00:01:14.460> the

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
in behind the fairing and definitely the

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.280 
in behind the fairing and definitely the
cooling<00:01:14.910> system<00:01:14.940> works<00:01:15.810> better<00:01:16.080> than<00:01:16.200> this

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
cooling system works better than this

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.080 
cooling system works better than this
helmet<00:01:16.619> that<00:01:16.710> helmet<00:01:17.070> I've<00:01:17.280> ever<00:01:17.430> worn<00:01:17.700> so

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.620 
helmet that helmet I've ever worn so
it's<00:01:18.600> important<00:01:19.140> you<00:01:19.680> know<00:01:19.770> here<00:01:20.330> it<00:01:21.330> probably

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
it's important you know here it probably

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.390 
it's important you know here it probably
won't<00:01:22.020> be<00:01:22.110> such<00:01:22.320> a<00:01:22.350> big<00:01:22.590> deal<00:01:22.710> here<00:01:22.950> at<00:01:22.979> Laguna

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
won't be such a big deal here at Laguna

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.090 
won't be such a big deal here at Laguna

these hot races when it's 100 plus that
cooling<00:01:31.560> system<00:01:31.920> really<00:01:32.100> helps<00:01:32.430> out<00:01:32.550> a<00:01:32.610> lot<00:01:32.729> so

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:33.300 
cooling system really helps out a lot so

tricks<00:02:24.980> did<00:02:25.550> a<00:02:25.610> great<00:02:26.060> job<00:02:26.090> of<00:02:26.709> making<00:02:27.709> I<00:02:28.370> think

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
tricks did a great job of making I think

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:30.160 
tricks did a great job of making I think
one<00:02:29.209> of<00:02:29.240> the<00:02:29.330> best<00:02:29.450> like<00:02:29.600> a<00:02:29.690> helmet<00:02:29.870> on<00:02:30.110> the

there<00:02:33.050> but<00:02:33.620> in<00:02:33.860> general<00:02:34.130> the<00:02:35.090> x12<00:02:35.540> is<00:02:35.750> a<00:02:35.900> big

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
there but in general the x12 is a big

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.090 
there but in general the x12 is a big
improvement<00:02:36.380> over<00:02:36.739> the<00:02:36.920> x11<00:02:37.630> honestly<00:02:38.630> just

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
improvement over the x11 honestly just

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.610 
improvement over the x11 honestly just
the<00:02:40.100> way<00:02:40.250> it<00:02:40.370> fits<00:02:40.610> the<00:02:41.450> quietness<00:02:41.900> of<00:02:42.050> it<00:02:42.440> and

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
the way it fits the quietness of it and

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.500 
the way it fits the quietness of it and
the<00:02:42.980> eye<00:02:43.010> part<00:02:43.489> when<00:02:43.790> you<00:02:43.820> look<00:02:44.030> around<00:02:44.150> you

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
the eye part when you look around you

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:45.970 
the eye part when you look around you
know<00:02:44.600> I<00:02:44.630> didn't<00:02:44.959> realize<00:02:45.260> the<00:02:45.470> improvement

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
know I didn't realize the improvement

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.030 
know I didn't realize the improvement
until<00:02:46.970> they<00:02:47.120> gave<00:02:47.450> me<00:02:47.660> one<00:02:47.840> out<00:02:48.050> of<00:02:48.170> tests<00:02:48.410> and

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
until they gave me one out of tests and

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.650 
until they gave me one out of tests and
they<00:02:49.459> actually<00:02:49.610> took<00:02:49.910> it<00:02:49.970> away<00:02:50.150> the<00:02:50.390> next<00:02:50.540> day

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
they actually took it away the next day

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.960 
they actually took it away the next day
and<00:02:50.750> I<00:02:50.930> rode<00:02:51.140> with<00:02:51.290> the<00:02:51.320> next<00:02:51.590> 11<00:02:51.830> and<00:02:52.519> I

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
and I rode with the next 11 and I

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:54.250 
and I rode with the next 11 and I
thought<00:02:53.209> I<00:02:53.239> had<00:02:53.450> the<00:02:53.540> best<00:02:53.660> helmet<00:02:54.080> and<00:02:54.140> I

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
thought I had the best helmet and I

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.229 
thought I had the best helmet and I
realized<00:02:54.650> why<00:02:55.220> was<00:02:55.400> a<00:02:55.430> big<00:02:55.670> difference<00:02:56.090> and<00:02:56.209> I

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:56.239 
realized why was a big difference and I

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:58.030 
realized why was a big difference and I
wanted<00:02:56.420> to<00:02:56.510> x<00:02:56.660> 12<00:02:56.959> back<00:02:57.140> and<00:02:57.350> I<00:02:57.410> did<00:02:57.620> literally

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
wanted to x 12 back and I did literally

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.170 
wanted to x 12 back and I did literally
give<00:02:58.250> it<00:02:58.340> back<00:02:58.489> as<00:02:58.700> it<00:02:58.730> was<00:02:58.820> the<00:02:58.970> only<00:02:59.120> one<00:02:59.390> so<00:03:00.320> I

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
give it back as it was the only one so I

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.390 
give it back as it was the only one so I
vouch<00:03:02.180> for<00:03:02.540> it<00:03:02.660> the<00:03:03.290> x11<00:03:03.709> I<00:03:04.010> thought<00:03:04.190> was<00:03:04.310> the

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
vouch for it the x11 I thought was the

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:05.830 
vouch for it the x11 I thought was the
best<00:03:04.430> moment<00:03:04.730> that<00:03:05.030> they<00:03:05.120> have<00:03:05.239> improved<00:03:05.570> the

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:36.410 
thought that was pretty cool it was 11
it<00:05:34.620> could<00:05:34.770> be<00:05:34.890> anybody<00:05:35.280> else<00:05:35.370> but<00:05:36.240> in<00:05:36.360> this

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:36.420 
it could be anybody else but in this

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:38.720 
it could be anybody else but in this
case<00:05:36.630> it's<00:05:36.870> a<00:05:36.930> 155<00:05:37.530> and<00:05:37.770> that<00:05:37.980> is<00:05:38.190> a<00:05:38.400> ben

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:38.730 
case it's a 155 and that is a ben

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:41.360 
case it's a 155 and that is a ben
bostrom<00:05:38.940> fan<00:05:39.390> so<00:05:39.660> it<00:05:40.290> kind<00:05:40.680> of<00:05:40.770> stuck<00:05:40.830> and<00:05:41.310> I

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:41.370 
bostrom fan so it kind of stuck and I

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:44.360
