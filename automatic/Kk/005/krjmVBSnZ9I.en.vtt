00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
fact AG s is truck rating is a little

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.170 
fact AG s is truck rating is a little
more<00:02:49.650> stricter<00:02:50.160> than<00:02:50.280> GI<00:02:50.520> A's

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
more stricter than GI A's

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.920 
more stricter than GI A's
but<00:02:52.020> you<00:02:52.410> go<00:02:52.560> side<00:02:52.770> by<00:02:52.800> side<00:02:53.250> however<00:02:53.790> but<00:02:54.780> me

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
but you go side by side however but me

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.680 
but you go side by side however but me
it<00:02:55.290> would<00:02:55.440> be<00:02:55.560> between<00:02:55.770> this<00:02:56.220> one<00:02:56.460> and<00:02:56.690> the

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
it would be between this one and the

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.930 
it would be between this one and the
soleus<00:02:57.930> fara<00:02:58.320> we're<00:02:59.190> gonna<00:02:59.280> do<00:02:59.490> is<00:02:59.640> we're

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
gonna go into the other lighting

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.020 
gonna go into the other lighting
environments<00:03:01.860> and<00:03:02.100> look<00:03:02.250> at<00:03:02.370> the<00:03:02.490> optics<00:03:02.880> as

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
environments and look at the optics as

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:04.670 
environments and look at the optics as
well<00:03:03.270> and<00:03:03.930> then<00:03:04.050> you<00:03:04.080> know<00:03:04.200> make<00:03:04.380> it<00:03:04.410> my

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
well and then you know make it my

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
frankly they're all beautiful can't go

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.510 
frankly they're all beautiful can't go
wrong<00:03:09.690> with<00:03:09.840> any<00:03:09.960> of<00:03:10.170> these<00:03:10.290> all<00:03:11.100> right<00:03:11.280> let's

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:11.520 
wrong with any of these all right let's

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:17.150 
wrong with any of these all right let's
go<00:03:11.670> into<00:03:11.940> spot<00:03:12.330> lighting<00:03:13.580> okay<00:03:15.860> this<00:03:16.860> is<00:03:17.040> the

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
go into spot lighting okay this is the

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.270 
go into spot lighting okay this is the
dim<00:03:17.370> spot<00:03:17.730> lighting<00:03:18.120> environment<00:03:18.750> oh<00:03:19.010> my<00:03:20.010> dear

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
dim spot lighting environment oh my dear

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.100 
dim spot lighting environment oh my dear
I<00:03:20.400> should<00:03:20.460> say<00:03:20.700> my<00:03:20.850> dimmer<00:03:21.120> spot<00:03:21.720> lighting

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
I should say my dimmer spot lighting

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:25.580 
I should say my dimmer spot lighting
environment<00:03:22.710> and<00:03:23.630> we're<00:03:24.630> seeing<00:03:24.870> all<00:03:25.260> right

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
environment and we're seeing all right

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:30.500 
environment and we're seeing all right
now<00:03:26.720> Sparkle<00:03:27.720> scintillation<00:03:28.650> and<00:03:28.890> fire<00:03:29.820> and

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
now Sparkle scintillation and fire and

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:35.630 
now Sparkle scintillation and fire and
these<00:03:30.660> guys

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.390 

and<00:03:35.880> the<00:03:36.570> two<00:03:36.780> round<00:03:37.260> brilliant<00:03:37.500> cuts<00:03:37.920> pretty

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
and the two round brilliant cuts pretty

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.860 
and the two round brilliant cuts pretty
pretty<00:03:38.820> comparable<00:03:39.270> I<00:03:41.030> think<00:03:42.030> we<00:03:42.240> do<00:03:42.450> see<00:03:42.690> a

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
pretty comparable I think we do see a

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:44.360 
pretty comparable I think we do see a
visible<00:03:43.140> difference<00:03:43.410> going<00:03:44.040> through<00:03:44.310> the

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
visible difference going through the

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:48.110 
visible difference going through the
Solus<00:03:44.730> para<00:03:45.000> here<00:03:46.580> you<00:03:47.580> know<00:03:47.670> I<00:03:47.700> wanted<00:03:48.060> to

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
Solus para here you know I wanted to

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.440 
Solus para here you know I wanted to
acquire<00:03:48.540> this<00:03:48.930> shoot<00:03:49.710> because<00:03:50.040> I<00:03:50.460> know<00:03:50.520> that

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
acquire this shoot because I know that

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:52.730 
acquire this shoot because I know that
if<00:03:51.540> you<00:03:51.660> want<00:03:51.900> wanting<00:03:52.230> to<00:03:52.290> do<00:03:52.440> something

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:52.740 
if you want wanting to do something

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:55.220 
if you want wanting to do something
little<00:03:52.800> different<00:03:53.180> the<00:03:54.180> soleus<00:03:54.510> para<00:03:54.750> surely

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
little different the soleus para surely

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.040 
little different the soleus para surely
does<00:03:55.500> fit<00:03:55.770> that<00:03:55.920> bill<00:03:56.190> and<00:03:56.820> as<00:03:57.300> if<00:03:57.450> surely<00:03:58.020> a

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:58.050 
does fit that bill and as if surely a

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:02.020 
does fit that bill and as if surely a
very<00:03:58.410> visibly<00:03:59.370> pleasing<00:04:00.080> diamond<00:04:01.080> as<00:04:01.200> well

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.030 
very visibly pleasing diamond as well

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:05.960 
very visibly pleasing diamond as well
okay<00:04:03.800> now<00:04:04.800> we're<00:04:04.950> gonna<00:04:05.010> go<00:04:05.130> into<00:04:05.340> stronger

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
okay now we're gonna go into stronger

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:12.020 
okay now we're gonna go into stronger
spotlighting<00:04:06.600> oh<00:04:08.030> boy<00:04:09.030> now<00:04:10.760> this<00:04:11.760> is<00:04:11.880> just

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
spotlighting oh boy now this is just

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.300 
spotlighting oh boy now this is just
moving<00:04:12.300> the<00:04:12.540> light<00:04:12.750> over<00:04:13.560> the<00:04:13.740> diamonds<00:04:14.190> as

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
moving the light over the diamonds as

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:23.560 
moving the light over the diamonds as
they<00:04:14.490> remain<00:04:14.820> static<00:04:17.180> both<00:04:19.850> really<00:04:20.850> good<00:04:21.530> but

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:23.570 
they remain static both really good but

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:45.279 
they remain static both really good but
there<00:04:24.570> are<00:04:24.810> some<00:04:25.080> visible<00:04:25.500> differences<00:04:26.010> now

00:04:45.279 --> 00:04:45.289 

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:47.899 

and<00:04:46.289> you<00:04:46.439> know<00:04:46.560> even<00:04:46.889> have<00:04:47.009> to<00:04:47.129> continue<00:04:47.699> to

00:04:47.899 --> 00:04:47.909 
and you know even have to continue to

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:49.790 
and you know even have to continue to
look<00:04:48.060> in<00:04:48.270> these<00:04:48.389> lighting<00:04:48.840> conditions<00:04:49.379> if<00:04:49.650> I

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 
look in these lighting conditions if I

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.589 
look in these lighting conditions if I
would<00:04:50.490> still<00:04:50.789> stick<00:04:51.030> with<00:04:51.090> what<00:04:51.419> I<00:04:51.449> originally

00:04:51.589 --> 00:04:51.599 
would still stick with what I originally

00:04:51.599 --> 00:04:53.809 
would still stick with what I originally
said<00:04:52.169> if<00:04:52.259> I<00:04:52.349> was<00:04:52.469> choosing<00:04:52.680> between<00:04:52.949> the<00:04:53.490> the

00:04:53.809 --> 00:04:53.819 
said if I was choosing between the the

00:04:53.819 --> 00:04:57.800 
said if I was choosing between the the
57<00:04:54.509> facets<00:04:55.819> heck<00:04:56.819> I<00:04:56.939> just<00:04:57.150> get<00:04:57.300> the<00:04:57.419> larger<00:04:57.780> one

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:57.810 
57 facets heck I just get the larger one

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:01.550 
57 facets heck I just get the larger one
otherwise<00:04:58.879> between<00:04:59.879> this<00:05:00.180> one<00:05:00.419> and<00:05:00.560> the

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:01.560 
otherwise between this one and the

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:02.510 
otherwise between this one and the
soulless<00:05:01.919> parrot

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:02.520 
soulless parrot

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:03.860 
soulless parrot
now<00:05:02.789> what<00:05:02.969> we're<00:05:03.090> going<00:05:03.180> to<00:05:03.240> do<00:05:03.360> is<00:05:03.509> gonna<00:05:03.689> go

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:03.870 
now what we're going to do is gonna go

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:07.999 
now what we're going to do is gonna go
by<00:05:04.020> the<00:05:04.050> window<00:05:06.319> just<00:05:07.319> give<00:05:07.500> you<00:05:07.590> kind<00:05:07.770> of<00:05:07.889> a

00:05:07.999 --> 00:05:08.009 
by the window just give you kind of a

00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:11.439 
by the window just give you kind of a
bird's<00:05:08.250> eye<00:05:08.430> view<00:05:08.460> and<00:05:09.000> natural<00:05:09.569> daylight

00:05:11.439 --> 00:05:11.449 
bird's eye view and natural daylight

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:17.649 
bird's eye view and natural daylight
okay<00:05:12.449> and<00:05:13.110> last<00:05:13.349> but<00:05:13.530> not<00:05:13.680> least<00:05:13.949> we're<00:05:14.250> here

00:05:17.649 --> 00:05:17.659 

00:05:17.659 --> 00:05:21.050 

and<00:05:18.800> it's<00:05:19.800> pretty<00:05:19.949> easy<00:05:20.159> to<00:05:20.340> see<00:05:20.580> which<00:05:20.789> ones

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:21.060 
and it's pretty easy to see which ones

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:21.850 
and it's pretty easy to see which ones
which

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:21.860 
which

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:24.260 
which
so<00:05:22.860> you<00:05:22.919> got<00:05:23.129> the<00:05:23.250> soulless<00:05:23.639> Farrah<00:05:23.909> on<00:05:24.120> the

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:24.270 
so you got the soulless Farrah on the

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:26.689 
so you got the soulless Farrah on the
left<00:05:24.479> and<00:05:24.810> quite<00:05:25.500> literally<00:05:25.919> and<00:05:26.250> lights<00:05:26.490> up

00:05:26.689 --> 00:05:26.699 
left and quite literally and lights up
