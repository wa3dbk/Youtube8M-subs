00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
rivet made the first step to exporting

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.890 
rivet made the first step to exporting
it<00:00:25.680> is<00:00:25.830> to<00:00:26.250> turn<00:00:26.430> it<00:00:26.580> into<00:00:26.789> a<00:00:26.939> 3d<00:00:27.420> viewport

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
it is to turn it into a 3d viewport

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.529 
it is to turn it into a 3d viewport
click<00:00:28.680> 3d<00:00:28.980> here<00:00:29.220> you<00:00:29.609> got<00:00:29.760> our<00:00:29.880> house<00:00:30.090> in<00:00:30.269> 3d

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
click 3d here you got our house in 3d

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.220 
click 3d here you got our house in 3d
when<00:00:30.720> you<00:00:30.810> export<00:00:31.199> it<00:00:31.320> in<00:00:31.640> in<00:00:32.640> 2d<00:00:33.090> it<00:00:33.899> will<00:00:34.079> come

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
when you export it in in 2d it will come

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.319 
when you export it in in 2d it will come
in<00:00:34.380> to<00:00:34.500> visit<00:00:34.680> as<00:00:34.920> a<00:00:34.950> 2d<00:00:35.309> autocad<00:00:35.760> file<00:00:36.000> but<00:00:36.239> if

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
with that that is really not the route

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.280 
with that that is really not the route
to<00:01:14.760> go<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:15.509> route<00:01:15.689> to<00:01:15.930> go<00:01:15.960> is<00:01:16.320> filing<00:01:16.650> manager

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:18.290 
to go the route to go is filing manager

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:22.399 
to go the route to go is filing manager
you'll<00:01:19.290> use<00:01:19.530> fuels<00:01:20.130> hit<00:01:20.400> file<00:01:21.200> there<00:01:22.200> it<00:01:22.350> is

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
you'll use fuels hit file there it is

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.760 
you'll use fuels hit file there it is
right<00:01:22.470> there<00:01:22.680> there's<00:01:23.189> a<00:01:23.280> building<00:01:23.630> open<00:01:24.770> make

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
right there there's a building open make

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.249 
right there there's a building open make
sure<00:01:25.799> that<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.400> preset<00:01:26.820> rivet<00:01:27.360> is<00:01:27.540> selected

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
sure that the preset rivet is selected

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.499 
sure that the preset rivet is selected
and<00:01:28.409> hit<00:01:29.340> attach<00:01:29.610> this<00:01:29.790> file<00:01:30.030> will<00:01:30.270> take<00:01:30.479> a

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
and hit attach this file will take a

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.130 
and hit attach this file will take a
little<00:01:31.409> bit<00:01:31.560> but<00:01:31.979> I<00:01:32.630> might<00:01:33.630> have<00:01:33.810> a<00:01:33.840> little

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
little bit but I might have a little

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.370 
little bit but I might have a little
faster<00:01:34.500> than<00:01:34.650> average<00:01:34.950> computer<00:01:35.250> but

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
faster than average computer but

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.569 
faster than average computer but
especially<00:01:37.380> if<00:01:37.740> it's<00:01:37.890> a<00:01:37.950> huge<00:01:38.130> project<00:01:38.340> you

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
especially if it's a huge project you

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:39.710 
especially if it's a huge project you
will<00:01:38.670> take<00:01:38.820> much<00:01:38.970> longer<00:01:39.000> you<00:01:39.390> can<00:01:39.540> see<00:01:39.689> that

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
will take much longer you can see that

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.039 
will take much longer you can see that

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
turn it up a little bit but i'm not sure

turn it up a little bit but i'm not sure
what<00:02:29.230> a<00:02:29.290> good<00:02:29.470> number<00:02:29.650> is<00:02:29.890> maybe<00:02:30.190> somebody<00:02:30.580> can

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
what a good number is maybe somebody can

down<00:02:36.630> 2.1<00:02:37.630> i<00:02:37.840> found<00:02:38.110> that<00:02:38.260> to<00:02:38.470> be<00:02:38.500> a<00:02:38.680> really

down 2.1 i found that to be a really

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
good number curve steps 20 this will

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.370 
good number curve steps 20 this will
increase<00:02:42.520> the<00:02:42.730> time<00:02:42.940> it<00:02:43.090> takes<00:02:43.240> to<00:02:43.420> unload<00:02:44.020> to

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
increase the time it takes to unload to

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:48.060 
increase the time it takes to unload to
bring<00:02:44.560> it<00:02:44.650> in<00:02:44.770> but<00:02:45.990> but<00:02:46.990> it<00:02:47.110> will<00:02:47.260> smooth<00:02:47.920> out

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.070 
bring it in but but it will smooth out

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:50.990 
bring it in but but it will smooth out
everything<00:02:48.670> look<00:02:48.880> that<00:02:49.120> the<00:02:50.050> toilet<00:02:50.230> changed

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
everything look that the toilet changed

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:58.820 
everything look that the toilet changed

nice<00:03:06.520> now<00:03:06.550> the<00:03:07.800> smoothing<00:03:08.800> property<00:03:09.190> still

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
nice now the smoothing property still

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:12.120 
nice now the smoothing property still
aren't<00:03:09.820> as<00:03:10.050> good<00:03:11.050> as<00:03:11.200> it<00:03:11.380> would<00:03:11.800> be<00:03:11.830> if<00:03:12.100> you

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:16.600 
lot of time if you export in the import
