right<00:00:45.300> into<00:00:45.539> place<00:00:45.719> and<00:00:46.579> now<00:00:47.579> you<00:00:47.640> have<00:00:48.239> a

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.100 
right into place and now you have a

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:57.229 
right into place and now you have a
beautiful<00:00:50.100> lightweight<00:00:55.789> so<00:00:56.789> let<00:00:57.000> me<00:00:57.059> show<00:00:57.210> you

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
beautiful lightweight so let me show you

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.349 
beautiful lightweight so let me show you
the<00:00:57.390> most<00:00:57.539> important<00:00:57.989> part<00:00:58.230> which<00:00:59.000> is<00:01:00.000> how<00:01:00.300> to

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
the most important part which is how to

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.329 
the most important part which is how to
coil<00:01:00.750> it<00:01:00.930> back<00:01:01.050> down<00:01:01.289> so<00:01:02.000> you<00:01:03.000> just<00:01:03.239> open<00:01:03.510> it

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339 
coil it back down so you just open it

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:06.410 
coil it back down so you just open it
now<00:01:05.339> if<00:01:05.460> you<00:01:05.519> try<00:01:05.700> to<00:01:05.760> sit<00:01:05.970> here<00:01:06.119> and<00:01:06.240> fight

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
now if you try to sit here and fight

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.730 
now if you try to sit here and fight
with<00:01:06.570> it<00:01:06.689> like<00:01:06.810> this<00:01:07.049> I<00:01:07.290> mean<00:01:07.530> look<00:01:07.710> how

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
with it like this I mean look how

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.230 
with it like this I mean look how
awkward<00:01:07.979> that<00:01:08.189> is<00:01:08.400> there's<00:01:08.610> no<00:01:08.670> way<00:01:08.880> just<00:01:09.030> keep

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
awkward that is there's no way just keep

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.789 
awkward that is there's no way just keep
it<00:01:09.390> in<00:01:09.479> place<00:01:09.750> just<00:01:09.780> gonna<00:01:10.320> keep<00:01:10.530> trying<00:01:10.740> to

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
it in place just gonna keep trying to

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.890 
it in place just gonna keep trying to
fly<00:01:11.040> out<00:01:11.250> on<00:01:11.280> you<00:01:11.729> so<00:01:12.390> you<00:01:12.479> don't<00:01:12.570> want<00:01:12.750> to<00:01:12.810> do

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
fly out on you so you don't want to do

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.300 
fly out on you so you don't want to do
that<00:01:13.020> here's<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.530> way<00:01:13.650> I<00:01:13.680> do<00:01:13.799> it

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
that here's the way I do it

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.820 
that here's the way I do it
I<00:01:14.720> call<00:01:15.720> it<00:01:15.869> over<00:01:15.990> just<00:01:16.350> enough<00:01:16.560> to<00:01:16.710> where

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
I call it over just enough to where

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.149 
I call it over just enough to where
there's<00:01:16.979> a<00:01:17.040> double<00:01:18.020> line<00:01:19.020> right<00:01:19.229> there<00:01:19.439> and<00:01:20.040> I

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
there's a double line right there and I

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.090 
there's a double line right there and I
actually<00:01:20.549> secure<00:01:20.909> it<00:01:21.000> under<00:01:21.600> my<00:01:21.720> foot<00:01:22.100> like

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
actually secure it under my foot like

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.770 
actually secure it under my foot like
that<00:01:23.159> that<00:01:23.549> way<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:23.790> circle<00:01:24.090> stays<00:01:24.330> in<00:01:24.570> place

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
that that way the circle stays in place

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.140 
that that way the circle stays in place
then<00:01:25.500> I<00:01:25.560> just<00:01:25.770> grab<00:01:26.009> both<00:01:26.189> ends<00:01:26.670> and<00:01:26.790> pull

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
then I just grab both ends and pull

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.149 
then I just grab both ends and pull
tight<00:01:28.670> until<00:01:29.670> it's<00:01:30.000> cooled<00:01:30.270> down<00:01:30.360> enough<00:01:30.509> to

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:31.159 
tight until it's cooled down enough to

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:33.560 
tight until it's cooled down enough to
where<00:01:32.159> I'm<00:01:32.400> gonna<00:01:32.520> be<00:01:32.700> able<00:01:32.820> to<00:01:32.970> connect<00:01:33.450> the

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
where I'm gonna be able to connect the

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:39.469 
where I'm gonna be able to connect the
top<00:01:33.750> pieces<00:01:36.439> and<00:01:37.610> you're<00:01:38.610> gonna<00:01:38.729> feel<00:01:38.970> scared

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
top pieces and you're gonna feel scared

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.090 
top pieces and you're gonna feel scared
like<00:01:39.659> you're<00:01:40.140> gonna<00:01:40.320> break<00:01:40.530> it<00:01:40.590> or<00:01:40.799> something

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
like you're gonna break it or something

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.929 
like you're gonna break it or something
but<00:01:41.340> you<00:01:41.820> won't<00:01:42.030> this<00:01:42.869> is<00:01:43.110> made<00:01:43.290> of<00:01:43.380> HDPE<00:01:44.009> which

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
but you won't this is made of HDPE which

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.539 
but you won't this is made of HDPE which
is<00:01:45.210> a<00:01:45.869> tubing<00:01:46.259> that's<00:01:46.409> pretty<00:01:46.950> much<00:01:47.100> just<00:01:47.369> as

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
is a tubing that's pretty much just as

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.819 
is a tubing that's pretty much just as
lightweight<00:01:47.759> as<00:01:48.119> polypro<00:01:48.600> but<00:01:49.470> unlike

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
lightweight as polypro but unlike

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.630 
lightweight as polypro but unlike
polypro<00:01:50.310> it's<00:01:50.579> very<00:01:50.820> durable<00:01:51.090> and<00:01:51.570> I<00:01:52.530> have<00:01:53.430> not

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
polypro it's very durable and I have not

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.660 
polypro it's very durable and I have not
managed<00:01:54.030> to<00:01:54.119> destroy<00:01:54.479> one<00:01:54.810> single<00:01:55.340> HDPE<00:01:56.340> hoop

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
managed to destroy one single HDPE hoop

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.679 
managed to destroy one single HDPE hoop
it<00:01:57.240> handles<00:01:58.049> the<00:01:58.170> cold<00:01:58.380> temperatures<00:01:58.860> better

00:01:59.679 --> 00:01:59.689 
it handles the cold temperatures better

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:02.240 
it handles the cold temperatures better
it<00:02:00.689> can<00:02:00.930> handle<00:02:01.079> being<00:02:01.409> thrown<00:02:01.740> against<00:02:02.130> a

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
it can handle being thrown against a

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.520 
it can handle being thrown against a
concrete

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
concrete

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.039 
concrete
this<00:02:04.340> is<00:02:04.490> when<00:02:04.610> I<00:02:04.640> make<00:02:04.790> my<00:02:04.909> LED<00:02:05.540> hoops<00:02:05.780> out<00:02:05.960> of

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:06.049 
this is when I make my LED hoops out of

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:08.740 
this is when I make my LED hoops out of
also<00:02:06.380> so<00:02:07.040> they<00:02:07.700> cool<00:02:07.909> down<00:02:08.149> the<00:02:08.270> same<00:02:08.450> exact

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
also so they cool down the same exact

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:11.350 
also so they cool down the same exact
way<00:02:08.929> but<00:02:09.429> anyway<00:02:10.429> I<00:02:10.459> hope<00:02:10.640> this<00:02:10.819> helped<00:02:11.150> and

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
way but anyway I hope this helped and
