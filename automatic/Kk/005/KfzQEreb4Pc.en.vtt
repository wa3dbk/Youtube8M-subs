32 bits of strapping together and from

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:58.160 
32 bits of strapping together and from
my<00:01:54.579> angle<00:01:54.909> which<00:01:55.149> is<00:01:55.179> opposite<00:01:55.750> to<00:01:55.780> you<00:01:56.520> you

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
my angle which is opposite to you you

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.080 
my angle which is opposite to you you
basically<00:01:59.170> for<00:01:59.380> that<00:01:59.500> side<00:01:59.740> on<00:02:00.219> the<00:02:00.490> top<00:02:00.729> of

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
basically for that side on the top of

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.609 
basically for that side on the top of
the<00:02:01.210> other<00:02:01.329> you<00:02:02.189> grab<00:02:03.189> them<00:02:03.340> the<00:02:03.399> strike

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
the other you grab them the strike

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:09.900 
the other you grab them the strike
you're<00:02:06.630> just<00:02:07.630> going<00:02:08.019> like<00:02:08.049> that<00:02:08.910> and

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
you're just going like that and

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:11.670 
you're just going like that and
