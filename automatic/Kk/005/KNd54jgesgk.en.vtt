00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:02.370 
hi this is Campbell and I'll be demoing

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:04.610 
hi this is Campbell and I'll be demoing
a<00:00:02.850> new<00:00:03.449> feature<00:00:03.689> I've<00:00:03.990> been<00:00:04.140> working<00:00:04.440> on<00:00:04.529> the

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:04.620 
a new feature I've been working on the

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.020 
a new feature I've been working on the
past<00:00:04.830> few<00:00:05.040> days<00:00:05.190> so<00:00:05.990> this<00:00:06.990> is<00:00:07.170> a<00:00:07.770> way<00:00:08.760> to<00:00:08.790> do

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
past few days so this is a way to do

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.720 
past few days so this is a way to do
painting<00:00:09.540> it<00:00:10.469> shares<00:00:11.130> a<00:00:11.190> lot<00:00:11.280> of<00:00:11.460> the<00:00:11.550> code

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
painting it shares a lot of the code

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.089 
painting it shares a lot of the code
with<00:00:11.880> projection<00:00:12.360> painting<00:00:12.750> but<00:00:13.710> it<00:00:13.889> means

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
with projection painting but it means

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:15.259 
with projection painting but it means
you<00:00:14.190> don't<00:00:14.370> have<00:00:14.519> to<00:00:14.610> use<00:00:14.730> blenders<00:00:15.059> plane

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
you don't have to use blenders plane

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.429 
you don't have to use blenders plane
tools<00:00:15.509> so<00:00:16.910> all<00:00:17.910> these<00:00:18.090> are<00:00:18.420> include<00:00:18.990> normal

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
tools so all these are include normal

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.050 
tools so all these are include normal
these<00:00:19.740> sort<00:00:19.980> of<00:00:20.039> features<00:00:20.369> that<00:00:20.400> are<00:00:20.580> used<00:00:20.850> but

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
these sort of features that are used but

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.400 
these sort of features that are used but
there's<00:00:21.330> these<00:00:21.480> two<00:00:21.539> buttons<00:00:21.869> here<00:00:22.140> that<00:00:22.199> I've

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
there's these two buttons here that I've

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.160 
there's these two buttons here that I've
added<00:00:22.560> a<00:00:22.680> view<00:00:22.949> edit<00:00:23.220> and<00:00:23.400> apply<00:00:23.869> so<00:00:24.869> you<00:00:24.900> just

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
added a view edit and apply so you just

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.830 
added a view edit and apply so you just
click<00:00:25.410> on<00:00:25.529> view<00:00:25.769> edit<00:00:26.090> it<00:00:27.090> takes<00:00:27.300> this<00:00:27.539> image

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
click on view edit it takes this image

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.009 
click on view edit it takes this image
here<00:00:28.050> opens<00:00:28.590> it<00:00:28.710> in<00:00:28.800> the<00:00:28.920> GIMP<00:00:29.779> so<00:00:30.779> you<00:00:30.840> make<00:00:30.990> a

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
here opens it in the GIMP so you make a

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.889 
here opens it in the GIMP so you make a
new<00:00:31.199> layer<00:00:31.320> on<00:00:31.500> top<00:00:31.590> of<00:00:31.710> this<00:00:31.859> and<00:00:32.420> I<00:00:33.420> can

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
new layer on top of this and I can

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.180 
new layer on top of this and I can
pretend<00:00:34.050> to<00:00:34.230> be<00:00:34.380> artistic<00:00:34.800> with<00:00:34.890> this<00:00:35.010> but

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
pretend to be artistic with this but

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:42.680 
pretend to be artistic with this but
I'll<00:00:35.280> just<00:00:35.309> do<00:00:35.610> something<00:00:35.790> very<00:00:36.090> quick<00:00:40.100> and<00:00:41.690> if

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
I'll just do something very quick and if

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.860 
I'll just do something very quick and if
you<00:00:42.809> turn<00:00:43.020> this<00:00:43.140> layer<00:00:43.350> off<00:00:43.410> so<00:00:44.100> it's<00:00:44.250> only<00:00:44.870> any

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
you turn this layer off so it's only any

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.240 
you turn this layer off so it's only any
painting<00:00:47.270> over<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.480> Alpha<00:00:48.690> Channel<00:00:48.989> and

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:49.250 
painting over the Alpha Channel and

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:54.049 
painting over the Alpha Channel and
apply<00:00:50.329> reloads<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.420> image<00:00:51.719> and<00:00:52.050> it<00:00:53.059> projects

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
apply reloads the image and it projects

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.299 
apply reloads the image and it projects
it<00:00:54.149> onto<00:00:54.270> you<00:00:54.629> onto<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:54.960> model<00:00:55.100> so<00:00:56.100> you<00:00:56.190> can

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
it onto you onto the model so you can

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.029 
it onto you onto the model so you can
see<00:00:56.520> it's<00:00:56.730> using<00:00:56.910> occlusion<00:00:57.510> here<00:00:58.039> between

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
see it's using occlusion here between

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.010 
see it's using occlusion here between
these<00:00:59.370> two<00:00:59.550> points<00:00:59.760> and<00:01:00.059> it's<00:01:00.359> got<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:00.840> normal

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
these two points and it's got the normal

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.709 
these two points and it's got the normal
fall<00:01:01.320> off<00:01:01.469> there<00:01:01.739> it<00:01:02.309> also<00:01:02.489> does<00:01:02.789> UV<00:01:03.149> seems<00:01:03.480> so

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
fall off there it also does UV seems so

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.359 
fall off there it also does UV seems so
if<00:01:03.780> you<00:01:03.870> paint<00:01:04.080> over<00:01:04.199> UV<00:01:04.589> seems<00:01:04.890> you<00:01:05.040> won't<00:01:05.220> get

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
if you paint over UV seems you won't get

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.200 
if you paint over UV seems you won't get
nasty<00:01:05.880> sort<00:01:06.810> of<00:01:06.900> lines<00:01:07.560> between<00:01:07.860> them<00:01:08.159> and<00:01:08.340> you

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
nasty sort of lines between them and you

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.850 
nasty sort of lines between them and you
can<00:01:09.360> see<00:01:09.570> that<00:01:09.840> it<00:01:10.049> doesn't<00:01:10.470> drop<00:01:10.740> the

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
can see that it doesn't drop the

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.530 
can see that it doesn't drop the
resolution<00:01:11.400> of<00:01:11.640> what<00:01:11.850> it's<00:01:11.970> not<00:01:12.090> painting<00:01:12.420> on

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
resolution of what it's not painting on

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.140 
resolution of what it's not painting on
to<00:01:12.720> so<00:01:13.140> even<00:01:13.290> though<00:01:13.500> it's<00:01:13.680> very<00:01:13.979> very<00:01:14.850> coarse

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
to so even though it's very very coarse

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.510 
to so even though it's very very coarse
resolution<00:01:15.360> here<00:01:16.850> it's<00:01:18.740> it's<00:01:19.740> still<00:01:20.250> high

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
resolution here it's it's still high

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.370 
resolution here it's it's still high
resolution<00:01:21.060> beneath<00:01:21.270> you<00:01:21.689> can<00:01:21.900> actually<00:01:22.229> see

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
resolution beneath you can actually see

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.370 
resolution beneath you can actually see
you<00:01:22.500> could<00:01:22.710> scale<00:01:23.280> this<00:01:23.490> I<00:01:23.759> can<00:01:23.939> do<00:01:24.060> it<00:01:24.360> now<00:01:24.509> you

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
you could scale this I can do it now you

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.170 
you could scale this I can do it now you
can<00:01:25.560> scale<00:01:25.860> the<00:01:26.040> image<00:01:26.130> to<00:01:26.610> be<00:01:27.110> twice<00:01:28.110> as<00:01:28.170> big

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.180 
can scale the image to be twice as big

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:34.460 
can scale the image to be twice as big
200<00:01:30.180> percent

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.700 

and<00:01:35.460> we'll<00:01:35.730> draw<00:01:35.850> something<00:01:36.180> else<00:01:37.160> hmm

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
and we'll draw something else hmm

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.770 
and we'll draw something else hmm
okay<00:01:40.710> more<00:01:40.980> of<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.160> same<00:01:41.570> sorry<00:01:42.570> about<00:01:42.750> that

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
okay more of the same sorry about that

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:51.140 
okay more of the same sorry about that
but<00:01:43.410> anyway<00:01:46.640> save<00:01:49.700> one<00:01:50.700> last<00:01:50.910> thing<00:01:51.060> about

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:51.150 
but anyway save one last thing about

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:53.660 
but anyway save one last thing about
this<00:01:51.360> also<00:01:51.720> is<00:01:51.780> you<00:01:51.900> don't<00:01:52.110> need<00:01:52.260> to<00:01:52.380> be<00:01:52.560> in<00:01:52.860> the

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
this also is you don't need to be in the

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.970 
this also is you don't need to be in the
view<00:01:53.940> to<00:01:54.090> project<00:01:54.420> back<00:01:54.600> on<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:55.410> image<00:01:55.650> itself

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:55.980 
view to project back on the image itself

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:59.420 
view to project back on the image itself
stores<00:01:56.490> the<00:01:56.760> view<00:01:57.330> angle<00:01:57.450> so<00:01:58.200> you<00:01:58.260> can<00:01:58.530> see

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
stores the view angle so you can see

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.010 
stores the view angle so you can see
there's<00:01:59.640> high<00:02:00.240> resolution

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
there's high resolution

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.320 
there's high resolution
lines<00:02:01.380> being<00:02:01.620> projected<00:02:01.770> here<00:02:03.770> okay<00:02:05.330> it's

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:06.330 
lines being projected here okay it's

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.780 
lines being projected here okay it's
gonna<00:02:06.450> go<00:02:06.630> into<00:02:06.780> shadeless<00:02:07.260> mode<00:02:07.520> now<00:02:08.520> this<00:02:08.670> is

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:08.790 
gonna go into shadeless mode now this is

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:10.700 
gonna go into shadeless mode now this is
something<00:02:09.060> that<00:02:09.179> I<00:02:09.660> found<00:02:10.110> quite<00:02:10.230> funny<00:02:10.530> when

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:10.710 
something that I found quite funny when

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:11.930 
something that I found quite funny when
I<00:02:10.740> started<00:02:11.100> working<00:02:11.250> on<00:02:11.400> this<00:02:11.520> but<00:02:11.760> it's<00:02:11.880> not

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
I started working on this but it's not

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.540 
I started working on this but it's not
really<00:02:12.540> that<00:02:12.660> useful<00:02:13.070> just<00:02:14.070> to<00:02:14.250> give<00:02:14.370> you<00:02:14.460> an

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
really that useful just to give you an

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.390 
really that useful just to give you an
idea<00:02:14.640> of<00:02:14.790> how<00:02:14.940> it<00:02:15.030> works<00:02:15.210> so<00:02:15.390> I'll<00:02:15.630> show<00:02:15.840> you<00:02:16.400> so

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
idea of how it works so I'll show you so

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.330 
idea of how it works so I'll show you so
you've<00:02:17.670> got<00:02:17.850> the<00:02:17.970> image<00:02:18.210> here<00:02:18.450> so<00:02:19.130> you<00:02:20.130> just

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
you've got the image here so you just

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.270 
you've got the image here so you just
make<00:02:20.550> one<00:02:20.790> little<00:02:20.820> change<00:02:21.830> like<00:02:22.830> that<00:02:23.010> and

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
make one little change like that and

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.090 
make one little change like that and
don't<00:02:23.430> add<00:02:23.670> the<00:02:23.820> Alpha<00:02:24.090> channels<00:02:24.450> like<00:02:24.660> just

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.100 
don't add the Alpha channels like just

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:28.580 
don't add the Alpha channels like just
paint<00:02:26.100> directly<00:02:26.310> on<00:02:26.580> and<00:02:26.730> save<00:02:26.910> it<00:02:27.470> and<00:02:28.470> you

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
paint directly on and save it and you

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.050 
paint directly on and save it and you
apply<00:02:28.890> it<00:02:28.950> back<00:02:29.160> it<00:02:29.940> looks<00:02:30.590> okay<00:02:31.590> when<00:02:32.060> you

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
apply it back it looks okay when you

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.020 
apply it back it looks okay when you
zoom<00:02:33.240> out<00:02:33.390> you<00:02:33.630> see<00:02:34.550> something<00:02:35.550> like<00:02:35.580> familiar

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
zoom out you see something like familiar

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.120 
zoom out you see something like familiar
here<00:02:36.270> so<00:02:36.660> it's<00:02:37.530> actually<00:02:37.710> we're<00:02:38.010> projecting

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
here so it's actually we're projecting

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.640 
here so it's actually we're projecting
the<00:02:38.489> whole<00:02:38.670> viewport<00:02:39.350> putting<00:02:40.350> the<00:02:40.440> cursor

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
the whole viewport putting the cursor

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.540 
the whole viewport putting the cursor
and<00:02:41.040> you<00:02:41.310> know<00:02:41.880> things<00:02:42.239> like<00:02:42.360> that<00:02:42.420> so<00:02:43.550> you

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
and you know things like that so you

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:45.860 
and you know things like that so you
really<00:02:44.580> need<00:02:44.880> to<00:02:44.940> add<00:02:45.150> an<00:02:45.270> alpha<00:02:45.480> channel<00:02:45.750> over

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
really need to add an alpha channel over

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.400 
really need to add an alpha channel over
the<00:02:45.959> top<00:02:46.340> and<00:02:47.340> just<00:02:47.370> for<00:02:47.790> fun<00:02:48.000> oh<00:02:48.260> well<00:02:49.260> I'll

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
the top and just for fun oh well I'll

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.500 
the top and just for fun oh well I'll
undo<00:02:50.220> that<00:02:50.280> you<00:02:50.550> can<00:02:50.700> undo<00:02:50.940> this<00:02:51.120> just<00:02:51.360> like

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
undo that you can undo this just like

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.949 
undo that you can undo this just like
you<00:02:51.600> can<00:02:51.690> undo<00:02:51.930> prediction<00:02:52.350> paint<00:02:52.590> and<00:02:53.160> I'll

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:53.959 
you can undo prediction paint and I'll

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:56.960 
you can undo prediction paint and I'll
I'll<00:02:54.959> just<00:02:55.130> draw<00:02:56.130> some<00:02:56.310> silly<00:02:56.489> things<00:02:56.700> on<00:02:56.850> top

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
I'll just draw some silly things on top

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:04.009 
I'll just draw some silly things on top
of<00:02:57.090> this<00:02:57.180> oops<00:02:57.540> didn't<00:02:58.500> mean<00:02:58.620> that<00:02:58.830> okay<00:03:03.019> I'll

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
of this oops didn't mean that okay I'll

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:09.770 
of this oops didn't mean that okay I'll
try<00:03:04.380> just<00:03:05.959> try<00:03:06.959> some<00:03:07.140> filters

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:22.020 

predator<00:03:14.430> save<00:03:15.840> yep<00:03:16.870> apply<00:03:20.520> okay<00:03:21.520> so<00:03:21.580> you<00:03:21.910> can

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
predator save yep apply okay so you can

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:23.400 
predator save yep apply okay so you can
really<00:03:22.210> see<00:03:22.390> the<00:03:22.480> normal<00:03:22.810> fall-off<00:03:23.140> here

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
really see the normal fall-off here

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:25.200 
really see the normal fall-off here
which<00:03:24.070> is<00:03:24.220> basically<00:03:24.520> what<00:03:24.700> you<00:03:24.790> want<00:03:25.000> because

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:25.210 
which is basically what you want because

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:26.970 
which is basically what you want because
really<00:03:25.690> it<00:03:25.810> doesn't<00:03:26.140> work<00:03:26.260> very<00:03:26.290> well<00:03:26.560> if<00:03:26.830> you

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980 
really it doesn't work very well if you

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:28.890 
really it doesn't work very well if you
you<00:03:27.490> get<00:03:27.580> a<00:03:27.640> little<00:03:27.820> tearing<00:03:28.150> if<00:03:28.510> it<00:03:28.630> applies

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
you get a little tearing if it applies

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.640 
you get a little tearing if it applies
to<00:03:28.930> the<00:03:29.260> edges<00:03:29.500> there<00:03:29.710> but<00:03:31.350> for<00:03:32.350> real<00:03:32.500> use

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
to the edges there but for real use

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.880 
to the edges there but for real use
cases<00:03:32.920> you<00:03:33.160> wouldn't<00:03:33.430> want<00:03:33.580> this<00:03:33.820> here<00:03:34.480> so<00:03:35.440> we

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:35.890 
cases you wouldn't want this here so we

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:37.680 
cases you wouldn't want this here so we
would<00:03:36.040> use<00:03:36.250> this<00:03:36.400> mostly<00:03:36.670> for<00:03:36.880> matte<00:03:37.330> painting

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:37.690 
would use this mostly for matte painting

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:40.500 
would use this mostly for matte painting
I<00:03:37.780> think<00:03:38.020> for<00:03:38.560> painting<00:03:39.010> maybe<00:03:39.390> parts<00:03:40.390> of

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
I think for painting maybe parts of

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:43.740 
I think for painting maybe parts of
buildings<00:03:40.960> or<00:03:41.140> caves<00:03:41.670> things<00:03:42.670> that<00:03:42.880> we<00:03:43.000> might

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
buildings or caves things that we might

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:47.660 
buildings or caves things that we might
only<00:03:43.960> want<00:03:44.080> to<00:03:44.200> see<00:03:44.320> from<00:03:44.440> a<00:03:44.530> certain<00:03:44.800> angle

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:04:01.050 

okay<00:03:49.230> one<00:03:50.230> more<00:03:50.440> and<00:03:52.380> we<00:03:53.380> do<00:03:53.530> here

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:08.870 

okay<00:04:01.780> this<00:04:01.930> is<00:04:02.050> horrible<00:04:02.560> sorry<00:04:02.800> Syntel

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:08.880 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:16.020 

interesting<00:04:09.880> but<00:04:10.030> we'll<00:04:10.150> see<00:04:13.080> okay<00:04:14.080> well<00:04:15.030> if

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 
interesting but we'll see okay well if

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:18.150 
interesting but we'll see okay well if
it's<00:04:16.239> what<00:04:16.390> you<00:04:16.420> can<00:04:16.600> expect<00:04:16.890> all<00:04:17.890> right<00:04:18.040> well

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:18.160 
it's what you can expect all right well

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:19.680 
it's what you can expect all right well
I'm<00:04:18.280> sure<00:04:18.459> the<00:04:18.700> artists<00:04:19.120> in<00:04:19.180> the<00:04:19.269> studio<00:04:19.570> will

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:19.690 
I'm sure the artists in the studio will

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:20.759 
I'm sure the artists in the studio will
be<00:04:19.780> able<00:04:19.870> to<00:04:19.959> make<00:04:20.049> better<00:04:20.230> use<00:04:20.380> of<00:04:20.410> this<00:04:20.590> than

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:20.769 
be able to make better use of this than

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:23.160 
be able to make better use of this than
I<00:04:20.859> can<00:04:21.130> and<00:04:21.340> probably<00:04:21.549> you<00:04:21.970> too<00:04:22.000> but<00:04:22.540> I<00:04:22.570> hope

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:23.170 
I can and probably you too but I hope

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:26.580 
I can and probably you too but I hope
you<00:04:23.260> like<00:04:23.410> it<00:04:23.580> okay
