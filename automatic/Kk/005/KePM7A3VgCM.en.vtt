was<00:04:29.169> facing<00:04:29.560> in<00:04:29.650> multiplayer<00:04:30.040> and<00:04:30.720> if<00:04:31.720> you

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:31.930 
was facing in multiplayer and if you

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:34.710 
was facing in multiplayer and if you
find<00:04:32.169> that<00:04:32.290> the<00:04:32.440> lag<00:04:32.740> is<00:04:32.919> over<00:04:33.250> 300<00:04:33.610> inch<00:04:34.540> in

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:34.720 
find that the lag is over 300 inch in

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.320 
find that the lag is over 300 inch in
general<00:04:35.229> it<00:04:35.500> tends<00:04:36.400> to<00:04:36.520> be<00:04:36.640> really<00:04:37.060> hard<00:04:37.270> to

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:37.330 
general it tends to be really hard to

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:40.200 
general it tends to be really hard to
play<00:04:37.540> the<00:04:37.600> game<00:04:38.220> so<00:04:39.220> with<00:04:39.400> multiplayer<00:04:39.729> give
