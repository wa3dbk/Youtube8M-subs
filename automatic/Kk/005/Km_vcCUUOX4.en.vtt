00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.360 
new ones and then you got to undo this
bracket<00:02:01.280> right<00:02:02.280> here<00:02:02.540> and<00:02:03.540> over<00:02:04.380> here<00:02:04.409> which

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:05.370 
bracket right here and over here which

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:07.310 
bracket right here and over here which
this<00:02:05.640> one<00:02:05.880> will<00:02:06.090> take<00:02:06.390> out<00:02:06.600> once<00:02:06.840> we<00:02:07.020> get<00:02:07.170> the

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
this one will take out once we get the

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.520 
this one will take out once we get the
actual<00:02:07.409> chrome<00:02:07.950> piece<00:02:08.190> off<00:02:08.429> here<00:02:08.459> and<00:02:09.289> I<00:02:10.289> think

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
actual chrome piece off here and I think

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:11.979 
actual chrome piece off here and I think
that<00:02:10.739> was<00:02:10.890> about<00:02:11.430> it

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:11.989 
that was about it

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:15.289 
that was about it
Farzana<00:02:13.190> then<00:02:14.190> we<00:02:14.310> got<00:02:14.459> actually<00:02:14.879> one<00:02:15.060> more

00:02:15.289 --> 00:02:15.299 
Farzana then we got actually one more

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:18.350 
Farzana then we got actually one more
