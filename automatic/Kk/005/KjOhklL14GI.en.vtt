00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:06.029
 hello in this video I want to completely 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:08.519
 briefly introduce the new tablet from LG 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.559
 with the designation 8.3 gives that since 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.690
 november 2013 is on the market and about 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.610
 It costs a total of 300 euros 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.010
 nice tablet of which I really 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.080
 I'm convinced how 336 grams that is 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.820
 a bit heavier than the kindle fire fire 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.830
 hdx what I device as comparatively 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.289
 next door but this one has just too 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:28.619
 9 7 inch display in the width is that 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:31.859
 lg does not get any bigger than that 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.600
 hdx it's just a bit longer though 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.450
 because of the larger displays one has 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.070
 not quite as strong here 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.930
 increase in size that's just because 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.610
 that here a very narrow edge installed 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.040
 what has been found to be positive 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.410
 otherwise the feel is a bit like that 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.809
 lg we typically kept this behind 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.059
 aluminum shell the relatively high quality 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.850
 here acts the operating elements charging socket 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:57.570
 and headphone output and what's important 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:01.530
 here is still the one here is still the 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:03.149
 flap for the sd micro sd card so 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.619
 From the feel of her leaves very pleasant 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.170
 Also in the format is still good in 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.460
 hold one hand and thus also 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:13.979
 operate with one hand 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:17.280
 as I said the display 8 3 inches 1920 x 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:19.320
 1200 pixels so full hd with ips 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:23.310
 technology is well lit. 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:25.500
 one also saw in the im 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.939
 end effect angle stability really 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.090
 very good values ​​as I think 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:34.430
 and the display is absolutely at the top 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.430
 with it from the operating system android 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:43.380
 4.2.2010 by iris so far completely liquid 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:46.439
 as you can see reacts promptly 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:49.110
 all movements and leads actually is 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:51.299
 absolutely super to use from here 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.829
 the camera is a bit 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.090
 but mentally treated it just 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.649
 no picture cell phone and no 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.090
 camera but a tablet pc 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.369
 you have a 5 in the front here 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.950
 megapixel camera which can full hd s 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:04.079
 record video on videos and have photos 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.840
 no lightning therefore as only limited 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:10.619
 it can be used for video telephony 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:13.350
 suitable the processor is a 1 7 ghz 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:15.900
 snapdragon 600 there is yes 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:18.870
 between the 800 's for example in the 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:22.220
 kindle fire hdx is installed i test 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:30.570
 That's always happy with the game 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:32.040
 gp3 what you see here in action and there 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:34.830
 you can absolutely nothing more at the 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:38.040
 Loading time is a bit small 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:40.770
 difference to the snapdragon 800 of the 2 2 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:43.700
 gigahertz has that is unclear 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:46.470
 2 gb ram have the two processors 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.880
 but overall it is like that 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.590
 absolutely here with this processor 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:52.110
 can be satisfied enough for the 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:54.570
 usual gimmicks more than off and 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:58.620
 that's no problem at all 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:03:00.000
 16 GB of internal memory blocks this 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.560
 of course, a bit expandable 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.150
 but you can just about this 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.920
 micro sd slot I personally think that 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.320
 absolutely important so that no data 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.180
 outsource is wifi capable that is 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.440
 Of course, no one should know that 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.700
 that was originally in the 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.710
 Product description with in it 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:17.310
 that was a bit confusing but has 

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:18.000
 it just does not have it of course and gps 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.490
 exactly 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.160
 otherwise it's from lg these few 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:24.930
 features this motto where to just hang up 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.070
 The display can knock it all the way 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.920
 Useful if you have the tablet somewhere 

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:31.920
 otherwise it has got to lie next to it 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:34.710
 a few more features of this 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.960
 mira is up here where you get the pictures from 

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:39.900
 can bring tray to the pc then has 

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:41.550
 It's this cubeware where you can use the cellphone 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.230
 can pair the tablet so that sms 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:44.490
 notification call notification 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:46.770
 also appear on the tablet 

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:48.120
 and this quick remote where you can get that 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:49.970
 tablet just as a remote control 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:52.560
 can use 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:54.120
 yes, these are things everyone has to do 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:56.400
 but know that needs or needs 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:04:00.090
 not the sound comes from these 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:02.340
 both are spicy on the side of the 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:05.550
 Tablets, of course, are from tablet 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:07.050
 or so what should I say 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:09.330
 as far as acceptable 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:11.220
 but who really needs good sound 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:12.930
 Of course this is with a tablet pc 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:14.940
 not quite so well cared for 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:18.150
 he should rather a htc 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:20.370
 buy one but that 's just that 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:22.740
 problem of the construction of the computer 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:24.110
 Battery with this tablet is good with 4600 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:26.569
 mah 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:28.340
 is enough for about six hours full 

00:04:26.569 --> 00:04:32.629
 service and one to two days if you want 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:34.669
 so I say times and served regularly 

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:35.569
 otherwise the firmly built one is fixed 

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:39.319
 I can not change 

00:04:35.569 --> 00:04:42.379
 charging is via this micro-usb dose 

00:04:39.319 --> 00:04:44.330
 down here and from here from mine 

00:04:42.379 --> 00:04:46.460
 I am absolutely positively surprised 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:48.199
 from this tablet though lg actually 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:49.610
 no big producer on the market that 

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:51.530
 you have something on the market here 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:54.080
 brought what can compete very well 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:56.750
 in google nexus him like me 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:59.599
 also with the fire hdx as I said 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:01.370
 actually the only drawback is the 

00:04:59.599 --> 00:05:04.669
 processor if you see it as a manko 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:06.710
 the one with 1.7 ghz snapdragon 600 wants 

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:08.870
 against the snapdragon 800 something back 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:11.120
 But you can tell that in practice 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:12.740
 actually hardly and from him he from me 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.750
 from a full recommendation for this 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:17.919
 tablet with a good price performance 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:17.919
 thank you for watching
