00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.319 
can't go to wrong they're got battery
one<00:00:56.340> battery<00:00:56.940> -<00:00:57.199> I've<00:00:58.199> got<00:00:58.410> my<00:00:59.059> switch<00:01:00.059> here

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
one battery - I've got my switch here

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:06.850 
one battery - I've got my switch here
which<00:01:00.690> is<00:01:01.469> a<00:01:02.149> while<00:01:03.149> ago<00:01:03.470> and<00:01:05.659> clearly<00:01:06.659> marked

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860 
which is a while ago and clearly marked

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.890 
which is a while ago and clearly marked
it<00:01:07.860> so<00:01:07.979> I<00:01:08.040> can<00:01:08.420> just<00:01:09.420> put<00:01:09.600> it<00:01:09.689> all<00:01:09.750> back

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
it so I can just put it all back

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.700 
it so I can just put it all back
together<00:01:10.049> and<00:01:10.290> work<00:01:10.830> again<00:01:11.159> and<00:01:12.439> I'm<00:01:13.439> gonna

together and work again and I'm gonna

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.740 
together and work again and I'm gonna
that'll<00:01:14.580> just<00:01:14.700> fry<00:01:14.880> my<00:01:15.030> double<00:01:15.299> mattress<00:01:15.600> in

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
that'll just fry my double mattress in

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.560 
that'll just fry my double mattress in
the<00:01:15.840> front<00:01:16.080> there<00:01:16.259> and<00:01:16.830> I'm<00:01:17.759> six<00:01:18.180> foot<00:01:18.390> and

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
the front there and I'm six foot and

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.800 
the front there and I'm six foot and
that<00:01:19.259> pretty<00:01:19.470> much<00:01:19.560> just<00:01:19.680> leaves<00:01:20.040> my<00:01:20.189> feet

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
that pretty much just leaves my feet

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.679 
that pretty much just leaves my feet
sticking<00:01:21.810> out<00:01:22.049> of<00:01:22.259> here<00:01:22.500> which<00:01:23.310> is<00:01:23.340> a<00:01:24.000> great

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
sticking out of here which is a great

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.179 
sticking out of here which is a great
step<00:01:25.080> forward<00:01:25.380> because<00:01:25.590> this<00:01:25.799> was<00:01:25.920> just<00:01:26.070> a

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
step forward because this was just a

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.010 
step forward because this was just a
waste<00:01:26.400> of<00:01:26.549> space<00:01:26.610> all<00:01:27.180> that<00:01:27.680> these<00:01:28.680> little

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
waste of space all that these little

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.530 
waste of space all that these little
mini<00:01:31.460> banks<00:01:32.460> which<00:01:32.640> weren't<00:01:33.210> good<00:01:33.390> for

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
mini banks which weren't good for

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.789 
mini banks which weren't good for
anything<00:01:33.720> so<00:01:34.380> I'm<00:01:35.960> already<00:01:36.960> in<00:01:37.229> foot<00:01:37.439> but<00:01:37.650> I

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
anything so I'm already in foot but I

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.640 
anything so I'm already in foot but I
think<00:01:37.979> they<00:01:38.130> were<00:01:39.110> they<00:01:40.110> were<00:01:40.259> a<00:01:40.290> very

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
think they were they were a very

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.980 
think they were they were a very
optimistic<00:01:40.890> idea<00:01:41.820> that<00:01:42.509> someone<00:01:42.960> could

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
optimistic idea that someone could

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.450 
optimistic idea that someone could
actually<00:01:43.200> sleep<00:01:43.649> or<00:01:43.890> two<00:01:44.040> people<00:01:44.369> could

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
actually sleep or two people could

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.760 
actually sleep or two people could
actually<00:01:44.579> bunk<00:01:44.939> down<00:01:45.119> in<00:01:45.200> the<00:01:46.200> half<00:01:46.380> cabin

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
actually bunk down in the half cabin

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.190 
actually bunk down in the half cabin
there<00:01:46.950> so<00:01:47.820> for<00:01:48.119> my<00:01:48.210> purposes<00:01:48.270> I'll<00:01:48.930> just<00:01:49.020> go

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
there so for my purposes I'll just go

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.410 
there so for my purposes I'll just go
out<00:01:49.409> onto<00:01:49.920> rivers<00:01:50.310> and<00:01:50.610> lakes<00:01:51.450> and<00:01:52.020> bays<00:01:52.560> and

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
out onto rivers and lakes and bays and

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.139 
out onto rivers and lakes and bays and
chucking<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:55.520> inflatable<00:01:56.520> double<00:01:56.759> mattress

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
chucking the inflatable double mattress

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.990 
chucking the inflatable double mattress
and<00:01:57.570> I<00:01:58.140> can<00:01:58.290> just<00:01:58.439> also<00:01:59.250> get<00:01:59.520> clear<00:01:59.759> up<00:01:59.850> this

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
and I can just also get clear up this

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.450 
and I can just also get clear up this
space<00:02:00.299> it'll<00:02:00.600> be<00:02:00.750> just<00:02:00.899> just<00:02:01.890> brilliant<00:02:02.280> to

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
space it'll be just just brilliant to

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.469 
space it'll be just just brilliant to
better<00:02:02.820> have<00:02:03.659> all<00:02:03.780> that<00:02:03.960> usable<00:02:04.259> space<00:02:05.479> never

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
better have all that usable space never

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.520 
better have all that usable space never
