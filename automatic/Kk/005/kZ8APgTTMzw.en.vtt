in<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.350> thing<00:00:40.350> now<00:00:40.559> I'm<00:00:40.829> gonna<00:00:40.980> try<00:00:41.280> and<00:00:41.460> get

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
in the thing now I'm gonna try and get

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.340 
in the thing now I'm gonna try and get
it<00:00:41.700> actually<00:00:42.149> running<00:00:42.510> when<00:00:42.660> I<00:00:42.690> purchase<00:00:43.260> the

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
it actually running when I purchase the

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.170 
it actually running when I purchase the
lines<00:00:43.590> before<00:00:44.100> so<00:00:44.370> I<00:00:44.399> think<00:00:44.640> it's<00:00:44.760> about<00:00:44.969> ready

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
lines before so I think it's about ready

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:56.290 
lines before so I think it's about ready
to<00:00:45.420> fire<00:00:45.690> up<00:00:45.719> now

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:56.300 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:03.760

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:03.770 
I guess I should put some bolts in the

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:08.020 
I guess I should put some bolts in the
exhaust<00:01:06.070> all<00:01:07.070> right<00:01:07.250> I've<00:01:07.430> bolted<00:01:07.640> on<00:01:07.910> the

it's<00:02:23.769> not<00:02:23.860> crazy<00:02:24.250> loud<00:02:24.640> but<00:02:25.030> at<00:02:25.180> least<00:02:25.330> it'll

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
it's not crazy loud but at least it'll

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.840 
it's not crazy loud but at least it'll
like<00:02:25.930> shoot<00:02:26.260> the<00:02:26.500> exhaust<00:02:26.920> and<00:02:27.250> smoke<00:02:27.610> that

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 
like shoot the exhaust and smoke that

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:31.410 
like shoot the exhaust and smoke that
off<00:02:28.150> one<00:02:28.750> pub<00:02:28.989> life<00:02:29.230> there<00:02:29.680> so<00:02:30.070> it'd<00:02:30.970> be<00:02:31.000> pretty

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
off one pub life there so it'd be pretty

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.620 
off one pub life there so it'd be pretty
good<00:02:32.040> ISTEP<00:02:33.040> bring<00:02:33.340> in<00:02:33.489> any<00:02:33.670> oil<00:02:34.000> and<00:02:34.269> stuff<00:02:34.570> a

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
good ISTEP bring in any oil and stuff a

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:35.759 
good ISTEP bring in any oil and stuff a
little<00:02:34.989> spray

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:35.769 
little spray

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:38.220 
little spray
maybe<00:02:36.370> he'll<00:02:36.640> lose<00:02:36.850> control<00:02:37.390> or<00:02:37.660> something<00:02:37.900> in

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
maybe he'll lose control or something in

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.479 
maybe he'll lose control or something in
the<00:02:38.350> race<00:02:38.530> I<00:02:38.980> have<00:02:39.940> to<00:02:40.180> see<00:02:40.480> so<00:02:41.260> I'll<00:02:41.980> toss<00:02:42.220> that

front view you can see go slick over

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.050 
front view you can see go slick over
there<00:03:10.780> from<00:03:11.590> the<00:03:11.799> headers<00:03:12.130> down<00:03:12.489> to<00:03:12.760> the<00:03:12.880> like

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
there from the headers down to the like

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.390 
there from the headers down to the like
underneath<00:03:13.420> I'll<00:03:14.230> just<00:03:14.410> use<00:03:14.680> the<00:03:14.860> little<00:03:15.040> bend

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
underneath I'll just use the little bend

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.180 
underneath I'll just use the little bend
from<00:03:15.700> the<00:03:15.790> actual<00:03:16.269> muffler<00:03:16.900> but<00:03:17.560> care<00:03:17.950> if<00:03:18.040> they

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
from the actual muffler but care if they

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:21.900 
from the actual muffler but care if they
at<00:03:18.310> the<00:03:18.430> bottom<00:03:18.989> to<00:03:19.989> this<00:03:20.140> point<00:03:20.500> few<00:03:20.910> cuts

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
at the bottom to this point few cuts

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:23.729 
at the bottom to this point few cuts
over<00:03:22.299> here<00:03:22.570> just<00:03:22.870> underneath<00:03:23.230> the<00:03:23.500> clutch

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:23.739 
over here just underneath the clutch

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:26.880 
over here just underneath the clutch
pedal<00:03:24.220> and<00:03:24.340> all<00:03:24.519> that<00:03:24.780> so<00:03:25.780> it's<00:03:26.049> it's<00:03:26.470> kind<00:03:26.560> of

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.890 
pedal and all that so it's it's kind of

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:29.759 
pedal and all that so it's it's kind of
low<00:03:27.040> but<00:03:27.340> it's<00:03:28.000> like<00:03:28.690> just<00:03:28.720> a<00:03:29.049> bit<00:03:29.260> lower<00:03:29.500> than

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:29.769 
low but it's like just a bit lower than

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:31.259 
low but it's like just a bit lower than
the<00:03:29.829> clutch<00:03:30.160> I<00:03:30.370> guess<00:03:30.519> it'll<00:03:30.790> be<00:03:30.880> the<00:03:31.090> lowest

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:31.269 
the clutch I guess it'll be the lowest

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:33.960 
the clutch I guess it'll be the lowest
part<00:03:31.750> of<00:03:31.870> the<00:03:31.930> thing<00:03:32.410> keep<00:03:33.190> it<00:03:33.340> nice<00:03:33.519> and<00:03:33.549> cool

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
part of the thing keep it nice and cool

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.449 
part of the thing keep it nice and cool
at<00:03:34.209> least<00:03:34.380> and<00:03:35.380> they're<00:03:35.470> like<00:03:35.650> just<00:03:35.889> caps<00:03:36.220> off

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:36.459 
at least and they're like just caps off

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:40.550 
at least and they're like just caps off
back<00:03:36.760> here<00:03:37.120> to<00:03:37.419> the<00:03:37.650> picking<00:03:38.650> can<00:03:38.949> then<00:03:39.370> so

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
back here to the picking can then so

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.860 
back here to the picking can then so
pretty<00:03:41.560> decent<00:03:42.359> just<00:03:43.359> gonna<00:03:43.540> make<00:03:43.810> some

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 
pretty decent just gonna make some

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:45.420 
pretty decent just gonna make some
mounts<00:03:44.530> hold<00:03:44.859> it<00:03:45.040> in<00:03:45.160> place

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
mounts hold it in place

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:48.390 
mounts hold it in place
I'll<00:03:46.329> have<00:03:46.570> it<00:03:46.600> like<00:03:46.900> mounted<00:03:47.410> saw<00:03:47.680> it<00:03:47.949> so<00:03:48.250> it

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
I'll have it like mounted saw it so it

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.220 
I'll have it like mounted saw it so it
doesn't<00:03:48.609> like<00:03:48.850> vibrate<00:03:49.389> or<00:03:49.540> anything

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230 
doesn't like vibrate or anything

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.330 
doesn't like vibrate or anything
it's<00:03:50.590> got<00:03:50.799> like<00:03:51.239> we'll<00:03:52.239> just<00:03:52.269> take<00:03:52.630> bit<00:03:53.340> with

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
it's got like we'll just take bit with

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.729 
it's got like we'll just take bit with
the<00:03:54.489> tire<00:03:54.730> so<00:03:55.150> hopefully<00:03:55.540> it<00:03:55.750> doesn't<00:03:56.109> the

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:56.739 
the tire so hopefully it doesn't the

00:03:56.739 --> 00:03:58.560 
the tire so hopefully it doesn't the
tire<00:03:56.980> doesn't<00:03:57.250> shift<00:03:57.639> too<00:03:57.940> far<00:03:58.209> that<00:03:58.239> way

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:58.570 
tire doesn't shift too far that way

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:00.689 
tire doesn't shift too far that way
little<00:03:59.139> freaking<00:03:59.829> drift<00:04:00.130> in<00:04:00.340> there<00:04:00.489> or

00:04:00.689 --> 00:04:00.699 
little freaking drift in there or

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:03.180 
little freaking drift in there or
something<00:04:00.910> but<00:04:01.540> yeah<00:04:02.290> anyways<00:04:02.680> I'm<00:04:03.010> gonna

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.190 
something but yeah anyways I'm gonna

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:05.670 
something but yeah anyways I'm gonna
just<00:04:04.090> make<00:04:04.209> the<00:04:04.540> mounts<00:04:04.900> I<00:04:05.049> guess<00:04:05.260> I<00:04:05.560> was

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
just make the mounts I guess I was

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.370 
just make the mounts I guess I was
looking<00:04:05.829> at<00:04:06.160> maybe<00:04:06.340> like<00:04:06.870> notching<00:04:07.870> that<00:04:08.079> back

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:08.380 
looking at maybe like notching that back

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:10.530 
looking at maybe like notching that back
part<00:04:08.739> cuz<00:04:09.010> I<00:04:09.130> don't<00:04:09.310> even<00:04:09.519> actually<00:04:10.090> use<00:04:10.299> that

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:10.540 
part cuz I don't even actually use that

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:12.509 
part cuz I don't even actually use that
part<00:04:10.840> anymore<00:04:11.230> as<00:04:11.470> you<00:04:11.530> can<00:04:11.680> see<00:04:11.919> it's<00:04:12.130> below

00:04:12.509 --> 00:04:12.519 
part anymore as you can see it's below

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:15.270 
part anymore as you can see it's below
where<00:04:12.760> the<00:04:13.030> the<00:04:13.750> frames<00:04:14.079> hips<00:04:14.470> and<00:04:14.769> stuff<00:04:15.040> now

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:15.280 
where the the frames hips and stuff now

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:18.000 
where the the frames hips and stuff now
so<00:04:15.310> I<00:04:16.000> could<00:04:16.720> do<00:04:16.930> that<00:04:17.139> too<00:04:17.500> to<00:04:17.709> give<00:04:17.829> myself

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.010 
so I could do that too to give myself

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:20.610

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:25.140 
it should be fine right now I'm like
this<00:04:23.050> exhaust<00:04:23.800> tips<00:04:24.190> like<00:04:24.460> pretty<00:04:24.760> much<00:04:24.820> like

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.150 
this exhaust tips like pretty much like

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:27.360 
this exhaust tips like pretty much like
a<00:04:25.180> huge<00:04:25.510> heat<00:04:25.780> shield<00:04:26.229> so<00:04:26.560> it<00:04:26.710> should<00:04:26.949> be<00:04:27.100> fine

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:27.370 
a huge heat shield so it should be fine

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:30.420 
a huge heat shield so it should be fine
for<00:04:27.400> like<00:04:27.850> the<00:04:28.000> heat<00:04:28.240> and<00:04:28.479> all<00:04:28.570> that<00:04:29.010> so<00:04:30.010> yeah

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:30.430 
for like the heat and all that so yeah

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:33.810 
for like the heat and all that so yeah
but<00:04:31.000> I<00:04:31.030> left<00:04:31.510> myself<00:04:31.780> like<00:04:32.260> some<00:04:33.100> options<00:04:33.699> so

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:33.820 
but I left myself like some options so

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:35.790 
but I left myself like some options so
like<00:04:34.270> if<00:04:34.449> I<00:04:34.570> don't<00:04:34.720> like<00:04:34.900> that<00:04:35.080> pipe<00:04:35.440> there<00:04:35.770> I

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:35.800 
like if I don't like that pipe there I

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:37.770 
like if I don't like that pipe there I
can<00:04:36.160> just<00:04:36.310> cut<00:04:36.550> it<00:04:36.669> off<00:04:36.820> and<00:04:37.120> make<00:04:37.270> a<00:04:37.300> new<00:04:37.600> one

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:37.780 
can just cut it off and make a new one

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:41.219 
can just cut it off and make a new one
just<00:04:38.020> curve<00:04:38.860> it<00:04:38.889> out<00:04:39.160> here<00:04:39.490> or<00:04:39.639> something<00:04:40.229> with

00:04:41.219 --> 00:04:41.229 
just curve it out here or something with

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:44.820 
just curve it out here or something with
the<00:04:41.380> smaller<00:04:41.740> pipe<00:04:42.070> or<00:04:42.490> off<00:04:42.729> if<00:04:43.570> I<00:04:43.690> want<00:04:43.960> top

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:44.830 
the smaller pipe or off if I want top

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:47.790 
the smaller pipe or off if I want top
this<00:04:45.070> off<00:04:45.449> well<00:04:46.449> the<00:04:46.630> flange<00:04:46.990> there<00:04:47.410> and<00:04:47.650> then

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:47.800 
this off well the flange there and then

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:57.659 
this off well the flange there and then
stick<00:04:48.130> that<00:04:48.340> turbo<00:04:48.880> over<00:04:49.270> there<00:04:56.340> yes<00:04:57.340> you

00:04:57.659 --> 00:04:57.669 
stick that turbo over there yes you

00:04:57.669 --> 00:04:59.790 
stick that turbo over there yes you
would<00:04:57.880> fit<00:04:58.120> on<00:04:58.300> there<00:04:58.510> like<00:04:58.840> almost<00:04:59.199> perfect

00:04:59.790 --> 00:04:59.800 
would fit on there like almost perfect

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.730 
would fit on there like almost perfect
just<00:05:00.070> need<00:05:00.280> a<00:05:00.310> little<00:05:00.520> flange

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:01.740 
just need a little flange

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:05.879 
just need a little flange

gonna wire up that kill switch I got
yourself<00:05:13.210> to<00:05:13.330> run<00:05:13.510> a<00:05:13.570> wire<00:05:13.900> from<00:05:13.930> the<00:05:14.500> crate

00:05:14.969 --> 00:05:14.979 
yourself to run a wire from the crate

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:18.330 
yourself to run a wire from the crate
there<00:05:15.250> to<00:05:15.460> the<00:05:15.580> coil<00:05:16.320> it<00:05:17.320> almost<00:05:17.590> ready<00:05:17.949> yeah

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:18.340 
there to the coil it almost ready yeah

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:21.499 
there to the coil it almost ready yeah
no<00:05:18.490> but<00:05:18.790> see<00:05:19.570> like<00:05:19.600> this<00:05:19.990> is<00:05:20.199> the<00:05:20.380> old<00:05:20.590> one<00:05:20.830> here

what to go use it on the one you'll see
in<00:05:25.000> the<00:05:25.120> one<00:05:25.270> video<00:05:25.889> one<00:05:26.889> -<00:05:27.070> like<00:05:27.220> ground<00:05:27.669> it

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:27.850 
in the one video one - like ground it

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:29.909 
in the one video one - like ground it
out<00:05:28.030> on<00:05:28.240> there<00:05:28.540> when<00:05:28.840> I<00:05:28.870> like<00:05:29.380> pulled<00:05:29.680> on<00:05:29.889> it

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:31.810 
it'd pull there to the coil

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:35.100 
it'd pull there to the coil
I<00:05:31.840> wasn't<00:05:32.410> even<00:05:32.620> connected<00:05:33.040> so<00:05:33.699> ran<00:05:34.570> away<00:05:34.750> like
