would appear in the back you can extend
this<00:01:33.000> and<00:01:33.570> for<00:01:34.290> example<00:01:34.470> you<00:01:34.710> can<00:01:34.860> make<00:01:35.009> it

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
this and for example you can make it

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.429 
this and for example you can make it
sort<00:01:35.369> of<00:01:35.460> drape<00:01:36.180> over<00:01:36.420> like<00:01:36.570> this<00:01:36.750> you<00:01:37.290> can

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
sort of drape over like this you can

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:38.929 
sort of drape over like this you can
extend<00:01:37.710> it<00:01:37.829> even<00:01:37.920> further<00:01:38.369> so<00:01:38.670> you<00:01:38.729> know<00:01:38.880> you

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
extend it even further so you know you

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.249 
extend it even further so you know you
can<00:01:39.150> easily<00:01:39.299> presump<00:01:39.720> or<00:01:39.840> you<00:01:39.900> can<00:01:40.020> move<00:01:40.140> it

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
can easily presump or you can move it

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.140 
can easily presump or you can move it
further<00:01:40.770> away<00:01:41.130> from<00:01:41.159> your<00:01:41.430> body<00:01:41.579> or<00:01:41.880> closer

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
further away from your body or closer

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.969 
further away from your body or closer
and<00:01:42.570> again<00:01:42.899> because<00:01:43.290> the<00:01:43.380> handles<00:01:43.680> quickly

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
and again because the handles quickly

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.310 
and again because the handles quickly
adjust<00:01:44.310> that's<00:01:45.000> cool<00:01:45.270> and<00:01:45.540> another<00:01:46.079> thing

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
adjust that's cool and another thing

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.050 
adjust that's cool and another thing
that<00:01:46.350> that's<00:01:46.680> pretty<00:01:46.920> cool<00:01:47.100> with<00:01:47.250> this<00:01:47.369> is<00:01:47.579> now

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
that that's pretty cool with this is now

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.969 
that that's pretty cool with this is now
you<00:01:48.149> can<00:01:48.299> fold<00:01:48.540> this<00:01:48.720> in<00:01:49.229> the<00:01:49.380> back<00:01:49.530> here<00:01:49.799> and

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
you can fold this in the back here and

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.990 
you can fold this in the back here and
you<00:01:50.399> can<00:01:50.549> easily<00:01:50.759> take<00:01:51.450> those<00:01:51.689> handles<00:01:52.110> here

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
you can easily take those handles here

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.420 
you can easily take those handles here
invert<00:01:54.000> them<00:01:54.240> and<00:01:54.450> now<00:01:55.380> you<00:01:55.439> would<00:01:55.740> have<00:01:55.770> sort

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
invert them and now you would have sort

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.060 
invert them and now you would have sort
of<00:01:56.520> you<00:01:57.060> know<00:01:57.090> kind<00:01:57.750> of<00:01:57.840> a<00:01:57.930> good<00:01:57.960> break<00:01:58.740> for

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
of you know kind of a good break for

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.010 
of you know kind of a good break for
let's<00:01:59.579> see<00:01:59.670> running<00:01:59.880> gum<00:02:00.180> kind<00:02:00.420> of<00:02:00.509> shot<00:02:00.750> so

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
let's see running gum kind of shot so

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.810 
let's see running gum kind of shot so
let's<00:02:01.259> see<00:02:01.409> whether<00:02:01.860> it's<00:02:02.070> like<00:02:02.250> a<00:02:02.280> lower<00:02:02.520> shot

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
let's see whether it's like a lower shot

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.550 
let's see whether it's like a lower shot
or<00:02:03.149> something<00:02:03.600> where<00:02:03.990> you<00:02:04.020> know<00:02:04.229> it's<00:02:04.380> almost

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
or something where you know it's almost

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:05.749 
or something where you know it's almost
like<00:02:04.710> those<00:02:04.799> big<00:02:05.009> steering<00:02:05.250> wheels<00:02:05.520> that

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
like those big steering wheels that

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.249 
like those big steering wheels that
where<00:02:05.850> you<00:02:05.909> put<00:02:06.060> your<00:02:06.210> cameras<00:02:06.479> on<00:02:06.630> it<00:02:06.990> allows

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
where you put your cameras on it allows

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.169 
where you put your cameras on it allows
you<00:02:07.380> to<00:02:07.409> easily<00:02:07.619> twist<00:02:08.009> the<00:02:08.190> camera<00:02:08.580> and<00:02:08.970> go

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
you to easily twist the camera and go

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.760 
you to easily twist the camera and go
with<00:02:09.360> it<00:02:09.390> and<00:02:09.690> because<00:02:10.200> you<00:02:10.410> no<00:02:10.619> longer

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
with it and because you no longer

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.550 
with it and because you no longer
holding<00:02:11.250> the<00:02:11.370> camera<00:02:11.610> itself

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
holding the camera itself

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.980 
holding the camera itself
in<00:02:13.650> your<00:02:13.890> hands<00:02:14.280> your<00:02:14.940> basic<00:02:15.209> points<00:02:15.900> of

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
in your hands your basic points of

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.020 
in your hands your basic points of
contact<00:02:16.380> are<00:02:16.530> more<00:02:16.920> spread<00:02:17.190> out<00:02:17.310> because<00:02:17.910> of

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
contact are more spread out because of

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.970 
contact are more spread out because of
that<00:02:18.120> it<00:02:18.300> basically<00:02:18.630> results<00:02:19.020> in<00:02:19.410> steadier

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
that it basically results in steadier

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.100 
that it basically results in steadier
shots<00:02:20.250> as<00:02:20.850> you<00:02:20.910> can<00:02:21.390> see<00:02:21.540> here<00:02:21.720> in<00:02:21.780> the

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
shots as you can see here in the

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.050 
shots as you can see here in the
examples<00:02:22.530> so<00:02:23.100> as<00:02:23.220> you<00:02:23.340> can<00:02:23.459> see<00:02:23.520> in<00:02:23.760> this

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
examples so as you can see in this

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.490 
examples so as you can see in this
example<00:02:24.240> here<00:02:24.720> that<00:02:24.750> I'm<00:02:24.990> shooting<00:02:25.380> with

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
example here that I'm shooting with

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.630 
example here that I'm shooting with
Diana<00:02:26.490> it's<00:02:27.380> when<00:02:28.380> you<00:02:28.470> get<00:02:28.590> this<00:02:28.800> shot<00:02:29.040> with

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
Diana it's when you get this shot with

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:30.740 
Diana it's when you get this shot with
just<00:02:29.850> a<00:02:29.940> camera<00:02:30.180> when<00:02:30.540> you're<00:02:30.630> actually

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
just a camera when you're actually

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.390 
just a camera when you're actually
holding<00:02:31.140> the<00:02:31.260> camera<00:02:31.500> directly<00:02:31.830> the<00:02:32.010> problem

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
holding the camera directly the problem

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.850 
holding the camera directly the problem
is<00:02:32.520> that<00:02:32.700> your<00:02:32.910> your<00:02:33.540> point<00:02:33.930> of<00:02:34.050> contact<00:02:34.110> is

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
is that your your point of contact is

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.590 
is that your your point of contact is
very<00:02:34.890> close<00:02:35.459> your<00:02:35.790> hands<00:02:36.000> are<00:02:36.090> very<00:02:36.209> close<00:02:36.420> to

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
very close your hands are very close to

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.840 
very close your hands are very close to
the<00:02:36.870> camera<00:02:37.080> and<00:02:37.410> there's<00:02:38.280> only<00:02:38.370> two<00:02:38.580> points

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
the camera and there's only two points

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:40.670 
the camera and there's only two points
of<00:02:38.940> contact<00:02:38.970> so<00:02:39.510> it<00:02:39.750> you'll<00:02:40.140> see<00:02:40.470> sometimes

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
of contact so it you'll see sometimes

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.500 
of contact so it you'll see sometimes
slight<00:02:41.100> slight<00:02:41.459> little<00:02:41.670> jitter<00:02:42.000> instead<00:02:42.420> of

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
slight slight little jitter instead of

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.990 
slight slight little jitter instead of
in<00:02:42.630> the<00:02:42.720> shots<00:02:43.040> because<00:02:44.040> you<00:02:44.190> know<00:02:44.280> doesn't

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
in the shots because you know doesn't

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.250 
in the shots because you know doesn't
matter<00:02:45.150> how<00:02:45.270> steady<00:02:45.660> your<00:02:45.720> hands<00:02:46.050> are<00:02:46.140> you

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
matter how steady your hands are you

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:47.810 
matter how steady your hands are you
always<00:02:46.500> it's<00:02:46.860> just<00:02:47.010> going<00:02:47.130> to<00:02:47.190> basically<00:02:47.459> you

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
always it's just going to basically you

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:49.009 
always it's just going to basically you
know<00:02:47.850> it's<00:02:47.970> going<00:02:48.060> to<00:02:48.150> cut<00:02:48.330> these<00:02:48.510> tiny<00:02:48.930> little

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019 
know it's going to cut these tiny little

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:51.740 
know it's going to cut these tiny little
shakes<00:02:49.470> in<00:02:49.650> the<00:02:49.709> camera<00:02:49.980> whereas<00:02:50.880> by<00:02:51.180> using<00:02:51.480> a

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
shakes in the camera whereas by using a

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.810 
shakes in the camera whereas by using a
shoulder<00:02:52.350> rig<00:02:52.530> which<00:02:52.860> you're<00:02:53.430> basically

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820 
shoulder rig which you're basically

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:55.910 
shoulder rig which you're basically
eliminating<00:02:54.540> that<00:02:54.690> because<00:02:55.050> you're<00:02:55.320> right

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
eliminating that because you're right

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.170 
eliminating that because you're right
you<00:02:56.070> have<00:02:56.220> first<00:02:56.640> of<00:02:56.730> all<00:02:56.790> you<00:02:56.850> have<00:02:56.970> three

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
you have first of all you have three

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:58.490 
you have first of all you have three
points<00:02:57.420> of<00:02:57.480> contact<00:02:57.540> so<00:02:57.989> one<00:02:58.230> in<00:02:58.380> your

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
points of contact so one in your

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.530 
points of contact so one in your
shoulder<00:02:58.860> and<00:02:59.040> two<00:02:59.640> with<00:02:59.760> your<00:02:59.850> hands<00:03:00.150> but

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
shoulder and two with your hands but

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.300 
shoulder and two with your hands but
also<00:03:00.600> your<00:03:00.959> hands<00:03:01.260> are<00:03:01.350> further<00:03:01.620> apart<00:03:01.980> and

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
also your hands are further apart and

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.030 
also your hands are further apart and
because<00:03:02.580> of<00:03:02.700> that<00:03:02.850> the<00:03:03.569> the<00:03:03.959> motion<00:03:04.860> doesn't

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
because of that the the motion doesn't

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.860 
because of that the the motion doesn't
translate<00:03:05.400> as<00:03:05.670> much<00:03:05.910> and<00:03:06.150> to<00:03:06.239> in<00:03:06.360> today<00:03:06.660> you

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
translate as much and to in today you

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.780 
translate as much and to in today you
know<00:03:06.959> what<00:03:07.110> you<00:03:07.260> see<00:03:07.410> on<00:03:07.530> the<00:03:07.620> on<00:03:07.650> screen<00:03:08.010> and

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
know what you see on the on screen and

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.910 
know what you see on the on screen and
then<00:03:09.090> another<00:03:09.510> thing<00:03:09.720> you<00:03:09.840> can<00:03:09.959> do<00:03:10.140> with<00:03:10.560> it<00:03:10.739> is

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
then another thing you can do with it is

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.090 
then another thing you can do with it is
a<00:03:11.450> you<00:03:12.450> can<00:03:12.630> take<00:03:12.930> this<00:03:13.140> this<00:03:13.769> thing<00:03:13.950> in<00:03:14.040> the

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
a you can take this this thing in the

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.670 
a you can take this this thing in the
back<00:03:14.280> you<00:03:15.060> can<00:03:15.180> adjust<00:03:15.540> it<00:03:15.750> so<00:03:15.930> you<00:03:16.350> can<00:03:16.500> get

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
back you can adjust it so you can get

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.770 
back you can adjust it so you can get
this<00:03:16.830> kind<00:03:17.010> of<00:03:17.130> a<00:03:17.250> you<00:03:17.459> know<00:03:17.579> low<00:03:18.060> sort<00:03:18.570> of<00:03:18.660> a

a microphone and it's a little LED light

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:02.270 
a microphone and it's a little LED light
things<00:04:00.540> like<00:04:00.690> that<00:04:00.870> so<00:04:01.410> it<00:04:01.470> can<00:04:01.590> really<00:04:01.859> fast

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
things like that so it can really fast

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.280 
things like that so it can really fast
sort<00:04:02.790> of<00:04:02.880> customize<00:04:03.480> you<00:04:03.750> know<00:04:03.840> and<00:04:03.989> change

and the last thing that I really like
about<00:04:23.580> this<00:04:24.000> rig<00:04:24.210> is<00:04:24.240> that<00:04:24.479> it's<00:04:24.810> it's<00:04:25.200> made

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
about this rig is that it's it's made

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:27.010 
about this rig is that it's it's made
from<00:04:25.650> aluminium<00:04:25.830> so<00:04:26.400> they're<00:04:26.610> light

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.020 
from aluminium so they're light

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:30.490 
from aluminium so they're light
very<00:04:27.440> but<00:04:27.770> very<00:04:27.979> durable<00:04:28.270> and<00:04:29.270> also<00:04:29.810> it<00:04:29.990> faults

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:30.500 
very but very durable and also it faults

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.950 
very but very durable and also it faults
and<00:04:30.770> you<00:04:31.250> know<00:04:31.430> it<00:04:31.639> folds<00:04:32.030> away<00:04:32.150> so<00:04:32.330> that<00:04:32.539> it's

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:32.960 
and you know it folds away so that it's

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:34.659 
and you know it folds away so that it's
very<00:04:33.110> compact<00:04:33.470> and<00:04:33.770> it's<00:04:33.889> easy<00:04:34.069> to<00:04:34.250> put<00:04:34.400> let's

00:04:34.659 --> 00:04:34.669 
very compact and it's easy to put let's

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:35.830 
very compact and it's easy to put let's
see<00:04:34.759> in<00:04:34.819> your<00:04:34.910> camera<00:04:35.150> back<00:04:35.360> and<00:04:35.569> things<00:04:35.750> like

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:40.940 
this and as you can see it's it's not

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:42.730 
this and as you can see it's it's not
that<00:04:41.210> big<00:04:41.449> you<00:04:41.720> know<00:04:41.840> once<00:04:42.050> you<00:04:42.199> once<00:04:42.379> you<00:04:42.470> you

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:42.740 
that big you know once you once you you

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:44.559
