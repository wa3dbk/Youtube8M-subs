really be interested in each other and I
think<00:02:21.890> that's<00:02:22.250> what<00:02:22.520> we<00:02:22.750> we<00:02:23.750> help<00:02:23.990> model<00:02:24.410> this

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
think that's what we we help model this

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.340 
think that's what we we help model this
method<00:02:25.430> of<00:02:25.760> this<00:02:26.150> perturbation<00:02:26.420> method<00:02:27.200> will

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
method of this perturbation method will

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:31.350 
method of this perturbation method will
reach<00:02:27.560> all<00:02:28.370> different<00:02:29.060> kinds<00:02:29.570> of<00:02:29.810> learning

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
reach all different kinds of learning

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.940 
reach all different kinds of learning
learning<00:02:32.360> styles<00:02:32.959> you<00:02:33.500> know<00:02:33.620> whether<00:02:33.800> your

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
learning styles you know whether your

visual are what tactile what have you I

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:39.310 
visual are what tactile what have you I
think<00:02:37.370> it's<00:02:37.520> thank<00:02:38.240> you<00:02:38.450> it's<00:02:39.020> going<00:02:39.200> to<00:02:39.230> get

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:39.320 
think it's thank you it's going to get

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.580 
think it's thank you it's going to get
positive<00:02:39.530> experience<00:02:40.280> and

positive experience and

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.790 
positive experience and
no<00:02:43.220> a<00:02:43.250> great<00:02:43.550> way<00:02:43.760> to<00:02:43.819> reach<00:02:44.090> the<00:02:44.239> community

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 
no a great way to reach the community

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.430 
no a great way to reach the community
one<00:02:45.800> on<00:02:46.129> one<00:02:46.370> level<00:02:46.550> we're<00:02:46.849> all<00:02:47.000> connected<00:02:47.480> you

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
are we really are the world this is what

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.940 
are we really are the world this is what
the<00:02:55.489> world<00:02:55.760> is<00:02:56.090> and<00:02:56.480> so<00:02:57.050> we<00:02:57.200> want<00:02:57.440> students<00:02:57.860> to

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
the world is and so we want students to

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.250 
the world is and so we want students to
know<00:02:58.069> when<00:02:58.430> they<00:02:58.550> go<00:02:58.730> out<00:02:58.970> there<00:02:59.390> after<00:03:00.110> they

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
know when they go out there after they

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.440 
know when they go out there after they
leave<00:03:00.470> a<00:03:00.530> place<00:03:01.190> like<00:03:01.459> we<00:03:01.760> in<00:03:01.819> an<00:03:02.000> area<00:03:02.239> where

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
leave a place like we in an area where

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:04.780 
leave a place like we in an area where
it's<00:03:02.660> kind<00:03:02.959> of<00:03:03.080> insular<00:03:03.980> maybe<00:03:04.489> or<00:03:04.730> something

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
it's kind of insular maybe or something

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.210 
it's kind of insular maybe or something
that<00:03:05.569> this<00:03:06.019> is<00:03:06.230> what<00:03:06.410> they're<00:03:06.590> going<00:03:06.769> to<00:03:06.980> find

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
that this is what they're going to find

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.210 
that this is what they're going to find
I<00:03:07.610> think<00:03:07.970> we<00:03:08.120> teach<00:03:08.390> in<00:03:08.599> such<00:03:08.840> a<00:03:08.870> way<00:03:09.170> that<00:03:09.220> that

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220 
I think we teach in such a way that that

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:11.949 
I think we teach in such a way that that
they<00:03:10.459> take<00:03:10.730> on<00:03:10.940> a<00:03:10.970> ship<00:03:11.360> because<00:03:11.750> we're

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:11.959 
they take on a ship because we're

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:16.900 
they take on a ship because we're
engaged<00:03:12.410> but<00:03:12.799> they<00:03:12.980> also<00:03:13.220> find<00:03:15.670> their<00:03:16.670> own<00:03:16.700> way

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 
engaged but they also find their own way

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:20.470 
engaged but they also find their own way
of<00:03:17.209> expressing<00:03:17.810> themselves<00:03:18.560> and<00:03:19.370> the<00:03:19.579> context

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 
of expressing themselves and the context

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.270 
of expressing themselves and the context
from<00:03:20.660> which<00:03:20.720> they<00:03:21.140> do<00:03:21.200> that<00:03:21.650> gets<00:03:21.950> bigger

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
from which they do that gets bigger

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:26.130 
from which they do that gets bigger
Asian<00:03:23.239> African<00:03:23.680> Latino<00:03:24.680> American<00:03:25.250> history<00:03:25.760> is

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.140 
Asian African Latino American history is

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.920 
Asian African Latino American history is
American<00:03:27.140> history<00:03:27.620> is<00:03:27.650> it<00:03:28.310> is<00:03:28.579> so<00:03:29.480> we're<00:03:29.810> all

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
American history is it is so we're all

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.620 
American history is it is so we're all
in<00:03:29.959> the<00:03:30.170> same<00:03:30.200> house
