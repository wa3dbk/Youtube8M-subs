00:00:02.449 --> 00:00:07.649
 next to denied as they are the day of 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.870
 today we are going to talk as you already know about my 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.849
 favorites and believe me I'm aware that 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.290
 have a good one that I have not made videos 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.289
 of favorites but like you 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.180
 sometimes I do not convince myself how 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.520
 good is a product until as after 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.730
 of two months about how it works and 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.529
 what do I think and blah blah blah starting with 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:29.070
 the fruits of the face or the care of 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:32.550
 I have this skin for fighting export and 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:36.120
 the intense neutrogena and this is 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:38.340
 using already as for three months or more not 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.079
 they are setting it up if what I do not 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.960
 are you using so so often until you 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.210
 like a month but I already have or Sara 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.039
 using it more than a month obviously like this 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.620
 that I had not convinced myself yet if I 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:52.140
 I liked it or not and this I bought it together with 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:55.020
 this one by refining toner 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.910
 well they do not come together but that 's the pair 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.270
 and these two products are supposed to 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.850
 help reduce what 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.680
 is the appearance of the pores and that's not 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:07.160
 I am convinced to put the truth not 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.630
 I feel that it really reduces me 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:11.060
 pores and it made me like it has 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:13.070
 too much alcohol I do not know then what is 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.050
 as an exfoliating type but make 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.690
 mind that it is not super aggressive like 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:19.729
 of plants that you do not feel the lumps 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:21.229
 well as soon as you take it out and feel that way 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:22.760
 as a type of work the balls 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:24.979
 Lenses are super exfoliants 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:27.290
 delicate and I like to use it at 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:28.760
 end of the day and it is recommended to use it 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.800
 at night because of the fact that he has 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:32.270
 hard-rock yes so is that and recommend 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.890
 that if you are going to use it during the day 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:37.160
 put a blocker but I prefer 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:40.040
 do not take any chance and nothing else two 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:42.649
 nights as for the eyes I have the 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.899
 first that is more I want is not very 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:46.940
 clear what brand is the truth good for 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:48.410
 least for me it is not very clear but 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.509
 I'm going to let you know the 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:52.310
 nugget of info the front but what I 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:54.110
 like this more than now is one of 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.780
 the ones my sister brought me to try 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.800
 and it's the fact that it has microfiber 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.620
 room 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:03.140
 and has vitamin e apart from that too 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:05.780
 It is made of oil and has some other 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:08.150
 ingredients but I love the same 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.890
 than that of someone who has bone 

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:11.810
 mamey just like yesterday I woke up 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.660
 the lashes do not lower them on the 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.820
 you let super deny me lengthens them and I do not 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:19.640
 they make horrible lumps like that the only thing that 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:21.710
 yes it is that as the brush is huge not 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.830
 I know if you can see them is super 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:27.380
 fat I do not like the most good my 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.430
 tabs down because it ended up like 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.440
 raccoon 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.030
 so for this purpose state 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.070
 using this from Milan and that is called 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.560
 rhombus and the setsi the effect of this 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:38.510
 mask as I had told you in a 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.880
 theoretical video that also on facebook 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.860
 instagram you give them two tabs that 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.630
 wrist effect this is what was 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:48.020
 using for the tabs below 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:49.760
 fitting because he brush is super 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:53.270
 habitat so that I like super good 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:55.040
 and you leave them super super long the 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:57.500
 it's true that it obsesses me how they let me 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.210
 the tabs below I have been not 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.910
 I know a lot about the clouds 

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:04.280
 lately and I have several favorites 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:06.980
 I have one and the first one is the one I bring 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:09.440
 because right now it's the sun and 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.690
 soria I made a review on my blog 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:14.780
 obviously I'm going to leave them down there 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:16.940
 in the info box and the next one is 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:19.460
 this one that came to me from the ipsi bag 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:23.150
 it's called helen I love it because it's 

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:25.760
 super super ligerito and light is 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:27.770
 a little creamier and this is supposed 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:30.320
 which is a lip balm and really 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:36.170
 so it increases your lips but it does not feel 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:38.390
 I 'm from Milan and obviously you 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:41.330
 They know that I am obsessed with all 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:44.150
 the fruits of milani and this is called new 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:47.090
 game and it looks like this I feel like it's one of 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:49.280
 those flaws that you can not 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:51.170
 missing in your collection if you 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:53.180

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:55.610
 new and in the nails of state using 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:57.920
 without stopping this one called running beef 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:59.750
 which is sally hansen like I feel 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:03.100

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:07.810
 color is orange coral peaches 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:07.810
 and of course I do not bring it 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:18.140

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:20.750

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:41.600

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:51.740

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:56.300
