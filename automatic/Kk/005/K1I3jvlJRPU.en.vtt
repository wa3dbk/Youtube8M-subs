and<00:00:36.030> start<00:00:36.239> pumping<00:00:36.570> some<00:00:36.780> synovial<00:00:37.260> fluid

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
and start pumping some synovial fluid

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.680 
and start pumping some synovial fluid
into<00:00:37.860> the<00:00:37.890> muscles<00:00:38.340> which<00:00:38.579> is<00:00:38.760> what<00:00:39.390> you<00:00:39.480> need

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
into the muscles which is what you need

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.389 
into the muscles which is what you need
to<00:00:39.930> warm<00:00:40.379> up<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.590> muscles<00:00:40.890> before<00:00:41.040> we<00:00:41.280> even

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
to warm up the muscles before we even

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:41.720 
to warm up the muscles before we even
begin

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
begin

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.880 
begin
so<00:00:42.690> as<00:00:42.750> I'm<00:00:42.870> warming<00:00:43.110> up<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.200> shoulders<00:00:45.890> and

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
so as I'm warming up the shoulders and

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.490 
so as I'm warming up the shoulders and
then<00:00:47.010> I<00:00:47.100> can<00:00:47.250> start<00:00:47.870> contracting<00:00:48.870> the<00:00:48.960> ABS<00:00:49.110> and

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
then I can start contracting the ABS and

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.100 
then I can start contracting the ABS and
shifting<00:00:49.890> my<00:00:50.010> weight<00:00:50.039> a<00:00:50.219> little<00:00:50.370> bit<00:00:50.610> more<00:00:51.110> to

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
shifting my weight a little bit more to

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.680 
shifting my weight a little bit more to
each<00:00:52.260> side<00:00:55.670> you<00:00:56.670> want<00:00:56.789> to<00:00:56.850> breathe<00:00:57.030> don't<00:00:57.600> hold

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
each side you want to breathe don't hold

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.110 
each side you want to breathe don't hold
your<00:00:57.899> breath

00:00:59.110 --> 00:00:59.120 
your breath

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.459 
your breath

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
and then notice actually each time I'm

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.780 
and then notice actually each time I'm
turning<00:01:03.809> I'm<00:01:04.229> picking<00:01:04.830> up<00:01:04.920> my<00:01:05.100> heel<00:01:05.400> up<00:01:05.640> off

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.640 
up is the very first thing you're doing
in<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.080> warm-up<00:01:22.380> of<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.560> shoulders<00:01:24.650> begin

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
in the warm-up of the shoulders begin

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.969 
in the warm-up of the shoulders begin
just<00:01:25.979> rotating<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:26.610> shoulders<00:01:27.680> pump<00:01:28.680> in<00:01:28.829> some

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
just rotating the shoulders pump in some

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.920 
just rotating the shoulders pump in some
synovial<00:01:29.520> fluid<00:01:29.549> into<00:01:30.150> those<00:01:30.299> muscle<00:01:30.659> groups

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
synovial fluid into those muscle groups

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.100 
synovial fluid into those muscle groups
that<00:01:31.200> flew<00:01:31.619> in<00:01:31.799> just<00:01:31.950> moves<00:01:32.250> through<00:01:33.110> the

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
that flew in just moves through the

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.719 
that flew in just moves through the
larger<00:01:34.470> muscle<00:01:34.829> groups<00:01:34.860> and<00:01:35.310> it<00:01:35.430> just<00:01:35.549> helps

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
larger muscle groups and it just helps

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:41.749 
larger muscle groups and it just helps
to<00:01:35.759> warm<00:01:35.970> em<00:01:36.060> up<00:01:40.189> and<00:01:41.189> then<00:01:41.369> we're<00:01:41.640> gonna

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
to warm em up and then we're gonna

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.240 
to warm em up and then we're gonna
actually<00:01:42.000> eventually<00:01:42.540> do<00:01:42.720> is<00:01:42.869> make<00:01:43.649> sure<00:01:43.680> that

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
actually eventually do is make sure that

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.340 
actually eventually do is make sure that
my<00:01:44.909> heels<00:01:45.270> are<00:01:45.479> picking<00:01:45.750> up<00:01:45.840> off<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.140> ground

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
my heels are picking up off the ground

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.630 
my heels are picking up off the ground
because<00:01:46.500> if<00:01:46.770> they're<00:01:46.890> staying<00:01:47.100> planted

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
because if they're staying planted

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.310 
because if they're staying planted
what's<00:01:48.509> gonna<00:01:48.659> happen<00:01:49.020> is<00:01:49.140> you're<00:01:49.259> gonna

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
what's gonna happen is you're gonna

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.780 
what's gonna happen is you're gonna
start<00:01:49.500> tweaking<00:01:50.009> your<00:01:50.100> knees<00:01:50.310> and<00:01:50.579> you<00:01:50.640> don't

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
start tweaking your knees and you don't

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.819 
start tweaking your knees and you don't
want<00:01:50.970> that<00:01:51.090> so<00:01:51.630> heels<00:01:51.899> need<00:01:52.170> to<00:01:52.259> pick<00:01:52.470> up<00:01:52.590> each

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
want that so heels need to pick up each

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.999 
want that so heels need to pick up each
time<00:01:53.100> I<00:01:53.130> rotate<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:53.790> shoulder<00:01:54.649> especially<00:01:55.649> if

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
time I rotate the shoulder especially if

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.590 
time I rotate the shoulder especially if
you<00:01:56.130> could<00:01:56.280> figure<00:01:56.549> and<00:01:57.149> I<00:01:57.240> make<00:01:57.420> these<00:01:57.570> a

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
you could figure and I make these a

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.270 
you could figure and I make these a
little<00:01:57.689> bit<00:01:57.869> bigger<00:01:58.140> and<00:01:58.649> I<00:01:58.799> want<00:01:58.950> to<00:01:59.009> pick<00:01:59.159> the

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
little bit bigger and I want to pick the

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.510 
little bit bigger and I want to pick the
heels<00:01:59.520> up<00:01:59.729> off<00:01:59.880> the<00:02:00.090> ground<00:02:01.100> and<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:02.219> reason

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
heels up off the ground and the reason

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
heels up off the ground and the reason
for<00:02:02.640> that<00:02:02.700> is<00:02:02.969> that<00:02:03.060> you<00:02:03.149> don't<00:02:03.270> want<00:02:03.420> to<00:02:03.479> keep

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
for that is that you don't want to keep

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:04.639 
for that is that you don't want to keep
you<00:02:03.630> don't<00:02:03.840> want<00:02:03.960> to<00:02:04.020> keep<00:02:04.110> them<00:02:04.229> planted

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
you don't want to keep them planted

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:05.690 
you don't want to keep them planted
because<00:02:04.860> if<00:02:04.920> you<00:02:04.979> keep<00:02:05.100> them<00:02:05.189> planted<00:02:05.579> you're

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
because if you keep them planted you're

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.219 
because if you keep them planted you're
going<00:02:05.820> to<00:02:05.880> tweak<00:02:06.149> them<00:02:06.329> when<00:02:06.630> I<00:02:06.659> try<00:02:06.899> to<00:02:06.960> turn

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
going to tweak them when I try to turn

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.209 
going to tweak them when I try to turn
they<00:02:08.099> need<00:02:08.220> to<00:02:08.310> lift<00:02:08.459> up<00:02:08.640> off<00:02:08.849> the<00:02:08.879> ground
