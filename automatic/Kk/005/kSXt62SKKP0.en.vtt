00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:16.800 
I'm not on the court so I kind of think

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.159 
I'm not on the court so I kind of think
that<00:05:17.039> that<00:05:17.190> defense<00:05:17.580> thinker<00:05:17.970> might<00:05:18.659> be<00:05:18.870> like

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:19.169 
that that defense thinker might be like

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:21.050 
that that defense thinker might be like
working<00:05:19.560> out<00:05:19.680> but<00:05:19.919> sometimes<00:05:20.370> I<00:05:20.639> don't<00:05:20.729> know

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:21.060 
working out but sometimes I don't know

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:22.580 
working out but sometimes I don't know
because<00:05:21.240> we<00:05:21.690> still<00:05:21.900> don't<00:05:22.050> be<00:05:22.110> getting<00:05:22.349> stops

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:22.590

because we still don't be getting stops
like<00:05:22.860> how<00:05:23.039> I<00:05:23.310> think<00:05:23.699> that<00:05:23.880> we<00:05:24.000> should<00:05:24.030> be

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:24.360 
like how I think that we should be

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:26.450 
like how I think that we should be
hearing<00:05:24.539> stops<00:05:24.810> cuz<00:05:25.349> you<00:05:25.470> know<00:05:25.560> on<00:05:25.770> later<00:05:26.340> on

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:26.460 
hearing stops cuz you know on later on

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:28.490
