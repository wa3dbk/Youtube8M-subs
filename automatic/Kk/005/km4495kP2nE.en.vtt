00:06:11.469 --> 00:06:13.600 
a child of change I my success was
guaranteed<00:06:12.469> by<00:06:12.709> the<00:06:13.069> beginning<00:06:13.219> of<00:06:13.489> the

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:13.610 
guaranteed by the beginning of the

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:15.399 
guaranteed by the beginning of the
reforms<00:06:13.999> in<00:06:14.119> the<00:06:14.149> country<00:06:14.569> otherwise<00:06:14.839> I<00:06:14.989> don't

00:06:15.399 --> 00:06:15.409 
reforms in the country otherwise I don't

00:06:15.409 --> 00:06:18.399 
reforms in the country otherwise I don't
think<00:06:15.589> I<00:06:15.679> had<00:06:15.860> a<00:06:15.889> chance<00:06:16.159> to<00:06:16.459> to<00:06:17.209> play<00:06:17.719> the<00:06:17.989> fair

00:06:18.399 --> 00:06:18.409 
think I had a chance to to play the fair

00:06:18.409 --> 00:06:23.799 
think I had a chance to to play the fair
competition<00:06:18.799> with<00:06:19.159> carpet<00:06:19.549> or<00:06:19.819> the<00:06:21.189> really<00:06:22.809> do

00:06:23.799 --> 00:06:23.809 
competition with carpet or the really do

00:06:23.809 --> 00:06:27.159 
competition with carpet or the really do
love<00:06:23.989> product<00:06:24.439> of<00:06:24.529> the<00:06:24.649> system<00:06:25.809> but<00:06:26.809> later

00:06:27.159 --> 00:06:27.169 
love product of the system but later

00:06:27.169 --> 00:06:29.799 
love product of the system but later
we'll<00:06:27.439> only<00:06:27.589> know<00:06:27.829> that<00:06:28.069> the<00:06:28.339> I<00:06:28.669> realized<00:06:29.539> the

00:06:29.799 --> 00:06:29.809 
we'll only know that the I realized the

00:06:29.809 --> 00:06:33.279 
we'll only know that the I realized the
change<00:06:30.139> in<00:06:30.579> in<00:06:31.579> garage<00:06:32.419> of<00:06:32.569> terms<00:06:32.779> was<00:06:33.109> not

00:06:33.279 --> 00:06:33.289 
change in in garage of terms was not

00:06:33.289 --> 00:06:35.639 
change in in garage of terms was not
enough<00:06:33.499> for<00:06:33.529> the<00:06:33.739> country<00:06:34.069> that<00:06:34.159> was<00:06:34.459> the

00:06:35.639 --> 00:06:35.649 
enough for the country that was the

00:06:35.649 --> 00:06:38.909 
enough for the country that was the
reconstruction<00:06:36.649> or<00:06:36.799> perestroika<00:06:37.669> of<00:06:38.089> the

00:06:38.909 --> 00:06:38.919 
reconstruction or perestroika of the

00:06:38.919 --> 00:06:41.799 
reconstruction or perestroika of the
system<00:06:39.919> and<00:06:40.009> we<00:06:40.849> needed<00:06:41.029> for<00:06:41.239> a<00:06:41.299> stroke<00:06:41.539> of<00:06:41.659> the

00:06:41.799 --> 00:06:41.809 
system and we needed for a stroke of the

00:06:41.809 --> 00:06:44.829 
system and we needed for a stroke of the
society<00:06:42.319> I<00:06:42.969> think<00:06:43.969> that<00:06:44.149> there<00:06:44.509> are<00:06:44.539> some

00:06:44.829 --> 00:06:44.839 
society I think that there are some

00:06:44.839 --> 00:06:46.899 
society I think that there are some
possibilities<00:06:45.379> to<00:06:45.829> to<00:06:46.009> coordinate<00:06:46.789> our

00:06:46.899 --> 00:06:46.909 
possibilities to to coordinate our

00:06:46.909 --> 00:06:49.269 
possibilities to to coordinate our
efforts<00:06:47.119> to<00:06:47.449> go<00:06:47.629> out<00:06:47.779> of<00:06:47.959> the<00:06:48.019> crisis<00:06:48.499> but<00:06:49.099> as

00:06:49.269 --> 00:06:49.279 
efforts to go out of the crisis but as

00:06:49.279 --> 00:06:51.159 
efforts to go out of the crisis but as
you<00:06:49.399> know<00:06:49.549> it's<00:06:49.789> not<00:06:49.909> easy<00:06:49.969> because<00:06:50.479> people

00:06:51.159 --> 00:06:51.169 
you know it's not easy because people

00:06:51.169 --> 00:06:54.729 
you know it's not easy because people
are<00:06:51.349> you<00:06:51.529> know<00:06:51.649> normally<00:06:53.049> they<00:06:54.049> used<00:06:54.349> to<00:06:54.499> blame

00:06:54.729 --> 00:06:54.739 
are you know normally they used to blame

00:06:54.739 --> 00:06:56.529 
are you know normally they used to blame
their<00:06:54.949> neighbors<00:06:55.399> for<00:06:55.579> their<00:06:55.819> troubles<00:06:56.269> and<00:06:56.419> I

00:06:56.529 --> 00:06:56.539 
their neighbors for their troubles and I

00:06:56.539 --> 00:06:57.549 
their neighbors for their troubles and I
think<00:06:56.719> the<00:06:56.779> troubles<00:06:57.109> won't<00:06:57.199> do<00:06:57.379> over

00:06:57.549 --> 00:06:57.559 
think the troubles won't do over

00:06:57.559 --> 00:06:59.619 
think the troubles won't do over
tomorrow<00:06:57.919> and<00:06:58.219> that's<00:06:58.729> why<00:06:58.999> the<00:06:59.059> oldest

00:06:59.619 --> 00:06:59.629 
tomorrow and that's why the oldest

00:06:59.629 --> 00:07:02.439 
tomorrow and that's why the oldest
national<00:06:59.869> crisis<00:07:00.529> will<00:07:00.949> continue<00:07:01.669> for<00:07:01.909> for<00:07:02.419> a

00:07:02.439 --> 00:07:02.449 
national crisis will continue for for a

00:07:02.449 --> 00:07:04.689 
national crisis will continue for for a
while
