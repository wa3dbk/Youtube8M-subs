00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
putting another one in there you see the

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.499 
putting another one in there you see the
stack<00:02:01.829> size<00:02:02.130> increase<00:02:02.520> so<00:02:03.000> if<00:02:03.090> I<00:02:03.180> would<00:02:03.360> draw

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
stack size increase so if I would draw

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.209 
stack size increase so if I would draw
here<00:02:03.719> I<00:02:03.750> can<00:02:03.899> root<00:02:04.020> draw<00:02:04.200> too<00:02:04.469> so<00:02:04.979> it's<00:02:05.070> very

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
here I can root draw too so it's very

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:06.709
