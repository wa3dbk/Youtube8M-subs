 but here different oils are in general what 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:47.829
 me 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:53.290
 nails are a must for 

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:56.019

00:02:56.019 --> 00:03:00.849
 exactly there I shoot the video but mostly 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:02.379
 I put on makeup here so everything 

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:07.599

 we rinse, in principle, any layer 

00:03:52.659 --> 00:03:58.760
 It seems to me that the shelf looks like this 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:02.780
 above here 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:06.340
 perfumes and hair care products 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:10.000
 by the way about kerastase want 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:14.870
 previous videos were about this care 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:18.880
 girls I found out that the real 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:20.750
 kerastase is sold only in showrooms 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:23.150
 which are official 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:26.930
 representatives of the cosmetics you 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:30.229
 for the quality of you communicate and meet one hundred 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:32.080
 percent online stores and some 

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:35.210
 shops of professional cosmetics 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:38.030
 honestly can sell fakes 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:40.990
 so be careful here and show 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:44.000
 so very fluently one single compartment 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:46.430
 I really don't have cosmetics 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:50.510
 some crazy boxes in which 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:54.500
 I have tons of cosmetics I try very much 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:57.310
 nice to distribute correctly 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:59.300
 if i don't use and give away either 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:02.330
 throw it away if it is valid 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:04.910
 ends so i have one 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:06.830
 one branch which i will say so 

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:11.270
 using so most often up 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:15.470

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:26.389

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:40.430

 a small viewer of my locker 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:53.620
 cosmetics so now I will be going to 

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:57.050
 work because you have to run already 

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:59.870

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:02.570
