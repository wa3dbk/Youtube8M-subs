now the chips are very similar
difference<00:01:17.400> is<00:01:17.549> just<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:18.119> clock<00:01:18.390> speed<00:01:19.020> and

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
difference is just the clock speed and

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.020 
difference is just the clock speed and
how<00:01:19.290> they're<00:01:19.470> operating<00:01:19.500> so<00:01:20.340> we're<00:01:20.880> going<00:01:20.970> to

there you see it the geek bench to score
on<00:04:04.040> both<00:04:04.459> these<00:04:04.579> devices<00:04:04.759> just<00:04:05.750> for<00:04:06.049> fun<00:04:06.439> we're

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:07.340 
on both these devices just for fun we're

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.280 
on both these devices just for fun we're
going<00:04:07.459> to<00:04:07.549> take<00:04:07.729> a<00:04:07.759> look<00:04:08.090> at<00:04:08.209> the<00:04:08.359> end<00:04:08.599> to<00:04:08.959> two

00:04:16.629 --> 00:04:16.639 
at the antutu scores we'll throw those

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:19.719 
at the antutu scores we'll throw those
in<00:04:16.849> just<00:04:17.479> for<00:04:17.750> fun<00:04:18.019> the<00:04:18.349> antutu<00:04:18.769> benchmark<00:04:19.010> is

00:04:19.719 --> 00:04:19.729 
in just for fun the antutu benchmark is

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:20.649 
in just for fun the antutu benchmark is
also<00:04:20.150> another

00:04:20.649 --> 00:04:20.659 
also another

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:23.610
