would but this is what the fruit looks

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:26.440 
would but this is what the fruit looks
like<00:00:24.140> on<00:00:24.890> the<00:00:25.430> outside<00:00:25.460> so<00:00:25.940> it<00:00:25.970> actually<00:00:26.150> has

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:26.450 
like on the outside so it actually has

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:28.300 
like on the outside so it actually has
kind<00:00:26.810> of<00:00:26.900> like<00:00:26.990> a<00:00:27.050> skin<00:00:27.470> that<00:00:27.500> covers<00:00:28.010> it<00:00:28.160> and

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:28.310 
kind of like a skin that covers it and

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:32.019 
kind of like a skin that covers it and
then<00:00:28.880> it<00:00:29.060> pops<00:00:29.420> and<00:00:29.950> it<00:00:30.950> magically<00:00:31.640> looks<00:00:31.880> like

00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:32.029 
then it pops and it magically looks like

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:33.280 
then it pops and it magically looks like
that<00:00:32.180> which<00:00:32.509> is<00:00:32.660> what<00:00:32.810> we<00:00:32.900> have<00:00:33.050> right<00:00:33.260> here

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:33.290 
that which is what we have right here

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:37.110 
that which is what we have right here
that's<00:00:34.280> the<00:00:34.430> actual<00:00:34.820> nut<00:00:35.000> and<00:00:35.300> that<00:00:35.410> is

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:37.120 
that's the actual nut and that is

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.550 
that's the actual nut and that is
probably<00:00:38.120> how<00:00:38.390> you<00:00:38.450> spell<00:00:39.140> lychee<00:00:39.380> and

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:39.560 
probably how you spell lychee and

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.850 
probably how you spell lychee and
Mandarin<00:00:40.070> or<00:00:40.250> something<00:00:40.550> ever<00:00:40.990> so<00:00:41.990> really<00:00:42.620> the

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:42.860 
Mandarin or something ever so really the

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.130 
Mandarin or something ever so really the
drink<00:00:43.130> is<00:00:43.280> pretty<00:00:43.610> basic<00:00:43.960> we're<00:00:44.960> going<00:00:45.079> to

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:45.140 
drink is pretty basic we're going to

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:46.540 
drink is pretty basic we're going to
start<00:00:45.410> with<00:00:45.500> 2<00:00:45.710> ounces<00:00:46.160> of<00:00:46.340> your<00:00:46.490> favorite

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:46.550 
start with 2 ounces of your favorite

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:55.600 
start with 2 ounces of your favorite
vodka<00:00:50.829> and<00:00:52.900> then<00:00:53.900> the<00:00:54.260> liquid<00:00:54.530> that<00:00:55.040> the

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:55.610 
vodka and then the liquid that the

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:57.100 
vodka and then the liquid that the
leeches<00:00:55.970> are<00:00:56.120> packed<00:00:56.360> in<00:00:56.600> that's<00:00:56.840> what<00:00:57.020> we

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:57.110 
leeches are packed in that's what we

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:59.460 
leeches are packed in that's what we
call<00:00:57.290> lychee<00:00:57.680> juice<00:00:57.890> you<00:00:58.579> can<00:00:58.730> also<00:00:58.910> use

00:00:59.460 --> 00:00:59.470 
call lychee juice you can also use

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:02.410 
call lychee juice you can also use
lychee<00:01:00.470> liqueur<00:01:00.739> but<00:01:01.310> I<00:01:01.340> find<00:01:01.910> that<00:01:02.060> lychee

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:02.420 
lychee liqueur but I find that lychee

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.780 
lychee liqueur but I find that lychee
liqueur<00:01:02.600> sometimes<00:01:03.230> it's<00:01:03.500> too<00:01:04.400> sweet<00:01:04.550> and

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:04.790 
liqueur sometimes it's too sweet and

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:05.920 
liqueur sometimes it's too sweet and
doesn't<00:01:04.850> really<00:01:05.120> taste<00:01:05.360> like<00:01:05.449> lychee<00:01:05.750> so

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:05.930 
doesn't really taste like lychee so

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:07.600 
doesn't really taste like lychee so
we're<00:01:06.020> going<00:01:06.110> to<00:01:06.170> use<00:01:06.350> the<00:01:06.650> same<00:01:06.830> amount<00:01:06.950> which

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610 
we're going to use the same amount which

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.969 
we're going to use the same amount which
is<00:01:07.760> two<00:01:07.970> ounces<00:01:08.120> of<00:01:08.720> this<00:01:09.229> liquid<00:01:09.740> that<00:01:09.770> they

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:09.979 
is two ounces of this liquid that they

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:12.700 
is two ounces of this liquid that they
they<00:01:10.340> pack<00:01:10.610> in<00:01:10.790> it<00:01:10.940> it's<00:01:11.810> probably<00:01:12.320> sugar<00:01:12.560> in

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710 
they pack in it it's probably sugar in

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.010 
they pack in it it's probably sugar in
water<00:01:12.890> but<00:01:13.190> with<00:01:13.340> time<00:01:13.610> inside<00:01:14.510> the<00:01:14.659> can<00:01:14.870> it

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020
