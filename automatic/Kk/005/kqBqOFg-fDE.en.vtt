00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:10.980
 so keep coming to a new video thanks 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.480
 to turn on my name is human 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.400
 because today I bring you a new one 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.320
 consequence of combat arms 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.050
 the series is about different 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.760
 weapons for primary and secondary weapons too 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.830
 you can test the suggestions of it 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.810
 right in the comments six years 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.640
 write under this video or me 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.769
 just look for a darling setup from 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.810
 another battlefield youtuber out 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.669
 and try to play with it and it 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.890
 possibly even to improve 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.530
 today's setup of lost aiming 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.719
 consists of the ska h with cody visier 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.030
 the green laser visor 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.910
 muzzle fire damper and out of the 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:48.239
 have vertical handle as second weapon 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:51.000
 but we have the p2 126 without one 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.070
 single tower to stop the power 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.620
 from this summer especially at the 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.180
 scale is not overlooked and 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.579
 convinced strong on short to medium 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.460
 Distances strengthens the weapon thereby 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.350
 that you do a very high damage of 34 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.979
 on a short distance and still 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:10.350
 25 on longer distances makes up for it 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.600
 is the firing rate with its 600 20 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.909
 shot per minute not very high though 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.070
 that does not matter too much 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.259
 You still have a decent one 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.420
 damage that you hand out per hit 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:25.439
 it can be a bit problematic 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:27.000
 at the magazine size of 20 + 1 what it 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.860
 sometimes a bit harder 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.780
 more than three opponents with only one 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.670
 single magazine to be able to do 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.890
 every shot should be valid 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.840
 I will not bring that either 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.700
 especially good and not in all 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.100
 situations especially that one sees in 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.770
 me quite often because I'm not 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.840
 the master of squinting but what 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.689
 I'll get a few kids anyway 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.729
 hin that of lost selected coyote 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.720
 visier is also one of my 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.610
 favorite sight 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.409
 actually it is even my opinion 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.119
 after all the best as you yes because it is one 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.640
 quite narrow border has and 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:02.009
 at the same time offers a large field of vision 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.270
 another essay on the weapon is 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.369
 the laser sight 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.899
 strictly speaking, the green laser sight 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:09.179
 this can be the accuracy of 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:11.129
 shoot from the hip improve 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.780
 if that especially with a weapon 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:14.640
 biasca rather little 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.220
 The laser works effectively 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:20.580
 still look at the one or the other 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:22.050
 others meet your opponent but it 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.640
 should really only be on 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.250
 if you really on short distances 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:29.850
 is traveling or for example a 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:31.800
 opponents around the next corner suspected lust 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.600
 has also decided to one 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.400
 run tower to take the no 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.170
 statistical but still 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.720
 playful influence on the weapon 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:42.600
 takes with the muzzle fire damper 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:45.030
 just muzzle fire is hidden otherwise 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.860
 he does not change any values ​​of the weapon 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.440
 and so she plays herself again 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.420
 before under the run is then still the 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.950
 club handle mounted works and 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.290
 Angled handle since the way 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.600
 completely identical but look different 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:00.000
 and are each unlocked differently 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.890
 So if you have one of the two flu 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.830
 has mounted the recoil the man 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.900
 At the beginning of a fire ointment gets something 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:09.030
 it reduces the others 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.870
 hopefully something easier 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.060
 can happen 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:14.069
 The recoil at the star is really 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:16.350
 in my opinion quite fierce and 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:18.690
 That's why you can actually talk about any one 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:21.890
 Reduction for it just to be glad 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:23.459
 be with the second weapon but he has dp 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:25.950
 226 here 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:28.680
 That's one of the best pistols 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:30.870
 doing so on both short and on 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:33.000
 slightly longer distances quite well 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:35.160
 Of course , you play 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.870
 guns never on such long distances 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:39.120
 such as with a storm rifle 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:41.070
 but it can never hurt a good one 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.620
 allrounder pistol with you 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:45.390
 whether the pistol I would only still 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:48.150
 a laser visiert grab on it because 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:50.310
 It really can never hurt if you do 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:52.829
 not him all the time has micro 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:56.010
 So management is an important thing 

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:58.680
 otherwise you will find it easier because 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:00.420
 your player how stupid lights in the big 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.760
 and all the equipment that you 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:05.820
 lost aiming as his or one of his 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:07.650
 favorite equipments really call 

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:09.859
 balanced well and I have myself 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:12.989
 before that with a very similar one 

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:15.299
 equipment played is also interesting 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:17.880
 that with the ska h actually the 

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:20.039
 chance for a real hit kids 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:22.380
 does when you meet in the head that is 

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:23.260
 of course, an error, and therefore are the 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:27.370
 ska 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:29.290
 and also the 152 cqb banned in the esl 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:31.510
 so far my knowledge about it 

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:34.090
 currently your knowledge is on the 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:37.180
 equipment from losail so the ska and 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:38.650
 the p2 126 is hopefully on the 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:40.690
 latest stand and I hope that it 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:41.770
 you liked to watch if that 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:44.230
 of course the case would be me 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:45.850
 very happy about a thumbs up 

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:48.580
 and if you have more weapons very 

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:51.070
 or follow by combat arms and more 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:51.850
 You also want to be able to see an abo 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:54.460
 let there 

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:56.200
 on facebook twitter and google + are available 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:58.540
 more information too 

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:59.980
 my live streams so jam over and 

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:02.170
 do not miss any of them 

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:04.620
 Thank you, you will see and see you 

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:04.620
 next time
