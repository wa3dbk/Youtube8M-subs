but is a disassembled xbox360 this

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:35.270 
but is a disassembled xbox360 this
xbox360<00:00:33.690> is<00:00:33.989> one<00:00:34.200> of<00:00:34.290> the<00:00:34.380> original<00:00:34.920> ones<00:00:34.950> like

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
xbox360 is one of the original ones like

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.340 
xbox360 is one of the original ones like
the<00:00:35.460> white<00:00:35.730> bulky<00:00:36.360> ones<00:00:36.600> and<00:00:36.930> it<00:00:37.260> was

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
the white bulky ones and it was

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.630 
the white bulky ones and it was
basically<00:00:37.559> just<00:00:37.800> sitting<00:00:38.070> over<00:00:38.129> there<00:00:38.399> and<00:00:38.579> it

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
basically just sitting over there and it

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.850 
basically just sitting over there and it
was<00:00:38.730> doing<00:00:38.969> nothing<00:00:39.540> so<00:00:39.840> I<00:00:39.870> decided<00:00:40.530> to

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
was doing nothing so I decided to

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.610 
was doing nothing so I decided to
disassemble<00:00:41.700> it<00:00:41.850> and<00:00:42.360> in<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.110> process<00:00:43.469> of

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
disassemble it and in the process of

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.650 
disassemble it and in the process of
disassembling<00:00:43.890> it<00:00:44.489> I<00:00:44.760> realized<00:00:45.180> there's<00:00:45.510> no

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
disassembling it I realized there's no

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.270 
disassembling it I realized there's no
turning<00:00:46.050> back<00:00:46.079> because<00:00:46.649> one<00:00:46.860> of<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:47.039> side

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
turning back because one of the side

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.250 
turning back because one of the side
panels<00:00:47.760> was<00:00:47.910> so<00:00:48.149> stuck<00:00:48.539> on<00:00:48.690> this<00:00:48.840> thing<00:00:49.020> it<00:00:49.140> has

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
panels was so stuck on this thing it has

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.080 
panels was so stuck on this thing it has
never<00:00:49.379> been<00:00:49.469> just<00:00:49.590> a<00:00:49.829> symbol<00:00:50.100> before<00:00:50.280> the

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
never been just a symbol before the

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.510 
never been just a symbol before the
little<00:00:51.360> clips<00:00:51.690> on<00:00:51.840> it<00:00:51.989> broke<00:00:52.260> off<00:00:52.469> so<00:00:53.129> unless<00:00:53.370> I

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
little clips on it broke off so unless I

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.270 
little clips on it broke off so unless I
wanted<00:00:53.730> to<00:00:53.820> get<00:00:54.120> all<00:00:54.239> mod<00:00:54.449> it<00:00:54.629> back<00:00:54.960> together

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.280 
wanted to get all mod it back together

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.910 
wanted to get all mod it back together
it's<00:00:56.280> gonna<00:00:56.610> stay<00:00:56.940> like<00:00:56.969> this<00:00:57.239> I<00:00:57.920> disassembled

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
it's gonna stay like this I disassembled

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.779 
it's gonna stay like this I disassembled
the<00:00:58.980> Xbox<00:00:59.460> mainly<00:01:00.270> because<00:01:00.930> I<00:01:01.320> wanted<00:01:01.980> to<00:01:02.160> put

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
the Xbox mainly because I wanted to put

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.810 
the Xbox mainly because I wanted to put
it<00:01:02.910> in<00:01:03.239> mineral<00:01:03.870> oil<00:01:03.989> I<00:01:04.379> wanted<00:01:05.369> to<00:01:05.460> make<00:01:05.610> it

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
it in mineral oil I wanted to make it

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:06.380 
it in mineral oil I wanted to make it
mineral<00:01:06.090> oil

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
mineral oil

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.910 
mineral oil
xbox360<00:01:07.260> and<00:01:07.640> just<00:01:08.640> like<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:08.850> mineral<00:01:09.119> oil<00:01:09.210> PC

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 
xbox360 and just like the mineral oil PC

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.679 
xbox360 and just like the mineral oil PC
basically<00:01:10.920> straightforward<00:01:11.580> get<00:01:12.420> a<00:01:12.450> fish

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
basically straightforward get a fish

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:13.100 
basically straightforward get a fish
tank

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
tank

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.810 
tank
dunk<00:01:13.350> it<00:01:13.409> in<00:01:13.530> mineral<00:01:13.799> oil<00:01:13.920> maybe<00:01:14.280> get<00:01:14.610> some

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
dunk it in mineral oil maybe get some

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.010 
dunk it in mineral oil maybe get some
pumps<00:01:15.119> and<00:01:15.270> filters<00:01:15.360> I<00:01:15.570> haven't<00:01:15.840> really

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
pumps and filters I haven't really

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.539 
pumps and filters I haven't really
decided<00:01:16.409> if<00:01:16.680> I<00:01:16.740> only<00:01:16.860> had<00:01:16.979> a<00:01:17.009> pump<00:01:17.280> and

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
decided if I only had a pump and

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:18.800 
decided if I only had a pump and
radiator<00:01:17.939> there<00:01:18.150> might<00:01:18.240> be<00:01:18.270> something<00:01:18.659> in<00:01:18.750> the

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
radiator there might be something in the

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.390 
radiator there might be something in the
future<00:01:19.020> I<00:01:19.439> might<00:01:19.770> figure<00:01:19.979> out<00:01:20.070> another<00:01:20.220> way<00:01:20.369> to

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
future I might figure out another way to

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.760 
future I might figure out another way to
cool<00:01:20.729> it<00:01:20.909> for<00:01:21.090> now<00:01:21.210> this<00:01:21.720> is<00:01:21.780> an<00:01:21.990> Xbox<00:01:22.409> I<00:01:22.560> really
