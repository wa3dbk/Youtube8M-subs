so<00:03:16.370> we're<00:03:16.520> not<00:03:16.640> wasting<00:03:17.150> our<00:03:17.450> water<00:03:17.660> and

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
so we're not wasting our water and

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:23.670 
so we're not wasting our water and
that's<00:03:19.190> it<00:03:19.990> simple<00:03:20.990> as<00:03:21.050> that<00:03:21.080> take<00:03:22.010> a<00:03:22.040> look

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
that's it simple as that take a look

that's it simple as that take a look
less<00:03:24.680> than<00:03:24.860> four<00:03:25.040> hundred<00:03:25.130> dollars<00:03:27.190> can't

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.190 
less than four hundred dollars can't

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:31.480 
less than four hundred dollars can't
beat<00:03:28.400> it<00:03:28.430> awesome<00:03:29.300> deal
