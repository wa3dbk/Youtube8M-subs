walking<00:00:44.070> around<00:00:44.219> keep<00:00:44.460> jumping<00:00:44.850> until<00:00:45.149> you

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
walking around keep jumping until you

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.680 
walking around keep jumping until you
make<00:00:45.420> it<00:00:45.450> to<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.899> top<00:00:46.110> of<00:00:46.320> this<00:00:46.440> house<00:00:46.739> and

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:47.690 
make it to the top of this house and

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.860 
make it to the top of this house and
there<00:00:48.690> we<00:00:48.780> go<00:00:49.340> now<00:00:50.340> be<00:00:50.640> very<00:00:50.850> careful<00:00:51.000> because

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
there we go now be very careful because

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.610 
there we go now be very careful because
it<00:00:52.140> is<00:00:52.230> not<00:00:52.469> that<00:00:52.710> hard<00:00:52.920> to<00:00:53.070> fall<00:00:53.340> off<00:00:53.989> if<00:00:54.989> you

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
it is not that hard to fall off if you

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.540 
it is not that hard to fall off if you
fall<00:00:55.980> off<00:00:56.190> too<00:00:56.399> often<00:00:56.730> I<00:00:56.879> suggest<00:00:57.510> like<00:00:57.930> this

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:58.550 
fall off too often I suggest like this

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.310 
fall off too often I suggest like this
making<00:00:59.550> AC<00:00:59.760> while<00:01:00.570> you're<00:01:00.840> on<00:01:00.960> top<00:01:01.140> of<00:01:01.170> the

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
making AC while you're on top of the

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.369 
making AC while you're on top of the
house<00:01:02.120> just<00:01:03.120> in<00:01:03.300> case<00:01:03.510> you<00:01:03.690> screw<00:01:03.750> things<00:01:04.229> up

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
house just in case you screw things up

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.789 
house just in case you screw things up
again<00:01:04.790> there<00:01:05.790> we<00:01:05.970> go<00:01:06.119> after<00:01:07.020> that<00:01:07.290> jump<00:01:07.590> on<00:01:07.770> a

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
again there we go after that jump on a

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.850 
again there we go after that jump on a
double<00:01:08.220> dragon's<00:01:08.610> head<00:01:09.530> might<00:01:10.530> be<00:01:10.650> a<00:01:10.680> bit

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
double dragon's head might be a bit

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.200 
double dragon's head might be a bit
tricky<00:01:11.070> you<00:01:11.850> might<00:01:12.030> fall<00:01:12.299> off<00:01:12.330> a<00:01:12.510> bit<00:01:13.280> /<00:01:14.280> got<00:01:15.030> it

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
tricky you might fall off a bit / got it

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.830 
tricky you might fall off a bit / got it
no<00:01:15.509> I<00:01:15.810> did<00:01:16.380> not<00:01:16.409> get<00:01:16.770> it<00:01:16.979> fuck<00:01:17.340> ok<00:01:18.090> so<00:01:18.390> after<00:01:18.689> a

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
no I did not get it fuck ok so after a

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.420 
no I did not get it fuck ok so after a
bit<00:01:18.960> of<00:01:18.990> jumping<00:01:19.409> around<00:01:19.530> you<00:01:19.860> actually<00:01:20.220> made

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
bit of jumping around you actually made

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.179 
bit of jumping around you actually made
it<00:01:20.549> on<00:01:20.670> top<00:01:21.030> with<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.330> two<00:01:21.479> dragons<00:01:21.890> the<00:01:22.890> next

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
it on top with the two dragons the next

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.280 
it on top with the two dragons the next
jump<00:01:23.430> is<00:01:23.670> maybe<00:01:24.450> even<00:01:24.659> harder<00:01:25.020> than<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:25.259> first

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
jump is maybe even harder than the first

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.980 
jump is maybe even harder than the first
one<00:01:25.770> you<00:01:26.549> want<00:01:26.670> to<00:01:26.759> jump<00:01:27.000> from<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.420> dragons<00:01:27.869> to

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
one you want to jump from the dragons to

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.120 
one you want to jump from the dragons to
that<00:01:28.470> wall<00:01:29.240> like<00:01:30.240> so<00:01:30.570> a<00:01:30.840> and<00:01:31.439> actually<00:01:31.920> get<00:01:32.009> it

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
that wall like so a and actually get it

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.429 
that wall like so a and actually get it
right<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.430> first<00:01:32.460> and<00:01:32.970> now<00:01:33.210> you<00:01:33.930> might<00:01:34.200> want

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
right the first and now you might want

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.410 
right the first and now you might want
to<00:01:34.500> make<00:01:34.650> a<00:01:34.680> second<00:01:35.159> save<00:01:35.430> because<00:01:35.909> this<00:01:36.150> stage

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
to make a second save because this stage

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.020 
to make a second save because this stage
might<00:01:36.720> even<00:01:36.900> be<00:01:37.110> harder<00:01:37.500> while<00:01:38.430> standing<00:01:38.759> on

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
might even be harder while standing on

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.550 
might even be harder while standing on
this<00:01:39.240> wall<00:01:39.479> you<00:01:39.600> want<00:01:39.750> to<00:01:39.840> align<00:01:40.049> yourself

with this broken piece of wall down
there<00:01:42.180> and<00:01:42.810> walk<00:01:43.560> straighforward<00:01:45.590> after<00:01:46.590> a

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
there and walk straighforward after a

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.740 
there and walk straighforward after a
bit<00:01:46.890> you<00:01:47.130> will<00:01:47.280> fall<00:01:47.610> down<00:01:47.640> if<00:01:48.180> you<00:01:48.299> don't<00:01:48.570> you

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750

bit you will fall down if you don't you
might<00:01:48.780> want<00:01:49.049> to<00:01:49.110> jump<00:01:49.380> there<00:01:50.280> might<00:01:50.490> be<00:01:50.520> a

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
might want to jump there might be a

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.190 
might want to jump there might be a
piece<00:01:50.850> of<00:01:50.880> invisible<00:01:51.390> wall<00:01:51.570> and<00:01:52.310> yeah<00:01:53.310> I<00:01:53.340> field

piece of invisible wall and yeah I field

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.330

health isn't high enough to get to make
the<00:02:02.800> fall<00:02:03.070> you<00:02:03.490> might<00:02:03.640> want<00:02:03.850> to<00:02:03.910> drink<00:02:04.180> a

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.930 
the fall you might want to drink a
potion<00:02:04.920> there's<00:02:05.920> a<00:02:06.040> bunch<00:02:06.250> of<00:02:06.310> potions<00:02:06.820> that

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:06.940

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:18.350 

so<00:02:16.379> after<00:02:16.650> you<00:02:16.739> somehow<00:02:17.040> make<00:02:17.519> it<00:02:17.549> down<00:02:18.000> you'll

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
so after you somehow make it down you'll

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.149
