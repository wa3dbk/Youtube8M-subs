00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.290
 hello everyone my name is sonia me 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:14.410
 lot like learning to do these 

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:15.790
 beautiful very easy heart boxes 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:19.020
 to do 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:22.240
 [Music] 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:25.660
 to do it we only need cardboard 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:29.270
 scissors rules double ribbon scissors 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:30.920
 face piercing and tissue paper 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:32.660
 The first thing we are going to do is 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.760
 download the template of the box 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:37.100
 the link of this template what 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.290
 find below the video in the part 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.760
 of the description by clicking on the link 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.380
 the template will appear 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.120
 we can print the template in a 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:46.489
 sheet of paper or for convenience 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:49.489
 we can print it directly on the 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:52.129
 cardboard we simply put a sheet 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:54.040
 of cardboard in our printer 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:56.239
 We give to print and it will be printed 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.860
 perfectly for making bigger box 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:59.570
 is the only thing we are going to do is carry 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:01.250
 our template to a site that does 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.020
 photocopies and make us a 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.270
 extension 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:07.220
 and the next thing we do is cut by 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:10.320
 inside the line so you can not see 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:18.590
 all black stroke 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:20.450
 [Music] 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:23.000
 the slots that are going to serve to close 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:25.759
 the box we are going to cut them as you see in the 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.189
 video what we do is remove all the 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:29.899
 black color mark we passed the edge of 

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:31.670
 the scissors above the marks 

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:34.000
 discontinuous to make the 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.000
 folds 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:40.320
 we fold everything inwards - the 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.020
 tabs that are on the bottom 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.030
 that go out we go around already 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.120
 we can start decorating I have cut 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.830
 four rectangles of white color for 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:52.320
 that make contrast with the cardboard of 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:54.150
 red color and I stick everything with tape 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.040
 adhesive that sticks on both sides if 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:58.080
 we do not have this tape we can 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.780
 use any glue that sticks 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:03.000
 paper we can add more decoration with 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.390
 a punch and so draw figures with 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.390
 cardboards 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.390
 two 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:14.010
 We can give you a personalized touch 

00:02:12.219 --> 00:02:20.160
 with markers 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:24.410
 [Music] 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.410
 we add some nice stickers 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:29.190
 we wrote a special message and also 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.319
 we can take advantage of the cardboard that we 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:34.120
 has left over and cut some figures in 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:36.310
 this case I cut the heart 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.470
 and once we have decorated all the 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.870
 box we can close it for it, let's go 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:43.209
 to lift the lashes below we're going to 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.530
 fold out the tab as they have 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:47.470
 seen in the video we're going to put 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:49.780
 glue in the triangular part and let's 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:50.960
 to close by matching the edges 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.390
 down 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:56.210
 [Music] 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:58.430
 we do the same with the other side and 

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:00.500
 now we're just going to put glue on the 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:03.230
 tab that we have left and we are going to close 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:05.840
 by shaping the box immediately 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:07.760
 is going to build the base as you can see and 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.070
 and the box would be ready now 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.870
 cut a square of tissue paper will 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:14.420
 we put in the whole center a bit of 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:16.760
 we bend it diagonally 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:18.920
 and in this way we can put more 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.900
 easily to the box and paste it into the 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.640
 background now we fill it with what 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.410
 I want in this case I'm 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.840
 filling with candies we can 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:29.000
 put chocolates or the detail that we want 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.860
 and we only have to close the box to 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.200
 it first we put the lashes more 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:35.510
 small and finally let's fit 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:38.269
 the two slots so that a 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:40.310
 heart on top of these 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:43.340
 small boxes are also ideal for gifts 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:45.680
 the without parties as souvenirs in this 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.690
 case I have decorated it with stars what 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:50.060
 I've done is put two stars together 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:52.280
 bright I cut them in half 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:55.459
 to later join these halves and 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:56.810
 get a bicolor star then I've 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:59.510
 decorated with kneecap 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:02.060
 and some small stars I armed 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:04.010
 as before and I have also filled it with 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:05.780
 more candies I hope you have 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:07.610
 enjoyed the tutorial today and that 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:09.530
