00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
wondered if we could make them even more

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.840 
arrived and we're very excited about it
with<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.110> technology<00:01:34.650> available<00:01:34.740> to<00:01:35.340> do<00:01:35.579> all

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
with the technology available to do all

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.480 
with the technology available to do all
of<00:01:35.880> these<00:01:36.570> units<00:01:36.960> on<00:01:37.170> screen<00:01:37.530> one<00:01:38.100> of<00:01:38.220> the<00:01:38.310> key

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
of these units on screen one of the key

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.219 
of these units on screen one of the key
decisions<00:01:38.970> that<00:01:39.240> you<00:01:39.329> made<00:01:39.540> based<00:01:39.810> on<00:01:40.020> the

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
decisions that you made based on the

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.080 
decisions that you made based on the
version<00:01:40.710> that's<00:01:41.189> being<00:01:41.460> shown<00:01:41.790> here<00:01:42.030> at

version that's being shown here at

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.840 
version that's being shown here at
blizzcon<00:01:42.630> is<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:43.680> decision<00:01:44.130> to<00:01:44.280> remove<00:01:44.579> the

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
blizzcon is the decision to remove the

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.300 
blizzcon is the decision to remove the
12<00:01:45.210> unit<00:01:45.570> control<00:01:45.960> cap<00:01:46.200> that<00:01:46.860> must<00:01:47.130> have<00:01:47.220> made

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
12 unit control cap that must have made

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.340 
12 unit control cap that must have made
dramatic<00:01:47.610> changes<00:01:48.270> to<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:48.479> game<00:01:48.630> strategy<00:01:49.200> in

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
dramatic changes to the game strategy in

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.319 
dramatic changes to the game strategy in
the<00:01:49.439> wit<00:01:49.560> of<00:01:49.740> late<00:01:49.950> can<00:01:50.490> you<00:01:50.549> discuss<00:01:50.939> that<00:01:51.149> for

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
the wit of late can you discuss that for

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.060 
the wit of late can you discuss that for
a<00:01:51.360> minute<00:01:51.509> why<00:01:51.869> you<00:01:51.930> made<00:01:52.259> that<00:01:52.470> decision<00:01:52.740> and

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
a minute why you made that decision and

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.580 
a minute why you made that decision and
how<00:01:53.579> it<00:01:53.700> affects<00:01:54.030> starcraft<00:01:54.509> 2<00:01:54.689> so<00:01:55.470> we

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
how it affects starcraft 2 so we

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.530 
how it affects starcraft 2 so we
definitely<00:01:55.770> removed<00:01:56.219> the<00:01:56.430> control<00:01:57.119> limits<00:01:57.240> on

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
definitely removed the control limits on

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:58.520 
definitely removed the control limits on
how<00:01:57.630> many<00:01:57.689> units<00:01:57.899> you<00:01:58.020> can<00:01:58.170> control<00:01:58.409> in

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
how many units you can control in

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:59.749 
how many units you can control in
starcraft<00:01:58.920> 2<00:01:59.070> and<00:01:59.250> our<00:01:59.310> thinking<00:01:59.610> on<00:01:59.729> that

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
starcraft 2 and our thinking on that

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.160 
starcraft 2 and our thinking on that
once<00:02:00.000> we<00:02:00.090> wanted<00:02:00.329> the<00:02:00.420> game<00:02:00.509> to<00:02:00.570> be<00:02:00.689> as<00:02:00.840> easy<00:02:01.079> to

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
once we wanted the game to be as easy to

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.350 
once we wanted the game to be as easy to
play<00:02:01.409> as<00:02:01.560> we<00:02:01.649> could<00:02:01.799> possibly<00:02:02.189> make<00:02:02.369> it<00:02:02.610> now<00:02:03.180> of

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
play as we could possibly make it now of

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.760 
play as we could possibly make it now of
course<00:02:03.540> we<00:02:03.659> still<00:02:03.990> want<00:02:04.170> players<00:02:04.380> to<00:02:04.530> bill<00:02:04.680> to

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
course we still want players to bill to

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.109 
course we still want players to bill to
show<00:02:04.920> off<00:02:05.040> their<00:02:05.219> skill<00:02:05.520> level<00:02:05.549> and<00:02:05.850> we<00:02:05.909> still

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
show off their skill level and we still

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.190 
show off their skill level and we still
want<00:02:06.270> the<00:02:06.299> game<00:02:06.479> to<00:02:06.509> be<00:02:06.630> a<00:02:06.689> very<00:02:06.899> challenging

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
want the game to be a very challenging

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.809 
want the game to be a very challenging
game<00:02:07.649> and<00:02:07.860> you<00:02:07.920> can<00:02:08.069> continue<00:02:08.340> to<00:02:08.550> get<00:02:08.640> better

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
game and you can continue to get better

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.400 
game and you can continue to get better
at<00:02:09.060> year<00:02:09.840> after<00:02:09.989> year<00:02:10.259> after<00:02:10.739> year<00:02:10.920> which

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
at year after year after year which

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:12.930 
at year after year after year which
would<00:02:11.560> be<00:02:11.710> the<00:02:11.830> original<00:02:11.950> starcraft<00:02:12.400> one<00:02:12.850> of

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
would be the original starcraft one of

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:13.440 
would be the original starcraft one of
the<00:02:13.000> things<00:02:13.090> that<00:02:13.270> made<00:02:13.360> the<00:02:13.420> original

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
the things that made the original

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.510 
the things that made the original
starcraft<00:02:13.810> so<00:02:14.200> great<00:02:14.530> so<00:02:15.160> we've<00:02:15.310> definitely

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
starcraft so great so we've definitely

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.250 
starcraft so great so we've definitely
removed<00:02:16.030> that<00:02:16.270> cap<00:02:16.540> we<00:02:16.720> made<00:02:16.870> the<00:02:16.960> interface

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
removed that cap we made the interface

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:18.720 
removed that cap we made the interface
to<00:02:17.410> use<00:02:17.560> in<00:02:17.710> that<00:02:17.890> way<00:02:18.040> in<00:02:18.190> a<00:02:18.280> number<00:02:18.520> of<00:02:18.610> other

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
to use in that way in a number of other

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:20.250 
to use in that way in a number of other
ways<00:02:18.910> as<00:02:18.940> well<00:02:19.120> you<00:02:19.480> can<00:02:19.510> rally<00:02:19.780> point<00:02:20.110> your

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
ways as well you can rally point your

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.650 
ways as well you can rally point your
peons<00:02:20.590> directly<00:02:21.130> to<00:02:21.760> the<00:02:21.880> resources<00:02:22.420> there's

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
peons directly to the resources there's

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:24.990 
peons directly to the resources there's
lots<00:02:22.870> of<00:02:23.020> innovations<00:02:23.530> in<00:02:23.710> in<00:02:24.520> the<00:02:24.670> interface

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
lots of innovations in in the interface

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.130 
lots of innovations in in the interface
that<00:02:25.300> make<00:02:25.450> the<00:02:25.540> other<00:02:25.630> phrase<00:02:25.810> each<00:02:25.990> of
