00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
I guess this is the latest alpha I go

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:12.049 
I guess this is the latest alpha I go
through<00:00:07.980> the<00:00:08.189> s<00:00:08.540> for<00:00:09.540> the<00:00:10.070> radius<00:00:11.070> our<00:00:11.580> aims

okay<00:00:43.620> I<00:00:45.890> gotcha<00:00:47.300> cards<00:00:50.660> there's<00:00:51.660> my<00:00:51.899> two

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
okay I gotcha cards there's my two

00:00:52.230 --> 00:01:01.279 
okay I gotcha cards there's my two
thirds<00:00:55.039> this<00:00:56.039> one<00:00:57.170> the<00:00:58.170> wet<00:00:58.410> car<00:00:58.829> is<00:00:59.960> for<00:01:00.960> the

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
thirds this one the wet car is for the

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:07.160 
thirds this one the wet car is for the
sweet<00:01:01.620> Deacons<00:01:03.170> it<00:01:04.170> is<00:01:04.350> a<00:01:04.379> starter<00:01:05.280> for<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.170> 3d

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
sweet Deacons it is a starter for the 3d

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.950 
sweet Deacons it is a starter for the 3d
games<00:01:08.299> like<00:01:09.299> they<00:01:09.689> get<00:01:10.619> miss<00:01:11.010> radius<00:01:11.670> tears<00:01:12.450> in

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
games like they get miss radius tears in

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.660 
games like they get miss radius tears in
the<00:01:13.920> fast<00:01:14.220> and<00:01:14.869> so<00:01:15.869> there<00:01:16.350> is<00:01:16.590> this<00:01:16.830> radius

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
the fast and so there is this radius

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.330 
the fast and so there is this radius
curve<00:01:18.509> marking<00:01:19.470> printed<00:01:20.340> on<00:01:20.610> this<00:01:21.509> chips

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
curve marking printed on this chips

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:30.130 
curve marking printed on this chips
so<00:01:23.340> now<00:01:23.610> and<00:01:24.060> this<00:01:24.720> is<00:01:25.020> for<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.189> 3d<00:01:26.850> games<00:01:28.159> and

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:30.140 
so now and this is for the 3d games and

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.800 
so now and this is for the 3d games and
the<00:01:31.140> energy<00:01:31.530> they<00:01:32.040> are<00:01:32.070> occur<00:01:32.610> in<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.540> black

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
the energy they are occur in the black

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:39.109 
the energy they are occur in the black
car<00:01:34.170> for<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.250> DS<00:01:36.210> games<00:01:36.840> and<00:01:37.700> human<00:01:38.700> artists

so you were maybe you will be familiar

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.660 
so you were maybe you will be familiar
with<00:03:37.560> Aesop

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
with Aesop

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:44.140 
with Aesop
so<00:03:38.940> let's<00:03:39.930> try<00:03:40.410> to<00:03:40.440> open<00:03:40.950> the<00:03:41.220> out<00:03:41.780> the<00:03:42.780> Alpha

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
so let's try to open the out the Alpha

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:48.680 
so let's try to open the out the Alpha
radius<00:03:45.230> RTS<00:03:46.230> car<00:03:46.530> when<00:03:47.040> the<00:03:47.160> Alpha<00:03:47.550> RDS<00:03:48.120> tisane

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
radius RTS car when the Alpha RDS tisane

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:56.410 
radius RTS car when the Alpha RDS tisane
right<00:03:49.080> as<00:03:49.350> a<00:03:50.060> comparison<00:03:53.930> and<00:03:54.930> it's<00:03:55.140> for<00:03:55.530> the

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:56.420 
right as a comparison and it's for the

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:01.490 
right as a comparison and it's for the
men<00:03:57.420> from<00:03:57.930> the<00:03:58.080> symbol<00:03:58.739> was<00:03:58.890> a<00:03:58.950> yahoo<00:03:59.640> ideas<00:04:00.500> of

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
men from the symbol was a yahoo ideas of

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:25.560 
men from the symbol was a yahoo ideas of
ideas<00:04:02.160> that's<00:04:02.549> in<00:04:02.850> red<00:04:03.620> okay<00:04:06.799> okay<00:04:07.799> yes

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:25.570 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:32.370 

okay<00:04:26.380> got<00:04:26.740> it<00:04:27.750> so<00:04:28.750> this<00:04:29.410> is<00:04:30.210> out<00:04:31.210> Warren<00:04:31.960> and

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:32.380 
okay got it so this is out Warren and

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:37.640 
okay got it so this is out Warren and
this<00:04:32.950> is<00:04:33.220> the<00:04:33.990> black<00:04:34.990> car<00:04:35.320> for<00:04:36.040> the<00:04:36.190> new<00:04:36.550> versus

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:37.650 
this is the black car for the new versus

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:42.560 
this is the black car for the new versus
there's<00:04:38.650> no<00:04:39.190> differences<00:04:40.120> on<00:04:40.870> their<00:04:41.400> hardware

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:42.570 
there's no differences on their hardware

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:48.500 
there's no differences on their hardware
so<00:04:43.570> if<00:04:43.960> you<00:04:44.620> want<00:04:44.980> to<00:04:45.100> if<00:04:45.820> you<00:04:46.270> want<00:04:46.570> to<00:04:46.720> bear<00:04:47.020> a

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:48.510 
so if you want to if you want to bear a

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:54.450 
so if you want to if you want to bear a
3d<00:04:49.510> of<00:04:50.110> white<00:04:50.980> goes<00:04:51.250> through<00:04:51.520> this<00:04:53.160> you<00:04:54.160> need

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:54.460 
3d of white goes through this you need

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:59.280 
3d of white goes through this you need
on<00:04:55.770> by<00:04:57.270> the<00:04:58.270> white<00:04:58.600> car
