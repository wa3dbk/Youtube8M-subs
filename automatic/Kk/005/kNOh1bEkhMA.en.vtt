00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.910 

this<00:02:03.760> is<00:02:03.940> just<00:02:04.120> from<00:02:04.300> a<00:02:04.450> um<00:02:04.720> the<00:02:05.470> middle<00:02:05.710> of<00:02:05.830> a

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920 
this is just from a um the middle of a

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.219 
this is just from a um the middle of a
peg<00:02:06.190> but<00:02:06.940> if<00:02:07.030> you<00:02:07.120> had<00:02:07.210> a<00:02:07.270> ball<00:02:07.540> bearing<00:02:07.870> you

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
peg but if you had a ball bearing you

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.740 
peg but if you had a ball bearing you
could<00:02:08.380> use<00:02:08.530> a<00:02:08.560> ball<00:02:08.830> bearing<00:02:09.180> let's<00:02:10.180> put<00:02:10.390> it<00:02:10.510> in

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:20.820 

close<00:02:13.750> it<00:02:13.900> up<00:02:14.110> for<00:02:14.350> next<00:02:14.650> time

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.360 

that's<00:02:21.370> what<00:02:21.550> it<00:02:21.640> looks<00:02:21.820> like<00:02:22.030> when<00:02:22.270> it's<00:02:22.420> dry

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
that's what it looks like when it's dry

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.920 
that's what it looks like when it's dry
so<00:02:24.370> now<00:02:24.640> you<00:02:24.700> just<00:02:25.030> need<00:02:25.120> to<00:02:25.270> put<00:02:25.570> your<00:02:25.720> top

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190
