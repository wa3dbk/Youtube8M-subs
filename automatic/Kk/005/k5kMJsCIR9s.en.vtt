 start with this color one of my 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:54.070
 favorites when I want some color 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:56.530
 I use this purple and I will use it with my finger and 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:59.010
 I will load it right in the center of my 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.010
 eyelid 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:04.409
 the next color is this neutral and what 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:08.790
 I will use it as a transition color 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:12.270
 it will go right in my fold and 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:14.550
 will blur the hard lines and now 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.800
 I want to add more definition in my 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:19.470

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:23.160
 which is like a reddish brown and starting 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:25.310

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.460

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.869
