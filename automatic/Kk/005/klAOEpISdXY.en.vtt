00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:30.170 
seeds do you save here in the north and

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:31.690 
seeds do you save here in the north and
why<00:00:30.370> well

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:31.700 
why well

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.450 
why well
I<00:00:31.730> save<00:00:32.300> seeds<00:00:32.689> that<00:00:33.110> are<00:00:33.380> viable<00:00:33.710> first<00:00:34.280> of

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:34.460 
I save seeds that are viable first of

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.310 
I save seeds that are viable first of
all<00:00:34.579> meaning<00:00:34.760> that<00:00:35.090> they're<00:00:35.480> going<00:00:35.780> to<00:00:35.900> grow

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:36.320 
all meaning that they're going to grow

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.380 
all meaning that they're going to grow
the<00:00:36.710> first<00:00:36.950> one<00:00:37.190> I<00:00:37.220> really<00:00:37.670> noticed<00:00:38.000> like<00:00:38.120> that

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:38.390 
the first one I really noticed like that

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.680 
the first one I really noticed like that
was<00:00:38.750> spinach<00:00:39.410> spinach<00:00:40.100> is<00:00:40.489> really<00:00:40.820> Hardy<00:00:41.239> it

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:41.690 
was spinach spinach is really Hardy it

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.770 
was spinach spinach is really Hardy it
it<00:00:42.140> comes<00:00:42.620> to<00:00:43.100> bloom<00:00:43.489> early<00:00:44.180> in<00:00:44.420> the<00:00:44.540> season

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:44.780 
it comes to bloom early in the season

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.440 
it comes to bloom early in the season
and<00:00:45.230> then<00:00:45.710> it<00:00:45.829> has<00:00:46.010> plenty<00:00:46.280> of<00:00:46.430> time<00:00:46.820> to<00:00:47.090> mature

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:47.450 
and then it has plenty of time to mature

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.410 
and then it has plenty of time to mature
and<00:00:47.630> set<00:00:47.870> the<00:00:48.020> seed<00:00:48.260> so<00:00:49.220> Arlene<00:00:49.730> here's<00:00:50.120> an

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:50.420 
and set the seed so Arlene here's an

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.670 
and set the seed so Arlene here's an
example<00:00:50.810> of<00:00:51.230> some<00:00:51.730> mature<00:00:52.730> more<00:00:53.480> mature

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:53.680 
example of some mature more mature

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.920 
example of some mature more mature
spinach<00:00:54.680> seed<00:00:55.040> that<00:00:55.910> I'm<00:00:56.239> just<00:00:56.510> gonna<00:00:56.660> let

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:56.930 
spinach seed that I'm just gonna let

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.389 
spinach seed that I'm just gonna let
this<00:00:57.170> go<00:00:57.500> and<00:00:57.890> it's<00:00:58.070> gonna<00:00:58.219> fall<00:00:58.670> down<00:00:58.700> and

00:01:00.389 --> 00:01:00.399 
this go and it's gonna fall down and

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:02.950 
this go and it's gonna fall down and
propagate<00:01:01.399> in<00:01:01.610> the<00:01:01.760> garden<00:01:02.180> right<00:01:02.420> and<00:01:02.840> I'll

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:02.960 
propagate in the garden right and I'll

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.229 
propagate in the garden right and I'll
have<00:01:03.230> volunteer<00:01:03.950> spinach<00:01:04.400> next<00:01:04.790> year<00:01:05.030> and

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:05.239 
have volunteer spinach next year and

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:09.640 
have volunteer spinach next year and
here's<00:01:06.020> an<00:01:06.260> example<00:01:06.650> of<00:01:07.720> spinach<00:01:08.720> that<00:01:09.110> is<00:01:09.290> not

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:09.650 
here's an example of spinach that is not

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.039 
here's an example of spinach that is not
mature<00:01:10.190> yet<00:01:10.250> you<00:01:11.150> see<00:01:11.330> the<00:01:11.450> difference

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:12.049 
mature yet you see the difference

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:15.130 
mature yet you see the difference
yep<00:01:12.440> the<00:01:13.220> plant<00:01:13.520> itself<00:01:13.970> is<00:01:14.210> so<00:01:14.479> dead<00:01:14.810> looking

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
yep the plant itself is so dead looking

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:16.930 
yep the plant itself is so dead looking
and<00:01:15.350> so<00:01:15.470> on<00:01:15.560> but<00:01:15.680> the<00:01:15.830> seed<00:01:16.070> is<00:01:16.250> brown<00:01:16.580> and

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:16.940 
and so on but the seed is brown and

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:18.880 
and so on but the seed is brown and
getting<00:01:17.299> that<00:01:17.390> familiar<00:01:17.960> look<00:01:18.380> it's<00:01:18.740> a

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
getting that familiar look it's a

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.550 
getting that familiar look it's a
self-perpetuating<00:01:19.310> plant<00:01:20.210> and<00:01:20.570> that's<00:01:21.290> one

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 
self-perpetuating plant and that's one

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.070 
self-perpetuating plant and that's one
of<00:01:21.590> the<00:01:21.740> beauties<00:01:22.190> of<00:01:22.330> annuals<00:01:23.330> even<00:01:23.840> though

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:24.080 
of the beauties of annuals even though

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.740 
of the beauties of annuals even though
an<00:01:24.290> annual<00:01:24.740> will<00:01:24.950> die<00:01:25.190> back<00:01:25.520> and<00:01:25.970> it<00:01:26.210> only<00:01:26.390> has

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750 
an annual will die back and it only has

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.250 
an annual will die back and it only has
like<00:01:26.780> a<00:01:27.040> one<00:01:28.040> season<00:01:28.369> life<00:01:28.729> cycle<00:01:29.210> it<00:01:29.840> can

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:30.260 
like a one season life cycle it can

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.560 
like a one season life cycle it can
reseed<00:01:30.830> itself<00:01:30.860> and<00:01:31.640> that's<00:01:32.180> how<00:01:32.420> it

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570 
reseed itself and that's how it

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:34.719 
reseed itself and that's how it
propagates<00:01:32.810> dill<00:01:33.650> is<00:01:33.860> one<00:01:34.070> of<00:01:34.189> the<00:01:34.310> success

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:34.729 
propagates dill is one of the success

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:38.740 
propagates dill is one of the success
stories<00:01:35.560> for<00:01:36.700> yearly<00:01:37.700> propagation<00:01:38.600> in<00:01:38.720> the

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
stories for yearly propagation in the

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.550 
stories for yearly propagation in the
garden<00:01:39.229> just<00:01:39.260> naturally<00:01:40.070> because<00:01:40.970> it<00:01:41.560> usually

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
garden just naturally because it usually

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.070 
garden just naturally because it usually
I<00:01:42.590> always<00:01:42.650> get<00:01:43.189> some<00:01:43.490> that<00:01:44.119> comes<00:01:44.479> to<00:01:44.689> maturity

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:45.080 
I always get some that comes to maturity

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.980 
I always get some that comes to maturity
and<00:01:45.490> then<00:01:46.490> it's<00:01:46.729> just<00:01:46.909> the<00:01:47.119> seed<00:01:47.360> falls<00:01:47.689> and

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
and then it's just the seed falls and

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.260 
and then it's just the seed falls and
then<00:01:48.110> it<00:01:48.259> just<00:01:48.439> it<00:01:48.650> recedes<00:01:49.189> itself<00:01:49.670> which<00:01:50.090> is

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 
then it just it recedes itself which is

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.600 
then it just it recedes itself which is
great<00:01:50.600> and<00:01:50.869> so<00:01:51.860> I'm<00:01:51.979> always<00:01:52.250> getting

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 
great and so I'm always getting

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:54.609 
great and so I'm always getting
volunteers<00:01:53.360> in<00:01:53.630> the<00:01:53.750> garden<00:01:54.110> which<00:01:54.229> is<00:01:54.259> really

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:54.619

here<00:02:04.610> these<00:02:04.909> are<00:02:05.210> the<00:02:06.009> seed<00:02:07.009> heads<00:02:07.280> that<00:02:07.490> are

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
here these are the seed heads that are

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.170 
here these are the seed heads that are
producing<00:02:08.239> a<00:02:08.509> viable<00:02:09.410> more<00:02:10.190> mature<00:02:10.610> seed<00:02:10.940> and

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
producing a viable more mature seed and

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:12.870 
producing a viable more mature seed and
they're<00:02:11.270> almost<00:02:11.480> ready

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
they're almost ready

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.000 
they're almost ready
you<00:02:13.000> you<00:02:13.510> know<00:02:13.630> break<00:02:14.170> open<00:02:14.410> and<00:02:14.710> you<00:02:14.800> can<00:02:14.950> see

you you know break open and you can see

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.880 
you you know break open and you can see
through<00:02:15.580> through<00:02:16.300> the<00:02:16.420> sunlight<00:02:16.930> you<00:02:17.320> can<00:02:17.530> see

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
through through the sunlight you can see

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:19.890 
through through the sunlight you can see
that<00:02:18.070> there's<00:02:18.280> a<00:02:18.340> thickness<00:02:19.030> there<00:02:19.540> there's<00:02:19.840> a

that there's a thickness there there's a

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.380 
that there's a thickness there there's a
substance<00:02:20.380> there<00:02:20.800> then<00:02:21.460> that's<00:02:21.640> them<00:02:22.030> that's

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
substance there then that's them that's

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.180 
substance there then that's them that's
the<00:02:22.630> more<00:02:22.780> mature<00:02:22.930> see<00:02:23.380> do<00:02:23.740> you<00:02:23.770> ever<00:02:23.950> collect

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
the more mature see do you ever collect

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:27.390 
the more mature see do you ever collect
the<00:02:24.520> seed<00:02:24.760> I<00:02:25.060> do<00:02:25.540> yeah<00:02:26.170> I<00:02:26.380> do<00:02:26.530> collect<00:02:27.040> the<00:02:27.160> seed

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
the seed I do yeah I do collect the seed

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.430 
the seed I do yeah I do collect the seed
now<00:02:27.820> what<00:02:28.150> I<00:02:28.180> would<00:02:28.330> do<00:02:28.600> to<00:02:28.750> collect<00:02:28.900> this<00:02:29.200> seed

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
now what I would do to collect this seed

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.790 
now what I would do to collect this seed
I<00:02:29.620> would<00:02:29.800> wait<00:02:30.010> tell<00:02:30.730> a<00:02:30.760> dry<00:02:31.090> day<00:02:31.150> and<00:02:31.750> then<00:02:32.650> I'd

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 
I would wait tell a dry day and then I'd

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.590 
I would wait tell a dry day and then I'd
collect<00:02:33.130> on<00:02:33.310> a<00:02:33.340> dry<00:02:33.580> day<00:02:33.640> do<00:02:34.090> you<00:02:34.180> cut<00:02:34.570> the

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600 
collect on a dry day do you cut the

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.810 
collect on a dry day do you cut the
stalk<00:02:35.170> and<00:02:35.440> then<00:02:35.530> put<00:02:35.740> the<00:02:35.830> stalk<00:02:36.130> somewhere<00:02:36.610> I

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:36.820 
stalk and then put the stalk somewhere I

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:39.480 
stalk and then put the stalk somewhere I
would<00:02:36.970> cut<00:02:37.210> it<00:02:37.240> about<00:02:37.510> right<00:02:37.900> here<00:02:38.470> and<00:02:38.680> then<00:02:39.460> I

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:39.490 
would cut it about right here and then I

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:41.730 
would cut it about right here and then I
would<00:02:39.640> just<00:02:39.760> take<00:02:40.090> it<00:02:40.120> in<00:02:40.330> the<00:02:40.420> house<00:02:40.600> and<00:02:41.080> you

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:41.740 
would just take it in the house and you

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:44.130 
would just take it in the house and you
know<00:02:41.860> put<00:02:42.130> it<00:02:42.250> on<00:02:42.370> a<00:02:42.400> table<00:02:42.700> and<00:02:43.330> then<00:02:43.540> just<00:02:43.990> let

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
know put it on a table and then just let

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.590 
know put it on a table and then just let
the<00:02:44.170> seeds<00:02:44.530> fall<00:02:44.830> out<00:02:45.070> and<00:02:45.280> then<00:02:45.880> put<00:02:46.330> them<00:02:46.480> in

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
the seeds fall out and then put them in

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.480 
the seeds fall out and then put them in
a<00:02:46.690> jar<00:02:46.720> you<00:02:47.500> know<00:02:47.620> they're<00:02:47.770> all<00:02:47.890> nice<00:02:48.070> and<00:02:48.100> dry

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:48.490 
a jar you know they're all nice and dry

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:51.680 
a jar you know they're all nice and dry
put<00:02:48.850> them<00:02:49.000> in<00:02:49.120> a<00:02:49.150> jar<00:02:49.210> mark<00:02:49.810> on<00:02:50.050> it<00:02:50.290> dill<00:02:51.010> seed

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
put them in a jar mark on it dill seed

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.260 
put them in a jar mark on it dill seed
2013<00:02:52.690> what<00:02:53.320> I<00:02:53.350> do<00:02:53.550> mostly<00:02:54.550> with<00:02:54.640> my<00:02:55.000> deal<00:02:55.240> is

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:55.270 
2013 what I do mostly with my deal is

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:58.740 
2013 what I do mostly with my deal is
I'll<00:02:55.630> take<00:02:55.900> off<00:02:56.140> the<00:02:56.470> this<00:02:57.370> the<00:02:57.790> the<00:02:58.120> fronds

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
I'll take off the this the the fronds

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.080 
I'll take off the this the the fronds
and<00:02:58.930> then<00:02:59.470> chop<00:02:59.740> them<00:02:59.980> up<00:03:00.100> really<00:03:00.460> fine<00:03:00.760> and

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
and then chop them up really fine and

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:03.480 
and then chop them up really fine and
then<00:03:01.330> freeze<00:03:01.720> them<00:03:01.750> in<00:03:02.140> little<00:03:02.590> in<00:03:02.830> little

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:03.490 
then freeze them in little in little

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:06.510 
then freeze them in little in little
freezer<00:03:04.030> bags<00:03:04.360> and<00:03:04.810> then<00:03:05.380> just<00:03:05.620> use<00:03:05.860> them<00:03:06.160> in

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:06.520 
freezer bags and then just use them in

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:08.850 
freezer bags and then just use them in
like<00:03:07.180> mashed<00:03:07.420> potatoes<00:03:08.020> or<00:03:08.230> soups<00:03:08.500> or<00:03:08.740> stews

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
like mashed potatoes or soups or stews

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.240 
like mashed potatoes or soups or stews
the<00:03:09.820> Frog<00:03:10.150> Park<00:03:10.540> we're<00:03:11.080> standing<00:03:11.530> in<00:03:11.710> front<00:03:11.920> of

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
the Frog Park we're standing in front of

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.800 
the Frog Park we're standing in front of
an<00:03:12.580> annual<00:03:13.060> this<00:03:13.900> is<00:03:14.080> a<00:03:14.110> lettuce<00:03:15.040> and<00:03:15.810> I've

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
an annual this is a lettuce and I've

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.470 
an annual this is a lettuce and I've
never<00:03:17.140> actually<00:03:17.770> saved<00:03:18.370> seeds<00:03:18.850> of<00:03:19.120> lettuce

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
never actually saved seeds of lettuce

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.920 
never actually saved seeds of lettuce
yet<00:03:19.780> but<00:03:20.590> I'm<00:03:20.710> gonna<00:03:20.950> let<00:03:21.220> this<00:03:21.460> go<00:03:21.820> as<00:03:22.270> long<00:03:22.750> as

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
yet but I'm gonna let this go as long as

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:24.720 
yet but I'm gonna let this go as long as
it<00:03:23.050> possibly<00:03:23.260> can<00:03:23.830> out<00:03:24.100> here<00:03:24.340> in<00:03:24.460> the<00:03:24.580> garden

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
it possibly can out here in the garden

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.840 
it possibly can out here in the garden
and<00:03:25.180> then<00:03:25.840> if<00:03:26.140> it<00:03:26.530> drops<00:03:26.890> seed<00:03:27.250> and<00:03:27.580> if<00:03:27.670> it

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:27.850 
and then if it drops seed and if it

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:29.910 
and then if it drops seed and if it
grows<00:03:28.300> next<00:03:29.050> year<00:03:29.290> in<00:03:29.410> my<00:03:29.530> garden

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
grows next year in my garden

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.130 
grows next year in my garden
spontaneously<00:03:30.760> I'll<00:03:31.090> know<00:03:31.600> that<00:03:31.630> that'll<00:03:32.110> be

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:32.140 
spontaneously I'll know that that'll be

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:34.410 
spontaneously I'll know that that'll be
viable<00:03:32.530> for<00:03:32.770> next<00:03:33.250> year<00:03:33.490> how<00:03:34.000> do<00:03:34.060> you<00:03:34.180> click

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.420 
viable for next year how do you click

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:37.500 
viable for next year how do you click
seats<00:03:34.780> from<00:03:35.290> lettuce<00:03:35.620> well<00:03:36.460> you<00:03:36.940> have<00:03:37.150> to<00:03:37.330> wait

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
seats from lettuce well you have to wait

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:39.840 
seats from lettuce well you have to wait
until<00:03:37.750> the<00:03:38.500> lettuce<00:03:39.040> seed<00:03:39.220> is<00:03:39.370> fully<00:03:39.640> mature

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:39.850 
until the lettuce seed is fully mature

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:44.100 
until the lettuce seed is fully mature
and<00:03:40.620> otherwise<00:03:41.620> it<00:03:41.830> won't<00:03:41.980> be<00:03:42.130> viable<00:03:42.640> so<00:03:43.110> it's

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:44.110 
and otherwise it won't be viable so it's

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:47.490 
and otherwise it won't be viable so it's
just<00:03:44.290> in<00:03:44.500> the<00:03:44.620> flowering<00:03:45.160> stage<00:03:45.520> now<00:03:45.880> but<00:03:46.780> what

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
just in the flowering stage now but what

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.980 
just in the flowering stage now but what
you're<00:03:47.650> gonna<00:03:47.830> want<00:03:48.160> to<00:03:48.310> do<00:03:48.520> is<00:03:48.730> that<00:03:48.940> once<00:03:49.270> you

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:49.990 
you're gonna want to do is that once you

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:52.440 
you're gonna want to do is that once you
know<00:03:50.080> the<00:03:50.230> seed<00:03:50.470> pods<00:03:50.800> develop<00:03:51.490> and<00:03:51.670> they're

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:52.450 
know the seed pods develop and they're

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:54.690 
know the seed pods develop and they're
just<00:03:52.690> starting<00:03:52.959> to<00:03:53.290> you<00:03:53.830> know<00:03:53.950> break<00:03:54.220> open<00:03:54.459> a

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:54.700 
just starting to you know break open a

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:56.100 
just starting to you know break open a
little<00:03:54.850> bit<00:03:55.060> and<00:03:55.180> you'll<00:03:55.270> be<00:03:55.420> able<00:03:55.510> to<00:03:55.690> see<00:03:55.900> the

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:56.110 
little bit and you'll be able to see the

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:58.949 
little bit and you'll be able to see the
seed<00:03:56.800> within<00:03:57.190> then<00:03:57.910> that's<00:03:58.450> the<00:03:58.660> time<00:03:58.930> that

00:03:58.949 --> 00:03:58.959 
seed within then that's the time that

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:01.170 
seed within then that's the time that
you'll<00:03:59.470> want<00:03:59.890> to<00:03:59.950> collect<00:04:00.190> the<00:04:00.310> seed<00:04:00.550> you<00:04:00.940> have

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:01.180 
you'll want to collect the seed you have

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:03.810 
you'll want to collect the seed you have
to<00:04:01.360> beat<00:04:01.810> mother<00:04:02.500> nature<00:04:02.650> at<00:04:03.160> getting<00:04:03.640> their

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:03.820 
to beat mother nature at getting their

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:09.000 
to beat mother nature at getting their
seeds<00:04:04.090> out<00:04:05.220> so<00:04:06.220> this<00:04:06.760> is<00:04:06.820> the<00:04:07.290> basil<00:04:08.290> and<00:04:08.530> now

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.010 
seeds out so this is the basil and now

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:11.820 
seeds out so this is the basil and now
this<00:04:09.400> is<00:04:09.580> an<00:04:09.700> annual<00:04:10.030> herb<00:04:10.750> of<00:04:11.110> course<00:04:11.470> as<00:04:11.680> you

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:11.830 
this is an annual herb of course as you

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:14.890 
this is an annual herb of course as you
know<00:04:12.030> we<00:04:13.030> but<00:04:13.330> easier

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:14.900 
know we but easier

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:16.509 
know we but easier
three<00:04:15.170> different<00:04:15.409> stages<00:04:16.070> like<00:04:16.250> there's

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:16.519 
three different stages like there's

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:19.539 
three different stages like there's
black<00:04:17.000> seed<00:04:17.419> which<00:04:18.169> is<00:04:18.380> the<00:04:18.530> mature<00:04:18.979> seed<00:04:19.310> and

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:19.549 
black seed which is the mature seed and

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:21.939 
black seed which is the mature seed and
then<00:04:19.639> we've<00:04:19.790> got<00:04:20.060> brown<00:04:20.479> seed<00:04:21.199> not<00:04:21.560> so<00:04:21.769> mature

00:04:21.939 --> 00:04:21.949 
then we've got brown seed not so mature

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:24.189 
then we've got brown seed not so mature
and<00:04:22.250> then<00:04:22.370> we<00:04:22.520> actually<00:04:22.729> got<00:04:23.060> the<00:04:23.270> pale<00:04:23.479> seed

00:04:24.189 --> 00:04:24.199 
and then we actually got the pale seed

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:27.310 
and then we actually got the pale seed
which<00:04:24.560> needs<00:04:25.100> a<00:04:25.370> lot<00:04:25.820> more<00:04:26.000> time<00:04:26.300> but<00:04:27.169> the

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320 
which needs a lot more time but the

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.590 
which needs a lot more time but the
trouble<00:04:27.740> you<00:04:28.310> know<00:04:28.430> with<00:04:28.669> a<00:04:28.699> plant<00:04:29.060> like<00:04:29.270> this

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:29.600 
trouble you know with a plant like this

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.749 
trouble you know with a plant like this
is<00:04:30.169> that<00:04:30.500> you've<00:04:31.039> got<00:04:31.310> all<00:04:31.550> these<00:04:31.699> different

00:04:31.749 --> 00:04:31.759 
is that you've got all these different

00:04:31.759 --> 00:04:34.480 
is that you've got all these different
stages<00:04:32.389> happening<00:04:33.199> at<00:04:33.350> the<00:04:33.440> same<00:04:33.620> time<00:04:33.680> you

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:34.490 
stages happening at the same time you

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:36.610 
stages happening at the same time you
have<00:04:34.729> to<00:04:34.759> have<00:04:35.060> a<00:04:35.090> collection<00:04:35.509> system<00:04:35.900> so<00:04:36.440> that

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:36.620 
have to have a collection system so that

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:38.920 
have to have a collection system so that
they<00:04:36.979> be<00:04:37.039> able<00:04:37.220> to<00:04:37.340> see<00:04:37.639> the<00:04:37.850> seed<00:04:38.090> is<00:04:38.270> if<00:04:38.780> it

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:38.930 
they be able to see the seed is if it

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:42.850 
they be able to see the seed is if it
falls<00:04:39.669> so<00:04:40.669> Barbara<00:04:41.030> tell<00:04:41.479> me<00:04:41.660> about<00:04:41.930> saving

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:42.860 
falls so Barbara tell me about saving

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:46.240 
falls so Barbara tell me about saving
tomato<00:04:43.310> seeds<00:04:43.729> this<00:04:44.449> red<00:04:44.810> one<00:04:45.080> one<00:04:45.740> year<00:04:46.039> about

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:46.250 
tomato seeds this red one one year about

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:48.700 
tomato seeds this red one one year about
five<00:04:46.460> years<00:04:46.669> ago<00:04:46.820> produced<00:04:47.449> one<00:04:47.780> yellow

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:48.710 
five years ago produced one yellow

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:52.210 
five years ago produced one yellow
tomato<00:04:49.220> and<00:04:49.550> I<00:04:50.300> noticed<00:04:50.870> that<00:04:51.080> the<00:04:51.289> that<00:04:52.039> the

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:52.220 
tomato and I noticed that the that the

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:54.310 
tomato and I noticed that the that the
tomato<00:04:52.580> size<00:04:52.970> was<00:04:53.389> generally<00:04:53.810> bigger<00:04:54.020> than

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:54.320 
tomato size was generally bigger than

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:55.990 
tomato size was generally bigger than
the<00:04:54.440> red<00:04:54.620> and<00:04:55.280> I<00:04:55.340> thought<00:04:55.520> well<00:04:55.729> this<00:04:55.850> will<00:04:55.970> be

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:56.000 
the red and I thought well this will be

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.600 
the red and I thought well this will be
an<00:04:56.150> interesting<00:04:56.389> one<00:04:56.660> to<00:04:56.840> propagate<00:04:57.560> so<00:04:57.830> I'm

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:58.610 
an interesting one to propagate so I'm

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:01.240 
an interesting one to propagate so I'm
just<00:04:58.820> gonna<00:04:59.000> cut<00:04:59.930> into<00:05:00.380> the<00:05:00.500> tomato<00:05:00.770> this<00:05:01.070> is

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:01.250 
just gonna cut into the tomato this is

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:03.909 
just gonna cut into the tomato this is
how<00:05:01.460> I<00:05:01.539> saved<00:05:02.539> tomato<00:05:02.870> seeds<00:05:03.169> I<00:05:03.350> choose<00:05:03.620> a

00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:03.919 
how I saved tomato seeds I choose a

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:07.180 
how I saved tomato seeds I choose a
really<00:05:04.580> ripe<00:05:04.820> one<00:05:05.120> and<00:05:05.389> then<00:05:06.110> I<00:05:06.349> just<00:05:06.680> take<00:05:06.889> out

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:07.190 
really ripe one and then I just take out

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:12.969 
really ripe one and then I just take out
the<00:05:08.470> the<00:05:09.470> seeds<00:05:09.740> like<00:05:09.889> this<00:05:11.500> you<00:05:12.500> just<00:05:12.680> you

00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:12.979 
the the seeds like this you just you

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:15.100 
the the seeds like this you just you
just<00:05:13.160> take<00:05:13.340> out<00:05:13.520> the<00:05:13.669> season<00:05:14.030> you<00:05:14.120> and<00:05:14.360> I<00:05:14.840> put

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:17.780 
them on paper towel I find that works

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:19.750 
them on paper towel I find that works
pretty<00:05:18.050> good<00:05:18.169> once<00:05:18.800> they're<00:05:19.039> thoroughly<00:05:19.310> dry

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:19.760 
pretty good once they're thoroughly dry

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:22.240 
pretty good once they're thoroughly dry
and<00:05:20.030> that<00:05:20.180> I'll<00:05:20.419> save<00:05:20.720> them<00:05:20.930> in<00:05:21.110> a<00:05:21.199> plastic<00:05:21.830> bag

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:22.250 
and that I'll save them in a plastic bag

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:24.040 
and that I'll save them in a plastic bag
and<00:05:22.280> Mark<00:05:22.760> on<00:05:22.910> the<00:05:23.030> plastic<00:05:23.449> bag<00:05:23.570> you<00:05:23.930> know

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:24.050 
and Mark on the plastic bag you know

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:27.400 
and Mark on the plastic bag you know
what<00:05:24.260> year<00:05:24.710> it<00:05:24.860> is<00:05:25.039> and<00:05:25.630> often<00:05:26.630> I<00:05:26.870> will<00:05:27.169> weigh

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:27.410 
what year it is and often I will weigh

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:30.310 
what year it is and often I will weigh
the<00:05:27.440> tomato<00:05:28.010> and<00:05:28.760> I'll<00:05:28.940> keep<00:05:29.780> track<00:05:30.080> of<00:05:30.260> the

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:30.320 
the tomato and I'll keep track of the

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:32.770 
the tomato and I'll keep track of the
weight<00:05:30.500> can<00:05:31.280> you<00:05:31.400> show<00:05:31.639> me<00:05:31.669> what<00:05:32.330> these<00:05:32.570> look

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:32.780 
weight can you show me what these look

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:34.980 
weight can you show me what these look
like<00:05:32.840> once<00:05:33.169> they're<00:05:33.229> dried<00:05:33.560> I<00:05:33.889> actually<00:05:34.190> have

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:34.990 
like once they're dried I actually have

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:38.680 
like once they're dried I actually have
some<00:05:36.130> dried<00:05:37.130> ones<00:05:37.400> right<00:05:37.669> here<00:05:37.970> when<00:05:38.330> you<00:05:38.479> want

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:38.690 
some dried ones right here when you want

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:40.540 
some dried ones right here when you want
to<00:05:38.780> go<00:05:38.870> plant<00:05:39.229> them<00:05:39.530> in<00:05:39.560> the<00:05:39.830> spring<00:05:40.039> you<00:05:40.310> just

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:40.550 
to go plant them in the spring you just

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:42.939 
to go plant them in the spring you just
peel<00:05:40.789> them<00:05:41.000> off<00:05:41.180> and<00:05:41.539> plant<00:05:42.380> them<00:05:42.620> and<00:05:42.800> they're

00:05:42.939 --> 00:05:42.949 
peel them off and plant them and they're

00:05:42.949 --> 00:05:45.430 
peel them off and plant them and they're
they're<00:05:43.400> good<00:05:43.639> I<00:05:43.940> always<00:05:44.630> imagine<00:05:45.199> saving

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:45.440 
they're good I always imagine saving

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:48.399 
they're good I always imagine saving
tomato<00:05:45.889> seeds<00:05:46.159> was<00:05:46.340> much<00:05:46.610> more<00:05:46.970> difficult<00:05:47.409> no

00:05:48.399 --> 00:05:48.409 
tomato seeds was much more difficult no

00:05:48.409 --> 00:05:59.399 
tomato seeds was much more difficult no
it<00:05:49.220> is<00:05:49.370> a
