00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:27.519 

this<00:00:25.940> game<00:00:26.150> is<00:00:26.300> awesome<00:00:26.510> it's<00:00:27.050> kind<00:00:27.320> of<00:00:27.350> like

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:27.529 
this game is awesome it's kind of like

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:30.550 
this game is awesome it's kind of like
in<00:00:27.770> riskiest<00:00:28.760> games<00:00:29.150> however<00:00:29.660> it's<00:00:30.110> got<00:00:30.290> one

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:30.560 
in riskiest games however it's got one

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.710 
in riskiest games however it's got one
major<00:00:30.860> difference<00:00:31.189> and<00:00:31.610> that<00:00:31.730> is<00:00:31.849> the<00:00:32.180> gravity

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:32.720 
major difference and that is the gravity

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:38.290 
major difference and that is the gravity
until<00:00:33.650> the<00:00:33.890> game<00:00:36.010> later<00:00:37.010> on<00:00:37.100> shoes<00:00:37.760> I'm<00:00:38.059> really

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:38.300 
until the game later on shoes I'm really

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.030 
until the game later on shoes I'm really
crazy<00:00:38.510> physics<00:00:39.080> we<00:00:39.199> can<00:00:39.379> jump<00:00:39.590> out<00:00:39.739> the<00:00:39.830> walls

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:40.040 
crazy physics we can jump out the walls

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.630 
crazy physics we can jump out the walls
jump<00:00:40.850> over<00:00:41.059> objects<00:00:41.480> and<00:00:41.629> such<00:00:42.309> became<00:00:43.309> as

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:43.640 
jump over objects and such became as

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.510 
jump over objects and such became as
jewelry<00:00:44.090> like<00:00:44.390> this

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:45.520 
jewelry like this

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.220

another<00:00:46.520> good<00:00:46.730> pointer<00:00:47.120> about<00:00:47.330> this<00:00:47.510> game<00:00:47.750> its

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:48.230 
another good pointer about this game its

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:50.770 
another good pointer about this game its
effect<00:00:48.559> you<00:00:48.710> can<00:00:48.890> kill<00:00:49.100> yourself<00:00:49.220> as<00:00:49.879> you<00:00:50.690> can

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:50.780 
effect you can kill yourself as you can

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.229 
effect you can kill yourself as you can
see<00:00:51.019> I've<00:00:51.620> got<00:00:51.890> a<00:00:51.920> full<00:00:52.309> red<00:00:52.519> half<00:00:52.760> at<00:00:53.059> the

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:53.239 
see I've got a full red half at the

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:55.710 
see I've got a full red half at the
bottom<00:00:54.110> left-hand<00:00:54.379> corner<00:00:54.530> on<00:00:54.830> my<00:00:54.860> screen

computer requirements for instance it

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.180 
computer requirements for instance it
only<00:02:05.549> needs<00:02:05.909> a<00:02:06.090> 500<00:02:06.869> megahertz<00:02:07.140> opinion<00:02:07.950> free

128 mega RAM about 256 is recommended on
Windows<00:02:18.120> however<00:02:18.720> we<00:02:19.230> learn<00:02:19.500> this<00:02:19.650> game<00:02:19.680> is<00:02:20.040> we

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
Windows however we learn this game is we

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.809 
Windows however we learn this game is we
don't<00:02:20.340> need<00:02:20.430> Windows<00:02:20.870> recommendations<00:02:21.870> do<00:02:22.110> we

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:22.819 
don't need Windows recommendations do we

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:27.050 
don't need Windows recommendations do we
who<00:02:23.819> needs<00:02:24.090> about<00:02:24.330> 32<00:02:24.930> Meg's<00:02:25.140> around<00:02:25.500> for<00:02:26.060> the

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
who needs about 32 Meg's around for the

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.710 
who needs about 32 Meg's around for the
graphics<00:02:27.590> g-force<00:02:28.590> is<00:02:28.769> recommended<00:02:29.580> and<00:02:29.940> so

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
graphics g-force is recommended and so

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.030 
graphics g-force is recommended and so
is<00:02:30.870> 64<00:02:31.470> Meg's<00:02:31.709> of<00:02:31.860> RAM<00:02:32.150> so<00:02:33.150> 32<00:02:33.750> is<00:02:33.810> really<00:02:34.440> it<00:02:34.890> on

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
is 64 Meg's of RAM so 32 is really it on

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:40.220 
is 64 Meg's of RAM so 32 is really it on
and<00:02:37.160> it's<00:02:38.160> a<00:02:38.250> really<00:02:38.400> nice<00:02:38.640> thing<00:02:39.110> it<00:02:40.110> only

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
and it's a really nice thing it only

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.990 
and it's a really nice thing it only
uses<00:02:40.739> up<00:02:41.040> about<00:02:41.280> 4<00:02:41.519> any<00:02:41.670> mix<00:02:41.880> of<00:02:42.560> address<00:02:43.560> race

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
uses up about 4 any mix of address race

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.570 
uses up about 4 any mix of address race
so<00:02:45.000> you<00:02:45.299> have<00:02:45.390> a<00:02:45.450> small<00:02:45.720> hard<00:02:45.989> drive<00:02:46.080> or<00:02:46.709> just<00:02:47.099> a

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
so you have a small hard drive or just a

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.390 
so you have a small hard drive or just a
small<00:02:48.120> home<00:02:48.360> computer<00:02:49.010> you<00:02:50.010> can<00:02:50.160> probably

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
small home computer you can probably

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.680 
small home computer you can probably
play<00:02:50.670> the<00:02:50.819> game<00:02:51.000> it's<00:02:51.569> really<00:02:51.930> there<00:02:52.170> good<00:02:53.690> not

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
play the game it's really there good not

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.330 
play the game it's really there good not
too<00:02:54.810> sure<00:02:54.989> how<00:02:55.260> they<00:02:55.500> you'll<00:02:55.799> be<00:02:56.010> on<00:02:56.130> those

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
too sure how they you'll be on those

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:06.220 
too sure how they you'll be on those
Peaks<00:02:56.609> however

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:09.199 

thirty<00:03:07.230> real<00:03:07.530> downside<00:03:08.069> of<00:03:08.159> the<00:03:08.250> game<00:03:08.459> is<00:03:08.879> it

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
thirty real downside of the game is it

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:12.170 
thirty real downside of the game is it
graphics<00:03:09.689> really<00:03:10.310> other<00:03:11.310> than<00:03:11.579> the<00:03:11.670> graphics

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
graphics really other than the graphics

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.640 
graphics really other than the graphics
it's<00:03:12.480> not<00:03:12.689> up<00:03:12.900> to<00:03:12.930> date<00:03:13.319> it's<00:03:13.590> not

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
it's not up to date it's not

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.610 
it's not up to date it's not
