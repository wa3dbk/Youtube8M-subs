the shark raw was a long time coming

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:30.450 
the shark raw was a long time coming
with<00:00:28.660> a<00:00:28.690> few<00:00:28.900> production<00:00:29.320> delays<00:00:29.590> we<00:00:30.130> had<00:00:30.310> this

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:30.460 
with a few production delays we had this

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:32.160 
with a few production delays we had this
one<00:00:30.700> for<00:00:30.910> a<00:00:30.970> couple<00:00:31.090> of<00:00:31.300> months<00:00:31.630> and<00:00:31.780> rode<00:00:31.960> with

one for a couple of months and rode with

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:33.270 
one for a couple of months and rode with
it<00:00:32.290> back<00:00:32.470> when<00:00:32.680> the<00:00:32.740> weather<00:00:32.920> was<00:00:33.040> more

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.330 
it back when the weather was more

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:36.340 
suitable to be honest the helmet is more

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:38.250 
suitable to be honest the helmet is more
of<00:00:36.400> a<00:00:36.460> novelty<00:00:36.790> than<00:00:37.060> anything<00:00:37.240> else<00:00:37.570> it<00:00:38.080> has<00:00:38.230> a

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.560 
few flaws that could be and should be
fixed<00:00:40.840> and<00:00:41.260> I'll<00:00:41.410> get<00:00:41.590> to<00:00:41.620> that<00:00:41.710> in<00:00:41.830> a<00:00:42.040> minute
