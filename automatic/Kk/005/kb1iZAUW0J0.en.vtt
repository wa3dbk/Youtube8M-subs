now<00:00:49.199> this<00:00:50.199> is<00:00:50.320> the<00:00:50.440> problem<00:00:50.650> I'll<00:00:51.580> start<00:00:51.879> it<00:00:52.030> up

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
now this is the problem I'll start it up

there it's the AC voltage coming out for

there it's the AC voltage coming out for
the<00:01:03.159> sensor<00:01:04.320> they<00:01:05.320> see<00:01:05.560> very<00:01:06.520> low<00:01:06.670> current

very little talk almost no talk at all I

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:44.730 
very little talk almost no talk at all I
put<00:01:42.439> my<00:01:42.560> finger<00:01:42.920> on<00:01:42.950> it

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:44.740 
put my finger on it

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:56.490 
put my finger on it
slow<00:01:45.400> it<00:01:45.520> down<00:01:48.900> barely<00:01:49.900> any<00:01:50.020> pressure<00:01:50.320> I<00:01:50.680> can

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.500 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.560 

stop<00:01:57.250> and<00:01:57.430> I<00:01:57.460> the<00:01:57.520> count<00:01:57.820> isn't<00:01:58.000> increasing<00:01:58.300> at

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:58.570 
stop and I the count isn't increasing at

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:02.370 
stop and I the count isn't increasing at
all<00:01:58.890> well<00:01:59.890> not<00:02:00.130> very<00:02:00.160> noticeable<00:02:00.970> degree<00:02:01.380> are

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
all well not very noticeable degree are

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:03.450 
all well not very noticeable degree are
you<00:02:02.410> putting<00:02:02.710> a<00:02:02.740> fair<00:02:02.920> bit<00:02:03.070> of<00:02:03.160> pressure<00:02:03.340> there

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:03.460 
you putting a fair bit of pressure there

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:12.160 
you putting a fair bit of pressure there
now<00:02:05.940> but<00:02:06.940> I<00:02:06.970> can<00:02:07.390> stop<00:02:07.750> the<00:02:07.870> motor

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:18.070 

can<00:02:12.770> i<00:02:12.800> hmm<00:02:13.900> maybe<00:02:14.900> not<00:02:16.840> siliconed<00:02:17.840> isn't

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
can i hmm maybe not siliconed isn't

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:26.200 
can i hmm maybe not siliconed isn't
going<00:02:18.290> up<00:02:19.720> massively<00:02:21.430> no<00:02:24.550> no<00:02:25.550> I<00:02:25.580> can't<00:02:25.940> stall

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:26.210 
going up massively no no I can't stall

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:29.380 
going up massively no no I can't stall
the<00:02:26.330> motor<00:02:26.510> out<00:02:27.550> not<00:02:28.550> without<00:02:28.790> burning<00:02:29.150> my

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
the motor out not without burning my

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:34.150 
the motor out not without burning my
finger<00:02:29.690> anyway<00:02:29.960> yeah<00:02:32.590> now<00:02:33.590> look<00:02:33.740> what<00:02:33.860> happens

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
finger anyway yeah now look what happens

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.290 
finger anyway yeah now look what happens
if<00:02:34.400> I<00:02:35.110> increase<00:02:36.110> the<00:02:36.260> throttle<00:02:36.650> yet<00:02:37.010> again<00:02:37.340> one

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:38.300 
if I increase the throttle yet again one

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.240 
if I increase the throttle yet again one
more<00:02:38.510> pulse<00:02:38.690> on<00:02:38.930> the<00:02:39.020> throttle<00:02:39.350> this<00:02:39.890> is<00:02:40.070> maybe

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
more pulse on the throttle this is maybe

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:41.440 
more pulse on the throttle this is maybe
if<00:02:40.550> you<00:02:40.730> were<00:02:40.820> doing<00:02:40.940> it<00:02:41.060> with<00:02:41.150> a<00:02:41.240> hand

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
if you were doing it with a hand

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:49.000 
if you were doing it with a hand
throttle<00:02:42.400> less<00:02:43.400> than<00:02:45.130> less<00:02:46.130> than<00:02:46.840> 5%<00:02:47.840> 10%<00:02:48.410> turn

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.010 
throttle less than less than 5% 10% turn
to<00:02:49.610> barely<00:02:49.940> at<00:02:50.150> any<00:02:50.330> movement<00:02:50.840> on<00:02:50.930> the

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:51.020 
to barely at any movement on the

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:53.170 
to barely at any movement on the
throttle<00:02:51.430> it<00:02:52.430> was<00:02:52.550> that's<00:02:52.730> why<00:02:52.880> I'm<00:02:52.940> using<00:02:53.090> the

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
throttle it was that's why I'm using the

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:54.760 
throttle it was that's why I'm using the
controller<00:02:53.540> cruise<00:02:53.750> control<00:02:54.140> one<00:02:54.350> more<00:02:54.530> place

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:54.770

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.180 

you<00:03:02.860> know<00:03:02.950> it<00:03:03.100> slows<00:03:03.490> down<00:03:03.760> and<00:03:03.970> it<00:03:04.090> stops<00:03:04.540> I

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
you know it slows down and it stops I

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:08.490 
you know it slows down and it stops I
think<00:03:06.190> it's<00:03:06.370> gonna<00:03:06.490> stop<00:03:06.640> yeah<00:03:07.350> reduce<00:03:08.350> the

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
think it's gonna stop yeah reduce the

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.430 
think it's gonna stop yeah reduce the
cruise<00:03:08.710> control<00:03:08.740> again<00:03:10.200> check<00:03:11.200> the<00:03:11.260> cruise

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
cruise control again check the cruise

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.110 
cruise control again check the cruise
control<00:03:11.770> down<00:03:12.120> back<00:03:13.120> to<00:03:13.270> a<00:03:13.300> lower<00:03:13.510> setting

I've gone all the way down to pretty

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:20.760 
I've gone all the way down to pretty
much<00:03:17.650> zero<00:03:17.920> throttle<00:03:18.430> there<00:03:18.610> and<00:03:19.560> then<00:03:20.560> come

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:20.770 
much zero throttle there and then come

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:27.110 
much zero throttle there and then come
