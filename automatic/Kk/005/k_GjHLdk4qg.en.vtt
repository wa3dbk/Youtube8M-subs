seventy and chips I decide about 90,000
and<00:02:08.750> my<00:02:09.500> thinking<00:02:09.890> is<00:02:10.009> if<00:02:10.130> he<00:02:10.220> moves<00:02:10.340> all<00:02:10.580> in<00:02:10.760> on

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:10.880

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
look at it this way he could hit an 8 a

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.760 
look at it this way he could hit an 8 a
10<00:02:26.650> for<00:02:27.190> spade<00:02:27.460> and<00:02:27.700> knocked<00:02:27.880> me<00:02:28.030> out<00:02:28.060> so<00:02:28.810> I'd
