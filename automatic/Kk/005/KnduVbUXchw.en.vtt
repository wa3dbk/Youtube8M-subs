00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:11.690
 Hello, today I want to tell you how 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:13.570
 at home you can independently 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:16.119
 cook very 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:18.640
 and for this we need 1 liter 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:21.220
 milk milk choose the one that you 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:24.210
 more like but of course sourdough 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:26.590
 for kefir from our favorite site offer 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.470
 bags of leaven in a box 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:31.750
 dual and for making kefir us 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:34.930
 I only need one half of her 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:37.239
 already cut off now i'm pouring milk into 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:42.250
 the pot will warm it a little and 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:44.800
 I will come back to you and so I warmed up the milk 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:47.050
 to a temperature of about 25 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:50.110
 degrees now i have to pour 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.850
 the contents of this bag in milk I am 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:54.309
 already did so with one hand it 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:56.530
 do not quite comfortable leaven 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:59.079
 sprinkle milk in a trickle 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:01.059
 stir constantly with a spoon otherwise 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:03.940
 the leaven will be lumped to you later 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:05.320
 it will be hard enough to break them down so 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.750
 we added leaven 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:10.750
 now we need prepared milk 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:13.270
 leave in a warm place as indicated 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:16.479
 pack for 24 hours 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:19.420
 from personal experience I can say that 24 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:20.799
 hours is a lot since approximately 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.430
 after 12 hours 

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:24.840
 milk with booze and purchase 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.600
 enough 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.850
 The right consistency of kefir and already in 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:34.329
 this time you need to start trying kefir 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:37.180
 if the taste is exactly kefir acid you 

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:38.799
 then we are satisfied with the resulting product 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.750
 Immediately put in the fridge to 

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:43.000
 stop the ripening process 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:45.490
 if you like kefir more then 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.520
 you need to leave the saucepan still warm for 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:51.189
 some time as soon as you 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:55.829
 satisfied with the taste of kefir as I said 

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:59.200
 refrigerate immediately 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:01.600
 It took 12 hours with a little and my kefir 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:04.090
 ready for consistency, it turned out 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.020
 a bit grainy but me this is not 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.909
 upset 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.580
 since it tasted the same 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:11.590
 delicious as always 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:14.620
 noticed that there is a consistency of kefir 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:16.690
 depends on the degree of freshness of milk than 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:19.390
 fresh milk is all the more smooth 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:21.940
 my kefir texture is obtained 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:24.910
 the milk lay in the fridge one day 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:27.760
 maybe that's why such here gathered 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:30.360
 lumps if you can call them taste 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:34.330
 I'm completely satisfied 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:37.120
 a reference to the leaven from the website iherb 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:40.660
 leave as always below and I am left 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:43.890
 wish you all bon appetit thanks 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.890
