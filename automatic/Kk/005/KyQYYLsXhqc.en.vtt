00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:05.400
 Alfred Hitchcock once said about the films .. 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.400
 "Creativity based on the exact science of public reaction" 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.670
 After this shower scene several years ago, the audience's reactions became more precise. 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.100
 Where neuroscientists look at how we watch movies 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:26.420
 To see which of the filmmaking techniques have the most control over the minds of viewers. 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.460
 It is generally called "neural cinema" 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.420
 In one study, participants watched 30 minutes of "The Good, The Bad and The Ugly" 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.210
 In a magnetic camera that records their mental activity. 

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:46.759
 Researchers compared the pattern of activity in participants' brains 

00:00:46.759 --> 00:00:48.939
 They found it remarkably identical. 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:54.500
 During specific scenes of the film activity increased in certain areas of the brain 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.840
 And fell at the same time among subscribers 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.020
 Their eyes followed the same areas on the screen 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.380
 The researchers suggested that this suggests that the scenes are more striking. 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:12.200
 A follow-up study compared the mental activity of participants who saw that film 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.800
 Watching other things 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.420
 Such as the episode of Alfred Hitchcock Presents, 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.800
 And a series of (Curb Your Enthusiasm) 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.240
 And a real 10-minute clip without modifications to a park in New York. 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.840
 The researchers again used the similarity of brain activity to the participant 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.420
 As a measure of the extent of attention drawn in the viewer. 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:38.120
 They found that Hitchcock's episode had stimulated similar brain activity among all viewers in more than 65 percent of the brain's cortex 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:39.740
 It is the outer layer of the brain. 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.640
 A similar activity was observed in 45% of the film's crust (The Good, The Bad and the Ugly) 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.820
 But only 18% of the series (Curb Your Enthusiasm) 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.700
 And 5% (for the real section of New York City Park). 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:59.800
 The study shows that Hitchcock can regulate the responses of different brain regions in a timely manner among all viewers. 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:05.740
 Of course, functional MRI can assess the artistic and aesthetic value of a film. 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:11.520
 Some films and television programs aim to control the public's reaction more than others 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.680
 As it depends on the way the director and his intentions. 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.360
 But soon we can see the audience sitting in the director's seat. 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:28.100
 It is suggested that the films will be interactive so that they can respond to your brain activity as you watch them 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.940
 So they can be more fun. 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.340
 They end up like choosing your own adventure 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.060
 Which could end up in the correct definition of a terrifying film. 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.580
 Neuroscience can objectively measure part of the entertainment value and audience reaction 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.880
 On movies, TV shows and ads 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:53.400
 We can use the results to fine-tune how they engage and their effectiveness emotionally. 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.880
 But she can not tell us who will win the Oscars this year 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.640
 Despite the ability of so much information. 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:06.260
 Watch Forward Thinking to see how something that seems unpredictable seems to be doing 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:10.790
 Such as the Oscars to predict the correct methodology. 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.960
 There is a new meaning to the lights, the camera, and the performance. 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:24.820
 Let me know what you think and - your footage of the Oscars - in the comments. 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:30.600
