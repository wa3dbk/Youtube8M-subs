typically what happens with another
recorder<00:01:28.049> is<00:01:28.229> that<00:01:28.530> it'll<00:01:28.770> disconnect<00:01:29.430> after

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
recorder is that it'll disconnect after

recorder is that it'll disconnect after
an<00:01:29.880> hour<00:01:30.060> and<00:01:30.420> then<00:01:30.450> you<00:01:30.960> have<00:01:31.079> to<00:01:31.110> reconnect

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
an hour and then you have to reconnect

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.190 
an hour and then you have to reconnect
to<00:01:32.220> get<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.700> rest<00:01:32.939> of<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.270> stream<00:01:33.540> but<00:01:33.810> WM
