00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
hi guys welcome to the SRR 33 a tree

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:13.190 
hi guys welcome to the SRR 33 a tree
conga<00:00:07.740> the<00:00:08.429> SRR<00:00:08.820> 33<00:00:09.510> 8<00:00:09.780> is<00:00:10.139> a<00:00:11.210> sniper<00:00:12.210> rifle<00:00:12.480> but

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
conga the SRR 33 8 is a sniper rifle but

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.320 
conga the SRR 33 8 is a sniper rifle but
it's<00:00:13.380> sort<00:00:13.740> of<00:00:13.889> like<00:00:14.130> a<00:00:14.160> blend<00:00:14.610> between<00:00:14.820> sniper

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
it's sort of like a blend between sniper

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.200 
it's sort of like a blend between sniper
rifle<00:00:15.780> and<00:00:15.929> DMR<00:00:16.410> I<00:00:16.680> think<00:00:17.130> the<00:00:17.250> first<00:00:17.550> major

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
rifle and DMR I think the first major

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.400 
rifle and DMR I think the first major
thing<00:00:18.600> that<00:00:18.630> you're<00:00:18.869> going<00:00:18.960> to<00:00:19.050> notice<00:00:19.320> about

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
thing that you're going to notice about

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.540 
thing that you're going to notice about
this<00:00:19.770> is<00:00:19.980> that<00:00:20.609> it<00:00:21.300> has<00:00:21.600> a<00:00:21.630> huge<00:00:22.310> shake<00:00:23.310> in

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
this is that it has a huge shake in

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.460 
this is that it has a huge shake in
between<00:00:23.880> fires<00:00:24.210> or<00:00:24.779> you're<00:00:24.960> gonna<00:00:25.080> become

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
between fires or you're gonna become

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.500 
between fires or you're gonna become
very<00:00:25.949> inaccurate<00:00:26.310> in<00:00:26.609> between<00:00:26.880> shots<00:00:27.180> and

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
very inaccurate in between shots and

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.050 
very inaccurate in between shots and
also<00:00:28.050> you'll<00:00:28.410> notice<00:00:28.619> another<00:00:29.340> main<00:00:29.760> thing

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
also you'll notice another main thing

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.089 
also you'll notice another main thing
with<00:00:30.179> this<00:00:30.330> is<00:00:30.510> the<00:00:30.630> bullets<00:00:31.019> are<00:00:31.230> so<00:00:31.590> slow<00:00:32.070> on

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
with this is the bullets are so slow on

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.790 
with this is the bullets are so slow on
this<00:00:32.430> thing<00:00:32.669> they're<00:00:33.149> barely<00:00:33.570> twenty<00:00:34.350> million

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
this thing they're barely twenty million

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.310 
this thing they're barely twenty million
twenty<00:00:35.460> meters<00:00:35.760> per<00:00:36.059> second<00:00:36.480> faster<00:00:36.899> than<00:00:36.930> the

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
twenty meters per second faster than the

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.740 
twenty meters per second faster than the
m40a5<00:00:38.010> which<00:00:38.670> is<00:00:38.790> one<00:00:38.969> of<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.120> slowest<00:00:39.510> sniper

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
m40a5 which is one of the slowest sniper

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.900 
m40a5 which is one of the slowest sniper
rifles<00:00:40.200> so<00:00:40.680> most<00:00:40.950> of<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.280> DMR's

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
rifles so most of the DMR's

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.990 
rifles so most of the DMR's
are<00:00:42.210> gonna<00:00:42.480> out<00:00:42.660> speed<00:00:43.200> you<00:00:43.440> and<00:00:43.680> not<00:00:44.489> only<00:00:44.520> do

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
are gonna out speed you and not only do

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.240 
are gonna out speed you and not only do
you<00:00:45.120> only<00:00:45.270> have<00:00:45.390> 11<00:00:46.170> shots<00:00:46.440> compared<00:00:46.920> to<00:00:47.039> some

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
you only have 11 shots compared to some

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.729 
you only have 11 shots compared to some
of<00:00:47.340> the<00:00:47.370> DMR's<00:00:47.789> having<00:00:48.149> nearly<00:00:48.539> 30<00:00:49.050> you're

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
of the DMR's having nearly 30 you're

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.010 
of the DMR's having nearly 30 you're
going<00:00:50.039> to<00:00:50.190> have<00:00:50.309> to<00:00:50.520> deal<00:00:50.670> with<00:00:50.789> that<00:00:51.030> and<00:00:51.390> they

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
going to have to deal with that and they

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.900 
going to have to deal with that and they
also<00:00:52.230> fire<00:00:52.680> much<00:00:53.039> faster<00:00:53.520> than<00:00:53.670> you

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
also fire much faster than you

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.660 
also fire much faster than you
incredibly<00:00:54.690> faster<00:00:55.530> so<00:00:55.829> basically<00:00:56.219> what<00:00:56.460> this

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
incredibly faster so basically what this

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.950 
incredibly faster so basically what this
comes<00:00:56.940> down<00:00:57.030> to<00:00:57.270> is<00:00:57.719> this<00:00:58.170> becomes<00:00:58.680> a<00:00:59.100> a

00:00:59.950 --> 00:00:59.960 
comes down to is this becomes a a

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.569 
comes down to is this becomes a a
medium-range<00:01:00.960> sniper<00:01:01.649> rifle<00:01:02.070> where<00:01:02.219> you<00:01:02.309> go

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
medium-range sniper rifle where you go

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.820 
medium-range sniper rifle where you go
for<00:01:02.820> headshots<00:01:03.059> this<00:01:03.840> excels<00:01:04.379> at<00:01:04.650> taking

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
for headshots this excels at taking

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.460 
for headshots this excels at taking
headshots<00:01:05.369> where<00:01:06.240> it<00:01:06.570> can<00:01:06.780> actually<00:01:06.810> beat

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
headshots where it can actually beat

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.500 
headshots where it can actually beat
multiple<00:01:08.250> snipers<00:01:08.670> to<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:08.970> head<00:01:09.150> shots<00:01:09.390> and

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
multiple snipers to the head shots and

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.060 
multiple snipers to the head shots and
you<00:01:09.630> can<00:01:09.810> get<00:01:09.960> a<00:01:09.990> bunch<00:01:10.290> of<00:01:10.409> headshots<00:01:10.619> on<00:01:11.040> a

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
you can get a bunch of headshots on a

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.450 
you can get a bunch of headshots on a
row<00:01:11.369> but<00:01:12.680> anything<00:01:13.680> that<00:01:13.710> isn't<00:01:14.070> a<00:01:14.130> headshot

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
row but anything that isn't a headshot

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.980 
row but anything that isn't a headshot
becomes<00:01:15.060> really<00:01:15.299> difficult<00:01:15.479> to<00:01:15.840> make

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
becomes really difficult to make

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.380 
becomes really difficult to make
especially<00:01:16.770> because<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:17.729> follow-up<00:01:18.119> shots

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
especially because the follow-up shots

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.810 
especially because the follow-up shots
like<00:01:18.659> I<00:01:18.780> said<00:01:18.990> are<00:01:19.259> very<00:01:19.320> inaccurate<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:20.640> more

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
like I said are very inaccurate the more

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.690 
like I said are very inaccurate the more
you<00:01:21.030> shoot<00:01:21.270> and<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:21.869> faster<00:01:22.259> you<00:01:22.290> shoot<00:01:22.700> you

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
you shoot and the faster you shoot you

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.670 
you shoot and the faster you shoot you
have<00:01:23.820> to<00:01:23.939> wait<00:01:24.119> in<00:01:24.299> between<00:01:24.570> shots<00:01:24.750> hitting

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
have to wait in between shots hitting

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.039 
have to wait in between shots hitting
multiple<00:01:25.890> shots<00:01:26.610> on<00:01:26.939> so<00:01:27.119> much<00:01:27.240> chest<00:01:27.600> is<00:01:27.780> very

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
multiple shots on so much chest is very

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.109 
multiple shots on so much chest is very
very<00:01:28.320> difficult<00:01:28.799> with<00:01:28.920> this<00:01:29.070> gun<00:01:29.280> basically

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
very difficult with this gun basically

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.149 
very difficult with this gun basically
it<00:01:30.210> comes<00:01:30.360> down<00:01:30.479> to<00:01:30.600> anything<00:01:31.350> that<00:01:31.619> isn't<00:01:31.950> a

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
it comes down to anything that isn't a

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.770 
it comes down to anything that isn't a
headshot<00:01:32.460> you<00:01:32.670> hit<00:01:32.880> someone<00:01:33.090> in<00:01:33.240> the<00:01:33.329> shoulder

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
headshot you hit someone in the shoulder

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.780 
headshot you hit someone in the shoulder
or<00:01:34.049> something<00:01:34.200> just<00:01:34.680> barely<00:01:34.979> missing<00:01:35.400> it's

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
or something just barely missing it's

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.100 
or something just barely missing it's
pretty<00:01:36.060> much<00:01:36.210> useless<00:01:36.479> because<00:01:36.840> they're

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
pretty much useless because they're

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.749 
pretty much useless because they're
gonna<00:01:37.229> move<00:01:37.470> out<00:01:37.650> of<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:37.799> way<00:01:37.920> and<00:01:38.130> it's<00:01:38.520> to<00:01:38.640> be

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
gonna move out of the way and it's to be

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.090 
gonna move out of the way and it's to be
incredibly<00:01:39.180> difficult<00:01:39.360> to<00:01:39.630> hit<00:01:39.720> anybody

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 
incredibly difficult to hit anybody

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.039 
incredibly difficult to hit anybody
because<00:01:41.100> there<00:01:41.340> was<00:01:41.729> they<00:01:41.909> become<00:01:42.150> aware<00:01:42.240> they

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
because there was they become aware they

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.690 
because there was they become aware they
everything<00:01:43.740> goes<00:01:43.920> berserk<00:01:44.280> because<00:01:44.399> this

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
everything goes berserk because this

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.539 
everything goes berserk because this
shoots<00:01:45.000> so<00:01:45.299> slow<00:01:45.630> you<00:01:46.290> have<00:01:46.320> to<00:01:46.740> wait<00:01:46.890> so<00:01:47.310> long

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
shoots so slow you have to wait so long

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.880 
shoots so slow you have to wait so long
the<00:01:48.329> bullet<00:01:48.630> takes<00:01:48.840> so<00:01:49.110> long<00:01:49.320> to<00:01:49.380> get<00:01:49.680> there

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
the bullet takes so long to get there

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.149 
the bullet takes so long to get there
it's<00:01:50.130> just<00:01:50.490> terrible<00:01:50.880> so<00:01:51.229> it<00:01:52.229> really<00:01:53.040> only

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
it's just terrible so it really only

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.550 
it's just terrible so it really only
excels<00:01:53.790> at<00:01:54.060> shooting<00:01:54.390> at<00:01:54.509> people<00:01:54.720> who<00:01:55.229> are

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
excels at shooting at people who are

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.870 
excels at shooting at people who are
standing<00:01:56.009> still<00:01:56.780> who<00:01:57.780> are<00:01:57.930> not<00:01:58.079> aware<00:01:58.200> of<00:01:58.439> you

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
standing still who are not aware of you

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.359 
standing still who are not aware of you
but<00:01:59.880> when<00:02:00.450> it<00:02:00.570> does<00:02:00.750> that<00:02:00.780> you<00:02:01.590> can<00:02:01.799> shoot<00:02:02.040> this

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
but when it does that you can shoot this

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.700 
but when it does that you can shoot this
much<00:02:02.759> faster<00:02:03.270> getting<00:02:03.540> headshots<00:02:03.780> than

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
much faster getting headshots than

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.499 
much faster getting headshots than
someone<00:02:05.189> using<00:02:05.520> a<00:02:05.579> sniper<00:02:05.850> rifle<00:02:06.090> could

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
someone using a sniper rifle could

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.130 
someone using a sniper rifle could
getting<00:02:07.350> chest<00:02:07.890> shots

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
getting chest shots

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.430 
getting chest shots
so<00:02:09.740> you<00:02:09.800> could<00:02:10.070> potentially<00:02:10.840> out<00:02:11.840> cheat<00:02:12.230> them

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
so you could potentially out cheat them

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.760 
so you could potentially out cheat them
but<00:02:13.220> I<00:02:13.490> just<00:02:14.000> saw<00:02:14.180> in<00:02:14.450> the<00:02:14.660> clip<00:02:14.900> earlier<00:02:15.170> there

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:15.770 
but I just saw in the clip earlier there

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:19.450 
but I just saw in the clip earlier there
I<00:02:16.040> had<00:02:16.940> gotten<00:02:17.180> shot<00:02:17.600> by<00:02:18.500> a<00:02:18.530> sniper<00:02:18.680> because<00:02:19.190> I

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:19.460 
I had gotten shot by a sniper because I

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:21.310 
I had gotten shot by a sniper because I
shot<00:02:19.730> I<00:02:19.940> shot<00:02:20.000> him<00:02:20.360> in<00:02:20.390> the<00:02:20.450> chest<00:02:20.540> and<00:02:20.960> that

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:21.320 
shot I shot him in the chest and that

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.080 
shot I shot him in the chest and that
gave<00:02:21.500> him<00:02:21.680> the<00:02:21.830> chance<00:02:22.070> to<00:02:22.280> shoot<00:02:22.430> me<00:02:22.670> he<00:02:22.940> could

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
gave him the chance to shoot me he could

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.030 
gave him the chance to shoot me he could
hit<00:02:23.210> me<00:02:23.360> anywhere<00:02:23.870> in<00:02:23.990> hardcore<00:02:24.410> and<00:02:24.590> that

hit me anywhere in hardcore and that
kills<00:02:25.310> me<00:02:25.400> so<00:02:26.180> you<00:02:26.750> come<00:02:26.960> up<00:02:26.990> against<00:02:27.410> that<00:02:27.530> and

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
kills me so you come up against that and

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
kills me so you come up against that and
you<00:02:27.740> don't<00:02:27.920> hit<00:02:28.070> him<00:02:28.190> in<00:02:28.250> the<00:02:28.340> head

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
you don't hit him in the head

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.880 
you don't hit him in the head
