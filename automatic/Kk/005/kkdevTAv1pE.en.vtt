what is mostly interesting with color is

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.299 
what is mostly interesting with color is
not<00:00:39.239> as<00:00:39.539> much<00:00:39.870> the<00:00:40.260> idea<00:00:40.500> that<00:00:40.679> color<00:00:40.949> can

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
not as much the idea that color can

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.729 
not as much the idea that color can
transform<00:00:41.850> in<00:00:42.059> space<00:00:42.690> from<00:00:42.989> smaller<00:00:43.379> to

transform in space from smaller to

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.340 
transform in space from smaller to
bigger<00:00:43.769> but<00:00:44.370> that<00:00:44.609> it<00:00:45.089> actually<00:00:45.149> can<00:00:45.809> really

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
bigger but that it actually can really

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:52.069

complement<00:01:15.300> what<00:01:15.570> was<00:01:15.720> there<00:01:15.990> and<00:01:16.260> for<00:01:17.070> that

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
complement what was there and for that

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.960 
complement what was there and for that
we<00:01:17.670> chose<00:01:18.080> linen<00:01:19.080> revenge<00:01:19.800> anymore<00:01:20.070> which<00:01:20.700> is

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
we chose linen revenge anymore which is

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.630 
we chose linen revenge anymore which is
a<00:01:21.300> non<00:01:22.080> white<00:01:22.350> that<00:01:22.770> why<00:01:22.950> there<00:01:23.220> is<00:01:23.310> a<00:01:23.340> non

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
a non white that why there is a non

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.640 
a non white that why there is a non
white<00:01:23.880> it's<00:01:24.300> more<00:01:24.690> neutral<00:01:25.200> than<00:01:25.230> white

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
white it's more neutral than white

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.340 
white it's more neutral than white
because<00:01:26.070> white<00:01:26.310> can<00:01:26.610> be<00:01:26.760> very<00:01:27.150> very<00:01:27.510> sharp<00:01:27.930> and

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
because white can be very very sharp and

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.440 
because white can be very very sharp and
and<00:01:28.650> strong<00:01:29.010> this<00:01:29.310> is<00:01:29.370> more<00:01:29.730> like<00:01:29.910> a<00:01:29.940> green

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
and strong this is more like a green

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.010 
and strong this is more like a green
color<00:01:31.370> and<00:01:32.370> then<00:01:32.730> we<00:01:32.970> contrasted<00:01:33.780> that<00:01:33.810> with

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
color and then we contrasted that with

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.840 
color and then we contrasted that with
this<00:01:35.030> phenomenal<00:01:36.030> color<00:01:36.390> called<00:01:37.320> Utah<00:01:38.040> sky<00:01:38.430> by

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:44.400 
anecdote about this is also that the

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.850 
anecdote about this is also that the
apartment<00:01:44.910> was<00:01:45.060> then<00:01:45.300> published<00:01:45.600> they<00:01:46.170> widely

books here in New York City where

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.770 
books here in New York City where
basically<00:02:15.230> we<00:02:15.500> were<00:02:15.650> given<00:02:16.010> a<00:02:16.180> small<00:02:17.180> room

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
basically we were given a small room

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.949 
basically we were given a small room
that<00:02:18.230> the<00:02:18.850> interesting<00:02:19.850> thing<00:02:20.060> of<00:02:20.209> was<00:02:20.510> it<00:02:20.720> was

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959 
that the interesting thing of was it was

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:24.009 
that the interesting thing of was it was
almost<00:02:21.140> a<00:02:21.470> cube<00:02:21.830> and<00:02:22.630> sort<00:02:23.630> of<00:02:23.720> like<00:02:23.900> the

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:24.019 
almost a cube and sort of like the

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:26.770 
almost a cube and sort of like the
initial<00:02:24.440> intention<00:02:25.130> from<00:02:25.400> our<00:02:25.549> n<00:02:25.760> was<00:02:26.180> what<00:02:26.630> if

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
initial intention from our n was what if

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.199 
initial intention from our n was what if
we<00:02:26.959> divided<00:02:27.290> with<00:02:27.650> a<00:02:27.680> diagonal<00:02:28.069> plane<00:02:28.640> and<00:02:29.030> so

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:29.209 
we divided with a diagonal plane and so

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:32.170 
we divided with a diagonal plane and so
we're<00:02:29.420> left<00:02:29.720> with<00:02:29.959> these<00:02:30.140> two<00:02:30.890> parts<00:02:31.610> of<00:02:32.120> a

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
cube and then we colored that space

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:38.320 
cube and then we colored that space
exactly<00:02:36.140> like<00:02:36.530> that<00:02:36.560> we<00:02:37.130> call<00:02:37.370> her<00:02:37.489> that<00:02:37.519> a<00:02:38.000> fin

through a plane of steps that basically

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
ended up being a space for sitting and

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.240 
ended up being a space for sitting and
reading<00:02:49.670> books<00:02:50.060> or<00:02:50.620> having<00:02:51.620> meetings<00:02:52.070> and

forth<00:02:58.430> but<00:02:59.150> the<00:02:59.480> space<00:02:59.840> was<00:03:00.170> really

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
forth but the space was really

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.500 
forth but the space was really
completely<00:03:01.310> transformed<00:03:02.150> and<00:03:02.420> the

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
completely transformed and the

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.210 
completely transformed and the
perception<00:03:03.049> of<00:03:03.140> the<00:03:03.200> space<00:03:03.530> was<00:03:03.709> completely

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
perception of the space was completely

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:05.830 
perception of the space was completely
transformed<00:03:04.760> and<00:03:04.880> I<00:03:04.940> think<00:03:05.120> for<00:03:05.299> us<00:03:05.450> it<00:03:05.660> was<00:03:05.810> a

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
transformed and I think for us it was a

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.250 
transformed and I think for us it was a
very<00:03:06.079> important<00:03:06.799> uh<00:03:07.329> knowledge<00:03:08.329> meant<00:03:08.870> of

very important uh knowledge meant of

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:13.020 
very important uh knowledge meant of
what<00:03:09.950> one<00:03:10.310> can<00:03:10.670> do<00:03:10.940> through<00:03:11.870> the<00:03:12.019> use<00:03:12.170> of<00:03:12.320> color

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
what one can do through the use of color

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.670 
what one can do through the use of color
there's<00:03:14.030> no<00:03:14.120> risk<00:03:14.420> in<00:03:14.660> choosing<00:03:15.049> the<00:03:15.170> color<00:03:15.410> as

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
there's no risk in choosing the color as

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.920 
there's no risk in choosing the color as
long<00:03:15.709> as<00:03:15.920> one<00:03:16.250> is<00:03:16.280> courage<00:03:16.790> to<00:03:17.090> choose<00:03:17.329> color

scholar<00:03:22.519> I<00:03:22.970> really<00:03:23.750> think<00:03:23.959> that<00:03:24.850> color<00:03:25.850> is

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030 
scholar I really think that color is

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.549 
scholar I really think that color is
such<00:03:26.239> an<00:03:26.420> empowering<00:03:27.549> thing
