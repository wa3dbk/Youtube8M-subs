00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.420
 hello today comes her new food 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.550
 stato mini led lamp she is really 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.400
 very very small i have it in the beginning 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.809
 not at all as the led 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:15.059
 but that's just what it's supposed to do 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.890
 only one club, therefore, is enough 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.570
 yes actually synonymous of the size yes the 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.609
 there are also since the new standard 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.260
 assortment change I got mine now 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.060
 little time left with the review 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.189
 because I have such a little difficulty 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.869
 I did with this lamp but I wanted 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.880
 do not judge too hastily 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:33.840
 so it's true that I actually 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.670
 always for over half a year 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.829
 This food stand is at home products 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.719
 wear on the near and also very 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.910
 I 'm happy with that before 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.829
 also the normal, slightly larger one 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.809
 Essens lamp used and that has everything 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.879
 I worked very well 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.440
 very much looking forward to this new mini lamp 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.660
 because she promises that she really 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.760
 It takes only ten seconds to do that 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.739
 harden and that would be great of course 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.570
 missed the scream all that much 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.399
 would go faster with this whole 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.590
 manicure things and I do not want 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.480
 but I would say that 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.549
 I've got the hang of it by now 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.930
 the essens james products because they just 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.939
 used for so long 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.970
 and now we come to this one 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:14.640
 new small lamp an innovation 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.530
 should be and we will see now 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.330
 if she is, then I was completely lost 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.860
 normal with that I would be my first 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.420
 times before areas so first the 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.330
 push back the cuticle 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.610
 then the plumber comes with it 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.100
 once drizzled on the cotton pad and 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:32.130
 then all over the whole of everything 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.689
 just the handset and then taken off 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.430
 some we continue with the primer 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:38.400
 with it on the whole nail 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.659
 distributed but do not take too much 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.100
 because he is actually meant for that 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.360
 that the nail is a bit different 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.040
 skin becomes and if you are there very much 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.060
 Sensitive until then I want to be there like that 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.470
 be careful 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.570
 when I get that way we already 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.970
 the first one goes and that's the often 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.100
 Shell once proved this right 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.530
 generous so a bit thicker quiet 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.899
 on the whole nail and then go 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.850
 it already under this lamp for ten 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.799
 seconds if the long run through 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.899
 is then comes for me directly from the 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.850
 next step with these fans game 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:08.129
 So he will not come first with me 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.780
 Klenner and nail polish on these two 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:11.910
 I save myself steps but with me 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.040
 Directly this principle comes also that 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.170
 Do not need to say that so thick now 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.910
 Layer japan a bit 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.190
 be thinner but still plentiful 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.200
 and above all things here too 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.060
 you should never seal that 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.950
 forget aspect is always that tip 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.120
 differentiate itself and then comes the 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.250
 down and that's what you want, of course 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.440
 not afterwards , the whole thing goes again 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.810
 takes under these ten seconds long 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.190
 then just glitter again takes that 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.640
 this whole switzerland is still there 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:40.440
 it is off and then the nail would be 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.900
 Practical but it was always like that 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:45.090
 if I have used this mini for a long time 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.830
 that after this last step after 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.230
 I saw this little one again 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:50.940
 I still feel that way 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.519
 have the money is not quite 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.890
 but it is still dry 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:57.599
 so a bit bit pappig on it 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.129
 So this protective layer testifies 

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:00.780
 completely removed but it is 

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:02.430
 just not as nice as it is liquid 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.620
 actually always is when I have this 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.510
 biggest weapon used but it is still 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.890
 so slightly sticky and that 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.599
 is actually showing for me that 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.099
 this little lamp is not 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:13.950
 has done in these ten seconds 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:15.720
 to dry the whole budget by what 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.940
 I always have with this little one 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:20.129
 mini lamp is that i am this extreme 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:23.430
 So, together, I really pulls 

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:26.010
 always with a reasonably thick 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.299
 layer works his draws here 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.030
 Comes now, so to speak that means I have 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:32.380
 on some nails here almost even 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:34.960
 no gel or only 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:37.540
 a very tiny tiny thin one 

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:38.650
 layer and I have that too with the 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.450
 Great country if I have the problem 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:42.070
 obviously the technology is simple 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.290
 not so far that in 10 seconds 

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:46.180
 can dry a ge simply so 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:49.000
 Unfortunately I have to buy this 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:51.490
 so advise against small mini LED lamp 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.620
 I do not have any of you yet 

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:55.330
 heard that it was super good somehow 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:57.580
 this little maddie would have worked 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:04:00.000
 But lamp I am very very 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:02.770
 happy with this whole food 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.870
 power system so if we still somewhere 

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:06.190
 this older one is long, yes 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:07.630
 actually already pretty 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:11.020
 small is now in contrast to others 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:12.070
 nail keel lamps they bought you 

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:13.810
 In any case, so I have now 

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:15.130
 seen that cosmetics from leaves you to 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:16.720
 example now leads a bit 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:18.670
 and maybe you have the opportunity 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.410
 you do not want to fetch them anymore 

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:22.600
 get it now would be too tragic 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:24.250
 because all this talk of essens 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.690
 work very well with everyone 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:27.910
 for example, other roux fouling will be 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:29.260
 which one knows from the nail salon 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:31.810
 So with every other lamp 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:33.310
 This throat work on course one 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:35.320
 kick as I do with this something 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:37.090
 bigger lamp relatively fast now 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:39.340
 my nails always make it is now 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:41.860
 namely, so that I always quite first 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:44.320
 then the new steps are normal 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:47.080
 the first g layer on it only 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:49.180
 a finger-to-keep here for about 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:50.830
 5 seconds and then first with the 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:52.900
 next keep on waking up as always 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:54.490
 only one finger in 55 seconds 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:56.440
 hold and only when all four fingers 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:58.360
 with this fell on james on it 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:00.370
 it was all painted again 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:02.380
 Together they were eating this country 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:04.180
 ready for this whole one 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:06.580
 minute and then they are complete 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:10.000
 dried through and the whole thing repeated 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:11.350
 I just play along again though that 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.850
 works very well that works too 

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:14.920
 everything much faster and thereby 

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:16.090
 It also saves me a lot of time and me 

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:18.130
 understood how on all things on the 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:19.600
 trouble with this little meal miniland 

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:21.130
 I have this path for myself now 

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:22.750
 found and it works very well 

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:24.850
 good , but I can downstairs again 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:26.410
 link to my video where I have one 

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:28.930
 very detailed about a very 

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:31.990
 detailed tutorial have made 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:34.030
 that explains again very slow 

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:36.040
 very detailed step by step how 

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:37.570
 to make this wrap and someone 

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:40.150
 just step by step this g 

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:40.770
 applies and clean works so look 

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:41.910
 you 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:43.379
 if you look for this whole system 

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:45.030
 interested and maybe too 

00:05:43.379 --> 00:05:47.009
 already at home and would like to test 

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:48.629
 and then I link below again 

00:05:47.009 --> 00:05:50.819
 it was my last two videos 

00:05:48.629 --> 00:05:53.220
 once the unboxing one of the darlings 

00:05:50.819 --> 00:05:56.430
 box and once the full brown to 

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:58.259
 Photo shoot for tm high fog in jade 

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:59.460
 already fall in my videos if you 

00:05:58.259 --> 00:06:03.199
 now also a bit of time almost 

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:03.199
 non-stop next time
