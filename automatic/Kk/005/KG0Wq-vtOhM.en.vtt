00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.900
 hello I am omar berrÃ­o marvel rio dotcom 

00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:08.140
 today we continue in the series of myths 

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:09.990
 for PC gamers and myth number 2 is yes 

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:12.490
 effectively the dual channel memory 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.950
 greatly increases the performance of our 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:18.339
 ram we're going to see what the 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:20.949
 dual channel and the multi channels in 

00:00:18.339 --> 00:00:24.179
 general and we will look to see if the myth 

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:24.179
 Is true or false 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.449
 ok then first of all I'm going to 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.530
 explain a bit what is that of the dual 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:34.670
 channel triple cam in which channel 

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:37.370
 basically it 's technology 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:39.800
 multichannel is 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.949
 an invention that allows the 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:45.050
 memory controller have different 

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:47.660
 ways to communicate at the time in 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.670
 parallel with each of the modules of 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:52.460
 memory that are in the system the 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:55.909
 ram memory then the duo channel no 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:58.399
 it's more than passing from a bandwidth 

00:00:55.909 --> 00:01:00.829
 64 bit for the transfer of 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:05.420
 data between memory and controller 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:10.280
 memory to a 128 bit 196 bit in the 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:13.280
 case of triple channel and 256 bits in the 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:15.530
 memory case which chanel which is the 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:20.990
 that use the extreme intel the 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:23.679
 intel xeon from lg to 13 in 2011 sorry and 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:27.380
 2011 3 what is the 4 then 

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:30.830
 basically it is to expand the channel by 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:33.860
 where the data travels or using 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:36.860
 several channels in parallel then the 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:39.590
 myth is that if one does not use the 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.360
 memories in an organization such 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.950
 way that the dual channel or the 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.899
 triple channel 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:49.159
 which channel will lose a lot 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:51.560
 ok performance the myth has a lot of 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:55.360
 true to the extent that in extending that 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:57.280
 bandwidth if it improves performance 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.430
 especially in applications that are 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:02.830
 intensive in the use of memory but 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:06.040
 really the performance improvement is not 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:08.649
 very significant is something that on the day 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:10.869
 to day or even in video games do not know 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:12.900
 will notice because they are increments of 5 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:17.099
 or 10 percent 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:20.579
 suddenly they are 25-30 with a memory which 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:24.510
 chanel in an integral and seven of the 

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:26.939
 last I do not know 59 60 x or an armchair is 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.939
 five of these then really the 

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:34.530
 increase in the memory part does not 

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:37.590
 is very high because really the channel 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.959
 where the data travels between memory 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.849
 and memory controller is not something that 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:44.269
 is given generating a lot of bottleneck 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:47.400
 in the current teams then 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:49.680
 expand it simply is you have a car 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.450
 walking at a certain speed does not matter if 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.459
 you already have a large highway if you put it 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:57.990
 bigger will give almost the same 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:03:01.970
 then personally 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:06.000
 I think that sometimes it is more profitable and more 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:10.230
 convenient to have a single memory 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:14.070
 8 gb memory bar in one 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:17.280
 motherboard if you have the hope of 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:19.050
 less than 2 years go increasing that 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.930
 amount of memory for example in a 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:25.170
 chips an intel 77 chipset or a 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:27.710
 aemead 990 chipset you have four 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:31.470
 memory slots if you want to use the 

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:36.180
 dual channel you need with 8 gigs of 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:38.190
 ram you need 2 bars of 4 gb in each 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:42.090
 one of the channels to distribute the 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:44.200
 charges but that means if your 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:48.590
 do you want to continue 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:52.099
 making ram memory improvements you're going to 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:54.560
 limit these two slots to only bars 

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:56.450
 of 4 gigabytes if you had 8 bars 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:59.930
 gigas you could reach your maximum that are 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:03.760
 32 gb in the case of using bars 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:06.470
 you could get maximum to 16 gb then 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:10.250
 and I personally believe and equipment 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:13.010
 that we assemble here we always do that 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:15.799
 recommendation if there is hope or o 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:17.930
 you want in the near future to 

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:20.389
 increase the memory to the maximum of the 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:23.270
 motherboard let go of the dual 

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:26.510
 channel and put memories the largest 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:29.180
 possible if from 8 GB and an 8 GB stick 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:31.370
 leave it there in such a way that when 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:33.680
 put the 16 GB to activate the dual 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:35.750
 channel and we still have two slots 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:40.250
 available to reach 32 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:42.250
 then the myth is true to the extent 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:45.830
 which increases performance but is not 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:48.320
 very big you can see there I'm going to 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:51.520
 leave some links about good are 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:55.910
 articles a little old there is one of 2011 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:58.950
 of twic town where they evaluate the difference 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:05:01.680
 between dual channel and quad channel 

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:03.720
 good only in the in software sandra 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:06.690
 you can see you can appreciate a little 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:11.040
 the improvement in that but if you get to see 

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:14.820
 the same in the same benchmark 

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:17.520
 they are running there in more applications 

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:19.800
 let's say from real life or more 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:23.610
 related to video games like the 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:26.370
 tri dimarco or applications do not know other 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:28.830
 applications the profit is not much 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:29.700
 especially in the games part the 

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:32.010
 RAM 

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:35.250
 it falls into the background and who is more 

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:39.060
 important is the gpu so the margin 

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:41.790
 of gain is even less than 3 or 5% 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:43.910
 then I leave you there the links of 

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:47.030
 wikipedia of 

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:49.310
 some reviews that appear where there 

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:52.000
 a comparison is single channel 

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:55.730
 dual channel triple channel which 

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:58.550
 I hope you find the information useful 

00:05:55.730 --> 00:06:01.160
 Thank you very much for supporting this new 

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:02.840
 series I hope you keep leaving me others 

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:05.150
 myths we already have out there other 

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:08.230
 comments that we have left for the 

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:11.720
 next chapters but leave me others 

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:15.000
 tell me what you think of the dual channel and if 

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:17.340
 they would be willing to sacrifice it 

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.730
 as I am saying here suddenly 

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:23.880
 a future expansion I hope you have them 

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:26.840
 liked the video subscribe to the channel and 

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:26.840
 good see you next
