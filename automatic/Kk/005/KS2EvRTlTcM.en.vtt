00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 hi my name is michael lame wanted 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:07.020
 you make a short video about chevrolet 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:10.559
 aveo 2010 release 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:13.590
 move 14 sedan wanted to say 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:16.680
 information so how do i work on it four 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.539
 years I know about the car ride all the pros and 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.570
 minuses 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:22.980
 First I tell you about the cons 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.970
 for some reason constantly lights up 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.800
 see check error on dashboard 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:30.210
 the check was constantly put away 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.759
 lights up become a bad wiesenthal 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.829
 it is not clear what reason 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:36.660
 it means there is a very uncomfortable signal and 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.730
 signal notice this one 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.280
 little socket that's on the steering wheel when 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.379
 it is not always necessary to signal an emergency 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.110
 you find not always groping and this 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:48.180
 signal steering in general is nothing so then 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.070
 some kind of weird fat little bit too 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.600
 on its steering wheel so fat at first 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.180
 more steps then acceleration is rubbed 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.070
 and it turns out so very smooth on 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.899
 signals of course here are these signals 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.789
 very uncomfortable very convenient signals 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.920
 little boy he is also the smallest thing 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:05.189
 or uncomfortable signals 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.110
 really don't like it even look again 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:10.500
 such a minus 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:13.229
 the panel here the panel constantly interferes with the leg 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.479
 let us interfere with the leg even if back 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.750
 rig you not you should n't push 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:21.180
 on the pedal and if it gets in the way 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.850
 this panel is kind of incomprehensible here 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:27.060
 on the other side there is the same 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:31.409
 uncomfortable panel means still here such 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:34.979
 problem problem we have here yet 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:38.520
 friends and I on the work place 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:40.979
 you live here such nonsense is see 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.439
 take including radio including radio 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.689
 switch another radio station 

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:47.399
 does not catch see what he writes that is necessary 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:51.829
 wait for two three minutes maybe later 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:55.399
 hissing some kind of problem with radio 2 

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:57.899
 also we wait for you wait for you wait for you 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:02:00.180
 do not switch I spend what nonsense 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:02.219
 for some reason I had yes this one too 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.010
 the same nonsense was at all Arishka such 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:06.170
 here's nonsense 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:08.090
 Click here is a business inform well, sort of 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:11.080
 immediately takes the rest for some reason the waves and 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.080
 to no problem with that 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:17.000
 such a problem Valjevo is well, instead of 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.950
 front of course here a bit if back 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.800
 passengers in front closely if 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.450
 front aids and sits back and behind here 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.870
 tight places ate little 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:29.090
 so the panel from the beginning to creak 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:32.030
 you can not hear the panel creaks 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.710
 why some crunch on idle stand 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:37.160
 squeezed the grip when everything is fine a 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:40.160
 when you stand so simple cruz some 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:44.150
 incomprehensible here such minuses well pluses 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:46.040
 this car what does it mean little 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.800
 there is a gasoline economy car then 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.480
 there is 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:54.470
 well done well done gasoline ride a lot on 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:56.780
 it gasoline goes a little that's the problem of these 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:59.600
 machine cork expansion tank yet 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:02.060
 there is no boil then you change the cork 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:04.310
 and everything is fine, everything is leaving the problem 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:08.200
 disappears so often the radiator flows on 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:12.290
 these radiators often leaks 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:14.480
 this car has already driven 110 here 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:17.540
 changed the odometer device we changed 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:19.400
 so 80 is written but no problems with 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:22.970
 all the key was once broken 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:25.040
 the road was that the clutch hose broke 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:27.350
 liquid spilled out and stopped turning on 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.470
 transfer sypl stopped work came 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:32.209
 here service to get to 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:35.720
 without clutch a new principle drove so 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:36.410
 reliable car reliable machine I could 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:40.130
 pendants 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:41.180
 the suspension is also not killed only 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:47.580
 what's on the track 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:49.980
 over when there goes a hundred speeds 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:53.280
 car bad road holding car easy 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:55.800
 a little high narrow I throw 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.480
 here and there but 150 140 on not already 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:01.170
 scary ride actually because 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:03.660
 that you do not know what to expect therefore this 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:08.670
 here is the working speed on the highway is this 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:10.860
 machine 110 110 120-125 like this 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:13.500
 so car prices are safe when you go then 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:15.470
 140 turnover is already there on 4000 on the highway 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:19.799
 preschoolers don't like this 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:22.320
 my home car food 150 160 cars 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:23.460
 those madzhentis too old machine 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.670
 4-speed 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:32.000
 here it is less than 3 2 800 revolutions 

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:35.250
 140 bios food up to 700 rpm 153 3g 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.530
 This could be someone useful. 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:41.180
 video useful to someone removed for you 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:41.180
 video thank you for your attention
