00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:18.190 
you like them very very well done but we

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:21.510 
you like them very very well done but we
recommend<00:01:18.490> that<00:01:18.730> you<00:01:18.850> cook<00:01:19.060> them<00:01:20.010> medium<00:01:21.010> or

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 
recommend that you cook them medium or

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.720 
recommend that you cook them medium or
rare<00:01:21.910> even<00:01:23.040> because<00:01:24.040> most<00:01:24.250> of<00:01:24.370> our<00:01:24.490> products

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:24.730 
rare even because most of our products

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:26.700 
rare even because most of our products
are<00:01:24.940> so<00:01:25.060> low<00:01:25.270> in<00:01:25.420> fat<00:01:25.750> so<00:01:26.440> I'm<00:01:26.500> going<00:01:26.620> to<00:01:26.650> put

are so low in fat so I'm going to put

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:29.220 
are so low in fat so I'm going to put
the<00:01:26.920> sausages<00:01:27.400> on<00:01:27.580> first<00:01:27.940> and<00:01:28.300> because

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:29.230 
the sausages on first and because

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
the sausages on first and because
they're<00:01:29.380> going<00:01:29.500> to<00:01:29.590> take<00:01:29.710> the<00:01:29.860> longest<00:01:30.070> to

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:33.480 
they're going to take the longest to
cook<00:01:31.230> so<00:01:32.230> when<00:01:32.380> your<00:01:32.530> sausage<00:01:32.830> is<00:01:32.980> a<00:01:33.010> thing<00:01:33.250> on
