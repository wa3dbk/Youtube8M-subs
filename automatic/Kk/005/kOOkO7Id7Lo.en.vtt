boiling when I read the description of

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.839 
boiling when I read the description of
aftermath<00:02:19.170> so<00:02:19.500> that's<00:02:19.709> my<00:02:19.890> expectation<00:02:20.220> of<00:02:20.730> a

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:20.849 
aftermath so that's my expectation of a

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:24.780 
new game mode the details are scant so
that<00:02:23.489> allows<00:02:23.849> for<00:02:24.330> some<00:02:24.450> spec

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
that allows for some spec

that allows for some spec
halation<00:02:25.209> that's<00:02:25.659> why<00:02:25.870> I'm<00:02:26.140> turning<00:02:26.860> it<00:02:27.189> over

fifth and final expansion pack was
revealed<00:03:50.680> to<00:03:50.859> follow<00:03:51.159> aftermath<00:03:51.849> anyways<00:03:52.659> now

00:03:53.369 --> 00:03:53.379 
revealed to follow aftermath anyways now

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:55.170 
revealed to follow aftermath anyways now
it<00:03:53.680> doesn't<00:03:54.220> seem<00:03:54.549> like<00:03:54.849> they're

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 
it doesn't seem like they're

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:57.149 
it doesn't seem like they're
spotlighting<00:03:55.780> any<00:03:55.930> new<00:03:56.139> weapons<00:03:56.590> as<00:03:56.799> they

00:03:57.149 --> 00:03:57.159 
spotlighting any new weapons as they

00:03:57.159 --> 00:03:59.909 
spotlighting any new weapons as they
were<00:03:57.269> recently<00:03:58.269> but<00:03:58.989> I<00:03:59.019> assume<00:03:59.440> they've<00:03:59.650> still

00:03:59.909 --> 00:03:59.919 
were recently but I assume they've still

00:03:59.919 --> 00:04:02.039 
were recently but I assume they've still
got<00:04:00.129> some<00:04:00.340> plan<00:04:00.579> for<00:04:00.790> aftermath<00:04:01.209> taking<00:04:01.840> a

00:04:02.039 --> 00:04:02.049 
got some plan for aftermath taking a

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:04.770 
got some plan for aftermath taking a
guess<00:04:02.379> at<00:04:02.680> a<00:04:02.739> type<00:04:03.340> of<00:04:03.370> weapon<00:04:04.000> would<00:04:04.599> be

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:04.780 
guess at a type of weapon would be

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:06.599 
guess at a type of weapon would be
taking<00:04:05.169> a<00:04:05.260> shot<00:04:05.470> in<00:04:05.620> the<00:04:05.650> dark<00:04:05.769> it's<00:04:06.220> stupid

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:06.609 
taking a shot in the dark it's stupid

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:08.699 
taking a shot in the dark it's stupid
against<00:04:06.879> with<00:04:07.060> that<00:04:07.209> much<00:04:07.629> specificity<00:04:08.049> I

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:08.709 
against with that much specificity I

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:11.219 
against with that much specificity I
would<00:04:09.069> however<00:04:09.549> like<00:04:10.090> to<00:04:10.150> take<00:04:10.510> a<00:04:10.540> guess<00:04:10.930> and

00:04:11.219 --> 00:04:11.229 
would however like to take a guess and

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:13.439 
would however like to take a guess and
say<00:04:11.439> if<00:04:11.500> there<00:04:11.769> will<00:04:11.919> be<00:04:11.979> any<00:04:12.250> new<00:04:12.489> attachments

00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:13.449 
say if there will be any new attachments

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:15.569 
say if there will be any new attachments
joining<00:04:13.959> the<00:04:14.079> battlefield<00:04:14.650> in<00:04:14.949> aftermath

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:15.579 
joining the battlefield in aftermath

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:17.099 
joining the battlefield in aftermath
they<00:04:15.879> would<00:04:16.000> likely<00:04:16.209> be<00:04:16.510> done<00:04:16.720> in<00:04:16.840> the<00:04:16.870> same

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:17.109 
they would likely be done in the same

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:20.219 
they would likely be done in the same
form<00:04:17.409> as<00:04:17.500> the<00:04:17.560> vehicles<00:04:18.099> combat<00:04:19.030> modified<00:04:19.599> for

00:04:20.219 --> 00:04:20.229 
form as the vehicles combat modified for

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:22.290 
form as the vehicles combat modified for
the<00:04:20.349> devastating<00:04:20.979> war<00:04:21.250> zone<00:04:21.489> and<00:04:21.699> it's

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.300 
the devastating war zone and it's

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.060 
the devastating war zone and it's
possible<00:04:22.810> we<00:04:23.020> could<00:04:23.050> see<00:04:23.289> the<00:04:23.380> same<00:04:23.590> thing<00:04:23.860> for

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.070 
possible we could see the same thing for

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:26.790 
possible we could see the same thing for
weapons<00:04:24.460> but<00:04:24.729> I<00:04:24.759> can't<00:04:25.090> really<00:04:25.300> use<00:04:26.080> any<00:04:26.259> ideas

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:26.800 
weapons but I can't really use any ideas

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.770 
weapons but I can't really use any ideas
of<00:04:26.830> that<00:04:27.220> so<00:04:27.550> once<00:04:27.909> again<00:04:28.060> I'm<00:04:28.389> handing<00:04:28.690> it

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:28.780 
of that so once again I'm handing it

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:30.990 
of that so once again I'm handing it
over<00:04:28.840> to<00:04:28.990> you<00:04:29.229> what<00:04:29.740> new<00:04:29.979> weapons<00:04:30.430> and<00:04:30.669> or
