00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.449 

I<00:02:14.299> was<00:02:15.299> looking<00:02:15.540> at<00:02:15.629> this<00:02:15.750> car<00:02:16.019> it<00:02:16.950> just<00:02:17.010> seems

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
I was looking at this car it just seems

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:18.800 
I was looking at this car it just seems
different<00:02:17.640> from<00:02:18.000> a<00:02:18.120> lot<00:02:18.150> of<00:02:18.330> the<00:02:18.450> other<00:02:18.599> ones

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810

different from a lot of the other ones
that<00:02:18.959> I<00:02:19.019> do<00:02:19.140> I<00:02:19.620> guess<00:02:20.159> it's<00:02:20.370> probably<00:02:20.549> because

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
that I do I guess it's probably because

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.000 
that I do I guess it's probably because
there's<00:02:21.150> no<00:02:21.299> front<00:02:21.599> plate<00:02:21.659> on<00:02:21.989> it<00:02:22.170> but<00:02:22.409> just

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.260 
there's no front plate on it but just
had<00:02:23.159> a<00:02:23.190> different<00:02:23.580> look<00:02:23.760> up<00:02:23.940> front<00:02:24.180> to<00:02:24.390> it

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:26.270 
had a different look up front to it

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:28.310 
had a different look up front to it
because<00:02:27.270> there's<00:02:27.480> so<00:02:27.630> much<00:02:27.750> the<00:02:28.020> all<00:02:28.170> the

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
because there's so much the all the

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:29.840 
because there's so much the all the
black<00:02:28.560> and<00:02:28.800> then<00:02:28.890> it's<00:02:29.010> just<00:02:29.160> that<00:02:29.370> that

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850
