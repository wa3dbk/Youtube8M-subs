00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:11.630
 Nine people I am there we put all the way 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:14.690
 to a new video on a channel man 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:15.860
 can play with a very mci without a play 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:18.410
 shit you probably have 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:19.880
 noticed that is in any case and 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:21.710
 is such a few new things today 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.820
 rausgesucht who sits by fine then 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:24.590
 I want to do that and I want it that way 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:25.130
 imagine what the then just as everything 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:27.440
 can 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:30.109
 First we have a cover of the tank 

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:33.890
 is new or would actually come too 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:36.110
 from battlefield 21 42 of equipment from 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:38.510
 Damage to the armor is everything 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.830
 same as normal tank only the 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:41.989
 Control is quite different therefore 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:43.729
 of course it can float in 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:45.290
 all directions move accordingly 

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:46.370
 left normal tank can she can has 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:48.170
 yes was left to drive that is ok 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.049
 he can not do that 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.220
 he can also turn it super fast 

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:54.710
 Work here from a disadvantage and indeed 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:56.269
 clear that panzer tube does not move and 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.559
 also the protected ones you have 

00:00:56.269 --> 00:00:59.839
 You can not move them anymore 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:02.089
 the control thereby somewhat unfamiliar 

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:05.000
 Everything starts at the beginning 

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:06.590
 super fast and you have just hit the 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.180
 23 not so much after 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.640
 general may pull sometimes 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.930
 a bit difficult but if you go for 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.100
 a good panzer riders colleagues as 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:15.859
 In doing so, the US took over business 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:18.289
 then it is already completely andes part 

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:21.829
 then there is a snowboard instead 

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:23.750
 a snowmobile and damn is the 

00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:25.219
 fast, it all has such a tempo on it 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.289
 I think there are no vehicles 

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:28.670
 the four which only slightly so fast 

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:31.130
 put it there with kist not so fast 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.289
 like this snowmobile I usually 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.950
 normal transport vehicle for two 

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:36.229
 people 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.030
 otherwise it will be here as a metal storm 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:40.189
 That's what I call it 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:44.359
 much too strong protected 

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:46.670
 This thing shoots 15 balls at once 

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:48.649
 in a volley ball this make a 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.999
 damage of 25 and also 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:53.569
 actually a little splash 

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:55.969
 have old age that's sick you made 

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:58.280
 with one hit wonder daily distance from 

00:01:55.969 --> 00:02:00.560
 ethernet which immediately dumps the thing 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.450
 is much too strong so listen, too 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.149
 cell phones away the only thing not stop 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.109
 applies and armor but the thing is okay 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:09.200
 it is now protected 

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:11.580
 but it has so much power with it 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.320
 As I said just finished everything 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.910
 then there are two more battle 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:17.100
 pickups and we are not out yet 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:20.220
 the trailer knows railgun the 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:22.530
 Does 150 damage have a by-election time 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.060
 from 25 seconds so that must also like 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.520
 she just normal sniper after every shot 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.480
 just once again, in fact, even here 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.330
 completely reload 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.970
 It takes 25 seconds to shoot eight 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:35.370
 with and you have from the shot more or less 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.660
 keep on pushing on the goal 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.610
 had to wait a little while to shoot 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.140
 and stay tuned for the ball 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.690
 immediately with the opponent thus the fire rate 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.190
 The cow's speed is 3200 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.980
 meter per second long I give immediately 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.660
 since that has no bull drop and how 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.060
 said of 50 damage you can do that too 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.440
 against helix against transports 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:56.340
 for example, li makes a loss 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:58.920
 from 40 so the thing is not synonymous 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.900
 bad and second at the pick up 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.580
 we already know from the trailer the mk 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.920
 how's that kind of dragons? 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:07.440
 deep direction that you have the pad 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.790
 with which one can control a device 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.920
 before the control itself it's just like 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:14.100
 so many a colleague to the side one has so 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:16.650
 this thermal view but it also has it 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:19.920
 a fixed flight duration it can do so 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:21.630
 about a maximum of 60 seconds flying and 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.459
 you can ring your opponent and you have it 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:25.440
 a minigun and there you can just quasi 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:27.300
 why of hedi on it all the team 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.080
 has power player control and one 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:29.280
 bit look for this too 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.690
 but if you then the 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.910
 you can really get out of there 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:35.580
 very nice kates chrysler right 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:37.080
 Of course, today, of course, street go today 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:40.260
 or sting with complete shot 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:42.000
 before and road kids go then too 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:44.550
 there is also a new tower 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.610
 for the accessories category as well 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:49.739
 laser day sorry amplifiers so in there 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:52.080
 this tower spotted opponent 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:54.360
 automatically but probably only on the 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:56.010
 minimap and it's actually rather 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.239
 interesting for weapons where you can not 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:59.250
 readers can contact if I for example 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:00.480
 pioneer game with the ak 15 is yes 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:03.570
 no laser on it and then I just take 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:05.670
 the thing if i fall doodle opponent 

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:08.010
 I just have to scoff at this 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:09.299
 cod and that maybe once 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:10.920
 take over and hurt it does yes 

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:13.739
 actually not least there is still 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:16.350
 a new gadget for the moment all 

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:18.810
 class and it goes in the direction of 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:21.190
 the field of battle to hard physical the cow 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:24.250
 can with which one was the wish 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:25.870
 fake position at the opponent's radar 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:28.510
 So give the opponents have on their 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:30.160
 mini map which arrows from opponents 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:32.620
 helped her visual display emanating 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:34.060
 but they do not agree so the area 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:34.630
 where because the mini map shows that 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:36.190
 opponent 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:40.480
 next stop no one there is so seen 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:42.700
 fake positions further so that's the 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:43.960
 with these videos will be pretty cool 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:45.640
 if this video is a thumbs up 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:47.740
 could give and is really time 

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:50.530
 still determines more videos to final 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:52.750
 stand comes no premier still likes 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:53.650
 City wants to buy a link 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:58.410
 is in the description 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:58.410
 you can see a next video
