00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.660
 peggy 18 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.980
 with grand thef auto 5 rockstar has 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.060
 tried to reinvent different 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.039
 ways the open world game 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:22.300
 The game world is wonderful 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:22.300
 gigantic and varied 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:27.860
 a satirical and immense version of 

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:31.190
 modern south california 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:34.550
 with seas and mountains luxury shops and 

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:37.100
 shopping centers urban decadence and 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:40.570
 virgin nature beaches and areas 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:44.000
 isolated the sublime and the ridiculous 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:46.100
 greed and hypocrisy you tell me explain 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.440
 what you want I'll return it and tree 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.440
 explain why i can not be one 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:02.680
 for the first time the game does not have 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:04.839
 a single aspiring hero but with 3 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.820
 maikel in his day a successful robber of 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:08.970
 banks and today a not so successful father of 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:08.970
 family 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:18.690
 franklin a street hustler 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.690
 convinced to be surrounded by imbeciles 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:27.659
 and then this truce 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.659
 The less we say of him, the better 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.830
 thanks to the three protagonists 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:36.260
 they remodel both the narration in a 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:38.870
 interlaced history as the structure 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:40.790
 of individual missions 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:43.700
 players can alternate between 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:46.780
 perspectives and move on from an instant 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.780
 dizzying to another 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.330
 I knew 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.190
 and this allows missions 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.670
 acquire new levels of diversity and 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:01.670
 intensity 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:10.050
 outside of a mission the use of three 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:13.980
 protagonists also allows adding a 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:16.230
 touch of voyeurism since you can 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:20.360
 find out when you want in 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.360
 that your new friends have been involved 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.120
 do not 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:41.569
 the world is not only huge but it is 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:43.940
 full of things to see and do 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:48.050
 customize cars 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:52.370
 pilot aircraft buy clothes to do 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:55.910
 sport go in search of the nirvana to dive 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:59.000
 in the ocean watching animals hunt and 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:00.770
 to be caught rare types to watch over or 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.260
 know tomorrow 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:05.260
 collect rewards and much more 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.020
 good 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:17.459
 There has also been a lot of emphasis on 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:19.319
 game mechanics so that all your 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:22.040
 aspects are so fun and fluid 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:22.040
 as broad 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:27.720
 everything either drive and shoot 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:33.380
 or tennis and riding a bike results 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:35.600
 fun and interactive 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:37.790
 however in addition to engaging in leisure 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:39.980
 people should also address their 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:44.260
 business for all your pretensions 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:44.260
 These men are dangerous thieves 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:54.099
 and to survive they have to plan 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:59.019
 and perform a series of blows each 

00:03:54.099 --> 00:04:01.330
 more audacious are the players 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:05.069
 they plan for themselves and then they decide 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:05.069
 how and with whom to execute them 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:14.150
 I 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:24.820
 and distribute the loot you decide in what 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:29.670
 spend the money from investments 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:29.670
 sensible like tattoos and fast cars 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:35.340
 to risky projects like actions and 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:37.880
 properties in the saints 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:41.870
 and there's also grand thef auto online 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:41.870
 that we will show shortly
