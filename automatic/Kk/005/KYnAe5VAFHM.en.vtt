 120 gb SSD 

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:16.080
 it's been a while now that I am 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.760
 have tested a ssd 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.949
 and because i have another systems for 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.839
 my system is needed that is the 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.150
 perfect opportunity for another 

00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:25.529
 ssd review of this samsung drive 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.900
 is probably very well known 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.949
 the attractive pricing in the 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.079
 box is the 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.180
 Installation instructions of the warranty 

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:35.220

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.559
 instructions are here too 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.960
 sticker and last but not least the ssd 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.899
 even today it's obviously singing 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.820
 the 120gb version of this samsung ssd 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.559
 840 usd 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.100
 this solid state drive uses the 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:53.010
 samsung nx 400 megawatt controller and 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.449
 makes of the tlz ockel 19 nanometers 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.559
 Nand technology use 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.899
 it is this 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.390
 of course, a sata 6 gbit 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.280
 only secondary drive and the following 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.230
 readers and writers are here too 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.690
 expect 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:09.990
 Read 540 megabytes per second and 410 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:12.960
 megawatt musicians describe 256 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.060
 megawatt lpddr2 plays used here 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.040
 with ssds the power consumption is always like that 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.290
 low that no longer 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.970
 worth mentioning is this run recognized 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.689
 at most a little over two watts 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.140
 consume 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:27.540
 The samsung ssd 840 ev is a real one 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.780
 nice ssd the case is made of metal 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.979
 And also the paint is very fine 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.810
 Direct cover is also off 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.360
 metal and there is also the 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.790
 label at this ssd as before 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.409
 said it will be whopping six kit 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.420
 music used at the interface 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:45.299
 But this is not nine millimeters 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.880
 thick ssds are seven millimeters and 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.530
 that means they are because what is good that 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.840
 They do so in very slim notebooks 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:55.520
 but we can see how 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.520
 fast this ssd is really now 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:56.739
 the samsung ssd 840 has evo 120 gb ssd 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.599
 to offer very good performance 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:00.910
 especially now that the ssd prices 

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:03.459
 Low ones could be such a drive 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:05.590
 The ideal PC upgrade to adjust 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:07.420
 and you would certainly not 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.670
 make mistakes when going to this 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.020
 samsung runs grabs with all 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:13.450
 the other ssds I have so far 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:15.190
 tested and had it this 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:17.800
 the best of it all 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:19.840
 i only have 120 gigawatt drives for 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:23.200
 my systems used and compared 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:26.769
 to the other 120 gb ssds has this one 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:29.170
 samsung ssd 840 ev the best performance 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:31.269
 but still the least 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:33.340
 but if it is around today 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:35.110
 ssds does not really work then 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.580
 big performance difference available 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:38.140
 unless you reach for a right 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:40.150
 approve so to make that clear 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:42.459
 This samsung drive is all-encompassing 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.989
 better than the other ssds you 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:46.360
 but have tested the actual 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:48.549
 Performance aware of the others 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:50.769
 drives is really not that big 

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:52.360
 the quality and the simple design is 

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:53.709
 By far the best I have at one 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:55.060
 ssd have seen so far 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:57.370
 of course it's just my personal one 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:59.530
 opinion i regret this purchase 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:01.930
 no way and I'm sure that 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:03.880
 this ssd is a great addition to 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:09.010
 my main system is i would the 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:11.079
 samsung ssd 840 120 gb ssd definitely
