00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
as you can see here they have the

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.859 
as you can see here they have the
measurements<00:01:17.040> on<00:01:17.490> what<00:01:18.240> you're<00:01:18.420> supposed<00:01:18.720> to

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
much at all this once you cut this you

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.580 
much at all this once you cut this you
can<00:01:43.950> only<00:01:44.210> have<00:01:45.210> it<00:01:45.390> open<00:01:45.869> for<00:01:45.899> a<00:01:46.200> week

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
can only have it open for a week

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.950 
can only have it open for a week
otherwise<00:01:47.040> we'll<00:01:47.189> go<00:01:47.340> bad<00:01:47.579> so<00:01:48.479> you<00:01:48.540> have<00:01:48.840> to

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
otherwise we'll go bad so you have to

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.130 
otherwise we'll go bad so you have to
make<00:01:49.079> sure<00:01:49.140> that<00:01:49.590> you<00:01:49.680> feed<00:01:49.979> it<00:01:50.009> to<00:01:50.250> them<00:01:50.430> at<00:01:50.790> a

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
make sure that you feed it to them at a

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.789 
make sure that you feed it to them at a
fast<00:01:52.140> pace<00:01:52.350> and<00:01:53.600> each<00:01:54.600> one<00:01:55.229> of<00:01:55.259> these<00:01:55.439> tubes

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
fast pace and each one of these tubes

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.420 
fast pace and each one of these tubes
costs<00:01:56.640> like<00:01:57.090> five<00:01:57.540> dollars<00:01:58.049> so<00:01:58.320> it<00:01:58.770> can't<00:01:59.250> be<00:01:59.399> a

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
costs like five dollars so it can't be a

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:00.920 
costs like five dollars so it can't be a
little<00:01:59.549> pricey<00:01:59.880> like<00:02:00.270> twenty<00:02:00.570> dollars<00:02:00.899> a

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
little pricey like twenty dollars a
