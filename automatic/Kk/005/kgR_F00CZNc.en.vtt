again yeah the subject bill our fall is

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:10.360 
again yeah the subject bill our fall is
I'm<00:03:07.540> pretty<00:03:08.540> sure<00:03:08.870> it<00:03:09.260> gets<00:03:09.440> a<00:03:09.769> little<00:03:10.070> bit

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
I'm pretty sure it gets a little bit

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:16.210 
I'm pretty sure it gets a little bit
bigger<00:03:10.549> than<00:03:10.700> that<00:03:11.230> it<00:03:12.230> reaches<00:03:13.810> this<00:03:14.810> I<00:03:15.220> think

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
bigger than that it reaches this I think

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.210 
bigger than that it reaches this I think
reaches<00:03:16.670> into<00:03:16.850> the<00:03:16.940> wall<00:03:17.209> I'm<00:03:17.480> not<00:03:17.660> too<00:03:17.870> sure

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
reaches into the wall I'm not too sure

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:20.680 
reaches into the wall I'm not too sure
but<00:03:19.610> i'm<00:03:19.730> pretty<00:03:19.850> sure<00:03:19.970> i<00:03:20.090> guess<00:03:20.270> bigger<00:03:20.510> than

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
but i'm pretty sure i guess bigger than

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:23.950 
but i'm pretty sure i guess bigger than
that<00:03:21.100> okay<00:03:22.100> this<00:03:22.730> was<00:03:23.000> the<00:03:23.030> seed<00:03:23.420> i<00:03:23.450> put<00:03:23.750> in<00:03:23.900> the
