00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.869 
one of the deciding factors for me for
looking<00:00:40.710> into<00:00:40.920> it<00:00:41.160> was<00:00:41.340> because<00:00:41.700> she<00:00:41.730> had

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
looking into it was because she had

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.670 
looking into it was because she had
reached<00:00:42.120> out<00:00:42.300> to<00:00:42.480> me<00:00:42.600> about<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:42.989> show<00:00:43.200> and<00:00:43.500> so
