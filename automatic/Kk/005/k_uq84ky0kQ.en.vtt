but<00:04:04.590> they<00:04:04.739> made<00:04:04.980> the<00:04:05.099> decision<00:04:05.579> to<00:04:05.610> go<00:04:06.000> natural

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239

go<00:04:08.519> natural<00:04:09.349> there's<00:04:10.349> really<00:04:10.799> it's<00:04:11.340> quite

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 
go natural there's really it's quite

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:14.600 
go natural there's really it's quite
simple<00:04:12.000> to<00:04:12.420> go<00:04:12.959> natural<00:04:13.349> after<00:04:14.250> you've<00:04:14.400> made

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:14.610

simple to go natural after you've made
the<00:04:14.730> decision<00:04:14.760> is<00:04:15.450> to<00:04:16.109> pretty<00:04:16.320> much<00:04:16.500> saught

chop<00:04:29.910> is<00:04:30.120> self-explanatory<00:04:30.660> but<00:04:31.199> we're<00:04:31.470> going

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:31.560 
chop is self-explanatory but we're going

chop is self-explanatory but we're going
to<00:04:31.620> talk<00:04:31.800> about<00:04:31.949> transitioning<00:04:32.760> because<00:04:33.120> I

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:33.270 
to talk about transitioning because I

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:35.590 
to talk about transitioning because I
know<00:04:33.330> that<00:04:33.720> that's<00:04:33.870> what<00:04:34.139> you<00:04:34.260> guys<00:04:34.440> met<00:04:34.800> um

what<00:04:36.600> you<00:04:36.720> can<00:04:36.930> do<00:04:37.110> is<00:04:37.380> start<00:04:38.130> off<00:04:38.280> with<00:04:38.460> flexi

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:38.850 
what you can do is start off with flexi

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:41.240 
what you can do is start off with flexi
rod<00:04:39.030> sets<00:04:39.330> if<00:04:39.479> you<00:04:39.630> do<00:04:39.810> want<00:04:40.139> the<00:04:40.830> kind<00:04:41.100> of

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:44.669 
curly hair immediately do flexi rod sets

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:48.290 
curly hair immediately do flexi rod sets
do<00:04:44.970> curlformers<00:04:45.330> set<00:04:46.080> a<00:04:46.669> twist<00:04:47.669> out<00:04:47.880> straight

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:48.300 
do curlformers set a twist out straight

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:50.960 
do curlformers set a twist out straight
outs<00:04:48.479> but<00:04:48.780> I<00:04:48.930> highly<00:04:49.229> recommend<00:04:49.530> the<00:04:50.490> flexi

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:50.970 
outs but I highly recommend the flexi

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:53.420 
outs but I highly recommend the flexi
rods<00:04:51.180> or<00:04:51.389> the<00:04:51.510> curlformers<00:04:51.780> because<00:04:52.620> twist

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:53.430 
rods or the curlformers because twist

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:55.760 
rods or the curlformers because twist
outs<00:04:53.639> and<00:04:53.970> braid<00:04:54.240> outs<00:04:54.389> may<00:04:54.630> still<00:04:54.960> not<00:04:55.349> look

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:55.770 
outs and braid outs may still not look

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:59.360 
outs and braid outs may still not look
right<00:04:56.039> on<00:04:56.220> your<00:04:56.370> straight<00:04:56.699> hair<00:04:57.000> um<00:04:57.380> so<00:04:58.380> I<00:04:58.710> wish

00:04:59.360 --> 00:04:59.370 
right on your straight hair um so I wish

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:00.529 
right on your straight hair um so I wish
I<00:04:59.520> woulda<00:04:59.729> knew<00:04:59.910> this<00:05:00.060> when<00:05:00.270> I<00:05:00.330> was

00:05:00.529 --> 00:05:00.539 
I woulda knew this when I was

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:02.629 
I woulda knew this when I was
transitioning<00:05:01.310> definitely<00:05:02.310> would<00:05:02.460> have<00:05:02.490> been

00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:02.639 
transitioning definitely would have been

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:05.300 
transitioning definitely would have been
a<00:05:02.669> better<00:05:02.880> process<00:05:03.419> for<00:05:03.660> me<00:05:03.810> but<00:05:04.080> flexi<00:05:05.070> rods

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:05.310 
a better process for me but flexi rods

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:08.540 
a better process for me but flexi rods
and<00:05:05.669> curlformers<00:05:06.090> are<00:05:06.750> the<00:05:07.199> answer<00:05:07.740> and<00:05:08.070> just

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:08.550 
and curlformers are the answer and just

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:11.689 
and curlformers are the answer and just
let<00:05:08.880> it<00:05:09.000> flow<00:05:09.030> time<00:05:09.870> passed<00:05:10.380> and<00:05:10.800> eventually

00:05:11.689 --> 00:05:11.699 
let it flow time passed and eventually

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:17.830 
let it flow time passed and eventually
your<00:05:11.820> new<00:05:12.030> growth<00:05:12.360> will<00:05:12.990> be<00:05:13.169> your<00:05:13.380> full<00:05:13.650> growth

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:17.840 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:22.159 

now<00:05:18.840> as<00:05:19.020> far<00:05:19.229> as<00:05:19.349> my<00:05:19.500> pieces<00:05:19.800> go<00:05:20.220> uh<00:05:20.580> I<00:05:21.330> glue<00:05:21.960> my

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:22.169 
now as far as my pieces go uh I glue my

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:24.649 
now as far as my pieces go uh I glue my
pieces<00:05:22.440> in<00:05:22.800> I<00:05:23.070> do<00:05:23.190> not<00:05:23.639> sell<00:05:24.030> them<00:05:24.210> in<00:05:24.389> they're

00:05:24.649 --> 00:05:24.659 
pieces in I do not sell them in they're

00:05:24.659 --> 00:05:27.710 
pieces in I do not sell them in they're
not<00:05:24.840> clip-on<00:05:25.289> I<00:05:25.919> do<00:05:26.520> prefer<00:05:26.849> the<00:05:27.210> glue<00:05:27.419> it

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:27.720 
not clip-on I do prefer the glue it

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:30.170 
not clip-on I do prefer the glue it
works<00:05:27.960> for<00:05:28.260> me<00:05:28.409> I<00:05:28.680> don't<00:05:29.280> have<00:05:29.460> any<00:05:29.669> problems

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:30.180 
works for me I don't have any problems

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:31.969 
works for me I don't have any problems
with<00:05:30.270> a<00:05:30.419> glue<00:05:30.690> and<00:05:31.020> don't<00:05:31.169> have<00:05:31.349> any<00:05:31.530> problems

00:05:31.969 --> 00:05:31.979 
with a glue and don't have any problems

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:34.820 
with a glue and don't have any problems
taking<00:05:32.220> it<00:05:32.400> out<00:05:32.630> it<00:05:33.630> works<00:05:33.870> very<00:05:34.199> well<00:05:34.320> for<00:05:34.500> me

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:34.830 
taking it out it works very well for me

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:37.100 
taking it out it works very well for me
I<00:05:35.039> usually<00:05:35.460> put<00:05:35.880> four<00:05:36.210> tracks<00:05:36.539> in<00:05:36.810> the<00:05:36.900> back

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:37.110 
I usually put four tracks in the back

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:41.310 
and you know all coming up to the

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:43.670 
and you know all coming up to the

it<00:05:43.919> all<00:05:44.070> blends<00:05:44.370> in<00:05:44.580> pretty<00:05:44.789> well<00:05:45.120> and<00:05:45.440> I<00:05:46.440> will

00:05:46.939 --> 00:05:46.949 
it all blends in pretty well and I will

00:05:46.949 --> 00:05:49.550 
it all blends in pretty well and I will
do<00:05:47.130> a<00:05:47.159> tutorial<00:05:47.370> on<00:05:47.909> it<00:05:48.229> next<00:05:49.229> time<00:05:49.380> I<00:05:49.409> do

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:49.560 
do a tutorial on it next time I do

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:50.810 
do a tutorial on it next time I do
straighten<00:05:49.949> my<00:05:50.130> hair<00:05:50.340> which<00:05:50.460> will<00:05:50.610> probably

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:50.820 
straighten my hair which will probably

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:53.420 
straighten my hair which will probably
be<00:05:51.000> when<00:05:51.270> I<00:05:51.300> go<00:05:51.510> away<00:05:51.539> to<00:05:51.780> texas<00:05:52.050> in<00:05:52.500> September
