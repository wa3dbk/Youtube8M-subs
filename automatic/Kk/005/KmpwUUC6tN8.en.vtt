Yodas<00:00:00.450> up<00:00:00.599> guys<00:00:00.810> my<00:00:01.230> name<00:00:01.350> is<00:00:01.410> kal-el<00:00:01.740> welcome

00:00:02.119 --> 00:00:02.129 
Yodas up guys my name is kal-el welcome

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:03.560 
Yodas up guys my name is kal-el welcome
back<00:00:02.280> to<00:00:02.669> the<00:00:02.879> procedurally<00:00:03.540> generated

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:03.570 
back to the procedurally generated

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.249 
back to the procedurally generated
dungeon<00:00:04.470> crawler<00:00:04.799> now<00:00:05.609> I've<00:00:06.060> decided<00:00:06.540> to<00:00:06.930> make

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
dungeon crawler now I've decided to make

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:09.259 
dungeon crawler now I've decided to make
the<00:00:07.410> first<00:00:07.440> suggestion<00:00:08.010> of<00:00:08.309> moving<00:00:08.910> the<00:00:09.120> map

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
the first suggestion of moving the map

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.720 
the first suggestion of moving the map
up<00:00:09.480> here<00:00:10.110> because<00:00:10.800> I<00:00:11.130> needed<00:00:11.400> someplace<00:00:11.639> to

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
up here because I needed someplace to

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.759 
up here because I needed someplace to
put<00:00:12.090> all<00:00:12.210> this<00:00:12.300> stuff<00:00:12.360> and<00:00:12.780> if<00:00:13.469> I<00:00:13.590> actually

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
put all this stuff and if I actually

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:15.919 
put all this stuff and if I actually
keep<00:00:14.099> it<00:00:14.250> down<00:00:14.370> here<00:00:14.880> some<00:00:15.360> of<00:00:15.450> the<00:00:15.540> maps<00:00:15.690> see

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
keep it down here some of the maps see

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:17.269 
keep it down here some of the maps see
how<00:00:16.049> they're<00:00:16.199> not<00:00:16.320> actually<00:00:16.440> loaded<00:00:16.890> in<00:00:17.039> some

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
how they're not actually loaded in some

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.730 
how they're not actually loaded in some
of<00:00:17.340> the<00:00:17.430> rooms<00:00:17.460> it'll<00:00:18.449> make<00:00:18.480> it<00:00:18.750> hard<00:00:19.080> for<00:00:19.230> it

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
of the rooms it'll make it hard for it

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.890 
of the rooms it'll make it hard for it
to<00:00:20.010> actually<00:00:20.160> generate<00:00:20.609> on<00:00:21.000> to<00:00:21.330> the<00:00:21.449> map<00:00:21.689> so

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
to actually generate on to the map so

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.120 
to actually generate on to the map so
I'm<00:00:21.960> going<00:00:22.109> to<00:00:22.140> actually<00:00:22.260> be<00:00:22.439> sticking<00:00:22.920> these

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
I'm going to actually be sticking these

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.640 
I'm going to actually be sticking these
underneath<00:00:23.970> the<00:00:24.240> map<00:00:24.449> so<00:00:25.050> there<00:00:25.199> have<00:00:25.350> easy

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
underneath the map so there have easy

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.160 
underneath the map so there have easy
access<00:00:25.949> to<00:00:26.310> sticking<00:00:27.029> on<00:00:27.150> top<00:00:27.180> of<00:00:27.630> the<00:00:27.750> dungeon

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
access to sticking on top of the dungeon

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.019 
access to sticking on top of the dungeon
something<00:00:29.130> else<00:00:29.279> I<00:00:29.429> did<00:00:29.609> was<00:00:29.820> I<00:00:29.970> started

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
something else I did was I started

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.450 
something else I did was I started
working<00:00:30.510> on<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:30.689> randomizer<00:00:31.230> now<00:00:31.619> this<00:00:32.009> may

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
working on the randomizer now this may

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.240 
working on the randomizer now this may
look<00:00:32.669> like<00:00:32.730> me<00:00:33.530> because<00:00:34.530> it's<00:00:34.829> just<00:00:34.920> a<00:00:35.100> big

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
look like me because it's just a big

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.190 
look like me because it's just a big
pile<00:00:35.430> of<00:00:35.460> blocks<00:00:35.820> and<00:00:36.329> things<00:00:36.960> like<00:00:37.140> that

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
pile of blocks and things like that

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.660 
pile of blocks and things like that
command<00:00:37.649> blocks<00:00:37.829> and<00:00:38.129> so<00:00:38.250> on<00:00:38.399> and<00:00:38.489> so<00:00:38.550> forth

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
command blocks and so on and so forth

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.340 
command blocks and so on and so forth
texting<00:00:39.270> core<00:00:39.480> binary<00:00:39.809> and<00:00:40.020> things<00:00:40.170> like<00:00:40.290> that

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
texting core binary and things like that

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.160 
texting core binary and things like that
so<00:00:41.070> what<00:00:41.219> I<00:00:41.250> did<00:00:41.370> was<00:00:41.489> I<00:00:41.700> made<00:00:41.730> a<00:00:41.910> binary<00:00:42.239> random

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
so what I did was I made a binary random

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.779 
so what I did was I made a binary random
number<00:00:43.590> generator<00:00:43.950> so<00:00:44.340> if<00:00:44.430> i<00:00:44.489> press<00:00:44.640> the

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
number generator so if i press the

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.459 
number generator so if i press the
button<00:00:45.000> you<00:00:45.539> know<00:00:45.629> save<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:45.989> number<00:00:46.140> there<00:00:46.379> we

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
button you know save the number there we

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.600 
button you know save the number there we
go<00:00:46.559> 30<00:00:46.829> and<00:00:47.989> there's<00:00:48.989> another<00:00:49.050> 19<00:00:49.379> and<00:00:50.309> so<00:00:50.489> on

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
go 30 and there's another 19 and so on

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.340 
go 30 and there's another 19 and so on
and<00:00:50.760> so<00:00:50.850> forth<00:00:50.940> so<00:00:51.360> more<00:00:51.600> i<00:00:51.629> press<00:00:51.899> it<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.140> more

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
and so forth so more i press it the more

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.310 
and so forth so more i press it the more
the<00:00:52.559> number<00:00:52.680> why<00:00:53.010> she<00:00:53.250> change<00:00:53.640> and<00:00:54.030> what<00:00:55.020> I<00:00:55.050> did

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
the number why she change and what I did

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.799 
the number why she change and what I did
was<00:00:55.559> I<00:00:55.860> actually<00:00:56.160> took<00:00:56.879> this<00:00:57.270> which<00:00:57.570> is<00:00:57.780> a

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
was I actually took this which is a

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.340 
was I actually took this which is a
giant<00:00:58.410> binary<00:00:59.190> to<00:00:59.550> numeric<00:01:00.180> number<00:01:00.930> converter

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
giant binary to numeric number converter

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.520 
giant binary to numeric number converter
and<00:01:01.680> it<00:01:02.309> seems<00:01:02.609> pretty<00:01:02.850> big<00:01:03.210> right<00:01:03.420> now<00:01:03.480> but<00:01:04.409> it

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
and it seems pretty big right now but it

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.649 
and it seems pretty big right now but it
generates<00:01:04.920> and<00:01:05.280> actually<00:01:06.030> it<00:01:06.119> just<00:01:06.150> turns<00:01:06.479> the

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
generates and actually it just turns the

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.410 
generates and actually it just turns the
number<00:01:06.930> from<00:01:07.380> binary<00:01:07.860> to<00:01:08.159> numeric<00:01:09.060> so<00:01:09.270> this

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
number from binary to numeric so this

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.899 
number from binary to numeric so this
would<00:01:09.540> be<00:01:09.570> numeric<00:01:10.080> 31<00:01:10.590> and<00:01:10.860> this<00:01:11.520> is<00:01:11.760> the

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
would be numeric 31 and this is the

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:17.539 
would be numeric 31 and this is the
binary<00:01:12.090> 431<00:01:13.130> 434<00:01:14.130> 29<00:01:14.610> 28<00:01:15.210> 27<00:01:15.600> all<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:17.159> way<00:01:17.250> down

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
binary 431 434 29 28 27 all the way down

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.499 
binary 431 434 29 28 27 all the way down
till<00:01:18.240> there<00:01:18.600> is<00:01:18.720> only<00:01:18.900> one<00:01:19.610> so<00:01:20.610> yes<00:01:21.119> I<00:01:21.330> just

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
till there is only one so yes I just

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.780 
till there is only one so yes I just
made<00:01:21.689> a<00:01:21.720> binary<00:01:22.409> two<00:01:22.710> numeric<00:01:23.159> converter<00:01:23.549> and

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
made a binary two numeric converter and

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.969 
made a binary two numeric converter and
this<00:01:24.450> generates<00:01:25.020> so<00:01:25.229> then<00:01:25.439> it<00:01:25.590> makes<00:01:25.770> the

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
this generates so then it makes the

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.380 
this generates so then it makes the
numerical<00:01:26.400> number<00:01:26.490> nine<00:01:26.820> and<00:01:27.119> things<00:01:27.240> like

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
numerical number nine and things like

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.440 
numerical number nine and things like
that<00:01:28.009> that<00:01:29.009> always<00:01:29.189> gets<00:01:29.549> them<00:01:29.759> all<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.329> way

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
that that always gets them all the way

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.130 
that that always gets them all the way
to<00:01:30.509> this<00:01:31.380> right<00:01:31.650> here<00:01:32.340> which<00:01:33.119> this<00:01:33.509> is<00:01:33.750> what

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
to this right here which this is what

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.429 
to this right here which this is what
tale<00:01:34.380> tells<00:01:35.070> which<00:01:35.700> is<00:01:36.090> going<00:01:36.570> to<00:01:36.659> be<00:01:36.750> there<00:01:37.110> so

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
tale tells which is going to be there so

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.609 
tale tells which is going to be there so
this<00:01:37.590> is<00:01:37.740> e<00:01:37.950> number<00:01:38.159> 20<00:01:38.670> 19<00:01:39.329> and<00:01:39.869> it<00:01:39.990> tests<00:01:40.380> for

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
this is e number 20 19 and it tests for

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:41.840 
this is e number 20 19 and it tests for
which<00:01:40.920> rooms<00:01:41.159> actually<00:01:41.340> going<00:01:41.640> to<00:01:41.820> be

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
which rooms actually going to be

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.639 
which rooms actually going to be
spawning<00:01:42.180> so<00:01:42.509> if<00:01:42.600> the<00:01:42.720> number<00:01:42.990> is<00:01:43.020> selected

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
spawning so if the number is selected

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:44.960 
spawning so if the number is selected
through<00:01:43.799> numeric<00:01:44.280> that's<00:01:44.549> the<00:01:44.759> room<00:01:44.880> that's

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
through numeric that's the room that's

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.819 
through numeric that's the room that's
going<00:01:45.210> to<00:01:45.299> be<00:01:45.390> spawning<00:01:45.689> so<00:01:45.960> it<00:01:46.079> choses<00:01:46.500> here

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
going to be spawning so it choses here

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.800 
going to be spawning so it choses here
and<00:01:46.979> then<00:01:47.520> it<00:01:47.729> tests<00:01:48.210> to<00:01:48.360> see<00:01:48.540> if<00:01:48.570> I<00:01:48.689> can

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
and then it tests to see if I can

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.690 
and then it tests to see if I can
actually<00:01:48.990> do<00:01:49.409> it<00:01:49.560> now<00:01:50.130> I<00:01:50.159> haven't<00:01:50.520> actually

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
actually do it now I haven't actually

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.420 
actually do it now I haven't actually
set<00:01:51.090> up<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:51.329> detection<00:01:51.750> of<00:01:52.049> the<00:01:52.320> room<00:01:52.770> which

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
set up the detection of the room which

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.190 
set up the detection of the room which
I'm<00:01:53.610> actually<00:01:53.820> working<00:01:54.210> on<00:01:54.450> right<00:01:54.750> now<00:01:54.780> it's

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
I'm actually working on right now it's

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.590 
I'm actually working on right now it's
not<00:01:55.439> actually<00:01:55.920> that<00:01:55.950> difficult<00:01:56.420> so<00:01:57.420> what

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
not actually that difficult so what

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.819 
not actually that difficult so what
we're<00:01:57.719> going<00:01:57.810> to<00:01:57.899> be<00:01:57.960> doing<00:01:58.079> is<00:01:58.320> assigning

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
we're going to be doing is assigning

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.520 
we're going to be doing is assigning
each<00:01:58.950> direction<00:01:59.219> of<00:01:59.610> the<00:01:59.700> room<00:01:59.850> a<00:01:59.909> number<00:02:00.530> so

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
each direction of the room a number so

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.170 
each direction of the room a number so
this<00:02:01.710> would<00:02:01.920> be<00:02:01.950> right<00:02:02.280> here<00:02:02.549> the<00:02:02.729> four-way

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
this would be right here the four-way

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.819 
this would be right here the four-way
intersection<00:02:03.659> would<00:02:03.750> be<00:02:03.899> Direction<00:02:04.590> number

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
intersection would be Direction number

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.069 
intersection would be Direction number
one<00:02:05.100> and<00:02:05.399> I<00:02:05.820> actually<00:02:06.000> have<00:02:06.270> my<00:02:06.450> sheet<00:02:06.750> right

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
one and I actually have my sheet right

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.139 
one and I actually have my sheet right
here<00:02:07.140> and<00:02:07.680> things<00:02:08.459> like<00:02:08.550> this<00:02:08.670> this<00:02:09.000> were

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
here and things like this this were

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.210 
here and things like this this were
actually<00:02:09.239> equal<00:02:09.629> number<00:02:09.840> 13<00:02:10.349> this<00:02:10.950> equals

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
actually equal number 13 this equals

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.370 
actually equal number 13 this equals
number<00:02:11.550> 10

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
number 10

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.930 
number 10
this<00:02:12.830> right<00:02:13.250> here<00:02:13.760> equals<00:02:14.330> number<00:02:15.200> six<00:02:15.940> this

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
this right here equals number six this

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.940 
this right here equals number six this
equals<00:02:17.360> number<00:02:17.840> five<00:02:18.140> and<00:02:18.500> so<00:02:18.680> on<00:02:18.770> and<00:02:18.860> so

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
equals number five and so on and so

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:20.260 
equals number five and so on and so
forth<00:02:19.040> and<00:02:19.370> yes<00:02:19.790> that's<00:02:20.000> going<00:02:20.150> to<00:02:20.210> be

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270 
forth and yes that's going to be

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:22.150 
forth and yes that's going to be
determining<00:02:20.870> all<00:02:21.050> the<00:02:21.320> directions<00:02:21.860> and

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
determining all the directions and

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.080 
determining all the directions and
everything<00:02:22.460> I<00:02:22.550> actually<00:02:22.670> have<00:02:22.880> a<00:02:22.910> duplicate

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
everything I actually have a duplicate

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:24.460 
everything I actually have a duplicate
right<00:02:23.480> here<00:02:23.690> this<00:02:23.870> is<00:02:24.020> the<00:02:24.050> original

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
right here this is the original

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.070 
right here this is the original
prototype<00:02:24.710> and<00:02:25.160> this<00:02:25.730> is<00:02:25.940> what<00:02:26.120> generates<00:02:26.660> all

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
prototype and this is what generates all

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.470 
prototype and this is what generates all
the<00:02:27.260> directions<00:02:27.680> and<00:02:28.100> tests<00:02:28.520> for<00:02:28.730> them<00:02:28.910> now<00:02:29.450> I

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
the directions and tests for them now I

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.030 
the directions and tests for them now I
figured<00:02:29.810> that<00:02:29.960> this<00:02:30.140> we<00:02:30.350> might<00:02:30.500> be<00:02:30.710> a<00:02:30.740> little

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
figured that this we might be a little

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.610 
figured that this we might be a little
bit<00:02:31.310> long<00:02:31.580> seeing<00:02:32.450> that<00:02:32.540> it's<00:02:32.750> already<00:02:33.380> right

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
bit long seeing that it's already right

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.860 
bit long seeing that it's already right
now<00:02:33.770> nine<00:02:34.040> blocks<00:02:34.400> and<00:02:34.700> it's<00:02:35.390> just<00:02:35.690> going<00:02:35.840> to

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
now nine blocks and it's just going to

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:37.780 
now nine blocks and it's just going to
generate<00:02:36.350> very<00:02:36.620> very<00:02:36.830> long<00:02:37.040> so<00:02:37.430> that's<00:02:37.580> why<00:02:37.760> I

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
generate very very long so that's why I

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.630 
generate very very long so that's why I
came<00:02:38.030> up<00:02:38.330> with<00:02:38.540> this<00:02:38.960> idea<00:02:39.260> way<00:02:39.860> over<00:02:40.130> here<00:02:40.400> and

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
came up with this idea way over here and

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.670 
came up with this idea way over here and
this<00:02:41.450> is<00:02:41.660> what's<00:02:41.840> actually<00:02:42.020> going<00:02:42.500> to<00:02:42.620> be

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
this is what's actually going to be

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.820 
this is what's actually going to be
testing<00:02:43.250> it<00:02:43.280> so<00:02:44.240> this<00:02:44.480> right<00:02:44.630> here<00:02:44.690> these<00:02:45.320> five

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
testing it so this right here these five

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:47.740 
testing it so this right here these five
command<00:02:46.220> blocks<00:02:46.460> this<00:02:47.180> one<00:02:47.420> in<00:02:47.510> the<00:02:47.600> corner

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
command blocks this one in the corner

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.840 
command blocks this one in the corner
tests<00:02:48.230> for<00:02:48.440> the<00:02:48.470> number<00:02:49.130> which<00:02:49.370> is<00:02:49.550> the<00:02:49.700> number

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 
tests for the number which is the number

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:52.330 
tests for the number which is the number
of<00:02:50.060> the<00:02:50.180> room<00:02:50.390> and<00:02:50.570> once<00:02:51.290> that<00:02:51.380> test<00:02:51.800> for<00:02:52.040> it's

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
of the room and once that test for it's

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.700 
of the room and once that test for it's
going<00:02:52.550> to<00:02:52.730> also<00:02:53.000> test<00:02:53.480> for<00:02:53.570> if<00:02:54.110> the<00:02:54.440> room<00:02:54.590> can

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:54.710 
going to also test for if the room can

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:56.830 
going to also test for if the room can
actually<00:02:55.040> spawn<00:02:55.280> in<00:02:55.460> these<00:02:55.580> directions<00:02:55.840> so

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
actually spawn in these directions so

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.020 
actually spawn in these directions so
there<00:02:57.140> will<00:02:57.230> be<00:02:57.320> four<00:02:57.650> different<00:02:58.010> ones<00:02:58.220> such

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
there will be four different ones such

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.110 
there will be four different ones such
as<00:02:59.060> let's<00:02:59.750> say<00:02:59.960> this<00:03:00.950> will<00:03:01.160> be<00:03:01.280> if<00:03:01.580> it<00:03:01.850> can't

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
as let's say this will be if it can't

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.030 
as let's say this will be if it can't
generate<00:03:02.450> numbers<00:03:02.810> two<00:03:03.140> through<00:03:03.170> five<00:03:03.560> it'll

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
generate numbers two through five it'll

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:05.260 
generate numbers two through five it'll
be<00:03:04.130> numbers<00:03:04.550> two<00:03:04.700> through<00:03:04.730> five<00:03:05.000> and<00:03:05.210> the

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:05.270 
be numbers two through five and the

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:06.490 
be numbers two through five and the
scoreboard<00:03:05.750> right<00:03:05.840> here<00:03:06.080> that<00:03:06.260> can't

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
scoreboard right here that can't

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:07.810 
scoreboard right here that can't
generate<00:03:06.890> and<00:03:07.160> there<00:03:07.250> will<00:03:07.340> be<00:03:07.400> an<00:03:07.460> inverter

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:07.820 
generate and there will be an inverter

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:10.210 
generate and there will be an inverter
so<00:03:08.240> on<00:03:08.330> and<00:03:08.480> so<00:03:08.540> forth<00:03:08.630> and<00:03:09.020> it<00:03:09.710> will<00:03:09.830> be<00:03:09.980> for

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220 
so on and so forth and it will be for

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.310 
so on and so forth and it will be for
all<00:03:10.520> four<00:03:10.940> sides<00:03:11.240> so<00:03:11.660> it<00:03:11.780> will<00:03:11.870> test<00:03:12.140> every

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:12.320 
all four sides so it will test every

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.770 
all four sides so it will test every
single<00:03:12.830> side<00:03:13.040> around<00:03:13.520> it<00:03:13.790> to<00:03:14.360> make<00:03:14.390> sure<00:03:14.540> you

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
single side around it to make sure you

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:17.200 
single side around it to make sure you
can<00:03:14.900> actually<00:03:15.080> spawn<00:03:15.590> and<00:03:15.860> once<00:03:16.700> a<00:03:16.820> test<00:03:17.030> for

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:17.210 
can actually spawn and once a test for

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:19.510 
can actually spawn and once a test for
that<00:03:17.390> these<00:03:17.780> will<00:03:18.200> all<00:03:18.380> turn<00:03:18.590> off<00:03:18.830> causing

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:19.520 
that these will all turn off causing

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:21.130 
that these will all turn off causing
these<00:03:19.790> to<00:03:19.970> turn<00:03:20.150> on<00:03:20.270> which<00:03:20.480> there<00:03:20.690> is<00:03:20.780> a<00:03:20.810> clone

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
these to turn on which there is a clone

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.410 
these to turn on which there is a clone
button<00:03:21.500> or<00:03:21.800> a<00:03:21.860> clone<00:03:22.340> command<00:03:22.730> which<00:03:23.240> will

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
button or a clone command which will

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.140 
button or a clone command which will
clone<00:03:23.660> the<00:03:23.870> room<00:03:24.440> into<00:03:24.890> existence<00:03:25.430> and<00:03:25.610> there

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
clone the room into existence and there

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.270 
clone the room into existence and there
is<00:03:26.270> also<00:03:26.510> a<00:03:26.720> scoreboard<00:03:27.320> which<00:03:27.560> sets<00:03:27.890> the<00:03:27.980> room

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
is also a scoreboard which sets the room

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.330 
is also a scoreboard which sets the room
that<00:03:28.430> we<00:03:28.550> just<00:03:28.910> set<00:03:29.150> to<00:03:29.870> the<00:03:30.200> actual<00:03:30.890> direction

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
that we just set to the actual direction

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.490 
that we just set to the actual direction
that<00:03:32.060> it's<00:03:32.180> going<00:03:32.330> to<00:03:32.390> be<00:03:32.480> facing<00:03:32.690> so<00:03:33.320> then<00:03:33.440> the

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.500 
that it's going to be facing so then the

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.680 
that it's going to be facing so then the
other<00:03:33.680> rooms<00:03:33.980> can<00:03:34.220> generate<00:03:34.550> accordingly<00:03:35.120> now

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690 
other rooms can generate accordingly now

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:37.090 
other rooms can generate accordingly now
I<00:03:35.720> stacked<00:03:36.020> a<00:03:36.140> couple<00:03:36.380> of<00:03:36.440> these<00:03:36.560> on<00:03:36.740> top<00:03:36.950> of

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:37.100 
I stacked a couple of these on top of

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:38.500 
I stacked a couple of these on top of
each<00:03:37.160> other<00:03:37.340> and<00:03:37.640> that's<00:03:37.910> only<00:03:38.060> just<00:03:38.210> right

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510 
each other and that's only just right

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:40.720 
each other and that's only just right
there<00:03:38.660> not<00:03:38.900> very<00:03:39.110> far<00:03:39.170> and<00:03:39.500> they<00:03:40.070> stack<00:03:40.370> very

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730 
there not very far and they stack very

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:42.520 
there not very far and they stack very
very<00:03:40.970> well<00:03:41.180> I've<00:03:41.390> noticed<00:03:41.870> and<00:03:42.140> these<00:03:42.380> are

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
very well I've noticed and these are

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:44.560 
very well I've noticed and these are
going<00:03:42.620> to<00:03:42.709> stack<00:03:42.950> about<00:03:43.220> 31<00:03:43.910> on<00:03:44.120> top<00:03:44.360> of<00:03:44.510> each

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:44.570 
going to stack about 31 on top of each

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:45.730 
going to stack about 31 on top of each
other<00:03:44.750> and<00:03:45.080> then<00:03:45.230> there's<00:03:45.380> going<00:03:45.530> to<00:03:45.620> be<00:03:45.650> a

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:45.740 
other and then there's going to be a

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:47.890 
other and then there's going to be a
grid<00:03:46.130> of<00:03:46.160> them<00:03:46.430> 10<00:03:46.790> by<00:03:46.970> 10<00:03:47.300> so<00:03:47.570> there's<00:03:47.780> going

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:47.900 
grid of them 10 by 10 so there's going

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:48.880 
grid of them 10 by 10 so there's going
to<00:03:47.990> be<00:03:48.020> about<00:03:48.140> a<00:03:48.230> hundred<00:03:48.470> of<00:03:48.770> these

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:48.890 
to be about a hundred of these

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:51.790 
to be about a hundred of these
underneath<00:03:49.640> the<00:03:49.910> entire<00:03:50.240> grid<00:03:50.930> way<00:03:51.230> up<00:03:51.470> there

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:51.800 
underneath the entire grid way up there

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.760 
underneath the entire grid way up there
and<00:03:52.100> these<00:03:52.760> work<00:03:53.150> very<00:03:53.690> very<00:03:53.810> well<00:03:54.110> stacked<00:03:54.590> on

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:54.770 
and these work very very well stacked on

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:56.320 
and these work very very well stacked on
top<00:03:54.800> of<00:03:55.040> each<00:03:55.250> other<00:03:55.430> the<00:03:55.850> only<00:03:56.000> reason<00:03:56.120> I'm

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:56.330 
top of each other the only reason I'm

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:57.910 
top of each other the only reason I'm
going<00:03:56.480> to<00:03:56.570> be<00:03:56.660> using<00:03:56.750> the<00:03:57.020> glowstone<00:03:57.470> in<00:03:57.650> here

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:57.920 
going to be using the glowstone in here

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.830 
going to be using the glowstone in here
is<00:03:58.040> just<00:03:58.220> because<00:03:58.610> of<00:03:58.820> lighting<00:03:59.180> issues<00:03:59.540> and

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
is just because of lighting issues and

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.750 
is just because of lighting issues and
the<00:04:00.110> updating<00:04:00.560> of<00:04:00.560> the<00:04:00.770> lighting<00:04:01.130> because

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:01.760 
the updating of the lighting because

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:03.820 
the updating of the lighting because
that<00:04:01.970> usually<00:04:02.120> generates<00:04:02.690> some<00:04:02.840> lags<00:04:03.080> so<00:04:03.380> if<00:04:03.680> I

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:03.830 
that usually generates some lags so if I

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:05.860 
that usually generates some lags so if I
add<00:04:03.860> some<00:04:04.400> glow<00:04:04.610> stone<00:04:04.850> I've<00:04:05.090> heard<00:04:05.300> that<00:04:05.570> it

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:05.870 
add some glow stone I've heard that it

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:08.530 
add some glow stone I've heard that it
removes<00:04:06.560> the<00:04:06.920> lighting<00:04:07.490> flashing<00:04:08.060> and<00:04:08.330> the

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:08.540 
removes the lighting flashing and the

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.540 
removes the lighting flashing and the
lighting<00:04:08.840> updates<00:04:09.350> and<00:04:09.650> I'm<00:04:09.980> also<00:04:10.130> sorry<00:04:10.430> that

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:10.550 
lighting updates and I'm also sorry that

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:11.800 
lighting updates and I'm also sorry that
I<00:04:10.670> haven't<00:04:10.880> been<00:04:11.000> able<00:04:11.120> to<00:04:11.209> work<00:04:11.390> on<00:04:11.540> it<00:04:11.690> that

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:11.810 
I haven't been able to work on it that

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:13.810 
I haven't been able to work on it that
often<00:04:12.080> that's<00:04:12.500> just<00:04:12.709> because<00:04:12.860> school<00:04:13.459> and

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:13.820
