lot different let's say something like

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.510 
lot different let's say something like
black<00:00:54.690> ops<00:00:54.960> 2<00:00:55.260> but<00:00:55.500> even<00:00:55.890> better<00:00:56.070> when<00:00:56.280> I<00:00:56.309> mean

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
black ops 2 but even better when I mean

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.939 
black ops 2 but even better when I mean
by<00:00:56.640> that<00:00:56.820> I<00:00:56.879> actually<00:00:57.210> mean<00:00:57.690> black<00:00:58.079> ops<00:00:58.289> 2<00:00:58.620> maps

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.090 
by that I actually mean black ops 2 maps
so<00:00:59.219> really<00:00:59.640> small<00:01:00.000> close<00:01:00.629> quarters<00:01:01.140> maps<00:01:01.590> with

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
so really small close quarters maps with

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.100 
so really small close quarters maps with
good<00:01:02.399> spawns<00:01:02.820> because<00:01:03.210> if<00:01:03.420> you<00:01:03.570> guys<00:01:03.780> know<00:01:04.049> in

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
good spawns because if you guys know in

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.630 
good spawns because if you guys know in
cod<00:01:04.350> guys<00:01:04.619> and<00:01:04.860> pretty<00:01:05.040> much<00:01:05.220> all<00:01:05.430> of<00:01:05.610> you

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
cod guys and pretty much all of you

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.520 
cod guys and pretty much all of you
probably<00:01:05.970> do<00:01:06.420> that<00:01:06.570> or<00:01:06.720> watching<00:01:07.049> this<00:01:07.140> video

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
probably do that or watching this video

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.010 
probably do that or watching this video
yes<00:01:07.799> cod<00:01:08.070> ghosts<00:01:08.400> does<00:01:09.150> have<00:01:09.450> really<00:01:09.869> large

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
yes cod ghosts does have really large

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.200 
yes cod ghosts does have really large
maps<00:01:10.470> and<00:01:10.740> it<00:01:10.830> is<00:01:10.979> real<00:01:11.250> and<00:01:11.430> really<00:01:11.850> annoying

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
maps and it is real and really annoying

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.469 
maps and it is real and really annoying
and<00:01:12.450> I<00:01:13.229> would<00:01:13.409> actually<00:01:13.560> like<00:01:13.950> to<00:01:14.250> see<00:01:14.610> if<00:01:14.850> they

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
and I would actually like to see if they

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:16.730 
and I would actually like to see if they
could<00:01:15.509> actually<00:01:15.810> make<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.229> maps<00:01:16.470> more

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
could actually make the maps more

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.010 
could actually make the maps more
smaller<00:01:17.189> but<00:01:17.549> not<00:01:17.790> as<00:01:18.000> huge<00:01:18.450> as<00:01:18.600> they<00:01:18.720> are<00:01:18.900> in

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
smaller but not as huge as they are in

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.510 
smaller but not as huge as they are in
cod<00:01:19.259> ghosts<00:01:19.530> may<00:01:19.710> be<00:01:19.770> at<00:01:19.920> least<00:01:20.040> a<00:01:20.159> medium

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
cod ghosts may be at least a medium

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.820 
cod ghosts may be at least a medium
sized<00:01:20.759> like<00:01:21.390> as<00:01:21.630> big<00:01:21.659> as<00:01:21.990> it<00:01:22.140> could<00:01:22.290> go<00:01:22.470> maybe

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
sized like as big as it could go maybe

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.830 
sized like as big as it could go maybe
around<00:01:23.159> Freight<00:01:23.670> size<00:01:24.000> definitely<00:01:24.420> not

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
around Freight size definitely not

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.600 
around Freight size definitely not
Stonehaven<00:01:25.560> size<00:01:25.770> because<00:01:26.040> that's<00:01:26.250> just

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
Stonehaven size because that's just

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.940 
Stonehaven size because that's just
absolutely<00:01:27.210> too<00:01:27.780> big<00:01:28.049> and<00:01:28.290> I<00:01:28.350> couldn't<00:01:28.590> find

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
absolutely too big and I couldn't find

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.069 
absolutely too big and I couldn't find
anyone<00:01:29.400> on<00:01:29.579> that<00:01:29.610> map<00:01:29.970> so<00:01:30.270> let's<00:01:30.750> just<00:01:30.960> take

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
anyone on that map so let's just take

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.440 
anyone on that map so let's just take
that<00:01:31.290> out<00:01:31.409> of<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.619> equation<00:01:31.650> and<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:33.060> second

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
that out of the equation and the second

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
that out of the equation and the second
thing<00:01:33.600> I<00:01:33.750> would<00:01:33.810> like<00:01:33.930> and<00:01:34.259> I've<00:01:34.350> actually

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
thing I would like and I've actually

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.950 
thing I would like and I've actually
been<00:01:34.710> thinking<00:01:34.829> about<00:01:35.340> this<00:01:35.610> forever<00:01:35.939> in<00:01:36.329> cod

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
been thinking about this forever in cod

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.109 
been thinking about this forever in cod
or<00:01:37.409> cod<00:01:37.740> ghosts<00:01:38.040> or<00:01:38.250> pretty<00:01:38.430> much<00:01:38.579> old<00:01:38.790> codes

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
or cod ghosts or pretty much old codes

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.300 
or cod ghosts or pretty much old codes
in<00:01:39.299> general<00:01:39.689> they<00:01:39.810> give<00:01:39.990> us<00:01:40.110> around<00:01:40.380> maybe<00:01:40.860> six

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
in general they give us around maybe six

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.130 
in general they give us around maybe six
or<00:01:41.460> ten<00:01:41.670> or<00:01:41.700> twenty<00:01:42.150> maps<00:01:42.420> and<00:01:42.689> they<00:01:42.780> make<00:01:42.960> us

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
or ten or twenty maps and they make us

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.319 
or ten or twenty maps and they make us
pay<00:01:43.409> for<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:43.710> rest<00:01:43.979> I<00:01:44.189> want<00:01:44.700> them<00:01:44.850> to<00:01:44.880> give<00:01:45.180> us

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
pay for the rest I want them to give us

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.289 
pay for the rest I want them to give us
like<00:01:45.540> 30<00:01:46.049> or<00:01:46.560> 40<00:01:47.070> maps<00:01:47.280> if<00:01:47.460> they<00:01:47.579> gave<00:01:47.759> us<00:01:47.880> 30<00:01:48.090> or

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
like 30 or 40 maps if they gave us 30 or

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.810 
like 30 or 40 maps if they gave us 30 or
40<00:01:48.630> maps<00:01:48.840> I<00:01:49.079> reckon<00:01:49.920> that<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.100> next<00:01:50.490> cod<00:01:50.670> would

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
40 maps I reckon that the next cod would

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.660 
40 maps I reckon that the next cod would
be<00:01:51.000> amazing<00:01:51.720> and<00:01:51.869> more<00:01:52.079> people<00:01:52.350> would<00:01:52.740> like<00:01:53.640> to

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
be amazing and more people would like to

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.520 
be amazing and more people would like to
play<00:01:54.030> it<00:01:54.090> and<00:01:54.210> watch<00:01:54.360> more<00:01:54.600> videos<00:01:54.990> on<00:01:55.200> it<00:01:55.229> but

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
play it and watch more videos on it but

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.289 
play it and watch more videos on it but
it<00:01:55.680> might<00:01:55.860> take<00:01:56.040> the<00:01:56.189> designers<00:01:56.700> or<00:01:56.820> artists<00:01:57.270> a

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
it might take the designers or artists a

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.069 
it might take the designers or artists a
long<00:01:57.719> time<00:01:58.049> to<00:01:58.619> actually<00:01:58.799> make<00:01:59.450> the<00:02:00.450> maps<00:02:00.750> but

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
long time to actually make the maps but

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.870 
long time to actually make the maps but
if<00:02:01.229> you<00:02:01.350> think<00:02:01.380> about<00:02:01.710> it<00:02:01.920> if<00:02:02.130> you<00:02:02.250> had<00:02:02.399> 30<00:02:02.610> or

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
if you think about it if you had 30 or

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.090 
if you think about it if you had 30 or
40<00:02:03.180> maps<00:02:03.450> and<00:02:03.750> you<00:02:03.869> get<00:02:04.079> to<00:02:04.350> have<00:02:04.560> but<00:02:04.890> you<00:02:04.979> have

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
40 maps and you get to have but you have

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.499 
40 maps and you get to have but you have
to<00:02:05.219> get<00:02:05.340> used<00:02:05.579> to<00:02:05.729> like<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:05.969> lines<00:02:06.180> of<00:02:06.299> sight

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
to get used to like the lines of sight

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.300 
to get used to like the lines of sight
and<00:02:06.719> everything<00:02:07.079> but<00:02:07.439> after<00:02:07.799> while<00:02:07.950> you<00:02:08.129> get

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
and everything but after while you get

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.400 
and everything but after while you get
used<00:02:08.550> to<00:02:08.729> it<00:02:08.819> and<00:02:09.149> it<00:02:09.360> won't<00:02:09.539> get<00:02:09.720> as<00:02:09.810> boring<00:02:10.259> as

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
used to it and it won't get as boring as

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.740 
used to it and it won't get as boring as
having<00:02:10.800> 10<00:02:11.039> or<00:02:11.160> 11<00:02:11.459> maps<00:02:11.700> cousin<00:02:12.120> ghost<00:02:12.360> I'm

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
having 10 or 11 maps cousin ghost I'm

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.130 
having 10 or 11 maps cousin ghost I'm
getting

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
getting

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.780 
getting
pretty<00:02:13.350> bored<00:02:13.650> of<00:02:13.830> the<00:02:13.950> maps<00:02:14.220> unlike<00:02:14.550> black

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
pretty bored of the maps unlike black

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.160 
pretty bored of the maps unlike black
ops<00:02:15.030> 2<00:02:15.210> I<00:02:15.240> don't<00:02:15.450> know<00:02:15.510> it<00:02:15.600> had<00:02:15.720> this<00:02:15.840> feeling

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
ops 2 I don't know it had this feeling

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.410 
ops 2 I don't know it had this feeling
maybe<00:02:16.530> if<00:02:16.830> the<00:02:17.220> maps<00:02:17.430> were<00:02:17.610> smaller<00:02:17.970> and<00:02:18.090> guys

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
maybe if the maps were smaller and guys

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.050 
maybe if the maps were smaller and guys
I<00:02:18.450> might<00:02:18.870> have<00:02:19.050> enjoyed<00:02:19.200> it<00:02:19.500> a<00:02:19.800> bit<00:02:20.010> more<00:02:20.220> but

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
I might have enjoyed it a bit more but

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.120 
I might have enjoyed it a bit more but
in<00:02:21.180> black<00:02:21.390> ops<00:02:21.630> 2<00:02:21.780> i've<00:02:22.230> really<00:02:22.680> believe<00:02:23.100> that

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
in black ops 2 i've really believe that

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.550 
in black ops 2 i've really believe that
the<00:02:23.400> maps<00:02:23.640> were<00:02:24.060> more<00:02:24.720> repetitive<00:02:25.110> so<00:02:25.500> you

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
the maps were more repetitive so you

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.290 
the maps were more repetitive so you
could<00:02:25.709> play<00:02:25.740> it<00:02:26.010> for<00:02:26.370> more<00:02:26.580> and<00:02:26.880> longer<00:02:27.030> hours

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
could play it for more and longer hours

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.120 
could play it for more and longer hours
unlike<00:02:27.870> ghosts<00:02:28.110> but<00:02:28.290> there's<00:02:28.440> a<00:02:28.530> few<00:02:28.650> maps<00:02:28.920> and

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
unlike ghosts but there's a few maps and

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:30.800 
unlike ghosts but there's a few maps and
ghosts<00:02:29.430> which<00:02:29.580> I<00:02:29.730> like<00:02:29.970> to<00:02:30.000> play<00:02:30.330> a<00:02:30.360> bit<00:02:30.600> more

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
ghosts which I like to play a bit more

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.260 
ghosts which I like to play a bit more
like<00:02:31.050> strike<00:02:32.040> zone<00:02:32.430> and<00:02:32.670> freight<00:02:32.880> some<00:02:33.060> people

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
like strike zone and freight some people

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:34.760 
like strike zone and freight some people
don't<00:02:33.450> like<00:02:33.540> strike<00:02:33.930> zone<00:02:34.140> but<00:02:34.170> personally<00:02:34.740> I

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
don't like strike zone but personally I

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:37.940 
don't like strike zone but personally I
do<00:02:35.090> and<00:02:36.090> another<00:02:36.420> thing<00:02:36.540> is<00:02:36.900> if<00:02:36.959> they<00:02:37.740> could

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
do and another thing is if they could

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.130 
do and another thing is if they could
give<00:02:38.130> us<00:02:38.310> a<00:02:38.459> lot<00:02:38.790> of<00:02:38.820> more<00:02:39.360> weapon<00:02:39.780> so<00:02:39.930> more

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
give us a lot of more weapon so more

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:41.990 
give us a lot of more weapon so more
assault<00:02:40.440> rifles<00:02:40.860> more<00:02:41.130> submachine<00:02:41.640> guns<00:02:41.820> and

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
assault rifles more submachine guns and

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.059 
assault rifles more submachine guns and
that<00:02:42.120> but<00:02:42.630> what<00:02:42.840> I<00:02:42.870> don't<00:02:43.020> like<00:02:43.350> is<00:02:43.500> I<00:02:43.800> don't

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:44.069 
that but what I don't like is I don't

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:46.130 
that but what I don't like is I don't
like<00:02:44.310> them<00:02:44.520> actually<00:02:44.850> repeating<00:02:45.660> the<00:02:45.780> same<00:02:46.080> a

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
like them actually repeating the same a

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.470 
like them actually repeating the same a
soul<00:02:46.620> rifle<00:02:47.130> every<00:02:47.489> year<00:02:47.730> in<00:02:47.940> the<00:02:48.209> same

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
soul rifle every year in the same

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:49.940 
soul rifle every year in the same
submachine<00:02:49.050> gun<00:02:49.200> because<00:02:49.350> it<00:02:49.530> is<00:02:49.650> really

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
submachine gun because it is really

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:51.830 
submachine gun because it is really
annoying<00:02:50.220> when<00:02:50.520> they<00:02:50.550> pretty<00:02:51.120> much<00:02:51.209> just<00:02:51.510> copy

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
annoying when they pretty much just copy

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.570 
annoying when they pretty much just copy
a<00:02:51.989> gun<00:02:52.260> and<00:02:52.380> paste<00:02:52.680> it<00:02:52.920> even<00:02:53.310> though<00:02:53.400> that<00:02:53.550> is

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
a gun and paste it even though that is

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.130 
a gun and paste it even though that is
pretty<00:02:53.940> much<00:02:54.120> every<00:02:54.450> college<00:02:54.780> you<00:02:54.900> don't<00:02:55.019> want

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
pretty much every college you don't want

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:56.840 
pretty much every college you don't want
to<00:02:55.200> see<00:02:55.320> them<00:02:55.500> try<00:02:55.950> something<00:02:56.430> out<00:02:56.580> of<00:02:56.610> the<00:02:56.820> box

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
to see them try something out of the box

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:58.910 
to see them try something out of the box
just<00:02:57.390> a<00:02:57.630> little<00:02:58.019> bit<00:02:58.170> different<00:02:58.620> and<00:02:58.680> also

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
just a little bit different and also

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.250 
just a little bit different and also
another<00:02:59.130> thing<00:02:59.280> is<00:03:00.019> internet<00:03:01.019> or

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
another thing is internet or

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.009 
another thing is internet or
connectivity<00:03:01.830> oh<00:03:01.860> I<00:03:01.920> would<00:03:02.310> like<00:03:02.489> it<00:03:02.640> if<00:03:02.730> they

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:03.019 
connectivity oh I would like it if they

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:05.479 
connectivity oh I would like it if they
actually<00:03:04.019> don't<00:03:04.200> have<00:03:04.440> lag<00:03:04.830> or<00:03:05.100> anything<00:03:05.400> that

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
actually don't have lag or anything that

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:07.610 
actually don't have lag or anything that
would<00:03:05.610> be<00:03:05.730> much<00:03:05.970> better<00:03:06.030> and<00:03:06.630> also<00:03:07.230> another

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
would be much better and also another

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.160 
would be much better and also another
thing<00:03:07.769> I'd<00:03:08.070> like<00:03:08.250> in<00:03:08.430> the<00:03:08.459> next<00:03:08.700> cod<00:03:09.090> is<00:03:09.300> league

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
thing I'd like in the next cod is league

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.170 
thing I'd like in the next cod is league
played<00:03:10.620> like<00:03:10.950> there<00:03:11.190> was<00:03:11.340> in<00:03:11.550> black<00:03:11.760> ops<00:03:12.000> 2

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
played like there was in black ops 2

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.759 
played like there was in black ops 2
even<00:03:12.450> though<00:03:12.570> there<00:03:12.720> is<00:03:12.750> kind<00:03:13.200> of<00:03:13.350> one<00:03:13.560> in

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:13.769 
even though there is kind of one in

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
my friends that was really fun so you

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.180 
my friends that was really fun so you
can<00:03:36.870> get<00:03:36.959> into<00:03:37.200> the<00:03:37.290> competitive<00:03:37.560> scene<00:03:37.980> and

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
can get into the competitive scene and

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:39.860 
can get into the competitive scene and
all<00:03:38.280> that<00:03:38.459> but<00:03:38.910> if<00:03:39.060> they<00:03:39.209> do<00:03:39.269> something<00:03:39.570> like

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
all that but if they do something like

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.170 
all that but if they do something like
league<00:03:40.170> play<00:03:40.590> and<00:03:40.920> they<00:03:41.310> bring<00:03:41.549> that<00:03:41.760> all<00:03:41.970> back

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
league play and they bring that all back

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:43.880 
league play and they bring that all back
that<00:03:42.420> would<00:03:42.570> be<00:03:42.720> awesome<00:03:42.930> but<00:03:43.200> the<00:03:43.440> next<00:03:43.680> cod

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
that would be awesome but the next cod

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.530 
that would be awesome but the next cod
is<00:03:44.160> definitely<00:03:44.700> going<00:03:44.880> to<00:03:44.970> be<00:03:45.120> modern<00:03:45.390> warfare

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
is definitely going to be modern warfare

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.080 
is definitely going to be modern warfare
4<00:03:45.720> but<00:03:46.500> I<00:03:46.530> don't<00:03:46.890> really<00:03:47.190> want<00:03:47.430> them<00:03:47.610> to<00:03:47.640> repeat

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
4 but I don't really want them to repeat

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:49.400 
4 but I don't really want them to repeat
the<00:03:48.239> same<00:03:48.450> things<00:03:48.750> what<00:03:48.930> they<00:03:49.019> did<00:03:49.200> from

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
the same things what they did from

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.100 
the same things what they did from
modern<00:03:49.709> warfare<00:03:49.860> 3<00:03:50.100> and<00:03:50.640> from<00:03:51.570> cod<00:03:51.840> goes

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.110 
modern warfare 3 and from cod goes

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:53.360 
modern warfare 3 and from cod goes
because<00:03:52.380> they<00:03:52.500> better<00:03:52.680> make<00:03:52.829> something<00:03:53.190> a<00:03:53.250> bit

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
because they better make something a bit

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:54.890 
because they better make something a bit
different<00:03:53.430> and<00:03:53.910> also<00:03:54.239> i'm<00:03:54.360> not<00:03:54.540> sure<00:03:54.690> if<00:03:54.750> you

personally i play maybe one or two
missions<00:04:01.500> and<00:04:01.739> then<00:04:01.860> I<00:04:01.890> then<00:04:02.340> I<00:04:02.400> just<00:04:02.670> get

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:02.820 
missions and then I then I just get

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:05.030 
missions and then I then I just get
straight<00:04:03.060> into<00:04:03.239> multiplayer<00:04:03.690> I<00:04:04.140> usually<00:04:04.530> like

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
straight into multiplayer I usually like

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.789 
straight into multiplayer I usually like
to<00:04:05.100> complete<00:04:05.760> the<00:04:06.720> campaign<00:04:07.200> within<00:04:07.410> all<00:04:07.680> the

to complete the campaign within all the

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:09.650 
to complete the campaign within all the
call<00:04:07.980> of<00:04:08.130> duty's<00:04:08.459> but<00:04:08.670> after<00:04:09.359> a<00:04:09.390> while<00:04:09.540> I<00:04:09.600> just

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660 
call of duty's but after a while I just

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:11.210 
call of duty's but after a while I just
get<00:04:10.049> bored<00:04:10.320> and<00:04:10.620> I<00:04:10.680> just<00:04:10.890> start<00:04:11.100> playing

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
get bored and I just start playing

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.550 
get bored and I just start playing
multiplayer<00:04:11.640> but<00:04:12.120> if<00:04:12.299> you<00:04:12.720> could<00:04:12.959> do<00:04:13.109> I<00:04:13.350> want

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
multiplayer but if you could do I want

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:14.630 
multiplayer but if you could do I want
to<00:04:13.590> know<00:04:13.680> down<00:04:13.950> below<00:04:13.980> if<00:04:14.280> you<00:04:14.400> guys<00:04:14.459> think

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:14.640 
to know down below if you guys think

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:17.509 
to know down below if you guys think
they<00:04:15.000> should<00:04:15.329> focus<00:04:15.840> it<00:04:16.229> all<00:04:16.440> on<00:04:16.919> multiplayer

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 
they should focus it all on multiplayer

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:19.279 
they should focus it all on multiplayer
or<00:04:17.880> do<00:04:18.299> you<00:04:18.359> think<00:04:18.419> they<00:04:18.630> should<00:04:18.660> focus<00:04:19.049> on

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:19.289 
or do you think they should focus on

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:20.900 
or do you think they should focus on
both<00:04:19.590> because<00:04:19.890> personally<00:04:20.340> if<00:04:20.430> they<00:04:20.669> just

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:20.910 
both because personally if they just

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:23.120 
both because personally if they just
stay<00:04:21.150> off<00:04:21.330> the<00:04:21.510> story<00:04:21.900> mode<00:04:22.200> and<00:04:22.410> they<00:04:22.830> stick

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
stay off the story mode and they stick

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:24.680 
stay off the story mode and they stick
with<00:04:23.280> multiplayer<00:04:23.700> I<00:04:24.000> reckon<00:04:24.450> they<00:04:24.539> could

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
with multiplayer I reckon they could

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:26.540 
with multiplayer I reckon they could
probably<00:04:24.870> bring<00:04:25.349> us<00:04:25.530> the<00:04:25.710> best<00:04:25.890> more

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
probably bring us the best more

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:28.189 
probably bring us the best more
you<00:04:26.639> play<00:04:26.819> experience<00:04:27.449> they<00:04:27.569> can<00:04:27.810> instead<00:04:28.080> of

00:04:28.189 --> 00:04:28.199 
you play experience they can instead of

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:30.170 
you play experience they can instead of
wasting<00:04:28.379> their<00:04:28.919> money<00:04:29.099> and<00:04:29.669> all<00:04:29.789> that<00:04:29.970> on

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
wasting their money and all that on

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:31.430 
wasting their money and all that on
single<00:04:30.599> player<00:04:30.659> if<00:04:30.840> they<00:04:30.960> actually<00:04:31.319> spend

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.440 
single player if they actually spend

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.469 
single player if they actually spend
most<00:04:31.740> of<00:04:31.889> their<00:04:32.009> budget<00:04:32.190> on<00:04:32.639> modulo<00:04:33.180> actually

00:04:33.469 --> 00:04:33.479 
most of their budget on modulo actually

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:35.180 
most of their budget on modulo actually
all<00:04:33.629> of<00:04:33.659> their<00:04:33.930> budget<00:04:34.080> or<00:04:34.440> multiplayer<00:04:34.770> I

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:35.190 
all of their budget or multiplayer I

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:36.740 
all of their budget or multiplayer I
believe<00:04:35.729> they<00:04:35.909> could<00:04:35.970> make<00:04:36.300> some<00:04:36.509> really

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:36.750 
believe they could make some really

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:39.680 
believe they could make some really
explosive<00:04:37.409> awesome<00:04:38.280> next<00:04:38.550> gen<00:04:38.909> call<00:04:39.150> of<00:04:39.210> duty

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:39.690 
explosive awesome next gen call of duty

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:41.839 
explosive awesome next gen call of duty
which<00:04:40.139> brings<00:04:40.470> me<00:04:40.560> to<00:04:40.650> another<00:04:40.830> thing<00:04:41.430> I<00:04:41.610> know

00:04:41.839 --> 00:04:41.849 
which brings me to another thing I know

00:04:41.849 --> 00:04:43.339 
which brings me to another thing I know
a<00:04:42.000> lot<00:04:42.180> of<00:04:42.240> people<00:04:42.360> have<00:04:42.690> been<00:04:42.720> saying<00:04:43.110> this

00:04:43.339 --> 00:04:43.349 
a lot of people have been saying this

00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:45.320 
a lot of people have been saying this
but<00:04:43.590> they<00:04:43.860> actually<00:04:44.250> said<00:04:44.550> that<00:04:44.759> they<00:04:44.970> don't

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
but they actually said that they don't

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.990 
but they actually said that they don't
want<00:04:46.009> the<00:04:47.009> next<00:04:47.340> gen<00:04:47.550> to<00:04:47.699> have<00:04:47.789> better

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.000 
want the next gen to have better

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.999 
want the next gen to have better
graphics<00:04:48.479> and<00:04:48.659> all<00:04:48.720> that<00:04:48.870> personally<00:04:49.349> I<00:04:49.530> don't

00:04:49.999 --> 00:04:50.009 
graphics and all that personally I don't

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:52.640 
graphics and all that personally I don't
have<00:04:50.220> anything<00:04:50.550> wrong<00:04:51.360> with<00:04:51.539> it<00:04:51.569> I<00:04:51.870> think<00:04:52.139> the

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:52.650 
have anything wrong with it I think the

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:54.320 
have anything wrong with it I think the
next<00:04:52.680> gen<00:04:53.039> should<00:04:53.250> have<00:04:53.400> better<00:04:53.580> graphics<00:04:54.090> but

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:54.330 
next gen should have better graphics but

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:56.210 
next gen should have better graphics but
what<00:04:54.780> would<00:04:54.900> be<00:04:55.050> really<00:04:55.319> cool<00:04:55.620> if<00:04:55.680> the<00:04:55.949> next

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:56.220 
what would be really cool if the next

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:58.010 
what would be really cool if the next
chord<00:04:56.430> could<00:04:56.639> do<00:04:56.789> this<00:04:56.940> is<00:04:57.150> if<00:04:57.449> you<00:04:57.599> could<00:04:57.780> play

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:58.020 
chord could do this is if you could play

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:00.379 
chord could do this is if you could play
with<00:04:58.259> Xbox<00:04:59.099> one<00:04:59.430> people<00:04:59.940> if<00:05:00.060> you're<00:05:00.180> on<00:05:00.270> an

00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:00.389 
with Xbox one people if you're on an

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:03.499 
with Xbox one people if you're on an
xbox<00:05:00.629> 360<00:05:01.409> or<00:05:01.530> ps3<00:05:01.740> the<00:05:02.219> ps4<00:05:02.430> people<00:05:03.090> even

00:05:03.499 --> 00:05:03.509 
xbox 360 or ps3 the ps4 people even

00:05:03.509 --> 00:05:04.939 
xbox 360 or ps3 the ps4 people even
though<00:05:03.810> that's<00:05:04.020> kind<00:05:04.259> of<00:05:04.379> got<00:05:04.500> something<00:05:04.830> to

00:05:04.939 --> 00:05:04.949 
though that's kind of got something to

00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:06.830 
though that's kind of got something to
do<00:05:05.069> for<00:05:05.190> the<00:05:05.280> consoles<00:05:05.699> with<00:05:05.849> the<00:05:05.940> ps3<00:05:06.479> the<00:05:06.629> ps4

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:06.840 
do for the consoles with the ps3 the ps4

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:08.869 
do for the consoles with the ps3 the ps4
and<00:05:07.469> it's<00:05:07.889> got<00:05:08.009> nothing<00:05:08.280> to<00:05:08.340> have<00:05:08.460> infinity

00:05:08.869 --> 00:05:08.879 
and it's got nothing to have infinity

00:05:08.879 --> 00:05:10.100 
and it's got nothing to have infinity
water<00:05:09.090> or<00:05:09.180> anything<00:05:09.360> but<00:05:09.569> if<00:05:09.690> they<00:05:09.810> could<00:05:09.990> do

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:10.110 
water or anything but if they could do

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:11.390 
water or anything but if they could do
that<00:05:10.229> that<00:05:10.409> would<00:05:10.440> be<00:05:10.680> pretty<00:05:10.860> cool<00:05:10.979> to<00:05:11.159> have

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:11.400 
that that would be pretty cool to have

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:12.830 
that that would be pretty cool to have
the<00:05:11.520> service<00:05:11.879> mixed<00:05:12.210> up<00:05:12.330> with<00:05:12.479> something<00:05:12.690> like

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:12.840 
the service mixed up with something like

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:14.420 
the service mixed up with something like
that<00:05:12.990> that<00:05:13.139> would<00:05:13.590> be<00:05:13.740> awesome<00:05:14.009> if<00:05:14.340> you

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:14.430 
that that would be awesome if you

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:17.180 
that that would be awesome if you
thought<00:05:14.669> about<00:05:14.819> it<00:05:14.969> and<00:05:15.680> another<00:05:16.680> thing<00:05:16.949> is

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:17.190 
thought about it and another thing is

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:20.600 
thought about it and another thing is
weapon<00:05:17.819> DLC<00:05:18.360> now<00:05:19.050> weapon<00:05:19.500> DLC<00:05:19.949> I<00:05:19.979> don't<00:05:20.400> think

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:20.610 
weapon DLC now weapon DLC I don't think

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:21.890 
weapon DLC now weapon DLC I don't think
they<00:05:20.729> should<00:05:20.759> make<00:05:21.060> us<00:05:21.240> pay<00:05:21.449> for<00:05:21.479> it<00:05:21.780> because

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:21.900 
they should make us pay for it because

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:23.480 
they should make us pay for it because
we<00:05:22.169> already<00:05:22.289> paid<00:05:22.650> for<00:05:22.680> the<00:05:22.919> game<00:05:23.219> and<00:05:23.400> they're

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:23.490 
we already paid for the game and they're

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:25.309 
we already paid for the game and they're
making<00:05:23.759> us<00:05:23.849> pay<00:05:24.030> for<00:05:24.240> more<00:05:24.360> stuff<00:05:24.659> but<00:05:25.080> in<00:05:25.199> a

00:05:25.309 --> 00:05:25.319 
making us pay for more stuff but in a

00:05:25.319 --> 00:05:26.959 
making us pay for more stuff but in a
way<00:05:25.469> they<00:05:25.680> do<00:05:25.740> spend<00:05:26.159> more<00:05:26.400> money<00:05:26.610> actually

00:05:26.959 --> 00:05:26.969 
way they do spend more money actually

00:05:26.969 --> 00:05:29.689 
way they do spend more money actually
getting<00:05:27.719> artists<00:05:28.379> to<00:05:28.560> full-on<00:05:29.129> create<00:05:29.550> the

00:05:29.689 --> 00:05:29.699 
getting artists to full-on create the

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:31.309 
getting artists to full-on create the
gun<00:05:29.909> and<00:05:30.210> all<00:05:30.389> of<00:05:30.539> that<00:05:30.569> but<00:05:30.719> personally<00:05:31.259> I

00:05:31.309 --> 00:05:31.319 
gun and all of that but personally I

00:05:31.319 --> 00:05:33.110 
gun and all of that but personally I
think<00:05:31.409> they<00:05:31.740> should<00:05:31.919> give<00:05:32.099> out<00:05:32.250> free<00:05:32.580> gun<00:05:32.880> dlc

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:33.120 
think they should give out free gun dlc

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:35.899 
think they should give out free gun dlc
for<00:05:34.050> like<00:05:34.259> a<00:05:34.440> week<00:05:34.710> or<00:05:34.889> something<00:05:34.949> so<00:05:35.520> you<00:05:35.669> have

00:05:35.899 --> 00:05:35.909 
for like a week or something so you have

00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:37.279 
for like a week or something so you have
to<00:05:36.060> get<00:05:36.180> it<00:05:36.270> within<00:05:36.389> that<00:05:36.599> week<00:05:36.810> or<00:05:37.050> you<00:05:37.110> don't

00:05:37.279 --> 00:05:37.289 
to get it within that week or you don't

00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:38.689 
to get it within that week or you don't
get<00:05:37.440> it<00:05:37.560> all<00:05:37.710> personally<00:05:38.099> I'd<00:05:38.250> like<00:05:38.460> that<00:05:38.669> a

00:05:38.689 --> 00:05:38.699 
get it all personally I'd like that a

00:05:38.699 --> 00:05:40.459 
get it all personally I'd like that a
bit<00:05:38.940> more<00:05:39.060> better<00:05:39.300> instead<00:05:40.020> of<00:05:40.110> paying<00:05:40.289> for

00:05:40.459 --> 00:05:40.469 
bit more better instead of paying for

00:05:40.469 --> 00:05:42.830 
bit more better instead of paying for
the<00:05:40.560> DLC<00:05:41.130> and<00:05:41.310> I<00:05:41.909> reckon<00:05:42.300> that<00:05:42.449> should<00:05:42.630> be<00:05:42.719> the

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:42.840 
the DLC and I reckon that should be the

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:44.300 
the DLC and I reckon that should be the
same<00:05:43.020> thing<00:05:43.289> that<00:05:43.319> the<00:05:43.409> cameras<00:05:43.800> as<00:05:43.949> well<00:05:43.979> to

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:44.310 
same thing that the cameras as well to

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:46.129 
same thing that the cameras as well to
be<00:05:44.400> honest<00:05:44.729> in<00:05:45.000> ghosts<00:05:45.300> they<00:05:45.750> come<00:05:45.960> as<00:05:46.110> a

00:05:46.129 --> 00:05:46.139 
be honest in ghosts they come as a

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:48.140 
be honest in ghosts they come as a
horrible<00:05:46.680> I<00:05:46.860> mean<00:05:47.370> they're<00:05:47.550> all<00:05:47.580> right<00:05:47.940> but

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:48.150 
horrible I mean they're all right but

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:49.670 
horrible I mean they're all right but
they're<00:05:48.300> still<00:05:48.389> horrible<00:05:48.870> like<00:05:49.050> black<00:05:49.319> ops<00:05:49.529> 2

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:49.680 
they're still horrible like black ops 2

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:51.499 
they're still horrible like black ops 2
had<00:05:49.860> some<00:05:50.069> really<00:05:50.310> nice<00:05:50.610> cameras<00:05:51.029> and<00:05:51.240> also

00:05:51.499 --> 00:05:51.509 
had some really nice cameras and also

00:05:51.509 --> 00:05:53.600

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:53.610 
the ones that recently came out which

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:55.580

but if they give us some free stuff now
and<00:06:06.870> then<00:06:07.139> it<00:06:07.349> would<00:06:07.740> be<00:06:07.860> pretty<00:06:08.039> cool<00:06:08.159> to<00:06:08.370> give

00:06:08.629 --> 00:06:08.639 
and then it would be pretty cool to give

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:10.999 
and then it would be pretty cool to give
back<00:06:08.849> to<00:06:08.879> us<00:06:09.180> because<00:06:09.449> we<00:06:09.719> already<00:06:09.900> paid<00:06:10.289> like

00:06:10.999 --> 00:06:11.009 
back to us because we already paid like

00:06:11.009 --> 00:06:12.740 
back to us because we already paid like
ninety<00:06:11.400> dollars<00:06:11.550> a<00:06:11.759> hundred<00:06:12.150> dollars<00:06:12.449> on<00:06:12.599> the

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:12.750 
ninety dollars a hundred dollars on the

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:13.879 
ninety dollars a hundred dollars on the
game<00:06:12.930> but<00:06:13.080> I<00:06:13.169> thought<00:06:13.319> that'd<00:06:13.469> be<00:06:13.590> really<00:06:13.740> cool

00:06:13.879 --> 00:06:13.889 
game but I thought that'd be really cool

00:06:13.889 --> 00:06:16.369 
game but I thought that'd be really cool
if<00:06:14.219> the<00:06:14.699> next<00:06:14.969> cod<00:06:15.150> can<00:06:15.389> incorporate<00:06:15.779> some<00:06:16.349> of

00:06:16.369 --> 00:06:16.379 
if the next cod can incorporate some of

00:06:16.379 --> 00:06:19.279 
if the next cod can incorporate some of
this<00:06:16.560> stuff<00:06:16.860> saying<00:06:17.340> less<00:06:18.180> maps<00:06:18.479> more<00:06:18.960> guns

00:06:19.279 --> 00:06:19.289 
this stuff saying less maps more guns

00:06:19.289 --> 00:06:21.950 
this stuff saying less maps more guns
and<00:06:19.710> pretty<00:06:20.190> much<00:06:20.340> if<00:06:20.490> they<00:06:20.639> less<00:06:21.029> up<00:06:21.360> on<00:06:21.599> story

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:21.960 
and pretty much if they less up on story

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:23.480 
and pretty much if they less up on story
mode<00:06:22.169> I'm<00:06:22.259> not<00:06:22.409> saying<00:06:22.650> they<00:06:23.009> shouldn't<00:06:23.279> do

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:23.490 
mode I'm not saying they shouldn't do

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:25.070 
mode I'm not saying they shouldn't do
story<00:06:23.819> mode<00:06:24.060> but<00:06:24.210> if<00:06:24.270> they<00:06:24.360> could<00:06:24.509> focus<00:06:24.750> their

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:25.080 
story mode but if they could focus their

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:26.480 
story mode but if they could focus their
time<00:06:25.110> on<00:06:25.409> Morty<00:06:25.740> play<00:06:25.979> even<00:06:26.190> though<00:06:26.250> they<00:06:26.430> do

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:26.490 
time on Morty play even though they do

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:28.129 
time on Morty play even though they do
have<00:06:26.610> different<00:06:26.969> groups<00:06:27.419> and<00:06:27.629> divisions

00:06:28.129 --> 00:06:28.139 
have different groups and divisions

00:06:28.139 --> 00:06:30.409 
have different groups and divisions
doing<00:06:28.469> that<00:06:28.620> I<00:06:28.830> reckon<00:06:29.430> they<00:06:29.909> should<00:06:30.090> probably

00:06:30.409 --> 00:06:30.419 
doing that I reckon they should probably

00:06:30.419 --> 00:06:32.330 
doing that I reckon they should probably
do<00:06:30.569> that<00:06:30.599> but<00:06:30.840> Tommy<00:06:31.020> down<00:06:31.259> below<00:06:31.529> if<00:06:31.770> you

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:32.340 
do that but Tommy down below if you

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:34.070 
do that but Tommy down below if you
think<00:06:32.759> they<00:06:32.940> should<00:06:32.969> focus<00:06:33.330> on<00:06:33.629> multiplayer

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:34.080 
think they should focus on multiplayer

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:36.320 
think they should focus on multiplayer
more<00:06:34.440> or<00:06:34.649> story<00:06:35.070> more<00:06:35.370> but<00:06:35.639> if<00:06:35.759> they<00:06:35.880> focus<00:06:36.210> on

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:36.330 
more or story more but if they focus on

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:37.760 
more or story more but if they focus on
what<00:06:36.509> you<00:06:36.630> claim<00:06:36.810> or<00:06:36.990> they<00:06:37.110> will<00:06:37.259> give<00:06:37.469> us<00:06:37.620> a
