I've<00:00:13.379> been<00:00:13.529> using<00:00:13.650> this<00:00:13.920> mostly<00:00:14.219> as<00:00:14.369> like<00:00:14.459> an

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
I've been using this mostly as like an

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.929 
I've been using this mostly as like an
under-eye<00:00:14.820> concealer<00:00:16.340> basically<00:00:17.340> if<00:00:17.699> I

00:00:17.929 --> 00:00:17.939 
under-eye concealer basically if I

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:19.730 
under-eye concealer basically if I
wanted<00:00:18.150> to<00:00:18.269> wear<00:00:18.390> it<00:00:18.480> anywhere<00:00:18.750> else<00:00:18.869> it<00:00:19.230> would

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
wanted to wear it anywhere else it would

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.409 
wanted to wear it anywhere else it would
be<00:00:19.859> way<00:00:20.039> too<00:00:20.070> light<00:00:20.550> for<00:00:20.580> the<00:00:20.849> rest<00:00:20.999> of<00:00:21.089> my<00:00:21.240> face

00:00:21.409 --> 00:00:21.419 
be way too light for the rest of my face

00:00:21.419 --> 00:00:23.900 
be way too light for the rest of my face
I<00:00:22.009> still<00:00:23.009> think<00:00:23.189> that<00:00:23.249> maybe<00:00:23.490> I<00:00:23.580> should<00:00:23.669> have

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
I still think that maybe I should have

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.400 
I still think that maybe I should have
gotten<00:00:24.089> the<00:00:24.210> color<00:00:24.449> medium<00:00:24.689> light<00:00:25.050> but<00:00:25.320> it

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
gotten the color medium light but it

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.409 
gotten the color medium light but it
looked<00:00:25.589> really<00:00:25.769> dark<00:00:26.070> in<00:00:26.310> the<00:00:26.400> packaging<00:00:26.939> but

00:00:27.409 --> 00:00:27.419 
looked really dark in the packaging but

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:29.890 
looked really dark in the packaging but
this<00:00:27.570> one<00:00:27.749> is<00:00:27.900> just<00:00:28.050> like<00:00:28.949> a<00:00:28.980> little<00:00:29.189> bit<00:00:29.429> too

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:29.900 
this one is just like a little bit too

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.780 
this one is just like a little bit too
light<00:00:30.900> for<00:00:30.929> my<00:00:31.259> taste<00:00:31.529> it<00:00:31.739> does<00:00:32.340> give<00:00:32.520> you<00:00:32.640> like

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
light for my taste it does give you like

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.490 
light for my taste it does give you like
a<00:00:32.820> brightening<00:00:33.360> effect<00:00:33.660> under<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:34.020> eye<00:00:34.050> so<00:00:34.410> if

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
a brightening effect under the eye so if

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.230 
a brightening effect under the eye so if
that's<00:00:34.620> if<00:00:35.190> you<00:00:35.370> like<00:00:35.610> to<00:00:35.820> wear<00:00:35.940> lighter

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:36.240 
that's if you like to wear lighter

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:37.940 
that's if you like to wear lighter
concealers<00:00:36.870> under<00:00:37.140> your<00:00:37.260> eyes<00:00:37.410> I<00:00:37.620> think<00:00:37.830> you'd

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
concealers under your eyes I think you'd

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.670 
concealers under your eyes I think you'd
really<00:00:38.070> like<00:00:38.190> this<00:00:38.490> um<00:00:39.020> it<00:00:40.020> doesn't<00:00:40.350> have<00:00:40.500> the

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
really like this um it doesn't have the

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.420 
really like this um it doesn't have the
best<00:00:40.950> coverage<00:00:42.320> but<00:00:43.320> it's<00:00:43.440> it's<00:00:44.010> I<00:00:44.160> would<00:00:44.280> say

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
best coverage but it's it's I would say

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.730 
best coverage but it's it's I would say
medium<00:00:44.640> it's<00:00:45.540> not<00:00:45.780> full<00:00:46.020> coverage<00:00:46.050> I<00:00:46.560> don't

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:46.740 
medium it's not full coverage I don't

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:49.160 
medium it's not full coverage I don't
think<00:00:46.980> it<00:00:47.700> has<00:00:47.910> a<00:00:47.940> weird<00:00:48.240> applicator

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
think it has a weird applicator

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.050 
think it has a weird applicator
I<00:00:49.200> usually<00:00:49.980> just<00:00:50.280> squeeze<00:00:50.460> it<00:00:50.610> out<00:00:50.700> onto<00:00:50.850> my

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:51.060 
I usually just squeeze it out onto my

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:52.310 
I usually just squeeze it out onto my
finger<00:00:51.360> instead<00:00:51.660> of<00:00:51.750> trying<00:00:51.960> to<00:00:51.990> work<00:00:52.140> with

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
finger instead of trying to work with

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.730 
finger instead of trying to work with
that<00:00:52.350> sponge<00:00:52.830> thing<00:00:53.220> um<00:00:53.520> I<00:00:54.140> don't<00:00:55.140> really<00:00:55.440> care

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:55.740 
that sponge thing um I don't really care

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:58.580 
that sponge thing um I don't really care
for<00:00:55.800> that<00:00:56.010> um<00:00:56.610> I<00:00:56.640> think<00:00:57.540> because<00:00:58.290> you<00:00:58.380> have<00:00:58.500> to

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
for that um I think because you have to

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.020 
for that um I think because you have to
use<00:00:58.680> your<00:00:58.800> finger<00:00:59.070> anyway<00:00:59.370> to<00:00:59.430> blend<00:00:59.730> it<00:00:59.880> and

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
use your finger anyway to blend it and

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.060 
use your finger anyway to blend it and
or<00:01:00.420> a<00:01:00.450> brush<00:01:00.930> or<00:01:01.080> something<00:01:01.410> so<00:01:01.560> I<00:01:01.620> don't<00:01:01.680> think

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
or a brush or something so I don't think

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.929 
or a brush or something so I don't think
the<00:01:02.190> sponge<00:01:02.520> thing<00:01:02.850> works<00:01:03.060> very<00:01:03.300> well<00:01:03.390> um<00:01:03.990> I

00:01:04.929 --> 00:01:04.939 
the sponge thing works very well um I

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:07.669 
the sponge thing works very well um I
like<00:01:05.939> to<00:01:06.060> put<00:01:06.179> it<00:01:06.270> on<00:01:06.359> then<00:01:07.200> put<00:01:07.229> on<00:01:07.499> foundation

00:01:07.669 --> 00:01:07.679 
like to put it on then put on foundation

00:01:07.679 --> 00:01:09.380 
like to put it on then put on foundation
then<00:01:08.159> I<00:01:08.249> put<00:01:08.429> on<00:01:08.460> a<00:01:08.579> little<00:01:08.789> bit<00:01:08.939> more<00:01:09.119> of<00:01:09.240> this

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
then I put on a little bit more of this

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:10.880 
then I put on a little bit more of this
and<00:01:09.659> then<00:01:09.810> I<00:01:09.840> end<00:01:10.020> up<00:01:10.170> setting<00:01:10.499> it<00:01:10.590> with<00:01:10.740> the

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
and then I end up setting it with the

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.580 
and then I end up setting it with the
bare<00:01:11.070> minerals<00:01:13.130> original<00:01:14.130> foundation<00:01:15.590> which

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
bare minerals original foundation which

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.440 
bare minerals original foundation which
I<00:01:16.710> do<00:01:16.770> with<00:01:16.950> most<00:01:17.100> of<00:01:17.280> my<00:01:17.340> concealers<00:01:17.999> anyway

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
I do with most of my concealers anyway

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.059 
I do with most of my concealers anyway
for<00:01:18.630> under-eye<00:01:18.869> just<00:01:19.259> because<00:01:19.530> I<00:01:19.560> think<00:01:19.890> that

00:01:20.059 --> 00:01:20.069 
for under-eye just because I think that

00:01:20.069 --> 00:01:27.469 
for under-eye just because I think that
it<00:01:20.450> tends<00:01:21.450> to<00:01:21.600> look<00:01:21.899> more<00:01:25.579> less<00:01:26.579> dark<00:01:26.999> under

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
it tends to look more less dark under

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.870 
it tends to look more less dark under
there<00:01:27.659> I<00:01:28.109> have<00:01:28.679> terrible<00:01:28.950> dark<00:01:29.249> circles<00:01:29.640> by

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
there I have terrible dark circles by

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.620 
there I have terrible dark circles by
the<00:01:29.939> way<00:01:30.119> if<00:01:30.450> you<00:01:30.600> can't<00:01:30.810> tell<00:01:30.990> um<00:01:32.479> but<00:01:33.479> I<00:01:33.509> do

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
the way if you can't tell um but I do

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.399 
the way if you can't tell um but I do
like<00:01:33.990> this<00:01:34.229> it's<00:01:34.889> not<00:01:35.130> like<00:01:35.810> my<00:01:36.810> favorite

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
like this it's not like my favorite

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:38.929 
like this it's not like my favorite
concealer<00:01:37.740> I've<00:01:37.979> ever<00:01:38.130> used<00:01:38.369> for<00:01:38.639> under<00:01:38.819> the

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
concealer I've ever used for under the

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.879 
concealer I've ever used for under the
eyes<00:01:39.030> but<00:01:39.479> I<00:01:39.509> do<00:01:39.600> think<00:01:40.139> that<00:01:40.350> it's<00:01:40.619> a<00:01:40.710> good

00:01:40.879 --> 00:01:40.889 
eyes but I do think that it's a good

00:01:40.889 --> 00:01:44.239 
eyes but I do think that it's a good
drugstore<00:01:41.549> option<00:01:41.939> um<00:01:42.329> I<00:01:42.619> think<00:01:43.619> that<00:01:43.829> I<00:01:43.950> would

00:01:44.239 --> 00:01:44.249 
drugstore option um I think that I would

00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:49.069 
drugstore option um I think that I would
go<00:01:44.520> for<00:01:44.789> the<00:01:44.999> medium<00:01:45.329> light<00:01:45.649> color<00:01:46.649> though<00:01:48.079> but

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
go for the medium light color though but

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.510 
go for the medium light color though but
other<00:01:49.200> than<00:01:49.319> that<00:01:49.409> like<00:01:49.709> it<00:01:49.859> doesn't<00:01:50.130> seem<00:01:50.340> it

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
other than that like it doesn't seem it

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:51.410 
other than that like it doesn't seem it
lasts<00:01:50.909> a<00:01:50.969> long<00:01:51.090> time

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
lasts a long time

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:52.940 
lasts a long time
it<00:01:51.659> doesn't<00:01:52.020> really<00:01:52.139> end<00:01:52.380> up<00:01:52.439> creasing

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
it doesn't really end up creasing
