00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:49.400 
difference here is that the boiling
water<00:04:47.100> reactor<00:04:47.580> you<00:04:47.670> have<00:04:47.850> boiling<00:04:48.630> right<00:04:49.140> and

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:49.410 
water reactor you have boiling right and

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:50.720 
water reactor you have boiling right and
that<00:04:49.530> makes<00:04:49.710> everything<00:04:50.010> more<00:04:50.220> difficult<00:04:50.280> to

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:50.730 
that makes everything more difficult to

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:52.940 
that makes everything more difficult to
model<00:04:50.910> thermodynamic<00:04:51.660> now<00:04:52.620> you<00:04:52.680> can

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:52.950 
model thermodynamic now you can

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:54.620 
model thermodynamic now you can
compensate<00:04:53.310> that<00:04:53.460> effect<00:04:53.940> on<00:04:54.120> a<00:04:54.270> technology

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:54.630 
compensate that effect on a technology

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:56.570 
compensate that effect on a technology
which<00:04:55.020> you<00:04:55.110> can<00:04:55.200> shift<00:04:55.440> control<00:04:55.860> in<00:04:56.070> one<00:04:56.370> of<00:04:56.400> my

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:56.580 
which you can shift control in one of my

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:58.880 
which you can shift control in one of my
rack<00:04:56.790> over<00:04:57.210> to<00:04:57.330> a<00:04:57.360> computer<00:04:57.720> problem<00:04:58.680> would

rack over to a computer problem would

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:01.399 
rack over to a computer problem would
then<00:04:59.550> you<00:04:59.640> have<00:04:59.790> to<00:04:59.970> use<00:05:00.150> morning

00:05:01.399 --> 00:05:01.409 
then you have to use morning

00:05:33.649 --> 00:05:33.659 
heard of us your noble aren't these

00:05:33.659 --> 00:05:41.600 
heard of us your noble aren't these
things<00:05:33.929> cause<00:05:34.139> cancer<00:05:37.550> this<00:05:38.550> is<00:05:38.729> true<00:05:40.610> great

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:41.610 
things cause cancer this is true great

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:43.669 
things cause cancer this is true great
question<00:05:41.909> let<00:05:42.360> me<00:05:42.629> tell<00:05:42.959> you<00:05:43.079> about<00:05:43.229> your

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:43.679 
question let me tell you about your

00:05:43.679 --> 00:05:46.189 
question let me tell you about your
noble<00:05:44.099> there's<00:05:44.729> two<00:05:44.999> main<00:05:45.239> reasons<00:05:45.509> why<00:05:45.929> they

00:05:46.189 --> 00:05:46.199 
noble there's two main reasons why they

00:05:46.199 --> 00:05:48.529 
noble there's two main reasons why they
got<00:05:46.409> cancer<00:05:46.889> in<00:05:47.009> Chernobyl<00:05:47.579> the<00:05:47.939> first<00:05:48.239> is<00:05:48.479> a

00:05:48.529 --> 00:05:48.539 
got cancer in Chernobyl the first is a

00:05:48.539 --> 00:05:50.809 
got cancer in Chernobyl the first is a
communistic<00:05:49.110> style<00:05:49.619> of<00:05:49.860> government<00:05:50.249> the

00:05:50.809 --> 00:05:50.819 
communistic style of government the

00:05:50.819 --> 00:05:52.549 
communistic style of government the
second<00:05:51.269> reason<00:05:51.389> is<00:05:51.749> they<00:05:52.079> did<00:05:52.289> have<00:05:52.529> a

00:05:52.549 --> 00:05:52.559 
second reason is they did have a

00:05:52.559 --> 00:05:54.679 
second reason is they did have a
containment<00:05:53.099> structure<00:05:53.699> now<00:05:54.089> let<00:05:54.300> me<00:05:54.329> tell

00:05:54.679 --> 00:05:54.689 
containment structure now let me tell

00:05:54.689 --> 00:05:57.259 
containment structure now let me tell
you<00:05:54.869> about<00:05:55.019> argentine<00:05:55.860> construction<00:05:56.459> first

00:05:57.259 --> 00:05:57.269 
you about argentine construction first

00:05:57.269 --> 00:05:58.909 
you about argentine construction first
you<00:05:57.719> have<00:05:57.899> three<00:05:58.259> feet<00:05:58.559> of<00:05:58.709> reinforced

00:05:58.909 --> 00:05:58.919 
you have three feet of reinforced

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:02.299 
you have three feet of reinforced
concrete<00:05:59.779> surrounding<00:06:00.779> a<00:06:00.869> steel<00:06:01.309> cylinder

00:06:02.299 --> 00:06:02.309 
concrete surrounding a steel cylinder

00:06:02.309 --> 00:06:04.669 
concrete surrounding a steel cylinder
then<00:06:02.909> crash<00:06:03.269> planes<00:06:03.659> into<00:06:04.110> these<00:06:04.229> to<00:06:04.439> test

00:06:04.669 --> 00:06:04.679 
then crash planes into these to test

00:06:04.679 --> 00:06:06.919 
then crash planes into these to test
their<00:06:04.889> integrity<00:06:05.189> if<00:06:06.029> I<00:06:06.209> was<00:06:06.389> standing<00:06:06.779> on<00:06:06.869> the
