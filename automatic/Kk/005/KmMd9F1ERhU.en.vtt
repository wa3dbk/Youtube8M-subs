00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:16.830
 learning system for anything story 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:19.020
 even that for making a provision for 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.410
 firing from the knee and lying 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:25.850
 First, we work with the arrows 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:29.300
 making a position for shooting at 

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:35.660
 division then quickly whole about 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:35.660
 do standing division in battle do it once 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:46.080
 two need to pay the instructor and 

00:00:43.229 --> 00:00:48.300
 sent to the following in this 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:50.010
 case that the legs are raised extremely high 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:57.839
 left elbow and he's practically 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:01:01.229
 butt does not rest on shoulder slightly 

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:02.640
 a little closer but not much to tilt the left 

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:05.159
 left elbow 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:09.000
 left elbow does not need to be lowered here it is 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:11.610
 position to press the butt shoulder then 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.210
 there will be a more stable position 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.210
 set aside 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:24.909
 on the divisions that I do in battle 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:24.909
 do two 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:34.990
 set aside whole standing 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.990
 the battle 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.320
 set aside 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.720
 standing up fight 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:58.010
 for worked out to shooting moving 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:02:00.230
 the targets are very simple and quite 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:04.370
 effective exercise which shooter 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:08.530
 for training must perform up to 150 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:13.550
 200 times this wiring with aiming 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:15.590
 weapon on the line or on the tensioned cord 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:23.780
 it looks like this 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:28.420
 the way the shooter takes ready for 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:33.709
 initial shooting 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:36.350
 only the so-called and then having made 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:39.590
 6 takes combat stance and conducts 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:42.680
 tensioned weapon 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:46.550
 so that vibrations 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.630
 flies did not exceed did not go beyond 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:50.410
 limits of it 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.410
 cord 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:07.970
 here the shooter should immediately 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:10.690
 pay the next moment discounts and 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:14.239
 clicking on the hand is done already 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:19.880
 at the same time with turning the body 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:22.870
 as if moving along with moving 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.870
 the purpose 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:41.250
 shooter must perform in a row 15-20 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:43.890
 when laying with a short break and 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:46.440
 continue this exercise 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:49.080
 exactly the same exercise is done from 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:51.530
 with sniper rifle from sniper 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.530
 Dragunov rifles 

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:40.400
 learning from machines and 100 by 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:43.130
 moving target should start 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:45.140
 working off in discounts automata or svd and 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:48.080
 aiming sights 

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:50.870
 10 square by 10 centimeters by 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:52.960
 50 meters distance without wiring weapons 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:56.000
 performing this exercise you 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:58.760
 watch on the screen here is the result 5 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:02.900
 Shot offhand at a distance of 50 

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:06.530
 meters in white hit 1 2 3 4 hits 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:09.950
 and one single shot went down miss 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:12.650
 this way the shooter is prepared 

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:16.100
 for shooting offhand both mixed and 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:19.700
 gathering having achieved accuracy and shooting 

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:22.460
 the arrow is wired down 

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:25.540
 the meaning of this exercise is 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:28.880
 to get the trigger off the cocking 

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:32.150
 level fly through the square 10 by 10 

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:34.160
 centimeters without stopping the movement in 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:36.490
 the shooter proceeds to perform 

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:39.890
 exercises in shooting at a moving target 

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:41.930
 70 concerns time given to shooter 

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:45.200
 at idle shot with 

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:47.510
 wiring on a moving target next 

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:48.560
 Stage shooting gatherings at stills and 

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:53.750
 moving targets 

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:57.130
 features of the implementation of this new 

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:57.130
 weapons staff training
