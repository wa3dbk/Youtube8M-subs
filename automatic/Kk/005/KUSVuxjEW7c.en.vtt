 health and wellness medicine so the idea is to make the 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:18.800
 medicine 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.939
 within the reach of all understandable and above all achievable therefore rendering 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:25.939
 the mythical health structures of the health world 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.369

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.960
 what others think and above all I can receive answers from the sector 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:39.890
 health then 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.160
 healthcare facilities are just a communication tool 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.370
 world of medicine on the other side can 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.070
 will respond what patients say then a concept of transparency of 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:50.810
 availability of attention 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:54.900
 concretely demonstrated on the network and visible to all 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.410

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:58.530

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.710
 what it meant to you what 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.680
 it means to those who have to present their ideas to be among the thousand 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:10.290
 well i would like to say that for me it was a great thrill and was in a while a 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.039
 really important moment of my state then 

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:16.450
 moments when I needed support the most 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:21.070
 It was really important to have concrete help at the right time for those who want to 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:26.810
 enter the thousand I would say you have to bring out your passion to believe that there is 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.450
 you will make it believe in your dreams in your motions and knowledge 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.039
 that even if everyone tells me that things are impossible and who is feeling a 

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:39.850

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.990
 comment places retrieval 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.020
 enthusiasm and passion in the wind world I really think we have nothing 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.530
 to envy no one then anyone who wants you to have an idea to bring it 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.039

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.109
