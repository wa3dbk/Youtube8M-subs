00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:08.320
 I was looking for oriol romeu 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:19.070
 other losses of pereira jorge molina and 

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:23.330
 jorge molina shot jorge's goal 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:26.420
 molina 1 0 for the real betis took advantage 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:29.360
 jorge molina la pifia the gift of joao 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:31.910
 pereira satin pegadito al palo fuerza 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:34.640
 molina makes the 1-0 I think it has been 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:39.040
 even if we see this now but it is 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:41.330
 Of course I think I believe now we see it 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:44.630
 it is clear that those English passes 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:46.480
 very responsible in many passes 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:48.770
 times of goal because they are passes where 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.420
 they leave a lot of advantage up there what 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:53.059
 put it because why mania hits you very 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.890
 well very well frankly well it saves 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:56.210
 sevilla perfectly also not be 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.460
 here with trying Ricardo Ricardo 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.719
 post but very well the arrival 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.820
 de jorge molina leaves a ball in very 

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:02.899
 good condition 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.660
 I insist I have been even but in 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:08.270
 Any case are plays that you 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:10.550
 they break the work in some way from the 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.720
 team and the whole idea that you have the 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:13.190
 valencia well everything well the party what 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.200
 we are commenting but of course 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:17.270
 errors so 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.450
 Well, it does not lose the identity of 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:19.450
 who 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.060
 Portuguese or Portuguese joao pereira 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:30.800
 Jonas sensation retained the aluminum 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:34.980
 plus 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:37.530
 a decision next to the pass to give 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:39.570
 you go out betis fighting hard 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.830
 molina with matthew let's see what is 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.660
 flame slices of molina or leave behind 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:45.020
 yellow and pass right pretty 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.020
 Clear 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:55.020
 or buy back the valence was repositioned 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:55.020
 the matilla combines well with girls 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:01.380
 they do not buy the matilla 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:04.470
 again in juanfran that takes care of the 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:07.280
 Real Betis I will bring the frontal saves 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:12.140
 sevilla receives again for juanfran 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:14.720
 to salva sevilla that arm that golazo del 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:18.050
 Real Betis for the combination for the 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:20.870
 pause but for extreme patience and 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:23.120
 maximum precision that you have had with that 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:26.290
 series of passes of combinations the real 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:29.720
 betis has made a great goal a goal 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:32.180
 saves seville a watchmaker's precision 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.340
 swiss this betis play that player 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.230
 it looked like it was running out 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.670
 time and space to both of the 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.800
 three players that triangulated because 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.480
 there were many valencia players 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.910
 closing that position but nevertheless 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.260
 the movement is the buckles 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:46.970
 extraordinary then obviously also 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.610
 the pacific ate ​​that well turns 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:51.110
 immediately runs runs to space the 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.550
 perfect wall to impeccable definition 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:55.100
 is doing a great game saves 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:56.420
 Seville was working very well and the 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.470
 three players who has intervened but 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:02.280
 that have been vadillo juan fanning 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:05.310
 well of a ball bolazo jorge molina 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.750
 it was the final the last touch and a goal 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.040
 for a soccer player that I think I know 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.750
 I was deserving in a game I was 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.290
 being for me the best meeting the 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.349
 field of both friends 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:16.269
 Well, there you have your well-deserved prize 

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:18.969
 salva sevilla just done just 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:20.560
 raise the electronic 20 benito 

00:03:18.969 --> 00:03:27.660
 villamarín 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:27.660
 a public delivered two great goals 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.879
 wants to recover the hockey team 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:41.580
 the value is nacho 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:41.580
 in the real betis football 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:46.420
 you will know sevilla vadillo that finds 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:48.820
 room for maneuver and that the final here 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:52.210
 has that I'm going to be very quick to 

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:54.310
 the arrival of salva sevilla a robbery tie 

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:55.660
 of real Betis as it is filtered as 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:57.319
 knife in butter saves seville 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:59.269
 rear 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:02.049
 is that he is the best player there is 

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:04.010
 the field by far is a match 

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:06.260
 extraordinary salva sevilla I think that 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:08.139
 not as a party that I have seen that weighs 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:10.670
 h 35 minutes of football 

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:13.340
 magnificent magnificently very well vadillo 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:15.230
 very fast very fast finding a 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:16.820
 hollow to pass it saves seville but 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:18.919
 is that salva sevilla started the play 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:21.259
 he has managed to run to that space that 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:23.330
 he left ricardo costa to go to the help with 

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:26.030
 joao pereira to cover up for 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:27.699
 today we see it look how it is introduced in 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:30.620
 that space fantastically and then 

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:33.390
 very well defines great match 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:35.220
 sevilla great Betis match 

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:37.610
 accompanied by love and being able to be 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.610
 tied 

00:04:37.659 --> 00:04:45.169
 and everything perfect in the pepe mel team 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:47.090
 33 could be four because we come from 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:48.230
 two parameters in which he had two clear 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:50.060
 and own 

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:52.460
 let's really first answer us 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:54.430
 then the salva sevilla the bad 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:57.430
 places 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:59.200
 practically without looking that well too 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:01.690
 he stands out and finds that gap as 

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:03.400
 read that without ricardo costs it has gone to 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:04.810
 the band that's where there can be a 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:07.720
 hollow that only I had to have read 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:09.850
 mate before a partner leaves the 

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:11.740
 I have to occupy his band with his 

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:16.140
 position neither bernad which is the lateral the 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:16.140
 mine no but the defense has not run 

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:21.420
 and in valence to close spaces and if 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:23.070
 he has found them are the seeds 

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:25.410
 will carry it for what it is taking 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:28.710
 to Valencian in these 35 minutes and 

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:30.180
 half of the first half 303 goals as 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:32.270
 three suns that has marked the real 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:32.270
 betis 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:36.470
 it was my father because for him
