makes<00:01:27.869> it<00:01:27.990> easier<00:01:28.320> for<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:29.070> book<00:01:29.670> to<00:01:29.790> come<00:01:29.909> out

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
makes it easier for the book to come out

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:35.359

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
look at the size itself should do a

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.140 
look at the size itself should do a
side-by-side<00:01:39.000> comparison<00:01:39.950> with<00:01:40.950> a<00:01:41.150> never
