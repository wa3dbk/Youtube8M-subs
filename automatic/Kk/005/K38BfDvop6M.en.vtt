that's the reason for the yellow flag
and<00:04:49.950> all<00:04:50.340> these<00:04:50.520> yellows<00:04:50.910> are<00:04:51.030> going<00:04:51.180> to<00:04:51.270> use

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:51.360 
and all these yellows are going to use

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.620 
and all these yellows are going to use
more<00:04:51.660> fuel<00:04:51.720> and<00:04:52.440> they're<00:04:52.590> gonna<00:04:52.680> make<00:04:53.370> a<00:04:53.630> much

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:54.630 
more fuel and they're gonna make a much

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:56.480 
more fuel and they're gonna make a much
harder<00:04:54.870> wear<00:04:55.200> on<00:04:55.500> the<00:04:55.680> engines<00:04:56.010> the<00:04:56.220> attrition

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:56.490 
harder wear on the engines the attrition

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:59.750 
harder wear on the engines the attrition
rate<00:04:56.640> should<00:04:57.120> be<00:04:57.620> tremendous<00:04:58.620> now<00:04:59.520> they're

00:04:59.750 --> 00:04:59.760 
rate should be tremendous now they're

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:01.730 
rate should be tremendous now they're

called pace lights let me try and
explain<00:05:33.000> what<00:05:33.600> they<00:05:33.750> are<00:05:33.950> there<00:05:34.950> are<00:05:35.100> eight<00:05:35.310> of

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:35.340 
explain what they are there are eight of

explain what they are there are eight of
those<00:05:35.760> piece<00:05:36.180> of<00:05:36.420> lights<00:05:36.630> around<00:05:36.960> the

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:37.110 
those piece of lights around the

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:39.200 
those piece of lights around the
racetrack<00:05:37.650> when<00:05:37.860> the<00:05:37.980> driver<00:05:38.220> passes<00:05:38.880> a<00:05:38.910> piece

of<00:05:39.390> light<00:05:39.540> if<00:05:39.780> for<00:05:39.990> example<00:05:40.530> number<00:05:40.680> two<00:05:41.100> is<00:05:41.310> up

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:41.460 
of light if for example number two is up

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:43.760 
of light if for example number two is up
there<00:05:41.760> he<00:05:42.390> should<00:05:42.630> reach<00:05:42.840> the<00:05:42.870> next<00:05:43.290> pacer

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:43.770 
there he should reach the next pacer

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:46.400 
there he should reach the next pacer
light<00:05:43.950> which<00:05:44.130> is<00:05:44.480> 1,600<00:05:45.480> feet<00:05:45.720> along<00:05:46.050> the<00:05:46.230> road

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:46.410 
light which is 1,600 feet along the road

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:48.950 
light which is 1,600 feet along the road
and<00:05:46.620> still<00:05:46.920> see<00:05:47.280> number<00:05:47.790> two<00:05:47.820> if<00:05:48.480> for<00:05:48.930> example

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:48.960 
and still see number two if for example

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:51.590 
and still see number two if for example
he<00:05:49.470> sees<00:05:49.740> number<00:05:50.130> three<00:05:50.400> up<00:05:50.610> there<00:05:50.640> it<00:05:51.300> means

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:51.600 
he sees number three up there it means

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:53.780 
he sees number three up there it means
that<00:05:52.110> he's<00:05:52.260> going<00:05:52.290> too<00:05:52.740> slowly<00:05:53.070> if<00:05:53.490> on<00:05:53.670> the

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:53.790 
that he's going too slowly if on the

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:56.000 
that he's going too slowly if on the
other<00:05:53.940> hand<00:05:54.210> he<00:05:54.330> sees<00:05:54.540> number<00:05:54.960> one<00:05:55.230> it<00:05:55.680> means

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:56.010 
other hand he sees number one it means

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:58.250 
other hand he sees number one it means
that<00:05:56.280> he's<00:05:56.400> going<00:05:56.610> too<00:05:56.940> quickly<00:05:57.210> so<00:05:57.570> it's<00:05:58.050> this

00:05:58.250 --> 00:05:58.260 
that he's going too quickly so it's this

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.380 
that he's going too quickly so it's this
way<00:05:58.590> or<00:05:58.950> normally<00:05:59.400> this<00:05:59.580> way<00:05:59.790> that<00:06:00.000> he<00:06:00.030> knows

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:00.390 
way or normally this way that he knows

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:02.390 
way or normally this way that he knows
if<00:06:00.660> he's<00:06:00.810> traveling<00:06:01.350> at<00:06:01.470> the<00:06:01.560> right<00:06:01.740> pace<00:06:02.040> and

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:02.400 
if he's traveling at the right pace and

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:05.120 
if he's traveling at the right pace and
this<00:06:02.820> obviously<00:06:03.600> helps<00:06:03.960> him<00:06:04.230> to<00:06:04.440> keep<00:06:04.650> the<00:06:04.860> gap

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:05.130 
this obviously helps him to keep the gap

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:07.910 
this obviously helps him to keep the gap
behind<00:06:05.760> the<00:06:06.360> car<00:06:06.600> in<00:06:06.780> front<00:06:06.990> of<00:06:07.230> them<00:06:07.410> to<00:06:07.800> the

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:07.920 
behind the car in front of them to the

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:10.340 
behind the car in front of them to the
prescribed<00:06:08.460> distance<00:06:09.060> the<00:06:09.600> officials<00:06:10.110> here

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:10.350 
prescribed distance the officials here

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:12.320 
prescribed distance the officials here
feel<00:06:10.680> this<00:06:11.070> is<00:06:11.280> the<00:06:11.310> method<00:06:11.820> that<00:06:11.970> they<00:06:12.120> can

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:12.330 
feel this is the method that they can

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:14.270 
feel this is the method that they can
use<00:06:12.540> to<00:06:12.570> keep<00:06:12.960> these<00:06:13.170> cars<00:06:13.500> going<00:06:13.860> around<00:06:14.130> the

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:14.280 
use to keep these cars going around the

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:16.400 
use to keep these cars going around the
track<00:06:14.430> at<00:06:14.850> 80<00:06:15.210> miles<00:06:15.660> an<00:06:15.900> hour

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:16.410 
track at 80 miles an hour

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:17.870 
track at 80 miles an hour
because<00:06:16.830> that's<00:06:17.100> the<00:06:17.310> figure<00:06:17.490> that<00:06:17.760> they

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:17.880 
because that's the figure that they

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:19.730 
because that's the figure that they
consider<00:06:18.300> to<00:06:18.390> be<00:06:18.540> safe<00:06:18.930> while<00:06:19.230> emergency

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:19.740 
consider to be safe while emergency

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:21.620 
consider to be safe while emergency
crews<00:06:19.890> are<00:06:20.400> perhaps<00:06:20.700> walking<00:06:21.390> on<00:06:21.510> the

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:21.630 
crews are perhaps walking on the

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:29.820 
means that if any driver goes too fast

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:31.340 
means that if any driver goes too fast
he<00:06:30.210> will<00:06:30.390> be<00:06:30.540> penalized

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:31.350 
he will be penalized

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:33.440 
he will be penalized
of<00:06:31.500> course<00:06:31.830> it's<00:06:32.310> extremely<00:06:32.610> difficult<00:06:33.090> to

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:33.450 
of course it's extremely difficult to

police such a regulation and this is

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:38.000 
police such a regulation and this is
what<00:06:36.570> the<00:06:36.690> officials<00:06:37.140> have<00:06:37.320> to<00:06:37.470> try<00:06:37.680> to<00:06:37.740> do

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:38.010 
what the officials have to try to do
