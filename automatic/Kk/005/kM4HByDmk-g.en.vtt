00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.650
 Hi girls, how are you 

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:17.560
 Today I'm here to show you the 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:19.150
 my davut nail polish 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.310
 just launched 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:23.470
 fifty-six colors they announced 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:27.340
 For us at beauty fair it was all 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:30.190
 world soon for the bad and then six 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:32.860
 months if they are here with the 

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:34.680
 So I bought some colors and 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:37.270
 I brought some more from my sister too. 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:41.500
 because for you the best for you but 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:43.810
 so not so much varieties, but it's the 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:46.329
 We got our first first school. 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:49.510
 so the first one I chose was 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:50.470
 catching wave that is this very bug 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:52.719
 cute 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:55.300
 I spent two very generous layers 

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:57.430
 because of course in the hands a little 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:00.969
 but only in the end I ended up 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:03.340
 repenting the little foxes because the 

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:06.340
 finish to make the team was very 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:08.979
 Thick and not very cool I think 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:12.130
 that three thinner layers do not something 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:14.950
 more delay but the time will be more 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:18.069
 beautiful then the cure is beautiful for summer 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:20.259
 It looks great and is super pretty happy so 

00:01:18.069 --> 00:01:22.240
 knows how phishing and such 

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:26.859
 another color that is my sister's actually 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:30.159
 It's the cinema he's good and he's kind of 

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:32.439
 more rooms knows that 2015 agreement or 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:34.659
 slow through the pantone knows a little bit 

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:35.499
 the clearer you know how to load a little bit 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:37.420
 any less 

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:39.630
 so it looks beautiful to whoever is more 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:43.389
 discreet person works in a more 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:46.779
 formal that is a more upscale nail 

00:01:43.389 --> 00:01:49.329
 something like that take to fight 

00:01:46.779 --> 00:01:54.110
 I think it's a joker and he looks gorgeous 

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:56.930
 nail on me I think I would do it again 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:02:00.410
 You, but my sister is in love and 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:03.020
 water covered super well with two layers and 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:05.330
 were perfect coverage very good and 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.520
 I really liked it and talk it and I 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.830
 I chose a rosy that is the doll of 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:13.430
 cloth that is an enamel as well 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:16.040
 Little girl is onerous, I think. 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:19.340
 we can call it so it is very 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:22.190
 cute and just like the greyhound fan 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:25.520
 He is more a little because the color is for him. 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:27.830
 be more pastel and I used in him three layers 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.840
 thinner and again it was much more 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.340
 easy to do on the leg next to the 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.070
 cuticle and such 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.660
 so I'm quite liked it 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:38.989
 leaving what I liked best 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:42.650
 There were a lot of people until tomorrow. 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:44.720
 the monsoon is not any good and I asked her 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:48.290
 buy one for me to have a good time 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:50.959
 pigmented and more open there then it is 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:53.630
 because it had many shades of 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:55.970
 red and they were very similar to 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:58.880
 Lighting is a very cool guy and will 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:01.370
 very confused to be what I wanted and any 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:03.980
 law then question two as soon as it was 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:07.040
 until I passed at the same time one each node 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:09.230
 and it's time to film for you the scenes 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.510
 I confused at first to the teeth 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:14.150
 movie because it started to confuse 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:16.910
 which is not something had blond 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:20.180
 so because in fact they are very 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:24.049
 resembling red fruits 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:25.180
 it is a first more open drawn pro 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:29.150
 cherry 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:31.970
 already the red and also the red open 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:35.069
 about drawn to orange as 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:38.400
 differences from one hand to another 1 to 5 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:41.129
 It 's minimal, it's a little more 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:44.670
 she already the other a little cherry and the two 

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:47.129
 are welcome in the enamelling range o 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:52.469
 which I liked anyway I said our 

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:54.930
 This tap fed and ours is what gives 

00:03:52.469 --> 00:03:56.730
 to make no art the joker what gives 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:00.299
 to heat the environment is too fast 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:02.189
 was the fruit of the first layer socks is 

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:03.180
 what the second coverage got 

00:04:02.189 --> 00:04:05.999
 perfect 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:08.819
 the brazier I found a little bit more 

00:04:05.999 --> 00:04:11.099
 if it were day-to-day I would have 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:14.069
 past the third call 

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:17.519
 only with two but mainly so I 

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:19.549
 I thought you gave a little love 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:22.580
 or decreases the nail to the tip of the nail 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:27.479
 where salmon school 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:30.419
 It differs there anyway so it's beautiful and 

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:33.660
 I think that permeate all the time 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:36.780
 had and of course I really loved the 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:41.849
 Nail I loved the quality of the glaze and 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:45.690
 nor his pigment was the ballad party 

00:04:41.849 --> 00:04:48.330
 want a very dark pearly blue he 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:52.830
 Brazil, so there are stars, not mine. 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:55.530
 You know, girls, pass a layer on you. 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:59.449
 you see in the video is a layer to 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:05:02.449
 coverage was perfect ease in having 

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:02.449
 difficulty 

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:09.659
 then the enamel or to take the 

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:13.860
 Corners was super cool Blue people 

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:16.710
 Beautiful marine this way with a shed 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:18.990
 It's very difficult for the little guy who 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:21.990
 accompanies for some time knows that I am 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:25.289
 in love blue and this one for sure 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:27.779
 is one of the tops sure to ride 

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:29.370
 others these attentive and stamped youths 

00:05:27.779 --> 00:05:31.860
 with them so I think it gives to fall 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:33.029
 so because his income is 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:35.479
 Perfect 

00:05:33.029 --> 00:05:38.520
 My mother needed a 

00:05:35.479 --> 00:05:40.949
 work so she bought this care if she 

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:43.740
 color enhancer which is an extra 

00:05:40.949 --> 00:05:46.680
 I glowed red and I stepped over the 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:49.620
 party ballad and further enhanced the 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:51.539
 kick brighter and more alive 

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:54.449
 In the middle I can not speak to 

00:05:51.539 --> 00:05:56.309
 you of the probability of the wicked in 

00:05:54.449 --> 00:05:58.710
 childhood glow because I did not like it 

00:05:56.309 --> 00:06:00.930
 Long time I just tried to show it to you. 

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:03.360
 Are you crazy about lancenet too? 

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:06.089
 so I did not end up with any 

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:08.520
 on the nail but will soon have a review 

00:06:06.089 --> 00:06:10.770
 separated from each name I really wanted 

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:13.680
 show things to you what have been 

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:17.039
 My first choices for Vult 

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:19.409
 to have your crazy to buy a nude 

00:06:17.039 --> 00:06:20.879
 because they have a pretty cool cartel of 

00:06:19.409 --> 00:06:23.219
 far away in other things that I 

00:06:20.879 --> 00:06:26.039
 I was imagining it because I see it very dark. 

00:06:23.219 --> 00:06:26.819
 also has for the beautiful colors and this 

00:06:26.039 --> 00:06:32.999

 the enamel to the people with the handle 14 and 59 56 

00:06:32.999 --> 00:06:37.740
 Choices for 4 59 Can not Buy 

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:41.219
 almost none because it goes bankrupt 

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:43.409
 are still slowly buying 

00:06:41.219 --> 00:06:47.370
