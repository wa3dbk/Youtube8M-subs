00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:03.000 
what's happening so these are apple

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.749 
what's happening so these are apple
trees<00:00:03.270> we're<00:00:03.959> gonna<00:00:04.080> plant<00:00:04.350> today<00:00:04.549> these<00:00:05.549> are

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
trees we're gonna plant today these are

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:07.940 
trees we're gonna plant today these are
called<00:00:06.000> columnar<00:00:06.600> apple<00:00:06.930> trees<00:00:07.140> so<00:00:07.710> as<00:00:07.830> you

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
called columnar apple trees so as you

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:09.709 
called columnar apple trees so as you
can<00:00:08.069> tell<00:00:08.250> they<00:00:08.400> look<00:00:08.550> kind<00:00:08.700> of<00:00:08.730> funny<00:00:09.000> they're

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
can tell they look kind of funny they're

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:11.600 
can tell they look kind of funny they're
just<00:00:09.960> one<00:00:10.139> central<00:00:10.590> column<00:00:10.980> and<00:00:11.280> this<00:00:11.429> is<00:00:11.580> a

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
just one central column and this is a

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.759 
just one central column and this is a
great<00:00:11.849> tree<00:00:12.120> for<00:00:12.480> people<00:00:13.349> who<00:00:13.410> don't<00:00:13.559> have<00:00:13.650> a

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
great tree for people who don't have a

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:15.560 
great tree for people who don't have a
lot<00:00:13.950> of<00:00:13.980> room<00:00:14.250> this<00:00:14.610> is<00:00:14.759> a<00:00:14.790> dwarf<00:00:15.120> variety

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
lot of room this is a dwarf variety

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.010 
lot of room this is a dwarf variety
grows<00:00:16.199> about<00:00:16.379> eight<00:00:16.529> to<00:00:16.650> twelve<00:00:16.740> feet<00:00:17.130> and

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:18.020 
grows about eight to twelve feet and

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:20.660 
grows about eight to twelve feet and
it'll<00:00:19.020> grow<00:00:19.230> just<00:00:19.500> like<00:00:19.619> this<00:00:19.890> straight<00:00:20.490> up

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
it'll grow just like this straight up

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.060 
it'll grow just like this straight up
and<00:00:21.000> the<00:00:21.930> branches<00:00:22.320> only<00:00:22.560> come<00:00:22.710> out<00:00:22.800> about

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
and the branches only come out about

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.060 
and the branches only come out about
maybe<00:00:23.730> a<00:00:23.850> foot<00:00:24.180> at<00:00:24.300> the<00:00:24.330> most<00:00:24.630> so<00:00:25.590> the<00:00:25.830> fruit

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
maybe a foot at the most so the fruit

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.099 
maybe a foot at the most so the fruit
will<00:00:26.279> just<00:00:26.490> set<00:00:27.119> itself<00:00:27.390> on<00:00:27.630> either<00:00:27.750> side<00:00:28.080> of

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
will just set itself on either side of

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.169 
will just set itself on either side of
that<00:00:28.230> over<00:00:29.039> the<00:00:29.220> main<00:00:29.340> trunk<00:00:29.670> going<00:00:29.939> all<00:00:30.090> the

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
that over the main trunk going all the

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.020 
that over the main trunk going all the
way<00:00:30.210> up<00:00:30.300> so<00:00:30.630> for<00:00:30.990> people<00:00:31.320> a<00:00:31.740> lack<00:00:32.250> of<00:00:32.279> space<00:00:32.489> or

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
way up so for people a lack of space or

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.209 
way up so for people a lack of space or
you<00:00:33.960> know<00:00:34.079> I'll<00:00:34.440> worry<00:00:34.649> about<00:00:34.739> having<00:00:35.070> a<00:00:35.190> big

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
you know I'll worry about having a big

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.639 
you know I'll worry about having a big
tree<00:00:35.730> this<00:00:35.969> is<00:00:36.090> a<00:00:36.120> great<00:00:36.329> tree<00:00:36.510> to<00:00:36.570> have<00:00:36.780> so

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
tree this is a great tree to have so

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:38.660 
tree this is a great tree to have so
we're<00:00:37.770> just<00:00:37.800> gonna<00:00:37.950> come<00:00:38.190> over<00:00:38.370> here<00:00:38.489> I<00:00:38.520> have

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
we're just gonna come over here I have

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.459 
we're just gonna come over here I have
some<00:00:38.730> treed<00:00:39.030> some<00:00:39.480> pre<00:00:39.629> dug<00:00:39.809> holes<00:00:40.110> we're<00:00:40.350> just

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
some treed some pre dug holes we're just

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:47.450 
some treed some pre dug holes we're just
gonna<00:00:40.559> set<00:00:40.800> him<00:00:40.860> in<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.040> hole<00:00:46.039> so<00:00:47.039> I<00:00:47.100> took<00:00:47.190> most

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
gonna set him in the hole so I took most

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.729 
gonna set him in the hole so I took most
of<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:47.640> dirt<00:00:47.820> out<00:00:48.000> of<00:00:48.120> here<00:00:48.300> this<00:00:48.660> was<00:00:48.840> just<00:00:49.079> it

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
of the dirt out of here this was just it

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.470 
of the dirt out of here this was just it
was<00:00:49.829> a<00:00:49.890> heavy<00:00:50.039> clay<00:00:50.309> and<00:00:51.000> so<00:00:51.149> we're<00:00:51.270> gonna<00:00:51.390> use

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
was a heavy clay and so we're gonna use

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.549 
was a heavy clay and so we're gonna use
some<00:00:52.100> composted<00:00:53.100> soil<00:00:53.129> we<00:00:53.520> got<00:00:53.670> yesterday<00:00:54.559> so

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
some composted soil we got yesterday so

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:02.049 
some composted soil we got yesterday so
we're<00:00:55.680> just<00:00:55.710> gonna<00:00:55.949> simply<00:00:56.190> fill<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.550> hole

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:02.059 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:05.630 

spread<00:01:03.059> out<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.329> dirt<00:01:04.040> and<00:01:05.040> this<00:01:05.220> tree<00:01:05.489> is

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
spread out the dirt and this tree is

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.490 
spread out the dirt and this tree is
grafted<00:01:06.180> this<00:01:06.360> is<00:01:06.479> grandpa<00:01:07.170> down<00:01:07.260> to<00:01:07.470> a

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
grafted this is grandpa down to a

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.710 
grafted this is grandpa down to a
rootstock<00:01:08.000> which<00:01:09.000> means<00:01:09.210> that<00:01:09.420> they<00:01:09.540> took

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
rootstock which means that they took

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.030 
rootstock which means that they took
this<00:01:09.900> branch<00:01:10.140> off<00:01:10.320> another<00:01:10.530> tree<00:01:10.830> and<00:01:10.979> they

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
this branch off another tree and they

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.280 
this branch off another tree and they
grafted<00:01:11.340> onto<00:01:11.640> a<00:01:11.790> root<00:01:11.970> stock<00:01:12.270> so<00:01:13.080> what<00:01:13.200> could

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
grafted onto a root stock so what could

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.710 
grafted onto a root stock so what could
growing<00:01:13.680> up<00:01:13.830> probably<00:01:14.270> either<00:01:15.270> a<00:01:15.390> colder

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
growing up probably either a colder

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:16.670 
growing up probably either a colder
climate<00:01:15.750> or<00:01:16.290> it'd<00:01:16.409> be<00:01:16.500> more

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
climate or it'd be more

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.490 
climate or it'd be more
disease-resistant<00:01:17.640> and<00:01:17.759> Nikita<00:01:18.500> planting

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
disease-resistant and Nikita planting

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.410 
disease-resistant and Nikita planting
anything<00:01:19.799> with<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:19.979> root<00:01:20.130> stock<00:01:20.310> is<00:01:20.549> you

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
anything with the root stock is you

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.300 
anything with the root stock is you
can't<00:01:21.720> go<00:01:21.930> above<00:01:22.259> where<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:22.560> graft<00:01:22.770> line<00:01:23.070> is

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
can't go above where the graft line is

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.020 
can't go above where the graft line is
with<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.729> soil<00:01:24.000> otherwise<00:01:24.840> you<00:01:25.080> risk<00:01:25.229> having

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
with the soil otherwise you risk having

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.249 
with the soil otherwise you risk having
this<00:01:27.030> is<00:01:27.210> called<00:01:27.390> a<00:01:27.479> Scion<00:01:27.900> and<00:01:27.930> you<00:01:28.170> would

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
this is called a Scion and you would

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.490 
this is called a Scion and you would
risk<00:01:28.439> having<00:01:29.210> the<00:01:30.210> Scion<00:01:30.570> grow<00:01:30.840> roots<00:01:31.110> which

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
risk having the Scion grow roots which

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.289 
risk having the Scion grow roots which
would<00:01:31.680> defeat<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.220> purpose<00:01:32.340> of<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:32.970> food

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
would defeat the purpose of the food

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.880 
would defeat the purpose of the food
stock<00:01:33.740> so<00:01:34.740> we'll<00:01:34.920> just<00:01:35.040> put<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.280> soil<00:01:35.490> in<00:01:35.640> here

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
stock so we'll just put the soil in here

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.990 
stock so we'll just put the soil in here
firm<00:01:37.890> it<00:01:38.009> down<00:01:40.009> so<00:01:41.009> as<00:01:41.130> you<00:01:41.220> can<00:01:41.369> see<00:01:41.579> this<00:01:41.820> is

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
firm it down so as you can see this is

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.940 
firm it down so as you can see this is
this<00:01:42.810> is<00:01:42.869> where<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.140> graft<00:01:43.439> is<00:01:43.619> right<00:01:43.799> here

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
this is where the graft is right here

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.249 
this is where the graft is right here
where<00:01:44.070> this<00:01:44.130> knot<00:01:44.399> is<00:01:44.659> on<00:01:45.659> the<00:01:45.840> bottom<00:01:46.079> of<00:01:46.170> this

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
where this knot is on the bottom of this

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:47.530 
where this knot is on the bottom of this
apple<00:01:46.590> tree

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:47.540 
apple tree

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.210 
apple tree
so<00:01:48.540> we<00:01:48.659> firm<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.079> soil<00:01:49.200> down<00:01:49.470> steen<00:01:49.890> below

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
so we firm the soil down steen below

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:56.840 
so we firm the soil down steen below
that<00:01:50.430> knot<00:01:53.659> and<00:01:54.659> that's<00:01:55.530> really<00:01:55.920> about<00:01:56.159> it<00:01:56.219> as

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
that knot and that's really about it as

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.130 
that knot and that's really about it as
simple<00:01:57.180> as<00:01:57.299> that
