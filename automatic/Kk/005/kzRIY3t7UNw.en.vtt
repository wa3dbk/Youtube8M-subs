the front wheel right there

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.920 
the front wheel right there
but<00:01:11.010> it's<00:01:11.430> a<00:01:11.490> nice<00:01:11.670> size<00:01:11.939> and<00:01:11.970> pretty<00:01:12.479> accurate

but it's a nice size and pretty accurate
to<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.369> scale<00:01:14.369> used<00:01:14.670> in<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:15.030> show<00:01:15.210> and<00:01:16.049> here

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
to the scale used in the show and here

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.100 
to the scale used in the show and here
is<00:01:16.710> mock<00:01:17.430> up<00:01:17.759> he<00:01:18.060> just<00:01:18.270> felt<00:01:18.509> alright<00:01:18.780> so<00:01:18.960> right

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
is mock up he just felt alright so right

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.780 
is mock up he just felt alright so right
off<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.229> bat<00:01:19.350> ATM<00:01:19.710> I<00:01:19.740> say<00:01:19.920> I'm<00:01:20.040> a<00:01:20.070> pretty<00:01:20.520> big

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
off the bat ATM I say I'm a pretty big

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.719 
off the bat ATM I say I'm a pretty big
fan<00:01:21.030> of<00:01:21.060> mocks<00:01:21.450> design<00:01:21.900> it's<00:01:22.229> pretty<00:01:22.560> neat<00:01:22.979> I

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
fan of mocks design it's pretty neat I

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.850 
fan of mocks design it's pretty neat I
like<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.450> color<00:01:24.689> scheme<00:01:24.869> he's<00:01:25.170> got<00:01:25.350> going<00:01:25.619> on

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
like the color scheme he's got going on

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.830 
like the color scheme he's got going on
so<00:01:26.220> I<00:01:26.250> don't<00:01:26.580> really<00:01:26.700> have<00:01:26.880> any<00:01:27.060> problems<00:01:27.689> with

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
so I don't really have any problems with

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.109 
so I don't really have any problems with
this<00:01:27.930> design<00:01:28.320> I<00:01:28.350> think<00:01:28.500> it's<00:01:28.770> kind<00:01:28.950> of<00:01:28.979> cool<00:01:29.159> it

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
this design I think it's kind of cool it

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.179 
this design I think it's kind of cool it
has<00:01:30.270> a<00:01:30.329> little<00:01:30.570> scarf<00:01:30.990> back<00:01:31.380> here<00:01:31.740> it<00:01:31.860> is<00:01:31.890> just

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
has a little scarf back here it is just

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.460 
has a little scarf back here it is just
connected<00:01:32.670> through<00:01:32.939> a<00:01:33.210> little<00:01:33.900> ball<00:01:34.140> joint

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
connected through a little ball joint

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.700 
connected through a little ball joint
just<00:01:35.009> like<00:01:35.130> a<00:01:35.280> lot<00:01:36.000> of<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.350> double<00:01:37.350> figures

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
just like a lot of the double figures

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.039 
just like a lot of the double figures
and<00:01:38.180> such<00:01:39.180> like<00:01:39.450> that

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
and such like that

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.899 
and such like that
so<00:01:40.619> you<00:01:40.710> just<00:01:40.829> pop<00:01:41.009> that<00:01:41.070> in<00:01:41.430> it<00:01:41.549> does<00:01:41.700> allow

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
so you just pop that in it does allow

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.700 
so you just pop that in it does allow
for<00:01:41.939> a<00:01:42.180> little<00:01:42.420> bit<00:01:42.570> of<00:01:42.689> movement<00:01:42.899> so<00:01:43.560> if<00:01:43.649> you

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
for a little bit of movement so if you

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.319 
for a little bit of movement so if you
want<00:01:43.890> like<00:01:44.040> a<00:01:44.070> little<00:01:44.220> bit<00:01:44.640> of<00:01:44.729> a<00:01:44.820> blowing<00:01:45.240> in

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
want like a little bit of a blowing in

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.630 
want like a little bit of a blowing in
the<00:01:45.420> wind<00:01:45.560> sort<00:01:46.560> of<00:01:46.680> pose<00:01:46.860> you<00:01:47.040> can<00:01:47.310> pull<00:01:47.610> that

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
the wind sort of pose you can pull that

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.649 
the wind sort of pose you can pull that
off<00:01:47.899> as<00:01:48.899> well<00:01:49.200> as<00:01:49.500> maneuvering<00:01:50.250> it<00:01:50.369> down<00:01:50.670> so

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
off as well as maneuvering it down so

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.490 
off as well as maneuvering it down so
that<00:01:51.780> it's<00:01:51.990> just<00:01:52.790> hanging<00:01:53.790> out<00:01:53.880> on<00:01:53.939> his<00:01:54.240> back

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 
that it's just hanging out on his back

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.469 
that it's just hanging out on his back
so<00:01:55.500> pretty<00:01:56.159> cool<00:01:56.399> there<00:01:56.670> here<00:01:56.939> is<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.119> little

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
so pretty cool there here is the little

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.999 
so pretty cool there here is the little
signal<00:01:58.079> it<00:01:58.380> does<00:01:58.649> spin<00:01:59.520> quite<00:02:00.479> well<00:02:00.719> and<00:02:01.710> of

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
signal it does spin quite well and of

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.270 
signal it does spin quite well and of
course<00:02:02.040> you<00:02:02.969> can't<00:02:03.240> have<00:02:03.329> mock<00:02:03.719> without<00:02:04.290> his

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
course you can't have mock without his

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.249 
course you can't have mock without his
visor<00:02:05.490> flipping<00:02:06.180> up<00:02:06.329> because<00:02:06.659> that<00:02:06.810> is<00:02:07.020> his

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
visor flipping up because that is his

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.949 
visor flipping up because that is his
cool<00:02:07.500> little<00:02:07.710> suit<00:02:08.369> feature<00:02:08.610> that<00:02:09.420> I<00:02:09.479> really

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
cool little suit feature that I really

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.160 
cool little suit feature that I really
like<00:02:10.790> it's<00:02:11.790> just<00:02:12.120> really<00:02:12.420> neat<00:02:12.750> we<00:02:12.930> haven't

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
like it's just really neat we haven't

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.850 
like it's just really neat we haven't
really<00:02:13.260> had<00:02:13.470> any

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
really had any

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.880 
really had any
writers<00:02:14.190> that<00:02:15.150> I<00:02:15.180> recall<00:02:15.630> that<00:02:15.810> that<00:02:16.320> did

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
writers that I recall that that did

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.830 
writers that I recall that that did
something<00:02:17.280> like<00:02:17.400> that<00:02:17.670> so<00:02:18.240> it's<00:02:18.390> pretty<00:02:18.630> cool

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
something like that so it's pretty cool

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.510 
something like that so it's pretty cool
and<00:02:19.080> really<00:02:19.320> captures<00:02:19.800> the<00:02:19.980> whole<00:02:20.160> feel<00:02:20.490> of

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
and really captures the whole feel of

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.000 
and really captures the whole feel of
his<00:02:20.940> motorcycle<00:02:21.690> motif<00:02:22.050> so<00:02:22.320> I<00:02:22.350> really<00:02:22.800> dig

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
his motorcycle motif so I really dig

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.730 
his motorcycle motif so I really dig
that<00:02:23.360> if<00:02:24.360> you<00:02:24.510> press<00:02:24.720> it<00:02:24.870> up<00:02:24.960> too<00:02:25.170> far<00:02:25.410> it<00:02:25.560> does

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
that if you press it up too far it does

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.830 
that if you press it up too far it does
have<00:02:25.890> tendencies<00:02:26.430> to<00:02:26.640> pop<00:02:26.880> out<00:02:27.120> at<00:02:27.360> least<00:02:27.540> mine

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
have tendencies to pop out at least mine

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.600 
have tendencies to pop out at least mine
does<00:02:28.110> that<00:02:28.680> might<00:02:28.890> be<00:02:29.040> a<00:02:29.070> your<00:02:29.280> mileage<00:02:29.580> may

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
does that might be a your mileage may

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.970 
does that might be a your mileage may
vary<00:02:29.790> sort<00:02:30.390> of<00:02:30.510> issue<00:02:30.930> though<00:02:31.350> so<00:02:31.920> I<00:02:31.950> don't

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
vary sort of issue though so I don't

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.150 
vary sort of issue though so I don't
really<00:02:32.280> want<00:02:32.460> to<00:02:32.520> call<00:02:32.700> it<00:02:32.850> an<00:02:33.000> issue<00:02:33.560> I<00:02:34.560> don't

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
really want to call it an issue I don't

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.380 
really want to call it an issue I don't
really<00:02:35.340> have<00:02:35.610> too<00:02:35.790> many<00:02:35.850> problems<00:02:36.030> he<00:02:36.300> was

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
really have too many problems he was

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.360 
really have too many problems he was
very<00:02:36.570> plain<00:02:36.900> from<00:02:37.110> the<00:02:37.140> back<00:02:37.410> he<00:02:38.070> doesn't

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
very plain from the back he doesn't

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.660 
very plain from the back he doesn't
quite<00:02:38.490> have<00:02:38.550> that<00:02:38.760> same<00:02:39.330> sort<00:02:39.750> of<00:02:40.670> undercard

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
quite have that same sort of undercard

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.230 
quite have that same sort of undercard
detail<00:02:42.209> that<00:02:42.860> drive<00:02:43.860> does<00:02:44.220> so<00:02:44.940> he<00:02:45.030> is<00:02:45.150> very

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.240 
detail that drive does so he is very

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.240 
detail that drive does so he is very
much<00:02:45.510> plain<00:02:45.990> from<00:02:46.200> the<00:02:46.230> back<00:02:46.530> but<00:02:46.770> the<00:02:46.860> belt<00:02:47.070> is

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
much plain from the back but the belt is

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.340 
much plain from the back but the belt is
painted<00:02:47.670> in<00:02:47.880> sculpted<00:02:48.690> pretty<00:02:48.930> nice<00:02:49.110> back

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
painted in sculpted pretty nice back

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.800 
painted in sculpted pretty nice back
there<00:02:49.620> big<00:02:50.459> ol<00:02:50.610> blue<00:02:50.940> mock<00:02:51.270> driving<00:02:51.690> right

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
there big ol blue mock driving right

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.500 
there big ol blue mock driving right
there<00:02:52.020> no<00:02:52.260> details<00:02:52.770> so<00:02:53.400> everything<00:02:54.090> is<00:02:54.300> more

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
there no details so everything is more

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.140 
there no details so everything is more
or<00:02:54.630> less<00:02:54.660> pretty<00:02:55.260> accurate<00:02:55.820> since<00:02:56.820> there's<00:02:57.030> no

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
or less pretty accurate since there's no

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:58.940 
or less pretty accurate since there's no
colors<00:02:57.480> to<00:02:57.630> differentiate<00:02:58.080> the<00:02:58.530> different

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
colors to differentiate the different

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.000 
colors to differentiate the different
signal<00:02:59.550> bikes<00:02:59.790> in<00:03:00.000> there<00:03:00.620> but<00:03:01.620> he's<00:03:01.739> a<00:03:01.800> pretty

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
signal bikes in there but he's a pretty

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.940 
signal bikes in there but he's a pretty
cool<00:03:02.190> design<00:03:02.370> again<00:03:03.120> very<00:03:03.390> simple<00:03:03.720> but<00:03:04.110> I<00:03:04.290> do

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
cool design again very simple but I do

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.229 
cool design again very simple but I do
dig<00:03:05.459> it<00:03:05.640> quite<00:03:05.970> a<00:03:06.000> bit

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
dig it quite a bit

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:08.660 
dig it quite a bit
so<00:03:06.930> like<00:03:07.020> I<00:03:07.080> said<00:03:07.140> this<00:03:07.350> does<00:03:07.590> spin<00:03:07.890> and<00:03:08.220> if<00:03:08.550> you

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
so like I said this does spin and if you

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:11.360 
so like I said this does spin and if you
pop<00:03:09.000> it<00:03:09.209> off<00:03:09.690> you<00:03:10.380> can<00:03:10.530> see<00:03:10.739> it<00:03:10.860> is<00:03:10.980> just<00:03:11.130> a

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
pop it off you can see it is just a

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.710 
pop it off you can see it is just a
normal<00:03:11.610> old<00:03:12.000> tire<00:03:12.870> coke<00:03:13.230> on<00:03:13.470> port<00:03:13.940> so<00:03:14.940> nothing

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
normal old tire coke on port so nothing

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.720 
normal old tire coke on port so nothing
crazy<00:03:15.870> there<00:03:16.380> and<00:03:16.650> of<00:03:16.739> course<00:03:17.040> you<00:03:17.340> can<00:03:17.520> add

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
crazy there and of course you can add

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.840 
crazy there and of course you can add
the<00:03:18.450> mikado

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:19.850 
the mikado

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:24.680 
the mikado
or<00:03:20.850> tox<00:03:21.390> on<00:03:22.850> signals<00:03:23.850> and<00:03:24.180> of<00:03:24.269> course<00:03:24.450> you<00:03:24.600> do

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
or tox on signals and of course you do

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.690 
or tox on signals and of course you do
have<00:03:24.810> to<00:03:24.930> spin<00:03:25.170> a<00:03:25.200> little<00:03:25.410> bit<00:03:25.709> these<00:03:26.280> work<00:03:26.519> off

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
have to spin a little bit these work off

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.810 
have to spin a little bit these work off
that<00:03:26.730> tether<00:03:27.239> those<00:03:27.600> tabs<00:03:27.959> so<00:03:28.920> you<00:03:29.519> kind<00:03:29.760> of

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:29.820 
that tether those tabs so you kind of

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:32.330 
that tether those tabs so you kind of
have<00:03:30.000> to<00:03:30.239> line<00:03:31.110> it<00:03:31.140> up<00:03:31.350> properly<00:03:31.650> to<00:03:31.830> get<00:03:32.100> to

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
have to line it up properly to get to

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.030 
have to line it up properly to get to
fit<00:03:32.549> in<00:03:32.700> but<00:03:33.090> what<00:03:33.239> do<00:03:33.299> you<00:03:33.360> do<00:03:33.739> it<00:03:34.739> spins

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
fit in but what do you do it spins

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.610 
fit in but what do you do it spins
perfectly<00:03:35.580> fine<00:03:35.760> and<00:03:36.269> you<00:03:36.930> can<00:03:37.080> position<00:03:37.260> it

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
perfectly fine and you can position it

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:41.690 
perfectly fine and you can position it
however<00:03:38.040> you<00:03:38.310> want<00:03:38.580> to<00:03:40.040> differentiate<00:03:41.040> his

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
however you want to differentiate his

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:45.350 
however you want to differentiate his
different<00:03:42.239> attacks<00:03:43.820> it<00:03:44.820> doesn't<00:03:45.060> have<00:03:45.180> quite

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 
different attacks it doesn't have quite

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.560 
different attacks it doesn't have quite
the<00:03:45.480> same<00:03:45.750> fun<00:03:46.049> factor<00:03:46.470> that<00:03:46.620> the<00:03:46.799> tires<00:03:47.040> do

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:47.570 
the same fun factor that the tires do

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:50.300 
the same fun factor that the tires do
for<00:03:48.570> the<00:03:48.630> normal<00:03:48.930> tire<00:03:49.140> code<00:03:49.380> figures<00:03:49.950> because

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
for the normal tire code figures because

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.070 
for the normal tire code figures because
the<00:03:50.549> the<00:03:50.760> stylistic<00:03:51.390> approach<00:03:51.720> is<00:03:51.989> very

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.080 
the the stylistic approach is very

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.220 
the the stylistic approach is very
simple<00:03:52.760> compared<00:03:53.760> to<00:03:53.880> those<00:03:54.030> while<00:03:54.810> those<00:03:55.019> add

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
simple compared to those while those add

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.710 
simple compared to those while those add
splashes<00:03:55.830> of<00:03:55.980> color<00:03:56.250> and<00:03:56.730> a<00:03:57.120> different<00:03:57.269> sort

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
splashes of color and a different sort

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.960 
splashes of color and a different sort
of<00:03:57.870> silhouettes<00:03:58.530> and<00:03:58.709> features<00:03:59.010> these<00:03:59.640> just

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
of silhouettes and features these just

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:02.120 
of silhouettes and features these just
changed<00:04:00.299> a<00:04:00.360> little<00:04:00.570> picture<00:04:00.810> so<00:04:01.769> there's<00:04:01.950> not

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130 
changed a little picture so there's not

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:07.550 
changed a little picture so there's not
really<00:04:02.630> anything<00:04:03.709> too<00:04:04.940> hugely<00:04:05.940> neat<00:04:06.560> about

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
really anything too hugely neat about

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:11.479 
really anything too hugely neat about
his<00:04:08.040> but<00:04:09.030> you<00:04:09.570> can<00:04:09.750> get<00:04:09.930> to<00:04:10.079> the<00:04:10.260> motorcycle

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.489 
his but you can get to the motorcycle

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:14.930 
his but you can get to the motorcycle
sort<00:04:12.090> of<00:04:12.209> look<00:04:12.769> going<00:04:13.769> on<00:04:13.920> with<00:04:14.160> the<00:04:14.430> rear

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:14.940 
sort of look going on with the rear

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:16.880 
sort of look going on with the rear
wheel<00:04:15.209> and<00:04:15.510> the<00:04:15.750> front<00:04:16.140> wheel<00:04:16.320> that's<00:04:16.650> the

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:16.890 
wheel and the front wheel that's the

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:19.819 
wheel and the front wheel that's the
coating<00:04:17.370> in<00:04:17.579> the<00:04:17.700> Zen<00:04:17.940> rain<00:04:18.180> which<00:04:19.169> is<00:04:19.470> kind<00:04:19.769> of

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:19.829 
coating in the Zen rain which is kind of

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:22.909 
coating in the Zen rain which is kind of
cool<00:04:20.100> so<00:04:20.760> you<00:04:20.820> can<00:04:20.970> get<00:04:21.180> that<00:04:22.109> kind<00:04:22.169> of<00:04:22.590> design

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:22.919 
cool so you can get that kind of design

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:24.710 
cool so you can get that kind of design
going<00:04:23.280> on<00:04:23.510> too

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.720 
going on too

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.750 
going on too
now<00:04:25.169> the<00:04:25.229> coolest<00:04:25.560> thing<00:04:25.950> is<00:04:26.160> the<00:04:26.370> fact<00:04:26.610> that

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:26.760 
now the coolest thing is the fact that

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:27.590 
now the coolest thing is the fact that
like<00:04:27.120> mosh

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
like mosh

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.330 
like mosh
chaser<00:04:28.110> even<00:04:28.470> though<00:04:28.560> this<00:04:28.860> doesn't<00:04:29.100> happen

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 
chaser even though this doesn't happen

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:33.050 
chaser even though this doesn't happen
in<00:04:29.610> the<00:04:29.760> show<00:04:30.590> you<00:04:31.590> have<00:04:32.010> an<00:04:32.190> added<00:04:32.550> dash<00:04:32.760> of

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060 
in the show you have an added dash of

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:36.230 
in the show you have an added dash of
playability<00:04:33.650> because<00:04:34.650> this<00:04:34.950> is<00:04:35.220> a<00:04:35.520> tire<00:04:35.910> coke

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
playability because this is a tire coke

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.990 
playability because this is a tire coke
on<00:04:36.450> port<00:04:36.750> since<00:04:37.170> midnight<00:04:37.740> shadow<00:04:38.310> says

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000 
on port since midnight shadow says

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.130 
on port since midnight shadow says
shinobi<00:04:39.870> in<00:04:40.260> the<00:04:40.980> mock<00:04:41.520> driver<00:04:42.180> I'm<00:04:42.780> gonna<00:04:42.990> go

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:43.140 
shinobi in the mock driver I'm gonna go

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:47.630 
shinobi in the mock driver I'm gonna go
ahead<00:04:43.230> and<00:04:43.350> use<00:04:44.780> midnight<00:04:45.780> shadow<00:04:46.080> and<00:04:46.640> there

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:47.640 
ahead and use midnight shadow and there

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:50.120 
ahead and use midnight shadow and there
you<00:04:47.760> go<00:04:47.940> so<00:04:47.970> there<00:04:48.330> is<00:04:48.510> the<00:04:48.690> tire<00:04:48.990> on<00:04:49.380> his<00:04:49.440> port

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:50.130 
you go so there is the tire on his port

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:52.670 
you go so there is the tire on his port
I<00:04:50.400> will<00:04:51.210> be<00:04:51.450> the<00:04:51.600> first<00:04:51.840> to<00:04:52.110> admit<00:04:52.260> it<00:04:52.650> looks

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:52.680 
I will be the first to admit it looks

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.270 
I will be the first to admit it looks
pretty<00:04:53.310> dumb<00:04:53.640> ah<00:04:54.620> there's<00:04:55.620> just<00:04:55.680> not<00:04:56.070> a<00:04:56.130> whole

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 
pretty dumb ah there's just not a whole

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.850 
pretty dumb ah there's just not a whole
lot<00:04:56.640> of<00:04:56.910> kind<00:04:57.660> of<00:04:57.720> cool<00:04:57.960> going<00:04:58.320> on<00:04:58.470> you<00:04:58.620> lose<00:04:58.830> a

00:04:58.850 --> 00:04:58.860 
lot of kind of cool going on you lose a

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:01.580 
lot of kind of cool going on you lose a
lot<00:04:59.130> of<00:04:59.160> the<00:04:59.520> the<00:05:00.270> arm<00:05:00.660> articulation<00:05:01.380> there

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:01.590 
lot of the the arm articulation there

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:04.340 
lot of the the arm articulation there
just<00:05:01.860> because<00:05:01.980> it's<00:05:02.190> so<00:05:02.370> freakin<00:05:02.880> bulky<00:05:03.350> it

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:04.350 
just because it's so freakin bulky it

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:06.920 
just because it's so freakin bulky it
does<00:05:04.620> spin<00:05:05.070> still<00:05:05.670> so<00:05:06.000> you<00:05:06.090> have<00:05:06.300> that<00:05:06.510> going

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:06.930 
does spin still so you have that going

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:09.530 
does spin still so you have that going
he<00:05:07.080> can<00:05:07.170> kind<00:05:07.470> of<00:05:07.650> like<00:05:07.890> side<00:05:08.820> check<00:05:09.210> somebody

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:09.540 
he can kind of like side check somebody

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:12.050 
he can kind of like side check somebody
with<00:05:10.200> the<00:05:10.410> with<00:05:10.860> funky<00:05:11.310> spike<00:05:11.610> or<00:05:11.790> whatever

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:12.060 
with the with funky spike or whatever

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:15.680 
with the with funky spike or whatever
and<00:05:12.300> maybe<00:05:12.450> it<00:05:12.660> alert<00:05:12.950> but<00:05:13.950> yeah<00:05:14.850> it's<00:05:15.300> it's

and maybe it alert but yeah it's it's
definitely<00:05:17.060> kind<00:05:18.060> of<00:05:18.210> strange<00:05:18.570> but<00:05:19.110> again

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:19.380 
definitely kind of strange but again

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:21.440 
definitely kind of strange but again
it's<00:05:19.620> added<00:05:20.010> playability<00:05:20.370> and<00:05:20.640> I'm<00:05:20.850> sure<00:05:21.090> kids

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:21.450 
it's added playability and I'm sure kids

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:24.200 
it's added playability and I'm sure kids
love<00:05:22.260> love<00:05:23.040> love<00:05:23.280> that<00:05:23.490> sort<00:05:23.730> of<00:05:23.820> thing<00:05:24.000> even

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:24.210 
love love love that sort of thing even

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:26.390 
love love love that sort of thing even
if<00:05:24.330> it<00:05:24.420> doesn't<00:05:24.600> happen<00:05:24.780> in<00:05:24.990> the<00:05:25.080> show<00:05:25.260> if<00:05:26.250> you

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:26.400 
if it doesn't happen in the show if you

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.010 
if it doesn't happen in the show if you
aren't<00:05:26.730> at<00:05:26.850> that<00:05:27.060> point<00:05:27.360> in<00:05:27.450> the<00:05:27.510> show<00:05:27.720> yet

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:28.020 
aren't at that point in the show yet

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:31.520 
aren't at that point in the show yet
when<00:05:28.440> he<00:05:28.560> uses<00:05:28.770> a<00:05:29.010> shift<00:05:29.610> car<00:05:29.910> in<00:05:30.350> side<00:05:31.350> the

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:31.530 
when he uses a shift car in side the

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:34.310 
when he uses a shift car in side the
mock<00:05:31.740> driver<00:05:32.070> he<00:05:32.250> gets<00:05:32.430> a<00:05:32.670> signal<00:05:33.060> with<00:05:34.050> that

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:34.320 
mock driver he gets a signal with that

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:36.560 
mock driver he gets a signal with that
shift<00:05:34.680> cars<00:05:34.950> logo<00:05:35.370> in<00:05:35.550> it<00:05:35.700> so<00:05:36.000> like<00:05:36.210> midnight

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:36.570 
shift cars logo in it so like midnight

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:37.910 
shift cars logo in it so like midnight
shadow<00:05:36.870> would<00:05:37.110> be<00:05:37.290> the<00:05:37.470> I<00:05:37.620> think<00:05:37.770> it's<00:05:37.860> a

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:37.920 
shadow would be the I think it's a

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:40.580 
shadow would be the I think it's a
shuriken<00:05:38.600> sort<00:05:39.600> of<00:05:39.690> logo<00:05:39.870> so<00:05:40.290> you<00:05:40.440> would<00:05:40.560> just

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:40.590 
shuriken sort of logo so you would just

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:42.200 
shuriken sort of logo so you would just
have<00:05:40.860> that<00:05:41.160> and<00:05:41.460> then<00:05:41.610> those<00:05:41.820> entering<00:05:42.120> the

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:42.210 
have that and then those entering the

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:43.700 
have that and then those entering the
shooter<00:05:42.480> like<00:05:42.660> would<00:05:42.870> shoot<00:05:43.080> out<00:05:43.170> shuriken<00:05:43.650> x'

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:43.710 
shooter like would shoot out shuriken x'

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:46.400 
shooter like would shoot out shuriken x'
and<00:05:43.950> stuff<00:05:44.240> so<00:05:45.240> that<00:05:45.270> is<00:05:45.510> basically<00:05:45.840> how<00:05:45.960> that

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:46.410 
and stuff so that is basically how that

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:46.850 
and stuff so that is basically how that
works

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:46.860 
works

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:49.850 
works
you<00:05:47.460> can't<00:05:47.730> attach<00:05:48.030> chasers<00:05:48.690> you<00:05:49.110> circular<00:05:49.680> on

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:49.860 
you can't attach chasers you circular on

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:52.430 
you can't attach chasers you circular on
there<00:05:50.010> too<00:05:50.190> but<00:05:50.370> it<00:05:50.490> looks<00:05:50.640> even<00:05:50.790> stranger<00:05:51.630> so

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:52.440 
there too but it looks even stranger so

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:54.560 
there too but it looks even stranger so
again<00:05:52.680> it's<00:05:52.890> added<00:05:53.250> playability<00:05:53.670> that<00:05:54.180> I

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:54.570 
again it's added playability that I

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:56.300 
again it's added playability that I
definitely<00:05:55.050> appreciate<00:05:55.500> because<00:05:55.890> I<00:05:56.100> always

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:56.310 
definitely appreciate because I always

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:58.250 
definitely appreciate because I always
dig<00:05:57.090> toys<00:05:57.300> that<00:05:57.480> have<00:05:57.570> added<00:05:57.810> playability

00:05:58.250 --> 00:05:58.260 
dig toys that have added playability

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.320 
dig toys that have added playability
even<00:05:59.130> if<00:05:59.220> it<00:05:59.340> isn't<00:05:59.580> something<00:05:59.760> that<00:05:59.910> is<00:06:00.030> in

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:00.330 
even if it isn't something that is in

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:03.560 
even if it isn't something that is in
the<00:06:00.420> show<00:06:01.130> but<00:06:02.130> it's<00:06:02.490> now<00:06:02.910> a<00:06:02.940> question<00:06:03.270> of

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:03.570 
the show but it's now a question of

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:40.320 
so overall like machine chaser MOC is a

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:41.480 
so overall like machine chaser MOC is a
figure<00:06:40.740> that's<00:06:41.070> a

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:41.490 
figure that's a

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:44.570 
figure that's a

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:56.370 
get if he was just by himself but

00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:58.730 
get if he was just by himself but
because<00:06:56.819> his<00:06:57.210> powers<00:06:57.930> are<00:06:58.080> all<00:06:58.169> based<00:06:58.410> on<00:06:58.590> the

because his powers are all based on the
signals<00:06:59.190> you<00:06:59.460> don't<00:07:00.240> really<00:07:00.360> have<00:07:00.569> to<00:07:00.720> buy<00:07:00.900> a

signals you don't really have to buy a
whole<00:07:01.169> lot<00:07:01.319> of<00:07:01.440> toys<00:07:01.590> to<00:07:01.770> get<00:07:01.889> the<00:07:01.979> most<00:07:02.099> value

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:02.460 
whole lot of toys to get the most value

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:04.550 
whole lot of toys to get the most value
out<00:07:02.490> of<00:07:02.639> him<00:07:02.880> and<00:07:03.060> even<00:07:03.870> at<00:07:04.020> the<00:07:04.139> core<00:07:04.380> the

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:04.560 
out of him and even at the core the

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:05.930 
out of him and even at the core the
signals<00:07:04.919> don't<00:07:05.130> really<00:07:05.280> change<00:07:05.490> a<00:07:05.669> whole<00:07:05.789> lot

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:05.940 
signals don't really change a whole lot

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:08.180 
signals don't really change a whole lot
about<00:07:06.090> the<00:07:06.449> toy<00:07:06.599> so<00:07:07.289> if<00:07:07.380> you<00:07:07.530> look<00:07:07.710> past<00:07:07.740> not

having<00:07:08.520> all<00:07:08.639> the<00:07:08.729> signals<00:07:09.120> it<00:07:09.360> makes<00:07:09.569> a<00:07:09.660> nice

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:09.810 
having all the signals it makes a nice

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:12.680 
having all the signals it makes a nice
standalone<00:07:10.440> piece<00:07:10.800> if<00:07:11.669> you<00:07:11.729> are<00:07:11.880> only<00:07:12.449> looking
