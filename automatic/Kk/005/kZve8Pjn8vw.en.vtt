00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300
 welcome to a new video diab les 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:05.279
 I bring the review of great auto vice 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.870
 city this game just came out today if 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.550
 more an excellent good game let's see 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.960
 how good is this game going to 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.610
 work just like any grand 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.200
 Theft auto 'made is the same version of 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.179
 grand theft auto vice city original 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.740
 only each one is going to be 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.180
 our devices is going to be the 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.830
 full and good story I think I play 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.240
 the truth is that it is quite enough 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.160
 interesting if you do not know 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.289
 big lack of what this game is about 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.609
 since completing missions but also 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.590
 is the free mode is to say when not 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.330
 you are participating in a mission you 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.669
 you can keep playing you can follow 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.290
 killing people stealing cars actually 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.610
 you can do many things for example 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.440
 now I am in the middle of a mission and 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.760
 I have to hit two people 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.610
 then well let's do that mission 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.840
 and here for example I'm going to throw 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.820
 car from a parking lot to 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.970
 earn some money 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:50.079
 so good here, do not sell because you smoke 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:52.239
 the jump but good anyway 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:53.830
 now on the map you see two points 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:55.629
 yellows I think that you are not going to 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:58.660
 reach to see project you have to go towards 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:01:00.640
 those points this map or radar always goes 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:03.570
 to be appearing during missions 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:06.490
 for example and it will help us a lot 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:09.190
 for example here I am in this car but 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:11.740
 yes , I could get off 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:14.710
 and steal some other car try let's 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:16.630
 get closer to where is one of the guys 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.370
 that I have to hit today that had them 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.550
 to hit and not kill them then not 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:23.260
 let's try not to kill 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:26.200
 to those people 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:29.830
 and well then they are going to pay here for 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:31.960
 example leave 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:34.090
 and something difficult of this game yes good 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.770
 had been in my account now it's something 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.090
 difficult to occupy the controls good by 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.280
 example here the joystick I can 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:42.400
 put where I want but if it costs a 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:45.040
 little job to fit in as well 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:47.890
 this type of games is better when you 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.900
 you play them on a physical joystick with 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.610
 physical buttons all but good here by 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:53.530
 example the run button appears here 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.060
 the hit at home for example now 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.850
 I have a hammer if I wanted to change 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.800
 the equipment weapon with a gun and the 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.510
 button will change to shoot and here I 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.460
 could change to more weapons then they go 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:05.950
 here you can accommodate all that 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.630
 here we could have more weapons yet 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.860
 I have not gotten some yet and 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.410
 well here I am looking for my car 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.200
 to rob me and continue with the mission and 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:15.910
 good for example here is a motorcycle 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.830
 I like these bikes a lot because they go 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.660
 pretty pretty fast then here 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:23.010
 we are going to follow the yellow dot that 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.010
 I had said we are very very close 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.120
 Well , a video is already appearing 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:30.299
 Acosta is used to many videos 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.920
 during the game then good here already 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:33.810
 I completed one and now I want to hit you 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.650
 to the guy who had told them we define 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:39.060
 with the motorcycle the angel was coming 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.530
 Now I get on the bike and I have to go to 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.969
 this yellow point you are not there 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.349
 to know that the radar issue and 

00:02:41.969 --> 00:02:45.540
 yellow dot then there I can 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:46.980
 guide and as if it were a gps 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.629
 while it reached the point that I have to 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.010
 go I'm already very close you can go 

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:52.200
 realizing that the graphics are very 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.569
 good and good here is already and to whom 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.569
 I have to hit just I'm going to 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:03:00.180
 leave the motorcycle around here I'll grab on 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:03.870
 the hammer so as not to kill him because if 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:06.540
 I'm supposed to lose the mission 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.950
 and well here we already have a blow objects 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.590
 here my sector that destroy the car 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:14.510
 we're just going to hit him 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.510
 close the gun to make it easier 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.850
 Y 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.470
 here apparently I think I finished the 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:24.490
 mission I'm not sure but here 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.410
 a video appeared 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:28.750
 Ivan that I became an accomplished mission and 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.160
 they give money in this case they were 400 but 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.360
 the same depends on the mission the money that 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.620
 they're going to give you good then that's how 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.970
 the game works in this case only 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.500
 it was a mission I do not want either 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.750
 overtake them so many missions but if 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.070
 has enough something important to say of 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:40.810
 this game is the price the truth that 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:43.090
 It's somewhat expensive but I think it's worth a lot 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:45.040
 the penalty is a game that I like 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:46.990
 quite and I think a lot of you 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.250
 you will like this with everything if 

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:49.540
 they want to try and not who for so much 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.230
 money equal the description I 'm going to 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.730
 leave 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.950
 a way for them to get 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:55.120
 free can be big car any 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:57.190
 that you want then it is very 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.990
 simple you can get this game and 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:00.459
 totally legal with the link that is going 

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:02.260
 to leave in the description but good 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:03.640
 this was all I hope you like the review 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.110
