00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 after refining the matches three in 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.480
 the space of five days 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.940
 it's time for recovery for 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.469
 ravens of tp mazembe englebert not 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.960
 question of crossing arms 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.070
 this Friday all the workforce was in 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.980
 the fitness room 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.050
 before of course to repeat the system of 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.119
 game on the field where the match that 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:26.010
 tomorrow will oppose the African club of 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:29.730
 tunisia days each 24 or 48 hours a 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:33.000
 match like that we will play so given 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:35.430
 tomorrow saturday june 11th at 9pm play 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.739
 so we're sitting today in the 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.870
 room it was a second based on 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:43.410
 the explosiveness of players on karate 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.960
 also worked a little worked in 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.010
 room is not necessarily synonymous with 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.440
 tired 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.020
 these exercises are well measure for 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.850
 help players recover their state 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:57.600
 physical and I'm tired because 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:00.180
 we have not worked it is 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.140
 did not go to the reserves of 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.120
 two players 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.939
 it was a really well proportioned sitting 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:09.210
 and well calculated for the players 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:12.060
 pay energies in the mattress 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.170
 these courses seem to bear fruit of 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.479
 physical point of view 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.119
 the tp mazembe englebert do not appear 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.270
 likes and far compared to 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.240
 matches we played 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:24.789
 compared to the 6.1 at the intensity of 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.469
 match as we played the day before yesterday there I 

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:28.570
 seeing that all the players were in the point 

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:30.340
 physically because there was when 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.869
 even commitments and also the 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.280
 passivity in the eating so from the beginning 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:35.740
 until the end as a hat trick 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.750
 to the players you see they are all at 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.950
 point that was running hurt against 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.979
 usm beautiful abbess 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:44.110
 jonas sakuwaha resumed work but at 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:45.219
 a much lighter pace than the one 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.399
 of the entire workforce 

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:49.060
 since he is not yet 100% of his 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:51.369
 capacity 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.270
 besides this unavailability of youth 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:54.579
 employment 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:58.950
 four squadrons keep its full strength 

00:01:54.579 --> 00:01:58.950
 aligned against the African club team 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:03.780
 yeah
