our tutorial today on how to create a
character<00:00:12.880> with<00:00:13.210> anime<00:00:13.570> studio<00:00:15.000> what<00:00:16.000> we're

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:16.150 
character with anime studio what we're

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:17.970 
character with anime studio what we're
gonna<00:00:16.240> do<00:00:16.510> right<00:00:16.779> now<00:00:16.840> is<00:00:17.080> pick<00:00:17.560> up<00:00:17.710> where<00:00:17.890> we

gonna do right now is pick up where we

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:19.350 
gonna do right now is pick up where we
left<00:00:18.160> off<00:00:18.400> we're<00:00:18.640> going<00:00:18.760> to<00:00:18.820> create<00:00:19.060> the

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:19.360 
left off we're going to create the

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.080 
left off we're going to create the
eyebrows<00:00:20.110> and<00:00:20.520> I'm<00:00:21.520> going<00:00:21.640> to<00:00:21.670> show<00:00:21.820> you<00:00:21.850> how

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:22.090 
eyebrows and I'm going to show you how

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:26.609 
eyebrows and I'm going to show you how
to<00:00:22.150> use<00:00:22.510> a<00:00:22.869> blend<00:00:23.800> morph<00:00:24.100> in<00:00:24.400> this<00:00:24.550> tutorial<00:00:25.619> so

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:26.619 
to use a blend morph in this tutorial so

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:28.920 
to use a blend morph in this tutorial so
we're<00:00:26.740> going<00:00:26.830> to<00:00:26.890> start<00:00:27.160> by<00:00:27.340> creating<00:00:27.400> a<00:00:28.240> new

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:28.930 
we're going to start by creating a new

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:31.290 
we're going to start by creating a new
vector<00:00:29.619> layer<00:00:29.830> above<00:00:30.400> our<00:00:30.609> face<00:00:30.850> layer<00:00:31.150> and

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:31.300 
vector layer above our face layer and

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:32.820 
vector layer above our face layer and
above<00:00:31.510> our<00:00:31.660> eyelids<00:00:32.080> layer<00:00:32.290> so<00:00:32.590> that<00:00:32.710> our

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:32.830 
above our eyelids layer so that our

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:35.400 
above our eyelids layer so that our
eyebrows<00:00:33.280> always<00:00:33.760> show<00:00:33.970> no<00:00:34.180> matter<00:00:34.390> what<00:00:34.600> so

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:35.410 
eyebrows always show no matter what so

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:36.299 
eyebrows always show no matter what so
come<00:00:35.620> down<00:00:35.769> here

00:00:36.299 --> 00:00:36.309 
come down here

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:39.180 
come down here
you're<00:00:36.940> on<00:00:37.120> face<00:00:37.450> and<00:00:37.809> click<00:00:38.410> this<00:00:38.649> and<00:00:38.980> insert

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:39.190 
you're on face and click this and insert

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:41.250 
you're on face and click this and insert
a<00:00:39.250> new<00:00:39.430> vector<00:00:39.790> layer<00:00:39.940> double<00:00:40.780> click<00:00:40.809> it<00:00:41.140> and

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:41.260 
a new vector layer double click it and

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:46.830 
a new vector layer double click it and
we'll<00:00:41.920> rename<00:00:42.910> it<00:00:43.120> in<00:00:43.270> all<00:00:43.420> caps<00:00:43.690> its<00:00:45.840> eyebrows

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:46.840 
we'll rename it in all caps its eyebrows

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:48.990 
we'll rename it in all caps its eyebrows
and<00:00:47.260> by<00:00:47.469> making<00:00:47.890> it<00:00:48.040> a<00:00:48.100> tall<00:00:48.250> cap<00:00:48.489> that'll<00:00:48.850> just

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:49.000 
and by making it a tall cap that'll just

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.880 
and by making it a tall cap that'll just
make<00:00:49.059> it<00:00:49.270> easy<00:00:49.420> to<00:00:49.540> find<00:00:49.780> later<00:00:50.020> on<00:00:50.290> because

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:50.890 
make it easy to find later on because

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:52.110 
make it easy to find later on because
we're<00:00:51.040> going<00:00:51.129> to<00:00:51.219> use<00:00:51.399> this<00:00:51.579> a<00:00:51.640> lot<00:00:51.760> in<00:00:52.059> our

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:52.120 
we're going to use this a lot in our

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.690 
we're going to use this a lot in our
animation<00:00:53.070> all<00:00:54.070> right<00:00:54.219> we're<00:00:54.430> just<00:00:54.460> going<00:00:54.640> to

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:54.700 
animation all right we're just going to

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.369 
animation all right we're just going to
create<00:00:54.879> some<00:00:55.180> simple<00:00:55.390> eyebrows

00:00:56.369 --> 00:00:56.379 
create some simple eyebrows

00:00:56.379 --> 00:00:57.900 
create some simple eyebrows
remember<00:00:57.010> you<00:00:57.100> can<00:00:57.219> zoom<00:00:57.370> in<00:00:57.550> just<00:00:57.730> by

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:57.910 
remember you can zoom in just by

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:00.150 
remember you can zoom in just by
scrolling<00:00:58.570> with<00:00:58.840> your<00:00:58.960> mouse<00:00:59.110> wheel<00:00:59.350> that's

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:00.160 
scrolling with your mouse wheel that's

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.420 
scrolling with your mouse wheel that's
all<00:01:00.340> I'm<00:01:00.430> doing<00:01:00.489> here<00:01:00.820> and<00:01:01.800> we're<00:01:02.800> going<00:01:03.250> to

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:03.430 
all I'm doing here and we're going to

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:06.270 
all I'm doing here and we're going to
we'll<00:01:04.360> just<00:01:04.570> use<00:01:04.780> like<00:01:05.020> three<00:01:05.619> points<00:01:06.130> we've

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:06.280 
we'll just use like three points we've

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.040 
we'll just use like three points we've
got<00:01:06.460> Auto<00:01:06.640> stroke<00:01:07.060> on<00:01:07.300> you<00:01:07.509> don't<00:01:07.660> need<00:01:07.810> any<00:01:07.960> of

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:08.050 
got Auto stroke on you don't need any of

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:11.219 
got Auto stroke on you don't need any of
these<00:01:08.200> other<00:01:08.470> ones<00:01:08.649> on<00:01:09.690> we<00:01:10.690> got<00:01:10.810> our<00:01:10.899> stroke

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:11.229 
these other ones on we got our stroke

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:14.940 
these other ones on we got our stroke
with<00:01:11.440> set<00:01:11.740> to<00:01:11.890> 4<00:01:12.220> and<00:01:13.229> we<00:01:14.229> won't<00:01:14.709> worry<00:01:14.830> about

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:14.950 
with set to 4 and we won't worry about

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.109 
with set to 4 and we won't worry about
the<00:01:15.220> fill<00:01:15.459> so<00:01:15.940> just<00:01:16.240> quickly<00:01:17.080> make<00:01:17.470> a<00:01:17.530> couple

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
the fill so just quickly make a couple

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.850 
the fill so just quickly make a couple
make<00:01:19.119> a<00:01:19.179> little<00:01:19.330> line<00:01:19.599> and<00:01:19.990> then<00:01:20.170> we've<00:01:20.709> only

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:20.860 
make a little line and then we've only

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.330 
make a little line and then we've only
got<00:01:21.039> two<00:01:21.190> points<00:01:21.580> we'll<00:01:21.759> add<00:01:21.880> another<00:01:22.030> one

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
got two points we'll add another one

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.669 
got two points we'll add another one
boom

00:01:25.669 --> 00:01:25.679

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:37.840 

I<00:01:34.720> try<00:01:35.720> to<00:01:35.750> make<00:01:35.960> these<00:01:36.140> look<00:01:36.350> pretty<00:01:37.040> much<00:01:37.550> the

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
I try to make these look pretty much the

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:43.690 
I try to make these look pretty much the
same<00:01:40.270> because<00:01:41.270> they<00:01:41.510> don't<00:01:41.750> look<00:01:41.960> normal<00:01:42.700> as

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
same because they don't look normal as

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.970 
same because they don't look normal as
you<00:01:43.940> can<00:01:44.090> see<00:01:44.270> most<00:01:44.480> human<00:01:45.080> eyebrows<00:01:45.560> don't<00:01:45.860> do

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:45.980 
you can see most human eyebrows don't do

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:48.340 
you can see most human eyebrows don't do
this<00:01:46.130> what<00:01:46.430> we'll<00:01:46.550> do<00:01:46.700> is<00:01:46.820> we'll<00:01:46.970> click<00:01:47.350> on

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350 
this what we'll do is we'll click on

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.990 
this what we'll do is we'll click on
this<00:01:48.710> point<00:01:49.330> and<00:01:51.580> come<00:01:52.580> up<00:01:52.700> here<00:01:52.850> to<00:01:52.970> our

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
this point and come up here to our

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.230 
this point and come up here to our
curvature<00:01:53.600> tool<00:01:54.010> in<00:01:55.010> Moodle<00:01:55.310> and<00:01:55.850> actually

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
curvature tool in Moodle and actually

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:57.850 
curvature tool in Moodle and actually
that's<00:01:56.360> a<00:01:56.510> little<00:01:56.660> too<00:01:56.900> curvy<00:01:57.320> so<00:01:57.530> we'll<00:01:57.680> bring

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
that's a little too curvy so we'll bring

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:59.680 
that's a little too curvy so we'll bring
it<00:01:58.010> back<00:01:58.040> a<00:01:58.250> little<00:01:58.550> bit<00:01:58.730> by<00:01:59.060> clicking<00:01:59.540> and

00:01:59.680 --> 00:01:59.690 
it back a little bit by clicking and

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:02.170 
it back a little bit by clicking and
dragging<00:01:59.720> to<00:02:00.110> the<00:02:00.170> left<00:02:00.440> and<00:02:00.710> then<00:02:01.250> same<00:02:02.150> thing

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 
dragging to the left and then same thing

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.570 
dragging to the left and then same thing
with<00:02:02.450> this<00:02:02.540> one<00:02:02.750> click<00:02:03.050> and<00:02:03.350> drag<00:02:04.190> it<00:02:04.369> to<00:02:04.400> the

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:04.580 
with this one click and drag it to the

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.570 
with this one click and drag it to the
right<00:02:04.940> to<00:02:05.450> make<00:02:05.479> it<00:02:05.720> a<00:02:05.750> little<00:02:05.840> more<00:02:06.110> curvy<00:02:06.580> and

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 
right to make it a little more curvy and

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.270 
right to make it a little more curvy and
that<00:02:07.700> looks<00:02:07.910> more<00:02:08.119> natural<00:02:08.300> and<00:02:09.070> now<00:02:10.070> we'll

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
that looks more natural and now we'll

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
your action screen now here's the trick

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.809 
your action screen now here's the trick
with<00:03:02.520> a<00:03:02.550> blend<00:03:02.910> morph<00:03:03.650> if<00:03:04.650> it's<00:03:05.220> directly

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:05.819 
with a blend morph if it's directly

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:09.320 
with a blend morph if it's directly
related<00:03:06.510> to<00:03:06.540> an<00:03:07.050> action<00:03:07.640> so<00:03:08.640> we're<00:03:09.030> gonna<00:03:09.120> do

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
related to an action so we're gonna do

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:10.940 
related to an action so we're gonna do
like<00:03:09.540> we<00:03:09.690> did<00:03:09.810> before<00:03:09.990> and<00:03:10.440> create<00:03:10.680> an<00:03:10.770> action

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
like we did before and create an action

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:12.770 
like we did before and create an action
we're<00:03:11.400> gonna<00:03:11.490> highlight<00:03:11.730> the<00:03:12.030> eyebrows<00:03:12.450> layer

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
we're gonna highlight the eyebrows layer

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.040 
we're gonna highlight the eyebrows layer
come<00:03:13.260> up<00:03:13.410> here<00:03:13.620> and<00:03:14.060> create<00:03:15.060> a<00:03:15.150> new<00:03:15.330> action<00:03:15.570> and

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.050 
come up here and create a new action and

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:22.490 
come up here and create a new action and
we'll<00:03:16.739> name<00:03:16.950> it<00:03:18.650> angry<00:03:19.700> okay<00:03:20.780> now<00:03:21.780> the<00:03:21.840> trick

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
we'll name it angry okay now the trick

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.540 
we'll name it angry okay now the trick
to<00:03:22.530> using<00:03:22.890> a<00:03:23.100> blend<00:03:23.430> morph<00:03:23.730> is<00:03:24.709> that<00:03:25.709> you<00:03:26.040> stay

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:26.550 
to using a blend morph is that you stay

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:29.570 
to using a blend morph is that you stay
down<00:03:27.209> here<00:03:27.630> on<00:03:27.840> frame<00:03:28.290> 1<00:03:28.590> if<00:03:28.860> you<00:03:29.100> go<00:03:29.280> past

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:29.580 
down here on frame 1 if you go past

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:32.210 
down here on frame 1 if you go past
frame<00:03:30.060> 1<00:03:30.390> and<00:03:30.660> make<00:03:31.050> any<00:03:31.260> change<00:03:31.620> it's<00:03:31.980> not

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
frame 1 and make any change it's not

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:33.530 
frame 1 and make any change it's not
going<00:03:32.400> to<00:03:32.459> count<00:03:32.670> for<00:03:32.880> your<00:03:33.000> blend<00:03:33.239> more<00:03:33.420> if

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
going to count for your blend more if

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.990 
going to count for your blend more if
you<00:03:33.660> won't<00:03:33.840> have<00:03:34.290> a<00:03:34.350> blend<00:03:34.769> morph<00:03:34.980> created<00:03:35.489> so

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
you won't have a blend morph created so

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.940 
you won't have a blend morph created so
just<00:03:36.239> stay<00:03:36.480> on<00:03:36.510> frame<00:03:36.959> 1<00:03:37.170> make<00:03:37.590> all<00:03:37.769> the

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
just stay on frame 1 make all the

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:39.620 
just stay on frame 1 make all the
changes<00:03:38.310> you<00:03:38.430> want<00:03:38.550> to<00:03:38.700> make<00:03:38.910> and<00:03:39.239> then<00:03:39.330> later

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630 
changes you want to make and then later

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:42.080 
changes you want to make and then later
on<00:03:39.900> you'll<00:03:40.650> be<00:03:40.709> able<00:03:40.920> to<00:03:41.190> blend<00:03:41.489> between<00:03:41.730> these

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
on you'll be able to blend between these

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.060 
on you'll be able to blend between these
different<00:03:42.510> alright<00:03:43.320> so<00:03:43.500> let's<00:03:43.709> turn<00:03:43.890> our

so now let's exit out of here just
double<00:04:13.739> click<00:04:13.920> on<00:04:14.040> main<00:04:14.310> line<00:04:14.690> we're<00:04:15.690> actually

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
double click on main line we're actually

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:18.949 
double click on main line we're actually
in<00:04:16.200> our<00:04:16.320> animation<00:04:16.829> main<00:04:17.669> timeline<00:04:18.120> now<00:04:18.660> this

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
in our animation main timeline now this

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:20.509 
in our animation main timeline now this
is<00:04:19.109> where<00:04:19.320> all<00:04:19.620> of<00:04:19.769> your<00:04:19.859> animation<00:04:20.370> will

happen for anybody who doesn't know the

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:26.060 
happen for anybody who doesn't know the
frame<00:04:23.850> the<00:04:24.510> scene<00:04:24.930> that<00:04:25.110> we<00:04:25.229> were<00:04:25.380> just<00:04:25.560> in<00:04:25.800> is

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
frame the scene that we were just in is

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:27.710 
frame the scene that we were just in is
not<00:04:26.250> something<00:04:26.729> that<00:04:26.850> we'll<00:04:27.030> stick<00:04:27.330> it<00:04:27.360> in

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 
not something that we'll stick it in

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:31.250 
not something that we'll stick it in
your<00:04:28.500> main<00:04:28.770> line<00:04:29.010> so<00:04:29.340> anyway<00:04:30.210> we<00:04:30.780> will<00:04:30.960> insert

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:31.260 
your main line so anyway we will insert

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.200 
your main line so anyway we will insert
our<00:04:31.470> blend<00:04:31.710> morph<00:04:31.919> now<00:04:32.130> now<00:04:32.700> you<00:04:32.760> cannot

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
our blend morph now now you cannot

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:35.840 
our blend morph now now you cannot
insert<00:04:33.600> a<00:04:33.660> blend<00:04:33.960> morph<00:04:34.200> on<00:04:34.380> frame<00:04:34.650> 0<00:04:34.680> so<00:04:35.580> just

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:35.850 
insert a blend morph on frame 0 so just

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:38.060 
insert a blend morph on frame 0 so just

animation<00:06:21.830> in<00:06:21.919> blender<00:06:21.949> offs<00:06:22.580> and<00:06:22.789> now<00:06:23.389> we

00:06:23.439 --> 00:06:23.449 
animation in blender offs and now we

00:06:23.449 --> 00:06:25.480 
animation in blender offs and now we
have<00:06:23.719> both<00:06:24.349> of<00:06:24.409> these<00:06:24.649> that<00:06:24.860> we've<00:06:24.979> created<00:06:25.189> so

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:25.490 
have both of these that we've created so

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:28.299 
have both of these that we've created so
we<00:06:25.519> could<00:06:25.729> go<00:06:25.849> angry<00:06:26.740> we<00:06:27.740> could<00:06:27.889> go<00:06:28.009> right

00:06:28.299 --> 00:06:28.309 
we could go angry we could go right

00:06:28.309 --> 00:06:33.670 
we could go angry we could go right
raised<00:06:28.669> or<00:06:29.360> we<00:06:29.959> can<00:06:30.110> go<00:06:30.229> angry<00:06:30.979> and<00:06:32.409> raise<00:06:33.409> the

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:33.680 
raised or we can go angry and raise the

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:34.329 
raised or we can go angry and raise the
right<00:06:33.860> one

00:06:34.329 --> 00:06:34.339 
right one

00:06:34.339 --> 00:06:36.699 
right one
and<00:06:34.430> we<00:06:34.580> can<00:06:34.759> blend<00:06:35.419> any<00:06:35.839> combination<00:06:36.680> of

00:06:36.699 --> 00:06:36.709 
and we can blend any combination of

00:06:36.709 --> 00:06:39.309 
and we can blend any combination of
these<00:06:36.889> that's<00:06:37.189> why<00:06:37.669> they<00:06:37.909> call<00:06:38.120> it<00:06:38.149> a<00:06:38.269> morph<00:06:38.509> so

00:06:39.309 --> 00:06:39.319 
these that's why they call it a morph so

00:06:39.319 --> 00:06:42.249 
these that's why they call it a morph so
I<00:06:39.559> hope<00:06:39.769> that<00:06:39.860> makes<00:06:40.159> sense<00:06:40.899> alright<00:06:41.959> boom

00:06:42.249 --> 00:06:42.259 
I hope that makes sense alright boom
