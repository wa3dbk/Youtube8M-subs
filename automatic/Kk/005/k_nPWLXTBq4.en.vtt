00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.630
 two 

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:08.060
 a carry 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.950
 the same player on the right side 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:27.210
 so they intercepted him 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:27.210
 two 

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:38.040
 it is a good administration chain 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:38.040
 defensive of this number 13 23 23 veto 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.910
 by the center villegas 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:49.870
 lateral space we will have count on 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.870
 go ahead 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:56.550
 reaches to let go of the satin 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.640
 full pass 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:10.160
 ramÃ­rez is cut by the center of 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.160
 exploits its speed 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:19.130
 well I missed playing not only 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:22.860
 to advance four yards a person 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:26.960
 smart is to stop from back to tier 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:30.030
 I would cross two more points to the savages 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:32.840
 a direct one with my arrival of the seven 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.840
 the conversion is good 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.229
 cheated us of career and a good 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.229
 penetration 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:45.660
 be phase you are alone 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:54.490
 about to leave the lynxes are very 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:58.350
 powerful communicated in phases already 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:58.350
 we saw the first goal 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:13.299
 conversion to match the match 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:16.469
 it's a full pass while the match 

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:16.469
 to 8 points 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.120
 pass 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.070
 so be seated 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:36.650
 pass only he confessed he's still standing number 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.650
 four 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:47.270
 in the mail you need the ball there 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:50.860
 let's go face-to-face they do not say anything 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:50.860
 it's wild ponies 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:00.870
 and good career 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:03.569
 advance was about to leave and get 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:07.069
 the first on fourth chance and 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:07.069
 after having asked for a time out 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:12.600
 good just by the center of the valley 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:20.440
 only to his person the game is opened 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.440
 take advantage of a movement that has the 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:27.790
 number 33 of our regions and that 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:27.790
 is turning out 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:34.890
 on the left side and you already get the 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.890
 first and you can go 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:42.260
 and the excellent penetration 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.730
 in the last room 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:59.350
 you are alone 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:02.760
 / six points notation for me I do not know if 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:02.760
 the sample shows the marker 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:10.530
 barely spends extra point 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:16.900
 through the center again with the core 

00:04:14.719 --> 00:04:16.900
 back 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:25.380
 he cheats of reversible he does not eat them 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:25.380
 You tell us 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:31.440
 for the center place 

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:37.520
 and many many more already carries the ovoid 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:39.710
 in the yard 31 of the territory defended 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:42.200
 by lynxes first cook and vines by 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:44.450
 advance war 28 again the coreback 

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:47.260
 with that play that has given them many 

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:47.260
 sores to the lynxes
