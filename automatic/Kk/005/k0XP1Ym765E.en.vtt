so here we are under the truck and I'm
going<00:00:04.470> to<00:00:04.529> drop<00:00:05.720> this<00:00:06.720> gas<00:00:07.049> tank<00:00:08.210> now<00:00:09.210> you<00:00:09.269> have

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
going to drop this gas tank now you have

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:16.039 
going to drop this gas tank now you have
two<00:00:10.440> ways<00:00:10.880> to<00:00:11.880> get<00:00:12.179> to<00:00:12.889> the<00:00:13.889> area<00:00:14.130> of<00:00:14.969> the<00:00:15.780> fuel

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
two ways to get to the area of the fuel

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.470 
two ways to get to the area of the fuel
pump<00:00:16.529> and<00:00:16.859> the<00:00:17.039> opening<00:00:17.550> for<00:00:17.789> the<00:00:17.820> gas<00:00:18.119> tank

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
pump and the opening for the gas tank

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.730 
pump and the opening for the gas tank
you<00:00:19.400> can<00:00:20.400> either<00:00:20.670> drop<00:00:21.060> it<00:00:21.330> and<00:00:21.570> I<00:00:22.350> will<00:00:22.590> do

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
you can either drop it and I will do

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.269 
you can either drop it and I will do
that<00:00:22.920> because<00:00:23.189> I<00:00:24.019> do<00:00:25.019> it<00:00:25.289> here<00:00:25.500> in<00:00:25.680> the<00:00:25.800> gravel

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
that because I do it here in the gravel

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.960 
that because I do it here in the gravel
driveway<00:00:26.789> and<00:00:27.029> I'm<00:00:27.240> alone<00:00:27.599> or<00:00:28.550> he<00:00:29.550> had<00:00:29.670> a<00:00:29.699> bunch

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
driveway and I'm alone or he had a bunch

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.430 
driveway and I'm alone or he had a bunch
of<00:00:30.210> friends<00:00:30.390> people<00:00:31.320> say<00:00:31.529> it<00:00:31.590> we're<00:00:32.180> easier<00:00:33.440> to

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
of friends people say it we're easier to

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.959 
of friends people say it we're easier to
take<00:00:34.860> over<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.399> bed<00:00:35.960> which<00:00:36.960> is<00:00:37.110> great<00:00:37.380> idea

00:00:37.959 --> 00:00:37.969 
take over the bed which is great idea

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:41.090 
take over the bed which is great idea
now<00:00:38.969> look<00:00:39.300> how<00:00:39.540> close<00:00:39.840> to<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.170> cabin

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
now look how close to the cabin

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.360 
now look how close to the cabin
this<00:00:41.489> is<00:00:41.700> the<00:00:41.879> cabin<00:00:42.090> already<00:00:42.890> how<00:00:43.890> close<00:00:44.190> to

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
this is the cabin already how close to

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.330 
this is the cabin already how close to
the<00:00:44.489> cabin<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:45.059> whole<00:00:45.239> thing<00:00:45.510> is<00:00:45.890> so<00:00:46.890> if<00:00:47.129> you

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
the cabin the whole thing is so if you

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.970 
the cabin the whole thing is so if you
just<00:00:47.579> unbolt<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.360> bed<00:00:48.570> and<00:00:50.750> movie<00:00:51.750> the

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:51.980 
just unbolt the bed and movie the

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:57.439 
just unbolt the bed and movie the
backwards<00:00:53.329> probably<00:00:54.329> one<00:00:54.660> foot<00:00:55.170> only<00:00:56.239> will<00:00:57.239> be

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
backwards probably one foot only will be

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.340 
backwards probably one foot only will be
enough<00:00:58.010> just<00:00:59.010> slightly<00:00:59.250> backwards<00:01:00.079> but<00:01:01.079> will

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
enough just slightly backwards but will

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.380 
enough just slightly backwards but will
be<00:01:01.530> enough<00:01:01.800> to<00:01:02.010> enter<00:01:02.609> the<00:01:02.760> gas<00:01:02.940> tank<00:01:03.270> you

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
be enough to enter the gas tank you

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:04.729 
be enough to enter the gas tank you
don't<00:01:03.510> have<00:01:03.690> to<00:01:03.840> remove<00:01:04.140> it<00:01:04.290> you<00:01:04.350> don't<00:01:04.619> have

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
don't have to remove it you don't have

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:10.010 
don't have to remove it you don't have
to<00:01:04.890> drop<00:01:05.100> it<00:01:05.180> but<00:01:06.180> it's<00:01:06.810> it's<00:01:07.409> heavy<00:01:07.740> and<00:01:08.720> if<00:01:09.720> my

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
to drop it but it's it's heavy and if my

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.670 
to drop it but it's it's heavy and if my
means<00:01:10.290> I<00:01:10.590> have<00:01:10.740> to<00:01:10.979> drop<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.210> tank<00:01:12.630> now<00:01:13.500> of

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
means I have to drop the tank now of

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.940 
means I have to drop the tank now of
course<00:01:13.920> you<00:01:14.430> make<00:01:14.670> sure<00:01:14.939> that<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.390> tank<00:01:15.750> is<00:01:16.500> as

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
course you make sure that the tank is as

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.270 
course you make sure that the tank is as
empty<00:01:17.280> as<00:01:17.759> possible<00:01:18.680> before<00:01:19.680> you<00:01:19.770> start<00:01:20.100> this

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
empty as possible before you start this

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:26.090 
empty as possible before you start this
operation<00:01:21.470> you<00:01:22.820> ran<00:01:23.820> it<00:01:24.630> really<00:01:25.290> low<00:01:25.439> because

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
operation you ran it really low because

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.179 
operation you ran it really low because
look<00:01:26.340> how<00:01:26.520> long<00:01:26.759> it<00:01:27.000> is<00:01:27.439> this<00:01:28.439> is<00:01:28.680> the<00:01:28.860> front

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
look how long it is this is the front

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.859 
look how long it is this is the front
and<00:01:29.490> it<00:01:29.640> goes<00:01:29.850> all<00:01:30.150> the<00:01:30.180> way<00:01:30.420> to<00:01:31.040> the<00:01:32.040> back<00:01:32.250> here

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:32.869 
and it goes all the way to the back here

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:37.160 
and it goes all the way to the back here
so<00:01:33.869> that's<00:01:34.439> a<00:01:34.590> big<00:01:34.770> thing<00:01:35.009> to<00:01:35.430> drop<00:01:35.990> so<00:01:36.990> what<00:01:37.140> I

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
so that's a big thing to drop so what I

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.140 
so that's a big thing to drop so what I
will<00:01:37.439> do<00:01:37.619> I<00:01:37.890> will<00:01:38.040> remove<00:01:38.579> this<00:01:38.850> crossmember

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
will do I will remove this crossmember

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.149 
will do I will remove this crossmember
which<00:01:39.840> is<00:01:40.799> in<00:01:41.040> the<00:01:41.220> front<00:01:41.549> of<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:42.020> cap<00:01:43.130> then<00:01:44.130> I

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
which is in the front of the cap then I

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.569 
which is in the front of the cap then I
will<00:01:44.869> start<00:01:45.869> releasing<00:01:46.229> these<00:01:46.829> all<00:01:47.189> of<00:01:47.399> them

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
will start releasing these all of them

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.289 
will start releasing these all of them
are<00:01:47.790> 15s<00:01:48.479> these<00:01:48.689> are<00:01:48.869> all<00:01:48.990> 15<00:01:49.530> and<00:01:50.030> when<00:01:51.030> I<00:01:51.060> will

are 15s these are all 15 and when I will
be<00:01:51.450> at<00:01:51.570> the<00:01:51.750> end<00:01:51.930> it<00:01:52.680> will<00:01:52.860> be<00:01:52.979> still<00:01:53.250> hanging<00:01:53.670> I

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
be at the end it will be still hanging I

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:59.660 
be at the end it will be still hanging I
will<00:01:54.570> remove<00:01:55.310> two<00:01:56.509> fuel<00:01:57.509> lines<00:01:58.219> feet<00:01:59.219> under

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670

return one electrical connector and then

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.910 
return one electrical connector and then
there<00:02:05.520> is<00:02:05.670> also<00:02:06.180> don't<00:02:06.420> forget<00:02:06.600> the<00:02:06.920> filling

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
there is also don't forget the filling

the tank

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.309 
the tank
and<00:02:11.189> then<00:02:12.060> it<00:02:12.209> will<00:02:12.390> be<00:02:12.540> down<00:02:12.749> and<00:02:13.049> we<00:02:13.170> will

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
and then it will be down and we will

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:18.729 
and then it will be down and we will
continue<00:02:14.510> so<00:02:15.510> the<00:02:15.930> tank<00:02:16.230> is<00:02:16.379> outside<00:02:17.370> finally

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:18.739 
continue so the tank is outside finally

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:23.470 
continue so the tank is outside finally
it<00:02:19.739> took<00:02:19.920> me<00:02:20.159> a<00:02:20.189> lot<00:02:20.400> of<00:02:20.459> time<00:02:20.849> I<00:02:20.879> show<00:02:21.299> you<00:02:21.329> why

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
it took me a lot of time I show you why

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.319 
it took me a lot of time I show you why
it<00:02:24.480> was<00:02:24.840> easy<00:02:25.469> to<00:02:25.709> remove<00:02:26.249> the<00:02:26.879> mounting

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:27.329 
it was easy to remove the mounting

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:29.809 
it was easy to remove the mounting
brackets<00:02:27.900> which<00:02:28.469> I'll<00:02:28.739> here<00:02:29.159> that<00:02:29.400> it<00:02:29.639> was

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:29.819 
brackets which I'll here that it was

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:34.429 
brackets which I'll here that it was
okay<00:02:30.950> then<00:02:31.950> it<00:02:32.250> was<00:02:32.519> also<00:02:32.879> easy<00:02:33.359> to<00:02:33.599> unhook<00:02:34.260> the

00:02:34.429 --> 00:02:34.439 
okay then it was also easy to unhook the

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:38.569 
okay then it was also easy to unhook the
electric<00:02:35.010> connector<00:02:36.230> homepages<00:02:37.230> Ueno<00:02:37.579> was

this<00:02:44.340> one<00:02:45.169> that's<00:02:46.169> the<00:02:46.349> orientation<00:02:46.530> when<00:02:47.459> the

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:47.669 
this one that's the orientation when the

00:02:47.669 --> 00:02:49.399 
this one that's the orientation when the
clips<00:02:47.939> are<00:02:48.180> there<00:02:48.389> so<00:02:48.629> you<00:02:48.689> just<00:02:48.750> squeeze<00:02:49.139> it

00:02:49.399 --> 00:02:49.409 
clips are there so you just squeeze it

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:53.990 
clips are there so you just squeeze it
like<00:02:49.560> that<00:02:49.829> and<00:02:51.620> tube<00:02:52.620> just<00:02:52.919> went<00:02:53.189> off<00:02:53.459> slide

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
like that and tube just went off slide

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.110 
like that and tube just went off slide
off<00:02:54.180> nicely<00:02:55.099> but<00:02:56.099> it<00:02:56.250> was<00:02:56.430> almost<00:02:56.699> impossible

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
off nicely but it was almost impossible

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.379 
off nicely but it was almost impossible
to<00:02:57.900> get<00:02:58.079> on<00:02:58.290> this<00:02:58.469> one

00:02:59.379 --> 00:02:59.389 
to get on this one

00:02:59.389 --> 00:03:02.599 
to get on this one
there's<00:03:00.389> no<00:03:00.599> space<00:03:00.930> from<00:03:01.349> here<00:03:01.769> to<00:03:02.069> get<00:03:02.280> on<00:03:02.430> the

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:02.609 
there's no space from here to get on the

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:05.119 
there's no space from here to get on the
bottom<00:03:02.819> of<00:03:03.180> the<00:03:03.419> clip<00:03:03.689> there's<00:03:04.109> no<00:03:04.349> space<00:03:04.709> from

00:03:05.119 --> 00:03:05.129 
bottom of the clip there's no space from

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:08.569 
bottom of the clip there's no space from
anywhere<00:03:05.669> so<00:03:06.060> the<00:03:07.049> top<00:03:07.349> I<00:03:07.620> had<00:03:08.040> immediately

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:08.579 
anywhere so the top I had immediately

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:11.990 
anywhere so the top I had immediately
but<00:03:09.060> I<00:03:09.090> couldn't<00:03:09.599> undo<00:03:09.959> the<00:03:10.109> bottom<00:03:10.879> it's<00:03:11.879> a

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
but I couldn't undo the bottom it's a

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000 
but I couldn't undo the bottom it's a
bad<00:03:12.239> engineering<00:03:13.019> because<00:03:13.439> if<00:03:13.620> they<00:03:13.769> put

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
bad engineering because if they put

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.449 
bad engineering because if they put
these<00:03:14.189> clips<00:03:14.579> the<00:03:15.509> hoses<00:03:16.049> which<00:03:16.739> slide<00:03:17.099> on<00:03:17.310> it

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
these clips the hoses which slide on it

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:21.530 
these clips the hoses which slide on it
where<00:03:18.060> this<00:03:18.269> way<00:03:19.069> it<00:03:20.069> was<00:03:20.340> so<00:03:20.609> easy<00:03:20.639> if<00:03:21.209> it<00:03:21.329> was

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
where this way it was so easy if it was

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.259 
where this way it was so easy if it was
like<00:03:21.780> that<00:03:21.840> you<00:03:22.739> just<00:03:22.979> go<00:03:23.310> from<00:03:23.609> the<00:03:23.849> top<00:03:24.060> and

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
like that you just go from the top and

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:27.020 
like that you just go from the top and
so<00:03:24.870> and<00:03:25.169> it's<00:03:25.650> out<00:03:25.889> but<00:03:26.250> since<00:03:26.519> it's<00:03:26.759> there

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
so and it's out but since it's there

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.949 
so and it's out but since it's there
it's<00:03:27.930> difficult<00:03:28.590> on<00:03:28.829> this<00:03:29.009> one<00:03:29.280> reach<00:03:29.959> for

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
it's difficult on this one reach for

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:35.270 
it's difficult on this one reach for
underneath<00:03:31.379> that<00:03:31.769> clip<00:03:32.069> here<00:03:32.900> anyway<00:03:34.220> now<00:03:35.220> we

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
underneath that clip here anyway now we

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.580 
underneath that clip here anyway now we

how we will remove it while you can have

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:06.259 
how we will remove it while you can have
a<00:04:03.329> special<00:04:03.840> tool<00:04:04.079> which<00:04:04.439> will<00:04:04.650> grab<00:04:04.949> it<00:04:04.979> or<00:04:05.370> you

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:06.269 
a special tool which will grab it or you

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:08.599 
a special tool which will grab it or you
just<00:04:06.479> keep<00:04:06.989> the<00:04:07.289> screwdriver<00:04:07.949> and<00:04:08.400> a<00:04:08.579> hammer

just keep the screwdriver and a hammer

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:12.259 
just keep the screwdriver and a hammer
and<00:04:09.359> keep<00:04:09.989> tapping<00:04:10.319> here<00:04:11.069> and<00:04:11.250> then<00:04:11.819> you<00:04:11.969> can

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:12.269 
and keep tapping here and then you can

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:15.319 
and keep tapping here and then you can
go<00:04:12.479> here<00:04:12.959> and<00:04:13.199> then<00:04:13.739> you<00:04:13.889> go<00:04:14.099> here<00:04:14.609> and<00:04:14.759> you<00:04:14.939> go

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:15.329 
go here and then you go here and you go

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:18.680 
go here and then you go here and you go
here<00:04:15.599> and<00:04:15.870> by<00:04:16.109> very<00:04:16.469> slow<00:04:16.889> motion<00:04:17.579> you<00:04:18.329> remove

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
here and by very slow motion you remove

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:21.039 
here and by very slow motion you remove
that<00:04:18.719> ring<00:04:19.289> of<00:04:19.590> course<00:04:20.250> counterclockwise

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:21.049 
that ring of course counterclockwise

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:24.190 
that ring of course counterclockwise
rotation<00:04:22.049> and<00:04:22.289> you<00:04:22.550> are<00:04:23.550> able<00:04:23.760> to

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:24.200 
rotation and you are able to

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.890 
rotation and you are able to
remove<00:04:24.530> the<00:04:24.770> module<00:04:25.610> out<00:04:26.060> so<00:04:26.390> let's<00:04:26.660> do<00:04:26.780> it

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:26.900 
remove the module out so let's do it

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:30.190 
remove the module out so let's do it
right<00:04:27.110> now<00:04:28.690> here<00:04:29.690> we<00:04:29.810> go

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:30.200 
right now here we go

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:33.040 
right now here we go
the<00:04:30.590> whole<00:04:30.830> unit<00:04:31.340> is<00:04:31.490> out<00:04:31.790> and<00:04:32.240> this<00:04:32.630> is<00:04:32.840> it

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.050 
the whole unit is out and this is it

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:36.370 
the whole unit is out and this is it
this<00:04:33.380> is<00:04:33.560> the<00:04:33.740> moment<00:04:33.980> I<00:04:34.340> was<00:04:34.550> waiting<00:04:34.580> for<00:04:35.380> to

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:36.380 
this is the moment I was waiting for to

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:43.030 
this is the moment I was waiting for to
see<00:04:38.020> how<00:04:39.020> it<00:04:39.260> is<00:04:40.030> connected<00:04:41.030> all<00:04:41.270> and<00:04:42.040> I

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:43.040 
see how it is connected all and I

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:46.120 
see how it is connected all and I
couldn't<00:04:43.400> find<00:04:43.580> it<00:04:43.760> anywhere<00:04:43.850> online<00:04:45.070> so<00:04:46.070> as

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:46.130 
couldn't find it anywhere online so as

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:49.780 
couldn't find it anywhere online so as
we<00:04:46.370> said<00:04:47.410> this<00:04:48.410> is<00:04:48.620> the<00:04:48.830> feed<00:04:49.100> this<00:04:49.400> is<00:04:49.580> the

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:49.790 
we said this is the feed this is the

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:53.310 
we said this is the feed this is the
return<00:04:50.440> rollover<00:04:51.440> well<00:04:51.680> and<00:04:52.040> this<00:04:52.130> is<00:04:52.340> plug

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:53.320 
return rollover well and this is plug

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:57.190 
return rollover well and this is plug
like<00:04:54.320> one<00:04:54.680> actually<00:04:55.670> has<00:04:55.970> a<00:04:56.000> hose<00:04:56.300> coming<00:04:56.870> down

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:57.200 
like one actually has a hose coming down

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:05.110 
like one actually has a hose coming down
on<00:04:57.440> the<00:04:57.560> outside<00:04:58.690> of<00:04:59.690> the<00:05:00.020> container<00:05:03.880> now<00:05:04.880> what

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:05.120 
on the outside of the container now what

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:15.700 
on the outside of the container now what
we<00:05:05.270> can<00:05:05.480> see<00:05:06.490> this<00:05:07.490> is<00:05:07.760> our<00:05:10.090> fuel<00:05:11.090> gage<00:05:14.710> hookup

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:15.710 
we can see this is our fuel gage hookup

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:19.300 
we can see this is our fuel gage hookup
for<00:05:16.010> them<00:05:16.330> for<00:05:17.330> the<00:05:17.540> level<00:05:17.780> in<00:05:17.990> the<00:05:18.170> time<00:05:18.410> so<00:05:19.160> it

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:19.310 
for them for the level in the time so it

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:23.620 
for them for the level in the time so it
has<00:05:19.460> that<00:05:19.700> blue<00:05:20.240> two<00:05:20.960> blue<00:05:20.990> wires<00:05:22.210> and<00:05:23.210> this<00:05:23.450> is

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:23.630 
has that blue two blue wires and this is

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:28.750 
has that blue two blue wires and this is
the<00:05:23.780> tiny<00:05:24.490> thumb<00:05:26.230> it's<00:05:27.230> basically<00:05:27.830> the<00:05:28.490> pump

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:28.760 
the tiny thumb it's basically the pump

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:31.000 
the tiny thumb it's basically the pump
supplying<00:05:29.240> all<00:05:29.690> the<00:05:29.900> fuel<00:05:30.230> pressure<00:05:30.560> which

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:31.010 
supplying all the fuel pressure which

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:33.850 
supplying all the fuel pressure which
wasn't<00:05:31.520> enough<00:05:31.760> you<00:05:32.660> can<00:05:32.870> see<00:05:33.110> down<00:05:33.290> there<00:05:33.590> the

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:33.860 
wasn't enough you can see down there the

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:36.820 
wasn't enough you can see down there the
filter<00:05:34.340> can<00:05:35.240> see<00:05:35.480> it's<00:05:35.600> slightly<00:05:35.780> dirty<00:05:36.320> so

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:36.830 
filter can see it's slightly dirty so

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:47.650 
filter can see it's slightly dirty so
it's<00:05:36.950> working<00:05:37.340> correctly<00:05:44.320> so<00:05:46.360> basically<00:05:47.360> this

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:47.660 
it's working correctly so basically this

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:50.980 
it's working correctly so basically this
is<00:05:48.040> the<00:05:49.040> whole<00:05:49.250> thing<00:05:49.670> you<00:05:50.150> can<00:05:50.420> see<00:05:50.660> again

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:50.990 
is the whole thing you can see again

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:54.460 
is the whole thing you can see again
this<00:05:51.290> is<00:05:51.500> the<00:05:51.680> return<00:05:52.270> it<00:05:53.270> returns<00:05:53.810> the<00:05:54.170> fuel

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:54.470 
this is the return it returns the fuel

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:58.840 
this is the return it returns the fuel
in<00:05:54.890> this<00:05:55.040> container<00:05:55.670> and<00:05:57.070> this<00:05:58.070> is<00:05:58.310> the<00:05:58.580> pump

00:05:58.840 --> 00:05:58.850 
in this container and this is the pump

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:02.320 
in this container and this is the pump
this<00:05:59.330> is<00:05:59.540> the<00:05:59.720> suction<00:06:00.230> which<00:06:00.890> goes<00:06:01.190> up<00:06:01.460> these

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:02.330 
this is the suction which goes up these

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:06.910 
this is the suction which goes up these
are<00:06:02.600> the<00:06:02.630> things<00:06:03.940> which<00:06:05.290> when<00:06:06.290> you<00:06:06.380> install<00:06:06.890> it

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:06.920 
are the things which when you install it

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:10.570 
are the things which when you install it
the<00:06:07.400> whole<00:06:07.610> thing<00:06:07.850> goes<00:06:08.090> down<00:06:08.140> and<00:06:09.140> see<00:06:09.580> it's

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:10.580 
the whole thing goes down and see it's

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:15.940 
the whole thing goes down and see it's
basically<00:06:11.210> pushing<00:06:12.940> very<00:06:13.940> pod<00:06:14.330> of<00:06:15.320> the<00:06:15.560> gas

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:15.950 
basically pushing very pod of the gas

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:18.730 
basically pushing very pod of the gas
tank<00:06:16.430> all<00:06:16.700> the<00:06:16.730> time<00:06:17.150> so<00:06:17.780> it's<00:06:17.930> not<00:06:18.110> in<00:06:18.260> there

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:18.740 
tank all the time so it's not in there

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:20.920 
tank all the time so it's not in there
but<00:06:18.950> it<00:06:19.190> sits<00:06:19.940> under

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:20.930 
but it sits under

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:25.100 
but it sits under
so<00:06:21.930> I<00:06:22.229> will<00:06:22.889> take<00:06:23.189> it<00:06:23.400> apart<00:06:23.789> I<00:06:24.150> will<00:06:24.689> get<00:06:24.870> rid

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:25.110 
so I will take it apart I will get rid

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:30.140 
so I will take it apart I will get rid
of<00:06:25.139> that<00:06:25.289> pump<00:06:25.710> and<00:06:26.150> I<00:06:27.150> will<00:06:27.389> figure<00:06:27.719> out<00:06:29.150> how

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:30.150 
of that pump and I will figure out how

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:33.230 
of that pump and I will figure out how
to<00:06:30.210> use<00:06:30.569> this<00:06:30.779> setup<00:06:31.400> without<00:06:32.400> drilling<00:06:32.909> in

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:33.240 
to use this setup without drilling in

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:35.830 
to use this setup without drilling in
the<00:06:33.389> tank<00:06:33.689> and<00:06:34.080> installing<00:06:34.590> all<00:06:34.860> these<00:06:35.069> straws

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:35.840 
the tank and installing all these straws

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:41.019 
the tank and installing all these straws
it<00:06:36.840> goes<00:06:37.050> once<00:06:37.439> again<00:06:37.830> this<00:06:38.039> is<00:06:38.249> the<00:06:38.400> budget

00:06:41.019 --> 00:06:41.029 

00:06:41.029 --> 00:06:45.649 

install<00:06:42.029> and<00:06:42.479> I'm<00:06:43.139> not<00:06:43.529> concerned<00:06:44.159> about<00:06:44.659> drag

00:06:45.649 --> 00:06:45.659 
install and I'm not concerned about drag

00:06:45.659 --> 00:06:47.929 
install and I'm not concerned about drag
racing<00:06:45.689> or<00:06:46.409> something<00:06:46.949> I<00:06:47.159> don't<00:06:47.610> want<00:06:47.789> to

00:06:47.929 --> 00:06:47.939 
racing or something I don't want to

00:06:47.939 --> 00:06:51.399 
racing or something I don't want to
increase<00:06:48.590> the<00:06:49.590> horsepower<00:06:49.740> on<00:06:50.310> the<00:06:50.639> engine

00:06:51.399 --> 00:06:51.409 
increase the horsepower on the engine

00:06:51.409 --> 00:06:55.700 
increase the horsepower on the engine
drastically<00:06:52.439> I<00:06:52.680> just<00:06:52.919> want<00:06:53.189> to<00:06:54.199> replace<00:06:55.199> this

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:55.710 
drastically I just want to replace this

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:58.670 
drastically I just want to replace this
pump<00:06:56.099> which<00:06:56.430> is<00:06:56.639> not<00:06:56.879> strong<00:06:57.330> enough<00:06:57.500> with<00:06:58.500> the

00:06:58.670 --> 00:06:58.680 
pump which is not strong enough with the

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:00.800 
pump which is not strong enough with the
fast<00:06:58.979> which<00:06:59.219> is<00:06:59.250> already<00:06:59.789> mounted<00:07:00.090> on<00:07:00.599> the

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:00.810 
fast which is already mounted on the

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:01.909 
fast which is already mounted on the
engine<00:07:01.439> book

00:07:01.909 --> 00:07:01.919 
engine book

00:07:01.919 --> 00:07:05.839 
engine book
so<00:07:02.849> I<00:07:03.270> will<00:07:03.990> show<00:07:04.199> you<00:07:04.229> later<00:07:04.430> what<00:07:05.430> I<00:07:05.490> figure

00:07:05.839 --> 00:07:05.849 
so I will show you later what I figure

00:07:05.849 --> 00:07:09.500 
so I will show you later what I figure
out<00:07:06.060> and<00:07:06.389> how<00:07:06.569> it<00:07:06.750> will<00:07:06.870> be<00:07:07.050> hooked<00:07:07.259> up
