color menu you need to clear it first so

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:44.040 
color menu you need to clear it first so
apply<00:01:37.640> the<00:01:38.290> HTML<00:01:40.060> method<00:01:41.060> to<00:01:41.570> the<00:01:41.750> color<00:01:42.590> menu

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:44.050 
apply the HTML method to the color menu

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:47.340 
apply the HTML method to the color menu
and<00:01:44.140> pass<00:01:45.010> it<00:01:45.280> an<00:01:45.460> empty<00:01:45.880> string<00:01:46.180> so<00:01:46.960> passing

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350 
and pass it an empty string so passing

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.080 
and pass it an empty string so passing
an<00:01:47.440> empty<00:01:47.710> string<00:01:48.010> to<00:01:48.190> the<00:01:48.310> HTML<00:01:48.880> method

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090 
an empty string to the HTML method

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.780 
an empty string to the HTML method
simply<00:01:49.870> removes<00:01:50.560> everything<00:01:51.190> between<00:01:51.400> the

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:51.790 
simply removes everything between the

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:56.499 
simply removes everything between the
opening<00:01:52.330> and<00:01:52.540> closing<00:01:53.050> select<00:01:53.440> tags

00:01:56.499 --> 00:01:56.509 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:00.069 

the<00:01:57.170> placeholder<00:01:58.159> option<00:01:58.610> uses<00:01:59.030> the<00:01:59.210> value<00:01:59.600> 0

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:00.079 
the placeholder option uses the value 0

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:03.370 
the placeholder option uses the value 0
so<00:02:00.680> if<00:02:00.979> the<00:02:01.460> value<00:02:01.850> is<00:02:02.060> anything<00:02:02.509> other<00:02:02.780> than<00:02:02.960> 0

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
so if the value is anything other than 0

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.730 
so if the value is anything other than 0
we<00:02:03.829> want<00:02:04.100> to<00:02:04.250> load<00:02:04.579> the<00:02:05.270> options<00:02:05.840> for<00:02:06.590> the

we want to load the options for the

other menu so that needs a conditional

other menu so that needs a conditional
statement<00:02:11.110> if<00:02:12.730> cell<00:02:14.920> is<00:02:15.920> not<00:02:16.190> equal<00:02:16.760> to<00:02:18.190> 0<00:02:23.110> we

anonymous function which will handle the

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:51.940 
anonymous function which will handle the
response<00:03:48.460> the<00:03:49.460> URL<00:03:50.060> is<00:03:50.450> made<00:03:50.840> up<00:03:51.080> of<00:03:51.260> data

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:51.950 
response the URL is made up of data

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:53.920 
response the URL is made up of data
which<00:03:52.400> is<00:03:52.580> the<00:03:52.790> name<00:03:52.970> of<00:03:53.000> the<00:03:53.330> folder<00:03:53.540> in<00:03:53.900> which

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930 
which is the name of the folder in which

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:56.890 
which is the name of the folder in which
the<00:03:54.140> text<00:03:54.560> files<00:03:54.830> are<00:03:55.130> stored<00:03:55.540> cell<00:03:56.540> is<00:03:56.720> the

the text files are stored cell is the

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.370 
the text files are stored cell is the
Selective<00:03:57.380> value<00:03:57.830> and<00:03:58.040> each<00:03:58.520> of<00:03:58.790> the<00:03:58.940> files

00:03:59.370 --> 00:03:59.380 
Selective value and each of the files

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:03.370 
Selective value and each of the files
uses<00:04:00.380> as<00:04:00.620> its<00:04:00.800> name<00:04:01.130> the<00:04:01.940> selected<00:04:02.840> value<00:04:03.200> so

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:03.380 
uses as its name the selected value so

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:05.020 
uses as its name the selected value so
it'll<00:04:03.650> be<00:04:03.800> fleece

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.030

this<00:04:10.160> simply<00:04:10.850> sends<00:04:11.630> a<00:04:11.690> message<00:04:12.020> to<00:04:12.050> the

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:12.260 
this simply sends a message to the

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:16.060 
this simply sends a message to the
server<00:04:12.590> and<00:04:12.920> loads<00:04:13.730> that<00:04:14.240> page<00:04:14.660> and<00:04:15.080> then

server and loads that page and then

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:18.250 
server and loads that page and then
we've<00:04:16.459> got<00:04:16.669> this<00:04:16.850> anonymous<00:04:17.419> function<00:04:17.450> to

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:18.260 
we've got this anonymous function to

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.789 
we've got this anonymous function to
handle<00:04:18.500> the<00:04:18.709> response<00:04:19.870> the<00:04:20.870> response<00:04:20.989> in<00:04:21.470> fact

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:21.799 
handle the response the response in fact

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:23.920 
handle the response the response in fact
is<00:04:21.980> something<00:04:22.220> like<00:04:22.490> this<00:04:22.700> the<00:04:23.030> option<00:04:23.630> tags

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:23.930 
is something like this the option tags

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:27.340 
is something like this the option tags
that<00:04:24.169> will<00:04:24.320> go<00:04:24.530> into<00:04:24.710> the<00:04:25.040> Select<00:04:25.610> element<00:04:26.350> so

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:27.350 
that will go into the Select element so

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:30.190 
that will go into the Select element so
here<00:04:27.740> in<00:04:27.919> the<00:04:28.300> function<00:04:29.300> which<00:04:29.510> handles<00:04:30.110> the

here in the function which handles the

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:33.280 
here in the function which handles the
response<00:04:30.800> we<00:04:31.520> need<00:04:31.550> to<00:04:31.910> use<00:04:32.120> the<00:04:32.390> HTML<00:04:32.870> method

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:33.290 
response we need to use the HTML method

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:38.200 
response we need to use the HTML method
to<00:04:34.040> populate<00:04:34.669> the<00:04:35.540> color<00:04:36.140> menu<00:04:36.910> with<00:04:37.910> those

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:38.210 
to populate the color menu with those

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:40.810 
to populate the color menu with those
option<00:04:38.690> tags<00:04:38.930> now<00:04:39.800> the<00:04:39.980> color<00:04:40.280> menu<00:04:40.669> is

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:40.820 
option tags now the color menu is

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:43.030 
option tags now the color menu is
currently<00:04:41.360> disabled<00:04:42.020> so<00:04:42.470> we<00:04:42.650> need<00:04:42.830> to

I'm going to create another change
handler<00:06:08.600> down<00:06:08.840> here<00:06:09.200> to<00:06:09.380> do<00:06:09.530> the<00:06:09.710> same<00:06:09.950> thing

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:10.280 
handler down here to do the same thing

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:13.510 
handler down here to do the same thing
with<00:06:10.610> the<00:06:10.880> color<00:06:11.360> menu<00:06:11.870> this<00:06:12.800> line<00:06:13.100> of<00:06:13.280> code

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:13.520 
with the color menu this line of code

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:15.520 
with the color menu this line of code
here<00:06:13.550> is<00:06:13.970> exactly<00:06:14.330> the<00:06:14.510> same<00:06:14.600> as<00:06:14.990> the<00:06:15.170> line<00:06:15.320> of

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:15.530 
here is exactly the same as the line of

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:17.080 
here is exactly the same as the line of
code<00:06:15.710> there<00:06:16.010> so<00:06:16.250> they're<00:06:16.490> both<00:06:16.670> doing<00:06:16.970> the

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:17.090 
code there so they're both doing the

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:19.000 
code there so they're both doing the
same<00:06:17.270> thing<00:06:17.750> just<00:06:18.110> removing<00:06:18.800> that

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:19.010 
same thing just removing that

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:21.850 
same thing just removing that
placeholder<00:06:19.910> and<00:06:20.200> that<00:06:21.200> completes<00:06:21.620> the

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:21.860 
placeholder and that completes the

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:23.830 
placeholder and that completes the
script<00:06:22.160> so<00:06:22.370> let's<00:06:22.580> just<00:06:22.880> test<00:06:23.120> it<00:06:23.330> to<00:06:23.510> see<00:06:23.540> that

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:23.840 
script so let's just test it to see that

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:28.870 
script so let's just test it to see that
it<00:06:23.930> works<00:06:24.170> save<00:06:25.330> go<00:06:26.330> into<00:06:26.570> live<00:06:26.810> view<00:06:27.880> choose

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:28.880 
it works save go into live view choose

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:32.500 
it works save go into live view choose
polo<00:06:29.870> shirt<00:06:30.170> and<00:06:30.490> there<00:06:31.490> we<00:06:31.580> have<00:06:31.730> a<00:06:31.970> range<00:06:32.300> of

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:32.510

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:39.290 
and a different range of colors so

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:41.620 
and a different range of colors so
that's<00:06:40.160> how<00:06:40.400> to<00:06:40.430> create<00:06:40.730> a<00:06:40.940> dependent

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:41.630 
that's how to create a dependent

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:43.750 
that's how to create a dependent
drop-down<00:06:41.750> menu<00:06:42.560> by<00:06:42.770> loading<00:06:43.190> the<00:06:43.310> options

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:43.760 
drop-down menu by loading the options

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:48.130

from<00:06:44.120> static<00:06:44.840> text<00:06:45.230> files<00:06:46.030> the<00:06:47.030> HTML<00:06:47.600> markup

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:48.140 
from static text files the HTML markup

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:50.920 
from static text files the HTML markup
in<00:06:48.380> the<00:06:48.500> static<00:06:48.920> text<00:06:49.160> file<00:06:49.520> simply<00:06:50.300> replaces

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:50.930 
in the static text file simply replaces

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:52.780 
in the static text file simply replaces
the<00:06:51.110> existing<00:06:51.230> options<00:06:52.010> in<00:06:52.190> the<00:06:52.310> dependent

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:52.790 
the existing options in the dependent

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:55.180 
the existing options in the dependent
menu<00:06:53.120> but<00:06:54.050> you<00:06:54.170> do<00:06:54.350> need<00:06:54.530> to<00:06:54.590> create<00:06:55.010> a

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:55.190 
menu but you do need to create a

00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:57.550 
menu but you do need to create a
separate<00:06:55.730> text<00:06:56.150> file<00:06:56.360> for<00:06:56.930> each<00:06:57.140> set<00:06:57.530> of
