00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.139 

let's<00:00:01.380> see<00:00:01.530> an<00:00:01.589> example<00:00:01.709> of<00:00:02.220> annotations

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:03.149 
let's see an example of annotations

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:05.420 
let's see an example of annotations
inside<00:00:03.540> schedule<00:00:03.959> designer<00:00:04.290> so<00:00:05.009> in<00:00:05.160> this<00:00:05.220> case

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
inside schedule designer so in this case

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.700 
inside schedule designer so in this case
we<00:00:05.670> are<00:00:05.700> starting<00:00:06.029> with<00:00:06.390> a<00:00:06.629> model<00:00:07.109> in<00:00:07.200> AutoCAD

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
we are starting with a model in AutoCAD

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.669 
we are starting with a model in AutoCAD
will<00:00:07.919> go<00:00:08.550> to<00:00:08.610> a<00:00:09.210> new<00:00:09.450> layout<00:00:09.809> in<00:00:10.260> paper<00:00:10.559> space

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
will go to a new layout in paper space

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.120 
will go to a new layout in paper space
in<00:00:11.219> which<00:00:11.759> we<00:00:12.150> can<00:00:12.330> define<00:00:12.690> the<00:00:13.500> resolution

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
in which we can define the resolution

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:15.770 
in which we can define the resolution
and<00:00:14.280> the<00:00:14.370> size<00:00:14.580> of<00:00:14.670> the<00:00:14.820> page<00:00:15.030> directly<00:00:15.660> from

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
and the size of the page directly from

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.529 
and the size of the page directly from
this<00:00:16.350> option<00:00:16.859> that<00:00:17.190> the<00:00:17.910> schedule<00:00:18.270> designer

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
this option that the schedule designer

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.340 
this option that the schedule designer
tab<00:00:18.869> has<00:00:19.500> and<00:00:20.119> once<00:00:21.119> we<00:00:21.270> have<00:00:21.420> that<00:00:21.449> we<00:00:21.689> will

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
tab has and once we have that we will

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.710 
tab has and once we have that we will
basically<00:00:22.890> have<00:00:23.070> to<00:00:23.369> create<00:00:23.640> a<00:00:23.820> viewport<00:00:24.390> so

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
basically have to create a viewport so

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:25.970 
basically have to create a viewport so
there<00:00:24.900> are<00:00:24.960> multiple<00:00:25.199> ways<00:00:25.320> for<00:00:25.650> doing<00:00:25.830> that

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
there are multiple ways for doing that

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.800 
there are multiple ways for doing that
one<00:00:26.250> of<00:00:26.340> them<00:00:26.490> is<00:00:26.519> going<00:00:26.640> to<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:27.119> View<00:00:27.300> tab<00:00:27.330> in

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
one of them is going to the View tab in

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.689 
one of them is going to the View tab in
the<00:00:28.230> ribbon<00:00:28.260> and<00:00:28.740> going<00:00:29.279> to<00:00:29.369> rectangular

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
the ribbon and going to rectangular

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.120 
the ribbon and going to rectangular
viewport<00:00:30.210> so<00:00:30.390> here<00:00:30.599> I<00:00:30.630> gun<00:00:30.900> I<00:00:31.109> have<00:00:31.650> my<00:00:31.859> view

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
viewport so here I gun I have my view

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.850 
viewport so here I gun I have my view
ports<00:00:32.489> I<00:00:32.610> can<00:00:32.940> of<00:00:33.030> course<00:00:33.059> zoom<00:00:33.719> in/out<00:00:34.050> orbit

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
ports I can of course zoom in/out orbit

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.620 
ports I can of course zoom in/out orbit
whatever<00:00:35.160> I<00:00:35.219> want<00:00:35.550> because<00:00:35.730> I'm<00:00:36.120> connected<00:00:36.600> to

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
whatever I want because I'm connected to

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.900 
whatever I want because I'm connected to
my<00:00:36.780> 3d<00:00:37.079> model<00:00:37.410> on<00:00:37.559> model<00:00:37.980> space<00:00:38.219> in<00:00:38.579> this

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
my 3d model on model space in this

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.360 
my 3d model on model space in this
particular<00:00:39.059> case<00:00:39.420> i<00:00:39.629> will<00:00:39.690> just<00:00:39.960> lock<00:00:40.680> the

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
particular case i will just lock the

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:42.860 
particular case i will just lock the
display<00:00:41.760> because<00:00:42.030> i<00:00:42.329> don't<00:00:42.480> want<00:00:42.510> to<00:00:42.660> change

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
display because i don't want to change

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.110 
display because i don't want to change
it<00:00:43.020> at<00:00:43.140> all<00:00:43.320> and<00:00:43.500> i<00:00:43.950> will<00:00:44.070> create<00:00:44.340> a<00:00:44.520> new<00:00:44.610> canvas

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
it at all and i will create a new canvas

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.959 
it at all and i will create a new canvas
on<00:00:45.539> top<00:00:45.840> of<00:00:45.989> it<00:00:46.110> i'll<00:00:46.320> go<00:00:46.980> into<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.370> option<00:00:47.850> of

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
on top of it i'll go into the option of

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.380 
on top of it i'll go into the option of
free<00:00:48.270> inspect<00:00:48.660> ratio<00:00:48.989> because<00:00:49.410> i<00:00:49.590> want<00:00:50.010> now<00:00:50.309> to

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:50.390 
free inspect ratio because i want now to

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.740 
free inspect ratio because i want now to
basically<00:00:51.500> match<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:53.160> size<00:00:53.399> and<00:00:53.699> ratio<00:00:54.149> of<00:00:54.420> my

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
basically match the size and ratio of my

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.900 
basically match the size and ratio of my
viewport<00:00:55.440> with<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:55.890> ratio<00:00:56.160> of<00:00:56.190> my<00:00:56.309> canvas<00:00:56.760> and

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
viewport with the ratio of my canvas and

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.930 
viewport with the ratio of my canvas and
I<00:00:57.360> go<00:00:57.660> to<00:00:57.719> create<00:00:58.350> page<00:00:58.649> underlay<00:00:59.219> on<00:00:59.430> because

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
I go to create page underlay on because

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.729 
I go to create page underlay on because
I<00:01:00.030> want<00:01:00.210> to<00:01:00.390> make<00:01:00.600> that<00:01:00.870> image<00:01:01.199> into<00:01:01.469> a

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
I want to make that image into a

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.520 
I want to make that image into a
sketchbook<00:01:02.340> designer<00:01:02.699> canvas<00:01:03.270> once<00:01:04.229> this<00:01:04.350> is

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
sketchbook designer canvas once this is

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.230 
sketchbook designer canvas once this is
finished<00:01:04.710> I<00:01:05.100> will<00:01:05.250> just<00:01:05.729> click<00:01:05.970> on<00:01:06.119> the

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
finished I will just click on the

finished I will just click on the
schedule<00:01:06.420> designer<00:01:07.070> button<00:01:08.070> so<00:01:08.340> it<00:01:08.580> goes<00:01:09.570> into

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
schedule designer button so it goes into

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.330

revision clouds or and enter text let's
not<00:01:23.159> think<00:01:23.400> about<00:01:23.580> these<00:01:24.030> invitations<00:01:24.270> as<00:01:24.810> a

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
not think about these invitations as a

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.440 
not think about these invitations as a
replacement<00:01:25.350> for<00:01:25.710> design<00:01:26.369> review<00:01:26.700> or<00:01:27.000> those

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
replacement for design review or those

replacement for design review or those
markers<00:01:27.780> in<00:01:27.930> particular<00:01:28.170> I<00:01:28.350> mean<00:01:28.500> you<00:01:28.619> can<00:01:28.740> use

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
markers in particular I mean you can use

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.370 
markers in particular I mean you can use
it<00:01:29.130> as<00:01:29.340> such<00:01:29.729> but<00:01:30.270> you<00:01:30.450> can<00:01:30.600> also<00:01:30.720> use<00:01:30.869> it<00:01:31.200> as

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
it as such but you can also use it as

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.020 
it as such but you can also use it as
just<00:01:31.740> an<00:01:31.890> enhancement<00:01:32.340> of<00:01:32.610> your<00:01:32.759> visual

say on your presentation so in this
particular<00:01:48.689> case<00:01:49.140> as<00:01:49.320> you<00:01:49.350> can<00:01:49.439> see<00:01:49.799> I<00:01:50.040> can

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
particular case as you can see I can

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.520 
particular case as you can see I can
either<00:01:50.490> go<00:01:50.850> to<00:01:50.880> a<00:01:51.060> paint<00:01:51.270> layer<00:01:51.509> and<00:01:51.780> do<00:01:52.049> some

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
either go to a paint layer and do some

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.039 
either go to a paint layer and do some
stroke<00:01:52.890> through<00:01:53.130> the<00:01:53.220> brushes<00:01:53.610> or<00:01:53.790> we<00:01:54.750> can<00:01:54.930> go

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
stroke through the brushes or we can go

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.289 
stroke through the brushes or we can go
into<00:01:55.200> a<00:01:55.320> vector<00:01:55.470> layer<00:01:55.799> and<00:01:56.100> then<00:01:56.820> I<00:01:56.880> will<00:01:57.149> get

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
into a vector layer and then I will get

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.539 
into a vector layer and then I will get
the<00:01:57.479> option<00:01:57.630> for<00:01:57.899> text<00:01:58.290> I<00:01:58.439> can<00:01:58.920> create<00:01:59.130> a<00:01:59.189> text

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
the option for text I can create a text

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.380 
the option for text I can create a text
just<00:01:59.700> like<00:01:59.969> in<00:02:00.210> any<00:02:00.450> basic<00:02:00.990> text<00:02:01.530> editor<00:02:01.979> and

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390 
just like in any basic text editor and

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.060 
just like in any basic text editor and
once<00:02:03.390> i'm<00:02:03.570> done<00:02:03.600> i<00:02:04.049> will<00:02:04.350> just<00:02:04.530> click<00:02:04.829> on<00:02:04.979> the

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
once i'm done i will just click on the

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.700 
once i'm done i will just click on the
check<00:02:05.250> mark<00:02:05.280> and<00:02:05.670> basically<00:02:06.540> i<00:02:06.659> have<00:02:07.110> what<00:02:07.680> i

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
check mark and basically i have what i

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.969 
check mark and basically i have what i
wanted<00:02:08.069> which<00:02:08.250> was<00:02:08.280> a<00:02:08.840> text<00:02:09.840> and<00:02:10.020> some<00:02:10.679> and

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
wanted which was a text and some and

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.559 
wanted which was a text and some and
some<00:02:11.009> brush<00:02:11.580> strokes<00:02:12.090> on<00:02:12.330> my

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
some brush strokes on my

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:15.569 
some brush strokes on my
on<00:02:13.689> my<00:02:13.930> canvas<00:02:14.260> so<00:02:14.620> I<00:02:14.650> could<00:02:15.040> then<00:02:15.189> go<00:02:15.340> back<00:02:15.519> to

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:15.579 
on my canvas so I could then go back to

00:02:15.579 --> 00:02:17.729 
on my canvas so I could then go back to
AutoCAD<00:02:16.150> and<00:02:16.180> just<00:02:16.569> in<00:02:16.900> the<00:02:17.019> presentation<00:02:17.379> get

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:17.739 
AutoCAD and just in the presentation get

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:20.539 
AutoCAD and just in the presentation get
that<00:02:17.889> information<00:02:18.129> so<00:02:18.760> again<00:02:19.420> both<00:02:19.749> as<00:02:20.019> a

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:20.549 
that information so again both as a

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:23.129 
that information so again both as a
notation<00:02:21.549> for<00:02:21.790> markups<00:02:22.299> or<00:02:22.450> invitations<00:02:22.659> for

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:27.869 
enhancing visual communications schedule
designer<00:02:25.599> allows<00:02:25.989> you<00:02:26.139> to<00:02:26.260> do<00:02:26.379> both<00:02:26.819> how<00:02:27.819> do
