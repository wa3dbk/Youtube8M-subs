00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:13.180
 hello to you all Julia and this video will be 

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:15.610
 about stamping from con from who on 

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:18.070
 My channel has long known that I am a fan 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:21.130
 Nova Art and today I will show how 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:24.700
 translate patterns that fill the whole 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:26.890
 I already put the nail plate base 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:29.980
 shade on which I will apply the picture 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:32.529
 You can use any varnish 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.780
 firm and any color important that 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:37.180
 the base color and color of the print on it 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:39.969
 beautifully combined before use 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.620
 do not forget to degrease the plate 

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:44.199
 die and scraper 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:47.289
 nail polish remover for picture i 

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:50.350
 I chose a light pink nail polish on Kona's 

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:52.480
 such a print on the plate and also to us 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:55.719
 need topcoat which 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:58.269
 will add shine and fix the picture after 

00:00:55.719 --> 00:01:01.030
 how the base color dried up can 

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:03.729
 start stemping fill the picture 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:06.190
 varnish for stemping can not fill 

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:08.350
 Completely the whole picture as a scraper 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:10.960
 fill the bottom myself 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:14.170
 excess varnish from the top of the picture 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:16.840
 now scraper at a 45 degree angle 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:19.770
 remove excess paint from the picture 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:22.660
 take a stamp and rolling motion 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:25.240
 we transfer drawing to its rubber 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:27.720
 pad now translate drawing on 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:30.760
 nail the same rolling motion 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.130
 you can do it at the vista as I 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:35.940
 you can put your hand on the table as you wish 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:38.710
 more comfortable and here's one leg point us ready 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:41.410
 Now you need to clean the liquid for 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:44.230
 nail polish dies and plate 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:47.860
 you can see that everything is cleared very 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:50.580
 easy and fast now apply varnish 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.580
 on drawing 

00:01:52.539 --> 00:02:00.820
 clean the scraper and remove excess varnish 

00:01:56.289 --> 00:02:03.920
 at an angle of 45 degrees 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:06.990
 typing on the stamp and translate 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:10.849
 him on the second leg 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.849
 main rolling motion 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:17.830
 here is the second leg ready, I will not 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:20.770
 show the application process at all 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:23.650
 ten fingers since the application pattern 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:27.310
 the same and now i'm starting to 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:29.620
 second hand do not forget to clean the disk 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:32.980
 die and scraper every time after 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:35.620
 use except that it is very 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:39.070
 beautiful i love konad stemping for 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:42.430
 that's very fast the whole process 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:45.239
 takes a maximum of 10 minutes and at the same time 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:48.280
 absolutely nothing complicated in the process 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:51.180
 konad stemping system handle even 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:53.560
 first grader a little practice 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:57.040
 look how beautiful and unusual 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:59.440
 nogotochki look and to make such 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:02.830
 I would need a brush drawing 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:05.470
 at least an hour and a half this is direct 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:08.230
 two year practice of painting nails 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:10.180
 I work in the nail industry and mine 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:12.820
 customers are very happy with what they can 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:15.610
 get a beautiful result at a minimum 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:16.150
 time spent and also can not 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:18.940
 to please 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.540
 a huge selection of prints for all occasions 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:21.790
 of life 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:24.100
 after the last video many me 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:26.920
 asked how long this keeps 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:29.440
 drawing in practice I noticed that on 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.840
 sibel depends on base coat 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:34.780
 which you use if you apply 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:37.360
 under the stamping is not a quality varnish which 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:38.890
 quickly peels off then eprint on it 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.590
 long does not rush 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:42.670
 if you use a good varnish in 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:44.650
 as a basis 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:47.709
 that is, the print he will hold 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:49.930
 fine when all the legs are already with 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:52.120
 pattern take a wand with a cotton 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:55.329
 sponge dip it in liquid for 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:57.100
 varnish remover and remove the varnish which 

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:58.920
 imprinted around the nail 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:00.489
 this process only takes a minute 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:03.220
 maximum one and a half 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:06.459
 and during this time the drawing will have time to dry 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:08.950
 and you can safely apply fixer because 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:12.579
 if you apply fixative on wet 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:15.519
 drawing it will be smeared with one stroke you 

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:17.769
 spoil all your efforts and believe 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:20.470
 will be very disappointing and will have to start 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:24.120
 it is better to wait anew 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:26.400
 dries I 'll show you a little closer 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:29.210
 all the drawings on it are very beautiful and for 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:32.250
 I love her very much and here he is the result 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:35.130
 as for me the combination of pink with 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:38.070
 everything looks very beautiful in purple 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:40.590
 very quickly beautifully original and 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:43.740
 believe your nails won't stay 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:46.860
 undetected everyone thank you for your attention and 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:49.440
 I wish you beautiful well-groomed pens because 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:52.010
 hands is a business card of each 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:52.010
 women
