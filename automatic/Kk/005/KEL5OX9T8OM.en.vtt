00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:06.150
 and so what's up, beauty video, what else? 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.160
 Hunters series of games and today I 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.650
 I got one more bad but I went 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.170
 because another bad manager 2014 here 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.420
 because it was who arrived one more 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:17.279
 just spare part who 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.470
 cares who starts to start a collection 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.550
 gamers im the oldest municipalities that 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.920
 I highly recommend trading for 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.289
 playstation that besides having many games 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.029
 so it 's an extremely easy to 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.189
 you find you meet the many 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.199
 so much that I have four that one should 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.850
 ask 'for more give me one and you have 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:36.510
 four because he has four and 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.760
 because not all of them work use as 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.559
 replacement part for example and if the 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.570
 fifth with a small problem in the 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.520
 control input is not known 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.860
 Control there today I went to the fair to see 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.539
 If I found anything I found this ps 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.190
 the only one to say if in passing 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.170
 are more in the video everyone else 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.789
 but because he is more 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.100
 white boy will already give a hint for you 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.170
 that entered the channel gave me I tested 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.480
 it worked really recommend you guys 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.309
 use it to give a legal deal in 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.530
 your consoles at the time you are so 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.350
 Newer when I paid for the team. 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.600
 The thymus was asking for a $ 30 in it myself. 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.240
 I said goodbye, I'm 20 here. 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.710
 Lord, you're still running. 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.659
 It's okay not to talk because the thing is 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.180
 using sinop plate ila 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.850
 Then I got tested the bad boy. 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:24.869
 is even running $ 20 the cannon of 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.670
 bring you the very cool little dgita 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.400
 I just do not have a page that was fine 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.560
 dirty seems to have knocked over the water 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.320
 bar anything above 5 and was 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.520
 very dirty even and with what the mp that is 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.860
 a tip I want to give you 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.960
 here also embedded in this episode of 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.369
 series of game hunters so it's a 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.829
 I want to start some tips for you. 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:46.229
 you also have to start a collection 

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:48.479
 is the unta had their consoles that 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.729
 registered in the channel would be used if 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.920
 creamy product that looks here 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.229
 Goal actually uses to clear box 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.200
 bathroom tile floor rubber 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:00.149
 plastic and sikkim specific is very good 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.399
 because I only put a sponge 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.799
 I rubbed it and it got gray. 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.509
 and here is the result of it he was 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.979
 more or less this way you can not 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:10.190
 realize the difference 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:12.260
 but it's a whopping difference of the two 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.120
 a little bit yellower after I 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.340
 I'm going to clean it, and the one who looks 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.870
 just how did he get very young a lot 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.810
 White right, right? 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.370
 Other than that, as the tip tells you here 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:24.680
 I intend to start a collection the 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.720
 playstation is an excellent tip you 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.730
 never had yourself ever had 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.800
 I'm sure great games you already have 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.510
 played here on an extremely 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.920
 easy you can achieve 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.410
 and why then sometimes I always 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.900
 I buy some more of them, right? 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:40.520
 despite this the problem is easier 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.070
 common occurrence on playstation is 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:45.140
 spoil his optical reader in case 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:47.300
 here the cannon and if that incredible it 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:50.210
 look like the southpaw it's okay the problem 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:52.400
 is the input of the control here so are 

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:55.040
 well recurring problems on this console 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:57.620
 he is very cheap, he pays more 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.960
 times you buy another console 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.600
 you buy a spare part 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:04.580
 in the case of atypical elections here 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.540
 if I find for 50 reais and I 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.640
 I paid 20 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.680
 this complete console running 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.390
 so sometimes it's worth your while 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.860
 take another, managed to leave it to the 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:15.110
 parts replacement 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:17.450
 this other thing I have but I took it 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:19.280
 his plate because he's with a 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:21.680
 Cool problem , I'll let it do 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.540
 this make a personalization in this house 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.070
 ps one year here to do one thing well 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:27.350
 interesting ne 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:29.360
 me too the same thing and if it was from here 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:31.760
 first thing I got when I started 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.530
 the collection that asks of video games as well 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.989
 the classic consoles nÃ© 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:37.670
 also only to attack him but not 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:40.519
 let go of the used part 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:42.830
 of the button to cover something, anyway 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:44.450
 who collects who wants to start a 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:46.250
 collection also recommends the 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:48.050
 playstation and super nintendo wii 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:49.910
 playstation is best for you to start 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:51.380
 because the games they are pretty cheap you 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:53.989
 can find enough parallel game 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:56.090
 you can still download there 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:57.950
 times on the internet record different 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:00.200
 super nintendo that even the paws today 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:01.340
 They are currently exploiting too much black. 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:04.940
 getting too expensive 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:06.350
 Even though we are finished and the conversion of 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:08.660
 computer video 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:11.269
 but then the people that invitation today that 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:14.390
 of some of the games that have the ps nic 

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:16.850
 cool for $ 20 running it 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:18.859
 came again here the tip of the 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:20.359
 playstation and that product that you 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:21.560
 clean them up, huh? 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:24.710
 again only for the sake of 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:27.590
 comparison looks at the difference that 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:28.700
 of a pilot this one was even worse than 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:30.440
 this one is 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:32.480
 because I'm going to give mole duck cool nor 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:34.250
 but I hope you enjoyed the video 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:36.310
 anything comments and until the next 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:36.310
 people
