when<00:03:27.130> I<00:03:27.190> stepped<00:03:27.700> on<00:03:27.910> this<00:03:28.060> vent<00:03:28.420> to<00:03:28.660> break<00:03:28.930> it

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:29.140 
when I stepped on this vent to break it

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:31.200 
when I stepped on this vent to break it
actually<00:03:29.860> didn't<00:03:30.190> step<00:03:30.490> all<00:03:30.700> the<00:03:30.730> way<00:03:30.880> through

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:31.210 
actually didn't step all the way through

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:36.240 
actually didn't step all the way through
it<00:03:31.360> I<00:03:32.310> just<00:03:33.450> simply<00:03:34.740> really<00:03:35.740> touched<00:03:35.950> it<00:03:36.130> with

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
it I just simply really touched it with

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:39.330 
it I just simply really touched it with
my<00:03:36.280> foot<00:03:36.670> and<00:03:37.560> it<00:03:38.560> cracked<00:03:38.890> it<00:03:39.100> pretty

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
my foot and it cracked it pretty

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:40.470 
my foot and it cracked it pretty
significantly

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 
significantly

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.860 
significantly
I<00:03:41.070> got<00:03:42.070> me<00:03:42.190> thinking<00:03:42.580> that<00:03:42.610> you<00:03:43.150> know<00:03:43.750> this

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 
I got me thinking that you know this

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:45.720 
I got me thinking that you know this
could<00:03:44.080> be<00:03:44.230> something<00:03:44.620> that<00:03:44.650> happened<00:03:45.190> during

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
could be something that happened during

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:49.440 
could be something that happened during
a<00:03:45.910> storm<00:03:46.209> if<00:03:47.140> we<00:03:47.350> were<00:03:47.500> to<00:03:48.010> be<00:03:48.130> using<00:03:48.340> the<00:03:48.760> the

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
a storm if we were to be using the the

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:52.800 
a storm if we were to be using the the
RV<00:03:49.900> in<00:03:50.350> a<00:03:50.500> situation<00:03:51.070> that<00:03:51.340> we<00:03:52.240> needed<00:03:52.450> it<00:03:52.660> as<00:03:52.780> a

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
RV in a situation that we needed it as a

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:58.680 
RV in a situation that we needed it as a
backup<00:03:53.140> and<00:03:53.910> a<00:03:55.290> light<00:03:56.290> hailstorm<00:03:57.010> or<00:03:57.970> even

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:58.690 
backup and a light hailstorm or even

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:01.530 
backup and a light hailstorm or even
some<00:03:58.870> branches<00:03:59.380> falling<00:04:00.269> even<00:04:01.269> though

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
some branches falling even though

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:03.180 
some branches falling even though
they're<00:04:01.690> not<00:04:01.720> significant<00:04:02.620> enough<00:04:02.800> to<00:04:03.010> hurt

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.190 
they're not significant enough to hurt

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:05.210 
they're not significant enough to hurt
the<00:04:03.400> RV<00:04:03.730> it<00:04:03.940> could<00:04:04.090> be<00:04:04.209> significant<00:04:04.750> enough<00:04:04.989> to

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
the RV it could be significant enough to

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:08.910 
the RV it could be significant enough to
crack<00:04:06.220> the<00:04:06.430> vent<00:04:06.640> covers<00:04:07.030> and<00:04:07.920> essentially

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:08.920 
crack the vent covers and essentially

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:12.240 
crack the vent covers and essentially
render<00:04:09.580> us<00:04:09.700> with<00:04:09.880> a<00:04:09.910> big<00:04:10.120> hole<00:04:10.360> in<00:04:10.390> earth<00:04:11.220> so<00:04:12.220> I

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250 
render us with a big hole in earth so I

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:13.560 
render us with a big hole in earth so I
think<00:04:12.340> that<00:04:12.670> this<00:04:12.790> is<00:04:12.970> going<00:04:13.120> to<00:04:13.180> be<00:04:13.300> one<00:04:13.480> of

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:13.570 
think that this is going to be one of

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:17.340 
think that this is going to be one of
the<00:04:13.690> things<00:04:13.870> that<00:04:14.260> I<00:04:14.790> store<00:04:15.790> an<00:04:16.150> extra<00:04:16.959> part<00:04:17.169> or

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:17.350 
the things that I store an extra part or

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:21.270 
the things that I store an extra part or
two<00:04:17.560> I<00:04:17.859> also<00:04:18.310> noticed<00:04:18.910> that<00:04:19.840> we<00:04:20.500> have<00:04:20.680> to<00:04:20.950> vent

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:21.280 
two I also noticed that we have to vent

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:24.030 
two I also noticed that we have to vent
covers<00:04:21.669> in<00:04:21.820> our<00:04:21.910> RV<00:04:22.090> and<00:04:22.860> they're<00:04:23.860> both

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:24.040 
covers in our RV and they're both

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:27.000 
covers in our RV and they're both
different<00:04:24.280> they<00:04:25.240> both<00:04:25.450> have<00:04:25.900> a<00:04:26.350> different

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.010 
different they both have a different

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:30.600 
different they both have a different
type<00:04:27.220> of<00:04:27.250> hinge<00:04:27.790> mechanism<00:04:29.070> which<00:04:30.070> means<00:04:30.370> that

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:30.610 
type of hinge mechanism which means that

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:34.380 
type of hinge mechanism which means that
I<00:04:30.640> can<00:04:30.880> either<00:04:31.030> store<00:04:31.680> one<00:04:32.680> of<00:04:32.710> each<00:04:33.040> or<00:04:33.430> I<00:04:33.940> can

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:34.390 
I can either store one of each or I can

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:38.760 
I can either store one of each or I can
replace<00:04:34.780> one<00:04:35.640> I<00:04:36.870> think<00:04:37.870> short<00:04:38.169> term<00:04:38.260> I'm<00:04:38.710> going

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:38.770 
replace one I think short term I'm going

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:42.150 
replace one I think short term I'm going
to<00:04:39.010> store<00:04:39.580> one<00:04:40.330> of<00:04:40.479> each<00:04:40.690> and<00:04:41.590> I<00:04:41.680> think<00:04:41.919> long

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:42.160 
to store one of each and I think long

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.909 
to store one of each and I think long
term<00:04:42.190> I'm<00:04:42.850> going<00:04:42.910> to<00:04:43.180> replace<00:04:43.540> one<00:04:43.840> or<00:04:44.140> both<00:04:44.860> of

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:44.919 
term I'm going to replace one or both of

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:48.600 
term I'm going to replace one or both of
the<00:04:45.220> vents<00:04:45.610> to<00:04:45.790> be<00:04:46.330> an<00:04:46.419> automatic<00:04:47.100> vent<00:04:48.100> system

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:48.610 
the vents to be an automatic vent system

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:52.350 
the vents to be an automatic vent system
that<00:04:48.850> I<00:04:48.880> can<00:04:49.210> turn<00:04:49.450> on<00:04:49.690> and<00:04:50.850> it<00:04:51.850> will<00:04:51.940> vent<00:04:52.210> it

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:52.360 
that I can turn on and it will vent it

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:53.520 
that I can turn on and it will vent it
if<00:04:52.510> it<00:04:52.660> gets<00:04:52.810> to<00:04:53.110> a<00:04:53.140> certain<00:04:53.260> temperature

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:53.530 
if it gets to a certain temperature

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:56.900 
if it gets to a certain temperature
inside<00:04:54.190> the<00:04:54.250> RV<00:04:54.729> and<00:04:55.350> if<00:04:56.350> it<00:04:56.470> starts<00:04:56.740> raining

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:56.910 
inside the RV and if it starts raining

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:00.180 
inside the RV and if it starts raining
they<00:04:57.910> close<00:04:58.270> on<00:04:58.300> their<00:04:58.660> own<00:04:58.690> and<00:04:59.140> shut<00:04:59.890> the<00:04:59.979> fan

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:00.190 
they close on their own and shut the fan

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:03.630 
they close on their own and shut the fan
down<00:05:00.540> that<00:05:01.540> way<00:05:01.750> I<00:05:01.780> can<00:05:02.320> control<00:05:02.979> the<00:05:03.190> heat<00:05:03.400> in

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:03.640 
down that way I can control the heat in

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:04.830 
down that way I can control the heat in
the<00:05:03.760> summer<00:05:04.000> time

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:04.840 
the summer time

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:09.000 
the summer time
I've<00:05:05.740> got<00:05:06.040> a<00:05:06.340> way<00:05:06.610> to<00:05:06.670> control<00:05:07.500> the<00:05:08.500> heat<00:05:08.740> in

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:09.010 
I've got a way to control the heat in

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:13.140 
I've got a way to control the heat in
the<00:05:09.100> wintertime<00:05:09.430> and<00:05:10.470> that<00:05:11.470> gives<00:05:11.710> me<00:05:11.830> a<00:05:12.310> way

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:13.150 
the wintertime and that gives me a way

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:14.760 
the wintertime and that gives me a way
to<00:05:13.180> control<00:05:13.600> it<00:05:13.720> in<00:05:13.870> the<00:05:13.960> summertime<00:05:14.260> as<00:05:14.560> well

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:14.770 
to control it in the summertime as well

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:17.159 
to control it in the summertime as well
but<00:05:15.100> I<00:05:15.160> think<00:05:15.250> short<00:05:15.639> term<00:05:15.730> I'm<00:05:16.240> going<00:05:17.050> to

00:05:17.159 --> 00:05:17.169 
but I think short term I'm going to

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:19.740 
but I think short term I'm going to
store<00:05:17.410> one<00:05:17.680> of<00:05:17.710> each<00:05:18.180> just<00:05:19.180> in<00:05:19.300> case<00:05:19.510> they're

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:19.750 
store one of each just in case they're

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:23.220 
store one of each just in case they're
relatively<00:05:20.260> cheap<00:05:20.560> and<00:05:21.870> seeing<00:05:22.870> this<00:05:23.020> how

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:23.230 
relatively cheap and seeing this how

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:27.090 
relatively cheap and seeing this how
easy<00:05:23.470> they<00:05:24.040> break<00:05:24.400> I<00:05:25.710> think<00:05:26.710> that<00:05:26.860> that<00:05:26.980> would

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:27.100 
easy they break I think that that would

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:31.590 
easy they break I think that that would
be<00:05:27.310> a<00:05:28.290> wise<00:05:29.290> decision<00:05:29.620> to<00:05:30.130> do<00:05:30.450> thanks<00:05:31.450> for

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:31.600 
be a wise decision to do thanks for

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:34.260 
be a wise decision to do thanks for
listening<00:05:31.990> and<00:05:32.669> we'll<00:05:33.669> see<00:05:33.910> you<00:05:34.030> back<00:05:34.060> again

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:34.270 
listening and we'll see you back again

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:38.220 
listening and we'll see you back again
very<00:05:34.930> soon<00:05:35.230> and<00:05:35.410> bugging<00:05:35.740> in<00:05:35.830> the<00:05:35.919> RV
