00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:08.930
 we have and of course tomorrow here 

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:11.330
 we will have the winner and the 

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:13.760
 finalists to be with us here 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:15.650
 are going to be catwalk of course we 

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:22.999
 they're going to sing too so they do not know 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:25.369
 lose add them to grab us and so 

00:00:22.999 --> 00:00:27.859
 be on jury 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:30.079
 and we are going to scale some measure we are going to 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:31.429
 put a point all cured because 

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:33.640
 now if we are going to put super 

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:33.640
 strict 

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:43.660
 but I do not have one that says water 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:43.660
 pass 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:57.760
 it's super good there's nothing else 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:07.110
 the pigeon 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:08.780
 and of course that good because his 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.050
 position the coffees between more egg and 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.050
 cassandra more 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.600
 because I like the color more and I say 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.840
 right now he got up there like he 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.909
 the dress is a little tight 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.460
 heras is to implement interference of a 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.610
 referring to Mrs. emma egg because it is 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:36.350
 a lady who does not know what she wants 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:36.350
 walk the man name 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.070
 do what 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:47.980
 but that's what I'm doing and I'm not going to 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:50.100
 let me not get jealous but I was 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:50.100
 make 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:56.549
 I think that nothing else she did in the 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.549
 mouth is a proper 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:00.380
 soon 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:09.820
 like seeing it right if I like it but 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:13.510
 I think if you had touched anything else 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:16.680
 white from below because from above 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.680
 even what I have left 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:25.410
 but the only one that really defends the 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.570
 love you feel for fabio is casandra 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:30.840
 elisabeth that with you you come across the 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:33.060
 Calladitas does not think anything 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.650
 but it is important to give them a second 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.180
 opportunity always to people 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.310
 remember that casandra was the 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:41.300
 first expelled and returned and returned 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.300
 with everything he put flavor 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:50.000
 what it is that there were many 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:53.250
 injustices from part of managua 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:56.480
 too many references to production 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.480
 protect her 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:04.280
 good but last time he also put on 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:05.930
 her bows the kiss and it was also what 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.330
 same 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:10.400
 the jury will have to qualify but there 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:11.870
 he did not want to change it 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.730
 Well, we'll be aware of the 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.980
 next Wednesday undoubtedly because 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:19.840
 his face is already fashionable today the house 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.840
 I see it with many possibilities 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:32.600
 here is because yesterday they met seven 

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:35.090
 years as silvia says and they had a 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:36.710
 very emotional program let's see him the 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:40.490

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:57.310
