00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:17.080
 hello what about diego boys maciÃ¡ nipples 

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:19.840
 we are in a uvi of gt5 online the one 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:21.849
 are to bring a trick to be able to surf 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.800
 below the water and a way to 

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:25.930
 improve the trick you had to do 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.310
 skate with the piece of titan and good the 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:29.170
 first step would be pending to this 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:31.510
 location here that is past the 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:33.790
 Ferris wheel crossing these several blue with 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:35.890
 a car and get on any of 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:39.030
 they just break it and what 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:41.980
 we would have to do is ride and 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.720
 take out a weapon I recommend that you take out 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.580
 a weapon that is not too big either 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:48.489
 like the mini gun because if not what 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:51.040
 will happen is that it will go out to take by sack 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:52.780
 the fence and we will not move like that 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.690
 to take a submachine gun or a rifle 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:58.239
 assault and start shooting and good if 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:00.580
 do you want to put the fence on the 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:02.650
 water and stay standing and 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:03.729
 shot from above her simply 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:05.920
 what we should do is 

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:07.630
 drag her shooting into the water 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.820
 This you can do it anywhere 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:12.220
 the only thing that will cost you a little 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:14.320
 take this fence here if you want 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:16.149
 save a little time you go down and you 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.280
 dais with the mini gun also without past 

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:21.460
 too much because if not as I said 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:23.500
 it will go far enough and good as 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.570
 you see here I was already taking it to the 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.280
 water and how are you going to see next 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:29.290
 once I have it under water 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:32.470
 keeps firing and I stay on top of 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:34.330
 she can get me deep enough and not 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:36.250
 I get the breathing bar can 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.170
 be below the water all the time 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.330
 I want to be inside the water once 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.460
 It's going to cost a bit more to handle it 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:45.070
 but in the end there would come a point in the 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.869
 that will pull forward and as you see already 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:49.119
 I'm under water I can just 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:50.530
 shoot I can stand up and the 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:52.210
 truth is that it is a pass so 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.979
