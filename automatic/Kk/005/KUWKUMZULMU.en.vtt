keyboard which is something that

task manager with the Windows 8 it's

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:24.530 
task manager with the Windows 8 it's

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.240 
going to work on both the tablet and the
computer<00:02:24.959> and<00:02:25.290> basically<00:02:25.560> this<00:02:25.920> is<00:02:25.980> going<00:02:26.190> to

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
computer and basically this is going to

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:27.649 
computer and basically this is going to
be<00:02:26.370> pretty<00:02:26.640> similar<00:02:26.849> to<00:02:27.000> the<00:02:27.180> old<00:02:27.209> task

00:02:27.649 --> 00:02:27.659 
be pretty similar to the old task

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:29.899 
be pretty similar to the old task
manager<00:02:28.170> so<00:02:28.440> it<00:02:28.500> allow<00:02:28.680> you<00:02:28.739> to<00:02:29.129> control<00:02:29.610> your

00:02:29.899 --> 00:02:29.909 
manager so it allow you to control your

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:32.569 
manager so it allow you to control your
processes<00:02:30.569> your<00:02:30.810> CPU<00:02:31.650> you<00:02:31.980> remember<00:02:32.280> usage

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:32.579 
processes your CPU you remember usage

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:34.699 
processes your CPU you remember usage
but<00:02:33.030> it<00:02:33.120> has<00:02:33.209> a<00:02:33.269> brand<00:02:33.659> new<00:02:33.810> user<00:02:34.110> interface<00:02:34.530> I

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
but it has a brand new user interface I

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:36.470 
but it has a brand new user interface I
think<00:02:34.890> it<00:02:34.980> looks<00:02:35.129> really<00:02:35.340> nice<00:02:35.610> and<00:02:35.909> clean

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
think it looks really nice and clean

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.390 
think it looks really nice and clean
next<00:02:36.930> up<00:02:37.170> there's<00:02:37.349> actually<00:02:37.620> a<00:02:37.680> brand<00:02:38.220> new

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
next up there's actually a brand new

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.880 
next up there's actually a brand new
security<00:02:39.239> lockscreen<00:02:39.810> for<00:02:40.260> Windows<00:02:40.560> 8<00:02:40.739> I

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
security lockscreen for Windows 8 I

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.559 
security lockscreen for Windows 8 I
think<00:02:41.129> this<00:02:41.220> is<00:02:41.370> really<00:02:41.640> cool<00:02:41.940> and<00:02:42.209> one<00:02:42.390> of<00:02:42.510> the

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569 
think this is really cool and one of the

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:43.819 
think this is really cool and one of the
features<00:02:42.870> that<00:02:42.900> I<00:02:43.049> actually<00:02:43.200> want<00:02:43.470> to<00:02:43.500> try<00:02:43.680> out

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:43.829 
features that I actually want to try out

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:45.710 
features that I actually want to try out
myself<00:02:44.010> basically<00:02:44.970> how<00:02:45.060> this<00:02:45.180> works<00:02:45.239> is

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
myself basically how this works is

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.750 
myself basically how this works is
instead<00:02:46.079> of<00:02:46.140> just<00:02:46.319> you<00:02:46.769> know<00:02:46.799> scrolling<00:02:47.370> up<00:02:47.519> to

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
instead of just you know scrolling up to

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.550 
instead of just you know scrolling up to
unlock<00:02:48.060> your<00:02:48.239> Windows<00:02:48.660> 8<00:02:48.780> computer<00:02:49.170> or<00:02:49.319> tablet

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
unlock your Windows 8 computer or tablet

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.920 
unlock your Windows 8 computer or tablet
you<00:02:49.920> actually<00:02:50.459> upload<00:02:50.849> a<00:02:50.879> picture<00:02:51.329> and<00:02:51.690> with

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
you actually upload a picture and with

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.949 
you actually upload a picture and with
this<00:02:52.049> picture<00:02:52.410> you<00:02:52.680> draw<00:02:53.069> on<00:02:53.280> the<00:02:53.430> picture<00:02:53.730> and

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:53.959 
this picture you draw on the picture and

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:56.210 
this picture you draw on the picture and
how<00:02:54.959> you<00:02:55.019> drew<00:02:55.349> on<00:02:55.500> that<00:02:55.530> that's<00:02:55.920> basically

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
how you drew on that that's basically

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.729 
how you drew on that that's basically
going<00:02:56.400> to<00:02:56.489> be<00:02:56.549> how<00:02:56.819> you<00:02:56.849> unlock<00:02:57.269> your<00:02:57.959> tablet

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
going to be how you unlock your tablet

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:00.860 
going to be how you unlock your tablet
so<00:02:59.190> for<00:02:59.340> example<00:02:59.700> you<00:02:59.849> upload<00:03:00.209> a<00:03:00.239> picture<00:03:00.480> of

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
so for example you upload a picture of

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.050 
so for example you upload a picture of

let's just say a book and you trace
along<00:03:03.209> the<00:03:03.480> four<00:03:03.720> different<00:03:04.019> sides<00:03:04.409> of<00:03:04.530> the

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
along the four different sides of the

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.349 
along the four different sides of the
books<00:03:04.890> and<00:03:05.159> you<00:03:05.489> just<00:03:05.609> do<00:03:05.700> it<00:03:05.819> and<00:03:05.970> at<00:03:06.150> one

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:06.359 
books and you just do it and at one

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:07.819 
books and you just do it and at one
motion<00:03:06.569> from<00:03:06.989> maybe<00:03:07.170> the<00:03:07.319> top<00:03:07.560> to<00:03:07.709> the<00:03:07.799> bottom

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:07.829 
motion from maybe the top to the bottom

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:09.860 
motion from maybe the top to the bottom
