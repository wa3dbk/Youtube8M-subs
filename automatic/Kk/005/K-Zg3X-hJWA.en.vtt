00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.090
 hi i have a video region for today 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.040
 you 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.890
 I just had a skin sticker 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:11.010
 got in and this means that 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.750
 yes, they are replacements for 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.950
 covers 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.809
 normal that just a case to you 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.100
 I don't call everyone that I do 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.260
 could for protection 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.029
 but what you disagree with is that there 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.830
 skin stickers are the stickers 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.769
 that you plant on your phone and that they me 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.900
 therefore need to be replaced 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.420
 photo phone cases I just got one 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.450
 received from phonegeek.nl and yes 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.550
 I am going to make one now and would 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.630
 just see what the word me is that 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.100
 it's all new 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.290
 I haven't opened it yet and we still 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:47.660
 not seen so yes let's just 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:51.210
 start make the opening that finds great 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:53.789
 ok i have to see such two inside 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:57.449
 I got the bush 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:59.699
 skinstickers or the rollerskater here and 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.079
 with tribe or not I want this very much 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.770
 try that clique him very cool 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.710
 look 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:07.619
 ok europe I'll explain what it is 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:10.470
 that's exactly what these are about stickers 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.990
 those on info blocks and this seems real 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.610
 a new rage of 2013 it 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.110
 shines in china when the big heat 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.220
 everyone seems to join him 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.380
 walk 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.640
 oh i do it's a phonegeek.nl there so 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.900
 by some of 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.680
 and they sell it for samsung 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.900
 galaxy s2 tn4 for the iphone 4 iphone 4s 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.570
 and iphone 5 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:33.210
 and so I just got 1004 this is 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:36.960
 waterproof dust free and it helps say 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:39.509
 but it protects against scratches 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.950
 on the contrary, I would say that as I do 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.530
 so often I would like to go use it 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.450
 nevertheless prefer a basic mowgli case 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.399
 just white is parts of paste and 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.020
 then these stickers over it 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.479
 it is just a very cheerful phone 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.049
 but I think that rap is just 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:56.700
 just don't give enough protection 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:59.100
 ohja van case is just for if you 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.450
 Phone that you are not too fast 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.190
 break pot chemistry 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:06.500
 so yes as a uber driver 5 astra 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:07.400
 a week so it doesn't mind a shoe though 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.900
 stick it on 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.630
 I am really curious how did it go 

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:14.060
 go ship because I have no idea 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.420
 how this works or what I think is must be removed 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.960
 get it 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:19.880
 oh yes we had them explained for the 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:22.280
 iphone you can paste it here 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.030
 back here according to me and at the 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.180
 side 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:28.250
 so you have one and say here 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.770
 front and back you have two here 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.480
 of those things on the side things up 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:35.830
 this back is just the Saturday 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.830
 just start with it 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:41.680
 why oh yes of course that and one 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.680
 special back 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.830
 because of this you will not have any glue residues 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.970
 come on or so he has you one more 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:48.530
 round 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:51.880
 you have to take it off other than stick 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.880
 camera that is not so smart either 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:03:01.210
 are you really super nice and I looked well 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:01.210
 how cheerful is this 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.530
 we are going to do 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.390
 he is ready and now my phone is 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.860
 completely covered 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.959
 I have to get used to it because now 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:38.640
 european the front 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:40.560
 warm color does take some getting used to 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:43.319
 for the rest , I like it very much 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:45.030
 work and just stick well i got there 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:46.980

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:48.900
 and it is really very elastic 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:51.300
 so put it easily can of the 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:53.790
