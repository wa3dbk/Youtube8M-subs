00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:08.219
 and now everyone greets them mister 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.259
 king over 119 and then here we are going to do 

00:00:08.219 --> 00:00:11.490
 a commented play game 

00:00:10.259 --> 00:00:13.259
 obviously that commented because I'm 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.240
 He is speaking but more than anything 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.949
 let's talk is halo 4 I'm going to 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.050
 ask game because he will know how to say 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.529
 the 4 if you have never talked about halo 4 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.660
 these videos or swimming 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.650
 neither giving information or anything like that 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.140
 good 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:32.160
 this time I will talk about halo 4 more than anything 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:35.060
 because the mind does 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.060
 2 days ago 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.950
 that came out that came out halo 4 inversion 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.630
 pirate and I said like pirates or 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.500
 everyone in the game already has a version 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:47.300
 pirate 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:52.220
 so investigate a little 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:56.829
 and it seems that 343 industries according to 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:58.850
 some say that 343 industries gave away 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:02.410
 copies of the game for his nephews 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.410
 good what some say 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:11.380
 and another one of iu that according to disque 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:14.280
 says they managed to steal some copies 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:18.550
 of what blockbuster or islands is like 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:22.270
 like gamestop or other wells other types 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:24.700
 of stores that they claimed stole 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.560
 let's say everything is a friend of what it is 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.570
 a store manager for example from 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:32.360
 blockbuster or toxic jeans 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:33.880
 and he says no because he came out hair 41 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.939
 who knows what 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.920
 telling you it came out but you direct or 

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:40.360
 how many who by the halo 4 does not right now 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.500
 from a teacher of the clubs how much 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:45.030
 you want 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.580
 let's say assuming 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.880
 so let's say that the boarding school that 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:54.030
 I want a thousand pesos for the gene version 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.979
 standard right now it's hot and 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.970
 everything although yes it is already good then 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:01.880
 get the thousand pesos projectors centuries 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:04.170
 4th century standard version good is a 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:07.520
 Assumption do not fear 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.520
 it is not a true 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.819
 a true story plus this assuming 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.819
 what could have happened 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.390
 and as well as optimal 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:25.510
 so they got between the four such 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.510
 time is what I think 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:30.540
 but even that bothers me a little because 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:32.849
 I see 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:35.280
 that we gamers are 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:40.790
 waiting for halo 4 good more than anything 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:40.790
 we've followed the ice 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:46.640
 I want you to do that I did not like it 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.190
 for nothing that is not low 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:53.150
 because they are also getting me many 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:54.740
 you can choose 4 that the henio profile 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.570
 4 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:59.710
 and that we are in the streaming of halo 4 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:59.710
 of what the campaign is 

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:06.480
 the truth I did not like that they make me 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:08.760
 very 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:11.040
 I dont know 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.830
 it makes me very bad security 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.320
 then what is it 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:17.480
 microsoft because according to me we have to 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:19.489
 to do that 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.730
 what is waiting for the moment because I have already 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:21.730
 killed 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:27.830
 although as I was doing according to me 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.630
 should be more should be more the 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:34.730
 security of what is 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:37.550
 from microsoft that do not do that because 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:38.900
 Well, it does not matter anymore about the 

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:41.390
 security because they no longer have 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:44.810
 some people I even knew that 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:46.730
 people from mexico already have the 4 that 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:49.070
 they also uploaded it to the internet and that 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:52.690
 you can download it well that 's what 

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:52.690
 is what interests me 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:04:00.050
 and there are also people who already 

00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:03.470
 they downloaded already have it in their xbox 

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:06.950
 pirate you could say but then none 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:08.280
 now we who are in this 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:10.260
 it's our turn 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.750
 you can wait 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:15.569
 every day three weeks are missing 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:17.870
 without any day I think I have to see the 

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:17.870
 calendar 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:24.000
 yes 

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:24.000
 it was transport 04 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:31.409
 but then no days that can be 

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:36.809
 do it they had some more personal 

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:40.770
 but I do not know anymore was because wait 

00:04:36.809 --> 00:04:43.470
 so many years for 04 to come out 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:45.810
 before it comes out let's say I think 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:50.539
 when the pirated copies come out I think 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:50.539
 four days ago I do not remember 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:55.680
 I was reading good I have not felt 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:55.680
 which people 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:01.680
 and the people of the third world let's say 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:03.260
 that they already have it and we do not have 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:06.630
 customers 

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:09.150
 that is, they did not follow the rules 

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:11.110
 but the truth is that all 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:14.969
 people go to the 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:18.310
 her mother's shell lived sweet 

00:05:14.969 --> 00:05:22.790
 a planet that does not 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:25.490
 as it is said it is nothing good spinal 

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:27.790
 good afternoon that they have the 

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:30.790
 copies and we do good 

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:32.980
 the game before all the external ones that 

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:34.650
 I was going out worldwide but I told them there 

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:36.280
 let's understand 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:39.289
 but then 

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:41.539
 I recommend you yes 

00:05:39.289 --> 00:05:44.509
 that those who know that they already have halo 4 and 

00:05:41.539 --> 00:05:46.819
 they want to see halo and all that and halo 4 of 

00:05:44.509 --> 00:05:49.309
 once the spoilers and I recommend them 

00:05:46.819 --> 00:05:52.189
 that you wait better that is more comfortable 

00:05:49.309 --> 00:05:54.110
 play it and more fun when I go out 

00:05:52.189 --> 00:05:57.439
 to have more emotion and more cravings 

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:59.180
 play it and know what is going on me 

00:05:57.439 --> 00:06:01.479
 I recommend that, but maybe if 

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:04.740
 you want to see the spoilers it is 

00:06:01.479 --> 00:06:07.349
 as if of your decision 

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:10.370
 but it would be advisable to wait 

00:06:07.349 --> 00:06:10.370
 to leave the English game 

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:16.190
 ok then we will stay everything is to wait and 

00:06:14.699 --> 00:06:19.100
 well 

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:22.190
 the truth, I hope that I have 

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:26.030
 liked the video and then we go to 

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:29.800
 the next michelle bernstein and up to the 

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:29.800
 next and chau
