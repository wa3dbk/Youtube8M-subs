00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:06.630

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:10.860
 what the fuck is I can not put little flags 

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:12.990
 with the right button the good milk then 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:17.310

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:19.140

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.529
 one that there is a clear one is clear 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.390

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:30.150
 here the thing sure a little more 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:34.699

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:39.360
 pains were followed by another one worth 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.510
 very well that there is one in three here not you 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:45.809
 it seems here there are 12 barac and no vale 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:48.330
 fuck what good that in good good here 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:51.089
 it is clear that there are two per cojones 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:54.449
 in these two they have to be so that the 

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:57.960
 we isolate let's see there we are 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:02.250
 rather than being one but fly and here 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:05.730
 I reach it two then it is here not 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.950
 good fuck hey eliminates a quadrant 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:10.950
 remove a quadrant come let's give it 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.500
 another time another another try the third 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.590
 is going to be 'because it is not said that 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.570
 this implies the one of the banner we go to it 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:20.790
 okay take this look this I loved 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.180
 I loved this, that is, you give it and 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:27.360
 Suddenly you have cleaned a car the map 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:29.100
 well well here this is fine this 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.020
 It will be fine and that will be fine 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.870
 we lock up now this is easy 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:38.140
 well let's see here 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:41.500
 and there can not be any because here already 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:44.680
 you have one detected and cornered let's see 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:46.660
 in this area detected with which 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:49.490
 You can get here, be here here 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:52.880
 here is a vale 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:55.220
 and here there are two but here there is only one 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.950
 detected so I'm going to run to the this 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:02.539
 this area and have not so 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:04.480
 identified let's see here for we have fuck 

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:08.490
 It could be anyone 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:08.490
 putada putada putada 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:15.930
 21 that is detected by one and is detected 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:18.730
 that we are going to surround we are going to surround fuck 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:22.810
 script get to this moment it gives me that 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:25.750
 it's relatively easy not but then already 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:28.090
 It is more fucking is more fucked to see 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.800
 this detected one which you can have 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.319
 this area fuck 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.870
 there is I have followed my instinct a little 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:38.260
 I was seeing what I was seeing 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:40.150
 but it's not especially my instinct and 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.410
 here this detects three I shit milk 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.220
 Well then these three have to be 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:48.940
 fucking pumps because we're not going to do it anymore 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:51.160
 let's go to it yes sir to fucking shit 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:54.069
 I've already trusted, start clicking on 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:56.080
 ping-pong but hey or a quarter of the 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:57.910
 good map I've really tried 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:01.030
 I have never thought that the Minesweeper is 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:03.190
 my true strong so nothing to put him 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:06.190
 a like if you liked here this 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:07.510
 I try and I want you to tell me 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.090
 Where did you come with the Minesweeper? 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.620
 because there are people who will not lend 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.840
 Attention but people who are going to be 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.540
 flawed in an incredible way and there will be 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.459
 given enough time and tientos to this 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.489
 so nothing we just see in the 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:20.489
 next
