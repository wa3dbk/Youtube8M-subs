 American Indians from an obvious 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:06.949
 built with the skins of dog animals 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:10.740
 with the passing of the 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.740
 men learned to build houses with stones 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.660
 they also made some beautiful castle

 suv laughter 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.170
 until one fine day 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.350
 Mr. Guido Martini began to build houses and respectful ones 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.700
 the environment is much more comfortable 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:59.930
 this evening 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.540
 very beautiful they didn't cost much 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.520
 but above all they were built with natural materials 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.849
 and certified capasso 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.849
 energy consumption 

00:02:12.999 --> 00:02:18.319

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.610
 in addition, people could choose from so many wax models I understood the holidays 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.900
 summer classic shows seconds 27 a simple decor 

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:33.329
 instead preferred modern home with an elegant style is a technology 

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:37.149
 very tanned but very easy to use 

00:02:37.899 --> 00:02:42.389
 they were houses built with biocompatible materials 

00:02:42.389 --> 00:02:46.499
 You could put it where you see it you see in the city by the sea 

00:02:46.499 --> 00:02:49.499

 it means that in harmony with nature and that it does not pollute like wood and wood 

00:03:00.169 --> 00:03:01.979
 natural stone 

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:05.729
 more when using technological devices against the 

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:06.469
 allergies 

00:03:06.469 --> 00:03:09.389
 there is no risk of getting sick 

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:13.509
 the only three months these things were ready while before I wanted to believe at least one 

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:14.289
 year 

00:03:14.289 --> 00:03:17.289
 so forced to the established one is the moment 

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:22.629
 also when you buy a house you talked to a single person from 

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:25.569
 to correct a team of professional architects 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:27.369
 they work only for you 

00:03:27.369 --> 00:03:31.620

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.260
 including the garden and the disciples 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.790
 that helped choose every little detail 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:40.969
 for maximum comfort 

00:03:40.969 --> 00:03:41.879
 duration 

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:45.520
 buying a house became great fun 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:50.070
 because your house was built around you just like a nice dress 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:51.749
 of tailors 

00:03:51.749 --> 00:03:57.119

00:03:57.119 --> 00:03:58.499
 new regulations 

00:03:58.499 --> 00:04:02.149
