you want to read it but basically it's

telling stylish so they're strong I'm
not<00:00:24.900> sure<00:00:25.080> what<00:00:25.230> the<00:00:25.350> Third<00:00:25.560> Point<00:00:25.590> what<00:00:26.039> is

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
not sure what the Third Point what is

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.160 
not sure what the Third Point what is
getting<00:00:26.460> that<00:00:26.580> if<00:00:27.269> someone<00:00:27.539> knows<00:00:27.750> then<00:00:28.050> let

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
getting that if someone knows then let

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.269 
getting that if someone knows then let
me<00:00:28.260> know<00:00:28.380> but<00:00:28.590> I<00:00:28.650> don't<00:00:28.769> think<00:00:28.859> it's<00:00:29.039> just<00:00:29.099> a

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
me know but I don't think it's just a

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.490 
me know but I don't think it's just a
generic<00:00:29.400> for<00:00:29.939> all<00:00:30.090> of<00:00:30.210> these<00:00:30.330> cases<00:00:30.750> because

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
generic for all of these cases because

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.889 
generic for all of these cases because
the<00:00:31.650> necklace<00:00:31.830> don't<00:00:32.160> have<00:00:32.279> a<00:00:32.309> flash<00:00:32.579> and<00:00:32.899> as

the necklace don't have a flash and as

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.540 
the necklace don't have a flash and as
it<00:00:34.110> says<00:00:34.260> all<00:00:34.559> the<00:00:34.649> buttons<00:00:34.950> and<00:00:35.040> controls<00:00:35.100> are

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
it says all the buttons and controls are

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.240 
it says all the buttons and controls are
excessively<00:00:35.989> easily<00:00:36.989> accessible<00:00:37.469> you<00:00:38.070> should

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
excessively easily accessible you should

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.819 
excessively easily accessible you should
expect<00:00:38.870> say<00:00:39.870> look<00:00:40.079> at<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.379> actual<00:00:40.620> case

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
expect say look at the actual case

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.520 
expect say look at the actual case
itself<00:00:41.309> so<00:00:42.180> as<00:00:42.239> you<00:00:42.360> can<00:00:42.480> see<00:00:42.540> it's<00:00:43.200> just<00:00:43.320> a

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
itself so as you can see it's just a

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.220 
itself so as you can see it's just a
four<00:00:43.770> is<00:00:43.860> just<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.190> backbone<00:00:44.399> it<00:00:44.760> does<00:00:45.420> just

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
four is just the backbone it does just

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.760 
four is just the backbone it does just
about<00:00:47.809> overlap<00:00:48.809> I<00:00:49.079> we're<00:00:49.320> not<00:00:49.410> even<00:00:49.649> talking

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
about overlap I we're not even talking

grills which I quite like as to the
sounds<00:01:53.460> still<00:01:53.700> sounds<00:01:53.970> the<00:01:54.030> same<00:01:54.619> then

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
sounds still sounds the same then

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.770 
sounds still sounds the same then
there's<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:56.009> headphone<00:01:56.520> port<00:01:56.820> which<00:01:57.509> as<00:01:57.659> you

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
there's the headphone port which as you

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.440 
there's the headphone port which as you
can<00:01:57.899> see<00:01:58.049> it's<00:01:58.560> also<00:01:58.740> it's<00:01:59.700> also<00:01:59.880> got<00:02:00.149> a<00:02:00.180> nice

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
can see it's also it's also got a nice

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.389 
can see it's also it's also got a nice
what's<00:02:01.229> really<00:02:01.530> a<00:02:01.560> bit<00:02:01.710> about<00:02:01.829> this<00:02:01.920> cases<00:02:02.250> is

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
what's really a bit about this cases is

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:05.179 
what's really a bit about this cases is
so<00:02:02.729> it's<00:02:03.360> got<00:02:03.570> a<00:02:03.600> bit<00:02:03.780> of<00:02:03.869> margins<00:02:04.350> so<00:02:05.070> if<00:02:05.130> you

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
so it's got a bit of margins so if you

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:06.620 
so it's got a bit of margins so if you
have<00:02:05.340> got<00:02:05.520> the<00:02:05.610> bigger<00:02:05.820> headphone<00:02:06.210> clip<00:02:06.479> you

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
have got the bigger headphone clip you

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.059 
have got the bigger headphone clip you
can<00:02:06.780> just<00:02:06.960> clip<00:02:07.170> it<00:02:07.200> in<00:02:07.409> without<00:02:07.710> having<00:02:07.979> to

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
can just clip it in without having to

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.949 
can just clip it in without having to
take<00:02:08.160> the<00:02:08.220> case<00:02:08.489> off<00:02:08.670> which<00:02:09.479> gets<00:02:09.720> annoying

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959

that<00:02:52.860> I<00:02:53.010> thought<00:02:53.250> was<00:02:53.370> real<00:02:53.670> rubbish<00:02:53.970> when<00:02:54.090> I

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
that I thought was real rubbish when I

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.420 
that I thought was real rubbish when I
first<00:02:54.420> got<00:02:54.570> it<00:02:54.720> because<00:02:54.870> the<00:02:54.959> print<00:02:55.170> stops<00:02:55.470> but

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
first got it because the print stops but

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.100 
first got it because the print stops but
when<00:02:56.610> you<00:02:56.700> put<00:02:56.820> on<00:02:56.910> the<00:02:57.000> Nexus<00:02:57.390> I'm<00:02:57.630> quite<00:02:57.959> like

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
when you put on the Nexus I'm quite like

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:59.840 
when you put on the Nexus I'm quite like
the<00:02:58.230> defects<00:02:58.709> and<00:02:58.860> speaking<00:02:59.519> of<00:02:59.610> print

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
the defects and speaking of print

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:02.210 
the defects and speaking of print
quality<00:03:00.410> it's<00:03:01.410> really<00:03:01.800> good

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
quality it's really good

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:03.949 
quality it's really good
the<00:03:02.489> middle<00:03:02.730> bits<00:03:02.940> of<00:03:03.150> the<00:03:03.209> pandas<00:03:03.569> eyes<00:03:03.720> in

the middle bits of the pandas eyes in

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:06.470 
the middle bits of the pandas eyes in
this<00:03:04.080> case<00:03:04.319> it's<00:03:04.980> really<00:03:05.040> focused<00:03:05.610> in<00:03:05.760> but

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
this case it's really focused in but

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.540 
this case it's really focused in but
then<00:03:06.600> as<00:03:06.810> you<00:03:07.019> do<00:03:07.230> go<00:03:07.410> out<00:03:07.440> a<00:03:07.560> bit<00:03:07.830> it<00:03:08.040> does<00:03:08.310> lose

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550 
then as you do go out a bit it does lose

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:10.309 
then as you do go out a bit it does lose
a<00:03:08.580> bit<00:03:08.850> of<00:03:08.880> quality<00:03:09.120> and<00:03:09.900> I<00:03:09.989> should<00:03:10.140> because

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:10.319 
a bit of quality and I should because

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:12.590 
a bit of quality and I should because

five stairs but my heart was on the

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:02.630 
five stairs but my heart was on the
floor<00:04:01.320> when<00:04:01.500> it<00:04:01.650> was<00:04:01.739> drops<00:04:02.010> and<00:04:02.220> it<00:04:02.280> did<00:04:02.459> line

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640 
floor when it was drops and it did line

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:03.920 
floor when it was drops and it did line
like<00:04:02.820> that<00:04:02.850> and<00:04:03.150> still<00:04:03.329> in<00:04:03.420> a<00:04:03.480> way<00:04:03.570> you<00:04:03.630> could

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
like that and still in a way you could

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:07.009 
like that and still in a way you could
say<00:04:03.959> the<00:04:04.290> corners<00:04:04.680> do<00:04:04.829> the<00:04:04.950> job<00:04:05.190> and<00:04:05.660> the<00:04:06.660> Nexus

00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:07.019 
say the corners do the job and the Nexus

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:09.229 
say the corners do the job and the Nexus
hasn't<00:04:07.350> got<00:04:07.500> any<00:04:07.739> visible<00:04:08.519> scars<00:04:08.670> from<00:04:09.030> that

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
hasn't got any visible scars from that

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:12.050 
hasn't got any visible scars from that
but<00:04:09.720> obviously<00:04:10.680> if<00:04:11.040> it<00:04:11.130> loves<00:04:11.280> like<00:04:11.459> that<00:04:11.640> you

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
but obviously if it loves like that you

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.150 
but obviously if it loves like that you
can<00:04:12.209> have<00:04:12.299> a<00:04:12.329> problem<00:04:12.780> so<00:04:13.709> I<00:04:13.739> would<00:04:13.980> recommend

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160
