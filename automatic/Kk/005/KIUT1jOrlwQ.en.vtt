00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:39.920 
of the year but this window even though

it's a real huge window but where is it
about<00:03:43.990> 40<00:03:44.990> feet<00:03:45.260> we're<00:03:45.800> going<00:03:46.040> to<00:03:46.310> diffuse<00:03:47.270> it

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480 
about 40 feet we're going to diffuse it

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.190 
about 40 feet we're going to diffuse it
further<00:03:47.900> with<00:03:48.770> a<00:03:48.800> special<00:03:49.960> diffusion<00:03:50.960> it's

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:51.200 
further with a special diffusion it's

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:55.660 
further with a special diffusion it's
made<00:03:51.800> by<00:03:52.010> Roscoe<00:03:52.610> it's<00:03:52.850> a<00:03:53.410> opal<00:03:54.410> top<00:03:54.950> frosted

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:55.670

Rosco<00:03:58.640> and<00:03:59.620> let<00:04:00.620> me<00:04:00.830> show<00:04:01.130> you<00:04:01.190> actually<00:04:01.700> the

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:01.910 
Rosco and let me show you actually the

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:04.450 
Rosco and let me show you actually the
reason<00:04:02.450> why<00:04:02.870> we<00:04:03.110> use<00:04:03.140> in<00:04:03.440> diffusion<00:04:03.830> even

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:04.460 
reason why we use in diffusion even

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:08.880 
reason why we use in diffusion even
though<00:04:04.550> the<00:04:04.730> window<00:04:05.060> is<00:04:05.240> so<00:04:05.780> big<00:04:06.970> it's<00:04:07.970> not

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:08.890 
though the window is so big it's not

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:10.610 
though the window is so big it's not
completely<00:04:09.890> on

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
completely on

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.699 
completely on
obstructed<00:04:11.340> if<00:04:12.330> you<00:04:12.690> can<00:04:12.959> see<00:04:13.260> there's<00:04:13.620> a

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
obstructed if you can see there's a

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:16.300 
obstructed if you can see there's a
garage<00:04:14.159> in<00:04:14.400> the<00:04:14.459> front<00:04:14.700> that's<00:04:14.940> blocks<00:04:15.299> about

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.310 
garage in the front that's blocks about

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:18.710 
garage in the front that's blocks about
you<00:04:17.310> know<00:04:17.430> third<00:04:17.760> of<00:04:17.940> the<00:04:18.060> window<00:04:18.389> there's<00:04:18.630> a

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
you know third of the window there's a

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.090 
you know third of the window there's a
building<00:04:19.049> on<00:04:19.229> the<00:04:19.260> left<00:04:19.500> there's<00:04:19.739> a<00:04:19.799> building

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:20.100 
building on the left there's a building

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:20.719 
building on the left there's a building

on the right

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:22.820 
on the right
there's<00:04:21.090> Empire<00:04:21.510> State<00:04:21.810> Building<00:04:22.320> blocking

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
there's Empire State Building blocking

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:25.270 
there's Empire State Building blocking
bunch<00:04:23.130> of<00:04:23.310> white<00:04:23.490> coming<00:04:23.760> from<00:04:24.030> the<00:04:24.180> top<00:04:24.389> and

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.280 
bunch of white coming from the top and

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.710 
bunch of white coming from the top and
we<00:04:26.280> can't<00:04:26.460> really<00:04:26.639> move<00:04:26.910> from<00:04:27.240> fire<00:04:27.449> State

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 
we can't really move from fire State

we can't really move from fire State
Building<00:04:28.080> guard<00:04:28.260> of<00:04:28.380> the<00:04:28.500> way<00:04:28.650> so<00:04:29.220> by<00:04:29.550> placing

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:29.880 
Building guard of the way so by placing

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.930 
Building guard of the way so by placing
this<00:04:30.710> diffusion<00:04:31.710> we<00:04:32.100> bring<00:04:32.550> in<00:04:32.699> the<00:04:32.820> light

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:32.940 
this diffusion we bring in the light

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:35.570 
this diffusion we bring in the light
source<00:04:33.389> closer<00:04:34.139> to<00:04:34.560> the<00:04:34.710> subject<00:04:35.160> and<00:04:35.310> the

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:35.580 
source closer to the subject and the

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:38.030 
source closer to the subject and the
reason<00:04:35.820> I'm<00:04:35.910> using<00:04:36.090> the<00:04:36.449> pulpit<00:04:37.290> of<00:04:37.530> Frost

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:38.040 
reason I'm using the pulpit of Frost

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:44.629 
reason I'm using the pulpit of Frost
because<00:04:39.000> it<00:04:40.220> makes<00:04:41.220> the<00:04:41.490> why<00:04:42.270> the<00:04:43.160> softer<00:04:44.160> but

00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:44.639 
because it makes the why the softer but

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:47.180 
because it makes the why the softer but
it<00:04:45.479> doesn't<00:04:45.870> make<00:04:45.990> it<00:04:46.050> too<00:04:46.410> flat<00:04:46.620> it<00:04:46.889> still

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.190 
it doesn't make it too flat it still

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:49.670 
it doesn't make it too flat it still
allows<00:04:47.669> a<00:04:47.699> lot<00:04:48.060> of<00:04:48.090> white<00:04:48.419> to<00:04:48.780> filter<00:04:49.169> in<00:04:49.470> and

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680 
allows a lot of white to filter in and

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.659 
allows a lot of white to filter in and
it<00:04:50.220> also<00:04:50.460> allows<00:04:50.789> white<00:04:51.120> to<00:04:51.830> focus<00:04:52.830> sort<00:04:53.580> of

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:53.669 
it also allows white to focus sort of

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:57.800 
it also allows white to focus sort of
simulating<00:04:54.360> the<00:04:55.169> actual<00:04:55.860> sunlight<00:04:56.400> okay<00:04:57.389> so

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:57.810 
simulating the actual sunlight okay so

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:01.730 
simulating the actual sunlight okay so
I'm<00:04:58.680> going<00:04:58.919> to<00:04:59.130> mount<00:04:59.460> the<00:04:59.820> diffusion<00:05:00.600> on<00:05:01.380> an

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:01.740 
I'm going to mount the diffusion on an

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:04.610 
I'm going to mount the diffusion on an
arm<00:05:01.979> that<00:05:02.370> they<00:05:02.760> see<00:05:03.180> on<00:05:03.330> the<00:05:03.449> system<00:05:03.990> it<00:05:04.410> comes

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:04.620 
arm that they see on the system it comes

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:07.159 
arm that they see on the system it comes
to<00:05:04.800> the<00:05:04.919> road<00:05:05.070> to<00:05:05.400> hold<00:05:06.330> up<00:05:06.510> frost<00:05:06.840> as<00:05:07.050> I

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:07.169 
to the road to hold up frost as I

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:14.329 
to the road to hold up frost as I
mentioned<00:05:07.560> earlier

00:05:14.329 --> 00:05:14.339 

00:05:14.339 --> 00:05:17.709 

it's<00:05:14.729> kind<00:05:14.909> of<00:05:14.999> similar<00:05:15.539> to<00:05:15.569> what<00:05:15.779> Robert<00:05:16.319> uses

00:05:17.709 --> 00:05:17.719 
it's kind of similar to what Robert uses

00:05:17.719 --> 00:05:20.629 
it's kind of similar to what Robert uses
the<00:05:18.719> well<00:05:18.929> but<00:05:19.559> the<00:05:19.799> difference<00:05:20.159> between<00:05:20.279> WA

00:05:20.629 --> 00:05:20.639 
the well but the difference between WA

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:26.089 
the well but the difference between WA
well<00:05:21.539> and<00:05:21.929> the<00:05:22.439> top<00:05:22.829> Rose<00:05:23.219> is<00:05:24.199> that<00:05:25.199> it's<00:05:25.829> much

00:05:26.089 --> 00:05:26.099 
well and the top Rose is that it's much

00:05:26.099 --> 00:05:29.059 
well and the top Rose is that it's much
more<00:05:26.159> exclusive<00:05:26.729> and<00:05:27.689> it<00:05:27.869> focuses<00:05:28.379> white<00:05:28.709> a

00:05:29.059 --> 00:05:29.069 
more exclusive and it focuses white a

00:05:29.069 --> 00:05:31.429 
more exclusive and it focuses white a
little<00:05:29.459> bit<00:05:29.579> better<00:05:29.849> so<00:05:30.209> as<00:05:30.479> you<00:05:30.779> can<00:05:31.079> see

00:05:31.429 --> 00:05:31.439 
little bit better so as you can see

00:05:31.439 --> 00:05:34.639 
little bit better so as you can see
though<00:05:32.309> it's<00:05:32.579> still<00:05:32.819> coming<00:05:33.179> through<00:05:33.509> so<00:05:34.439> they

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:34.649 
though it's still coming through so they

00:05:34.649 --> 00:05:37.779 
though it's still coming through so they
still<00:05:34.919> get<00:05:35.159> those<00:05:35.399> nice<00:05:35.819> nice<00:05:36.629> highlights<00:05:37.259> and

00:05:37.779 --> 00:05:37.789 
still get those nice nice highlights and

00:05:37.789 --> 00:05:40.489 
still get those nice nice highlights and
it<00:05:38.789> doesn't<00:05:39.209> really<00:05:39.389> change<00:05:39.509> the<00:05:40.139> nature<00:05:40.169> of

00:05:40.489 --> 00:05:40.499 
it doesn't really change the nature of

00:05:40.499 --> 00:05:41.979 
it doesn't really change the nature of
white<00:05:40.739> that<00:05:40.769> much

00:05:41.979 --> 00:05:41.989 
white that much

00:05:41.989 --> 00:05:46.489 
white that much
it<00:05:43.459> just<00:05:44.459> makes<00:05:44.669> our<00:05:44.909> light<00:05:45.209> source<00:05:45.569> a<00:05:45.899> little

00:05:46.489 --> 00:05:46.499 
it just makes our light source a little

00:05:46.499 --> 00:05:49.519 
it just makes our light source a little
bit<00:05:46.619> more<00:05:46.829> controllable<00:05:47.429> and<00:05:48.079> they<00:05:49.079> still<00:05:49.349> get

00:05:49.519 --> 00:05:49.529 
bit more controllable and they still get

00:05:49.529 --> 00:05:56.659 
bit more controllable and they still get
that<00:05:49.739> beautiful<00:05:50.149> soft<00:05:51.149> light<00:05:55.009> well<00:05:56.009> I<00:05:56.039> thought

00:05:56.659 --> 00:05:56.669 
that beautiful soft light well I thought

00:05:56.669 --> 00:05:58.789 
that beautiful soft light well I thought
it<00:05:56.789> might<00:05:56.969> be<00:05:57.119> a<00:05:57.149> good<00:05:57.329> idea<00:05:57.419> to<00:05:57.869> add<00:05:58.139> a<00:05:58.529> little

00:05:58.789 --> 00:05:58.799 
it might be a good idea to add a little

00:05:58.799 --> 00:05:59.959 
it might be a good idea to add a little
steam<00:05:59.219> to<00:05:59.369> the<00:05:59.399> soup<00:05:59.639> cause<00:05:59.789> you've<00:05:59.909> been

00:05:59.959 --> 00:05:59.969 
steam to the soup cause you've been

00:05:59.969 --> 00:06:02.479

00:06:02.479 --> 00:06:02.489 
sitting on a sudden it's not as hard as

00:06:02.489 --> 00:06:05.389 
sitting on a sudden it's not as hard as
it<00:06:02.639> was<00:06:02.989> so<00:06:03.989> what<00:06:04.739> I'm<00:06:04.799> going<00:06:04.979> to<00:06:05.009> do<00:06:05.129> I'm<00:06:05.219> going
