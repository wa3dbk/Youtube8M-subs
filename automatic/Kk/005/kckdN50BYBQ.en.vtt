00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:06.359
 I will tell you about how 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:07.400

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.380
 in the Internet 

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:12.929
 the domain name for the site is the site address 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.120
 this is the address people will enter 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.880
 your browser to come to your site 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.619
 for example yandex.ru 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.550
 this is the domain name of the site for 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:25.380

 commas no other characters only 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:53.210
 what is shown here is an important point 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:56.700
 without it will not work so here 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:05:00.320

 press the button to continue 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:04.640
 wait a little 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:14.840
 wait a little more 

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:26.530
 all extra 

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:29.140
 completed congratulations to you now you 

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:33.850

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:49.710
 there is still an important point we go to the point 

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:59.140
 domains 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:06:03.100
 my domains click on registered 

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:05.560
 domain and see here is the message 

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:07.830
 the fact is that domain registration 

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:11.650
 technically carried out for about an hour 

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:13.720
 so now we have to wait and if he 

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:15.820
 will not be active in an hour but rather 

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:17.740
 altogether it is active liquid will then you 

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:19.900
 need to contact support 

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:21.990
 but it happens very, very rarely 

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:28.510
 so I think that everything will be fine 

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:29.950
 let's wait one hour later we 

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:33.100
