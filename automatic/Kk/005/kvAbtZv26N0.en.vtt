00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:26.190
 hello youtube friends a long time ago 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:29.870
 makes a video tutorial I do not have the 

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:32.570
 extra time was very busy 

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:34.880
 well this video tutorial is treated well 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.380
 as it says in the video to solve the 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:39.390
 error 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:44.510
 of operation seven errors 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.510
 and good that many young is this error 

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:50.600
 that 's terror he says that memory does not 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:53.630
 could be real and the only solution that 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.870
 had age we had to finish the 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:55.870
 Program 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:03.480
 the solution is already available for 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:06.090
 windows 7 this does not work in view or 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:09.510
 in xp we do not test it in windows 8 no 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:12.540
 it works already what we already tested it provides it 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.130
 I'm on a friend's computer and I do not 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.830
 it works so with the same error 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.840
 So this one is good, he says he's going 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.270
 to return to windows 7 but still not 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:24.090
 is sure well the first thing that you have to 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.580
 to do is download the program that I 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.880
 I leave the link in the description of 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.880
 video 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.010
 we wait for 5 seconds 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.750
 but 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:48.050
 will take friend to the league page 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:09.220
 to the error 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:09.220
 7 9 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:18.700
 do not want to have downloaded we will leave 

00:02:13.329 --> 00:02:18.700
 a file so 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:25.459
 right click and extract here is going to 

00:02:23.689 --> 00:02:28.120
 Leave the folder called view 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:31.189
 resolved 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:35.970
 and good is going to leave an application 

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:37.590
 and another one that is 7 and some antics that does not 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:41.780
 we touch it for nothing we're going to grab 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.780
 is the one of except let's double- click 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.709
 and let's talk about what 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.330
 here we will leave this in case we 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:59.450
 I tell them it's compatible 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:01.390
 is going to close and this one appears to them 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.490
 screen and they give you between 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:07.420
 to see with the recommended configuration 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:09.090
 they give the installer not because they 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:12.250
 value 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:14.590
 and good is going to cut the video 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:18.970
 for installation and all that 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:21.920
 well have already installed it in the 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:24.459
 computer restarts it 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.459
 Y 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:30.660
 once we restart what we are going to do 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:35.390
 it is because he has loaded everything we go 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:37.860
 to go to screen resolution 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:40.740
 advanced duration 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:44.190
 and we are here where the swimmer says 

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:45.990
 problems we will appear is marked 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:48.240
 also make settings and go to 

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:50.010
 have a hairline that is up to the bottom 

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:52.340
 go up and we'll apply and 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.340
 we give 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:58.689
 once done this we get to 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:01.870
 operation 7 and we're going to unmark the 

00:03:58.689 --> 00:04:06.360
 box that is dynamic lighting or 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:08.850
 something like that we're going to uncheck it and 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:11.180
 it would be ready to try it 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:13.980
 I'll probably throw them error again 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:16.440
 this one so I recommend you first 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:17.459
 well all the video and then do the 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:19.320
 Steps 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:21.650
 then we may be going to throw away the 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:25.260
 error then what we are going to do is 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:28.890
 restart the computer restart the 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:30.000
 computer ok and well once started 

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:33.330
 is going to tell us that it is being updated 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.850
 ok let's leave normal when it comes back 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:37.770
 to turn on we will look like that again 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:39.510
 the version that we have that is going to us 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:43.680
 appear as we had before 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:48.580
 install it and well up there we go well 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:51.700
 ok once done this we go back 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:54.310
 to the installer 

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:56.560
 ok and they run it again they go back to 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:58.930
 install and re-start your 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:01.450

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:05.890
