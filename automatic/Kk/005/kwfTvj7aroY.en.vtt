00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:11.400
 This is a set of a series of legacy Yakso force 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:14.370
 produced in 2008 and therefore in 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:18.359
 case I even came to the country to 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:20.730
 make a review of this robot well let's 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:24.539
 let's start and I recovered it my own 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:29.359
 old parts that were not well here 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:33.800
 so we got a hunter million 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:36.059
 persons he has many details 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.210
 decorated essay decorated a 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:43.379

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:46.920

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:51.260
 two missiles on her shoulders and she sticker to 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:56.250
 sorry not worn out here she stayed in 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:58.350
 overall so its in the plant I can even 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.859
 show how he is such a chameleon such 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.250
 steep 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:08.430
 Well, let's go better on the table as I am there 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:09.479
 I can detail his indicator Well here 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.810
 such a set 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:17.460
 I restored the name of the hunter 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:19.100
 a million of them he has such 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:24.150
 cool legs 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:27.360
 spikes not the very body in which sits 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:31.259
 man hayato 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:34.100
 if I remember his name well, well 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:37.680
 Sorry from this man I'm lost 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:39.930
 face and torso remained only 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.509
 original hair and a face I will give him from 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:46.670
 he had such green stripes 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:49.430
 so we go into the complex 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:52.790
 Well, hair and I have only original 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:53.350
 did not stay and everything is such a mini 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:57.050
 figurine 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:02:00.040
 we can put him here any 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:03.500
 there are no controllers or stickers 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:06.320
 see nothing you matter here salami 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:09.050
 we can imagine that he has some 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:20.410
 the controller maybe eat let me 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:26.570
 I will plant him such a mechanism 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:30.230
 twist the claw at the back so it also rotates 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:33.830
 can move in different ways and so here 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:35.380
 legs are moving and all joints are moving 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:38.000
 move 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:43.270
 in the back they are very detailed but 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:49.870
 all zappos like that 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:52.520
 flamethrower and 2008 when the series 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:57.019
 they were here and not robots who 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:58.480
 helped so disconnect and in this set 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:04.900
 there was such a mini robot 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:08.720
 he had two katanas 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:12.799
 such a gun or mount and so is he 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:16.160
 the one-eyed robot looked like his weapon 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:19.870
 getting thinner like you 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:25.850
 see but still looked spectacular 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:28.580
 not so plant it pilots in 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:31.870
 Generally such is the set of milf hunter 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:36.940

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:40.810
