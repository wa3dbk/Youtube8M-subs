 presentation of the basics of water polo 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.809
 for a start let's see how 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:15.030
 build a water polo team 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:15.859
 we can count on it very players a 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.199
 guardian 

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:21.990
 six field players plus six 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.910
 replacements you should know that 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.010
 interpol the players have good places 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.220
 specific about this white attack 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.199
 the players who is at the end 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.579
 is called winger these are the players who 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.149
 swim more during a match 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.440
 Water Polo 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:39.090
 then we have half players then 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.020
 the most withdrawn player is called 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:45.780
 the honor the player who is in front 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.680
 the goalkeeper is called tip is the 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.090
 most difficult place at water polo 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.070
 Finally, it is important to know that at intercall 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:58.980
 everyone is attacking and everyone 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:01:00.840
 promotes the maximum area of the game to 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.199
 earth color is thirty meters long 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:07.650
 on 20 m wide there are two areas 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.570
 interspolos specific to the area of 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.510
 2 meters is materialized by the most 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.130
 red in the 2 m zone the player 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.290
 attacker can not receive 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.680
 balloons to me that the bar is there 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.680
 already find 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:25.500
 the 5 m zone is symbolized by the 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.390
 yellow pads in the area of ​​5 meters 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:31.320
 no free kick can be drawn 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:35.360
 directly to the goal finally the white bridge 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.360
 symbolizes the middle of the basin 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.659
 a water polo match lasts four times 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:43.000
 in eight minutes of actual playing time 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:45.100
 it may sound good to you but 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.820
 you have to know that the chrono stops at 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.860
 each stoppage of play 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:50.470
 that is for each bar exit 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:55.210
 for each goal scored or even for 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:56.979
 each fault so generally a 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:01.659
 water polo match lasts about a 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:03.670
 hour commitment to water polo will not 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:05.530
 does not like most sports this 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.659
 is not a draw beforehand 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:10.569
 but the ball is thrown in the middle of 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:12.850
 pelvis and these are the winger players who 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:14.980
 will recover the ball the team that 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:17.700
 catches the ball first takes the 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.700
 possession of ball 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.370
 the attacking team then thirty 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.150
 seconds to go to score or for 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.150
 trigger a shot 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:32.120
 water polo there are two types of faults 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:34.820
 the seven saints faults are materialized 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:37.690
 by a whistle and the game is 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:41.090
 stopped and the ball is returned 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:44.300
 beneficiaries of the fault without saying that a 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:46.430
 player as being a serious fault that's 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:48.650
 to say sink a player who does not have the 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:51.590
 balloon for example is awarded 20 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:53.840
 seconds destruction in prison a player 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:56.120
 who commits three serious mistakes during 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:03:00.700
 the same match and you definitely excluded 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.700
 of the match but it can be replaced
