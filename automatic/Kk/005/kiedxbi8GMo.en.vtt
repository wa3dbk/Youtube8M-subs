00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:22.429 
okay here's the new power puck setup and

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:24.460 
okay here's the new power puck setup and
this<00:00:22.609> is<00:00:22.759> why<00:00:22.970> it's<00:00:23.899> got<00:00:24.079> a<00:00:24.109> lot<00:00:24.230> of<00:00:24.380> new

this is why it's got a lot of new

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:26.950 
this is why it's got a lot of new
features<00:00:24.679> and<00:00:24.919> what<00:00:25.220> it<00:00:25.310> can<00:00:25.460> do<00:00:25.660> first<00:00:26.660> of<00:00:26.810> all

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:26.960 
features and what it can do first of all

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.659 
features and what it can do first of all
you'll<00:00:27.140> see<00:00:27.349> that<00:00:27.500> there's<00:00:27.710> four<00:00:28.009> tracks<00:00:28.429> on

00:00:28.659 --> 00:00:28.669 
you'll see that there's four tracks on

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:32.049 
you'll see that there's four tracks on
this<00:00:28.849> one<00:00:29.059> so<00:00:29.840> that<00:00:30.079> allows<00:00:30.439> us<00:00:30.469> to<00:00:30.739> do<00:00:30.980> RGB<00:00:31.759> or

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:32.059 
this one so that allows us to do RGB or

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:35.979 
this one so that allows us to do RGB or
color<00:00:32.960> changing<00:00:33.500> LEDs<00:00:34.030> RGB<00:00:35.030> stands<00:00:35.390> for<00:00:35.659> red

00:00:35.979 --> 00:00:35.989 
color changing LEDs RGB stands for red

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:39.520 
color changing LEDs RGB stands for red
blue<00:00:36.829> green<00:00:37.390> any<00:00:38.390> combination<00:00:39.050> of<00:00:39.110> those<00:00:39.260> will

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:39.530 
blue green any combination of those will

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:41.049 
blue green any combination of those will
give<00:00:39.710> you<00:00:39.800> a<00:00:39.860> covenant<00:00:40.100> or<00:00:40.460> it<00:00:40.610> will<00:00:40.790> give<00:00:40.940> you

give you a covenant or it will give you
a<00:00:41.089> different<00:00:41.420> color

00:00:45.549 --> 00:00:45.559 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:49.970 

now<00:00:46.559> the<00:00:46.980> way<00:00:47.129> your<00:00:48.230> power<00:00:49.230> puck<00:00:49.559> is<00:00:49.770> going<00:00:49.800> to

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
now the way your power puck is going to

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.389 
now the way your power puck is going to
get<00:00:50.100> mounted<00:00:50.750> is<00:00:51.750> with<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.379> little<00:00:53.070> squares

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
get mounted is with the little squares

00:00:53.399 --> 00:01:00.139 
get mounted is with the little squares
of<00:00:55.550> double<00:00:56.550> stick<00:00:56.730> and<00:00:57.000> velcro<00:00:57.510> you<00:00:59.030> can<00:01:00.030> see

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
of double stick and velcro you can see

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:05.680 
of double stick and velcro you can see
we've<00:01:00.329> got<00:01:00.360> one<00:01:00.540> two<00:01:01.379> three<00:01:01.800> four<00:01:03.860> and<00:01:04.860> five

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:05.690 
we've got one two three four and five

we've got one two three four and five
pieces<00:01:06.690> of<00:01:06.869> velcro<00:01:08.300> and<00:01:09.300> what<00:01:09.810> you'll<00:01:09.990> do<00:01:10.290> is

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
pieces of velcro and what you'll do is

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:17.950 
pieces of velcro and what you'll do is
essentially<00:01:11.009> just<00:01:12.259> screw<00:01:13.259> it<00:01:13.409> right<00:01:14.180> around

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.180 

and<00:01:18.410> you'll<00:01:18.560> stick<00:01:18.950> that<00:01:19.700> seam<00:01:20.120> back<00:01:20.390> together

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:21.190 
and you'll stick that seam back together

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:27.750 
and you'll stick that seam back together
now<00:01:22.190> we've<00:01:22.640> already<00:01:22.880> removed<00:01:23.240> the<00:01:25.210> film<00:01:26.210> from

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:27.760 
now we've already removed the film from

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:31.570 
now we've already removed the film from
the<00:01:28.760> double<00:01:29.090> stick<00:01:29.300> and<00:01:29.570> the<00:01:30.140> velcro<00:01:30.560> so<00:01:31.460> that

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:31.580 
the double stick and the velcro so that

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:33.820 
the double stick and the velcro so that
when<00:01:31.729> you<00:01:31.820> take<00:01:32.090> it<00:01:32.150> what<00:01:33.140> you<00:01:33.260> want<00:01:33.470> to<00:01:33.590> do<00:01:33.680> is

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:33.830 
when you take it what you want to do is

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:35.860 
when you take it what you want to do is
you<00:01:33.920> want<00:01:34.130> to<00:01:34.190> this<00:01:34.580> has<00:01:34.850> to<00:01:34.970> be<00:01:35.090> centered<00:01:35.690> in

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:35.870 
you want to this has to be centered in

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:38.350 
you want to this has to be centered in
the<00:01:36.170> wheel<00:01:36.350> very<00:01:36.650> importantly<00:01:37.250> now<00:01:37.940> we've<00:01:38.150> got

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
the wheel very importantly now we've got

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.060 
the wheel very importantly now we've got
that<00:01:38.600> in<00:01:38.780> place<00:01:38.960> and<00:01:39.380> another<00:01:39.770> thing<00:01:39.950> we

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
that in place and another thing we

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.060 
that in place and another thing we
should<00:01:40.100> mention<00:01:40.430> is<00:01:40.820> that<00:01:41.720> this<00:01:42.650> installation

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.070 
should mention is that this installation

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.730 
should mention is that this installation
is<00:01:43.430> essentially<00:01:43.940> identical<00:01:44.260> regardless<00:01:45.260> of

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
is essentially identical regardless of

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.420 
is essentially identical regardless of
bike<00:01:46.869> then<00:01:47.869> this<00:01:48.080> is<00:01:48.229> the<00:01:48.320> contact<00:01:48.770> unit<00:01:49.250> this

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:49.430 
bike then this is the contact unit this

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:51.219 
bike then this is the contact unit this
is<00:01:49.580> what's<00:01:49.760> going<00:01:49.880> to<00:01:49.940> be<00:01:50.030> contacting<00:01:50.869> the

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:51.229 
is what's going to be contacting the

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:53.620 
is what's going to be contacting the
ring<00:01:51.440> itself<00:01:51.800> you'll<00:01:52.759> see<00:01:53.000> we<00:01:53.149> have<00:01:53.180> four

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
ring itself you'll see we have four

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.740 
ring itself you'll see we have four
brushes<00:01:53.950> spring-loaded<00:01:55.360> that<00:01:56.360> are<00:01:56.479> in<00:01:56.570> this

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
brushes spring-loaded that are in this

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.830 
brushes spring-loaded that are in this
plastic<00:01:57.290> housing<00:01:57.970> so<00:01:58.970> if<00:01:59.030> we<00:01:59.180> take<00:01:59.450> it<00:01:59.660> we

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
plastic housing so if we take it we

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.210 
plastic housing so if we take it we
compress<00:02:00.290> it<00:02:00.440> against<00:02:00.649> the<00:02:00.830> wheel<00:02:02.920> then<00:02:03.920> take

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:04.220 
compress it against the wheel then take

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.910 
compress it against the wheel then take
our<00:02:04.399> bracket<00:02:04.700> that<00:02:05.060> we've<00:02:05.240> already<00:02:05.420> bent<00:02:05.920> put

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
our bracket that we've already bent put

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.760 
our bracket that we've already bent put
it<00:02:07.040> up<00:02:07.130> around<00:02:07.280> the<00:02:07.520> axle<00:02:08.060> then<00:02:09.050> just<00:02:09.380> swing<00:02:09.739> it

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:09.770 
it up around the axle then just swing it

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:13.830 
it up around the axle then just swing it
in<00:02:09.979> place<00:02:11.110> and<00:02:12.110> then<00:02:12.980> we've<00:02:13.190> got<00:02:13.430> these<00:02:13.730> two

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
in place and then we've got these two

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:19.479 
in place and then we've got these two
little<00:02:14.890> self<00:02:15.890> tapping<00:02:16.160> screws<00:02:17.800> now<00:02:18.800> these

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:19.489 
little self tapping screws now these

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:23.199 
little self tapping screws now these
four<00:02:19.880> wires<00:02:20.320> will<00:02:21.320> now<00:02:21.950> run<00:02:22.340> up<00:02:22.519> along<00:02:23.030> the

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
four wires will now run up along the

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:26.770 
four wires will now run up along the
brake<00:02:23.450> line<00:02:23.750> and<00:02:24.080> into<00:02:24.680> the<00:02:24.769> bike<00:02:25.660> kind<00:02:26.660> of

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
brake line and into the bike kind of

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.420 
brake line and into the bike kind of
what<00:02:26.870> we<00:02:26.989> didn't<00:02:27.320> show<00:02:27.500> you<00:02:27.530> and<00:02:28.070> we<00:02:28.160> should

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
what we didn't show you and we should

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.360 
what we didn't show you and we should
have<00:02:28.750> is<00:02:29.750> if<00:02:29.930> you<00:02:30.019> see<00:02:30.260> the<00:02:30.410> four<00:02:30.709> wires<00:02:31.040> that

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
have is if you see the four wires that

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.270 
have is if you see the four wires that
come<00:02:31.549> out<00:02:31.670> of<00:02:31.700> the<00:02:31.880> ring<00:02:32.650> in<00:02:33.650> this<00:02:33.830> case<00:02:34.040> we

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
come out of the ring in this case we

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.670 
come out of the ring in this case we
just<00:02:34.489> ran<00:02:34.670> it<00:02:34.760> right<00:02:34.820> through<00:02:35.120> the<00:02:35.239> rotor<00:02:35.680> and

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
just ran it right through the rotor and

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.520 
just ran it right through the rotor and
then<00:02:36.890> tie<00:02:37.730> it<00:02:37.790> into<00:02:38.090> the<00:02:38.269> wires<00:02:38.540> that<00:02:39.470> are

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
then tie it into the wires that are

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:45.230 
then tie it into the wires that are
coming<00:02:39.920> from<00:02:40.010> the<00:02:40.190> LEDs<00:02:40.640> on<00:02:40.880> the<00:02:41.030> wheel

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.240 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:50.490 

first<00:02:46.240> we'll<00:02:46.450> get<00:02:46.600> it<00:02:46.690> over<00:02:46.810> the<00:02:47.020> shop<00:02:49.440> get<00:02:50.440> a

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
first we'll get it over the shop get a

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.190 
first we'll get it over the shop get a
good<00:02:50.650> idea<00:02:50.950> where<00:02:51.130> it's<00:02:51.280> going<00:02:51.340> to<00:02:51.490> go<00:02:52.200> then

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
good idea where it's going to go then

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.690 
good idea where it's going to go then
just<00:02:53.500> take<00:02:53.890> this<00:02:54.100> to<00:02:54.280> the<00:02:54.400> side<00:02:54.670> pull<00:02:55.360> off

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
just take this to the side pull off

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.220 
just take this to the side pull off
coding<00:02:57.700> on<00:02:57.790> each<00:02:57.940> one<00:02:58.180> of<00:02:58.240> the<00:02:58.420> velcro<00:02:58.600> strips

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
coding on each one of the velcro strips

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:05.040 
coding on each one of the velcro strips
and<00:03:00.540> we're<00:03:01.540> going<00:03:01.660> to<00:03:01.720> place<00:03:01.960> it<00:03:03.600> so<00:03:04.600> now<00:03:04.780> we're

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:05.050 
and we're going to place it so now we're

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:07.950 
and we're going to place it so now we're
back<00:03:05.200> to<00:03:05.620> doing<00:03:06.180> the<00:03:07.180> same<00:03:07.390> thing<00:03:07.660> with<00:03:07.840> the

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:07.960 
back to doing the same thing with the

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:11.100 
back to doing the same thing with the
contacts<00:03:08.700> brushes<00:03:09.700> spring-loaded<00:03:10.630> presses

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110 
contacts brushes spring-loaded presses

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:14.730 
contacts brushes spring-loaded presses
on<00:03:11.260> the<00:03:11.350> back<00:03:11.680> as<00:03:11.890> we<00:03:12.010> did<00:03:12.190> on<00:03:12.310> the<00:03:12.340> front
