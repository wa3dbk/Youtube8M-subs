Hello, it's Klaudia

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:08.960
Today I will present several ways of decorating eggs Styrofoam in various techniques that I use most often

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:15.600
The first way is decorate eggs using sequins. We can get here really interesting compositions.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:24.300
We need only a few packages sequins, in different shapes. They are available in many colors and everyone can find something for themselves.

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.720
They are not expensive.

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:36.380
Best will be short pins with a length of 14 mm.

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:41.480
As you can see, these eggs can be used for interesting Easter decoration.

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:50.580
Another method is called. technique of "artichokes", ribbon. How do these eggs showed in a separate video.

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:55.500
Immediately you should see a link to it. It is also in the video description.

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:03.500
You can also combine the technique sequin and artichokes. Here also I pinned pins on the tips of the cones.

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:10.340
Next, a very simple and interesting way to egg painting various acrylic paints.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:19.240
This can be done using special sponge brushes, like this one, or just a simple cut sponge for dish.

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:26.720
Another interesting method is to wrap the egg using a thin ribbon. Additionally, you can decorate them for example by Sequins.

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:31.680
How do these eggs I showed in a separate video.

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:42.620
And the last way. This is decorating eggs by decoupage technique, using every kind of napkins.

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.360
This method also delivered in a separate video.

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.600
These are just some of the possible ways of decorating eggs Styrofoam.

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:58.640
I hope you liked the video and encourage
You to experiment with decorating eggs by your own idea.
