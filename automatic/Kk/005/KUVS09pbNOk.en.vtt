Thingiverse<00:00:09.230> don't<00:00:10.230> know<00:00:10.380> the<00:00:10.559> number<00:00:10.830> of<00:00:10.920> my

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
Thingiverse don't know the number of my

Thingiverse don't know the number of my
app<00:00:12.320> there's<00:00:13.320> a<00:00:13.410> decent<00:00:13.769> wind<00:00:16.400> spins<00:00:17.400> nicely

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
app there's a decent wind spins nicely

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:23.660 
app there's a decent wind spins nicely
I<00:00:18.439> made<00:00:19.439> the<00:00:20.340> master<00:00:20.580> stand<00:00:21.000> myself<00:00:21.920> and<00:00:22.920> this

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
I made the master stand myself and this

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.429 
I made the master stand myself and this
time<00:00:23.850> it<00:00:24.029> doesn't<00:00:24.210> topple<00:00:24.480> over<00:00:24.900> so<00:00:25.260> that<00:00:25.410> I

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
time it doesn't topple over so that I

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:32.209 
time it doesn't topple over so that I
call<00:00:26.070> that<00:00:26.220> a<00:00:26.250> success<00:00:27.680> so<00:00:30.769> the<00:00:31.769> generator

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
call that a success so the generator

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:39.200 
call that a success so the generator
assembly<00:00:35.719> so<00:00:36.719> we<00:00:36.840> have<00:00:37.020> a<00:00:37.050> NEMA<00:00:37.649> 17<00:00:37.680> motor<00:00:38.640> we

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
assembly so we have a NEMA 17 motor we

yeah that's professional with a tire rub

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.360 
yeah that's professional with a tire rub
we<00:00:49.800> have<00:00:49.950> a<00:00:50.030> 2<00:00:51.030> rectifiers<00:00:51.570> so<00:00:52.230> each<00:00:52.500> coil<00:00:53.070> of

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
we have a 2 rectifiers so each coil of

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.389 
we have a 2 rectifiers so each coil of

the stepper motor back to one rectifier
and<00:00:56.730> those<00:00:57.629> are<00:00:57.870> then<00:00:59.149> again<00:01:00.500> and<00:01:01.609> -<00:01:02.609> both

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
and those are then again and - both

and those are then again and - both
actually<00:01:03.600> half<00:01:03.840> you<00:01:04.080> can<00:01:04.199> see<00:01:04.260> here<00:01:04.710> for<00:01:07.100> AC

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
actually half you can see here for AC

Department<00:01:15.439> what<00:01:16.439> is<00:01:16.590> worth<00:01:17.509> here<00:01:18.509> you<00:01:18.689> can

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
Department what is worth here you can

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.010 
Department what is worth here you can
see<00:01:19.130> the<00:01:20.130> voltage<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:21.090> voltage<00:01:21.119> from<00:01:21.750> the

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
see the voltage the voltage from the

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.499 
see the voltage the voltage from the
stepper<00:01:22.350> motor<00:01:22.640> you<00:01:23.640> can<00:01:23.670> see<00:01:23.909> here<00:01:24.090> it's<00:01:24.270> nine

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
stepper motor you can see here it's nine

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.539 
stepper motor you can see here it's nine
point<00:01:24.810> two<00:01:24.900> seven<00:01:25.259> nine<00:01:25.470> point<00:01:25.950> eight<00:01:26.220> and

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
point two seven nine point eight and

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.190 
point two seven nine point eight and
it's<00:01:26.790> actually<00:01:27.119> producing<00:01:27.720> something

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
it's actually producing something

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.880 
it's actually producing something
because<00:01:28.829> it's<00:01:29.009> going<00:01:29.189> to<00:01:29.369> this<00:01:29.759> and<00:01:30.420> you<00:01:31.259> can't

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
because it's going to this and you can't

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.300 
because it's going to this and you can't
read<00:01:32.189> that<00:01:32.369> for<00:01:33.380> yeah<00:01:34.380> let<00:01:34.650> me<00:01:34.680> have<00:01:35.250> a

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
read that for yeah let me have a

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.960 
read that for yeah let me have a
look<00:01:35.549> so<00:01:35.790> three<00:01:36.090> seven<00:01:36.659> five<00:01:37.020> seven<00:01:37.380> and<00:01:37.970> point

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
look so three seven five seven and point

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:44.120 
look so three seven five seven and point
oh<00:01:39.150> seven<00:01:39.630> widow<00:01:40.110> one<00:01:40.500> amps<00:01:40.950> oh<00:01:42.799> there<00:01:43.799> we<00:01:43.920> go

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
oh seven widow one amps oh there we go

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:50.389 
oh seven widow one amps oh there we go
twin<00:01:44.460> 13<00:01:45.409> with<00:01:46.409> 14<00:01:47.060> with<00:01:48.060> 15<00:01:48.890> you<00:01:49.890> can<00:01:50.040> hear<00:01:50.280> the

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
twin 13 with 14 with 15 you can hear the

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.020 
twin 13 with 14 with 15 you can hear the
whine<00:01:50.610> from<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.270> turbine<00:01:51.829> 1.16<00:01:52.880> it<00:01:53.880> all

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
whine from the turbine 1.16 it all

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.020 
whine from the turbine 1.16 it all
depends<00:01:54.420> on<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:54.600> wind<00:01:54.750> of<00:01:54.960> course<00:01:55.790> and<00:01:56.790> then

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
depends on the wind of course and then

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.510 
depends on the wind of course and then
we<00:01:57.210> also<00:01:57.329> have<00:01:57.689> this<00:01:57.869> one<00:01:58.110> which<00:01:58.170> you<00:01:58.520> probably

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
we also have this one which you probably

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:05.990 
we also have this one which you probably
read<00:02:00.060> it's<00:02:00.439> not<00:02:01.439> be<00:02:01.619> on<00:02:01.740> camera<00:02:04.640> yeah<00:02:05.640> there<00:02:05.909> we

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
read it's not be on camera yeah there we

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.309 
read it's not be on camera yeah there we
go<00:02:06.030> we<00:02:06.299> can<00:02:06.329> see<00:02:06.630> a<00:02:06.659> little

00:02:08.309 --> 00:02:08.319 
go we can see a little

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:11.860 
go we can see a little
5750<00:02:09.319> rpm<00:02:09.920> so<00:02:10.610> we're<00:02:10.759> actually<00:02:10.940> getting<00:02:11.269> some

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
5750 rpm so we're actually getting some

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.990 
5750 rpm so we're actually getting some
from<00:02:12.739> a<00:02:12.769> 50<00:02:13.159> rpm<00:02:14.980> which<00:02:15.980> is<00:02:16.010> reasonable<00:02:16.760> but<00:02:16.909> if

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
from a 50 rpm which is reasonable but if

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.039 
from a 50 rpm which is reasonable but if
someone<00:02:17.450> from<00:02:17.480> 100<00:02:18.470> to<00:02:18.620> over<00:02:19.069> 150<00:02:19.940> is<00:02:20.599> where<00:02:20.870> it

00:02:21.039 --> 00:02:21.049 
someone from 100 to over 150 is where it

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:23.589 
someone from 100 to over 150 is where it
really<00:02:21.140> starts<00:02:21.650> to<00:02:21.709> do<00:02:21.920> something<00:02:22.599> this

00:02:23.589 --> 00:02:23.599 
really starts to do something this

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:25.539 
really starts to do something this
stepper<00:02:23.900> motor<00:02:24.200> probably<00:02:24.709> isn't<00:02:25.220> the<00:02:25.250> right

00:02:25.539 --> 00:02:25.549 
stepper motor probably isn't the right

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:27.880 
stepper motor probably isn't the right
choice<00:02:25.819> I<00:02:26.150> might<00:02:26.810> need<00:02:27.260> something<00:02:27.560> like<00:02:27.860> a

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
choice I might need something like a

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.899 
choice I might need something like a
NEMA<00:02:28.549> 23<00:02:29.450> instead<00:02:29.810> of<00:02:29.930> a<00:02:29.989> NEMA<00:02:30.170> 17<00:02:30.730> do<00:02:31.730> note

00:02:31.899 --> 00:02:31.909 
NEMA 23 instead of a NEMA 17 do note

00:02:31.909 --> 00:02:34.420 
NEMA 23 instead of a NEMA 17 do note
these<00:02:32.209> diplomas<00:02:32.629> are<00:02:32.959> rated<00:02:33.620> for<00:02:33.739> koala<00:02:34.159> fault

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
these diplomas are rated for koala fault

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.500 
these diplomas are rated for koala fault
operation<00:02:35.030> which<00:02:35.720> means<00:02:35.989> you<00:02:36.200> get<00:02:36.379> a<00:02:37.510> decent

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
operation which means you get a decent

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.759 
operation which means you get a decent
voltage<00:02:39.700> from<00:02:40.700> very<00:02:41.269> little<00:02:41.450> rpm<00:02:42.049> there

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:42.769 
voltage from very little rpm there

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:44.050 
voltage from very little rpm there
that's<00:02:43.190> one<00:02:43.370> of<00:02:43.489> the<00:02:43.579> reasons<00:02:43.910> I<00:02:44.030> chose

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
that's one of the reasons I chose

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:45.670 
that's one of the reasons I chose
stepper<00:02:44.569> motors<00:02:44.959> because<00:02:45.230> the<00:02:45.349> produce

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
stepper motors because the produce

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.470 
stepper motors because the produce
reasonable<00:02:47.079> for<00:02:48.079> purchase<00:02:48.349> for<00:02:48.859> system<00:02:49.480> were

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
reasonable for purchase for system were

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.949 
reasonable for purchase for system were
just<00:02:50.720> a<00:02:51.160> little<00:02:52.160> bit<00:02:52.280> on<00:02:52.459> rpm<00:02:52.940> and<00:02:53.209> because<00:02:53.810> I

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:53.959 
just a little bit on rpm and because I

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:58.180 
just a little bit on rpm and because I
use<00:02:54.170> a<00:02:54.200> DC<00:02:55.159> DC<00:02:55.670> buck<00:02:56.150> converter<00:02:56.690> I'm<00:02:57.650> actually

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
use a DC DC buck converter I'm actually

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:04.229 
use a DC DC buck converter I'm actually
decoupling<00:02:59.349> the<00:03:00.349> power<00:03:00.859> from<00:03:01.159> this<00:03:01.340> 2s<00:03:02.150> lipo

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:04.239 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:07.210 

so<00:03:05.239> the<00:03:05.299> input<00:03:05.629> voltage<00:03:06.049> and<00:03:06.349> the<00:03:06.440> output

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
so the input voltage and the output

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.319 
so the input voltage and the output
voltage<00:03:08.170> are<00:03:09.170> then<00:03:09.349> regulated<00:03:10.040> this<00:03:10.609> DC<00:03:11.120> DC

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:11.329 
voltage are then regulated this DC DC

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:15.400 
voltage are then regulated this DC DC
converter<00:03:11.840> this<00:03:13.209> actually<00:03:14.209> has<00:03:14.419> a<00:03:14.810> constant

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
converter this actually has a constant

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:17.710 
converter this actually has a constant
current<00:03:15.590> mode<00:03:15.829> as<00:03:16.099> well<00:03:16.450> which<00:03:17.450> I<00:03:17.569> haven't

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
current mode as well which I haven't

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.449 
current mode as well which I haven't
triggered<00:03:18.079> yet<00:03:18.200> and<00:03:18.470> I<00:03:18.620> don't<00:03:18.650> actually<00:03:19.069> have

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:19.459 
triggered yet and I don't actually have

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:21.670 
triggered yet and I don't actually have
the<00:03:19.760> screwdriver<00:03:20.209> with<00:03:20.419> me<00:03:20.569> to<00:03:20.690> adjust<00:03:20.780> it<00:03:21.109> but

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 
the screwdriver with me to adjust it but

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.319 
the screwdriver with me to adjust it but
it<00:03:21.799> doesn't<00:03:22.099> matter<00:03:22.250> anyhow<00:03:22.700> because<00:03:23.060> the

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:23.329 
it doesn't matter anyhow because the

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:26.740 
it doesn't matter anyhow because the
current<00:03:23.660> isn't<00:03:23.959> high<00:03:24.260> enough<00:03:25.450> but<00:03:26.450> it's<00:03:26.569> nice

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
current isn't high enough but it's nice

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.629 
current isn't high enough but it's nice
to<00:03:26.930> see<00:03:27.079> that<00:03:27.319> the<00:03:27.440> input<00:03:27.709> voltage<00:03:28.099> output

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:28.639 
to see that the input voltage output

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:32.500 
to see that the input voltage output
voltage<00:03:29.410> are<00:03:30.410> not<00:03:30.590> directly<00:03:31.250> coupled<00:03:31.489> and<00:03:31.910> of

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
voltage are not directly coupled and of

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:34.990 
voltage are not directly coupled and of
course<00:03:32.750> the<00:03:32.959> input<00:03:33.349> voltage<00:03:33.680> will<00:03:33.889> not<00:03:33.919> go<00:03:34.790> up

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:35.000 
course the input voltage will not go up

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.789 
course the input voltage will not go up
as<00:03:35.209> high<00:03:35.450> because<00:03:35.900> it's<00:03:36.200> actually<00:03:36.410> a<00:03:36.620> couple

00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:36.799 
as high because it's actually a couple

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:38.800 
as high because it's actually a couple
to<00:03:36.949> the<00:03:37.040> battery<00:03:37.310> now<00:03:37.489> if<00:03:38.090> I<00:03:38.239> decoupled<00:03:38.780> the

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
to the battery now if I decoupled the

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:41.770 
to the battery now if I decoupled the
battery<00:03:39.139> you'll<00:03:39.410> actually<00:03:39.680> see<00:03:40.040> it<00:03:40.069> go<00:03:40.340> up<00:03:40.780> or

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
battery you'll actually see it go up or

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:46.750 
battery you'll actually see it go up or
something<00:03:42.169> like<00:03:42.699> 30-plus<00:03:43.699> Falls<00:03:44.120> and<00:03:45.609> yes<00:03:46.609> you

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:46.760 
something like 30-plus Falls and yes you

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.909 
something like 30-plus Falls and yes you
can<00:03:46.910> see<00:03:47.150> now<00:03:47.329> see<00:03:47.900> the<00:03:47.989> little<00:03:48.199> blue<00:03:48.349> LED<00:03:48.590> it's

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:48.919 
can see now see the little blue LED it's

00:03:48.919 --> 00:03:51.009 
can see now see the little blue LED it's
actually<00:03:49.280> current<00:03:49.639> limiting<00:03:50.060> I<00:03:50.239> should

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:51.019 
actually current limiting I should

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:53.500 
actually current limiting I should
probably<00:03:51.169> adjust<00:03:51.739> that<00:03:51.970> so<00:03:52.970> that's<00:03:53.150> the<00:03:53.329> next

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:53.510 
probably adjust that so that's the next

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:56.590 
probably adjust that so that's the next
test<00:03:53.780> there<00:03:54.349> we<00:03:54.440> go
