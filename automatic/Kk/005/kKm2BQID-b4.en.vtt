so<00:02:42.440> self-explanatory<00:02:43.440> I'm<00:02:43.860> sure<00:02:44.090> she<00:02:45.090> popped

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
so self-explanatory I'm sure she popped

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.270 
so self-explanatory I'm sure she popped
that<00:02:45.480> on<00:02:45.930> so<00:02:46.200> that's<00:02:46.350> a<00:02:46.500> nice<00:02:47.040> little

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
that on so that's a nice little

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.850 
that on so that's a nice little
improvement<00:02:48.140> outside<00:02:49.140> of<00:02:49.290> that<00:02:49.410> nothing

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860

major so we're excited about the

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.590 
major so we're excited about the
controller<00:02:52.200> um<00:02:52.790> inside<00:02:53.790> is<00:02:54.180> where<00:02:54.390> there's

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
controller um inside is where there's

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.070 
controller um inside is where there's
some<00:02:54.750> major<00:02:55.160> improvements<00:02:56.160> as<00:02:56.280> well<00:02:57.080> look

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
some major improvements as well look

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.380 
some major improvements as well look
online<00:02:58.230> of<00:02:58.500> course<00:02:58.709> the<00:02:58.950> new<00:02:59.130> can<00:02:59.489> the<00:03:00.269> new

online of course the new can the new
controller<00:03:00.780> is<00:03:00.900> going<00:03:01.019> to<00:03:01.110> be<00:03:01.200> the<00:03:01.380> Naza<00:03:02.030> in

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
controller is going to be the Naza in

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.470 
controller is going to be the Naza in
version<00:03:03.870> two<00:03:04.080> instead<00:03:04.799> of<00:03:04.860> the<00:03:04.950> version<00:03:05.220> one

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
version two instead of the version one

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.610 
version two instead of the version one
but<00:03:06.480> the<00:03:06.840> million-dollar<00:03:07.380> question<00:03:07.500> is<00:03:08.190> is<00:03:09.120> it

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
but the million-dollar question is is it

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:12.470 
but the million-dollar question is is it
plug<00:03:10.620> and<00:03:10.799> play<00:03:10.920> ready<00:03:10.950> for<00:03:11.459> the<00:03:11.610> zenmuse<00:03:11.970> h3

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
plug and play ready for the zenmuse h3

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.809 
plug and play ready for the zenmuse h3
2d<00:03:12.870> now<00:03:13.590> according<00:03:13.860> to<00:03:14.040> some<00:03:14.280> people<00:03:14.489> I<00:03:14.549> talked

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:14.819 
2d now according to some people I talked

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:16.610 
2d now according to some people I talked
to<00:03:14.940> it's<00:03:15.360> probably<00:03:15.930> not<00:03:16.080> and<00:03:16.319> you<00:03:16.500> should

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
to it's probably not and you should

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.009 
to it's probably not and you should
still<00:03:16.799> have<00:03:16.829> to<00:03:17.070> buy<00:03:17.190> the<00:03:17.250> stupid<00:03:17.549> P<00:03:17.910> mu<00:03:18.030> or<00:03:18.780> an

you know international plugs but outside
of<00:03:36.090> that<00:03:36.209> yeah<00:03:36.480> the<00:03:36.780> controller<00:03:37.319> is<00:03:37.650> the<00:03:37.680> for

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:38.579 
of that yeah the controller is the for

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:41.960 
of that yeah the controller is the for
me<00:03:38.730> anyway<00:03:39.030> are<00:03:39.239> the<00:03:39.440> transmitter<00:03:40.760> it's<00:03:41.760> been

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
me anyway are the transmitter it's been

me anyway are the transmitter it's been
a<00:03:42.000> major<00:03:42.359> upgrade<00:03:42.600> in<00:03:43.079> that<00:03:43.260> sense<00:03:43.530> but<00:03:44.569> you

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:45.569 
a major upgrade in that sense but you

a major upgrade in that sense but you
gotta<00:03:45.780> see<00:03:45.959> what<00:03:45.989> happens<00:03:46.350> on<00:03:46.440> the<00:03:46.560> inside<00:03:46.680> so

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
gotta see what happens on the inside so

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.660 
gotta see what happens on the inside so
once<00:03:48.120> again<00:03:48.239> this<00:03:48.660> is<00:03:48.720> it<00:03:49.049> the<00:03:49.319> DJI<00:03:49.889> phantom

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
once again this is it the DJI phantom

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:54.319 
once again this is it the DJI phantom
one<00:03:50.880> one<00:03:51.090> one<00:03:51.299> and<00:03:52.160> we'll<00:03:53.160> start<00:03:53.700> part<00:03:53.940> two<00:03:54.090> and

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:54.329 
one one one and we'll start part two and

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:56.030 
one one one and we'll start part two and
tell<00:03:54.870> you<00:03:54.959> all<00:03:55.079> about<00:03:55.200> the<00:03:55.410> internals<00:03:55.829> and<00:03:55.889> see

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
tell you all about the internals and see

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.430 
tell you all about the internals and see
what<00:03:56.160> it<00:03:56.250> looks<00:03:56.370> like
