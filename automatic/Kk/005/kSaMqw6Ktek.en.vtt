but I'm saying that it's you know I you

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:19.969 
but I'm saying that it's you know I you
know<00:01:18.450> when<00:01:18.750> something<00:01:19.020> else<00:01:19.170> some<00:01:19.320> people<00:01:19.560> get

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
and that's that's you know and it could

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.710 
and that's that's you know and it could
be<00:01:35.070> 20<00:01:35.400> years<00:01:35.520> and<00:01:35.729> be<00:01:35.820> ten<00:01:36.060> years<00:01:36.270> be<00:01:36.450> 10
