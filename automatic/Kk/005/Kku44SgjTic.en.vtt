right there so let's just take a walk
around<00:00:13.549> this<00:00:14.549> 450s<00:00:15.540> replica<00:00:16.109> that's<00:00:16.320> in

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
around this 450s replica that's in

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.800 
around this 450s replica that's in
production<00:00:17.430> you<00:00:18.029> can<00:00:18.180> see<00:00:18.300> the<00:00:18.420> front<00:00:18.660> a<00:00:18.779> arms

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
production you can see the front a arms

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.529 
production you can see the front a arms
here<00:00:19.320> look<00:00:19.590> very<00:00:19.890> similar<00:00:20.310> to<00:00:20.400> a<00:00:20.550> 80-82

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
here look very similar to a 80-82

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.019 
here look very similar to a 80-82
Quattroporte<00:00:22.380> which<00:00:23.220> i<00:00:23.400> suspect<00:00:23.609> they<00:00:24.000> are

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
Quattroporte which i suspect they are

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.589 
Quattroporte which i suspect they are
and<00:00:24.960> they've<00:00:25.650> put<00:00:26.609> together<00:00:26.730> a<00:00:26.970> nice<00:00:27.210> frame

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
and they've put together a nice frame

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:33.490 
and they've put together a nice frame
here<00:00:30.560> out<00:00:31.560> of<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:31.980> tube<00:00:32.369> that<00:00:32.640> looks<00:00:32.820> very

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:33.500
