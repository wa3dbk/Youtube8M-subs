00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:02.550 
I don't think the top is that important

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:05.780 
I don't think the top is that important
because<00:02:02.670> that's<00:02:02.910> kind<00:02:03.150> of<00:02:03.270> where<00:02:03.480> I<00:02:04.040> cut<00:02:05.040> my

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.389 
because that's kind of where I cut my
hair<00:02:06.000> and<00:02:06.320> as<00:02:07.320> you<00:02:07.440> can<00:02:07.590> see<00:02:07.620> I<00:02:07.830> didn't<00:02:08.280> really

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
hair and as you can see I didn't really

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.609 
hair and as you can see I didn't really
cut<00:02:08.670> it<00:02:08.790> that<00:02:08.970> short<00:02:09.030> it's<00:02:09.840> kind<00:02:09.990> of<00:02:10.110> layered

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619
