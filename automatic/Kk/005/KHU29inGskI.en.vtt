dewy finish not matte whatsoever I

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.580 
dewy finish not matte whatsoever I
noticed<00:02:34.500> that<00:02:34.680> if<00:02:34.829> you<00:02:34.859> build<00:02:36.560> you<00:02:37.560> can

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
noticed that if you build you can

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.789 
noticed that if you build you can
definitely<00:02:37.920> build<00:02:38.459> up<00:02:38.700> a<00:02:38.849> coverage<00:02:39.590> for<00:02:40.590> more

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:40.799 
definitely build up a coverage for more

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:43.699 
definitely build up a coverage for more
heavier<00:02:41.250> coverage<00:02:41.730> I<00:02:42.439> noticed<00:02:43.439> that<00:02:43.590> if<00:02:43.680> you

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
heavier coverage I noticed that if you

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:46.789 
heavier coverage I noticed that if you
don't<00:02:44.040> blend<00:02:44.519> just<00:02:45.420> BB<00:02:45.750> cream<00:02:46.019> into<00:02:46.200> your<00:02:46.409> skin

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:46.799 
don't blend just BB cream into your skin

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:49.099 
don't blend just BB cream into your skin
really<00:02:46.950> well<00:02:47.069> I<00:02:47.519> can<00:02:47.909> leave<00:02:48.120> your<00:02:48.299> skin<00:02:48.629> very

really well I can leave your skin very

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:50.869 
really well I can leave your skin very
streaky<00:02:49.650> so<00:02:49.829> it's<00:02:49.950> very<00:02:50.189> important<00:02:50.639> to<00:02:50.760> make

00:02:50.869 --> 00:02:50.879 
streaky so it's very important to make

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:53.920 
streaky so it's very important to make
sure<00:02:50.909> you<00:02:51.180> blend<00:02:51.450> this<00:02:51.719> BB<00:02:52.620> cream<00:02:52.859> in<00:02:53.099> with<00:02:53.400> a

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
sure you blend this BB cream in with a

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.899 
sure you blend this BB cream in with a
brush<00:02:54.930> so<00:02:55.920> people<00:02:56.219> prefer<00:02:56.519> to<00:02:56.549> use<00:02:56.730> their

00:02:56.899 --> 00:02:56.909 
brush so people prefer to use their

00:02:56.909 --> 00:02:59.690 
brush so people prefer to use their
hands<00:02:57.420> I<00:02:57.510> just<00:02:57.840> prefer<00:02:58.109> using<00:02:58.530> a<00:02:58.620> brush<00:02:58.829> only

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.929 
hands I just prefer using a brush only

because I just always apply brush using
any<00:03:03.060> type<00:03:03.329> of<00:03:03.409> liquid<00:03:04.409> makeup<00:03:04.769> always<00:03:05.099> skin<00:03:05.549> so

Loreal<00:04:10.480> BB<00:04:10.810> cream<00:04:11.050> it's<00:04:11.560> actually<00:04:11.830> quite

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:11.950 
Loreal BB cream it's actually quite

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:13.500 
Loreal BB cream it's actually quite
funny<00:04:12.160> because<00:04:12.280> earlier<00:04:12.700> when<00:04:12.850> I<00:04:12.880> had<00:04:13.150> put<00:04:13.360> on

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:13.510 
funny because earlier when I had put on

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:15.480 
funny because earlier when I had put on
this<00:04:13.720> BB<00:04:13.960> cream<00:04:14.290> I<00:04:14.470> was<00:04:14.980> complaining<00:04:15.430> about

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:15.490 
this BB cream I was complaining about

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:19.440 
this BB cream I was complaining about
how<00:04:15.790> watery<00:04:16.269> it<00:04:16.480> was<00:04:16.739> in<00:04:17.739> actuality<00:04:18.220> this<00:04:19.120> BB

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:19.450 
how watery it was in actuality this BB

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:22.650 
how watery it was in actuality this BB
cream<00:04:19.570> is<00:04:19.780> not<00:04:20.109> watery<00:04:20.739> whatsoever<00:04:21.660> it's

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:22.660 
cream is not watery whatsoever it's

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:25.260 
cream is not watery whatsoever it's
actually<00:04:22.990> not<00:04:23.140> liquidy<00:04:23.620> whatsoever<00:04:24.280> it's<00:04:25.120> a

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:25.270 
actually not liquidy whatsoever it's a

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:30.110 
actually not liquidy whatsoever it's a
very<00:04:27.030> thick<00:04:28.410> consistency

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120 
very thick consistency

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.570 
very thick consistency
so<00:04:31.120> actually<00:04:31.720> I<00:04:31.810> put<00:04:31.990> a<00:04:32.050> lot<00:04:32.350> I<00:04:32.950> think<00:04:33.430> the

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:33.580 
so actually I put a lot I think the

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:35.130 
so actually I put a lot I think the
reason<00:04:33.820> why<00:04:33.910> I<00:04:33.940> was<00:04:34.120> really<00:04:34.450> watery<00:04:34.780> earlier

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:35.140 
reason why I was really watery earlier

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:36.420 
reason why I was really watery earlier
is<00:04:35.260> because<00:04:35.530> because<00:04:35.770> my<00:04:35.890> room<00:04:36.100> was<00:04:36.220> pretty

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:36.430 
is because because my room was pretty

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:39.240 
is because because my room was pretty
hot<00:04:36.790> and<00:04:37.380> I<00:04:38.380> think<00:04:38.500> this<00:04:38.740> product<00:04:39.070> is<00:04:39.160> really

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:39.250 
hot and I think this product is really

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:41.850 
hot and I think this product is really
sensitive<00:04:39.669> to<00:04:39.910> heat<00:04:40.210> it<00:04:40.870> tends<00:04:41.140> to<00:04:41.380> melt<00:04:41.620> very

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:41.860 
sensitive to heat it tends to melt very

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:44.220 
sensitive to heat it tends to melt very
easily<00:04:42.160> so<00:04:42.610> I<00:04:42.850> mean<00:04:43.300> that's<00:04:43.419> one<00:04:43.720> thing<00:04:44.050> I

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:44.230 
easily so I mean that's one thing I

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:45.720 
easily so I mean that's one thing I
discovered<00:04:44.680> because<00:04:45.160> you<00:04:45.280> know<00:04:45.370> that<00:04:45.520> it's<00:04:45.669> a

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:45.730 
discovered because you know that it's a

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:47.400 
discovered because you know that it's a
little<00:04:45.880> bit<00:04:46.090> cooler<00:04:46.540> it's<00:04:47.020> gotten<00:04:47.260> a<00:04:47.320> lot

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:47.410 
little bit cooler it's gotten a lot

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:49.440 
little bit cooler it's gotten a lot
harder<00:04:47.770> in<00:04:48.010> it<00:04:48.160> I<00:04:48.400> believe<00:04:48.730> it's<00:04:49.270> true

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:49.450 
harder in it I believe it's true

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:51.300 
harder in it I believe it's true

think it was like in the mid 80s high

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:15.180 
think it was like in the mid 80s high
80s<00:05:13.000> so<00:05:13.720> it<00:05:14.020> was<00:05:14.140> pretty<00:05:14.290> hot<00:05:14.590> but<00:05:14.740> I<00:05:14.830> wasn't

cameras really surprised because 30

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:20.520

minutes<00:05:19.300> after<00:05:19.419> I<00:05:19.600> applied<00:05:19.870> to<00:05:20.020> BB<00:05:20.260> cream<00:05:20.440> I

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:20.530 
minutes after I applied to BB cream I

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:22.080 
minutes after I applied to BB cream I
noticed<00:05:20.830> my<00:05:20.979> face<00:05:21.160> started<00:05:21.460> to<00:05:21.640> you<00:05:21.760> look<00:05:22.000> a

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:22.090 
noticed my face started to you look a

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:23.880 
noticed my face started to you look a
little<00:05:22.180> shiny<00:05:22.510> and<00:05:22.930> looked<00:05:23.440> a<00:05:23.530> little<00:05:23.710> oily

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:23.890 
little shiny and looked a little oily

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:25.770 
little shiny and looked a little oily
but<00:05:24.400> as<00:05:24.550> the<00:05:24.669> day<00:05:24.790> progressed<00:05:25.210> my<00:05:25.540> face

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:25.780 
but as the day progressed my face

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:27.990 
but as the day progressed my face
actually<00:05:26.200> didn't<00:05:26.560> look<00:05:26.680> as<00:05:26.890> oily<00:05:27.370> as<00:05:27.400> it<00:05:27.790> did

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:28.000 
actually didn't look as oily as it did

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:28.740 
actually didn't look as oily as it did
earlier

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:28.750 
earlier

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:31.080 
earlier
I<00:05:28.780> think<00:05:29.470> this<00:05:29.590> BB<00:05:29.860> cream<00:05:30.010> actually<00:05:30.430> works

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:31.090 
I think this BB cream actually works

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:33.780 
I think this BB cream actually works
better<00:05:31.360> over<00:05:31.780> time<00:05:32.080> and<00:05:32.590> I<00:05:33.040> think<00:05:33.100> it<00:05:33.400> needed

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:33.790 
better over time and I think it needed

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:36.150 
better over time and I think it needed
some<00:05:34.090> time<00:05:34.390> to<00:05:34.419> really<00:05:35.080> sink<00:05:35.350> into<00:05:35.470> my<00:05:35.770> skin

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:36.160 
some time to really sink into my skin

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:37.440 
some time to really sink into my skin
for<00:05:36.340> it<00:05:36.400> to<00:05:36.580> work<00:05:36.729> effectively

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:37.450 
for it to work effectively

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:39.659 
for it to work effectively
but<00:05:37.900> this<00:05:38.050> BB<00:05:38.290> cream<00:05:38.440> actually<00:05:39.040> surprised<00:05:39.490> me

00:05:39.659 --> 00:05:39.669
