 I'll tell you about how I'm leaving for my 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.629

 stay with me 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:22.839
 I'll start with the fact that I'm one of those people who 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:25.029
 not permanently care for 

00:00:22.839 --> 00:00:27.099
 with my own hands I somehow start after them 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:29.710
 take care when the problem is straightforward 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:32.230

 hand baths and for these purposes I 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:46.719
 I use this tool here 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:49.809
 bombs for baths for these hands 

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:50.469
 bombs in my opinion called lemon

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:54.910

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:59.800
 dissolve and lower into this solution 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:02.350
 hold your pens for 5-10 minutes 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:05.110
 then a little massage the composition of these 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:07.390
 bombs includes lemon oil also 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.340
 soda and sea salt and a couple more essential 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.330
 oils 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.540

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.990
 nails are the following remedies which i 

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:18.820
 I use that I do not like a little 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.939
 more this is such an almond 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.890
 oil is almond oil from the company 

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:27.400
 oriflame 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.960
 hand oil and massage oil has 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.240
 such a transparent color 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.659
 consistency in principle like some water 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.829
 very pleasant smell really 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.630
 mental smell it is bright 

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:39.790
 pronounced today we will be with you 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.860
 use here this oil and so let's 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:44.259
 let's get started here I brought a little bit 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:46.630
 I have some water and by the way I don't like to do 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:48.610
 baths in very small containers i 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.740
 I love exactly so that my palm would sink 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:53.460
 the first thing we take is this 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.460
 maslichko 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:03.040
 this amount of oil we will 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:06.250
 enough and just lower your palms in 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:12.780
 I like to keep water about 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:12.780
 Well, 3 minutes later I was doing massage 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:19.690
 just such circular movements in 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.850
 gray oil in hands well 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.230
 working on my nails after i 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.100
 I will make hand baths 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.310
 scrub 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:29.170
 Now I have such a scrub 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:31.030
 This scrub is powered by the same oriflame 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.400
 the very same series as the oil bottle too 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.650
 almond oil besides being here 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.540
 contains almond oil can still 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:40.150
 notice even in principle on the packaging 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:42.430
 it is evident that there are such almond crumbs 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:45.100
 who scrubs very well though their 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:47.110
 and not very much scrub here 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:49.000
 in this way besides being 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:51.070
 very well scrubs it just yet 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.050
 super moisturizes it moisturizes much 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:55.060
 more than many hand creams like that 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:58.000
 until today it's scratch we will be with 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:00.810
 you use the principle of this 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.980
 the amount of scrub is enough 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.980
 to copy two pens 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:19.320
 further crumbs washing off the scrub and in principle 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:21.600
 moisturizing is already very much felt 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:23.580
 skin has become much softer much 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.470
 more pleasant to the touch after i 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:28.530
 I scrub my hands well 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:30.480
 I use either cream or butter in this 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:33.090
 The moment I have here is such a cream from 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:35.310
 oriflame companies from the same series 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:37.320
 that and oil and scrub to be honest 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.870
 I bought a large package specially 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:41.730
 thought that this cream is as good as 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:44.790
 oil and scrub but unfortunately it is them 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:46.950
 loses much after well 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:49.530
 moisturizing oil and excellent 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:52.260
 moisturizing scrub would like such 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.940
 son moist cream but does not give 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.830
 sufficient moisture 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.900
 leave behind a very fat 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:59.910
 thick film that feels even 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.830
 the next day in before you wash your hands like me 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:03.870
 already said i do you use cream either 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:04.740
 I have the oil right now 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:07.710
 here is oil 

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:10.890
 this oil from the company of soap makers solid 

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:12.750
 Sea buckthorn jam for me 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:13.890
 I like the smell of this oil but 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:17.760
 really smells 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:20.460
 sea ​​buckthorn mixed with such very 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:22.590
 sweet chills my closet looks like a hassle 

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:24.240
 it will be like this 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:27.710
 quite a bit to 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.710
 thoroughly moisten hands 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:05:00.460
 Further I will tell you a little about the funds with 

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:03.400
 the help that i care for my 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:05.740
 nails and the first and probably my very 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:07.199
 favorite tool for this purpose is this 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:09.729
 so here 

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:12.250
 lemon oil and freshness from 

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:15.160
 soap company and I really like 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:18.340
 rich lemon scent 

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:20.919
 I like the oil how little it is 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:22.240
 need to say moisten 

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:25.289
 make your nails so small 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:28.060
 massage you see it this way 

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:29.440
 his little need here about a completely 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:31.990
 really a bit 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:34.240
 and apply massage movements such 

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:37.150
 circular on the nails also i use it 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:39.400
 to soften the cuticle before manicure 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:41.710
 then I will tell a little wire this here 

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:45.490
 a couple of these both funds from the company 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:47.919
 oriflame is a means to accelerate 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:48.520
 nail growth and plus to strengthen 

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:52.539
 nails 

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:53.349
 this tool is called diamond 

00:05:52.539 --> 00:05:56.680
 hardness 

00:05:53.349 --> 00:05:59.620
 to strengthen nails 

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:02.740
 I usually put two layers in 

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:05.590
 principle like a clear varnish is very 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:06.759
 convenient brush such our guys as 

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:10.150
 lacquer base 

00:06:06.759 --> 00:06:11.949
 just super strengthens his nails if he 

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:14.050
 our two words don't seem valid 

00:06:11.949 --> 00:06:16.060
 it is generally impossible to break in any way 

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:18.520
 Here is this means Of course she more 

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:21.789
 directed to the treatment of nails and plus on 

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:24.009
 acceleration of nail growth in my remains 

00:06:21.789 --> 00:06:26.680
 just a little bit and so I suspect that 

00:06:24.009 --> 00:06:29.050
 it's time to dispose of it but if you 

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:30.759
 problems are like prevention 

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:34.120
 use just used also 

00:06:30.759 --> 00:06:36.389
 very easy to brush on 

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:39.039
 ground nails this means and 

00:06:36.389 --> 00:06:41.680
 distribute understood also to circular 

00:06:39.039 --> 00:06:43.840
 movement as if doing a massage on it 

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:45.969
 Basically , I told you everything 

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:48.039
