00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.420 
the vibe was great the teams were great
um<00:01:48.950> apparently<00:01:49.950> team<00:01:50.460> eats<00:01:50.970> lost<00:01:51.570> a<00:01:51.780> lot

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:52.430 
um apparently team eats lost a lot

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:55.820 
um apparently team eats lost a lot
compared<00:01:53.430> to<00:01:53.550> team<00:01:53.700> sleeping<00:01:54.380> but<00:01:55.380> I<00:01:55.560> think

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:55.830 
compared to team sleeping but I think

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:57.800 
compared to team sleeping but I think
there<00:01:56.040> were<00:01:56.220> a<00:01:56.250> lot<00:01:56.580> of<00:01:56.610> more<00:01:57.240> good<00:01:57.630> people
