00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:37.580 
rectifier I've left out of the system

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:39.640 
rectifier I've left out of the system
simply<00:00:38.030> because<00:00:38.390> there's<00:00:38.989> not<00:00:39.140> a<00:00:39.200> good<00:00:39.440> known

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:39.650 
simply because there's not a good known

battery or replacement with a known good

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:46.420 
battery or replacement with a known good
unit<00:00:44.900> so<00:00:45.199> we<00:00:45.500> are<00:00:45.800> going<00:00:45.949> to<00:00:46.070> assume<00:00:46.370> that

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:46.430 
unit so we are going to assume that

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:48.009 
unit so we are going to assume that
that's<00:00:46.730> good<00:00:46.970> or<00:00:47.210> we're<00:00:47.360> assuming<00:00:47.629> that<00:00:47.809> that

00:00:48.009 --> 00:00:48.019 
that's good or we're assuming that that

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:50.770 
that's good or we're assuming that that
has<00:00:48.170> been<00:00:48.350> replaced<00:00:48.620> in<00:00:49.070> this<00:00:49.580> case<00:00:49.850> we<00:00:50.659> know

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:50.780 
has been replaced in this case we know

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.210 
has been replaced in this case we know
we<00:00:50.900> have<00:00:51.050> a<00:00:51.080> good<00:00:51.260> working<00:00:51.500> rectifier<00:00:52.100> and

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:52.220 
we have a good working rectifier and

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:53.770 
we have a good working rectifier and
regulator<00:00:52.670> now<00:00:53.269> we're<00:00:53.449> down<00:00:53.570> to<00:00:53.629> the

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:53.780 
regulator now we're down to the

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.430 
regulator now we're down to the
components<00:00:54.290> here<00:00:54.589> first<00:00:55.400> component<00:00:56.199> is<00:00:57.199> the

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:57.440 
components here first component is the

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.350 
components here first component is the

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:00.940 
contact the slip rings on the rotor

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.460 
contact the slip rings on the rotor
these<00:01:01.940> need<00:01:02.180> to<00:01:02.269> be<00:01:02.390> inspected<00:01:02.750> to<00:01:03.110> make<00:01:03.140> sure

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:03.470 
these need to be inspected to make sure

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:05.890 
these need to be inspected to make sure
that<00:01:03.769> they<00:01:04.400> have<00:01:04.580> a<00:01:04.610> scribed<00:01:05.000> line<00:01:05.120> which<00:01:05.570> may

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:05.900 
that they have a scribed line which may

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.539 
that they have a scribed line which may
or<00:01:06.020> may<00:01:06.140> not<00:01:06.170> be<00:01:06.500> able<00:01:06.650> to<00:01:06.830> be<00:01:07.040> seen<00:01:07.280> in<00:01:07.460> this

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:07.549 
or may not be able to be seen in this

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:10.120 
or may not be able to be seen in this
video<00:01:07.840> as<00:01:08.840> long<00:01:09.080> as<00:01:09.229> that<00:01:09.350> scribed<00:01:09.710> line<00:01:09.950> is

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 
video as long as that scribed line is

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:11.680 
video as long as that scribed line is
above<00:01:10.370> the<00:01:10.520> holder<00:01:10.940> we<00:01:11.210> know<00:01:11.360> that<00:01:11.540> these

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:11.690 
above the holder we know that these

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:14.080 
above the holder we know that these
brushes<00:01:11.960> are<00:01:12.260> good<00:01:12.470> we<00:01:13.130> can<00:01:13.280> also<00:01:13.430> test<00:01:13.880> them

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.090 
brushes are good we can also test them

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:15.640 
brushes are good we can also test them
by<00:01:14.210> checking<00:01:14.450> the<00:01:14.720> continuity<00:01:15.320> through<00:01:15.500> them

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:15.650 
by checking the continuity through them

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:17.020 
by checking the continuity through them
as<00:01:15.770> well<00:01:15.920> which<00:01:16.159> I<00:01:16.310> will<00:01:16.460> show<00:01:16.580> you<00:01:16.640> how<00:01:16.790> to<00:01:16.850> do

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.030 
as well which I will show you how to do

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.779 
as well which I will show you how to do
in<00:01:17.150> the<00:01:17.240> next<00:01:17.390> video<00:01:17.750> so<00:01:18.649> those<00:01:19.280> are<00:01:19.460> first

00:01:19.779 --> 00:01:19.789 
in the next video so those are first

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:21.459 
in the next video so those are first

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:30.439 
showed you a moment ago those supply

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:32.709 
showed you a moment ago those supply

spinning inside of the stator which we
see<00:01:44.750> over<00:01:44.899> here<00:01:45.159> creates<00:01:46.159> a<00:01:46.250> magnetic<00:01:46.429> field

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
see over here creates a magnetic field

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.209 
see over here creates a magnetic field
which<00:01:47.509> spins<00:01:47.780> inside<00:01:47.960> there<00:01:48.409> generates<00:01:48.920> an<00:01:49.070> AC

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:49.219 
which spins inside there generates an AC

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:52.749 
which spins inside there generates an AC
current<00:01:49.579> of<00:01:49.759> about<00:01:49.850> 16<00:01:50.390> volts<00:01:51.429> that<00:01:52.429> is

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:52.759 
current of about 16 volts that is

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:54.940 
current of about 16 volts that is

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
actually sent from this stator through

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:56.679 
actually sent from this stator through
these<00:01:55.130> three<00:01:55.340> yellow<00:01:55.549> wires<00:01:55.850> up<00:01:56.359> to<00:01:56.570> the

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:56.689 
these three yellow wires up to the

00:01:56.689 --> 00:01:58.330 
these three yellow wires up to the
regulator<00:01:57.079> rectifier<00:01:57.259> which<00:01:57.920> then<00:01:58.130> converts

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
regulator rectifier which then converts

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.779 
regulator rectifier which then converts
it<00:01:58.609> back<00:01:58.789> to<00:01:58.939> DC<00:01:59.090> voltage<00:01:59.689> in<00:02:00.649> turn<00:02:01.070> charging

00:02:01.779 --> 00:02:01.789 
it back to DC voltage in turn charging

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:03.760 
it back to DC voltage in turn charging

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
this charging system works next we'll go

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:25.280 
this charging system works next we'll go
through<00:02:15.800> testing
