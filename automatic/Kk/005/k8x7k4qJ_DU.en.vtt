00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
it for a little while and it's pretty

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.360 
it for a little while and it's pretty
nice<00:00:36.750> it<00:00:36.989> it<00:00:37.260> works<00:00:37.469> really<00:00:37.739> well<00:00:37.860> and<00:00:38.010> it's

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
nice it it works really well and it's

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.630 
nice it it works really well and it's
been<00:00:38.430> newly<00:00:38.910> updated<00:00:39.059> so<00:00:39.540> it's<00:00:39.660> not<00:00:39.809> quite<00:00:40.200> as

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:40.640 
been newly updated so it's not quite as

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.590 
been newly updated so it's not quite as
skeuomorphic<00:00:41.640> or<00:00:41.790> it<00:00:41.850> doesn't<00:00:42.030> really<00:00:42.329> look

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
skeuomorphic or it doesn't really look

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.110 
skeuomorphic or it doesn't really look
like<00:00:42.680> it's<00:00:43.680> something<00:00:44.070> real-world<00:00:44.730> that<00:00:45.000> it's

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
like it's something real-world that it's

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.369 
like it's something real-world that it's
not<00:00:45.329> meaning<00:00:45.780> they<00:00:45.930> used<00:00:46.110> to<00:00:46.170> have<00:00:46.260> this

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
not meaning they used to have this

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.650 
not meaning they used to have this
little<00:00:46.530> reel-to-reel<00:00:47.070> tape<00:00:47.520> thing<00:00:47.850> let<00:00:48.390> me<00:00:48.480> go

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
little reel-to-reel tape thing let me go

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.709 
little reel-to-reel tape thing let me go
here<00:00:49.050> tap<00:00:50.010> on<00:00:50.219> this<00:00:50.460> turn<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.239> volume<00:00:51.390> all<00:00:51.690> the

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
here tap on this turn the volume all the

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.139 
here tap on this turn the volume all the
way<00:00:51.840> down<00:00:52.129> you<00:00:53.129> used<00:00:53.340> to<00:00:53.430> be<00:00:53.489> able<00:00:53.550> to<00:00:53.670> tap<00:00:53.940> on

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
way down you used to be able to tap on

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:55.670 
way down you used to be able to tap on
this<00:00:54.270> and<00:00:54.449> you'd<00:00:54.570> have<00:00:54.660> a<00:00:54.719> reel-to-reel<00:00:55.199> tape

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
this and you'd have a reel-to-reel tape

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.549 
this and you'd have a reel-to-reel tape
that's<00:00:56.309> gone<00:00:56.640> and<00:00:57.090> we<00:00:57.750> have<00:00:57.899> this<00:00:58.050> nice<00:00:58.289> new

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
that's gone and we have this nice new

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.439 
that's gone and we have this nice new
interface<00:00:58.980> so<00:00:59.280> maybe<00:00:59.760> that's<00:01:00.030> one<00:01:00.270> of<00:01:00.359> those

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
interface so maybe that's one of those

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.170 
interface so maybe that's one of those
little<00:01:00.600> hints<00:01:01.079> towards<00:01:01.379> iOS<00:01:01.949> 7<00:01:02.340> it's<00:01:02.850> hard<00:01:03.030> to

little hints towards iOS 7 it's hard to
say<00:01:03.390> but<00:01:03.449> Apple<00:01:03.989> does<00:01:04.170> make<00:01:04.379> this<00:01:04.589> app<00:01:04.860> and

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.309 
around so in this case I use my iPad
sometimes<00:02:23.040> this<00:02:23.220> is<00:02:23.370> my<00:02:23.489> iPad<00:02:23.819> Mini<00:02:24.000> and<00:02:24.330> we

sometimes this is my iPad Mini and we

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:26.960 
sometimes this is my iPad Mini and we
can<00:02:25.500> turn<00:02:25.680> this<00:02:25.830> on<00:02:26.069> so<00:02:26.430> maybe<00:02:26.610> you<00:02:26.730> have<00:02:26.760> an

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
let's minimize that here maybe you have

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.259 
let's minimize that here maybe you have
an<00:02:33.750> iPad<00:02:34.140> around<00:02:34.260> that<00:02:34.560> you<00:02:34.620> use<00:02:35.390> or<00:02:36.390> don't<00:02:36.780> use
