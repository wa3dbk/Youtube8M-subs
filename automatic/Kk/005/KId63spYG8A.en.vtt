00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.500

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:22.420

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.250

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.390
 a normal boy read all that special 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.170
 can be 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:28.170

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.280

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.359

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:52.890

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.090
 we are entering now that your mind was still feeling 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.850
 never thought of anything 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.170
