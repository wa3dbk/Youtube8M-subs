00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:05.120
 Hello and welcome to us 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.170
 welcome you here to the heroic 

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.420
 iron oxide the johann i am the jock 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.800
 scott hello we also beat directly 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.630
 one at the first boss this nice 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.460
 little place here on his wolf 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.320
 intervenes and as so often is at 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.430
 focus must you must first the wolf 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.560
 Slash a bit and then 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.779
 the bach goes down as well 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.850
 the very first name of the meat shred still 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.529
 gaal 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:27.960
 that suggests very good not for 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.910
 his good game is known 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.470
 we make you first have to wolf 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.480
 even if he then blows away from him 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.040
 has risen because he is annoying and 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.510
 then comes to the hall second 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.430
 important skill if he is in this red 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.020
 babbel gives then you should not him 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.940
 because you 're scared that way 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.040
 had berlin because your character has 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.480
 fear of the red bar is gone I have 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.500
 was suspect also fear that they are 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.379
 then you should not hit yourself either 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.610
 and really just out of the fire 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.140
 go out that we come again and again 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.129
 because that's people with arrows from the top 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.590
 down shoot, however, we can 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.059
 not do anything except sell then would 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.510
 also dead and then it goes on already 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:02.910
 you me second boss the overseer of 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.159
 grimm track the supporters of the 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.810
 founders berlin these three funny ones 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.180
 friends here the different 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.220
 skills are the most important thing 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.869
 focused on you are the 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.240
 healer in the middle the very many 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.400
 blood clean you have to necessarily 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.530
 do not interrupt that does not cure you 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.200
 So do your friends and do some fishing 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.909
 So you always do normal ones 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.979
 the healer always first in hall first 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.900
 only difference if the good one 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.040
 big red babbel acts around him 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.110
 and what before 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.430
 then you should not be on it either 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.380
 in that case, if you have the 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.780
 Bubble destroyed which has just under 300,000 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.189
 It heals those who live on the 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.950
 most injured it in the case 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.619
 No one can fight here in the fight 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.180
 Allow ball and take too long 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:47.310
 otherwise a funnier little one will stay 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.200
 bub schedule shifts you have to 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.759
 blow that's different for me 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.500
 draws us down in halo and hunting 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.390
 and then at the end only he is here 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.369
 there is then the firefighters and 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.159
 stay stationary on the ground stands the 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.909
 Just want to party and dodge 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.780
 blow him away 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.610
 exactly 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.659
 the next bus is even easier 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.040
 The bosses are not here 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:08.899
 all especially complicated even if they are 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.220
 that's a bit more difficult 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:11.720
 all about us at big finals 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:15.860
 to prepare that for this funny one 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:17.510
 kjaer comes is a cat one 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.940
 big under the essential three things 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.140
 the one on it he has summoned ads so 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.720
 that is he swears he lets her out 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.730
 The cage around the cage because the otherwise 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.020
 pretty annoying there are no wolves the 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.760
 Do a lot of harm to the 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:32.270
 both Saturdays and this big guy 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:34.280
 this is where many poison stuffs do it 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:37.730
 you still have your primeval attack 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:40.400
 So his primeval attack and 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:43.280
 my favorite my favorite attack 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.410
 it is the second time he supports it 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.910
 on someone and try him 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:48.620
 to feed on and he listens first 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:49.880
 if you give him a certain 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:53.269
 percentage of his life points into 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:54.860
 face beating is relative 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:56.750
 You should just go over it quickly 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:58.010
 Pay attention that the one under him 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.209
 lies and is being eaten to 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.380
 one can still defend himself 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:01.700
 So you should not just stop 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.290
 press the pause button a bit 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.610
 to go to the toilet and the other should 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:06.260
 the one who is cooler and of course 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:08.299
 use of hall also kulanz get what 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.190
 really hurts and when you play the on 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:12.890
 have been through long enough then lies 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:14.299
 the north in the track and then get that 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:15.769
 real highlight not so much because 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:17.690
 the difficulty but easy 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:19.340
 because it's one of the most charged effect 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:19.910
 heroic bosses is me ever 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.010
 have seen 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:25.340
 he fights against this big gray one 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:27.260
 here and his two also buddies now 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.060
 not much happens as first skin 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.049
 you the small place around the annoying 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.030
 a little bit of it makes a bit 

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:33.470
 many melee damage therefore tanks 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:35.510
 be sure to pay attention to both 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:37.250
 tie and a coupe the place as possible 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:39.530
 it's best to break it quickly 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:41.450
 before the ground pushes you away 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:43.010
 Exactly and then there is the second 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:44.090
 act of putting that to his cannon then 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:46.160
 you can do nothing first 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:48.079
 He will come out as soon as you succeed 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.650
 knocked over was annoying but not nearly 

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:50.480
 to 4 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:52.100
 you see, it's coming now 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.109
 the gray blare we will all over 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:55.340
 bounced backwards to the rearmost 

00:03:54.109 --> 00:03:56.720
 edge and must now as fast as possible 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:58.910
 Cover look behind these two 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:00.680
 constructions because now the reason namely 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:03.079
 Rockets with rockets and you 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:05.930
 you have to take care not to stay twice 

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:07.489
 these rocket attacks are behind 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:09.470
 because the back is also a furnace of 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:11.690
 you also can do harm 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:13.099
 You can finish this if you completely 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:14.760
 if you run to him and him 

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:16.260
 first meet then the phase is over 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.479
 both continue the normal fight until 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.949
 the next reason men's head you see 

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:21.449
 Normally you have all in now 

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:23.130
 then the second phase again 

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:24.389
 second place for you the little bit 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:27.240
 Of course, first blow 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:29.130
 No at the end had to go back 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.840
 wait for rocket attacks and afterwards 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:32.610
 can you hit the granden 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:34.470
 the reason itself so long you not 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:35.940
 is just throwing atomic bombs 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:37.830
 actually relatively unspectacular 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:39.150
 you should only take care as a close associate 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:42.530
 or ranged or you do not have his battery 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:42.530
 on many thanks
