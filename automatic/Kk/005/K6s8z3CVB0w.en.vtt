00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
this video if I make things a little

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.610 
this video if I make things a little
easier<00:00:47.010> on<00:00:47.250> Alex<00:00:47.520> and<00:00:47.610> give<00:00:47.730> them<00:00:47.879> a<00:00:47.940> PVC<00:00:48.210> pipe

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:48.620 
easier on Alex and give them a PVC pipe

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.869 
easier on Alex and give them a PVC pipe
we'll<00:00:49.620> go<00:00:49.710> through<00:00:49.980> each<00:00:50.129> through<00:00:50.579> all<00:00:50.700> the

so if he goes all new all the way into a
full<00:01:14.280> triple<00:01:14.729> extension<00:01:14.909> so<00:01:15.270> he<00:01:15.360> pulls

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
himself all the way up high and now once

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.340 
himself all the way up high and now once
he's<00:01:17.759> here<00:01:18.119> you<00:01:18.390> probably<00:01:18.630> can't<00:01:18.990> pull<00:01:19.229> the

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
he's here you probably can't pull the

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.710 
he's here you probably can't pull the
weight<00:01:19.530> much<00:01:20.280> higher<00:01:20.549> it's<00:01:21.030> going<00:01:21.240> to<00:01:21.299> float

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
weight much higher it's going to float

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:22.999 
weight much higher it's going to float
because<00:01:22.110> he<00:01:22.200> hat<00:01:22.350> he's<00:01:22.560> going<00:01:22.710> to<00:01:22.770> have<00:01:22.860> some

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
because he hat he's going to have some

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.800 
because he hat he's going to have some
momentum<00:01:23.250> on<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.700> bar<00:01:23.880> really<00:01:24.509> at<00:01:24.600> this<00:01:24.720> point

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
momentum on the bar really at this point

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.499 
momentum on the bar really at this point
he's<00:01:25.170> thinking<00:01:25.310> shrug<00:01:26.310> elbows<00:01:27.030> up<00:01:27.210> and<00:01:27.330> back

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
he's thinking shrug elbows up and back

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.270 
he's thinking shrug elbows up and back
and<00:01:27.659> he's<00:01:27.750> pulling<00:01:28.140> himself<00:01:28.290> all<00:01:28.829> the<00:01:28.890> way<00:01:29.159> to

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
and he's pulling himself all the way to

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.130 
and he's pulling himself all the way to
the<00:01:29.400> bottom<00:01:29.790> of<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:30.360> squat<00:01:30.509> so<00:01:30.720> maybe<00:01:30.869> do<00:01:30.990> that

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
the bottom of the squat so maybe do that

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.190 
the bottom of the squat so maybe do that
slow<00:01:31.439> motion<00:01:32.270> shrugs<00:01:33.270> elbows<00:01:33.780> up<00:01:33.900> and<00:01:34.020> back

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
slow motion shrugs elbows up and back

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.660 
slow motion shrugs elbows up and back
and<00:01:34.590> then<00:01:34.799> he<00:01:34.860> goes<00:01:35.009> all<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.340> way<00:01:35.490> to<00:01:35.579> the

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
and then he goes all the way to the

so pull your elbows up and back that way

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.260 
so pull your elbows up and back that way
is<00:02:07.799> keeping<00:02:08.039> the<00:02:08.099> bar<00:02:08.280> nice<00:02:08.550> and<00:02:08.849> closed<00:02:09.119> you

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
is keeping the bar nice and closed you

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.699 
is keeping the bar nice and closed you
can<00:02:09.360> see<00:02:09.450> there's<00:02:09.599> no<00:02:09.720> space<00:02:10.080> here<00:02:10.379> the<00:02:10.410> closer

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
can see there's no space here the closer

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.200 
can see there's no space here the closer
the<00:02:10.950> bar<00:02:11.099> is<00:02:11.250> to<00:02:11.670> his<00:02:11.849> body<00:02:12.150> the<00:02:12.420> easier

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210 
the bar is to his body the easier

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:15.240 
the bar is to his body the easier
to<00:02:13.300> be<00:02:13.450> if<00:02:13.810> he<00:02:13.960> doesn't<00:02:14.260> wrong<00:02:14.440> and<00:02:14.830> he<00:02:14.920> curls

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
to be if he doesn't wrong and he curls

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.400 
to be if he doesn't wrong and he curls
instead<00:02:15.840> there's<00:02:16.840> going<00:02:16.930> to<00:02:16.990> be<00:02:17.050> a<00:02:17.110> bunch<00:02:17.260> of

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
instead there's going to be a bunch of

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.020 
instead there's going to be a bunch of
space<00:02:17.680> here<00:02:18.040> now<00:02:18.220> he's<00:02:18.430> going<00:02:18.550> to<00:02:18.610> have<00:02:18.760> to<00:02:18.850> put

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
space here now he's going to have to put

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.300 
space here now he's going to have to put
his<00:02:19.150> ball<00:02:19.450> his<00:02:19.750> body<00:02:20.020> underneath<00:02:20.500> the<00:02:20.620> bar<00:02:20.860> by

to land on a perfect overhead squat he's
landing<00:02:38.710> with<00:02:38.830> his<00:02:38.950> elbows<00:02:39.340> locked<00:02:39.610> out<00:02:39.880> the

are down knees are out over his toes

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.180 
are down knees are out over his toes
he's<00:02:46.270> got<00:02:46.390> a<00:02:46.420> nice<00:02:46.660> tight<00:02:47.110> back<00:02:47.440> he's<00:02:48.040> in<00:02:48.100> a

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
perfect overhead squat position and then

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.500 
perfect overhead squat position and then
ideally<00:02:50.620> he<00:02:50.860> can<00:02:51.010> ride<00:02:51.340> the<00:02:51.610> bounce<00:02:51.820> out<00:02:52.240> of

ideally he can ride the bounce out of

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.060 
ideally he can ride the bounce out of
the<00:02:52.720> bottom<00:02:53.020> of<00:02:53.080> the<00:02:53.170> lift<00:02:53.380> go<00:02:53.770> ahead<00:02:53.890> and<00:02:53.980> show

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.070 
the bottom of the lift go ahead and show

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:57.900 
the bottom of the lift go ahead and show
it<00:02:54.190> riding<00:02:54.400> the<00:02:54.550> bounce<00:02:54.700> looks<00:02:54.910> like<00:02:55.090> I<00:02:56.910> guess

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
it riding the bounce looks like I guess

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:59.970 
it riding the bounce looks like I guess
who's<00:02:58.120> going<00:02:58.330> down<00:02:58.570> and<00:02:59.020> at<00:02:59.500> the<00:02:59.590> bottom<00:02:59.770> of

who's going down and at the bottom of
the<00:03:00.040> movement<00:03:00.400> instead<00:03:00.790> of<00:03:00.970> sort<00:03:01.360> of<00:03:01.420> pausing

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
the movement instead of sort of pausing

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:03.330 
the movement instead of sort of pausing
he's<00:03:02.230> just<00:03:02.410> going<00:03:02.590> to<00:03:02.650> he's<00:03:02.920> going<00:03:03.130> to<00:03:03.190> come

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
he's just going to he's going to come

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:04.590 
he's just going to he's going to come
down<00:03:03.430> and<00:03:03.580> just<00:03:03.670> kind<00:03:03.820> of<00:03:03.940> bounce<00:03:04.180> out<00:03:04.420> of<00:03:04.450> the

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730 
well that's a personal preference thing

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:54.510 
well that's a personal preference thing
but<00:03:52.540> what<00:03:52.630> you<00:03:52.720> don't<00:03:52.870> want<00:03:53.020> to<00:03:53.110> do<00:03:53.230> is<00:03:53.500> is<00:03:54.250> hop

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
your feet out too wide or you end up in

00:03:59.130 --> 00:03:59.140 
the jumping jack position just go and do

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:02.040 
the jumping jack position just go and do
it<00:03:59.170> wrong<00:03:59.820> if<00:04:00.820> your<00:04:01.240> hop<00:04:01.360> your<00:04:01.540> feet<00:04:01.660> out<00:04:01.780> to

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:02.050 
it wrong if your hop your feet out to

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:03.830 
it wrong if your hop your feet out to
why<00:04:02.260> it's<00:04:02.500> going<00:04:02.620> to<00:04:02.680> be<00:04:02.770> very<00:04:02.890> hard<00:04:03.280> to<00:04:03.550> get

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
why it's going to be very hard to get

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.630 
why it's going to be very hard to get
extremely<00:04:04.840> low<00:04:05.140> on<00:04:05.500> your<00:04:05.920> overhead<00:04:06.160> squat

extremely low on your overhead squat

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.610 
extremely low on your overhead squat
it's<00:04:07.120> easier<00:04:07.570> to<00:04:07.690> squat<00:04:07.960> all<00:04:08.140> the<00:04:08.170> way<00:04:08.320> down

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
it's easier to squat all the way down

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:10.590 
it's easier to squat all the way down
with<00:04:09.220> my<00:04:09.370> feet<00:04:09.580> right<00:04:09.760> under<00:04:10.030> me<00:04:10.150> like<00:04:10.330> this

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:14.530 
I can't squat down this low it's going

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:15.660 
I can't squat down this low it's going

more as I pull out a little bit more it
helps<00:04:41.700> me<00:04:41.850> push<00:04:42.330> my<00:04:42.510> hips<00:04:42.660> forward<00:04:42.780> gives<00:04:43.500> me<00:04:43.620> a

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:43.650 
helps me push my hips forward gives me a

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:45.409 
helps me push my hips forward gives me a
more<00:04:43.980> vertical<00:04:44.490> back<00:04:44.910> and<00:04:45.090> it<00:04:45.180> makes<00:04:45.300> it

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:45.419 
more vertical back and it makes it

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:46.520 
more vertical back and it makes it
easier<00:04:45.780> to<00:04:45.810> hold<00:04:46.050> the<00:04:46.139> weight<00:04:46.290> overhead

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:46.530 
easier to hold the weight overhead

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:49.129 
easier to hold the weight overhead
especially<00:04:47.310> at<00:04:47.760> the<00:04:47.850> bottom<00:04:48.090> of<00:04:48.510> the<00:04:48.990> movement

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:49.139 
especially at the bottom of the movement

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:51.920 
especially at the bottom of the movement
I<00:04:49.470> can<00:04:49.500> be<00:04:49.740> here<00:04:50.160> with<00:04:50.460> a<00:04:50.490> vertical<00:04:50.790> torso<00:04:51.360> if

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:51.930 
I can be here with a vertical torso if

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:54.470 
I can be here with a vertical torso if
I'm<00:04:52.110> like<00:04:52.290> this<00:04:52.500> is<00:04:52.770> I<00:04:53.400> kind<00:04:53.910> of<00:04:53.970> I<00:04:54.180> kind<00:04:54.389> of

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:54.480 
I'm like this is I kind of I kind of

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:55.700 
I'm like this is I kind of I kind of
round<00:04:54.690> my<00:04:54.810> back<00:04:54.960> a<00:04:54.990> little<00:04:55.200> bit<00:04:55.350> and<00:04:55.500> it<00:04:55.560> makes

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:55.710 
round my back a little bit and it makes

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:58.430 
round my back a little bit and it makes
it<00:04:55.830> harder<00:04:56.280> for<00:04:56.490> me<00:04:56.940> to<00:04:57.030> get<00:04:57.240> into<00:04:57.840> a<00:04:57.870> vertical

00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:58.440 
it harder for me to get into a vertical

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:01.460 
it harder for me to get into a vertical
arm<00:04:58.800> position<00:04:59.220> so<00:04:59.479> I'm<00:05:00.479> not<00:05:00.690> I'm<00:05:00.900> not<00:05:00.930> stuck<00:05:01.320> on

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:01.470 
arm position so I'm not I'm not stuck on

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:03.469 
arm position so I'm not I'm not stuck on
feet<00:05:01.800> totally<00:05:02.280> straight<00:05:02.520> ahead<00:05:02.639> it's<00:05:03.300> going

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:03.479 
feet totally straight ahead it's going

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:07.820 
feet totally straight ahead it's going
to<00:05:03.540> be<00:05:03.889> dependent<00:05:04.889> on<00:05:04.979> your<00:05:05.490> personal<00:05:06.830> body

00:05:12.469 --> 00:05:12.479 
you need to do that or not and how

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:13.850 
you need to do that or not and how
mobile<00:05:12.810> you<00:05:12.900> are<00:05:13.020> so<00:05:13.200> it's<00:05:13.320> a<00:05:13.350> combination<00:05:13.590> of

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:13.860 
mobile you are so it's a combination of

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:16.040 
mobile you are so it's a combination of

been real hot on that cue myself but I

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:54.529 
been real hot on that cue myself but I
know<00:05:53.370> some<00:05:53.610> people<00:05:53.789> to<00:05:53.850> like<00:05:54.030> it<00:05:54.180> if<00:05:54.270> you<00:05:54.360> like

00:05:54.529 --> 00:05:54.539 
know some people to like it if you like

00:05:54.539 --> 00:05:56.000 
know some people to like it if you like
it<00:05:54.570> keep<00:05:54.990> using<00:05:55.229> it<00:05:55.380> that's<00:05:55.530> great<00:05:55.860> I

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:56.010 
it keep using it that's great I

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:59.120 
it keep using it that's great I
personally<00:05:56.910> like<00:05:57.389> to<00:05:57.419> try<00:05:58.080> to<00:05:58.139> pull<00:05:58.770> the<00:05:58.950> bar

00:05:59.120 --> 00:05:59.130 
personally like to try to pull the bar

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:02.690 
personally like to try to pull the bar
apart<00:05:59.520> overhead<00:06:00.360> so<00:06:00.840> I<00:06:01.310> Alex<00:06:02.310> has<00:06:02.430> a<00:06:02.460> bar

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:02.700 
apart overhead so I Alex has a bar

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:06.469 
apart overhead so I Alex has a bar
overhead<00:06:03.060> again<00:06:03.770> there<00:06:04.770> you<00:06:04.800> go<00:06:05.150> he's<00:06:06.150> trying

00:06:06.469 --> 00:06:06.479 
overhead again there you go he's trying

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:08.540 
overhead again there you go he's trying
to<00:06:06.660> basically<00:06:06.870> tear<00:06:07.680> the<00:06:07.830> bar<00:06:08.039> in<00:06:08.160> half<00:06:08.340> right

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:08.550 
to basically tear the bar in half right

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:10.279 
to basically tear the bar in half right
in<00:06:08.610> the<00:06:08.729> middle<00:06:08.910> by<00:06:09.000> ripping<00:06:09.360> the<00:06:09.510> bar<00:06:09.750> apart

00:06:10.279 --> 00:06:10.289 
in the middle by ripping the bar apart

00:06:10.289 --> 00:06:12.560 
in the middle by ripping the bar apart
and<00:06:10.560> that's<00:06:10.889> helping<00:06:11.190> him<00:06:11.280> add<00:06:11.610> shoulder

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:12.570 
and that's helping him add shoulder

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:14.540 
and that's helping him add shoulder
stability<00:06:12.690> and<00:06:13.020> scapular<00:06:13.530> stability<00:06:13.740> so<00:06:14.370> he's

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:14.550 
stability and scapular stability so he's

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:17.090 
stability and scapular stability so he's
stronger<00:06:15.030> with<00:06:15.630> the<00:06:15.660> weight<00:06:15.900> overhead<00:06:16.320> if

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:17.100 
stronger with the weight overhead if

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:18.800 
stronger with the weight overhead if
he's<00:06:17.370> standing<00:06:17.580> or<00:06:18.000> if<00:06:18.270> he's<00:06:18.389> at<00:06:18.510> the<00:06:18.600> very

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:18.810 
he's standing or if he's at the very

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:20.750 
he's standing or if he's at the very
bottom<00:06:19.020> of<00:06:19.350> the<00:06:19.500> movement<00:06:19.650> alright<00:06:20.490> so<00:06:20.580> here's

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:20.760 
bottom of the movement alright so here's

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:23.450 
bottom of the movement alright so here's
what<00:06:20.940> it<00:06:21.210> looks<00:06:21.389> like<00:06:21.690> if<00:06:21.870> you<00:06:21.960> aren't<00:06:22.460> using

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:23.460 
what it looks like if you aren't using

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:25.129 
what it looks like if you aren't using
the<00:06:23.760> active<00:06:24.120> shoulder<00:06:24.479> cue<00:06:24.750> or<00:06:24.930> and<00:06:25.050> you're

00:06:25.129 --> 00:06:25.139 
the active shoulder cue or and you're

00:06:25.139 --> 00:06:27.020 
the active shoulder cue or and you're
not<00:06:25.320> trying<00:06:25.620> to<00:06:25.680> pull<00:06:25.889> the<00:06:25.979> bar<00:06:26.160> apart<00:06:26.490> your

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:27.030 
not trying to pull the bar apart your

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:29.570 
not trying to pull the bar apart your
shoulders<00:06:27.419> typically<00:06:28.250> they'll<00:06:29.250> typically

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:29.580 
shoulders typically they'll typically

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:31.219 
shoulders typically they'll typically
roll<00:06:29.880> forward<00:06:30.270> a<00:06:30.300> little<00:06:30.419> bit<00:06:30.539> if<00:06:30.900> I<00:06:30.990> was<00:06:31.110> some

00:06:31.219 --> 00:06:31.229 
roll forward a little bit if I was some

00:06:31.229 --> 00:06:32.779 
roll forward a little bit if I was some
kind<00:06:31.410> of<00:06:31.440> roll<00:06:31.740> shoulder<00:06:32.160> for<00:06:32.370> like<00:06:32.550> that

00:06:32.779 --> 00:06:32.789 
kind of roll shoulder for like that

00:06:32.789 --> 00:06:35.510 
kind of roll shoulder for like that
he'll<00:06:33.479> internally<00:06:34.169> rotate<00:06:34.560> here<00:06:34.950> and<00:06:35.159> he'll

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:35.520 
he'll internally rotate here and he'll

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.010 
he'll internally rotate here and he'll
break<00:06:35.820> and<00:06:36.030> a<00:06:36.090> roll<00:06:36.240> shoulder<00:06:36.599> forward<00:06:36.900> like

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:37.020 
break and a roll shoulder forward like

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:38.540 
break and a roll shoulder forward like
that<00:06:37.050> so

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:38.550 
that so

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:41.060 
that so
it<00:06:39.300> will<00:06:39.390> kind<00:06:39.540> of<00:06:39.570> look<00:06:39.690> like<00:06:39.720> this<00:06:40.070> where

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:41.070 
it will kind of look like this where

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:44.420 
it will kind of look like this where
this<00:06:41.760> gets<00:06:42.540> rolled<00:06:42.900> forward<00:06:43.230> like<00:06:43.470> that<00:06:43.500> we're

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:44.430 
this gets rolled forward like that we're

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:46.490 
this gets rolled forward like that we're
instead<00:06:44.760> of<00:06:44.880> having<00:06:45.090> instead<00:06:46.050> of<00:06:46.170> having<00:06:46.320> the

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:46.500 
instead of having instead of having the

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:48.380 
instead of having instead of having the
fit<00:06:46.650> of<00:06:46.680> his<00:06:46.830> elbow<00:06:47.070> pointing<00:06:47.760> straight<00:06:48.120> up

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:48.390 
fit of his elbow pointing straight up

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:50.690 
fit of his elbow pointing straight up
like<00:06:48.810> this<00:06:49.250> there<00:06:50.250> you<00:06:50.340> go

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:50.700 
like this there you go

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:53.090 
like this there you go
it'll<00:06:51.300> roll<00:06:51.570> forward<00:06:52.170> and<00:06:52.410> it<00:06:52.770> will<00:06:52.890> point

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:53.100 
it'll roll forward and it will point

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:55.460 
it'll roll forward and it will point
forward<00:06:53.400> like<00:06:53.700> that<00:06:53.730> so<00:06:54.600> generally<00:06:55.200> when

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:55.470 
forward like that so generally when

00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:57.110 
forward like that so generally when
you're<00:06:55.560> overhead<00:06:56.040> you<00:06:56.190> want<00:06:56.370> to<00:06:56.460> be<00:06:56.550> going<00:06:57.000> to

00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:57.120 
you're overhead you want to be going to

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:59.360 
you're overhead you want to be going to
be<00:06:57.180> externally<00:06:57.990> rotated<00:06:58.530> not<00:06:58.890> internally

00:06:59.360 --> 00:06:59.370 
be externally rotated not internally

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:00.950 
be externally rotated not internally
rotated<00:06:59.790> so<00:06:59.910> if<00:07:00.000> I'm<00:07:00.090> locking<00:07:00.360> it<00:07:00.570> out

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:00.960 
rotated so if I'm locking it out

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:02.900 
rotated so if I'm locking it out
I<00:07:00.990> instantly<00:07:01.620> rotate<00:07:02.010> like<00:07:02.160> this<00:07:02.580> that's

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:02.910 
I instantly rotate like this that's

00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:04.850 
I instantly rotate like this that's
generally<00:07:03.210> harder<00:07:03.600> on<00:07:03.720> my<00:07:03.840> shoulders<00:07:04.290> I<00:07:04.500> want

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:04.860 
generally harder on my shoulders I want

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:07.100 
generally harder on my shoulders I want
to<00:07:05.160> be<00:07:05.280> extremely<00:07:06.120> rotated<00:07:06.660> as<00:07:06.750> best<00:07:06.930> I<00:07:07.050> can

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:07.110 
to be extremely rotated as best I can

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:09.380 
to be extremely rotated as best I can
the<00:07:07.530> pit<00:07:07.980> of<00:07:08.100> my<00:07:08.220> shoulder<00:07:08.550> will<00:07:08.640> be<00:07:08.700> forcing

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:09.390 
the pit of my shoulder will be forcing

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:11.270 
the pit of my shoulder will be forcing
the<00:07:09.570> pit<00:07:09.930> of<00:07:09.960> my<00:07:10.110> elbow<00:07:10.260> here<00:07:10.500> will<00:07:11.070> point

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:11.280 
the pit of my elbow here will point

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:13.700 
the pit of my elbow here will point
straight<00:07:11.910> up<00:07:12.120> and<00:07:12.330> I'll<00:07:12.720> have<00:07:13.110> my<00:07:13.230> armpits

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:13.710 
straight up and I'll have my armpits

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:15.830 
straight up and I'll have my armpits
kind<00:07:13.950> of<00:07:14.040> facing<00:07:14.460> forward<00:07:14.880> again<00:07:15.510> I<00:07:15.540> won't<00:07:15.720> be

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:15.840 
kind of facing forward again I won't be

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:17.600 
kind of facing forward again I won't be
like<00:07:16.080> this<00:07:16.350> my<00:07:16.770> shoulders<00:07:17.130> won't<00:07:17.250> be<00:07:17.310> forward

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:17.610 
like this my shoulders won't be forward

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:19.640 
like this my shoulders won't be forward
they'll<00:07:18.120> be<00:07:18.210> back<00:07:18.450> and<00:07:18.810> they'll<00:07:18.960> be<00:07:19.080> down<00:07:19.320> and

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:19.650 
they'll be back and they'll be down and

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:20.930 
they'll be back and they'll be down and
they'll<00:07:19.800> be<00:07:19.950> more<00:07:20.160> stable<00:07:20.460> when<00:07:20.760> you're<00:07:20.880> in

00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:20.940 
they'll be more stable when you're in

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:22.430 
they'll be more stable when you're in
that<00:07:21.060> position<00:07:21.210> and<00:07:21.600> you're<00:07:21.750> less<00:07:21.930> likely<00:07:21.960> to

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:22.440 
that position and you're less likely to

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:23.780 
that position and you're less likely to
hurt<00:07:22.530> your<00:07:22.680> shoulder<00:07:23.040> alright<00:07:23.550> so<00:07:23.640> that<00:07:23.760> wraps
