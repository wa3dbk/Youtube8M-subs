00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.440 
bronchitis in there there's evidence of
that<00:00:40.250> so<00:00:41.250> it<00:00:41.340> is<00:00:41.430> very<00:00:41.760> important<00:00:42.270> that<00:00:42.300> a

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
that so it is very important that a

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.420 
that so it is very important that a
diagnosis<00:00:43.230> is<00:00:43.410> made<00:00:43.440> there<00:00:44.010> are<00:00:44.129> many

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
diagnosis is made there are many

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.160

conditions that can have quite
bronchitis<00:00:46.860> and<00:00:47.370> so<00:00:47.579> a<00:00:47.610> proper<00:00:48.360> diagnosis<00:00:49.050> is

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:55.909 
make a big difference

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:58.910 
make a big difference
certainly<00:01:56.909> things<00:01:57.270> like<00:01:57.469> humidifier<00:01:58.469> into
