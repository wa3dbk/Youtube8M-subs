00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:04.080 
okay I'm going to show you we made a

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.530 
okay I'm going to show you we made a
little<00:00:04.380> bit<00:00:04.620> of<00:00:04.740> modifications<00:00:05.670> to<00:00:06.000> the<00:00:06.210> knife

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
little bit of modifications to the knife

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.270 
little bit of modifications to the knife
that<00:00:06.839> we<00:00:06.960> were<00:00:07.109> using<00:00:07.319> on<00:00:07.589> here<00:00:07.859> and<00:00:07.980> this<00:00:08.099> one

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
that we were using on here and this one

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.089 
that we were using on here and this one
works<00:00:08.490> a<00:00:08.670> little<00:00:08.790> bit<00:00:09.000> better<00:00:09.590> this<00:00:10.590> is<00:00:10.650> the

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
works a little bit better this is the

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.789 
works a little bit better this is the
the<00:00:11.820> old<00:00:12.030> knife<00:00:12.360> and<00:00:12.690> it<00:00:12.780> was<00:00:12.809> rounded<00:00:13.500> if<00:00:13.679> you

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
the old knife and it was rounded if you

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.189 
the old knife and it was rounded if you
look<00:00:13.980> at<00:00:14.190> it<00:00:14.340> it's<00:00:14.490> it's<00:00:15.030> got<00:00:15.299> a<00:00:15.330> rounded<00:00:15.809> point

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
look at it it's it's got a rounded point

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.769 
look at it it's it's got a rounded point
on<00:00:16.440> it<00:00:16.619> to<00:00:17.220> wear<00:00:17.340> this<00:00:17.550> one<00:00:17.850> we've<00:00:18.510> got<00:00:18.539> a

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
on it to wear this one we've got a

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.040 
on it to wear this one we've got a
little<00:00:19.080> bit<00:00:19.289> it's<00:00:20.189> a<00:00:20.400> got<00:00:20.880> a<00:00:20.910> flat<00:00:21.270> on<00:00:21.570> it<00:00:21.840> it's

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
little bit it's a got a flat on it it's

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.290 
little bit it's a got a flat on it it's
not<00:00:22.199> nearly<00:00:22.710> as<00:00:22.859> round<00:00:23.310> okay<00:00:23.820> it's<00:00:23.939> got<00:00:24.090> a<00:00:24.119> flat

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
not nearly as round okay it's got a flat

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.790 
not nearly as round okay it's got a flat
and<00:00:24.600> it'll<00:00:24.779> cut<00:00:25.019> a<00:00:25.050> little<00:00:25.320> bit<00:00:25.439> straighter

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
and it'll cut a little bit straighter

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.210 
and it'll cut a little bit straighter
and<00:00:26.099> also<00:00:26.880> along<00:00:27.510> with<00:00:27.750> that<00:00:27.960> we<00:00:28.260> instead<00:00:29.039> of

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
and also along with that we instead of

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.340 
and also along with that we instead of
just<00:00:29.400> a<00:00:29.550> standard<00:00:30.060> collet<00:00:30.539> I've<00:00:31.050> made<00:00:31.380> a<00:00:32.059> knife

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:33.350 
just a standard collet I've made a knife

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.170 
just a standard collet I've made a knife
call<00:00:34.350> it<00:00:34.590> basically<00:00:35.460> that's<00:00:35.760> what<00:00:35.969> it's<00:00:36.120> for

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
call it basically that's what it's for

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.170 
call it basically that's what it's for
is<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.809> knife<00:00:37.050> and<00:00:37.590> it's<00:00:38.070> a<00:00:38.190> longer<00:00:38.430> barrel<00:00:38.910> so

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
is the knife and it's a longer barrel so

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.270 
is the knife and it's a longer barrel so
it's<00:00:39.329> reminiscent<00:00:40.050> of<00:00:40.110> your<00:00:40.350> swivel<00:00:41.129> knife

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
it's reminiscent of your swivel knife

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.750 
it's reminiscent of your swivel knife
and<00:00:41.730> so<00:00:42.000> made<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.170> knife<00:00:43.350> blade<00:00:43.770> longer<00:00:44.430> and

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
and so made the knife blade longer and

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.740 
and so made the knife blade longer and
everything<00:00:45.570> everything<00:00:46.200> on<00:00:46.649> it<00:00:46.860> is<00:00:47.059> is<00:00:48.059> works

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
everything everything on it is is works

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.569 
everything everything on it is is works
more<00:00:48.989> like<00:00:49.170> a<00:00:49.200> swivel<00:00:49.590> knife<00:00:49.620> and<00:00:50.039> it's<00:00:50.160> easier

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
more like a swivel knife and it's easier

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.490 
more like a swivel knife and it's easier
to<00:00:50.640> control<00:00:51.090> you<00:00:51.449> can<00:00:51.600> cut<00:00:51.780> straighter<00:00:52.140> lines

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
to control you can cut straighter lines

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.279 
to control you can cut straighter lines
with<00:00:52.860> it<00:00:53.059> any<00:00:54.059> way<00:00:54.239> it<00:00:54.390> snaps<00:00:54.660> in<00:00:54.899> just<00:00:55.110> like

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
with it any way it snaps in just like

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.220 
with it any way it snaps in just like
your<00:00:55.469> other<00:00:55.620> kaulitz<00:00:56.190> and<00:00:56.809> then<00:00:57.809> when<00:00:58.020> you

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
your other kaulitz and then when you

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.740 
your other kaulitz and then when you
when<00:00:59.129> you<00:00:59.250> use<00:00:59.489> this<00:00:59.699> I'll<00:00:59.969> do<00:01:00.390> a<00:01:00.420> little<00:01:00.539> bit

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
when you use this I'll do a little bit

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.119 
when you use this I'll do a little bit
of<00:01:00.809> cutting<00:01:00.989> them<00:01:01.260> but<00:01:01.410> like<00:01:01.559> here's<00:01:01.890> this

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
of cutting them but like here's this

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.700 
of cutting them but like here's this
here's<00:01:02.699> a<00:01:02.850> straight<00:01:03.300> it's<00:01:03.600> easier<00:01:04.140> to<00:01:04.320> control

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
here's a straight it's easier to control

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.640 
here's a straight it's easier to control
as<00:01:05.070> you're<00:01:05.250> cutting<00:01:05.549> a<00:01:05.640> straight<00:01:06.110> and<00:01:07.110> so<00:01:07.530> I'll

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
as you're cutting a straight and so I'll

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.950 
as you're cutting a straight and so I'll
start<00:01:07.799> here<00:01:08.189> with<00:01:08.340> this<00:01:08.580> and<00:01:09.000> you<00:01:09.750> can<00:01:09.930> just

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
start here with this and you can just

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.990 
start here with this and you can just
guide<00:01:10.409> it<00:01:10.619> along<00:01:10.770> and<00:01:11.420> see<00:01:12.420> how<00:01:12.450> easy<00:01:12.840> it<00:01:13.080> is<00:01:14.000> or

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
guide it along and see how easy it is or

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.359 
guide it along and see how easy it is or
doing<00:01:15.570> that<00:01:15.720> so<00:01:16.020> here<00:01:16.290> comes<00:01:16.619> your<00:01:16.830> straight

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
doing that so here comes your straight

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.020 
doing that so here comes your straight
and<00:01:18.290> you<00:01:19.290> see<00:01:19.530> how<00:01:19.680> much<00:01:19.799> effort<00:01:20.310> is<00:01:20.460> basically

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
and you see how much effort is basically

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.450 
and you see how much effort is basically
no<00:01:21.360> effort<00:01:21.810> involved<00:01:22.290> in<00:01:22.439> this<00:01:22.590> at<00:01:22.770> all<00:01:22.979> ortley

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
no effort involved in this at all ortley

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.890 
no effort involved in this at all ortley
you're<00:01:24.150> just<00:01:25.880> not<00:01:26.880> really<00:01:27.090> any<00:01:27.420> pressure<00:01:27.720> on

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
you're just not really any pressure on

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.660 
you're just not really any pressure on
top<00:01:28.290> on<00:01:28.500> what<00:01:28.710> in<00:01:28.799> the<00:01:28.890> mallet<00:01:29.310> and<00:01:29.460> I'm

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
top on what in the mallet and I'm

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.690 
top on what in the mallet and I'm
holding<00:01:30.090> it<00:01:30.210> I'm<00:01:30.680> guiding<00:01:31.680> with<00:01:31.829> my<00:01:32.100> thumb<00:01:32.490> and

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
holding it I'm guiding with my thumb and

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.480 
holding it I'm guiding with my thumb and
index<00:01:35.700> finger<00:01:35.930> but<00:01:36.930> now<00:01:37.140> what<00:01:37.409> I<00:01:37.439> want<00:01:37.770> to<00:01:37.860> cut

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
index finger but now what I want to cut

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.840 
index finger but now what I want to cut
with<00:01:38.700> this<00:01:38.970> I<00:01:39.299> could<00:01:40.200> sit<00:01:40.439> here<00:01:40.470> and<00:01:41.009> it<00:01:41.130> will<00:01:41.610> a

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
with this I could sit here and it will a

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.230 
with this I could sit here and it will a
lot<00:01:42.150> nicer<00:01:42.680> it's<00:01:43.680> easier<00:01:44.250> to<00:01:44.490> get<00:01:44.670> your<00:01:44.939> curves

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
lot nicer it's easier to get your curves

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.590 
lot nicer it's easier to get your curves
as<00:01:45.869> you<00:01:46.079> can<00:01:46.259> see<00:01:46.530> there's<00:01:47.460> no<00:01:47.939> effort<00:01:48.180> at<00:01:48.390> all

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
as you can see there's no effort at all

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.679 
as you can see there's no effort at all
involved<00:01:49.079> in<00:01:49.350> that<00:01:49.880> and<00:01:50.880> you<00:01:51.030> just<00:01:51.060> let<00:01:51.329> it<00:01:51.450> cut

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
involved in that and you just let it cut

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:56.090 
involved in that and you just let it cut
off<00:01:52.200> easier<00:01:52.829> to<00:01:52.950> control<00:01:54.229> and<00:01:55.229> you're<00:01:55.890> holding

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
off easier to control and you're holding

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.469 
off easier to control and you're holding
it<00:01:56.369> basically<00:01:56.790> down<00:01:57.060> here<00:01:57.299> and<00:01:57.390> you're

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
it basically down here and you're

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.080 
it basically down here and you're
letting<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:57.810> mallet<00:01:58.200> balance<00:01:58.770> is<00:01:59.670> what<00:01:59.969> it

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
letting the mallet balance is what it

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.560 
letting the mallet balance is what it
amounts<00:02:00.479> to<00:02:00.509> and<00:02:00.960> I'm<00:02:01.399> holding<00:02:02.399> it<00:02:02.579> just<00:02:02.820> back

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
amounts to and I'm holding it just back

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.569 
amounts to and I'm holding it just back
it<00:02:03.840> just<00:02:03.869> a<00:02:04.170> little<00:02:04.469> bit<00:02:04.799> of<00:02:04.890> an<00:02:04.950> angle<00:02:05.130> I'm<00:02:05.430> in

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
it just a little bit of an angle I'm in

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.270 
it just a little bit of an angle I'm in
a<00:02:05.610> time<00:02:05.909> for<00:02:06.210> pellets<00:02:06.630> it<00:02:07.500> will<00:02:07.619> help<00:02:07.799> propel

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
a time for pellets it will help propel

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:27.729 
a time for pellets it will help propel
its<00:02:08.459> way<00:02:08.670> through<00:02:09.090> when<00:02:10.080> you're<00:02:10.259> doing<00:02:12.200> turn

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:27.739 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:32.330 

no<00:02:28.739> effort<00:02:29.069> and<00:02:29.400> pushing<00:02:29.849> it<00:02:30.090> all<00:02:31.190> and<00:02:32.190> when

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
no effort and pushing it all and when

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.130 
no effort and pushing it all and when
you<00:02:32.430> get<00:02:32.580> to<00:02:32.790> a<00:02:32.819> straight<00:02:33.209> it's<00:02:33.659> easy<00:02:33.870> to

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
you get to a straight it's easy to

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:46.910 
you get to a straight it's easy to
control

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.950 

and<00:02:47.460> we'll<00:02:47.670> say<00:02:47.880> like<00:02:48.120> you<00:02:48.330> want<00:02:48.540> to<00:02:48.630> come<00:02:48.810> in

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:48.960 
and we'll say like you want to come in

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.920 
and we'll say like you want to come in
and<00:02:49.110> make<00:02:49.260> it<00:02:49.290> cut<00:02:49.880> you<00:02:50.880> can<00:02:51.120> come<00:02:51.390> in<00:02:51.570> real

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
and make it cut you can come in real

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.170 
and make it cut you can come in real
lightly<00:02:52.350> with<00:02:52.800> it<00:02:53.010> here<00:02:53.370> like<00:02:53.580> that<00:02:53.880> and

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
lightly with it here like that and

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:59.930 
lightly with it here like that and
better<00:02:54.840> that<00:02:55.140> test<00:02:57.860> and<00:02:58.860> the<00:02:59.310> same<00:02:59.580> when<00:02:59.850> you

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
better that test and the same when you

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.610 
better that test and the same when you
want<00:03:00.120> to<00:03:00.150> come<00:03:00.390> out<00:03:00.660> of<00:03:00.690> it<00:03:00.990> you<00:03:01.020> see<00:03:01.380> how<00:03:01.560> you

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
want to come out of it you see how you

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:07.580 
want to come out of it you see how you
you<00:03:02.310> can<00:03:02.460> feather<00:03:02.700> it<00:03:02.940> in<00:03:03.090> like<00:03:03.330> that<00:03:03.800> and<00:03:06.590> if

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
you can feather it in like that and if

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.440 
you can feather it in like that and if
you<00:03:07.710> were<00:03:07.830> going<00:03:07.980> to<00:03:08.070> come<00:03:08.340> out<00:03:08.640> of<00:03:08.670> a<00:03:08.940> cut<00:03:09.240> you

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
you were going to come out of a cut you

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.930 
you were going to come out of a cut you
just<00:03:09.660> lighten<00:03:10.020> up<00:03:10.320> add<00:03:10.920> you<00:03:11.250> start<00:03:11.700> lifting

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
just lighten up add you start lifting

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.930 
just lighten up add you start lifting
out<00:03:12.360> of<00:03:12.510> it<00:03:12.660> as<00:03:12.840> you<00:03:12.870> come<00:03:13.260> out<00:03:13.440> of<00:03:13.620> it<00:03:13.820> and<00:03:14.820> you

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
out of it as you come out of it and you

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:16.640 
out of it as you come out of it and you
can<00:03:15.120> feather<00:03:15.390> you<00:03:15.900> can<00:03:16.020> see<00:03:16.200> how<00:03:16.320> you<00:03:16.380> can<00:03:16.560> go

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
can feather you can see how you can go

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.550 
can feather you can see how you can go
back<00:03:16.830> to<00:03:17.010> just<00:03:17.040> nothing<00:03:18.050> undercut<00:03:19.050> so<00:03:19.320> you're

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
back to just nothing undercut so you're

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:31.530 
back to just nothing undercut so you're
doing

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:49.550 

any<00:03:32.540> direction<00:03:33.019> put<00:03:33.739> away<00:03:33.980> from<00:03:34.310> you

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.980 

yeah<00:03:50.790> anyway<00:03:51.790> I<00:03:51.880> think<00:03:52.030> you'll<00:03:52.360> find<00:03:52.660> that<00:03:52.840> it

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:52.990 
yeah anyway I think you'll find that it

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:56.340 
yeah anyway I think you'll find that it
makes<00:03:53.020> a<00:03:53.440> lot<00:03:53.620> better<00:03:53.940> it's<00:03:54.940> a<00:03:55.150> really<00:03:55.840> nice

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:56.350 
makes a lot better it's a really nice

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:58.170 
makes a lot better it's a really nice
improvement<00:03:57.040> on<00:03:57.160> the<00:03:57.280> knife<00:03:57.460> and<00:03:57.700> it<00:03:57.850> takes<00:03:58.030> a

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 
improvement on the knife and it takes a

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.740 
improvement on the knife and it takes a
lot<00:03:58.390> of<00:03:58.420> the<00:03:58.750> effort<00:03:59.590> that<00:03:59.620> was<00:03:59.950> involved<00:04:00.750> in

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 
lot of the effort that was involved in

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:04.680 
lot of the effort that was involved in
cutting<00:04:02.140> it<00:04:02.260> and<00:04:02.470> you<00:04:02.650> can<00:04:02.860> start<00:04:03.220> light<00:04:03.690> you

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:04.690 
cutting it and you can start light you

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:07.260 
cutting it and you can start light you
want<00:04:04.810> to<00:04:04.930> go<00:04:05.050> slow<00:04:05.110> you<00:04:05.920> can<00:04:06.130> use<00:04:06.970> your<00:04:07.090> foot

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:07.270 
want to go slow you can use your foot

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:11.010 
want to go slow you can use your foot
pedal<00:04:07.630> for<00:04:07.810> cutting<00:04:08.110> slow<00:04:09.630> and<00:04:10.630> if<00:04:10.720> you<00:04:10.870> have

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:11.020 
pedal for cutting slow and if you have

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:13.380 
pedal for cutting slow and if you have
the<00:04:11.200> desk<00:04:11.470> mount<00:04:11.830> controller<00:04:12.670> you<00:04:12.880> can<00:04:12.940> slow

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:13.390 
the desk mount controller you can slow

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:15.330 
the desk mount controller you can slow
it<00:04:13.510> down<00:04:13.570> so<00:04:13.960> you<00:04:13.990> can<00:04:14.230> go<00:04:14.440> as<00:04:14.650> slow<00:04:14.950> as<00:04:15.190> you

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.340 
it down so you can go as slow as you

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:20.910 
it down so you can go as slow as you
need<00:04:15.370> to<00:04:16.440> to<00:04:17.440> get<00:04:17.650> your<00:04:17.800> control<00:04:19.739> just<00:04:20.739> like

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:20.920 
need to to get your control just like

need to to get your control just like
that<00:04:21.190> that's<00:04:21.520> full<00:04:21.790> speed<00:04:22.270> on<00:04:22.660> it<00:04:22.810> now<00:04:22.990> with

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:23.230 
that that's full speed on it now with

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:25.560 
that that's full speed on it now with
the<00:04:23.350> desk<00:04:23.620> controller<00:04:24.130> it's<00:04:24.940> like<00:04:25.150> dip<00:04:25.360> it

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:25.570 
the desk controller it's like dip it

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:28.650 
the desk controller it's like dip it
here<00:04:25.840> so<00:04:26.680> you<00:04:26.740> don't<00:04:27.010> have<00:04:27.160> any<00:04:27.370> effort<00:04:27.820> at<00:04:28.600> all

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:28.660 
here so you don't have any effort at all

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:30.690 
here so you don't have any effort at all
wouldn't<00:04:29.170> even<00:04:29.230> try<00:04:29.590> to<00:04:29.620> control<00:04:30.280> it<00:04:30.400> but<00:04:30.550> you

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:30.700 
wouldn't even try to control it but you

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:33.000 
wouldn't even try to control it but you
can<00:04:30.850> see<00:04:31.090> there<00:04:31.420> what<00:04:31.630> I'm<00:04:31.780> doing<00:04:32.710> and<00:04:32.860> I'm<00:04:32.980> not
