00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
square block goes all the way through to

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.080 
square block goes all the way through to
the<00:00:35.640> front<00:00:36.260> alright<00:00:37.280> see<00:00:38.280> this<00:00:38.670> one<00:00:38.850> stops

right<00:00:39.300> here<00:00:39.329> now<00:00:41.180> Reverend<00:00:42.180> American<00:00:42.480> tech<00:00:42.690> I

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
right here now Reverend American tech I

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.310 
right here now Reverend American tech I
guess<00:00:43.829> yours<00:00:44.160> is<00:00:44.489> a<00:00:44.520> different<00:00:45.329> version<00:00:45.809> of<00:00:46.140> an

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
guess yours is a different version of an

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.500 
guess yours is a different version of an
upper<00:00:46.559> that<00:00:47.489> would<00:00:47.640> obviously<00:00:47.789> cause<00:00:48.360> you

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
upper that would obviously cause you

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.410 
upper that would obviously cause you
some<00:00:48.690> problems<00:00:49.020> with<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.890> lip<00:00:50.219> for<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.270> toy

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
some problems with the lip for the toy

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.490 
some problems with the lip for the toy
alpha<00:00:51.780> rail<00:00:52.309> so<00:00:53.309> yeah<00:00:54.300> I<00:00:54.660> think<00:00:54.719> you<00:00:55.110> are<00:00:55.350> going

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
alpha rail so yeah I think you are going

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.709 
alpha rail so yeah I think you are going
to<00:00:55.559> need<00:00:55.739> to<00:00:56.690> do<00:00:57.690> some<00:00:57.870> grinding<00:00:58.260> on<00:00:58.350> that

00:00:59.709 --> 00:00:59.719 
to need to do some grinding on that

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:01.849 
to need to do some grinding on that
that's<00:01:00.719> compared<00:01:01.109> to<00:01:01.230> this<00:01:01.379> since<00:01:01.710> it's

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
that's compared to this since it's

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:08.210 
that's compared to this since it's
already<00:01:03.920> there<00:01:04.920> we<00:01:05.040> go<00:01:05.250> this<00:01:06.240> one<00:01:06.420> is<00:01:06.540> flush<00:01:07.220> to

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
already there we go this one is flush to

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.320 
already there we go this one is flush to
the<00:01:08.250> fact<00:01:08.760> that<00:01:08.850> it's<00:01:09.060> rounded<00:01:09.479> right<00:01:10.170> here

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:11.330 
the fact that it's rounded right here

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:16.070 
the fact that it's rounded right here
and<00:01:12.330> this<00:01:12.540> isn't<00:01:13.220> so<00:01:14.220> that<00:01:14.369> lip<00:01:14.640> a<00:01:14.930> lip<00:01:15.930> is

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
and this isn't so that lip a lip is

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.050 
and this isn't so that lip a lip is
hitting<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:16.320> side<00:01:16.530> of<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.830> receiver<00:01:17.159> upper

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
hitting the side of the receiver upper

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.520 
hitting the side of the receiver upper
receiver<00:01:18.420> right<00:01:18.570> here<00:01:18.750> and<00:01:18.900> not<00:01:19.020> lining<00:01:19.350> up

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
receiver right here and not lining up

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.340 
receiver right here and not lining up
with<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:19.799> upper<00:01:20.189> rails<00:01:20.960> yeah<00:01:21.960> you're<00:01:22.140> going

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
with the upper rails yeah you're going

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.960 
with the upper rails yeah you're going
to<00:01:22.439> do<00:01:22.560> some<00:01:22.770> milling<00:01:23.280> word<00:01:23.430> on<00:01:23.580> that<00:01:23.610> thing

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
to do some milling word on that thing

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.740 
to do some milling word on that thing

guide<00:01:44.280> on<00:01:45.030> the<00:01:45.899> troy<00:01:46.200> alpha<00:01:46.560> rail<00:01:46.740> so<00:01:47.700> yeah

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
guide on the troy alpha rail so yeah

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.520 
guide on the troy alpha rail so yeah
that's<00:01:48.299> just<00:01:48.479> putting<00:01:48.869> on<00:01:48.930> the<00:01:48.990> barrel<00:01:49.290> first

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
that's just putting on the barrel first

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.609 
that's just putting on the barrel first
putting<00:01:49.799> your<00:01:50.009> barrel<00:01:50.460> nut<00:01:50.610> on<00:01:50.759> and<00:01:51.060> then

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:51.619 
putting your barrel nut on and then

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:54.649 
putting your barrel nut on and then
actually<00:01:52.619> seen<00:01:53.130> what<00:01:53.880> how<00:01:54.119> much<00:01:54.299> you<00:01:54.450> need<00:01:54.540> to

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
actually seen what how much you need to

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.920 
actually seen what how much you need to
take<00:01:54.960> off<00:01:55.170> after<00:01:55.649> that<00:01:55.860> point<00:01:56.189> well<00:01:57.000> I<00:01:57.329> see<00:01:57.899> I

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
take off after that point well I see I

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.300 
take off after that point well I see I
didn't<00:01:58.200> know<00:01:58.259> there<00:01:58.439> was<00:01:58.500> different<00:01:58.860> versions

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
didn't know there was different versions

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.490 
didn't know there was different versions
of<00:01:59.460> the<00:01:59.640> belt<00:01:59.880> or<00:02:00.030> upper<00:02:00.360> well<00:02:01.110> I<00:02:01.140> mean<00:02:01.320> there

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
of the belt or upper well I mean there

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.230 
of the belt or upper well I mean there
was<00:02:01.590> two<00:02:02.189> versions<00:02:02.579> that<00:02:02.640> I<00:02:02.729> know<00:02:02.820> of<00:02:02.939> but<00:02:03.060> I

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
was two versions that I know of but I

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.060 
was two versions that I know of but I
know<00:02:03.360> they<00:02:03.630> made<00:02:03.780> differences<00:02:04.290> between<00:02:04.500> I

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
know they made differences between I

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.980 
know they made differences between I
guess<00:02:05.820> generations<00:02:06.390> or<00:02:06.600> version<00:02:07.049> so

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990 
guess generations or version so

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.610 
guess generations or version so
you<00:02:08.410> can<00:02:08.560> see<00:02:08.739> his<00:02:08.920> this<00:02:09.069> a<00:02:10.290> squared<00:02:11.290> all<00:02:11.500> the

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
you can see his this a squared all the

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.680 
you can see his this a squared all the
way<00:02:11.709> to<00:02:11.770> the<00:02:11.980> front<00:02:12.160> this<00:02:13.000> one<00:02:13.150> over<00:02:13.420> here<00:02:13.450> is

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
way to the front this one over here is

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:19.290 
way to the front this one over here is
rounded<00:02:15.120> like<00:02:16.120> a<00:02:16.150> regular<00:02:17.760> mil-spec<00:02:18.760> upper

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
rounded like a regular mil-spec upper

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.979
