three hours of searching success team
right<00:00:59.190> there<00:00:59.340> look<00:01:00.329> at<00:01:00.390> that<00:01:00.500> it<00:01:01.500> may<00:01:01.739> only<00:01:01.890> be

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
right there look at that it may only be

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.609 
right there look at that it may only be
a<00:01:02.370> fairly<00:01:02.730> small<00:01:03.210> Python<00:01:03.539> but<00:01:04.260> it<00:01:04.350> shows<00:01:04.589> just

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
a fairly small Python but it shows just

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.270 
a fairly small Python but it shows just
how<00:01:05.100> relatively<00:01:05.610> easy<00:01:06.119> they<00:01:06.420> are<00:01:06.450> to<00:01:06.630> find

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280

how relatively easy they are to find
what's<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.430> approach<00:01:08.790> -<00:01:09.710> you'll<00:01:10.710> see<00:01:10.979> see<00:01:11.460> now

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
what's the approach - you'll see see now

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.310 
what's the approach - you'll see see now
starts<00:01:11.970> to<00:01:12.030> back<00:01:12.240> off<00:01:12.510> because<00:01:12.720> it's<00:01:13.020> aware

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
starts to back off because it's aware

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.910 
starts to back off because it's aware
I'm<00:01:13.500> here<00:01:13.830> it<00:01:14.159> seized<00:01:14.729> me<00:01:14.939> as<00:01:15.060> spells<00:01:15.360> me<00:01:15.630> so<00:01:15.920> it

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
I'm here it seized me as spells me so it

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.010 
I'm here it seized me as spells me so it
backs<00:01:17.159> off<00:01:17.400> a<00:01:17.430> little<00:01:17.700> bit<00:01:17.909> but<00:01:18.299> even<00:01:18.330> even<00:01:18.869> now

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
backs off a little bit but even even now

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.620 
backs off a little bit but even even now
you<00:01:19.259> know<00:01:19.380> he's<00:01:19.500> hissed<00:01:19.710> a<00:01:19.860> little<00:01:20.100> bit<00:01:20.630> but

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
you know he's hissed a little bit but
