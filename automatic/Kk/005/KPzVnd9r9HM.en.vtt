00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:08.100
 August is the time of picking apples and pumping honey 

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:11.550
 long-awaited moment in the work of everyone 

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:13.680
 beekeeper especially beginners can 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.580
 to pump out honey specialized 

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:19.949
 rooms and fitted wagons 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:23.910
 You can take the frame home and pump it to 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:27.119
 cube but the most convenient and fastest to do 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.019
 it's right on the puzzle no matter the stationary 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.499
 or migrations 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:35.610
 one problem is how to bees and wasps 

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:38.340
 hops attracted by the smell of fresh honey 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.550
 they soon gathered around and 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:44.250
 just paralyzing all the work we are on 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:47.540
 apiary or stockings pump honey without 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:51.330
 problems now demonstrate how 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:56.190
 create a room for pumping honey right 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:59.660
 on this clearing 1 we stick in the ground tube 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:03.030
 which will hold the lid in her 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:07.189
 insert and fix the clamp large 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:10.799
 beach umbrella height adjustable 

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:13.939
 open the umbrella bring the usual 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:16.969
 mesh cape canopy with ring 

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:21.149
 throwing a ring on top of an umbrella 

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:23.700
 we lower the edges of the grid down and press to 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:27.450
 earth a few pebbles without any 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:30.740
 stretch marks or pegs stowed room 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:34.079
 ready for honey pumping or relaxing 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.700
 inside we set a folding table about 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.679
 which spoke in one of the previous 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.780
 plots 

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:42.090
 stand under the case of the honey extractor capacity 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.600
 for honey and while resting inflatable 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.490
 furniture 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:50.090
 the grid reliably protects from mosquitoes 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:53.429
 also fast construction and disassembled 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:55.189
 cheap light spacious comfortable 

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:58.380
 compact during transportation and storage 

00:01:55.189 --> 00:02:00.990
 a set of two products allows 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:04.469
 perform work on the apiary without 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:08.110
 it is not so easy to carry out and that's 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:15.960
 it turns out that there would be honey 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:15.960
 bled easily settled via umbrella
