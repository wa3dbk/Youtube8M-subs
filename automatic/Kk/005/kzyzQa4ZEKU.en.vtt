00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:25.940 
think you know normally with this deck I
wouldn't<00:01:24.960> block<00:01:25.080> with<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.320> token<00:01:25.650> but<00:01:25.799> since

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
wouldn't block with the token but since

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.200 
wouldn't block with the token but since
he's<00:01:26.130> decided<00:01:26.640> that<00:01:26.759> he's<00:01:26.880> going<00:01:27.000> to<00:01:27.060> throw

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
he's decided that he's going to throw

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.300 
he's decided that he's going to throw
burn<00:01:27.509> spells<00:01:27.780> at<00:01:27.960> me<00:01:28.080> like<00:01:28.200> that<00:01:28.409> or<00:01:28.590> pump

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
burn spells at me like that or pump

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.060 
burn spells at me like that or pump
spells<00:01:29.579> at<00:01:29.700> my<00:01:29.790> face<00:01:30.000> I<00:01:30.180> might<00:01:30.710> I'm<00:01:31.710> like<00:01:31.860> block

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
spells at my face I might I'm like block

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.460 
spells at my face I might I'm like block
we'll<00:01:32.310> see<00:01:32.460> what<00:01:32.579> happens<00:01:32.670> is<00:01:32.970> he<00:01:33.030> coming<00:01:33.470> no

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
we'll see what happens is he coming no

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.190 
we'll see what happens is he coming no
he's<00:01:34.710> going<00:01:34.890> to<00:01:34.950> take<00:01:35.070> a<00:01:35.130> turn<00:01:35.310> off<00:01:35.659> so<00:01:36.659> I<00:01:37.079> think

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
he's going to take a turn off so I think

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.560 
he's going to take a turn off so I think
like<00:01:37.770> I<00:01:37.890> said<00:01:38.100> that<00:01:38.400> the<00:01:38.640> turn<00:01:38.790> 3<00:01:39.030> play<00:01:39.240> here<00:01:39.479> is

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
like I said that the turn 3 play here is

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.480 
like I said that the turn 3 play here is
most<00:01:40.079> assuredly<00:01:40.229> rabble<00:01:40.860> master<00:01:41.189> and<00:01:41.340> let's

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
most assuredly rabble master and let's

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:42.980 
most assuredly rabble master and let's
try<00:01:41.790> to<00:01:41.820> win<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.119> game<00:01:42.150> with<00:01:42.390> goblin<00:01:42.659> tokens

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
try to win the game with goblin tokens

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.440 
try to win the game with goblin tokens
because<00:01:43.140> he's<00:01:43.290> missed<00:01:43.500> his<00:01:43.560> tool<00:01:43.740> and<00:01:43.920> drops

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
because he's missed his tool and drops

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.819 
because he's missed his tool and drops
so<00:01:45.450> pioner<00:01:45.750> gets<00:01:45.960> you<00:01:46.079> to<00:01:46.259> put<00:01:46.380> one<00:01:46.500> into<00:01:46.619> play

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
so pioner gets you to put one into play

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.200 
so pioner gets you to put one into play
but<00:01:46.979> it<00:01:47.100> doesn't<00:01:47.280> get<00:01:47.369> one<00:01:47.490> into<00:01:47.640> your<00:01:47.729> hand<00:01:47.939> so

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
but it doesn't get one into your hand so

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.490 
but it doesn't get one into your hand so
I<00:01:48.240> mean<00:01:48.509> it<00:01:48.659> really<00:01:48.689> just<00:01:49.020> puts<00:01:49.229> you<00:01:49.290> down<00:01:49.320> a

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
I mean it really just puts you down a

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.160 
I mean it really just puts you down a
card<00:01:49.880> so<00:01:50.880> I<00:01:50.909> really<00:01:51.210> really<00:01:51.509> don't<00:01:51.600> like<00:01:51.720> it<00:01:51.960> so

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
card so I really really don't like it so

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.280

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:19.260 
out for the arbor Colossus okay that can
block<00:03:18.130> the<00:03:18.280> Flyers<00:03:18.520> to<00:03:18.640> tell<00:03:18.880> her<00:03:19.000> it<00:03:19.090> makes

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:19.270 
block the Flyers to tell her it makes

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:20.640 
block the Flyers to tell her it makes
but<00:03:19.510> it<00:03:19.600> can't<00:03:19.750> block<00:03:19.930> all<00:03:20.080> the<00:03:20.110> goblins<00:03:20.530> it's
