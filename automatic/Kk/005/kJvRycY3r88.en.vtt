are loose it's it's the fabric is kind
of<00:00:32.290> fraying<00:00:32.830> and<00:00:33.160> coming<00:00:33.879> away<00:00:34.090> from<00:00:34.120> the

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:34.570 
of fraying and coming away from the

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:36.420 
of fraying and coming away from the
grommets<00:00:35.050> and<00:00:35.199> also<00:00:35.739> I've<00:00:35.860> had<00:00:36.100> one<00:00:36.309> that

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:36.430 
grommets and also I've had one that

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:39.180 
grommets and also I've had one that
already<00:00:36.850> popped<00:00:37.150> out<00:00:37.390> here<00:00:37.629> so<00:00:38.020> um<00:00:38.350> what<00:00:39.160> I

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:39.190 
already popped out here so um what I

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.360 
already popped out here so um what I
could<00:00:39.489> do<00:00:39.670> is<00:00:39.850> I<00:00:40.449> could<00:00:40.570> simply<00:00:41.410> replace<00:00:41.860> just

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:42.370 
could do is I could simply replace just

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:45.080 
could do is I could simply replace just
the<00:00:42.430> one<00:00:42.700> grommet<00:00:43.120> but<00:00:43.600> really<00:00:43.960> I'm<00:00:44.170> going<00:00:44.470> to

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
the one grommet but really I'm going to

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.280 
the one grommet but really I'm going to
change<00:00:46.090> the<00:00:46.210> whole<00:00:46.360> thing<00:00:46.570> one<00:00:46.870> because<00:00:47.260> I

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:47.290 
change the whole thing one because I

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:48.959 
change the whole thing one because I
don't<00:00:47.440> have<00:00:47.649> any<00:00:47.860> grommets<00:00:48.280> that<00:00:48.340> match<00:00:48.730> this

00:00:48.959 --> 00:00:48.969 
don't have any grommets that match this

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:50.760 
don't have any grommets that match this
one<00:00:49.180> and<00:00:49.450> I<00:00:49.540> want<00:00:49.780> it<00:00:49.870> all<00:00:49.960> to<00:00:50.140> look<00:00:50.260> congruent

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:50.770 
one and I want it all to look congruent

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:54.420 
one and I want it all to look congruent
and<00:00:51.059> secondly<00:00:52.350> I<00:00:53.350> want<00:00:53.860> to<00:00:53.920> be<00:00:54.100> able<00:00:54.190> to

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:54.430 
and secondly I want to be able to

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:58.069 
and secondly I want to be able to

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
reinforce this last panel here so that

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.360 
reinforce this last panel here so that
the<00:00:59.079> grommets<00:00:59.440> aren't<00:00:59.770> going<00:00:59.950> to<00:01:00.040> pull<00:01:00.219> up

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:00.370 
the grommets aren't going to pull up

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:02.850 
the grommets aren't going to pull up
again<00:01:00.790> in<00:01:00.940> the<00:01:01.030> future<00:01:01.420> so<00:01:02.289> the<00:01:02.500> first<00:01:02.710> method

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:02.860 
again in the future so the first method

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:06.850 
using a normal pair of pliers now mine

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.150 
using a normal pair of pliers now mine
has<00:01:07.060> a<00:01:07.270> bent<00:01:07.810> nose<00:01:08.080> you<00:01:08.320> don't<00:01:08.500> really<00:01:08.619> need<00:01:08.920> a

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:09.160 
has a bent nose you don't really need a

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.340 
has a bent nose you don't really need a
bent<00:01:09.369> nose<00:01:09.580> you<00:01:09.759> can<00:01:09.820> use<00:01:10.060> any<00:01:10.360> wires<00:01:10.930> you<00:01:11.170> want

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:11.350 
bent nose you can use any wires you want

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.190 
bent nose you can use any wires you want
as<00:01:11.530> long<00:01:11.560> as<00:01:11.890> the<00:01:12.009> tip<00:01:12.190> is<00:01:12.340> small<00:01:13.060> enough<00:01:13.210> so

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:14.200 
as long as the tip is small enough so

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.309 
as long as the tip is small enough so
any<00:01:14.619> sort<00:01:14.860> of<00:01:14.950> needle<00:01:15.399> nose<00:01:15.550> pliers<00:01:15.580> I<00:01:16.319> just

00:01:17.309 --> 00:01:17.319 
any sort of needle nose pliers I just

00:01:17.319 --> 00:01:18.240 
any sort of needle nose pliers I just
find<00:01:17.470> these<00:01:17.560> ones<00:01:17.770> a<00:01:17.830> little<00:01:18.009> bit<00:01:18.100> more

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.250 
find these ones a little bit more

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.359 
find these ones a little bit more
ergonomic<00:01:18.819> so<00:01:19.479> this<00:01:20.110> is<00:01:20.289> the<00:01:20.470> basically<00:01:21.190> the

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:21.369 
ergonomic so this is the basically the

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:23.609 
ergonomic so this is the basically the
front<00:01:21.640> and<00:01:21.970> here's<00:01:22.569> the<00:01:22.720> back<00:01:22.899> of<00:01:23.170> the<00:01:23.259> grommet

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:23.619 
front and here's the back of the grommet

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:25.199 
front and here's the back of the grommet
and<00:01:23.709> you<00:01:24.069> can<00:01:24.220> see<00:01:24.340> the<00:01:24.520> back<00:01:24.670> of<00:01:24.819> the<00:01:24.880> grommet

00:01:25.199 --> 00:01:25.209 
and you can see the back of the grommet

00:01:25.209 --> 00:01:27.300 
and you can see the back of the grommet
is<00:01:25.360> where<00:01:25.569> the<00:01:25.750> top<00:01:25.959> hat<00:01:26.259> part<00:01:26.649> of<00:01:26.860> the<00:01:26.979> grommet

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:27.310 
is where the top hat part of the grommet

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:29.999 
is where the top hat part of the grommet
had<00:01:27.729> curled<00:01:28.209> around<00:01:28.390> overtop<00:01:29.349> of<00:01:29.380> the<00:01:29.590> washer

00:01:29.999 --> 00:01:30.009 
had curled around overtop of the washer

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:31.410 
had curled around overtop of the washer
and<00:01:30.160> that's<00:01:30.280> what's<00:01:30.490> holding<00:01:30.789> it<00:01:30.849> in<00:01:31.000> place<00:01:31.119> so

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:31.420 
and that's what's holding it in place so

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.440 
and that's what's holding it in place so
what<00:01:32.050> you<00:01:32.170> want<00:01:32.380> to<00:01:32.500> do<00:01:32.679> is<00:01:32.860> basically<00:01:33.459> grab

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 
what you want to do is basically grab

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.880 
what you want to do is basically grab
hold<00:01:34.720> of<00:01:35.140> where<00:01:35.470> that<00:01:36.899> that<00:01:37.899> top<00:01:38.259> hat<00:01:38.530> part<00:01:38.770> of

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890 
hold of where that that top hat part of

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.040 
hold of where that that top hat part of
the<00:01:38.950> grommet<00:01:39.369> was<00:01:39.819> curled<00:01:40.179> over<00:01:40.360> and<00:01:40.750> start

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:41.050 
the grommet was curled over and start

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.339 
the grommet was curled over and start
bending<00:01:41.289> it<00:01:41.590> back<00:01:41.890> in<00:01:42.220> towards<00:01:43.179> the<00:01:43.240> hole<00:01:43.599> so

00:01:44.339 --> 00:01:44.349 
bending it back in towards the hole so

00:01:44.349 --> 00:01:46.290 
bending it back in towards the hole so
you<00:01:44.830> don't<00:01:44.979> have<00:01:45.190> to<00:01:45.340> be<00:01:45.459> neat<00:01:45.700> about<00:01:45.880> this

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:46.300 
you don't have to be neat about this

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.080 
you don't have to be neat about this
you're<00:01:47.130> basically<00:01:48.130> what<00:01:48.700> you're<00:01:48.819> going<00:01:49.060> for

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090 
you're basically what you're going for

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.230 
you're basically what you're going for
is<00:01:49.509> to<00:01:49.869> make<00:01:50.200> it<00:01:51.160> smaller<00:01:51.520> than<00:01:51.819> the<00:01:52.000> hole

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
is to make it smaller than the hole

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:57.990 
is to make it smaller than the hole
itself<00:01:52.869> and<00:01:53.849> keep<00:01:54.849> bending<00:01:55.209> it<00:01:55.300> back<00:01:56.849> and<00:01:57.849> this

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 
itself and keep bending it back and this

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.460 
itself and keep bending it back and this
is<00:01:58.060> basically<00:01:58.690> just<00:01:59.110> the<00:01:59.289> most

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470 
is basically just the most

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.270 
is basically just the most
straightforward<00:01:59.920> way<00:02:00.340> and<00:02:01.920> once<00:02:02.920> you<00:02:03.039> get<00:02:03.160> it

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
straightforward way and once you get it

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.729 
straightforward way and once you get it
like<00:02:03.429> that<00:02:03.610> you<00:02:03.819> can<00:02:03.849> also<00:02:04.149> take<00:02:04.959> hold<00:02:05.289> of<00:02:05.530> it

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:05.739 
like that you can also take hold of it

00:02:05.739 --> 00:02:08.400 
like that you can also take hold of it
on<00:02:05.920> both<00:02:06.310> sides<00:02:06.369> with<00:02:07.030> the<00:02:07.119> pliers<00:02:07.360> and<00:02:07.690> try<00:02:08.349> to

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 
on both sides with the pliers and try to

on both sides with the pliers and try to
pinch<00:02:08.739> it<00:02:08.890> inwards<00:02:09.280> if<00:02:09.550> there<00:02:09.880> is<00:02:10.060> enough

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
pinch it inwards if there is enough

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.620 
pinch it inwards if there is enough
metal<00:02:12.250> for<00:02:12.610> you<00:02:12.760> to<00:02:12.880> be<00:02:13.000> able<00:02:13.120> to<00:02:13.239> do<00:02:13.450> that

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
metal for you to be able to do that

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.440 
metal for you to be able to do that
right<00:02:14.020> here<00:02:14.380> it<00:02:14.620> seems<00:02:14.950> that<00:02:15.209> this<00:02:16.209> particular

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
right here it seems that this particular

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.959 
right here it seems that this particular
grommet<00:02:17.080> doesn't<00:02:17.349> have<00:02:17.500> enough<00:02:17.770> metal<00:02:18.670> for<00:02:18.879> me

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:18.969 
grommet doesn't have enough metal for me

00:02:18.969 --> 00:02:20.580 
grommet doesn't have enough metal for me
to<00:02:19.060> be<00:02:19.180> able<00:02:19.269> to<00:02:19.480> do<00:02:19.599> that<00:02:19.810> but<00:02:20.019> if<00:02:20.200> you<00:02:20.409> are

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
to be able to do that but if you are

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.619 
to be able to do that but if you are
able<00:02:20.829> to<00:02:20.860> that's<00:02:21.610> a<00:02:21.700> really<00:02:21.909> easy<00:02:21.939> way<00:02:22.209> to<00:02:22.390> just

00:02:22.619 --> 00:02:22.629 
able to that's a really easy way to just

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:23.270 
able to that's a really easy way to just
kind<00:02:22.780> of

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
kind of

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.370 
kind of
crunch<00:02:23.490> it<00:02:23.640> all<00:02:23.760> together<00:02:24.330> once<00:02:25.140> it<00:02:25.260> gets

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
crunch it all together once it gets

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.830 
crunch it all together once it gets
small<00:02:25.800> enough<00:02:26.100> then<00:02:26.400> it<00:02:26.700> should<00:02:26.910> be<00:02:26.940> you

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
small enough then it should be you

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.820 
small enough then it should be you
should<00:02:27.870> be<00:02:28.140> able<00:02:28.290> to<00:02:28.590> simply<00:02:29.459> take<00:02:29.910> out<00:02:30.120> the

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
should be able to simply take out the

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:39.050 
should be able to simply take out the
washer<00:02:33.740> just<00:02:34.740> like<00:02:34.980> that<00:02:35.540> and<00:02:37.190> then<00:02:38.190> the<00:02:38.790> rest

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
washer just like that and then the rest

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.850 
washer just like that and then the rest
of<00:02:39.180> the<00:02:39.330> grommet<00:02:40.050> should<00:02:40.470> just<00:02:40.650> come<00:02:40.830> through

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
of the grommet should just come through

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.800 
of the grommet should just come through
the<00:02:41.069> hole<00:02:41.250> like<00:02:41.400> that<00:02:41.430> and<00:02:41.819> you<00:02:42.239> see<00:02:42.420> how<00:02:42.569> that

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
the hole like that and you see how that

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.620 
the hole like that and you see how that
is<00:02:42.840> a<00:02:43.350> pretty<00:02:44.280> clean<00:02:44.550> hole<00:02:44.790> right<00:02:44.970> there<00:02:45.030> so

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
is a pretty clean hole right there so

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.210 
is a pretty clean hole right there so
that<00:02:45.989> shouldn't<00:02:46.319> have<00:02:46.440> stretched<00:02:46.770> too<00:02:47.069> much

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
that shouldn't have stretched too much

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:48.530 
that shouldn't have stretched too much
or<00:02:47.430> been<00:02:47.580> too<00:02:47.760> damaged<00:02:48.150> while<00:02:48.360> you<00:02:48.480> were

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
or been too damaged while you were

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.390 
or been too damaged while you were
taking<00:02:48.840> out<00:02:48.900> the<00:02:49.050> grommet<00:02:49.350> and<00:02:49.530> this<00:02:50.069> next<00:02:50.280> way

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
taking out the grommet and this next way

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:51.770 
taking out the grommet and this next way
that<00:02:50.550> I'm<00:02:50.640> going<00:02:50.819> to<00:02:50.880> take<00:02:51.060> out<00:02:51.209> a<00:02:51.239> grommet<00:02:51.600> is

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
that I'm going to take out a grommet is

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.660 
that I'm going to take out a grommet is
actually<00:02:52.500> using<00:02:52.950> a<00:02:53.040> pair<00:02:53.250> of<00:02:53.400> wire<00:02:53.640> cutters

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
actually using a pair of wire cutters

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.610 
actually using a pair of wire cutters
that<00:02:54.300> you<00:02:54.420> can<00:02:54.540> see<00:02:54.690> that<00:02:54.780> these<00:02:54.930> wire<00:02:55.170> cutters

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
that you can see that these wire cutters

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.560 
that you can see that these wire cutters
they're<00:02:56.040> deep<00:02:56.340> in<00:02:56.489> one<00:02:56.700> side<00:02:57.030> and<00:02:57.060> then

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
they're deep in one side and then

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:59.390 
they're deep in one side and then
they're<00:02:57.840> pretty<00:02:58.080> much<00:02:58.200> flat<00:02:58.920> on<00:02:59.130> the<00:02:59.250> other

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
they're pretty much flat on the other

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.820 
they're pretty much flat on the other
side<00:02:59.640> so<00:02:59.820> I'm<00:03:00.000> using<00:03:00.209> that<00:03:00.360> flat<00:03:00.840> edge<00:03:01.080> to<00:03:01.709> be

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
side so I'm using that flat edge to be

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:05.360 
side so I'm using that flat edge to be
able<00:03:01.920> to<00:03:02.269> grab<00:03:03.269> onto<00:03:03.540> that<00:03:03.840> little<00:03:04.500> curved<00:03:04.860> top

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
able to grab onto that little curved top

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.790 
able to grab onto that little curved top
part<00:03:05.640> of<00:03:05.700> it<00:03:05.820> now<00:03:06.239> this<00:03:06.540> works<00:03:06.750> best<00:03:07.050> if<00:03:07.320> that

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 
part of it now this works best if that

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.430 
part of it now this works best if that
little<00:03:08.330> curved<00:03:09.330> part<00:03:09.690> of<00:03:09.750> the<00:03:09.840> top<00:03:10.019> hat<00:03:10.230> and

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
little curved part of the top hat and

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.259 
little curved part of the top hat and
the<00:03:10.530> back<00:03:10.680> of<00:03:10.860> the<00:03:10.980> grommet<00:03:11.610> is<00:03:11.790> quite

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269 
the back of the grommet is quite

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:13.970 
the back of the grommet is quite
prominent<00:03:12.750> that<00:03:13.019> you<00:03:13.080> can<00:03:13.260> actually<00:03:13.410> grab<00:03:13.800> on

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
prominent that you can actually grab on

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.250 
prominent that you can actually grab on
to<00:03:14.160> it<00:03:14.190> pretty<00:03:14.370> well<00:03:14.630> I've<00:03:15.630> already<00:03:15.930> removed

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
to it pretty well I've already removed

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.410 
to it pretty well I've already removed
the<00:03:16.500> washer<00:03:16.950> just<00:03:17.519> so<00:03:17.850> that<00:03:18.120> you<00:03:18.180> won't<00:03:18.360> be

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
the washer just so that you won't be

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.770 
the washer just so that you won't be
confused<00:03:18.900> that<00:03:19.769> I'm<00:03:19.980> working<00:03:20.519> with

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
confused that I'm working with

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.390 
confused that I'm working with
technically<00:03:21.780> that<00:03:22.140> top<00:03:22.709> portion<00:03:23.190> of<00:03:23.280> the

technically that top portion of the

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.699

grommet not the bottom portion and what

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:30.229 
grommet not the bottom portion and what
you<00:03:25.800> want<00:03:25.980> to<00:03:26.040> do<00:03:26.190> is<00:03:26.810> try<00:03:27.810> and<00:03:28.019> get<00:03:29.239> this

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
you want to do is try and get this

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:34.130 
you want to do is try and get this

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:41.420 
with the wire cutters all the way around

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:45.470 
with the wire cutters all the way around
cutting<00:03:42.420> off<00:03:42.630> that<00:03:43.049> curved<00:03:43.860> part<00:03:44.220> if<00:03:44.549> you<00:03:45.209> can

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
cutting off that curved part if you can

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.860 
cutting off that curved part if you can
and<00:03:46.070> the<00:03:47.070> rest<00:03:47.310> of<00:03:47.579> the<00:03:48.030> grommet<00:03:48.450> is<00:03:48.570> smaller

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:50.330 
and the rest of the grommet is smaller
than<00:03:49.049> the<00:03:49.170> hole<00:03:49.380> and<00:03:49.620> it<00:03:49.709> should<00:03:49.890> fall<00:03:50.100> right

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
than the hole and it should fall right

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.400 
than the hole and it should fall right
through<00:03:50.370> the<00:03:50.750> washer<00:03:51.750> should<00:03:51.870> come<00:03:52.049> off<00:03:52.200> on

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410 
through the washer should come off on

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:54.229 
through the washer should come off on
the<00:03:52.500> other<00:03:52.650> side<00:03:52.980> of<00:03:53.310> the<00:03:53.400> washer<00:03:53.730> is<00:03:53.820> still<00:03:54.060> on

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
the other side of the washer is still on

the other side of the washer is still on
as<00:03:54.359> well<00:03:54.620> all<00:03:55.620> right<00:03:55.769> and<00:03:55.950> if<00:03:56.070> you<00:03:56.160> can<00:03:56.310> imagine

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:56.519 
as well all right and if you can imagine

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:58.550 
as well all right and if you can imagine
that<00:03:56.760> my<00:03:57.000> wire<00:03:57.209> cutters<00:03:57.239> were<00:03:57.870> sharp<00:03:58.320> enough

that my wire cutters were sharp enough

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.410 
that my wire cutters were sharp enough
to<00:03:58.620> be<00:03:59.130> able<00:03:59.220> to<00:03:59.370> just<00:03:59.760> nibble<00:04:00.030> all<00:04:00.180> the<00:04:00.329> way

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
to be able to just nibble all the way

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:02.479 
to be able to just nibble all the way
around<00:04:00.750> there<00:04:01.019> then<00:04:01.350> all<00:04:01.590> you<00:04:01.739> have<00:04:01.920> left<00:04:02.190> is

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:02.489 
around there then all you have left is

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:04.610 
around there then all you have left is
that<00:04:03.120> part<00:04:03.570> of<00:04:03.630> the<00:04:03.690> top<00:04:03.870> hat<00:04:04.079> that<00:04:04.260> wasn't

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
that part of the top hat that wasn't

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.500 
that part of the top hat that wasn't
curved<00:04:04.920> over<00:04:05.160> the<00:04:05.250> back<00:04:05.430> part<00:04:05.760> so<00:04:05.880> it<00:04:06.269> should

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
curved over the back part so it should

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:10.900 
curved over the back part so it should
be<00:04:06.660> able<00:04:06.840> to<00:04:07.140> simply<00:04:07.590> slip<00:04:08.340> right<00:04:08.549> out<00:04:08.609> and

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:10.910 
be able to simply slip right out and

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:13.910 
be able to simply slip right out and
sometimes<00:04:11.910> if<00:04:12.600> there's<00:04:12.900> a<00:04:12.959> raw<00:04:13.170> edge<00:04:13.410> like<00:04:13.799> you

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920 
sometimes if there's a raw edge like you

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.250 
sometimes if there's a raw edge like you
see<00:04:14.100> here<00:04:14.400> then<00:04:14.609> it<00:04:14.850> can<00:04:15.060> catch<00:04:15.810> onto<00:04:16.169> the

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
see here then it can catch onto the

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.920 
see here then it can catch onto the
fabric<00:04:16.470> so<00:04:16.859> just<00:04:17.039> very<00:04:17.340> very<00:04:17.640> carefully<00:04:18.180> try

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
fabric so just very very carefully try

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.580 
fabric so just very very carefully try
to<00:04:18.989> wiggle<00:04:19.229> yourself<00:04:19.470> out<00:04:19.859> of<00:04:19.979> there<00:04:20.160> and

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590 
to wiggle yourself out of there and

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:25.520 
to wiggle yourself out of there and
damage<00:04:22.940> the<00:04:23.940> least<00:04:24.150> amount<00:04:24.390> of<00:04:24.539> fabric<00:04:25.410> as

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
damage the least amount of fabric as

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:27.350 
damage the least amount of fabric as
possible

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
possible

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.480 
possible
now<00:04:28.050> I<00:04:28.110> have<00:04:28.379> heard<00:04:28.530> of<00:04:28.650> a<00:04:28.740> few<00:04:28.889> other<00:04:29.069> methods

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490 
now I have heard of a few other methods

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:32.629 
now I have heard of a few other methods
of<00:04:29.900> removing<00:04:30.900> grommets<00:04:31.289> for<00:04:31.500> instance<00:04:31.919> using

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:32.639 
of removing grommets for instance using

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:34.760 
of removing grommets for instance using
a<00:04:32.849> drill<00:04:33.090> bit<00:04:33.270> like<00:04:33.539> that<00:04:33.569> like<00:04:34.139> so<00:04:34.379> this<00:04:34.590> is<00:04:34.740> a

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:34.770 
a drill bit like that like so this is a

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:36.950 
a drill bit like that like so this is a
bit<00:04:34.979> that<00:04:35.189> it<00:04:36.150> technically<00:04:36.539> bores<00:04:36.810> a<00:04:36.840> hole

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 
bit that it technically bores a hole

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.230 
bit that it technically bores a hole
into<00:04:37.289> a<00:04:37.409> wood<00:04:37.680> before<00:04:38.069> you<00:04:38.430> put<00:04:38.759> in<00:04:38.909> this<00:04:39.030> group

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 
into a wood before you put in this group

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.629 
into a wood before you put in this group
and<00:04:39.389> so<00:04:40.020> what<00:04:40.560> some<00:04:40.680> people<00:04:40.830> do<00:04:41.099> it<00:04:41.400> might<00:04:41.550> be

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:41.639 
and so what some people do it might be

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:43.189 
and so what some people do it might be
easier<00:04:41.909> to<00:04:42.060> use<00:04:42.090> a<00:04:42.210> countersink<00:04:42.810> drill<00:04:42.900> bit

00:04:43.189 --> 00:04:43.199 
easier to use a countersink drill bit

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:45.890 
easier to use a countersink drill bit
because<00:04:43.740> it<00:04:44.159> it<00:04:44.699> goes<00:04:44.879> from<00:04:45.030> narrower<00:04:45.599> to

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900 
because it it goes from narrower to

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:49.659 
because it it goes from narrower to
wider<00:04:46.680> its<00:04:47.039> tapered<00:04:47.340> so<00:04:48.090> that<00:04:48.419> you're<00:04:49.319> able<00:04:49.620> to

00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:49.669 
wider its tapered so that you're able to

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:52.369 
wider its tapered so that you're able to
put<00:04:50.669> the<00:04:51.030> skinnier<00:04:51.509> part<00:04:51.750> in<00:04:51.930> the<00:04:52.020> middle<00:04:52.259> of

00:04:52.369 --> 00:04:52.379 
put the skinnier part in the middle of

00:04:52.379 --> 00:04:55.459 
put the skinnier part in the middle of
the<00:04:53.340> hole<00:04:53.610> of<00:04:53.879> the<00:04:53.969> grommet<00:04:54.360> and<00:04:54.509> then<00:04:55.080> the

00:04:55.459 --> 00:04:55.469 
the hole of the grommet and then the

00:04:55.469 --> 00:04:57.559 
the hole of the grommet and then the
water<00:04:55.740> pipe<00:04:56.009> would<00:04:56.129> sit<00:04:56.460> on<00:04:56.699> top<00:04:57.090> of<00:04:57.150> this<00:04:57.330> so

00:04:57.559 --> 00:04:57.569 
water pipe would sit on top of this so

00:04:57.569 --> 00:04:59.270 
water pipe would sit on top of this so
this<00:04:57.719> is<00:04:57.870> still<00:04:58.289> the<00:04:58.409> back<00:04:58.560> of<00:04:58.710> the<00:04:58.770> corset<00:04:59.159> and

00:04:59.270 --> 00:04:59.280 
this is still the back of the corset and

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:01.369 
this is still the back of the corset and
what<00:04:59.849> you<00:04:59.909> want<00:05:00.090> to<00:05:00.150> do<00:05:00.300> is<00:05:00.479> just<00:05:00.960> very<00:05:01.289> very

00:05:01.369 --> 00:05:01.379 
what you want to do is just very very

00:05:01.379 --> 00:05:05.659 
what you want to do is just very very
lightly<00:05:02.330> place<00:05:03.330> the<00:05:03.539> end<00:05:03.690> of<00:05:03.990> that<00:05:04.139> bit<00:05:04.409> on<00:05:04.710> the

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:05.669 
lightly place the end of that bit on the

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:07.339 
lightly place the end of that bit on the
back<00:05:05.849> of<00:05:06.120> the<00:05:06.240> grommet<00:05:06.599> and<00:05:06.719> when<00:05:06.900> you<00:05:06.990> spin<00:05:07.319> it

00:05:07.339 --> 00:05:07.349 
back of the grommet and when you spin it

00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:10.939 
back of the grommet and when you spin it
then<00:05:07.919> it's<00:05:08.669> going<00:05:08.879> to<00:05:09.060> wear<00:05:09.509> away<00:05:09.810> that<00:05:10.379> little

00:05:10.939 --> 00:05:10.949 
then it's going to wear away that little

00:05:10.949 --> 00:05:13.219 
then it's going to wear away that little
curved<00:05:11.490> part<00:05:11.909> that's<00:05:12.360> holding<00:05:12.719> the<00:05:12.810> washer<00:05:13.110> in

00:05:13.219 --> 00:05:13.229 
curved part that's holding the washer in

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:15.020 
curved part that's holding the washer in
place<00:05:13.259> so<00:05:13.620> once<00:05:13.800> that's<00:05:13.919> worn<00:05:14.250> away<00:05:14.370> the

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:15.030 
place so once that's worn away the

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:16.610 
place so once that's worn away the
washer<00:05:15.360> should<00:05:15.509> be<00:05:15.659> able<00:05:15.750> to<00:05:15.930> pop<00:05:16.110> off<00:05:16.349> and

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:16.620 
washer should be able to pop off and

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:18.020 
washer should be able to pop off and
everything<00:05:16.949> should<00:05:17.219> come<00:05:17.280> apart<00:05:17.759> quite

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:18.030 
everything should come apart quite

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:20.809 
everything should come apart quite
cleanly<00:05:18.360> however<00:05:19.259> if<00:05:19.620> you<00:05:20.099> have<00:05:20.340> loose

00:05:20.809 --> 00:05:20.819 
cleanly however if you have loose

00:05:20.819 --> 00:05:22.999 
cleanly however if you have loose
grommets<00:05:21.419> that<00:05:21.990> is<00:05:22.289> not<00:05:22.500> going<00:05:22.710> to<00:05:22.800> work<00:05:22.979> very

00:05:22.999 --> 00:05:23.009 
grommets that is not going to work very

00:05:23.009 --> 00:05:26.450 
grommets that is not going to work very
well<00:05:23.340> unless<00:05:24.000> you<00:05:24.180> have<00:05:24.330> a<00:05:24.360> way<00:05:24.569> to<00:05:24.599> just<00:05:25.460> hold

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:26.460 
well unless you have a way to just hold

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:28.399 
well unless you have a way to just hold
the<00:05:26.669> the<00:05:27.479> rest<00:05:27.689> of<00:05:27.810> the<00:05:27.870> grommet<00:05:28.110> in<00:05:28.199> place

00:05:28.399 --> 00:05:28.409 
the the rest of the grommet in place

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:30.649 
the the rest of the grommet in place
because<00:05:28.979> what<00:05:29.129> I've<00:05:29.279> found<00:05:29.550> is<00:05:29.819> when<00:05:30.090> you<00:05:30.449> put

00:05:30.649 --> 00:05:30.659 
because what I've found is when you put

00:05:30.659 --> 00:05:32.719 
because what I've found is when you put
pressure<00:05:30.810> on<00:05:31.020> it<00:05:31.199> and<00:05:31.440> then<00:05:31.979> you<00:05:32.069> spin<00:05:32.310> it<00:05:32.460> then

00:05:32.719 --> 00:05:32.729 
pressure on it and then you spin it then

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:34.219 
pressure on it and then you spin it then
the<00:05:33.000> grommet<00:05:33.330> goes<00:05:33.479> around<00:05:33.719> and<00:05:33.900> round<00:05:33.960> and

00:05:34.219 --> 00:05:34.229 
the grommet goes around and round and

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:37.700 
the grommet goes around and round and
round<00:05:34.319> with<00:05:35.069> the<00:05:35.580> drill<00:05:36.080> so<00:05:37.080> that's<00:05:37.440> not<00:05:37.560> going

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:37.710 
round with the drill so that's not going

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:40.189 
round with the drill so that's not going
to<00:05:37.800> do<00:05:37.919> very<00:05:37.949> much<00:05:38.340> however<00:05:38.909> if<00:05:39.120> anybody<00:05:39.659> is<00:05:39.930> a

00:05:40.189 --> 00:05:40.199 
to do very much however if anybody is a

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:41.809 
to do very much however if anybody is a
little<00:05:40.440> bit<00:05:40.529> more<00:05:40.740> adept<00:05:41.099> at<00:05:41.310> using<00:05:41.370> an

00:05:41.809 --> 00:05:41.819 
little bit more adept at using an

00:05:41.819 --> 00:05:43.670 
little bit more adept at using an
electric<00:05:42.150> drill<00:05:42.330> and<00:05:42.599> wants<00:05:42.839> to<00:05:42.900> try<00:05:43.110> it<00:05:43.229> then

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:43.680 
electric drill and wants to try it then

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:46.159 
electric drill and wants to try it then
please<00:05:44.009> post<00:05:44.789> a<00:05:44.969> video<00:05:45.060> response<00:05:45.240> because<00:05:45.990> I

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:46.169
