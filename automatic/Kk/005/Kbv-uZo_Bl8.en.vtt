hitting<00:02:16.590> someone<00:02:16.860> in<00:02:16.980> PvP<00:02:17.720> like<00:02:18.720> that<00:02:18.930> is

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
hitting someone in PvP like that is

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.500 
hitting someone in PvP like that is
clearly<00:02:19.500> in<00:02:19.710> one<00:02:19.890> shot<00:02:20.100> now<00:02:20.250> another<00:02:21.150> thing<00:02:21.240> to

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
clearly in one shot now another thing to

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.010 
clearly in one shot now another thing to
think<00:02:21.540> about<00:02:21.810> is<00:02:23.030> period<00:02:24.030> my<00:02:24.210> stats<00:02:24.840> are

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
think about is period my stats are

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.070 
think about is period my stats are
increase<00:02:25.530> period<00:02:26.220> so<00:02:26.940> everything<00:02:27.690> is<00:02:27.870> going

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
increase period so everything is going

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.590 
increase period so everything is going
up<00:02:28.350> every<00:02:28.920> category<00:02:29.640> is<00:02:29.790> going<00:02:30.000> up<00:02:30.209> so<00:02:30.360> I<00:02:30.420> could

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
up every category is going up so I could

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.060 
up every category is going up so I could
I<00:02:30.780> could<00:02:30.959> be<00:02:31.110> pretty<00:02:31.350> much<00:02:31.590> hitting<00:02:31.770> heart

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
I could be pretty much hitting heart

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:34.970 
I could be pretty much hitting heart
with<00:02:32.250> anything<00:02:32.810> as<00:02:33.810> far<00:02:34.200> they<00:02:34.500> don't<00:02:34.530> have<00:02:34.830> to

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
with anything as far they don't have to

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.470 
with anything as far they don't have to
be<00:02:35.100> an<00:02:35.220> ultimate<00:02:35.670> is<00:02:35.760> what<00:02:35.880> I'm<00:02:35.970> trying<00:02:36.209> to<00:02:36.270> say

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
be an ultimate is what I'm trying to say

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.780 
be an ultimate is what I'm trying to say
but<00:02:37.050> um<00:02:37.140> you<00:02:37.410> can<00:02:37.590> see<00:02:37.860> when<00:02:38.100> the<00:02:38.190> things<00:02:38.459> when

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
but um you can see when the things when

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.580 
but um you can see when the things when
the<00:02:38.880> buffs<00:02:39.150> are<00:02:39.360> expiring<00:02:39.870> they<00:02:40.320> start

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
the buffs are expiring they start

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.670 
the buffs are expiring they start
blinking<00:02:40.830> and<00:02:41.340> you<00:02:41.850> can<00:02:42.060> just<00:02:42.360> you<00:02:43.200> know<00:02:43.320> hit

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
blinking and you can just you know hit

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:44.560 
blinking and you can just you know hit
your<00:02:43.830> pose<00:02:44.100> again

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:44.570 
your pose again

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:50.449 
your pose again
now<00:02:47.150> the<00:02:48.150> pose<00:02:48.390> I<00:02:48.600> really<00:02:48.930> recommend<00:02:49.500> for<00:02:49.800> it

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
now the pose I really recommend for it

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:51.860 
now the pose I really recommend for it
depends<00:02:50.880> on<00:02:50.970> the<00:02:51.090> bill<00:02:51.300> like<00:02:51.600> I<00:02:51.720> would

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
depends on the bill like I would

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.530 
depends on the bill like I would
recommend<00:02:52.290> fighting<00:02:52.620> pose<00:02:52.830> G<00:02:53.370> if<00:02:53.670> you're<00:02:54.480> a

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
recommend fighting pose G if you're a

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.360 
recommend fighting pose G if you're a
key<00:02:54.810> blast<00:02:55.110> like<00:02:55.350> this<00:02:55.590> character<00:02:55.890> which<00:02:56.190> I'm

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
key blast like this character which I'm

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.900 
key blast like this character which I'm
one<00:02:56.550> shot<00:02:56.820> was<00:02:57.540> blessed<00:02:57.950> in<00:02:58.950> that<00:02:59.010> Inc<00:02:59.640> that

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
one shot was blessed in that Inc that

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:01.880 
one shot was blessed in that Inc that
temporarily<00:03:00.480> boost<00:03:00.930> your<00:03:01.140> ki<00:03:01.350> blast

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
temporarily boost your ki blast

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.910 
temporarily boost your ki blast
so<00:03:02.489> you're<00:03:02.670> adding<00:03:02.970> another<00:03:03.060> buff<00:03:03.920> you're

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
so you're adding another buff you're

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.460 
so you're adding another buff you're
adding<00:03:05.220> a<00:03:05.310> move<00:03:05.580> buff<00:03:05.989> then<00:03:06.989> you're<00:03:07.230> getting

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
adding a move buff then you're getting

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.620 
adding a move buff then you're getting
the<00:03:07.709> Z<00:03:07.890> so<00:03:08.130> buff<00:03:08.459> then<00:03:08.970> you're<00:03:09.150> going<00:03:09.300> super

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
the Z so buff then you're going super

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:12.920 
the Z so buff then you're going super
saiyan<00:03:09.750> and<00:03:09.959> get<00:03:10.050> in<00:03:10.140> another<00:03:10.410> book<00:03:10.850> now<00:03:11.930> the

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
saiyan and get in another book now the

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.280 
saiyan and get in another book now the
only<00:03:13.200> reason<00:03:13.709> that<00:03:14.120> this<00:03:15.120> might<00:03:15.390> be<00:03:15.600> annoying

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
only reason that this might be annoying

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.680 
only reason that this might be annoying
and<00:03:16.620> difficult<00:03:16.770> is<00:03:17.430> like<00:03:18.030> you<00:03:18.180> have<00:03:18.450> to<00:03:18.570> play

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
and difficult is like you have to play

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:21.979 
and difficult is like you have to play
threes<00:03:19.080> and<00:03:19.500> twos<00:03:19.769> because<00:03:20.250> in<00:03:20.400> a<00:03:20.459> 1v1<00:03:20.989> people

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
threes and twos because in a 1v1 people

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:24.229 
threes and twos because in a 1v1 people
run<00:03:22.290> anywhere<00:03:22.769> so<00:03:23.549> it's<00:03:23.700> not<00:03:23.820> likely<00:03:24.090> that

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
run anywhere so it's not likely that

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:26.030 
run anywhere so it's not likely that
you're<00:03:24.540> gonna<00:03:24.750> be<00:03:25.019> able<00:03:25.110> to<00:03:25.290> you<00:03:25.470> know<00:03:25.500> unless

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
you're gonna be able to you know unless

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.210 
you're gonna be able to you know unless
you<00:03:26.250> spam<00:03:26.610> or<00:03:26.880> something<00:03:27.180> but<00:03:27.799> you<00:03:28.799> never<00:03:28.980> know

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
you spam or something but you never know

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.060 
you spam or something but you never know
I<00:03:29.370> mean<00:03:29.640> it<00:03:29.850> is<00:03:30.000> what<00:03:30.209> it<00:03:30.239> is<00:03:30.450> man<00:03:30.810> but<00:03:31.590> this<00:03:31.920> is

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.070 
I mean it is what it is man but this is

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:34.190 
I mean it is what it is man but this is
my<00:03:32.310> opinion<00:03:32.730> and<00:03:33.120> I<00:03:33.269> believe<00:03:33.600> this<00:03:33.810> is<00:03:33.989> one<00:03:34.170> of

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
my opinion and I believe this is one of
