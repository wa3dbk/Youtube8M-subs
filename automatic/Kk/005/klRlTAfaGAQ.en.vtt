same i was by the beef lag right in

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.359 
same i was by the beef lag right in
front<00:01:30.240> of<00:01:30.299> the<00:01:30.420> wooden<00:01:30.659> crate<00:01:31.320> deal<00:01:31.890> thingy

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
front of the wooden crate deal thingy

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.789 
front of the wooden crate deal thingy
mabob<00:01:32.549> ER<00:01:32.729> and<00:01:32.970> he<00:01:33.479> was<00:01:33.630> at<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:33.869> very<00:01:34.140> back<00:01:34.470> and

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
mabob ER and he was at the very back and

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.100 
mabob ER and he was at the very back and
behind<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.490> truck<00:01:35.759> barely<00:01:36.180> showing<00:01:36.630> his<00:01:36.900> head

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
behind the truck barely showing his head

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.740 
behind the truck barely showing his head
now<00:01:37.650> i<00:01:37.680> understand<00:01:38.430> that<00:01:38.549> the<00:01:38.670> KSG<00:01:39.030> is<00:01:39.299> a<00:01:39.329> slug

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
now i understand that the KSG is a slug

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.030 
now i understand that the KSG is a slug
and<00:01:39.930> it's<00:01:40.020> not<00:01:40.170> buckshot<00:01:40.619> so<00:01:40.770> it's<00:01:40.890> going<00:01:40.979> to

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
and it's not buckshot so it's going to

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.679 
and it's not buckshot so it's going to
have<00:01:41.100> more<00:01:41.400> distance<00:01:41.820> but<00:01:42.240> that<00:01:42.390> does<00:01:42.659> not

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
have more distance but that does not

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.510 
have more distance but that does not
take<00:01:43.110> away<00:01:43.140> from<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:43.680> argument<00:01:44.130> that<00:01:44.250> i<00:01:44.310> have

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
take away from the argument that i have

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.429 
take away from the argument that i have
that<00:01:45.000> it's<00:01:45.180> overpowered<00:01:45.840> for<00:01:46.020> a<00:01:46.049> call<00:01:46.259> of<00:01:46.409> duty

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
that it's overpowered for a call of duty

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 
the KSG should be may be introduced as a

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.670 
the KSG should be may be introduced as a
sniper<00:04:32.490> rifle<00:04:32.669> instead<00:04:33.360> of<00:04:33.450> a<00:04:33.510> shotgun<00:04:33.750> anyway

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:45.530 
just wanted to kind of touch base on it
again<00:04:44.220> because<00:04:44.460> the<00:04:44.730> first<00:04:44.910> clip<00:04:45.120> I<00:04:45.210> put<00:04:45.419> up

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:45.540 
again because the first clip I put up

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:48.590 
again because the first clip I put up
didn't<00:04:46.230> really<00:04:46.380> show<00:04:46.500> the<00:04:46.980> maximize<00:04:47.600> distance

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:48.600 
didn't really show the maximize distance

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.390 
didn't really show the maximize distance
that<00:04:48.750> this<00:04:48.930> thing<00:04:49.110> has<00:04:49.350> so<00:04:49.860> this<00:04:50.100> gives<00:04:50.220> you<00:04:50.370> a

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:50.400 
that this thing has so this gives you a

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.280 
that this thing has so this gives you a
little<00:04:50.610> better<00:04:50.820> idea<00:04:51.330> of<00:04:51.419> how<00:04:51.630> far<00:04:51.930> this<00:04:52.080> thing

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:52.290 
little better idea of how far this thing

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:53.629 
little better idea of how far this thing
will<00:04:52.410> shoot<00:04:52.620> if<00:04:52.740> you're<00:04:52.860> not<00:04:52.980> moving<00:04:53.280> that's

00:04:53.629 --> 00:04:53.639 
will shoot if you're not moving that's

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:55.280 
will shoot if you're not moving that's
it<00:04:53.850> hope<00:04:54.270> you<00:04:54.389> enjoyed<00:04:54.660> be<00:04:54.810> sure<00:04:54.870> to<00:04:55.020> write<00:04:55.139> and
