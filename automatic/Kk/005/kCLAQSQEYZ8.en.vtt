00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.219 
that's slightly bigger than what you'd
normally<00:01:52.920> wear<00:01:53.270> what<00:01:54.270> I<00:01:54.299> do<00:01:54.479> like<00:01:54.750> is<00:01:54.810> it's<00:01:55.110> not

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
normally wear what I do like is it's not

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:56.990 
normally wear what I do like is it's not
very<00:01:55.470> deep<00:01:55.680> pockets<00:01:56.009> on<00:01:56.369> both<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.670> left<00:01:56.700> and

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
very deep pockets on both the left and

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.030 
very deep pockets on both the left and
right<00:01:57.090> side<00:01:57.479> and<00:01:58.020> they're<00:01:58.469> easily<00:01:58.860> big<00:01:59.009> enough

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
right side and they're easily big enough

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.609 
right side and they're easily big enough
to<00:01:59.369> fit<00:01:59.549> your<00:01:59.670> hands<00:01:59.909> into<00:02:00.390> and<00:02:01.079> I'll<00:02:01.229> see<00:02:01.439> is

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
to fit your hands into and I'll see is

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.020 
to fit your hands into and I'll see is
good<00:02:01.829> of<00:02:01.920> a<00:02:01.979> winter<00:02:02.310> coat<00:02:02.520> because<00:02:02.729> it<00:02:02.909> means

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
good of a winter coat because it means

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.760 
good of a winter coat because it means
you<00:02:03.149> can<00:02:03.240> keep<00:02:03.420> your<00:02:03.540> hands<00:02:03.750> warm<00:02:03.990> because<00:02:04.649> I

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
you can keep your hands warm because I

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.620 
you can keep your hands warm because I
find<00:02:05.100> putting<00:02:05.490> them<00:02:05.579> in<00:02:05.670> a<00:02:05.759> pocket<00:02:06.210> obviously

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
find putting them in a pocket obviously

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.449 
find putting them in a pocket obviously
works<00:02:06.840> a<00:02:07.079> lot<00:02:07.200> better<00:02:07.259> than<00:02:07.799> wearing<00:02:08.129> gloves

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
works a lot better than wearing gloves

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:09.430 
works a lot better than wearing gloves
because<00:02:08.670> with<00:02:08.940> gloves

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
because with gloves

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.200 
because with gloves
hands<00:02:09.619> don't<00:02:09.890> move<00:02:10.040> around<00:02:10.220> much<00:02:10.460> and

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:11.210 
hands don't move around much and

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:13.000 
hands don't move around much and
therefore<00:02:11.540> in<00:02:11.630> some<00:02:11.780> ways<00:02:11.930> get<00:02:12.080> cold<00:02:12.410> up<00:02:12.560> at

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
therefore in some ways get cold up at

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:14.080 
therefore in some ways get cold up at
least<00:02:13.130> in<00:02:13.310> here<00:02:13.490> you<00:02:13.640> can<00:02:13.760> actually<00:02:13.820> have

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
least in here you can actually have

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:15.580 
least in here you can actually have
enough<00:02:14.240> room<00:02:14.450> to<00:02:14.630> move<00:02:14.780> your<00:02:14.990> fingers<00:02:15.380> about

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
enough room to move your fingers about

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:21.550 
enough room to move your fingers about
properly<00:02:16.220> and<00:02:16.400> keep<00:02:16.670> yourself<00:02:17.000> warm<00:02:19.150> now<00:02:20.560> it's

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
properly and keep yourself warm now it's

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.230 
properly and keep yourself warm now it's
perfect<00:02:21.890> if<00:02:21.980> it's<00:02:22.190> buttons<00:02:22.550> up<00:02:22.700> here<00:02:23.060> at

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:23.240 
perfect if it's buttons up here at

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.520 
perfect if it's buttons up here at
sleeves<00:02:23.600> it's<00:02:23.810> ready<00:02:23.960> enough<00:02:24.140> done<00:02:24.410> up

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
sleeves it's ready enough done up

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.050 
sleeves it's ready enough done up
earlier<00:02:24.860> this<00:02:25.100> gives<00:02:25.370> it<00:02:25.490> a<00:02:25.550> bit<00:02:25.700> of<00:02:25.760> a<00:02:25.820> tighter

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
earlier this gives it a bit of a tighter

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.720 
earlier this gives it a bit of a tighter
fit<00:02:26.330> there<00:02:26.540> but<00:02:27.290> what<00:02:27.500> I<00:02:27.530> really<00:02:27.980> like<00:02:28.040> I<00:02:28.490> don't

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
fit there but what I really like I don't

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:30.490 
fit there but what I really like I don't
see<00:02:28.910> you<00:02:28.940> can<00:02:29.120> tell<00:02:29.330> it<00:02:29.480> keeps<00:02:30.110> you<00:02:30.260> warm

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
see you can tell it keeps you warm

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.680 
see you can tell it keeps you warm
because<00:02:30.850> earlier<00:02:31.850> when<00:02:31.970> I<00:02:32.060> was<00:02:32.180> wearing<00:02:32.540> it

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
because earlier when I was wearing it

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:34.600 
because earlier when I was wearing it
and<00:02:33.470> this<00:02:33.620> sleeve<00:02:33.980> was<00:02:34.190> hanging<00:02:34.490> open

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
and this sleeve was hanging open

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.030 
and this sleeve was hanging open
whenever<00:02:35.450> a<00:02:35.540> cold<00:02:35.810> air<00:02:35.990> rushed<00:02:36.170> up<00:02:36.380> sleeve<00:02:36.710> it

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
whenever a cold air rushed up sleeve it

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.070 
whenever a cold air rushed up sleeve it
felt<00:02:37.400> much<00:02:37.610> much<00:02:37.910> cooler<00:02:38.270> than<00:02:38.540> when<00:02:38.720> I<00:02:38.750> just

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080 
felt much much cooler than when I just

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.800 
felt much much cooler than when I just
had<00:02:39.370> you<00:02:40.370> know<00:02:40.490> my<00:02:40.670> hands<00:02:40.880> in<00:02:41.030> the<00:02:41.120> pockets<00:02:41.510> so

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
had you know my hands in the pockets so

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.530 
had you know my hands in the pockets so
the<00:02:41.960> coat<00:02:42.170> works<00:02:42.530> really<00:02:42.950> well<00:02:43.220> so<00:02:44.150> if<00:02:44.300> you<00:02:44.420> can

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
the coat works really well so if you can

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:45.730 
the coat works really well so if you can
still<00:02:44.720> find<00:02:44.750> these<00:02:45.140> get<00:02:45.350> them<00:02:45.560> because

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:45.740 
still find these get them because

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:47.680 
still find these get them because
they're<00:02:45.920> about<00:02:46.130> 10<00:02:46.520> 15<00:02:47.030> pounds<00:02:47.270> something

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
they're about 10 15 pounds something

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:49.510 
they're about 10 15 pounds something
like<00:02:47.870> that<00:02:48.170> it<00:02:48.770> might<00:02:48.920> be<00:02:49.070> more<00:02:49.340> expensive

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:49.520 
like that it might be more expensive

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.550 
like that it might be more expensive
from<00:02:50.030> other<00:02:50.240> sellers<00:02:50.570> but<00:02:50.990> these<00:02:51.200> work

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
from other sellers but these work

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.880 
from other sellers but these work
surprisingly<00:02:52.280> well<00:02:53.030> for<00:02:53.060> the<00:02:53.360> price<00:02:53.890> they're

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
surprisingly well for the price they're

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:56.470 
surprisingly well for the price they're
quite<00:02:55.130> nice<00:02:55.310> coats<00:02:55.670> I<00:02:55.850> mean<00:02:56.000> you<00:02:56.090> wear<00:02:56.360> it

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:09.890 
I like it as well because it's raindrop

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:11.380 
I like it as well because it's raindrop
camo<00:03:10.160> which<00:03:10.400> is<00:03:10.520> one<00:03:10.610> of<00:03:10.700> my<00:03:10.820> favorite<00:03:11.210> camo

camo which is one of my favorite camo
patterns<00:03:11.870> and<00:03:12.710> it's<00:03:12.860> interesting<00:03:13.160> to<00:03:13.459> find

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:13.520 
patterns and it's interesting to find

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.400 
patterns and it's interesting to find
one<00:03:13.910> the<00:03:14.000> ones<00:03:14.150> that<00:03:14.330> isn't<00:03:14.660> East<00:03:14.959> German

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:16.750 
one the ones that isn't East German
raindrop<00:03:15.830> because<00:03:16.070> the<00:03:16.220> colours<00:03:16.550> are<00:03:16.640> not

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
raindrop because the colours are not

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.740 
raindrop because the colours are not
very<00:03:17.030> it's<00:03:17.810> kind<00:03:18.050> of<00:03:18.140> got<00:03:18.290> this<00:03:18.440> slightly

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
very it's kind of got this slightly

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.150 
very it's kind of got this slightly
almost<00:03:20.750> flecktarn<00:03:21.320> kind<00:03:21.709> of<00:03:21.800> pattern

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.160 
almost flecktarn kind of pattern

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:23.770 
almost flecktarn kind of pattern
underneath<00:03:22.520> the<00:03:22.970> stripes<00:03:23.360> which<00:03:23.600> is

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 
underneath the stripes which is

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:26.140 
underneath the stripes which is
interesting<00:03:24.440> as<00:03:24.530> well<00:03:24.680> I<00:03:24.970> think<00:03:25.970> there<00:03:26.060> were

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
interesting as well I think there were

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.090 
interesting as well I think there were
some<00:03:26.360> patterns<00:03:26.840> in<00:03:27.020> some<00:03:27.470> Eastern<00:03:27.739> European

some patterns in some Eastern European

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:29.560 
some patterns in some Eastern European
