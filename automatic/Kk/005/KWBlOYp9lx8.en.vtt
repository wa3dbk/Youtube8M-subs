now because worry it's not gonna help
you<00:04:54.290> if<00:04:54.740> you<00:04:55.070> just<00:04:55.100> focus<00:04:55.520> on<00:04:55.850> the<00:04:56.150> good<00:04:56.300> things

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:56.360

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:00.860 
but they will find a solution by itself

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:03.160

may<00:05:11.030> seem<00:05:11.090> obvious<00:05:11.600> and<00:05:12.140> simms<00:05:12.440> very

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:12.830 
may seem obvious and simms very

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:14.440

different from all the things I talked
about<00:05:14.780> but<00:05:15.110> it<00:05:16.180> really<00:05:17.180> helps<00:05:17.660> me<00:05:17.830> which<00:05:18.830> is<00:05:18.980> to

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:19.160 
about but it really helps me which is to

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:23.290 
about but it really helps me which is to
exercise<00:05:19.580> somehow<00:05:20.500> exercising<00:05:21.500> it<00:05:22.120> brings<00:05:23.120> up

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:23.300 
exercise somehow exercising it brings up

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:25.270 
exercise somehow exercising it brings up
your<00:05:23.420> endorphin<00:05:24.140> it<00:05:24.740> brings<00:05:25.070> out<00:05:25.220> your
