00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
having problems from the conversion now

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:27.589 
having problems from the conversion now
I'll<00:00:22.260> turn<00:00:22.470> these<00:00:22.769> over<00:00:24.470> take<00:00:25.470> a<00:00:25.500> little<00:00:26.599> more

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
of a look about the problems they've

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:35.120 
of a look about the problems they've
been<00:00:29.939> caused<00:00:32.809> ok<00:00:33.809> so<00:00:33.870> y<00:00:34.260> tu<00:00:34.320> iphone<00:00:34.649> backs

been caused ok so y tu iphone backs

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.100 
been caused ok so y tu iphone backs
looking<00:00:35.520> quite<00:00:35.670> different<00:00:36.149> because<00:00:36.360> there<00:00:37.020> is

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
looking quite different because there is

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.500 
looking quite different because there is
a<00:00:37.140> huge<00:00:37.530> area<00:00:37.800> here<00:00:38.219> they<00:00:38.399> should<00:00:39.239> have<00:00:39.480> a

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
a huge area here they should have a

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.360 
a huge area here they should have a
corner<00:00:39.780> on<00:00:39.899> it<00:00:40.050> but<00:00:40.200> hasn't<00:00:40.559> if<00:00:41.040> you<00:00:41.160> look<00:00:41.280> at

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:46.550 
have the cover covering up some very

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.270 
have the cover covering up some very
delicate<00:00:47.550> items<00:00:48.200> what<00:00:49.200> has<00:00:49.649> happened<00:00:49.829> to<00:00:50.160> the

cover I do not know i'm guessing to a
certain<00:00:54.270> extent<00:00:54.570> he's<00:00:54.750> been<00:00:54.930> damaged<00:00:55.440> and

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
certain extent he's been damaged and

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.580 
certain extent he's been damaged and
ripped<00:00:56.190> off<00:00:56.370> in<00:00:56.399> some<00:00:56.760> way<00:00:56.910> kasi<00:00:57.270> bc<00:00:57.629> this<00:00:58.320> sort

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
ripped off in some way kasi bc this sort

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.799 
ripped off in some way kasi bc this sort
of<00:00:58.680> frame<00:00:59.010> here<00:00:59.489> not<00:00:59.789> very<00:01:00.059> much<00:01:00.270> of<00:01:00.480> a<00:01:00.539> frame

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
of frame here not very much of a frame

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.260 
of frame here not very much of a frame
the<00:01:01.680> frame<00:01:01.770> should<00:01:02.010> continue<00:01:02.579> all<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:02.850> way

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
the frame should continue all the way

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.149 
the frame should continue all the way
around<00:01:03.510> this<00:01:04.019> part<00:01:04.320> of<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.470> main<00:01:04.619> board<00:01:04.830> and

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
around this part of the main board and

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:11.240 
around this part of the main board and
then<00:01:06.060> have<00:01:06.360> a<00:01:06.659> sort<00:01:07.170> of<00:01:07.229> silver<00:01:07.880> cover<00:01:10.250> with

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
then have a sort of silver cover with

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.039 
then have a sort of silver cover with
maybe<00:01:11.490> that<00:01:11.670> black<00:01:12.350> cover<00:01:13.350> stop<00:01:13.890> to<00:01:14.130> it<00:01:15.049> so

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
maybe that black cover stop to it so

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.719 
maybe that black cover stop to it so
what<00:01:16.409> does<00:01:16.560> happen<00:01:16.740> to<00:01:16.950> that<00:01:17.100> i<00:01:17.130> don't<00:01:17.460> know

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
what does happen to that i don't know

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.060 
what does happen to that i don't know
the<00:01:18.509> phone<00:01:18.689> does<00:01:18.990> still<00:01:19.530> work<00:01:19.740> though<00:01:19.920> and

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
the phone does still work though and

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.340 
the phone does still work though and
that's<00:01:20.159> fine<00:01:20.460> but<00:01:21.180> personally<00:01:21.930> that<00:01:22.200> is

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
that's fine but personally that is

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.679 
that's fine but personally that is
damaged<00:01:22.830> I<00:01:23.070> think<00:01:23.400> and<00:01:23.640> there<00:01:24.299> shouldn't<00:01:24.540> have

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
damaged I think and there shouldn't have

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.550 
damaged I think and there shouldn't have
happened<00:01:25.400> also<00:01:26.630> the<00:01:27.630> battery<00:01:27.990> connector<00:01:28.350> here

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
happened also the battery connector here

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.399 
happened also the battery connector here
it<00:01:29.430> looks<00:01:29.610> like<00:01:29.729> it's<00:01:29.880> been<00:01:30.030> ripped<00:01:30.360> off<00:01:30.600> the

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
it looks like it's been ripped off the

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.890 
it looks like it's been ripped off the
main<00:01:32.250> board<00:01:32.490> itself<00:01:32.939> you<00:01:33.119> see<00:01:33.270> these<00:01:33.420> silver

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
main board itself you see these silver

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.390 
main board itself you see these silver
areas<00:01:34.409> these<00:01:35.340> contacts<00:01:36.590> on<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.650> connector

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
areas these contacts on the connector

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.390 
areas these contacts on the connector
should<00:01:38.759> be<00:01:39.000> soldered<00:01:39.390> to<00:01:39.570> them<00:01:40.220> isn't<00:01:41.220> though

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
should be soldered to them isn't though

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.230 
should be soldered to them isn't though
due<00:01:41.939> to<00:01:42.270> maybe<00:01:43.229> carelessness<00:01:43.820> similar<00:01:44.820> to<00:01:45.060> the

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
due to maybe carelessness similar to the

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.420 
due to maybe carelessness similar to the
cover<00:01:45.540> what's<00:01:46.470> going<00:01:46.649> to<00:01:46.710> happen<00:01:47.070> with<00:01:47.280> this

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
cover what's going to happen with this

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.639 
cover what's going to happen with this
I'm<00:01:47.640> going<00:01:47.790> to<00:01:47.880> solder<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.299> connector<00:01:49.290> back

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
I'm going to solder the connector back

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.469 
I'm going to solder the connector back
on<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:50.280> main<00:01:50.460> board<00:01:50.490> so<00:01:50.880> we<00:01:50.909> can<00:01:51.090> get<00:01:51.180> power

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
on the main board so we can get power

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.770 
on the main board so we can get power
back<00:01:51.780> into<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:52.860> phone<00:01:53.130> again<00:01:53.600> also<00:01:54.600> very

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
back into the phone again also very

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.830 
back into the phone again also very
close<00:01:55.049> by<00:01:55.320> if<00:01:55.770> you<00:01:55.920> see<00:01:56.159> this<00:01:56.479> cable<00:01:57.479> here<00:01:57.509> the

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
close by if you see this cable here the

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.530 
close by if you see this cable here the
end<00:01:57.960> of<00:01:58.079> the<00:01:58.140> cable<00:01:58.350> should<00:01:59.219> be<00:01:59.640> connected<00:02:00.119> to

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
end of the cable should be connected to

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.170 
end of the cable should be connected to
that<00:02:00.990> connected<00:02:01.710> there<00:02:01.920> and<00:02:02.219> then<00:02:03.090> this

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
that connected there and then this

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.389 
that connected there and then this
connector<00:02:03.719> is<00:02:03.869> very<00:02:04.110> very<00:02:04.469> easy<00:02:04.829> to<00:02:05.070> remove

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
connector is very very easy to remove

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.609 
connector is very very easy to remove
but<00:02:06.390> some<00:02:06.659> reason<00:02:06.990> it<00:02:07.110> seems<00:02:07.259> to<00:02:07.409> have<00:02:07.530> been

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
but some reason it seems to have been

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.949 
but some reason it seems to have been
ripped<00:02:07.950> out<00:02:08.149> like<00:02:09.149> I<00:02:09.179> said<00:02:09.420> before<00:02:09.569> about<00:02:09.780> the

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
ripped out like I said before about the

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.750 
ripped out like I said before about the
carelessness<00:02:10.410> I<00:02:10.739> think<00:02:11.250> that's<00:02:11.520> what's

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
carelessness I think that's what's

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.050 
carelessness I think that's what's
happened

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
happened

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.610 
happened
however<00:02:14.060> is<00:02:14.180> done<00:02:14.360> this<00:02:14.569> I<00:02:14.810> don't<00:02:15.140> think<00:02:15.260> has

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
however is done this I don't think has

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.540 
however is done this I don't think has
got<00:02:16.370> much<00:02:16.550> of<00:02:16.580> a<00:02:16.870> idea<00:02:17.870> about<00:02:18.740> how<00:02:19.220> to<00:02:19.280> take

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550 
got much of a idea about how to take

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:20.740 
got much of a idea about how to take
care<00:02:19.760> of<00:02:19.819> these<00:02:20.000> things<00:02:20.209> and<00:02:20.390> about<00:02:20.540> how<00:02:20.690> to

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
care of these things and about how to

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.850 
care of these things and about how to
properly<00:02:21.490> remove<00:02:22.490> components<00:02:23.420> on<00:02:23.860> iPhones

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
properly remove components on iPhones

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.590 
properly remove components on iPhones
and<00:02:25.660> also<00:02:26.660> sort<00:02:27.530> of<00:02:27.620> put<00:02:28.100> screws<00:02:28.730> back<00:02:29.000> in<00:02:29.060> the

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
and also sort of put screws back in the

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.229 
and also sort of put screws back in the
castle<00:02:29.959> guts<00:02:30.230> screw<00:02:31.190> there<00:02:31.430> yep<00:02:31.819> okay<00:02:32.180> so

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:32.239 
castle guts screw there yep okay so

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:34.030 
castle guts screw there yep okay so
screw<00:02:32.569> but<00:02:32.780> it<00:02:32.900> does<00:02:33.200> look<00:02:33.290> quite<00:02:33.650> big

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
screw but it does look quite big

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.970 
screw but it does look quite big
compared<00:02:34.700> to<00:02:34.910> what<00:02:35.090> should<00:02:35.390> be<00:02:35.450> there<00:02:35.720> I<00:02:35.750> think

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
compared to what should be there I think

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.770 
compared to what should be there I think
we've<00:02:36.980> got<00:02:37.160> a<00:02:37.190> screw<00:02:37.430> missing<00:02:37.459> here<00:02:37.970> and<00:02:38.690> a

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
we've got a screw missing here and a

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.380 
we've got a screw missing here and a
screw<00:02:38.989> missing<00:02:39.020> there<00:02:39.440> as<00:02:39.590> well<00:02:39.800> so<00:02:40.390> what

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
screw missing there as well so what

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.979 
screw missing there as well so what
really<00:02:41.600> it's<00:02:41.810> not<00:02:41.959> looking<00:02:42.200> good<00:02:42.610> this<00:02:43.989> went

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:44.989 
really it's not looking good this went

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:48.759 
really it's not looking good this went
into<00:02:45.470> wherever<00:02:45.790> for<00:02:46.790> a<00:02:47.060> color<00:02:47.930> conversion<00:02:48.380> and

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:48.769 
into wherever for a color conversion and

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:49.900 
into wherever for a color conversion and
it<00:02:48.860> should<00:02:49.010> have<00:02:49.100> come<00:02:49.130> out<00:02:49.370> working<00:02:49.850> a

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:49.910 
it should have come out working a

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.120 
it should have come out working a
hundred<00:02:50.180> percent<00:02:50.269> and<00:02:50.660> but<00:02:50.870> instead<00:02:51.440> it's

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
hundred percent and but instead it's

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.300 
hundred percent and but instead it's
come<00:02:52.400> on<00:02:52.519> quite<00:02:52.730> damaged<00:02:53.150> and<00:02:53.360> not<00:02:53.690> working

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
come on quite damaged and not working

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.750 
come on quite damaged and not working
now<00:02:55.310> this<00:02:56.090> is<00:02:56.269> why<00:02:56.780> has<00:02:57.470> been<00:02:57.620> sent<00:02:57.920> to<00:02:58.069> me<00:02:58.130> so

reader somehow and also if you look at
this<00:04:05.450> sort<00:04:05.900> of<00:04:05.989> the<00:04:06.109> side<00:04:06.290> of<00:04:06.320> it<00:04:06.560> the

this sort of the side of it the
mid-frame<00:04:07.190> have<00:04:07.459> been<00:04:07.549> changed<00:04:07.910> as<00:04:08.000> well<00:04:08.030> as

now<00:04:12.829> that's<00:04:13.010> taking<00:04:13.430> the<00:04:13.459> soul<00:04:13.790> or<00:04:14.030> function

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.480 
now that's taking the soul or function

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.009 
now that's taking the soul or function
away<00:04:14.690> from<00:04:14.930> it<00:04:15.049> in<00:04:15.260> the<00:04:15.620> wireless<00:04:16.190> department

doing that on this particular one

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:40.040

because they've been removed and if you

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:42.290 
because they've been removed and if you
watch<00:04:40.200> the<00:04:40.410> movie<00:04:40.740> of<00:04:41.190> the<00:04:41.670> repairs<00:04:42.000> I've<00:04:42.150> done

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300 
watch the movie of the repairs I've done

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.300 
watch the movie of the repairs I've done
on<00:04:42.390> this<00:04:42.540> up<00:04:42.750> until<00:04:42.900> now<00:04:43.050> i<00:04:43.530> have<00:04:44.010> mentioned

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:44.310 
on this up until now i have mentioned

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:46.670 
on this up until now i have mentioned
that<00:04:44.550> so<00:04:44.790> you<00:04:44.850> will<00:04:45.090> see<00:04:45.120> it<00:04:45.480> what<00:04:46.290> it's<00:04:46.440> done

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 
that so you will see it what it's done

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:53.600 
that so you will see it what it's done
is<00:04:46.880> giving<00:04:47.880> it<00:04:48.000> a<00:04:48.660> much<00:04:50.570> weaker<00:04:52.310> ability<00:04:53.310> to

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:53.610 
is giving it a much weaker ability to

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:56.300 
is giving it a much weaker ability to
connect<00:04:54.240> wireless<00:04:54.630> networks<00:04:55.050> as<00:04:55.860> opposed<00:04:56.130> to

them it's some sort of carelessness not

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:23.570 
them it's some sort of carelessness not
paying<00:05:21.660> really<00:05:22.290> enough<00:05:22.590> attention<00:05:22.830> to<00:05:23.160> detail

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:23.580 
paying really enough attention to detail

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:27.140 
paying really enough attention to detail
to<00:05:24.090> make<00:05:24.690> sure<00:05:24.960> that<00:05:25.230> the<00:05:25.710> items<00:05:25.740> are<00:05:26.190> safe<00:05:26.430> all

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:27.150 
to make sure that the items are safe all

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:28.790 
to make sure that the items are safe all
the<00:05:27.210> way<00:05:27.510> through<00:05:27.690> the<00:05:27.840> conversion<00:05:28.410> and<00:05:28.650> they

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:28.800 
the way through the conversion and they

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:32.750 
the way through the conversion and they
leave<00:05:29.100> working<00:05:29.850> without<00:05:30.210> any<00:05:31.280> ability<00:05:32.280> taken

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:32.760 
leave working without any ability taken

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:37.100 
leave working without any ability taken
away<00:05:33.000> from<00:05:33.300> the<00:05:33.450> items<00:05:34.700> one<00:05:35.700> final<00:05:36.330> thing<00:05:36.750> on

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:37.110 
away from the items one final thing on

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:42.290 
away from the items one final thing on
these<00:05:37.790> turn<00:05:38.790> them<00:05:38.910> over<00:05:40.730> okay<00:05:41.730> we<00:05:41.880> take<00:05:42.060> a<00:05:42.090> look

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:42.300 
these turn them over okay we take a look

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:46.160 
these turn them over okay we take a look
above<00:05:42.840> the<00:05:43.260> ear<00:05:43.890> pieces<00:05:44.190> and<00:05:44.900> they<00:05:45.900> sort<00:05:46.080> of

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:46.170 
above the ear pieces and they sort of

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:48.250 
above the ear pieces and they sort of
grid<00:05:46.500> its<00:05:46.710> shape<00:05:46.950> there<00:05:47.340> and<00:05:47.820> they're

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:48.260 
grid its shape there and they're

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:51.290 
grid its shape there and they're
obviously<00:05:49.260> different<00:05:49.590> color<00:05:49.890> but<00:05:50.850> so<00:05:51.150> i'm

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:51.300 
obviously different color but so i'm

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:53.090 
obviously different color but so i'm
guessing<00:05:51.480> the<00:05:51.930> components<00:05:52.740> have<00:05:52.830> been<00:05:52.860> made

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:53.100 
guessing the components have been made

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:55.310 
guessing the components have been made
by<00:05:53.850> the<00:05:53.880> same<00:05:53.970> manufacturer<00:05:54.810> underneath

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:55.320 
by the same manufacturer underneath

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:57.680 
by the same manufacturer underneath
those<00:05:55.560> grits<00:05:55.860> is<00:05:56.100> the<00:05:56.700> proximity<00:05:57.180> and<00:05:57.480> light

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:57.690 
those grits is the proximity and light

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:01.940 
those grits is the proximity and light
sensor<00:05:58.310> now<00:05:59.310> they<00:05:59.790> do<00:05:59.850> not<00:06:00.450> and<00:06:01.170> what<00:06:01.650> doomed

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:01.950 
sensor now they do not and what doomed

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:06.800 
sensor now they do not and what doomed
are<00:06:02.310> not<00:06:02.550> so<00:06:02.880> the<00:06:03.030> same<00:06:03.270> as<00:06:03.570> a<00:06:04.130> true<00:06:05.810> white

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:06.810 
are not so the same as a true white

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:11.150 
are not so the same as a true white
iphone<00:06:07.470> shall<00:06:07.710> we<00:06:07.830> say<00:06:08.040> a<00:06:08.330> shape<00:06:10.070> should<00:06:11.070> be

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:11.160 
iphone shall we say a shape should be

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:13.100 
iphone shall we say a shape should be
more<00:06:11.310> like<00:06:11.370> this<00:06:11.820> now<00:06:12.060> this<00:06:12.270> isn't<00:06:12.510> a<00:06:12.810> true

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:13.110 
more like this now this isn't a true

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:15.190 
more like this now this isn't a true
white<00:06:13.380> iphone<00:06:13.890> it's<00:06:14.100> a<00:06:14.160> conversion<00:06:14.580> i've<00:06:14.820> just

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:15.200 
white iphone it's a conversion i've just

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:19.460 
white iphone it's a conversion i've just
completed<00:06:16.200> but<00:06:17.130> a<00:06:17.460> true<00:06:17.790> white<00:06:18.030> iphone<00:06:18.540> does

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:19.470 
completed but a true white iphone does

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:21.350 
completed but a true white iphone does
half<00:06:19.740> of<00:06:19.890> that<00:06:20.010> black<00:06:20.250> slot<00:06:20.580> there<00:06:20.850> so<00:06:21.240> it

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:21.360 
half of that black slot there so it

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:26.690 
half of that black slot there so it
looks<00:06:21.540> exactly<00:06:21.720> the<00:06:22.230> same<00:06:24.050> so<00:06:25.050> that<00:06:25.650> is<00:06:26.040> pretty

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:26.700 
looks exactly the same so that is pretty

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:29.000 
looks exactly the same so that is pretty
much<00:06:26.880> what<00:06:26.940> it<00:06:27.150> should<00:06:27.360> look<00:06:27.390> like<00:06:27.830> apart<00:06:28.830> from

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:29.010 
much what it should look like apart from

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:31.400 
much what it should look like apart from
the<00:06:29.250> black<00:06:30.060> home<00:06:30.330> button<00:06:30.720> up<00:06:30.840> and<00:06:31.020> has<00:06:31.140> to<00:06:31.260> keep

for<00:06:50.800> now<00:06:50.980> stop<00:06:51.400> them<00:06:51.550> working<00:06:52.110> the<00:06:53.110> damage<00:06:53.710> is

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:53.920 
for now stop them working the damage is

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:59.100 
for now stop them working the damage is
repairable<00:06:54.910> then<00:06:55.510> that's<00:06:55.780> fine<00:06:56.400> but<00:06:58.110> there

00:06:59.100 --> 00:06:59.110 
repairable then that's fine but there

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:02.040 
repairable then that's fine but there
could<00:06:59.830> have<00:06:59.950> been<00:07:00.010> a<00:07:00.250> case<00:07:00.850> with<00:07:01.540> this<00:07:01.720> one<00:07:01.930> in

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:02.050 
could have been a case with this one in

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:04.110 
could have been a case with this one in
particular<00:07:02.250> where<00:07:03.250> the<00:07:03.550> damage<00:07:03.880> could<00:07:04.060> have

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:04.120 
particular where the damage could have

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:06.810 
particular where the damage could have
been<00:07:04.210> irreversible<00:07:05.050> mainly<00:07:05.740> because<00:07:05.920> of<00:07:06.640> this

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:06.820 
been irreversible mainly because of this

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:10.290 
been irreversible mainly because of this
battery<00:07:07.210> connector<00:07:07.690> now<00:07:08.680> all<00:07:08.940> that<00:07:09.940> was<00:07:10.030> asked

00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:10.300 
battery connector now all that was asked

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:13.080 
battery connector now all that was asked
for<00:07:10.360> it<00:07:10.540> was<00:07:10.660> a<00:07:10.690> color<00:07:10.930> conversion<00:07:11.730> so<00:07:12.730> really

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:13.090 
for it was a color conversion so really

00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:14.610 
for it was a color conversion so really
what<00:07:13.300> I'm<00:07:13.360> saying<00:07:13.630> is<00:07:13.780> if<00:07:13.990> you're<00:07:14.140> thinking<00:07:14.320> of

what I'm saying is if you're thinking of

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:19.470 
what I'm saying is if you're thinking of
having<00:07:15.070> your<00:07:16.020> iPhone<00:07:17.460> converted<00:07:18.460> from<00:07:18.730> black

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:19.480

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:24.330 
to white or blue in this case or any
other<00:07:21.940> color<00:07:22.260> make<00:07:23.260> sure<00:07:23.500> it's<00:07:23.830> going<00:07:24.040> to

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:24.340 
other color make sure it's going to

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:27.510 
other color make sure it's going to

going<00:07:27.670> to<00:07:27.970> do<00:07:28.090> the<00:07:28.210> conversion<00:07:28.390> ask<00:07:29.160> what<00:07:30.160> is

00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:30.640 
going to do the conversion ask what is

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:32.400 
going to do the conversion ask what is
going<00:07:31.150> to<00:07:31.240> be<00:07:31.330> done<00:07:31.450> what<00:07:31.720> components<00:07:32.350> are

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:32.410 
going to be done what components are

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:34.650 
going to be done what components are
going<00:07:32.530> to<00:07:32.590> be<00:07:32.650> done<00:07:33.090> what<00:07:34.090> component<00:07:34.480> is<00:07:34.540> going

00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:34.660 
going to be done what component is going

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:38.160 
going to be done what component is going
to<00:07:34.720> be<00:07:34.780> used<00:07:35.080> trying<00:07:35.530> to<00:07:35.620> say<00:07:36.210> to<00:07:37.210> to<00:07:37.810> make<00:07:37.930> sure
