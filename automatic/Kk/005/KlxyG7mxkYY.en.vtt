00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.530 
everything it's awesome around a little
but<00:01:40.950> then<00:01:41.189> what<00:01:41.579> we<00:01:41.700> decided<00:01:42.060> to<00:01:42.119> do<00:01:42.270> is<00:01:42.420> get

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
but then what we decided to do is get

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.030 
but then what we decided to do is get
around<00:01:42.780> that<00:01:42.960> corner<00:01:43.200> because<00:01:43.500> when<00:01:43.860> we're

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
around that corner because when we're

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.740 
around that corner because when we're
around<00:01:44.159> that<00:01:44.490> corner<00:01:44.670> it<00:01:44.970> it's<00:01:45.450> a<00:01:45.570> lot<00:01:45.689> easier

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
around that corner it it's a lot easier

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.260 
around that corner it it's a lot easier
to<00:01:46.200> get<00:01:46.320> zipped<00:01:46.710> up<00:01:46.920> by<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:47.520> offspring<00:01:47.820> gunner

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
to get zipped up by the offspring gunner

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.929 
to get zipped up by the offspring gunner
which<00:01:48.450> is<00:01:48.659> exactly<00:01:49.409> what<00:01:49.950> you<00:01:49.979> want<00:01:50.280> so<00:01:50.520> there

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
which is exactly what you want so there

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.690 
which is exactly what you want so there
go<00:01:51.060> our<00:01:51.240> Lee<00:01:51.420> you<00:01:51.540> get<00:01:51.720> zipped<00:01:52.049> up<00:01:52.259> and<00:01:52.520> then<00:01:53.520> he

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
go our Lee you get zipped up and then he

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.889 
go our Lee you get zipped up and then he
gets<00:01:53.820> taken<00:01:54.149> out<00:01:54.509> right<00:01:55.290> outside<00:01:55.470> the<00:01:55.770> map<00:01:56.899> so

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
gets taken out right outside the map so

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.510 
gets taken out right outside the map so
now<00:01:58.229> when<00:01:58.469> yet<00:01:58.649> when<00:01:58.829> the<00:01:58.860> outside<00:01:59.280> map

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
now when yet when the outside map

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.160 
now when yet when the outside map
wherever<00:02:00.000> you<00:02:00.090> land<00:02:00.450> you<00:02:00.689> want<00:02:00.869> to<00:02:00.960> lay<00:02:01.049> your

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
wherever you land you want to lay your

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.959 
wherever you land you want to lay your
tech<00:02:01.409> exactly<00:02:02.250> there<00:02:02.430> you<00:02:02.579> don't<00:02:02.670> want<00:02:02.909> to

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
tech exactly there you don't want to

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.609 
tech exactly there you don't want to
move<00:02:03.119> too<00:02:03.180> much<00:02:03.450> because<00:02:03.630> it's<00:02:04.079> possible<00:02:04.469> that

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
move too much because it's possible that

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.039 
move too much because it's possible that
you<00:02:04.740> might<00:02:04.920> die<00:02:05.219> you<00:02:05.700> just<00:02:05.969> want<00:02:06.180> the<00:02:06.299> once<00:02:06.899> you

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
you might die you just want the once you

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.109 
you might die you just want the once you
land<00:02:07.229> you<00:02:07.530> lay<00:02:07.710> your<00:02:07.860> tech<00:02:08.160> and<00:02:08.429> then<00:02:08.940> you're

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
land you lay your tech and then you're

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.730 
land you lay your tech and then you're
able<00:02:09.270> to<00:02:09.569> go<00:02:09.810> ahead<00:02:10.050> and

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:10.740 
able to go ahead and

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:14.690 
able to go ahead and
explore<00:02:11.630> now<00:02:12.630> I<00:02:13.050> catch<00:02:13.860> up<00:02:14.040> with<00:02:14.190> our<00:02:14.280> Lee<00:02:14.490> and

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
explore now I catch up with our Lee and

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.390 
explore now I catch up with our Lee and

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
we pretty much are just exploring this

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.430 
we pretty much are just exploring this
humongous<00:02:18.090> map<00:02:18.300> now<00:02:18.600> what<00:02:18.930> I<00:02:18.960> want<00:02:19.200> to<00:02:19.260> tell

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
humongous map now what I want to tell

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.680 
humongous map now what I want to tell
you<00:02:19.590> guys<00:02:19.710> is<00:02:19.980> one<00:02:20.280> we're<00:02:20.460> right<00:02:20.610> here<00:02:20.640> when<00:02:21.570> we

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
across the UM the river up from

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.110 
across the UM the river up from
marketing<00:02:39.690> so<00:02:40.440> that<00:02:40.680> was<00:02:40.830> really<00:02:40.860> epic<00:02:41.460> to<00:02:41.820> be

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
marketing so that was really epic to be

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.300

able<00:02:42.240> to<00:02:42.480> explore<00:02:43.440> the<00:02:43.620> other<00:02:43.770> town<00:02:44.070> that

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
able to explore the other town that

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.070 
able to explore the other town that
other<00:02:44.550> time<00:02:44.760> is<00:02:44.970> similar<00:02:45.270> to<00:02:45.480> the<00:02:45.570> first<00:02:45.810> time

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
other time is similar to the first time

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.230 
other time is similar to the first time
but<00:02:46.830> um<00:02:46.980> it<00:02:47.220> just<00:02:47.250> looks<00:02:47.640> different<00:02:47.730> you<00:02:48.120> know

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.240 
but um it just looks different you know

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.570 
but um it just looks different you know
it's<00:02:48.480> cool<00:02:48.840> to<00:02:49.020> just<00:02:49.230> have<00:02:49.500> like<00:02:49.800> two<00:02:50.220> towns

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
it's cool to just have like two towns

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.080 
it's cool to just have like two towns
and<00:02:51.060> one<00:02:51.470> humongous<00:02:52.470> map<00:02:52.950> now<00:02:53.610> you<00:02:53.670> can<00:02:53.940> also

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
and one humongous map now you can also

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.180 
and one humongous map now you can also
cross<00:02:54.450> this<00:02:54.690> bridge<00:02:54.960> because<00:02:55.650> I<00:02:55.680> was<00:02:56.010> actually

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
cross this bridge because I was actually

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.340 
cross this bridge because I was actually
surprised<00:02:56.700> the<00:02:56.820> bridge<00:02:57.030> was<00:02:57.210> solid<00:02:57.660> and<00:02:57.810> you

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
surprised the bridge was solid and you

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:59.870 
surprised the bridge was solid and you
able<00:02:58.590> to<00:02:58.650> cross<00:02:58.830> the<00:02:58.980> bridge<00:02:59.190> now<00:02:59.400> what<00:02:59.760> is

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
able to cross the bridge now what is

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.790
