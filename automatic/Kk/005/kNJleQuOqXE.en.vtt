00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.250
 I did not know that I was going from Italy. 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:35.790
 in the bath so it has been mapped to do 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:38.250
 music until the letter in the head the head to 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.469

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.789
 I can promise that we will now seek and 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.649
 on the same day you have 1,000 views 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.690
 after an hour and have passed the video 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.489
 I thank you all, I did not know that 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.050

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.760

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.469
 you do not have on the ground but in truth 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.000
 People, I'm making this video for 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.489
 talk to you some changes will go 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.100
 happen as carol and vision new six 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:05.129
 who arrived there who do not know 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.810
 Anything from the channel on that car after 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.299
 quite firm enough voice play 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.159
 quite random things so that's what 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.140
 I like to do the post here where I 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.000
 I wanted to let you know when I had 1,000 subscribers. 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.430
 not so many people who wanted to talk 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.729
 with me and I usually one day 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:23.040
 world was very easy was quiet 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.710
 it was all quieter but now the 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.930
 galley with seven thousand subscribers enrolled 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.180
 more than 3,000 views in each 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.070
 video but with a thousand likes and many 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.840
 comments are being impossible because 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.909
 I was leaving is on all subscriptions 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.740
 videos and the time system in these 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.590
 three latest videos receive more than 1000 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.570
 thousand requests skype knows how much it is 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.909
 It's difficult to answer everyone and it 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.369
 difficult she can not escape delphic 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.409
 I stayed a long time just to tighten the 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:53.460
 button to accept the request skype 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:55.290
 so just accept it and it was for sure 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.570
 if I had more time of my life 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.729
 whole just so you can be sure 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.320
 I would only respond because it does not 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.479
 because for those who do not know myself 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.070
 first I thought about that day there more or less 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.260
 at seven o'clock at night six o'clock 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.850
 night but at this time and seven 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.080
 night is well a service time on 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.870
 channel then I have to do 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.790
 record and edit the 7 o'clock 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.160
 Think of something the other day I arrived. 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.170
 when a little time is left of 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.120
 background with six games my friends then is 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.800
 very complicated guys I do not have time 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.540
 No problem, so this video was supposed to warn. 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.850
 If you want to talk to me, do not talk to me. 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.800
 twitter why they did not want to have so much 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.060
 people like I have here on YouTube and 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.680
 twitter man I 'm now 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.480
 talking to all the people who 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.940
 send message was super good 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.370
 I was talking, it's a matter of talking to us there. 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.260
 they will give a focus on the 77 responds 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:43.709
 then on these social networks web jet 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:46.170
 twitter instagram is success i got it 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:48.180
 to respond everyone does not comment on 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.130
 videos I answer everything for example that 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.959
 asks which player lives when 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:54.420
 If you have these things only I will answer 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:56.610
 Everyone, but skype is not really 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.500
 giving people I will not use the 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.870
 24 more because they are not 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.489
 not being able to take care of not take care of not 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.019
 It's okay, everyone. 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:05.580
 To make a deal I'm sad about this. 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:07.650
 To answer, I do not know if I stay too long. 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.510
 happy to get did not answer do not know 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.489
 because I have both written know that 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.200
 so it was very obliging even for who 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:15.330
 It is a car that I have ever you are 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.010
 channel programming is when you have video 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:18.390
 of the good channel here in the rock in rio de 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:20.730
 Monday to Friday from 7 o'clock at night 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:22.410
 Then it runs from Monday to Friday on the channel. 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.880
 who will always have it again and 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.769
 Monday we have a series on 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.269
 last hour of adventure I do not know if 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:29.579
 will continue with the event because it is 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:30.780
 giving problem problems in the series but 

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:33.299
 relax and sleep 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:35.610
 today I thought in a series much the 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:37.470
 old car I thought I was a little 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:39.480
 delayed in this series I lost a year 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:41.430
 and would rather replace painting with 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.500
 this series and then when it solved the 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:45.900
 problem makes the event come back then 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:47.579
