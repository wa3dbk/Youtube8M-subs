this<00:00:36.809> is<00:00:37.020> my<00:00:37.219> 1961<00:00:38.219> Cub<00:00:39.180> Cadet<00:00:39.210> original<00:00:39.989> this

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
this is my 1961 Cub Cadet original this

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.270 
this is my 1961 Cub Cadet original this
is<00:00:40.829> an<00:00:40.920> early<00:00:41.190> 61<00:00:41.760> by<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.180> way<00:00:43.129> but<00:00:44.129> this

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
is an early 61 by the way but this

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.440 
is an early 61 by the way but this
tractor<00:00:44.700> is<00:00:44.870> set<00:00:45.870> up<00:00:46.020> how<00:00:47.180> most<00:00:48.180> of<00:00:48.329> the

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
tractor is set up how most of the

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.889 
tractor is set up how most of the
originals<00:00:48.930> were<00:00:49.489> the<00:00:50.489> PTO<00:00:50.850> setup<00:00:51.270> on<00:00:51.420> original

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
originals were the PTO setup on original

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.729 
originals were the PTO setup on original
is<00:00:52.050> actually<00:00:52.469> fairly<00:00:52.860> rare<00:00:53.719> so<00:00:54.719> more<00:00:55.649> than

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
is actually fairly rare so more than

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.049 
is actually fairly rare so more than
likely<00:00:55.800> you're<00:00:56.250> going<00:00:56.370> to<00:00:56.430> see<00:00:56.640> them<00:00:56.820> set<00:00:57.030> up

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
likely you're going to see them set up

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.400 
likely you're going to see them set up
like<00:00:57.329> this<00:00:58.760> but<00:00:59.760> as<00:01:00.510> you<00:01:00.600> can<00:01:00.719> see<00:01:00.780> it's<00:01:01.140> got

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
like this but as you can see it's got

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.960

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.360 

this<00:01:32.700> tractor<00:01:33.120> has<00:01:33.540> the<00:01:34.020> typical<00:01:34.500> original

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:35.370 
this tractor has the typical original

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:40.310 
this tractor has the typical original
solid<00:01:35.870> front<00:01:36.870> pulley<00:01:37.080> for<00:01:37.500> a<00:01:37.530> mower<00:01:38.960> all<00:01:39.960> your

solid front pulley for a mower all your

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.050 
solid front pulley for a mower all your
engagement<00:01:40.980> for<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.190> mower<00:01:41.340> was<00:01:41.580> done<00:01:41.820> down

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
engagement for the mower was done down

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.950 
engagement for the mower was done down
here<00:01:42.090> on<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:42.540> mower<00:01:42.720> itself<00:01:43.470> with<00:01:43.740> this<00:01:44.960> kick

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
here on the mower itself with this kick

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.490 
here on the mower itself with this kick
lever<00:01:47.540> basically<00:01:48.540> all<00:01:48.750> you<00:01:48.930> did<00:01:49.140> was<00:01:49.170> just

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
lever basically all you did was just

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.660 
lever basically all you did was just
kick<00:01:49.740> that<00:01:49.770> down<00:01:50.190> it<00:01:50.550> slid<00:01:50.910> one<00:01:51.180> of<00:01:51.360> these

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
kick that down it slid one of these

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.970 
kick that down it slid one of these
spindles<00:01:53.670> we're<00:01:54.090> not<00:01:54.240> the<00:01:54.330> spindle<00:01:54.720> but<00:01:54.980> the

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:55.980 
spindles we're not the spindle but the

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:03.800 
spindles we're not the spindle but the
tightener<00:01:58.070> sideways<00:01:59.070> and<00:02:01.100> engaged<00:02:02.100> so<00:02:02.820> your

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
tightener sideways and engaged so your

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.389 
tightener sideways and engaged so your
blades<00:02:04.110> would<00:02:04.410> spin<00:02:05.270> so<00:02:06.890> but<00:02:07.890> that<00:02:08.040> is<00:02:08.220> how

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
blades would spin so but that is how

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.350 
blades would spin so but that is how
most<00:02:09.360> of<00:02:09.600> your<00:02:09.780> originals<00:02:10.320> are<00:02:10.649> going<00:02:10.920> to<00:02:11.130> be

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
most of your originals are going to be

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.800 
most of your originals are going to be
setup<00:02:12.360> because<00:02:12.780> as<00:02:13.080> I<00:02:13.230> said<00:02:13.290> the<00:02:14.330> PTO<00:02:15.330> setup

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
setup because as I said the PTO setup

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.850 
setup because as I said the PTO setup
was<00:02:16.050> actually<00:02:16.710> quite<00:02:17.040> rare<00:02:17.400> but<00:02:18.140> as<00:02:19.140> you<00:02:19.710> can

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
was actually quite rare but as you can

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:25.250 
was actually quite rare but as you can
see<00:02:19.980> here<00:02:20.250> this<00:02:20.400> is<00:02:20.460> a<00:02:21.170> 1963<00:02:22.610> Cub<00:02:23.610> original<00:02:24.450> if

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:16.050 
tractor if you had an original but
another<00:05:11.470> thing<00:05:11.800> is<00:05:12.009> this<00:05:13.979> 63<00:05:14.979> original<00:05:15.490> has

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:16.060 
another thing is this 63 original has

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:19.350 
another thing is this 63 original has
had<00:05:16.419> the<00:05:16.690> engine<00:05:17.139> replaced<00:05:17.530> I<00:05:18.130> ran<00:05:19.120> the<00:05:19.210> serial

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:19.360 
had the engine replaced I ran the serial

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:22.800 
had the engine replaced I ran the serial
number<00:05:19.930> on<00:05:20.110> it<00:05:20.289> when<00:05:20.590> I<00:05:20.620> got<00:05:20.889> it<00:05:21.070> and<00:05:21.810> the

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:22.810 
number on it when I got it and the

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:27.320 
number on it when I got it and the
engine<00:05:23.139> is<00:05:23.289> actually<00:05:23.530> out<00:05:23.949> of<00:05:23.979> a<00:05:24.159> 1969<00:05:25.000> cub<00:05:26.310> so

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:27.330 
engine is actually out of a 1969 cub so

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:30.540 
engine is actually out of a 1969 cub so
that<00:05:28.330> would<00:05:28.479> have<00:05:28.599> been<00:05:28.719> likely<00:05:29.560> out<00:05:29.860> of<00:05:29.979> a<00:05:30.099> cup

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:30.550 
that would have been likely out of a cup

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:33.180 
that would have been likely out of a cup
cadet<00:05:30.789> 73<00:05:31.570> or<00:05:31.900> just<00:05:32.259> a<00:05:32.380> replacement<00:05:32.650> block

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:33.190 
cadet 73 or just a replacement block

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:38.949 
cadet 73 or just a replacement block
even<00:05:36.389> so

00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:38.959 
even so

00:05:38.959 --> 00:05:42.399 
even so
they<00:05:39.499> switch<00:05:39.860> the<00:05:40.189> I<00:05:40.219> know<00:05:41.049> also<00:05:42.049> know<00:05:42.169> it's<00:05:42.319> a

00:05:42.399 --> 00:05:42.409 
they switch the I know also know it's a

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:43.869 
they switch the I know also know it's a
replacement<00:05:42.619> engine<00:05:42.979> because<00:05:43.369> the<00:05:43.489> oil<00:05:43.639> pan

00:05:43.869 --> 00:05:43.879 
replacement engine because the oil pan

00:05:43.879 --> 00:05:45.369 
replacement engine because the oil pan
