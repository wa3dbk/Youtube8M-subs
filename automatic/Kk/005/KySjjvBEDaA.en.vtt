00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 p 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.890
 every time you hear about computers or how a computer works 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:09.979
 computer a immediately they say a kutxa 

00:00:09.979 --> 00:00:12.369
 it has to do with zeros and ones 

00:00:12.369 --> 00:00:15.369
 he has to do with zero what does he mean he has to do with zeros 

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:15.949
 and ones 

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:18.589
 as they have jealousy and a computer 

00:00:18.589 --> 00:00:21.039
 detailed that it will be a convention with you 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:25.529
 for a moment I'm going to move 0 and 1 to have a lamp like the one I have 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.009
 down here and zero when paid and in one the downed guy 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:34.920
 that is to say again serota paid and one this sense 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.670
 so what I'm going to do is show how one can start ao 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.900
 count the amount of possibilities that there is if one has a light bulb aldo 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.520
 abram 40 3 lamps and so on 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:47.760
 count me in 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.340
 in principle if I have a zone light bulb 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:54.760
 has two possibilities cost paid st 0 ' 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.160
 they lack it 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.170
 then add possible states 0 and 1 off and on 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:06.140
 now if instead of a little light bulb they turn into little pans 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.840
 so what are the possible state 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.110
 you can be paying them this is 0 0 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:13.030
 can be 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:15.410
 it's stopped and it's on 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:17.290
 in that case it is zero and one 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:20.909
 1 can be turned on is already pay to eta 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.030
 that one and zero 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.710
 or it can be on lake what is one and one is to say that I have 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:34.360
 four possible status 0 0 0 1 1 to 0 and 1 1 which are all possibilities that 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.890
 could have with the parita zone 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:38.530
 now 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:39.580
 I'm going 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:44.270
 to suppose that I have three lightbulbs then as to possible state I have 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:49.600
 how many number can I represent first ballast extinguished lamps 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.530
 what would be 0 0 0 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:53.990
 Then I have 0 0 1 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:02:00.560
 is to turn this on off off on after I can have 0 1 0 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:01.840
 and then 0 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.630
 eleven 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:04.670
 and then 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.729
 now these four that I had recent because they were like four as if 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.040
 would not have been good would have existed now I do the next one now in being 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.969
 is 

00:02:13.969 --> 00:02:16.749
 and now I have then 1 0 0 

00:02:16.749 --> 00:02:18.599
 1 0 1 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:20.849
 1 1 to 0 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:22.859
 and then 1 1 1 

00:02:22.859 --> 00:02:25.689
 that is, I have eight possibilities 

00:02:25.689 --> 00:02:27.429
 and so on 

00:02:27.429 --> 00:02:31.600
 I have achieved then with a lamp two states 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.140
 with paolo 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:38.500
 four states with three lamps eight states when added now there are with a 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:44.480
 fourth lamp I have sixteen states with five lamps I have 32 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.480
 been and so on 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:50.779
 so 

00:02:50.779 --> 00:02:54.069
 with five lamps are 32 states 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:57.669
 and could represent the numbers from 0 to 31 

00:02:58.929 --> 00:03:00.849
 but how to do it 

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:02.449
 The idea is 

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:04.869
 One light bulb is worth 1 

00:03:04.869 --> 00:03:08.019
 the next one is worth double or 2 

00:03:08.749 --> 00:03:10.929
 The next 

00:03:10.929 --> 00:03:13.419
 what is double the previous 

00:03:13.419 --> 00:03:20.839
 the next one is worth 8 and the next 16 is always saying each Inca lamp doubles 

00:03:20.839 --> 00:03:22.659
 the previous one 

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:23.739
 A) Yes 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:27.229
 if I want to write the number 2 I only read the one that is worth 2 

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:31.849
 but if I wanted to write the number 13 I have to learn the one that is worth 8 cage 

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:36.829
 is worth 4 and the one is worth because 8 plus 4 + 1 stress 

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:39.739
 now I invite you to 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:44.340
 I found that by learning the right light bulbs one can write any 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:49.540
 clear number between 0 and 31 mockus mod 

00:03:53.499 --> 00:03:56.090
 if one had bad quality 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:00.780
 could represent more frank number always making each bulb 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:07.730
 worth double the previous mockus do not believe what you think it is to know 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:10.639
 after watching this part of the program 

00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:13.200
 this binary annotation this way 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:18.030
 depor or yield to interpret with zeros and any number allows 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:22.230
 just that you take any number and you have to be able to write 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:27.310
 with a decomposition of zeros that one or some strip of zeros and some corp a 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:30.590
 only lamp can you write the serial number number one 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:36.100
 with everything it looks civil power 0 the 1 the 2003 if I will tell you tune lamp can 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:41.319
 who lived zerolo one the two the three the four the 5 the 6 and the 7 joseph has eight 

00:04:41.319 --> 00:04:46.169
 and so on what remarkable success is that you are sad that it is estimated that 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:48.220
 it's called binary allows also 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:51.220
 encode text 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:55.669
 we already know how to write with zeros and ones 

00:04:55.669 --> 00:04:58.800
 any number from 0 31 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:03.490
 one could also associate each letter of the alphabet goes one less 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:04.479
 by order 

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:06.129
 it is from 1 

00:05:06.129 --> 00:05:08.129
 the 20 seconds 

00:05:08.129 --> 00:05:10.120
 the letter c three in three 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:11.379
 and so on 

00:05:11.379 --> 00:05:13.120
 until when you get to the z 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.180
 This one has the number 27 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:18.660
 and one could use the number 28 to indicate a blank 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:24.189
 let's take any text for example there was once a cow 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:31.110
 one can rewrite with a sequence of numbers ie the h is 8 

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:33.650
 the letter that number 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:41.090
 the letters b s2 and so next in turn we learned that every number we can not 

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:44.850
 write as zeros and one a combination of zeros and ones 

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:50.380
 and so one can write any text using nothing but the two 

00:05:50.379 --> 00:05:55.940
 digits the senate has a 1 in the field of digital information 

00:05:55.940 --> 00:06:02.130
 I was looking for asserted one is called a pituco and is equivalent more than a bulb 

00:06:02.129 --> 00:06:05.690
 of which we saw before track I comprised of paid water 

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:11.420
 ep the text we just encoded has a length of 5 to 20 for each 

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:16.600
 one of the twenty-two letters as a patient what makes a total of five 

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:19.860
 for 22 bone 110 liters 

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:23.919
 the only one which played on a compact disc for example on a cd 

00:06:23.919 --> 00:06:28.930
 one has a capacity of about five thousand 900 million bits 

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:34.690
 so I imagined this a room with five thousand 900 million lamps 

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:39.120
 that may be putting the food days to adapt and what is more 

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:41.520
 incredible and is that this amount 

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:45.439
 it's enough to write about 1,500 books 

00:06:45.439 --> 00:06:50.499
 about two hundred and fifty pages each how many encyclopedias can fit 

00:06:50.499 --> 00:06:53.669
 then on a CD expte 

00:06:53.669 --> 00:06:59.860
 ap how they are stored digitally with bits ie with zeros and ones 

00:07:00.659 --> 00:07:04.629
 let's take a picture and let's write a grid in singapore 

00:07:04.629 --> 00:07:11.379
 from 50 to 100 to 150 Colombia in each box we look at the color can be 

00:07:11.379 --> 00:07:14.560
 darker or more clear if it is dark 

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:17.570
 we consider it black I take it with irun 

00:07:18.509 --> 00:07:21.860
 on the other hand yes the most clarito we consider it white 

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:24.490
 it remains I take it as a sector 

00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:32.449
 this leaves us a set of 50 by 50 own 2500 mix containing the 

00:07:32.449 --> 00:07:34.629
 basic information about the image 

00:07:34.629 --> 00:07:36.710
 the net forward 

00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:41.789
 I would not like to speak better the magic one possibility would be to duplicate the 

00:07:41.789 --> 00:07:43.860
 number of rows and columns 

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:44.999
 dt grid 

00:07:44.999 --> 00:07:47.580
 and then repeat the procedure 

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:51.919
 knowing that this will require using matrix to store also the 

00:07:51.919 --> 00:07:54.349
 information 

00:07:54.349 --> 00:07:55.270
 that is to say 

00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:55.899
 the corah
