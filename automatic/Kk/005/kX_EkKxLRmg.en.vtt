00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:08.350 
okay we're gonna we're just gonna shoot

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:09.600 
okay we're gonna we're just gonna shoot
a<00:00:08.380> little<00:00:08.590> video<00:00:08.770> about<00:00:08.830> how<00:00:09.340> to<00:00:09.370> do

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:09.610 
a little video about how to do

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:12.749 
a little video about how to do
compression<00:00:10.150> test<00:00:10.360> on<00:00:11.110> a<00:00:11.170> moment

00:00:12.749 --> 00:00:12.759 
compression test on a moment

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:17.560 
compression test on a moment
so<00:00:13.759> we've<00:00:14.420> got<00:00:14.570> a<00:00:14.599> victory<00:00:15.379> top<00:00:15.920> here<00:00:16.330> blue<00:00:17.330> top

so we've got a victory top here blue top

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:20.290 
so we've got a victory top here blue top
for<00:00:17.840> Ag<00:00:18.250> and<00:00:19.250> we're<00:00:19.430> ready<00:00:19.580> pull<00:00:19.789> those<00:00:19.939> spark

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:20.300

eighths adapter to 1800 meters good is

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:15.880 
eighths adapter to 1800 meters good is
it<00:01:14.450> I<00:01:14.630> think<00:01:15.590> so

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
it I think so

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.250 
it I think so
that's<00:01:16.009> what<00:01:16.190> it<00:01:16.250> says<00:01:16.400> on<00:01:16.520> the<00:01:16.690> box<00:01:17.690> so<00:01:17.840> I'm

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:18.260 
that's what it says on the box so I'm

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.039 
that's what it says on the box so I'm
not<00:01:18.409> sure<00:01:18.470> about<00:01:19.400> that<00:01:19.670> the<00:01:20.630> easiest<00:01:20.840> thing<00:01:21.020> to

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:21.049 
not sure about that the easiest thing to

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:22.240 
not sure about that the easiest thing to
do<00:01:21.229> is<00:01:21.260> just<00:01:21.470> take<00:01:21.620> your<00:01:21.680> spark<00:01:21.979> plug<00:01:22.220> and

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:22.250 
do is just take your spark plug and

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.410 
do is just take your spark plug and
match<00:01:22.520> up<00:01:22.700> the<00:01:22.820> threads<00:01:23.090> to<00:01:23.990> be<00:01:24.020> wrong<00:01:25.420> then

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
match up the threads to be wrong then

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:27.700 
match up the threads to be wrong then
you<00:01:26.600> take<00:01:26.810> this<00:01:26.990> guy<00:01:27.229> here

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:27.710 
you take this guy here

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.060 
you take this guy here
put<00:01:28.190> her<00:01:28.280> in<00:01:29.110> basically<00:01:30.110> just<00:01:30.380> thread<00:01:30.770> it<00:01:30.799> into

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070 
put her in basically just thread it into

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.370 
put her in basically just thread it into
the<00:01:31.190> spark<00:01:31.580> plug<00:01:31.790> hole<00:01:31.990> which<00:01:32.990> is<00:01:33.020> what<00:01:33.320> I'm

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
the spark plug hole which is what I'm

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:38.050 
the spark plug hole which is what I'm
doing<00:01:33.530> there<00:01:35.619> okay<00:01:36.650> we<00:01:36.920> threaded<00:01:37.159> her<00:01:37.310> in<00:01:37.490> so

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
doing there okay we threaded her in so

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:39.340 
doing there okay we threaded her in so
now<00:01:38.180> we're<00:01:38.299> just<00:01:38.390> going<00:01:38.540> to<00:01:38.600> crank<00:01:38.900> the<00:01:39.080> engine

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.350 
now we're just going to crank the engine

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.760 
now we're just going to crank the engine
over<00:01:40.299> to<00:01:41.299> test<00:01:41.540> the<00:01:41.630> compression<00:01:42.110> since<00:01:42.650> we

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
over to test the compression since we

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:43.719 
over to test the compression since we
don't<00:01:42.830> have<00:01:42.950> a<00:01:43.070> starter<00:01:43.369> hooked<00:01:43.549> up<00:01:43.700> for

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:43.729 
don't have a starter hooked up for

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:46.030 
don't have a starter hooked up for
anything<00:01:44.030> the<00:01:44.930> only<00:01:45.049> way<00:01:45.229> we<00:01:45.350> can<00:01:45.470> do<00:01:45.619> it<00:01:45.740> is<00:01:45.860> by

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:46.040 
anything the only way we can do it is by

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.740 
anything the only way we can do it is by
a<00:01:46.510> manually<00:01:47.510> crank<00:01:47.720> again<00:01:48.020> so<00:01:48.619> thick<00:01:49.750> it's

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
a manually crank again so thick it's

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.830 
a manually crank again so thick it's
going<00:01:50.780> to<00:01:50.930> take<00:01:51.140> our<00:01:51.610> which<00:01:52.610> call<00:01:52.909> this<00:01:53.060> bridge

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
going to take our which call this bridge

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:54.280 
going to take our which call this bridge
at<00:01:53.960> work

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:54.290 
at work

00:01:54.290 --> 00:02:06.029 
at work
breaker<00:01:54.530> bar<00:01:54.860> and<00:01:55.310> crank<00:01:55.549> the<00:01:55.670> engine<00:01:55.939> around

00:02:06.029 --> 00:02:06.039 

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:10.110 

whoops<00:02:07.039> I<00:02:07.429> push<00:02:07.700> the<00:02:07.880> release<00:02:08.030> pot<00:02:08.470> keep<00:02:09.470> going

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:10.120 
whoops I push the release pot keep going

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:12.250 
whoops I push the release pot keep going
so<00:02:11.120> you<00:02:11.209> can<00:02:11.330> see<00:02:11.510> he's<00:02:11.660> cranking<00:02:12.080> the<00:02:12.170> engine

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
so you can see he's cranking the engine

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.410 
so you can see he's cranking the engine
and<00:02:12.560> on<00:02:12.650> and<00:02:12.860> the<00:02:13.340> compressions<00:02:13.879> coming<00:02:14.180> up<00:02:14.269> on

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
and on and the compressions coming up on

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.509 
and on and the compressions coming up on
the<00:02:14.540> gauge<00:02:14.769> which<00:02:15.769> means<00:02:16.010> that<00:02:16.129> there<00:02:16.280> is<00:02:16.370> good

00:02:16.509 --> 00:02:16.519 
the gauge which means that there is good

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:20.650 
the gauge which means that there is good
compression<00:02:17.000> in<00:02:17.090> that<00:02:17.180> cylinder<00:02:19.510> okay<00:02:20.510> that's

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
compression in that cylinder okay that's

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:21.660 
compression in that cylinder okay that's
good<00:02:20.840> that's<00:02:20.870> good<00:02:21.170> man

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
good that's good man

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.470 
good that's good man
basically<00:02:22.670> that's<00:02:22.879> all<00:02:23.060> there<00:02:23.209> is<00:02:23.299> to<00:02:23.420> know

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
basically that's all there is to know

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.059 
basically that's all there is to know
about<00:02:23.569> how<00:02:23.989> to<00:02:24.049> do<00:02:24.200> compression<00:02:24.680> tests<00:02:24.920> with

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:25.069 
about how to do compression tests with
