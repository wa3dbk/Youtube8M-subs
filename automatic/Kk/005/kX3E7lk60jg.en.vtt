00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:07.170
 hello my name is jean michel I am 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.550
 black pig producer of bigorre and I 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.910
 will explain to you how is cut 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:14.400
 on the essential is to fix it and 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:18.660
 to hold it for that we need a 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:21.630
 claw and a bladed knife that 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.279
 cut very well well sharpened so long 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.650
 instead of cutting ham in general 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:30.179
 we cut the same a ham is constituted 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:33.540
 of several parties we have the knuckle the 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:35.820
 great law which is the quadriceps the 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.430
 little walnut which is the son s is the 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.559
 quasi who actually is the gluteus is in 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.149
 does these four parts of legs in 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.370
 give different aromas 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:47.489
 I started by noah greatness 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:50.329
 is the most fleshy part where we go 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:55.199
 see the biggest cutting table 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:57.750
 and so the interest of having a table 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.840
 always horizontal to be able to do 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:03.149
 the largest possible slices 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:07.140
 the essential difference of the four 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:09.810
 parts are related to the level of fat and 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.479
 of the proximity of the osce for example 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.580
 found in the hock a meat a 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.979
 little stronger in taste a little more 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.509
 many but a little less fine than 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.970
 in the great law or the level of fat 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:23.280
 and more important and where we have a 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.460
 much more subtle balance of lean 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.430
 and of the big in fact the fundamental it is 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.439
 to make trenches 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:32.460
 extremely fine 

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:34.670
 ideally it would be it 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:39.420
 practically not useful at that moment 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:42.509
 the fats that consist of acid 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:45.869
 oleic which are refractory guitars 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.640
 very aromatic and very volatile 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.130
 warms up and are much more 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:53.070
 aromatic tasting 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.950
 in fact these products there obviously 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:58.320
 consumes at room temperature and 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.610
 especially not cold since the cold block 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.140
 all the aromas 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.880
 the advice that I give as well as 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.040
 when you start a ham is that 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.750
 we can the woman and on both sides of the 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.340
 side the great joy of the little law 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.530
 in order to have tasting products 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.030
 very different as now that the 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.010
 cutting of legs we have no more secrets 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:17.840
 for you there is nothing more than to practice 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.840
 try to make it happen
