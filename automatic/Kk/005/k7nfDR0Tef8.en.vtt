00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
check I think it is his legs have three

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:23.390 
check I think it is his legs have three
joints<00:02:18.150> one<00:02:18.780> two<00:02:19.410> three<00:02:21.200> at<00:02:22.200> this<00:02:22.500> point<00:02:22.740> can

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
joints one two three at this point can

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:30.560 
joints one two three at this point can
bend<00:02:23.790> a<00:02:24.090> little<00:02:26.090> this<00:02:27.090> point<00:02:27.420> and<00:02:29.300> less<00:02:30.300> than

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
bend a little this point and less than

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:34.370 
bend a little this point and less than
the<00:02:30.690> other<00:02:30.930> one<00:02:31.370> at<00:02:32.370> this<00:02:32.760> point<00:02:33.000> just<00:02:33.390> swivel

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
the other one at this point just swivel

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.470 
the other one at this point just swivel
360<00:02:35.010> that<00:02:35.490> way<00:02:35.640> you<00:02:35.700> can<00:02:35.970> kind<00:02:36.150> of<00:02:36.240> get<00:02:36.360> his

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
360 that way you can kind of get his

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.990 
360 that way you can kind of get his
foot<00:02:36.750> in<00:02:36.780> some<00:02:37.140> poses<00:02:37.730> same<00:02:38.730> with<00:02:38.880> the<00:02:38.970> other
