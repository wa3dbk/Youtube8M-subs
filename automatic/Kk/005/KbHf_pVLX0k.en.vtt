00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:20.360
 it takes guts to leave the 

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:21.500
 studies how did you do education 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:23.950
 superior is detrimental to the 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.950
 experience 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:28.490
 where you work it is a terminal 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:31.210
 computer that connects to the TV that 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:31.210
 does monitor 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:43.410
 what's the latest technology nobody 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:43.410
 manufactures nothing similar 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.840
 welcome abel computers 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:54.000
 that's all for something you start I think 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:57.979
 that we will start with about 90,000 what 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.979
 You can repeat if you decide to accept me 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:06.570
 fÃ©lix corporate has gone public this 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:08.670
 tomorrow we said what little things 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.450
 the typefaces would be unforgettable 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:15.280
 they are not a long social issue 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:17.110
 and I try to look for a war with ibm 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.270
 I'm out of the impossible since 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:21.909
 started in that garage he tried to build 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:24.900
 apple and they want to remove it if 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:24.900
 you continue on this road 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.040
 You yourself are your worst enemy 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:37.960
 the board is unanimous strip will stop 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:37.960
 be part of this company 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.799
 years after the departure of steve jobs 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.020
 the future of apple computers is in 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:49.280
 Dangers in life can only be done 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.280
 a limited number of things 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.369
 and we will get apple to be again 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:53.369
 cool 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:02:01.110
 for the crazy 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:01.110
 the marginalized what you sell 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.520
 because the people who are 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:06.680
 Crazy enough to access that 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.950
 can change the world are those that 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.950
 they achieve 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.670
 if we are going to do it we have to invent 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:20.610
 some name or paper 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:20.610
 if it's much better than facer computers
