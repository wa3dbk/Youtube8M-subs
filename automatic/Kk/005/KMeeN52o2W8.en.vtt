44 of course the blunderbuss takes a

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:45.759 
44 of course the blunderbuss takes a
long<00:00:44.090> time<00:00:44.120> to<00:00:44.480> reload<00:00:44.960> we<00:00:45.170> know<00:00:45.379> that<00:00:45.559> for<00:00:45.739> a

00:00:45.759 --> 00:00:45.769 
long time to reload we know that for a

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:49.299 
long time to reload we know that for a
fact<00:00:45.829> now<00:00:46.370> um<00:00:46.699> it<00:00:47.000> does<00:00:47.359> kill<00:00:48.140> in<00:00:48.440> one<00:00:48.679> shot<00:00:49.100> at

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:49.309 
fact now um it does kill in one shot at

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:51.549 
fact now um it does kill in one shot at
lowes<00:00:49.550> just<00:00:49.910> like<00:00:50.089> instant<00:00:50.510> kill<00:00:50.719> but<00:00:51.050> it<00:00:51.260> does

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:51.559 
lowes just like instant kill but it does

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:54.250 
lowes just like instant kill but it does
take<00:00:51.800> it<00:00:51.949> an<00:00:52.010> extremely<00:00:52.820> long<00:00:53.149> time<00:00:53.570> to<00:00:53.929> reload

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:54.260 
take it an extremely long time to reload

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.009 
take it an extremely long time to reload
so<00:00:54.440> it's<00:00:54.589> kind<00:00:54.890> of<00:00:55.100> odd<00:00:55.339> not<00:00:55.850> really<00:00:56.179> usable

00:00:57.009 --> 00:00:57.019 
so it's kind of odd not really usable

00:00:57.019 --> 00:00:59.439 
so it's kind of odd not really usable
it's<00:00:57.230> kind<00:00:57.589> of<00:00:57.739> like<00:00:57.980> not<00:00:58.280> practical<00:00:59.120> and<00:00:59.300> the

00:00:59.439 --> 00:00:59.449 
it's kind of like not practical and the

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:01.450 
it's kind of like not practical and the
SVO<00:00:59.839> is<00:00:59.960> a<00:01:00.079> sniper<00:01:00.379> rifle<00:01:00.559> I<00:01:00.920> don't<00:01:01.070> snipe<00:01:01.280> too
