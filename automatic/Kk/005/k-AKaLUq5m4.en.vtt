when you're right into the technical

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.279 
when you're right into the technical
it's<00:00:25.789> a<00:00:25.880> little<00:00:26.060> nerve-racking<00:00:26.630> but<00:00:26.660> this

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:27.289 
it's a little nerve-racking but this

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:29.019 
it's a little nerve-racking but this
gives<00:00:27.560> you<00:00:27.679> time<00:00:28.130> to<00:00:28.160> get<00:00:28.369> your<00:00:28.460> legs<00:00:28.640> going

of<00:01:57.770> rock<00:01:58.040> and<00:01:58.310> you<00:01:58.670> don't<00:01:58.820> realize<00:01:58.970> that<00:01:59.270> every

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
of rock and you don't realize that every

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:00.940 
of rock and you don't realize that every
Rock<00:01:59.630> kind<00:01:59.840> of<00:01:59.900> slows<00:02:00.080> you<00:02:00.200> down<00:02:00.230> cuz<00:02:00.620> there's

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
Rock kind of slows you down cuz there's

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:02.380 
Rock kind of slows you down cuz there's
not<00:02:01.070> much<00:02:01.220> breaking<00:02:01.640> in<00:02:01.730> here<00:02:01.880> but<00:02:02.030> then<00:02:02.120> but

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390 
not much breaking in here but then but

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:04.240 
not much breaking in here but then but
you<00:02:02.480> can't<00:02:02.660> pedal<00:02:03.020> so<00:02:03.230> you<00:02:03.830> basically<00:02:03.980> just

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 
you can't pedal so you basically just

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.670 
you can't pedal so you basically just
have<00:02:04.370> to<00:02:04.430> find<00:02:04.670> the<00:02:04.760> best<00:02:04.910> through<00:02:05.090> this<00:02:05.300> to<00:02:06.050> go

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:06.680 
have to find the best through this to go

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.950 
have to find the best through this to go
forward<00:02:06.890> and<00:02:07.400> that's<00:02:07.490> you<00:02:08.420> can't<00:02:08.600> really<00:02:08.750> see

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:08.960 
forward and that's you can't really see

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:10.210 
forward and that's you can't really see
it<00:02:09.050> when<00:02:09.080> you're<00:02:09.260> going<00:02:09.380> so<00:02:09.590> faster<00:02:09.950> there<00:02:10.070> cuz

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
it when you're going so faster there cuz

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:11.380 
it when you're going so faster there cuz
can't<00:02:10.399> even<00:02:10.520> see<00:02:10.610> their<00:02:10.760> oxygen<00:02:11.120> if<00:02:11.210> you<00:02:11.300> know

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
can't even see their oxygen if you know

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.270 
can't even see their oxygen if you know
exactly<00:02:11.720> where<00:02:11.900> you<00:02:11.990> are<00:02:12.050> and<00:02:12.770> know<00:02:13.010> that<00:02:13.130> that

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.360 

so<00:02:39.360> this<00:02:39.629> spot<00:02:40.260> here<00:02:40.439> was<00:02:40.590> one<00:02:40.709> of<00:02:40.829> the<00:02:40.890> sickest

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
so this spot here was one of the sickest

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.330 
so this spot here was one of the sickest
spots<00:02:41.579> last<00:02:41.849> year<00:02:42.060> he<00:02:42.480> definitely<00:02:42.840> had<00:02:42.930> to<00:02:43.019> be

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
spots last year he definitely had to be

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.920 
spots last year he definitely had to be

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
thing and I don't know whose idea was it

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.860 
thing and I don't know whose idea was it
go<00:02:49.650> make<00:02:49.829> it<00:02:49.860> small<00:02:50.189> and<00:02:50.220> mellow<00:02:50.519> but<00:02:50.870> it's

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
go make it small and mellow but it's

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
still still gonna be fun just not as

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:54.920 
still still gonna be fun just not as
hard<00:02:53.939> as<00:02:53.970> it<00:02:54.060> was<00:02:54.209> last<00:02:54.390> year<00:02:54.569> I<00:02:54.629> think<00:02:54.720> it's

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
hard as it was last year I think it's

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.509 
hard as it was last year I think it's
it's<00:02:55.500> good<00:02:55.620> to<00:02:55.739> have<00:02:55.859> things<00:02:55.980> on<00:02:56.129> tracks<00:02:56.400> that

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519 
it's good to have things on tracks that

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:58.640 
it's good to have things on tracks that
not<00:02:56.670> everybody<00:02:57.030> can<00:02:57.150> jump<00:02:57.390> it<00:02:57.780> separates<00:02:58.470> some

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
not everybody can jump it separates some

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.710 
not everybody can jump it separates some
people<00:02:58.920> and<00:02:59.129> shows<00:02:59.879> you<00:03:00.060> can<00:03:00.180> do<00:03:00.299> it<00:03:00.420> perfect

in race runs and you can just do in

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.660 
in race runs and you can just do in
practice

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
practice

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.190
