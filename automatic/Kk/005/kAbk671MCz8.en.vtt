00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:08.580
 And there, guys, beauty rafael, I'm here. 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.590
 doing but nobody could see the video 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.590
 brings you guys but in this game play I 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.519
 I do not want to comment on the game and I 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.279
 I want to comment, this is something. 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.770
 different is that it is also of the game running 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.859
 only I was playing on the gringo server 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.260
 and had practically only American in the 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.849
 two teams and it's good, at least I think 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.609
 that the South American does not remember having 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.349
 seen many Brazilians but had yes 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.090
 I'll explain what happened. 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.660
 I was there we had been playing 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.399
 not alone and I died for one and see that 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.350
 that business that contains type 1 and 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.300
 I saw that it is to scare away the enemies and 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.480
 when you want to score and lose 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.340
 mnba destroyed but he sought the beauty 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.800
 should be someone who was in the 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.700
 street got me and killed me unintentionally or 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.070
 tried to kill 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.289
 Then I died a second time and it's already premiering. 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.000
 for the same guy to die again is 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.829
 You see, the guy was what he was. 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.949
 doing when I was at the base 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:04.140
 mv side a box of ammo he 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.600
 It was because every time he killed me 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.770
 or kill someone who saw me he was a 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.380
 another case of ammunition was on the side 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:14.100
 and it made me realize something. 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.150
 well this guy was Brazilian and why 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.250
 you ask me that Brazilians 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.290
 Good fps games are very Brazilian. 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.000
 that grinds gringo and I'm not going to lie 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.150
 It's true, Brazilians. It's very true. 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.250
 good playing fpf but this specimen of 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.530
 Brazilians, for the love of God 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.049
 well what happened I saw it was 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.520
 Brazilian and why not what he said 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.619
 and also by his nic that I do not remember 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:38.340
 with which now Amazon scrotum is also 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:41.670
 my, I just thought 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:44.700
 all 64 countries on this map 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:47.640
 The guy who's doing shit is Brazilian. 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.799
 and I was thinking, man this is sad 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.689
 because the Brazilian has a way 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.740
 can be a good fps player is brazilian 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.659
 It's good that she will not lie. 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.130
 when I arrived in the Brazilian hinterland and 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.930
 gringo server I do not want to be the 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.850
 Brazilian has more quality of players 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.560
 good part of the Brazilian players do not 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.750
 they can play better than something that 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.310
 American players and of course it would be 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.290
 This is not always the case. 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.660
 There are times when American people will 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.979
 Brazilian rock, but most of the 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.610
 times I see the boys are 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.440
 playing better face 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:17.350
 we have both in the competitive and 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:21.070
 It is generally known that Brazilians are detonating 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:23.080
 playing only that I noticed in that game that 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:25.120
 the cases that are doing shitty cells 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.380
 that they were Brazilian and they were two guys 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.480
 most probably not only what he had 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.730
 ammunition for him and another that was 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.910
 killing mv and the guy is making the 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.650
 about at least 20 with the mv killing 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:39.160
 the base of the I ask you the 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:41.350
 next kiss kill it's on type 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.790
 where such a guy plays well and 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:45.130
 can kill quite a lot there with a 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:47.650
 retarded at the base is not getting a 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:49.690
 person if he had champion to sin 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.730
 petrona in a corner of the map is still 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:53.560
 doing something but not not 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:55.840
 I was waiting for a team to take that hype. 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:59.950
 while he killed people with his mr. 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:01.420
 and beauty and if there happens some maps but 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.750
 What I was very sad to see is that 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:08.770
 has 64 trapped server 64 site is this 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:11.650
 then 64 by the server and the only faces 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:14.230
 what are you doing a kind of bullshit 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.790
 doing a retarded thing in 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.500
 Brazilians 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.959
 the only two are doing that were 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.560
 Brazilians asked me what 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:23.500
 it is 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:25.330
 to do this to increase the 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.769
 where at least you play the man play 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:29.019
 decently 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:30.640
 if you think you have a face of 50 because 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:32.530
 plays in my life on a basis where 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.299
 no one can get close to had and 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:36.730
 You kill people and take the team. 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:38.739
 there you are good you are through 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:40.840
 cheated if you think so you're not 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:44.080
 not good, you're not even close 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:45.850
 If you 're bad, you 're way below 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:48.070
 being bad so I was very sad 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:49.780
 with that the staff and see what it was were 

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:51.910
 Brazilians who are making it expensive 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:53.650
 and although she liked to wave, I 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:56.080
 I said I said the following in the fucking chat 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:58.450
 they're guys how everything shows that it will be 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:01.090
 They spoil the name of Brazil both in 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:02.440
 games like anything else and knows 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.180
 I was very sad to see that it was 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:07.330
 because it's a shame Brazil has players 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:09.489
 with so much ambition so much rain are 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:12.010
 good and even these guys just like that 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:14.079
 spoil the name is and before the staff 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:15.549
 He says that it was not even October. 

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:17.470
 taught me that I never signed it myself 

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:19.900
 never had an average of that person use 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:22.120
 a server knows one thing to ask the 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:23.919
 sewer but it's just a video with the 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.570
 outburst to talk to you Brazil has 

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:26.020
 many good players have always played with 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:28.660
 enough 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:31.620
 2 which are good too and each one has 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:34.620
 interviews but then a hug even more and 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:34.620
 said
