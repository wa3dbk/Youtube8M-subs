microphone all the way to the a-pillar

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:32.249 
microphone all the way to the a-pillar
here<00:00:30.159> and<00:00:30.480> for<00:00:31.480> that<00:00:31.569> you're<00:00:31.810> going<00:00:31.989> to<00:00:32.050> need

00:00:58.049 --> 00:00:58.059 
enough over here on this side you're

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:02.250 
enough over here on this side you're
going<00:00:58.179> to<00:00:58.239> have<00:00:58.300> to<00:00:58.539> open<00:00:58.870> the<00:00:58.989> door<00:01:01.260> and

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:02.260 
going to have to open the door and

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:09.390 
going to have to open the door and

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:09.400 
remove the cup holder once you remove

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.610 
remove the cup holder once you remove
the<00:01:09.550> cup<00:01:09.730> holder<00:01:10.150> you<00:01:10.270> also<00:01:10.390> have<00:01:11.020> to<00:01:11.200> remove

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:11.620 
the cup holder you also have to remove

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:15.240 
the cup holder you also have to remove
the<00:01:11.860> event<00:01:13.320> so<00:01:14.320> we're<00:01:14.590> going<00:01:14.680> to<00:01:14.800> use<00:01:14.980> our

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:15.250 
the event so we're going to use our

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.230 
the event so we're going to use our
panel<00:01:16.000> removal<00:01:16.330> tool<00:01:16.710> underneath<00:01:17.710> it<00:01:18.100> it<00:01:18.970> just

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.240 
panel removal tool underneath it it just

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:26.190 
panel removal tool underneath it it just
held<00:01:19.480> our<00:01:19.630> clips<00:01:19.990> so<00:01:24.390> so<00:01:25.390> once<00:01:25.600> you<00:01:25.780> remove<00:01:25.900> it

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:26.200 
held our clips so so once you remove it

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.400 
held our clips so so once you remove it
just<00:01:26.440> put<00:01:26.620> it<00:01:26.740> to<00:01:26.830> the<00:01:26.950> side<00:01:27.250> and<00:01:28.090> now<00:01:28.450> you<00:01:28.750> can

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:29.410 
just put it to the side and now you can

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:32.430 
just put it to the side and now you can
close<00:01:29.590> the<00:01:29.830> door<00:01:30.480> so<00:01:31.480> basically<00:01:31.900> you<00:01:32.170> already

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:32.440 
close the door so basically you already

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.710 
close the door so basically you already
have<00:01:32.650> a<00:01:32.680> route<00:01:33.070> to<00:01:33.490> feed<00:01:34.000> the<00:01:34.150> wire<00:01:34.330> through

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:34.720 
have a route to feed the wire through

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:40.860 
have a route to feed the wire through
here<00:01:34.780> and<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:36.490> a-pillar<00:01:37.080> and<00:01:38.080> grab<00:01:38.320> it<00:01:39.480> on<00:01:40.480> top

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:40.870 
here and the a-pillar and grab it on top

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:45.510 
here and the a-pillar and grab it on top
and<00:01:41.760> move<00:01:42.760> it<00:01:42.910> to<00:01:43.060> the<00:01:43.210> side<00:01:43.450> so<00:01:43.990> that's<00:01:44.520> more

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520 
and move it to the side so that's more

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.420 
and move it to the side so that's more
than<00:01:45.730> enough<00:01:46.000> to<00:01:46.240> feed<00:01:46.690> the<00:01:46.810> wire<00:01:47.190> after<00:01:48.190> here

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:48.430 
than enough to feed the wire after here

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:50.100 
than enough to feed the wire after here
so<00:01:48.940> we're<00:01:49.060> going<00:01:49.180> to<00:01:49.270> take<00:01:49.510> the<00:01:49.660> wire<00:01:49.840> and

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110 
so we're going to take the wire and

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.940 
so we're going to take the wire and
start<00:01:51.040> from<00:01:51.520> the<00:01:52.360> inside<00:01:52.540> where<00:01:53.170> your<00:01:53.350> GJ<00:01:53.710> car

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
start from the inside where your GJ car

00:01:53.950 --> 00:02:04.000 
start from the inside where your GJ car
kit<00:01:54.130> is

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:04.010 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:19.580 

let's<00:02:05.010> eat<00:02:05.190> the<00:02:05.340> wire<00:02:05.550> through<00:02:05.760> here<00:02:18.440> and<00:02:19.440> the

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
let's eat the wire through here and the

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:29.150 
let's eat the wire through here and the
feed<00:02:19.860> it<00:02:19.980> behind<00:02:21.110> your<00:02:22.110> cup<00:02:22.380> holder<00:02:28.160> also

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
feed it behind your cup holder also

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:40.850 
feed it behind your cup holder also
behind<00:02:29.910> this<00:02:30.150> black<00:02:30.780> panel<00:02:31.200> over<00:02:31.350> here<00:02:39.800> so<00:02:40.800> I'm

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
behind this black panel over here so I'm

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.210 
behind this black panel over here so I'm
just<00:02:40.920> trying<00:02:41.340> to<00:02:41.610> do<00:02:41.790> it<00:02:41.820> quickly<00:02:42.240> but<00:02:42.810> you

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
just trying to do it quickly but you

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:48.949 
just trying to do it quickly but you
should<00:02:44.220> take<00:02:44.400> your<00:02:44.580> time<00:02:44.790> with<00:02:45.000> it<00:02:47.900> so<00:02:48.900> it

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
should take your time with it so it

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:52.430 
should take your time with it so it
should<00:02:49.170> look<00:02:49.380> something<00:02:49.440> like<00:02:50.130> this<00:02:51.290> I'm<00:02:52.290> over

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
should look something like this I'm over

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.410 
should look something like this I'm over
here<00:02:52.860> you<00:02:53.250> just<00:02:53.400> got<00:02:53.550> to<00:02:53.700> take<00:02:53.820> your<00:02:53.880> time<00:02:54.060> and

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
here you just got to take your time and

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.550 
here you just got to take your time and
tuck<00:02:54.600> the<00:02:54.750> wire<00:02:54.930> back<00:02:55.230> and<00:02:57.320> it's<00:02:58.320> of<00:02:58.470> course

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
tuck the wire back and it's of course

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:04.600 
tuck the wire back and it's of course
shouldn't<00:02:59.130> hang<00:02:59.370> this<00:02:59.670> much<00:03:00.050> so<00:03:01.050> just<00:03:02.660> enough

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:04.610 
shouldn't hang this much so just enough

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:07.370 
shouldn't hang this much so just enough
not<00:03:05.610> to<00:03:05.760> be<00:03:05.910> jammed<00:03:06.239> and<00:03:06.510> make<00:03:06.690> sure<00:03:06.930> once<00:03:07.230> you

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
not to be jammed and make sure once you

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.560 
not to be jammed and make sure once you
feed<00:03:07.590> the<00:03:07.739> wire<00:03:07.920> that<00:03:08.220> is<00:03:08.280> not<00:03:09.150> going<00:03:09.330> to<00:03:09.390> get

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570 
feed the wire that is not going to get

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:11.240 
feed the wire that is not going to get
