called<00:00:17.900> Blue<00:00:18.140> Lake<00:00:18.380> pull<00:00:18.650> beans<00:00:18.890> they're

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:19.160 
called Blue Lake pull beans they're

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.280 
called Blue Lake pull beans they're
supposed<00:00:19.460> to<00:00:19.580> grow<00:00:19.730> to<00:00:19.790> six<00:00:20.090> feet<00:00:20.390> but<00:00:20.810> somehow

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:21.290 
supposed to grow to six feet but somehow

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:23.500 
supposed to grow to six feet but somehow
I<00:00:21.470> end<00:00:21.830> up<00:00:21.950> with<00:00:22.100> a<00:00:22.130> variety<00:00:22.640> that<00:00:22.670> because

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:23.510 
I end up with a variety that because

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:25.180 
I end up with a variety that because
this<00:00:23.720> is<00:00:23.780> six<00:00:24.170> feet<00:00:24.320> here<00:00:24.620> so<00:00:24.860> these<00:00:25.010> guys

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:25.190 
this is six feet here so these guys

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:27.190 
this is six feet here so these guys
usually<00:00:25.640> go<00:00:25.760> to<00:00:25.820> seven<00:00:26.210> and<00:00:26.360> then<00:00:26.960> I<00:00:27.020> have

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:27.200 
usually go to seven and then I have

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.840 
usually go to seven and then I have
10-foot<00:00:27.740> trellises<00:00:28.250> over<00:00:28.490> there<00:00:28.640> that

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:28.850 
10-foot trellises over there that

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:31.630 
10-foot trellises over there that
they're<00:00:29.030> way<00:00:29.270> up<00:00:29.750> above<00:00:29.900> so<00:00:30.160> whole<00:00:31.160> beans<00:00:31.400> need

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:31.640 
they're way up above so whole beans need

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.400 
they're way up above so whole beans need
something<00:00:32.090> to<00:00:32.210> climb<00:00:32.450> on<00:00:32.750> something<00:00:33.170> fairly

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:33.410 
something to climb on something fairly

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.590 
something to climb on something fairly
strong<00:00:33.860> as<00:00:34.160> you<00:00:34.249> can<00:00:34.370> see<00:00:34.579> this<00:00:34.820> one's<00:00:35.030> tipping

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:35.600 
strong as you can see this one's tipping

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.619 
strong as you can see this one's tipping
over<00:00:35.749> and<00:00:36.140> it<00:00:36.199> was<00:00:36.289> pretty<00:00:36.499> strong<00:00:36.800> and<00:00:37.629> they

00:00:38.619 --> 00:00:38.629 
over and it was pretty strong and they

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:40.060 
over and it was pretty strong and they
climb<00:00:38.899> and<00:00:39.079> they<00:00:39.140> climb<00:00:39.320> and<00:00:39.499> they<00:00:39.559> climb<00:00:39.800> and

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:40.070 
climb and they climb and they climb and

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.689 
climb and they climb and they climb and
then<00:00:40.249> when<00:00:40.519> they<00:00:40.640> start<00:00:40.969> to<00:00:41.120> set<00:00:41.359> flowers

00:00:42.689 --> 00:00:42.699 
then when they start to set flowers

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:46.239 
then when they start to set flowers
ready<00:00:43.699> your<00:00:43.909> canning<00:00:44.269> jars<00:00:44.829> they<00:00:45.829> start<00:00:46.129> with

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:46.249 
ready your canning jars they start with

00:00:46.249 --> 00:00:48.399 
ready your canning jars they start with
white<00:00:46.460> flowers<00:00:46.999> and<00:00:47.329> then<00:00:47.480> as<00:00:47.780> the<00:00:48.050> flowers

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:48.409 
white flowers and then as the flowers

00:00:48.409 --> 00:00:50.229 
white flowers and then as the flowers
turn<00:00:48.679> yellow<00:00:49.069> they<00:00:49.280> start<00:00:49.519> to<00:00:49.670> shrivel<00:00:49.909> and

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:50.239 
turn yellow they start to shrivel and

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:52.270 
turn yellow they start to shrivel and
the<00:00:50.719> baby<00:00:50.899> bean<00:00:51.170> starts<00:00:51.589> to<00:00:51.769> form<00:00:52.010> and<00:00:52.190> then

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:52.280 
the baby bean starts to form and then

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.040 
the baby bean starts to form and then
it's<00:00:52.399> about<00:00:52.519> a<00:00:52.699> week<00:00:53.210> depending<00:00:53.870> on<00:00:53.960> the

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.050 
it's about a week depending on the

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:55.059 
it's about a week depending on the
weather<00:00:54.199> then<00:00:54.469> you<00:00:54.559> can<00:00:54.710> start<00:00:54.949> harvesting

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:55.069 
weather then you can start harvesting

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:57.040 
weather then you can start harvesting
about<00:00:55.579> a<00:00:55.609> week<00:00:55.879> after<00:00:56.239> those<00:00:56.420> flowers<00:00:56.780> start

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.050 
about a week after those flowers start

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.799 
about a week after those flowers start
to<00:00:57.170> shrivel<00:00:57.379> and<00:00:58.030> then<00:00:59.030> they<00:00:59.149> keep<00:00:59.329> yielding

00:00:59.799 --> 00:00:59.809 
to shrivel and then they keep yielding

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:01.869 
to shrivel and then they keep yielding
practically<00:01:00.409> until<00:01:00.769> Frost<00:01:01.069> if<00:01:01.460> you<00:01:01.670> keep

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:01.879 
practically until Frost if you keep

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:06.249 
practically until Frost if you keep
picking<00:01:02.329> they<00:01:02.569> keep<00:01:02.780> yielding<00:01:05.110> this<00:01:06.110> is

00:01:06.249 --> 00:01:06.259 
picking they keep yielding this is

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:08.410 
picking they keep yielding this is
probably<00:01:06.649> a<00:01:06.740> little<00:01:06.950> bit<00:01:07.189> young<00:01:07.460> for<00:01:07.759> a

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:08.420 
probably a little bit young for a

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:09.880 
probably a little bit young for a
harvestable<00:01:08.780> bean<00:01:08.990> but<00:01:09.200> I'll<00:01:09.259> pick<00:01:09.409> it<00:01:09.560> anyway

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.890 
harvestable bean but I'll pick it anyway

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.520 
harvestable bean but I'll pick it anyway
with<00:01:10.420> harvestable<00:01:11.420> green<00:01:11.719> bean<00:01:11.930> I<00:01:12.140> try<00:01:12.469> and

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:12.530 
with harvestable green bean I try and

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:14.469 
with harvestable green bean I try and
use<00:01:12.649> two<00:01:12.829> hands<00:01:13.130> and<00:01:13.490> I<00:01:14.000> have<00:01:14.119> my<00:01:14.270> nifty

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:14.479 
use two hands and I have my nifty

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:17.980 
use two hands and I have my nifty
hands-free<00:01:15.490> the<00:01:16.490> cart<00:01:16.759> here<00:01:17.149> if<00:01:17.539> I<00:01:17.689> had<00:01:17.869> to

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
hands-free the cart here if I had to

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:19.660 
hands-free the cart here if I had to
have<00:01:18.110> one<00:01:18.259> hand<00:01:18.530> holding<00:01:18.890> the<00:01:19.039> basket<00:01:19.490> it

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 
have one hand holding the basket it

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.779 
have one hand holding the basket it
would<00:01:19.820> just<00:01:20.000> be<00:01:20.149> too<00:01:20.329> challenging<00:01:20.799> and<00:01:21.799> so<00:01:22.759> I

00:01:22.779 --> 00:01:22.789 
would just be too challenging and so I

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:24.730 
would just be too challenging and so I
start<00:01:23.329> with<00:01:23.570> the<00:01:23.630> ones<00:01:23.930> that<00:01:24.020> are<00:01:24.110> closer<00:01:24.409> into

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
start with the ones that are closer into

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.039 
start with the ones that are closer into
the<00:01:24.860> stem<00:01:25.130> the<00:01:26.060> stem<00:01:26.119> of<00:01:26.420> the<00:01:26.450> plant<00:01:26.630> because

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:27.049 
the stem the stem of the plant because

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:29.080 
the stem the stem of the plant because
they're<00:01:27.380> bigger<00:01:27.619> and<00:01:28.070> I<00:01:28.520> leave<00:01:28.729> the<00:01:28.939> little

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
they're bigger and I leave the little

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.190 
they're bigger and I leave the little
babies<00:01:29.829> those<00:01:30.829> are<00:01:31.039> kind<00:01:31.219> of<00:01:31.280> too<00:01:31.460> small<00:01:32.200> for

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
babies those are kind of too small for

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.450 
babies those are kind of too small for
some<00:01:33.350> the<00:01:33.409> higher<00:01:33.649> ones<00:01:33.890> here<00:01:34.159> I'm<00:01:34.280> getting

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
some the higher ones here I'm getting

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:39.550 
some the higher ones here I'm getting
two<00:01:34.789> at<00:01:34.909> a<00:01:34.969> time<00:01:35.210> they're<00:01:37.930> usually<00:01:38.930> they<00:01:39.289> start

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
two at a time they're usually they start

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.010 
two at a time they're usually they start
to<00:01:39.680> ripen<00:01:39.890> from<00:01:40.250> the<00:01:40.369> bottom<00:01:40.880> of<00:01:41.119> the<00:01:41.450> plant<00:01:41.689> up

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
to ripen from the bottom of the plant up

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.830 
to ripen from the bottom of the plant up
so<00:01:42.439> make<00:01:42.829> sure<00:01:43.070> that<00:01:43.430> you<00:01:43.609> take<00:01:44.390> a<00:01:44.420> good<00:01:44.659> look

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
so make sure that you take a good look

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.149 
so make sure that you take a good look
down<00:01:45.109> there<00:01:45.320> oh<00:01:45.500> there's<00:01:45.859> some<00:01:47.140> and<00:01:48.159> something

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:49.159 
down there oh there's some and something

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:52.289 
down there oh there's some and something
I<00:01:49.250> found<00:01:49.549> about<00:01:49.729> pole<00:01:50.090> beans<00:01:50.299> last<00:01:50.600> year<00:01:51.079> is

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:52.299 
I found about pole beans last year is

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:55.060 
I found about pole beans last year is
they<00:01:53.299> can<00:01:53.570> they<00:01:53.810> don't<00:01:53.990> need<00:01:54.229> so<00:01:54.530> many<00:01:54.679> leaves

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.070 
they can they don't need so many leaves

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.870 
they can they don't need so many leaves
most<00:01:55.579> plants<00:01:56.060> obviously<00:01:56.570> the<00:01:56.780> leaves

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
most plants obviously the leaves

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.520 
most plants obviously the leaves
photosynthesize<00:01:58.880> for<00:01:59.149> the<00:01:59.240> plant<00:01:59.509> but<00:01:59.749> you

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
photosynthesize for the plant but you

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:02.080 
photosynthesize for the plant but you
don't<00:02:00.710> need<00:02:00.950> to<00:02:01.130> worry<00:02:01.369> about<00:02:01.490> this<00:02:01.850> many

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
don't need to worry about this many

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.480 
don't need to worry about this many
leaves<00:02:02.390> so<00:02:02.719> I'm<00:02:03.020> started<00:02:03.469> snapping<00:02:04.039> the<00:02:04.159> extra

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
leaves so I'm started snapping the extra

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.370 
leaves so I'm started snapping the extra
leaves<00:02:04.640> off<00:02:04.880> that<00:02:05.149> block<00:02:05.450> my<00:02:05.749> view<00:02:06.020> of<00:02:06.259> the

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
leaves off that block my view of the

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.800 
leaves off that block my view of the
beans<00:02:06.590> I<00:02:07.060> snapped<00:02:08.060> them<00:02:08.240> off<00:02:08.360> so<00:02:08.539> I<00:02:08.570> can<00:02:08.780> see

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
beans I snapped them off so I can see

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:10.419 
beans I snapped them off so I can see
the<00:02:09.080> beans<00:02:09.259> better<00:02:09.470> and<00:02:09.679> then<00:02:09.770> I<00:02:09.860> feed<00:02:10.159> those

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
the beans better and then I feed those

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:13.080 
the beans better and then I feed those
leads<00:02:10.789> to<00:02:11.000> my<00:02:11.120> goats

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
leads to my goats

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.740 
leads to my goats
and<00:02:13.470> that<00:02:14.470> also<00:02:14.849> exposes<00:02:15.849> the<00:02:15.970> bean<00:02:16.180> plant<00:02:16.540> to

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
and that also exposes the bean plant to

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
and that also exposes the bean plant to
more<00:02:16.930> Sun<00:02:17.260> which<00:02:17.860> speeds<00:02:18.670> up<00:02:18.819> the<00:02:18.880> ripening

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
more Sun which speeds up the ripening

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.110 
more Sun which speeds up the ripening
here's<00:02:20.770> a<00:02:20.830> good<00:02:21.069> here's<00:02:21.340> a<00:02:21.400> good<00:02:21.550> branch<00:02:21.819> with

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
here's a good here's a good branch with

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.130 
here's a good here's a good branch with
let's<00:02:22.420> see<00:02:22.569> two<00:02:22.989> four<00:02:23.560> six<00:02:23.860> eight<00:02:24.069> ten<00:02:24.190> twelve

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
let's see two four six eight ten twelve

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.559 
let's see two four six eight ten twelve
possibly<00:02:26.140> fourteen<00:02:26.680> beans<00:02:26.980> on<00:02:27.250> one<00:02:27.430> branch<00:02:27.730> so

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:28.569 
possibly fourteen beans on one branch so

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:30.660 
possibly fourteen beans on one branch so
I<00:02:28.840> could<00:02:29.110> grab<00:02:29.230> all<00:02:29.560> of<00:02:29.739> those<00:02:29.860> and<00:02:30.160> go<00:02:30.250> yank

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
I could grab all of those and go yank

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.520 
I could grab all of those and go yank
but<00:02:31.060> I<00:02:31.090> would<00:02:31.300> risk<00:02:31.540> snapping<00:02:32.170> it<00:02:32.260> from<00:02:32.440> the

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
but I would risk snapping it from the

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:35.370 
but I would risk snapping it from the
stem<00:02:32.940> so<00:02:33.940> again<00:02:34.480> I'm<00:02:34.690> just<00:02:34.720> going<00:02:34.900> to<00:02:35.019> hold<00:02:35.230> it

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
stem so again I'm just going to hold it

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:43.290 
stem so again I'm just going to hold it
carefully<00:02:37.019> I'll<00:02:38.019> leave<00:02:38.230> those<00:02:38.440> guys<00:02:42.300> these

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.300 
carefully I'll leave those guys these

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.559 
carefully I'll leave those guys these
are<00:02:43.569> about<00:02:43.900> as<00:02:44.170> big<00:02:44.410> as<00:02:44.470> I<00:02:44.860> like<00:02:45.160> to<00:02:45.519> to<00:02:46.330> pick

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:46.569 
are about as big as I like to to pick

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:48.300 
are about as big as I like to to pick
and<00:02:46.780> use<00:02:47.049> if<00:02:47.380> they<00:02:47.500> get<00:02:47.650> much<00:02:47.799> bigger<00:02:48.100> than

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
and use if they get much bigger than

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:48.570 
and use if they get much bigger than
that

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
that

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.940 
that
I<00:02:48.790> might<00:02:48.970> feed<00:02:49.209> them<00:02:49.360> to<00:02:49.480> my<00:02:49.510> goats<00:02:49.900> or<00:02:50.319> just

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
I might feed them to my goats or just

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:52.500 
I might feed them to my goats or just
kind<00:02:51.130> of<00:02:51.160> chew<00:02:51.370> on<00:02:51.519> them<00:02:51.670> for<00:02:51.850> myself<00:02:52.239> in<00:02:52.420> the

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
kind of chew on them for myself in the

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.350 
kind of chew on them for myself in the
garden<00:02:52.840> if<00:02:53.470> I<00:02:53.920> were<00:02:54.069> putting<00:02:54.310> these<00:02:54.790> beans<00:02:55.150> if

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
garden if I were putting these beans if

garden if I were putting these beans if
I<00:02:55.450> were<00:02:55.600> picking<00:02:55.870> for<00:02:56.019> customers<00:02:56.470> right<00:02:56.739> now<00:02:56.769> I

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
I were picking for customers right now I

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:58.949 
I were picking for customers right now I
would<00:02:57.730> have<00:02:57.760> second<00:02:58.239> thoughts<00:02:58.269> about<00:02:58.569> putting

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
would have second thoughts about putting

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:00.660 
would have second thoughts about putting
those<00:02:59.110> in<00:02:59.440> my<00:02:59.620> bags<00:02:59.860> because<00:03:00.400> they're<00:03:00.580> going

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
those in my bags because they're going

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.640 
those in my bags because they're going
to<00:03:00.730> be<00:03:00.819> kind<00:03:01.060> of<00:03:01.150> tough<00:03:01.390> and<00:03:01.420> woody<00:03:01.840> they're

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
to be kind of tough and woody they're

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:03.690 
to be kind of tough and woody they're
still<00:03:02.980> okay

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
still okay

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.670 
still okay
but<00:03:04.269> they're<00:03:04.599> definitely<00:03:04.810> getting<00:03:05.230> that's

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680

height of beans season sometimes I shake
the<00:03:37.209> plant<00:03:37.480> a<00:03:37.660> little<00:03:37.959> bit<00:03:38.140> because<00:03:38.380> beans

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:38.859 
the plant a little bit because beans

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:40.199 
the plant a little bit because beans
wiggle<00:03:39.340> in<00:03:39.430> a<00:03:39.519> different<00:03:39.819> way<00:03:39.910> than<00:03:40.090> the

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:44.309 
leaves do I have to do that with my peas
too<00:03:42.480> sometimes<00:03:43.480> I'll<00:03:43.630> be<00:03:43.720> looking<00:03:44.109> and<00:03:44.230> it's

00:03:44.309 --> 00:03:44.319 
too sometimes I'll be looking and it's

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:45.750 
too sometimes I'll be looking and it's
like<00:03:44.470> I<00:03:44.590> don't<00:03:44.769> see<00:03:44.889> any<00:03:45.010> more<00:03:45.220> and<00:03:45.400> you<00:03:45.459> shake

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
like I don't see any more and you shake

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.699 
like I don't see any more and you shake
it<00:03:45.790> and<00:03:46.239> sometimes<00:03:46.959> something<00:03:47.139> Wiggles<00:03:47.560> I'm

it and sometimes something Wiggles I'm
