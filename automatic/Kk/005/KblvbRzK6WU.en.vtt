control<00:00:58.530> analyzer<00:00:59.190> we<00:00:59.789> eliminated<00:01:00.390> all<00:01:00.510> the

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
control analyzer we eliminated all the

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
little peaks and spikes on the system

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.929 
little peaks and spikes on the system
and<00:01:03.539> what<00:01:03.960> happened<00:01:04.290> was<00:01:04.439> before<00:01:05.250> when<00:01:05.820> I<00:01:05.850> was

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.190 
and what happened was before when I was
driving<00:01:06.240> down<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.390> road<00:01:06.510> with<00:01:06.840> my<00:01:06.960> top<00:01:07.170> down

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
driving down the road with my top down

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.670 
driving down the road with my top down
and<00:01:07.590> I<00:01:07.619> turned<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:08.040> radio<00:01:08.340> up<00:01:08.549> loud<00:01:08.970> I<00:01:09.680> would

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
get little guitar riffs that just

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.990 
get little guitar riffs that just
cleaned<00:01:12.810> my<00:01:12.900> ears<00:01:13.229> out<00:01:13.530> I'd<00:01:13.950> get<00:01:14.340> bass<00:01:14.700> notes

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
that jumped out of the mix and boomed

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.840 
that jumped out of the mix and boomed
and<00:01:17.909> distorted<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:18.689> speakers<00:01:19.110> and<00:01:19.409> I<00:01:19.850> could

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
and distorted the speakers and I could

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.429 
and distorted the speakers and I could
tell<00:01:21.000> things<00:01:21.299> weren't<00:01:21.479> right<00:01:21.659> but<00:01:21.900> after<00:01:22.049> Jeff

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
tell things weren't right but after Jeff

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.800 
tell things weren't right but after Jeff
got<00:01:22.650> through<00:01:23.000> it<00:01:24.000> was<00:01:24.180> a<00:01:24.210> complete

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
got through it was a complete

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
transformation and I could take turn the

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.859 
transformation and I could take turn the
system<00:01:28.290> up<00:01:28.439> to<00:01:28.939> very<00:01:29.939> high<00:01:30.150> volume<00:01:30.540> levels
