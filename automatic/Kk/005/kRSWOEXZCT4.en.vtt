00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:58.040 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.450 

so<00:01:59.040> it's<00:01:59.220> a<00:01:59.280> little<00:01:59.460> quiet<00:02:00.410> but<00:02:01.410> we<00:02:01.980> can<00:02:02.190> raise

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
so it's a little quiet but we can raise

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.650 
so it's a little quiet but we can raise
that<00:02:02.490> with<00:02:02.940> our<00:02:03.120> preamp<00:02:05.240> what<00:02:06.240> I<00:02:06.270> always<00:02:06.420> like

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:06.660 
that with our preamp what I always like

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:08.120 
that with our preamp what I always like
to<00:02:06.750> do<00:02:06.870> with<00:02:06.990> this<00:02:07.110> plugin<00:02:07.350> first<00:02:07.710> is<00:02:07.920> just

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 
to do with this plugin first is just

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:09.950 
to do with this plugin first is just
pump<00:02:08.850> that<00:02:09.000> treble<00:02:09.330> and<00:02:09.420> see<00:02:09.570> how<00:02:09.630> it<00:02:09.780> sounds

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:09.960 
pump that treble and see how it sounds

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:13.880 
pump that treble and see how it sounds
and<00:02:10.550> this<00:02:11.550> sounds<00:02:11.910> really<00:02:12.060> good<00:02:12.300> I<00:02:12.450> think<00:02:12.890> this

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
and this sounds really good I think this

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.330 
and this sounds really good I think this
is<00:02:14.120> down<00:02:15.500> I'm<00:02:16.500> just<00:02:16.620> gonna<00:02:16.830> turn<00:02:17.070> it<00:02:17.130> up

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
is down I'm just gonna turn it up

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.070 
is down I'm just gonna turn it up
without<00:02:17.670> talking<00:02:18.270> so<00:02:18.450> you<00:02:18.570> can<00:02:18.690> hear<00:02:18.840> it's

the way I always you know tell myself i

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.910 
the way I always you know tell myself i
mean<00:02:37.420> i'm<00:02:37.510> using<00:02:37.540> headphones<00:02:37.750> right<00:02:38.260> now<00:02:38.440> so<00:02:38.650> i

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
mean i'm using headphones right now so i

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.890 
mean i'm using headphones right now so i
always<00:02:39.340> tell<00:02:39.550> myself<00:02:39.700> back<00:02:40.270> off<00:02:40.480> just<00:02:40.720> a

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
always tell myself back off just a

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.400 
always tell myself back off just a
little<00:02:40.930> bit<00:02:41.910> so<00:02:42.910> it<00:02:43.570> is<00:02:43.600> backed<00:02:43.900> off<00:02:44.080> a<00:02:44.170> tiny

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
little bit so it is backed off a tiny

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:48.300 
little bit so it is backed off a tiny
bit<00:02:45.300> and<00:02:46.300> since<00:02:46.540> it<00:02:46.690> is<00:02:46.840> kind<00:02:47.350> of<00:02:47.470> a<00:02:47.590> dark<00:02:47.920> sound

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
bit and since it is kind of a dark sound

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.690 
bit and since it is kind of a dark sound
i<00:02:48.790> know<00:02:49.660> that<00:02:49.810> three<00:02:50.140> hundred<00:02:50.320> and<00:02:51.220> sort<00:02:51.490> of<00:02:51.580> be

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
i know that three hundred and sort of be

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.310 
i know that three hundred and sort of be
a<00:02:51.730> problem<00:02:52.240> in<00:02:52.360> the<00:02:52.450> room<00:02:52.840> i<00:02:52.990> record<00:02:53.380> it<00:02:53.470> in

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
a problem in the room i record it in

00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:01.190 
a problem in the room i record it in
take<00:02:56.320> that<00:02:56.530> out<00:02:56.740> a<00:02:56.770> little<00:02:56.980> bit<00:02:57.100> so<00:02:59.550> this<00:03:00.550> is

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
take that out a little bit so this is

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.020 
take that out a little bit so this is
with<00:03:02.200> the<00:03:02.320> 300<00:03:02.830> go<00:03:03.340> ahead<00:03:03.460> and<00:03:03.580> turn<00:03:03.730> that<00:03:03.760> up

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
with the 300 go ahead and turn that up

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.180 
with the 300 go ahead and turn that up
you<00:03:04.510> can<00:03:04.570> see<00:03:04.660> how<00:03:04.810> that's<00:03:05.020> that<00:03:05.470> can<00:03:05.590> be<00:03:05.680> maybe

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
you can see how that's that can be maybe

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:11.850 
you can see how that's that can be maybe
a<00:03:06.280> little<00:03:06.340> bit<00:03:06.610> of<00:03:06.700> a<00:03:06.760> problem<00:03:10.560> take<00:03:11.560> it<00:03:11.680> out<00:03:11.830> a

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860 
a little bit of a problem take it out a

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:13.920 
a little bit of a problem take it out a
little<00:03:12.040> bit<00:03:12.280> make<00:03:12.730> up<00:03:12.910> a<00:03:13.060> little<00:03:13.240> bit<00:03:13.450> for<00:03:13.660> free

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
little bit make up a little bit for free

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:17.340 
little bit make up a little bit for free
at<00:03:14.110> the<00:03:14.140> preamp<00:03:15.240> and<00:03:16.240> let's<00:03:16.900> add<00:03:17.050> a<00:03:17.080> little

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:17.350 
at the preamp and let's add a little

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:21.479 
at the preamp and let's add a little
bass

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:21.489 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:25.540 

so<00:03:22.489> we<00:03:22.579> can<00:03:22.670> hear<00:03:22.819> that<00:03:23.079> left<00:03:24.079> hand

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:25.550 
so we can hear that left hand

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:29.060 
so we can hear that left hand
plugging<00:03:26.550> away<00:03:26.640> there<00:03:27.000> and<00:03:27.320> also<00:03:28.320> something

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.070 
plugging away there and also something

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:32.240 
plugging away there and also something
else<00:03:29.250> it's<00:03:30.000> always<00:03:30.270> nice<00:03:30.480> to<00:03:30.510> do<00:03:30.980> turn<00:03:31.980> on<00:03:32.100> the

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
else it's always nice to do turn on the

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.970 
else it's always nice to do turn on the
filter<00:03:32.720> that's<00:03:33.720> all<00:03:33.930> the<00:03:34.050> way<00:03:34.140> up<00:03:34.350> at<00:03:34.620> 300

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
filter that's all the way up at 300

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:40.510 
filter that's all the way up at 300
that's<00:03:35.460> of<00:03:35.640> course<00:03:35.850> that's<00:03:35.970> too<00:03:36.180> high<00:03:36.360> but

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:40.520 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:44.810 

that's<00:03:41.520> about<00:03:41.790> good<00:03:42.300> you<00:03:43.050> do<00:03:43.200> that<00:03:43.410> because<00:03:43.820> it

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.820 
that's about good you do that because it

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:48.560 
that's about good you do that because it
can<00:03:44.970> be<00:03:45.060> some<00:03:45.330> sort<00:03:45.360> of<00:03:45.660> subsonic<00:03:46.410> or<00:03:46.800> just<00:03:47.570> sub

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:48.570 
can be some sort of subsonic or just sub

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:52.340 
can be some sort of subsonic or just sub
harmonic<00:03:49.140> content<00:03:49.890> to<00:03:50.670> an<00:03:51.600> instrument<00:03:52.110> like

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.350 
harmonic content to an instrument like

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:55.400 
harmonic content to an instrument like
piano<00:03:52.860> because<00:03:53.070> there's<00:03:53.340> so<00:03:53.460> much<00:03:54.410> mechanisms

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
piano because there's so much mechanisms

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:57.890 
piano because there's so much mechanisms
going<00:03:55.830> on<00:03:56.010> and<00:03:56.310> the<00:03:56.400> pedal<00:03:56.730> can<00:03:56.940> also<00:03:57.060> cause

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
going on and the pedal can also cause

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.440 
going on and the pedal can also cause
some<00:03:58.200> sort<00:03:58.440> of<00:03:58.530> low<00:03:58.800> frequency<00:03:59.790> stuff<00:04:00.060> that

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
some sort of low frequency stuff that

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:04.220 
some sort of low frequency stuff that
sort<00:04:01.140> of<00:04:01.260> gum<00:04:01.440> up<00:04:01.590> the<00:04:01.620> works<00:04:01.740> in<00:04:02.550> a<00:04:02.700> mix<00:04:03.230> okay

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
sort of gum up the works in a mix okay

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.790 
sort of gum up the works in a mix okay
so<00:04:04.290> after<00:04:04.860> messing<00:04:05.250> around<00:04:05.370> for<00:04:05.820> a<00:04:06.000> little<00:04:06.150> bit

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:06.800 
so after messing around for a little bit

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:11.240 
so after messing around for a little bit
we<00:04:07.800> got<00:04:08.010> a<00:04:08.040> nice<00:04:08.630> sounding<00:04:09.630> piano<00:04:10.170> but<00:04:11.040> it

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
we got a nice sounding piano but it

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:14.330 
we got a nice sounding piano but it
sounds<00:04:11.670> nice<00:04:11.880> so<00:04:12.360> lowered<00:04:12.630> swing<00:04:12.930> so<00:04:13.890> what<00:04:14.250> I'm

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
sounds nice so lowered swing so what I'm

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:15.949 
sounds nice so lowered swing so what I'm
gonna<00:04:14.430> do<00:04:14.670> is<00:04:14.880> just<00:04:14.910> gonna<00:04:15.240> solo<00:04:15.510> it<00:04:15.780> and

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
gonna do is just gonna solo it and

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:17.570 
gonna do is just gonna solo it and
listen<00:04:16.260> to<00:04:16.380> the<00:04:16.590> mix<00:04:16.769> and<00:04:16.950> maybe<00:04:17.160> you<00:04:17.400> mess

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:17.580 
listen to the mix and maybe you mess

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:34.180 
listen to the mix and maybe you mess
with<00:04:17.700> the<00:04:17.820> EQ<00:04:18.090> a<00:04:18.150> little<00:04:18.330> bit

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:34.190 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:37.060 

so<00:04:34.790> the<00:04:35.000> trouble<00:04:35.360> was<00:04:36.080> a<00:04:36.110> little<00:04:36.440> much<00:04:36.620> with

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.070 
so the trouble was a little much with

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:38.620 
so the trouble was a little much with
all<00:04:37.310> the<00:04:37.460> other<00:04:37.610> instruments<00:04:38.090> sort<00:04:38.540> of

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:38.630 
all the other instruments sort of

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:40.660 
all the other instruments sort of
getting<00:04:38.960> a<00:04:39.050> little<00:04:39.260> crowded<00:04:39.650> up<00:04:39.920> there<00:04:39.950> backed

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:40.670 
getting a little crowded up there backed

00:04:40.670 --> 00:05:03.150 
getting a little crowded up there backed
off<00:04:40.850> on<00:04:41.000> that<00:04:41.090> a<00:04:41.150> little<00:04:41.300> bit

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:03.160 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:12.620 

and<00:05:03.610> like<00:05:03.760> a<00:05:03.790> little<00:05:03.940> more<00:05:04.150> face

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:12.630 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:17.420 

so<00:05:13.250> thanks<00:05:14.250> to<00:05:14.280> our<00:05:15.320> low<00:05:16.320> cut<00:05:16.710> filter<00:05:16.740> there

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:17.430 
so thanks to our low cut filter there

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:23.350 
so thanks to our low cut filter there
doesn't<00:05:18.120> get<00:05:18.270> to<00:05:18.770> to<00:05:19.770> buoy

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:23.360

so I'm going to go ahead and
turn<00:05:26.819> the<00:05:26.909> EQI

00:05:29.649 --> 00:05:29.659 

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:34.740 

and

do you bring that trouble up a little
more<00:05:37.069> just<00:05:37.340> to<00:05:37.490> sort<00:05:37.699> of<00:05:38.020> give<00:05:39.020> you<00:05:39.110> that

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:42.080 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:46.880 

exaggerated<00:05:44.570> EQ<00:05:45.570> so<00:05:46.080> they<00:05:46.200> can<00:05:46.380> actually<00:05:46.650> hear

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:46.890 
exaggerated EQ so they can actually hear

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:51.140 
exaggerated EQ so they can actually hear
a<00:05:47.070> little<00:05:47.400> bit<00:05:47.490> better<00:05:47.670> what<00:05:47.940> it's<00:05:48.060> doing

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:51.150 

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:53.390 

I<00:05:51.240> think<00:05:51.780> in<00:05:51.870> particular<00:05:52.170> the<00:05:52.560> biggest<00:05:53.160> thing

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:53.400 
I think in particular the biggest thing

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:55.700 
I think in particular the biggest thing
that's<00:05:54.210> happening<00:05:54.720> is<00:05:54.870> when<00:05:55.110> I<00:05:55.140> turn<00:05:55.230> the<00:05:55.440> EQ

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:55.710 
that's happening is when I turn the EQ

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:57.800 
that's happening is when I turn the EQ
on<00:05:55.770> just<00:05:56.190> listen<00:05:56.310> to<00:05:56.580> how<00:05:56.700> the<00:05:56.760> the<00:05:57.450> mid-range

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:57.810 
on just listen to how the the mid-range

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:09.860 
on just listen to how the the mid-range
of<00:05:58.050> figures<00:05:58.530> up

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:09.870 

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:12.560 

it's<00:06:10.320> definitely<00:06:10.470> a<00:06:10.710> big<00:06:10.860> improvement<00:06:11.570> so

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:12.570 
it's definitely a big improvement so

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:13.850 
it's definitely a big improvement so
bringing<00:06:13.169> out<00:06:13.320> some<00:06:13.500> of<00:06:13.590> that<00:06:13.620> mid-range

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:13.860 
bringing out some of that mid-range

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:17.810 
bringing out some of that mid-range
because<00:06:14.490> it<00:06:14.610> was<00:06:14.699> so<00:06:14.850> pronounced<00:06:15.690> in<00:06:16.490> in<00:06:17.490> that

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:17.820 
because it was so pronounced in in that

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:19.430 
because it was so pronounced in in that
particular<00:06:18.000> recording<00:06:18.900> brought<00:06:19.139> down<00:06:19.320> the

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:19.440 
particular recording brought down the

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:21.680 
particular recording brought down the
volume<00:06:19.620> a<00:06:19.830> lot<00:06:19.979> and<00:06:20.250> perceived<00:06:21.150> volume<00:06:21.479> so

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:21.690 
volume a lot and perceived volume so

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:23.360 
volume a lot and perceived volume so
bringing<00:06:22.169> up<00:06:22.410> that<00:06:22.530> treble<00:06:22.919> and<00:06:23.040> that<00:06:23.130> bass

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:23.370 
bringing up that treble and that bass

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:26.360 
bringing up that treble and that bass
really<00:06:23.669> helped<00:06:24.090> in<00:06:25.010> bringing<00:06:26.010> the<00:06:26.070> piano

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:26.370 
really helped in bringing the piano

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:29.000 
really helped in bringing the piano
forward<00:06:26.820> and<00:06:27.060> without<00:06:27.360> mudding<00:06:27.720> the<00:06:28.470> those

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:29.010 
forward and without mudding the those

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:31.550 
forward and without mudding the those
middle<00:06:29.310> frequencies<00:06:29.820> so<00:06:30.240> that's<00:06:30.449> the<00:06:31.320> way<00:06:31.440> it

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:31.560 
middle frequencies so that's the way it

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:33.260 
middle frequencies so that's the way it
happened<00:06:32.150> here

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:33.270 
happened here

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:35.870 
happened here
with<00:06:33.419> the<00:06:33.570> Neve<00:06:33.750> 1073<00:06:34.620> from<00:06:34.860> you<00:06:35.310> ad<00:06:35.580> running
