00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:10.299 
more you turn the wheel the faster it

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:17.720 
more you turn the wheel the faster it
goes<00:02:12.180> really<00:02:13.180> nice<00:02:14.760> to<00:02:15.760> open<00:02:15.910> the<00:02:16.180> bucket<00:02:16.599> I

highlight function one and two at the

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:30.539 
highlight function one and two at the
same<00:02:22.720> time<00:02:27.600> just<00:02:28.600> activated<00:02:29.290> it<00:02:29.549> press

and<00:02:37.739> I'm<00:02:38.739> gonna<00:02:38.920> bring<00:02:43.079> the<00:02:44.079> jib<00:02:52.470> exactly<00:02:53.470> how

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
and I'm gonna bring the jib exactly how

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.339 
and I'm gonna bring the jib exactly how
it<00:02:53.739> works<00:02:53.950> well<00:02:54.450> as<00:02:55.450> you<00:02:55.690> can<00:02:55.810> see<00:02:55.870> on<00:02:56.200> the<00:02:56.319> e

00:02:56.339 --> 00:02:56.349 
it works well as you can see on the e

00:02:56.349 --> 00:03:03.780 
it works well as you can see on the e
coughs<00:03:00.239> just<00:03:01.239> stop<00:03:01.480> it<00:03:01.660> there<00:03:01.690> that's<00:03:02.530> it<00:03:02.799> and

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
coughs just stop it there that's it and

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:08.949 
coughs just stop it there that's it and
see<00:03:04.090> swing<00:03:04.690> it<00:03:04.840> around

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:08.959 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:14.050 

there<00:03:09.379> we<00:03:09.500> go<00:03:09.680> so<00:03:11.200> just<00:03:12.200> power<00:03:12.500> up<00:03:12.700> faster<00:03:13.700> go

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
there we go so just power up faster go

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:26.789 
there we go so just power up faster go
faster<00:03:15.549> it<00:03:16.549> turns<00:03:19.510> and<00:03:20.510> it<00:03:20.659> works<00:03:20.900> obviously

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:26.799 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:32.920 

stop<00:03:27.799> it<00:03:27.980> always<00:03:28.219> bring<00:03:28.639> it<00:03:28.879> back<00:03:31.599> we<00:03:32.599> can<00:03:32.780> work

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
stop it always bring it back we can work

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:38.759 
stop it always bring it back we can work
it<00:03:33.680> out<00:03:33.799> same<00:03:34.310> so<00:03:34.639> oh<00:03:35.090> yeah<00:03:36.019> you<00:03:36.079> can

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:38.769 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:45.220 

there<00:03:39.769> you<00:03:39.889> can<00:03:40.040> leave<00:03:41.049> multiple<00:03:42.049> tasks<00:03:44.230> with

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:45.230 
there you can leave multiple tasks with

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:49.330 
there you can leave multiple tasks with
it<00:03:45.379> so<00:03:46.310> probably<00:03:47.060> best<00:03:47.590> wiring<00:03:48.590> a<00:03:48.680> joystick<00:03:49.129> up

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
it so probably best wiring a joystick up

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.459 
it so probably best wiring a joystick up
to<00:03:49.489> it<00:03:49.639> on<00:03:49.900> an<00:03:50.900> interface<00:03:51.409> to<00:03:52.099> control<00:03:52.489> it

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:53.469 
to it on an interface to control it

00:03:53.469 --> 00:03:57.240 
to it on an interface to control it
really<00:03:54.469> well<00:03:55.090> it's<00:03:56.090> quite<00:03:56.269> well<00:03:56.450> on<00:03:56.510> the<00:03:56.719> other

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
really well it's quite well on the other

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:05.319 
really well it's quite well on the other
and<00:03:58.250> the<00:03:59.120> ëcoz<00:03:59.480> so<00:04:01.090> that's<00:04:03.700> the<00:04:04.700> home<00:04:04.879> for<00:04:05.180> that

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:05.329 
and the ëcoz so that's the home for that

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:14.099 
and the ëcoz so that's the home for that
is<00:04:05.540> gonna<00:04:05.900> go<00:04:07.750> into<00:04:10.569> this<00:04:11.569> area<00:04:11.840> here

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:14.109 
is gonna go into this area here

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:19.990 
is gonna go into this area here
shoveling<00:04:15.699> the<00:04:16.699> old<00:04:16.880> gravel<00:04:18.579> and<00:04:19.579> that

problem in the Sun Oven sinking Matt
just<00:05:05.360> derail<00:05:05.810> so<00:05:06.430> move<00:05:07.430> the<00:05:07.550> points<00:05:07.880> out<00:05:08.030> the

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:08.180 
just derail so move the points out the

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:10.570 
just derail so move the points out the
tunnel<00:05:08.570> taking<00:05:09.440> the<00:05:09.530> T<00:05:09.740> points<00:05:10.159> out<00:05:10.340> and

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:10.580 
tunnel taking the T points out and

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:14.170 
tunnel taking the T points out and
replaced<00:05:11.000> it'll<00:05:11.389> double<00:05:11.479> slip<00:05:11.870> here<00:05:12.110> I<00:05:13.180> moved

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:14.180 
replaced it'll double slip here I moved

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:17.800 
replaced it'll double slip here I moved
that<00:05:14.770> left<00:05:15.770> and<00:05:16.009> point<00:05:16.340> was<00:05:16.880> here<00:05:17.180> and<00:05:17.659> now

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:17.810 
that left and point was here and now

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:21.490 
that left and point was here and now
that's<00:05:18.050> there<00:05:18.289> so<00:05:18.669> that<00:05:19.669> enables<00:05:20.150> any<00:05:21.139> train

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:21.500 
that's there so that enables any train

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:23.159 
that's there so that enables any train

00:05:23.159 --> 00:05:23.169

back out to the main lines you know

00:05:41.569 --> 00:05:46.059 
back out to the main lines you know
whatever<00:05:41.860> so<00:05:42.860> I<00:05:42.949> can<00:05:43.129> win<00:05:43.550> trains<00:05:45.069> quite

00:05:46.059 --> 00:05:46.069 
whatever so I can win trains quite

00:05:46.069 --> 00:05:47.739 
whatever so I can win trains quite
nicely<00:05:46.310> no<00:05:46.669> so<00:05:46.939> anyway<00:05:47.360> that's<00:05:47.479> another

00:05:47.739 --> 00:05:47.749 
nicely no so anyway that's another

00:05:47.749 --> 00:05:49.659 
nicely no so anyway that's another
update<00:05:47.960> I<00:05:48.379> shall<00:05:48.740> give<00:05:48.860> another<00:05:49.069> update<00:05:49.310> on

00:05:49.659 --> 00:05:49.669 
update I shall give another update on

00:05:49.669 --> 00:05:53.020 
update I shall give another update on
the<00:05:50.029> crane<00:05:50.330> when<00:05:50.749> its<00:05:50.840> installed
