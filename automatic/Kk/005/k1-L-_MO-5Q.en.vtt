00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.750
 Dom that is so here who said the filters you can adjust infinitely 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.649
 the whole thing is a joke with me that just looks like that 

00:00:12.649 --> 00:00:15.699
 here at the side you have a mark 

00:00:15.699 --> 00:00:18.800
 Max minimum and maximum and then yes is one 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.169
 Milled in point 

00:00:21.169 --> 00:00:25.199
 then you can give the stop regulate the strength that you can is here 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.219
 Of course, it is really correct where exactly what will happen then 

00:00:28.219 --> 00:00:28.949
 dark 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.419
 that is why there is a second part but to this principle here is the 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:34.660
 entire the to the objective 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:38.230
 is fixed and then here one can simply get the strength of 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:41.740
 advantage is obvious obvious I have to get it 

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:43.800
 not five different light situations that time and again 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.470
 was missing in the fourth and again switch to the 8 our on I have 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:49.270
 that's all with a filter 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:51.700
 excellently solved 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.190
 the Tea Party of painting 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.190
 So prepare here 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:59.870
 adjust the strength 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.110
 in the second part they then also what then this filter is fun and indeed 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.400
 just as the tiered muse looks exactly 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.930
 Steffen it further applies this infinitely adjustable in height 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.270
 his practice has what you have chosen on the internet and the better 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:15.030
 able to see 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.960
 for the current year 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.220
 Minimum Isenstedter holding her in front of the lens then is outside knowing such a thing 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.870
 a bit what happens 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:26.090
 and so far one is rejecting all this here way stands her life 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.410
 three jumped out of darker and they also see 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:33.860
 Nordic wanted him to be a novel black to the viewers, too 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:37.330
 until he returns 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.350
 stepless you can also adjust 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.160
 here again demonstration 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.060
 Whistler Hong Kong 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.200
 or Anke nothing at all goes that was that I did not do while that brings yes 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.200
 nothing but they look stepless so here is the 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.720
 Honesty thanks to a strong increase not what is swallowed the advantage 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.030
 is obvious 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.360
 Chairman no longer so I can use the emissions in the multitude open with 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.100
 Outdoor shots do not usually do something bad for a long time 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.020
 and that also has the advantage that you can 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.209
 it answers looks and of course also financial reports and also 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:12.119
 gas 

00:02:12.119 --> 00:02:15.469
 you know that nature flowing water fountain and so on 

00:02:15.469 --> 00:02:15.689
 and so on
