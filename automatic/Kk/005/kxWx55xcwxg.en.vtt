00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
actually wanted to build a house but of

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.619 
actually wanted to build a house but of
course<00:00:58.109> that's<00:00:58.710> not<00:00:58.980> possible<00:00:59.219> anymore<00:01:02.629> die

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
course that's not possible anymore die

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.520 
course that's not possible anymore die
creepers<00:01:04.199> die

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.810 

the<00:01:08.530> way<00:01:08.680> this<00:01:08.860> works<00:01:09.040> is<00:01:09.220> pretty<00:01:09.520> simple

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:09.820 
the way this works is pretty simple

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.570 
the way this works is pretty simple
first<00:01:10.630> of<00:01:10.810> all<00:01:10.900> what<00:01:11.110> we<00:01:11.290> have<00:01:11.410> here<00:01:11.710> is<00:01:11.860> a<00:01:12.220> very

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:12.580 
first of all what we have here is a very

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:16.740 
first of all what we have here is a very
fast<00:01:13.000> Phil<00:01:13.540> clock<00:01:14.170> and<00:01:14.440> that<00:01:15.310> basically<00:01:15.750> fills

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:16.750 
fast Phil clock and that basically fills

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:19.410 
fast Phil clock and that basically fills
this<00:01:17.290> space<00:01:17.800> here<00:01:18.130> with<00:01:18.490> redstone<00:01:18.880> blocks<00:01:19.210> and

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:19.420 
this space here with redstone blocks and

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.490 
this space here with redstone blocks and
air<00:01:19.690> and<00:01:20.010> all<00:01:21.010> the<00:01:21.280> time<00:01:21.780> 20<00:01:22.780> times<00:01:22.990> a<00:01:23.140> second

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:23.500 
air and all the time 20 times a second

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:28.560 
air and all the time 20 times a second
this<00:01:24.070> is<00:01:24.250> an<00:01:24.820> ultra<00:01:25.240> full<00:01:25.420> clock<00:01:25.720> and<00:01:27.240> then<00:01:28.240> we

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:28.570 
this is an ultra full clock and then we

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:30.810 
this is an ultra full clock and then we
have<00:01:28.750> some<00:01:29.320> command<00:01:29.980> blocks<00:01:30.190> attached<00:01:30.520> to<00:01:30.730> it

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:30.820 
have some command blocks attached to it

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:32.760 
have some command blocks attached to it
at<00:01:31.120> first<00:01:31.480> this<00:01:31.750> command<00:01:32.110> block<00:01:32.410> gets

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
at first this command block gets

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.360 
at first this command block gets
executed<00:01:33.030> what<00:01:34.030> it<00:01:34.180> does<00:01:34.330> it<00:01:34.740> runs<00:01:35.740> in<00:01:35.920> execute

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:36.370 
executed what it does it runs in execute

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:40.020 
executed what it does it runs in execute
command<00:01:36.730> for<00:01:37.030> every<00:01:37.300> creeper<00:01:38.070> that<00:01:39.070> makes<00:01:39.790> him

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:40.030 
command for every creeper that makes him

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:42.060 
command for every creeper that makes him
summon<00:01:40.630> with<00:01:40.840> a<00:01:40.869> skull<00:01:41.229> a<00:01:41.410> hundred<00:01:41.800> blocks

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840 
there is still a creeper around because

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:43.589 
there is still a creeper around because
that<00:04:38.440> creeper<00:04:38.949> is<00:04:39.430> are<00:04:40.000> going<00:04:40.330> to<00:04:40.889> kill<00:04:42.599> where

00:04:43.589 --> 00:04:43.599 
that creeper is are going to kill where

00:04:43.599 --> 00:04:46.020 
that creeper is are going to kill where
is<00:04:43.720> it<00:04:43.870> that<00:04:44.440> creeper<00:04:44.770> is<00:04:44.860> going<00:04:45.070> to<00:04:45.190> kill<00:04:45.520> the

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:46.030 
is it that creeper is going to kill the

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:49.230 
is it that creeper is going to kill the
detector<00:04:46.599> whenever<00:04:47.380> it's<00:04:47.560> in<00:04:47.680> radius<00:04:48.130> when<00:04:49.090> it

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:49.240 
detector whenever it's in radius when it

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.750 
detector whenever it's in radius when it
has<00:04:49.389> a<00:04:49.419> tick<00:04:49.690> score<00:04:49.960> of<00:04:50.050> one<00:04:50.470> so<00:04:50.979> if<00:04:51.280> that<00:04:51.580> does

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:51.760 
has a tick score of one so if that does

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:53.670 
has a tick score of one so if that does
not<00:04:51.789> happen<00:04:52.030> it's<00:04:52.479> going<00:04:52.630> to<00:04:52.720> be<00:04:52.870> set<00:04:53.050> to<00:04:53.080> 2<00:04:53.440> and

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680 
not happen it's going to be set to 2 and

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.159 
not happen it's going to be set to 2 and
in<00:04:54.310> the<00:04:54.460> next<00:04:54.669> chick<00:04:55.210> it's<00:04:55.449> going<00:04:55.720> to<00:04:55.900> spawn

00:04:56.159 --> 00:04:56.169 
in the next chick it's going to spawn

00:04:56.169 --> 00:04:58.409 
in the next chick it's going to spawn
that<00:04:56.349> explosion<00:04:56.740> so<00:04:57.430> whenever<00:04:57.729> there<00:04:58.150> is<00:04:58.180> no

00:04:58.409 --> 00:04:58.419 
that explosion so whenever there is no

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:00.360 
that explosion so whenever there is no
creep<00:04:58.690> around<00:04:58.840> to<00:04:59.409> remove<00:04:59.770> the<00:04:59.949> wither<00:05:00.130> skull

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:00.370 
creep around to remove the wither skull

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:02.399 
creep around to remove the wither skull
again<00:05:00.639> in<00:05:00.820> the<00:05:01.000> next<00:05:01.180> tick<00:05:01.510> there's<00:05:02.020> going<00:05:02.289> to

00:05:02.399 --> 00:05:02.409 
again in the next tick there's going to

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:04.860 
again in the next tick there's going to
be<00:05:02.440> an<00:05:02.620> explosion<00:05:03.280> and<00:05:03.449> this<00:05:04.449> is<00:05:04.570> basically

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:04.870 
be an explosion and this is basically

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:07.379 
be an explosion and this is basically
how<00:05:04.960> it<00:05:05.050> works<00:05:05.320> so<00:05:05.560> I<00:05:05.740> just<00:05:06.010> spawn<00:05:06.370> it<00:05:06.520> and<00:05:06.699> that

00:05:07.379 --> 00:05:07.389 
how it works so I just spawn it and that

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:09.719 
how it works so I just spawn it and that
with<00:05:07.599> the<00:05:07.720> scouts<00:05:07.900> all<00:05:08.169> the<00:05:08.440> time<00:05:08.710> now<00:05:08.889> but<00:05:09.099> if

00:05:09.719 --> 00:05:09.729 
with the scouts all the time now but if

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:12.590 
with the scouts all the time now but if
I<00:05:10.120> kill<00:05:11.020> that<00:05:11.199> creeper

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:12.600 
I kill that creeper

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:16.070 
I kill that creeper
um<00:05:13.340> there<00:05:14.340> was<00:05:14.550> no<00:05:14.790> creeper<00:05:15.240> to<00:05:15.420> remove<00:05:15.870> the

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:16.080 
um there was no creeper to remove the

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.260 
um there was no creeper to remove the
wither<00:05:16.290> skull<00:05:16.620> and<00:05:16.950> do<00:05:17.820> with<00:05:17.970> the<00:05:18.060> skull

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:18.270 
wither skull and do with the skull

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:20.390 
wither skull and do with the skull
simply<00:05:18.630> spawned<00:05:19.590> that<00:05:19.770> creeper<00:05:20.130> with<00:05:20.280> the

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:20.400 
simply spawned that creeper with the

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.490 
simply spawned that creeper with the
explosion<00:05:20.970> I<00:05:21.120> hope<00:05:21.840> that's<00:05:22.080> not<00:05:22.260> too

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:22.500 
explosion I hope that's not too

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:23.840 
explosion I hope that's not too
