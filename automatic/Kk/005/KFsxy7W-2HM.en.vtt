there isn't any change there and now for
the<00:04:58.070> probably<00:04:59.070> one<00:04:59.190> of<00:04:59.220> the<00:04:59.370> most<00:04:59.550> interesting

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.150 
the probably one of the most interesting

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:06.790 
the probably one of the most interesting
added<00:05:01.100> scenarios<00:05:02.270> dark<00:05:03.270> continent<00:05:04.729> which<00:05:05.729> um

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:06.800 
added scenarios dark continent which um

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:15.290 
added scenarios dark continent which um
basically<00:05:08.450> the<00:05:09.710> black<00:05:10.710> death<00:05:11.070> has<00:05:13.100> killed<00:05:14.300> all

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:15.300 
basically the black death has killed all

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:23.360 
basically the black death has killed all
of<00:05:15.360> Europe<00:05:16.910> yes<00:05:17.910> and<00:05:21.740> what<00:05:22.740> this<00:05:22.889> scenario

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:23.370 
of Europe yes and what this scenario

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:26.629 
of Europe yes and what this scenario
pretty<00:05:23.880> much<00:05:24.060> does<00:05:24.330> it<00:05:24.360> it's<00:05:24.900> it's<00:05:25.770> you<00:05:26.250> it

00:05:26.629 --> 00:05:26.639 
pretty much does it it's it's you it

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:29.330 
pretty much does it it's it's you it
makes<00:05:26.970> Europe<00:05:27.510> you<00:05:28.260> have<00:05:28.410> to<00:05:28.530> colonize<00:05:28.979> Europe

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:29.340 
makes Europe you have to colonize Europe

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:31.909 
makes Europe you have to colonize Europe
luckily<00:05:30.000> most<00:05:30.660> of<00:05:30.840> the<00:05:30.960> forts<00:05:31.410> are<00:05:31.650> still

00:05:31.909 --> 00:05:31.919 
luckily most of the forts are still

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:36.110 
luckily most of the forts are still
there<00:05:32.130> so<00:05:32.539> yeah<00:05:33.539> and<00:05:33.860> you<00:05:34.860> have<00:05:34.979> all<00:05:35.120> Scotland

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:36.120 
there so yeah and you have all Scotland

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:38.600 
there so yeah and you have all Scotland
around<00:05:36.630> some<00:05:36.780> islands<00:05:37.229> and<00:05:37.440> Norway's<00:05:37.919> there

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:38.610 
around some islands and Norway's there

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:42.310 
around some islands and Norway's there
and<00:05:39.110> some<00:05:40.110> small<00:05:40.440> states<00:05:40.770> which<00:05:41.010> do<00:05:41.310> grow<00:05:41.580> out

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:42.320 
and some small states which do grow out

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:44.270 
and some small states which do grow out
there<00:05:43.320> were<00:05:43.440> issues<00:05:43.620> with<00:05:43.830> them<00:05:44.130> not

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:44.280 
there were issues with them not

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:47.120 
there were issues with them not
colonizing<00:05:45.000> I<00:05:45.120> believe<00:05:45.389> but<00:05:46.169> I<00:05:46.470> guess<00:05:47.099> that's

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:47.130 
colonizing I believe but I guess that's

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:53.420 
colonizing I believe but I guess that's
fixed<00:05:50.270> so<00:05:51.270> basically<00:05:51.660> it's<00:05:51.960> the<00:05:52.050> role<00:05:52.950> of<00:05:52.979> be

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:53.430 
fixed so basically it's the role of be

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:57.020 
fixed so basically it's the role of be
of<00:05:53.669> the<00:05:54.770> Muslim<00:05:55.770> states<00:05:56.130> to<00:05:56.400> recolonize

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:57.030 
of the Muslim states to recolonize

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:03.290 
of the Muslim states to recolonize
Europe<00:05:57.840> and<00:05:59.450> also<00:06:00.650> America<00:06:01.650> is<00:06:01.830> has<00:06:02.789> a<00:06:03.000> lot

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:03.300
