00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:26.869 
comments saying if you could do kind of
like<00:03:23.940> a<00:03:24.000> GTA<00:03:24.449> style<00:03:24.989> Grand<00:03:25.799> Theft<00:03:25.859> Auto<00:03:26.159> where

00:03:26.869 --> 00:03:26.879 
like a GTA style Grand Theft Auto where

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:28.399 
like a GTA style Grand Theft Auto where
you<00:03:26.970> can<00:03:27.120> be<00:03:27.239> like<00:03:27.389> switched<00:03:27.750> from<00:03:27.900> one<00:03:28.169> player

00:03:28.399 --> 00:03:28.409 
you can be like switched from one player

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:30.080 
you can be like switched from one player

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:39.419 
at this one part let's see what

00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:41.780 
at this one part let's see what
Nightwing's<00:03:39.780> going<00:03:40.049> to<00:03:40.169> switch<00:03:40.799> to<00:03:41.099> Nightwing

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
Nightwing's going to switch to Nightwing

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:43.280 
Nightwing's going to switch to Nightwing
see<00:03:42.090> what<00:03:42.239> he's<00:03:42.359> doing<00:03:42.419> maybe<00:03:42.810> switch<00:03:43.079> to

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
see what he's doing maybe switch to

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.589 
see what he's doing maybe switch to
Robin<00:03:43.709> and<00:03:43.919> then<00:03:44.129> maybe<00:03:44.340> to<00:03:44.519> Catwoman<00:03:45.030> I<00:03:45.180> think

00:03:45.589 --> 00:03:45.599 
Robin and then maybe to Catwoman I think

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:47.659 
Robin and then maybe to Catwoman I think
that'd<00:03:45.720> be<00:03:45.810> pretty<00:03:45.930> interesting<00:03:46.590> will<00:03:47.519> that

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:47.669
