00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
the end the video but let's go into

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.569 
the end the video but let's go into
buying<00:01:39.930> books<00:01:40.170> because<00:01:40.500> this<00:01:40.650> is<00:01:40.799> the<00:01:41.070> perhaps

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
buying books because this is the perhaps

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.730 
buying books because this is the perhaps
the<00:01:41.790> best<00:01:42.060> bit<00:01:42.270> of<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.479> update<00:01:42.780> but<00:01:43.409> I<00:01:43.439> think

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
the best bit of the update but I think

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:44.929 
the best bit of the update but I think
you<00:01:43.799> should<00:01:43.979> pay<00:01:44.100> attention<00:01:44.130> to<00:01:44.549> because<00:01:44.700> it's

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
you should pay attention to because it's

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.330 
you should pay attention to because it's
really<00:01:45.210> really<00:01:45.540> exciting<00:01:45.990> and<00:01:46.229> basically<00:01:47.100> you

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
really really exciting and basically you

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.670 
really really exciting and basically you
can<00:01:47.369> dye<00:01:47.700> dog's<00:01:48.060> collars<00:01:48.450> now<00:01:48.659> um<00:01:48.899> so<00:01:49.320> before

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
can dye dog's collars now um so before

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.289

actually turn into a dog's collar so I

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.070 
actually turn into a dog's collar so I

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
think now every dog has oh wait there's

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.479 
think now every dog has oh wait there's
one<00:02:52.110> more<00:02:52.230> color<00:02:52.590> so<00:02:52.860> make<00:02:53.070> this<00:02:53.190> one<00:02:53.310> orange

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
one more color so make this one orange

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:55.670 
one more color so make this one orange
so<00:02:54.180> now<00:02:54.300> if<00:02:54.450> I<00:02:54.540> let<00:02:54.750> them<00:02:54.870> all<00:02:55.080> get<00:02:55.320> up<00:02:55.470> so<00:02:55.620> I'll

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
so now if I let them all get up so I'll

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.290 
so now if I let them all get up so I'll
just<00:02:55.800> use<00:02:55.920> the<00:02:55.980> crafting<00:02:56.310> bench<00:02:56.400> to<00:02:56.550> do<00:02:56.610> that

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
just use the crafting bench to do that

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:58.970 
just use the crafting bench to do that
