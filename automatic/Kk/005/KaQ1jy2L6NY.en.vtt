00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:26.610 
camp which is a pretty good plan that's
probably<00:02:24.819> what<00:02:24.970> that<00:02:25.120> is<00:02:25.360> so<00:02:26.290> I<00:02:26.319> really

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
probably what that is so I really

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:27.809 
probably what that is so I really
interested<00:02:26.950> in<00:02:27.069> how<00:02:27.159> that<00:02:27.310> plays<00:02:27.489> out<00:02:27.670> the

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:27.819 
interested in how that plays out the

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:29.160 
interested in how that plays out the
most<00:02:28.030> cuz<00:02:28.420> you<00:02:28.599> know<00:02:28.689> that's<00:02:28.870> a<00:02:28.930> pretty

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
most cuz you know that's a pretty

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.860 
most cuz you know that's a pretty
awesome<00:02:29.829> plan<00:02:30.310> to<00:02:30.430> do<00:02:30.549> that<00:02:30.700> so<00:02:30.970> next<00:02:31.599> up<00:02:31.720> we

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
awesome plan to do that so next up we

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.530 
awesome plan to do that so next up we
have<00:02:31.900> rehabilitated<00:02:32.549> gave<00:02:33.549> what<00:02:33.849> you<00:02:34.030> got<00:02:34.239> now

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540

00:02:36.119 --> 00:02:36.129 
different really scares me a bit because

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:38.069 
different really scares me a bit because
rehabilitation<00:02:36.970> can<00:02:37.180> go<00:02:37.359> like<00:02:37.629> you<00:02:37.659> know<00:02:37.780> both

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:38.079 
rehabilitation can go like you know both

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:40.490 
rehabilitation can go like you know both
ways<00:02:38.409> it<00:02:38.829> can<00:02:39.189> mean<00:02:39.370> like<00:02:39.549> Carver<00:02:39.939> could<00:02:40.090> be

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
ways it can mean like Carver could be

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.630 
ways it can mean like Carver could be
rehabilitating<00:02:41.500> Kinney<00:02:41.739> like<00:02:42.040> breaking<00:02:42.459> him

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
rehabilitating Kinney like breaking him

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.849 
rehabilitating Kinney like breaking him
by<00:02:43.150> using<00:02:43.390> force<00:02:43.810> or<00:02:44.049> it<00:02:44.260> could<00:02:44.470> have<00:02:44.680> in<00:02:44.769> the

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:44.859 
by using force or it could have in the

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:46.860 
by using force or it could have in the
Clementine<00:02:45.340> I<00:02:45.370> doubt<00:02:45.849> that<00:02:46.120> car<00:02:46.329> waiting<00:02:46.780> no

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
Clementine I doubt that car waiting no

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.949 
Clementine I doubt that car waiting no
harm<00:02:47.170> to<00:02:47.319> Italian<00:02:47.769> that<00:02:47.920> way<00:02:48.159> so<00:02:48.790> it<00:02:49.540> depends

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
harm to Italian that way so it depends

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:52.530 
harm to Italian that way so it depends
on<00:02:50.260> whether<00:02:50.470> in<00:02:51.010> the<00:02:51.069> picture<00:02:51.340> you<00:02:51.459> see<00:02:51.700> what

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
on whether in the picture you see what

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.289 
on whether in the picture you see what
looks<00:02:52.780> like<00:02:52.989> a<00:02:53.260> crow<00:02:53.560> bar<00:02:53.590> so<00:02:54.129> that<00:02:54.459> can<00:02:55.150> go

00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:55.299 
looks like a crow bar so that can go

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:58.020 
looks like a crow bar so that can go
wrong<00:02:55.329> either<00:02:55.959> way<00:02:56.290> maybe<00:02:57.129> she'll<00:02:57.370> also<00:02:57.609> like

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
wrong either way maybe she'll also like

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.629 
wrong either way maybe she'll also like
fighting<00:02:58.389> off<00:02:58.480> Walker's<00:02:58.959> maybe<00:02:59.500> so<00:03:00.310> next<00:03:00.489> up

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:00.639

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
really affect her in a big way because

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.530 
really affect her in a big way because
Sarah<00:03:21.099> without<00:03:21.400> her<00:03:21.579> glasses<00:03:21.730> she<00:03:22.060> could<00:03:22.329> not

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:24.549 
see she would merely help our so

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:26.789 
see she would merely help our so
therefore<00:03:24.940> you<00:03:25.389> render<00:03:25.720> her<00:03:25.840> useless<00:03:26.260> it

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:26.799 
therefore you render her useless it

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:28.800 
therefore you render her useless it
could<00:03:26.980> also<00:03:27.129> mean<00:03:27.310> that<00:03:27.519> you<00:03:27.790> know<00:03:27.970> Sarah

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
could also mean that you know Sarah

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.259 
could also mean that you know Sarah
could<00:03:29.019> die<00:03:29.199> now<00:03:29.799> personally<00:03:30.639> I<00:03:30.669> hope<00:03:31.000> sales

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:31.269 
could die now personally I hope sales

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:33.809 
could die now personally I hope sales
and<00:03:31.480> I<00:03:31.599> yet<00:03:31.870> because<00:03:32.199> it'd<00:03:33.069> be<00:03:33.129> a<00:03:33.340> little<00:03:33.609> bit

00:03:33.809 --> 00:03:33.819 
and I yet because it'd be a little bit
