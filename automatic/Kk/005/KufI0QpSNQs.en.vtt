bowling ball here so I think there's a
point<00:05:59.910> where<00:06:01.009> you<00:06:02.009> start<00:06:02.460> to<00:06:02.580> fidget<00:06:02.820> a<00:06:03.090> bit

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:03.270

too<00:06:03.479> much<00:06:03.660> and<00:06:03.900> it's<00:06:03.930> overkill<00:06:04.850> over<00:06:05.850> thinking

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:06.030 
too much and it's overkill over thinking

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:10.490 
too much and it's overkill over thinking
over<00:06:06.449> here<00:06:07.440> absolutely<00:06:08.190> I<00:06:09.150> think<00:06:09.419> 247<00:06:10.320> if<00:06:10.410> he

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:10.500 
over here absolutely I think 247 if he

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:12.409 
over here absolutely I think 247 if he
