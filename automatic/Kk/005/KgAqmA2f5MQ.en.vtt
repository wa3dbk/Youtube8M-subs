00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:11.960
 Hello dear Monday origami and 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:14.809
 what I want to teach them to do is a 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:16.820
 box or container that super easy to 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:19.310
 do and we will do it with the folds 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:22.660
 of the dark crane and that's pretty much 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:25.510
 How will the box fit? 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.890
 As you can see it's great but before 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:29.350
 to start if you have not seen how 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:31.330
 make the October crane I'll let you 

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:35.110
 Here likewise dragon 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:37.800
 paper and the phoenix 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:40.750
 And now let's see how it is done 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.540
 to make this box we will use 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:46.200
 a square format sheet of the size that 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.200
 you prefer 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:52.120
 we will fold in half 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:54.050
 and then we'll fold in half the side 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:56.450
 contrary 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:59.239
 now we will turn around so that the 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:02.770
 doubles stay on the opposite side and 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:02.770
 we will bend diagonally 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:08.549
 we will repeat this but on the opposite side 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:16.750
 now we will have to contract the sheet 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:20.400
 for this we will push from below and 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:20.400
 we will unite in this way 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:30.500
 here it goes again we push from below and 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.500
 we unite in this way 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:36.240
 the part that can be opened the 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.240
 we will send it up 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:42.360
 now we will take the lower edge 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:42.360
 left towards the center 

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:50.399
 we will repeat this but with the edge 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.399
 contrary 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:56.850
 we will turn around and repeat everything 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.850
 This process 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:06.420
 you should have something like that 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.420
 now look very good we unfolded one 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:14.860
 we open in half 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.860
 and we push in 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:21.250
 then we close again and repeat this 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:23.580
 with the other four sides that we 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.580
 missing 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.480
 you should have something like that 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:43.680
 now at the top we will take the 

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:46.170
 left edge towards the center 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.560
 and we will repeat this but with the edge 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.560
 straight 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:54.750
 and we will continue doing this with the 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:54.750
 other flaps that remain 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:06.580
 look now we will open in one of the 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.580
 parts that we have the folds 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:13.340
 and we will take the tip down from 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:16.780
 this way and we will do this with the others 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.780
 four sides that we have left 

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:26.120
 and ready we 're almost finished now 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:28.310
 we will only open very carefully and 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:30.840
 we will begin to shape it so that 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:33.239
 look like a box 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:36.700
 in this part take the time that 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:39.640
 required for you to stay perfect 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:42.099
 and as you saw it is super easy to do it and 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:44.410
 you can give a lot of uses and if 

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:46.540
 you make this origami do not forget 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:49.030
 send me photos to social networks that 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:51.640
 I'll leave them here underneath to leave a 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:54.069
 Comment likewise and subscribe if 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:56.410
 If you have not done and do not forget 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:58.269
 imagine create and learn and we see the 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:01.739
 next Thursday with a new video of 

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:01.739
