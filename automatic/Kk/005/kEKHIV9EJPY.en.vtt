little discoloration there that's

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:39.539 
little discoloration there that's
whether<00:03:36.220> maybe<00:03:36.760> a<00:03:36.879> bit<00:03:37.000> too<00:03:37.030> much<00:03:37.269> water<00:03:38.549> but

00:03:39.539 --> 00:03:39.549 
whether maybe a bit too much water but

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:48.370 
whether maybe a bit too much water but
not<00:03:39.760> go<00:03:40.769> at<00:03:41.769> it<00:03:42.010> price<00:03:42.909> maybe<00:03:46.379> this

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:48.380 
not go at it price maybe this

00:03:48.380 --> 00:04:00.190 
not go at it price maybe this
just<00:03:52.270> pressing<00:03:53.270> down

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:00.200 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.290 

you<00:04:01.200> see<00:04:01.440> how<00:04:01.620> then<00:04:01.850> can<00:04:02.850> you<00:04:02.910> see<00:04:03.120> what's

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:03.300 
you see how then can you see what's

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:07.010 
you see how then can you see what's
happened<00:04:03.600> here

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:07.020 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:12.790 

that's<00:04:07.620> the<00:04:10.100> that's<00:04:11.100> where<00:04:11.340> the<00:04:11.460> water<00:04:11.700> dried

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:12.800 
that's the that's where the water dried

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.900 
that's the that's where the water dried
so<00:04:13.800> you've<00:04:13.920> got<00:04:14.040> two<00:04:14.250> problems<00:04:14.670> we've<00:04:14.820> got

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910
