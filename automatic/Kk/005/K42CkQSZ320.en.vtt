00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:05.140
 hello welcome today I bring you what 

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:07.480
 that would be outfits so far what 

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:09.400
 What I had done was to take a base piece 

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:11.620
 and then continue to modify what they were 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:14.259
 Well then the accessories 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:16.180
 other pieces and with this build some 

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:17.860
 looks this time what I'm going to do is 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:20.080
 change it absolutely everything but the 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:22.570
 only link is that here what 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.370
 I will use are souls the shorts is 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:27.520
 a piece a bit complicated for 

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:29.980
 we see just done 52 years as 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:32.800
 for we want them we see some ages already 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:35.380
 a little more so more advanced regarding 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:38.530
 many girls but what good considered 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:40.330
 that we can use them not only 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.070
 for the beach, but also for 

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:44.680
 informal outings because it 's a piece 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:46.930
 basically informal and with zero that 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:49.210
 using some add-ons so 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:51.970
 so that they are given a little touch 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:54.310
 Well, they can be very useful, I'm going to 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:55.900
 start with this outfit with this or end 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:59.070
 I'm going to wear some pants after you 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:02.220
 you are going to see they are of a brocade color 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.989
 of a color that has been wrong and then 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:06.000
 I'll teach them to the other pieces that 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.460
 I'm taking this to finish completing the 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.440
 I wear what would be a shirt 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.510
 This is a basic one but it has some 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:15.930
 colored pebbles but as if 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.850
 they were brilliant then it is Russian is 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.290
 from doublet I was several as well as 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:23.280
 also the pants that had not 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:26.280
 said and then diego this ring 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:29.490
 ring behind and the discrete as I like 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.710
 to me this one that combines fuchsias and 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.850
 greens this other handkerchief that also 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:37.159
 it combines what are fuchsia and green 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:39.860
 and well I have simply put this 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:42.290
 necklace as earring only I have 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:45.979
 I put some pearls and the bag I'm going 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:47.630
 to teach because it is this that does not meet the 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:50.270
 last season at first that is a 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:52.490
 bag of a fuchsia color that I think it 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.060
 gives that touch of color in terms of 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.640
 shoes 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:58.520
 now you are going to read them are the 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.320
 shoes some wedges in news tone because 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.049
 I do not think that what heels are 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:05.360
 are the most appropriate the fine heel and 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:07.100
 at least under my point of view and 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:10.910
 that considers it a piece basically 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:14.600
 informal because I use it like that because 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:16.069
 they are flat shoes or if not 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:19.220
 Well , I'm telling you, wedge if I want 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:21.340
 add a little heel so I'll give it to you 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.740
 teach right now to see what you think 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.780
 I told you 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:28.330
 and weaves a little special fabric is 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:31.060
 a brocade is a fabric that is a bit 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:33.340
 enter and to subtract the informality 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.290
 can be used then what was then 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:38.200
 this shirt that I have told you before 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:41.380
 which is a shirt as well as military type 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:44.020
 and I wanted to give it that color tone 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:46.030
 as I told you and here it would be 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:48.460
 what is the bag that I think that 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:50.530
 It makes quite a lot of families and it was said like that 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:53.910
 with what the handkerchief would be and that's how it is 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.910
 how the wings would look 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:59.450
 but what is achieved is to lengthen a 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:00.410
 little legs I hope that I have 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:02.570
 liked 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:05.510
 in this outfit because I also return to 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:07.520
 use other khaki shorts 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:10.820
 these are a much more informal style 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:12.950
 a style we would say as more military and 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:14.930
 to compensate because you have 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:18.080
 fixed I do not know if you follow me by instagram 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:19.910
 I invite you to visit because I leave it 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:21.590
 in the information box that I'm going 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:23.690
 uploading many photos of what they are 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:25.370
 well my bosses every day and always 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:27.020
 tried to compensate what the pieces are 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:29.330
 more informal are some pieces that 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:32.090
 are more arranged and such but I try not 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:33.950
 abuse in the same look, not what are the 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:36.470
 very dressed pieces or what are the 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:39.260
 very informal pieces and I go then 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:41.390
 doing it like that is my way of 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.770
 I like to take things and I'll 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:45.140
 he said then this is as well as more 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:47.180
 informal and then I've put this 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:48.830
 T-shirt is the signature jr and 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:51.230
 pants these citizens are going to see 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:53.090
 are from the stradivarius firm and I've 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:55.190
 put one of the trend things of 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:56.990
 this season that is a jacket like this 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:57.770
 wide with fringes that you are going to 

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:59.850
 watch 

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:02.820
 and the earrings I put on 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:06.840
 simply in the silver rings here 

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:09.180
 a silver ring what would this be 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.860
 ring with a natural stone and good 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:13.320
 Sandals that you are going to see 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:15.690
 also wedge style also 

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:17.260
 military in a few shades khaki and bag 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:20.260
 well, also 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:21.430
 what is so well military type the 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.660
 Persians teach the look to see what you 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:24.280
 It seems 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:27.220
 Well, I arrived with me in the 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:33.020
 been as you can see 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:35.270
 if this turns out that I am carrying these are 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:37.820
 of which I told you that they are like that in 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:40.880
 plan also persimmons in throwing a little 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:42.290
 what will be the trend and good I have 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:45.950
 put also the worthless bag was 

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:51.710
 that I find extremely comfortable yes 

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:55.940
 that are for you and good because this would be 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:58.070
 for a look as well as as very casual and 

00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:01.610
 I hope you like it well 

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:02.900
 we see the other as another anfield 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:05.030
 well this is my third outfit 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:07.969
 this would be maybe an outfit if you can 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:09.649
 say so more more dress 

00:05:07.969 --> 00:05:11.959
 but good anyway I'm telling you 

00:05:09.649 --> 00:05:13.729
 that for me what is a certain is a 

00:05:11.959 --> 00:05:15.709
 informal piece but by the shape of the 

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:18.289
 short that you'll see that it's a bit like that 

00:05:15.709 --> 00:05:21.860
 by the type of fabric is more practically 

00:05:18.289 --> 00:05:24.739
 like a skirt but with the comfort that 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:26.749
 they lent us what would be a short and 

00:05:24.739 --> 00:05:28.429
 Well, I 've put on this occasion 

00:05:26.749 --> 00:05:29.839
 Well, these pants that you are going to see 

00:05:28.429 --> 00:05:32.389
 now expressions that are of the signature 

00:05:29.839 --> 00:05:34.669
 style and several this shirt that is a 

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:36.360
 type as well as at zero this is from the 

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:38.740
 sign the redoute 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:41.169
 I have this 

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:44.020
 this rudder or doilies that also 

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:46.660
 I bought mistral and several and then 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:48.639
 these are gifts I bought it I think not 

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:51.189
 express me 

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:52.689
 and for example that is the bag this 

00:05:51.189 --> 00:05:55.800
 It was also a gift that was given to us 

00:05:52.689 --> 00:05:55.800
 from the signature tous 

00:05:56.639 --> 00:06:01.500
 this is a pattern 

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:03.830
 protected today I tell you about a kind of 

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:06.570
 structure that is perhaps the most 

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:10.440
 let's say the most wearable for those who 

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:12.570
 we are already 50 years 40 and then for 

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:14.910
 go out to give a tip everything depends already 

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:17.070
 you know about our structure and everything 

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:19.320
 and I'm going to use whatever they are 

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:21.270
 tone signals news because the 

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:23.970
 sandals by tom o'neil sandals 

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:26.400
 what they do optically is long 

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:29.760
 over if what we do not do is cut the 

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:32.820
 leg cut emptied not understand that yes 

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:35.910
 we put here something like that what we 

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:37.560
 does it shorten instead if there is a 

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:39.900
 certain neckline what will make us 

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:41.520
 It is always to lengthen because in this video 

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:43.590
 I already told you that apart from what is 

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:45.840
 teach these office what I want is 

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:48.150
 that the legs are longer than 

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:50.940
 always favors us a lot more I've 

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:52.440
 put the bag in the way because it gives 

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:55.350
 a more informal air 

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:57.090
 and well, that's how it would look like before 

00:06:55.350 --> 00:07:00.120
 we documented I have put these 

00:06:57.090 --> 00:07:01.620
 years has been degrees and has equally 

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:04.080
 I put this necklace that I wore 

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:06.480
 some pieces of leather and so I think that 

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:08.640
 they remove a little bit a roll in time 

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:11.850
 because it could be a bit cheesy 

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:14.100
 so what would these types of kimono be 

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:17.220
 that for me they are not, but well, so 

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:19.980
 we removed this thing a little and it 

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:21.930
 we give a more current air then good 

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:24.300
 I hope you like it well here they are 

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:27.180
 the three out freese that I proposed to you 

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:29.820
 I reminded you that even though I did not 

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:31.950
 is a piece that may be suitable for 

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:35.010
 all jobs for because sometimes 

00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:37.470
 they see in addition to conditioning 

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:40.410
 but good that to leave in bread 

00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:42.900
 informal when it's summer and that you 

00:07:40.410 --> 00:07:45.030
 want to carry things that are well 

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:46.860
 then cool informal and such that 

00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:49.260
 I do not see it either 

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:51.120
 put on some shorts 

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:54.000
 so that we have 

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:55.560
 and good having that we are not then 

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.840
 models and that we can also put on 

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:59.340
 these things I hope that this video will 

00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:02.370
 I liked that I could have served you 

00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:05.580
 cosmen or of any kind between 

00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:07.650
 quote then help to think 

00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:09.660
 in which we can combine things and how 

00:08:07.650 --> 00:08:12.620
 no and see you in the next video as 

00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:12.620
 always see you soon goodbye
