00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
really a key to the line of flow there's

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.569 
really a key to the line of flow there's
over<00:00:57.510> 80<00:00:57.930> colors<00:00:58.530> they're<00:00:59.040> both<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.550> same

paint they both have the same amount of
pigment<00:01:02.130> to<00:01:02.490> them<00:01:02.610> but<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.210> important<00:01:03.720> thing

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
pigment to them but the important thing

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.410 
pigment to them but the important thing
to<00:01:04.049> know<00:01:04.229> is<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.979> textural<00:01:05.519> consistency<00:01:06.299> of

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
to know is the textural consistency of

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.450 
to know is the textural consistency of
each<00:01:06.600> one<00:01:06.840> structure<00:01:07.799> think<00:01:08.070> of<00:01:08.189> it<00:01:08.310> I'm

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
each one structure think of it I'm

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.120 
each one structure think of it I'm
building<00:01:08.939> a<00:01:09.030> structure<00:01:09.390> it's<00:01:10.200> an<00:01:10.380> impasse<00:01:10.829> toe

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
building a structure it's an impasse toe

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.539 
building a structure it's an impasse toe
it's<00:01:11.369> a<00:01:11.609> paste<00:01:11.969> whereas<00:01:12.840> flow<00:01:13.170> as<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:14.159> name

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
it's a paste whereas flow as the name

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:21.340 
it's a paste whereas flow as the name
indicates<00:01:15.259> smooth<00:01:16.259> sailing<00:01:19.549> you<00:01:20.549> see<00:01:20.729> I<00:01:20.939> can

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
indicates smooth sailing you see I can

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.169 
indicates smooth sailing you see I can
pick<00:01:22.350> it<00:01:22.499> up<00:01:22.649> so<00:01:22.920> when<00:01:23.100> texture<00:01:23.639> is<00:01:23.759> required

00:01:24.169 --> 00:01:24.179 
pick it up so when texture is required

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:26.569 
pick it up so when texture is required
you're<00:01:24.840> looking<00:01:25.139> for<00:01:25.319> structure<00:01:25.829> but<00:01:26.310> if<00:01:26.399> I

00:01:26.569 --> 00:01:26.579 
you're looking for structure but if I

00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:28.580 
you're looking for structure but if I
just<00:01:26.759> want<00:01:26.939> to<00:01:27.030> do<00:01:27.149> some<00:01:27.509> very<00:01:27.749> brushless

I tell you when I paint professionally
it's<00:01:40.770> my<00:01:41.069> choice<00:01:41.369> and<00:01:41.729> I<00:01:42.119> can<00:01:42.329> combine<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.840> two

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
it's my choice and I can combine the two

it's my choice and I can combine the two
there's<00:01:43.560> nothing<00:01:43.740> that<00:01:44.009> says<00:01:44.039> you<00:01:44.340> can't<00:01:44.579> use

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
there's nothing that says you can't use

flow along with structure in your
painting<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:47.909> thing<00:01:48.149> is<00:01:48.179> just<00:01:48.569> know<00:01:48.780> what

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
painting the thing is just know what

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.190 
painting the thing is just know what
application<00:01:49.770> it<00:01:49.920> suited<00:01:50.219> best<00:01:50.459> for<00:01:50.869> if<00:01:51.869> I<00:01:51.990> want

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
application it suited best for if I want

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.889 
application it suited best for if I want
to<00:01:52.259> do<00:01:52.350> screen<00:01:52.740> printing<00:01:53.609> or<00:01:53.789> still<00:01:54.090> painting

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
to do screen printing or still painting

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.109 
to do screen printing or still painting
something<00:01:55.529> like<00:01:55.829> that<00:01:56.100> I'm<00:01:56.549> probably<00:01:56.850> going

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
something like that I'm probably going

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.510 
something like that I'm probably going
to<00:01:57.209> take<00:01:57.600> the<00:01:57.779> flow<00:01:58.049> but<00:01:58.679> if<00:01:58.799> I'm<00:01:58.979> doing<00:01:59.159> some

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
to take the flow but if I'm doing some

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.599 
to take the flow but if I'm doing some
textural<00:02:00.299> effects<00:02:00.810> something<00:02:01.709> very<00:02:02.130> thick<00:02:02.429> in

00:02:02.599 --> 00:02:02.609 
textural effects something very thick in

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:06.289 
textural effects something very thick in
nature<00:02:02.939> I'll<00:02:03.149> use<00:02:03.659> the<00:02:03.840> structure<00:02:04.349> I<00:02:05.119> can<00:02:06.119> move

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
nature I'll use the structure I can move

the structure around with a bit of water

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.859 
the structure around with a bit of water
or<00:02:08.190> acrylic<00:02:08.670> painting<00:02:09.030> medium<00:02:09.209> whatever<00:02:09.660> I'm

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
or acrylic painting medium whatever I'm

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.230 
or acrylic painting medium whatever I'm
using<00:02:09.899> and<00:02:10.500> actually<00:02:11.220> get<00:02:11.459> that<00:02:11.700> tooth<00:02:11.940> in<00:02:12.090> its

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240 
using and actually get that tooth in its

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.810 
using and actually get that tooth in its
viscosity<00:02:12.510> but<00:02:13.410> it's<00:02:13.530> much<00:02:13.800> better<00:02:14.069> to<00:02:14.400> just

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
viscosity but it's much better to just

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.630 
viscosity but it's much better to just
go<00:02:15.000> ahead<00:02:15.150> and<00:02:15.480> use<00:02:16.050> the<00:02:16.530> flow<00:02:16.830> in<00:02:17.100> that<00:02:17.310> case

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
go ahead and use the flow in that case

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.390 
go ahead and use the flow in that case
you<00:02:17.940> can<00:02:18.450> have<00:02:18.660> both

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
you can have both

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.720 
you can have both
it<00:02:20.519> and<00:02:21.409> they<00:02:22.409> will<00:02:22.560> work<00:02:22.769> and<00:02:23.010> blend<00:02:23.519> together

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
it and they will work and blend together

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.600 
it and they will work and blend together
beautifully<00:02:24.829> but<00:02:25.829> the<00:02:26.010> important<00:02:26.430> thing<00:02:26.459> to

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
beautifully but the important thing to

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.089 
beautifully but the important thing to
know<00:02:26.959> when<00:02:27.959> you're<00:02:28.110> working<00:02:28.290> with<00:02:28.590> it<00:02:28.739> if<00:02:28.829> you

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:29.099 
know when you're working with it if you

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:31.819 
know when you're working with it if you
want<00:02:29.310> texture<00:02:29.819> look<00:02:30.390> for<00:02:30.629> structure<00:02:31.170> if<00:02:31.319> you

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:31.829 
want texture look for structure if you

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:33.259 
want texture look for structure if you
want<00:02:32.040> something<00:02:32.340> that's<00:02:32.519> going<00:02:32.700> to<00:02:32.760> be<00:02:32.939> flat

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
want something that's going to be flat

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:36.229 
want something that's going to be flat
and<00:02:33.480> self<00:02:33.780> leveling<00:02:34.260> use<00:02:34.860> the<00:02:35.069> flow<00:02:35.340> very

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
and self leveling use the flow very

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:38.479 
and self leveling use the flow very
simply<00:02:36.750> you<00:02:36.959> can't<00:02:37.470> go<00:02:37.680> wrong<00:02:37.709> when<00:02:38.459> you're

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
simply you can't go wrong when you're

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:40.460 
simply you can't go wrong when you're
using<00:02:38.760> matisse<00:02:39.209> terror<00:02:39.480> vans<00:02:39.840> flow<00:02:40.200> or
