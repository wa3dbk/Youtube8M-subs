I wanted to give the kitchen a facelift

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:19.680 
I wanted to give the kitchen a facelift
but<00:00:18.730> I<00:00:18.880> didn't<00:00:19.060> want<00:00:19.180> to<00:00:19.210> spend<00:00:19.390> a<00:00:19.510> lot<00:00:19.630> of

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:19.690 
but I didn't want to spend a lot of

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:21.330 
but I didn't want to spend a lot of
money<00:00:19.930> so<00:00:20.170> I<00:00:20.230> painted<00:00:20.440> the<00:00:20.620> cabinets<00:00:21.160> and<00:00:21.220> the

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:21.340 
money so I painted the cabinets and the

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:23.250 
money so I painted the cabinets and the
walls<00:00:21.610> a<00:00:22.000> trim<00:00:22.270> and<00:00:22.750> I<00:00:22.840> was<00:00:22.930> just<00:00:23.050> about

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:23.260 
walls a trim and I was just about

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.380 
walls a trim and I was just about
finished<00:00:23.680> when<00:00:23.830> I<00:00:23.860> decided<00:00:24.279> that<00:00:24.550> it'd<00:00:25.090> be<00:00:25.360> a

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:25.390 
finished when I decided that it'd be a

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:26.730 
finished when I decided that it'd be a
good<00:00:25.540> idea<00:00:25.630> to<00:00:25.930> put<00:00:26.170> a<00:00:26.200> little<00:00:26.290> beadboard

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:26.740 
good idea to put a little beadboard

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:29.130 
good idea to put a little beadboard
molding<00:00:27.430> in<00:00:27.580> the<00:00:27.700> eating<00:00:28.090> area<00:00:28.240> and<00:00:28.600> that<00:00:29.020> will

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:29.140 
molding in the eating area and that will

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.350 
molding in the eating area and that will
keep<00:00:29.320> the<00:00:29.380> kitchen<00:00:29.860> cleaners<00:00:30.340> it's<00:00:30.910> easier<00:00:31.270> to

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:31.360 
keep the kitchen cleaners it's easier to

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:32.910 
keep the kitchen cleaners it's easier to
wipe<00:00:31.540> down<00:00:31.570> the<00:00:31.900> beadboard<00:00:32.110> because<00:00:32.650> it<00:00:32.740> has<00:00:32.890> a

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:32.920 
wipe down the beadboard because it has a

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.070 
wipe down the beadboard because it has a
gloss<00:00:33.310> finish<00:00:33.340> now<00:00:34.150> the<00:00:34.270> first<00:00:34.480> step<00:00:34.720> was<00:00:35.050> to

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:35.080 
gloss finish now the first step was to

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:36.750 
gloss finish now the first step was to
score<00:00:35.500> the<00:00:35.590> top<00:00:35.770> of<00:00:35.950> the<00:00:36.040> base<00:00:36.220> cap<00:00:36.490> with<00:00:36.670> the

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:36.760 
score the top of the base cap with the

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.760 
score the top of the base cap with the
utility<00:00:37.210> knife<00:00:37.360> and<00:00:37.990> then<00:00:38.110> I<00:00:38.170> used<00:00:38.380> this<00:00:38.500> back

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:38.770 
utility knife and then I used this back

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:40.710 
utility knife and then I used this back
of<00:00:38.950> knife<00:00:39.070> from<00:00:39.190> a<00:00:39.310> small<00:00:39.579> pry<00:00:39.850> bar<00:00:40.150> to<00:00:40.390> remove

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:40.720 
of knife from a small pry bar to remove

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.170 
of knife from a small pry bar to remove
the<00:00:41.230> base<00:00:41.440> cap<00:00:41.740> it's<00:00:42.250> also<00:00:42.460> a<00:00:42.579> good<00:00:42.730> idea<00:00:43.060> to

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:43.180 
the base cap it's also a good idea to

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:45.720 
the base cap it's also a good idea to
use<00:00:43.329> a<00:00:43.360> scraper<00:00:43.720> or<00:00:44.140> short<00:00:44.470> chisel<00:00:44.950> to<00:00:45.430> remove

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:45.730 
use a scraper or short chisel to remove

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:47.220 
use a scraper or short chisel to remove
the<00:00:45.880> paint<00:00:46.150> line<00:00:46.330> so<00:00:46.630> you<00:00:46.720> have<00:00:46.840> a<00:00:46.870> flush

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:47.230 
the paint line so you have a flush

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:49.590 
the paint line so you have a flush
surface<00:00:47.620> for<00:00:48.070> your<00:00:48.190> molding<00:00:48.520> on<00:00:48.640> the<00:00:49.090> wall<00:00:49.330> and

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:49.600 
surface for your molding on the wall and

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.990 
surface for your molding on the wall and
on<00:00:50.020> top<00:00:50.230> of<00:00:50.350> the<00:00:50.440> baseboard<00:00:50.890> so<00:00:51.100> the<00:00:51.760> first

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:52.000 
on top of the baseboard so the first

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.090 
on top of the baseboard so the first
step<00:00:52.240> was<00:00:52.510> to<00:00:52.750> remove<00:00:52.900> the<00:00:53.230> base<00:00:53.440> cap<00:00:53.710> molding

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:54.100 
step was to remove the base cap molding

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.160 
step was to remove the base cap molding
that<00:00:54.220> was<00:00:54.370> on<00:00:54.520> top<00:00:54.730> of<00:00:54.910> the<00:00:55.000> baseboard<00:00:55.480> and<00:00:55.900> now

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:56.170 
that was on top of the baseboard and now

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:58.230 
that was on top of the baseboard and now
I'm<00:00:56.260> going<00:00:56.440> to<00:00:56.680> build<00:00:56.920> from<00:00:57.100> there<00:00:57.310> now<00:00:57.910> if

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:58.240 
I'm going to build from there now if

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:59.910 
I'm going to build from there now if
you've<00:00:58.570> got<00:00:58.600> a<00:00:58.780> smaller<00:00:59.140> baseboard<00:00:59.770> like<00:00:59.890> a

00:00:59.910 --> 00:00:59.920 
you've got a smaller baseboard like a

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.950 
you've got a smaller baseboard like a
small<00:01:00.250> clamshell<00:01:00.850> baseboard<00:01:01.510> or<00:01:01.600> something

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:01.960 
small clamshell baseboard or something

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.229 
small clamshell baseboard or something
you<00:01:02.470> can<00:01:02.620> just<00:01:02.770> remove<00:01:03.070> the<00:01:03.490> whole<00:01:03.670> baseboard

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:04.239 
you can just remove the whole baseboard

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:05.160 
you can just remove the whole baseboard
and<00:01:04.449> start<00:01:04.750> from<00:01:04.839> scratch

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.170 
and start from scratch

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.020 
and start from scratch
I've<00:01:05.830> drawn<00:01:06.130> some<00:01:06.310> of<00:01:06.430> the<00:01:06.490> moldings<00:01:06.909> that

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:07.030 
I've drawn some of the moldings that

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:08.850 
I've drawn some of the moldings that
I'll<00:01:07.150> need<00:01:07.360> for<00:01:07.600> this<00:01:07.720> project<00:01:07.990> and<00:01:08.439> now<00:01:08.770> I'm

our hits the wall I'll need to go to
hold<00:03:13.390> the<00:03:13.540> bead<00:03:13.720> board<00:03:14.019> for<00:03:14.440> this<00:03:14.590> outlet<00:03:15.099> so

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
hold the bead board for this outlet so

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:16.740 
hold the bead board for this outlet so
I'm<00:03:15.370> going<00:03:15.519> to<00:03:15.579> measure<00:03:15.760> from<00:03:15.909> the<00:03:16.150> wall<00:03:16.329> and

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
I'm going to measure from the wall and

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.300 
I'm going to measure from the wall and
it<00:03:17.349> looks<00:03:17.590> like<00:03:17.650> 13<00:03:18.900> to<00:03:19.900> 14<00:03:20.260> and<00:03:20.650> 7/8<00:03:21.099> so<00:03:21.250> I'll

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
it looks like 13 to 14 and 7/8 so I'll

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.569 
it looks like 13 to 14 and 7/8 so I'll
write<00:03:21.519> that<00:03:21.700> right<00:03:21.909> on<00:03:22.030> the<00:03:22.120> wall<00:03:22.709> and<00:03:23.709> then

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:24.579 
write that right on the wall and then

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:26.819 
write that right on the wall and then
