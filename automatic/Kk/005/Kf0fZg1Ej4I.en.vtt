I'm<00:00:20.480> gonna<00:00:20.630> do<00:00:20.690> this<00:00:20.780> video<00:00:21.020> in<00:00:21.230> segments

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:21.850 
I'm gonna do this video in segments

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:26.530 
I'm gonna do this video in segments
first<00:00:22.850> thing<00:00:23.030> I<00:00:23.320> do<00:00:24.320> is<00:00:24.380> fold<00:00:25.100> the<00:00:25.220> mirror<00:00:25.540> take

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:26.540 
first thing I do is fold the mirror take

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:29.050 
first thing I do is fold the mirror take
off<00:00:26.690> this<00:00:26.810> panel<00:00:27.580> there's<00:00:28.580> three<00:00:28.790> screws

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:29.060 
off this panel there's three screws

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.170 
off this panel there's three screws
underneath<00:00:29.330> a<00:00:30.640> few<00:00:31.640> guys<00:00:31.820> that<00:00:31.850> I<00:00:32.029> haven't

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:32.180 
underneath a few guys that I haven't

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.070 
underneath a few guys that I haven't
taken<00:00:32.450> off<00:00:32.660> the<00:00:33.470> mirror<00:00:34.810> covers<00:00:35.810> I<00:00:35.930> guess

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:36.080 
taken off the mirror covers I guess

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:40.770 
taken off the mirror covers I guess
before<00:00:36.260> if<00:00:37.190> you<00:00:37.280> see<00:00:37.430> at<00:00:37.520> the<00:00:37.580> top<00:00:37.790> right<00:00:39.430> there

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:40.780 
before if you see at the top right there

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:46.540 
before if you see at the top right there
insert<00:00:41.780> a<00:00:41.810> screwdriver<00:00:42.110> pry<00:00:42.860> it<00:00:42.980> off<00:00:45.520> so<00:00:46.520> I

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:46.550 
insert a screwdriver pry it off so I

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:48.040 
insert a screwdriver pry it off so I
noticed<00:00:46.940> when<00:00:47.030> I<00:00:47.090> did<00:00:47.270> the<00:00:47.360> other<00:00:47.480> side<00:00:47.750> is

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:48.050 
noticed when I did the other side is

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.580 
noticed when I did the other side is
that<00:00:48.530> up<00:00:49.220> underneath<00:00:49.550> here<00:00:50.410> although<00:00:51.410> if<00:00:51.500> you

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:51.590 
that up underneath here although if you

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:52.569 
that up underneath here although if you
can<00:00:51.710> really<00:00:51.860> see<00:00:52.070> it<00:00:52.160> but<00:00:52.280> there's<00:00:52.460> three

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:52.579 
can really see it but there's three

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:56.410 
can really see it but there's three
screws<00:00:53.560> I'll<00:00:54.560> cut<00:00:54.739> to<00:00:54.770> a<00:00:54.860> different<00:00:55.210> view<00:00:56.210> here

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.420 
screws I'll cut to a different view here

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.770 
screws I'll cut to a different view here
in<00:00:56.510> a<00:00:56.540> second<00:00:56.899> but<00:00:57.280> whenever<00:00:58.280> you<00:00:58.640> take<00:00:59.600> the

00:00:59.770 --> 00:00:59.780 
in a second but whenever you take the

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.639 
in a second but whenever you take the
mirror<00:00:59.989> the<00:01:00.350> housing<00:01:00.770> all<00:01:01.670> three<00:01:02.360> screws<00:01:02.720> can

00:01:03.639 --> 00:01:03.649 
mirror the housing all three screws can

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:06.160 
mirror the housing all three screws can
you<00:01:03.770> see<00:01:03.980> me<00:01:04.040> turning<00:01:04.579> so<00:01:05.449> the<00:01:05.509> idea<00:01:05.810> is<00:01:05.899> to

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.170 
you see me turning so the idea is to

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.999 
you see me turning so the idea is to
take<00:01:06.950> out<00:01:07.100> these<00:01:07.249> three<00:01:08.170> hex<00:01:09.170> head<00:01:09.409> bolts

00:01:09.999 --> 00:01:10.009 
take out these three hex head bolts

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:13.029 
take out these three hex head bolts
right<00:01:10.100> here<00:01:10.159> and<00:01:10.749> then<00:01:11.749> tighten<00:01:12.710> those<00:01:12.799> three

00:01:13.029 --> 00:01:13.039 
right here and then tighten those three

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:18.219 
right here and then tighten those three
interior<00:01:13.789> screws<00:01:14.659> down<00:01:15.609> all<00:01:16.609> right<00:01:17.079> hex<00:01:18.079> head

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:18.229 
interior screws down all right hex head

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:20.949 
interior screws down all right hex head
bolts<00:01:18.530> removed<00:01:18.799> simply<00:01:19.490> just<00:01:20.119> give<00:01:20.810> a<00:01:20.840> little

00:01:20.949 --> 00:01:20.959 
bolts removed simply just give a little

00:01:20.959 --> 00:01:24.279 
bolts removed simply just give a little
bit<00:01:21.079> of<00:01:21.170> a<00:01:21.259> pull<00:01:22.719> you'll<00:01:23.719> see<00:01:23.869> that<00:01:24.020> there's

00:01:24.279 --> 00:01:24.289 
bit of a pull you'll see that there's

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:27.550 
bit of a pull you'll see that there's
the<00:01:24.469> of<00:01:25.009> the<00:01:25.579> weather<00:01:25.759> grommet<00:01:26.469> between<00:01:27.469> the

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
the of the weather grommet between the

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.429 
the of the weather grommet between the
mirror<00:01:27.740> and<00:01:28.009> the<00:01:28.189> paint<00:01:28.639> simply<00:01:29.420> separate<00:01:29.840> and

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:30.439 
mirror and the paint simply separate and

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:33.370 
mirror and the paint simply separate and
position<00:01:30.799> the<00:01:30.889> mirror<00:01:31.069> into<00:01:31.659> a<00:01:32.659> manner<00:01:33.259> in

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
position the mirror into a manner in

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:34.599 
position the mirror into a manner in
which<00:01:33.439> you<00:01:33.649> can<00:01:33.770> get<00:01:33.889> to<00:01:33.979> the<00:01:34.100> three<00:01:34.340> screws

00:01:34.599 --> 00:01:34.609 
which you can get to the three screws

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:38.590 
which you can get to the three screws
underneath<00:01:35.920> as<00:01:36.920> you<00:01:37.340> can<00:01:37.579> see<00:01:37.700> here<00:01:37.969> mayor

underneath as you can see here mayor
hanging<00:01:38.929> down<00:01:39.049> on<00:01:39.079> the<00:01:39.259> side<00:01:39.529> those<00:01:40.429> are<00:01:40.459> the

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
hanging down on the side those are the

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.069 
hanging down on the side those are the
screws<00:01:40.880> three<00:01:41.450> screws<00:01:41.659> that<00:01:41.689> were<00:01:41.899> talking

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:42.079 
screws three screws that were talking

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:44.620 
screws three screws that were talking
about<00:01:42.670> should<00:01:43.670> just<00:01:43.939> have<00:01:44.209> to<00:01:44.359> give<00:01:44.479> them<00:01:44.539> a

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
about should just have to give them a

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.260 
about should just have to give them a
little<00:01:44.779> bit<00:01:44.899> of<00:01:45.130> torque<00:01:46.189> until<00:01:46.880> they<00:01:46.939> tighten

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
little bit of torque until they tighten

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.160 
little bit of torque until they tighten
down<00:01:47.299> and<00:01:47.990> everything<00:01:48.289> should<00:01:48.439> be<00:01:48.469> good<00:01:48.590> to<00:01:48.679> go

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 
down and everything should be good to go

want<00:01:54.880> but<00:01:55.880> they're<00:01:56.029> pretty<00:01:56.149> light<00:01:56.450> I<00:01:56.479> would

00:01:56.739 --> 00:01:56.749 
want but they're pretty light I would

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:59.289 
want but they're pretty light I would
say<00:01:57.069> probably<00:01:58.069> not<00:01:58.340> gonna<00:01:58.459> be<00:01:58.549> more<00:01:58.729> than<00:01:58.759> 25

00:01:59.289 --> 00:01:59.299
