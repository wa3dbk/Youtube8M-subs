00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:08.010
 hi to all pieces and welcome in 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:13.320
 this new video from the minecraft series 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:15.150
 mof 1.5.2 attention to the needles is not enough 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.560
 highly worried that when 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.170
 die minecraft your items 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.970
 they are scattered everywhere 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.949
 among other things if you are close to lava 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.080
 when you die all objects are missing 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.449
 doing it on purpose they just finish 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:31.230
 in the only cube of lava in the radius of 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:34.500
 100 thousand cube xi km the hook of today is 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.149
 called saver inventors practically 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.270
 in the case of death where we are 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.190
 states obliterated globe will appear one 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.960
 kind of bag in 3d that will contain 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.910
 inside all the items that were 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.110
 in our inventory 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.329
 I filled my pockets a little 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.090
 appropriately for the occasion as you wish 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.520
 see then I would say that it would be better 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.070
 give an example I have enough of 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.199
 this life among other things I have also finished 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.239
 all my candies are without money 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.890
 and the corner does not make me at the shop 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.940
 more credit to get started 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.619
 carusi foods 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.619
 enough I do it over 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.540
 ok after this pathetic staged 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:12.530
 let 's see what remains in the place of the 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.050
 our death 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:17.480
 let's see a little then see here 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:20.150
 the famous sack will have appeared 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:22.130
 particular sacred sack 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:24.260
 then right-clicking the 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.900
 bag will give us back a random item 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:28.880
 among those we had see if sometimes 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.330
 I get them michel adwords this time 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.830
 I'm starting something is so on you see 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:37.130
 then instead clicking with the button 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:39.290
 shift you see take us there will appear 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.910
 the words ctc reset falls will appear 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:43.400
 Ticino of the name of the dead 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:45.110
 expelled stops with shift key then 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.360
 will appear by clicking the shift plus button 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.850
 right click will open this let's say 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:52.610
 interface where we can get the 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.320
 objects that we want in short if 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.479
 we are in a hurry we demand all the 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.729
 our items back quickly 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:00.170
 just click on this button where 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:01.010
 see there is the symbol of the letter you 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.520
 zac 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:07.130
 here it is all back and you will have it 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.750
 definitely noticed that when it comes 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.239
 in the bag it is emptied will disappear 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.370
 forever but I remind you that as long as it exists 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:14.690
 still we will not be able to insert any 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.850
 object there may only be 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.380
 those we lost when the bag 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:21.110
 will perish after our death not 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:23.630
 will never disappear will always remain where 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.940
 also like all items happens 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.650
 in the lava it will be destroyed so it must 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:29.660
 always be careful not to die in the 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.790
 in our hated lava and this 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.830
 however I don't find that anyway it is a 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.540
 well because it is necessary in order not to render 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.370
 the way extremely over power and it is 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:40.160
 also to keep it always high 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:42.470
 spirit of adventure in the threatening 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.959
 caves and gentlemen after speaking 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:48.010
 on this item comes to show you how 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:49.540
 you install this fashion 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:52.689
 here we are guys in my office 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:54.040
 respectful desktop you will have noticed this 

00:02:52.689 --> 00:02:56.349
 particular this particular 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.150
 each application interface see the 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:59.829
 bring together a kind of folder or 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:03.069
 downloaded a special program called 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:04.180
 fences this here the network chances 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:05.829

 installed say that now my 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.440
 chaotic desktop is no longer as chaotic 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:12.879
 once but back to us 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.739
 then to install he invented it of 

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:16.690
 severe we will need minecraft forge 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:18.730
 therefore after having installed forge 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:20.680
 the mons folder will appear and we will have to 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.569
 put them mentors savers in here 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.670
 after saying it quickly then who 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:27.220
 we already know how to do it right now 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:29.769
 I will show the guided procedure then 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:31.359
 First let's go to this link 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:32.200
 which puts in the description of the page 

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:34.209
 of the mod 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.859

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:47.709
 in this other link and always will be 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:51.190
 present in description to download 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:53.940
 never crawford then for it is missing 1.5.2 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:57.099
 advice from well 684 that at the moment 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:59.440
 it should therefore be recommended 

00:03:57.099 --> 00:04:00.730
 click on universal and one will open 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:02.889
 fly app page 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:04.329
 we wait 5 seconds without paying attention 

00:04:02.889 --> 00:04:04.959
 to the advertising that appears below and 

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:07.419
 just spam 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:08.709
 a button will appear after waiting 

00:04:07.419 --> 00:04:11.049
 yellow top right with writing 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:12.819
 continue here click here and the will start 

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:14.500
 download well once we have 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:15.549
 written both we see how 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.530
 install 

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:18.849
 we open the start menu in the search coffin 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:20.349
 type appdata percentage 

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:22.000
 percentage 

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:24.220
 the first is the only result among other things 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.320
 it will be rowe amin who I call them and it will appear 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:28.410
 this small page we enter the point 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:30.430
 minecraft we enter the folder been 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:31.990
 we select en kraft which would be the 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:35.440
 giar fail or minecraft punto jar 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:37.060
 here's from up now we have it with winrar o 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:39.370
 as an alternative to some other valid ones 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:41.860
 archiving program as smg ho 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:44.710
 fear killer now let's get rid of me times 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:46.659
 indeed commonly called by infamous meta 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:48.580
 is not the only thing to exist 

00:04:46.659 --> 00:04:51.009
 be eliminated ok 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:52.719
 done that we open forge 

00:04:51.009 --> 00:04:54.339
 we select all files inside 

00:04:52.719 --> 00:04:56.020
 of the compressed folder of ford e 

00:04:54.339 --> 00:04:58.689
 drag minecraft dot in there 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:00.399
 I already remind you that if you already have some 

00:04:58.689 --> 00:05:02.229
 installed mode you cannot install 

00:05:00.399 --> 00:05:04.089
 ford because if you don't, that will leave everything 

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:05.770
 so if you want to install force vi 

00:05:04.089 --> 00:05:08.050
 you must first make a minecraft point 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:09.460
 clean or fading install 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:11.499
 strong and can install all the fashions 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:12.849
 you wish then there is no to 

00:05:11.499 --> 00:05:14.499
 worry if I put you back one 

00:05:12.849 --> 00:05:16.539
 kind of meta infima that is not is not 

00:05:14.499 --> 00:05:18.819
 infamous does nothing now we close 

00:05:16.539 --> 00:05:20.889
 these two folders do not close the 

00:05:18.819 --> 00:05:23.020
 minecraft point because we will need it later and 

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:24.279
 we start minecraft maybe because to do 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:25.389
 so that ford downloads files that 

00:05:24.279 --> 00:05:27.309
 need to continue with 

00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:29.080
 the installation in fact the first time 

00:05:27.309 --> 00:05:30.339
 will have to download the files it will take a while 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:32.529
 I will cut the video 

00:05:30.339 --> 00:05:33.969
 zac ok I have not determined it was 

00:05:32.529 --> 00:05:35.469
 fast enough and now that you 

00:05:33.969 --> 00:05:37.599
 angry minecraft we can also 

00:05:35.469 --> 00:05:39.909
 close it and go back to the point 

00:05:37.599 --> 00:05:41.349
 minecraft we will notice that there will be created 

00:05:39.909 --> 00:05:43.419
 of the new folders between that folder 

00:05:41.349 --> 00:05:45.370
 mode enter the mode and folder 

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:46.240
 dragged inventors saver the whole file 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:48.399
 zip in here 

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:49.659
 in my case the couple very well gentlemen 

00:05:48.399 --> 00:05:51.309
 installation terminated say of 

00:05:49.659 --> 00:05:54.279
 personally test the operation 

00:05:51.309 --> 00:05:58.779
 of the nun box attention to that pro 

00:05:54.279 --> 00:06:00.849
 then the Ticino lajcak is enough and I would say that 

00:05:58.779 --> 00:06:01.990
 it would be appropriate to do a 

00:06:00.849 --> 00:06:05.849
 world in creative 

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:05.849
 ok let's go now 

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:15.520

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:22.419
 just appeared our beloved bag 

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:23.980
 let's say shift more to the right we'll see 

00:06:22.419 --> 00:06:25.840
 I didn't tell you all the things here 

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:27.280
 that here you can if you had one 

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:30.430
 armor puts on automatically 

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:32.290
 in these slots, however, gentlemen 

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:34.150
 you can see tram works great though 

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:35.800
