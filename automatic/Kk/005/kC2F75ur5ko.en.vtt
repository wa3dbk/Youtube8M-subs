00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:18.740
 Hello everyone, I sat down quite a while not 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:20.270
 I made such a video for that as that 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:21.770
 the last time I am less and less 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:23.990
 updating your devices 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:25.910
 today's issue will be devoted to games 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.560
 and bridging distance records 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:29.750
 that is, you need to set records when 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.670
 uncomplicated gameplay you all already 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:33.770
 familiar with but from these games top write your 

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:36.110
 results in the comments so the first 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.190
 the game is called a circle is another 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:38.690
 analogue with birds 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.180
 at the cost of playing the truth 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:43.460
 simpler than the progenitor but this 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.590
 approach I have not yet met it seems to me that 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.899
 he is good enough every tap on the screen 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:50.420
 throws up a little circle and need 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:51.620
 get as far as possible next game 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.180
 called retry 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.739
 it has such a classic retro 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.720
 design and takes you back to those 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:58.970
 unforgettable times when pixels on 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:00.620
 the screen was quite noticeable but 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:03.140
 This did not prevent us from conducting dozens 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.790
 hours playing for your devices again 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.680
 same very simple gameplay need 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:09.560
 fly as far as possible tap on the screen 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.330
 gives you acceleration along with that you 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.460
 start flying up sharply so 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:16.030
 need to find a balance between speed and 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:19.070
 tall and dish all sorts of obstacles 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.750
 the next game is called you sticker 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.190
 samurai boundaries 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.619
 move from one platform to another 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:26.600
 bridges are built initially 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:27.260
 up and you will need to try to guess 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.210
 their length 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:31.490
 if it is either too short 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.740
 either too long your hero will fall 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.960
 down everything is very simple but nonetheless 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.070
 very funny now move on to a couple 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.049
 tablet games 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:41.659
 they are kinda like a true phone but i have 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:43.360
 not on the tablet so anyway 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:46.340
 bitch of them you will find in the video description 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:49.340
 so the next game is called daddy 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.560
 long legs you play for 2 new spider 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:54.110
 or what kind of a creature is that 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:57.619
 know very nice epic design 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:59.240
 and physics although the idea is painfully simple. 1 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:01.939
 tab bend the left knee 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:04.130
 next right this way keeping 

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:06.170
 balance you need to go for records 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.239
 peace with all its simplicity is quite 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:11.239
 so I advise everyone to advise 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:13.430
 and the last game is called rub inflate 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:15.020
 4 here you can feel yourself in 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.910
 human roles god a 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:19.460
 play of course not for you 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:20.210
 you must remove the cable to the buildings dredge with 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:21.950
 for them with your fingers 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:23.870
 either to another dynamic object 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.540
 such as balloon airplanes and the 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.910
 This game really is very addictive 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.590
 great physics design is 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.540
 many different levels each of 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.670
 which all longer and longer 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:37.250
 has its various chips to open 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.660
 next you need against leading everything is very 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.810
 just so I advise you to play 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:43.610
 really cool stuff so here's through 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.230
 your records in the comments and all this 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:48.190
 with you was sat subscribe to the channel 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.190
