00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.120
 ah 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:04.250
 once again friends remember no 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.740
 lose these springs and these rounds that 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:10.310
 they will try to jump 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:14.439
 in trying to disarm to open this 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.439
 blender model 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:53.250
 these springs are so that he is 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:56.580
 part where the contacts are not sticking 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:02:00.620
 with the blades and stay up 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:00.620
 for that is these springs 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:32.020
 before screwing it I'm going to make sure 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:32.020
 that works and I cut myself 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:49.980
 there it is working I can screw 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:49.980
 the 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.530
 I was going to close it and I had 

00:02:55.969 --> 00:03:00.800
 forgotten this 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:03.450
 place 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:07.260
 place here a 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:09.930
 a part that is the one that has the motor 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:13.879
 that is not going to leave the gears 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.879
 this piece I had forgotten to place 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:58.159
 Well now it is here already well 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:04:00.220
 sure the engine that does not get out of 

00:03:58.159 --> 00:04:01.630
 the gears 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:04.080
 Now and then I'll close 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:04.080
 friends 

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:13.780
 good friends, it's all for today 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:17.260
 this video I hope the information that 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:19.200
 give them a day of usefulness and 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:23.070
 Well here is the 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:24.770
 the blender with a cord in perfect 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:26.419
 state 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:29.120
 was given a good cleaning to the 

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:30.919
 contacts a cleaning to the gears and 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:34.009

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:35.960
 this blender came in terrible 

00:04:34.009 --> 00:04:38.240
 terms 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:40.960
 and then this cord is going to pass to the 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:44.000
 We do not need garbage because we have 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:47.229
 enough extra laces for the future 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.229
 from this to the garbage 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:56.190
 a happy and happier customer because as a 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:59.820

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:03.590
