comes out of the environment by

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:29.650 
comes out of the environment by
following<00:00:27.470> a<00:00:27.680> multi<00:00:28.099> resource<00:00:28.669> strategy<00:00:29.390> and

following a multi resource strategy and

following a multi resource strategy and
if<00:00:30.590> things<00:00:30.770> didn't<00:00:31.070> work<00:00:31.220> out<00:00:31.399> in<00:00:31.579> one<00:00:31.730> place

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:31.939 
if things didn't work out in one place

if things didn't work out in one place
anymore

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:32.570 
anymore

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.080

simply<00:00:32.989> moving<00:00:33.200> somewhere<00:00:33.649> else<00:00:33.710> so<00:00:34.430> adapting

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:35.090 
simply moving somewhere else so adapting

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.229 
simply moving somewhere else so adapting

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:38.239 
to change in a spatial way and I'll get

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:39.850 
to change in a spatial way and I'll get
back<00:00:38.420> to<00:00:38.540> that<00:00:38.719> later<00:00:38.840> on<00:00:39.020> because<00:00:39.410> one<00:00:39.620> of<00:00:39.649> our

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:39.860 
back to that later on because one of our

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:41.650 
back to that later on because one of our
problems<00:00:40.160> is<00:00:40.520> that<00:00:40.910> we<00:00:41.090> can't<00:00:41.329> do<00:00:41.480> that

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:41.660 
problems is that we can't do that

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.290 
problems is that we can't do that
anymore<00:00:41.899> and<00:00:42.340> also<00:00:43.340> by<00:00:43.490> systematically

that we have from Australia is that the

that we have from Australia is that the

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:53.630 
only place in Australia where people

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:55.660 
only place in Australia where people
systematically<00:00:54.050> have<00:00:54.650> famines<00:00:55.190> in

Marais and darling rivers because their

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:03.520 
Marais and darling rivers because their
people<00:01:01.460> were<00:01:01.760> lured<00:01:02.300> into<00:01:02.630> the<00:01:02.930> idea<00:01:03.260> that

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
people were lured into the idea that

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.530 
people were lured into the idea that
they<00:01:04.100> could<00:01:04.309> actually<00:01:04.489> have<00:01:04.970> more<00:01:05.239> and<00:01:05.390> more

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:05.540 
they could actually have more and more

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.670 
they could actually have more and more
people<00:01:05.780> and<00:01:06.170> then<00:01:06.649> they<00:01:06.920> get<00:01:07.159> tapped<00:01:07.700> on<00:01:07.939> by

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:08.680 
people and then they get tapped on by

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.039 
people and then they get tapped on by
famines<00:01:09.680> in<00:01:09.950> the<00:01:10.670> very<00:01:11.000> sparse<00:01:11.479> areas<00:01:11.930> of

famines in the very sparse areas of
Australia<00:01:12.590> you<00:01:12.979> never<00:01:13.189> have<00:01:13.399> any<00:01:13.700> famine<00:01:14.450> any

Australia you never have any famine any

Australia you never have any famine any
trace<00:01:15.079> of<00:01:15.109> famine<00:01:15.619> we<00:01:15.979> find<00:01:16.310> famines<00:01:16.789> in<00:01:16.969> the

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:17.119 
trace of famine we find famines in the

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:19.059 
trace of famine we find famines in the
bones<00:01:17.329> and<00:01:17.929> that<00:01:18.139> is<00:01:18.200> why<00:01:18.439> I<00:01:18.469> can<00:01:18.770> talk<00:01:18.889> about

00:01:19.059 --> 00:01:19.069 
bones and that is why I can talk about

00:01:19.069 --> 00:01:23.620 
bones and that is why I can talk about
that<00:01:20.259> the<00:01:21.259> other<00:01:21.289> thing<00:01:21.649> is<00:01:21.859> that<00:01:22.100> people<00:01:23.060> did

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
that the other thing is that people did

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.690 
that the other thing is that people did
not<00:01:23.869> know<00:01:23.929> how<00:01:24.380> to<00:01:24.439> interact<00:01:25.100> with<00:01:25.429> the

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
not know how to interact with the

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.050 
not know how to interact with the
environment<00:01:25.999> they<00:01:26.929> only<00:01:27.350> reacted<00:01:28.039> to<00:01:28.249> it<00:01:28.429> so

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060 
environment they only reacted to it so

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.120 
environment they only reacted to it so
the<00:01:29.240> environment<00:01:29.509> was<00:01:29.899> essentially<00:01:30.530> left

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
the environment was essentially left

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:36.219 
the environment was essentially left
alone<00:01:32.979> change<00:01:33.979> and<00:01:34.369> risk<00:01:34.639> were<00:01:35.450> imminent<00:01:35.990> all

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:36.229 
alone change and risk were imminent all

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:39.639 
alone change and risk were imminent all
the<00:01:36.590> time<00:01:36.829> every<00:01:37.490> minute<00:01:37.939> of<00:01:38.240> the<00:01:38.359> day<00:01:38.649> but

00:01:39.639 --> 00:01:39.649 
the time every minute of the day but

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:41.620 
the time every minute of the day but
because<00:01:39.889> they<00:01:40.399> were<00:01:40.459> there<00:01:41.299> was<00:01:41.450> no

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
because they were there was no

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.989 
because they were there was no
cumulation<00:01:42.229> of<00:01:42.259> risks<00:01:43.100> and<00:01:43.279> I'll<00:01:43.490> get<00:01:43.700> back<00:01:43.880> to

00:01:43.989 --> 00:01:43.999 
cumulation of risks and I'll get back to

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:47.230 
cumulation of risks and I'll get back to
that<00:01:44.149> later<00:01:44.389> on<00:01:45.189> people<00:01:46.189> did<00:01:46.369> to<00:01:46.549> some<00:01:46.789> extent

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
that later on people did to some extent

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.319 
that later on people did to some extent
choose<00:01:48.130> locations<00:01:49.130> where<00:01:49.819> they<00:01:49.969> minimize

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:50.329 
choose locations where they minimize

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:53.529 
choose locations where they minimize
change<00:01:51.159> for<00:01:52.159> example<00:01:52.700> and<00:01:52.909> this<00:01:53.029> is<00:01:53.240> something

00:01:53.529 --> 00:01:53.539 
change for example and this is something

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:55.179 
change for example and this is something
that<00:01:53.569> applies<00:01:54.020> to<00:01:54.049> this<00:01:54.439> region<00:01:54.829> where<00:01:55.009> you're

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:55.189 
that applies to this region where you're

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:57.429 
that applies to this region where you're
living<00:01:55.399> but<00:01:56.029> we<00:01:56.209> find<00:01:56.569> in<00:01:56.810> Greece<00:01:57.079> that

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:07.089 
active areas and why do they choose them
because<00:02:05.539> those<00:02:05.749> are<00:02:05.990> the<00:02:06.049> areas<00:02:06.200> where<00:02:06.619> nature
