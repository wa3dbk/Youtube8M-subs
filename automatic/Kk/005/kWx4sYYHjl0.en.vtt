00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.250
 so for this tale never touched a 

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:10.629
 diatonic accordion their life here is in 

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:11.290
 one minute to know before 

00:00:10.629 --> 00:00:13.000
 start classes 

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:14.559
 so when you get your 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.509
 diatonic accordion and looks like that 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:18.310
 so here you start by removing 

00:00:16.509 --> 00:00:21.040
 the two thongs there is a thong in 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:24.009
 high it was removed and you have there 

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:26.050
 underneath so you also withdraw this 

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:29.349
 way otherwise you have a little bit of 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:31.029
 badly to play then the accordion he gets 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:32.470
 breaks down three ways you have here 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:33.160
 the right case it fits the 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:36.130
 less watt 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:39.370
 here the left case is here the breath 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:43.270
 and so the soufflÃ© what you need to know 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:44.590
 to open it so to pull that stretches 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:47.290
 screen to bring in the air or for 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:49.060
 push when you make out the air 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:51.510
 you have two options either you press 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:51.510
 on a note 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:58.140
 aulas is clear he will return 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:00.340
 while you shoot while playing the note 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.260
 either you have a little button on the 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:04.000
 left case the button it looks like 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.320
 that on some models it can be a 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.119
 sheep a little wider be you 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:10.479
 press you push it depends on the model 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:13.180
 and by pressing a button you can 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:15.310
 pull your granted at or push without 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.510
 is more typically object when you 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.790
 start a piece if you need 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:20.650
 to start pushing are like that do not 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.290
 you can not play - you take a 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:24.250
 little bit of air and you can play 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.150
 Attention must not rely on this 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.100
 turn there while you play 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:29.229
 because if you press this button 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.270
 there at the same time on a note and baller 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:32.680
 he has two places to go out and so 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:34.730
 so if he needs me to go out 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:37.820
 almost in the amount of the note 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:39.320
 this is the last little thing about the case 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.690
 right you have the notes that fits 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:45.100
 to the melody so the melody is this 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:45.100
 what are we going to play his pieces 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.120
 here and the left hand it fits 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:56.390
 at the bass so the bass 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:59.450
 the accompaniment of the pieces here and 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:01.370
 So it is that's drawing it go 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.870
 woven that's it you left 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:05.890
 for first courses is normally 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:05.890
 you should escape
