now<00:00:39.930> folks<00:00:40.200> you're<00:00:40.410> looking<00:00:40.680> at<00:00:40.800> two

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
now folks you're looking at two

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.970 
now folks you're looking at two
different<00:00:41.010> models<00:00:41.579> here<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.870> green<00:00:43.140> one<00:00:43.440> is<00:00:43.710> a

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
different models here the green one is a

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.979 
different models here the green one is a
d9<00:00:44.789> a<00:00:45.440> and<00:00:46.440> as<00:00:46.800> such<00:00:47.219> it<00:00:47.519> has<00:00:47.760> three<00:00:48.179> axles<00:00:48.750> on

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
d9 a and as such it has three axles on

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.340 
d9 a and as such it has three axles on
each<00:00:49.199> of<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.469> trucks<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:50.519> trucks<00:00:50.789> are<00:00:51.179> the

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:51.350 
each of the trucks the trucks are the

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.520 
each of the trucks the trucks are the
wheel<00:00:52.350> assembly<00:00:52.609> that's<00:00:53.609> on<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.149> locomotive

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:54.530 
wheel assembly that's on the locomotive

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.470 
wheel assembly that's on the locomotive
so<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.829> type<00:00:56.280> of<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.519> typical<00:00:56.969> pipes<00:00:57.179> are

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
so the type of the typical pipes are

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.619 
so the type of the typical pipes are
either<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:57.839> black<00:00:58.230> or<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:59.010> three<00:00:59.370> axle<00:00:59.850> while

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
either the black or the three axle while

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.750 
either the black or the three axle while
the<00:01:00.749> first<00:01:00.929> one<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:03.170> 9961<00:01:04.170> has<00:01:04.860> a<00:01:04.890> three<00:01:05.309> axle

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
the first one the 9961 has a three axle

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.660 
the first one the 9961 has a three axle
truck<00:01:06.030> and<00:01:06.750> so<00:01:07.110> it<00:01:07.260> could<00:01:07.470> have<00:01:07.710> up<00:01:08.100> to<00:01:08.159> three

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670
