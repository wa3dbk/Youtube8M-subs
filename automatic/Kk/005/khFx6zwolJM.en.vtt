00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 suffered from newspapers on the tragedy that yes 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.859
 it is consumed this morning in france 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:11.070
 airbus 320 pain of the airline 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:14.130
 German Germanwings has disappeared from the radar 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:17.730
 around 10 and 30 9 for later 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:20.369
 crashing near the town between 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:26.670
 barcellonette vineyards we are in the south of the 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:30.449
 on board 150 people four 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:33.809
 crew members two lots 144 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.399
 passengers therefore a number that is 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.340
 turned up right in the last few minutes 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:41.129
 we talked about 148 people on board 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:44.399
 the plane that had been delivered to 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:47.700
 lufthansa in 1991 traveled on the 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:49.559
 route between barcelona and dusseldorf e 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.260
 it seems that since the beginning of the flight 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.809
 would have had an abnormal route would be 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:58.170
 precipitated in seconds before 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:00.859
 to fall into a truly imperial area 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:04.739
 hardly mountainous area 

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:06.420
 reachable and mostly snow-covered 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.720
 also for this the French president 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.610
 holland has virtually excluded the 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.310
 possibility that there are survivors 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.740
 more caution instead by the minister 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.619
 of the French interior also because of 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:23.250
 made precisely to the difficulty 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:27.030
 access to the area has meant that 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:29.670
 the rescue teams that left 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.479
 obviously they don't immediately have 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:35.040
 still reached the place 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:39.060
 exact and therefore precisely from the ministry 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:41.100
 transport there is more caution i 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.159
 passengers on board should be 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.860
 especially of German nationality on 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:52.850
 first Spanish to razors assured the 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:55.860
 maximum support for families of 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:02:00.479
 of the victims then we go right now 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:02.130
 to hear some of the voices we have 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.530
 collected in short 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.920
 course of these that these two hours 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:10.950
 let's start immediately with holland and talk about one 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.840
 tragedy expresses sympathy solidarity e 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.330
 then he says we still have to 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:20.010
 check the causes that are me 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:23.250
 we present the president knows how we like it 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:25.530
 they are consequences of mine than of what it is 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.900
 happened will obviously have in the interviews 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:31.140
 with people in place 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:34.110
 obviously also with the king of spain e 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.670
 obviously the German chancellor is one 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:39.060
 tragedy 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.799
 a new aerial tragedy 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:43.230
 obviously we will try to verify 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:47.190
 what are all the causes that like 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:49.560
 you will have caused this unique events 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:52.769
 obviously all our authorities like 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.510
 after all the Spanish ones and also the 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:58.760
 neighboring families if they come 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:01.530
 inform us as soon as possible 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.750
 to do the possible obviously is one 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:06.060
 tragedy that developed on ours 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:10.019
 days territory we will give the widest 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:12.209
 collaboration obviously we will as well 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:14.069
 check to see if there were any 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:15.720
 other consequences 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:19.430
 we know very well that the area a little 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.430
 difficult for access 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:24.359
 in the next few hours ok we will have 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:26.639
 further information 

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:28.709
 obviously in our solidarity and the 

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:30.859
 first thing we give to families 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:30.859
 involved
