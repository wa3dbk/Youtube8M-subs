00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
that he's gonna buy it

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.369 
that he's gonna buy it
that's<00:02:08.879> my<00:02:09.090> shopping<00:02:09.390> approach<00:02:09.840> I<00:02:10.050> know<00:02:10.110> that

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
that's my shopping approach I know that

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.430 
that's my shopping approach I know that
if<00:02:10.470> I<00:02:10.590> go<00:02:10.860> and<00:02:11.039> I'm<00:02:11.160> a<00:02:11.370> lout<00:02:11.610> to<00:02:11.849> that<00:02:12.060> one

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
if I go and I'm a lout to that one

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.340 
if I go and I'm a lout to that one
zip<00:02:12.620> code<00:02:12.890> and<00:02:13.160> if<00:02:13.520> I<00:02:13.640> find<00:02:13.940> a<00:02:14.120> property<00:02:14.630> then<00:02:15.110> I

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
zip code and if I find a property then I

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:17.680 
zip code and if I find a property then I
know<00:02:15.470> that<00:02:16.040> there's<00:02:16.340> probably<00:02:16.430> about<00:02:16.790> a<00:02:16.880> 98%

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
know that there's probably about a 98%

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.260 
know that there's probably about a 98%
chance<00:02:17.990> that<00:02:18.560> I<00:02:18.590> have<00:02:18.920> a<00:02:18.950> buyer<00:02:19.280> for<00:02:19.310> that

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270 
chance that I have a buyer for that

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:23.440 
chance that I have a buyer for that
approach<00:02:20.720> it's<00:02:21.320> it's<00:02:21.890> very<00:02:22.280> good<00:02:22.550> I<00:02:22.760> like<00:02:22.790> to<00:02:23.240> I

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
approach it's it's very good I like to I

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.840 
approach it's it's very good I like to I
like<00:02:23.480> to<00:02:23.900> know<00:02:24.200> that<00:02:24.440> I<00:02:24.500> have<00:02:24.950> a<00:02:24.980> pocket<00:02:25.430> buyer

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
like to know that I have a pocket buyer

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.450 
like to know that I have a pocket buyer
that's<00:02:26.180> gonna<00:02:26.300> buy<00:02:26.510> my<00:02:26.690> properties<00:02:27.230> now<00:02:27.920> let

that's gonna buy my properties now let
me<00:02:28.520> tell<00:02:28.670> you<00:02:28.730> about<00:02:28.820> the<00:02:29.000> other<00:02:29.120> approach<00:02:29.450> the

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
me tell you about the other approach the

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.360 
me tell you about the other approach the
other<00:02:29.750> approach<00:02:30.110> is<00:02:30.320> the<00:02:30.530> deep<00:02:30.770> discount

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
other approach is the deep discount

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:32.890 
other approach is the deep discount
approach<00:02:31.670> and<00:02:31.880> this<00:02:32.030> is<00:02:32.210> the<00:02:32.330> approach<00:02:32.660> that

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
approach and this is the approach that

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.950 
approach and this is the approach that
most<00:02:33.260> wholesalers<00:02:34.100> go<00:02:34.250> by<00:02:34.460> now<00:02:35.090> this<00:02:35.660> deep

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:35.960 
most wholesalers go by now this deep

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:37.960 
most wholesalers go by now this deep
discount<00:02:36.440> approach<00:02:36.740> is<00:02:36.920> basically<00:02:37.130> you<00:02:37.640> going

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
discount approach is basically you going

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:39.970 
discount approach is basically you going
out<00:02:38.120> there<00:02:38.150> and<00:02:38.540> you<00:02:38.720> finding<00:02:39.260> a<00:02:39.380> property<00:02:39.890> at

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
out there and you finding a property at

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.040 
out there and you finding a property at
a<00:02:40.040> discount<00:02:40.670> and<00:02:41.000> then<00:02:41.510> you<00:02:41.660> going<00:02:41.870> out<00:02:42.020> there

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
a discount and then you going out there

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:44.050 
a discount and then you going out there
and<00:02:42.350> you<00:02:42.440> know<00:02:42.590> that<00:02:42.740> it's<00:02:42.860> a<00:02:42.950> good<00:02:43.190> deal<00:02:43.490> so

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
and you know that it's a good deal so

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.510 
and you know that it's a good deal so
you<00:02:44.090> go<00:02:44.390> and<00:02:44.600> you<00:02:44.690> find<00:02:44.720> you<00:02:45.110> a<00:02:45.140> buyer<00:02:45.440> for<00:02:45.920> all

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:46.520 
you go and you find you a buyer for all

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:49.270 
you go and you find you a buyer for all
right<00:02:46.730> now<00:02:47.150> the<00:02:47.870> two<00:02:48.080> approaches<00:02:48.740> they're

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
right now the two approaches they're

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.340 
right now the two approaches they're
fairly<00:02:49.790> similar<00:02:50.030> you're<00:02:50.960> dealing<00:02:51.320> with

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.350 
fairly similar you're dealing with

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:55.720 
fairly similar you're dealing with
properties<00:02:52.540> but<00:02:53.540> I'm<00:02:54.290> gonna<00:02:54.470> tell<00:02:54.620> you<00:02:54.830> some

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
properties but I'm gonna tell you some

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.000 
properties but I'm gonna tell you some
some<00:02:56.120> of<00:02:56.210> the<00:02:56.300> the<00:02:57.020> differences<00:02:57.590> in<00:02:57.770> the<00:02:57.860> two

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
some of the the differences in the two

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.820 
some of the the differences in the two
techniques<00:02:58.430> alright<00:02:58.880> so<00:02:59.270> I<00:02:59.600> have<00:03:00.560> the

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:00.830 
techniques alright so I have the

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:02.290 
techniques alright so I have the
shopping<00:03:01.070> approach<00:03:01.460> I<00:03:01.580> go<00:03:01.730> when<00:03:01.850> I<00:03:01.910> find<00:03:02.180> a

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:02.300 
shopping approach I go when I find a

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.270 
shopping approach I go when I find a
property<00:03:02.750> for<00:03:02.960> a<00:03:03.020> particular<00:03:03.500> buyer<00:03:03.740> now

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
property for a particular buyer now

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.240 
property for a particular buyer now
let's<00:03:05.030> take<00:03:05.390> out<00:03:05.600> those<00:03:06.560> two<00:03:06.770> approaches<00:03:07.220> and

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
let's take out those two approaches and

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:10.150 
let's take out those two approaches and
let's<00:03:07.520> say<00:03:07.730> that<00:03:07.760> I<00:03:08.360> just<00:03:09.110> find<00:03:09.320> a<00:03:09.500> property<00:03:09.980> in

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160 
let's say that I just find a property in

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.140 
let's say that I just find a property in
a<00:03:10.250> particular<00:03:10.760> area<00:03:10.940> okay<00:03:11.690> now<00:03:12.260> if<00:03:13.130> I<00:03:13.430> find

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
a particular area okay now if I find

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:15.790 
a particular area okay now if I find
this<00:03:14.390> property<00:03:14.930> and<00:03:15.020> I<00:03:15.080> get<00:03:15.320> it<00:03:15.410> at<00:03:15.500> a<00:03:15.530> deep

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:15.800 
this property and I get it at a deep

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.860 
this property and I get it at a deep
discount<00:03:15.970> then<00:03:16.970> I<00:03:17.060> know<00:03:17.120> that<00:03:17.300> I<00:03:17.480> can<00:03:17.630> go<00:03:17.750> out

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
discount then I know that I can go out

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:19.330 
discount then I know that I can go out
there<00:03:17.900> and<00:03:18.110> I<00:03:18.140> can<00:03:18.260> find<00:03:18.500> me<00:03:18.590> a<00:03:18.650> buyer<00:03:18.860> for<00:03:19.190> it

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
there and I can find me a buyer for it

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.340 
there and I can find me a buyer for it
if<00:03:19.700> I<00:03:19.880> find<00:03:20.180> this<00:03:20.330> property<00:03:20.900> and<00:03:20.989> I<00:03:21.050> know<00:03:21.110> that

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.350 
if I find this property and I know that

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:23.320 
if I find this property and I know that
someone<00:03:21.739> is<00:03:21.890> willing<00:03:22.100> they're<00:03:22.520> there<00:03:22.760> they're

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:23.330 
someone is willing they're there they're

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:24.970 
someone is willing they're there they're
interested<00:03:23.989> in<00:03:24.050> that<00:03:24.200> particular<00:03:24.739> area

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
interested in that particular area

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.190 
interested in that particular area
kazars<00:03:25.700> they<00:03:26.000> may<00:03:26.209> pay<00:03:26.450> more<00:03:26.810> for<00:03:26.840> the

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.200 
kazars they may pay more for the

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.449 
kazars they may pay more for the
property<00:03:27.709> okay

property okay
so<00:03:28.700> let's<00:03:29.090> bring<00:03:29.270> our<00:03:29.420> two<00:03:29.570> scenarios<00:03:29.840> back

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
so let's bring our two scenarios back

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:32.770 
so let's bring our two scenarios back
into<00:03:30.830> play<00:03:31.040> now<00:03:31.520> the<00:03:31.910> one<00:03:32.120> thing<00:03:32.360> that<00:03:32.600> one

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
into play now the one thing that one

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:34.510 
into play now the one thing that one
good<00:03:32.959> thing<00:03:32.989> about<00:03:33.200> the<00:03:33.560> shopping<00:03:33.920> approach

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:34.520 
good thing about the shopping approach

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:38.170 
good thing about the shopping approach
is<00:03:34.760> that<00:03:35.300> you're<00:03:35.870> able<00:03:36.140> to<00:03:36.350> get<00:03:37.010> more<00:03:37.489> for<00:03:38.030> the

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
is that you're able to get more for the

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:41.259 
is that you're able to get more for the
property<00:03:38.890> whereas<00:03:39.890> if<00:03:40.640> it<00:03:40.850> was<00:03:40.970> a<00:03:41.000> deep

00:03:41.259 --> 00:03:41.269 
property whereas if it was a deep

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:43.000 
property whereas if it was a deep
discount<00:03:41.630> you're<00:03:42.290> gonna<00:03:42.470> have<00:03:42.650> to<00:03:42.739> get<00:03:42.890> that

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010 
discount you're gonna have to get that

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:46.030 
discount you're gonna have to get that
property<00:03:43.390> deeply<00:03:44.390> discounted<00:03:45.110> now<00:03:45.709> an

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:46.040 
property deeply discounted now an

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.580 
property deeply discounted now an
example<00:03:46.940> I<00:03:47.150> know<00:03:47.450> for<00:03:47.959> instance<00:03:48.019> that<00:03:48.350> my

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:48.590 
example I know for instance that my

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:50.229

I<00:04:10.640> combine<00:04:10.910> the<00:04:11.480> two<00:04:11.510> approaches<00:04:12.290> and<00:04:12.440> I<00:04:12.530> gonna

00:04:12.759 --> 00:04:12.769 
I combine the two approaches and I gonna

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:15.940

area<00:04:16.489> where<00:04:16.850> one<00:04:17.000> of<00:04:17.150> my<00:04:17.239> buyers<00:04:17.540> are

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:17.870 
area where one of my buyers are

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:20.370 
area where one of my buyers are
interested<00:04:18.140> into<00:04:18.680> that<00:04:18.859> what<00:04:19.370> I<00:04:19.400> can<00:04:19.760> do<00:04:19.940> is

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:20.380 
interested into that what I can do is

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:23.520 
interested into that what I can do is
can<00:04:20.530> make<00:04:20.680> a<00:04:20.709> large<00:04:21.160> spray<00:04:21.940> on<00:04:22.420> that<00:04:22.930> property

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:23.530 
can make a large spray on that property

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:26.190 
can make a large spray on that property
because<00:04:24.400> I<00:04:24.640> got<00:04:24.940> it<00:04:25.090> at<00:04:25.210> a<00:04:25.240> deep<00:04:25.480> discount<00:04:25.510> in

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:26.200 
because I got it at a deep discount in

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.350 
because I got it at a deep discount in
the<00:04:26.590> area<00:04:27.040> that<00:04:27.220> this<00:04:27.460> individual<00:04:28.090> is

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:28.360 
the area that this individual is

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.900 
the area that this individual is
interested<00:04:29.320> in<00:04:29.440> and<00:04:29.740> I<00:04:30.220> can<00:04:30.400> go<00:04:30.520> and<00:04:30.640> I<00:04:30.730> can

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:30.910 
interested in and I can go and I can

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:33.950 
interested in and I can go and I can
sell<00:04:31.120> it<00:04:31.150> to<00:04:31.270> him<00:04:31.540> around<00:04:31.900> 80%<00:04:32.430> market<00:04:33.430> value

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
sell it to him around 80% market value

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.360 
sell it to him around 80% market value
so<00:04:34.960> that's<00:04:35.170> something<00:04:35.380> to<00:04:35.560> think<00:04:35.650> about<00:04:36.160> guys

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:36.370 
so that's something to think about guys

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:40.710 
so that's something to think about guys
I<00:04:37.200> use<00:04:38.200> a<00:04:38.650> variation<00:04:39.340> of<00:04:39.760> the<00:04:39.880> two<00:04:40.150> techniques

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:40.720 
I use a variation of the two techniques

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:45.360 
I use a variation of the two techniques
and<00:04:41.080> the<00:04:41.740> reason<00:04:42.100> being<00:04:42.250> is<00:04:42.490> because<00:04:42.700> I<00:04:43.830> do<00:04:44.830> I

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:45.370 
and the reason being is because I do I

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:47.640 
and the reason being is because I do I
like<00:04:45.940> to<00:04:45.970> just<00:04:46.330> the<00:04:46.720> the<00:04:46.930> list<00:04:47.110> that<00:04:47.320> I<00:04:47.410> go

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:47.650 
like to just the the list that I go

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:49.470 
like to just the the list that I go
after<00:04:47.830> they<00:04:48.130> cover<00:04:48.430> the<00:04:48.640> whole<00:04:48.670> city<00:04:49.180> I<00:04:49.300> don't

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:49.480 
after they cover the whole city I don't

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:52.410 
after they cover the whole city I don't
really<00:04:49.780> target<00:04:50.320> a<00:04:50.380> specific<00:04:50.860> area<00:04:51.130> now<00:04:51.790> when

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:52.420 
really target a specific area now when

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:54.240 
really target a specific area now when
I'm<00:04:52.570> working<00:04:53.050> in<00:04:53.170> certain<00:04:53.620> areas<00:04:54.010> and<00:04:54.160> I'm

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:54.250 
I'm working in certain areas and I'm

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:56.940 
I'm working in certain areas and I'm
dealing<00:04:54.460> with<00:04:54.610> only<00:04:55.090> my<00:04:55.540> specific<00:04:56.260> buyers<00:04:56.500> and

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:56.950 
dealing with only my specific buyers and

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:58.290 
dealing with only my specific buyers and
that's<00:04:57.160> when<00:04:57.340> I<00:04:57.400> use<00:04:57.610> the<00:04:57.760> shotgun<00:04:58.000> approach

00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:58.300 
that's when I use the shotgun approach

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:00.720 
that's when I use the shotgun approach
now<00:04:58.930> I<00:04:59.110> do<00:04:59.260> not<00:04:59.650> recommend<00:05:00.070> using<00:05:00.460> the

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:00.730 
now I do not recommend using the

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:02.430 
now I do not recommend using the
shopping<00:05:01.180> approach<00:05:01.510> if<00:05:01.720> you're<00:05:01.870> fairly<00:05:02.260> new

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:02.440 
shopping approach if you're fairly new

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:05.040 
shopping approach if you're fairly new
to<00:05:02.950> wholesaling<00:05:03.430> and<00:05:04.240> the<00:05:04.330> reason<00:05:04.660> being<00:05:04.840> is

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:05.050 
to wholesaling and the reason being is

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:09.630 
to wholesaling and the reason being is
because<00:05:06.660> what<00:05:07.660> I<00:05:07.690> realized<00:05:08.080> is<00:05:08.680> that<00:05:08.710> when<00:05:09.340> new

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:09.640 
because what I realized is that when new

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:12.090 
because what I realized is that when new
wholesalers<00:05:10.510> and<00:05:10.660> I<00:05:10.720> faced<00:05:11.050> this<00:05:11.260> myself<00:05:11.830> at

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:12.100 
wholesalers and I faced this myself at

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:14.040 
wholesalers and I faced this myself at
when<00:05:12.610> I<00:05:12.640> first<00:05:13.000> started<00:05:13.390> when<00:05:13.810> new

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:14.050 
when I first started when new

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:16.530 
when I first started when new
wholesalers<00:05:14.890> work<00:05:15.520> with<00:05:15.760> experienced

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:16.540 
wholesalers work with experienced

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:20.370 
wholesalers work with experienced
individuals<00:05:17.670> there's<00:05:18.670> a<00:05:19.140> possibility<00:05:20.140> that

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:20.380 
individuals there's a possibility that

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:22.890 
individuals there's a possibility that
those<00:05:20.950> investors<00:05:21.640> could<00:05:21.910> try<00:05:22.300> to<00:05:22.360> take

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:22.900 
those investors could try to take

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:25.320 
those investors could try to take
advantage<00:05:23.410> of<00:05:23.590> you<00:05:23.770> I've<00:05:24.760> seen<00:05:25.150> it<00:05:25.300> happen
