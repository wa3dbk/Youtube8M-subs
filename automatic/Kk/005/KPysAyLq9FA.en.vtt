00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.760 
little sticker this little paper in
there<00:00:51.649> on<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:52.920> cpu<00:00:53.399> so<00:00:54.320> please<00:00:55.320> read<00:00:55.559> before

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
there on the cpu so please read before

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.709 
there on the cpu so please read before
installing<00:00:56.280> cpu<00:00:56.850> number<00:00:57.750> one<00:00:59.570> unlock<00:01:00.570> the

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
installing cpu number one unlock the

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.540 
installing cpu number one unlock the
soccer<00:01:00.960> level<00:01:01.410> by<00:01:01.559> pushing<00:01:01.770> it<00:01:01.980> down<00:01:02.129> blah

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
soccer level by pushing it down blah

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.810 
soccer level by pushing it down blah
blah<00:01:03.710> so<00:01:04.710> I'm<00:01:04.769> pretty<00:01:05.040> close<00:01:05.309> with<00:01:05.339> a<00:01:05.549> pin

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
blah so I'm pretty close with a pin

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.920 
blah so I'm pretty close with a pin
number<00:01:06.180> two<00:01:07.490> and<00:01:08.490> three<00:01:08.880> so<00:01:09.510> you<00:01:09.689> get<00:01:09.810> the

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
number two and three so you get the

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.670 
number two and three so you get the
whole<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.560> whole<00:01:11.369> point<00:01:12.080> so<00:01:13.080> again<00:01:13.290> for<00:01:13.320> this

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
whole the whole point so again for this

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:22.510 
whole the whole point so again for this
a<00:01:14.900> computer<00:01:16.340> I'm<00:01:17.340> going<00:01:17.549> to<00:01:17.610> use<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:20.810> ichor<00:01:21.810> 7

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
a computer I'm going to use the ichor 7

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:31.749 
a computer I'm going to use the ichor 7

1155<00:01:32.759> I<00:01:33.170> 726<00:01:34.170> I<00:01:34.229> ok<00:01:34.560> ok<00:01:35.119> as<00:01:36.119> I<00:01:36.360> said<00:01:36.420> this<00:01:36.750> is<00:01:36.810> the

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
1155 I 726 I ok ok as I said this is the

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.660 
1155 I 726 I ok ok as I said this is the
one<00:01:37.229> that<00:01:37.439> you<00:01:37.530> can<00:01:37.680> overclock<00:01:38.130> rush<00:01:38.400> to

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
one that you can overclock rush to

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.840 
one that you can overclock rush to
there's<00:01:38.909> one<00:01:39.119> that's<00:01:39.570> just<00:01:39.960> 2600<00:01:40.799> and<00:01:40.920> this

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
there's one that's just 2600 and this

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.370 
there's one that's just 2600 and this
120<00:01:42.329> screen<00:01:42.570> ok<00:01:42.869> the<00:01:43.079> one<00:01:43.110> you<00:01:43.350> can<00:01:43.500> overclock

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
120 screen ok the one you can overclock

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:51.219 
120 screen ok the one you can overclock
so<00:01:47.000> this<00:01:48.000> cpu<00:01:48.630> costs<00:01:48.960> about<00:01:49.470> almost<00:01:49.979> like<00:01:50.189> 330

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:51.229 
so this cpu costs about almost like 330

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:56.899 
so this cpu costs about almost like 330
so<00:01:52.229> again<00:01:55.280> see<00:01:56.280> where<00:01:56.460> you<00:01:56.549> can<00:01:56.670> get<00:01:56.790> the

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
so again see where you can get the

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.590 
so again see where you can get the
cheapest<00:01:57.210> price<00:01:57.479> I<00:01:57.659> got<00:01:57.869> this<00:01:57.990> for<00:01:59.360> 250<00:02:00.360> bucks

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
cheapest price I got this for 250 bucks

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.109 
cheapest price I got this for 250 bucks

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
people who don't have microcenter go to

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.960 
people who don't have microcenter go to
line<00:02:11.540> and<00:02:12.540> by<00:02:12.810> I<00:02:13.250> think<00:02:14.250> they<00:02:14.340> offer<00:02:14.490> free

looking to see you know the between the
spaces<00:02:22.110> between<00:02:22.670> the<00:02:23.670> radiator<00:02:24.060> and<00:02:24.180> the

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
spaces between the radiator and the

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:25.940 
spaces between the radiator and the
mother<00:02:24.420> port<00:02:24.720> so<00:02:24.870> I<00:02:25.110> don't<00:02:25.140> know<00:02:25.350> how<00:02:25.560> I'm

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
mother port so I don't know how I'm

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.540 
mother port so I don't know how I'm
going<00:02:26.100> to<00:02:26.220> see<00:02:26.550> that's<00:02:26.910> gonna<00:02:27.090> work<00:02:27.950> I<00:02:28.950> still

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
going to see that's gonna work I still

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.280 
going to see that's gonna work I still
like<00:02:29.730> this<00:02:29.940> case<00:02:30.210> I<00:02:30.510> already<00:02:30.630> don't<00:02:30.960> want<00:02:31.080> to

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
like this case I already don't want to

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.550 
like this case I already don't want to
trade<00:02:31.500> it<00:02:31.620> in<00:02:31.740> and<00:02:33.410> but<00:02:34.410> if<00:02:34.620> I<00:02:34.800> have<00:02:35.130> to<00:02:35.160> I

trade it in and but if I have to I

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.670 
trade it in and but if I have to I
probably<00:02:37.560> will<00:02:37.710> get<00:02:37.950> the<00:02:38.190> 800<00:02:38.730> series<00:02:38.940> but<00:02:39.750> so

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
probably will get the 800 series but so

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.430 
probably will get the 800 series but so
far<00:02:40.890> I<00:02:40.950> don't<00:02:41.160> think<00:02:41.550> I<00:02:41.670> am<00:02:42.240> see<00:02:42.960> how<00:02:43.140> it<00:02:43.200> goes

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
far I don't think I am see how it goes

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:48.440 
far I don't think I am see how it goes
between<00:02:43.920> the<00:02:44.510> spacing<00:02:45.510> of<00:02:45.630> the<00:02:46.340> cooling<00:02:47.450> all

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
between the spacing of the cooling all

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.630 
between the spacing of the cooling all
right<00:02:48.950> and<00:02:49.950> then<00:02:50.100> I'm<00:02:50.220> just<00:02:50.250> gonna<00:02:50.430> go<00:02:50.490> ahead

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
right and then I'm just gonna go ahead

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.900 
right and then I'm just gonna go ahead
and<00:02:50.730> put<00:02:50.910> the<00:02:51.030> hard<00:02:51.240> drives<00:02:51.510> here<00:02:52.700> see<00:02:53.700> how<00:02:53.850> the

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
and put the hard drives here see how the

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.640 
and put the hard drives here see how the
video<00:02:54.210> card<00:02:54.420> face<00:02:54.690> thing<00:02:55.050> you'll<00:02:55.200> fit<00:02:55.440> the

video card face thing you'll fit the

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.740 
video card face thing you'll fit the
