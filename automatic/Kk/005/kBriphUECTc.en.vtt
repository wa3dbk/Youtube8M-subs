like phaser which is like wishy let's
load<00:01:09.080> this<00:01:09.200> up<00:01:09.380> baby<00:01:12.100> so<00:01:13.100> this<00:01:13.310> is<00:01:13.400> what<00:01:13.520> kind

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:13.729 
load this up baby so this is what kind

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:15.820 
load this up baby so this is what kind
of<00:01:13.790> reminds<00:01:14.180> me<00:01:14.360> it's<00:01:14.870> not<00:01:14.990> exact<00:01:15.410> but<00:01:15.680> it's

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:15.830 
of reminds me it's not exact but it's

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:29.770 
of reminds me it's not exact but it's
like<00:01:16.010> Beck<00:01:16.490> where<00:01:17.000> it's<00:01:17.180> at<00:01:28.450> that<00:01:29.450> sort<00:01:29.690> of

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
like Beck where it's at that sort of

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.490 
like Beck where it's at that sort of
thing<00:01:30.020> and<00:01:30.250> let's<00:01:31.250> switch<00:01:31.760> to<00:01:32.119> another<00:01:32.330> one<00:01:32.780> so

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:33.500 
thing and let's switch to another one so

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.880 
thing and let's switch to another one so
a<00:01:34.369> flanger<00:01:35.119> old<00:01:35.360> heavy<00:01:35.780> distortion<00:01:36.260> could<00:01:36.800> be

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
a flanger old heavy distortion could be

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:37.480 
a flanger old heavy distortion could be
cool

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490 
cool

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:39.130 
cool
we<00:01:37.670> like<00:01:37.910> that<00:01:38.180> I<00:01:38.390> guess<00:01:38.570> this<00:01:38.720> is<00:01:38.780> a<00:01:38.840> medium

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
we like that I guess this is a medium

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:40.390 
we like that I guess this is a medium
when<00:01:39.229> they<00:01:39.290> come<00:01:39.440> in<00:01:39.530> different<00:01:39.619> sample<00:01:40.190> sets

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:40.400 
when they come in different sample sets

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.790 
when they come in different sample sets
depending<00:01:40.520> how<00:01:41.090> much<00:01:41.240> memory<00:01:41.479> I<00:01:41.630> have<00:01:41.960> but

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:42.800 
depending how much memory I have but

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:46.649 
depending how much memory I have but
we'll<00:01:42.979> try

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:46.659 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:55.359 

yeah<00:01:47.659> like<00:01:47.870> a<00:01:47.990> grudge

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:55.369 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:59.599 

and<00:01:57.229> okay<00:01:58.229> well<00:01:58.439> actually<00:01:58.829> load<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.130> biggest

00:01:59.599 --> 00:01:59.609
