holes are slightly larger and you can

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.670 
holes are slightly larger and you can
definitely<00:01:26.850> tell<00:01:27.450> when<00:01:27.509> listening<00:01:28.229> to<00:01:28.320> music

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
definitely tell when listening to music

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.109 
definitely tell when listening to music
that<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.729> newer<00:01:30.060> version<00:01:30.570> is<00:01:30.920> definitely

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:32.119 
that the newer version is definitely

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:37.130 
that the newer version is definitely
much<00:01:33.119> much<00:01:33.840> louder<00:01:34.400> not<00:01:35.400> not<00:01:36.180> to<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:36.960> point

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
much much louder not not to the point

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.380 
much much louder not not to the point
where<00:01:37.320> it's<00:01:37.950> like<00:01:38.070> boom<00:01:38.490> sound

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
where it's like boom sound

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.960 
where it's like boom sound
compared<00:01:40.140> to<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.530> old<00:01:40.650> one<00:01:40.860> but<00:01:41.550> you<00:01:41.820> can

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
compared to the old one but you can

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.510 
compared to the old one but you can
definitely<00:01:42.180> tell<00:01:42.600> the<00:01:43.110> difference<00:01:43.530> and<00:01:43.800> so

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
definitely tell the difference and so

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.030 
definitely tell the difference and so
now<00:01:44.700> I'm<00:01:44.850> going<00:01:44.880> to<00:01:45.330> do<00:01:45.480> two<00:01:46.470> different<00:01:46.830> clips

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
now I'm going to do two different clips

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.050 
now I'm going to do two different clips
of<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.610> bones<00:01:48.140> playing<00:01:49.140> music<00:01:50.010> and<00:01:50.220> we're

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
of the bones playing music and we're

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.170 
of the bones playing music and we're
gonna<00:01:51.180> see<00:01:51.570> if<00:01:51.930> you<00:01:52.620> can<00:01:52.860> tell<00:01:53.160> which<00:01:53.970> is<00:01:54.000> which

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
gonna see if you can tell which is which

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.620 
gonna see if you can tell which is which
basically<00:01:55.340> okay<00:01:56.340> so<00:01:56.400> now<00:01:56.850> we're<00:01:57.300> going<00:01:57.510> to

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
basically okay so now we're going to

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.070 
basically okay so now we're going to
start<00:01:58.170> playing<00:01:58.470> the<00:01:58.920> music<00:01:59.310> from<00:02:00.300> the<00:02:00.750> first

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:01.080 
start playing the music from the first

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.100 
start playing the music from the first
device<00:02:01.500> which<00:02:01.830> I<00:02:02.040> will<00:02:02.250> not<00:02:02.729> say<00:02:03.090> which<00:02:03.840> one

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
device which I will not say which one

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.219 
device which I will not say which one
will<00:02:04.320> play<00:02:04.560> first<00:02:05.330> just<00:02:06.330> to<00:02:06.540> see<00:02:06.570> if<00:02:06.869> you<00:02:06.900> can

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
will play first just to see if you can

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:39.990 
will play first just to see if you can
guess

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.960 

so<00:02:41.000> the<00:02:41.599> old<00:02:41.989> one<00:02:42.319> was<00:02:42.530> actually<00:02:43.190> the<00:02:43.520> first

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
so the old one was actually the first

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.270 
so the old one was actually the first
and<00:02:44.450> the<00:02:44.810> new<00:02:44.989> one<00:02:45.200> was<00:02:45.410> the<00:02:45.590> second<00:02:46.069> and

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
and the new one was the second and

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.699 
and the new one was the second and
hopefully<00:02:46.819> you<00:02:46.940> could<00:02:47.120> hear<00:02:47.480> not<00:02:48.050> only<00:02:48.080> louder

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
hopefully you could hear not only louder

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:52.120 
hopefully you could hear not only louder
sound<00:02:49.190> but<00:02:49.489> better<00:02:49.700> quality<00:02:50.860> definitely<00:02:51.860> hard

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
sound but better quality definitely hard

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:57.750 
sound but better quality definitely hard
to<00:02:52.220> show<00:02:52.640> that<00:02:52.670> in<00:02:53.209> this<00:02:53.780> video<00:02:54.790> as<00:02:56.380> opposed<00:02:57.380> to

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
to show that in this video as opposed to

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.449

on<00:03:04.310> to<00:03:04.519> the<00:03:04.819> hardware<00:03:05.420> buttons<00:03:05.930> and<00:03:06.230> just<00:03:06.980> just

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
on to the hardware buttons and just just

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.640 
on to the hardware buttons and just just
a<00:03:07.940> little<00:03:08.269> bit<00:03:08.420> about<00:03:08.690> how<00:03:08.989> they're<00:03:09.260> better

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
a little bit about how they're better

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:13.210 
a little bit about how they're better
now<00:03:10.550> as<00:03:11.360> opposed<00:03:11.840> to<00:03:12.050> the<00:03:12.319> in<00:03:12.470> the<00:03:12.620> in<00:03:12.800> the<00:03:13.100> old

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
now as opposed to the in the in the old

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:17.559 
now as opposed to the in the in the old
version<00:03:13.430> basically<00:03:15.370> now<00:03:16.370> I'm<00:03:16.400> going<00:03:17.150> to<00:03:17.330> take

00:03:17.559 --> 00:03:17.569 
version basically now I'm going to take

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:20.050 
version basically now I'm going to take
the<00:03:17.780> older<00:03:18.319> version<00:03:18.920> of<00:03:19.069> the<00:03:19.190> Nexus<00:03:19.549> 5<00:03:19.790> and

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
the older version of the Nexus 5 and

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.770 
the older version of the Nexus 5 and
shake<00:03:20.810> it<00:03:20.959> a<00:03:21.019> little<00:03:21.049> bit<00:03:21.410> just<00:03:21.739> so<00:03:21.860> you<00:03:22.010> can

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
shake it a little bit just so you can

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:27.670 
shake it a little bit just so you can
listen<00:03:23.780> to<00:03:24.410> how<00:03:25.630> jiggly<00:03:26.630> or<00:03:26.870> loud<00:03:27.200> the<00:03:27.440> keys

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
listen to how jiggly or loud the keys

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.910 
listen to how jiggly or loud the keys
are<00:03:27.890> when<00:03:28.069> you<00:03:28.220> just<00:03:28.430> shake<00:03:28.790> the<00:03:29.299> phone<00:03:29.920> any

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:30.920 
are when you just shake the phone any

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:33.850 
are when you just shake the phone any
amount<00:03:31.459> so<00:03:32.120> when<00:03:32.299> you<00:03:32.390> shake<00:03:32.660> this<00:03:32.900> this<00:03:33.680> is

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:33.860 
amount so when you shake this this is

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:35.729 
amount so when you shake this this is
the<00:03:33.980> old<00:03:34.069> version<00:03:34.160> and<00:03:34.640> the<00:03:34.730> keys<00:03:34.940> to<00:03:35.209> go<00:03:35.360> a<00:03:35.390> lot

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:35.739 
the old version and the keys to go a lot

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:38.530 
the old version and the keys to go a lot
there's<00:03:36.739> a<00:03:36.830> big<00:03:37.160> difference<00:03:37.760> this<00:03:38.239> is<00:03:38.390> pretty

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 
there's a big difference this is pretty

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.210 
there's a big difference this is pretty
much<00:03:38.690> the<00:03:38.900> only<00:03:39.140> difference<00:03:39.470> between<00:03:39.920> the

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
much the only difference between the

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.210 
much the only difference between the
keys<00:03:40.400> but<00:03:41.060> it<00:03:41.900> makes<00:03:42.440> for<00:03:42.560> a<00:03:42.709> more<00:03:42.890> sturdy

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
keys but it makes for a more sturdy

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:46.240 
keys but it makes for a more sturdy
build<00:03:43.609> whenever<00:03:44.180> they're<00:03:44.450> more<00:03:44.840> firm<00:03:45.230> and<00:03:45.680> not

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.250 
build whenever they're more firm and not

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:54.570 
build whenever they're more firm and not
as<00:03:46.459> jiggly<00:03:47.150> so<00:03:47.540> we'll<00:03:47.900> just<00:03:48.170> listen<00:03:48.470> to<00:03:48.650> this

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:54.580 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:58.119 

okay<00:03:55.580> so<00:03:55.640> now<00:03:56.120> we<00:03:56.180> are<00:03:56.569> going<00:03:56.750> to<00:03:56.900> take<00:03:57.260> the<00:03:57.680> new

00:03:58.119 --> 00:03:58.129 
okay so now we are going to take the new

00:03:58.129 --> 00:04:01.679 
okay so now we are going to take the new
version<00:03:58.730> and<00:03:58.939> this<00:03:59.480> one<00:03:59.689> will<00:04:00.110> is<00:04:00.590> a<00:04:00.650> lot<00:04:01.159> more

00:04:01.679 --> 00:04:01.689 
version and this one will is a lot more

00:04:01.689 --> 00:04:05.890 
version and this one will is a lot more
less<00:04:02.689> jiggly<00:04:03.110> basically<00:04:03.590> and<00:04:04.540> more<00:04:05.540> quiet

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:05.900 
less jiggly basically and more quiet

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:08.890 
less jiggly basically and more quiet
when<00:04:06.170> you<00:04:06.349> shake<00:04:06.860> the<00:04:07.549> device<00:04:07.700> so<00:04:08.299> let's<00:04:08.659> go

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:08.900 
when you shake the device so let's go

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:11.350 
when you shake the device so let's go
ahead<00:04:09.049> and<00:04:09.379> see<00:04:10.040> what<00:04:10.610> it<00:04:10.730> sounds<00:04:10.909> like<00:04:11.090> when

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:11.360 
ahead and see what it sounds like when

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:13.990 
ahead and see what it sounds like when
you<00:04:11.480> shake<00:04:11.720> it<00:04:11.750> exactly<00:04:12.560> the<00:04:12.799> same<00:04:12.829> way<00:04:13.280> the

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.000 
you shake it exactly the same way the

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:25.130 
you shake it exactly the same way the
same<00:04:14.390> distance<00:04:14.959> from<00:04:15.200> the<00:04:15.890> mic

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:25.140 

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:27.810 

so<00:04:26.140> now<00:04:26.470> that<00:04:26.530> you've<00:04:26.950> seen<00:04:27.220> the<00:04:27.430> difference

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:27.820 
so now that you've seen the difference

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:31.050 
so now that you've seen the difference
between<00:04:28.090> these<00:04:28.570> two<00:04:28.870> devices<00:04:29.730> basically<00:04:30.730> it's

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:31.060 
between these two devices basically it's

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:34.520 
between these two devices basically it's
up<00:04:31.270> to<00:04:31.420> you<00:04:31.510> whether<00:04:32.370> whether<00:04:33.370> you<00:04:33.520> think<00:04:33.910> is

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 
up to you whether whether you think is

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:37.290 
up to you whether whether you think is
even<00:04:35.530> much<00:04:35.920> of<00:04:36.070> a<00:04:36.160> difference<00:04:36.520> or<00:04:36.760> worth<00:04:37.090> the

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:37.300 
even much of a difference or worth the

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:40.590 
even much of a difference or worth the
difference<00:04:37.690> to<00:04:38.500> maybe<00:04:39.040> send<00:04:39.520> yours<00:04:39.910> back<00:04:40.270> as<00:04:40.540> a

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:40.600 
difference to maybe send yours back as a

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:44.190 
difference to maybe send yours back as a
defective<00:04:41.290> product<00:04:41.620> and<00:04:42.040> get<00:04:42.670> the<00:04:43.200> revised

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:47.410 
version basically to me I don't think

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:49.830 
version basically to me I don't think
it's<00:04:47.650> worth<00:04:47.860> all<00:04:48.100> that<00:04:48.580> hassle<00:04:48.850> just<00:04:49.480> to<00:04:49.690> do
