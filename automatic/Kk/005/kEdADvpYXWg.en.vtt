00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670 
its entirety the great thing about this

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:00.700 
its entirety the great thing about this
is<00:00:58.910> it's<00:00:59.359> a<00:00:59.510> bit<00:00:59.719> of<00:00:59.809> a<00:00:59.870> unique<00:01:00.019> design<00:01:00.350> it's

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:00.710 
is it's a bit of a unique design it's

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.459 
is it's a bit of a unique design it's
modeled<00:01:01.129> after<00:01:01.280> the<00:01:01.670> american<00:01:02.239> sand<00:01:03.199> rails

00:01:03.459 --> 00:01:03.469 
modeled after the american sand rails

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:05.260 
modeled after the american sand rails
that<00:01:03.859> run<00:01:04.040> around<00:01:04.129> in<00:01:04.430> the<00:01:04.460> June's<00:01:04.760> of<00:01:04.940> Glamis

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:05.270 
that run around in the June's of Glamis

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:07.900 
that run around in the June's of Glamis
so<00:01:06.260> I'm<00:01:06.620> a<00:01:06.680> little<00:01:06.770> bit<00:01:06.920> different<00:01:07.340> a<00:01:07.460> little

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:07.910 
so I'm a little bit different a little

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:10.500 
so I'm a little bit different a little
bit<00:01:08.030> exciting<00:01:08.540> and<00:01:09.020> very<00:01:09.320> good<00:01:09.470> to<00:01:09.530> look<00:01:09.620> at

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:10.510 
bit exciting and very good to look at

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:12.580 
bit exciting and very good to look at
some<00:01:11.510> of<00:01:11.600> the<00:01:11.660> features<00:01:11.780> that<00:01:12.020> will<00:01:12.290> make<00:01:12.440> this

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590
