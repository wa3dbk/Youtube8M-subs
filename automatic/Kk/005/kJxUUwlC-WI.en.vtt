I<00:00:01.639> had<00:00:02.639> a<00:00:02.669> few<00:00:02.970> of<00:00:03.060> my<00:00:03.210> subscribers<00:00:03.449> asked<00:00:04.319> me

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:04.620 
I had a few of my subscribers asked me

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.330 
I had a few of my subscribers asked me
how<00:00:04.890> I<00:00:05.310> put<00:00:05.819> this<00:00:06.089> car<00:00:06.779> together<00:00:06.960> my<00:00:07.500> sheet

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
how I put this car together my sheet

one of my subscribers Robo dude 360 is
actually<00:00:17.760> trying<00:00:18.060> it<00:00:23.090> so<00:00:24.090> I<00:00:24.119> figured<00:00:24.720> I<00:00:24.810> would

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
actually trying it so I figured I would

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.759 
actually trying it so I figured I would
just<00:00:25.580> go<00:00:26.580> over<00:00:26.970> it<00:00:27.090> because<00:00:27.720> I<00:00:27.900> haven't<00:00:28.680> gone

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
just go over it because I haven't gone

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:35.180 
just go over it because I haven't gone
over<00:00:28.830> it<00:00:29.160> before<00:00:29.279> I<00:00:33.350> mean<00:00:34.350> basically<00:00:34.559> that's

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
over it before I mean basically that's

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.119 
over it before I mean basically that's
just<00:00:35.489> angled<00:00:35.940> metal<00:00:36.300> then<00:00:36.719> I<00:00:37.079> scratched<00:00:37.829> in

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
just angled metal then I scratched in

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.430 
just angled metal then I scratched in

actually<00:02:23.400> two<00:02:23.580> pieces<00:02:23.819> of<00:02:24.209> sheet<00:02:24.660> metal<00:02:24.870> I

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
actually two pieces of sheet metal I

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.240 
actually two pieces of sheet metal I
just<00:02:27.120> cut<00:02:27.569> into<00:02:27.840> a<00:02:27.870> triangular<00:02:28.530> fashion<00:02:28.830> and

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
just cut into a triangular fashion and

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.789 
just cut into a triangular fashion and
bent<00:02:29.459> down<00:02:29.790> and<00:02:29.819> put<00:02:30.290> toothpicks<00:02:31.290> on<00:02:31.500> it<00:02:31.650> and

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:31.799 
bent down and put toothpicks on it and

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:37.750 
bent down and put toothpicks on it and
dipped<00:02:32.310> it<00:02:32.489> into<00:02:32.670> some<00:02:33.200> green<00:02:34.200> paint<00:02:36.170> or<00:02:37.170> the

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
dipped it into some green paint or the

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.990 
dipped it into some green paint or the
capacitors<00:02:38.760> out<00:02:39.239> of<00:02:39.420> the<00:02:40.370> directv<00:02:41.370> box<00:02:41.579> once

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
capacitors out of the directv box once

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.020 
capacitors out of the directv box once
again<00:02:42.269> shh<00:02:43.730> don't<00:02:44.730> need<00:02:44.940> them<00:02:45.120> finding<00:02:45.540> out

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
again shh don't need them finding out

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.600 
again shh don't need them finding out
underneath<00:02:48.030> it's<00:02:48.480> just<00:02:48.660> an<00:02:48.810> eco<00:02:49.610> Ferrari

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610

hood<00:03:03.060> was<00:03:03.329> I<00:03:03.450> put<00:03:03.690> it<00:03:03.780> on<00:03:03.870> here<00:03:04.110> as<00:03:04.230> one<00:03:04.440> piece

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
hood was I put it on here as one piece

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:06.349 
hood was I put it on here as one piece
which<00:03:05.040> actually<00:03:05.280> went<00:03:05.670> on<00:03:05.790> top<00:03:06.090> of<00:03:06.269> the

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:06.359 
which actually went on top of the

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
fenders you can see where meets up and

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.770 
fenders you can see where meets up and
then<00:03:09.480> I<00:03:09.750> took<00:03:10.380> a<00:03:10.440> dremel<00:03:10.950> and<00:03:11.160> just<00:03:11.310> cut<00:03:11.970> the

00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:15.569 
outside top of the fender and then right

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:19.879 
outside top of the fender and then right
here<00:03:15.799> I'll<00:03:16.799> cut<00:03:17.069> that<00:03:17.280> cut<00:03:17.970> that<00:03:18.620> you<00:03:19.620> can<00:03:19.739> also

do<00:03:20.160> a<00:03:20.190> sheet<00:03:20.549> metal<00:03:20.670> series<00:03:21.120> you<00:03:21.209> just<00:03:21.359> take<00:03:21.540> it

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
do a sheet metal series you just take it

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.520 
do a sheet metal series you just take it
back<00:03:21.690> off<00:03:22.019> cut<00:03:22.290> it<00:03:22.380> with<00:03:22.470> sears<00:03:22.739> but<00:03:23.700> then<00:03:23.880> I

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 
back off cut it with sears but then I

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:28.580 
back off cut it with sears but then I
got<00:03:25.530> a<00:03:25.560> really<00:03:25.709> strong<00:03:25.799> magnet<00:03:26.400> in<00:03:26.459> here<00:03:27.590> this

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
got a really strong magnet in here this

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.470 
got a really strong magnet in here this
is<00:03:28.769> actually<00:03:29.100> a<00:03:29.160> piece<00:03:29.400> of<00:03:29.430> antenna<00:03:30.060> straw

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
is actually a piece of antenna straw

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:35.599 
is actually a piece of antenna straw
just<00:03:31.079> like<00:03:31.290> this<00:03:33.709> if<00:03:34.709> I<00:03:34.859> glued<00:03:35.220> it<00:03:35.370> to<00:03:35.489> the

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:35.609 
just like this if I glued it to the

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:39.620 
just like this if I glued it to the
underside<00:03:36.060> of<00:03:36.120> the<00:03:36.329> hood<00:03:36.650> so<00:03:37.650> it<00:03:37.799> pivots<00:03:38.630> both

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630 
underside of the hood so it pivots both

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:42.020 
underside of the hood so it pivots both
sides<00:03:40.040> there's<00:03:41.040> a<00:03:41.100> piece<00:03:41.310> of<00:03:41.340> coat<00:03:41.670> hanger

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
sides there's a piece of coat hanger

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:45.020 
sides there's a piece of coat hanger
going<00:03:42.420> through<00:03:43.139> them<00:03:43.410> and<00:03:43.650> then<00:03:44.220> up<00:03:44.430> under<00:03:44.849> the

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
going through them and then up under the

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:48.199 
going through them and then up under the
fender<00:03:45.829> so<00:03:46.829> I<00:03:46.859> had<00:03:47.040> all<00:03:47.220> this<00:03:47.370> clothes<00:03:47.760> when<00:03:48.120> I

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
fender so I had all this clothes when I

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:52.640 
fender so I had all this clothes when I
when<00:03:48.750> I<00:03:48.810> glued<00:03:49.530> all<00:03:49.769> that<00:03:51.049> like<00:03:52.049> the<00:03:52.200> bar<00:03:52.440> up

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
when I glued all that like the bar up

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.420 
when I glued all that like the bar up
underneath<00:03:52.950> so<00:03:53.489> it<00:03:53.519> would<00:03:53.670> be<00:03:53.849> flat<00:03:55.370> when<00:03:56.370> it

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
underneath so it would be flat when it

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:03.699 
underneath so it would be flat when it
closes<00:03:58.010> meets<00:03:59.010> up<00:03:59.250> like<00:03:59.459> it<00:03:59.639> was<00:03:59.669> meant<00:03:59.940> to<00:04:00.120> be

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:03.709 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:06.589 

there<00:04:04.709> is<00:04:04.889> a<00:04:04.919> hoverboard<00:04:05.669> in<00:04:05.910> the<00:04:06.030> passenger

00:04:06.589 --> 00:04:06.599 
there is a hoverboard in the passenger

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:09.539 
there is a hoverboard in the passenger
seat

00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:09.549 

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:13.630 

ignore<00:04:10.549> the<00:04:10.870> drawing<00:04:11.870> of<00:04:12.019> it<00:04:12.140> in<00:04:12.739> the<00:04:13.040> back

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:13.640 
ignore the drawing of it in the back

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:17.140 
ignore the drawing of it in the back
back<00:04:14.060> there<00:04:15.070> there's<00:04:16.070> actually<00:04:16.729> a<00:04:16.759> flex

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:17.150 
back there there's actually a flex

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:21.460 
back there there's actually a flex
capacitor<00:04:17.989> on<00:04:18.199> the<00:04:18.350> back<00:04:18.560> wall<00:04:20.289> so<00:04:21.289> I<00:04:21.320> actually
