00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.859 
and I'm gonna ask you guys this question
did<00:01:35.460> they<00:01:35.610> fix<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:36.090> problems<00:01:36.509> that<00:01:36.600> led<00:01:36.810> to

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
did they fix the problems that led to

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.630 
did they fix the problems that led to
this<00:01:37.079> labor<00:01:37.320> dispute<00:01:37.740> in<00:01:37.890> to<00:01:37.950> fix<00:01:38.130> what<00:01:38.610> I

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
this labor dispute in to fix what I

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.230 
this labor dispute in to fix what I
think<00:01:38.970> is<00:01:39.060> a<00:01:39.360> very<00:01:40.280> flawed<00:01:41.280> league<00:01:41.939> right<00:01:42.210> now

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
think is a very flawed league right now

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.120 
think is a very flawed league right now
because<00:01:43.049> you<00:01:43.229> only<00:01:43.380> have<00:01:43.560> a<00:01:43.590> couple<00:01:43.740> of<00:01:43.890> elite

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
because you only have a couple of elite

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.530 
because you only have a couple of elite
teams<00:01:44.399> and<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:44.670> teams<00:01:44.850> at<00:01:44.970> the<00:01:45.060> bottom<00:01:45.360> have

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
teams and the teams at the bottom have

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.990 
teams and the teams at the bottom have
no<00:01:45.689> chance<00:01:46.079> to<00:01:46.439> beat<00:01:46.770> those<00:01:47.009> guys<00:01:47.250> no<00:01:47.670> but<00:01:47.880> that

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
no chance to beat those guys no but that

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.670 
no chance to beat those guys no but that
was<00:01:48.149> that<00:01:48.509> was<00:01:48.659> at<00:01:48.840> least<00:01:49.049> as<00:01:49.290> true<00:01:49.500> with<00:01:49.530> the

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
was that was at least as true with the

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.310 
was that was at least as true with the
80s<00:01:50.130> as<00:01:50.280> it<00:01:50.399> is<00:01:50.520> now<00:01:50.729> was<00:01:51.329> it<00:01:51.360> just<00:01:51.689> oh<00:01:51.840> of

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
80s as it is now was it just oh of

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.469 
80s as it is now was it just oh of
course<00:01:52.350> yes<00:01:52.920> but<00:01:53.310> I<00:01:53.340> mean<00:01:53.640> but<00:01:53.670> those<00:01:54.180> teams

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
course yes but I mean but those teams

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.209 
course yes but I mean but those teams
were<00:01:54.630> just<00:01:54.869> you<00:01:55.229> you<00:01:55.439> couldn't<00:01:55.710> put<00:01:55.950> teams

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
were just you you couldn't put teams

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.700 
were just you you couldn't put teams
together<00:01:56.460> as<00:01:56.969> stacked<00:01:57.450> as<00:01:57.750> those<00:01:58.200> teams<00:01:58.500> were

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
together as stacked as those teams were

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:59.870 
together as stacked as those teams were
now<00:01:58.890> you<00:01:58.950> couldn't<00:01:59.369> do<00:01:59.460> I<00:01:59.490> you<00:01:59.700> could

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
now you couldn't do I you could

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.050 
now you couldn't do I you could
definitely<00:02:00.000> if<00:02:00.659> you<00:02:00.810> had<00:02:01.189> Moses<00:02:02.189> Andrew<00:02:02.759> doc

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
definitely if you had Moses Andrew doc

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.270 
definitely if you had Moses Andrew doc
mo<00:02:03.689> cheeks<00:02:03.990> Bobby<00:02:04.290> Jones<00:02:04.590> you<00:02:04.860> couldn't<00:02:05.130> pay

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
mo cheeks Bobby Jones you couldn't pay

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.289 
mo cheeks Bobby Jones you couldn't pay
him<00:02:05.399> all<00:02:05.490> right<00:02:05.640> now<00:02:05.759> you<00:02:05.939> couldn't<00:02:06.210> have

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
him all right now you couldn't have

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.320 
him all right now you couldn't have
that's<00:02:06.450> what<00:02:06.600> I'm<00:02:06.689> saying<00:02:06.930> I<00:02:07.280> think<00:02:08.280> and<00:02:08.879> that

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
that's what I'm saying I think and that

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.230 
that's what I'm saying I think and that
was

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:10.240 
was

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.120 
was
like<00:02:10.510> the<00:02:10.660> third<00:02:10.930> best<00:02:11.200> team<00:02:11.500> of<00:02:11.530> that<00:02:11.860> area

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
like the third best team of that area

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:15.420 
like the third best team of that area
correct<00:02:12.760> true<00:02:13.210> in<00:02:13.540> trouble<00:02:13.900> so<00:02:14.190> we<00:02:15.190> can<00:02:15.310> never

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
correct true in trouble so we can never

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:16.920 
correct true in trouble so we can never
get<00:02:15.610> back<00:02:15.640> to<00:02:15.940> what<00:02:16.090> that<00:02:16.210> to<00:02:16.570> that<00:02:16.660> year<00:02:16.900> I

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
get back to what that to that year I

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:18.660 
get back to what that to that year I
guess<00:02:17.230> I<00:02:17.260> mean<00:02:17.500> can't<00:02:17.860> we<00:02:17.890> ever<00:02:17.950> get<00:02:18.280> back<00:02:18.340> to

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
guess I mean can't we ever get back to

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.310 
guess I mean can't we ever get back to
you<00:02:18.880> have<00:02:19.060> that<00:02:19.300> kind<00:02:19.540> of<00:02:19.600> depth<00:02:19.900> and<00:02:20.140> talent

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:20.320 
you have that kind of depth and talent

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.050 
you have that kind of depth and talent
now<00:02:20.770> because<00:02:21.040> while<00:02:21.250> you<00:02:21.550> play<00:02:21.790> the<00:02:22.000> other

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
now because while you play the other

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.730 
now because while you play the other
part<00:02:22.360> of<00:02:22.420> it<00:02:22.510> is<00:02:22.570> now<00:02:22.810> the<00:02:22.870> league<00:02:23.080> is<00:02:23.200> expanded

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:23.740 
part of it is now the league is expanded

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:25.080 
part of it is now the league is expanded
since<00:02:23.860> then<00:02:24.040> I<00:02:24.100> forget<00:02:24.370> me<00:02:24.490> teaser<00:02:24.730> where<00:02:24.970> then

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
since then I forget me teaser where then

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.200 
since then I forget me teaser where then
it<00:02:25.180> was<00:02:25.480> 23<00:02:25.840> and<00:02:26.140> now<00:02:26.350> there's<00:02:26.590> 37<00:02:27.370> m<00:02:27.580> yeah<00:02:27.850> I

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:28.210 
it was 23 and now there's 37 m yeah I

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:30.390 
it was 23 and now there's 37 m yeah I
think<00:02:28.480> that<00:02:28.780> you<00:02:28.930> know<00:02:29.050> the<00:02:29.200> the<00:02:29.250> pool<00:02:30.250> has

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
think that you know the the pool has

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.220 
think that you know the the pool has
gotten<00:02:30.700> more<00:02:30.880> diluted<00:02:31.420> and<00:02:31.660> you<00:02:31.990> know<00:02:32.080> and

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
gotten more diluted and you know and

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:33.870 
gotten more diluted and you know and
then<00:02:32.320> it's<00:02:32.470> back<00:02:32.800> to<00:02:32.860> the<00:02:33.010> old<00:02:33.130> salary<00:02:33.430> cap<00:02:33.670> and

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
then it's back to the old salary cap and

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.640 
then it's back to the old salary cap and
you<00:02:33.910> just<00:02:34.090> can't<00:02:34.270> pay<00:02:34.450> everybody<00:02:34.720> you<00:02:34.960> so<00:02:35.200> did

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
you just can't pay everybody you so did

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:36.990 
you just can't pay everybody you so did
they<00:02:35.740> fix<00:02:35.950> a<00:02:36.130> the<00:02:36.280> problems<00:02:36.640> that<00:02:36.700> they<00:02:36.850> had

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
they fix a the problems that they had

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.490 
they fix a the problems that they had
before<00:02:37.150> or<00:02:37.630> is<00:02:37.690> this<00:02:37.780> going<00:02:37.990> to<00:02:38.080> just<00:02:38.260> be<00:02:38.380> the

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
before or is this going to just be the

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.470 
before or is this going to just be the
same<00:02:38.710> thing<00:02:38.950> we<00:02:39.070> saw<00:02:39.100> last<00:02:39.610> year<00:02:40.000> at<00:02:40.090> this<00:02:40.210> time

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
same thing we saw last year at this time

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.150 
same thing we saw last year at this time
as<00:02:40.780> far<00:02:40.990> as<00:02:41.080> the<00:02:41.170> quality<00:02:41.530> of<00:02:41.560> play<00:02:41.770> out<00:02:41.950> there

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
as far as the quality of play out there

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:43.950 
as far as the quality of play out there
I<00:02:42.370> think<00:02:42.940> it<00:02:43.000> would<00:02:43.090> be<00:02:43.120> quiet<00:02:43.360> pretty<00:02:43.840> much

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:43.960 
I think it would be quiet pretty much

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:45.330 
I think it would be quiet pretty much
the<00:02:44.140> same<00:02:44.320> I<00:02:44.500> think<00:02:44.890> it's<00:02:44.980> kind<00:02:45.100> of<00:02:45.190> the<00:02:45.310> same

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
the same I think it's kind of the same

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.250 
the same I think it's kind of the same
league<00:02:45.820> they<00:02:46.180> didn't<00:02:46.690> fit<00:02:46.840> they<00:02:46.960> didn't<00:02:47.170> fix

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
league they didn't fit they didn't fix

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:48.720 
league they didn't fit they didn't fix
the<00:02:47.380> problem<00:02:47.740> you<00:02:47.860> mean<00:02:48.130> the<00:02:48.280> main<00:02:48.430> thing<00:02:48.460> that

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
the problem you mean the main thing that

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.280 
the problem you mean the main thing that
they<00:02:49.000> main<00:02:49.240> thing<00:02:49.450> that<00:02:49.480> they<00:02:49.690> did<00:02:49.750> in<00:02:50.050> fact

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
they main thing that they did in fact

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.020 
they main thing that they did in fact
and<00:02:50.620> I'll<00:02:50.890> give<00:02:51.100> the<00:02:51.190> orders<00:02:51.460> of<00:02:51.490> teeny<00:02:51.820> bit<00:02:52.000> of

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
and I'll give the orders of teeny bit of

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.150 
and I'll give the orders of teeny bit of
credit<00:02:52.360> for<00:02:52.450> this<00:02:52.570> I<00:02:52.750> think<00:02:53.320> they<00:02:53.440> tried<00:02:53.740> to<00:02:54.010> I

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
credit for this I think they tried to I

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.410 
credit for this I think they tried to I
think<00:02:54.250> this<00:02:54.490> is<00:02:54.610> one<00:02:54.820> of<00:02:54.850> the<00:02:55.000> areas<00:02:55.120> where

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
think this is one of the areas where

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:57.480

and but but to the extent that even
thought<00:03:41.950> they<00:03:42.100> were<00:03:42.130> going<00:03:42.250> to<00:03:42.310> collectively

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700 
thought they were going to collectively

thought they were going to collectively
bargain<00:03:42.760> that<00:03:43.210> away<00:03:43.420> they<00:03:43.600> were<00:03:43.720> wrong<00:03:43.930> yeah

bargain that away they were wrong yeah
the<00:03:44.590> thing<00:03:45.100> it<00:03:45.250> drives<00:03:45.460> me<00:03:45.580> crazy<00:03:45.730> about<00:03:46.150> the

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:46.300 
the thing it drives me crazy about the

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:48.270 
the thing it drives me crazy about the
whole<00:03:46.330> lockout<00:03:46.870> thing<00:03:47.080> was<00:03:47.260> basically<00:03:47.740> the

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
whole lockout thing was basically the

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.160 
whole lockout thing was basically the
owners<00:03:48.580> were<00:03:48.610> asking<00:03:49.120> the<00:03:49.150> players<00:03:49.510> to<00:03:49.870> save

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:50.170 
owners were asking the players to save

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:52.260 
owners were asking the players to save
them<00:03:50.560> the<00:03:50.860> owners<00:03:51.190> from<00:03:51.460> themselves<00:03:51.700> yeah

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:52.270 
them the owners from themselves yeah

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:54.570 
them the owners from themselves yeah
that's<00:03:52.750> like<00:03:52.930> you<00:03:53.200> know<00:03:53.320> to<00:03:54.070> save<00:03:54.280> them<00:03:54.460> from

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:54.580 
that's like you know to save them from

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:57.000 
that's like you know to save them from
signing<00:03:55.060> somebody<00:03:55.780> to<00:03:55.900> a<00:03:55.960> long-term<00:03:56.170> silly

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.010 
signing somebody to a long-term silly

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:58.590 
signing somebody to a long-term silly
contract<00:03:57.580> I<00:03:57.640> can't<00:03:57.850> think<00:03:58.030> of<00:03:58.150> a<00:03:58.210> name<00:03:58.330> off<00:03:58.510> the

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:58.600 
contract I can't think of a name off the

00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:59.670 
contract I can't think of a name off the
top<00:03:58.660> of<00:03:58.810> my<00:03:58.930> head<00:03:58.990> but<00:03:59.200> I<00:03:59.320> know<00:03:59.380> there's

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
top of my head but I know there's

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.950 
top of my head but I know there's
there's<00:04:00.370> obvious<00:04:01.030> examples<00:04:01.510> out<00:04:01.630> there<00:04:01.690> but

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:01.960 
there's obvious examples out there but

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:04.260 
there's obvious examples out there but
it<00:04:01.990> just<00:04:02.260> seems<00:04:02.470> like<00:04:02.680> you<00:04:03.580> know<00:04:03.700> is<00:04:04.000> that

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:04.270 
it just seems like you know is that

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:06.060 
it just seems like you know is that
really<00:04:04.540> supposed<00:04:04.840> to<00:04:04.930> be<00:04:05.020> the<00:04:05.140> first<00:04:05.560> job<00:04:05.860> at

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:06.070 
really supposed to be the first job at

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:08.070 
really supposed to be the first job at
all<00:04:06.220> this<00:04:06.430> that's<00:04:07.090> right<00:04:07.330> but<00:04:07.870> in<00:04:07.959> the<00:04:08.050> other

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:08.080 
all this that's right but in the other

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:10.380 
all this that's right but in the other
hand<00:04:08.290> I<00:04:08.590> think<00:04:08.890> some<00:04:09.160> of<00:04:09.190> that<00:04:09.340> is<00:04:09.490> baked<00:04:10.060> into

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:10.390 
hand I think some of that is baked into

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:12.690 
hand I think some of that is baked into
the<00:04:10.600> reality<00:04:11.320> of<00:04:11.350> this<00:04:11.620> sport<00:04:12.070> because

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:12.700 
the reality of this sport because

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:14.820 
the reality of this sport because
because<00:04:13.180> I<00:04:13.390> mean<00:04:13.780> you've<00:04:14.290> got<00:04:14.470> the<00:04:14.650> money

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:14.830 
because I mean you've got the money

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:17.099 
because I mean you've got the money
you've<00:04:15.100> got<00:04:15.370> to<00:04:15.580> spend<00:04:15.910> it<00:04:16.120> everything

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:17.109 
you've got to spend it everything

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:18.749 
you've got to spend it everything

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:52.649 
to think that they're going to start off
better<00:04:51.729> I<00:04:51.879> mean<00:04:52.029> obviously<00:04:52.150> you're<00:04:52.449> going<00:04:52.599> to

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:55.270 
start off on the road because the ice

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:57.899 
start off on the road because the ice
show<00:04:55.539> that's<00:04:55.750> always<00:04:56.020> in<00:04:56.279> their<00:04:57.279> arena<00:04:57.580> this

00:04:57.899 --> 00:04:57.909 
show that's always in their arena this

00:04:57.909 --> 00:04:59.730

00:05:00.719 --> 00:05:00.729 
to start on the road so they'll have

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:02.040 
to start on the road so they'll have
that<00:05:00.909> going<00:05:01.150> against<00:05:01.330> it<00:05:01.419> but<00:05:01.509> I<00:05:01.569> gotta

and<00:05:56.919> today<00:05:57.129> I<00:05:57.159> would<00:05:57.699> agree<00:05:57.849> with<00:05:57.909> that<00:05:58.029> Eiffel

00:05:58.469 --> 00:05:58.479 
and today I would agree with that Eiffel

00:05:58.479 --> 00:05:59.879 
and today I would agree with that Eiffel
unless<00:05:58.960> they<00:05:59.110> can<00:05:59.259> make<00:05:59.620> big<00:05:59.830> changes

00:05:59.879 --> 00:05:59.889 
unless they can make big changes

00:05:59.889 --> 00:06:01.589 
unless they can make big changes
absolutely<00:06:00.819> agree<00:06:01.000> with<00:06:01.120> that<00:06:01.150> and<00:06:01.300> it's<00:06:01.449> hard

00:06:01.589 --> 00:06:01.599 
absolutely agree with that and it's hard

00:06:01.599 --> 00:06:02.879 
absolutely agree with that and it's hard
to<00:06:01.629> make<00:06:01.779> a<00:06:01.839> big<00:06:02.050> change<00:06:02.110> i<00:06:02.349> mean<00:06:02.469> the<00:06:02.560> name

00:06:04.649 --> 00:06:04.659 
that's out there that intrigues me which

00:06:04.659 --> 00:06:06.300 
that's out there that intrigues me which
i<00:06:04.810> don't<00:06:04.870> think<00:06:05.050> they<00:06:05.259> can<00:06:05.409> get<00:06:05.529> done<00:06:05.740> is<00:06:05.919> nanay

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:06.310

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:11.670 
know i doubt that he wants to play there
I<00:06:09.759> mean<00:06:10.120> you<00:06:10.419> hear<00:06:10.629> about<00:06:10.689> Miami<00:06:11.259> having

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:13.000 
interested in that or how they're going

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.059 
interested in that or how they're going

to fit him into their cap but I mean he

00:06:15.069 --> 00:06:16.409
