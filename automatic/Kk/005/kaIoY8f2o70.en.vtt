like everyday and i just think it could
have<00:02:55.920> more<00:02:56.160> product<00:02:56.550> on<00:02:56.730> it<00:02:56.850> that<00:02:56.970> would<00:02:57.030> be

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
have more product on it that would be

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.080 
have more product on it that would be
better<00:02:57.330> but<00:02:58.050> um<00:02:58.319> the<00:02:59.190> wand<00:02:59.430> is<00:02:59.610> really<00:02:59.940> nice

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090
