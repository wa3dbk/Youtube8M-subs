00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
to this team the ergonomics which is

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.090 
to this team the ergonomics which is
part<00:01:51.659> that<00:01:51.810> I<00:01:51.840> can<00:01:52.170> get<00:01:52.439> really<00:01:52.649> involved<00:01:52.890> in

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
part that I can get really involved in

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.010 
part that I can get really involved in
is<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:53.700> cockpit<00:01:54.060> so<00:01:54.270> the<00:01:54.540> seating<00:01:54.869> position

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
is the cockpit so the seating position

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.789 
is the cockpit so the seating position
the<00:01:55.860> pedals<00:01:56.189> so<00:01:56.549> when<00:01:57.540> I<00:01:57.570> arrive<00:01:57.869> here<00:01:58.229> for<00:01:58.649> me

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
the pedals so when I arrive here for me

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.440 
the pedals so when I arrive here for me
what<00:01:59.100> Michael<00:01:59.490> and<00:01:59.729> what<00:02:00.060> Nico<00:02:00.299> had

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
what Michael and what Nico had

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.800 
what Michael and what Nico had
previously<00:02:00.890> was<00:02:01.890> not<00:02:02.189> a<00:02:02.430> not<00:02:03.240> good<00:02:03.390> for<00:02:03.570> center

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
previously was not a not good for center

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.480 
previously was not a not good for center
of<00:02:03.869> gravity<00:02:04.170> all<00:02:04.290> those<00:02:04.439> kind<00:02:04.590> of<00:02:04.619> things<00:02:04.680> so

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
of gravity all those kind of things so

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.190 
of gravity all those kind of things so
when<00:02:05.909> I<00:02:05.939> moved<00:02:06.240> that<00:02:06.479> it<00:02:06.659> was<00:02:06.750> interesting

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
when I moved that it was interesting

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.100 
when I moved that it was interesting
because<00:02:07.229> Anika<00:02:07.710> followed<00:02:08.750> with<00:02:09.750> his<00:02:09.899> position

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
because Anika followed with his position

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.830

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
perfect every every year I don't know

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.160 
perfect every every year I don't know
I've<00:02:30.550> just<00:02:30.580> something<00:02:31.480> I<00:02:31.540> really<00:02:31.780> enjoy<00:02:31.960> doing

I've just something I really enjoy doing
and<00:02:32.710> with<00:02:33.310> the<00:02:33.370> steering<00:02:33.580> wheel<00:02:33.730> it's<00:02:34.090> about

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
and with the steering wheel it's about

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.450 
and with the steering wheel it's about
minimizing<00:02:34.960> and<00:02:35.320> simplicity<00:02:35.920> you<00:02:36.370> know

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:36.460 
minimizing and simplicity you know

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:37.890 
minimizing and simplicity you know
naturally<00:02:36.910> all<00:02:37.030> these<00:02:37.180> engineers<00:02:37.570> they<00:02:37.720> want

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
naturally all these engineers they want

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.050 
naturally all these engineers they want
to<00:02:37.960> give<00:02:38.050> you<00:02:38.340> there's<00:02:39.340> so<00:02:39.610> much<00:02:39.790> information

to give you there's so much information
and<00:02:40.600> what<00:02:41.170> I<00:02:41.200> had<00:02:41.470> my<00:02:41.710> job<00:02:41.950> is<00:02:42.100> to<00:02:42.220> say<00:02:42.400> you<00:02:42.970> know

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
and what I had my job is to say you know

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:44.910 
and what I had my job is to say you know
what<00:02:43.390> I<00:02:43.420> don't<00:02:43.750> need<00:02:43.960> that<00:02:44.140> I<00:02:44.320> don't<00:02:44.590> need<00:02:44.680> that

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
what I don't need that I don't need that

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.310 
what I don't need that I don't need that
I'll<00:02:45.580> try<00:02:45.820> that<00:02:46.030> one<00:02:46.240> and<00:02:46.510> then<00:02:46.840> I'll<00:02:46.959> test<00:02:47.170> it

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:47.320 
I'll try that one and then I'll test it

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:49.230 
I'll try that one and then I'll test it
and<00:02:47.440> decide<00:02:47.800> whether<00:02:47.950> I<00:02:48.040> need<00:02:48.190> it<00:02:48.310> and<00:02:48.820> then<00:02:49.120> I

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:49.240 
and decide whether I need it and then I

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.330 
and decide whether I need it and then I
decide<00:02:49.750> how<00:02:50.020> I<00:02:50.050> how<00:02:50.770> I<00:02:50.800> put<00:02:51.070> it<00:02:51.130> on<00:02:51.280> the

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
decide how I how I put it on the

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:52.980 
decide how I how I put it on the
steering<00:02:51.580> wheel<00:02:51.640> so<00:02:51.850> I<00:02:51.910> decide<00:02:52.180> where<00:02:52.390> I<00:02:52.600> have

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:52.990 
steering wheel so I decide where I have

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:54.540 
steering wheel so I decide where I have
to<00:02:53.080> decide<00:02:53.350> where<00:02:53.530> I<00:02:53.560> want<00:02:53.830> my<00:02:53.860> button<00:02:54.190> so<00:02:54.340> Niko

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550 
to decide where I want my button so Niko

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:56.130 
to decide where I want my button so Niko
has<00:02:54.670> his<00:02:54.790> buttons<00:02:55.060> in<00:02:55.120> a<00:02:55.450> different<00:02:55.720> order<00:02:55.930> and

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
has his buttons in a different order and

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.880 
has his buttons in a different order and
and<00:02:57.010> how<00:02:57.190> I<00:02:57.220> want<00:02:57.550> to<00:02:57.870> view<00:02:58.870> it<00:02:59.020> on<00:02:59.200> my<00:02:59.380> screen

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
Niko problem I guess and masa was

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.730 
Niko problem I guess and masa was
growing<00:03:06.940> was<00:03:07.390> coming<00:03:07.720> nearer<00:03:07.930> and<00:03:07.959> nearer<00:03:08.110> but

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:08.740 
growing was coming nearer and nearer but

Silverstone<00:04:31.060> it's<00:04:31.690> unreal<00:04:32.560> and<00:04:32.920> I<00:04:33.280> think<00:04:33.490> for

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.610 
Silverstone it's unreal and I think for

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:34.830 
Silverstone it's unreal and I think for
any<00:04:33.760> driver<00:04:33.940> going<00:04:34.240> hopefully<00:04:34.450> going<00:04:34.750> to

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:34.840 
any driver going hopefully going to

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.590 
any driver going hopefully going to
their<00:04:34.960> own<00:04:35.080> home<00:04:35.440> Grand<00:04:35.680> Prix<00:04:36.150> it's<00:04:37.150> unlike

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:37.600 
their own home Grand Prix it's unlike

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.030 
their own home Grand Prix it's unlike
any<00:04:37.780> other<00:04:37.930> gonna<00:04:38.080> forget<00:04:38.350> to<00:04:38.440> go<00:04:38.530> go<00:04:39.010> to

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:39.040 
any other gonna forget to go go to

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.190 
any other gonna forget to go go to
because<00:04:39.430> you<00:04:39.520> have<00:04:39.700> so<00:04:39.910> many<00:04:39.970> of<00:04:40.690> the<00:04:41.020> fans

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:41.200 
because you have so many of the fans

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:43.180 
there you know they wake up early they

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:44.670 
there you know they wake up early they
put<00:04:43.390> the<00:04:43.480> top<00:04:43.660> on<00:04:43.810> they<00:04:43.990> put<00:04:44.140> the<00:04:44.200> cap<00:04:44.380> on<00:04:44.530> they

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:44.680 
put the top on they put the cap on they

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.320 
put the top on they put the cap on they
got<00:04:44.770> the<00:04:44.860> flag<00:04:45.100> and<00:04:45.400> they're<00:04:45.670> there<00:04:45.880> that

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:46.330 
got the flag and they're there that

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:48.740 
got the flag and they're there that
energy<00:04:46.720> that<00:04:46.900> they're<00:04:47.020> sending<00:04:47.380> out<00:04:47.550> it<00:04:48.550> I

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:48.750 
energy that they're sending out it I

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:50.580 
energy that they're sending out it I
believe<00:04:49.750> it<00:04:49.900> makes<00:04:50.050> such<00:04:50.260> a<00:04:50.290> big<00:04:50.380> difference

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:50.590 
believe it makes such a big difference
