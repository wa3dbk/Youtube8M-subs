wing to be kind of small so what I'm

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.260 
wing to be kind of small so what I'm
going<00:04:28.200> to<00:04:28.320> do<00:04:28.560> is<00:04:29.220> just<00:04:29.280> pull<00:04:29.670> it<00:04:29.790> out<00:04:29.880> a<00:04:29.910> tiny

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
going to do is just pull it out a tiny

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:31.940 
going to do is just pull it out a tiny
away<00:04:30.690> trying<00:04:30.990> to<00:04:31.080> keep<00:04:31.170> it<00:04:31.320> as<00:04:31.440> symmetric<00:04:31.860> as

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:31.950 
away trying to keep it as symmetric as

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:33.140 
away trying to keep it as symmetric as
this<00:04:32.070> side<00:04:32.250> as<00:04:32.340> possible<00:04:32.700> because<00:04:32.790> it<00:04:32.940> doesn't

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:33.150 
this side as possible because it doesn't

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:35.350 
this side as possible because it doesn't
really<00:04:33.270> go<00:04:33.390> up<00:04:33.600> it<00:04:34.110> goes<00:04:34.350> just<00:04:34.680> like<00:04:34.740> a<00:04:34.980> cross

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.360 
really go up it goes just like a cross

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:43.140 
really go up it goes just like a cross
so<00:04:37.010> paying<00:04:38.010> attention<00:04:38.490> to<00:04:38.580> that

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:43.150 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:46.860 

just<00:04:43.990> going<00:04:44.200> to<00:04:44.350> map<00:04:44.800> it<00:04:44.830> out<00:04:45.390> well<00:04:46.390> not<00:04:46.540> map<00:04:46.750> it

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:46.870 
just going to map it out well not map it

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:53.610 
just going to map it out well not map it
out<00:04:46.960> draw<00:04:47.230> it<00:04:47.380> on<00:04:47.500> in<00:04:47.680> fact<00:04:50.550> and<00:04:52.440> the<00:04:53.440> trick

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:53.620 
out draw it on in fact and the trick

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:55.590 
out draw it on in fact and the trick
that<00:04:53.800> I<00:04:53.830> really<00:04:54.190> do<00:04:54.310> with<00:04:54.490> eyeliner<00:04:55.150> is<00:04:55.480> to

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:55.600 
that I really do with eyeliner is to

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.300 
that I really do with eyeliner is to
draw<00:04:55.810> it<00:04:55.990> smaller<00:04:56.380> than<00:04:56.590> you<00:04:56.710> need<00:04:56.920> and<00:04:57.100> make

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:57.310 
draw it smaller than you need and make

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:59.820 
draw it smaller than you need and make
it<00:04:57.490> bigger<00:04:57.700> as<00:04:57.940> opposed<00:04:58.300> to<00:04:58.420> like<00:04:59.290> drawing<00:04:59.650> on

00:04:59.820 --> 00:04:59.830 
it bigger as opposed to like drawing on

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:01.380 
it bigger as opposed to like drawing on
really<00:05:00.070> big<00:05:00.220> in<00:05:00.340> one<00:05:00.460> go<00:05:00.610> because<00:05:00.970> if<00:05:01.150> you<00:05:01.240> make

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:01.390 
really big in one go because if you make

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:02.910 
really big in one go because if you make
a<00:05:01.420> mistake<00:05:01.480> it's<00:05:01.930> so<00:05:02.110> much<00:05:02.260> harder<00:05:02.290> to<00:05:02.770> make

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:02.920 
a mistake it's so much harder to make

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:04.890 
a mistake it's so much harder to make
something<00:05:03.130> bigger<00:05:03.820> smaller<00:05:04.240> than<00:05:04.540> it<00:05:04.690> is<00:05:04.780> to

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:04.900 
something bigger smaller than it is to

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:06.930 
something bigger smaller than it is to
make<00:05:05.050> something<00:05:05.200> smaller<00:05:05.560> bigger<00:05:05.830> that<00:05:06.790> makes

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:06.940 
make something smaller bigger that makes

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:08.340 
make something smaller bigger that makes
sense<00:05:07.150> well<00:05:07.300> in<00:05:07.420> terms<00:05:07.540> of<00:05:07.690> eyeliner<00:05:08.020> it<00:05:08.230> is

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:08.350 
sense well in terms of eyeliner it is

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:19.890 
sense well in terms of eyeliner it is
anyway<00:05:15.060> and<00:05:17.820> also<00:05:18.820> I<00:05:18.970> want<00:05:19.300> to<00:05:19.330> line<00:05:19.600> the

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:19.900 
anyway and also I want to line the

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:24.090 
anyway and also I want to line the
waterline<00:05:20.320> with<00:05:20.350> the<00:05:20.620> same<00:05:20.890> product<00:05:22.590> so<00:05:23.590> just

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:24.100 
waterline with the same product so just

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:29.130 
waterline with the same product so just
put<00:05:24.310> it<00:05:24.400> straight<00:05:24.640> across<00:05:27.090> and<00:05:28.090> as<00:05:28.870> you<00:05:28.990> can

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:29.140 
put it straight across and as you can

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:30.600 
put it straight across and as you can
see<00:05:29.170> the<00:05:29.440> pink<00:05:29.620> has<00:05:29.800> kind<00:05:30.010> of<00:05:30.070> been<00:05:30.220> covered<00:05:30.550> up

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:30.610 
see the pink has kind of been covered up

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:32.190 
see the pink has kind of been covered up
by<00:05:30.670> the<00:05:30.790> black<00:05:31.060> a<00:05:31.090> little<00:05:31.450> too<00:05:31.570> much<00:05:31.840> so<00:05:32.110> I'm

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:32.200 
by the black a little too much so I'm

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:33.930 
by the black a little too much so I'm
just<00:05:32.290> going<00:05:32.410> to<00:05:32.470> go<00:05:32.590> back<00:05:32.620> in<00:05:32.980> and<00:05:33.190> add<00:05:33.670> more

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:33.940 
just going to go back in and add more

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:35.580 
just going to go back in and add more
dolly<00:05:34.150> pop<00:05:34.390> with<00:05:34.600> my<00:05:34.720> flat<00:05:34.990> head<00:05:35.140> brush<00:05:35.350> like

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:35.590 
dolly pop with my flat head brush like

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:40.110 
dolly pop with my flat head brush like
this<00:05:36.120> just<00:05:37.120> above<00:05:37.660> the<00:05:38.170> eye<00:05:38.680> liner<00:05:39.550> itself<00:05:39.910> it

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:40.120 
this just above the eye liner itself it

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:41.370 
this just above the eye liner itself it
doesn't<00:05:40.330> matter<00:05:40.450> if<00:05:40.570> it<00:05:40.660> kind<00:05:40.840> of<00:05:40.930> gets<00:05:41.050> onto

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:41.380 
doesn't matter if it kind of gets onto

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:42.420 
doesn't matter if it kind of gets onto
it<00:05:41.500> a<00:05:41.530> little<00:05:41.650> bit<00:05:41.860> because<00:05:41.950> we<00:05:42.100> can<00:05:42.250> just

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:42.430 
it a little bit because we can just

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:45.210 
it a little bit because we can just
retouch<00:05:42.940> that<00:05:43.180> up<00:05:43.560> so<00:05:44.560> I'm<00:05:44.680> just<00:05:44.830> gently

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:45.220 
retouch that up so I'm just gently

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:51.890 
retouch that up so I'm just gently
pressing<00:05:45.880> it<00:05:45.970> on

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:51.900 

00:05:51.900 --> 00:06:01.710 

like<00:05:52.500> so

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:01.720 

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:03.780 

I'm<00:06:02.410> going<00:06:02.560> to<00:06:02.620> blend<00:06:02.830> that<00:06:03.010> pink<00:06:03.340> line<00:06:03.550> out<00:06:03.760> a

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:03.790 
I'm going to blend that pink line out a

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:05.490 
I'm going to blend that pink line out a
little<00:06:03.970> bit<00:06:04.120> as<00:06:04.270> well<00:06:04.450> and<00:06:04.690> just<00:06:05.290> give<00:06:05.410> the

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:05.500 
little bit as well and just give the

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:07.230 
little bit as well and just give the
black<00:06:05.680> liner<00:06:05.950> a<00:06:06.160> quick<00:06:06.370> run<00:06:06.670> over<00:06:06.940> as<00:06:07.060> well

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:07.240 
black liner a quick run over as well

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:13.730 
black liner a quick run over as well
again<00:06:07.540> just<00:06:07.840> to<00:06:07.900> make<00:06:07.960> sure<00:06:08.140> it<00:06:08.380> is<00:06:08.470> jet<00:06:08.830> black

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:13.740 

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:16.230 

now<00:06:14.740> it's<00:06:14.890> time<00:06:15.010> to<00:06:15.160> add<00:06:15.280> mascara<00:06:15.580> sore<00:06:15.940> I<00:06:15.970> will

be<00:06:16.360> back<00:06:16.510> after<00:06:16.750> that<00:06:18.120> so<00:06:19.120> this<00:06:19.300> is<00:06:19.330> the<00:06:19.450> look

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:19.630 
be back after that so this is the look

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:22.530 
be back after that so this is the look
with<00:06:19.810> mascara<00:06:20.110> on<00:06:20.880> I've<00:06:21.880> added<00:06:22.090> it<00:06:22.330> to<00:06:22.360> the

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:22.540 
with mascara on I've added it to the

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:25.200 
with mascara on I've added it to the
bottom<00:06:22.660> lashes<00:06:22.990> as<00:06:23.260> well<00:06:23.730> and<00:06:24.730> what<00:06:24.910> I'm<00:06:25.000> going

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:25.210 
bottom lashes as well and what I'm going

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:27.600 
bottom lashes as well and what I'm going
to<00:06:25.270> do<00:06:25.420> is<00:06:25.600> just<00:06:25.630> add<00:06:25.930> these<00:06:26.170> false<00:06:26.500> lashes<00:06:26.710> to

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:27.610 
to do is just add these false lashes to

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:32.310 
to do is just add these false lashes to
the<00:06:27.700> edge<00:06:27.880> of<00:06:28.240> the<00:06:28.330> top<00:06:29.130> lashes<00:06:30.210> there<00:06:31.320> and

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:32.320 
the edge of the top lashes there and

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:37.020 
the edge of the top lashes there and
I'll<00:06:32.410> be<00:06:32.560> back<00:06:32.710> once<00:06:32.950> that's<00:06:33.130> done<00:06:35.820> so<00:06:36.820> this<00:06:37.000> is

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:37.030 
I'll be back once that's done so this is

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:39.480 
I'll be back once that's done so this is
with<00:06:37.300> the<00:06:37.420> lashes<00:06:37.780> on<00:06:37.930> I<00:06:38.220> think<00:06:39.220> it's<00:06:39.310> very

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:39.490 
with the lashes on I think it's very

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:42.210 
with the lashes on I think it's very
pretty<00:06:39.670> and<00:06:39.850> quite<00:06:40.180> subtle<00:06:40.420> actually<00:06:40.900> and<00:06:41.220> I'm

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:42.220 
pretty and quite subtle actually and I'm

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:44.760 
pretty and quite subtle actually and I'm
also<00:06:42.430> just<00:06:42.580> going<00:06:42.940> to<00:06:43.030> take<00:06:43.210> a<00:06:43.450> tiny<00:06:43.840> bit<00:06:44.530> of

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:44.770 
also just going to take a tiny bit of

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:48.840
