00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
we're just going to load up my youtube

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.640 
we're just going to load up my youtube
channel<00:01:49.410> and<00:01:49.770> see<00:01:49.860> how<00:01:49.980> it<00:01:50.100> looks<00:01:51.470> but<00:01:52.470> there's

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:52.650 
channel and see how it looks but there's

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:57.440 
channel and see how it looks but there's
one<00:01:52.800> downside<00:01:53.460> to<00:01:55.280> this<00:01:56.280> web<00:01:56.550> browser<00:01:56.820> is<00:01:57.150> that

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
one downside to this web browser is that

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.720 
one downside to this web browser is that
it<00:01:57.570> doesn't<00:01:58.010> have<00:01:59.010> full<00:01:59.310> flash<00:01:59.610> 10.1<00:02:00.180> support

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:01.730 
it doesn't have full flash 10.1 support

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:04.520 
it doesn't have full flash 10.1 support
so<00:02:02.730> if<00:02:02.790> you<00:02:02.910> want<00:02:03.030> a<00:02:03.120> view<00:02:03.300> for<00:02:03.780> example<00:02:03.900> flash

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
so if you want a view for example flash

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.550 
so if you want a view for example flash
videos<00:02:04.920> you<00:02:05.160> won't<00:02:05.340> be<00:02:05.490> able<00:02:05.610> to<00:02:06.380> which<00:02:07.380> is

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
videos you won't be able to which is

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.200 
videos you won't be able to which is
quite<00:02:08.130> disappointing<00:02:10.760> it's<00:02:11.760> going<00:02:11.910> to<00:02:11.940> take<00:02:12.180> a

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:12.210 
quite disappointing it's going to take a

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:15.410 
quite disappointing it's going to take a
look<00:02:12.360> at<00:02:12.540> that<00:02:13.130> my<00:02:14.130> is<00:02:14.190> still<00:02:14.790> in<00:02:14.910> beta<00:02:14.940> and
