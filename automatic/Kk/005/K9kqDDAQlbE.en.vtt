00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
pulling off a good rush the first one is

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.550 
pulling off a good rush the first one is
you<00:01:15.000> got<00:01:15.119> to<00:01:15.240> communicate<00:01:15.390> and<00:01:16.049> you<00:01:16.290> got<00:01:16.439> to

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
you got to communicate and you got to

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:17.300 
you got to communicate and you got to
coordinate

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
coordinate

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.230 
coordinate
now<00:01:18.210> basically<00:01:19.310> rushing<00:01:20.310> is<00:01:20.430> a<00:01:20.640> pretty<00:01:20.909> hard

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
now basically rushing is a pretty hard

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.450 
now basically rushing is a pretty hard
maneuver<00:01:21.689> to<00:01:21.780> pull<00:01:21.990> off<00:01:22.200> in<00:01:22.500> pub<00:01:23.220> games

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
maneuver to pull off in pub games

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:24.530 
maneuver to pull off in pub games
because<00:01:23.880> there's<00:01:24.090> not<00:01:24.240> too<00:01:24.420> much

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
because there's not too much

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.990 
because there's not too much
communication<00:01:25.200> at<00:01:25.290> goal<00:01:25.470> that<00:01:25.770> goes<00:01:26.009> on<00:01:26.250> not

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
communication at goal that goes on not

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.840 
communication at goal that goes on not
too<00:01:27.090> many<00:01:27.210> people<00:01:27.360> are<00:01:27.509> on<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:27.659> same<00:01:27.810> page<00:01:28.850> so

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
too many people are on the same page so

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.880 
too many people are on the same page so
it's<00:01:30.090> it's<00:01:30.360> a<00:01:30.540> better<00:01:30.780> maneuver<00:01:31.409> to<00:01:31.530> pull<00:01:31.740> off

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
it's it's a better maneuver to pull off

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.330 
it's it's a better maneuver to pull off
in<00:01:32.189> a<00:01:32.579> clan<00:01:32.850> war<00:01:33.090> or<00:01:33.810> would<00:01:34.200> just<00:01:34.350> maybe<00:01:34.920> even<00:01:35.280> a

concentrate their fire and basically

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.420 
concentrate their fire and basically
it's<00:03:29.389> over<00:03:29.750> at<00:03:29.870> this<00:03:30.019> point

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.750 

you<00:03:33.060> know<00:03:33.379> you<00:03:34.379> can<00:03:34.560> see<00:03:34.829> that<00:03:34.859> we're<00:03:35.370> sort<00:03:35.640> of

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
you know you can see that we're sort of

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.429 
you know you can see that we're sort of
getting<00:03:36.000> swamped<00:03:36.510> in<00:03:36.629> the<00:03:36.750> middle<00:03:37.049> here<00:03:37.409> and

00:03:37.429 --> 00:03:37.439 
getting swamped in the middle here and

00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:38.990 
getting swamped in the middle here and
then<00:03:37.739> there's<00:03:37.980> obviously<00:03:38.489> in<00:03:38.609> itself<00:03:38.849> you

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
then there's obviously in itself you

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.119 
then there's obviously in itself you
don't<00:03:39.180> have<00:03:39.269> anybody<00:03:39.719> there<00:03:39.989> but<00:03:40.950> that

don't have anybody there but that

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:43.030 
don't have anybody there but that
doesn't<00:03:41.519> matter<00:03:41.609> anymore<00:03:41.939> at<00:03:42.150> this<00:03:42.299> point

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 
doesn't matter anymore at this point

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.679 
doesn't matter anymore at this point
we've<00:03:44.040> completely<00:03:44.909> destroyed<00:03:45.450> their

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
northern wing and it's just a matter of

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:50.059 
northern wing and it's just a matter of
time<00:03:47.909> before<00:03:47.939> we<00:03:48.359> catch<00:03:48.540> up<00:03:48.799> behind<00:03:49.799> these

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:50.069 
time before we catch up behind these

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:52.220 
time before we catch up behind these
guys<00:03:50.340> and<00:03:50.730> then<00:03:50.939> just<00:03:51.180> start<00:03:51.719> shooting<00:03:51.959> them

you<00:03:53.969> see<00:03:54.150> I'm<00:03:54.299> down<00:03:54.450> to<00:03:54.569> 34<00:03:55.019> percent<00:03:55.049> it

00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:55.799 
you see I'm down to 34 percent it

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:57.559 
you see I'm down to 34 percent it
doesn't<00:03:56.129> matter<00:03:56.310> if<00:03:56.639> need<00:03:56.909> be<00:03:56.939> I<00:03:57.120> just<00:03:57.239> throw

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:54.100 

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:57.000 

so<00:05:54.730> again<00:05:55.210> anybody<00:05:55.870> else<00:05:56.110> as<00:05:56.350> you<00:05:56.590> can<00:05:56.740> see<00:05:56.890> we

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:57.010 
so again anybody else as you can see we

00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:59.670 
so again anybody else as you can see we
also<00:05:57.160> have<00:05:57.280> one<00:05:57.520> guy<00:05:57.700> cap<00:05:58.000> that<00:05:58.390> was<00:05:58.510> also<00:05:58.900> not

00:05:59.670 --> 00:05:59.680 
also have one guy cap that was also not

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:00.480 
also have one guy cap that was also not
a<00:05:59.710> bad<00:05:59.920> idea

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:00.490 
a bad idea

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:06.090 
a bad idea
I'm<00:06:01.270> typically<00:06:02.080> against<00:06:02.590> capping<00:06:03.100> when<00:06:05.100> when

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:06.100 
I'm typically against capping when when

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:07.950 
I'm typically against capping when when
there's<00:06:06.250> such<00:06:06.730> overwhelming<00:06:07.090> numbers<00:06:07.810> like

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:07.960 
there's such overwhelming numbers like

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:10.800 
there's such overwhelming numbers like
this<00:06:08.140> because<00:06:08.590> you<00:06:08.710> spread<00:06:09.100> out<00:06:09.130> the<00:06:09.660> XP<00:06:10.660> for

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:10.810 
this because you spread out the XP for

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:14.640 
this because you spread out the XP for
everybody<00:06:11.640> but<00:06:12.640> it<00:06:13.270> is<00:06:13.390> what<00:06:13.600> it<00:06:13.720> is<00:06:14.050> see<00:06:14.470> if<00:06:14.530> I

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:14.650 
everybody but it is what it is see if I

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:16.890 
everybody but it is what it is see if I
can't<00:06:14.950> get<00:06:15.610> one<00:06:15.850> last<00:06:16.060> kill<00:06:16.420> here<00:06:16.600> at<00:06:16.660> the<00:06:16.780> end

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:16.900 
can't get one last kill here at the end

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:18.390 
can't get one last kill here at the end
of<00:06:16.960> the<00:06:17.020> game<00:06:17.290> and<00:06:17.770> there<00:06:17.980> it<00:06:18.100> is

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:18.400 
of the game and there it is

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:21.420 
of the game and there it is
what<00:06:18.930> so<00:06:19.930> with<00:06:20.260> that<00:06:20.500> guys<00:06:20.830> that's<00:06:21.220> been

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:21.430
