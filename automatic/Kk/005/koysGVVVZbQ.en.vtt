 my chicks and my chickens and we 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.869
 we found in a new series called a 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:23.210
 all against all or for the bedroom 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:24.890
 remember that you can support very much the 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.480
 start of this series leaving mint 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.999
 up because remember that cavani is 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.710
 up is your position and a neighbor who 

00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:33.590

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.480
 helps a lot and good if it comes and

 best but good there is a way 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.940
 of game quite entertaining but to the 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:50.410
 time a bit exasperating because good 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:53.769
 because sometimes it fails that it kills you 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:53.769

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:31.690
 very epic good epic good not 

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:33.880
 but pretty much better and this game 

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:36.220
 it has served much better not because 

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:37.990
 so to say neither boys and girls I hope 

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:39.700

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:42.070

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:45.820
 as I said remember a goal up 

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:47.380
 it costs nothing and it helps a lot and if 

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:49.120
 good and if what you really like you 

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:50.590

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:54.090
 Throw goodbye to everyone if you want 

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:54.090
