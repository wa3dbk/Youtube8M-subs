 a revamped Castres team ten 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.789
 changes in relation to the team 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:20.039
 beaten 1 northampton the wind is violent 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.939
 at the pierre-antoine stadium against castres 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.699
 in the first period 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:27.439
 more reason to play 9th hand 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.439
 minute the seo launches 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:33.859
 it's going to open up for the international 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.859
 scottish china 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.290
 quietly progress in this 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:43.870
 part of it is that they pay the 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:45.670
 sequestered rémi lamerat can savor 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.620
 this test its first since more than 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:50.590
 two years after two serious injuries to 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:53.170
 knees a collective essay that starts from a 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:53.920
 two against two well negotiate max evans 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.840
 escapes 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.120
 he avoids the touch of a superb 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:00.100
 chistera following it is the pillar of 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.199
 the team of France yannick forester who 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.340
 reminded him 

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:04.570
 I am other lines because they 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:06.820
 go there he even called that that's 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:08.200
 like that it was then I had some 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.610
 intervals and would lose I see remy 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.710
 also that support the pen on the side 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.240
 so here I am offered myself and I 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:13.680
 wanted the ball on the left and not on the 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.700
 same foot 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.750
 i think if philippe saint-andré 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.520
 in the match and maybe goes 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:20.350
 oppositional for the tournament because 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.899
 course according to the account line as 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:26.649
 handsome gift castres partners leads 

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:28.330
 then 5 0 wide winner 41-10 is at 

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:30.820
 first leg the Irish gets a 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:32.619
 fault castraise to react penalty 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:37.450
 converted by international striker 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:38.799
 South African juan pinard 5 to 3 castro 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:42.070
 if they own a South African scorer 

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:44.229
 rory kockott after 20 minutes the seo 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.760
 leads 8-3 on his turf 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:48.040
 gentlemen hat then say themselves the 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.460
 missing rodrigo capo ortega and ibrahim 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.920
 diarra 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:53.830
 but beware the disappointing ulster in 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.830
 the game dominates in melee the castrais are 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:58.210
 suspected of thrusting across 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.710
 it was kyoto's one to compare the 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.600
 field a little a bit serious did 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:03.310
 fly has it so it's complicated to 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.110
 butcher support them at least what 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.940
 on the pavement but retirees are going 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.619
 mingle with jean ley hair 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:10.510
 a big pack and was a lot 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:12.520
 involved on the ognon and nine penalties 

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:14.620
 against castres in the first half not 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:17.310
 only melee well on the ulster in 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:19.810
 take the opportunity to return to 8 to 6 at the break 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:22.080
 upon resumption castrais the re puts 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.700
 volume and go out to sea 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.320
 but it does not pass the door anymore 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.760
 closes on winger english marcel 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:33.250
 Garvey castres dominates but does not mark 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.810
 really the place to win so n 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.010
 did not miss much a little bit of 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:38.170
 German mastery important near the 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.910
 cities especially and it's a bit of a pity 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.740
 the last quarter of an hour approaches 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:44.500
 Irish are getting closer out of play 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:45.070
 reported by nigel owens for the first 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.430
 match times 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:50.050
 the ulster takes the advantage 9 to 8 the 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.580
 danger remains within 22 meters castrais 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:53.770
 breakthrough paddy jackson but 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:56.560
 interception of marc andreu that releases 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:59.460
 the dock Irish three-quarters 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.460
 the first on the ball 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.300
 but he procrastinates and finds himself under 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.840
 trimble and plated by thierry 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.849
 a cramp 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.010
 the balloon is then recovered by 

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:11.769
 pedrie wannenburg the old african south 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:13.750
 Player of the ulster cre departs 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:15.940
 quickly but off there is only 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:18.340
 forwards the Irish defense gets 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:20.890
 replace castrate will eventually lose 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.959
 the balloon with an in-front lazard the 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:24.819
 score does not move anymore neutered beat a 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:26.680
 point 9 to 8 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:28.510
 it's the fourth setback in a row for 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:33.519
 the castrated eliminated from any competition 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:34.569
 Europe is a little bitter in 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:36.310
 grins many changes he has 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:37.989
 done too and on over and the lack 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:39.430
 a little competition of some have that 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:40.540
 felt on the woman physically 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:42.120
 especially where we had the possibility 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.890
 in which to win the match 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.989
 well here are the all the elements we do not 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:51.160
 did not want us to lead the 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:52.390
 match and that's a competition on it 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:55.120
 knows orchestrated by the Irish and 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:57.459
 pleasure to lead in this case 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.290
 the Irish of the ulster winner for 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:01.620
 the first time in their history on the 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:01.620
