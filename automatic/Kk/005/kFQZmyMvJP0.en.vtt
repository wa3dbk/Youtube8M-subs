piece into the ground and then this

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.490 
piece into the ground and then this
piece<00:00:21.210> is<00:00:21.330> going<00:00:21.449> to<00:00:21.510> lock<00:00:21.779> on<00:00:21.990> to<00:00:22.260> it<00:00:22.320> like

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:44.580 
tree to the trap and found the right

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:46.700 
tree to the trap and found the right
point<00:00:44.850> on<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.120> string<00:00:45.360> to<00:00:45.570> tie<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:45.810> top<00:00:46.260> stick

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
point on the string to tie the top stick

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.680 
point on the string to tie the top stick
which<00:00:47.430> will<00:00:47.610> connect<00:00:47.910> to<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.120> trap<00:00:48.390> and

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
which will connect to the trap and

00:00:48.690 --> 00:01:02.220 
which will connect to the trap and
complete<00:00:49.230> your<00:00:49.260> triggering<00:00:49.710> system

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:02.230 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:04.110 

okay<00:01:02.800> now<00:01:03.190> I've<00:01:03.250> got<00:01:03.430> the<00:01:03.550> other<00:01:03.700> sticks<00:01:03.940> in<00:01:04.059> my

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:04.120 
okay now I've got the other sticks in my

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:07.560 
okay now I've got the other sticks in my
trap<00:01:04.390> tied<00:01:05.230> to<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:06.640> string<00:01:07.030> that<00:01:07.210> goes<00:01:07.270> on<00:01:07.540> a

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:07.570 
trap tied to the string that goes on a

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:10.350 
trap tied to the string that goes on a
tree<00:01:07.960> no<00:01:08.560> it's<00:01:08.890> left<00:01:09.130> to<00:01:09.460> make<00:01:09.760> the<00:01:09.910> noose<00:01:10.120> and

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:10.360 
tree no it's left to make the noose and

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:34.850 
tree no it's left to make the noose and
set<00:01:10.750> the<00:01:10.900> trap

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.630 

now<00:01:35.640> I<00:01:35.670> make<00:01:35.850> a<00:01:35.880> noose<00:01:37.040> figure<00:01:38.040> out<00:01:38.130> how<00:01:38.250> big<00:01:38.490> I

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
now I make a noose figure out how big I

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:51.110 
now I make a noose figure out how big I
want<00:01:38.790> this<00:01:39.830> piece<00:01:40.830> to<00:01:40.860> be

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:51.120 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:02:00.789 

okay

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:08.980 
okay
I<00:02:02.909> take<00:02:03.690> this

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:08.990 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:11.030 

okay<00:02:09.990> the<00:02:10.140> way<00:02:10.290> this<00:02:10.470> is<00:02:10.649> looking<00:02:10.950> I'm

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:11.040 
okay the way this is looking I'm

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:12.650 
okay the way this is looking I'm
probably<00:02:11.280> have<00:02:11.520> to<00:02:11.640> shorten<00:02:11.940> down<00:02:12.090> the<00:02:12.300> string

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
probably have to shorten down the string

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:18.940 
probably have to shorten down the string
some

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950
