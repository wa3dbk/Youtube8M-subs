00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:22.790 
here so this is saving a setting in riff

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:26.770 
here so this is saving a setting in riff
master<00:04:23.120> pro<00:04:24.010> so<00:04:25.010> this<00:04:25.190> will<00:04:25.340> save<00:04:25.699> the<00:04:26.240> setting

that<00:04:26.810> you<00:04:27.229> create<00:04:27.620> in<00:04:27.889> with<00:04:28.100> master<00:04:28.490> pro<00:04:28.790> in

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:29.750 
that you create in with master pro in

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:32.710 
that you create in with master pro in
the<00:04:30.199> media<00:04:30.650> library<00:04:30.940> so<00:04:31.940> first<00:04:32.270> of<00:04:32.419> all<00:04:32.510> we've

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:32.720 
the media library so first of all we've

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:36.210 
the media library so first of all we've
got<00:04:32.900> our<00:04:33.020> track<00:04:33.320> here<00:04:33.620> that<00:04:33.740> we're<00:04:33.860> playing

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:36.220 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:42.580 

we're<00:04:37.220> playing<00:04:37.490> there<00:04:39.970> so<00:04:41.260> we<00:04:42.260> would<00:04:42.410> then

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:42.590 
we're playing there so we would then

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:48.629 
we're playing there so we would then
create<00:04:42.740> a<00:04:42.919> loop<00:04:43.720> here<00:04:44.720> just<00:04:45.020> over<00:04:45.289> this<00:04:45.440> little

00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:48.639 

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:51.279 

the<00:04:49.639> way<00:04:49.789> we're<00:04:49.940> working<00:04:50.090> on<00:04:50.479> this<00:04:51.080> little

00:04:51.279 --> 00:04:51.289 
the way we're working on this little

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:52.629 
the way we're working on this little
loop<00:04:51.560> and<00:04:51.770> we<00:04:51.830> might<00:04:51.949> want<00:04:52.130> to<00:04:52.220> slow<00:04:52.310> that<00:04:52.580> down

00:04:52.629 --> 00:04:52.639 
loop and we might want to slow that down

00:04:52.639 --> 00:05:02.680 
loop and we might want to slow that down
so

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:02.690 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:05.570 

so<00:05:03.690> we've<00:05:03.840> got<00:05:04.050> that<00:05:04.080> and<00:05:04.620> then<00:05:04.680> if<00:05:05.130> we<00:05:05.340> want<00:05:05.520> to

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:05.580 
so we've got that and then if we want to

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:06.980 
so we've got that and then if we want to
come<00:05:05.790> back<00:05:05.940> tomorrow<00:05:06.090> and<00:05:06.390> work<00:05:06.600> on<00:05:06.810> that<00:05:06.960> a

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:06.990 
come back tomorrow and work on that a

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:10.370 
come back tomorrow and work on that a
bit<00:05:07.050> further<00:05:07.530> we<00:05:07.830> can<00:05:07.860> just<00:05:08.870> go<00:05:09.870> up<00:05:09.900> to<00:05:10.050> here

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:10.380 
bit further we can just go up to here

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:12.950 
bit further we can just go up to here

and that will save the changes so every

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:17.420 
and that will save the changes so every
time<00:05:15.240> we<00:05:15.450> come<00:05:15.570> back<00:05:15.750> to<00:05:15.900> that<00:05:15.960> song<00:05:16.350> from<00:05:17.160> then

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:17.430 
time we come back to that song from then

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:20.490 
on it will bring us up to this change

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:22.190 
on it will bring us up to this change
and<00:05:20.790> if<00:05:20.880> you<00:05:20.970> want<00:05:21.090> to<00:05:21.180> get<00:05:21.240> rid<00:05:21.390> of<00:05:21.450> that<00:05:21.540> those

and if you want to get rid of that those

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:23.750 
and if you want to get rid of that those
changes<00:05:22.650> you<00:05:22.770> can<00:05:22.950> also<00:05:23.160> you<00:05:23.370> can<00:05:23.580> just

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:23.760 
changes you can also you can just

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:28.220 
changes you can also you can just
completely<00:05:24.150> take<00:05:24.900> it<00:05:25.050> back<00:05:25.290> to<00:05:26.690> speed<00:05:27.690> at<00:05:27.960> one

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:28.230 
completely take it back to speed at one

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:30.950 
completely take it back to speed at one
hundred<00:05:28.320> percent<00:05:28.530> and<00:05:29.130> then<00:05:29.520> reset<00:05:30.300> the<00:05:30.720> loop

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:30.960 
hundred percent and then reset the loop

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:32.960 
hundred percent and then reset the loop
so<00:05:31.320> that<00:05:31.350> there<00:05:31.680> is<00:05:31.800> no<00:05:31.980> loops<00:05:32.220> and<00:05:32.520> then<00:05:32.700> just

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:32.970 
so that there is no loops and then just

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:35.840 
so that there is no loops and then just
again<00:05:33.540> save<00:05:34.230> the<00:05:34.410> changes<00:05:34.800> so<00:05:35.040> that<00:05:35.070> then<00:05:35.730> it

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:35.850 
again save the changes so that then it

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:38.840 
again save the changes so that then it
will<00:05:36.000> be<00:05:36.120> back<00:05:36.330> to<00:05:36.540> normal<00:05:37.490> whenever<00:05:38.490> you<00:05:38.610> open
