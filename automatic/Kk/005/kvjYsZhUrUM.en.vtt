easier to go like this as you see here

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.560 
easier to go like this as you see here
also<00:01:05.309> in<00:01:05.400> terms<00:01:05.670> of<00:01:06.409> performance<00:01:08.210> as<00:01:09.210> it

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
also in terms of performance as it

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:15.770 
also in terms of performance as it
slowed<00:01:10.020> down<00:01:10.229> that<00:01:10.260> much<00:01:10.770> control<00:01:11.490> I<00:01:14.420> mean<00:01:15.420> the

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
slowed down that much control I mean the

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.390 
slowed down that much control I mean the
big<00:01:15.960> thing<00:01:15.990> here<00:01:16.500> is<00:01:16.619> definitely<00:01:16.979> not<00:01:17.159> going

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
big thing here is definitely not going

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.620 
big thing here is definitely not going
to<00:01:17.490> be<00:01:17.640> it's<00:01:17.880> not<00:01:17.909> going<00:01:18.090> to<00:01:18.299> be<00:01:18.360> a<00:01:18.390> big

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
to be it's not going to be a big

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:19.999 
to be it's not going to be a big
performance<00:01:18.840> difference<00:01:19.530> between<00:01:19.860> the

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
performance difference between the

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.640 
performance difference between the
iPhone<00:01:20.630> or<00:01:21.630> it<00:01:21.750> could<00:01:21.900> be<00:01:22.080> a<00:01:22.110> big<00:01:22.320> difference

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
iPhone or it could be a big difference

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:28.700 
iPhone or it could be a big difference
between<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:23.130> iPhone<00:01:23.250> 5s<00:01:24.180> and<00:01:26.689> and<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:28.409> iPhone

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
between the iPhone 5s and and the iPhone

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.560 
between the iPhone 5s and and the iPhone
5<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:28.979> kids<00:01:29.310> t5<00:01:29.700> only<00:01:30.090> has<00:01:30.270> half<00:01:30.540> the

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
5 the kids t5 only has half the

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:36.290 
5 the kids t5 only has half the
performance

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:36.300 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:50.190 

let's<00:01:37.300> just<00:01:37.510> go<00:01:38.140> here<00:01:38.530> desktop<00:01:39.130> version<00:01:49.200> the

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200 
let's just go here desktop version the

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.110 
let's just go here desktop version the
Google<00:01:50.560> 2-step<00:01:51.100> verification<00:01:51.130> also<00:01:51.970> was<00:01:52.090> a

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:52.120 
Google 2-step verification also was a

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:56.850 
Google 2-step verification also was a
thing<00:01:52.420> inside<00:01:52.810> of<00:01:52.870> iOS<00:01:53.230> 8.3<00:01:55.650> again<00:01:56.650> I<00:01:56.680> think

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:56.860 
thing inside of iOS 8.3 again I think

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.880 
thing inside of iOS 8.3 again I think
the<00:01:57.190> Apple<00:01:57.490> needs<00:01:57.640> to<00:01:57.880> work<00:01:58.180> on<00:01:58.510> bringing<00:01:59.410> like

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 
the Apple needs to work on bringing like

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:05.340 
the Apple needs to work on bringing like
more<00:02:01.140> cool<00:02:02.140> things<00:02:02.500> to<00:02:03.040> iOS<00:02:03.430> and<00:02:04.170> they<00:02:05.170> still

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.350 
more cool things to iOS and they still

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:07.770 
more cool things to iOS and they still
haven't<00:02:05.530> released<00:02:05.830> I<00:02:06.010> was<00:02:06.160> 8.2<00:02:06.880> fully<00:02:07.210> public

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
haven't released I was 8.2 fully public

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.450 
haven't released I was 8.2 fully public
but<00:02:08.740> they<00:02:08.860> probably<00:02:09.100> will<00:02:09.580> do<00:02:10.090> that<00:02:10.300> soon

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:11.460 
but they probably will do that soon

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:19.320 
but they probably will do that soon
you<00:02:12.460> like<00:02:12.700> March<00:02:13.060> or<00:02:13.330> so<00:02:17.790> let's<00:02:18.790> just<00:02:18.970> want<00:02:19.210> a

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
you like March or so let's just want a

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.740 
you like March or so let's just want a
quick<00:02:19.510> your<00:02:19.720> test<00:02:19.990> here<00:02:21.180> the<00:02:22.180> youth<00:02:22.480> badge

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
quick your test here the youth badge

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.430 
quick your test here the youth badge
test<00:02:23.370> the<00:02:24.370> open<00:02:24.610> front<00:02:24.760> test<00:02:25.350> we're<00:02:26.350> gonna

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
test the open front test we're gonna

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:44.780 
test the open front test we're gonna
pick<00:02:26.710> up<00:02:26.800> my<00:02:26.830> note<00:02:27.190> for

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.720 

this<00:02:45.790> is<00:02:46.000> going<00:02:46.240> to<00:02:46.450> take<00:02:46.860> around<00:02:47.860> minutes<00:02:48.430> or

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
this is going to take around minutes or

00:02:48.730 --> 00:03:10.010 
this is going to take around minutes or
so

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:10.020 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:12.170 

and<00:03:10.380> then<00:03:10.800> I<00:03:10.890> think<00:03:10.950> it<00:03:11.220> we<00:03:11.340> might<00:03:11.520> also<00:03:11.790> do<00:03:12.000> for

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
might have done update in here but I'm

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.430 
might have done update in here but I'm
not<00:04:17.459> really<00:04:17.790> sure<00:04:17.880> about<00:04:18.120> that<00:04:18.389> as<00:04:18.989> I<00:04:19.139> said<00:04:19.350> in

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440

other<00:04:19.530> videos<00:04:19.680> I<00:04:20.310> definitely<00:04:20.729> want<00:04:20.910> them<00:04:21.090> to

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:21.299 
other videos I definitely want them to

other videos I definitely want them to
update<00:04:21.600> a<00:04:21.870> little<00:04:22.290> bit<00:04:22.410> this<00:04:22.620> speed<00:04:23.130> here<00:04:23.610> when

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210 
update a little bit this speed here when

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:26.870 
update a little bit this speed here when
you<00:04:24.330> tap<00:04:24.660> on<00:04:24.900> the<00:04:25.020> button<00:04:25.860> at<00:04:26.160> the<00:04:26.310> top<00:04:26.550> it

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
you tap on the button at the top it

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.580 
you tap on the button at the top it
takes<00:04:27.150> a<00:04:27.419> little<00:04:27.750> bit<00:04:27.900> too<00:04:28.169> long<00:04:28.350> I<00:04:28.560> think

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:28.590 
takes a little bit too long I think

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:32.330 
takes a little bit too long I think
before<00:04:29.070> that<00:04:29.310> screen<00:04:29.820> popped<00:04:30.449> up<00:04:30.600> you<00:04:31.130> did<00:04:32.130> see

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
before that screen popped up you did see

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:33.620 
before that screen popped up you did see
their<00:04:32.520> account<00:04:32.820> like<00:04:33.000> a<00:04:33.060> little<00:04:33.360> bit<00:04:33.479> of<00:04:33.570> a

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:33.630 
their account like a little bit of a

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:35.840 
their account like a little bit of a
slow<00:04:33.870> performance<00:04:34.110> and<00:04:34.740> it's<00:04:34.949> a<00:04:35.130> small<00:04:35.490> lag

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:35.850 
slow performance and it's a small lag

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:38.020 
slow performance and it's a small lag
problem<00:04:36.360> sometimes<00:04:36.780> I<00:04:37.050> mean<00:04:37.229> it's<00:04:37.350> not<00:04:37.440> major

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:38.030 
problem sometimes I mean it's not major

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:41.540 
problem sometimes I mean it's not major
but<00:04:39.030> you<00:04:39.660> kind<00:04:40.530> of<00:04:40.560> start<00:04:40.830> to<00:04:40.889> feel<00:04:41.190> that<00:04:41.220> this

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.550 
but you kind of start to feel that this

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:43.310 
but you kind of start to feel that this
device<00:04:41.880> soci<00:04:42.120> a<00:04:42.300> little<00:04:42.630> bit<00:04:42.720> more<00:04:42.900> sluggish

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:43.320 
device soci a little bit more sluggish

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:47.000 
device soci a little bit more sluggish
compared<00:04:43.740> to<00:04:43.889> new<00:04:44.070> iPhones<00:04:44.720> but<00:04:45.770> still<00:04:46.770> pretty

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:47.010 
compared to new iPhones but still pretty

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:51.169
