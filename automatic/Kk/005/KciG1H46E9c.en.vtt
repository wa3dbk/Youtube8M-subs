and<00:00:13.880> we're<00:00:14.210> back<00:00:14.330> at<00:00:14.540> Horizon<00:00:15.020> hobby<00:00:15.230> again

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:15.650 
and we're back at Horizon hobby again

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:17.110 
and we're back at Horizon hobby again
with<00:00:15.830> Dan<00:00:16.010> Schneider<00:00:16.370> he's<00:00:16.640> going<00:00:16.820> to<00:00:16.880> talk<00:00:17.090> to

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:17.120 
with Dan Schneider he's going to talk to

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:18.820 
with Dan Schneider he's going to talk to
us<00:00:17.240> about<00:00:17.390> the<00:00:17.570> X<00:00:17.720> plus<00:00:17.990> system<00:00:18.260> for<00:00:18.680> the

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:18.830 
us about the X plus system for the

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:21.580 
us about the X plus system for the
spectrum<00:00:19.250> radios<00:00:19.640> yeah<00:00:20.450> so<00:00:20.720> our<00:00:20.750> new<00:00:21.110> X<00:00:21.350> plus

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:21.590 
spectrum radios yeah so our new X plus

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:25.420 
spectrum radios yeah so our new X plus
system<00:00:21.830> that<00:00:22.220> we've<00:00:22.369> developed<00:00:24.040> as<00:00:25.040> you<00:00:25.310> can

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:25.430 
system that we've developed as you can

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:28.570 
system that we've developed as you can
see<00:00:25.640> here<00:00:25.970> you<00:00:26.689> can<00:00:26.840> have<00:00:27.020> up<00:00:27.320> to<00:00:27.350> at<00:00:27.950> this<00:00:28.220> at

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:28.580 
see here you can have up to at this at

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.960 
see here you can have up to at this at
this<00:00:28.700> time

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:28.970 
this time

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.500 
this time
up<00:00:29.210> to<00:00:29.450> 18<00:00:30.080> channels<00:00:30.560> so<00:00:31.280> with<00:00:32.000> the<00:00:32.150> X<00:00:32.300> plus

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:32.510 
up to 18 channels so with the X plus

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:36.760 
up to 18 channels so with the X plus
system<00:00:33.070> you<00:00:34.070> get<00:00:35.030> a<00:00:35.059> X<00:00:35.510> plus<00:00:35.750> 8<00:00:35.989> module<00:00:36.530> which

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:36.770 
system you get a X plus 8 module which

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.310 
system you get a X plus 8 module which
is<00:00:36.949> this<00:00:37.070> right<00:00:37.309> here<00:00:37.580> you<00:00:38.090> connect<00:00:38.480> it<00:00:38.600> to<00:00:38.629> SR

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:39.320 
is this right here you connect it to SR

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.490 
is this right here you connect it to SR
XL<00:00:39.710> port<00:00:40.010> on<00:00:40.190> the<00:00:40.460> receiver<00:00:40.790> and<00:00:41.140> you<00:00:42.140> can<00:00:42.290> add

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:42.500 
XL port on the receiver and you can add

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.030 
XL port on the receiver and you can add
up<00:00:42.680> to<00:00:42.800> 8<00:00:43.340> channels<00:00:43.370> so<00:00:44.330> in<00:00:44.690> our<00:00:44.900> DX<00:00:45.170> 10<00:00:45.440> t<00:00:45.649> and

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:46.040 
up to 8 channels so in our DX 10 t and

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.550 
up to 8 channels so in our DX 10 t and
our<00:00:46.220> new<00:00:46.370> DX<00:00:46.760> 18<00:00:47.120> transmitters<00:00:47.750> you<00:00:48.320> can

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:48.560 
our new DX 18 transmitters you can

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.220 
our new DX 18 transmitters you can
assign<00:00:49.040> any<00:00:49.520> of<00:00:49.760> these<00:00:49.880> 8<00:00:50.090> channels<00:00:50.510> to<00:00:50.660> do<00:00:50.840> any

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:51.230 
assign any of these 8 channels to do any

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:53.470 
assign any of these 8 channels to do any
feature<00:00:51.649> you<00:00:51.950> want<00:00:52.130> to<00:00:52.250> do<00:00:52.489> there<00:00:52.790> they<00:00:53.450> are

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:53.480 
feature you want to do there they are

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.910 
feature you want to do there they are
fully<00:00:53.930> proportional<00:00:54.880> 512<00:00:55.880> resolution<00:00:56.920> there

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:57.920 
fully proportional 512 resolution there

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.150 
fully proportional 512 resolution there
are<00:00:58.010> a<00:00:58.070> variable<00:00:58.579> latency<00:00:59.090> so<00:00:59.329> with<00:01:00.050> the<00:01:00.320> 512

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:01.160 
are a variable latency so with the 512

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.040 
are a variable latency so with the 512
resolution<00:01:01.790> and<00:01:02.000> variable<00:01:02.420> latency<00:01:02.809> these

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:03.050 
resolution and variable latency these

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.120 
resolution and variable latency these
are<00:01:03.230> these<00:01:03.770> 8<00:01:04.040> channels<00:01:04.460> here<00:01:04.640> are<00:01:04.940> only<00:01:05.270> 4

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.130 
are these 8 channels here are only 4

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.889 
are these 8 channels here are only 4

00:01:10.389 --> 00:01:10.399 
door and things like that we don't

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:11.800 
door and things like that we don't
recommend<00:01:10.729> them<00:01:11.000> for<00:01:11.030> flight<00:01:11.450> control

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:11.810 
recommend them for flight control

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.529 
recommend them for flight control
surfaces<00:01:12.070> but<00:01:13.070> you<00:01:13.250> can<00:01:13.399> use<00:01:13.550> them<00:01:13.670> for<00:01:13.729> a<00:01:13.940> wide

00:01:14.529 --> 00:01:14.539

great<00:01:24.350> expandability<00:01:24.950> I<00:01:25.159> mean<00:01:25.340> even<00:01:25.640> though

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:25.760 
great expandability I mean even though

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.780 
great expandability I mean even though
you're<00:01:25.909> given<00:01:26.180> 12<00:01:26.390> channels<00:01:26.869> here<00:01:27.140> with<00:01:27.470> this

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:27.790 
you're given 12 channels here with this

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.820 
module is $89.99 and it is available now
as<00:02:01.130> well<00:02:01.700> as<00:02:01.940> our<00:02:02.149> new<00:02:02.330> x+<00:02:02.990> receivers<00:02:03.470> we<00:02:03.680> have

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:03.830 
as well as our new x+ receivers we have

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:07.180 
as well as our new x+ receivers we have
3x<00:02:04.729> plus<00:02:05.030> receivers<00:02:05.540> they<00:02:05.780> are<00:02:05.960> the<00:02:06.110> AR<00:02:06.500> 90<00:02:06.830> 20

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:07.190 
3x plus receivers they are the AR 90 20

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:12.850 
3x plus receivers they are the AR 90 20
they<00:02:08.000> are<00:02:08.209> 12<00:02:08.569> 0<00:02:09.110> to<00:02:09.200> 0<00:02:09.649> and<00:02:10.069> AR<00:02:10.459> 12<00:02:10.910> 1<00:02:11.569> to<00:02:11.870> 0<00:02:12.230> so

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
they are 12 0 to 0 and AR 12 1 to 0 so

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.650 
they are 12 0 to 0 and AR 12 1 to 0 so
all<00:02:12.890> four<00:02:13.550> of<00:02:13.580> those<00:02:13.790> items<00:02:14.030> are<00:02:14.270> available

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
all four of those items are available

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.470 
all four of those items are available
now<00:02:14.780> more<00:02:15.650> great<00:02:15.950> products<00:02:16.850> from<00:02:16.910> spectrum

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
now more great products from spectrum

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.729
