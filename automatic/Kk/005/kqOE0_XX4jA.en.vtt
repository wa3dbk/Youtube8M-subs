lost<00:01:58.770> some<00:01:58.950> tier<00:01:59.189> forward<00:01:59.640> because<00:01:59.909> I<00:02:00.090> didn't

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
lost some tier forward because I didn't

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.810 
lost some tier forward because I didn't
mix<00:02:00.420> tier<00:02:00.689> three<00:02:00.960> and<00:02:01.140> at<00:02:01.259> the<00:02:01.409> time<00:02:01.700> since<00:02:02.700> I

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
mix tier three and at the time since I

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.760 
mix tier three and at the time since I
was<00:02:02.880> trying<00:02:03.090> to<00:02:03.180> rush<00:02:03.360> out<00:02:03.600> and<00:02:03.869> tile<00:02:04.409> hit<00:02:04.649> him

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
was trying to rush out and tile hit him

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.039 
was trying to rush out and tile hit him
before<00:02:04.979> he<00:02:05.340> recalled<00:02:05.640> but<00:02:06.479> we<00:02:06.600> did<00:02:06.750> some<00:02:06.899> good

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
before he recalled but we did some good

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.589 
before he recalled but we did some good
damage<00:02:07.290> and<00:02:07.950> as<00:02:08.310> hero<00:02:08.550> wasn't<00:02:08.729> here<00:02:09.060> so<00:02:09.300> he

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
damage and as hero wasn't here so he

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:13.580 
damage and as hero wasn't here so he
really<00:02:10.140> did<00:02:10.349> no<00:02:10.590> damage<00:02:10.619> at<00:02:11.009> all<00:02:11.099> to<00:02:11.280> me<00:02:12.349> okay

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
really did no damage at all to me okay

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:20.830 
really did no damage at all to me okay
move<00:02:13.890> on<00:02:18.019> so<00:02:19.019> we<00:02:19.050> found<00:02:19.349> somebody<00:02:19.709> with<00:02:19.920> about

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
move on so we found somebody with about

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:26.089 
move on so we found somebody with about
240,000<00:02:22.099> tier<00:02:23.099> 3<00:02:23.790> and<00:02:24.440> decent<00:02:25.440> here<00:02:25.650> I<00:02:25.680> believe

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:26.099 
240,000 tier 3 and decent here I believe

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:29.180 
240,000 tier 3 and decent here I believe
it<00:02:26.250> was<00:02:26.340> level<00:02:26.489> 50<00:02:27.239> level<00:02:27.810> 49<00:02:28.110> and<00:02:28.650> we<00:02:28.890> got<00:02:29.040> some

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
it was level 50 level 49 and we got some

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.369 
it was level 50 level 49 and we got some
of<00:02:29.310> his<00:02:29.459> resources<00:02:29.840> killed<00:02:30.840> about<00:02:31.049> 70

00:02:31.369 --> 00:02:31.379 
of his resources killed about 70

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:33.350 
of his resources killed about 70
thousand<00:02:31.709> of<00:02:31.769> his<00:02:31.890> troops<00:02:32.190> and<00:02:32.519> lost<00:02:32.879> six

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
thousand of his troops and lost six

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.990 
thousand of his troops and lost six
thousand<00:02:33.750> of<00:02:33.810> our<00:02:33.900> own<00:02:34.340> it's<00:02:35.340> very<00:02:35.430> similar<00:02:35.879> to

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
thousand of our own it's very similar to

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.559 
thousand of our own it's very similar to
the<00:02:36.390> first<00:02:36.750> report<00:02:37.349> he<00:02:38.310> got<00:02:38.519> lucky<00:02:38.700> though<00:02:39.120> it

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569 
the first report he got lucky though it

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:42.589 
the first report he got lucky though it
seems<00:02:39.840> like<00:02:40.170> all<00:02:41.160> the<00:02:41.459> troops<00:02:41.700> killed<00:02:42.090> where

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599 
seems like all the troops killed where

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:46.759 
seems like all the troops killed where
tier<00:02:43.080> two<00:02:43.700> so<00:02:44.700> lucky<00:02:45.360> break<00:02:45.540> for<00:02:45.690> him<00:02:45.780> okay

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 
tier two so lucky break for him okay

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:50.150 
tier two so lucky break for him okay
moving<00:02:47.130> on<00:02:47.310> so<00:02:48.090> this<00:02:48.930> guy<00:02:49.290> had<00:02:49.860> a<00:02:49.890> lot<00:02:50.130> more

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
moving on so this guy had a lot more

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.120 
moving on so this guy had a lot more
troops<00:02:50.640> and<00:02:50.880> the<00:02:51.000> rest<00:02:51.590> he<00:02:52.590> was<00:02:52.739> a<00:02:52.769> little<00:02:53.010> bit

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
troops and the rest he was a little bit

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:54.740 
troops and the rest he was a little bit
bigger<00:02:53.310> and<00:02:53.549> it<00:02:53.670> took<00:02:53.849> us<00:02:54.000> two<00:02:54.150> hits<00:02:54.360> to<00:02:54.510> zero

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
bigger and it took us two hits to zero

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.479 
bigger and it took us two hits to zero
him<00:02:54.989> he<00:02:55.200> had<00:02:55.290> a<00:02:55.349> little<00:02:55.500> forty<00:02:55.799> nine<00:02:55.950> hero<00:02:56.220> with

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
him he had a little forty nine hero with

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:59.449 
him he had a little forty nine hero with
a<00:02:56.519> coincidental<00:02:57.349> same<00:02:58.349> name<00:02:58.620> as<00:02:59.010> the<00:02:59.250> glass

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
a coincidental same name as the glass

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:01.339 
a coincidental same name as the glass
report<00:03:00.000> but<00:03:00.239> it<00:03:00.360> is<00:03:00.480> definitely<00:03:01.019> a<00:03:01.049> different

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:01.349 
report but it is definitely a different

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:03.949 
report but it is definitely a different
person<00:03:01.430> we've<00:03:02.430> got<00:03:02.670> some<00:03:02.879> good<00:03:03.030> resources<00:03:03.390> and

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
person we've got some good resources and

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:05.300 
person we've got some good resources and
I<00:03:04.019> think<00:03:04.200> we<00:03:04.290> lost<00:03:04.410> a<00:03:04.560> little<00:03:04.650> bit<00:03:04.829> of<00:03:04.980> tier<00:03:05.160> 4

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
I think we lost a little bit of tier 4

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:06.979 
I think we lost a little bit of tier 4
and<00:03:05.489> this<00:03:05.579> hit<00:03:05.760> actually<00:03:06.180> because<00:03:06.480> I<00:03:06.660> did<00:03:06.810> not

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
and this hit actually because I did not

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:10.940 
and this hit actually because I did not
estimate<00:03:07.620> right<00:03:08.310> and<00:03:08.549> I<00:03:08.610> sent<00:03:09.079> only<00:03:10.079> 10,000

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
estimate right and I sent only 10,000

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.610 
estimate right and I sent only 10,000
tier<00:03:11.099> 3<00:03:11.459> where<00:03:12.360> if<00:03:12.510> I<00:03:12.599> sent<00:03:12.810> a<00:03:12.870> 15,000<00:03:13.590> that

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
tier 3 where if I sent a 15,000 that

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:14.839 
tier 3 where if I sent a 15,000 that
probably<00:03:13.950> would<00:03:14.069> have<00:03:14.160> been<00:03:14.280> enough<00:03:14.610> to

00:03:14.839 --> 00:03:14.849 
probably would have been enough to

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:16.819 
probably would have been enough to
protect<00:03:15.180> some<00:03:15.390> all<00:03:15.599> the<00:03:15.810> tier<00:03:15.989> 4<00:03:16.200> but<00:03:16.470> losing

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:16.829 
protect some all the tier 4 but losing

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:18.979 
protect some all the tier 4 but losing
5000<00:03:17.310> tier<00:03:17.400> 4<00:03:17.579> isn't<00:03:17.730> that<00:03:17.910> bad<00:03:18.060> as<00:03:18.299> you<00:03:18.840> can

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
5000 tier 4 isn't that bad as you can

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:21.530 
5000 tier 4 isn't that bad as you can
see<00:03:19.109> the<00:03:19.260> majority<00:03:19.380> of<00:03:19.739> his<00:03:19.950> troops<00:03:20.220> were<00:03:20.549> tier

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
see the majority of his troops were tier

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.319 
see the majority of his troops were tier
3<00:03:21.959> but<00:03:22.769> the<00:03:22.950> first<00:03:23.370> hit<00:03:23.609> we<00:03:23.700> only<00:03:23.850> wounded<00:03:24.269> a

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:24.329 
3 but the first hit we only wounded a

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:25.849 
3 but the first hit we only wounded a
lot<00:03:24.450> of<00:03:24.569> troops<00:03:24.750> so<00:03:24.930> that<00:03:25.049> means<00:03:25.230> he<00:03:25.530> had<00:03:25.650> a<00:03:25.680> lot

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:25.859 
lot of troops so that means he had a lot

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:27.949 
lot of troops so that means he had a lot
of<00:03:25.889> hospitals<00:03:26.489> I<00:03:26.760> on<00:03:26.910> first<00:03:27.540> off<00:03:27.720> I<00:03:27.810> thought

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
of hospitals I on first off I thought

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:29.420 
of hospitals I on first off I thought
this<00:03:28.109> was<00:03:28.230> a<00:03:28.260> trap<00:03:28.590> account<00:03:28.920> because<00:03:29.310> there

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
this was a trap account because there

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.460 
this was a trap account because there
was<00:03:29.519> a<00:03:29.579> six<00:03:29.849> hundred<00:03:30.150> million<00:03:30.299> power<00:03:31.079> account

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
was a six hundred million power account

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:32.870 
was a six hundred million power account
that<00:03:31.620> poured<00:03:31.829> it<00:03:31.950> out<00:03:32.040> right<00:03:32.400> when<00:03:32.549> I<00:03:32.579> poured

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
that poured it out right when I poured

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.539 
that poured it out right when I poured
it<00:03:32.970> in<00:03:33.260> except<00:03:34.260> I<00:03:34.349> scouted<00:03:34.650> him<00:03:34.829> and<00:03:35.099> saw<00:03:35.280> it

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:35.549 
it in except I scouted him and saw it

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:37.339 
it in except I scouted him and saw it
wasn't<00:03:35.819> it<00:03:36.239> so<00:03:36.569> I<00:03:36.630> don't<00:03:36.840> really<00:03:36.989> know<00:03:37.139> what's

00:03:37.339 --> 00:03:37.349 
wasn't it so I don't really know what's

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:39.379 
wasn't it so I don't really know what's
going<00:03:37.530> on<00:03:37.620> there<00:03:37.829> but<00:03:38.040> the<00:03:38.639> second<00:03:38.940> hit<00:03:39.120> we

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:39.389 
going on there but the second hit we

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:42.289 
going on there but the second hit we
lost<00:03:39.569> another<00:03:40.160> 5,000<00:03:41.160> Tier<00:03:41.310> three<00:03:41.370> and<00:03:42.030> finish

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:42.299 
lost another 5,000 Tier three and finish

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:45.199 
lost another 5,000 Tier three and finish
him<00:03:42.450> off<00:03:42.739> so<00:03:43.739> we<00:03:43.919> wiped<00:03:44.160> him<00:03:44.310> out<00:03:44.400> quite<00:03:44.669> a<00:03:44.700> bit

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
him off so we wiped him out quite a bit

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:46.819 
him off so we wiped him out quite a bit
he<00:03:45.540> went<00:03:45.720> from<00:03:45.870> about<00:03:46.019> three<00:03:46.470> hundred<00:03:46.769> and

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:46.829 
he went from about three hundred and
