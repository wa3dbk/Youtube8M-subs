this particular one is a Styrofoam one

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.670 
this particular one is a Styrofoam one
but<00:00:05.520> you<00:00:05.609> can<00:00:05.730> use<00:00:05.910> the<00:00:06.060> paper<00:00:06.270> kind<00:00:06.569> and<00:00:06.839> turn

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
but you can use the paper kind and turn

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:13.549 
but you can use the paper kind and turn
it<00:00:07.890> into<00:00:08.160> a<00:00:09.679> seedling<00:00:10.679> starter<00:00:12.320> the<00:00:13.320> first

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
it into a seedling starter the first

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.210 
it into a seedling starter the first
thing<00:00:13.769> we<00:00:13.860> need<00:00:14.009> to<00:00:14.040> do<00:00:14.309> is<00:00:15.379> cut<00:00:16.379> it<00:00:16.410> into<00:00:16.920> two

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
thing we need to do is cut it into two

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.820 
thing we need to do is cut it into two
separate<00:00:17.640> sections<00:00:18.020> so<00:00:19.020> go<00:00:19.289> ahead<00:00:19.439> and<00:00:19.560> open

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
separate sections so go ahead and open

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.849 
separate sections so go ahead and open
up<00:00:20.160> the<00:00:20.430> egg<00:00:20.640> carton<00:00:21.270> and<00:00:21.539> cut<00:00:22.289> right<00:00:22.529> along

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
up the egg carton and cut right along

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.410 
up the egg carton and cut right along
the<00:00:23.310> fold<00:00:23.609> now<00:00:25.609> the<00:00:26.609> other<00:00:26.880> thing<00:00:27.119> I'm<00:00:27.240> also

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
the fold now the other thing I'm also

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.919 
the fold now the other thing I'm also
going<00:00:27.720> to<00:00:27.840> do<00:00:28.230> is<00:00:28.529> to<00:00:29.220> cut<00:00:30.060> off<00:00:30.240> this<00:00:30.480> flap

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
going to do is to cut off this flap

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:38.170 
going to do is to cut off this flap
right<00:00:31.230> here<00:00:31.260> so<00:00:31.830> it<00:00:31.949> doesn't<00:00:31.980> get<00:00:32.399> in<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:32.640> way

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:38.180 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.060 

and<00:00:39.180> then<00:00:39.510> we<00:00:39.660> also<00:00:39.840> need<00:00:40.170> to<00:00:40.350> create<00:00:40.620> some

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
and then we also need to create some

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.729 
and then we also need to create some
drainage<00:00:41.430> holes<00:00:41.910> so<00:00:42.809> I'm<00:00:43.140> just<00:00:43.320> going<00:00:43.440> to<00:00:43.500> take

drainage holes so I'm just going to take

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.979 
drainage holes so I'm just going to take
an<00:00:43.920> awl<00:00:44.160> which<00:00:44.760> basically<00:00:45.329> just<00:00:45.510> has<00:00:45.690> kind<00:00:45.899> of

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
an awl which basically just has kind of

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.779 
an awl which basically just has kind of
a<00:00:46.110> sharp<00:00:46.320> point<00:00:46.710> you<00:00:47.250> can<00:00:47.399> take<00:00:47.550> a<00:00:47.579> regular

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
a sharp point you can take a regular

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.090 
a sharp point you can take a regular
pencil<00:00:48.420> or<00:00:48.539> pen<00:00:48.750> doesn't<00:00:49.079> really<00:00:49.350> matter<00:00:49.620> and

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
pencil or pen doesn't really matter and

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.279 
pencil or pen doesn't really matter and
I'm<00:00:50.370> just<00:00:50.550> gonna<00:00:50.700> go<00:00:50.940> ahead<00:00:51.090> and<00:00:51.510> poke<00:00:51.899> holes

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
I'm just gonna go ahead and poke holes

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.400 
I'm just gonna go ahead and poke holes
in<00:00:52.710> each<00:00:53.579> of<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:53.969> compartments<00:00:54.390> and<00:00:54.870> I'm

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
in each of the compartments and I'm

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.270 
in each of the compartments and I'm
going<00:00:55.770> to<00:00:55.920> poke<00:00:56.210> five<00:00:57.210> holes<00:00:58.280> basically

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
going to poke five holes basically

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.270 
going to poke five holes basically
almost<00:01:00.000> like<00:01:00.180> a<00:01:00.210> domino<00:01:00.989> effect<00:01:01.020> or<00:01:01.859> domino

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
almost like a domino effect or domino

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
look and we're gonna do that into all of

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.240 
look and we're gonna do that into all of
our<00:01:05.990> holes

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.250 
our holes

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.690 
our holes
now<00:01:08.250> that<00:01:08.460> I<00:01:08.490> have<00:01:08.880> holes<00:01:09.270> punctured<00:01:10.280> into<00:01:11.280> all

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
now that I have holes punctured into all

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.600 
now that I have holes punctured into all
of<00:01:11.760> these<00:01:12.330> spaces<00:01:12.810> we're<00:01:13.740> gonna<00:01:13.950> go<00:01:14.130> ahead<00:01:14.310> and

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
of these spaces we're gonna go ahead and

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.929 
of these spaces we're gonna go ahead and
fill<00:01:14.790> this<00:01:14.939> up<00:01:15.150> with<00:01:15.360> dirt<00:01:16.280> now<00:01:17.280> I<00:01:17.340> have<00:01:17.729> one

here that I've already started you can
see<00:01:20.820> some<00:01:21.090> of<00:01:21.119> my<00:01:21.240> seedlings<00:01:21.869> already<00:01:22.290> coming

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
see some of my seedlings already coming

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.030 
see some of my seedlings already coming
up<00:01:22.890> but<00:01:23.790> what<00:01:23.909> I<00:01:23.939> wanted<00:01:24.270> to<00:01:24.420> show<00:01:24.659> you<00:01:24.689> is<00:01:25.170> when

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
up but what I wanted to show you is when

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.539 
up but what I wanted to show you is when
we<00:01:26.220> had<00:01:26.430> originally<00:01:26.700> done<00:01:27.829> this<00:01:28.829> and<00:01:29.250> cut<00:01:29.460> them

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
we had originally done this and cut them

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.640 
we had originally done this and cut them
up<00:01:29.700> we<00:01:30.119> still<00:01:30.420> want<00:01:30.630> to<00:01:30.689> keep<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:31.140> lid<00:01:31.380> and

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
up we still want to keep the lid and

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.160 
up we still want to keep the lid and
what<00:01:32.130> happens<00:01:32.579> with<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:32.939> lid<00:01:33.150> is<00:01:33.479> it<00:01:33.810> becomes

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
what happens with the lid is it becomes

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.060 
what happens with the lid is it becomes
a<00:01:34.409> trade<00:01:34.829> for<00:01:35.220> us<00:01:35.720> that<00:01:36.720> will<00:01:37.079> hold<00:01:37.380> the<00:01:37.650> excess

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
a trade for us that will hold the excess

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.140 
a trade for us that will hold the excess
water<00:01:38.310> now<00:01:39.270> rather<00:01:39.630> than<00:01:40.049> trying<00:01:40.409> to<00:01:40.790> water<00:01:41.790> in

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
water now rather than trying to water in

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.330 
water now rather than trying to water in
this<00:01:42.390> top<00:01:42.720> section<00:01:43.049> where<00:01:43.439> it<00:01:43.590> can<00:01:43.740> be<00:01:43.860> kind<00:01:44.159> of

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
this top section where it can be kind of

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.310 
this top section where it can be kind of
iffy<00:01:44.880> and<00:01:45.030> you<00:01:45.149> don't<00:01:45.329> want<00:01:45.509> to<00:01:45.600> do<00:01:45.780> too<00:01:46.140> much

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
iffy and you don't want to do too much

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.160 
iffy and you don't want to do too much
water<00:01:46.590> what<00:01:47.549> I'm<00:01:47.670> going<00:01:48.030> to<00:01:48.180> do<00:01:48.360> is<00:01:48.630> actually

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
water what I'm going to do is actually

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.580 
water what I'm going to do is actually
pour<00:01:49.500> water<00:01:49.770> into<00:01:50.369> this<00:01:50.820> bottom<00:01:51.360> tray<00:01:51.720> now

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
pour water into this bottom tray now

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.410 
pour water into this bottom tray now
when<00:01:52.829> you're<00:01:53.009> pouring<00:01:53.369> water<00:01:53.759> into<00:01:54.270> it

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
when you're pouring water into it

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.499 
when you're pouring water into it
remember<00:01:54.990> that<00:01:55.020> you<00:01:55.290> have<00:01:55.560> those<00:01:56.119> holes<00:01:57.119> on

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
remember that you have those holes on

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.620 
remember that you have those holes on
the<00:01:57.659> side<00:01:57.899> where<00:01:58.649> the<00:01:58.829> latch<00:01:59.130> came<00:01:59.909> into<00:02:00.119> from

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
the side where the latch came into from

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.080 
the side where the latch came into from
the<00:02:00.750> other<00:02:00.899> part<00:02:01.290> of<00:02:01.409> the<00:02:01.530> styrofoam<00:02:01.880> so<00:02:02.880> when

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
the other part of the styrofoam so when

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.940 
the other part of the styrofoam so when
you're<00:02:03.240> filling<00:02:03.509> it<00:02:03.810> with<00:02:03.840> water<00:02:03.990> you<00:02:04.439> want<00:02:04.829> to

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
you're filling it with water you want to

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.920 
you're filling it with water you want to
make<00:02:05.009> sure<00:02:05.130> that<00:02:05.640> you<00:02:05.759> don't<00:02:05.939> go<00:02:06.210> past<00:02:06.540> those

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
make sure that you don't go past those

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.859 
make sure that you don't go past those
because<00:02:07.590> then<00:02:07.710> it's<00:02:07.860> going<00:02:07.979> to<00:02:08.039> overflow<00:02:08.479> so<00:02:09.479> I

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
because then it's going to overflow so I

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.380 
because then it's going to overflow so I
have<00:02:10.259> basically<00:02:10.860> a

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
have basically a

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.420 
have basically a
an<00:02:11.510> eighth<00:02:11.720> of<00:02:11.900> an<00:02:11.990> inch<00:02:12.110> quarter<00:02:13.100> of<00:02:13.220> an<00:02:13.340> inch

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
an eighth of an inch quarter of an inch

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.090 
an eighth of an inch quarter of an inch
of<00:02:13.640> water<00:02:13.850> poured<00:02:14.360> into<00:02:14.510> the<00:02:14.720> tray<00:02:14.990> then<00:02:15.830> all

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.100 
of water poured into the tray then all

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.610 
of water poured into the tray then all
I'm<00:02:16.280> gonna<00:02:16.459> do<00:02:16.700> is<00:02:16.730> take<00:02:17.360> the<00:02:17.569> top<00:02:17.930> part<00:02:18.260> with

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
I'm gonna do is take the top part with

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.570 
I'm gonna do is take the top part with
my<00:02:19.959> with<00:02:20.959> my<00:02:21.110> soil<00:02:21.380> and<00:02:21.740> my<00:02:21.860> seeds<00:02:22.130> and<00:02:22.459> I'm

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
my with my soil and my seeds and I'm

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.699 
my with my soil and my seeds and I'm
just<00:02:22.819> going<00:02:22.970> to<00:02:23.030> pour<00:02:23.330> it<00:02:23.360> but<00:02:23.990> just<00:02:24.200> literally

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:24.709 
just going to pour it but just literally

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:27.400 
just going to pour it but just literally
right<00:02:25.190> into<00:02:25.580> the<00:02:25.700> tray<00:02:26.000> and<00:02:26.300> what<00:02:26.959> happens

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
right into the tray and what happens

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.280 
right into the tray and what happens
because<00:02:27.680> we<00:02:28.160> had<00:02:28.370> those<00:02:28.730> holes<00:02:29.290> punctured

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
because we had those holes punctured

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.640 
because we had those holes punctured
into<00:02:30.980> the<00:02:31.160> styrofoam<00:02:31.459> it<00:02:32.270> basically<00:02:33.200> becomes

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
into the styrofoam it basically becomes

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.840 
into the styrofoam it basically becomes
a<00:02:33.830> nice<00:02:34.700> way<00:02:35.030> for<00:02:35.630> the<00:02:35.990> water<00:02:36.980> to<00:02:37.280> seep<00:02:37.520> into

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
a nice way for the water to seep into

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:42.250 
a nice way for the water to seep into
the<00:02:38.209> soil<00:02:39.310> without<00:02:40.310> being<00:02:40.750> too<00:02:41.750> much<00:02:41.989> water

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
the soil without being too much water

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.530 
the soil without being too much water
and<00:02:42.560> it<00:02:43.100> kind<00:02:43.340> of<00:02:43.430> does<00:02:43.610> it<00:02:43.760> proportionately

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
and it kind of does it proportionately

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.470 
and it kind of does it proportionately
now<00:02:45.380> when<00:02:45.650> you<00:02:45.890> first<00:02:46.340> put<00:02:46.700> in<00:02:46.820> your<00:02:46.970> seeds<00:02:47.270> you

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
now when you first put in your seeds you

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.810 
now when you first put in your seeds you
might<00:02:47.690> want<00:02:47.989> to<00:02:48.140> just<00:02:48.590> do<00:02:48.770> one<00:02:49.130> layer<00:02:49.400> of<00:02:49.580> water

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:49.820 
might want to just do one layer of water

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:52.540 
might want to just do one layer of water
over<00:02:50.180> top<00:02:50.420> that<00:02:50.720> first<00:02:51.019> time<00:02:51.380> just<00:02:52.070> so<00:02:52.310> that

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:52.550 
over top that first time just so that

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:54.699 
over top that first time just so that
the<00:02:52.760> seeds<00:02:53.090> get<00:02:53.360> some<00:02:53.630> water<00:02:53.900> to<00:02:54.200> start<00:02:54.500> with

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:54.709 
the seeds get some water to start with

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:56.590 
the seeds get some water to start with
but<00:02:55.489> then<00:02:55.640> once<00:02:55.880> you've<00:02:56.030> done<00:02:56.060> that<00:02:56.390> first

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:56.600 
but then once you've done that first

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.440 
but then once you've done that first
watering<00:02:57.170> I<00:02:57.320> do<00:02:57.620> all<00:02:58.280> of<00:02:58.310> the<00:02:58.700> watering<00:02:59.180> from
