00:00:24.989 --> 00:00:26.890
 we remember that this record will be 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:29.890
 so even if you do not like it you can say that 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.310
 this idea smudge cereté investments made by wines and distributed by 

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:39.640
 activision 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:40.650
 in short hair 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:44.550
 spiderman destroy by accident a board held by mystery what 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.190
 causes three dimensions plus his own this danger of disappearing 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.300
 and in this way the adventure begins in which you can use the four different 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.980
 this idea mans in his own time in search of the festivities of the capital 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.920
 these characters are the normal spiderman the the universe to me and zinc 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.670
 dying and the year of 2099 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.670
 and so that not only was the image of each of 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.720
 they included differences between some of the game's actions 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.200
 the normal will have the qualities to known as they are hanging with their 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.460
 cobwebs grabbed by who knows what the fuck together with being able to fight body to 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.700
 body using its web to hit the opponent with a certain combination of 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:24.540
 buttons 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.810
 the one that the universe 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:28.240
 except what is it 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.730
 You can wear the black suit 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:31.270
 avoided occasions 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:34.700
 with the hesperides juan luis the thing changes since its gameplay 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.290
 to hide in the 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:38.940
 honduras and attack without being seen as they do 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.940
 the games to explain to you 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:46.810
 the future has the characteristic of being able to plan in the air 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:51.040
 resulting in some battles against enemies while you walk inside 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.370
 of a tunnel and full of flying cars 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:54.829
 up here we go well 

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:58.219
 but like any good game based on something also has flaws 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:04.100
 to start the camera is annoying especially while you fight as it accommodates 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.080
 point where you see everything except what you do doing that you have to be the 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.850
 motion of confidence to the rights 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:11.759
 and that is really annoying 

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:15.219
 another thing is the ability to throw a web somewhere and then 

00:02:15.219 --> 00:02:19.809
 move to the fotam well towards an enemy that although it was a good idea to 

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:21.029
 include this option 

00:02:21.029 --> 00:02:25.119
 because of the huge number of points where it could reach on screens 

00:02:25.119 --> 00:02:26.489
 being that finally 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:29.739
 really want to know 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:33.790
 the last problem I had with the game was while playing with this idea 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.609
 is more of the future since the graphics of exaggerated future caused that 

00:02:37.609 --> 00:02:40.609
 I lost the vision of the enemy and my character 

00:02:41.219 --> 00:02:44.129
 when he fought with 

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:48.419
 something that I liked very much was that during each mission of the game you fight 

00:02:48.419 --> 00:02:50.309
 with 

00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:53.309
 one using its normal activity and another arriving 

00:02:53.869 --> 00:02:55.289
 thanks to the power that 

00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:58.399
 the pieces of the table of the 

00:02:58.399 --> 00:03:01.399
 bosses are the best although they are not the best known 

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:06.419
 the voice they use is perfect their personality the fights against them are 

00:03:06.419 --> 00:03:10.169
 good and its design is as close to what I guess should be 

00:03:10.169 --> 00:03:10.999
 to have 

00:03:10.999 --> 00:03:14.149
 another thing to note is that almost killing them 

00:03:14.149 --> 00:03:18.379
 they give you the final challenge of having a melee fight against him using 

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:21.169
 the two analogs as one arm each 

00:03:21.169 --> 00:03:22.480
 the graphics are not 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.150
 very good but this is due to the caricature style that the 

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:30.749
 but if he lacked some effort in making the scenarios, although the 

00:03:30.749 --> 00:03:34.059
 Main characters are full of details 

00:03:34.059 --> 00:03:36.899
 the dialogues are the most entertaining 

00:03:36.899 --> 00:03:40.809
 the jokes he makes is asking for forgiveness about the villains and their appearances that 

00:03:40.809 --> 00:03:45.019
 I'm sure you'll get a smile from your bitter faces 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:49.239
 With the passage of time and experience collection you can buy more 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:53.739
 new skills with two signings for each of the writers more 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:57.179
 which I could not see because I always forgot to change it 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:03.779
 one of the expedition 

00:04:03.779 --> 00:04:07.779
 they had already made the arachnid's voice at least once in their life and another is that 

00:04:07.779 --> 00:04:09.049
 someone 

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:10.049
 when we send 

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:11.619
 is explaining 

00:04:11.619 --> 00:04:14.619
 german about what happened to 

00:04:17.809 --> 00:04:18.769
 as you will already know 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:21.769
 it is not known again 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:26.270
 every three little ones already fans of the series 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:32.740
 although he knows 

00:04:34.259 --> 00:04:37.259
 cuétara if you get to 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:41.760
 recent to be satisfied
