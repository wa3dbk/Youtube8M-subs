 the first time they are not yet defined per hour 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:33.180
 laziness 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.610
 and civility 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:35.960
 - the ine this month 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:36.899
 in the statement 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.430
 the most important places 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.430
 the minister intervened that those who think it is 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.680
 efe 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.030
 picture of your pet's picture 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.030
 similar cd @ josé six points 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.360
 in the day's consultation 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.249
 today the topic that we are going to play 

00:01:53.249 --> 00:01:54.270
 the tit 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.270
 I would like our house 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:06.000
 although this midfielder parakeet 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.010
 indicated years ago in the company percent has not yet learned to speak 

00:02:11.999 --> 00:02:16.029
 I have been stripped he commented on the gold and the cessation of veterinary 

00:02:16.789 --> 00:02:21.629
 perico per cent to the veterinarian how generally all the 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:22.519
 keys 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:28.360
 why they have bought it why in country relative a friend from the countryside 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.459
 never a yes or parrot receiving was already 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:32.829
 in an-12 pen 

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:36.609
 because I was going down the street and found a street vendor 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:39.889
 engaged in marketing 

00:02:39.889 --> 00:02:41.649
 after notice 

00:02:41.649 --> 00:02:45.500
 these merits why once it serves narrow 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:46.660
 indigenous 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.639
 i is allowed 

00:02:49.639 --> 00:02:51.209
 to holding 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:55.000
 in homes because it is declared as a national beach 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:58.650
 what are not allowed are the talkative parrot 

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:01.529
 which is bigger than the tit 

00:03:01.529 --> 00:03:05.919
 and he pampita not that it is an achievement more than talkative whistler 

00:03:05.919 --> 00:03:09.849
 are two species that are currently in extinction 

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:11.570
 i obviously 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:14.119
 in new we can not even buy them 

00:03:14.119 --> 00:03:17.119
 not so bad in tenure 

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:34.579
 let's see what kind of food 

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:37.119
 we can give 

00:03:37.119 --> 00:03:41.439
 because it falls one of the biggest problems we give you of all the gold not 

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:45.929
 is not physically difficult in logically prepared 

00:03:45.929 --> 00:03:48.929
 like to eat everything we eat 

00:03:49.999 --> 00:03:52.349
 what to keep in mind that in one of 

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:55.239
 wild therefore the 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:56.919
 basic ration 

00:03:56.919 --> 00:03:59.649
 of feeding have to be seeds 

00:03:59.649 --> 00:04:01.849
 or derived from the ashes 

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:04.319
 for example the polenta vein 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:05.349
 ipiña 

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:08.349
 processed products based on cereals 

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:11.659
 water techniques 

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:13.689
 after the titan in serials 

00:04:13.689 --> 00:04:15.879
 the bread wet with milk 

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:21.169
 which is a typical traditional food for these parrot that they love 

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:24.229
 but if we are going to supply 

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:27.689
 the English oppressor use the bark 

00:04:27.689 --> 00:04:29.129
 not mine 

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:31.809
 we can wet it in milk 

00:04:31.809 --> 00:04:36.939
 We drain it out of the excess liquid that it may have and we give it 

00:04:36.939 --> 00:04:39.629
 that kind of porridge 

00:04:39.629 --> 00:04:43.429
 another home-made food that we can supply and that will never do 

00:04:43.429 --> 00:04:44.050
 wrong 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:45.319
 the polenta 

00:04:45.319 --> 00:04:46.849
 made with water 

00:04:46.849 --> 00:04:49.979
 simply and with a little salt 

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:52.979
 because for salt because this species 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:57.300
 percent and sodium chloride 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:01.440
 mainly for the growth and vice of its plumage 

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:04.229
 what else can we give 

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:05.620
 fruits 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:07.080
 basically 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:09.740
 Apple 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:11.330
 the habitat d 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:12.479
 of this animal 

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:16.099
 they adapt perfectly whether it's a cage 

00:05:16.099 --> 00:05:17.839
 as to the hoop 

00:05:17.839 --> 00:05:19.120
 what can we have 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.779
 or directly 

00:05:21.779 --> 00:05:23.749
 if we are going to have it above all 

00:05:23.749 --> 00:05:27.819
 we have to change in mind that the pens have to be cut 

00:05:28.789 --> 00:05:33.150
 I would tell you that you rely on the vet and tell your veterinarian to cut you 

00:05:33.149 --> 00:05:34.099
 the wings 

00:05:34.099 --> 00:05:36.210
 because the canutos 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:39.210
 of the feathers shongwe kos 

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:45.719
 if they are badly cut or very close to the implant of the pen 

00:05:45.719 --> 00:05:49.389
 can enter bongo bacteria through cough duct 

00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:51.740
 and produce a nurse 

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:54.009
 If we are going to have it installed 

00:05:54.009 --> 00:05:57.819
 the cage will always be dirty because they are animals that scatter 

00:05:57.819 --> 00:06:02.009
 a lot of food and they are spotted several times in the day 

00:06:02.009 --> 00:06:05.769
 therefore the most important good hygiene 

00:06:06.369 --> 00:06:07.389
 A wash 

00:06:07.389 --> 00:06:09.520
 once or twice a day 

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:14.639
 and use in the floor tray of the cage sodium hypochlorite water 

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:15.550
 bleach 

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:17.619
 that with that we are going to prevent 

00:06:17.619 --> 00:06:20.619
 much of the disease is that this bird can contract 

00:06:21.619 --> 00:06:24.300
 since we touched on the disease 

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:27.270
 let's talk about one of the best known 

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:29.379
 because apart from attacking 

00:06:29.379 --> 00:06:30.529
 to the birds 

00:06:30.529 --> 00:06:33.150
 percent we can against us 

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:35.580
 that the desire as it is if tacos and 

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:38.909
 Psittacosis does not only affect parrots 

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:41.860
 affects all birds 

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:47.590
 there is a prophylactic treatment that is done through the intake of 

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:53.289
 a specific antibiotic that kill and control the bacteria that this 

00:06:53.289 --> 00:06:54.499
 disease 

00:06:54.499 --> 00:06:58.669
 that is given for several days in a row, a break is made and then it becomes 

00:06:58.669 --> 00:06:59.899
 to repeat 

00:06:59.899 --> 00:07:03.089
 that obviously the high bridge veterinarian 

00:07:03.089 --> 00:07:06.050
 I will advise and advise perfectly well 

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:06.819
 that is to say 

00:07:06.819 --> 00:07:10.580
 if we have in this kind of stress caused in is very difficult 

00:07:11.139 --> 00:07:12.379
 that our 

00:07:12.379 --> 00:07:14.569
 against it the psittacosis 

00:07:14.569 --> 00:07:20.400
 as a veterinarian I can advise you why they are very tender animals 

00:07:21.249 --> 00:07:24.479
 the one that have that habit of emitting 

00:07:24.479 --> 00:07:26.659
 can copy the sounds 

00:07:26.659 --> 00:07:29.089
 that theoretically always tenth 

00:07:29.089 --> 00:07:31.039
 how is he talking? 

00:07:31.039 --> 00:07:34.110
 percent is a special week and 

00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:37.119
 for both adults and children 

00:07:37.119 --> 00:07:39.789
 percent in mind in a pet 

00:07:39.789 --> 00:07:41.499
 and one and company 

00:07:41.499 --> 00:07:43.490
 very important 

00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:49.970
 well my pet has said we thank you i did not find in the next 

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:51.720
 similar in the query of the day
