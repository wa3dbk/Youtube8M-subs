I<00:01:55.540> really<00:01:55.930> want<00:01:56.140> you<00:01:56.230> to<00:01:56.350> think<00:01:56.560> about<00:01:56.680> here<00:01:57.100> is

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 
I really want you to think about here is

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.960 
I really want you to think about here is
a<00:01:57.550> is<00:01:57.730> a<00:01:58.000> big<00:01:58.570> topspin<00:01:59.470> second<00:02:00.400> serve<00:02:00.610> where

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:00.970 
a is a big topspin second serve where

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:02.790 
a is a big topspin second serve where
you<00:02:01.090> think<00:02:01.330> about<00:02:01.390> height<00:02:01.900> over<00:02:02.290> the<00:02:02.409> top<00:02:02.620> of

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:02.800 
you think about height over the top of

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.010 
you think about height over the top of
the<00:02:02.860> net<00:02:03.070> and<00:02:03.340> making<00:02:04.240> sure<00:02:04.479> the<00:02:04.750> height

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 
the net and making sure the height

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:06.930 
the net and making sure the height
obviously<00:02:05.260> clears<00:02:05.950> the<00:02:06.100> net<00:02:06.310> so<00:02:06.520> you<00:02:06.580> don't

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:06.940 
obviously clears the net so you don't

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.359 
obviously clears the net so you don't
ever<00:02:07.210> serve<00:02:07.540> a<00:02:07.570> second<00:02:08.050> serve<00:02:08.200> again<00:02:08.530> into<00:02:09.250> the
