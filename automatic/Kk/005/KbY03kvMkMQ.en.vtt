you<00:02:28.250> can<00:02:28.400> also<00:02:28.550> go<00:02:28.820> back<00:02:29.060> to<00:02:29.450> a<00:02:29.480> previous

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
you can also go back to a previous

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:36.640 
you can also go back to a previous
exercise<00:02:32.860> which<00:02:33.860> one<00:02:34.130> is<00:02:34.310> the<00:02:34.460> dog<00:02:35.380> which<00:02:36.380> one

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
exercise which one is the dog which one

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:45.010 
exercise which one is the dog which one
is<00:02:36.860> the<00:02:37.010> dog<00:02:42.880> select<00:02:43.880> the<00:02:44.120> one<00:02:44.270> that's<00:02:44.300> as<00:02:44.870> we

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:45.020 
is the dog select the one that's as we

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:48.430 
is the dog select the one that's as we
flew<00:02:45.230> and<00:02:46.220> if<00:02:46.910> you<00:02:47.060> pick<00:02:47.270> a<00:02:47.300> wrong<00:02:47.600> answer<00:02:48.110> it

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
flew and if you pick a wrong answer it

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.680 
flew and if you pick a wrong answer it
doesn't<00:02:48.890> make<00:02:49.490> you<00:02:49.550> start<00:02:49.940> over<00:02:50.090> anything<00:02:50.570> it

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
doesn't make you start over anything it

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:55.360 
doesn't make you start over anything it
just<00:02:50.720> makes<00:02:51.140> a<00:02:51.320> noise<00:02:52.570> and<00:02:53.920> then<00:02:54.920> you<00:02:54.950> can<00:02:55.190> pick

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
just makes a noise and then you can pick

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:02.020 
just makes a noise and then you can pick
the<00:02:55.489> right<00:02:55.610> one<00:02:58.510> and<00:03:00.100> this<00:03:01.100> is<00:03:01.280> this<00:03:01.730> is<00:03:01.910> an

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
the right one and this is this is an

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.110 
the right one and this is this is an
example<00:03:02.330> of<00:03:02.570> you<00:03:02.870> can<00:03:03.080> have<00:03:03.980> kids<00:03:04.459> select<00:03:04.820> more

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
example of you can have kids select more

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.240 
example of you can have kids select more
than<00:03:05.180> one<00:03:05.390> answer<00:03:05.750> so<00:03:05.989> I<00:03:06.590> have<00:03:06.739> to<00:03:06.890> touch<00:03:07.070> all

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
than one answer so I have to touch all

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:13.479 
than one answer so I have to touch all
of<00:03:07.280> the<00:03:07.459> dogs<00:03:11.770> so<00:03:12.770> now<00:03:13.040> I'm<00:03:13.130> going<00:03:13.220> to<00:03:13.280> show<00:03:13.459> you

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:13.489 
of the dogs so now I'm going to show you

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:16.060 
of the dogs so now I'm going to show you
how<00:03:13.790> you<00:03:13.850> can<00:03:14.180> use<00:03:14.540> the<00:03:14.780> app<00:03:14.900> and<00:03:15.200> create<00:03:15.770> these

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:16.070 
how you can use the app and create these

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:18.039 
how you can use the app and create these
exercises<00:03:16.880> because<00:03:17.120> I<00:03:17.269> think<00:03:17.480> it's<00:03:17.600> good<00:03:17.810> to

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:18.049 
exercises because I think it's good to

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:20.320 
exercises because I think it's good to
know<00:03:18.830> how<00:03:19.010> to<00:03:19.040> use<00:03:19.250> it<00:03:19.459> before<00:03:19.610> you<00:03:19.820> just<00:03:20.150> try

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:20.330 
know how to use it before you just try

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:27.729 
know how to use it before you just try
to<00:03:20.390> go<00:03:20.600> ahead<00:03:20.690> and<00:03:20.989> make<00:03:21.500> different<00:03:21.709> cards<00:03:26.739> so

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:27.739 
to go ahead and make different cards so

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:30.070 
to go ahead and make different cards so
if<00:03:27.890> you<00:03:28.040> start<00:03:28.400> with<00:03:28.700> a<00:03:29.090> new<00:03:29.420> app<00:03:29.600> on<00:03:29.930> the<00:03:30.049> home

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:30.080 
if you start with a new app on the home

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:31.780 
if you start with a new app on the home
page<00:03:30.440> you're<00:03:30.799> gonna<00:03:30.890> want<00:03:31.130> to<00:03:31.190> first<00:03:31.430> go<00:03:31.730> to

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
page you're gonna want to first go to

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:36.400 
page you're gonna want to first go to
libraries<00:03:32.600> and<00:03:34.150> this<00:03:35.150> is<00:03:35.360> these<00:03:35.930> are<00:03:35.989> all<00:03:36.140> of

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.410 
libraries and this is these are all of

you can download it onto your device and
this<00:03:51.650> is<00:03:51.860> also<00:03:52.190> where<00:03:52.580> you<00:03:52.880> can<00:03:52.910> create<00:03:53.450> your

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:53.630 
this is also where you can create your

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:56.050 
this is also where you can create your
own<00:03:53.690> libraries<00:03:54.500> and<00:03:54.799> when<00:03:55.489> if<00:03:55.640> you<00:03:55.760> create

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060 
own libraries and when if you create

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:57.430 
own libraries and when if you create
your<00:03:56.150> own<00:03:56.209> library<00:03:56.750> then<00:03:56.930> you<00:03:57.019> will<00:03:57.170> be<00:03:57.290> able

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:57.440 
your own library then you will be able

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:59.289 
your own library then you will be able
to<00:03:57.680> make<00:03:57.950> your<00:03:58.070> own<00:03:58.250> card<00:03:58.580> so<00:03:58.880> that's<00:03:59.000> what<00:03:59.209> I'm

00:03:59.289 --> 00:03:59.299 
to make your own card so that's what I'm

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:01.150 
to make your own card so that's what I'm
going<00:03:59.510> to<00:03:59.540> do<00:03:59.720> I'm<00:03:59.900> just<00:03:59.930> gonna<00:04:00.170> press<00:04:00.440> new

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:06.320 
library on the top right I'll just leave

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:09.069 
library on the top right I'll just leave
it<00:04:06.350> my<00:04:06.709> cards<00:04:07.160> and<00:04:07.640> you<00:04:08.330> can<00:04:08.510> fill<00:04:08.720> in<00:04:08.870> this

that later but I'm going to hit done so
I've<00:04:19.519> created<00:04:19.790> that<00:04:20.120> library<00:04:20.660> and<00:04:21.049> I'm<00:04:21.229> gonna

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440 
I've created that library and I'm gonna

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:24.310 
I've created that library and I'm gonna
go<00:04:21.650> back<00:04:21.950> to<00:04:22.460> the<00:04:22.610> home<00:04:22.789> page<00:04:22.820> and<00:04:23.330> then<00:04:24.080> from

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:24.320 
go back to the home page and then from

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:27.400 
go back to the home page and then from
there<00:04:24.500> you<00:04:24.710> want<00:04:24.800> to<00:04:24.919> hit<00:04:25.070> lessons

there you want to hit lessons

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:30.920 
there you want to hit lessons
and<00:04:28.410> now<00:04:28.920> you<00:04:29.610> want<00:04:29.760> to<00:04:29.790> make<00:04:29.910> a<00:04:29.970> new<00:04:30.210> lesson<00:04:30.510> by

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:30.930 
and now you want to make a new lesson by

and I'm just gonna put in something
random<00:04:46.760> and<00:04:47.760> you<00:04:48.510> can<00:04:48.690> choose<00:04:48.930> from<00:04:49.260> basic

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.010 
random and you can choose from basic

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:51.710 
random and you can choose from basic
intermediate<00:04:50.280> and<00:04:50.760> advanced<00:04:51.270> or<00:04:51.420> skill<00:04:51.690> level

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:51.720 
intermediate and advanced or skill level

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:53.000 
intermediate and advanced or skill level
so<00:04:52.110> maybe<00:04:52.290> you<00:04:52.380> can<00:04:52.500> have<00:04:52.680> three<00:04:52.980> different

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:53.010 
so maybe you can have three different

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:56.630 
so maybe you can have three different
things<00:04:53.550> on<00:04:53.960> the<00:04:54.960> same<00:04:55.200> topic<00:04:56.160> and<00:04:56.370> just<00:04:56.400> have

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:56.640 
things on the same topic and just have

00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:00.050 
things on the same topic and just have
different<00:04:56.970> difficulty<00:04:57.390> levels<00:04:59.030> pick<00:05:00.030> a

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:00.060 
different difficulty levels pick a

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:06.040 
different difficulty levels pick a
lesson<00:05:00.510> type<00:05:00.800> from<00:05:01.800> these<00:05:02.810> pick<00:05:03.810> a<00:05:03.840> subject

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:06.050 
lesson type from these pick a subject

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:13.550 
lesson type from these pick a subject
then<00:05:07.050> hit<00:05:08.240> hit<00:05:09.240> next<00:05:11.300> so<00:05:12.300> now<00:05:12.630> you're<00:05:13.050> in<00:05:13.200> the

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:13.560 
then hit hit next so now you're in the

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:15.200 
then hit hit next so now you're in the
new<00:05:13.800> lesson<00:05:14.160> that<00:05:14.280> you've<00:05:14.400> created<00:05:14.670> and<00:05:15.120> you

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:15.210 
new lesson that you've created and you

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:17.530 
new lesson that you've created and you
see<00:05:15.420> you're<00:05:15.690> an<00:05:15.810> exercise<00:05:16.320> one<00:05:16.590> over<00:05:16.920> here<00:05:17.190> and

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:17.540 
see you're an exercise one over here and

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:20.390 
see you're an exercise one over here and
you<00:05:18.540> want<00:05:18.720> to<00:05:18.780> add<00:05:18.930> cards<00:05:19.500> to<00:05:19.740> the<00:05:19.830> exercise

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:20.400 
you want to add cards to the exercise

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:23.660 
you want to add cards to the exercise
first<00:05:21.240> before<00:05:21.600> you<00:05:21.810> add<00:05:22.020> more<00:05:22.320> exercises<00:05:22.890> so

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:23.670 
first before you add more exercises so

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:28.900 
first before you add more exercises so
the<00:05:24.330> big<00:05:24.570> text<00:05:25.290> click<00:05:25.830> here<00:05:26.040> to<00:05:26.160> add<00:05:26.280> cards<00:05:27.050> and

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:28.910 
the big text click here to add cards and

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:32.000 
the big text click here to add cards and
you<00:05:29.910> see<00:05:30.060> the<00:05:30.540> in<00:05:30.720> my<00:05:30.900> library<00:05:31.170> these<00:05:31.830> are

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:32.010 
you see the in my library these are

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:34.250 
you see the in my library these are
blank<00:05:32.280> so<00:05:32.790> I'll<00:05:32.880> start<00:05:33.150> with<00:05:33.240> maybe<00:05:33.720> my<00:05:33.930> cards

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:34.260 
blank so I'll start with maybe my cards

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.220 
blank so I'll start with maybe my cards
three<00:05:34.790> you<00:05:35.790> can<00:05:36.000> create<00:05:36.330> your<00:05:36.480> own<00:05:36.540> cards<00:05:37.050> by

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:37.230 
three you can create your own cards by

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:39.890 
three you can create your own cards by
either<00:05:37.410> creating<00:05:37.740> a<00:05:38.010> photo<00:05:38.220> card<00:05:38.580> or<00:05:38.900> creating

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:39.900 
either creating a photo card or creating

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:42.560 
either creating a photo card or creating
a<00:05:39.960> text<00:05:40.290> card<00:05:40.530> the<00:05:41.220> photo<00:05:41.460> card<00:05:41.850> will<00:05:42.240> just

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:42.570 
a text card the photo card will just

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:45.409 
a text card the photo card will just
make<00:05:42.960> pick<00:05:43.500> a<00:05:43.530> photo<00:05:43.860> and<00:05:44.220> only<00:05:44.610> only<00:05:44.970> images

00:05:45.409 --> 00:05:45.419 
make pick a photo and only only images

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:47.780 
make pick a photo and only only images
but<00:05:46.020> the<00:05:46.169> text<00:05:46.410> card<00:05:46.620> will<00:05:46.770> be<00:05:46.890> only<00:05:47.190> text<00:05:47.580> so

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:47.790 
but the text card will be only text so

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:49.880 
but the text card will be only text so
if<00:05:47.970> you<00:05:48.090> choose<00:05:48.330> that<00:05:48.390> then<00:05:49.200> you<00:05:49.470> type<00:05:49.740> in

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:49.890 
if you choose that then you type in

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:51.440 
if you choose that then you type in
whatever<00:05:50.100> you<00:05:50.310> want<00:05:50.370> to<00:05:50.669> show<00:05:50.880> up<00:05:50.970> on<00:05:51.120> the<00:05:51.210> card

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:51.450 
whatever you want to show up on the card

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:54.250 
whatever you want to show up on the card
and<00:05:51.780> then<00:05:52.140> that'll<00:05:52.410> show<00:05:52.590> up<00:05:52.740> in<00:05:52.980> the<00:05:53.070> box<00:05:53.250> and

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:54.260 
and then that'll show up in the box and

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.140 
and then that'll show up in the box and
let's<00:05:55.260> just<00:05:55.530> make<00:05:55.710> a<00:05:55.740> photo<00:05:56.040> card<00:05:56.430> select<00:05:56.970> from

00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:57.150 
let's just make a photo card select from

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:03.620 
let's just make a photo card select from
libraries<00:06:00.380> maybe<00:06:01.380> starburst<00:06:01.980> and<00:06:02.390> then<00:06:03.390> once

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:03.630 
libraries maybe starburst and then once

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:05.360 
libraries maybe starburst and then once
you<00:06:03.810> once<00:06:04.110> you<00:06:04.230> have<00:06:04.470> all<00:06:04.620> the<00:06:04.740> cards<00:06:05.070> that<00:06:05.190> you

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:05.370 
you once you have all the cards that you

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:08.150 
you once you have all the cards that you
want<00:06:05.610> in<00:06:05.850> your<00:06:06.150> card<00:06:06.600> section<00:06:06.919> you<00:06:07.919> want<00:06:08.070> to

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:08.160 
want in your card section you want to

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:11.630 
want in your card section you want to
take<00:06:08.370> that<00:06:08.810> hold<00:06:09.810> it<00:06:10.020> tap<00:06:10.740> and<00:06:10.950> hold<00:06:10.980> and<00:06:11.340> then

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:11.640 
take that hold it tap and hold and then

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:14.690 
take that hold it tap and hold and then
drag<00:06:11.700> it<00:06:12.210> to<00:06:12.660> the<00:06:12.690> white<00:06:12.930> box<00:06:13.140> and<00:06:13.530> maybe<00:06:14.520> I'll

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:14.700 
drag it to the white box and maybe I'll

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:20.680 
drag it to the white box and maybe I'll
do<00:06:14.820> another<00:06:14.850> one<00:06:15.300> create<00:06:15.720> a<00:06:15.780> text<00:06:16.169> card<00:06:17.180> dog

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:20.690 

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:26.190 

and<00:06:21.690> drag<00:06:22.050> that<00:06:22.080> here<00:06:24.200> and<00:06:25.200> then<00:06:25.770> you'll<00:06:25.950> see

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:26.200 
and drag that here and then you'll see

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:28.320 
and drag that here and then you'll see
that's<00:06:26.350> what<00:06:26.590> they<00:06:26.710> are<00:06:27.040> choosing<00:06:27.610> from<00:06:27.910> when

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:28.330 
that's what they are choosing from when

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:30.600 
that's what they are choosing from when
they're<00:06:28.570> using<00:06:29.200> the<00:06:29.320> app<00:06:29.440> and<00:06:29.770> then<00:06:30.250> up<00:06:30.400> top

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:30.610 
they're using the app and then up top

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:34.650 
they're using the app and then up top
here<00:06:30.880> the<00:06:31.450> prompt<00:06:31.870> you<00:06:32.770> if<00:06:33.070> you<00:06:33.910> record<00:06:34.330> it<00:06:34.450> you

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:34.660 
here the prompt you if you record it you

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:37.230 
here the prompt you if you record it you
have<00:06:34.840> to<00:06:35.020> say<00:06:35.230> touch<00:06:35.680> the<00:06:36.100> object<00:06:36.700> whatever

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:37.240 
have to say touch the object whatever

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:39.210 
have to say touch the object whatever
they're<00:06:37.750> touching<00:06:38.140> and<00:06:38.290> if<00:06:38.770> you're<00:06:38.920> just

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:39.220 
they're touching and if you're just

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:40.860 
they're touching and if you're just
going<00:06:39.340> to<00:06:39.430> use<00:06:39.640> the<00:06:39.910> synthesized<00:06:40.390> voice<00:06:40.630> you

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:40.870 
going to use the synthesized voice you

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:43.200 
going to use the synthesized voice you
just<00:06:41.050> type<00:06:41.260> it<00:06:41.440> in<00:06:41.560> here<00:06:41.730> so<00:06:42.730> I<00:06:42.760> could<00:06:43.090> say

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:43.210 
just type it in here so I could say

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:48.630 
just type it in here so I could say
touch<00:06:43.480> the<00:06:43.690> Dalek<00:06:43.990> and<00:06:46.650> then<00:06:47.650> I<00:06:47.980> would<00:06:48.310> be<00:06:48.490> done

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:48.640 
touch the Dalek and then I would be done

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:50.070 
touch the Dalek and then I would be done
with<00:06:48.700> this<00:06:48.940> lesson<00:06:49.120> I<00:06:49.390> could<00:06:49.540> hit<00:06:49.690> done<00:06:49.900> and

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:50.080 
with this lesson I could hit done and

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:52.800 
with this lesson I could hit done and
that's<00:06:51.070> one<00:06:51.310> exercise<00:06:51.790> you've<00:06:52.150> created<00:06:52.390> and

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:52.810 
that's one exercise you've created and

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:54.270 
that's one exercise you've created and
you<00:06:52.900> can<00:06:53.080> go<00:06:53.230> and<00:06:53.410> create<00:06:53.500> multiple<00:06:53.890> exercises

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:54.280 
you can go and create multiple exercises

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:57.210 
you can go and create multiple exercises
so<00:06:54.880> that<00:06:54.910> you<00:06:55.090> can<00:06:55.330> have<00:06:55.540> things<00:06:56.500> like<00:06:56.710> the<00:06:57.010> dog

00:06:57.210 --> 00:06:57.220 
so that you can have things like the dog

00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:59.550 
so that you can have things like the dog
shown<00:06:57.580> here<00:06:57.850> and<00:06:58.090> one<00:06:58.900> last<00:06:59.050> thing<00:06:59.200> I<00:06:59.350> want<00:06:59.530> to

00:06:59.550 --> 00:06:59.560 
shown here and one last thing I want to

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:03.240 
shown here and one last thing I want to
