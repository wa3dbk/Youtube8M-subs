stay tuned for that but let's get into
talking<00:00:32.250> about<00:00:32.460> the<00:00:32.669> NA<00:00:32.910> 45<00:00:33.329> so<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.570> way<00:00:33.660> the

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
talking about the NA 45 so the way the

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.600 
talking about the NA 45 so the way the
NA<00:00:34.020> 45<00:00:34.469> works<00:00:34.770> is<00:00:34.950> basically<00:00:35.250> the<00:00:35.460> first

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
NA 45 works is basically the first

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.700 
NA 45 works is basically the first
bullet<00:00:35.910> you<00:00:36.030> shoot<00:00:36.210> out<00:00:36.300> of<00:00:36.360> your<00:00:36.540> gun<00:00:36.719> is<00:00:37.050> that

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
bullet you shoot out of your gun is that

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.590 
bullet you shoot out of your gun is that
explosive<00:00:38.129> the<00:00:38.489> second<00:00:38.910> bullet<00:00:39.090> you<00:00:39.420> shoot

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
explosive the second bullet you shoot

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.479 
explosive the second bullet you shoot
out<00:00:39.690> of<00:00:39.750> your<00:00:39.899> gun<00:00:40.020> triggers<00:00:40.829> that<00:00:41.010> explosive

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
out of your gun triggers that explosive

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.549 
out of your gun triggers that explosive
so<00:00:41.790> let's<00:00:41.969> go<00:00:42.090> ahead<00:00:42.329> and<00:00:42.570> look<00:00:42.870> at<00:00:43.110> the

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
so let's go ahead and look at the

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.310 
so let's go ahead and look at the
in-game<00:00:44.430> stats<00:00:44.879> so<00:00:45.149> as<00:00:45.270> far<00:00:45.510> as<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:45.960> in-game

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
in-game stats so as far as the in-game

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.490 
in-game stats so as far as the in-game
stats<00:00:46.590> go<00:00:46.890> they<00:00:47.460> go<00:00:47.640> as<00:00:47.879> follows<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:49.110> damage

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
stats go they go as follows the damage

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.279 
stats go they go as follows the damage
is<00:00:49.649> 15<00:00:50.160> accuracy<00:00:50.940> is<00:00:51.059> nine<00:00:51.270> fire<00:00:51.719> rate<00:00:51.930> is<00:00:51.960> nine

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
is 15 accuracy is nine fire rate is nine

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.069 
is 15 accuracy is nine fire rate is nine
range<00:00:52.829> is<00:00:53.070> fourteen<00:00:53.640> handling<00:00:54.300> is<00:00:54.480> five<00:00:54.780> and

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
range is fourteen handling is five and

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.799 
range is fourteen handling is five and
mobility<00:00:55.469> is<00:00:55.980> eight<00:00:56.520> so<00:00:57.180> as<00:00:57.329> we<00:00:57.480> know<00:00:57.600> these

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
mobility is eight so as we know these

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.569 
mobility is eight so as we know these
stats<00:00:58.079> mean<00:00:58.320> absolutely<00:00:58.829> nothing<00:00:58.920> but<00:00:59.280> before

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
stats mean absolutely nothing but before

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.010 
stats mean absolutely nothing but before
we<00:00:59.699> get<00:00:59.789> into<00:01:00.059> talking<00:01:00.210> about<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.570> stats<00:01:00.809> I

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
we get into talking about the stats I

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.990 
we get into talking about the stats I
think<00:01:01.320> we<00:01:01.500> need<00:01:01.710> to<00:01:01.859> talk<00:01:02.039> about<00:01:02.250> how<00:01:02.550> this<00:01:02.789> gun

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
think we need to talk about how this gun

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.270 
think we need to talk about how this gun
works<00:01:03.210> so<00:01:03.390> as<00:01:03.420> I<00:01:03.690> said<00:01:03.899> first<00:01:04.530> bullet<00:01:04.890> you<00:01:04.979> fire

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
works so as I said first bullet you fire

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.190 
works so as I said first bullet you fire
is<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.850> explosive<00:01:06.180> second<00:01:06.780> bullet<00:01:06.960> is<00:01:07.140> the

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
is the explosive second bullet is the

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.690 
is the explosive second bullet is the
one<00:01:07.560> that<00:01:07.680> makes<00:01:07.890> it<00:01:08.040> explode<00:01:08.310> so<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:08.610> way

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
one that makes it explode so the way

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.330 
one that makes it explode so the way
this<00:01:08.880> works<00:01:09.180> is<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:10.049> second<00:01:10.710> bullet<00:01:11.220> you

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
this works is the second bullet you

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.850 
this works is the second bullet you
shoot<00:01:11.729> has<00:01:12.270> to<00:01:12.540> hit<00:01:12.810> a<00:01:12.840> target<00:01:13.290> in<00:01:13.560> a<00:01:13.650> specific

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
shoot has to hit a target in a specific

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.710 
shoot has to hit a target in a specific
range<00:01:14.310> and<00:01:14.520> that<00:01:14.549> range<00:01:14.909> is<00:01:15.090> on<00:01:15.270> your<00:01:15.450> screen

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
range and that range is on your screen

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.170 
range and that range is on your screen
right<00:01:16.080> now<00:01:16.110> so<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.530> first<00:01:16.710> shot<00:01:17.070> I<00:01:17.310> fire<00:01:17.790> here

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
right now so the first shot I fire here

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.330 
right now so the first shot I fire here
is<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:18.750> maximum<00:01:19.290> range<00:01:19.590> where<00:01:19.860> it<00:01:20.009> doesn't

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
is the maximum range where it doesn't

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.820 
is the maximum range where it doesn't
explode<00:01:21.030> everything<00:01:21.780> else<00:01:22.080> inside<00:01:22.590> that

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
explode everything else inside that

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.649 
explode everything else inside that
range<00:01:23.040> so<00:01:23.100> that<00:01:23.189> kind<00:01:23.549> of<00:01:23.640> plant<00:01:24.000> above<00:01:24.420> the

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
range so that kind of plant above the

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.929 
range so that kind of plant above the
shot<00:01:24.930> I<00:01:25.110> shoot<00:01:25.320> is<00:01:25.470> like<00:01:26.009> the<00:01:26.189> maximum<00:01:26.549> range

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
shot I shoot is like the maximum range

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.319 
shot I shoot is like the maximum range
that<00:01:27.270> you<00:01:27.680> can't<00:01:28.680> explode<00:01:29.220> anything<00:01:29.909> inside

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
that you can't explode anything inside

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.960 
that you can't explode anything inside
that<00:01:30.390> range<00:01:30.869> it<00:01:31.409> that<00:01:31.860> first<00:01:32.340> bullet<00:01:32.729> you

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
that range it that first bullet you

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.510 
that range it that first bullet you
shoot<00:01:33.240> will<00:01:33.600> explode<00:01:34.259> now<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:35.130> thing<00:01:35.369> with

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
shoot will explode now the thing with

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.550 
shoot will explode now the thing with
this<00:01:35.700> is<00:01:35.759> you<00:01:36.030> have<00:01:36.060> to<00:01:36.390> imagine<00:01:36.689> that<00:01:36.990> range

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
this is you have to imagine that range

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.880 
this is you have to imagine that range
in<00:01:38.240> 360<00:01:39.240> degrees<00:01:39.570> so<00:01:39.600> for<00:01:39.960> example<00:01:40.380> if<00:01:40.560> your

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
in 360 degrees so for example if your

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.770 
in 360 degrees so for example if your
first<00:01:41.130> bullet<00:01:41.490> goes<00:01:41.759> into<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.299> person<00:01:42.659> you're

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
first bullet goes into the person you're

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.929 
first bullet goes into the person you're
shooting<00:01:43.049> at<00:01:43.170> and<00:01:43.380> you're<00:01:43.860> you<00:01:44.130> miss<00:01:44.729> your

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
shooting at and you're you miss your

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.670 
shooting at and you're you miss your
second<00:01:45.329> bullet<00:01:45.479> it<00:01:45.659> lands<00:01:46.170> on<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.350> ground

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
second bullet it lands on the ground

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.100 
second bullet it lands on the ground
further<00:01:47.250> from<00:01:47.670> them<00:01:47.939> it<00:01:48.119> probably<00:01:48.720> won't

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
further from them it probably won't

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.530 
further from them it probably won't
explode<00:01:49.680> because<00:01:49.920> it<00:01:50.189> won't<00:01:50.490> be<00:01:50.610> within<00:01:51.240> that

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
explode because it won't be within that

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.749 
explode because it won't be within that
range<00:01:51.840> if<00:01:52.079> that<00:01:52.259> makes<00:01:52.470> any<00:01:52.680> sense<00:01:52.770> at<00:01:53.189> all

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
range if that makes any sense at all

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.420 
range if that makes any sense at all
now<00:01:54.390> this<00:01:54.750> is<00:01:54.899> super<00:01:55.439> super<00:01:55.590> very<00:01:55.950> important

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
now this is super super very important

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.399 
now this is super super very important
to<00:01:56.490> note<00:01:56.700> because<00:01:56.880> what<00:01:57.360> when<00:01:57.659> using<00:01:57.960> this<00:01:58.200> gun

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
to note because what when using this gun

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.410 
to note because what when using this gun
you<00:01:58.560> actually<00:01:59.100> don't<00:01:59.549> want<00:01:59.880> your<00:02:00.090> first

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
you actually don't want your first

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.480 
you actually don't want your first
bullet<00:02:00.840> to<00:02:00.990> hit<00:02:01.200> your<00:02:01.350> target<00:02:01.380> reason<00:02:02.070> being<00:02:02.250> a

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
bullet to hit your target reason being a

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.990 
bullet to hit your target reason being a
human<00:02:03.299> is<00:02:03.509> a<00:02:03.540> lot<00:02:03.869> more<00:02:04.229> hard<00:02:04.560> to<00:02:04.740> hit<00:02:04.979> than<00:02:05.729> the

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
human is a lot more hard to hit than the

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.850 
human is a lot more hard to hit than the
ground<00:02:06.270> or<00:02:06.570> below<00:02:06.840> them<00:02:07.049> so<00:02:07.259> basically<00:02:07.500> the

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
ground or below them so basically the

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:08.900 
ground or below them so basically the
way<00:02:07.979> you<00:02:08.039> want<00:02:08.250> to<00:02:08.280> play<00:02:08.369> with<00:02:08.520> this<00:02:08.640> gun<00:02:08.789> is

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
way you want to play with this gun is

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.580 
way you want to play with this gun is
shoot<00:02:09.179> the<00:02:09.209> ground<00:02:09.599> below<00:02:09.780> them<00:02:10.050> and<00:02:10.170> then

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
shoot the ground below them and then

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.350 
shoot the ground below them and then
shoot<00:02:10.860> the<00:02:11.009> exact<00:02:11.370> same<00:02:11.580> spot<00:02:11.970> with<00:02:12.209> your

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
shoot the exact same spot with your

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.030 
shoot the exact same spot with your
second<00:02:12.750> bullet<00:02:12.930> below

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
second bullet below

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.980 
second bullet below
the<00:02:14.190> explosive<00:02:14.940> radius<00:02:15.390> with<00:02:15.570> this<00:02:15.720> gun<00:02:15.870> is

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
the explosive radius with this gun is

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.840 
the explosive radius with this gun is
pretty<00:02:16.290> good<00:02:16.590> but<00:02:17.070> you're<00:02:17.220> definitely<00:02:17.370> gonna

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
pretty good but you're definitely gonna

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:20.270 
pretty good but you're definitely gonna
want<00:02:18.180> to<00:02:18.270> use<00:02:18.390> danger-close<00:02:18.930> now<00:02:19.500> as<00:02:19.980> far<00:02:20.220> as

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
want to use danger-close now as far as

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.580 
want to use danger-close now as far as
stats<00:02:20.730> go<00:02:21.000> for<00:02:21.240> this<00:02:21.330> thing<00:02:21.390> the<00:02:21.990> damage<00:02:22.440> is

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
stats go for this thing the damage is

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.470 
stats go for this thing the damage is
absolutely<00:02:23.430> not<00:02:23.610> important<00:02:24.120> because<00:02:24.210> of<00:02:24.420> the

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
absolutely not important because of the

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.630 
absolutely not important because of the
bullet<00:02:24.810> itself<00:02:25.110> does<00:02:25.350> 30<00:02:25.590> damage<00:02:25.740> which<00:02:26.190> means

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
bullet itself does 30 damage which means

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.280 
bullet itself does 30 damage which means
you're<00:02:26.790> going<00:02:27.000> to<00:02:27.090> have<00:02:27.270> to<00:02:27.390> hit<00:02:27.510> four<00:02:27.870> bullets

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
you're going to have to hit four bullets

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.080 
you're going to have to hit four bullets
with<00:02:28.470> this<00:02:28.650> too<00:02:29.220> for<00:02:29.370> it<00:02:29.490> to<00:02:29.580> actually<00:02:29.940> kill

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
with this too for it to actually kill

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.490 
with this too for it to actually kill
someone<00:02:30.510> which<00:02:30.630> is<00:02:30.660> never<00:02:30.960> gonna<00:02:31.080> happen<00:02:31.260> you

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
someone which is never gonna happen you

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.140 
someone which is never gonna happen you
all<00:02:31.740> you<00:02:31.890> need<00:02:32.070> to<00:02:32.160> know<00:02:32.310> is<00:02:32.520> that<00:02:32.970> the

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
all you need to know is that the

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.460 
all you need to know is that the
explosive<00:02:33.900> is<00:02:34.080> what<00:02:34.380> kills<00:02:34.770> them<00:02:35.270> so<00:02:36.270> on<00:02:36.660> top

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
explosive is what kills them so on top

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.130 
explosive is what kills them so on top
of<00:02:37.650> this<00:02:37.950> some<00:02:38.460> other<00:02:38.670> important<00:02:39.540> facts<00:02:39.870> are

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
of this some other important facts are

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.440 
of this some other important facts are
first<00:02:40.500> of<00:02:40.650> all<00:02:40.770> the<00:02:41.400> fire<00:02:41.670> rate<00:02:41.940> so<00:02:42.090> the<00:02:42.210> fire

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
first of all the fire rate so the fire

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.650 
first of all the fire rate so the fire
rate<00:02:42.690> changes<00:02:43.200> very<00:02:43.470> very<00:02:43.700> drastically<00:02:44.700> with

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
rate changes very very drastically with

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.960 
rate changes very very drastically with
the<00:02:45.900> different<00:02:46.320> variants<00:02:46.860> but<00:02:47.310> the<00:02:47.430> fire<00:02:47.700> rate

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
the different variants but the fire rate

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.820 
the different variants but the fire rate
really<00:02:48.570> doesn't<00:02:48.960> matter<00:02:49.050> whatsoever<00:02:49.440> so<00:02:49.710> the

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
really doesn't matter whatsoever so the

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.850 
really doesn't matter whatsoever so the
fire<00:02:49.980> rate<00:02:50.190> is<00:02:50.300> 750<00:02:51.300> but<00:02:51.990> the<00:02:52.230> important<00:02:52.710> part

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
fire rate is 750 but the important part

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.770 
fire rate is 750 but the important part
isn't<00:02:53.250> the<00:02:53.340> fire<00:02:53.550> rate<00:02:53.760> it<00:02:53.880> is<00:02:54.030> your<00:02:54.210> accuracy

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
isn't the fire rate it is your accuracy

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.390 
isn't the fire rate it is your accuracy
with<00:02:54.900> this<00:02:55.020> gun<00:02:55.200> and<00:02:55.380> keeping<00:02:55.770> the<00:02:55.890> two<00:02:56.100> shots

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
with this gun and keeping the two shots

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.640 
with this gun and keeping the two shots
very<00:02:56.580> very<00:02:57.030> close<00:02:57.330> together<00:02:57.570> now<00:02:58.290> the<00:02:58.350> most

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
very very close together now the most

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.380 
very very close together now the most
important<00:02:59.280> tip<00:02:59.460> I<00:02:59.580> can<00:02:59.640> give<00:02:59.910> you<00:03:00.000> with<00:03:00.240> this

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
important tip I can give you with this

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.450 
important tip I can give you with this
gun<00:03:00.630> is<00:03:01.260> first<00:03:01.650> of<00:03:01.770> all<00:03:01.800> if<00:03:01.980> you<00:03:02.070> have<00:03:02.250> the

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:02.460 
gun is first of all if you have the

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:04.610 
gun is first of all if you have the
ravager<00:03:02.910> use<00:03:03.240> the<00:03:03.510> goddamn<00:03:03.960> ravager<00:03:04.500> the

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
ravager use the goddamn ravager the

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.080 
ravager use the goddamn ravager the
Ravager<00:03:05.070> is<00:03:05.100> so<00:03:05.670> good

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
Ravager is so good

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:07.940 
Ravager is so good
basically<00:03:06.570> what<00:03:06.810> it<00:03:06.930> does<00:03:06.960> is<00:03:07.320> it<00:03:07.440> almost

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
basically what it does is it almost

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.000 
basically what it does is it almost
doubles<00:03:08.730> the<00:03:08.940> explosive<00:03:09.570> range<00:03:09.810> for<00:03:10.560> that<00:03:10.800> you

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
doubles the explosive range for that you

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.040 
doubles the explosive range for that you
can<00:03:11.190> kill<00:03:11.430> someone<00:03:11.670> with<00:03:11.760> this<00:03:11.970> gun<00:03:12.180> so<00:03:12.480> it

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
can kill someone with this gun so it

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.140 
can kill someone with this gun so it
takes<00:03:13.290> the<00:03:13.470> normal<00:03:13.740> gun<00:03:13.920> and<00:03:14.130> doubles<00:03:14.820> it<00:03:14.940> it's
