00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.210
 world football in every corner has 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.790
 a field to class beating ball dribble 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.740
 giving soft round is more not always 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.440
 The ball is round just as it is speaking. 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.750
 It's Pedro through the world is not enough. 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.029
 framed can save himself in the 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.490
 Strange, I'm talking about Brazil, you saw it. 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.830
 The ball is only the ball in American football. 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.650
 in North America, far from people 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.930
 You're wrong, America will be here. 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:31.369
 It gives only a look at this class now than 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:38.730
 our soccer even in the field 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:41.129
 I was little, no, you do not see 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.180
 from an American movie by the 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.600
 less for now 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:50.870
 this is the training of the savior to the 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.870
 or the savior of all the saints 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:57.030
 the Bahian football team is 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.920
 participating in the 1st Brazilian Championship 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.809
 The history of this sport 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.420
 some analyzed the others think that 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.339
 by size really is what I should 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.830
 I already played basketball michael me 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.140
 I really found the movie Maria 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.360
 the stadium is the armando oliveira in 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.260
 bed and breakfast a field is our football 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.030
 same 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.310
 but before they are the owners of 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:21.830
 Ball is to wait for the good old 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:25.790
 end of the afternoon beard now end our 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.790
 back is my father and 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:32.750
 the team began to be assembled four 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:35.510
 through social networks 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.550
 today there are 60 players who have always 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:38.630
 getting more people are people entering 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.240
 because you like 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.790
 Then the friend was silly, there we go. 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:46.610
 watching American will see play but 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:48.830
 to play football you need 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.330
 keep up with English also walked 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.250
 When you call to make a 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:54.110
 talk to organize plays 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:58.340
 the playbook is just the book with the 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:02:00.170
 plays that koff that initial shot 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:05.110
 the inep is the step back in my 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:05.110
 rank of 60 plays move 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:11.660
 Some say it is a means of sport 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:14.000
 crazy crazy through the body has many 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:16.280
 impact scenes but everything is 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.740
 it's usually planned you see the guy 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:28.760
 trying to pass and you will try not to 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:31.790
 letting the sport pass requires a lot of 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:34.850
 strength but has speed is also 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:37.360
 is essential for the savior or feels 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:39.380
 has room for big villains 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.390
 snacks have to take advantage of 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:44.000
 Agility is not less so you have to 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:46.070
 enjoy the body dribble even more 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.310
 if the body dribble does not work 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:52.870
 important it is even well equipped for 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:55.940
 take the hit boot stocking 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:58.989
 protective side shields for 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:04.330
 chest to shoulder plus of course 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:04.330
 mouthguard helmet 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:11.050
 but all this equipment is not 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:13.090
 full uniform not coming out 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:16.000
 for less than one thousand reais 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:18.160
 all banked by the athletes themselves 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.680
 another problem is that as sport is still 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.840
 it 's not popular around here it gets difficult 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:25.030
 evaluate the technical level of the team 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.220
 the other teams from the south, we're going 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:30.970
 reach them are far ahead of 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:32.560
 people they started a lot but it's a 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:35.470
 vain are much older 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:37.570
 the inspiration to improve the game the 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:39.940
 call boys will look at the 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:43.660
 American professional league teams and 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:47.680
 Of course in cinema, Luis is also Machado. 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:50.440
 offensive, his function is to protect the 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:53.080
 coremec the main articulator of 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:56.080
 The team's attack is the same as 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:57.970
 big mike north american player 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:59.700
 had his story told in the movie A 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:03.190
 possible dream 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:05.020
 he is much more than the fine pictures 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:07.240
 greater than love much greater than the 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:09.700
 My, but I'm inspired by him, grandson. 

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:14.320
 empty fagundes I'm always in doubt the 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:16.780
 he playing to try to look alike right? 

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:20.260
 but here the player the team they think 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:22.000
 I will play my role if the team 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:24.100
 will play a good role in the 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.320
 national championship we will only know 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:29.800
 more ahead but the beginning was 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:34.240
 promising the savior to those who won 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:37.180
 sergipe bravos in the debut the 18 to 7 and is 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:39.310
 one of the highlights of the Northeast conference 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:41.560
 but more than wins what they 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:44.350
 want to contribute to the popularization 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:47.680
 football in brazil and american football 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:49.660
 clear to decide not to be a sport 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:51.100
 popular but it is a different sport that 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:51.910
 attracts the attention and curiosity of 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:53.410
 people 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:55.660
 6 for recognition only for the pleasure of 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:59.230
 play and pleasure of those who know from now 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:02.370
 some years to be recognized for having 

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:02.370
 so much strength
