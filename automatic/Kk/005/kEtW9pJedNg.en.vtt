00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:05.250
 hello in this video I want you 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:08.280
 show you how to best one 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.290
 laminate floor mixes clean and cares 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:15.049
 Of course we need one for that 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:19.590
 mop a bucket of detergent and 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:24.090
 my secret recipe is something yes cream bad 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:26.730
 I first have bath oil first 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.449
 put some water in the pail rhine 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.260
 given 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:33.840
 about half of the buffer to it 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.969
 then comes now something cleaning agent 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.399
 I give almost every one of those 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.649
 Cleaning agent always has the cards with what 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.460
 you can measure the cleaning agent from good 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:47.250
 I now live on it two caps 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:49.100
 Cleaning agent in the water what you suspect it 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:53.430
 not and does not matter 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:54.870
 So there are very different that 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.239
 actually does not matter 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.629
 And last but not least, I'll give you one now 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.789
 good shot bath oil to do that now 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:06.320
 not diverse it came some 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.320
 be another couple 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:13.770
 it's about a shot glass now 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:21.780
 sunday the whole thing now stirs once 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:24.119
 by hand and with that I will 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:28.220
 right now my laminate clean 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:30.810
 The whole thing has the side effect that one 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.939
 yes so clear cleaning agent it first 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.220
 to get the bacteria all right 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:38.070
 from the floor can wipe and the bathroom 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.409
 the oil the folding cream as well 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:44.369
 always that is there that one the 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:46.590
 laminate flooring for gleaming brings on so 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.540
 tile pvc I think that works 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.369
 I do not know that I can now 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.130
 still talking about the laminate floor 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:55.490
 there you have the effect that the 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.159
 laminate floor really through the bath oil 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:00.810
 starts to shine and the dull ones 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:01.850
 Tops brought to shine 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.950
 become 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:06.619
 is a little secret from me 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.270
 Maybe he 'll try that out 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:10.750

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:10.750
