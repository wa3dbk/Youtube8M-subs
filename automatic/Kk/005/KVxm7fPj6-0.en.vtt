hundred<00:05:32.400> thousand<00:05:33.349> or<00:05:34.349> so<00:05:34.740> you<00:05:35.460> know<00:05:35.580> after

00:05:35.959 --> 00:05:35.969 
hundred thousand or so you know after

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:37.189 
hundred thousand or so you know after
the<00:05:36.060> motor<00:05:36.270> was<00:05:36.479> balanced<00:05:36.990> and<00:05:37.139> blueprinted

00:05:37.189 --> 00:05:37.199 
the motor was balanced and blueprinted

00:05:37.199 --> 00:05:40.129 
the motor was balanced and blueprinted
most<00:05:37.800> of<00:05:37.979> the<00:05:38.069> miles<00:05:38.460> were<00:05:39.449> in<00:05:39.569> the<00:05:39.659> first<00:05:39.870> ten

00:05:40.129 --> 00:05:40.139 
most of the miles were in the first ten

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:41.659 
most of the miles were in the first ten
years<00:05:40.169> of<00:05:40.500> the<00:05:40.740> engine<00:05:41.069> before<00:05:41.219> it<00:05:41.550> was

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:41.669 
years of the engine before it was

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:47.119 
years of the engine before it was
balanced<00:05:42.210> and<00:05:42.360> blueprinted<00:05:45.289> so<00:05:46.289> original

00:05:47.119 --> 00:05:47.129 
balanced and blueprinted so original

00:05:47.129 --> 00:05:50.929

00:05:50.929 --> 00:05:50.939 
tilt steering as well the AC I fired it

00:05:50.939 --> 00:05:54.529 
tilt steering as well the AC I fired it
up<00:05:51.090> it<00:05:51.419> kind<00:05:51.719> of<00:05:51.840> blows<00:05:52.020> kulish<00:05:52.530> air<00:05:52.740> but<00:05:53.639> it

00:05:54.529 --> 00:05:54.539 
up it kind of blows kulish air but it

00:05:54.539 --> 00:05:57.320 
up it kind of blows kulish air but it
doesn't<00:05:55.199> seem<00:05:55.379> to<00:05:55.560> be<00:05:55.710> you<00:05:56.069> know<00:05:56.190> working<00:05:56.639> but

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:57.330 
doesn't seem to be you know working but

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:59.779 
doesn't seem to be you know working but
it<00:05:57.419> does<00:05:57.599> have<00:05:57.780> AC<00:05:58.020> in<00:05:58.889> it<00:05:59.159> which<00:05:59.370> can<00:05:59.400> be

00:05:59.779 --> 00:05:59.789 
it does have AC in it which can be

00:05:59.789 --> 00:06:02.029 
it does have AC in it which can be
recharged<00:06:00.360> I'll<00:06:00.930> also<00:06:01.169> show<00:06:01.530> you<00:06:01.560> it's<00:06:01.800> got<00:06:01.949> an

00:06:07.999 --> 00:06:08.009 
down on the bottom and we'll look at

00:06:08.009 --> 00:06:10.309 
down on the bottom and we'll look at
that<00:06:08.219> when<00:06:08.550> the<00:06:08.849> when<00:06:09.539> we<00:06:09.629> have<00:06:09.659> it<00:06:09.900> fired<00:06:10.139> up

00:06:10.309 --> 00:06:10.319 
that when the when we have it fired up

00:06:10.319 --> 00:06:14.350 
that when the when we have it fired up
it's<00:06:10.680> reading<00:06:11.180> it's<00:06:12.180> reading<00:06:12.360> up<00:06:12.659> into<00:06:12.960> 80<00:06:13.289> psi

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:14.360 
it's reading it's reading up into 80 psi

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:17.269 
it's reading it's reading up into 80 psi
the<00:06:15.360> when<00:06:16.020> the<00:06:16.169> engine<00:06:16.680> was<00:06:16.710> balanced<00:06:17.129> and

00:06:17.269 --> 00:06:17.279 
the when the engine was balanced and

00:06:17.279 --> 00:06:20.749 
the when the engine was balanced and
blueprinted<00:06:17.370> the<00:06:17.969> the<00:06:18.509> owner<00:06:18.750> put<00:06:19.050> a<00:06:19.759> stronger

00:06:20.749 --> 00:06:20.759 
blueprinted the the owner put a stronger

blueprinted the the owner put a stronger
oil<00:06:21.000> pump<00:06:21.659> on<00:06:21.840> it<00:06:21.990> so<00:06:22.229> it<00:06:23.069> gets<00:06:23.430> really<00:06:23.580> nice

00:06:23.869 --> 00:06:23.879 
oil pump on it so it gets really nice
