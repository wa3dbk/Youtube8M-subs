00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
for example for another kind of building

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.130 
for example for another kind of building
or<00:00:22.890> structure<00:00:23.130> on<00:00:23.369> my<00:00:23.490> server<00:00:23.699> just<00:00:24.539> ask<00:00:24.869> me

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
or structure on my server just ask me

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
building this tower isn't really hard

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.770 
building this tower isn't really hard
and<00:00:30.510> I<00:00:31.410> will<00:00:31.619> explain<00:00:31.980> it<00:00:32.130> in<00:00:32.219> some<00:00:32.460> easy<00:00:33.239> steps

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:36.850 
the first thing you want to do is to

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.049 
the first thing you want to do is to
create<00:00:36.969> this<00:00:37.239> kind<00:00:37.480> of<00:00:37.660> layer<00:00:38.489> you<00:00:39.489> see<00:00:39.519> here

00:00:40.049 --> 00:00:40.059 
create this kind of layer you see here

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:42.389 
create this kind of layer you see here
we've<00:00:40.239> got<00:00:40.449> a<00:00:40.839> block<00:00:41.350> of<00:00:41.530> logs<00:00:41.920> every<00:00:42.309> other

00:00:42.389 --> 00:00:42.399 
we've got a block of logs every other

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:47.420 
we've got a block of logs every other
block<00:00:42.699> with<00:00:43.140> cobblestone<00:00:44.140> in<00:00:44.500> between

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.930 

we<00:00:48.090> will<00:00:48.300> go<00:00:48.590> seven<00:00:49.590> blocks<00:00:49.800> up<00:00:50.130> so<00:00:50.610> we've<00:00:50.760> got

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
we will go seven blocks up so we've got

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:58.970 
we will go seven blocks up so we've got
a<00:00:50.970> total<00:00:51.240> of<00:00:51.630> yeah<00:00:52.610> eight<00:00:53.610> blocks

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.940 

like<00:00:59.280> this<00:00:59.520> and<00:00:59.850> we<00:01:00.480> will<00:01:00.630> do<00:01:00.900> the<00:01:01.050> same<00:01:01.350> with

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:01.950 
like this and we will do the same with

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:04.380 
like this and we will do the same with
all<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.280> other<00:01:02.460> locks

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:04.390 
all the other locks

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:06.540 
all the other locks
and<00:01:04.840> indianature<00:01:05.290> look<00:01:05.950> something<00:01:06.280> like<00:01:06.310> that

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:06.550 
and indianature look something like that

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:08.760 
and indianature look something like that
and<00:01:06.820> as<00:01:07.030> you<00:01:07.060> can<00:01:07.210> see<00:01:07.390> here<00:01:08.080> down<00:01:08.410> there<00:01:08.590> I've

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:08.770 
and as you can see here down there I've

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.610 
and as you can see here down there I've
left<00:01:09.220> some<00:01:09.580> space<00:01:09.850> for<00:01:10.090> a<00:01:10.150> door<00:01:10.420> and<00:01:10.660> we'll

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:11.620 
left some space for a door and we'll

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:15.720 
left some space for a door and we'll
create<00:01:11.950> simply<00:01:12.850> another<00:01:13.330> row<00:01:13.900> of<00:01:14.730> cobblestone

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:15.730 
create simply another row of cobblestone

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:18.660 
create simply another row of cobblestone
here<00:01:16.680> then<00:01:17.680> we<00:01:17.860> will<00:01:18.010> make<00:01:18.190> this<00:01:18.370> kind<00:01:18.610> of

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670 
here then we will make this kind of

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:31.750 
here then we will make this kind of
frame

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:31.760 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:36.820 

that<00:01:32.390> and<00:01:32.870> then<00:01:33.530> you<00:01:33.710> wanna<00:01:33.950> just<00:01:34.520> close<00:01:35.000> up

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:36.830 
that and then you wanna just close up

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:41.540 
that and then you wanna just close up
those<00:01:37.250> gaps

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:41.550 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:44.950 

and<00:01:41.670> in<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.450> next<00:01:42.870> step<00:01:43.170> you<00:01:43.410> will<00:01:43.620> just<00:01:43.950> add

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
and in the next step you will just add

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:51.139 
and in the next step you will just add
two<00:01:45.960> blocks<00:01:46.730> on<00:01:47.730> each<00:01:47.850> of<00:01:48.090> those<00:01:48.470> frames

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
two blocks on each of those frames

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:57.020 
two blocks on each of those frames
with<00:01:52.149> one<00:01:52.540> block

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.230 

then<00:01:57.630> we<00:01:57.810> will<00:01:58.110> take<00:01:58.290> a<00:01:58.350> blog<00:01:58.619> and<00:01:59.040> just<00:01:59.369> go

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
then we will take a blog and just go

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:10.889 
then we will take a blog and just go
seven<00:02:01.140> blocks<00:02:01.409> up<00:02:01.799> to<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.159> air

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:19.910 

do<00:02:11.379> this<00:02:11.530> at<00:02:11.769> every<00:02:12.220> side

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.130 

in<00:02:19.980> the<00:02:20.130> next<00:02:20.460> step<00:02:20.880> we<00:02:21.330> will<00:02:21.360> add<00:02:21.810> a<00:02:22.970> pair<00:02:23.970> of

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
in the next step we will add a pair of

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.610 
in the next step we will add a pair of
cobblestone<00:02:25.140> blocks<00:02:25.650> on<00:02:26.490> each<00:02:27.000> side<00:02:27.030> of<00:02:27.780> those

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
cobblestone blocks on each side of those

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:36.980 
cobblestone blocks on each side of those
posts

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.350 

and<00:02:37.080> now<00:02:37.590> for<00:02:37.950> building<00:02:38.370> the<00:02:38.550> roof<00:02:38.790> we<00:02:39.330> will

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
and now for building the roof we will

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:45.260 
and now for building the roof we will
add<00:02:40.670> five<00:02:41.670> blocks<00:02:42.000> of<00:02:42.210> planks<00:02:42.840> of<00:02:43.050> the

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:56.809 

on<00:02:45.570> the<00:02:45.780> side<00:02:46.050> of<00:02:46.080> course

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:58.819 

then<00:02:57.299> with<00:02:57.480> like<00:02:57.659> stairs<00:02:58.049> and<00:02:58.349> place<00:02:58.560> them

00:02:58.819 --> 00:02:58.829 
then with like stairs and place them

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:17.720 
then with like stairs and place them
through<00:02:59.430> stairs<00:02:59.900> on<00:03:00.900> every<00:03:01.290> row<00:03:01.980> of<00:03:02.280> planks

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:22.980 

then<00:03:18.330> we<00:03:18.510> will<00:03:18.690> create<00:03:18.870> a<00:03:19.349> row<00:03:19.620> of<00:03:19.860> plans<00:03:20.659> of

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:22.990 
then we will create a row of plans of

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:26.390 
then we will create a row of plans of
each<00:03:23.500> three<00:03:24.310> blocks<00:03:24.730> wide

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
each three blocks wide

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.850 
each three blocks wide
and<00:03:26.849> puts<00:03:27.299> Astaire

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:29.860 
and puts Astaire

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:33.030 
and puts Astaire
in<00:03:30.340> the<00:03:30.430> middle<00:03:30.670> of<00:03:30.820> each<00:03:31.000> other

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
in the middle of each other

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:39.480 
in the middle of each other
you'll<00:03:33.640> repeat<00:03:34.209> the<00:03:34.390> same<00:03:34.659> procedure

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:39.490 

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:53.140 

this

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.150 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:56.080 

and<00:03:53.590> to<00:03:54.590> create<00:03:54.860> some<00:03:55.069> details<00:03:55.549> we<00:03:55.790> will<00:03:55.819> take

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.090 
and to create some details we will take

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:01.110 
and to create some details we will take
fences<00:03:57.549> put<00:03:58.629> one<00:03:59.629> on<00:03:59.780> each

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120 
fences put one on each

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.360 
fences put one on each
those<00:04:01.690> pillars<00:04:02.170> blocks

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:04.370 
those pillars blocks
