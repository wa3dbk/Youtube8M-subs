00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:06.660
 the plaza de mirasol day by day changes its 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.730
 style and draws attention both to 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.389
 resident public as tourists who 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:14.490
 pass or arrive at this place of carob 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:16.379
 We wanted to know what is its attractiveness and 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.480
 we found out about a project that 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.090
 they develop neighbors with only 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.300
 intention to create a space which 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.670
 they can share themselves 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.920
 because I come 54 years ago here as 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.240
 a lot of people that I've met every 40 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.790
 of 50 and more than me 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:36.760
 12 years 17 years and I find it 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:39.210
 here we did not know each other well who we 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:41.489
 we greeted the street maybe 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:45.270
 but today we go through here we 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.800
 and let 's salute with 200 people 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.530
 We have worked here and we know each other 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.590
 and his family are on facebook 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.930
 plaza mirasol and we talked and I go up 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.730
 small things journal activities 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.129
 of the newspaper that are which 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.140
 Santiago misses the water 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.690
 wind and the freshness of the place make 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.060
 this space an attractive that turns 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.670
 the imagination at rest and a good 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.229
 share the wind the water the sun the 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.060
 land that camps times that are 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.500
 present to house 7 which are the 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.750
 natural elements that we have 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.690
 then you have to explore exploit them 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:21.210
 so that according to that people 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:23.880
 perceive with all your sense of hearing the 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.399
 touch the taste everything we have as 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.860
 conditions for living a 

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:31.020
 different experience each place is 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.170
 thought to enjoy nature 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:37.500
 Nothing surrounds them all, they all form a 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:41.280
 balance as it is also a contribution in 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:44.340
 terms of the resources use everything 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.770
 what it has and what exists here 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.509
 there is the sea there is the sea breeze 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.810
 that accompanies us for example listening 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.659
 is 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:54.700
 in principle texas true that they are not 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:59.110
 texas well it's in our context in 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:00.970
 a format in a structure that has 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.530
 a sound that's why he's with a musician 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:04.090
 just said look is not just a sound 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.700
 but if it is higher and lower 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:09.880
 they generate different sounds therefore 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:11.440
 it's a polyphony and then they think 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.180
 add layers of information to what 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:16.269
 are the different materials that are 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:18.040
 here if you see roses are not only roses 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:21.190
 are climbing roses that originate 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:23.260
 a pergola and the pergola serves so that 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:25.540
 people pass was the pergola and 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:28.450
 have a place to be where while 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.459
 feel listen to water run one of the 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.700
 intellectual actors in this creation 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:36.640
 believes that after three years the 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:39.190
 dream of being in a public place that 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:42.670
 that does not depend on the state but public 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:44.830
 because it is of all as content of what 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:48.400
 that a public space 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:50.500
 in general in chile we understand something that 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.210
 belongs to the state I think he 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.580
 published is exactly what we 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:56.380
 belongs to us all and from that 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:58.300
 perspective is made this square in the 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:00.730
 sense that we all participate 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:02.140
 we work, we all take care and everyone 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.540
 we live the experience of the square 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:06.850
 plants that seek to extend and create 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:09.310
 green spaces that will cover the earth 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:11.320
 with its flowers, vegetables to share 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.870
 among the neighbors are some of the 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:16.690
 attractive that day by day grow in this 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:19.180
 space that pretends to be magical for your 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:21.640
 less concrete visitors have 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:24.640
 for example water that fall by the edges 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:26.560
 giving a soft sound and you sit and 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.959
 listening to water allows you to read calmly 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:32.080
 allows you to reflect and be at peace 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:34.500
 but there are travel spaces that are 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:36.730
 super 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:39.790
 simple and that you do not necessarily 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:42.190
 you know who is going but you know there are 234 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:43.900
 people walking because not also 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:47.520
 it has a certain intimacy we do not like 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.520
 be in the center of the square 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:55.060
 let's drive in a creepy way 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:58.209
 done and I'll show you here some 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:59.920
 shots of that fall and every account that 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:01.480
 the flowers the branches begin to fall 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:03.400
 sideways therefore you and the 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:06.040
 terraces begin to be concealed 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:09.250
 I was going to have flowers between here 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:11.349
 December and April or May in volumes 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:13.510
 important looking for the true way is 

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:15.730
 that the square is ours we are 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:17.889
 doing sowing because all the 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:19.570
 vegetables on the inner edges that 

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:22.240
 they will not see each other and they will see 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:25.990
 and if they look very beautiful that if I cucumber 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:27.910
 it goes to italy no melons the cucumbers 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:30.610
 they are going to hang by the structure we have 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:32.830
 preserved everything there was and everything 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:35.229
 serves a shrub that is not that it went to 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:37.930
 less part of a structure like 

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:40.509
 structure is useful anything that 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:42.310
 that already it serves us to hang something for 

00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:44.349
 place something is useful then come to 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:46.990
 see all kinds of food by others 

00:04:44.349 --> 00:04:48.340
 greens that followed melons what 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:50.830
 want here we see coming in summer 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:53.349
 harvest because it's your house is public 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:56.020
 provided that a project that was not 

00:04:53.349 --> 00:04:57.610
 announced to anyone who is supported almost 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:00.580
 alone with 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:03.099
 helps private contributions and with a lot but 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:05.500
 much will and this square has flight 

00:05:03.099 --> 00:05:08.729
 minus three more years of investment 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:08.729
 important goes forward 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:16.160
 and a wonderful future of about 100 years 

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:19.220
 because it's structured for between 80 and 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:21.759
 100 years of pleasure and spend it very very 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:21.759
 well here
