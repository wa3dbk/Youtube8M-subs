00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:06.300
 Janja Power Farrow's Keyboard 

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:08.240
 It is 500 yen 

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:10.630
 It is cheap 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:14.640
 this 

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:14.640
 This is the model number 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:17.650
 bsk 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:28.920
 bskbu is 02 value ordering 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:28.920
 This is to connect with usb 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:33.220
 in this way 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:36.820
 usb terminal is 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:40.470
 Yes there is this pointing 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:44.880
 Through this cable 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:51.030
 It feels like connecting 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:53.780
 After saying how here keyboard bought Why Well 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:58.760
 Playstation 3 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:01:05.900
 We think whether keyboard corresponding to is not easy 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:07.920
 There at 500 yen N Best Denki I'd be doing the guy Tteyuu now bb of Maya 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:12.860
 Because it was sold by 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:17.740
 I think Well wonder if I even Well, that's ... bad sources was immediately purchase 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:19.010
 I bought it and connected it to PlayStation 3 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:24.720
 Normally 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:26.200
 It was good really because could use to us with recognition Well 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.950
 that 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:35.280
 The price is 10 times different than the genuine product 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:35.280
 Even though this is 500 yen , PlayStation 3's 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:43.190
 The genuine princess board costs 5,000 yen, isn't it? 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:47.510
 It is expensive 5,000 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:49.300
 If so, I wonder if it is OK so much or 500 yen 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:52.020
 That's why 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.020
 It was 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:59.770
 Or with you Hey GEO Toka tsutaya 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:05.920
 It sells to the big camera with that game corner 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:09.420
 I think the keyboard is just something like that in the 2000 yen range or something more than that. 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:14.819
 Keyboard which game company made 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:20.920
 But I think that it is easy to be a main office if it is 500 yen because it can be used normally even if it is not such 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:25.930
 Yes Well I are people Well, talk to say Do not wireless is good in usb is another 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:32.340
 Even if it is bluetooth correspondence or buffalo 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:32.340
 I think it would be good if you can get cheap at ELECOM 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:38.870
 When it comes to what really matters 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:41.400
 True 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.750
 A little hard 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:48.530
 I Yeah jar that 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:49.950
 Compared to that usual desktop or Fujitsu 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:53.470
 I wonder a little 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:57.150
 I feel like it's cheap 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:03:02.000
 It is easy to hit the market 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:09.580
 People to Well everywhere Henki is that properly such positive 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:13.290
 I think that there is better to buy the keyboard towards the top more a little out of the money 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:17.090
 Say Well merely the 500 yen 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.090
 Somewhat right 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:23.890
 That cost performance has been raised so much more 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:28.590
 a 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:31.709
 About the top ranked team so well 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:33.360
 It's not like feeling 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:36.620
 In 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:38.319
 It can be used normally 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:41.340
 Normally without problems a 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:41.340
 I will come 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:49.770
 Maa's 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:52.850
 It seems that here is light and half heavy if it is Fujitsu and so on 2 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:55.140
 This I feel Te crispy 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:59.630
 How much 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:04:02.560
 I understand more than this of vaio's e series 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:02.560
 From this than is 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:12.390

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:14.900
