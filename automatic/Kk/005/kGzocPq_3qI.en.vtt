the<00:03:06.350> spoon<00:03:06.590> first<00:03:06.860> okay<00:03:07.930> so<00:03:08.930> first<00:03:09.260> I<00:03:09.560> will

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:09.710 
the spoon first okay so first I will

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:15.090 
the spoon first okay so first I will
clear<00:03:10.520> all<00:03:10.760> of<00:03:10.910> this<00:03:11.060> and<00:03:11.860> I<00:03:12.860> will<00:03:13.450> put<00:03:14.450> in<00:03:14.750> a

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:15.100 
clear all of this and I will put in a

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:19.180 
clear all of this and I will put in a
different<00:03:16.100> mode<00:03:16.690> and<00:03:17.690> now<00:03:18.080> it<00:03:18.380> says<00:03:18.650> serving

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
different mode and now it says serving

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:24.370 
different mode and now it says serving
size<00:03:19.459> nutrient<00:03:20.420> and<00:03:20.630> what<00:03:21.560> it<00:03:21.650> equals<00:03:21.970> so<00:03:23.380> what

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:24.380 
size nutrient and what it equals so what

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:27.880 
size nutrient and what it equals so what
I<00:03:24.530> will<00:03:24.800> do<00:03:25.070> is<00:03:25.310> I<00:03:25.970> will<00:03:26.060> put<00:03:26.959> push<00:03:27.709> this

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:27.890 
I will do is I will put push this

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:31.240 
I will do is I will put push this
serving<00:03:28.490> button<00:03:29.590> for<00:03:30.590> their<00:03:30.680> serving<00:03:31.040> size

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.250 
serving button for their serving size

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.120 
serving button for their serving size
and<00:03:31.580> you<00:03:31.700> see<00:03:31.910> it<00:03:32.030> blinks<00:03:32.570> right<00:03:32.990> here<00:03:33.290> on<00:03:33.590> the

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.130 
and you see it blinks right here on the

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:38.040 
and you see it blinks right here on the
serving<00:03:34.490> size<00:03:34.760> and<00:03:35.440> I<00:03:36.440> will<00:03:36.560> look<00:03:36.890> at<00:03:37.160> the

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:38.050 
serving size and I will look at the

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:41.980 
serving size and I will look at the
Nutrition<00:03:39.050> Facts<00:03:39.380> on<00:03:40.300> the<00:03:41.300> side<00:03:41.540> of<00:03:41.660> the<00:03:41.780> label

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:41.990 
Nutrition Facts on the side of the label

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:46.570 
Nutrition Facts on the side of the label
on<00:03:42.290> the<00:03:42.350> peanut<00:03:42.920> butter<00:03:43.040> and<00:03:43.420> it<00:03:44.420> says<00:03:45.580> right

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:46.580 
on the peanut butter and it says right

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:49.990 
on the peanut butter and it says right
here<00:03:46.840> that<00:03:47.840> it's<00:03:48.260> 32<00:03:49.040> grams<00:03:49.340> per<00:03:49.760> serving

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
here that it's 32 grams per serving

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.949 
here that it's 32 grams per serving
stockist<00:03:50.690> so<00:03:51.410> the<00:03:51.530> serving<00:03:51.890> size<00:03:52.130> is<00:03:52.430> 32<00:03:53.200> grams

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:55.959 
stockist so the serving size is 32 grams

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:59.800 
stockist so the serving size is 32 grams
so<00:03:56.959> I<00:03:56.990> would<00:03:57.350> put<00:03:57.560> it<00:03:57.709> in<00:03:57.860> there<00:03:58.190> as<00:03:58.540> 32<00:03:59.540> and

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
so I would put it in there as 32 and

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:03.730 
so I would put it in there as 32 and
then<00:04:00.650> I<00:04:00.830> would<00:04:01.220> press<00:04:01.520> the<00:04:02.380> nutrient<00:04:03.380> button

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:03.740 
then I would press the nutrient button

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:07.870 
then I would press the nutrient button
and<00:04:05.020> then<00:04:06.020> I<00:04:06.260> would<00:04:06.620> look<00:04:06.800> on<00:04:06.950> the<00:04:06.980> label<00:04:07.280> again

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:07.880 
and then I would look on the label again

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:11.140 
and then I would look on the label again
and<00:04:08.590> whichever<00:04:09.590> nutrient<00:04:10.310> you<00:04:10.550> are<00:04:10.790> looking

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
and whichever nutrient you are looking

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:16.360 
and whichever nutrient you are looking
for<00:04:11.950> you<00:04:12.950> put<00:04:13.280> in<00:04:13.700> how<00:04:14.510> many<00:04:14.570> grams<00:04:15.020> that<00:04:15.320> is<00:04:15.380> so

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:16.370 
for you put in how many grams that is so

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:18.610 
for you put in how many grams that is so
I<00:04:16.609> am<00:04:17.120> going<00:04:17.390> to<00:04:17.600> go<00:04:17.750> with<00:04:18.049> total

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:18.620 
I am going to go with total

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:20.720 
I am going to go with total
carbohydrates<00:04:19.609> which<00:04:19.880> is<00:04:20.090> seven

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:20.730 
carbohydrates which is seven

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:25.120 
carbohydrates which is seven
grounds<00:04:21.420> because<00:04:22.230> my<00:04:22.680> son<00:04:22.980> is<00:04:23.010> diabetic<00:04:23.760> and

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.130 
grounds because my son is diabetic and

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:32.900 
grounds because my son is diabetic and
so<00:04:26.130> I<00:04:26.370> print<00:04:27.050> seven<00:04:28.050> and<00:04:28.790> then<00:04:29.790> I<00:04:30.260> put<00:04:31.910> the

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:32.910 
so I print seven and then I put the

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:36.290 
so I print seven and then I put the
spoon<00:04:33.270> without<00:04:33.960> the<00:04:34.500> peanut<00:04:34.800> butter<00:04:34.980> on<00:04:35.880> here

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
spoon without the peanut butter on here

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:47.300 
spoon without the peanut butter on here
and<00:04:36.860> I<00:04:38.120> tear<00:04:39.120> it<00:04:43.550> then<00:04:44.990> do<00:04:45.990> the<00:04:46.350> spoon<00:04:46.710> with<00:04:47.280> the

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:47.310 
and I tear it then do the spoon with the

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:50.380 
and I tear it then do the spoon with the
peanut<00:04:47.820> butter<00:04:48.590> since<00:04:49.590> it's<00:04:49.740> already<00:04:49.920> chaired

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:50.390 
peanut butter since it's already chaired

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:58.910 
peanut butter since it's already chaired
and<00:04:51.950> I<00:04:52.950> press<00:04:54.920> equals<00:04:55.920> and<00:04:56.330> it<00:04:57.330> tells<00:04:57.600> me<00:04:57.920> it

00:04:58.910 --> 00:04:58.920 
and I press equals and it tells me it

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:05.980 
and I press equals and it tells me it
equals<00:04:59.880> five<00:05:00.830> grams<00:05:01.830> of<00:05:02.390> carbs<00:05:04.580> okay

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:05.990 
equals five grams of carbs okay

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:10.640 
equals five grams of carbs okay
and<00:05:07.100> what<00:05:08.100> I<00:05:08.310> really<00:05:09.000> really<00:05:09.360> like<00:05:09.900> about<00:05:10.140> this

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:10.650 
and what I really really like about this

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:19.550 
and what I really really like about this
scale<00:05:11.190> is<00:05:12.080> that<00:05:13.080> it<00:05:15.950> has<00:05:16.950> no<00:05:17.340> core<00:05:18.470> so<00:05:19.470> you

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:19.560 
scale is that it has no core so you

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.500 
scale is that it has no core so you
could<00:05:19.830> pretty<00:05:20.010> much<00:05:20.130> take<00:05:20.550> it<00:05:20.730> anywhere<00:05:21.240> with

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:21.510 
could pretty much take it anywhere with

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:28.010 
could pretty much take it anywhere with
you<00:05:21.810> traveling<00:05:24.230> anywhere<00:05:25.230> in<00:05:25.560> the<00:05:26.250> car<00:05:27.020> and

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:28.020 
you traveling anywhere in the car and

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:32.060 
you traveling anywhere in the car and
and<00:05:28.470> it<00:05:29.070> goes<00:05:29.610> off<00:05:29.940> of<00:05:30.240> four<00:05:30.810> double<00:05:31.680> A<00:05:31.800> or

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:32.070 
and it goes off of four double A or

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:33.800 
and it goes off of four double A or
Triple<00:05:32.670> A<00:05:32.760> batteries

Triple A batteries

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:38.900 
Triple A batteries
I<00:05:33.840> mean<00:05:34.350> and<00:05:35.660> and<00:05:37.160> there's<00:05:38.160> also<00:05:38.400> a<00:05:38.580> memory
