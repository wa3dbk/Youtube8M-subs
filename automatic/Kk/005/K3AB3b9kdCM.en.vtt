00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
because I haven't done anything like

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.569 
because I haven't done anything like
this<00:00:42.300> like<00:00:42.690> a<00:00:42.870> bronzy<00:00:43.530> kind<00:00:44.100> of<00:00:44.219> look<00:00:44.399> before

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
this like a bronzy kind of look before

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.389 
this like a bronzy kind of look before
and<00:00:45.090> I<00:00:45.149> really<00:00:45.420> felt<00:00:45.719> like<00:00:45.870> I<00:00:46.320> should<00:00:46.800> do<00:00:47.219> it

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
and I really felt like I should do it

for<00:00:47.610> summer<00:00:48.120> and<00:00:48.390> spring<00:00:48.629> and<00:00:49.230> I<00:00:49.530> just<00:00:49.739> think

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
for summer and spring and I just think

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.610 
for summer and spring and I just think
it<00:00:50.039> would<00:00:50.129> complement<00:00:50.789> almost<00:00:51.360> every<00:00:51.960> outfit

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
it would complement almost every outfit

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.529 
it would complement almost every outfit
and<00:00:52.829> it<00:00:53.070> used<00:00:53.250> to<00:00:53.399> be<00:00:53.550> one<00:00:53.940> of<00:00:53.969> my<00:00:54.120> favorite

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
and it used to be one of my favorite

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.240 
and it used to be one of my favorite
