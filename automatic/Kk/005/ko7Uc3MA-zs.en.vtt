in the past in the evening news we said
that<00:00:54.200> could<00:00:54.379> be<00:00:54.500> the<00:00:54.649> cause<00:00:54.890> of<00:00:54.920> the<00:00:55.280> depressed

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:58.810 
that could be the cause of the depressed
flaring<00:00:56.239> yesterday<00:00:56.780> but<00:00:57.620> that<00:00:57.860> a<00:00:58.129> decay<00:00:58.789> of
