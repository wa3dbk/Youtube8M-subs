00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:05.710
 not staying here it does not look very proud 

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:07.290
 you are frank 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.290
 you did not tell us that everything you know about each other 

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:12.809
 I was terrified 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.209
 I told the management that we had to stop everything but I was told 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:19.380
 if I did it, I'll be next on the list 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.869
 - so much attacked damage I stayed here to send a message to 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:24.300
 colonial business 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.430
 I wanted to tell them you find the time nothing but the current has been 

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:30.849
 cut before I had time to send the message 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:33.690
 I tried to stop them 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.480
 or in the fall 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.560
 below all his talent but the entrance is blocked 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.970
 the settlers landed the carrier on the entrance just before the size of the 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:42.860
 quests 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:46.430
 what isps come here to do why his queen his head is 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:47.900
 historian 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.900
 no doubt for his mental control abilities 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.920
 in any case it is what interests exact genius normandie to commando 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.700
 three weeks 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:59.940
 within a few hours 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.810
 as I get a lot of head transmission 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:05.040
 I'm proud we would say 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.680
 the cgtr 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.700
 you heard it's not the moment to leave 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.090
 if these companies 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.320
 that could perhaps be helpful to you and to repair the harm that I did 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.980
 new and take action 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:34.980
 the case everyone shut up let me think 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:37.310
 a few 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.310
 you will not feel like that in fact I will not get away with it 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.830
 when to 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:45.870
 analysts 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:49.310
 spotless get out of the ivory coast in the offer 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.590
 I was beginning to hope that spoils you made skin 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.940
 the exogenous database and taught me interesting things about 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:01.790
 days 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:03.790
 I know what happened on a sudden blow 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:05.690
 no need to reiterate here 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:07.630
 what was going on at jean 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.529
 the transmissions has just been reinstated 

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:12.599
 this colony has become too embarrassing to be stressed 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:14.480
 and finally think about overcoming 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.479
 you can not treat us like machines 

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:18.959
 it's not all about 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.769
 there is something much more precious on this planet than 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:23.149
 handful of settlers 

00:02:23.149 --> 00:02:26.269
 to steal their talk of thorium yourself I'll take care of it 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:27.599
 the what 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:30.599
 it is a telepathic creature bissau where frau 

00:02:31.469 --> 00:02:34.589
 she gradually takes control of pantyhose exact genius is aware 

00:02:34.589 --> 00:02:35.779
 from the beginning 

00:02:35.779 --> 00:02:38.689
 you will pay us a room 

00:02:38.689 --> 00:02:40.479
 that's what you say 

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:43.889
 no one will cry over our fate trust me 

00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:47.559
 you do not see the financial potential of this colony you could return 

00:02:47.559 --> 00:02:50.239
 the situation to your advantage 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:51.969
 what do you mean 

00:02:51.969 --> 00:02:54.919
 humanity against all odds 

00:02:54.919 --> 00:02:57.919
 the most adventurous will be ready to pay Russian fortunes 

00:02:58.699 --> 00:03:00.509
 the politician 

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:04.509
 especially as playing on the wild side of the planet it would require 

00:03:04.509 --> 00:03:08.439
 that a minimum investment the worst is that it's likely to make tabarre 

00:03:08.439 --> 00:03:11.799
 but if it allows us to resume a normal life I'm for 

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:14.089
 it could work 

00:03:14.089 --> 00:03:15.679
 for imminent 

00:03:15.679 --> 00:03:18.789
 what do you do with it 

00:03:18.789 --> 00:03:21.359
 then you have to make them disappear 

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:23.269
 we can not kill the giants 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:24.929
 they are innocent 

00:03:24.929 --> 00:03:27.979
 by killing time nothing might have freed the settlers from his 

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:28.999
 influence 

00:03:28.999 --> 00:03:30.589
 I say well maybe 

00:03:30.589 --> 00:03:31.899
 it's worth a try 

00:03:31.899 --> 00:03:35.019
 maybe we'll have to fight against settlers 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:38.019
 there must be another way 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:39.689
 I may have a solution 

00:03:39.689 --> 00:03:41.739
 to see me before leaving for london 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:43.979
 thank you for agreeing to help us 

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:46.669
 I think there is a way to save the settlers 

00:03:46.669 --> 00:03:48.039
 I listen to you 

00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:51.819
 you could use a benign csic rothau agent to neutralize the 

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:52.689
 settlers 

00:03:52.689 --> 00:03:55.229
 a good classic attack for example 

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:56.230
 It's a good idea 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:58.479
 I'll do my best 

00:03:58.479 --> 00:03:59.599
 wonderful 

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:02.599
 thank you commander 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:13.799
 nothing could have altered a human body that way 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:15.689
 all that exceeds me 

00:04:15.689 --> 00:04:19.259
 prohibition to hurt the settlers even if the back of the defense shoot me 

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:21.809
 use your stun grenades 

00:04:21.809 --> 00:04:24.809
 after five other sites 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:38.059
 I tried to resist but he was in my head 

00:04:38.059 --> 00:04:41.059
 we could not imagine the Toulons 

00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:44.779
 if I considered myself their leader 

00:04:44.779 --> 00:04:47.779
 he trusted me 

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:50.370
 he wants that 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:52.379
 I stop 

00:04:52.379 --> 00:04:55.379
 I refuse 

00:05:02.389 --> 00:05:05.659
 laurent 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:20.930
 it only remains to find someone fired shots fired 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:24.599
 profits 

00:05:24.599 --> 00:05:27.599
 that's done 

00:05:29.259 --> 00:05:32.259
 we'll have to take out the big artillery 

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:02.419
 an intruder 

00:06:02.419 --> 00:06:05.259
 every step of your life and a transgression 

00:06:05.259 --> 00:06:07.780
 thousands of red mouth stems 

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:11.840
 still seeing nothing but say of monaco and we try to run on 

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:14.729
 square 

00:06:14.729 --> 00:06:17.569
 I speak to you in the name of the eternal flower 

00:06:17.569 --> 00:06:19.619
 as I did for fear 

00:06:19.619 --> 00:06:24.379
 the tory has eaten facebok surround him fear the eye and respect the time 

00:06:25.219 --> 00:06:27.249
 you gave something in its place 

00:06:27.249 --> 00:06:29.800
 something I need 

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:32.930
 because she was looking for a vanished knowledge 

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:36.610
 the eternal flame was marked by the release for the first time 

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:38.939
 since the beginning of recycling 

00:06:38.939 --> 00:06:41.369
 we have entered into a contract 

00:06:41.369 --> 00:06:46.789
 then the 4,302 of the slain pulpit preparing the next site a flesh 

00:06:46.789 --> 00:06:48.400
 given voluntarily 

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:51.399
 did you examine saturated with lies 

00:06:51.399 --> 00:06:54.589
 lafleur and lets her not listen to lies 

00:06:54.589 --> 00:06:57.930
 give me what I need and I see you I'm going from this 

00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:01.949
 more than ever doria the contracts what works 

00:07:01.949 --> 00:07:03.599
 bob wilson 

00:07:03.599 --> 00:07:05.330
 but endures for too long
