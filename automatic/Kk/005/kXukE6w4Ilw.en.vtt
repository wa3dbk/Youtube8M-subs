00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:12.980
 this mandate that mother earth and the 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:15.019
 humanity are not required 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:17.590
 we save the proposal of the group of 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:20.900
 open treaty of the united nations 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:24.650
 about the objectives of development 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:28.400
 sustainable that incorporates the proposal of 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:30.949
 bolivia and the peoples of the world about 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:33.480
 respect for Mother Earth and 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:35.610
 harmony with nature 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:39.300
 it is not a simple statement 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.940
 political is a shared commitment with 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.790
 everyone to change our 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:48.540
 vision of development with a vision 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:51.059
 more holistic and holistic we propose to the 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:54.180
 world living well in harmony with the 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:56.190
 mother earth and building a 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.280
 culture of the life of the 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.489
 complementarity of solidarity and 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.489
 peace 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.210
 the respect for the mother has been lost 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:07.210
 land 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:16.020
 today it is marketed and manipulated with 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:20.070
 serious dangers to life now 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:23.820
 like in no other time the premise 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:28.049
 that man thinks himself the master and owner of 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:30.990
 nature is more certain than ever the 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:35.130
 man encouraged by capitalism has 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:37.950
 turned everything into a market including 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.280
 mere genetic manipulation and 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:43.760
 destruction of the human being 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:46.880
 human and natural life and their happiness 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:50.210
 should be the reason for being of 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:52.820
 any transmission focus or 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:56.290
 development tools none 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:02:01.310
 development vision makes sense if not 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:03.920
 respects nor strength of life 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:06.350
 economic growth alone does not 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:10.280
 generates the organization of rights 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:12.470
 social and live well the horizon of 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:15.319
 equality requires distribution of 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:18.590
 wealth economic empowerment and 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:20.900
 politician of the poor the excluded the 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.940
 marginal actors requires 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:26.030
 community strengthening and 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:30.920
 building solidarity societies and 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:34.849
 not of exclusive societies based 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:38.930
 in the accumulation of wealth and governed 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:43.730
 for profit greed and greed 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:47.390
 of the market together with the g77 plus 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:50.150
 China I must manifest the fundamental 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:53.200
 importance of regaining the sovereignty of 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:56.690
 our countries and the soils about 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:59.090
 our natural resources only to 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:01.569
 through the recovery of control of 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:04.690
 the natural fences can be obtained 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:08.320
 greater benefits 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:12.210
 for our villages in particular for 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:14.440
 eliminate poverty to invest in the 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:16.630
 economic diversification the 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.670
 industrialization in the programs 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:21.400
 social 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:24.130
 Each country has the right to decide 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:27.810
 their priorities and strategies 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:31.599
 development but it is important that these 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:35.709
 strengthen environmental functions and 

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:38.410
 the ecosystems of mother earth in the 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:42.310
 complementary framework and support 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:45.819
 mutual between production systems and 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:48.010
 communities and nature is vital 

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:50.709
 achieve a balance between the right of 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:53.370
 mother earth the right to development 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:56.050
 The rights of indigenous peoples 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:59.290
 social rights rights 

00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:01.600
 economic and cultural groups as well 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:05.110
 as the rights of the poor to leave 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:07.450
 of poverty, complementarity and 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:10.660
 mutual support are instruments for 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:14.069
 keep our mother earth 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:18.299
 no mercantile incentives 

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:21.200
 in this we differ with the followers of 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:24.230
 the so-called 'green economy' 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:28.220
 an important issue to be promoted in the 

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:30.680
 framework of the post-2015 agenda is the 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:33.920
 human right to water as well as the 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:38.170
 right of mother earth to enjoy the 

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:41.810
 water to generate and reproduce life 

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:44.930
 three million people live today in 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:48.890
 day in areas or regions where demand 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:52.340
 of water exceeds supply and this 

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:54.560
 reality is aggravated by the course of 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:58.940
 years 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:05:04.310
 2030 water demand 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:07.660
 will have increased by 30% and the year 2050 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:11.000
 4 million people will suffer 

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:14.180
 critically of shortage of water in a 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.870
 climate change context sisters and 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:20.660
 brothers in bolivia 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:23.020
 consistent with human development 

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:26.840
 to the water and with our constitution 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:30.110
 thanks to the national program called 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:30.860
 my water has already reached the goals of 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:35.050
 millennium 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:38.360
 even three years earlier than planned 

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:42.460
 declare the human right to water 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:46.220
 it means to prohibit its privatization 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:50.650
 Water is life and can not be subject to 

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:50.650
 profit or mercantilism
