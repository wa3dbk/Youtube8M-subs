00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.585
 Let's play the next game, which is the "Abecedário". 

00:00:03.585 --> 00:00:06.779
 The "Abecedário" will be played by ... 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.634
 Marcio, Daniel and Elidio, standing, please. 

00:00:09.634 --> 00:00:13.440
 How does the game work? Our players will improvise a scene 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:20.803
 and they will start a scene and each speech of that scene the next speech has to start with the next letter of the alphabet, 

00:00:20.803 --> 00:00:24.093
 following the order of the alphabet, for example, if you start with the letter 'L', 

00:00:24.093 --> 00:00:27.984
 will rotate the entire alphabet and goes to the letter 'L'. 

00:00:27.984 --> 00:00:31.526
 Who has a book here in the audience? 

00:00:31.526 --> 00:00:34.036
 Do you have a book? Bring this book here, please. 

00:00:34.036 --> 00:00:35.796
 - What's your name? - Yasmin. 

00:00:35.796 --> 00:00:39.026
 Yasmin. Give it here ... 

00:00:39.026 --> 00:00:43.976
 Yasmin starts with 'Y' or 'I'? With 'Y'. That Cool. 

00:00:43.976 --> 00:00:46.769
 And she has it here, look, 'The Art Of War', cool. 

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:48.780
 And I'll get a phrase here ... 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.019
 'These are the advantages of the different camps' 

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:59.539
 Sun Tzu. Let's do a tribute to the Sun Tzu, starting with the letter 'S'. 

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:06.093
 'These are the advantages of the different camps,' from 'S' to 'S', valid. 

00:01:09.732 --> 00:01:15.273
 Sir! Unfortunately the enemy has different camps! 

00:01:15.273 --> 00:01:17.753
 We can not identify! 

00:01:17.753 --> 00:01:20.113
 We will try again. 

00:01:20.113 --> 00:01:23.494
 One more time, surely, sir! 

00:01:23.494 --> 00:01:27.084
 Let's use the Weskenovisk tactic! 

00:01:27.084 --> 00:01:29.654
 Weskenovski? 

00:01:29.654 --> 00:01:32.324
 'Xenhor'! 

00:01:37.026 --> 00:01:39.627
 Yes! 

00:01:41.907 --> 00:01:48.067
 - Yasmin, our commander ... [bell] - 'Z' 

00:01:49.328 --> 00:01:53.748
 ... You sent for me and I'm going to get you! Bye! 

00:01:54.918 --> 00:01:59.028
 Zero-three asking for permission to go to the camp, sir! 

00:01:59.028 --> 00:02:06.891
 Right now! And turn me around with their heads all hanging in your backpack. 

00:02:07.882 --> 00:02:10.791
 Belé! 

00:02:14.772 --> 00:02:18.172
 'Campamento' 

00:02:39.518 --> 00:02:44.015
 I'll leave a bomb in every tent! 

00:02:44.015 --> 00:02:54.438
 [yawning] Êêêêêêaaahhh ... 

00:02:55.237 --> 00:02:58.887
 God, I do not know why I woke up now, in the middle of the night. 

00:02:58.887 --> 00:03:08.468
 [wick sound on] Fffssssss ... Fffssssss ... 

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:12.615
 Grenade! 

00:03:15.424 --> 00:03:18.304
 [Falling Whistle] 

00:03:18.304 --> 00:03:21.134
 Holy shit! 

00:03:23.656 --> 00:03:27.108
 [explosion] 

00:03:27.377 --> 00:03:32.527
 That made everyone wake up at the camp! 

00:03:33.316 --> 00:03:37.658
 Ah! Oh! Ah! 

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:41.871
 [sleepy] I'm already armed, what happened? 

00:03:41.871 --> 00:03:45.021
 'Kara, have not you heard?' 

00:03:45.021 --> 00:03:48.051
 Did not you hear the exploding grenade? 

00:03:48.051 --> 00:03:51.711
 It was an assassination attempt on the other camp, let's now kill them! 

00:03:51.711 --> 00:03:54.311
 Light, light talk, man, it's okay! 

00:03:54.311 --> 00:03:57.252
 But we almost died, soldier! 

00:03:59.046 --> 00:04:02.375
 'But' We almost 'died' 

00:04:02.595 --> 00:04:06.475
 Very! We almost died a lot! 

00:04:06.475 --> 00:04:10.796
 - Same! - No need to repeat! 

00:04:17.047 --> 00:04:20.397
 Look, I can explain ... 

00:04:20.397 --> 00:04:23.638
 Can you explain the damn thing! 

00:04:23.638 --> 00:04:26.749
 Who said it was me? 

00:04:27.278 --> 00:04:31.971
 Boy, it's written on your forehead ... 

00:04:34.511 --> 00:04:40.011
 Sun Tzu! [bell and applause] 

00:04:50.193 --> 00:04:53.565
 - 'Sunsational'! - I got the last one! 

00:04:53.834 --> 00:04:57.554
 Few people know, but 'Sun Tzu' 

00:04:57.554 --> 00:05:01.325
 [applause] More palms, more palms ... 

00:05:02.985 --> 00:05:07.747
 Few people know, but 'Sun Tzu' means 'guilty'! 

00:05:08.087 --> 00:05:10.568
 - 'Sun' is 'cul', and 'Tzu' is 'pado'! - Yes.
