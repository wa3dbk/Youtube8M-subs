00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:25.680

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.180
 you mother and of course 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.369
 can you do this recipe again without 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.189
 make thermomix then you would just 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.290
 the butter slightly warm in a pot 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.840
 I do it all now in thermomix 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:42.460
 while you put your butter in the pot or 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.860
 Thermomix can melt 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:48.210
 an apple ever so small 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:48.210
 his pieces as possible 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:02:00.799
 that comes to the melted butter 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:04.130
 egg yolk then you still have the choice 

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:06.530
 is like small now so you've got 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.509
 all ingredients are prepared so packed 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:11.000
 just everything if only at the tops 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:14.090
 or a thermomix and mixed 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.880
 the small chopped apple pieces the 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:19.810
 small chopped walnut kernels the 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:22.940
 ground or even coat your coat 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:26.390
 sugar substitute and last but not least the 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:28.220
 again cinnamon then be sure to 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.959
 the work surface and watch it all 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.880
 Also in the bowl is not so 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:34.880
 as I sometimes forget you things 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:37.220
 stir everything again nothing 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.930
 think about that in linx running sets 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:41.060
 that the whole thing is not cured only 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:43.610
 is mixed and then he is not already 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:46.760
 The oven has already finished 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:48.769
 eagerly at 150 degrees point air ahead 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:52.040
 and now I take my dough 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:56.090
 a good tablespoon of grabs him 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:59.239
 Just here on my baking sheet what you 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:01.640
 with a baking paper laid out 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:04.130
 I have 13 of my mass this time 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:06.950
 The piece should be 12 to 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:08.870
 13 pieces will be nice 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:12.319
 shape a little bit and then it's off 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:15.410
 in the oven at 150 degrees air circulation it goes 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:16.280
 now for about twelve to 15 minutes in 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:19.370
 the tube 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:22.519
 depending on how much more expensive open duration 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:25.130
 the whole twelve to fifteen minutes I have 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:26.780
 my now 15 minutes left in it and 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:28.519
 they are slowly needing to become them 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:30.410
 have also pretty much worked out 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:31.880
 how you see and stick but one 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:33.620
 little bit next to each other 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:35.569
 that is if you massa your cookies 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:37.609
 is definitely enough space 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:38.780
 in between that is absolutely necessary 

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:41.069
 cooling down 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:43.230
