00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.639
 Hello everyone on this occasion of what 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.679
 Let's talk in this new stage of 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.230
 ferry is going to be news 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.299
 who has reached the different blogs 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.779
 of the world of mystery makes scarce 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:21.210
 days and that speaks of a strange bible or 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:24.180
 a bible that could contain the 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.880
 gospel of bernabé and in which one is 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.920
 I would say a series of things that I could then 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.920
 as always happens in this type of 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.840
 findings could shake the 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.170
 foundations of the church and the foundations 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:40.170
 of Christianity itself no thanks that 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:43.680
 tell this news that it is treated as 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:46.110
 novel has its origins ago ago 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:51.600
 enough time specifically has 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:54.299
 origin on February 23, 2012 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.850
 here we can see the press cut 

00:00:54.299 --> 00:01:00.510
 original and here we can see the headline 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:03.600
 which the daily mail echoed 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.909
 online according to this bible is true 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.189
 that once 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:10.939
 that has been analyzed I have arrived at the 

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:12.859
 conclusion that it has 1500 years of 

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:15.740
 antiquity 

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:19.280
 this assumes this assumes that it would not be 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:22.250
 the original manuscript of the gospel of 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:24.829
 bernabé however if you talk about that 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:27.409
 the story that there is narrated a 

00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:30.409
 story that says things like that jesus 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:32.810
 of Nazareth did not die on the cross and also 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:35.780
 they say some things like that 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:39.439
 really jesus what he did was 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:41.750
 prophesying the arrival of mahoma vale 

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:46.099
 but as I say to be a dated bible 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:48.049
 1,500 years ago forgiveness is thought to be 

00:01:46.099 --> 00:01:51.799
 the person who could write it was a 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:53.850
 follower of this bernabé because 

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:55.470
 simply because bernabé 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:59.280
 he lived and this is pretty good 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:03.000
 documented in the 1st century then it is 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.950
 impossible that five centuries later then 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.770
 could write anything at all without 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.660
 However, some follower of yours could 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.920
 write but what are the 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.230
 implications what are the 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:16.800
 ramifications of all this because 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.930
 well what this does is that we 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.940
 retrotraigamos a little behind that 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.220
 let's get to the Council of Nicea a 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.140
 Council of Nicea in which there is another 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.480
 an event which to act 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.160
 for all of them who do not know for 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.720
 all of us is to say that it was a 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:34.380
 event an event in which 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:37.200
 decided that four gospels were going to 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:39.060
 be part of the new testament which 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.310
 they were going to be the four gospels 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:43.050
 canonicals that are known to this day 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.660
 which are those of mateo marcos lucas and juan 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:48.209
 It is worth saying that more information about 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.400
 this nicea council from the point of 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:51.840
 conspiracy view you can find it 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.269
 in the great book of santiago 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.430
 camacho twenty great conspiracies of 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:58.470
 the story of agreement there is narrated all 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.910
 a little bit this whole process but as I say 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.590
 everyone believes 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:03.570
 I the truth that personally too 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:06.090
 I join that theory that the four 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:08.760
 Gospels that were chosen because they were 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:11.070
 a little that best suited to the 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.050
 church itself is why so 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:15.480
 gospels like this one bernabé and 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:17.460
 so many others that have been appearing 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.700
 throughout history as they could 

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:23.490
 be purposely in the background for 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:27.330
 not hinder everything that is history 

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:31.200
 of Jesus worth here we see the images of 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:33.090
 this this manuscript a manuscript 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.340
 that as possible in this article is 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:39.180
 totally real here you will be able to see the 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:40.620
 news but that draws attention 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.500
 importance that always has the 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:45.120
 mysteries of the church a news that 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:48.120
 has its origin two years ago now 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:50.940
 revive more strongly than ever because of 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:52.410
 internet seems that the affairs of Jesus 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:54.690
 the affairs of the church and of the 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:57.780
 Christianity in general are always of 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:59.730
 fashion it so say that it has 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:01.650
 it seemed interesting this video the 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:03.750
 share on social networks you give 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:06.060
 I like to do any kind of 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:08.270
 comment since I will answer them all 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:11.970
 and that you follow the transporter point is 

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:13.380
 a blog that is is nothing other than 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:16.320
 the news of the mystery world 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:18.450
 but always from one point of view 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:21.419
 critical here we try not to be 

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:23.160
 not sensationalized would still 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:25.680
 bring news as attractive as this 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:28.230
 but always as you can see by going to 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:31.440
 the original sources are worth remember 

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:33.780
 the newspaper 'daily mail' the cut 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:37.710
 original press the original images 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:39.630
 and an extract of the news that came out in 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:41.700
 the press agree a picture of 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:43.979
 bernabé summarizing that they are not for their 

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:46.650
 dating can be the work of some 

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:48.840
 follower of his and he would say things like that 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:50.340
 Jesus did not die on the cross and like that 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:53.220
 Jesus what he really did was 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:57.110
 prophesy the arrival of mahoma de 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:57.110
 According greetings and see you soon
