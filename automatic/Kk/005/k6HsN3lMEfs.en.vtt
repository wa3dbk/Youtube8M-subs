about shovels that may sound pretty

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.820 
about shovels that may sound pretty
basic<00:00:09.179> and<00:00:09.750> you<00:00:09.840> might<00:00:09.960> be<00:00:10.110> thinking<00:00:10.139> they're

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
basic and you might be thinking they're

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.770

all<00:00:10.950> the<00:00:11.099> same<00:00:11.130> but<00:00:11.969> there's<00:00:12.150> more<00:00:12.300> to<00:00:12.420> picking

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
all the same but there's more to picking
