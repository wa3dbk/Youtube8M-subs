in a in a very cramped space I'm trying
to<00:01:50.369> learn<00:01:50.549> how<00:01:50.610> to<00:01:50.790> fly<00:01:50.939> it<00:01:51.060> but<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.540> graphics

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
to learn how to fly it but the graphics

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.050 
to learn how to fly it but the graphics
there<00:01:52.259> that<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:52.680> size<00:01:52.950> of<00:01:53.159> the<00:01:53.340> of<00:01:53.549> the<00:01:53.790> world

there that the size of the of the world

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.480 
there that the size of the of the world
that<00:01:54.390> it's<00:01:54.720> generating<00:01:55.380> and<00:01:55.530> even<00:01:56.070> more<00:01:56.250> so

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
that it's generating and even more so

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.429 
that it's generating and even more so
when<00:01:56.610> you<00:01:56.729> run<00:01:56.909> this<00:01:57.060> in<00:01:57.299> a<00:01:57.390> city<00:01:57.780> style

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
just twisting the the iPad around but

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.190

a<00:02:26.160> sketchbook<00:02:27.110> ink<00:02:28.110> now<00:02:28.800> it's<00:02:28.980> a<00:02:29.010> little<00:02:29.220> bit

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
a sketchbook ink now it's a little bit

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.460 
a sketchbook ink now it's a little bit
hard<00:02:29.490> to<00:02:29.550> use<00:02:29.730> actually<00:02:30.060> I<00:02:30.120> chose<00:02:30.780> on<00:02:30.990> the<00:02:31.320> left

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
hard to use actually I chose on the left

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:32.570 
hard to use actually I chose on the left
hand<00:02:31.620> side<00:02:31.710> there<00:02:31.950> are<00:02:31.980> different<00:02:32.340> brass

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
hand side there are different brass

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.310 
hand side there are different brass
which<00:02:32.820> actually<00:02:33.150> is<00:02:33.360> a<00:02:33.420> very<00:02:33.570> light<00:02:33.810> touch

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
which actually is a very light touch

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.410 
which actually is a very light touch
brush<00:02:34.710> once<00:02:35.460> you<00:02:35.580> get<00:02:35.700> to<00:02:35.730> use<00:02:35.910> it<00:02:35.940> you<00:02:36.120> realize

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
brush once you get to use it you realize

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.080 
brush once you get to use it you realize
that<00:02:36.710> it<00:02:37.710> has<00:02:37.800> a<00:02:37.860> very<00:02:38.130> good<00:02:38.190> recognition<00:02:38.640> of

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
that it has a very good recognition of

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.080 
that it has a very good recognition of
not<00:02:39.780> pressure<00:02:40.200> but<00:02:40.920> certainly<00:02:41.310> of<00:02:41.550> a<00:02:41.580> brush

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
not pressure but certainly of a brush

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.120 
not pressure but certainly of a brush
stroke<00:02:42.540> and<00:02:42.750> a<00:02:42.780> whole<00:02:43.080> stack<00:02:43.710> of<00:02:43.740> different

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
stroke and a whole stack of different

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.190 
stroke and a whole stack of different
brushes<00:02:44.340> there<00:02:44.670> and<00:02:45.660> they<00:02:45.750> did<00:02:45.900> a<00:02:45.930> live

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
brushes there and they did a live

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.320 
brushes there and they did a live
painting<00:02:46.920> demonstration<00:02:47.700> at<00:02:47.940> the<00:02:48.120> at<00:02:48.300> the

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
painting demonstration at the at the

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.990 
painting demonstration at the at the
launch<00:02:48.600> their<00:02:48.950> from<00:02:49.950> the<00:02:50.100> Autodesk<00:02:50.670> people

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
launch their from the Autodesk people

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.200 
launch their from the Autodesk people
but<00:02:51.150> a<00:02:51.540> really<00:02:51.990> good<00:02:52.230> example<00:02:52.320> of<00:02:52.830> of<00:02:53.580> using

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:54.210 
but a really good example of of using

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:56.060 
but a really good example of of using
the<00:02:54.300> graphics<00:02:54.780> power<00:02:54.990> again<00:02:55.410> which<00:02:55.950> is

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
the graphics power again which is

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:58.010 
the graphics power again which is
obviously<00:02:56.370> a<00:02:56.460> key<00:02:56.820> feature<00:02:57.060> of<00:02:57.300> the<00:02:57.510> new<00:02:57.630> iPad

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020 
obviously a key feature of the new iPad

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.350 
obviously a key feature of the new iPad
quickly<00:02:58.650> i<00:02:58.680> put<00:02:58.950> my<00:02:59.070> ipad<00:02:59.490> on<00:02:59.850> the<00:02:59.880> right<00:03:00.120> there

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
quickly i put my ipad on the right there

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.390 
quickly i put my ipad on the right there
the<00:03:00.510> ipad<00:03:00.960> that's<00:03:01.140> a<00:03:01.230> 3d<00:03:01.650> version<00:03:01.830> next<00:03:02.100> to<00:03:02.280> the

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
the ipad that's a 3d version next to the

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.640 
the ipad that's a 3d version next to the
the<00:03:03.030> new<00:03:03.150> ipad<00:03:03.540> very<00:03:04.080> hard<00:03:04.320> to<00:03:04.410> tell<00:03:04.560> the

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
the new ipad very hard to tell the

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.920 
the new ipad very hard to tell the
difference<00:03:04.680> the<00:03:05.310> camera<00:03:05.640> hole<00:03:06.120> is<00:03:06.360> tiny<00:03:06.660> bit

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
difference the camera hole is tiny bit

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.110 
difference the camera hole is tiny bit
bigger<00:03:07.310> but<00:03:08.310> apart<00:03:08.580> from<00:03:08.610> that<00:03:08.730> they<00:03:08.940> look

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
bigger but apart from that they look

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.630 
bigger but apart from that they look
almost<00:03:09.420> identical<00:03:10.040> now<00:03:11.040> this<00:03:11.160> is<00:03:11.220> a<00:03:11.340> look<00:03:11.460> at<00:03:11.550> I

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
almost identical now this is a look at I

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.130 
almost identical now this is a look at I
photo<00:03:11.910> again<00:03:12.210> going<00:03:12.390> back<00:03:12.480> into<00:03:12.690> iPhoto<00:03:13.050> and

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
photo again going back into iPhoto and

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.530 
photo again going back into iPhoto and
some<00:03:13.320> of<00:03:13.410> the<00:03:13.470> editing<00:03:13.800> effects<00:03:14.100> so<00:03:14.700> you<00:03:15.450> know

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
some of the editing effects so you know

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.630 
some of the editing effects so you know
entering<00:03:15.930> into<00:03:16.050> an<00:03:16.200> album<00:03:16.500> choosing<00:03:17.340> a<00:03:17.430> photo

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
entering into an album choosing a photo

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:18.860 
entering into an album choosing a photo
and<00:03:17.820> then<00:03:17.940> there's<00:03:18.150> just<00:03:18.360> some<00:03:18.510> some

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
and then there's just some some

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.990 
and then there's just some some
unbelievably<00:03:19.440> simple<00:03:19.800> but<00:03:20.730> powerful
