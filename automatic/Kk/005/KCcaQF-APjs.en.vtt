00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:11.810

in<00:00:10.019> the<00:00:10.559> Dominican<00:00:11.010> Republic<00:00:11.040> again<00:00:11.670> this

in the Dominican Republic again this

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.789 
in the Dominican Republic again this
time<00:00:12.059> I<00:00:12.360> just<00:00:12.809> got<00:00:12.960> back<00:00:13.139> from<00:00:13.170> the<00:00:13.440> X<00:00:13.590> Fighters

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
time I just got back from the X Fighters

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.039 
time I just got back from the X Fighters
in<00:00:14.099> Cairo<00:00:14.309> which<00:00:14.639> was<00:00:14.790> really<00:00:14.940> fun<00:00:15.030> and<00:00:15.389> it<00:00:16.020> was

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
in Cairo which was really fun and it was

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.260 
in Cairo which was really fun and it was
pretty<00:00:16.320> crazy<00:00:17.250> event<00:00:17.699> because<00:00:17.940> they<00:00:18.090> actually

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
pretty crazy event because they actually

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.090 
pretty crazy event because they actually
had<00:00:18.690> it<00:00:18.810> on<00:00:18.930> the<00:00:19.080> plateau<00:00:19.410> right<00:00:19.710> in<00:00:19.800> front<00:00:20.010> of

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
had it on the plateau right in front of

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.710 
had it on the plateau right in front of
the<00:00:20.189> pyramids<00:00:20.580> and<00:00:20.730> I<00:00:21.119> guess<00:00:21.390> that<00:00:21.570> was<00:00:21.689> the

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
the pyramids and I guess that was the

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.060 
the pyramids and I guess that was the
first<00:00:22.020> time<00:00:22.170> ever<00:00:22.380> they<00:00:22.650> were<00:00:22.710> allowed<00:00:23.010> to

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
first time ever they were allowed to

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.950 
first time ever they were allowed to
light<00:00:23.670> up<00:00:23.820> the<00:00:23.850> pyramid<00:00:24.119> made<00:00:24.570> it<00:00:24.720> really

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
light up the pyramid made it really

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:38.500 
light up the pyramid made it really
really<00:00:25.109> spectacular

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:38.510 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:44.970 

Oh

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:44.980 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.799 

the<00:00:45.980> reason<00:00:46.309> I<00:00:46.399> went<00:00:46.579> to<00:00:46.730> Cairo<00:00:46.969> was<00:00:47.300> to<00:00:47.660> do<00:00:47.780> a

00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:47.809 
the reason I went to Cairo was to do a

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:50.560 
the reason I went to Cairo was to do a
TV<00:00:48.260> show<00:00:48.410> for<00:00:48.829> red<00:00:48.980> bull<00:00:49.010> and<00:00:49.309> it<00:00:50.269> was<00:00:50.449> pretty

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:50.570 
TV show for red bull and it was pretty

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:52.840 
TV show for red bull and it was pretty
cool<00:00:50.780> because<00:00:50.960> if<00:00:51.860> you're<00:00:52.100> part<00:00:52.309> of<00:00:52.370> the<00:00:52.489> media

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:52.850 
cool because if you're part of the media

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:54.459 
cool because if you're part of the media
crew<00:00:53.089> you<00:00:53.390> get<00:00:53.539> these<00:00:53.690> backstage<00:00:54.170> passes
