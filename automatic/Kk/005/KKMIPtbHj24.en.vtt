 why not because it went very well 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.410
 I was not alone in Monthey 

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:41.170
 the next morning 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:43.960
 for that I do not understand why he is there 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.960
 for the others 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.019
 the cell

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.150
 hard that most of them by the side 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.390
 a positive note 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.480
 look at the agreement reached 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.670
 slightly tense than always feeling a little 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.670
 do it 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.800

 I hesitate between life and death 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.289

00:03:07.289 --> 00:03:10.109
 worse for those who can please you 

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:13.109
