sir

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:02.600 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.830 

actually<00:03:03.350> this<00:03:04.090> program<00:03:05.090> I<00:03:05.270> think<00:03:05.390> it's<00:03:05.750> a

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
actually this program I think it's a

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.710 
actually this program I think it's a
great<00:03:06.380> step<00:03:06.710> forward<00:03:07.010> from<00:03:07.460> the<00:03:07.610> previous<00:03:08.450> one

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
great step forward from the previous one

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:16.510 
great step forward from the previous one
which<00:03:08.990> was<00:03:09.230> to<00:03:09.470> the<00:03:09.560> music<00:03:09.860> if<00:03:10.010> I<00:03:10.130> were<00:03:10.310> king

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:16.520 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:19.930 

but<00:03:17.090> it<00:03:17.210> still<00:03:17.510> lacks<00:03:17.810> a<00:03:18.080> little<00:03:18.230> punch<00:03:18.940> music

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
but it still lacks a little punch music

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.660 
but it still lacks a little punch music
is<00:03:20.090> so<00:03:20.330> much<00:03:20.360> a<00:03:20.660> part<00:03:21.080> of<00:03:21.260> a<00:03:21.380> program<00:03:21.670> for

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:22.670 
is so much a part of a program for

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:31.610 
is so much a part of a program for
skating

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.710
