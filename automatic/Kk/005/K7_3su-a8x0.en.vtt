00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
 let's salute all this spectrum need 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.759
 of water for a new video 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.830
 after a year of waiting is so 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.090
 today I am accompanied by my 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.000
 friend pixo age 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.620
 hello to you that of the world is so 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.580
 today we will present you a 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:19.439
 new farming strategy so we 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.840
 will explain this in three steps 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.260
 so go ahead summarize had taken three 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.060
 steps 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.140
 so these three steps so that will be 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.869
 it will start with an introduction 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.820
 so the presentation here is the annunciation of 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.380
 pretty much our plan all that stuff 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.610
 trophies and troops and spells 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.640
 that must be used for this method 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:39.300
 is also how to attack and we will end 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.190
 by a small conclusion with this is the 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.780
 summary of everything that happened during 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.640
 this idea finally a little attacker he 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.350
 so is one for now she's you 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.469
 see I'm still in black mamba 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.890
 always after a year for and so I 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.210
 presented an opinion you make your village 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.440
 so that's not it and if you're going to talk a 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.629
 how much of how long since 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:01.350
 of low dressing time I've been playing since 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:04.019
 pretty much we'll say surely one year 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:07.530
 so pretty much so I started so a 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:09.869
 soon after spectral is against me 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.220
 I'm really not very much going to say 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.200
 that he me about once a day 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.180
 to harvest my resources but hey 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.890
 here I am not very game not very very 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.920
 strong in the game here I am a simple 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.360
 little player like that here and me 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.470
 it was a bit like this lately 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.270
 but since I found this 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.040
 strategy it made me want to play 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.780
 to cash flow of one because I have not 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.680
 need to log in all the time and 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.570
 then I still earn resources 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:35.729
 and I manage to put open Dene 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.329
 to work because there he goes out 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.950
 not unemployed 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.720
 and for ten years at the price so there I 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.299
 launched all my animal tests 8 have 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.670
 like me it's not bad, but that's it 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.680
 so now I would like to clarify that 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.250
 this method I never used and 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.780
 I will ask questions at spectral 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:54.000
 exactly as you questions that 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.810
 surely you ask so that will be the 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.369
 titles of this video 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:01.550
 so here's madam now we're going to 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:05.060
 tell around how many trophies 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:07.550
 just stay around thank you 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:12.220
 besides for the really around the 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:15.650
 1000 8900 trophy so 1950 is good 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:17.210
 1925 it's even better and I would like to 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.010
 just say something about a 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:21.320
 another farming method that was the one 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.960
 to drop below his trophy 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:25.400
 so you know this euro but their 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.530
 fruit but well here we will tell you it 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.480
 reigns people have not even but it's a 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.160
 good people that that it says that in 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.260
 below them the trophy finds that 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.400
 parties to 200 miles be that is 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.440
 absolutely wrong 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:39.710
 we tried ourselves indeed we 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:42.170
 just lost time and so that's it 

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:44.590
 now i will tell you that it is 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:47.540
 what too much to use first of all 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.770
 used the dragon crowds so that 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:53.960
 dragons all you have in the 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:56.360
 reservations and so with a combination of 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:57.890
 spells that pretty classic but good who 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.020
 is like very effective so three nights 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:01.820
 storm and healing spells so the 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:03.890
 three thunderstorm nights to allow 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:05.600
 dragons to come back from a village then he 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:07.970
 is sure to cure my problem will tell 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:10.520
 just that debated issues 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:12.739
 to help our neighbors say 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:15.080
 so yes so it's me for example I 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:16.730
 wonder I liked dragon his level 3 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:18.080
 and I wonder if the technique is 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.959
 also effective with work at 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:22.610
 level 3 or level 2 that's why 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:24.110
 a standard attack to try to 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:26.330
 to make a beautiful one anyway 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:27.350
 attack since it is profitable especially 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:29.810
 the price of dragons which is still 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:31.700
 quite high in matter is fine for 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:32.720
 answer your question simply 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.030
 not fair 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.170
 I had my huge at level 4 13 according to 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:39.770
 what I advance to the choice not at all 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:41.270
 with and so before before ten years at 

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:43.100
 level 4 I started this technique 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:45.920
 farming and it worked to tell the truth 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:47.540
 extracted very well and so so that's 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.920
 for that I 'm going to try climb and 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.540
 then it works even better of course 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:52.430
 to be at 4th May level with the dragons 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:55.220
 level 3 already it's already enough 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:57.200
 powerful and even better when you 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:59.720
 have the military camps quite high 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:01.010
 but after all is relative you if you 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.450
 do not have a lot of dragon 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:04.550
 attack villages a little less strong 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:04.970
 but still enough with a lot of 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:07.810
 resources 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:09.880
 So here we go now 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:14.319
 entered as in attack and what to do 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:15.010
 a little alips for the time of 

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:16.930
 find a part 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:18.489
 By the way, the time to find a 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:20.049
 exit is quite variable sometimes we 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:21.489
 can find right away or after 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:23.830
 one hundred thousand slamming in the search 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:25.180
 but hey it's very grateful to his 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.500
 friend maybe you could even 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:26.950
 show a little quick replay of a 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.139
 attack 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:31.000
 yeah you did well yeah but I would put 

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:32.260
 in accelerated editing because I know 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.730
 that it's not the most exciting two 

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:36.850
 time in the name I can put in accelerated 

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:38.320
 d1 such that in general there 

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:39.550
 revolves around 300 miles but hey there 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.750
 I did a lot of attacked fame is 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:43.389
 usually 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:45.220
 that's reassuring it sent him I 

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:46.270
 attacked a guy who still had the 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:48.340
 water items 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.840
 good it usually takes to avoid the 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:53.139
 tomorrow the best is to attack the 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:54.880
 ages dvd hd v8 but i like to be a tale 

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:57.430
 accelerated see that I used a 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:59.580
 first rage spell bar here 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:02.229
 that they reach in the heart of the village 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:02.590
 so I took this pierce anyway 

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:04.870
 not bad 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:07.389
 yeah yeah and despite the turning 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:08.919
 do and company I still beat 

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:09.850
 could have attacked better but hey I 

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:12.729
 so had three months in duotone 

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:14.350
 black and you use your kings and queens 

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:16.630
 here I forgot to specify and castles 

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:20.080
 plan of course it's even better so 

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:21.550
 here and so now I'm going to do 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:22.930
 a little live striker so we get 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:24.850
 found right after when I found 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:26.650
 the part everyone will see if you 

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:29.410
 actually show I did a little fail 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:31.060
 I like being filmed these attacks 

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:33.460
 I'm sorry, I want what 

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:35.970
 want to show in slow motion so here 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:38.380
 it's this one a minute ago 

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:41.289
 so this is this time I am 

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:42.669
 fell on a village that was where 

00:05:41.289 --> 00:05:44.800
 were all in the mine a player 

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:46.120
 who plays more finally yet there was 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:48.820
 even a skull but the city 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:50.560
 so here I put my my line and of 

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:52.210
 sheets against his strategy received from the wood 

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:54.160
 to 0 to reindeer behind who are covered 

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:56.200
 and take no damage then the 

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:57.669
 first layer of sordo rage when they 

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:59.889
 make a village - serves to validate a 

00:05:57.669 --> 00:06:01.330
 village easy to attack heal you 

00:05:59.889 --> 00:06:04.960
 eat me I used that a spell of 

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:06.370
 care and I put gears of and you 

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:07.810
 see we generalize now two or 

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:11.260
 three small groups they sweep everything 

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:13.450
 last night like that so here I go 

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:15.760
 make a 100% finally normal comes 

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:17.500
 buy not very hard attack you see 

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:19.340
 that my king is still almost a crowd 

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:20.840
 godmother life I know the 

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:22.580
 she is where such three quarters of 

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:24.800
 his life but it's very effective 

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:27.290
 however, I would rather advise you 

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:30.290
 to go up around half-way 

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:31.760
 trophy because it's a lot more 

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:36.080
 easy to find parts and sam 

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:37.880
 sarr how to say that removes all all 

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:39.560
 the bad players finally the players 

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:40.820
 who know not very well played and who 

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:42.680
 do not have a lot of resources to 

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:43.580
 to propose 

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:46.280
 so now I 'm going to show you 

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:47.540
 finally we'll show you the tacc two 

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:49.790
 peaks at hajj that did it at the same time 

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:50.870
 that a replacement iphone he calls in 

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:52.990
 same time Nazis I leave you to 

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:52.990
 nobody 

00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:58.010
 like what we can fall on duet on 

00:06:55.910 --> 00:07:00.050
 big and besides we advise you to 

00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:02.479
 go up to 2002 trophy it's imperative 

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:04.070
