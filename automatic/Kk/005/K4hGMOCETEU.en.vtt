expected a bump in technical specs but I

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.060 
expected a bump in technical specs but I
don't<00:01:06.390> think<00:01:06.600> one<00:01:06.780> was<00:01:06.960> necessarily<00:01:07.530> needed

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
don't think one was necessarily needed

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.670 
don't think one was necessarily needed
as<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.610> 920<00:01:09.180> was<00:01:09.420> a<00:01:09.450> very<00:01:09.720> snappy<00:01:10.020> device<00:01:10.439> and

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
as the 920 was a very snappy device and

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.670 
as the 920 was a very snappy device and
the<00:01:11.040> 925<00:01:11.670> will<00:01:11.939> be<00:01:12.090> as<00:01:12.299> well<00:01:12.570> keeping<00:01:13.439> the<00:01:13.560> old

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
the 925 will be as well keeping the old

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.649 
the 925 will be as well keeping the old
hardware<00:01:14.100> also<00:01:14.490> allowed<00:01:14.760> Nokia<00:01:15.210> to<00:01:15.360> have<00:01:15.509> the

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
hardware also allowed Nokia to have the

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:16.999 
hardware also allowed Nokia to have the
same<00:01:15.840> two<00:01:16.049> thousand<00:01:16.439> million<00:01:16.710> power<00:01:16.920> battery

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
same two thousand million power battery

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.730 
same two thousand million power battery
on<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.640> 925<00:01:18.299> and<00:01:18.540> that's<00:01:18.960> enough<00:01:19.290> to<00:01:19.470> get<00:01:19.619> the

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
on the 925 and that's enough to get the

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.679 
on the 925 and that's enough to get the
phone<00:01:19.920> through<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.280> day<00:01:20.430> alright<00:01:21.270> so<00:01:21.450> how

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
phone through the day alright so how

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.810 
phone through the day alright so how
does<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:22.020> 925<00:01:22.619> compared<00:01:23.009> to<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.280> iphone<00:01:23.400> 5

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
does the 925 compared to the iphone 5

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.660 
does the 925 compared to the iphone 5
well<00:01:24.540> first<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.320> iphone<00:01:25.710> is<00:01:25.740> a<00:01:25.920> smaller<00:01:26.369> and

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
well first the iphone is a smaller and

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.580 
well first the iphone is a smaller and
lighter<00:01:26.880> device<00:01:27.420> so<00:01:27.990> it<00:01:28.020> might<00:01:28.320> be<00:01:28.350> more

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
lighter device so it might be more

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.380 
lighter device so it might be more
comfortable<00:01:28.650> to<00:01:29.250> use<00:01:29.430> than<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:29.670> nokia<00:01:30.150> for

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
comfortable to use than the nokia for

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.569 
comfortable to use than the nokia for
many<00:01:30.630> of<00:01:30.810> us<00:01:30.960> aesthetically<00:01:31.890> both<00:01:32.280> devices

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
many of us aesthetically both devices

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.399 
many of us aesthetically both devices
are<00:01:32.790> gorgeous<00:01:33.360> and<00:01:33.509> it's<00:01:33.750> up<00:01:33.869> to<00:01:33.990> you<00:01:34.079> to<00:01:34.110> pick

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
are gorgeous and it's up to you to pick

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.740 
are gorgeous and it's up to you to pick
which<00:01:34.619> one<00:01:34.829> you<00:01:34.979> like<00:01:35.189> best<00:01:35.430> of<00:01:35.670> course<00:01:36.420> there

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
which one you like best of course there

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.780 
which one you like best of course there
is<00:01:36.869> a<00:01:36.900> smaller<00:01:37.350> 4-inch<00:01:37.829> screen<00:01:37.979> on<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:38.430> iPhone

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
is a smaller 4-inch screen on the iPhone

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.090 
is a smaller 4-inch screen on the iPhone
hence<00:01:39.240> it's<00:01:39.450> more<00:01:39.630> compact<00:01:39.990> body<00:01:40.200> but<00:01:40.829> it's<00:01:40.979> a

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
hence it's more compact body but it's a

pros and shortcomings however the s4

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.170

packs the larger 5 inch display with
1080p<00:03:34.750> resolution<00:03:35.440> so<00:03:35.829> it<00:03:35.979> is<00:03:36.099> the<00:03:36.220> sharper<00:03:36.639> of

00:03:36.719 --> 00:03:36.729 
1080p resolution so it is the sharper of

1080p resolution so it is the sharper of
the<00:03:36.879> two<00:03:37.090> yes<00:03:37.810> it<00:03:38.049> does<00:03:38.109> use<00:03:38.409> a<00:03:38.440> pentile<00:03:38.889> matrix

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
the two yes it does use a pentile matrix

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:41.369 
the two yes it does use a pentile matrix
but<00:03:39.579> that<00:03:39.760> shouldn't<00:03:40.000> matter<00:03:40.209> much<00:03:40.540> of<00:03:40.780> course

00:03:41.369 --> 00:03:41.379
