installed<00:01:04.619> four-point-oh<00:01:05.339> with<00:01:06.020> ok<00:01:07.020> so<00:01:07.080> if

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
installed four-point-oh with ok so if

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.620 
installed four-point-oh with ok so if
you<00:01:07.860> don't<00:01:07.979> have<00:01:08.220> one<00:01:09.119> then<00:01:11.299> you<00:01:12.299> need<00:01:12.479> to

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
you don't have one then you need to

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.940 
you don't have one then you need to
unload<00:01:13.200> them<00:01:13.560> one<00:01:14.400> and<00:01:14.700> i<00:01:15.119> think<00:01:15.860> that<00:01:16.860> you

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
unload them one and i think that you

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.499 
unload them one and i think that you
might<00:01:17.130> need<00:01:17.280> to<00:01:17.430> use<00:01:17.610> some<00:01:18.259> the<00:01:19.259> 4.0<00:01:19.799> firmware

00:01:20.499 --> 00:01:20.509 
might need to use some the 4.0 firmware

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:23.060 
might need to use some the 4.0 firmware
with<00:01:21.509> an<00:01:21.630> earlier<00:01:21.930> betta<00:01:22.170> butts<00:01:22.619> i'm<00:01:22.799> not<00:01:22.950> sure

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
with an earlier betta butts i'm not sure

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.620 
with an earlier betta butts i'm not sure
about<00:01:23.189> that<00:01:23.430> you<00:01:23.970> know<00:01:24.060> I<00:01:24.090> just<00:01:24.180> pause<00:01:24.509> the

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
about that you know I just pause the

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.320 
about that you know I just pause the
video<00:01:24.750> on<00:01:25.049> it<00:01:25.200> well<00:01:25.500> I<00:01:25.530> find<00:01:25.890> it<00:01:26.100> and<00:01:26.759> be<00:01:26.880> using

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
video on it well I find it and be using

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.670 
video on it well I find it and be using
the<00:01:27.540> GM<00:01:29.299> ok<00:01:30.299> so<00:01:30.360> as<00:01:30.509> you<00:01:30.600> can<00:01:30.720> see<00:01:30.869> FM<00:01:31.170> found<00:01:31.500> it

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
the GM ok so as you can see FM found it

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:37.210 
the GM ok so as you can see FM found it
here<00:01:31.890> MZ<00:01:32.640> a<00:01:33.180> meter<00:01:33.810> just<00:01:33.990> open<00:01:34.409> it<00:01:34.500> some<00:01:35.009> and

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:37.220 
here MZ a meter just open it some and

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.270 
here MZ a meter just open it some and
once<00:01:38.900> first<00:01:39.900> of<00:01:40.020> all<00:01:40.079> is<00:01:40.229> a<00:01:40.380> processing<00:01:41.009> from

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
once first of all is a processing from

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.880 
once first of all is a processing from
where<00:01:41.460> ok<00:01:42.390> so<00:01:42.450> think<00:01:42.780> what<00:01:43.079> it<00:01:43.500> does<00:01:43.680> is<00:01:43.799> it

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
where ok so think what it does is it

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.080 
where ok so think what it does is it
then<00:01:44.070> decrypts<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:44.670> firmware

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
then decrypts the firmware

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.410 
then decrypts the firmware
so<00:01:48.090> when<00:01:48.890> what<00:01:49.890> you<00:01:49.920> need<00:01:50.130> to<00:01:50.250> do<00:01:50.370> is<00:01:50.490> you<00:01:51.390> need

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
so when what you need to do is you need

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.460 
so when what you need to do is you need
to<00:01:51.570> go<00:01:51.810> to<00:01:52.460> settings<00:01:53.660> your<00:01:54.660> ipod<00:01:54.960> touch<00:01:55.140> just

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
to go to settings your ipod touch just

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:03.140 
to go to settings your ipod touch just
check<00:01:55.740> if<00:01:55.890> it's<00:01:56.040> a<00:01:56.840> fixed<00:01:58.490> model<00:02:01.190> he<00:02:02.190> needs<00:02:02.430> go

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:03.150 
check if it's a fixed model he needs go

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:12.230 
check if it's a fixed model he needs go
to<00:02:03.210> in<00:02:03.660> general<00:02:04.080> and<00:02:05.780> about<00:02:07.250> and<00:02:09.590> some<00:02:11.240> here

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240 
to in general and about and some here

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:17.510 
to in general and about and some here
shows<00:02:13.020> that<00:02:13.200> it's<00:02:13.380> not<00:02:13.530> an<00:02:13.650> MC<00:02:14.010> model<00:02:14.480> so<00:02:16.520> this

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
shows that it's not an MC model so this

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.820 
shows that it's not an MC model so this
would<00:02:17.700> work<00:02:18.440> so<00:02:19.440> now<00:02:20.130> you<00:02:20.190> need<00:02:20.370> click<00:02:20.550> no<00:02:21.330> and

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
would work so now you need click no and

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.790 
would work so now you need click no and
you<00:02:22.830> need<00:02:22.980> to<00:02:23.040> click<00:02:23.190> Next<00:02:24.410> it<00:02:25.410> will<00:02:25.530> connect

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
you need to click Next it will connect

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.560 
you need to click Next it will connect
to<00:02:25.860> that<00:02:26.010> I'm<00:02:26.160> Apple<00:02:26.580> servers<00:02:27.260> so<00:02:28.260> what<00:02:28.440> can<00:02:28.620> I

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:29.570 
to that I'm Apple servers so what can I

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:31.880 
to that I'm Apple servers so what can I
think<00:02:30.570> it's<00:02:30.750> so<00:02:31.050> that<00:02:31.200> it<00:02:31.320> can<00:02:31.500> kind<00:02:31.800> of

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
think it's so that it can kind of

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.570 
think it's so that it can kind of
upgrades<00:02:32.310> your<00:02:33.300> ipod<00:02:33.570> touch<00:02:33.810> so<00:02:34.020> firmware<00:02:34.580> is

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
upgrades your ipod touch so firmware is

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.320

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:53.050 

ok<00:03:49.110> so<00:03:49.170> it's<00:03:49.380> conceits<00:03:49.740> jailbreaking<00:03:50.430> now<00:03:51.110> and

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:53.060 
ok so it's conceits jailbreaking now and

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:57.590 
ok so it's conceits jailbreaking now and
by<00:03:54.060> the<00:03:54.120> way<00:03:54.300> um<00:03:55.070> if<00:03:56.070> you<00:03:56.190> update<00:03:56.310> to<00:03:56.610> 4.0<00:03:57.060> then

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
you'll need to UM weights when you

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.870 
you'll need to UM weights when you
