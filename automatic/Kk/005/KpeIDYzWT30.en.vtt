00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:35.830 
new quality but you know it's still good

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:38.970 
new quality but you know it's still good
stuff<00:00:36.100> and<00:00:36.820> I'll<00:00:37.269> be<00:00:37.540> saving<00:00:37.780> up<00:00:37.989> matches<00:00:38.440> for

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:38.980 
stuff and I'll be saving up matches for

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:40.920 
stuff and I'll be saving up matches for
you<00:00:39.370> know<00:00:39.489> the<00:00:39.640> next<00:00:39.910> couple<00:00:40.390> of<00:00:40.540> weeks<00:00:40.750> that

you know the next couple of weeks that

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:43.200 
you know the next couple of weeks that
way<00:00:41.199> uh<00:00:41.400> everything<00:00:42.400> from<00:00:42.580> that<00:00:42.699> long<00:00:42.940> will<00:00:43.089> be

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.869 
way uh everything from that long will be
great<00:00:43.570> quality<00:00:44.080> so<00:00:44.890> using<00:00:45.190> the<00:00:45.250> p90<00:00:45.730> and<00:00:45.850> I

00:00:45.869 --> 00:00:45.879 
great quality so using the p90 and I

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:48.570 
great quality so using the p90 and I
really<00:00:46.120> want<00:00:46.269> to<00:00:46.360> try<00:00:46.540> using<00:00:46.690> p<00:00:47.019> 90<00:00:47.379> or<00:00:47.589> any<00:00:48.100> sog

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:48.580 
really want to try using p 90 or any sog

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:51.810 
really want to try using p 90 or any sog
and<00:00:48.879> a<00:00:48.940> game<00:00:49.089> type<00:00:49.269> other<00:00:49.420> than<00:00:50.729> domination<00:00:51.729> or

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:51.820 
and a game type other than domination or

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:53.070 
and a game type other than domination or
free-for-all<00:00:52.239> they<00:00:52.540> seem<00:00:52.720> to<00:00:52.839> be<00:00:52.930> a<00:00:52.960> lot

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:53.080 
free-for-all they seem to be a lot

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.859 
free-for-all they seem to be a lot
easier<00:00:53.140> to<00:00:53.500> use<00:00:53.739> the<00:00:53.920> submachine<00:00:54.820> guns<00:00:55.089> in<00:00:55.239> so

00:00:55.859 --> 00:00:55.869 
easier to use the submachine guns in so

00:00:55.869 --> 00:00:58.259 
easier to use the submachine guns in so
I<00:00:55.900> jumped<00:00:56.290> to<00:00:56.379> a<00:00:56.409> team<00:00:56.619> deathmatch<00:00:56.979> and<00:00:57.280> try<00:00:58.210> to

00:00:58.259 --> 00:00:58.269 
I jumped to a team deathmatch and try to

00:00:58.269 --> 00:00:59.609 
I jumped to a team deathmatch and try to
have<00:00:58.420> some<00:00:58.540> fun<00:00:58.600> with<00:00:58.869> the<00:00:58.930> try<00:00:59.140> and<00:00:59.320> I<00:00:59.379> use<00:00:59.589> it

00:00:59.609 --> 00:00:59.619 
have some fun with the try and I use it

00:00:59.619 --> 00:01:02.039 
have some fun with the try and I use it
well<00:00:59.890> because<00:01:00.250> the<00:01:00.790> t-nut<00:01:01.150> match<00:01:01.330> spawns<00:01:01.690> are

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:02.049 
well because the t-nut match spawns are

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:05.640 
well because the t-nut match spawns are
advantageous<00:01:02.409> when<00:01:03.040> using<00:01:04.000> the<00:01:04.650> assault

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:05.650 
advantageous when using the assault

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:07.710 
advantageous when using the assault
rifles<00:01:05.979> in<00:01:06.100> the<00:01:06.159> game<00:01:06.310> just<00:01:06.580> because<00:01:06.729> you're

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:07.720 
rifles in the game just because you're

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.210 
rifles in the game just because you're
never<00:01:07.930> going<00:01:08.409> to<00:01:08.439> spawn<00:01:08.650> close<00:01:08.890> to<00:01:09.010> each<00:01:09.130> other

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:09.220 
never going to spawn close to each other

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:10.380 
never going to spawn close to each other
and<00:01:09.430> team<00:01:09.580> deathmatch<00:01:09.909> or<00:01:10.060> really<00:01:10.270> you

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:10.390 
and team deathmatch or really you

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.710 
and team deathmatch or really you
shouldn't<00:01:11.729> at<00:01:12.729> least<00:01:12.880> in<00:01:13.000> ecology<00:01:13.299> for<00:01:13.540> the

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:13.720 
shouldn't at least in ecology for the

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.109 
shouldn't at least in ecology for the
saloons<00:01:13.990> phone<00:01:14.200> systems<00:01:14.560> work<00:01:14.770> so<00:01:15.580> to<00:01:15.640> use<00:01:15.939> an

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:16.119 
saloons phone systems work so to use an

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:18.240 
saloons phone systems work so to use an
SMG<00:01:16.390> and<00:01:16.810> get<00:01:17.110> a<00:01:17.140> good<00:01:17.290> score<00:01:17.439> is<00:01:17.830> a<00:01:17.860> lot<00:01:18.070> harder

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.250 
SMG and get a good score is a lot harder

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:19.469 
SMG and get a good score is a lot harder
for<00:01:18.520> the<00:01:18.579> team<00:01:18.759> deathmatches<00:01:19.179> and<00:01:19.450> I

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:19.479 
for the team deathmatches and I

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:20.789 
for the team deathmatches and I
completely<00:01:19.750> understand<00:01:20.409> why<00:01:20.560> a<00:01:20.590> lot<00:01:20.740> of

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:20.799 
completely understand why a lot of

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:23.520 
completely understand why a lot of
people<00:01:20.890> don't<00:01:21.250> think<00:01:21.929> the<00:01:22.929> submachine<00:01:23.259> guns

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.530 
people don't think the submachine guns

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:25.410 
people don't think the submachine guns
are<00:01:23.710> as<00:01:23.799> powerful<00:01:24.250> as<00:01:24.460> there<00:01:24.640> were<00:01:24.820> in<00:01:24.850> custody

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:25.420 
are as powerful as there were in custody

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.560 
are as powerful as there were in custody
for<00:01:26.189> that<00:01:27.189> that<00:01:27.729> statement<00:01:27.969> definitely<00:01:28.450> has<00:01:28.539> a

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:28.570 
for that that statement definitely has a

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:30.029 
for that that statement definitely has a
lot<00:01:28.750> of<00:01:28.780> merit<00:01:29.109> to<00:01:29.259> it<00:01:29.289> but<00:01:29.679> it's<00:01:29.890> not<00:01:30.009> a

00:01:30.029 --> 00:01:30.039 
lot of merit to it but it's not a

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:31.739 
lot of merit to it but it's not a
hundred<00:01:30.249> percent<00:01:30.369> true<00:01:30.850> in<00:01:31.450> a<00:01:31.570> lot<00:01:31.600> of

00:01:31.739 --> 00:01:31.749 
hundred percent true in a lot of

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:33.539 
hundred percent true in a lot of
situations<00:01:31.990> the<00:01:32.530> e<00:01:32.560> so<00:01:32.920> machines<00:01:33.280> are<00:01:33.399> better

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:33.549 
situations the e so machines are better

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:36.760 
situations the e so machines are better
so<00:01:34.240> you<00:01:34.630> know<00:01:34.749> let's<00:01:35.520> see

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
so you know let's see

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.429 
so you know let's see
how<00:01:37.369> I<00:01:37.399> decided<00:01:38.149> to<00:01:38.240> use<00:01:38.270> them<00:01:38.539> how<00:01:39.049> you<00:01:39.109> guys

how I decided to use them how you guys

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:41.679 
how I decided to use them how you guys
can<00:01:39.710> hopefully<00:01:39.979> use<00:01:40.369> them<00:01:40.549> in<00:01:40.729> order<00:01:41.030> to<00:01:41.149> be<00:01:41.659> a

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:41.689 
can hopefully use them in order to be a

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:45.279 
can hopefully use them in order to be a
better<00:01:42.079> sub<00:01:42.380> machine<00:01:42.619> gunner<00:01:42.979> I<00:01:44.289> immediately

causes the response to flip and that's

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.720 
causes the response to flip and that's
exactly<00:02:11.329> that's<00:02:12.140> kind<00:02:12.620> of<00:02:12.680> what<00:02:12.860> i<00:02:12.890> did<00:02:13.160> i<00:02:13.310> took

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
advantage of that by doing the same

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.229 
advantage of that by doing the same
thing<00:02:15.380> that<00:02:15.530> they<00:02:15.650> did<00:02:15.709> only<00:02:16.579> I<00:02:16.610> was<00:02:16.849> aware<00:02:17.180> of

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:17.239 
thing that they did only I was aware of

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:18.580

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
what they were doing and they were not

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.589 
what they were doing and they were not
aware<00:02:18.739> of<00:02:18.890> what<00:02:19.099> I<00:02:19.190> was<00:02:19.340> doing<00:02:19.610> so<00:02:20.090> I<00:02:20.120> knew

00:02:20.589 --> 00:02:20.599 
aware of what I was doing so I knew

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:22.270 
aware of what I was doing so I knew
going<00:02:21.019> into<00:02:21.290> their<00:02:21.500> spawn<00:02:21.799> that<00:02:22.069> they<00:02:22.190> were

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
going into their spawn that they were

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.460 
going into their spawn that they were
going<00:02:22.459> to<00:02:22.579> most<00:02:22.880> likely<00:02:22.970> end<00:02:23.420> up<00:02:23.569> towards<00:02:24.290> my

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
going to most likely end up towards my

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.460 
going to most likely end up towards my
spawn<00:02:24.829> if<00:02:25.069> not<00:02:25.370> in<00:02:25.610> my<00:02:25.849> spot<00:02:26.120> so<00:02:26.989> that's<00:02:27.290> what<00:02:27.410> I

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
spawn if not in my spot so that's what I

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.199 
spawn if not in my spot so that's what I
did<00:02:27.500> and<00:02:27.680> I<00:02:28.069> was<00:02:28.190> kind<00:02:28.400> of<00:02:28.519> surrounded<00:02:28.970> here

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:29.209 
did and I was kind of surrounded here

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:30.400 
did and I was kind of surrounded here
not<00:02:29.390> surrounded<00:02:29.690> but<00:02:29.780> I<00:02:29.840> knew<00:02:30.079> that<00:02:30.260> they<00:02:30.349> were

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
not surrounded but I knew that they were

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:31.809 
not surrounded but I knew that they were
spawning<00:02:30.709> outside<00:02:31.069> the<00:02:31.190> building<00:02:31.489> so<00:02:31.579> I<00:02:31.640> kind

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:31.819 
spawning outside the building so I kind

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:34.660 
spawning outside the building so I kind
of<00:02:31.849> need<00:02:32.000> to<00:02:32.030> chill<00:02:32.720> out<00:02:32.980> now<00:02:33.980> I<00:02:34.010> guess<00:02:34.400> you

sense<00:03:27.410> they<00:03:27.760> you<00:03:28.760> know<00:03:28.790> it's<00:03:29.090> not<00:03:29.299> nearly<00:03:29.720> as

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810 
sense they you know it's not nearly as

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:31.420 
sense they you know it's not nearly as
powerful<00:03:30.019> as<00:03:30.380> it<00:03:30.590> used<00:03:30.769> to<00:03:30.859> be<00:03:30.980> if<00:03:31.069> you<00:03:31.220> think

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430 
powerful as it used to be if you think

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:33.159 
powerful as it used to be if you think
it<00:03:31.519> is<00:03:31.669> you<00:03:31.880> really<00:03:32.090> weren't<00:03:32.359> a<00:03:32.540> user<00:03:32.780> of<00:03:32.900> them

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:33.169 
it is you really weren't a user of them

00:03:33.169 --> 00:03:36.880 
it is you really weren't a user of them
I<00:03:34.299> use<00:03:35.299> them<00:03:35.480> the<00:03:35.569> first<00:03:35.690> goal<00:03:35.900> each<00:03:36.079> the<00:03:36.230> game

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:36.890 
I use them the first goal each the game

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:38.559 
I use them the first goal each the game
and<00:03:37.010> they<00:03:37.310> they're<00:03:37.819> definitely<00:03:38.060> a<00:03:38.270> lot<00:03:38.390> weaker

00:03:38.559 --> 00:03:38.569 
and they they're definitely a lot weaker

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:41.320 
and they they're definitely a lot weaker
this<00:03:38.960> on<00:03:39.140> their<00:03:39.380> side<00:03:39.590> um<00:03:40.460> this<00:03:41.030> spot<00:03:41.300> right

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:41.330 
this on their side um this spot right

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:43.900 
this on their side um this spot right
here<00:03:41.540> I<00:03:42.140> think<00:03:42.950> this<00:03:43.040> is<00:03:43.100> where<00:03:43.250> I<00:03:43.340> die<00:03:43.400> I'm

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:43.910 
here I think this is where I die I'm

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:45.760 
here I think this is where I die I'm
trying<00:03:44.390> to<00:03:44.450> pick<00:03:44.540> up<00:03:44.600> claymores<00:03:45.140> are<00:03:45.590> we<00:03:45.650> got

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:45.770 
trying to pick up claymores are we got

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:48.280 
trying to pick up claymores are we got
reclaimers<00:03:46.280> i'm<00:03:46.400> using<00:03:46.730> sin<00:03:47.420> tax<00:03:47.630> grades<00:03:48.050> and

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
reclaimers i'm using sin tax grades and

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:50.350 
reclaimers i'm using sin tax grades and
I<00:03:48.890> solved<00:03:49.160> it<00:03:49.190> by<00:03:49.250> teammates<00:03:49.730> we're<00:03:50.060> pushing

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:50.360 
I solved it by teammates we're pushing

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:52.030 
I solved it by teammates we're pushing
around<00:03:50.569> on<00:03:50.930> the<00:03:51.020> same<00:03:51.170> side<00:03:51.350> that<00:03:51.410> I<00:03:51.620> was<00:03:51.800> just

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.040 
around on the same side that I was just

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.250 
around on the same side that I was just
down<00:03:52.280> at<00:03:52.340> so<00:03:53.150> I<00:03:53.510> didn't<00:03:53.900> really<00:03:53.990> feel<00:03:54.110> like

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
down at so I didn't really feel like

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:55.690 
down at so I didn't really feel like
looking<00:03:54.500> that<00:03:54.830> way<00:03:54.980> especially<00:03:55.130> because<00:03:55.610> my

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:55.700 
looking that way especially because my

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:57.070 
looking that way especially because my
teammates<00:03:56.090> can<00:03:56.209> mostly<00:03:56.660> take<00:03:56.870> care<00:03:57.020> of

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:57.080 
teammates can mostly take care of

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:59.830 
teammates can mostly take care of
themselves<00:03:57.200> and<00:03:57.680> take<00:03:57.800> care<00:03:58.010> of<00:03:58.100> me<00:03:58.840> where

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
themselves and take care of me where

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.660 
themselves and take care of me where
they<00:04:00.050> are<00:04:00.080> and<00:04:00.500> now<00:04:00.860> I<00:04:00.890> know<00:04:01.040> back<00:04:01.400> where<00:04:01.580> the

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:01.670 
they are and now I know back where the

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:03.550 
they are and now I know back where the
spawning<00:04:01.970> is<00:04:02.240> vectors<00:04:02.750> where<00:04:02.900> I<00:04:02.989> was<00:04:03.170> earlier

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.560 
spawning is vectors where I was earlier

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:06.430 
spawning is vectors where I was earlier
where<00:04:03.800> I<00:04:03.830> got<00:04:04.160> the<00:04:04.280> pave<00:04:04.459> low<00:04:05.230> where<00:04:06.230> I<00:04:06.290> was

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.440 
where I got the pave low where I was

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.680 
where I got the pave low where I was
like<00:04:06.560> that<00:04:06.800> in<00:04:06.890> that<00:04:07.010> room<00:04:07.390> now<00:04:08.390> they're<00:04:08.540> all

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:08.690 
like that in that room now they're all

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:09.940 
like that in that room now they're all
underneath<00:04:09.050> me<00:04:09.290> and<00:04:09.350> I<00:04:09.440> got<00:04:09.560> to<00:04:09.650> kind<00:04:09.770> of<00:04:09.830> be

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:09.950 
underneath me and I got to kind of be

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:11.440 
underneath me and I got to kind of be
careful<00:04:10.100> because<00:04:10.550> i<00:04:10.760> don't<00:04:10.790> know<00:04:11.000> who's<00:04:11.180> up

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:11.450 
careful because i don't know who's up

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:14.410 
careful because i don't know who's up
here<00:04:11.780> with<00:04:11.930> me<00:04:11.959> I<00:04:12.350> started<00:04:13.190> scrambled<00:04:13.610> so<00:04:14.060> it's

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:14.420 
here with me I started scrambled so it's

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:17.050 
here with me I started scrambled so it's
a<00:04:14.510> real<00:04:14.750> big<00:04:15.140> indicator<00:04:15.830> about<00:04:16.400> people<00:04:16.970> being

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:17.060 
a real big indicator about people being

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:19.210 
a real big indicator about people being
around<00:04:17.390> you<00:04:17.570> I'm<00:04:18.410> trying<00:04:18.680> to<00:04:18.769> find<00:04:18.919> somebody

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:19.220 
around you I'm trying to find somebody

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:20.949 
around you I'm trying to find somebody
to<00:04:19.400> kill<00:04:19.669> this<00:04:19.850> going<00:04:20.030> to<00:04:20.090> need<00:04:20.180> launcher<00:04:20.600> I

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:20.959 
to kill this going to need launcher I

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:23.530 
to kill this going to need launcher I
saw<00:04:21.680> that<00:04:21.859> a<00:04:21.919> care<00:04:22.430> package<00:04:22.610> got<00:04:22.940> dropped<00:04:23.270> so<00:04:23.510> I

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:23.540 
saw that a care package got dropped so I

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:27.280 
saw that a care package got dropped so I
knew<00:04:24.200> they'd<00:04:24.470> be<00:04:24.500> pretty<00:04:25.070> easy<00:04:25.220> kill<00:04:26.020> if<00:04:27.020> i

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:27.290 
knew they'd be pretty easy kill if i

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:29.020 
knew they'd be pretty easy kill if i
just<00:04:27.530> watched<00:04:28.100> the<00:04:28.310> care<00:04:28.490> package<00:04:28.820> for<00:04:28.970> a

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.030 
just watched the care package for a

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:30.010 
just watched the care package for a
little<00:04:29.180> bit<00:04:29.330> hopefully<00:04:29.690> i<00:04:29.720> could<00:04:29.870> get<00:04:29.960> a

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:30.020 
little bit hopefully i could get a

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:31.810 
little bit hopefully i could get a
couple<00:04:30.169> kills<00:04:30.500> and<00:04:30.770> unfortunately<00:04:31.370> i<00:04:31.460> did<00:04:31.640> die

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:31.820 
couple kills and unfortunately i did die

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:33.790 
couple kills and unfortunately i did die
