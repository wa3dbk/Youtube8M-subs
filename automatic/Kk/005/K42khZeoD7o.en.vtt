00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.609

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.830

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.750

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.029

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.340

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.480
 who came out today 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.740
 and then that's it so I hope it's okay 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.070
 to please because I know that I have 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.690
 a lot 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.280
 finally I received a lot of messages 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.260
 like what telling me how do we do 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.610
 to activate it all so I thought 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.340
 but why not make a short video 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.590
 like that people and well will be 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.120
 here are the friends so let's go so 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.200
 already you can see that the table of 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.820
 kraft babel has not changed admits 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.789
 marseille but rather inside 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.230
 so here we are normal kraft table 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.020
 so that's the basis 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.270
 it's the basic one, so 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.800
 the automatic craft and if you want 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.550
 the activated simply is very 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.800
 simple to do 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.420
 when you're in the world f1 yeah 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.920
 no it works more in the world when 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.350
 so you are on your server you 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.049
 do tart here and options 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.560
 user interface settings and you 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.470
 choose 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.689
 here you finally click you make the 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.610
 you check here is a little v and 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.350
 you choose classic craftsmanship you 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.210
 just have to leave and now you 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.280
 have the classic crafts the friends 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.930
 here it is really super simple and 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.100
 to use it but there is no alas 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.390
 no different techniques need 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.430
 to train you have to learn 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.759
 crafts so if you do not play on 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.220
 pc 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.570
 ben you struggled a little bit this 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.490
 true so on the other hand if you look 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.320
 videos pc ben here it goes 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.240
 easily in your head 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.030
 of course a veil has no other part and 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.350
 so frankly it fits easily and 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.310
 on the other hand for the possible genres I 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.229
 think there will be no concern for 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.820
 you okay it's going to go like 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.960
 usually this is me anyway I'm 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.310
 super happy to have this little 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.100
 functionality because it adds us 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.060
 a little trick to minecraft and especially 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.280
 because I have never tested 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.320
 classic craftsmanship even on pc 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.640
