extended all the time lastly let's talk
about<00:02:07.530> feeding<00:02:08.149> most<00:02:09.149> hobbyists<00:02:09.450> probably<00:02:10.319> do

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
about feeding most hobbyists probably do

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.710 
about feeding most hobbyists probably do
not<00:02:10.679> go<00:02:10.979> out<00:02:11.190> of<00:02:11.340> their<00:02:11.459> way<00:02:11.489> to<00:02:11.640> feed<00:02:12.030> corals

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
not go out of their way to feed corals

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.960 
not go out of their way to feed corals
like<00:02:12.930> Fabien<00:02:13.410> 5<00:02:13.620> IDs<00:02:13.920> but<00:02:14.549> it's<00:02:14.640> certainly

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
like Fabien 5 IDs but it's certainly

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.270 
like Fabien 5 IDs but it's certainly
possible<00:02:15.030> to<00:02:15.510> do<00:02:15.780> so<00:02:16.019> and<00:02:16.319> I<00:02:16.500> recommend<00:02:16.950> trying

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
possible to do so and I recommend trying

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.000 
possible to do so and I recommend trying
to<00:02:17.489> provide<00:02:17.790> them<00:02:18.000> some<00:02:18.360> food<00:02:18.739> they're<00:02:19.739> very

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
to provide them some food they're very

to provide them some food they're very
active<00:02:20.250> feeders<00:02:20.880> and<00:02:21.209> will<00:02:21.690> accept<00:02:22.049> a<00:02:22.260> wide

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
active feeders and will accept a wide

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.589

feeding of corals such as this will

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.430 
feeding of corals such as this will

help improve coloration one warning I

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:37.039 
help improve coloration one warning I
always<00:02:35.730> feel<00:02:36.120> I<00:02:36.180> should<00:02:36.510> mention<00:02:36.780> about

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:37.049 
always feel I should mention about

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:39.849 
always feel I should mention about
feeding<00:02:37.530> corals<00:02:38.100> is<00:02:38.340> to<00:02:38.790> not<00:02:38.940> overdo<00:02:39.420> it

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:39.859 
feeding corals is to not overdo it

feeding corals is to not overdo it

that<00:02:42.780> in<00:02:42.870> my<00:02:43.049> opinion<00:02:43.170> greatly<00:02:43.950> outweigh<00:02:44.370> the

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:44.579 
that in my opinion greatly outweigh the

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:46.460 
that in my opinion greatly outweigh the
benefits<00:02:45.060> of<00:02:45.209> feeding<00:02:45.540> in<00:02:45.630> the<00:02:45.660> first<00:02:45.959> place

benefits of feeding in the first place

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.490 
benefits of feeding in the first place
I<00:02:46.500> would<00:02:47.489> start<00:02:47.760> slow<00:02:48.239> and<00:02:48.540> try<00:02:49.170> to<00:02:49.230> do

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
I would start slow and try to do

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:50.990 
I would start slow and try to do
everything<00:02:50.040> in<00:02:50.190> your<00:02:50.220> power<00:02:50.459> to<00:02:50.640> make<00:02:50.819> sure

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
everything in your power to make sure

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.090 
everything in your power to make sure
that<00:02:51.329> most<00:02:51.540> of<00:02:51.780> the<00:02:51.900> food<00:02:52.049> makes<00:02:52.410> it<00:02:52.620> to<00:02:52.920> the

tank<00:02:55.489> now<00:02:56.489> two<00:02:56.549> things<00:02:57.090> that<00:02:57.299> help<00:02:57.510> with<00:02:57.690> this

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
tank now two things that help with this

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.080 
tank now two things that help with this
are<00:02:58.260> to<00:02:58.560> turn<00:02:58.769> off<00:02:58.890> the<00:02:59.010> pumps<00:02:59.340> and<00:02:59.940> that

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
are to turn off the pumps and that

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:01.879 
are to turn off the pumps and that
allows<00:03:00.359> the<00:03:00.569> food<00:03:00.780> to<00:03:00.989> settle<00:03:01.290> on<00:03:01.380> the<00:03:01.500> corals

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:01.889 
allows the food to settle on the corals

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:04.910 
allows the food to settle on the corals
and<00:03:02.329> also<00:03:03.329> to<00:03:03.389> try<00:03:03.750> to<00:03:03.810> feed<00:03:04.049> at<00:03:04.200> night<00:03:04.230> when

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
tentacles to feed over time they're
