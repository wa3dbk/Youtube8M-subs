00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.810 

my<00:00:01.350> first<00:00:01.589> experience<00:00:01.949> of<00:00:02.129> tricking<00:00:02.520> was

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:02.820 
my first experience of tricking was

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.720 
my first experience of tricking was
marked<00:00:03.389> by<00:00:03.529> failures<00:00:04.529> I<00:00:04.740> just<00:00:05.220> had<00:00:05.339> a<00:00:05.370> lot<00:00:05.670> of

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730 
marked by failures I just had a lot of

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.780 
marked by failures I just had a lot of
trouble<00:00:06.120> getting<00:00:06.150> things<00:00:07.280> you<00:00:08.280> have<00:00:08.429> to<00:00:08.580> start

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
trouble getting things you have to start

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.230 
trouble getting things you have to start
from<00:00:08.880> the<00:00:09.000> basics<00:00:09.179> up<00:00:10.010> it<00:00:11.010> takes<00:00:11.340> time<00:00:11.730> and<00:00:11.759> it

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
from the basics up it takes time and it

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.900 
from the basics up it takes time and it
takes<00:00:12.269> practice<00:00:13.049> to<00:00:13.080> do<00:00:13.320> this<00:00:13.639> it's<00:00:14.639> really

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
takes practice to do this it's really

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.210 
takes practice to do this it's really
important<00:00:15.389> to<00:00:15.540> know<00:00:15.780> technique<00:00:16.590> of<00:00:16.770> it<00:00:16.920> to

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
important to know technique of it to

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.160 
important to know technique of it to
make<00:00:17.340> it<00:00:17.400> look<00:00:17.550> clean<00:00:18.060> and<00:00:18.300> strong<00:00:18.960> and

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
make it look clean and strong and

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:19.939 
make it look clean and strong and
powerful

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
powerful

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:27.550 
powerful
I<00:00:24.439> think<00:00:25.439> Dan's<00:00:25.949> system<00:00:26.460> his<00:00:26.699> curriculum<00:00:27.180> is

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:27.560 
I think Dan's system his curriculum is

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.349 
I think Dan's system his curriculum is
absolutely<00:00:28.560> amazing<00:00:29.160> it<00:00:29.640> breaks<00:00:29.970> everything

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
absolutely amazing it breaks everything

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.410 
absolutely amazing it breaks everything
down<00:00:30.750> into<00:00:31.109> really<00:00:31.859> small<00:00:32.070> pieces<00:00:32.279> you<00:00:33.090> create

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
down into really small pieces you create

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.600 
down into really small pieces you create
a<00:00:33.450> gateway<00:00:33.719> for<00:00:33.899> your<00:00:34.230> left<00:00:34.500> foot<00:00:34.770> as<00:00:35.010> you<00:00:35.340> step

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
a gateway for your left foot as you step

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.569 
a gateway for your left foot as you step
through<00:00:36.320> it<00:00:37.320> started<00:00:37.739> off<00:00:37.860> as<00:00:38.010> a<00:00:38.040> method<00:00:38.399> for

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
through it started off as a method for

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.280 
through it started off as a method for
me<00:00:39.000> to<00:00:39.180> be<00:00:39.300> able<00:00:39.360> to<00:00:39.600> understand<00:00:40.140> my<00:00:40.260> own

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
me to be able to understand my own

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.610 
me to be able to understand my own
progress<00:00:40.620> just<00:00:41.010> so<00:00:41.070> I<00:00:41.129> can<00:00:41.219> move<00:00:41.430> forward<00:00:42.620> you

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
progress just so I can move forward you

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.319 
progress just so I can move forward you

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
through at the time that I started

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.979 
through at the time that I started
tricking<00:00:59.340> I<00:00:59.520> wish<00:00:59.820> I<00:00:59.969> would<00:01:00.120> have<00:01:00.149> had<00:01:00.420> what

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
tricking I wish I would have had what

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.200 
tricking I wish I would have had what
Dan<00:01:01.230> is<00:01:01.440> teaching<00:01:01.859> everything<00:01:02.760> just<00:01:02.850> makes

Dan is teaching everything just makes

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:03.830 
Dan is teaching everything just makes
sense

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
sense

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:04.619 
sense
there's<00:01:04.350> like

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:04.629 
there's like

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:06.719 
there's like
lot<00:01:04.719> of<00:01:04.750> details<00:01:05.259> how<00:01:05.680> you<00:01:05.710> can<00:01:06.100> land<00:01:06.369> slips

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:06.729 
lot of details how you can land slips

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:08.370 
lot of details how you can land slips
takeoff<00:01:07.299> and<00:01:07.570> I<00:01:07.689> would've<00:01:07.960> been<00:01:07.990> like<00:01:08.229> more

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:08.380 
takeoff and I would've been like more

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:10.529 
takeoff and I would've been like more
prepared<00:01:08.799> for<00:01:08.950> this<00:01:09.850> stuff<00:01:10.030> and<00:01:10.210> try<00:01:10.329> and<00:01:10.450> do

00:01:10.529 --> 00:01:10.539 
prepared for this stuff and try and do

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:13.469 
prepared for this stuff and try and do
now<00:01:10.719> you<00:01:11.530> learn<00:01:11.740> it<00:01:11.890> the<00:01:11.979> correct<00:01:12.280> way<00:01:12.479> like

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:13.479 
now you learn it the correct way like

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:14.910 
now you learn it the correct way like
the<00:01:13.600> most<00:01:13.840> efficient<00:01:14.259> way<00:01:14.380> with<00:01:14.649> the<00:01:14.740> most

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:14.920 
the most efficient way with the most

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.830 
the most efficient way with the most
height<00:01:15.189> then<00:01:15.850> you<00:01:16.180> open<00:01:16.479> up<00:01:16.539> all<00:01:16.720> these

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:16.840 
height then you open up all these

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.350 
height then you open up all these
possibilities<00:01:17.259> now<00:01:18.159> it's<00:01:18.340> like<00:01:18.520> oh<00:01:18.700> I<00:01:18.789> can<00:01:19.149> do

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:19.360 
possibilities now it's like oh I can do

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.899 
possibilities now it's like oh I can do
those<00:01:19.539> now<00:01:21.299> there's<00:01:22.299> no<00:01:22.450> end<00:01:22.659> to<00:01:22.840> tricking

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
those now there's no end to tricking

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.010 
those now there's no end to tricking
people<00:01:24.909> who<00:01:25.060> reason<00:01:25.299> is<00:01:25.390> clicking<00:01:25.780> on<00:01:25.899> and

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:26.020 
people who reason is clicking on and

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:33.180 
people who reason is clicking on and
progressing<00:01:26.439> so<00:01:26.770> much<00:01:26.920> faster<00:01:27.130> than<00:01:27.399> I<00:01:27.549> was

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:33.190 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:36.190 

me<00:01:34.190> the<00:01:34.640> opportunity<00:01:35.270> to<00:01:35.300> put<00:01:35.600> the<00:01:35.630> potential

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
me the opportunity to put the potential

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.400 
me the opportunity to put the potential
for<00:01:36.620> tricking<00:01:37.100> out<00:01:37.280> to<00:01:37.460> everyone<00:01:38.060> is<00:01:38.420> the<00:01:39.200> most

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:39.410 
for tricking out to everyone is the most

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:42.070 
for tricking out to everyone is the most
exciting<00:01:39.860> aspect<00:01:40.250> so<00:01:41.120> unique<00:01:41.630> it's<00:01:41.900> so

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:42.080 
exciting aspect so unique it's so

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.170 
exciting aspect so unique it's so
different<00:01:42.350> once<00:01:42.950> you<00:01:43.130> do<00:01:43.280> this<00:01:43.490> you<00:01:43.970> add

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.180 
different once you do this you add

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:45.550 
different once you do this you add
bigger<00:01:44.510> tricks<00:01:44.750> to<00:01:44.990> it<00:01:45.110> you'll<00:01:45.410> be

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
bigger tricks to it you'll be

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:46.440 
bigger tricks to it you'll be
untouchable

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 
untouchable

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:48.640 
untouchable
when<00:01:47.450> I<00:01:47.540> get<00:01:47.690> to<00:01:47.810> see<00:01:47.990> somebody<00:01:48.260> who<00:01:48.620> has

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:48.650 
when I get to see somebody who has

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:50.470 
when I get to see somebody who has
higher<00:01:49.070> athleticism<00:01:49.580> which<00:01:50.000> is<00:01:50.120> better<00:01:50.360> for

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:50.480 
higher athleticism which is better for

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.330 
higher athleticism which is better for
more<00:01:50.990> flexibility<00:01:51.590> whatever<00:01:51.920> it<00:01:52.040> is<00:01:52.100> when<00:01:52.310> I

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
more flexibility whatever it is when I

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.090 
more flexibility whatever it is when I
get<00:01:52.550> to<00:01:52.670> see<00:01:52.880> somebody<00:01:53.690> else<00:01:53.990> you<00:01:54.740> know<00:01:54.860> take<00:01:55.070> a

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
get to see somebody else you know take a

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:56.470 
get to see somebody else you know take a
concept<00:01:55.730> that<00:01:55.880> they<00:01:56.000> might<00:01:56.180> not<00:01:56.300> have<00:01:56.360> known

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:56.480 
concept that they might not have known

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.090 
concept that they might not have known
about<00:01:56.660> and<00:01:56.900> perform<00:01:57.560> it<00:01:57.680> to<00:01:57.770> its<00:01:57.920> full

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
about and perform it to its full
