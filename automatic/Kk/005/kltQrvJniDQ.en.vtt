00:00:26.489 --> 00:00:28.529
 on the one hand interested 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.880
 that is going to touch the theoretical part of the characters that the repression of 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.180
 the most protests 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.150
 but on the other hand, I think that in the end, what I like most are 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:37.360
 the best 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.750
 gaza 3 38 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.250
 the indianÃ¡polis 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.680
 he never lets himself be loved 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.070
 create with photos 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:48.180
 erick that challenge is exciting 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.670
 from relationships to photography is a little complex relationship because 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:53.160
 really to me 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.160
 which led me to the most ideological photography towards properly said 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.620
 really just two things like literature like cinema 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:02.620
 with the music 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.470
 I think that at the time a little delicate and complex or I think that 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:17.590
 there are people doing very interesting things 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.950
 the problem is that I think there is too much information 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.200
 sport that I think is an excess in training or filtered as with the point 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.830
 that they become disinformation 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:28.110
 i 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.260
 I think that good 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.580
 that comes a time to separate a little 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:36.040
 Separate things a little and see that the voice is valid 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.590
 indicated that until now a little messing around and bothering that they study its price in 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:40.130
 vain 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.759
 I want you to want them to believe in the role of photography in a way 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:44.570
 as pure photography 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:45.780
 that is, m 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.720
 since a few years ago there is a very strong discussion of art in the world of 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:49.640
 Photography 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:50.770
 I think so 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:52.580
 Of course 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:55.900
 a tremendously positive part foresees another very negative official part 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.620
 and I think that photography refers pure photography to say that one 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:03.429
 vindicate photography as an image in itself that is to say as the power of 

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:04.890
 Photography as an image 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.630
 it's a kind of images 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.419
 that sustain themselves 

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:11.559
 and that really are exciting and that there is still a lot to investigate in 

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:12.329
 they 

00:02:12.329 --> 00:02:15.049
 and that does not require any kind of additional symbology 

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:17.109
 the fact of being 

00:02:17.109 --> 00:02:19.839
 there is a claim of the point in this way that has been made is some 

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:21.489
 photographer 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:23.829
 how to make good photographs 

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:27.049
 two that the meteorite I think you have to give a couple of laps 

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:30.629
 and this will have been asked demolishing that is so that we are not photographs 

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:33.979
 as soon as we know we do not have problems many the best course 

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:35.689
 passed because it is very easy 

00:02:35.689 --> 00:02:38.249
 the problem to know 

00:02:38.249 --> 00:02:40.389
 the text of his art 

00:02:40.389 --> 00:02:42.749
 what makes up the photographic work 

00:02:42.749 --> 00:02:44.019
 and it's time that never 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:46.890
 I have the feeling of still being an amateur Jorge loved
