was<00:00:40.800> going<00:00:41.010> for<00:00:41.340> i<00:00:41.370> think<00:00:41.730> the<00:00:41.820> lowest<00:00:41.969> i<00:00:42.239> seen

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
was going for i think the lowest i seen

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.030 
was going for i think the lowest i seen
on<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:42.719> block<00:00:42.930> right<00:00:42.960> now<00:00:43.379> is<00:00:43.649> a<00:00:43.680> million

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
on the block right now is a million

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.720 
on the block right now is a million
coins<00:00:44.309> which<00:00:45.000> is<00:00:45.210> understandable<00:00:46.140> because<00:00:46.730> he

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
coins which is understandable because he

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.010 
coins which is understandable because he
just<00:00:47.969> came<00:00:48.149> out<00:00:48.239> he's<00:00:48.480> probably<00:00:48.690> gonna<00:00:48.840> be<00:00:48.960> the

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
just came out he's probably gonna be the

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.660 
just came out he's probably gonna be the
best<00:00:49.170> running<00:00:49.350> back<00:00:49.530> in<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.680> game<00:00:49.800> now<00:00:50.039> those

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
best running back in the game now those

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.529 
best running back in the game now those
are<00:00:50.700> Manning<00:00:51.059> stats<00:00:52.129> right<00:00:53.129> there<00:00:53.489> I<00:00:54.120> think<00:00:54.449> is

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
are Manning stats right there I think is

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.029 
are Manning stats right there I think is
it<00:00:54.690> considers<00:00:55.020> this<00:00:55.140> considered<00:00:55.530> a<00:00:55.590> fantasy

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
it considers this considered a fantasy

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.380 
it considers this considered a fantasy
or<00:00:56.219> limited<00:00:56.699> fancy<00:00:58.399> so<00:00:59.399> there's<00:00:59.579> that<00:00:59.760> that's

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
or limited fancy so there's that that's

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.330 
or limited fancy so there's that that's
not<00:01:00.600> bad<00:01:00.809> and<00:01:01.050> then<00:01:01.500> Briggs<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:01.859> stats<00:01:02.190> is

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
not bad and then Briggs the stats is

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.390 
not bad and then Briggs the stats is
right<00:01:02.550> here<00:01:02.879> yeah<00:01:03.559> pretty<00:01:04.559> decent<00:01:05.010> tackling

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
right here yeah pretty decent tackling

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.800 
right here yeah pretty decent tackling
hit<00:01:05.580> power<00:01:05.729> is<00:01:05.850> not<00:01:05.909> as<00:01:06.060> good<00:01:06.210> but<00:01:06.240> that

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
hit power is not as good but that

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.160 
hit power is not as good but that
doesn't<00:01:07.049> really<00:01:07.110> matter<00:01:08.330> so<00:01:09.330> let<00:01:09.540> me<00:01:09.570> go<00:01:09.810> show

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
doesn't really matter so let me go show

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.300 
doesn't really matter so let me go show
you<00:01:10.229> Barry<00:01:11.100> Sanders<00:01:12.500> so<00:01:13.500> far<00:01:13.680> when<00:01:14.040> I<00:01:14.070> just

checked there was only three up on the

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.170 
checked there was only three up on the
block<00:01:15.979> who<00:01:16.979> knows<00:01:17.189> how<00:01:17.490> many's<00:01:17.700> up<00:01:17.820> there<00:01:17.970> now
