00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:16.670

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:20.619
 will receive a task every day 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:23.689
 video format and every day 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:26.090

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:29.600
 day we will disassemble small 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:32.119
 a piece of some kind of one of 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.640
 important topics in this course I put the whole 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:40.009
 the experience that gathered last year in 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:43.670
 three courses that spent in a row and form 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:46.490

 In general, I consider this course very successful. 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:57.409
 plots 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:02:00.350
 that hundreds of people can confirm 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:02.719
 who passed it last year at 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:06.100
 this year in an improved format I think 

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:09.740
