00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:11.340 
from player base at least and then we

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:13.400 
from player base at least and then we
still<00:05:11.550> got<00:05:11.700> this<00:05:11.790> couple<00:05:12.090> 48<00:05:12.450> guy<00:05:12.690> we're<00:05:13.260> going

to<00:05:13.500> be<00:05:13.590> refreshing<00:05:14.040> him<00:05:14.310> because<00:05:14.610> he<00:05:14.760> was

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:14.790 
to be refreshing him because he was

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:16.570 
to be refreshing him because he was
literally<00:05:15.330> impossible<00:05:15.540> to<00:05:16.080> defeat

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:16.580 
literally impossible to defeat

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:18.590 
literally impossible to defeat
considering<00:05:17.580> the<00:05:17.700> fact<00:05:17.940> that<00:05:18.030> everything

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:18.600 
considering the fact that everything

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:20.690 
considering the fact that everything
that<00:05:18.960> he<00:05:19.140> has<00:05:19.170> literally<00:05:19.740> was<00:05:19.980> so<00:05:20.190> boosted<00:05:20.430> up

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:20.700 
that he has literally was so boosted up

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:22.940 
that he has literally was so boosted up
so<00:05:20.910> that<00:05:21.090> is<00:05:21.210> a<00:05:21.240> quite<00:05:21.900> unfortunate<00:05:22.560> but<00:05:22.680> still

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:22.950 
so that is a quite unfortunate but still

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:25.130 
so that is a quite unfortunate but still
we<00:05:23.250> got<00:05:23.490> all<00:05:23.640> of<00:05:23.730> these<00:05:23.850> MPC<00:05:24.390> bases<00:05:24.780> left<00:05:24.990> as

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:25.140 
we got all of these MPC bases left as

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:27.050 
we got all of these MPC bases left as
well<00:05:25.170> I'm<00:05:25.800> gonna<00:05:25.950> be<00:05:26.040> refreshing<00:05:26.610> those<00:05:26.850> as

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:27.060 
well I'm gonna be refreshing those as

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:28.190 
well I'm gonna be refreshing those as
well<00:05:27.240> or<00:05:27.390> at<00:05:27.480> least<00:05:27.630> I'm<00:05:27.780> going<00:05:27.840> to<00:05:27.960> be<00:05:28.050> taking
