00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:11.440 
hi my name is Tom dole Durr and I'm

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.970 
hi my name is Tom dole Durr and I'm
about<00:00:11.650> a<00:00:11.710> Samak<00:00:12.719> 306<00:00:13.719> tea<00:00:14.200> where<00:00:14.620> this<00:00:14.770> this

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:14.980 
about a Samak 306 tea where this this

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:18.780 
about a Samak 306 tea where this this
time<00:00:15.280> I'm<00:00:15.490> the<00:00:16.270> 306<00:00:16.900> tea<00:00:17.110> it<00:00:17.320> features<00:00:17.680> a<00:00:17.890> 6

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:18.790 
time I'm the 306 tea it features a 6

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:20.820 
time I'm the 306 tea it features a 6
meter<00:00:19.029> pump<00:00:19.480> in<00:00:19.630> it<00:00:19.750> so<00:00:20.230> it's<00:00:20.380> a<00:00:20.470> little<00:00:20.590> less

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:20.830 
meter pump in it so it's a little less

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:22.440 
meter pump in it so it's a little less
expensive<00:00:21.460> than<00:00:21.580> its<00:00:21.760> bigger<00:00:21.939> brother<00:00:22.210> the

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:22.450 
expensive than its bigger brother the

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:25.950 
expensive than its bigger brother the
310<00:00:22.990> and<00:00:23.290> but<00:00:24.160> it<00:00:24.279> does<00:00:24.490> run<00:00:24.759> the<00:00:25.060> T<00:00:25.300> stands<00:00:25.690> for

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:25.960 
310 and but it does run the T stands for

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.010 
310 and but it does run the T stands for
a<00:00:25.990> time<00:00:26.320> cycle<00:00:26.980> so<00:00:27.520> your<00:00:27.880> control<00:00:28.330> panel<00:00:28.779> here

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:29.020 
a time cycle so your control panel here

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:31.050 
a time cycle so your control panel here
is<00:00:29.140> a<00:00:29.170> little<00:00:29.470> bit<00:00:29.619> different<00:00:30.100> the<00:00:30.670> control

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:31.060 
is a little bit different the control

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:33.900 
is a little bit different the control
panel<00:00:31.510> is<00:00:31.720> very<00:00:32.500> easy<00:00:32.800> to<00:00:33.040> understand<00:00:33.610> if

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:33.910 
panel is very easy to understand if

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:36.299 
panel is very easy to understand if
you're<00:00:34.239> if<00:00:34.780> this<00:00:35.110> light<00:00:35.379> is<00:00:35.559> lit<00:00:35.800> up<00:00:35.830> that's

00:00:36.299 --> 00:00:36.309 
you're if this light is lit up that's

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:38.970 
you're if this light is lit up that's
the<00:00:36.610> vacuum<00:00:37.059> it's<00:00:37.600> how<00:00:37.989> much<00:00:38.199> air<00:00:38.559> is<00:00:38.590> coming

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:38.980 
the vacuum it's how much air is coming

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.520 
the vacuum it's how much air is coming
out<00:00:39.309> of<00:00:39.340> the<00:00:39.550> chamber<00:00:39.760> and<00:00:40.090> you<00:00:40.150> can<00:00:40.900> adjust<00:00:41.290> it

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:41.530 
out of the chamber and you can adjust it

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.750 
out of the chamber and you can adjust it
by<00:00:41.760> seconds<00:00:42.760> either<00:00:43.360> up<00:00:43.659> or<00:00:43.809> down<00:00:44.519> while<00:00:45.519> that

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:57.370 
move the heat time up or down as you see

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:00.030 
move the heat time up or down as you see
fit<00:00:57.610> and<00:00:58.600> for<00:00:58.989> depending<00:00:59.500> on<00:00:59.559> what<00:00:59.680> kind<00:00:59.949> of

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:00.040 
fit and for depending on what kind of

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:01.910 
fit and for depending on what kind of
bags<00:01:00.309> that<00:01:00.580> you<00:01:00.640> are<00:01:00.790> actually<00:01:01.089> heat<00:01:01.420> sealing

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
bags that you are actually heat sealing

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.640 
bags that you are actually heat sealing
and<00:01:02.920> this<00:01:03.610> machine<00:01:04.000> also<00:01:04.540> does<00:01:04.839> have<00:01:04.869> a<00:01:05.140> soft

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:05.650 
and this machine also does have a soft

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:07.890 
and this machine also does have a soft
air<00:01:06.040> feature<00:01:06.369> so<00:01:06.850> it<00:01:06.909> will<00:01:07.060> let<00:01:07.240> the<00:01:07.420> air<00:01:07.540> back

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:07.900 
air feature so it will let the air back

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.930 
air feature so it will let the air back
into<00:01:08.200> the<00:01:08.409> chamber<00:01:08.830> and<00:01:08.860> burst<00:01:09.280> which<00:01:09.640> tends

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:09.940 
into the chamber and burst which tends

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:12.870 
into the chamber and burst which tends
to<00:01:10.180> lay<00:01:10.450> the<00:01:10.869> plastic<00:01:10.990> onto<00:01:11.500> the<00:01:11.799> bag<00:01:11.979> more

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:12.880 
to lay the plastic onto the bag more

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.830 
to lay the plastic onto the bag more
softly<00:01:13.420> and<00:01:14.189> more<00:01:15.189> fluently<00:01:15.850> so<00:01:16.210> you<00:01:16.299> don't

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:16.840 
softly and more fluently so you don't

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.620 
softly and more fluently so you don't
distort<00:01:17.590> your<00:01:17.680> product<00:01:18.369> if<00:01:18.609> you're<00:01:19.149> using<00:01:19.359> the

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:19.630 
distort your product if you're using the

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.649 
distort your product if you're using the
soft<00:01:19.930> air<00:01:20.259> and<00:01:20.609> you<00:01:21.609> can<00:01:21.789> turn<00:01:21.969> that<00:01:22.180> on<00:01:22.390> or<00:01:22.420> off

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:22.659 
soft air and you can turn that on or off

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:25.469 
soft air and you can turn that on or off
with<00:01:23.170> this<00:01:23.320> feature<00:01:23.619> so<00:01:23.950> it<00:01:24.700> also<00:01:24.939> has<00:01:25.420> a

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:25.479 
with this feature so it also has a

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:27.630 
with this feature so it also has a
control<00:01:26.200> here<00:01:26.590> which<00:01:26.829> will<00:01:27.039> allow<00:01:27.310> you<00:01:27.369> to

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:27.640 
control here which will allow you to

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.639 
control here which will allow you to
turn<00:01:27.789> the<00:01:28.000> pump<00:01:28.210> on<00:01:28.500> independently<00:01:29.500> of

00:01:29.639 --> 00:01:29.649 
turn the pump on independently of

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:32.069 
turn the pump on independently of
pushing<00:01:30.070> the<00:01:30.189> lid<00:01:30.369> down<00:01:30.640> so<00:01:31.479> that<00:01:31.659> means<00:01:31.899> when

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:32.079 
pushing the lid down so that means when

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:34.529 
pushing the lid down so that means when
you<00:01:32.170> want<00:01:32.320> to<00:01:32.409> do<00:01:32.530> things<00:01:32.770> like<00:01:32.920> jars<00:01:33.640> or<00:01:33.909> run

00:01:34.529 --> 00:01:34.539 
you want to do things like jars or run

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:36.840 
you want to do things like jars or run
canisters<00:01:35.409> with<00:01:35.679> this<00:01:35.859> machine<00:01:36.219> you<00:01:36.280> lift

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:36.850 
canisters with this machine you lift

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:39.419 
canisters with this machine you lift
this<00:01:37.030> plate<00:01:37.390> out<00:01:37.570> of<00:01:37.869> the<00:01:37.990> way<00:01:38.140> and<00:01:38.499> that<00:01:39.130> gives

00:01:39.419 --> 00:01:39.429 
this plate out of the way and that gives

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:42.359 
this plate out of the way and that gives
you<00:01:39.549> access<00:01:39.759> to<00:01:40.060> this<00:01:40.329> port<00:01:40.719> in<00:01:40.929> the<00:01:41.079> back<00:01:41.369> now

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:42.369 
you access to this port in the back now

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:44.219 
you access to this port in the back now
when<00:01:42.520> you<00:01:42.609> want<00:01:42.789> to<00:01:42.939> turn<00:01:43.149> on<00:01:43.390> the<00:01:43.450> pump<00:01:43.990> in

we did out of a frozen bag of peas this
is<00:02:17.170> a<00:02:17.200> really<00:02:17.560> kind<00:02:17.769> of<00:02:17.830> a<00:02:17.950> fun<00:02:18.190> project<00:02:18.489> you

is a really kind of a fun project you

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:20.729 
is a really kind of a fun project you
just<00:02:18.940> buy<00:02:19.299> a<00:02:19.330> frozen<00:02:19.569> bag<00:02:19.930> of<00:02:20.049> peas<00:02:20.200> put<00:02:20.560> it<00:02:20.650> on

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739 
just buy a frozen bag of peas put it on

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:21.970 
just buy a frozen bag of peas put it on
your<00:02:20.890> dehydrator

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
your dehydrator

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.970 
your dehydrator
into<00:02:22.310> a<00:02:22.340> jar<00:02:22.840> now<00:02:23.840> it's<00:02:24.019> interesting<00:02:24.349> to<00:02:24.800> note

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
into a jar now it's interesting to note

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.910 
into a jar now it's interesting to note
that<00:02:25.220> when<00:02:25.370> you<00:02:25.489> start<00:02:25.909> this<00:02:26.150> pump<00:02:26.569> the<00:02:27.530> timer

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
that when you start this pump the timer

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.190 
that when you start this pump the timer
is<00:02:28.280> disconnected<00:02:29.150> so<00:02:29.480> this<00:02:29.659> pump<00:02:29.989> will

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
is disconnected so this pump will

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.869 
is disconnected so this pump will
essentially<00:02:30.680> run<00:02:31.840> until<00:02:32.840> you<00:02:32.989> tell<00:02:33.200> it<00:02:33.230> not<00:02:33.500> to

00:02:33.869 --> 00:02:33.879 
essentially run until you tell it not to

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:36.940 
essentially run until you tell it not to
so<00:02:34.879> if<00:02:35.030> you<00:02:35.060> have<00:02:35.360> a<00:02:35.390> number<00:02:35.870> of<00:02:36.260> jars<00:02:36.500> that<00:02:36.680> you

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
so if you have a number of jars that you

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.789 
so if you have a number of jars that you
want<00:02:37.129> to<00:02:37.250> do<00:02:37.720> place<00:02:38.720> the<00:02:38.930> other<00:02:39.080> sucker<00:02:39.440> in<00:02:39.680> the

00:02:39.789 --> 00:02:39.799 
want to do place the other sucker in the

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:41.800 
want to do place the other sucker in the
back<00:02:39.980> and<00:02:40.430> the<00:02:40.519> suction<00:02:41.060> in<00:02:41.180> the<00:02:41.299> pump<00:02:41.569> will

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
back and the suction in the pump will

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.839 
back and the suction in the pump will
actually<00:02:42.200> hold<00:02:42.440> that<00:02:42.769> piece<00:02:43.040> in<00:02:43.280> place

00:02:45.839 --> 00:02:45.849 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:48.520 

activate<00:02:46.849> the<00:02:47.090> or<00:02:47.450> just<00:02:47.660> plug<00:02:47.959> it<00:02:48.110> into<00:02:48.260> the

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
activate the or just plug it into the

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.890 
activate the or just plug it into the
jar<00:02:48.769> and<00:02:49.190> then<00:02:49.250> watch<00:02:49.579> your<00:02:49.610> gauge<00:02:50.090> here<00:02:50.540> when

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
jar and then watch your gauge here when

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.809 
jar and then watch your gauge here when
it<00:02:51.049> gets<00:02:51.079> most<00:02:51.500> of<00:02:51.709> the<00:02:51.799> way<00:02:51.920> around<00:02:52.069> there<00:02:52.579> I

00:02:52.809 --> 00:02:52.819 
it gets most of the way around there I

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:58.240 
it gets most of the way around there I
like<00:02:53.599> to<00:02:53.659> do<00:02:53.930> like<00:02:54.170> 90<00:02:54.739> or<00:02:54.890> 85<00:02:55.340> percent<00:02:57.250> that'll

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
like to do like 90 or 85 percent that'll

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:00.069 
like to do like 90 or 85 percent that'll
give<00:02:58.370> you<00:02:58.489> plenty<00:02:58.730> of<00:02:58.849> vacuum<00:02:59.329> in<00:02:59.450> the<00:02:59.540> jar<00:02:59.810> and

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:00.079 
give you plenty of vacuum in the jar and

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:03.430 
give you plenty of vacuum in the jar and
then<00:03:00.739> this<00:03:01.340> device<00:03:01.609> will<00:03:02.030> continue<00:03:02.510> to<00:03:02.629> run<00:03:02.840> so

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
then this device will continue to run so

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.319 
then this device will continue to run so
if<00:03:03.560> you<00:03:03.650> wanted<00:03:03.890> to<00:03:04.010> do<00:03:04.160> another<00:03:04.430> jar<00:03:04.790> you<00:03:05.090> just

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:05.329 
if you wanted to do another jar you just

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:07.240 
if you wanted to do another jar you just
keep<00:03:05.540> going<00:03:05.750> with<00:03:06.049> them<00:03:06.170> until<00:03:06.709> you<00:03:06.859> get<00:03:07.010> done

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
keep going with them until you get done

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.720 
keep going with them until you get done
doing<00:03:07.430> all<00:03:07.609> your<00:03:07.849> jars<00:03:08.140> turn<00:03:09.140> the<00:03:09.349> pump<00:03:09.560> off

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
doing all your jars turn the pump off

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:11.619 
doing all your jars turn the pump off
everything<00:03:10.730> will<00:03:11.060> relax

00:03:11.619 --> 00:03:11.629 
everything will relax

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:15.009 
everything will relax
so<00:03:12.620> jars<00:03:13.010> are<00:03:13.250> very<00:03:13.489> very<00:03:13.730> simple<00:03:14.180> on<00:03:14.390> a<00:03:14.420> Samak

00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:15.019 
so jars are very very simple on a Samak

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:18.610 
so jars are very very simple on a Samak
306<00:03:15.680> t<00:03:16.480> the<00:03:17.480> plates<00:03:17.750> come<00:03:18.019> in<00:03:18.140> and<00:03:18.290> out<00:03:18.410> very

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
306 t the plates come in and out very

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.920 
306 t the plates come in and out very
easily<00:03:18.950> and<00:03:19.400> again<00:03:19.670> the<00:03:19.879> Samak<00:03:20.299> has<00:03:20.450> designed

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
easily and again the Samak has designed

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.259 
easily and again the Samak has designed
so<00:03:21.230> that<00:03:21.260> you<00:03:21.530> can<00:03:21.739> get<00:03:21.920> different<00:03:22.190> levels<00:03:22.700> in

00:03:23.259 --> 00:03:23.269 
so that you can get different levels in

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:25.720 
so that you can get different levels in
the<00:03:23.420> chamber<00:03:23.900> with<00:03:24.530> the<00:03:24.739> same<00:03:24.980> plate<00:03:25.370> you

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
the chamber with the same plate you

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.970 
the chamber with the same plate you
stand<00:03:26.030> it<00:03:26.150> up<00:03:26.269> on<00:03:26.450> its<00:03:26.630> feet<00:03:26.810> remove<00:03:27.680> it<00:03:27.829> all

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
stand it up on its feet remove it all

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:30.220 
stand it up on its feet remove it all
together<00:03:28.220> and<00:03:29.120> you<00:03:29.239> still<00:03:29.540> have<00:03:29.750> that<00:03:29.930> food

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
together and you still have that food

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:32.800 
together and you still have that food
shape<00:03:30.620> chamber<00:03:31.099> so<00:03:31.370> it<00:03:31.549> has<00:03:31.730> a<00:03:31.760> dish<00:03:32.419> in<00:03:32.720> the

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
shape chamber so it has a dish in the

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:34.839 
shape chamber so it has a dish in the
bottom<00:03:33.169> of<00:03:33.290> it<00:03:33.470> so<00:03:33.709> it<00:03:33.829> gives<00:03:34.010> you<00:03:34.130> a<00:03:34.160> few<00:03:34.459> and

00:03:34.839 --> 00:03:34.849 
bottom of it so it gives you a few and

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:36.190 
bottom of it so it gives you a few and
gives<00:03:35.060> you<00:03:35.180> an<00:03:35.269> extra<00:03:35.510> inch<00:03:35.840> when<00:03:36.079> you're

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.200 
gives you an extra inch when you're

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.050 
gives you an extra inch when you're
doing<00:03:36.410> something<00:03:36.650> round<00:03:37.069> or<00:03:37.430> large<00:03:37.730> like<00:03:38.030> a

do retort pouches in this machine and

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:57.069 
do retort pouches in this machine and
the<00:03:54.079> timed<00:03:54.380> cycles<00:03:55.099> are<00:03:55.730> in<00:03:56.120> my<00:03:56.419> mind<00:03:56.660> some<00:03:56.900> in

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:57.079 
the timed cycles are in my mind some in

00:03:57.079 --> 00:03:58.780 
the timed cycles are in my mind some in
some<00:03:57.349> ways<00:03:57.560> a<00:03:57.590> little<00:03:57.950> bit<00:03:58.099> better<00:03:58.340> at<00:03:58.609> higher

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.790 
some ways a little bit better at higher

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:03.039 
some ways a little bit better at higher

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:04.300 
altitudes than the sensor cycles they're
just<00:04:03.410> require<00:04:03.739> a<00:04:03.769> little<00:04:04.010> bit<00:04:04.130> less

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.310 
just require a little bit less

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:06.879 
just require a little bit less
adjustment<00:04:04.910> and<00:04:05.090> the<00:04:05.329> timer's<00:04:05.989> run<00:04:06.349> the<00:04:06.590> pump

for a specific length of time and of
course<00:04:09.560> you<00:04:09.829> can<00:04:10.190> do<00:04:10.340> you<00:04:10.579> can<00:04:10.760> do<00:04:10.879> the<00:04:11.030> same<00:04:11.269> on

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:12.109 
course you can do you can do the same on

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:14.800 
course you can do you can do the same on
off<00:04:12.590> kind<00:04:12.980> of<00:04:13.069> controls<00:04:13.519> with<00:04:14.060> this<00:04:14.299> so<00:04:14.599> if<00:04:14.720> you

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:14.810 
off kind of controls with this so if you

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:20.170 
off kind of controls with this so if you
are<00:04:15.019> running<00:04:15.379> a<00:04:15.590> bag<00:04:16.599> and<00:04:17.599> you<00:04:18.530> want<00:04:18.739> to<00:04:19.180> stop

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:20.180 
are running a bag and you want to stop

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:23.620 
are running a bag and you want to stop
the<00:04:20.449> cycle<00:04:20.690> and<00:04:21.169> seal<00:04:21.620> the<00:04:21.889> bag<00:04:22.240> and<00:04:23.240> if<00:04:23.479> you

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630 
the cycle and seal the bag and if you

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:25.210 
the cycle and seal the bag and if you

seal bar

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:30.080 
seal bar
when<00:04:28.169> you<00:04:28.319> stop<00:04:28.650> the<00:04:28.680> cycle<00:04:29.370> on<00:04:29.580> here<00:04:29.939> it

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.090 
when you stop the cycle on here it

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:33.439 
when you stop the cycle on here it
actually<00:04:30.270> does<00:04:30.780> seal<00:04:31.139> the<00:04:31.379> bag<00:04:31.560> for<00:04:32.009> you<00:04:32.129> so<00:04:32.520> if

00:04:33.439 --> 00:04:33.449 
actually does seal the bag for you so if

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:35.420 
actually does seal the bag for you so if
you're<00:04:33.750> doing<00:04:34.650> something<00:04:34.889> that's<00:04:35.069> fairly

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.430 
you're doing something that's fairly

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:38.089 
you're doing something that's fairly
delicate<00:04:35.759> you<00:04:36.750> can<00:04:36.930> watch<00:04:37.169> the<00:04:37.469> gauge<00:04:37.680> and

00:04:38.089 --> 00:04:38.099 
delicate you can watch the gauge and

00:04:38.099 --> 00:04:39.830 
delicate you can watch the gauge and
when<00:04:38.219> it<00:04:38.370> gets<00:04:38.490> to<00:04:39.000> the<00:04:39.120> point<00:04:39.330> where<00:04:39.629> you

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 
when it gets to the point where you

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.570 
when it gets to the point where you
don't<00:04:39.990> want<00:04:40.229> to<00:04:40.319> crush<00:04:40.590> something<00:04:40.919> then<00:04:41.310> just

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:41.580 
don't want to crush something then just

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.149 
don't want to crush something then just
turn<00:04:41.849> the<00:04:42.000> Machine<00:04:42.300> off<00:04:42.539> that<00:04:43.379> will<00:04:43.590> step<00:04:43.919> into

00:04:44.149 --> 00:04:44.159 
turn the Machine off that will step into

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:47.270 
turn the Machine off that will step into
the<00:04:44.280> heat<00:04:44.550> cycle<00:04:45.030> and<00:04:45.210> seal<00:04:45.990> it<00:04:46.199> and<00:04:46.889> then<00:04:47.069> let

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:47.280 
the heat cycle and seal it and then let

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:50.390 
the heat cycle and seal it and then let
air<00:04:47.460> back<00:04:47.729> into<00:04:48.000> the<00:04:48.150> chamber<00:04:48.659> now<00:04:49.099> we<00:04:50.099> haven't

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:50.400 
air back into the chamber now we haven't

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.550 
air back into the chamber now we haven't
had<00:04:50.580> the<00:04:50.699> soft<00:04:51.090> air<00:04:51.419> feature<00:04:51.719> on<00:04:52.020> for<00:04:52.289> any<00:04:52.409> of

had the soft air feature on for any of

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:56.209 
had the soft air feature on for any of
these<00:04:52.680> but<00:04:53.069> that<00:04:53.099> will<00:04:53.460> seal<00:04:53.879> the<00:04:54.210> bag<00:04:54.419> and<00:04:55.219> if

00:04:56.209 --> 00:04:56.219 
these but that will seal the bag and if

00:04:56.219 --> 00:04:58.939 
these but that will seal the bag and if
you<00:04:56.340> want<00:04:56.520> to<00:04:56.610> run<00:04:56.759> the<00:04:56.939> soft<00:04:57.240> air<00:04:57.740> hit<00:04:58.740> the

00:04:58.939 --> 00:04:58.949 
you want to run the soft air hit the

00:04:58.949 --> 00:05:03.980 
you want to run the soft air hit the
soft<00:04:59.190> air<00:04:59.460> button<00:05:01.310> close<00:05:02.310> the<00:05:02.520> lid<00:05:02.669> and<00:05:02.990> then

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:03.990 
soft air button close the lid and then

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:06.409 
soft air button close the lid and then
just<00:05:04.289> let<00:05:04.500> the<00:05:04.530> cycle<00:05:05.069> time<00:05:05.310> run<00:05:05.669> for<00:05:06.150> as<00:05:06.240> long

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:06.419 
just let the cycle time run for as long

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:08.930 
just let the cycle time run for as long
as<00:05:06.479> one<00:05:06.900> when<00:05:07.590> you've<00:05:07.770> achieved<00:05:07.949> the<00:05:08.520> proper

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:08.940 
as one when you've achieved the proper

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:11.029 
as one when you've achieved the proper
vacuum<00:05:09.120> to<00:05:09.629> where<00:05:09.750> you<00:05:09.930> like<00:05:10.139> it<00:05:10.349> then<00:05:10.830> what

00:05:11.029 --> 00:05:11.039 
vacuum to where you like it then what

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:12.619 
vacuum to where you like it then what
you<00:05:11.190> want<00:05:11.340> to<00:05:11.400> do<00:05:11.580> is<00:05:11.759> just<00:05:11.940> turn<00:05:12.150> the<00:05:12.300> Machine

00:05:12.619 --> 00:05:12.629 
you want to do is just turn the Machine

00:05:12.629 --> 00:05:16.100 
you want to do is just turn the Machine
off<00:05:12.659> and<00:05:13.229> the<00:05:14.190> soft<00:05:14.520> air<00:05:14.909> then<00:05:15.270> will<00:05:15.719> let<00:05:15.900> the

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:16.110 
off and the soft air then will let the

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:19.249 
off and the soft air then will let the
air<00:05:16.289> back<00:05:16.620> in<00:05:16.919> in<00:05:17.340> more<00:05:17.940> of<00:05:18.300> a<00:05:18.419> burst<00:05:18.690> kind<00:05:19.139> of

air back in in more of a burst kind of

00:05:19.259 --> 00:05:23.360 
air back in in more of a burst kind of
fast<00:05:19.469> and<00:05:19.889> it<00:05:20.669> goes<00:05:20.879> on<00:05:21.750> and<00:05:22.020> off<00:05:22.110> and<00:05:22.590> then

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:23.370 
fast and it goes on and off and then

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:25.670 
fast and it goes on and off and then
lets<00:05:23.639> all<00:05:23.969> the<00:05:24.330> air<00:05:24.449> back<00:05:24.750> in<00:05:25.020> before<00:05:25.229> the<00:05:25.529> lid

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:25.680 
lets all the air back in before the lid

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:28.189 
lets all the air back in before the lid
opens<00:05:26.039> up
