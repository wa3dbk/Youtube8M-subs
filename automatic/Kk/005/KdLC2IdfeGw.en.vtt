00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:14.430
 the year of 2009 will be definitively 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:17.200
 marked in the history of this woman 

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:19.300
 public servant in meadows up 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:21.760
 spent all his time at work and 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:24.130
 studies and August of that year however 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:26.950
 a report on Father's Day 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:33.430
 would bring back a sleeping will 

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:35.650
 dream of being a mother and when I read that 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:38.350
 matter I saw that the two were parents 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:40.600
 singles and they were aware of being such and 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:43.300
 raise your children at the same time 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.910
 I thought they are men and can 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.470
 To raise your children I am 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:50.110
 a maternal instinct because I do not 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:52.899
 get a parent honored 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:55.239
 in that report hernández professor 

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:56.920
 university has made a little decision 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:59.950
 common in 2005 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.910
 adopted two brothers paulo e 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:05.619
 tamires 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:07.990
 I always had a desire to have family but 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:09.850
 What happened to the 39 years as you 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:13.180
 said that it was a perception of what 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:15.729
 was being a little getting a little 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:17.890
 time maybe at that moment I went 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:20.890
 stimulated by a friend from December to 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.420
 that I take my paternity side 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.820
 silvia hernandez are part of a 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:27.070
 revealing statistics currently 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:29.590
 there are about 10 million 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:32.260
 families formed only by father or mother 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.990
 with children are biological or adoptive 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:36.430
 is the so-called single parent family 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.229
 recognized by the federal constitution of 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.869
 1988 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:43.509
 widowhood divorce or abandonment of the home 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:46.000
 can generate this familiar composition 

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:47.890
 but in the case of silvia hernandez a 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.229
 desire to be a mother and father 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.970
 even though singles made them 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:54.369
 opted for adoption 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:57.159
 This dream, however, can only be 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:59.530
 achieved thanks to a statute yuck 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:02.610
 of the child and adolescent who 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:05.170
 may adopt those over 18 years of age 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.540
 regardless of marital status 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:10.000
 this lawyer specializing in law 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:12.610
 explains that the eca was also 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.220
 fundamental to guarantee the rights of the 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:18.299
 adopted child establishes in its Article 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.440
 20 equal rights in the 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:22.260
 qualification 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:25.500
 between the children that the person 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:27.570
 eventually has it adopts a 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:31.100
 son and he will have 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:33.960
 He's going to be really his child right? 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:36.360
 I wish more work done in double 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:39.480
 the single routine gave way to a 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.530
 very different universe from father and mother to 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.080
 Same time 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:46.110
 Actually I changed everything because I was 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.820
 I used to go out in the morning and work 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.130
 Evening school usually did 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:52.470
 I always studied 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:54.960
 specialization so I was very 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.580
 A little time at home then my 

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:58.710
 life changed everything I stopped everything that I 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:03.570
 I was in the leave period 

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:05.310
 maternity leave adoption is not there 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:08.450
 everything because my life has turned into 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:11.790
 gabriel 2 years and 7 months after adoption 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:14.660
 continues to require almost 100% of the 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.650
 mother's attention even we can not 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:18.300
 exclusivity to talk to a 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.070
 barbecue on the child 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:22.020
 life changes the family has changed 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:23.970
 completely and son 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:25.860
 This, then, as a snack is not 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:27.870
 talking to you I noticed that I 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:30.480
 I arrived, he wants my full attention. 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:32.910
 All day long, so I have to 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:35.940
 unfolding a little more is logical, right and so 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:38.850
 You only have one period when you go. 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:39.660
 sleep even this routine is not exclusive 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:41.880
 from silvia 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.920
 as well as more than 8 million 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:46.890
 Brazilian households are formed only 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:50.670
 by women with children or more than 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:52.890
 80% of single-parent families for this 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:55.080
 anthropologists women's independence 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:58.380
 in society was largely responsible 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:04:00.750
 by the increase of this index, the 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:03.890
 women in the market 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:05.340
 of work is one of the issues 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:08.130
 development of methods 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:11.850
 contraceptives is another question 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:14.040
 higher education is for women but it is 

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:15.750
 a single man how can 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:17.500
 meet the challenges of this new 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:20.200
 family conception 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:22.450
 in the case of hernanes the functions of father 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:23.860
 are not limited to providing the 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:25.720
 house keeping 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:28.270
 my head very clear I'm father 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:30.820
 time understood and sometimes I 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:33.700
 I perform the task in the morning was then the 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:35.470
 Sometimes I like hair also by 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:45.160
 example is sometimes lunch preparation 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:47.980
 sometimes although hernández has accepted 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:49.930
 this maternal role was precisely the 

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:53.530
 female absence that generated greater 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:56.530
 challenge since the arrival of children but 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:59.770
 criticized this relationship when in the 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:01.960
 school colleagues asked about the 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:04.540
 morning on an almost 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:07.030
 that if the mother was not 

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:07.840
 this meant that the mother had 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:10.900
 died 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:16.990
 I went there at school and talked to the 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:27.479
 and to make it clear that the 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:31.210
 two have mother that the mother is alive and that 

00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:33.729
 they simply do not live for this 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:35.860
 doctor in psychology new role 

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:37.540
 played by man still generates 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:40.780
 prejudice that he is the man who goes 

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:42.910
 child care and so on is 

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:45.370
 being an extraordinary discovery is 

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:49.479
 which it is already for many a discovery 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:52.150
 extraordinary they discover the codec 

00:05:49.479 --> 00:05:55.090
 of affection may have taken care of their 

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:58.000
 own children while not fully 

00:05:55.090 --> 00:06:01.270
 social support and ernandes take advantage of 

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.880
 has already elected the figure 

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:06.160
 female of the family of this constitution 

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:09.630
 familiarity with the female presence 

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:12.430
 manifested in fifa by Tamires I think 

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:14.100
 at first it was intended to 

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:16.710
 be father 

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:22.950
 and I wanted to be the father of a boy in that 

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:26.640
 moment but when the family is not 

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:28.470
 is this female figure so if 

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:30.600
 manifest right 

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:36.720
 I did not believe when she prerogative 

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:38.670
 demon of subtlety a femininity 

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:41.430
 these things all the family and 

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:43.560
 brought to this I think it would be very 

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:45.810
 boring if it were just one me and the package in 

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:49.440
 house would be paulo would not be boring if 

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:51.420
 we do one thing it's true that silvia 

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:52.290
 hernandez are just two examples between 

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:54.150
 millions 

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:56.460
 the important thing is the recognition of 

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:58.710
 single-parent family left legacy to 

00:06:56.460 --> 00:07:00.830
 that other models look for space in the 

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:00.830
 society
