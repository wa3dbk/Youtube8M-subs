00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:12.710
 good morning friends from youtube I'm going to 

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:15.430
 teach three tricks that I found in kino 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:15.430
 of the totem 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:24.759
 well here I will teach you four 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:24.759
 tricks that mc what is 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:32.419
 the trick of the three weapons that is the most 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.510
 easy to make one can have three or 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:38.210
 all weapons that get one 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:41.230
 but you need to have a grenade to 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.230
 achieve this trick 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:51.290
 of agreement as you will see I am going to buy 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:52.800
 the Olympia 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:56.670
 I have 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:01:01.489
 the 9 millimeters of agreement look there 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.489
 to move on and more at the same time 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:06.940
 I have the grenade in my hand I throw it and 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:12.150
 as you will see now I have three weapons I have 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:12.150
 the m-14 the 9 millimeters and the clean 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.620
 agreement already saw the trick of the three 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:22.200
 weapons now I'm going to teach you the trick 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:24.840
 so the zombies do not attack them 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:28.070
 then they go here is the first 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.070
 room and it's 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:35.630
 1 2 3 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:37.790
 4 and 5 go to the fifth and move 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.840
 slowly to the right 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:43.740
 to get it right the trick they have 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:47.140
 the left post the right post 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:49.240
 it has to be vibrating or like that one 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.390
 I was working then the zombies 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.460
 they will no longer be attacked 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.250
 they will go down and you can 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.760
 shoot here all the zombies will be 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.760
 down here 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:03.080
 I remember that this video is for the 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.150
 wii console 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:08.840
 and how will you see the glitch doing well 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:12.190
 all the trick all the zombies will follow 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:14.740
 down and you can hit them 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:17.530
 okay now I'm going to teach you a 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:20.200
 trick for dogs if they have 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:23.320
 some problem are going to the doors of 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:26.250
 here and they get as close as they can 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:29.610
 here then the dogs will not attack them 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:33.340
 but they will be created quietly in front of 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:35.910
 your good and you can kill them without 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.950
 problem some 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:40.730
 As you can see, no dog comes because here 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.730
 my friends 2 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:47.150
 and come one look they stay still no 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:50.370
 will attack you then you can 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:53.459
 kill them without any problem 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:55.319
 agree the next trick is in the 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:59.370
 turret that is in the part of the 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:03:01.610
 elevator yes then you run to 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:05.150
 for chang 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:08.480
 it's a pretty difficult trick 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:11.350
 and you can upload here then no 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.350
 zombie will attack them
