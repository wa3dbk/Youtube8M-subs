00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:13.719
 the nuts have the 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:16.810
 characteristic that are known like that because 

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:19.570
 They contain 50% less water than 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:21.279
 remains of food then has a 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:24.849
 peculiarity that is a food with 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:27.989
 a lot of energy very concentrated in the 

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:30.800
 which its contribution in mineral vitamins 

00:00:27.989 --> 00:00:33.140
 and protein is very high 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.190
 the others have a wide range of 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.649
 nutrients among them we can highlight 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:40.190
 the antioxidant vitamin e 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:42.110
 the vitamin b that can be used to 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.510
 that people who are vegetarian 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:48.320
 we did not have to court milko in the diet 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:50.449
 we also have what is calcium for 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:53.030
 remove the other is has a contribution of 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:54.379
 fiber to try to improve or avoid 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.519
 constipation 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:59.600
 likewise it helps us reduce the 

00:00:55.519 --> 00:01:01.430
 cholesterol and has a synergy to the 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.170
 time to compensate a little what is the 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.089
 blood votes by large amount 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:08.270
 we can extend that clear to be a 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:09.590
 point that is very energetic increases 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.820
 much the word in the diet with the 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.520
 risk that a person can 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.410
 overweight obesity on the other hand 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.330
 it is a very allergenic product then 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:19.340
 Of course many people can be 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.530
 allergic to certain nuts 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:24.280
 then age should I avoid the 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.190
 consumption of such nuts as well 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.710
 what 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:31.320
 by digestion of the dried ones if a 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:35.340
 person suffering from constipation could 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.660
 get more gases flaws that can 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.910
 bother to consume said 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:41.310
 food but we could not consume it 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:42.540
 in high quantity first because of the excess 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.390
 of energy and another for the excess of 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.190
 carbon but without problem could 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.780
 consume the amount of the same as the non 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.820
 diabetics about 30-40 grams daily 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.070
 but always choosing those fruits 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.380
 dry that would help in this case to 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.790
 improve what diabetes is 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.580
 example of nuts like nuts 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.310
 in which 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:03.710
 they have a benefit at the level of 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:07.040
 insulin resistance that with it 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:08.750
 would help us not to happen with this 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:11.150
 we avoid having a patient a 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.240
 hyperglycemia due to that resistance to 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.620
 insulin and we would start it 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:19.130
 there is also the case of pistachios in 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:21.530
 which helps us counteract or 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.460
 compensate a little the glucose after 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.800
 the meals 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:26.390
 the so-called group toads real bread to not 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.880
 have very high glucose peaks 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.230
 after meals and so carry 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.590
 a blood glucose level more 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:32.590
 stable
