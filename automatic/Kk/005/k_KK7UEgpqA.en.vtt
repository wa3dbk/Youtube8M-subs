00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
so this is an interesting speaker design

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.960 
so this is an interesting speaker design
where<00:00:25.650> it's<00:00:25.800> actually<00:00:26.070> integrated<00:00:26.699> into<00:00:26.760> the

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
where it's actually integrated into the

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.620 
where it's actually integrated into the
palm<00:00:27.180> rest<00:00:27.210> I<00:00:27.720> was<00:00:28.380> a<00:00:28.439> bit<00:00:28.590> hesitant<00:00:28.740> about

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:29.630 
palm rest I was a bit hesitant about

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:31.970 
palm rest I was a bit hesitant about
well<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:30.750> placement<00:00:31.170> of<00:00:31.199> this<00:00:31.349> so<00:00:31.590> far<00:00:31.800> people

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
well the placement of this so far people

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.380 
well the placement of this so far people
have<00:00:32.130> gotten<00:00:32.340> involved<00:00:32.489> the<00:00:32.640> ergonomics<00:00:33.270> of

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
have gotten involved the ergonomics of

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.450 
have gotten involved the ergonomics of
the<00:00:33.510> sound<00:00:33.719> coming<00:00:33.870> out<00:00:34.020> my<00:00:34.110> ears<00:00:34.140> your<00:00:34.980> wrists

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
the sound coming out my ears your wrists

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.670 
the sound coming out my ears your wrists
and<00:00:35.760> well<00:00:36.149> the<00:00:36.510> palm<00:00:36.719> rest<00:00:36.870> is<00:00:37.020> usually<00:00:37.410> first

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
and well the palm rest is usually first

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.580 
and well the palm rest is usually first
you<00:00:38.100> kind<00:00:39.000> of<00:00:39.059> start<00:00:39.329> to<00:00:39.360> fade<00:00:39.690> from<00:00:39.989> where<00:00:40.260> but

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
you kind of start to fade from where but

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.500 
you kind of start to fade from where but
so<00:00:40.860> far<00:00:41.160> if<00:00:41.280> you<00:00:41.399> take<00:00:41.579> a<00:00:41.610> closer<00:00:41.969> look<00:00:42.120> at<00:00:42.390> it

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
so far if you take a closer look at it

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.110 
so far if you take a closer look at it
the<00:00:43.170> entire<00:00:43.829> netbook<00:00:44.340> is<00:00:44.460> covered<00:00:44.760> in<00:00:44.879> almost

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
the entire netbook is covered in almost

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.180 
the entire netbook is covered in almost
like<00:00:45.360> this<00:00:45.539> soft<00:00:48.350> it's<00:00:49.350> almost<00:00:49.410> rubberized

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
like this soft it's almost rubberized

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.819 
like this soft it's almost rubberized
but<00:00:50.430> it's<00:00:50.550> not<00:00:50.760> like<00:00:51.059> it<00:00:51.180> has<00:00:51.329> a<00:00:51.539> really<00:00:52.050> really

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
but it's not like it has a really really

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.310 
but it's not like it has a really really
expensive<00:00:53.250> luxurious<00:00:53.670> feel<00:00:54.239> to<00:00:54.390> it<00:00:54.539> like<00:00:55.079> I'm

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
expensive luxurious feel to it like I'm

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.840 
expensive luxurious feel to it like I'm
really<00:00:55.800> impressed<00:00:56.010> by<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.280> finish<00:00:56.579> of<00:00:56.699> this

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
really impressed by the finish of this

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.939 
really impressed by the finish of this
netbook<00:00:57.170> we've<00:00:58.170> move<00:00:58.320> on<00:00:58.410> to<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.649> trackpad

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
of what we'd expect from Toshiba it's a

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
thoughtful keys the shift keys a little

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:28.789 
thoughtful keys the shift keys a little
smaller<00:01:27.570> than<00:01:27.689> I<00:01:27.780> like<00:01:27.960> to<00:01:28.110> see<00:01:28.259> on<00:01:28.409> this<00:01:28.530> side

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
smaller than I like to see on this side

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.359 
smaller than I like to see on this side
on<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.820> left<00:01:30.030> is<00:01:30.240> actually<00:01:30.659> is<00:01:30.810> full<00:01:31.110> size<00:01:31.369> if

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
on the left is actually is full size if

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.270 
on the left is actually is full size if
we<00:01:32.610> look<00:01:32.790> at<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.180> arrows<00:01:33.689> I<00:01:34.590> don't<00:01:35.159> like

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
we look at the arrows I don't like

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.340 
we look at the arrows I don't like
seeing<00:01:35.520> this<00:01:35.700> wasted<00:01:36.090> space<00:01:36.150> but<00:01:36.720> overall

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
seeing this wasted space but overall

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.069 
seeing this wasted space but overall
that's<00:01:37.619> not<00:01:37.920> a<00:01:37.950> bad<00:01:38.189> design<00:01:38.520> feature<00:01:38.990> if<00:01:39.990> you

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
that's not a bad design feature if you

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.520 
that's not a bad design feature if you
take<00:01:40.259> a<00:01:40.290> look<00:01:40.500> it's<00:01:40.710> got<00:01:40.829> a<00:01:40.890> glossy<00:01:41.189> display

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
take a look it's got a glossy display

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.410 
take a look it's got a glossy display
power<00:01:43.530> button<00:01:43.829> there<00:01:43.979> in<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.159> middle<00:01:44.369> we<00:01:45.240> do

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
power button there in the middle we do

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.490 
power button there in the middle we do
have<00:01:45.689> the<00:01:46.020> 0.3<00:01:46.710> megapixel<00:01:46.829> camera<00:01:48.259> so<00:01:49.259> if<00:01:49.380> we

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
have the 0.3 megapixel camera so if we

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.710 
have the 0.3 megapixel camera so if we
shut<00:01:49.799> the<00:01:50.100> unit<00:01:50.250> this<00:01:50.880> is<00:01:50.939> gonna<00:01:51.119> come<00:01:51.420> in<00:01:51.570> this

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
shut the unit this is gonna come in this

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:07.969 
great textured finish I mean it really
just<00:02:06.719> this<00:02:07.200> is<00:02:07.350> probably<00:02:07.590> one<00:02:07.710> of<00:02:07.740> the<00:02:07.829> most

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
just this is probably one of the most

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.529 
just this is probably one of the most
expensive<00:02:08.399> finishes<00:02:08.910> I've<00:02:09.030> ever<00:02:09.179> seen<00:02:09.390> on<00:02:09.509> a

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
expensive finishes I've ever seen on a

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:10.249 
expensive finishes I've ever seen on a
netbook

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
netbook

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.960 
netbook
this<00:02:10.560> is<00:02:10.679> quite<00:02:10.979> good<00:02:11.250> so<00:02:11.580> we<00:02:11.700> took<00:02:11.790> a<00:02:11.879> look

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
this is quite good so we took a look

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.929 
this is quite good so we took a look
around<00:02:12.269> the<00:02:12.330> system<00:02:12.720> you've<00:02:12.930> got<00:02:13.110> the<00:02:13.200> PSU

00:02:13.929 --> 00:02:13.939 
around the system you've got the PSU

00:02:13.939 --> 00:02:15.770 
around the system you've got the PSU
Kensington<00:02:14.939> lock<00:02:15.060> in<00:02:15.239> the<00:02:15.329> front<00:02:15.569> there

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
Kensington lock in the front there

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.809 
Kensington lock in the front there
there's<00:02:16.709> the<00:02:17.040> wireless<00:02:17.760> LAN<00:02:17.970> the<00:02:18.299> fan<00:02:18.599> VGA<00:02:19.819> USB

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
there's the wireless LAN the fan VGA USB

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:22.339 
there's the wireless LAN the fan VGA USB
and<00:02:21.120> this<00:02:21.450> is<00:02:21.569> actually<00:02:21.959> something<00:02:22.170> that's

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:22.349 
and this is actually something that's

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:24.860 
and this is actually something that's
really<00:02:23.189> interesting<00:02:23.730> to<00:02:23.909> me<00:02:23.939> if<00:02:24.569> you<00:02:24.720> can<00:02:24.840> see

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
really interesting to me if you can see

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.449 
really interesting to me if you can see
there<00:02:25.260> it<00:02:25.379> kinda<00:02:25.620> says<00:02:25.860> sleep<00:02:28.220> so<00:02:29.220> what<00:02:29.340> this

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
there it kinda says sleep so what this

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:31.309 
there it kinda says sleep so what this
actually<00:02:29.519> means<00:02:29.879> is<00:02:30.239> if<00:02:30.329> you<00:02:30.480> plug<00:02:30.780> in<00:02:30.989> your

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
actually means is if you plug in your

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:34.130 
actually means is if you plug in your
iPod<00:02:32.099> or<00:02:32.430> Walkman<00:02:33.060> or<00:02:33.209> whatever<00:02:33.540> into<00:02:33.750> here

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
iPod or Walkman or whatever into here

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.740 
iPod or Walkman or whatever into here
you're<00:02:34.799> actually<00:02:35.280> going<00:02:35.519> to<00:02:35.640> be<00:02:35.909> able<00:02:36.209> to<00:02:36.359> play

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
you're actually going to be able to play

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.110 
you're actually going to be able to play
the<00:02:37.049> music<00:02:37.079> out<00:02:37.500> of<00:02:37.650> the<00:02:37.739> speakers<00:02:38.129> so<00:02:38.849> if<00:02:39.030> you

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
the music out of the speakers so if you

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.390 
the music out of the speakers so if you
can<00:02:39.269> plug<00:02:39.450> it<00:02:39.569> in<00:02:39.720> you<00:02:40.500> can<00:02:40.620> use<00:02:40.829> this<00:02:41.099> without

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
can plug it in you can use this without

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.550 
can plug it in you can use this without
actually<00:02:41.790> turning<00:02:42.209> the<00:02:42.359> unit<00:02:42.599> on<00:02:42.720> so<00:02:43.319> it<00:02:43.440> has

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
actually turning the unit on so it has

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.589 
actually turning the unit on so it has
the<00:02:43.739> sleep<00:02:43.950> to<00:02:44.099> music<00:02:44.370> function<00:02:44.790> and<00:02:45.000> the<00:02:45.299> USB

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:45.599 
the sleep to music function and the USB

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:47.390 
the sleep to music function and the USB
also<00:02:46.079> has<00:02:46.230> the<00:02:46.379> sleep<00:02:46.590> to<00:02:46.680> charge<00:02:46.950> function

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
also has the sleep to charge function

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.629 
also has the sleep to charge function
which<00:02:47.849> i<00:02:47.940> think<00:02:48.000> is<00:02:48.209> a<00:02:48.239> great<00:02:48.420> feature<00:02:49.519> so<00:02:50.519> if

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:50.639 
which i think is a great feature so if

00:02:50.639 --> 00:02:54.399 
which i think is a great feature so if
you<00:02:50.730> continue<00:02:51.000> to<00:02:51.150> look<00:02:51.269> around<00:02:51.569> the<00:02:51.690> unit<00:02:51.989> I

00:02:54.399 --> 00:02:54.409 

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:56.569 

believe<00:02:55.409> this<00:02:55.530> has<00:02:55.680> a<00:02:55.739> six<00:02:56.040> cell<00:02:56.190> battery<00:02:56.220> I'll

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:56.579 
believe this has a six cell battery I'll

00:02:56.579 --> 00:02:59.930 
believe this has a six cell battery I'll
pull<00:02:56.790> that<00:02:56.819> out<00:02:57.090> after<00:02:57.420> I<00:02:57.450> do<00:02:57.569> some<00:02:58.940> testing

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
pull that out after I do some testing

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.280 
pull that out after I do some testing
with<00:02:59.970> the<00:03:00.209> music<00:03:00.510> to<00:03:00.599> show<00:03:00.720> you<00:03:00.780> exactly<00:03:01.109> how

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
with the music to show you exactly how

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.149 
with the music to show you exactly how
great<00:03:01.769> these<00:03:02.010> speakers<00:03:02.400> are<00:03:03.739> and<00:03:04.739> then<00:03:04.889> on<00:03:05.069> the

00:03:05.149 --> 00:03:05.159 
great these speakers are and then on the

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:07.610 
great these speakers are and then on the
other<00:03:05.280> side<00:03:05.549> we<00:03:05.700> simply<00:03:05.849> have<00:03:06.239> two<00:03:06.900> USBs<00:03:07.379> near

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
other side we simply have two USBs near

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:08.930 
other side we simply have two USBs near
the<00:03:07.709> back<00:03:07.889> which<00:03:08.129> is<00:03:08.250> kind<00:03:08.459> of<00:03:08.519> nice<00:03:08.639> so<00:03:08.819> it's

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
the back which is kind of nice so it's

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:09.800 
the back which is kind of nice so it's
not<00:03:09.000> going<00:03:09.120> to<00:03:09.209> get<00:03:09.299> in<00:03:09.420> the<00:03:09.510> way<00:03:09.599> of<00:03:09.629> your

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
not going to get in the way of your

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.440 
not going to get in the way of your
typing<00:03:10.459> so<00:03:11.459> now<00:03:11.609> what<00:03:11.790> we're<00:03:11.909> gonna<00:03:12.000> do<00:03:12.239> is

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
we're actually gonna flip the unit on

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.280 
we're actually gonna flip the unit on
show<00:03:14.340> you<00:03:14.430> the<00:03:14.519> speakers<00:03:14.930> get<00:03:15.930> into<00:03:16.109> some<00:03:16.230> of

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
show you the speakers get into some of

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.159 
show you the speakers get into some of
the<00:03:16.349> functions<00:03:17.810> so<00:03:18.810> here<00:03:18.959> I've<00:03:19.049> actually

before<00:04:17.359> I<00:04:17.420> kind<00:04:17.540> of<00:04:17.690> wrap<00:04:17.900> things<00:04:17.930> up<00:04:18.320> let's

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:18.560 
before I kind of wrap things up let's

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.349 
before I kind of wrap things up let's
just<00:04:18.709> go<00:04:18.920> over<00:04:19.010> a<00:04:19.160> few<00:04:19.430> other<00:04:19.579> specs<00:04:20.000> I<00:04:20.180> don't

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:20.359 
just go over a few other specs I don't

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:23.020 
just go over a few other specs I don't
think<00:04:20.480> I<00:04:20.570> did<00:04:20.750> that<00:04:20.930> the<00:04:21.530> intel<00:04:22.130> atom<00:04:22.310> n550
