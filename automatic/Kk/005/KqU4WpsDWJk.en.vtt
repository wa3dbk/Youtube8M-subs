00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.300
 welcome all here 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:25.480
 this new year all the best 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.739
 wishes by the way to the very beautiful 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.329
 complex you see 

00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:30.880
 and also fantastic organized 

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:34.210
 by bit the trip my group 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.170
 I see so many children working there now 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.360
 to be 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:38.800
 that's how we all started 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.450
 I'm sure Adelinde who just got it 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.609
 this is how it started 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:43.600
 sail this way I am like that myself 

00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:45.489
 started 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.489
 we had a lot from home 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:49.690
 Welsh ponies and often has young ones 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:51.670
 the age of her parents' outpatient clinic 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:53.649
 and it was completely possessed 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:55.210
 of the ponies like most here 

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:56.920
 and then you also have to be because on one 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:00.879
 Give moment are you could 24 hours a day 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:02.469
 busy with those paths but we like me 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:03.940
 tell about the about the about the 

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:05.470
 dressage sport 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.960
 look often now starts a bit nicely 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:10.810
 to ride loose with the stallion he is 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.450
 Natchez therefore requires very young he is 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.219
 also made as a 4-year-old saddle broker 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:18.310
 so the fathers now a plus minus 2 years 

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:21.299
 under saddle and he does like 4 years 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:24.250
 or, of course, as a six-year-old already 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:26.170
 exercises are easy but we 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.340
 Always start with me with this globe 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:28.630
 punishment 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.700
 some pair we also start with loose 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:33.460
 galloping but then they have a lot 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.290
 ease in galloping and that is not possible 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.510
 pissed off 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:39.130
 some horses that just a little bit 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:42.190
 start stiff and especially the older ones 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:44.410
 horses that are not that flexible yet 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.580
 that I am going to let you go we p for that is 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:46.840
 have a little more ease with that 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.150
 muscles and just loose 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.040
 Loosen and he did not immediately filled with 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:53.260
 put the work but just nice one 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.240
 some gymnastics and that is normal 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:57.070
 very important for building muscle 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.920
 so you go very tasty now too 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:02.650
 forward downward in balance over the 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.690
 back so nice and slightly deeper than the 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:07.000
 match attitude and I find that in the 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:09.369
 match itself but the attitude acid 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.890
 usually not on not as bad as one 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:14.200
 young couple walking it a little bit like one 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.910
 pair of tidy straps that top line and 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.110
 neatly over the backbone I stand where 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.430
 prescribed ears 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.220
 must ultimately be the highest point 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:24.520
 but in the training we drive 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:26.560
 always a little too round around that top line 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.790
 very nice to loosen and too 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.470
 gymnastics 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:33.430
 and we actually do it in all three 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:35.410
 the corridors and often enough 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.880
 take your rest moment if you just 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.810
 immediately as often this just a minute or 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.280
 five to ten 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.340
 did you go again a few 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.180
 minutes walk for both rider and 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.480
 horse 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:48.640
 as a rider you must also always be focused 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:51.100
 continue to finish everything nicely and 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.640
 stay calm and never get angry 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:54.070
 on a horse 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:56.170
 because most of your evil determined as 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:03:00.340
 the art of driving ceases 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:01.959
 so try always very relaxed working 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.360
 to stay and if it's a day altogether 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:05.049
 don't want to just put it away for you 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.670
 pony 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:08.860
 go that day afterwards sacrifice at the time 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:11.230
 so shunt or join something else 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:13.239
 just my advice to everyone 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:15.340
 as human beings we sometimes sit myself 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:17.500
 and less in our own skin and then you want too 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.100
 not against and the result just like that 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.620
 good 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:22.420
 well if i am here in the ring i ryan 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.010
 I prepared well 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:27.280
 but here in the ring I get a lot 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:28.090
 tension what would you recommend me to 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.370
 to do 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:31.690
 yes we recommend to enter the ring very often 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:32.530
 but now you should try to 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:34.150
 release 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:36.370
 try couple there just like 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.860
 often well begig and here 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:41.620
 make you smile round set you up 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:44.049
 have a little more control over the 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.579
 whole horse from the front and behind well 

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:46.270
 stick to your inner leg and especially 

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:48.910
 if you have one 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:50.500
 connected sides neatly on close 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:52.540
 a bit between inside leg 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:54.520
 and and and the heels I would 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:55.600
 and then try the comb that 

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:58.120
 gain control 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:00.550
 no yes well explained i am also one 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.950
 super happy that he is so relaxed in this 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:04.770
 kind of ambience it gets and that is 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:07.480
 just purely for the fact that it simply has to 

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:10.390
 have done so often and have practiced 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:11.740
 and every time but because I take 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:13.480
 know the very first time I have 

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:15.520
 his huge home 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:17.830
 I really don't fit two in the same 

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:20.290
 remain faith because continuous to it 

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:23.500
 solo observer boys and and books 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:25.540
 and now it's just so relaxed and now 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:28.030
 she goes so diesel it such a volte 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:30.250
 gradually all the bit shutter then 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:32.260
 see your couple going to fall behind and becoming 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:34.180
 take more weight and always 

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:36.190
 walked up more easily 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.510
 that is just important ground without 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:40.450
 that very defeated 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:42.100
 Slightly gives help him defy the walk 

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:43.960
 just a little bit from the bottom 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:45.490
 and if not and they clicked there once 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.900
 a little thoughtful 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:49.120
 then you can feel them connect a little more 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:51.130
 and then you just see the talk 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:52.690
 more to fall in the hindleg 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:55.030
 and still easy on the ball for it 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:57.010
 walk and I close a little dolphin 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:05:00.520
 well so I'll get out of the circle 

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:02.230
 I suffer from it often if so 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:03.160
 where he drove so very easily 

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:05.380
 above 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:07.330
 look super see your horse behind her 

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:09.610
 with hurry with the hock joint is like that 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:11.560
 come to the ground and fall 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:13.480
 we look super heavy for a 6 hunter 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:15.220
 maven and half round for round 

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:16.870
 and then you go out again and there he wants 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:19.090
 a round about the back own piece for 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:21.250
 oasis through your variety and so on 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:23.860
 continue to train your horse 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:25.990
 Zoe with a few getting more beautiful 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:28.090
 to get on the hindleg and always 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:29.710
 make beautiful technology and that is just 

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:33.550
 very important 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:34.800
 for rows for 99% basic, just something of it 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:36.850
 Father also ride it or the one 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:41.350
 three-year drive passed 

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:43.390
 private pure paths nicely training nicely 

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:46.300
 on two turbos nicely between seat and legs 

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:47.520
 That means just riding and 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:52.250
 I think that's important 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:52.250
 and then the performance comes from itself
