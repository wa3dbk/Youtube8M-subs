one<00:00:37.440> is<00:00:37.770> which<00:00:38.250> I'm<00:00:38.640> sure<00:00:38.910> that<00:00:39.120> they<00:00:39.239> all<00:00:39.270> work

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
one is which I'm sure that they all work

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.799 
one is which I'm sure that they all work
so<00:00:39.950> you<00:00:40.950> just<00:00:41.100> pick<00:00:41.340> any<00:00:41.550> of<00:00:41.760> them<00:00:41.879> and<00:00:42.059> place

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
so you just pick any of them and place

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.290 
so you just pick any of them and place
it<00:00:42.989> in<00:00:43.110> your<00:00:43.140> file<00:00:43.500> share<00:00:43.850> and<00:00:44.850> you<00:00:45.059> could<00:00:45.180> do

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
it in your file share and you could do

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.860 
it in your file share and you could do
the<00:00:45.329> same<00:00:45.750> thing<00:00:46.079> for<00:00:46.770> all<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.309> other<00:00:47.870> game

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870

scroll over and then pick the next one
and<00:00:56.399> you<00:00:56.730> can<00:00:56.879> go<00:00:57.000> through<00:00:57.030> and<00:00:57.449> get<00:00:57.600> all<00:00:57.840> of

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
and you can go through and get all of

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.049 
and you can go through and get all of
them<00:00:58.109> and<00:00:58.320> I've<00:00:58.920> seen<00:00:59.100> some<00:00:59.370> other<00:00:59.820> weird

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
them and I've seen some other weird

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.000 
them and I've seen some other weird
things<00:01:00.390> in<00:01:00.510> here<00:01:00.960> too<00:01:01.230> I<00:01:01.500> think<00:01:01.710> there<00:01:01.859> are

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
things in here too I think there are

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.579 
things in here too I think there are
other<00:01:02.550> custom<00:01:03.359> game<00:01:03.629> types<00:01:03.960> I<00:01:04.199> think<00:01:04.409> there's

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
other custom game types I think there's

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.080 
other custom game types I think there's
some<00:01:04.799> that<00:01:04.920> you<00:01:05.010> could<00:01:05.129> do<00:01:05.220> with<00:01:05.309> our<00:01:05.519> CX<00:01:05.820> DS

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
some that you could do with our CX DS

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.609 
some that you could do with our CX DS
and<00:01:06.450> there's<00:01:06.960> some<00:01:07.110> in<00:01:07.200> there<00:01:07.350> that<00:01:07.500> are

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
and there's some in there that are

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.130 
and there's some in there that are
labeled<00:01:07.799> zombies<00:01:08.490> but<00:01:08.760> every<00:01:09.330> one<00:01:09.570> of<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:09.900> I
