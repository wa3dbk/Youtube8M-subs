00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
you mangle this to the extent that when

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.480 
you mangle this to the extent that when
you<00:02:00.119> put<00:02:00.299> it<00:02:00.390> on<00:02:00.540> you<00:02:01.290> mangle<00:02:01.710> it<00:02:01.860> so<00:02:02.100> that<00:02:02.280> when

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
you put it on you mangle it so that when

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.819 
you put it on you mangle it so that when
your<00:02:02.670> pot<00:02:02.880> is<00:02:03.119> full<00:02:03.329> of<00:02:03.509> water<00:02:03.689> and<00:02:04.020> you<00:02:04.110> drop

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
your pot is full of water and you drop

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.639 
your pot is full of water and you drop
it<00:02:05.070> the<00:02:05.850> lid<00:02:06.060> shouldn't<00:02:06.390> come<00:02:06.570> off<00:02:06.810> and<00:02:07.110> most

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
it the lid shouldn't come off and most

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.260 
it the lid shouldn't come off and most
of<00:02:07.829> the<00:02:07.890> water<00:02:08.039> should<00:02:08.310> stay<00:02:08.550> in<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:08.819> pot<00:02:09.000> most

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
of the water should stay in the pot most

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.089 
of the water should stay in the pot most
of<00:02:09.420> the<00:02:09.479> soup<00:02:09.720> should<00:02:09.899> stay<00:02:10.170> in<00:02:10.229> the<00:02:10.349> pot<00:02:10.530> so

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
of the soup should stay in the pot so

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.700 
of the soup should stay in the pot so
that<00:02:11.280> that's<00:02:12.120> now<00:02:12.360> now

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
that that's now now

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.970 
that that's now now
this<00:02:13.830> this<00:02:14.820> is<00:02:15.030> also<00:02:15.240> an<00:02:15.510> option<00:02:15.930> but<00:02:16.620> you<00:02:16.680> know

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
this this is also an option but you know

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.320 
this this is also an option but you know
between<00:02:17.370> this<00:02:17.580> so<00:02:17.820> this<00:02:17.970> might<00:02:18.210> have

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
between this so this might have

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:19.820 
between this so this might have
originally<00:02:18.840> been<00:02:18.960> more<00:02:19.290> of<00:02:19.380> a<00:02:19.470> coffeepot

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
originally been more of a coffeepot

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.080 
originally been more of a coffeepot
there<00:02:20.190> might<00:02:20.340> have<00:02:20.370> been<00:02:20.490> a<00:02:20.580> percolator

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
there might have been a percolator

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.390 
there might have been a percolator
inside<00:02:21.600> but<00:02:22.320> all<00:02:22.500> these<00:02:22.680> things<00:02:22.740> and<00:02:23.160> it's<00:02:23.250> an

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
inside but all these things and it's an

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.400 
inside but all these things and it's an
excellent<00:02:23.670> pun<00:02:23.910> now<00:02:24.090> dawn<00:02:24.360> analyzes<00:02:25.260> them

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
excellent pun now dawn analyzes them

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.010 
excellent pun now dawn analyzes them
black<00:02:25.650> okay<00:02:26.340> when<00:02:26.640> I<00:02:26.670> had<00:02:26.940> discussions<00:02:27.660> I<00:02:27.810> got

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
black okay when I had discussions I got

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.580 
black okay when I had discussions I got
an<00:02:28.170> old<00:02:28.820> manual<00:02:29.820> used<00:02:30.270> by<00:02:30.660> plumbers<00:02:31.110> teaching

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
an old manual used by plumbers teaching

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.160 
an old manual used by plumbers teaching
apprentice<00:02:32.070> plumbers<00:02:32.430> in<00:02:32.610> the<00:02:32.730> UK<00:02:33.120> they<00:02:34.020> had

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
apprentice plumbers in the UK they had

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:35.600 
apprentice plumbers in the UK they had
all<00:02:34.290> kinds<00:02:34.560> of<00:02:34.620> stuff<00:02:34.800> about<00:02:34.890> reflectivity

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
all kinds of stuff about reflectivity

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.270 
all kinds of stuff about reflectivity
and<00:02:35.940> so<00:02:36.090> on<00:02:36.210> and<00:02:36.420> they<00:02:36.480> said<00:02:36.720> a<00:02:36.780> black<00:02:37.080> pot<00:02:37.380> will

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
and so on and they said a black pot will

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.210 
and so on and they said a black pot will
come<00:02:38.970> to<00:02:39.150> a<00:02:39.180> boil<00:02:39.510> with<00:02:39.780> half<00:02:40.020> the<00:02:40.290> fuel<00:02:40.470> that<00:02:41.160> a

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
come to a boil with half the fuel that a

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.790 
come to a boil with half the fuel that a
shiny<00:02:41.520> pot<00:02:41.820> will<00:02:42.060> so<00:02:42.810> the<00:02:42.930> shininess<00:02:43.350> on<00:02:43.710> the

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
shiny pot will so the shininess on the

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.500 
shiny pot will so the shininess on the
outside<00:02:44.130> of<00:02:44.250> the<00:02:44.340> pot<00:02:44.550> you're<00:02:45.180> fighting

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
outside of the pot you're fighting

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.180 
outside of the pot you're fighting
against<00:02:45.900> it<00:02:46.050> and<00:02:46.200> it's<00:02:46.350> reflecting<00:02:46.890> in<00:02:46.980> a<00:02:47.040> lot

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
against it and it's reflecting in a lot

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.550 
against it and it's reflecting in a lot
of<00:02:47.280> the<00:02:47.400> heat<00:02:47.550> and<00:02:47.760> if<00:02:48.060> it's<00:02:48.210> black<00:02:48.450> and<00:02:48.750> so<00:02:49.380> on

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
of the heat and if it's black and so on

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.010 
of the heat and if it's black and so on
and<00:02:49.770> on<00:02:50.340> and<00:02:50.520> on<00:02:50.580> I<00:02:50.790> could<00:02:51.120> talk<00:02:51.300> longer<00:02:51.600> maybe

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.020 
and on and on I could talk longer maybe

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:54.740 
and on and on I could talk longer maybe
the<00:02:52.260> pot<00:02:52.740> should<00:02:52.950> have<00:02:53.120> rounded<00:02:54.120> corners<00:02:54.660> and

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
the pot should have rounded corners and

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.200 
the pot should have rounded corners and
everything<00:02:54.990> but<00:02:55.890> for<00:02:56.100> general<00:02:56.460> purposes<00:02:57.000> and

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:57.210 
everything but for general purposes and

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:59.390 
everything but for general purposes and
availability<00:02:57.720> you're<00:02:58.560> just<00:02:59.070> like<00:02:59.220> when<00:02:59.370> I

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
availability you're just like when I

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.760 
availability you're just like when I
pick<00:03:00.000> up<00:03:00.150> this<00:03:00.300> morning<00:03:00.690> knife<00:03:00.840> and<00:03:01.050> I<00:03:01.110> say<00:03:01.320> you

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:01.770 
pick up this morning knife and I say you

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:04.610 
pick up this morning knife and I say you
just<00:03:02.160> asked<00:03:02.430> me<00:03:02.640> what<00:03:03.180> does<00:03:03.390> a<00:03:03.420> good<00:03:04.200> survival

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
just asked me what does a good survival

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.010 
just asked me what does a good survival
knife<00:03:05.040> look<00:03:05.310> like<00:03:05.550> and<00:03:06.150> I'll<00:03:06.270> say<00:03:06.600> it<00:03:06.750> looks

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.020 
knife look like and I'll say it looks

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.990 
knife look like and I'll say it looks
like<00:03:07.080> that<00:03:07.470> let's<00:03:08.220> say<00:03:08.430> this<00:03:08.610> is<00:03:08.790> not<00:03:08.940> a

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
like that let's say this is not a

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.700 
like that let's say this is not a
survival<00:03:09.540> knife<00:03:09.570> because<00:03:10.080> maybe<00:03:10.290> it<00:03:10.530> should

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:10.710 
survival knife because maybe it should

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:13.220 
survival knife because maybe it should
be<00:03:10.740> more<00:03:10.890> durable<00:03:11.370> but<00:03:12.330> for<00:03:12.540> the<00:03:12.600> price<00:03:12.870> it's

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
be more durable but for the price it's

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.160 
be more durable but for the price it's
an<00:03:13.410> extremely<00:03:14.100> functional<00:03:14.670> knife<00:03:15.060> and<00:03:15.810> same

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
an extremely functional knife and same

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.170 
an extremely functional knife and same
with<00:03:16.350> this<00:03:16.500> pot<00:03:16.740> you<00:03:17.430> know<00:03:17.550> somebody<00:03:17.970> might

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
with this pot you know somebody might

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:19.850 
with this pot you know somebody might
come<00:03:18.360> up<00:03:18.510> with<00:03:18.540> something<00:03:19.080> better<00:03:19.230> maybe

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
come up with something better maybe

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:22.100 
come up with something better maybe
something<00:03:20.460> that<00:03:20.490> goes<00:03:20.820> on<00:03:21.090> that<00:03:21.690> you<00:03:21.750> have<00:03:22.080> a

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
something that goes on that you have a

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:23.750 
something that goes on that you have a
controller<00:03:22.590> over<00:03:22.770> the<00:03:22.950> spout<00:03:23.220> so<00:03:23.490> you<00:03:23.580> don't

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
controller over the spout so you don't

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.340 
controller over the spout so you don't
lose<00:03:23.970> through<00:03:24.180> the<00:03:24.270> spout<00:03:24.540> and<00:03:24.960> when<00:03:25.080> you<00:03:25.170> put

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
lose through the spout and when you put

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:26.840 
lose through the spout and when you put
the<00:03:25.440> lid<00:03:25.620> on<00:03:25.650> maybe<00:03:26.040> you<00:03:26.160> take<00:03:26.370> a<00:03:26.400> little<00:03:26.670> bit

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
the lid on maybe you take a little bit

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:28.430 
the lid on maybe you take a little bit
of<00:03:27.000> a<00:03:27.060> turn<00:03:27.330> and<00:03:27.360> it's<00:03:27.690> locked<00:03:28.020> on<00:03:28.290> there

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
of a turn and it's locked on there

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.340 
of a turn and it's locked on there
unless<00:03:28.620> you<00:03:28.860> turn<00:03:29.040> it<00:03:29.220> on<00:03:29.390> you<00:03:30.390> can<00:03:30.570> really<00:03:30.930> get

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350 
unless you turn it on you can really get

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:33.110 
unless you turn it on you can really get
go<00:03:31.800> go<00:03:32.130> off<00:03:32.340> maybe

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
go go off maybe

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.120 
go go off maybe
now<00:03:33.390> if<00:03:33.780> I<00:03:33.960> have<00:03:34.110> a<00:03:34.140> pot<00:03:34.440> that's<00:03:34.680> twice<00:03:34.860> as<00:03:34.920> big

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
now if I have a pot that's twice as big

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:37.220 
now if I have a pot that's twice as big

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:14.850 
September and I find one scene that I

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:16.490 
September and I find one scene that I
take<00:04:15.120> apart<00:04:15.480> in<00:04:15.690> that<00:04:15.840> jacket<00:04:16.290> and<00:04:16.320> I<00:04:16.440> don't

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
take apart in that jacket and I don't

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.020 
take apart in that jacket and I don't
have<00:04:16.799> this<00:04:16.950> here<00:04:17.160> because<00:04:17.400> I<00:04:17.430> travel<00:04:17.850> long

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
have this here because I travel long

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:20.660 
have this here because I travel long
distance<00:04:18.450> yeah<00:04:18.930> and<00:04:19.230> you<00:04:19.530> take<00:04:19.739> the<00:04:19.950> downs

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:20.670 
distance yeah and you take the downs

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:22.580 
distance yeah and you take the downs
from<00:04:21.000> the<00:04:21.180> other<00:04:21.330> jackets<00:04:21.870> and<00:04:22.049> double<00:04:22.470> the

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
from the other jackets and double the

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:23.420 
from the other jackets and double the
amount<00:04:22.800> it<00:04:22.919> down

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
amount it down

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.280 
amount it down
that's<00:04:24.030> called<00:04:24.270> the<00:04:24.390> double<00:04:24.660> stuff<00:04:24.900> and<00:04:25.230> that

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:25.290 
that's called the double stuff and that

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:27.930 
that's called the double stuff and that
probably<00:04:25.890> really<00:04:26.550> improves<00:04:26.970> its

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:27.940 
probably really improves its

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:30.450 
probably really improves its
value<00:04:28.390> because<00:04:28.750> it's<00:04:28.930> how<00:04:29.440> hard<00:04:30.070> it<00:04:30.280> is<00:04:30.400> for

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:30.460 
value because it's how hard it is for

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:32.940 
value because it's how hard it is for
you<00:04:30.910> to<00:04:31.300> substitute<00:04:31.900> for<00:04:32.110> down<00:04:32.290> jacket<00:04:32.770> and

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:32.950 
you to substitute for down jacket and

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:36.720 
you to substitute for down jacket and
how<00:04:33.700> it<00:04:33.970> takes<00:04:34.840> the<00:04:35.050> place<00:04:35.260> of<00:04:35.320> a<00:04:36.040> sleeping<00:04:36.610> bag

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:36.730 
how it takes the place of a sleeping bag

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:39.090 
how it takes the place of a sleeping bag
now<00:04:37.300> the<00:04:37.360> down<00:04:37.720> jacket<00:04:38.230> should<00:04:38.410> have<00:04:38.620> down<00:04:38.830> in

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:39.100 
now the down jacket should have down in

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:40.320 
now the down jacket should have down in
the<00:04:39.220> sleeves<00:04:39.460> you<00:04:39.640> don't<00:04:39.790> have<00:04:39.940> to<00:04:40.060> increase

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.330 
the sleeves you don't have to increase

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.540 
the sleeves you don't have to increase
the<00:04:40.510> down<00:04:40.690> there<00:04:40.960> but<00:04:41.590> if<00:04:41.740> that's<00:04:42.010> synthetic

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:42.550 
the down there but if that's synthetic

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.840 
the down there but if that's synthetic
filler

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:42.850 
filler

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:44.820 
filler
it'll<00:04:43.210> be<00:04:43.330> bulk<00:04:43.630> up<00:04:43.840> the<00:04:43.870> situation<00:04:44.590> and

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:44.830 
it'll be bulk up the situation and

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:46.350 
it'll be bulk up the situation and
you'll<00:04:45.250> find<00:04:45.550> that<00:04:45.700> it<00:04:45.880> bothers<00:04:46.210> you<00:04:46.330> that

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:46.360 
you'll find that it bothers you that

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.720 
you'll find that it bothers you that
it's<00:04:46.780> taking<00:04:47.170> more<00:04:47.590> space<00:04:47.950> than<00:04:48.190> it<00:04:48.310> should<00:04:48.550> so

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:48.730 
it's taking more space than it should so

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:51.390 
it's taking more space than it should so

be separate because it's awkward to

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:07.920 
be separate because it's awkward to

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:11.440 
then things that when they on coiled and

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:13.080 
then things that when they on coiled and
you're<00:06:11.590> trying<00:06:11.770> to<00:06:11.830> coil<00:06:12.040> them<00:06:12.250> and<00:06:12.460> this<00:06:12.880> is<00:06:13.060> a

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:13.090 
you're trying to coil them and this is a

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:15.000 
you're trying to coil them and this is a
rather<00:06:13.270> tight<00:06:13.600> curl<00:06:13.870> so<00:06:14.169> you<00:06:14.230> you<00:06:14.560> carry<00:06:14.830> that

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:15.010 
rather tight curl so you you carry that

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:17.100 
rather tight curl so you you carry that
in<00:06:15.190> your<00:06:15.220> waist<00:06:15.570> theoretically<00:06:16.570> could<00:06:16.870> carry

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:17.110 
in your waist theoretically could carry

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:19.050 
in your waist theoretically could carry
the<00:06:17.590> Sonia<00:06:18.010> race<00:06:18.190> the<00:06:18.370> knife<00:06:18.550> around<00:06:18.730> your

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:21.760 
neck and many people attach the rod to

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:23.760 
neck and many people attach the rod to
the<00:06:21.910> knife<00:06:22.090> case<00:06:22.360> and<00:06:22.630> then<00:06:23.230> they<00:06:23.410> got<00:06:23.590> all

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:23.770 
the knife case and then they got all

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:26.100 
the knife case and then they got all
those<00:06:23.980> there<00:06:24.400> and<00:06:24.580> then<00:06:24.700> whatever<00:06:25.060> is<00:06:25.270> left<00:06:25.360> if

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:26.110 
those there and then whatever is left if

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:28.950 
those there and then whatever is left if
I<00:06:26.260> take<00:06:26.590> a<00:06:26.830> pot<00:06:27.310> and<00:06:27.640> I<00:06:28.330> put<00:06:28.540> it<00:06:28.600> in<00:06:28.660> a<00:06:28.780> down
