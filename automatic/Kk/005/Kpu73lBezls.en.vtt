00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.490 

so<00:00:01.260> the<00:00:01.790> Voyager<00:00:02.790> edge<00:00:02.970> is<00:00:03.270> a<00:00:03.500> upgraded

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:04.500 
so the Voyager edge is a upgraded

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.740 
so the Voyager edge is a upgraded
version<00:00:04.980> from<00:00:05.279> what<00:00:05.759> was<00:00:06.029> known<00:00:06.270> as<00:00:06.299> the

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
version from what was known as the

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.500 
version from what was known as the
discovery<00:00:07.290> version<00:00:07.830> from<00:00:08.389> Plantronics<00:00:09.389> and

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
discovery version from Plantronics and

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.940 
discovery version from Plantronics and
this<00:00:09.599> is<00:00:09.710> expense<00:00:10.710> evan<00:00:11.130> 5se<00:00:12.030> version<00:00:12.540> so<00:00:13.290> the

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
this is expense evan 5se version so the

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.029 
this is expense evan 5se version so the
1975<00:00:14.730> SC<00:00:15.210> you'll<00:00:15.599> notice<00:00:15.960> does<00:00:16.650> look<00:00:16.859> very

station<00:00:42.690> and<00:00:43.070> if<00:00:44.070> we<00:00:44.219> take<00:00:44.399> out<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.820> headset

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
station and if we take out the headset

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.060 
station and if we take out the headset
you<00:00:45.510> notice<00:00:46.079> how<00:00:46.200> it<00:00:46.350> lights<00:00:46.530> up<00:00:46.710> right<00:00:46.920> there

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
you notice how it lights up right there

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.709 
you notice how it lights up right there
because<00:00:47.190> I<00:00:47.340> just<00:00:47.370> popped<00:00:47.730> it<00:00:47.820> up<00:00:47.910> you<00:00:48.510> notice

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
because I just popped it up you notice

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.240 
because I just popped it up you notice
that<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:48.930> gels<00:00:49.140> are<00:00:49.320> pretty<00:00:49.500> similar<00:00:49.770> except

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
that the gels are pretty similar except

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.750 
that the gels are pretty similar except
a<00:00:50.340> gel<00:00:50.579> in<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:51.829> and<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:53.039> edge<00:00:53.190> is<00:00:53.460> a<00:00:53.489> little

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
a gel in the and the edge is a little

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.869 
a gel in the and the edge is a little
bit<00:00:53.850> thinner<00:00:54.059> see<00:00:54.930> that<00:00:55.489> but<00:00:56.489> it's<00:00:56.699> pretty

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
bit thinner see that but it's pretty

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.340 
bit thinner see that but it's pretty
much<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.750> same

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
much the same

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.260 
much the same
now<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.520> headsets<00:00:59.940> themselves<00:01:01.820> to<00:01:02.820> me<00:01:02.910> they

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
now the headsets themselves to me they

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.870 
now the headsets themselves to me they
weigh<00:01:03.750> very<00:01:04.049> similarly<00:01:04.830> so<00:01:05.400> I<00:01:05.430> don't<00:01:05.820> know

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
weigh very similarly so I don't know

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.789 
weigh very similarly so I don't know
that<00:01:06.030> there's<00:01:06.210> much<00:01:06.450> being<00:01:06.780> saved<00:01:07.080> there<00:01:07.409> and

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
that there's much being saved there and

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.560 
that there's much being saved there and
you<00:01:08.010> notice<00:01:08.280> that<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.490> design<00:01:08.850> is<00:01:08.880> also<00:01:09.240> very

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
you notice that the design is also very

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.350 
you notice that the design is also very
simple<00:01:09.840> or<00:01:10.170> similar<00:01:10.710> this<00:01:11.640> one<00:01:11.850> does<00:01:12.000> not<00:01:12.119> have

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
simple or similar this one does not have

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.039 
simple or similar this one does not have
that<00:01:12.390> triple<00:01:13.290> mic<00:01:14.250> technology<00:01:15.119> alright<00:01:15.840> and

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
that triple mic technology alright and

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.570 
that triple mic technology alright and
you<00:01:16.140> can<00:01:16.170> see<00:01:16.380> that<00:01:16.530> by<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:16.710> design<00:01:17.220> I<00:01:17.430> know

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
you can see that by the design I know

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.520 
you can see that by the design I know
what's<00:01:17.729> going<00:01:17.970> on<00:01:18.090> here<00:01:18.420> on<00:01:18.570> this<00:01:19.110> one<00:01:19.320> you

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
what's going on here on this one you

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.820 
what's going on here on this one you
don't<00:01:19.650> see<00:01:19.770> that<00:01:19.950> at<00:01:20.159> all<00:01:20.250> right<00:01:20.970> and<00:01:21.710> what<00:01:22.710> you

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
don't see that at all right and what you

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.670 
don't see that at all right and what you
find<00:01:23.009> is<00:01:23.220> that<00:01:23.460> it<00:01:23.759> does<00:01:24.150> have<00:01:24.530> it<00:01:25.530> doesn't

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
find is that it does have it doesn't

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.100 
find is that it does have it doesn't
have<00:01:25.950> that<00:01:26.189> you<00:01:27.180> know<00:01:27.270> those<00:01:27.420> multifunction

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
you notice that with the edge we have

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.450 
you notice that with the edge we have
the<00:01:38.340> charging<00:01:38.820> we<00:01:39.329> have<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.630> volume<00:01:40.049> here<00:01:40.619> and

the charging we have the volume here and

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.999 
the charging we have the volume here and
then<00:01:41.759> we<00:01:41.850> have<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.090> on<00:01:42.240> here<00:01:42.810> and<00:01:43.680> you<00:01:43.860> have

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.700 
changed a little bit so you have more of
a<00:01:47.880> switch<00:01:48.180> than<00:01:48.750> in<00:01:48.990> this<00:01:49.140> version<00:01:49.320> you<00:01:49.530> had<00:01:49.680> a

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
a switch than in this version you had a

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.789 
a switch than in this version you had a
actual<00:01:50.250> push<00:01:50.549> button<00:01:51.020> if<00:01:52.020> we<00:01:52.259> were<00:01:52.350> to<00:01:52.470> compare

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
actual push button if we were to compare

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.340 
actual push button if we were to compare
now<00:01:53.009> oh<00:01:53.250> set<00:01:53.670> these<00:01:53.850> guys<00:01:54.000> aside<00:01:54.390> if<00:01:54.689> you<00:01:54.990> were

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
now oh set these guys aside if you were

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.499 
now oh set these guys aside if you were
to<00:01:55.470> compare<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:55.770> cases<00:01:56.340> I<00:01:56.579> thought<00:01:57.360> at<00:01:57.479> first

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
to compare the cases I thought at first

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.780 
to compare the cases I thought at first
that<00:01:57.930> the<00:01:58.049> case<00:01:58.229> was<00:01:58.409> bigger<00:01:58.770> maybe<00:01:59.610> it's<00:01:59.759> a

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
that the case was bigger maybe it's a

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.179 
that the case was bigger maybe it's a
little<00:01:59.969> bit<00:02:00.060> longer<00:02:00.390> not<00:02:01.259> that<00:02:01.469> much<00:02:01.680> yeah

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
little bit longer not that much yeah

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.550 
little bit longer not that much yeah
look<00:02:02.399> at<00:02:02.490> it<00:02:02.579> right<00:02:02.640> there<00:02:02.899> from<00:02:03.899> from<00:02:04.229> bottom

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
look at it right there from from bottom

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.910 
look at it right there from from bottom
to<00:02:04.590> top

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
to top

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.200 
to top
it's<00:02:05.280> just<00:02:05.460> designed<00:02:05.790> a<00:02:05.969> little<00:02:06.090> bit

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
it's just designed a little bit

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:11.320 
it's just designed a little bit
differently<00:02:06.299> so<00:02:07.310> this<00:02:08.310> case<00:02:09.149> for<00:02:10.110> the<00:02:10.319> 975

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
differently so this case for the 975

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.360 
differently so this case for the 975
closes<00:02:12.590> you<00:02:13.590> know<00:02:13.680> you<00:02:13.860> rest<00:02:14.129> it

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
closes you know you rest it

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.580 
closes you know you rest it
it<00:02:14.519> goes<00:02:14.670> into<00:02:14.849> another<00:02:15.260> microUSB<00:02:16.260> charging

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
it goes into another microUSB charging

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.380 
it goes into another microUSB charging
and<00:02:16.830> you<00:02:17.220> use<00:02:17.430> this<00:02:17.580> button<00:02:17.760> to<00:02:18.030> get<00:02:18.120> it<00:02:18.180> out

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
and you use this button to get it out

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:24.140 
and you use this button to get it out
and<00:02:18.860> with<00:02:19.860> the<00:02:20.299> edge<00:02:21.299> all<00:02:22.140> you<00:02:22.409> do<00:02:22.620> is<00:02:23.030> rest<00:02:24.030> it

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
and with the edge all you do is rest it

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.580 
and with the edge all you do is rest it
in<00:02:24.239> and<00:02:24.360> as<00:02:24.420> I<00:02:24.540> showed<00:02:24.750> you<00:02:24.780> you<00:02:25.260> push<00:02:25.470> your

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
in and as I showed you you push your

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:26.809 
in and as I showed you you push your
finger<00:02:25.860> through<00:02:26.010> the<00:02:26.129> bottom<00:02:26.400> don't<00:02:26.549> pull<00:02:26.730> it

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
finger through the bottom don't pull it

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:28.369 
finger through the bottom don't pull it
through<00:02:27.000> the<00:02:27.090> top<00:02:27.299> and<00:02:27.540> then<00:02:27.870> that<00:02:28.200> will<00:02:28.349> make

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:28.379 
through the top and then that will make

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:30.740 
through the top and then that will make
it<00:02:28.860> pop<00:02:29.040> out<00:02:29.220> it<00:02:30.030> didn't<00:02:30.299> come<00:02:30.420> with<00:02:30.450> this

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
it pop out it didn't come with this

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.899 
it pop out it didn't come with this
nifty<00:02:31.049> little<00:02:31.230> hook<00:02:32.069> that<00:02:32.459> came<00:02:32.700> with<00:02:32.879> my

00:02:32.899 --> 00:02:32.909 
nifty little hook that came with my

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:35.899 
nifty little hook that came with my
older<00:02:33.750> one<00:02:34.019> so<00:02:34.620> you<00:02:35.129> know<00:02:35.220> if<00:02:35.310> you<00:02:35.670> are

00:02:35.899 --> 00:02:35.909 
older one so you know if you are

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:37.460 
older one so you know if you are
upgrading<00:02:36.390> can<00:02:36.510> obviously<00:02:36.780> transfer<00:02:37.349> that

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
upgrading can obviously transfer that

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.920 
upgrading can obviously transfer that
over<00:02:37.680> to<00:02:37.890> this<00:02:38.370> device<00:02:38.730> from<00:02:39.599> a<00:02:39.750> weight

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
over to this device from a weight

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:44.149 
over to this device from a weight
perspective<00:02:40.760> I'd<00:02:41.760> say<00:02:42.000> it<00:02:42.269> feels<00:02:43.019> like<00:02:43.319> like

00:02:44.149 --> 00:02:44.159 
perspective I'd say it feels like like

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:47.900 
perspective I'd say it feels like like
the<00:02:44.340> edge<00:02:44.760> charger<00:02:45.720> is<00:02:45.900> lighter<00:02:46.500> but<00:02:47.220> that<00:02:47.760> may

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
the edge charger is lighter but that may

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:48.979 
the edge charger is lighter but that may
have<00:02:48.060> to<00:02:48.150> do<00:02:48.269> with<00:02:48.390> the<00:02:48.450> fact<00:02:48.629> that<00:02:48.690> you<00:02:48.840> don't

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
have to do with the fact that you don't

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:51.949 
have to do with the fact that you don't
have<00:02:49.109> this<00:02:49.260> nice<00:02:49.500> little<00:02:49.879> pleather<00:02:50.959> case

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
have this nice little pleather case

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:54.680 
have this nice little pleather case
holding<00:02:52.739> your<00:02:53.040> device<00:02:53.400> if<00:02:54.150> we<00:02:54.450> were<00:02:54.569> to

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
holding your device if we were to

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:59.569 
holding your device if we were to
compare<00:02:55.079> this<00:02:55.489> device<00:02:56.489> to<00:02:57.480> the<00:02:58.319> actual<00:02:58.739> other

00:02:59.569 --> 00:02:59.579 
compare this device to the actual other

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:01.789 
compare this device to the actual other
leading<00:03:00.329> headset<00:03:01.019> that's<00:03:01.200> on<00:03:01.319> the<00:03:01.440> market

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:01.799 
leading headset that's on the market

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:04.490 
leading headset that's on the market
which<00:03:01.950> is<00:03:02.129> your<00:03:02.400> jawbone<00:03:02.970> era<00:03:03.480> you'll<00:03:04.079> notice

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
which is your jawbone era you'll notice

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.009 
which is your jawbone era you'll notice
that<00:03:04.769> the<00:03:05.670> footprint<00:03:06.150> of<00:03:06.329> the<00:03:06.480> device<00:03:06.750> is

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
that the footprint of the device is

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:10.809 
that the footprint of the device is
significantly<00:03:07.940> larger<00:03:08.940> so<00:03:09.390> here<00:03:10.290> you<00:03:10.440> have

00:03:10.809 --> 00:03:10.819 
significantly larger so here you have

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:14.210 
significantly larger so here you have
the<00:03:11.819> comparison<00:03:12.359> between<00:03:12.450> the<00:03:13.260> Voyager<00:03:14.040> edge

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
the comparison between the Voyager edge

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.640 
the comparison between the Voyager edge
and<00:03:14.640> you<00:03:14.700> notice<00:03:14.970> how<00:03:15.090> long<00:03:15.690> the<00:03:15.930> boom<00:03:16.109> mic<00:03:16.379> is

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
and you notice how long the boom mic is

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.800 
and you notice how long the boom mic is
compared<00:03:17.519> to<00:03:17.549> the<00:03:18.030> actual<00:03:18.799> jawbone<00:03:19.799> it<00:03:20.010> and

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:20.810 
compared to the actual jawbone it and

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:23.240 
compared to the actual jawbone it and
some<00:03:21.810> people<00:03:22.109> will<00:03:22.230> say<00:03:22.410> that<00:03:22.680> especially

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
some people will say that especially

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.819 
some people will say that especially
when<00:03:23.970> it<00:03:24.060> comes<00:03:24.209> to<00:03:24.389> mics<00:03:24.599> that<00:03:24.930> the<00:03:25.410> longer

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:25.829 
when it comes to mics that the longer

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:28.400 
when it comes to mics that the longer
the<00:03:26.069> the<00:03:26.639> the<00:03:27.090> boom<00:03:27.299> mic<00:03:27.599> or<00:03:27.870> the<00:03:28.049> extension

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
the the the boom mic or the extension

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:29.839 
the the the boom mic or the extension
the<00:03:28.709> better<00:03:28.889> it<00:03:29.010> is<00:03:29.099> because<00:03:29.220> it<00:03:29.430> gets<00:03:29.579> closer

00:03:29.839 --> 00:03:29.849 
the better it is because it gets closer

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:31.879 
the better it is because it gets closer
to<00:03:30.000> your<00:03:30.690> mouth<00:03:30.959> and<00:03:31.200> therefore<00:03:31.530> you'll<00:03:31.650> have

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:31.889 
to your mouth and therefore you'll have

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:34.670 
to your mouth and therefore you'll have
better<00:03:32.129> sound<00:03:33.120> quality<00:03:33.239> when<00:03:33.690> you<00:03:33.720> speak<00:03:34.109> it's

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
better sound quality when you speak it's

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.520 
better sound quality when you speak it's
something<00:03:35.010> that<00:03:35.129> we<00:03:35.250> still<00:03:35.459> need<00:03:35.700> to<00:03:35.849> see

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530 
something that we still need to see

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:39.430 
something that we still need to see
Plantronics<00:03:37.530> as<00:03:37.980> you<00:03:38.489> know<00:03:38.579> just<00:03:38.790> in<00:03:39.389> general

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:39.440 
Plantronics as you know just in general

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:42.020 
Plantronics as you know just in general
most<00:03:40.440> of<00:03:40.650> their<00:03:40.769> devices<00:03:41.069> are<00:03:41.430> pretty<00:03:41.790> long

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
most of their devices are pretty long

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:43.879 
most of their devices are pretty long
and<00:03:42.389> if<00:03:42.750> you<00:03:42.780> think<00:03:43.049> about<00:03:43.199> the<00:03:43.319> legend<00:03:43.709> which

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:43.889 
and if you think about the legend which

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:47.119 
and if you think about the legend which
is<00:03:44.010> even<00:03:44.250> longer<00:03:45.199> also<00:03:46.199> is<00:03:46.319> one<00:03:46.680> that<00:03:46.799> extends

00:03:47.119 --> 00:03:47.129 
is even longer also is one that extends

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:49.640 
is even longer also is one that extends
down<00:03:47.340> closer<00:03:47.699> to<00:03:47.849> your<00:03:48.000> mouth<00:03:48.239> but<00:03:48.930> as<00:03:49.319> you<00:03:49.500> see

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
down closer to your mouth but as you see

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.490 
down closer to your mouth but as you see
right<00:03:49.680> there<00:03:49.849> as<00:03:50.849> they<00:03:51.090> compare<00:03:51.569> one<00:03:52.410> is

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
right there as they compare one is

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:53.839 
right there as they compare one is
definitely<00:03:52.859> much<00:03:53.129> larger<00:03:53.160> than<00:03:53.519> the<00:03:53.730> other

00:03:53.839 --> 00:03:53.849 
definitely much larger than the other

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:57.039 
definitely much larger than the other
and<00:03:54.120> from<00:03:54.660> a<00:03:54.780> weight<00:03:54.930> perspective<00:03:55.730> you<00:03:56.730> know

00:03:57.039 --> 00:03:57.049 
and from a weight perspective you know

00:03:57.049 --> 00:04:00.439 
and from a weight perspective you know
really<00:03:58.049> the<00:03:58.590> the<00:03:59.099> Voyager<00:03:59.579> edge<00:03:59.730> is<00:03:59.970> top-heavy

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:00.449 
really the the Voyager edge is top-heavy

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:02.330 
really the the Voyager edge is top-heavy
you<00:04:00.959> know<00:04:01.049> this<00:04:01.290> this<00:04:01.560> area<00:04:01.859> is<00:04:01.919> is<00:04:02.099> much

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
you know this this area is is much

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.610 
you know this this area is is much
heavier<00:04:02.609> but<00:04:03.239> not<00:04:03.359> significantly<00:04:04.169> heavier<00:04:04.410> I

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
heavier but not significantly heavier I

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:05.869 
heavier but not significantly heavier I
don't<00:04:04.829> think<00:04:04.980> it'll<00:04:05.129> be<00:04:05.220> uncomfortable<00:04:05.400> to

00:04:05.869 --> 00:04:05.879 
don't think it'll be uncomfortable to

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:09.140 
don't think it'll be uncomfortable to
wear<00:04:06.120> all<00:04:06.269> day<00:04:06.510> either<00:04:07.609> the<00:04:08.609> battery<00:04:08.970> life

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
wear all day either the battery life

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:10.729 
wear all day either the battery life
though<00:04:09.329> is<00:04:09.540> a<00:04:09.569> significant<00:04:10.379> difference

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 
though is a significant difference

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:13.339 
though is a significant difference
between<00:04:10.849> these<00:04:11.849> two<00:04:12.150> you<00:04:12.480> have<00:04:12.660> four<00:04:12.930> hours<00:04:13.319> of

00:04:13.339 --> 00:04:13.349 
between these two you have four hours of

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:17.300 
between these two you have four hours of
talktime<00:04:13.849> versus<00:04:14.849> six<00:04:15.329> hours<00:04:15.780> of<00:04:16.199> talktime<00:04:16.500> so

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
talktime versus six hours of talktime so

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:20.140 
talktime versus six hours of talktime so
that's<00:04:17.669> a<00:04:17.880> big<00:04:18.090> difference<00:04:18.570> there<00:04:18.810> and<00:04:18.959> the

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:20.150 
that's a big difference there and the

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:22.820 
that's a big difference there and the
the<00:04:21.150> discovery<00:04:21.690> here<00:04:22.169> it<00:04:22.349> doesn't<00:04:22.740> really

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
the discovery here it doesn't really

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:26.180 
the discovery here it doesn't really
have<00:04:23.159> a<00:04:23.190> bad<00:04:23.610> I'd<00:04:24.450> say<00:04:24.780> you<00:04:25.440> know<00:04:25.530> the<00:04:25.800> talktime

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
have a bad I'd say you know the talktime

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:28.640 
have a bad I'd say you know the talktime
is<00:04:26.430> also<00:04:26.940> pretty<00:04:27.150> decent

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.650 
is also pretty decent

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:31.640 
is also pretty decent
and<00:04:29.090> but<00:04:30.090> again<00:04:30.180> it's<00:04:30.419> using<00:04:30.750> some<00:04:31.050> some<00:04:31.319> older

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:31.650 
and but again it's using some some older

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:34.999 
and but again it's using some some older
technology<00:04:32.280> so<00:04:32.490> you<00:04:33.240> know<00:04:33.810> if<00:04:34.199> I<00:04:34.740> had<00:04:34.919> to

00:04:34.999 --> 00:04:35.009 
technology so you know if I had to

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:36.080 
technology so you know if I had to
choose<00:04:35.130> which<00:04:35.310> I<00:04:35.400> was<00:04:35.520> gonna<00:04:35.610> go<00:04:35.789> with<00:04:35.910> I'd

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.090 
choose which I was gonna go with I'd

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:38.029 
choose which I was gonna go with I'd
obviously<00:04:36.270> go<00:04:36.539> with<00:04:36.569> the<00:04:36.750> newest<00:04:36.960> one<00:04:37.169> if<00:04:37.560> we

00:04:38.029 --> 00:04:38.039 
obviously go with the newest one if we

00:04:38.039 --> 00:04:40.640 
obviously go with the newest one if we
look<00:04:38.280> at<00:04:38.460> the<00:04:38.610> cases<00:04:39.120> and<00:04:39.449> again<00:04:39.960> but<00:04:40.470> now<00:04:40.590> we

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:40.650 
look at the cases and again but now we

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:43.279 
look at the cases and again but now we
can<00:04:40.979> pair<00:04:41.220> it<00:04:41.250> to<00:04:41.400> the<00:04:41.759> the<00:04:42.300> one<00:04:42.479> from<00:04:42.720> the

00:04:43.279 --> 00:04:43.289 
can pair it to the the one from the

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:46.219 
can pair it to the the one from the
jawbone<00:04:44.509> here<00:04:45.509> you<00:04:45.599> notice<00:04:45.840> that<00:04:45.930> the<00:04:46.020> case

00:04:46.219 --> 00:04:46.229 
jawbone here you notice that the case

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:50.240 
jawbone here you notice that the case
it's<00:04:47.130> a<00:04:47.220> lot<00:04:47.370> smaller<00:04:47.940> it's<00:04:48.840> kind<00:04:49.199> of<00:04:49.289> very

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:50.250 
it's a lot smaller it's kind of very

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:52.640 
it's a lot smaller it's kind of very
much<00:04:50.370> in<00:04:50.610> tune<00:04:50.759> with<00:04:51.000> the<00:04:51.150> actual<00:04:51.539> jawbone<00:04:52.410> era

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:52.650 
much in tune with the actual jawbone era

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:55.339 
much in tune with the actual jawbone era
which<00:04:53.039> is<00:04:53.220> small<00:04:53.639> and<00:04:53.940> it<00:04:54.840> has<00:04:54.870> this<00:04:55.229> little

00:04:55.339 --> 00:04:55.349 
which is small and it has this little

00:04:55.349 --> 00:04:57.379 
which is small and it has this little
kickstand<00:04:55.800> that<00:04:55.949> comes<00:04:56.130> up<00:04:56.340> which<00:04:56.940> you<00:04:57.150> plug

00:04:57.379 --> 00:04:57.389 
kickstand that comes up which you plug

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:00.950 
kickstand that comes up which you plug
into<00:04:57.630> your<00:04:58.440> micro<00:04:58.770> USB<00:04:59.300> unlikely<00:05:00.300> this<00:05:00.720> one

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960 
into your micro USB unlikely this one

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:02.089 
into your micro USB unlikely this one
right<00:05:01.080> here<00:05:01.380> which<00:05:01.530> is<00:05:01.650> that<00:05:01.800> has<00:05:01.949> that

00:05:02.089 --> 00:05:02.099 
right here which is that has that

00:05:02.099 --> 00:05:04.310 
right here which is that has that
magnetic<00:05:02.639> enclosure<00:05:02.789> you<00:05:03.599> only<00:05:03.750> have<00:05:03.990> one

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:04.320 
magnetic enclosure you only have one

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:07.370 
magnetic enclosure you only have one
line<00:05:04.530> of<00:05:04.710> feedback<00:05:05.190> on<00:05:05.460> this<00:05:05.880> this<00:05:06.570> one<00:05:06.780> it

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:07.380 
line of feedback on this this one it

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:09.290 
line of feedback on this this one it
will<00:05:07.500> only<00:05:07.620> tell<00:05:07.949> you<00:05:08.220> how<00:05:08.759> much<00:05:08.910> battery

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.300 
will only tell you how much battery

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:11.029 
will only tell you how much battery
level<00:05:09.630> you<00:05:09.720> have<00:05:09.960> it<00:05:10.380> doesn't<00:05:10.620> give<00:05:10.830> you<00:05:11.009> the

00:05:11.029 --> 00:05:11.039 
level you have it doesn't give you the

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:13.490 
level you have it doesn't give you the
indicator<00:05:11.970> for<00:05:12.210> the<00:05:12.270> headset<00:05:12.720> unlike<00:05:13.320> this

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:13.500 
indicator for the headset unlike this

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:15.050 
indicator for the headset unlike this
one<00:05:13.710> where<00:05:13.830> you<00:05:13.919> have<00:05:14.099> both<00:05:14.340> the<00:05:14.580> docking

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:15.060 
one where you have both the docking

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:16.969 
one where you have both the docking
station<00:05:15.090> and<00:05:15.690> the<00:05:15.990> headset<00:05:16.620> battery

00:05:16.969 --> 00:05:16.979 
station and the headset battery

00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:19.070 
station and the headset battery
indicator<00:05:17.430> so<00:05:17.910> this<00:05:18.240> device<00:05:18.660> while<00:05:18.900> it's

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:19.080 
indicator so this device while it's

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:21.490 
indicator so this device while it's
larger<00:05:19.650> does<00:05:20.280> give<00:05:20.520> you<00:05:20.729> more<00:05:21.030> information

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:21.500 
larger does give you more information

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:23.629 
larger does give you more information
but<00:05:22.500> if<00:05:22.590> you<00:05:22.710> were<00:05:22.800> to<00:05:22.919> say<00:05:23.250> you<00:05:23.310> know<00:05:23.520> how

00:05:23.629 --> 00:05:23.639 
but if you were to say you know how

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:26.510 
but if you were to say you know how
pocketable<00:05:24.180> these<00:05:24.630> things<00:05:24.870> are<00:05:25.050> yeah<00:05:25.860> I<00:05:25.919> put

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:26.520 
pocketable these things are yeah I put

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:28.700 
pocketable these things are yeah I put
the<00:05:26.639> jawbone<00:05:27.000> era<00:05:27.270> in<00:05:27.449> my<00:05:27.599> pocket<00:05:27.990> with<00:05:28.470> no

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:28.710 
the jawbone era in my pocket with no

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:31.189 
the jawbone era in my pocket with no
problem<00:05:29.099> whatsoever<00:05:29.599> this<00:05:30.599> would<00:05:30.810> be<00:05:30.960> kind<00:05:31.139> of

00:05:31.189 --> 00:05:31.199 
problem whatsoever this would be kind of

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:32.749 
problem whatsoever this would be kind of
bulky<00:05:31.560> this<00:05:31.860> is<00:05:32.039> kind<00:05:32.220> of<00:05:32.250> something<00:05:32.550> you<00:05:32.639> put

00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:32.759 
bulky this is kind of something you put

00:05:32.759 --> 00:05:35.020 
bulky this is kind of something you put
in<00:05:32.820> your<00:05:33.000> backpack<00:05:33.449> and<00:05:33.479> or<00:05:33.960> in<00:05:34.169> the<00:05:34.320> briefcase

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:35.030 
in your backpack and or in the briefcase

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:38.420 
in your backpack and or in the briefcase
even<00:05:36.030> in<00:05:36.120> the<00:05:36.210> suit<00:05:36.389> pocket<00:05:36.630> it's<00:05:37.320> you<00:05:38.190> know<00:05:38.310> it

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:38.430 
even in the suit pocket it's you know it

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:40.670 
even in the suit pocket it's you know it
has<00:05:38.970> a<00:05:39.000> bulge<00:05:39.330> to<00:05:39.659> it<00:05:39.780> so<00:05:39.960> I<00:05:40.139> don't<00:05:40.470> know<00:05:40.560> how

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:40.680 
has a bulge to it so I don't know how

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:43.339 
has a bulge to it so I don't know how
functional<00:05:41.220> that<00:05:41.310> is<00:05:41.370> but<00:05:42.120> you<00:05:42.539> know<00:05:42.659> as<00:05:43.229> we

00:05:43.339 --> 00:05:43.349 
functional that is but you know as we

00:05:43.349 --> 00:05:45.499 
functional that is but you know as we
look<00:05:43.380> at<00:05:43.620> these<00:05:43.740> two<00:05:43.800> headsets<00:05:44.729> the<00:05:45.330> big

00:05:45.499 --> 00:05:45.509 
look at these two headsets the big

00:05:45.509 --> 00:05:47.800 
look at these two headsets the big
difference<00:05:45.930> though<00:05:46.169> is<00:05:46.349> the<00:05:46.650> fact<00:05:46.830> that<00:05:47.009> I<00:05:47.370> get

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:47.810 
difference though is the fact that I get

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:52.129 
difference though is the fact that I get
only<00:05:48.810> four<00:05:49.080> hours<00:05:49.229> of<00:05:49.560> talktime<00:05:50.090> versus<00:05:51.139> six

00:05:52.129 --> 00:05:52.139 
only four hours of talktime versus six

00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:53.779 
only four hours of talktime versus six
hours<00:05:52.380> of<00:05:52.500> talktime<00:05:52.710> so<00:05:53.280> I'm<00:05:53.370> getting<00:05:53.550> two

00:05:53.779 --> 00:05:53.789 
hours of talktime so I'm getting two

00:05:53.789 --> 00:05:55.610 
hours of talktime so I'm getting two
additional<00:05:54.180> hours<00:05:54.479> so<00:05:54.630> I<00:05:54.659> may<00:05:54.900> never<00:05:55.169> need<00:05:55.440> the

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:55.620 
additional hours so I may never need the

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:58.219 
additional hours so I may never need the
charger<00:05:56.130> as<00:05:56.820> I'm<00:05:57.180> walking<00:05:57.599> around<00:05:57.719> and<00:05:58.020> I<00:05:58.080> can

00:05:58.219 --> 00:05:58.229 
charger as I'm walking around and I can

00:05:58.229 --> 00:06:00.560 
charger as I'm walking around and I can
leave<00:05:58.380> it<00:05:58.469> in<00:05:58.560> a<00:05:58.650> briefcase<00:05:58.860> or<00:05:59.250> whatnot<00:05:59.520> so<00:06:00.180> so

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:00.570 
leave it in a briefcase or whatnot so so

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:02.330 
leave it in a briefcase or whatnot so so
this<00:06:00.690> was<00:06:00.840> a<00:06:00.870> more<00:06:01.139> of<00:06:01.229> an<00:06:01.349> in-depth<00:06:01.710> review<00:06:02.130> of
