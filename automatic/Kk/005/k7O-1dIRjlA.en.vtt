00:01:40.699 --> 00:01:40.709 
itself so that's a huge plus up and in

00:01:40.709 --> 00:01:42.889 
itself so that's a huge plus up and in

fact with Netflix bringing support for
html5<00:01:43.469> based<00:01:44.240> video<00:01:45.240> it's<00:01:46.020> quite<00:01:46.319> possible

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
html5 based video it's quite possible

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.609 
html5 based video it's quite possible
that<00:01:46.920> even<00:01:47.159> if<00:01:47.429> there<00:01:47.700> is<00:01:47.849> no<00:01:48.029> Netflix<00:01:48.539> app<00:01:48.779> you
