00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.260 
with the firing pin where there's a
delay<00:01:51.720> between<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.670> cling<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:53.759> trigger<00:01:54.030> and

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
delay between the cling the trigger and

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.690 
delay between the cling the trigger and
the<00:01:54.329> action<00:01:54.810> actually<00:01:55.259> happening<00:01:56.040> on<00:01:56.219> screen

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
the action actually happening on screen

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.830 
the action actually happening on screen
so<00:01:57.450> if<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:58.259> SW<00:01:58.740> 40<00:01:59.130> looks<00:02:00.030> it<00:02:00.240> leads<00:02:00.450> to<00:02:00.689> me

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
so if the SW 40 looks it leads to me

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.810 
so if the SW 40 looks it leads to me
from<00:02:01.409> the<00:02:01.560> videos<00:02:01.829> I've<00:02:01.979> seen<00:02:02.250> in<00:02:02.399> the<00:02:02.490> reviews

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
of word from other youtubers to be a bit

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.069 
of word from other youtubers to be a bit
better<00:02:04.920> or<00:02:05.189> maybe<00:02:05.340> a<00:02:05.430> lot<00:02:05.759> more<00:02:06.450> better<00:02:06.750> in

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
better or maybe a lot more better in

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:10.330 
better or maybe a lot more better in
terms<00:02:07.259> of<00:02:07.409> stability<00:02:07.619> in<00:02:08.610> terms<00:02:08.910> of<00:02:09.060> firing<00:02:09.599> of

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
terms of stability in terms of firing of

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:11.680 
terms of stability in terms of firing of
when<00:02:10.489> you<00:02:10.580> pull<00:02:10.759> the<00:02:10.789> trigger<00:02:11.120> and<00:02:11.239> the<00:02:11.420> fire

mechana<00:02:12.379> not<00:02:12.620> be<00:02:12.890> happened<00:02:13.250> so<00:02:13.879> that<00:02:14.360> seems<00:02:14.870> to

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
mechana not be happened so that seems to

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.780 
mechana not be happened so that seems to
be<00:02:15.200> one<00:02:15.470> of<00:02:15.500> the<00:02:15.709> really<00:02:15.890> good<00:02:16.250> news<00:02:16.310> that

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
be one of the really good news that

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.660 
be one of the really good news that
we've<00:02:17.540> seen<00:02:17.900> with<00:02:18.110> the<00:02:18.200> far<00:02:18.440> with<00:02:18.830> a<00:02:19.250> pistol

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
we've seen with the far with a pistol

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:21.820 
we've seen with the far with a pistol
now<00:02:19.849> so<00:02:20.300> if<00:02:20.360> you<00:02:20.450> get<00:02:20.569> a<00:02:20.629> 60<00:02:20.989> 60<00:02:21.500> damage

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
now so if you get a 60 60 damage

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:24.910 
now so if you get a 60 60 damage
up-close<00:02:22.310> pistol<00:02:22.790> with<00:02:23.660> a<00:02:23.870> stable<00:02:24.319> mechanics

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
up-close pistol with a stable mechanics

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.830 
up-close pistol with a stable mechanics
I<00:02:25.010> think<00:02:25.340> many<00:02:25.760> people<00:02:26.150> on<00:02:26.239> the<00:02:26.360> battlefield

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
I think many people on the battlefield

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.089 
I think many people on the battlefield
are<00:02:26.989> going<00:02:27.379> to<00:02:27.500> use<00:02:27.680> it<00:02:27.920> which<00:02:28.549> is<00:02:28.790> to<00:02:29.299> say<00:02:29.330> that

00:02:30.089 --> 00:02:30.099 
are going to use it which is to say that

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:32.619 
are going to use it which is to say that
you're<00:02:31.099> going<00:02:31.250> to<00:02:31.340> say<00:02:31.430> that<00:02:31.580> result<00:02:32.269> like<00:02:32.450> the

00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:32.629 
you're going to say that result like the

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:37.479 
you're going to say that result like the
compact<00:02:33.110> 45<00:02:33.410> or<00:02:33.860> the<00:02:34.360> FN<00:02:35.360> 57<00:02:35.510> over<00:02:36.440> the<00:02:36.560> m1911

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:37.489 
compact 45 or the FN 57 over the m1911

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:42.370 
compact 45 or the FN 57 over the m1911
oh<00:02:38.590> good<00:02:39.590> see<00:02:39.890> a<00:02:40.099> reduction<00:02:40.340> in<00:02:40.730> usage<00:02:41.380> moving

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
oh good see a reduction in usage moving

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:44.770 
oh good see a reduction in usage moving
on<00:02:42.530> just<00:02:43.130> another<00:02:43.489> weapon<00:02:43.730> just<00:02:44.540> 1<00:02:44.690> i'm

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
on just another weapon just 1 i'm

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.229 
on just another weapon just 1 i'm
particularly<00:02:45.110> interested<00:02:45.349> in<00:02:46.099> because<00:02:46.610> i<00:02:46.640> was

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:47.239 
particularly interested in because i was

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:49.990 
particularly interested in because i was
a<00:02:47.269> big<00:02:47.540> fan<00:02:47.569> of<00:02:47.810> the<00:02:48.019> m27<00:02:48.709> iar<00:02:49.310> in<00:02:49.489> battlefield

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
a big fan of the m27 iar in battlefield

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.100 
a big fan of the m27 iar in battlefield
3<00:02:50.410> something<00:02:51.410> similar<00:02:51.799> or<00:02:52.180> with<00:02:53.180> the<00:02:53.269> AWS<00:02:53.930> is

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
3 something similar or with the AWS is

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.000 
3 something similar or with the AWS is
coming<00:02:54.440> out<00:02:54.560> with<00:02:54.680> 100-round<00:02:55.250> drum<00:02:55.970> magazine

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
coming out with 100-round drum magazine

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.680 
coming out with 100-round drum magazine
which<00:02:58.010> is<00:02:58.190> 800<00:02:58.970> rounds<00:02:59.060> per<00:02:59.269> minute<00:02:59.390> now

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
before the Arthur T update it was

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.850 
before the Arthur T update it was
basically<00:03:02.989> an<00:03:03.530> assault<00:03:03.860> rifle<00:03:04.450> with<00:03:05.450> a<00:03:05.860> really

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
basically an assault rifle with a really

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:08.949 
basically an assault rifle with a really
high<00:03:07.010> fire<00:03:07.340> rate<00:03:07.519> and<00:03:07.730> almost<00:03:08.569> negligible

high fire rate and almost negligible

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:11.860 
high fire rate and almost negligible
recalls<00:03:09.650> you<00:03:09.829> could<00:03:10.010> basically<00:03:10.599> shoot<00:03:11.599> down

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
recalls you could basically shoot down

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.250 
recalls you could basically shoot down

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
horizontal vertical spread and you could

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.620 
horizontal vertical spread and you could
sustain<00:03:19.040> that<00:03:19.459> fire<00:03:19.730> for<00:03:20.120> an<00:03:20.209> indefinite

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:20.630 
sustain that fire for an indefinite

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:22.270 
sustain that fire for an indefinite
amount<00:03:20.959> of<00:03:21.200> time<00:03:21.260> if<00:03:21.650> you<00:03:21.680> had<00:03:21.799> an<00:03:21.920> ammo<00:03:22.069> crate

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
amount of time if you had an ammo crate

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.849 
amount of time if you had an ammo crate
next<00:03:22.579> to<00:03:22.639> you<00:03:22.730> but<00:03:23.600> now<00:03:23.780> with<00:03:24.079> the<00:03:24.109> art<00:03:24.380> 30<00:03:24.590> dev

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:24.859 
next to you but now with the art 30 dev

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:26.259 
next to you but now with the art 30 dev
increase<00:03:25.190> the<00:03:25.340> side<00:03:25.519> to<00:03:25.670> side<00:03:25.790> we<00:03:26.030> caused

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:26.269 
increase the side to side we caused

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:29.470 
increase the side to side we caused
quite<00:03:26.660> a<00:03:26.750> bit<00:03:27.019> so<00:03:27.799> now<00:03:28.160> it<00:03:28.579> functions<00:03:29.269> more

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
quite a bit so now it functions more

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.780 
quite a bit so now it functions more
like<00:03:29.660> a<00:03:29.690> machine<00:03:29.959> gun<00:03:30.139> which<00:03:30.950> is<00:03:31.099> good<00:03:31.370> now

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
like a machine gun which is good now

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:34.030 
like a machine gun which is good now
people<00:03:32.060> in<00:03:32.299> pcu<00:03:32.690> only<00:03:33.109> exploited<00:03:33.650> this<00:03:33.799> and

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:37.650 
normally wouldn't do now the first one

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:39.760 
normally wouldn't do now the first one
was<00:04:37.800> the<00:04:38.220> Phantom<00:04:38.760> program<00:04:39.180> of<00:04:39.300> the<00:04:39.360> Phantom

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:39.770 
was the Phantom program of the Phantom

the Phantom prospect if i'm not mistaken

the Phantom prospect if i'm not mistaken
and<00:04:43.610> that<00:04:44.610> one<00:04:44.850> was<00:04:45.300> the<00:04:45.780> password<00:04:45.990> for<00:04:46.380> that<00:04:46.410> I

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:46.530 
and that one was the password for that I

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:48.050

think<00:04:46.680> you<00:04:46.830> have<00:04:46.950> to<00:04:46.980> click<00:04:47.340> a<00:04:47.370> small<00:04:47.640> skull<00:04:47.940> on

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:48.060 
think you have to click a small skull on

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:50.630 
think you have to click a small skull on
the<00:04:48.090> leaderboards<00:04:49.020> or<00:04:49.230> the<00:04:49.560> Geo<00:04:49.770> boards<00:04:50.130> on

the leaderboards or the Geo boards on
the<00:04:50.700> site<00:04:50.940> and<00:04:51.150> then<00:04:51.600> you<00:04:51.780> had<00:04:52.169> something<00:04:53.040> like

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340 
the site and then you had something like

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.040 
the site and then you had something like
a<00:04:53.370> terminal<00:04:54.000> would<00:04:54.150> open<00:04:54.450> and<00:04:54.630> then<00:04:54.810> you<00:04:54.900> have

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.050 
a terminal would open and then you have

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:57.020 
a terminal would open and then you have
to<00:04:55.140> enter<00:04:55.260> bump<00:04:55.890> in<00:04:56.130> the<00:04:56.160> night<00:04:56.280> which<00:04:56.730> was<00:04:56.760> on

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:57.030 
to enter bump in the night which was on

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:00.140 
to enter bump in the night which was on
the<00:04:57.510> China<00:04:57.720> rising<00:04:57.960> map<00:04:58.290> so<00:04:59.130> jackfrags<00:04:59.820> was

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.150 
the China rising map so jackfrags was

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:02.810 
the China rising map so jackfrags was
kind<00:05:00.390> enough<00:05:00.450> to<00:05:00.810> find<00:05:01.740> out<00:05:01.890> find<00:05:02.340> that<00:05:02.640> out

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:02.820 
kind enough to find out find that out

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:05.090 
kind enough to find out find that out
for<00:05:03.120> us<00:05:03.180> and<00:05:03.570> we<00:05:04.169> use<00:05:04.320> that<00:05:04.560> and<00:05:04.770> then<00:05:04.860> we<00:05:05.010> had

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:05.100 
for us and we use that and then we had

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:07.850 
for us and we use that and then we had
to<00:05:05.130> perform<00:05:05.460> a<00:05:05.790> set<00:05:05.970> of<00:05:06.060> skills<00:05:06.300> to<00:05:06.570> unlock<00:05:06.990> the

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:07.860 
to perform a set of skills to unlock the

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:11.900 
to perform a set of skills to unlock the
dog<00:05:08.040> tags<00:05:08.370> now<00:05:08.970> this<00:05:09.210> time<00:05:09.510> the<00:05:10.140> map<00:05:10.910> it's

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:11.910 
dog tags now this time the map it's

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:13.550 
dog tags now this time the map it's
going<00:05:12.120> to<00:05:12.150> be<00:05:12.240> on<00:05:12.360> a<00:05:12.390> naval<00:05:12.600> strike<00:05:12.870> map<00:05:13.169> and<00:05:13.440> we

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:13.560 
going to be on a naval strike map and we

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:14.719 
going to be on a naval strike map and we
haven't<00:05:13.800> found<00:05:13.890> the<00:05:14.040> password<00:05:14.340> yet<00:05:14.490> because

00:05:14.719 --> 00:05:14.729 
haven't found the password yet because

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:16.070 
haven't found the password yet because
neighborhood<00:05:15.000> strike<00:05:15.150> isn't<00:05:15.419> out<00:05:15.570> yet<00:05:15.600> so

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:16.080 
neighborhood strike isn't out yet so

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.409 
neighborhood strike isn't out yet so
hopefully<00:05:16.979> you'll<00:05:17.400> find<00:05:17.640> it<00:05:17.850> and<00:05:18.000> this<00:05:18.210> time

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:18.419 
hopefully you'll find it and this time

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:21.469 
hopefully you'll find it and this time
my<00:05:19.169> guess<00:05:19.440> is<00:05:19.470> that<00:05:19.860> we<00:05:20.370> could<00:05:20.640> probably<00:05:21.000> see

00:05:21.469 --> 00:05:21.479 
my guess is that we could probably see

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:24.440 
my guess is that we could probably see
the<00:05:22.220> phantom<00:05:23.220> skin<00:05:23.460> of<00:05:23.580> the<00:05:23.640> snakeskin<00:05:24.030> camo

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:24.450 
the phantom skin of the snakeskin camo

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:26.390 
the phantom skin of the snakeskin camo
that<00:05:24.750> we<00:05:24.870> have<00:05:25.050> I'm<00:05:25.470> hoping<00:05:25.800> that's<00:05:25.950> to<00:05:26.160> think

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:26.400 
that we have I'm hoping that's to think

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.640 
that we have I'm hoping that's to think
the<00:05:27.120> last<00:05:27.479> going<00:05:27.810> to<00:05:27.900> talk<00:05:28.050> about<00:05:28.200> probably

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:28.650 
the last going to talk about probably

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:30.200 
the last going to talk about probably
the<00:05:28.710> most<00:05:28.860> important<00:05:29.310> one<00:05:29.340> with<00:05:29.640> what<00:05:29.850> time<00:05:30.060> do

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:30.210 
the most important one with what time do

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:32.540 
the most important one with what time do
they<00:05:30.330> will<00:05:30.479> try<00:05:30.630> come<00:05:30.840> out<00:05:30.990> like<00:05:31.620> I<00:05:31.950> live<00:05:32.430> in

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:32.550 
they will try come out like I live in
