sounds so pretty good for its a 20 bucks
price<00:00:26.449> a<00:00:27.449> little<00:00:28.320> bit<00:00:28.590> about<00:00:28.800> the

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
price a little bit about the

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.350 
price a little bit about the
specifications<00:00:30.920> the<00:00:31.920> type<00:00:32.219> is<00:00:32.489> cardio<00:00:33.180> it

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
specifications the type is cardio it

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.500 
specifications the type is cardio it
dynamic<00:00:34.350> any<00:00:34.829> directional<00:00:35.600> the<00:00:36.600> impedance<00:00:37.350> is

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:38.510 
dynamic any directional the impedance is

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:43.639 
dynamic any directional the impedance is
250<00:00:39.510> ohms<00:00:39.920> the<00:00:40.920> sensitivity<00:00:41.760> is<00:00:42.170> minus<00:00:43.170> 70

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
250 ohms the sensitivity is minus 70

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.290 
250 ohms the sensitivity is minus 70
decibels<00:00:44.660> the<00:00:45.660> bandwidth<00:00:46.200> is<00:00:46.500> from<00:00:47.340> 50<00:00:48.030> Hertz

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
decibels the bandwidth is from 50 Hertz

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.160 
decibels the bandwidth is from 50 Hertz
to<00:00:48.980> 15<00:00:49.980> Q<00:00:50.489> Hertz<00:00:50.820> which<00:00:51.360> is<00:00:51.539> pretty<00:00:51.899> good<00:00:52.110> for

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
to 15 Q Hertz which is pretty good for

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.279 
to 15 Q Hertz which is pretty good for
dynamic<00:00:52.890> microphone<00:00:53.449> and<00:00:54.449> it<00:00:54.750> weight<00:00:55.410> is<00:00:55.590> only

00:00:57.279 --> 00:00:57.289 
dynamic microphone and it weight is only

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:00.470 
dynamic microphone and it weight is only
240<00:00:58.289> grams<00:00:58.530> so<00:00:58.920> it's<00:00:59.100> a<00:00:59.340> pretty<00:01:00.120> light

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
240 grams so it's a pretty light

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.840 
240 grams so it's a pretty light
microphone<00:01:01.969> the<00:01:02.969> connector<00:01:03.449> is<00:01:03.830> XLR

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:04.850 
microphone the connector is XLR

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.530 
microphone the connector is XLR

else it's a hook to my sound card which
is<00:01:25.560> so<00:01:25.950> a<00:01:26.189> module<00:01:27.060> FastTrack

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
is so a module FastTrack

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:34.749 
is so a module FastTrack
mk2<00:01:30.950> here<00:01:31.950> it<00:01:32.159> is<00:01:32.360> the<00:01:33.360> fast-track<00:01:33.840> mk2<00:01:34.380> I'm

00:01:34.749 --> 00:01:34.759 
mk2 here it is the fast-track mk2 I'm

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:39.499 
mk2 here it is the fast-track mk2 I'm
very<00:01:35.759> glad<00:01:35.970> of<00:01:36.060> it<00:01:36.500> it's<00:01:37.500> still<00:01:38.509> working
