you're not new to the game there's some
really<00:00:19.410> difficult<00:00:19.680> techniques<00:00:20.340> as<00:00:20.520> you<00:00:20.640> go<00:00:20.760> on

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
really difficult techniques as you go on

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.390 
really difficult techniques as you go on
that<00:00:21.600> are<00:00:21.990> hard<00:00:22.320> so<00:00:22.560> for<00:00:22.710> instance<00:00:22.769> this<00:00:23.160> one's

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
that are hard so for instance this one's

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.490 
that are hard so for instance this one's
beginning<00:00:23.789> easy<00:00:24.119> jump.heavy-kick<00:00:24.900> you<00:00:25.350> see

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
beginning easy jump.heavy-kick you see

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.099 
beginning easy jump.heavy-kick you see
the<00:00:25.590> success<00:00:25.740> very<00:00:26.730> easy<00:00:26.939> heavy<00:00:27.599> punch<00:00:27.840> so<00:00:28.019> it

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
the success very easy heavy punch so it

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.550 
the success very easy heavy punch so it
really<00:00:28.260> starts<00:00:28.619> at<00:00:28.859> a<00:00:28.890> very<00:00:29.310> basic<00:00:29.640> level<00:00:30.560> and

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
really starts at a very basic level and

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.830 
really starts at a very basic level and
can<00:00:32.040> run<00:00:32.160> through<00:00:32.369> quickly<00:00:32.579> so<00:00:33.420> for<00:00:33.780> instance

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
can run through quickly so for instance

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.799 
can run through quickly so for instance
if<00:00:34.200> I<00:00:34.290> do<00:00:34.730> so<00:00:35.730> it<00:00:36.059> asked<00:00:36.239> me<00:00:36.300> to<00:00:36.390> do<00:00:36.450> some<00:00:36.570> self

if I do so it asked me to do some self

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.119 
if I do so it asked me to do some self
throw<00:00:36.989> if<00:00:37.079> I<00:00:37.140> go<00:00:37.290> for<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.469> same<00:00:37.680> car<00:00:37.860> I<00:00:37.920> did

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
throw if I go for the same car I did

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.160 
throw if I go for the same car I did
that's<00:00:38.610> not<00:00:38.820> right<00:00:38.850> so<00:00:39.329> you<00:00:39.719> got<00:00:39.840> to<00:00:39.930> do<00:00:40.020> this

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
that's not right so you got to do this

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.850
