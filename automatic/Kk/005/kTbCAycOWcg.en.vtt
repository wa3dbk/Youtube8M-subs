00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 hey here is norms I want 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.150
 to introduce you to a recipe 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:12.049
 it is very delicious custard 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:14.880
 and completely without sugar without fat 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:17.010
 that's all we need to get one 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.920
 custard completely without sugar and 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:25.800
 without a box to make a big head 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:29.400
 iceberg lettuce spelled buckwheat that 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:33.630
 is such a two days then appended 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:37.200
 a little something else and some vanilla 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:39.899
 powder and not to forget us 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:46.050
 need a high performance mixa like that 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:48.570
 vita mix because we need the stop so 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.510
 First we cut the 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:54.809
 Iceberg lettuce into smaller pieces with it 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:58.440
 they fit into vita mix as well as 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:11.150
 Next we give the buckwheat in the 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:17.640
 Vita mix some stevia depending on the taste 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:22.530
 Add the sweet marks to media and 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:25.170
 a little vanilla powder is enough 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:28.369
 a small amount around the strong vanilla 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.369
 taste trigger 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:36.150
 sony gets mixed up and done 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:39.210
 is the custard i have now 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:41.880
 something with Erdmann then the whole 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:46.590
 so decorated are not really any 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:49.110
 Lust and now I'm still trying 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:54.790
 I found it very delicious who likes it sweeter 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:56.710
 should season with stevia pulfer 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:02:00.850
 but I would not be too much right away 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:01.920
 vanilla powder or walk the beginning 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.960
 in need 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.910
 later we can still stevia 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:10.170
 powder or vanilla inspector towards 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:10.170
 mix and stir well
