 hi everyone, here we are with a new video 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.250
 this video will be a new video in 

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:24.590
 lc collaboration with laboratories 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.750
 Italian cosmetics as today 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:29.270
 we're going to see how to remove it 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:31.330
 semi-permanent polish this time with 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:34.489
 an innovative product 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:36.830
 the product in question is this one 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:39.170
 suite pro remove the clean air 

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:41.510
 this product is from adele c is a 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:44.840
 produced two in one or two 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:47.390
 functions in a single product ie 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.670
 remover and clean air this product 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.350
 in fact it will act as a remover when 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.690
 we would like to remove the enamel 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:56.300
 semi-permanent and as a cleaner when 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:59.030
 we will need to degrease on the side 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:02.360
 radiant of the semi-permanent enamel 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:06.590
 after channeling this product a 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:08.450
 100 ml inside has the characteristic 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.799
 to be perfumed with almonds 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:16.220
 in fact it will not be the usual product 

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:18.979
 annoying that will weigh the place where 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:22.939
 you are working but will leave a pleasant one 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:24.770
 almond perfume and therefore nothing 

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:26.479
 we will go on foot how to use this 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:29.030
 product I hope the video can 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:31.840
 pleasure and see you next time 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.840
 Hi everyone 

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:38.140
 then as always for the phase of 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:42.950
 removal would need a file 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:45.289
 to be able to opacify we say for 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:50.719
 remove polish from the enamel 

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:53.329
 semi-permanent a cotton pad from 

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:58.130
 me k i cut it in two for per 

00:01:53.329 --> 00:02:00.469
 save with aluminum foil 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.820
 to be able to do the package for 

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:06.710
 remove the 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:08.149
 the semi-permanent polish is one I pushed 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:10.250
 of those to be able to remove excess 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:12.890
 of semi-permanent polish once it 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:15.350
 it will be loose thanks to the product 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:20.959
 obviously your tweet for 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:25.340
 remove cleaner then if you want to 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:28.490
 end of removal you can a 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:33.380
 pushing the quotidien massage them with 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:38.230
 a healing oil now we go he said 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:42.080
 start our dulling emotion 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:46.120
 the final layer of the enamel 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.120
 semipermanent then removing gloss 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.810
 so now that we have rice pay 

00:02:54.659 --> 00:03:00.269
 the whole surface where it is present 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.700
 semi-permanent polish we can proceed 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:05.900
 with packaging or take 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:12.780
 our thing half cotton pad 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:15.060
 and our fluid pro we are going to pour 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:19.500
 a bit of product 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:25.190
 I will decide I prefer to do 2 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:25.190
 let's say two drops and let's go then 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:32.520
 support so much 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:41.270
 in short, they would be in contact with the 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:44.930
 cotton pad with nail and then 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:48.860
 with tinfoil 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:48.860
 let's go for this package 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:13.329
 let's proceed with all the nails 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:16.940
 I'm doing operations are up 

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:21.049
 inches to show you how it will work 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:25.160
 the fluid, however, nothing remains now 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:28.060
 so for 10 15 minutes and then we'll go to 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:28.060
 remove the package 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:37.440
 ok girls now we have anyway 

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:41.070
 left acting fried pro for 15 minutes 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:44.070
 who did we will be in ten minutes 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:46.530
 let's remove the foil and how 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:49.980
 see to enamel 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:51.240
 if all shriveled then you are yes 

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:55.170
 melted 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:58.080
 then we go to take the flights 

00:04:55.170 --> 00:05:01.800
 vole probably in metal so it is 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:06.960
 much much more effective and let's go 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:10.610
 gently scrape off the nail polish 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:10.610
 semi-permanent that has dissolved 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:48.919
 to do well later as a detail where 

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:51.680
 They remained small joys here 

00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:55.129
 as you can see the fruit pro works 

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:58.639
 very good in removing the enamel 

00:05:55.129 --> 00:06:01.550
 semi-permanent if it remained anyway 

00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:04.610
 a bit of as always with all the rumors is 

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:07.099
 a little glaze attacked by long e 

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:10.129
 just go to the beach with one always 

00:06:07.099 --> 00:06:12.759
 filed the grappa is not very subdued 

00:06:10.129 --> 00:06:12.759
 very 

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:28.390
 let's say abrasive so it will be useful to use 

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:32.160
 a hundred 180 file and here it is after that 

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:34.780
 I filed shortened the nail a little 

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:37.090
 because the other day unfortunately alas me 

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:38.200
 he broke this he caught this 

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:41.350
 angle 

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:43.930
 now we can proceed with the 

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:46.620
 clean air function or to go to 

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:49.690
 clean the nail surface well 

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:53.530
 we were always using fried prof 

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:57.130
 in its cleaner function then I go to 

00:06:53.530 --> 00:07:02.070
 clean the nail well all dust and 

00:06:57.130 --> 00:07:02.070
 they are created with filings
