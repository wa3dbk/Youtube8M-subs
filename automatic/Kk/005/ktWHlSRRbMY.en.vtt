something<00:01:56.820> bad<00:01:57.090> happens<00:01:57.450> or<00:01:57.600> we're<00:01:57.750> having<00:01:57.840> a

which<00:01:59.850> is<00:01:59.969> why<00:02:00.119> I<00:02:00.149> created<00:02:00.329> a<00:02:00.659> new<00:02:00.689> campaign

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
which is why I created a new campaign

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.660 
which is why I created a new campaign
that<00:02:01.380> is<00:02:01.469> even<00:02:01.680> more<00:02:01.860> straightforward<00:02:02.159> and

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
that is even more straightforward and

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.100 
that is even more straightforward and

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
hopefully a little less forgettable they

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.850 
hopefully a little less forgettable they
treat<00:02:04.380> people<00:02:04.530> like<00:02:04.710> they're<00:02:04.950> dying<00:02:05.130> can<00:02:05.490> be

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:08.820 
no it might sound a little negative but
it's<00:02:07.420> the<00:02:07.540> complete<00:02:07.870> opposite<00:02:08.289> if<00:02:08.410> everybody

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
it's the complete opposite if everybody

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:10.290 
it's the complete opposite if everybody
treated<00:02:09.190> each<00:02:09.340> other<00:02:09.460> as<00:02:09.700> if<00:02:09.850> they<00:02:09.940> were<00:02:10.000> dying

reality<00:02:54.040> we're<00:02:54.459> all<00:02:54.640> dying<00:02:54.910> right<00:02:55.239> now

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
reality we're all dying right now

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:56.970 
reality we're all dying right now
because<00:02:55.660> none<00:02:55.959> of<00:02:55.989> us<00:02:56.140> live<00:02:56.380> forever<00:02:56.590> every

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
because none of us live forever every

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.380 
because none of us live forever every
second<00:02:57.310> of<00:02:57.400> every<00:02:57.640> day<00:02:57.670> we're<00:02:57.970> one<00:02:58.180> step

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
second of every day we're one step

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:59.820 
second of every day we're one step
closer<00:02:58.660> to<00:02:58.750> death<00:02:58.870> and<00:02:59.320> I<00:02:59.440> think<00:02:59.500> it's<00:02:59.709> about

00:02:59.820 --> 00:02:59.830 
closer to death and I think it's about

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:01.350 
closer to death and I think it's about
time<00:03:00.190> we<00:03:00.340> started<00:03:00.610> treating<00:03:00.850> each<00:03:00.970> other<00:03:01.150> like

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
time we started treating each other like

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:02.460 
time we started treating each other like
it<00:03:01.510> so<00:03:01.600> the<00:03:01.720> next<00:03:01.900> time<00:03:02.050> someone<00:03:02.290> does

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
it so the next time someone does

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.050 
it so the next time someone does
something<00:03:02.500> bad<00:03:02.980> or<00:03:03.160> upsetting<00:03:03.610> to<00:03:03.730> you<00:03:03.880> and
