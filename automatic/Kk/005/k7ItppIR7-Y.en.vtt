seen one other one in my life right and

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.949 
seen one other one in my life right and
they<00:03:03.740> called<00:03:03.980> it<00:03:04.160> a<00:03:04.280> mass<00:03:04.760> air<00:03:05.120> induction<00:03:05.510> back

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:05.959 
they called it a mass air induction back

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:08.350 
they called it a mass air induction back
then<00:03:06.230> yeah<00:03:06.560> a<00:03:06.590> venturi<00:03:07.069> designed<00:03:07.610> right<00:03:08.030> they

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:08.360 
then yeah a venturi designed right they

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:09.990 
then yeah a venturi designed right they
come<00:03:08.510> out<00:03:08.660> with<00:03:08.870> it<00:03:09.050> somewhere<00:03:09.380> around<00:03:09.440> nine

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
come out with it somewhere around nine

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.480 
come out with it somewhere around nine
ninety-one<00:03:10.510> no<00:03:11.080> good<00:03:11.380> back<00:03:11.680> then<00:03:11.950> I<00:03:11.980> think<00:03:12.160> the

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:12.490 
ninety-one no good back then I think the

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:15.960 
ninety-one no good back then I think the
thing<00:03:12.700> was<00:03:13.260> $499<00:03:14.260> holy<00:03:14.530> small<00:03:15.250> so<00:03:15.490> you<00:03:15.550> know<00:03:15.790> it

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
thing was $499 holy small so you know it

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:17.670 
thing was $499 holy small so you know it
was<00:03:16.090> quite<00:03:16.390> a<00:03:16.420> piece<00:03:16.690> back<00:03:16.960> yeah<00:03:17.170> yeah<00:03:17.440> yeah

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
was quite a piece back yeah yeah yeah

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.010 
was quite a piece back yeah yeah yeah
well<00:03:18.040> you<00:03:18.700> know<00:03:18.850> but<00:03:19.030> what<00:03:19.210> it<00:03:19.330> adds<00:03:19.510> in

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:20.020 
well you know but what it adds in

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:21.780 
well you know but what it adds in
horsepower<00:03:20.380> I<00:03:20.680> mean<00:03:21.010> it<00:03:21.100> was<00:03:21.220> probably<00:03:21.550> back

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
horsepower I mean it was probably back

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.190 
horsepower I mean it was probably back
then<00:03:22.000> was<00:03:22.150> still<00:03:22.300> cheap<00:03:22.540> yeah<00:03:22.810> you<00:03:22.990> know<00:03:23.140> to

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
then was still cheap yeah you know to

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:24.690 
then was still cheap yeah you know to
add<00:03:23.350> that<00:03:23.500> kind<00:03:23.710> of<00:03:23.770> horsepower<00:03:23.950> yeah<00:03:24.430> I<00:03:24.460> did<00:03:24.670> a

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
add that kind of horsepower yeah I did a

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.080 
add that kind of horsepower yeah I did a
dyno<00:03:25.030> on<00:03:25.420> it<00:03:25.600> at<00:03:25.720> the<00:03:25.900> SVT<00:03:26.470> show<00:03:26.950> uh<00:03:27.090> Ted

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
dyno on it at the SVT show uh Ted

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:31.770 
dyno on it at the SVT show uh Ted
Russell<00:03:28.570> about<00:03:29.530> six<00:03:29.830> months<00:03:30.160> ago<00:03:30.370> it<00:03:30.520> had<00:03:30.780> 315

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.470 
Russell about six months ago it had 315
rear-wheel<00:03:32.260> horsepower<00:03:32.290> and<00:03:33.280> I<00:03:33.370> think<00:03:33.640> 305

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
rear-wheel horsepower and I think 305

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.360 
rear-wheel horsepower and I think 305
foot-pounds<00:03:35.170> of<00:03:35.230> torque<00:03:35.290> awesome

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
foot-pounds of torque awesome

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:38.940 
foot-pounds of torque awesome
can<00:03:36.610> we<00:03:36.700> hear<00:03:36.910> it<00:03:36.970> huh<00:03:37.810> can<00:03:38.170> we<00:03:38.200> hear<00:03:38.470> it<00:03:38.500> up
