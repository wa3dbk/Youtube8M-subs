down<00:01:02.300> now<00:01:03.300> I<00:01:03.329> curl<00:01:03.750> this<00:01:04.049> so<00:01:04.530> I<00:01:04.559> didn't<00:01:04.920> come

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
down now I curl this so I didn't come

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.149 
down now I curl this so I didn't come
out<00:01:05.369> about<00:01:05.840> looking<00:01:06.840> on<00:01:07.229> with<00:01:07.680> you<00:01:08.070> know

out about looking on with you know
massive<00:01:08.670> layering<00:01:08.909> and<00:01:09.270> curling<00:01:09.630> I<00:01:09.810> did<00:01:10.020> this

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:11.119 
massive layering and curling I did this

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:15.920 
massive layering and curling I did this
myself<00:01:12.320> and<00:01:13.320> still<00:01:13.860> trying<00:01:14.130> to<00:01:14.250> work<00:01:14.610> with<00:01:14.970> the

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
myself and still trying to work with the

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.590 
myself and still trying to work with the
curling<00:01:16.560> and<00:01:16.799> sand<00:01:17.130> you<00:01:17.490> know<00:01:17.610> what<00:01:18.060> curl

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
curling and sand you know what curl

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.719 
curling and sand you know what curl
pattern<00:01:19.229> little<00:01:19.530> it<00:01:19.590> best<00:01:19.799> best<00:01:20.280> with<00:01:20.460> it<00:01:20.490> i

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
pattern little it best best with it i

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.730 
pattern little it best best with it i
really<00:01:20.970> think<00:01:21.180> like<00:01:21.479> the<00:01:22.729> the<00:01:23.729> backwards

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
really think like the the backwards

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.249 
really think like the the backwards
layering<00:01:26.030> not<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.150> backwards<00:01:27.540> Larry<00:01:27.840> but<00:01:28.170> the

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
layering not the backwards Larry but the

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.530 
layering not the backwards Larry but the
backward<00:01:28.710> backward<00:01:29.040> curling<00:01:29.790> pattern<00:01:30.360> where

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
backward backward curling pattern where

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.670 
backward backward curling pattern where
it<00:01:30.689> goes<00:01:30.869> like<00:01:31.140> that<00:01:31.350> is<00:01:32.659> really<00:01:33.659> really<00:01:33.689> acute

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
it goes like that is really really acute

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.399 
it goes like that is really really acute
angles<00:01:35.159> well<00:01:35.460> with<00:01:35.640> it<00:01:35.850> I<00:01:36.090> slip<00:01:37.020> this<00:01:37.229> right

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
angles well with it I slip this right

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.359 
angles well with it I slip this right
here<00:01:38.090> but<00:01:39.090> you<00:01:39.240> don't<00:01:39.450> have<00:01:39.630> to<00:01:40.040> you<00:01:41.040> can<00:01:41.220> do

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
here but you don't have to you can do

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.700 
here but you don't have to you can do
whatever<00:01:42.210> you<00:01:42.479> want<00:01:42.720> but<00:01:42.869> I<00:01:42.990> just<00:01:43.229> like<00:01:43.470> that

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
whatever you want but I just like that

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.749 
whatever you want but I just like that
little<00:01:43.950> look<00:01:44.100> so<00:01:44.490> that's<00:01:44.729> me<00:01:44.939> um<00:01:46.280> the<00:01:47.280> downside

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
little look so that's me um the downside

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.100 
little look so that's me um the downside
to<00:01:47.939> this<00:01:48.060> wig<00:01:48.299> aside<00:01:48.600> from<00:01:48.720> the<00:01:48.869> fact<00:01:48.899> that

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
to this wig aside from the fact that

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.710 
to this wig aside from the fact that
isn't<00:01:49.560> have<00:01:49.680> columns<00:01:50.130> that<00:01:50.340> it's<00:01:51.240> really

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
isn't have columns that it's really

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.240 
isn't have columns that it's really
really<00:01:52.079> short<00:01:52.320> in<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.560> back<00:01:52.590> and<00:01:52.950> I'll<00:01:53.040> show

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
really short in the back and I'll show

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.719 
really short in the back and I'll show
you<00:01:53.280> what<00:01:53.490> I<00:01:53.579> mean<00:01:54.409> as<00:01:55.409> you<00:01:55.530> can<00:01:55.649> see<00:01:55.860> it<00:01:56.219> really

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
you what I mean as you can see it really

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.389 
you what I mean as you can see it really
comes<00:01:57.000> up<00:01:57.180> high<00:01:57.390> and<00:01:57.750> it<00:01:58.110> actually<00:01:58.380> can't<00:01:59.130> come

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
comes up high and it actually can't come

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.179 
comes up high and it actually can't come
up<00:01:59.700> above<00:02:00.479> where<00:02:00.899> your<00:02:01.049> natural<00:02:01.469> hair<00:02:01.680> line<00:02:01.920> in

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
up above where your natural hair line in

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:06.170 
up above where your natural hair line in
so<00:02:02.750> that<00:02:03.750> may<00:02:04.560> be<00:02:04.590> something<00:02:04.829> to<00:02:05.759> keep<00:02:05.939> in<00:02:06.119> mind

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
so that may be something to keep in mind

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:06.940 
so that may be something to keep in mind
you<00:02:06.509> may<00:02:06.659> need

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950
