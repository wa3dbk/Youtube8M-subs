for<00:00:50.370> shaping<00:00:50.820> basically<00:00:51.420> I<00:00:51.449> just<00:00:51.690> use<00:00:51.809> like

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
for shaping basically I just use like

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.830 
for shaping basically I just use like
the<00:00:52.079> general<00:00:52.910> rule<00:00:53.910> you're<00:00:54.329> supposed<00:00:54.539> to<00:00:54.600> line

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
the general rule you're supposed to line

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.889 
the general rule you're supposed to line
it<00:00:54.870> up<00:00:55.050> from<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.649> side<00:00:55.860> of<00:00:55.949> your<00:00:56.039> nose<00:00:56.899> and

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
it up from the side of your nose and

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.180 
it up from the side of your nose and
then<00:00:58.350> that's<00:00:58.500> where<00:00:58.649> your<00:00:58.770> eyebrow<00:00:59.010> should

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
then that's where your eyebrow should

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.520 
then that's where your eyebrow should
start<00:00:59.489> but<00:01:00.059> I<00:01:00.090> don't<00:01:00.390> like<00:01:00.719> follow<00:01:01.379> this

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
start but I don't like follow this

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:02.990 
start but I don't like follow this
exactly<00:01:02.010> because<00:01:02.160> I'd<00:01:02.340> have<00:01:02.460> to<00:01:02.550> take<00:01:02.670> a<00:01:02.730> chunk

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
exactly because I'd have to take a chunk

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.390 
exactly because I'd have to take a chunk
off<00:01:03.210> this<00:01:03.420> eyebrow<00:01:03.780> if<00:01:04.019> I<00:01:04.080> did<00:01:04.260> that<00:01:04.409> but<00:01:05.339> I

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
off this eyebrow if I did that but I

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.000 
off this eyebrow if I did that but I
kind<00:01:05.640> of<00:01:05.700> use<00:01:05.820> that<00:01:05.850> as<00:01:06.000> a<00:01:06.150> guideline<00:01:06.590> if<00:01:07.590> you

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
kind of use that as a guideline if you

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.340 
kind of use that as a guideline if you
think<00:01:08.220> it's<00:01:08.340> gonna<00:01:08.460> look<00:01:08.610> stupid<00:01:08.939> you<00:01:09.510> know

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
think it's gonna look stupid you know

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.679 
think it's gonna look stupid you know
don't<00:01:10.830> take<00:01:11.100> off<00:01:11.310> huge<00:01:11.729> chunks<00:01:11.760> and<00:01:12.420> like<00:01:12.540> have

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
don't take off huge chunks and like have

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:18.020 
don't take off huge chunks and like have
that<00:01:12.720> huge<00:01:13.170> space<00:01:14.150> but<00:01:15.150> that<00:01:16.759> kind<00:01:17.759> of<00:01:17.820> helps

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
that huge space but that kind of helps

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.789 
that huge space but that kind of helps
and<00:01:18.210> then<00:01:18.390> for<00:01:18.960> your<00:01:19.020> arch<00:01:19.259> you're<00:01:19.619> supposed

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
and then for your arch you're supposed

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.249 
and then for your arch you're supposed
to<00:01:19.890> go<00:01:20.009> from<00:01:20.130> your<00:01:20.310> nose<00:01:20.600> through<00:01:21.600> your<00:01:21.780> pupil

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
to go from your nose through your pupil

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:23.810 
to go from your nose through your pupil
and<00:01:22.560> then<00:01:23.040> that's<00:01:23.220> where<00:01:23.369> your<00:01:23.460> arch<00:01:23.610> should

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
and then that's where your arch should

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:29.560 
and then that's where your arch should
be<00:01:24.030> I<00:01:25.610> cannot<00:01:26.610> see<00:01:26.880> what<00:01:26.970> I'm<00:01:27.030> doing<00:01:27.270> but<00:01:27.590> yeah

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.570 
be I cannot see what I'm doing but yeah

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:32.930 
you can kind of get the idea and then

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
use a shade two shades darker if you

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:07.760 
use a shade two shades darker if you
have<00:03:06.000> blonde<00:03:06.239> hair<00:03:06.360> and<00:03:06.720> two<00:03:07.230> shades<00:03:07.440> lighter

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:07.770 
have blonde hair and two shades lighter

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:10.910 
have blonde hair and two shades lighter
if<00:03:08.069> you<00:03:08.190> have<00:03:08.310> dark<00:03:08.610> hair<00:03:08.670> I<00:03:09.560> hope<00:03:10.560> I<00:03:10.709> said<00:03:10.770> that

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
if you have dark hair I hope I said that

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.309 
if you have dark hair I hope I said that
right<00:03:11.010> I<00:03:11.400> have<00:03:12.090> blonde<00:03:12.450> hair<00:03:12.569> though<00:03:12.840> and<00:03:13.140> this

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:13.319 
right I have blonde hair though and this

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:17.089 
right I have blonde hair though and this
is<00:03:13.380> two<00:03:13.950> shades<00:03:14.250> lighter<00:03:14.700> I<00:03:14.880> think<00:03:15.980> because<00:03:16.980> my

00:03:17.089 --> 00:03:17.099 
is two shades lighter I think because my

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:19.430 
is two shades lighter I think because my
eyebrows<00:03:17.400> are<00:03:17.519> kind<00:03:17.700> of<00:03:17.760> dark<00:03:18.290> compared<00:03:19.290> to<00:03:19.349> my

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.170 
eyebrows are kind of dark compared to my
hair<00:03:19.620> cuz<00:03:19.800> they<00:03:19.890> diet<00:03:20.160> I<00:03:20.489> honestly<00:03:21.060> don't

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
hair cuz they diet I honestly don't

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:22.910 
hair cuz they diet I honestly don't
think<00:03:21.420> it's<00:03:21.540> a<00:03:21.599> big<00:03:21.780> deal<00:03:21.930> just<00:03:21.989> try<00:03:22.620> to<00:03:22.680> get<00:03:22.890> a

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
think it's a big deal just try to get a

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.520 
think it's a big deal just try to get a
color<00:03:23.160> that's<00:03:23.370> similar<00:03:23.730> to<00:03:23.940> your<00:03:24.269> hair<00:03:24.420> color
