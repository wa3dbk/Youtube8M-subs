00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:08.769
 Hello Kasai City Acupuncture manipulative Institute 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:15.530
 mik is masa of the hospital director 

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:19.250
 Today I would like to share how to make a running form 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:26.500
 8 It's a marathon boom right now 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:28.940
 I think there are many people who have started marathon who have never run at all 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:31.730
 Well there 

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:36.320
 Also I'd get questions 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:37.170
 Arm is unsure You do not know how to say it able to run a good of either Na Toka what I feel When you hit 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:42.000
 Absent 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:43.260
 I'm running properly but I often get the question of what to do 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:49.339
 Because 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:49.339
 First, today the upper body of your way to you I want to tell 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:58.219
 It is a first 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:01:01.489
 Since there is a sound I sternum in the middle of the chest 

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:03.590
 It is here when it was 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:05.700
 Make before 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:11.840
 I feel like spring 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:16.479
 In short, it feels like you're pulling back, and you'll open up your chest 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:19.800
 Or the scapula on this back 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:23.090
 I think a good, even images, such as lapping 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:25.070
 While everyone in this state 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:30.979
 Run 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:33.750
 Although I Some people say the kana not a very go to this state when the lung is firmly 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:40.409
 Because it will spread 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:42.520
 For example , if you run with such a cat back like usual, it will be difficult in the second half 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:46.689
 Well here 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:48.600
 Scapula with chest open 

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:51.240
 Good 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.600
 It feels like 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.860
 When it can run 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:02:01.650
 Breathing is easy and slowly 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:07.170
 Bridge clear jogging becomes possible 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:07.920
 At first, it may be a bit annoying because it is a different way of running 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:15.090
 Also 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:18.250
 That this is a comfortable home that will continue so good in this man be a slow pace 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:20.730
 Of the thought to come so it can be seen that 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.730
 By all means 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:33.790
 Tomorrow the run way when the grass Te bright people at a later date to this time of practice 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:34.819
 How to swing arms I think that it might be better to try running for a while keeping in mind how chest 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.780
 I will 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:40.040
 By all means everyone 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.040
 Please try it
