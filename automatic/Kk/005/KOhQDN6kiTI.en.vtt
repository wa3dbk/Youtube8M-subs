00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.430
 hello dear friends today wanted 

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:07.609
 try to talk briefly about 

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:09.650
 the development of the project by creating a knife on my 

00:00:07.609 --> 00:00:11.240
 own ideas so let's say rented with 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:12.740
 the phone so apologize immediately for 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:17.089
 image quality for keeping 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:20.900
 the camera is in the hands well here in this case 

00:00:17.089 --> 00:00:23.300
 see a few like that let's say 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.640
 layouts how they looked. would be the first 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.829
 the layout was so made of paper just 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.689
 cut from that of and for which i 

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:32.960
 drew vadim yare for which he had another 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:33.829
 thanks a lot then i'm like 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.739
 sketches with some changes 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:38.629
 transferred it just to cardboard to 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:42.070
 so the simplest way to model something 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:45.410
 how does the knife work and now extreme 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:47.239
 the prototype that I did it was made 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:50.030
 like this with a sculpted handle 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:51.589
 clay and the mountain itself blade of 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.230
 cardboard here it is already allowed 

00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:56.149
 evaluate that's it performance 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:58.210
 clicking some positions ie something like 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:01.070
 what does he do what was supposed 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.329
 I will say so that the case handle 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.309
 sculpted plasticine 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:05.990
 similar modeling already when all 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:08.119
 there is a thickness and not just from 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:11.060
 the plane as there is no it allows 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:12.590
 do a bit of work with the grooves because 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.649
 example had to come to the conclusion that 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.390
 that this here is a notch here under the little finger 

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:20.119
 and and on this knife it is better to eliminate it 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.740
 interferes with the dimensions of the handle 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:24.350
 which here it turns out that we were 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.700
 uncomfortable we have it eliminated it only 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.409
 here I am somehow a little bit 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.170
 tried to blind some others 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:30.880
 the grooves that are obtained here are very 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.689
 must say what 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:36.170
 prototyping using plasticine 

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:38.479
 it led to all sorts of useful 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.520
 thoughts and ultimately on this 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:42.890
 the moment now is vadim last 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:46.280
 last time so let's say from drew for 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.390
 me here is such a layout let's such 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.820
 in the frame a closer show for 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:52.399
 interested here he specifically already 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:54.740
 did it that way from drew 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:56.509
 blade in a complex state in one color 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:00.409
 unfolded by others and 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:02.659
 actually the handle here 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:06.649
 there is a moment that vadim by 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:08.420
 to my request, let's say from 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:11.720
 drew here as he has it 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:13.560
 It turned out the lock in the sap frame was already possible 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.530
 we more or less deal with 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.000
 the position of the thrust pin on this knife 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.500
 the ace where he should be here 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.930
 it became quite clear with this 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:25.220
 modeling I honestly thought about 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:27.450
 that the pin would be nice 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.190
 hexagon example or octahedral 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.730
 in order to with elevators on this our 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.870
 fight if necessary and here 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.160
 at least here are introduced so 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.610
 portrayed how he has it 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:40.620
 it turned out here was supposed to do 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.090
 such here under finger grooves with 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.709
 notches such but here's how 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.200
 cute how can it 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:48.239
 look but not quite like that 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.549
 it turned out to draw Vadim as he 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:52.549
 wanted at least with notches 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:55.590
 maybe we need to do something else 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:57.600
 Well, actually the idea of ​​this knife I 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.340
 Already stated I remind you that we are dealing with 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.290
 folding kitchen knife that is essentially 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.390
 it's like the boss is so very 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:08.130
 narrow niche to large 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:10.349
 account but in this case I'm on one of 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:13.620
 close here this state of sketches 

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:15.660
 received a comment from Viktor Kulikov 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:18.180
 which it was originally supposed that 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:20.549
 will do the leg of my order and the shooting range in 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:22.560
 In general, he said this but it is quite obvious 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:25.530
 for me initially when designing 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.820
 this knife is all that such a knife turns out 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.910
 very narrowly lower 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:32.850
 and rather it can be called well closer to 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:35.519
 useless because the situation is 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:36.930
 that in those places where you need to work on 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:38.940
 flat surface yes that is how would 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.829
 there must be a plank too if you are ready 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:43.620
 carry with you a little board then most likely 

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:45.269
 you too well what it is to take a sample 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.220
 kitchen knife with fixed blade 

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:49.560
 which everything is done to 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:52.819
 work on a flat surface here 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:55.530
 such was his position besides he 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:58.230
 expressed such a moment then how would 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:00.690
 when he safrane video boards yet 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:02.750
 was not drawn and he did not say 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:04.940
 what seems to him that 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:07.330
 that's exactly the locking mechanism on this 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:09.980
 knife in mind its shape 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:13.310
 hardly last for a long time but i would 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:15.020
 wanted people to say so in 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:18.920
 designing such mechanical 

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:20.989
 devices are more sophisticated than I could 

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:22.970
 say is it true because here 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:24.650
 how would such an indication people 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:26.980
 still what kind of things do he do 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:29.390
 said damn with this form of handle 

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:33.050
 lock unless what is backlog or 

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:35.600
 triathlon make how to lock on such 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:37.760
 Type to well what's the usual liner on 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:39.050
 this or that frame there we do not know maybe 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:42.440
 here is a safrane how are we here it 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:44.240
 we will not be effective 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:47.090
 enough work that is how would he 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:49.100
 then didn't turn my mind about 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:52.040
 why is it so why does he think so but 

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:54.200
 nevertheless there was such a remark 

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:55.580
 did want to get it people who 

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:57.680
 engaged in the design of what is there 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:59.030
 galley salt at all the case here as well, 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.140
 so basically I think that 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:04.130
 we have got such a nice one 

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:06.800
 a knife but I must say that communication is like with 

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:09.229
 lack of interest from the contractor 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:11.810
 performance of work in this case the project 

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:13.820
 while it is because I have not yet found 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:15.910
 of that who would undertake to realize it already 

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:19.340
 Well, the form of a real knife 

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:21.140
 here but nevertheless if suddenly there is 

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:22.870
 any suggestions dear colleagues 

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:25.130
 share in the comments with those 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:26.780
 contacts of those people who could 

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:29.180
 be interested in doing this 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:30.860
 knife in reality so interesting 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:33.169
 for me personally, I am pleased to renditions 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:35.300
 I hope you’ve been in touch with them 

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:37.720
 interesting thank you very much for watching 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:37.720
 until
