though<00:00:30.779> there's<00:00:31.019> no<00:00:31.170> logo<00:00:31.560> so<00:00:32.489> we'll<00:00:32.969> have<00:00:33.090> to

order<00:00:33.450> up<00:00:33.690> a<00:00:33.809> repro<00:00:34.260> for<00:00:34.590> it<00:00:34.739> and<00:00:35.730> then

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
order up a repro for it and then

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.990 
order up a repro for it and then
advertise<00:00:36.420> it<00:00:36.600> as<00:00:36.719> such<00:00:40.550> frets<00:00:41.550> might<00:00:41.790> be

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
take the tuners off and let's see if he

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
see it's the patent pending and remember

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.999 
see it's the patent pending and remember
there<00:01:20.820> it's<00:01:21.780> also<00:01:21.960> nice<00:01:22.229> to<00:01:22.470> see<00:01:22.650> that<00:01:22.680> there

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
there it's also nice to see that there

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.870 
there it's also nice to see that there
aren't<00:01:23.189> any<00:01:23.900> additional<00:01:24.900> holes<00:01:25.220> or<00:01:26.220> finish

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
aren't any additional holes or finish

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.520 
aren't any additional holes or finish
and<00:01:27.350> that<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.470> finish<00:01:28.829> is<00:01:29.869> lighter<00:01:30.869> under<00:01:31.409> the

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
and that the finish is lighter under the

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.219 
and that the finish is lighter under the
tuners<00:01:31.890> so<00:01:32.450> you<00:01:33.450> can<00:01:33.600> tell<00:01:33.780> right<00:01:33.960> away<00:01:34.020> that

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
tuners so you can tell right away that

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.160 
tuners so you can tell right away that
the<00:01:34.530> pickguard<00:01:34.770> is<00:01:35.070> not<00:01:35.280> a<00:01:35.310> repro<00:01:36.049> because<00:01:37.049> of

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
the pickguard is not a repro because of

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.950 
the pickguard is not a repro because of
how<00:01:37.259> much<00:01:37.439> it's<00:01:37.680> shrunk<00:01:38.509> around<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:39.659> screw

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
how much it's shrunk around the screw

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:46.280 
how much it's shrunk around the screw
holes<00:01:40.200> and<00:01:41.899> yet<00:01:42.899> to<00:01:43.020> see<00:01:43.200> a<00:01:43.229> repro<00:01:43.680> company<00:01:45.290> go

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
holes and yet to see a repro company go

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.289 
holes and yet to see a repro company go
that<00:01:46.530> far<00:01:47.600> so<00:01:48.600> this<00:01:48.750> is<00:01:48.899> good<00:01:49.110> to<00:01:49.140> see<00:01:49.409> um<00:01:50.299> maybe

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
that far so this is good to see um maybe

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.649 
that far so this is good to see um maybe
you<00:01:51.450> remember<00:01:51.600> last<00:01:52.079> time<00:01:53.090> you<00:01:54.090> can<00:01:54.240> see<00:01:54.450> more

oh<00:02:12.010> this<00:02:12.819> is<00:02:13.000> unfortunate<00:02:13.349> check<00:02:14.349> this<00:02:14.500> out

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
oh this is unfortunate check this out

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.350 
oh this is unfortunate check this out
when<00:02:16.330> they<00:02:16.480> put<00:02:16.690> on<00:02:16.720> that<00:02:16.959> replacement<00:02:17.680> huh

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
when they put on that replacement huh

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.430 
when they put on that replacement huh
backplate<00:02:19.360> they<00:02:19.540> drilled<00:02:19.780> a<00:02:19.870> new<00:02:19.989> hole<00:02:20.200> right

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
backplate they drilled a new hole right

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.940 
backplate they drilled a new hole right
through<00:02:20.500> the<00:02:20.910> cavity<00:02:21.910> there<00:02:22.590> so<00:02:23.590> while<00:02:23.800> we're

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
through the cavity there so while we're

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.190 
through the cavity there so while we're
doing<00:02:24.069> the<00:02:24.250> pickups<00:02:24.670> I'm<00:02:25.209> gonna<00:02:25.780> open<00:02:25.959> a

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
doing the pickups I'm gonna open a

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.210 
doing the pickups I'm gonna open a
couple<00:02:26.410> of<00:02:26.650> covers<00:02:26.970> very<00:02:27.970> carefully<00:02:28.920> and<00:02:29.920> make

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
couple of covers very carefully and make

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:31.140 
couple of covers very carefully and make
sure<00:02:30.370> that<00:02:30.519> none<00:02:30.670> of<00:02:30.700> these<00:02:30.910> have<00:02:31.120> been

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
sure that none of these have been

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:32.940 
sure that none of these have been
rewound<00:02:31.690> I<00:02:31.959> don't<00:02:32.230> think<00:02:32.410> they<00:02:32.530> have<00:02:32.709> been

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
rewound I don't think they have been

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.089 
rewound I don't think they have been
based<00:02:33.190> on<00:02:33.370> the<00:02:33.489> readings<00:02:33.910> and<00:02:34.239> all<00:02:35.019> this<00:02:35.590> but

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:36.099 
based on the readings and all this but

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:41.490 
based on the readings and all this but
it's<00:02:36.690> nice<00:02:37.690> to<00:02:37.959> double-check<00:02:40.110> and<00:02:41.110> that<00:02:41.260> looks

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
it's nice to double-check and that looks

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.690 
it's nice to double-check and that looks
original<00:02:43.769> while<00:02:44.769> we're<00:02:44.950> in<00:02:45.130> here<00:02:45.400> and<00:02:45.519> doing

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700
