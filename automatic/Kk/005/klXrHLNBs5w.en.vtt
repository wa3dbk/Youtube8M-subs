you will see that can I we've been

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.910 
you will see that can I we've been
giving<00:00:18.119> us<00:00:18.270> these<00:00:18.480> cards<00:00:18.900> one<00:00:19.080> by<00:00:19.260> one<00:00:19.529> it's

giving us these cards one by one it's
come<00:00:20.160> to<00:00:20.189> the<00:00:20.400> point<00:00:20.430> where<00:00:20.910> we've<00:00:21.689> sort<00:00:22.020> of

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
come to the point where we've sort of

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:23.960 
come to the point where we've sort of
realized<00:00:22.500> that<00:00:22.800> unless<00:00:23.369> they<00:00:23.550> give<00:00:23.730> us<00:00:23.850> a

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
realized that unless they give us a

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.779 
realized that unless they give us a
really<00:00:24.240> good<00:00:24.660> card<00:00:25.019> that<00:00:25.289> really<00:00:25.650> sets<00:00:26.400> apart

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
really good card that really sets apart

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.060 
really good card that really sets apart
the<00:00:27.060> archetype<00:00:27.480> apart<00:00:28.260> from<00:00:28.349> other<00:00:28.590> ones<00:00:28.859> and

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
the archetype apart from other ones and

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.189 
the archetype apart from other ones and
actually<00:00:29.310> gives<00:00:29.519> it<00:00:29.670> an<00:00:29.760> advantage<00:00:30.300> in<00:00:30.510> some

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
actually gives it an advantage in some

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:32.720 
actually gives it an advantage in some
certain<00:00:31.410> way<00:00:31.710> that<00:00:31.890> maybe<00:00:32.009> next<00:00:32.250> season<00:00:32.460> once

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
certain way that maybe next season once

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:33.889 
certain way that maybe next season once
or<00:00:32.910> something<00:00:33.180> like<00:00:33.270> that<00:00:33.360> the<00:00:33.750> edge<00:00:33.870> of

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
or something like that the edge of

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.870 
or something like that the edge of
archetype<00:00:34.410> itself<00:00:34.800> is<00:00:35.010> actually<00:00:35.250> fucking

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
archetype itself is actually fucking

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.360 
archetype itself is actually fucking
terrible<00:00:36.360> it's<00:00:36.719> got<00:00:37.020> these<00:00:37.350> problems<00:00:37.950> which

terrible it's got these problems which

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.990 
terrible it's got these problems which
are<00:00:38.670> fundamental<00:00:39.360> problems<00:00:40.170> that<00:00:40.379> affect<00:00:41.340> the

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
are fundamental problems that affect the

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.030 
are fundamental problems that affect the
entire<00:00:42.300> deck<00:00:42.660> and<00:00:42.899> cannot<00:00:43.260> be<00:00:43.320> changed<00:00:43.649> it's

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
cars to make it better the actual

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.150 
cars to make it better the actual
archetype<00:00:48.210> itself<00:00:48.600> is<00:00:48.840> bad<00:00:49.379> and<00:00:49.770> it<00:00:49.980> will

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
archetype itself is bad and it will

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.880 
archetype itself is bad and it will
always<00:00:50.399> be<00:00:50.550> bad<00:00:51.000> for<00:00:51.719> a<00:00:51.750> very<00:00:52.170> few<00:00:52.440> bunch<00:00:52.739> of

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
always be bad for a very few bunch of

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.680 
always be bad for a very few bunch of
reasons<00:00:53.070> they<00:00:53.460> seem<00:00:53.699> to<00:00:53.730> make<00:00:54.000> every<00:00:54.360> single

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
reasons they seem to make every single

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.479 
reasons they seem to make every single
card<00:00:54.930> in<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.230> of<00:00:55.350> type<00:00:55.649> actually<00:00:56.219> really

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
have it on the screen somewhere 1800

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.529 
have it on the screen somewhere 1800
attack<00:01:01.340> 1800<00:01:02.340> offense<00:01:02.609> why<00:01:03.000> not<00:01:03.180> just<00:01:03.329> make<00:01:03.480> it

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
attack 1800 offense why not just make it

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.100 
attack 1800 offense why not just make it
2,000<00:01:04.350> all<00:01:04.559> 1900<00:01:05.250> ok<00:01:05.760> so<00:01:05.820> it<00:01:06.479> matches<00:01:06.689> up<00:01:06.960> to

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
2,000 all 1900 ok so it matches up to

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.109 
2,000 all 1900 ok so it matches up to
fund<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:07.860> king<00:01:08.040> rio<00:01:08.220> it<00:01:08.580> goes<00:01:08.729> up<00:01:08.760> with

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
fund the king rio it goes up with

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.670 
fund the king rio it goes up with
alexandria<00:01:09.810> dragon<00:01:10.170> or<00:01:10.260> something<00:01:10.530> like<00:01:10.619> that

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
alexandria dragon or something like that

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.789 
alexandria dragon or something like that
so<00:01:11.010> why<00:01:11.580> make<00:01:11.729> 1800<00:01:12.510> 1800<00:01:13.140> is<00:01:13.260> no<00:01:13.380> better<00:01:13.619> than

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
so why make 1800 1800 is no better than

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.969 
so why make 1800 1800 is no better than
1600<00:01:14.700> or<00:01:14.820> 1700<00:01:15.299> ok<00:01:15.750> it's<00:01:16.290> all<00:01:16.500> grouped<00:01:16.799> into

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
1600 or 1700 ok it's all grouped into

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.679 
1600 or 1700 ok it's all grouped into
the<00:01:17.100> same<00:01:17.310> frame<00:01:17.580> because<00:01:17.970> these<00:01:18.450> are<00:01:18.659> the

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
the same frame because these are the

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.020 
the same frame because these are the
attack<00:01:19.229> powers<00:01:19.650> that<00:01:19.950> need<00:01:20.220> you<00:01:20.430> to<00:01:20.640> have<00:01:20.850> to

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
attack powers that need you to have to

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.140 
attack powers that need you to have to
use<00:01:21.270> extra<00:01:21.600> cards<00:01:22.080> to<00:01:22.710> get<00:01:22.920> over<00:01:23.100> things<00:01:23.520> ok

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
use extra cards to get over things ok

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.969 
use extra cards to get over things ok
you<00:01:24.659> do<00:01:24.810> have<00:01:24.990> two<00:01:25.170> things<00:01:25.380> like<00:01:25.560> the<00:01:25.650> mobile

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
you do have two things like the mobile

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.800 
you do have two things like the mobile
arms<00:01:26.250> cards<00:01:26.640> which<00:01:26.790> you<00:01:26.939> can<00:01:27.090> equip<00:01:27.360> onto<00:01:27.570> them

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
arms cards which you can equip onto them

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.120 
arms cards which you can equip onto them
and<00:01:27.840> you<00:01:28.049> can<00:01:28.140> make<00:01:28.259> them<00:01:28.380> more<00:01:28.409> powerful<00:01:29.009> you

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
and you can make them more powerful you

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.710 
and you can make them more powerful you
can<00:01:29.369> make<00:01:29.490> your<00:01:29.579> opponent's<00:01:30.090> monsters<00:01:30.509> weaker

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
can make your opponent's monsters weaker

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.440 
can make your opponent's monsters weaker
but<00:01:31.439> in<00:01:31.680> general<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.460> card<00:01:32.700> is<00:01:32.939> terrible

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
but in general the card is terrible

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.450 
but in general the card is terrible
there<00:01:33.750> is<00:01:33.869> no<00:01:34.049> reason<00:01:34.259> why<00:01:34.890> would<00:01:35.100> you<00:01:35.220> want<00:01:35.400> to

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
there is no reason why would you want to

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.310 
there is no reason why would you want to
run<00:01:35.610> an<00:01:35.729> 1800<00:01:36.329> normal<00:01:36.689> I<00:01:36.840> mean<00:01:37.020> it's<00:01:37.170> just

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
run an 1800 normal I mean it's just

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.690 
run an 1800 normal I mean it's just
going<00:01:37.470> to<00:01:37.500> be<00:01:37.560> summon<00:01:38.040> it<00:01:38.159> then<00:01:38.369> they<00:01:38.460> sound

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
going to be summon it then they sound

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.550 
going to be summon it then they sound
