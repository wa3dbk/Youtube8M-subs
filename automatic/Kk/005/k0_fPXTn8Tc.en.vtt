many<00:04:25.680> nude<00:04:26.680> lip<00:04:26.919> products<00:04:27.280> but<00:04:27.940> that's

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.120 
many nude lip products but that's

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.980 
many nude lip products but that's
basically<00:04:28.330> what<00:04:28.750> is<00:04:29.220> just<00:04:30.690> it<00:04:31.690> has<00:04:31.840> the

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:31.990 
basically what is just it has the

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:33.960 
basically what is just it has the
consistency<00:04:32.110> of<00:04:32.590> lipstick<00:04:33.130> and<00:04:33.729> then<00:04:33.940> i

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:33.970 
consistency of lipstick and then i

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:37.260 
consistency of lipstick and then i
notice<00:04:34.479> that<00:04:34.510> if<00:04:34.810> you<00:04:34.930> unscrew<00:04:35.650> the<00:04:36.070> lid<00:04:36.270> it

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:37.270 
notice that if you unscrew the lid it

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:39.330 
notice that if you unscrew the lid it
comes<00:04:37.720> out<00:04:37.840> as<00:04:37.990> gloss<00:04:38.320> look<00:04:38.950> you<00:04:39.070> can<00:04:39.220> make

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:39.340 
comes out as gloss look you can make

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:42.120 
comes out as gloss look you can make
that<00:04:39.490> gloss<00:04:40.200> so<00:04:41.200> it's<00:04:41.740> kind<00:04:41.889> of<00:04:41.919> like<00:04:42.010> a

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:42.130 
that gloss so it's kind of like a

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:43.980 
that gloss so it's kind of like a
two-in-one<00:04:42.490> probably<00:04:43.479> why<00:04:43.540> they<00:04:43.660> call<00:04:43.810> it<00:04:43.840> a

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:43.990 
two-in-one probably why they call it a

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:48.090 
two-in-one probably why they call it a
lift<00:04:44.169> win<00:04:44.440> so<00:04:45.340> I<00:04:45.820> like<00:04:46.360> that<00:04:46.600> my<00:04:47.500> next<00:04:47.860> lip

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:53.880 
whites look a lot brighter so I do enjoy

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:56.690 
whites look a lot brighter so I do enjoy
that<00:06:54.210> it's<00:06:54.570> nicer<00:06:54.930> than<00:06:54.960> using<00:06:55.230> a<00:06:55.680> black<00:06:56.460> or<00:06:56.670> a

00:06:56.690 --> 00:06:56.700 
that it's nicer than using a black or a

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:59.210 
that it's nicer than using a black or a
brown<00:06:56.760> eyeliner<00:06:57.300> underwear<00:06:58.080> every<00:06:58.200> day<00:06:58.500> so<00:06:59.160> it

00:06:59.210 --> 00:06:59.220 
brown eyeliner underwear every day so it

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:01.610 
brown eyeliner underwear every day so it
brightens<00:06:59.550> it<00:06:59.610> up<00:06:59.730> and<00:07:00.270> I<00:07:01.230> think<00:07:01.440> that<00:07:01.530> is

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:01.620 
brightens it up and I think that is

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:03.980 
brightens it up and I think that is
everything<00:07:02.160> except<00:07:02.760> for<00:07:03.060> this<00:07:03.510> one<00:07:03.570> product

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:03.990 
everything except for this one product

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:05.900 
everything except for this one product
that<00:07:04.140> I<00:07:04.260> haven't<00:07:04.470> tried<00:07:04.650> it<00:07:04.740> all<00:07:04.980> yet<00:07:05.220> it's<00:07:05.580> a

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:05.910 
that I haven't tried it all yet it's a

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:08.990 
that I haven't tried it all yet it's a
lash<00:07:06.660> booster<00:07:07.110> mascara<00:07:07.680> in<00:07:08.010> navy<00:07:08.430> and<00:07:08.880> that's

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:09.000 
lash booster mascara in navy and that's

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.220 
lash booster mascara in navy and that's
probably<00:07:09.150> why<00:07:09.390> I<00:07:09.450> haven't<00:07:09.690> worn<00:07:10.050> it<00:07:10.200> yet

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:10.230 
probably why I haven't worn it yet

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:12.310 
probably why I haven't worn it yet
because<00:07:10.560> I<00:07:10.710> haven't<00:07:10.860> needed<00:07:11.220> a<00:07:11.400> use<00:07:11.610> for<00:07:11.850> Navy
