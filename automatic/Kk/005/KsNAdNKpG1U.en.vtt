touch-up<00:04:41.550> paint<00:04:41.760> right<00:04:41.940> here<00:04:42.140> so<00:04:43.140> it's<00:04:43.290> a

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:43.350 
touch-up paint right here so it's a

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:47.330 
touch-up paint right here so it's a
pretty<00:04:43.500> inconspicuous<00:04:43.980> spot<00:04:46.010> but<00:04:47.010> that's<00:04:47.160> it

pretty inconspicuous spot but that's it

for<00:04:47.370> that<00:04:47.550> oh<00:04:51.170> I<00:04:52.170> guess<00:04:52.470> overall<00:04:52.800> that<00:04:52.920> pretty

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:53.160 
for that oh I guess overall that pretty

much<00:04:53.280> covers<00:04:53.670> it
