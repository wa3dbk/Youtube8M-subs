00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
dimension as well kind of using the same

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.949 
dimension as well kind of using the same
pain<00:02:15.140> so<00:02:15.319> basically<00:02:15.769> all<00:02:15.890> I'm<00:02:16.250> using<00:02:16.400> is<00:02:16.959> at

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
brown and dark brown now to give it even

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.630

spatula I'm going to add black to the
sides<00:02:31.069> of<00:02:31.220> the<00:02:31.310> buildings<00:02:31.730> to<00:02:31.849> give<00:02:32.090> it<00:02:32.180> more

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
sides of the buildings to give it more

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.800 
sides of the buildings to give it more
depth<00:02:33.290> and<00:02:33.560> more<00:02:33.799> dimension<00:02:34.459> feel<00:02:35.239> to<00:02:35.450> them<00:02:35.599> as

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
depth and more dimension feel to them as

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:39.699 
depth and more dimension feel to them as
well<00:02:36.680> as<00:02:36.890> to<00:02:37.370> the<00:02:37.489> bottom<00:02:37.790> of<00:02:37.910> the<00:02:38.090> street<00:02:38.709> so

at the bottom and just the same thing

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.059 
at the bottom and just the same thing
goes<00:02:50.150> for<00:02:50.180> the<00:02:50.540> reflection<00:02:51.140> and<00:02:51.349> the<00:02:51.590> sailboat

00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:52.069 
goes for the reflection and the sailboat

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:56.020 
goes for the reflection and the sailboat
as<00:02:52.250> well<00:02:53.920> don't<00:02:54.920> forget<00:02:55.220> the<00:02:55.370> reflection<00:02:55.910> for

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
as well don't forget the reflection for

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.289 
as well don't forget the reflection for
the<00:02:56.150> sailboat<00:02:56.890> and<00:02:57.890> I'm<00:02:58.040> just<00:02:58.340> using<00:02:58.489> spatula

00:02:59.289 --> 00:02:59.299 
the sailboat and I'm just using spatula

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:03.340 
the sailboat and I'm just using spatula
and<00:02:59.480> and<00:02:59.900> smudge<00:03:00.350> the<00:03:00.650> pain<00:03:00.859> downward<00:03:02.230> to<00:03:03.230> it

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.350 
and and smudge the pain downward to it

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:04.990 
and and smudge the pain downward to it
even<00:03:03.709> more<00:03:03.859> contrast<00:03:04.430> I'm<00:03:04.640> going<00:03:04.790> to<00:03:04.850> add

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
even more contrast I'm going to add

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.090 
even more contrast I'm going to add
white<00:03:05.329> paint<00:03:05.660> to<00:03:05.959> the<00:03:06.170> other<00:03:06.530> side<00:03:06.829> of<00:03:06.980> the

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:07.100 
white paint to the other side of the

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:10.390 
white paint to the other side of the
buildings<00:03:07.459> and<00:03:08.090> again<00:03:08.359> using<00:03:08.569> spatula<00:03:09.400> quick

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
buildings and again using spatula quick

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.569 
buildings and again using spatula quick
strokes<00:03:10.700> like<00:03:10.850> this<00:03:11.120> just<00:03:11.660> you<00:03:11.930> know<00:03:12.049> add<00:03:12.579> some

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:13.579 
strokes like this just you know add some

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:18.039 
strokes like this just you know add some
here<00:03:13.850> some<00:03:13.880> there<00:03:14.150> and<00:03:16.000> maybe<00:03:17.000> add<00:03:17.299> some<00:03:17.630> white

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:18.049 
here some there and maybe add some white

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:44.770 
here some there and maybe add some white
paint<00:03:18.319> to<00:03:19.250> the<00:03:19.340> water<00:03:19.609> just<00:03:19.910> what<00:03:20.090> as<00:03:20.269> well

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.050 

now<00:03:45.780> I'm<00:03:46.380> using<00:03:46.620> the<00:03:46.830> same<00:03:46.980> spatula<00:03:47.640> with<00:03:47.910> the

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
now I'm using the same spatula with the

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.540 
now I'm using the same spatula with the
same<00:03:48.330> colors<00:03:48.810> that<00:03:48.990> I<00:03:49.020> had<00:03:49.290> mixed<00:03:50.010> in<00:03:50.250> already

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:50.550 
same colors that I had mixed in already

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:53.600 
same colors that I had mixed in already
on<00:03:50.790> it<00:03:50.970> from<00:03:51.780> the<00:03:51.900> buildings<00:03:52.320> and<00:03:52.860> I<00:03:53.160> had<00:03:53.580> a

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
on it from the buildings and I had a

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:56.870 
on it from the buildings and I had a
good<00:03:53.850> mixture<00:03:54.120> of<00:03:54.270> brown<00:03:54.420> white<00:03:55.020> and<00:03:55.430> black<00:03:56.430> so

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 
good mixture of brown white and black so

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.300 
good mixture of brown white and black so
I<00:03:56.910> had<00:03:57.150> this<00:03:57.300> little<00:03:57.600> gray<00:03:58.020> looking<00:03:58.709> color<00:03:58.980> and

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
I had this little gray looking color and

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:03.140 
I had this little gray looking color and
I<00:03:59.910> had<00:04:00.060> that<00:04:00.300> to<00:04:00.510> the<00:04:00.660> top<00:04:01.590> of<00:04:01.739> the<00:04:01.950> canvas<00:04:02.730> so

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
I had that to the top of the canvas so

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:10.640 
I had that to the top of the canvas so
it<00:04:03.330> looks<00:04:03.600> more<00:04:04.760> interesting<00:04:05.760> this<00:04:05.880> way<00:04:09.650> I'm

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
it looks more interesting this way I'm

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:13.330 
it looks more interesting this way I'm
going<00:04:10.860> to<00:04:10.950> continue<00:04:11.370> working<00:04:11.940> with<00:04:12.810> the<00:04:12.930> same

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:13.340 
going to continue working with the same

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:15.849 
going to continue working with the same
special<00:04:14.340> of<00:04:14.459> white<00:04:14.670> paint<00:04:14.910> adding<00:04:15.510> more

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:15.859 
special of white paint adding more

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:18.349 
special of white paint adding more
contrast<00:04:16.859> to<00:04:16.950> the<00:04:17.130> sailboat<00:04:17.640> to<00:04:18.209> its

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359 
contrast to the sailboat to its

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:24.550 
contrast to the sailboat to its
reflection<00:04:20.480> using<00:04:21.480> a<00:04:21.900> side<00:04:22.410> of<00:04:22.830> the<00:04:23.310> spatula<00:04:23.550> I

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:24.560 
reflection using a side of the spatula I

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:30.290 
reflection using a side of the spatula I
would<00:04:26.780> create<00:04:28.130> water<00:04:29.130> waves<00:04:29.490> kind<00:04:30.090> of

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.300 
would create water waves kind of

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.120 
would create water waves kind of
breaking<00:04:30.780> the<00:04:30.900> image<00:04:31.320> in<00:04:31.800> there<00:04:31.980> are<00:04:32.100> a

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:32.130 
breaking the image in there are a

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:34.760 
breaking the image in there are a
reflection<00:04:32.610> of<00:04:32.970> the<00:04:33.090> war<00:04:33.270> so<00:04:33.600> it<00:04:34.169> has<00:04:34.440> more

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:34.770 
reflection of the war so it has more

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:38.900 
reflection of the war so it has more
realistic<00:04:35.190> look<00:04:35.610> to<00:04:35.820> it<00:04:35.940> I<00:04:36.870> use<00:04:37.350> a<00:04:37.770> brush<00:04:38.550> a

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:38.910 
realistic look to it I use a brush a

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:41.450 
realistic look to it I use a brush a
clean<00:04:39.090> brush<00:04:39.800> it<00:04:40.800> doesn't<00:04:41.100> matter<00:04:41.220> whether

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.460 
clean brush it doesn't matter whether

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:46.159 
clean brush it doesn't matter whether
dry<00:04:41.880> and<00:04:42.440> kind<00:04:43.440> of<00:04:43.530> smudge<00:04:43.979> the<00:04:44.580> reflection<00:04:45.360> to

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:46.169 
dry and kind of smudge the reflection to

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:49.950 
dry and kind of smudge the reflection to
break<00:04:46.470> out<00:04:46.740> break<00:04:47.250> it<00:04:47.460> up<00:04:47.580> a<00:04:47.700> little<00:04:47.729> bit

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:49.960 
break out break it up a little bit

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.560 
break out break it up a little bit
and<00:04:50.500> finally<00:04:51.070> to<00:04:51.550> add<00:04:51.699> some<00:04:51.910> color<00:04:52.150> to<00:04:52.270> this

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:52.570 
and finally to add some color to this

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:56.370 
and finally to add some color to this
painting<00:04:53.050> I'll<00:04:53.289> use<00:04:53.620> small<00:04:54.610> brush<00:04:54.940> and<00:04:55.380> I'll

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:56.380 
painting I'll use small brush and I'll

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:59.640 
painting I'll use small brush and I'll
use<00:04:56.590> bright<00:04:57.009> orange<00:04:57.400> paint<00:04:57.729> and<00:04:58.410> I'll<00:04:59.410> just

00:04:59.640 --> 00:04:59.650 
use bright orange paint and I'll just

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:01.710 
use bright orange paint and I'll just
add<00:04:59.889> a<00:04:59.949> little<00:05:00.310> color<00:05:00.580> to<00:05:00.729> the<00:05:01.150> bottom<00:05:01.360> of<00:05:01.570> the

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:01.720 
add a little color to the bottom of the

buildings you know maybe representing

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:07.439

00:05:07.439 --> 00:05:07.449 
flowers maybe you know lights from the

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:10.499 
flowers maybe you know lights from the
city<00:05:07.720> itself<00:05:08.729> whatever<00:05:09.729> it<00:05:09.970> might<00:05:10.150> be<00:05:10.330> will

00:05:10.499 --> 00:05:10.509
