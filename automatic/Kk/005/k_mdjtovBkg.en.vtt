 book the basics of a simple se psn 

00:00:10.619 --> 00:00:13.759
 first let's go to the preferences file 

00:00:15.659 --> 00:00:19.400
 and here we mention our explorer quality preferences 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.539
 water quality 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:26.539
 now we choose a room 

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:32.770
 which key r3 claro I love you 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:34.720
 so to our bishop 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.720
 I love you on the brand we select the startup prince 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:41.450
 and here where our character is born 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:44.520
 we are on the segment we add the small road 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:50.790
 here it is 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:54.160
 but we have the game to change the return settings 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.280
 ok 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.890
 and here we are in our request ps 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.970
 our room 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.770
 the outside 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.370
 by pressing the tab key you access a minute you can change 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.950
 the gaming stations the miser 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:52.890
 hi fi car and brightness 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.119
 hit it just like eamon give a prologue effect prologue 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.150
 the intensity of the color freedom of the fog 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:06.730
 ok now let's go fury to change the water to give it a 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.250
 a more realistic effect 

00:02:13.609 --> 00:02:16.609
 here then 

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:24.040
 select mutter speed putting the accent on the water speed will be 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.419
 greater by putting the water outlet on the stem 

00:02:27.419 --> 00:02:30.419
 but it will be minor 

00:02:33.179 --> 00:02:35.019
 ppg diamon effect 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:38.129
 or because he nisticÃ² 

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:41.129
 the color of water 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:54.019
 then change only water 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:01.140
 for example we have now made an effect 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.140
 reflection of the sunset on the water 

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:07.789
 realistic photo 

00:03:18.689 --> 00:03:24.649
 under bother colossus of goods the color is that you see underwater here it is 

00:03:24.649 --> 00:03:27.649
 bear 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:34.379
 through modern re we can lower it raise the level of the 

00:03:45.219 --> 00:03:48.219
 now they can also edit 

00:03:59.729 --> 00:04:02.729
 as more suited to our cipiesse art 

00:04:07.029 --> 00:04:10.029
 if we want to do a night scenario 

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:27.599
 ok 

00:04:27.599 --> 00:04:30.599
 ie 1 photo 

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:36.469
 here if we want to do a fps set in space 

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:41.789
 obviously I changed my duty 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:50.960
 that I break the water level to show the earth 

00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:00.479
 I'm really very well 

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:24.809
 here threshold shows another fps in mind you the space 

00:05:30.529 --> 00:05:35.439
 here if we want to do an fps and urban we set it outside 

00:05:55.479 --> 00:05:58.479
 I go Barolo you can have fun as you like 

00:06:03.409 --> 00:06:06.409
