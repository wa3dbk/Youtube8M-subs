exhaust sounds compared to that overall
we<00:01:36.630> am<00:01:36.780> stuff<00:01:37.110> so<00:01:37.380> let's<00:01:37.950> go<00:01:49.010> one<00:01:50.010> thing<00:01:50.220> to

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:50.400 
we am stuff so let's go one thing to

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.250 
we am stuff so let's go one thing to
take<00:01:50.549> note<00:01:50.610> is<00:01:51.030> that<00:01:51.270> this<00:01:51.659> new<00:01:51.930> exhaust

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:52.260 
take note is that this new exhaust

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.380 
take note is that this new exhaust
system<00:01:52.440> we're<00:01:52.830> putting<00:01:53.130> on<00:01:53.250> here<00:01:53.580> has<00:01:54.180> the

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
system we're putting on here has the

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.660 
system we're putting on here has the
hanger<00:01:54.720> brackets<00:01:55.260> already<00:01:55.950> lined<00:01:56.190> up<00:01:56.400> with

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
hanger brackets already lined up with

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.210 
hanger brackets already lined up with
our<00:01:56.850> existing<00:01:57.360> rubber<00:01:57.840> hangers<00:01:58.170> now<00:01:59.010> what<00:01:59.190> I

00:01:59.210 --> 00:01:59.220 
our existing rubber hangers now what I

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:00.590 
our existing rubber hangers now what I
usually<00:01:59.460> do<00:01:59.760> is<00:01:59.880> I'll<00:02:00.000> usually<00:02:00.270> spray<00:02:00.570> a

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
usually do is I'll usually spray a

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:01.969 
usually do is I'll usually spray a
little<00:02:00.720> bit<00:02:00.869> of<00:02:00.990> lube<00:02:01.290> in<00:02:01.500> here<00:02:01.680> something

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
little bit of lube in here something

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.430 
little bit of lube in here something
like<00:02:02.010> JB<00:02:02.490> 80<00:02:02.640> wd-40<00:02:03.450> something<00:02:04.200> along<00:02:04.409> that

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:04.440 
like JB 80 wd-40 something along that

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.170 
like JB 80 wd-40 something along that
lines<00:02:04.890> or<00:02:05.130> you<00:02:05.220> could<00:02:05.369> even<00:02:05.460> coat<00:02:05.760> this<00:02:05.940> with<00:02:06.150> a

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
lines or you could even coat this with a

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.520 
lines or you could even coat this with a
little<00:02:06.390> bit<00:02:06.479> of<00:02:06.510> grease<00:02:06.780> or<00:02:06.960> something<00:02:07.020> and

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
little bit of grease or something and

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.789 
little bit of grease or something and
that<00:02:08.399> just<00:02:08.700> helps<00:02:09.000> it<00:02:09.119> so<00:02:09.299> that<00:02:09.420> it<00:02:09.539> slides

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:09.799 
that just helps it so that it slides

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:15.110 
that just helps it so that it slides
through<00:02:10.799> the<00:02:11.039> grommet<00:02:12.049> better<00:02:13.549> and<00:02:14.549> there<00:02:15.000> you

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
through the grommet better and there you

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.630 
through the grommet better and there you
go<00:02:15.330> and<00:02:15.720> that'll<00:02:16.590> be<00:02:16.799> the<00:02:16.920> same<00:02:17.189> for<00:02:17.489> all<00:02:17.610> of

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
go and that'll be the same for all of

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.610 
go and that'll be the same for all of
them<00:02:17.970> all<00:02:18.090> the<00:02:18.120> way<00:02:18.269> through<00:02:18.540> the<00:02:18.629> back<00:02:18.810> now

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
them all the way through the back now

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.170 
them all the way through the back now
when<00:02:19.739> you<00:02:19.890> ready<00:02:20.099> to<00:02:20.159> put<00:02:20.310> this<00:02:20.459> big<00:02:20.700> bad

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
when you ready to put this big bad

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.330 
when you ready to put this big bad
muffler<00:02:21.689> up<00:02:21.840> on<00:02:22.049> here<00:02:22.290> one<00:02:22.920> of<00:02:22.980> the<00:02:23.069> things<00:02:23.250> you

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
muffler up on here one of the things you

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:24.800 
muffler up on here one of the things you
want<00:02:23.519> to<00:02:23.580> take<00:02:23.700> a<00:02:23.730> look<00:02:23.970> at<00:02:24.150> is<00:02:24.420> that<00:02:24.569> you<00:02:24.629> can

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
want to take a look at is that you can

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.509 
want to take a look at is that you can
see<00:02:24.989> on<00:02:25.140> this<00:02:25.290> side<00:02:25.560> it<00:02:25.739> has<00:02:25.890> these<00:02:26.099> cutout

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:26.519 
see on this side it has these cutout

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:29.360 
see on this side it has these cutout
slots<00:02:27.319> this<00:02:28.319> is<00:02:28.560> the<00:02:28.680> side<00:02:28.920> that's<00:02:28.950> going<00:02:29.189> to

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
slots this is the side that's going to

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.670 
slots this is the side that's going to
go<00:02:29.519> it<00:02:29.670> slide<00:02:29.939> over<00:02:30.269> this<00:02:30.450> pipe<00:02:30.750> over<00:02:31.019> here<00:02:31.349> on

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
go it slide over this pipe over here on

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.949 
go it slide over this pipe over here on
the<00:02:31.890> other<00:02:31.980> end<00:02:32.310> you<00:02:33.180> can<00:02:33.360> see<00:02:33.540> there's<00:02:33.780> no

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
the other end you can see there's no

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:36.679 
the other end you can see there's no
cutout<00:02:34.459> so<00:02:35.459> that's<00:02:35.640> going<00:02:35.879> to<00:02:35.939> go<00:02:36.090> to<00:02:36.120> the<00:02:36.480> back

00:02:36.679 --> 00:02:36.689 
cutout so that's going to go to the back

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:38.149 
cutout so that's going to go to the back
of<00:02:36.900> the<00:02:36.989> trucks<00:02:37.290> now<00:02:37.470> the<00:02:37.590> way<00:02:37.739> you<00:02:37.859> know<00:02:37.980> which

00:02:38.149 --> 00:02:38.159 
of the trucks now the way you know which

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:39.510 
of the trucks now the way you know which
way<00:02:38.430> is<00:02:38.609> front<00:02:38.999> and

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:39.520 
way is front and

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.970 
way is front and
rerun<00:02:40.060> your<00:02:40.210> exhaust<00:02:40.600> what<00:02:41.500> I've<00:02:41.620> done<00:02:41.800> is

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
rerun your exhaust what I've done is

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.820 
rerun your exhaust what I've done is
I've<00:02:42.130> fed<00:02:42.310> and<00:02:42.850> grabbed<00:02:43.210> my<00:02:43.450> Jack<00:02:43.750> to<00:02:44.500> put<00:02:44.710> up

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:44.830 
I've fed and grabbed my Jack to put up

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:46.980 
I've fed and grabbed my Jack to put up
underneath<00:02:45.160> here<00:02:45.460> just<00:02:45.780> something<00:02:46.780> to<00:02:46.840> hold

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:46.990 
underneath here just something to hold

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:49.260 
underneath here just something to hold
this<00:02:47.170> up<00:02:47.410> in<00:02:47.560> place<00:02:47.850> while<00:02:48.850> we're<00:02:49.030> getting

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:49.270 
this up in place while we're getting

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:51.540 
this up in place while we're getting
everything<00:02:49.450> adjusted<00:02:49.780> because<00:02:50.400> tightened<00:02:51.400> up

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:51.550 
everything adjusted because tightened up

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:56.130 
everything adjusted because tightened up
so<00:02:53.970> you<00:02:54.970> can<00:02:55.150> either<00:02:55.270> if<00:02:55.660> you<00:02:55.810> don't<00:02:55.990> have<00:02:56.110> a

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
so you can either if you don't have a

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:57.750 
so you can either if you don't have a
jack<00:02:56.470> somewhere<00:02:56.950> there<00:02:57.160> if<00:02:57.550> you're<00:02:57.640> doing

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
jack somewhere there if you're doing

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.730 
jack somewhere there if you're doing
this<00:02:57.970> sitting<00:02:58.840> on<00:02:58.930> the<00:02:59.050> ground<00:02:59.290> rather<00:02:59.560> than

00:02:59.730 --> 00:02:59.740 
this sitting on the ground rather than

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:01.800 
this sitting on the ground rather than
on<00:02:59.980> a<00:03:00.010> hoist<00:03:00.400> you<00:03:01.000> can<00:03:01.120> just<00:03:01.300> do<00:03:01.420> a<00:03:01.450> jack<00:03:01.780> stand

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
on a hoist you can just do a jack stand

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.930 
on a hoist you can just do a jack stand
or<00:03:02.260> a<00:03:02.290> couple<00:03:02.620> blocks<00:03:02.860> or<00:03:03.250> you<00:03:03.430> know<00:03:03.520> something

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
or a couple blocks or you know something

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:05.730 
or a couple blocks or you know something
underneath<00:03:04.180> there<00:03:04.450> to<00:03:04.600> just<00:03:05.200> to<00:03:05.320> hold<00:03:05.470> it<00:03:05.620> up

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:05.740 
underneath there to just to hold it up

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:08.310 
underneath there to just to hold it up
so<00:03:05.980> that<00:03:06.360> stays<00:03:07.360> up<00:03:07.540> where<00:03:07.720> you<00:03:07.810> want<00:03:08.020> it<00:03:08.140> like

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:08.320 
so that stays up where you want it like

wanted to show you how to do this on
these<00:03:31.540> what<00:03:32.200> I<00:03:32.230> do<00:03:32.380> is<00:03:32.890> I<00:03:33.070> usually<00:03:33.250> try<00:03:33.580> and

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
these what I do is I usually try and

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.450 
these what I do is I usually try and
keep<00:03:33.790> this<00:03:34.060> this<00:03:34.650> iboot<00:03:35.650> bar<00:03:35.890> right<00:03:36.190> here<00:03:36.400> in

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:36.460 
keep this this iboot bar right here in

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:39.390 
keep this this iboot bar right here in
the<00:03:36.520> middle<00:03:36.790> lined<00:03:37.570> up<00:03:37.750> on<00:03:37.990> the<00:03:38.140> slot<00:03:38.500> so<00:03:38.770> that

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
the middle lined up on the slot so that

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:40.740 
the middle lined up on the slot so that
way<00:03:39.520> you<00:03:39.580> know<00:03:39.730> you've<00:03:39.910> got<00:03:40.030> it<00:03:40.180> centered<00:03:40.540> and

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
way you know you've got it centered and

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:42.300 
way you know you've got it centered and
then<00:03:41.200> everything<00:03:41.530> will<00:03:41.620> tighten<00:03:41.950> down<00:03:41.980> good

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
then everything will tighten down good

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:43.770 
then everything will tighten down good
and<00:03:42.520> then<00:03:42.940> you<00:03:43.000> take<00:03:43.240> your<00:03:43.270> wrench<00:03:43.510> and<00:03:43.750> just

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
and then you take your wrench and just

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.830 
and then you take your wrench and just
tighten<00:03:44.050> it<00:03:44.200> up<00:03:45.210> tight<00:03:46.210> as<00:03:46.330> you<00:03:46.390> can<00:03:46.570> actually

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
tighten it up tight as you can actually

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:56.700 
tighten it up tight as you can actually
so<00:03:54.480> just<00:03:55.480> like<00:03:55.660> anything<00:03:55.930> whenever<00:03:56.470> you're
