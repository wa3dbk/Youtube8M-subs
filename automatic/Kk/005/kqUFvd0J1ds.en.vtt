chemical energy can be stored and we

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.859 
chemical energy can be stored and we

right<00:02:02.040> on<00:02:02.159> the<00:02:02.250> other<00:02:02.280> hand<00:02:02.700> animals<00:02:03.420> are

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
right on the other hand animals are

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.139 
right on the other hand animals are
consumers<00:02:04.439> which<00:02:04.979> means<00:02:05.250> that<00:02:05.460> they<00:02:05.579> must<00:02:05.820> eat

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
consumers which means that they must eat

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.449 
consumers which means that they must eat
food<00:02:06.540> that<00:02:06.570> other<00:02:06.990> animals<00:02:07.290> or<00:02:07.799> plants<00:02:08.069> have

food that other animals or plants have

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.460 
food that other animals or plants have
produced<00:02:08.879> somewhere<00:02:09.750> else<00:02:09.989> at<00:02:10.170> an<00:02:10.289> other

earlier<00:02:11.039> point<00:02:11.370> in<00:02:11.459> time<00:02:11.670> they<00:02:12.239> can't<00:02:12.599> make

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
earlier point in time they can't make

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.440 
earlier point in time they can't make
their<00:02:13.140> own

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
their own

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.540 
their own
food<00:02:13.660> so<00:02:14.170> this<00:02:14.290> means<00:02:14.560> they're<00:02:14.770> heterotrophs

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
food so this means they're heterotrophs

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.390 
food so this means they're heterotrophs
and<00:02:15.819> the<00:02:15.970> word<00:02:16.090> hetero<00:02:16.480> comes<00:02:16.930> from<00:02:17.170> it<00:02:18.069> means

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
and the word hetero comes from it means

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.449 
and the word hetero comes from it means
different<00:02:19.060> so<00:02:19.269> heterotrophs<00:02:20.170> or<00:02:20.459> consumers

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
different so heterotrophs or consumers

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:23.400 
different so heterotrophs or consumers
or<00:02:21.879> organisms<00:02:22.540> that<00:02:22.629> have<00:02:22.810> to<00:02:22.959> eat<00:02:23.080> food<00:02:23.379> that

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
or organisms that have to eat food that

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.740 
or organisms that have to eat food that

was made by a different organism because

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.710 
was made by a different organism because
they<00:02:25.870> can't<00:02:26.110> make<00:02:26.319> it<00:02:26.470> themselves<00:02:27.720> food

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
they can't make it themselves food

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.350

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
producers who change that sunlight

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.100 
producers who change that sunlight
energy<00:02:36.310> into<00:02:36.550> chemical<00:02:36.730> energy<00:02:37.120> and<00:02:37.510> then<00:02:38.080> a

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
energy into chemical energy and then a

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.830 
energy into chemical energy and then a
primary<00:02:38.769> consumer<00:02:39.370> or<00:02:39.670> an<00:02:39.880> herbivore<00:02:40.390> will

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
primary consumer or an herbivore will

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.780 
primary consumer or an herbivore will
eat<00:02:40.989> the<00:02:41.140> plant<00:02:41.440> and<00:02:41.739> then<00:02:42.250> a<00:02:42.340> secondary

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
eat the plant and then a secondary

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.270 
eat the plant and then a secondary
consumer<00:02:43.330> will<00:02:43.510> eat<00:02:43.720> the<00:02:43.870> herbivore<00:02:44.470> and<00:02:44.769> then

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
consumer will eat the herbivore and then

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.309 
consumer will eat the herbivore and then
maybe<00:02:45.519> a<00:02:45.610> tertiary<00:02:45.910> consumer<00:02:46.720> will<00:02:46.870> eat<00:02:47.049> the

00:02:47.309 --> 00:02:47.319 
maybe a tertiary consumer will eat the

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:50.160 
maybe a tertiary consumer will eat the
second<00:02:48.130> consumer<00:02:48.670> and<00:02:48.849> so<00:02:49.390> on<00:02:49.599> until<00:02:50.140> finally

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
second consumer and so on until finally

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.589 
second consumer and so on until finally
everything<00:02:51.069> eventually<00:02:51.610> dies<00:02:52.120> and<00:02:52.540> gets

00:02:52.589 --> 00:02:52.599 
everything eventually dies and gets

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:54.390 
everything eventually dies and gets
decomposed<00:02:53.019> and<00:02:53.560> so<00:02:53.709> whatever<00:02:54.010> energy<00:02:54.190> is

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
decomposed and so whatever energy is

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.050 
decomposed and so whatever energy is
left<00:02:54.579> over<00:02:54.790> gets<00:02:55.299> passed<00:02:55.599> to<00:02:55.780> decomposers<00:02:57.060> now

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
left over gets passed to decomposers now

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:59.759 
left over gets passed to decomposers now
we<00:02:58.120> can<00:02:58.360> look<00:02:58.510> at<00:02:58.660> this<00:02:58.810> using<00:02:59.019> some<00:02:59.349> pictures

00:02:59.759 --> 00:02:59.769 
we can look at this using some pictures

you've got a basic food chain set up
here<00:03:02.560> with<00:03:02.709> plants<00:03:03.220> and<00:03:03.340> some<00:03:03.549> animals<00:03:03.970> so

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
here with plants and some animals so

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.059 
here with plants and some animals so
let's<00:03:04.269> look<00:03:04.480> at<00:03:04.630> each<00:03:04.810> step<00:03:05.170> and<00:03:05.470> there's<00:03:05.980> a

let's look at each step and there's a

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:09.569 
let's look at each step and there's a
name<00:03:06.370> for<00:03:06.700> each<00:03:06.760> step<00:03:07.410> okay<00:03:08.410> Sun<00:03:08.769> the<00:03:09.340> Sun<00:03:09.549> is

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:09.579 
name for each step okay Sun the Sun is

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:11.759 
name for each step okay Sun the Sun is
the<00:03:10.000> original<00:03:10.450> source<00:03:10.690> of<00:03:10.840> the<00:03:10.900> energy<00:03:11.319> the

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
energy passes to plants who which are

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.569 
energy passes to plants who which are
called<00:03:13.870> producers<00:03:14.470> and<00:03:14.709> then<00:03:15.220> the<00:03:15.340> first

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:15.579 
called producers and then the first

called producers and then the first
thing<00:03:15.819> that<00:03:15.880> eats<00:03:16.150> the<00:03:16.269> plants<00:03:16.720> are<00:03:16.870> called

producers at the bottom and above them

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:55.140 
producers at the bottom and above them
you<00:05:52.660> place<00:05:52.930> the<00:05:53.470> consumers<00:05:53.980> and<00:05:54.220> the<00:05:54.700> arrows

here I've added in just for clarity to
show<00:05:57.400> you<00:05:57.460> how<00:05:57.640> the<00:05:57.700> energies<00:05:58.240> passing<00:05:58.750> up

00:05:58.890 --> 00:05:58.900 
show you how the energies passing up

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:01.410 
show you how the energies passing up
from<00:05:59.440> the<00:05:59.590> bottom<00:05:59.950> towards<00:06:00.400> the<00:06:00.700> top<00:06:00.940> until

from the bottom towards the top until

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:03.570 
from the bottom towards the top until
finally<00:06:01.900> it<00:06:02.290> gets<00:06:02.440> all<00:06:02.650> the<00:06:03.040> way<00:06:03.160> to<00:06:03.220> the<00:06:03.370> top

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:03.580 
finally it gets all the way to the top

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:06.300 
finally it gets all the way to the top
and<00:06:03.910> as<00:06:04.660> you<00:06:04.840> can<00:06:04.960> see<00:06:05.200> as<00:06:05.470> you<00:06:05.500> move<00:06:05.740> closer<00:06:06.010> to

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:06.310 
and as you can see as you move closer to

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:08.820 
and as you can see as you move closer to
the<00:06:06.430> top<00:06:06.640> there's<00:06:07.210> less<00:06:07.540> and<00:06:07.750> less<00:06:07.840> volume<00:06:08.620> in

this triangle and there's a reason for

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:15.810 
this triangle and there's a reason for
that<00:06:13.420> it's<00:06:13.660> the<00:06:13.840> 10%<00:06:14.500> rule<00:06:14.680> each<00:06:15.250> time<00:06:15.610> energy

at the next level easy way to see this
is<00:06:40.990> if<00:06:41.230> we<00:06:41.320> act

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:41.620 
is if we act

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:43.980 
is if we act
to<00:06:41.710> use<00:06:41.919> some<00:06:42.190> numbers<00:06:42.580> so<00:06:43.060> imagine<00:06:43.479> we<00:06:43.570> have<00:06:43.780> a

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:43.990 
to use some numbers so imagine we have a

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:46.439 
to use some numbers so imagine we have a
thousand<00:06:44.650> kilograms<00:06:44.979> of<00:06:45.460> a<00:06:45.639> producer<00:06:46.210> let's

00:06:46.439 --> 00:06:46.449 
thousand kilograms of a producer let's

00:06:46.449 --> 00:06:48.420 
thousand kilograms of a producer let's
say<00:06:46.600> corn<00:06:46.990> plants<00:06:47.440> and<00:06:47.889> we're<00:06:48.010> gonna<00:06:48.100> feed

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:48.430 
say corn plants and we're gonna feed

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:50.400 
say corn plants and we're gonna feed
that<00:06:48.669> corn<00:06:49.030> to<00:06:49.300> some<00:06:49.449> primary<00:06:49.720> consumers

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:50.410 
that corn to some primary consumers

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:52.920 
that corn to some primary consumers
let's<00:06:50.800> say<00:06:51.010> chickens<00:06:51.550> all<00:06:52.060> right<00:06:52.300> according

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:52.930 
let's say chickens all right according

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:54.810 
let's say chickens all right according
