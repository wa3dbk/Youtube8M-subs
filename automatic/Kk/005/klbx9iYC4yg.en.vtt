00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
was to be released as a full title which

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.749 
was to be released as a full title which
is<00:01:40.380> something<00:01:40.710> that<00:01:40.829> they<00:01:40.979> should<00:01:41.310> do<00:01:41.520> but<00:01:41.700> I

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
is something that they should do but I

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.219 
is something that they should do but I
think<00:01:41.970> they<00:01:42.060> make<00:01:42.240> more<00:01:42.450> money<00:01:42.600> on<00:01:42.810> it<00:01:42.930> being<00:01:43.079> a

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
think they make more money on it being a

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:44.480 
think they make more money on it being a
free-to-play<00:01:43.799> it's<00:01:44.009> really<00:01:44.310> really

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
free-to-play it's really really

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.100 
free-to-play it's really really
convenient<00:01:44.850> I'm<00:01:45.060> not<00:01:45.240> sure<00:01:45.509> not<00:01:45.780> because<00:01:45.990> they

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
convenient I'm not sure not because they

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.139 
convenient I'm not sure not because they
get<00:01:46.290> a<00:01:46.350> good<00:01:46.740> amount<00:01:46.890> of<00:01:47.130> it<00:01:47.250> I<00:01:47.399> think<00:01:47.909> we<00:01:48.000> did<00:01:48.119> a

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
get a good amount of it I think we did a

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.310 
get a good amount of it I think we did a
little<00:01:48.360> bit<00:01:48.509> of<00:01:48.540> research<00:01:48.899> and<00:01:49.110> it<00:01:49.200> was

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
little bit of research and it was

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.240 
little bit of research and it was
somewhere<00:01:49.590> in<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:49.799> eight<00:01:49.920> hundred<00:01:50.220> dollars

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
somewhere in the eight hundred dollars

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.830 
somewhere in the eight hundred dollars
or<00:01:50.670> something<00:01:51.000> arranged<00:01:51.390> that<00:01:51.509> if<00:01:51.659> you<00:01:51.750> were

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
or something arranged that if you were

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.230

to buy everything flat how it is it

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.639 
to buy everything flat how it is it
