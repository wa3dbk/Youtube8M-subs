 solid that we have never disunited 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:35.700

 more numerous 25 elements on the line 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.520
 starting to thwart all 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.840
 longest escape attempts 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.140
 is to put to the credit of Thomas 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.090
 voeckler 236 kilometers tops in a 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.690
 group of 21 riders from the first 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.059
 kilometers 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.219
 then accompanied by seneschal florent 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.270
 and maxime bouet and finally by 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.340
 sébastien turgot 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.899
 the former double champion of France is 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.910
 taken less than 16 kilometers from 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.470
 the arrival 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:06.600
 no more success for his teammate 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.200
 gautier cyril in the last ten 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.210
 kilometers 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.570
 the Vendée formation must admit 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.570
 defeated 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.189
 my idea today was everything 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.140
 do to avoid to play my card at 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.520
 background knowing that I do not know I have not 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.770
 sprint ways to compete with 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.140
 the best so I had taken the party 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.729
 to please me and to 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.259
 plume and why not with a result 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.490
 in the key but there was no miracle 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.689
 and I want to say in front of the collective 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.209
 beyond the fdj 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.319
 same observation for sylvain chavanel l 

00:01:33.209 --> 00:01:36.569
 attack twice 

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:40.109
 isolated metropcs to resist the train 

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:43.259
 blue take initiatives but 

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:45.810
 it's almost impossible so we 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.909
 do but do not believe it too much but it 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.470
 did not work no no no but happy 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:53.640
 I had fun today I was 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:56.729
 supported by a lot of public 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.739
 and that's it it's very fun 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.539
 the bad luck of julien antomarchi party 

00:01:58.739 --> 00:02:02.670
 alone but fell victim to 

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:04.500
 two kilometers from the finish favors 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.829
 the drawings of the fdj point fr and 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:10.579
 d'arnaud strikes the strongest in the sprint 

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:10.579
 the new champion of France
