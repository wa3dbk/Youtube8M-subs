00:00:01.099 --> 00:00:04.060
 hello my friends, much boots 

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:07.490
 but once here with you bringing one more legal tip 

00:00:08.199 --> 00:00:10.190
 how to identify the components and 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:13.190
 internal memory of your computer without having to open a 

00:00:13.989 --> 00:00:18.439
 with this small but also very efficient program called 111 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.470
 it's a light tool 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:22.349
 free 

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:24.039
 it's very practical 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:27.460
 to know at any time the state of the computer 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:33.219
 today you can get information from the motherboard as the model chip7 

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:34.190
 wine 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:35.390
 velocity 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.110
 memories and parakeet in other states 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:39.650
 he also analyzes 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:40.490
 the type 

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:45.030
 the size and frequency of ram installed and other 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.990
 specifications 

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:50.160
 it does not allow you to perform any function 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.270
 if you do not see the main data of computer items 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:57.120
 each weapon 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.110
 separate fields regarding various internal details of the 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:03.400
 components 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.000
 is the best 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
 that everything is clear in real time 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.670
 so let's see how it works in practice 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:13.560
 this program later 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:14.500
 available 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:20.170
 for download on my site www already saw them tutorials dot com br 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.130
 barradÃ£o other 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.170
 come on 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:25.880
 after downloading 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.890
 click on a program icon 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.890
 in this window click on me to run 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:33.850
 net 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.810
 and who to accept inert 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.040
 net again 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:40.950
 in this 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.230
 those mother of the box were not in this mess 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.659
 select stakes and if you want to leave a shortcut on the desktop 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:52.170
 if it is not your turn to score 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.580
 I'll let you score 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:55.450
 in this 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.920
 He is there 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.590
 with this box selected he executed an order regarding the program 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:03.910
 let's mark 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:06.910
 and finally finish 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.799
 the program is already installed and ready to use 

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:12.490
 double-click it 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:15.490
 and we'll see how it works 

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:20.769
 the first of cttu makes preferential processed 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:26.190
 the first part of this water shows the chelsea has generated past 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:28.749
 with the name 

00:02:28.749 --> 00:02:30.009
 the socket 

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:32.079
 manufacturing technology 

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:33.900
 the profit voltage 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.249
 and the instructions that it is able to perform 

00:02:37.249 --> 00:02:38.649
 the second block 

00:02:38.649 --> 00:02:40.039
 it falls 

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:42.449
 is called crops 

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:45.789
 if frequencies were left that bequeathed the processing speed 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:49.640
 processor core city 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.640
 multiplier and others 

00:02:53.779 --> 00:02:56.109
 in the third called block than this 

00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:59.809
 and indicates the pc's kiaxi memory levels 

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:02.819
 in other words, who are you? 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:05.920
 is a temporary storage area 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.079
 a fall from the frequent minds accessed 

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:12.229
 can be stored for quick later access 

00:03:13.789 --> 00:03:15.909
 it is divided into two levels 

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:16.919
 in rio 

00:03:16.919 --> 00:03:18.609
 it's there 

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:21.609
 it is 3 that some processors 

00:03:23.529 --> 00:03:26.329
 just you can see more in detail 

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:29.329
 the way the memory it is operating 

00:03:31.279 --> 00:03:32.479
 following 

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:37.149
 in this water for me is one of the most important because it's because it's here 

00:03:37.149 --> 00:03:40.689
 has several detailed information about the motherboard 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:43.839
 this information may 

00:03:43.839 --> 00:03:48.799
 be used for example in case of loss of drive installation CD 

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:53.869
 and through this information I can not download through the internet in the details 

00:03:53.869 --> 00:03:57.010
 different from this motherboard. 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:03.849
 in the block is to treat mother we can see the name of the flat 

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:05.489
 the plate model 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:06.789
 the chipset 

00:04:06.789 --> 00:04:09.179
 Pizza 

00:04:09.179 --> 00:04:10.580
 in block b 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:13.329
 we have the brand of bios manufacturer 

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:16.329
 the decision and the date of the tricolor 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:20.039
 in the interface and graphic block 

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:22.990
 no information appears on my computer 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:24.490
 but then your 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:27.490
 it may look like the transfer rate version 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:31.760
 if you are using the gp video card 

00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:35.650
 but I was thinking 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:39.610
 refers to the data of the memory modules in the computer 

00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:44.029
 you see the dissidents as the club was planned as 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.099
 memory type 

00:04:46.099 --> 00:04:48.379
 in my case it is a bird of r2 

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:52.889
 the size being 1020 four megabytes the besser channel 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:58.150
 and below is the data that indicates the times when a memory chip does not 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:58.770
 takes 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:01.949
 to pass some information 

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:05.120
 the unit of measure in these indicators of a colloquy 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:05.889
 that is 

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:07.669
 the number of cycles 

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:10.860
 of the processor needed to perform such task 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:15.389
 in this water detail all the memories in all 

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:18.550
 all others never before the audience 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:20.930
 available on the motherboard 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:22.479
 through this year 

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:23.930
 you can see 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:25.919
 in my case 2 hours 

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:27.740
 the first brazil 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:30.129
 I do not have any room 2 memory 

00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:31.199
 in the second 

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:33.360
 has a ddr2 memory 

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.740
 with the size of 1024 megabytes 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:38.740
 and other manufacturer's serial number information 

00:05:39.529 --> 00:05:43.679
 it is important to remember that depending on your motherboard you can display here 

00:05:43.679 --> 00:05:44.970
 three others 

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:47.970
 with two or more stable memories 

00:05:48.779 --> 00:05:51.899
 and here more detailed information of each memory 

00:05:53.779 --> 00:05:57.129
 in this water brings information about your video card 

00:05:59.289 --> 00:06:02.289
 and lastly wrong information about the program version 

00:06:02.969 --> 00:06:05.569
 how to install cpu vice install 

00:06:05.569 --> 00:06:07.309
 decision 

00:06:07.309 --> 00:06:10.139
 of the Indians we are using 

00:06:10.139 --> 00:06:14.279
 and if we want to save a report with all the information from our accountant 

00:06:14.279 --> 00:06:16.509
 just click the button that exists 

00:06:16.509 --> 00:06:18.110
 or html 

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:19.699
 see example 

00:06:19.699 --> 00:06:23.159
 I'll save a report of my computer information 

00:06:23.159 --> 00:06:26.249
 by clicking on the html button the test 

00:06:26.249 --> 00:06:28.110
 you live there 

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:30.889
 in this window I hide place 

00:06:30.889 --> 00:06:33.889
 I keep 

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:39.659
 the desktop 

00:06:39.659 --> 00:06:41.689
 the station 

00:06:41.689 --> 00:06:44.689
 Come on, I was going to come and see how it went. 

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:48.770
 with all the information on my computer 

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:50.150
 on the processor 

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:52.729
 of the motherboard of memories 

00:06:52.729 --> 00:06:56.210
 of buses and that, of course, 

00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:58.399
 cool huh 

00:06:58.399 --> 00:07:02.419
 is an excellent tool that can be used without fear 

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:06.930
 Good people for today, I just hope I have helped with this request. 

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:09.240
 There is an insight 

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:10.379
 I see the others 

00:07:10.379 --> 00:07:14.499
 videos posted and comments next year a big hug to everyone and even the 

00:07:14.499 --> 00:07:15.249
 next video
