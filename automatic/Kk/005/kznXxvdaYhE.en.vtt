things right here

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.770 
things right here
well<00:01:10.650> knowing<00:01:11.310> how<00:01:11.490> you<00:01:11.549> grow<00:01:11.909> tomatoes<00:01:12.150> I

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
well knowing how you grow tomatoes I

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.780 
well knowing how you grow tomatoes I
think<00:01:13.110> we<00:01:13.229> need<00:01:13.380> to<00:01:13.500> use<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:13.830> big<00:01:14.010> cage<00:01:14.369> and

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
think we need to use the big cage and

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:20.120 
think we need to use the big cage and
stack<00:01:15.150> one<00:01:15.420> on<00:01:15.450> top<00:01:15.600> of<00:01:15.990> it<00:01:16.080> yeah<00:01:16.229> oh<00:01:18.890> there<00:01:19.890> you

we're doing it okay so what we're going
to<00:01:37.619> do<00:01:37.799> just<00:01:38.070> look<00:01:38.759> up<00:01:38.850> under<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.180> base<00:01:39.360> of

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
to do just look up under the base of

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.300 
to do just look up under the base of
this<00:01:39.630> plant<00:01:39.840> and<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.320> leaves<00:01:40.560> there<00:01:40.950> that<00:01:41.220> are

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
this plant and the leaves there that are

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.469 
this plant and the leaves there that are
hanging<00:01:41.549> on<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:41.970> ground

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
hanging on the ground

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.420 
hanging on the ground
that's<00:01:42.990> how<00:01:43.170> you<00:01:43.229> get<00:01:43.409> disease<00:01:43.799> up<00:01:44.040> on<00:01:44.220> it's

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
that's how you get disease up on it's

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.999 
that's how you get disease up on it's
easy<00:01:44.640> for<00:01:44.939> the<00:01:45.110> stuff<00:01:46.110> to<00:01:46.140> go<00:01:46.409> from<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:46.740> soil

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
easy for the stuff to go from the soil

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.490 
easy for the stuff to go from the soil
up<00:01:47.820> onto<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.360> leaf<00:01:48.540> and<00:01:48.780> then<00:01:48.869> into<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.229> plant

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
up onto the leaf and then into the plant

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.620 
up onto the leaf and then into the plant
you<00:01:50.159> end<00:01:50.340> up<00:01:50.490> with<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:50.790> disease<00:01:51.180> and<00:01:51.210> stuff

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
you end up with the disease and stuff

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.569 
you end up with the disease and stuff
the<00:01:52.170> blight<00:01:52.439> and<00:01:52.649> fungal<00:01:53.009> disease<00:01:53.250> and<00:01:53.430> stuff

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
the blight and fungal disease and stuff

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.660 
the blight and fungal disease and stuff
like<00:01:53.790> that<00:01:53.970> so<00:01:54.180> you<00:01:54.240> just<00:01:54.420> cut<00:01:54.600> them<00:01:54.810> off<00:01:55.020> and
