tu-tu-tu-tu-tu-tu<00:01:53.220> which<00:01:53.430> is<00:01:53.549> going<00:01:53.700> to<00:01:53.759> be

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
tu-tu-tu-tu-tu-tu which is going to be

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.370 
tu-tu-tu-tu-tu-tu which is going to be
like<00:01:53.970> a<00:01:54.000> dark<00:01:54.299> gray<00:01:56.689> this<00:01:57.689> color<00:01:57.930> right<00:01:58.140> here

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.480 
like a dark gray this color right here
so<00:01:59.369> my<00:01:59.790> div<00:02:00.530> remember<00:02:01.530> we<00:02:01.680> give<00:02:01.829> the<00:02:02.009> ID<00:02:02.189> of

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
so my div remember we give the ID of

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.999 
so my div remember we give the ID of
wrapper<00:02:02.969> so<00:02:03.689> id<00:02:03.869> equals<00:02:04.909> wrapper<00:02:06.829> let's<00:02:07.829> add

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
wrapper so id equals wrapper let's add

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.219 
wrapper so id equals wrapper let's add
some<00:02:08.190> properties<00:02:08.640> of<00:02:08.759> this<00:02:08.910> now<00:02:09.869> the<00:02:09.929> first

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
some properties of this now the first

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.120 
some properties of this now the first
thing<00:02:10.349> I<00:02:10.470> want<00:02:10.619> to<00:02:10.649> do<00:02:10.800> is<00:02:11.009> give<00:02:11.250> it

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
thing I want to do is give it

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:15.780 
thing I want to do is give it
a<00:02:13.290> background-color<00:02:14.290> of<00:02:14.590> white<00:02:15.160> and<00:02:15.490> that<00:02:15.730> is

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
a background-color of white and that is

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.380 
a background-color of white and that is
just<00:02:16.120> because<00:02:16.590> if<00:02:17.640> we<00:02:18.640> don't<00:02:18.820> we're<00:02:19.120> not<00:02:19.150> going

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
just because if we don't we're not going

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.390 
just because if we don't we're not going
to<00:02:19.450> be<00:02:19.510> able<00:02:19.720> to<00:02:19.810> tell<00:02:20.050> it's<00:02:21.010> just<00:02:21.100> going<00:02:21.340> to

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
to be able to tell it's just going to

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:22.470 
to be able to tell it's just going to
look<00:02:21.460> like<00:02:21.670> it's<00:02:21.820> blending<00:02:22.210> into<00:02:22.360> the

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
look like it's blending into the

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.920 
look like it's blending into the
background<00:02:23.190> so<00:02:24.210> what<00:02:25.210> we're<00:02:25.330> going<00:02:25.420> to<00:02:25.480> do<00:02:25.690> is

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
background so what we're going to do is

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:27.930 
background so what we're going to do is
we're<00:02:26.110> going<00:02:26.260> to<00:02:26.350> say<00:02:26.800> that<00:02:26.980> this<00:02:27.250> is<00:02:27.490> the<00:02:27.670> meet

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
we're going to say that this is the meet

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.660 
we're going to say that this is the meet
of<00:02:28.120> our<00:02:28.390> website<00:02:28.870> this<00:02:29.410> is<00:02:29.590> pretty<00:02:29.800> much<00:02:29.890> the

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
of our website this is pretty much the

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.210 
of our website this is pretty much the
main<00:02:30.910> layout<00:02:31.500> aside<00:02:32.500> from<00:02:32.650> the<00:02:32.800> background

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
main layout aside from the background

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.540 
main layout aside from the background
that<00:02:33.400> everything<00:02:34.060> is<00:02:34.270> contained<00:02:35.200> in<00:02:35.410> so<00:02:36.220> the

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
that everything is contained in so the

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:38.400 
that everything is contained in so the
background<00:02:36.940> is<00:02:37.060> white<00:02:37.090> that's<00:02:37.630> good<00:02:37.840> so<00:02:38.020> far

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
background is white that's good so far

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:41.670 
background is white that's good so far
arm<00:02:39.240> let's<00:02:40.240> go<00:02:40.300> ahead<00:02:40.480> and<00:02:40.900> give<00:02:41.110> it<00:02:41.140> a<00:02:41.380> width

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
arm let's go ahead and give it a width

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.410 
arm let's go ahead and give it a width
of<00:02:43.320> 1024<00:02:44.320> pixels<00:02:45.220> since<00:02:45.670> that'll<00:02:45.910> look<00:02:46.150> pretty

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
of 1024 pixels since that'll look pretty

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.420 
of 1024 pixels since that'll look pretty
good<00:02:46.930> on<00:02:46.990> you<00:02:47.440> know<00:02:47.560> most<00:02:47.860> of<00:02:47.980> the<00:02:48.100> screens

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
good on you know most of the screens

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.840 
good on you know most of the screens
will<00:02:49.030> also<00:02:49.330> give<00:02:49.600> it<00:02:49.750> a<00:02:49.870> margin<00:02:50.200> and<00:02:50.680> we'll<00:02:51.610> put

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850 
will also give it a margin and we'll put

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:55.080 
will also give it a margin and we'll put
five<00:02:52.330> pixels<00:02:53.290> Auto<00:02:53.650> now<00:02:54.520> whenever<00:02:54.790> you<00:02:54.970> do

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
five pixels Auto now whenever you do

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:57.780 
five pixels Auto now whenever you do
this<00:02:55.240> this<00:02:55.510> means<00:02:55.750> the<00:02:56.230> margin<00:02:56.710> of<00:02:56.830> the<00:02:57.550> top

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
this this means the margin of the top

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.270 
this this means the margin of the top
and<00:02:58.000> bottom<00:02:58.120> is<00:02:58.540> five<00:02:59.020> pixels<00:02:59.410> so<00:02:59.650> five<00:02:59.860> pixels

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
and bottom is five pixels so five pixels

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.220 
and bottom is five pixels so five pixels
from<00:03:00.340> top<00:03:00.430> and<00:03:00.880> bottom<00:03:01.150> so<00:03:01.660> it<00:03:01.870> isn't<00:03:02.170> like

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
from top and bottom so it isn't like

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.050 
from top and bottom so it isn't like
very<00:03:02.770> butted<00:03:03.160> up<00:03:03.250> against<00:03:03.520> the<00:03:03.610> top<00:03:03.790> it<00:03:04.030> looks

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
very butted up against the top it looks

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.870 
very butted up against the top it looks
kind<00:03:04.330> of<00:03:04.360> weird<00:03:04.570> that<00:03:04.690> way<00:03:04.810> and<00:03:04.990> Auto<00:03:05.650> means

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
kind of weird that way and Auto means

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.600 
kind of weird that way and Auto means
adjust<00:03:07.780> it<00:03:07.960> so<00:03:08.650> it<00:03:08.680> gives<00:03:08.950> you<00:03:09.100> an<00:03:09.310> automatic

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:09.610 
adjust it so it gives you an automatic

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:11.340 
adjust it so it gives you an automatic
value<00:03:10.150> for<00:03:10.360> the<00:03:10.450> left<00:03:10.690> and<00:03:10.840> a<00:03:10.900> right<00:03:10.930> and<00:03:11.080> what

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.350 
value for the left and a right and what

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:13.710 
value for the left and a right and what
this<00:03:11.500> essentially<00:03:12.040> does<00:03:12.340> is<00:03:12.520> it<00:03:13.000> centers<00:03:13.480> it

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
this essentially does is it centers it

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.450 
this essentially does is it centers it
right<00:03:14.470> in<00:03:14.590> the<00:03:14.680> middle<00:03:14.830> of<00:03:14.950> your<00:03:15.100> webpage

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:15.460 
right in the middle of your webpage

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:18.360 
right in the middle of your webpage
because<00:03:15.880> for<00:03:16.450> some<00:03:16.600> reason<00:03:17.160> whoever<00:03:18.160> is

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
because for some reason whoever is

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.780 
because for some reason whoever is
making<00:03:18.790> the<00:03:19.060> CSS<00:03:19.630> the<00:03:19.900> rules<00:03:20.470> for<00:03:20.740> in<00:03:21.040> html5

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
making the CSS the rules for in html5

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.090 
making the CSS the rules for in html5
they<00:03:22.270> made<00:03:22.480> it<00:03:22.600> really<00:03:22.840> hard<00:03:23.200> to<00:03:23.350> Center<00:03:23.740> stuff

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:24.100 
they made it really hard to Center stuff

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:25.920 
they made it really hard to Center stuff
and<00:03:24.370> I<00:03:24.910> don't<00:03:25.210> know<00:03:25.300> so<00:03:25.450> this<00:03:25.570> is<00:03:25.630> how<00:03:25.870> you

so<00:03:50.170> look<00:03:50.350> at<00:03:50.470> this<00:03:50.560> border<00:03:50.950> right<00:03:51.100> here<00:03:51.870> when

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870 
so look at this border right here when

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:54.720 
so look at this border right here when
your<00:03:53.050> screen<00:03:53.320> is<00:03:53.500> big<00:03:53.680> enough<00:03:53.890> it<00:03:54.160> looks<00:03:54.220> great

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:54.730 
your screen is big enough it looks great

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:57.360 
your screen is big enough it looks great
but<00:03:55.180> once<00:03:55.360> you<00:03:55.480> start<00:03:55.660> shrinking<00:03:55.990> it<00:03:56.370> your

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370 
but once you start shrinking it your

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:59.490 
but once you start shrinking it your
crap<00:03:57.730> starts<00:03:58.150> getting<00:03:58.390> cut<00:03:58.630> off<00:03:58.660> right<00:03:59.170> here

00:03:59.490 --> 00:03:59.500 
crap starts getting cut off right here

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.030 
crap starts getting cut off right here
so<00:03:59.950> the<00:04:00.459> website<00:04:00.820> actually<00:04:01.120> goes<00:04:01.410> to<00:04:02.410> like<00:04:02.860> out

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.040 
so the website actually goes to like out

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:06.420 
so the website actually goes to like out
here<00:04:03.930> but<00:04:04.930> since<00:04:05.110> we're<00:04:05.350> using<00:04:05.380> pixels<00:04:06.190> in

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:06.430 
here but since we're using pixels in

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:08.280 
here but since we're using pixels in
this<00:04:06.550> old<00:04:06.820> cool<00:04:07.150> or<00:04:07.420> excuse<00:04:07.930> me<00:04:07.990> this

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.290 
this old cool or excuse me this

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:10.590 
this old cool or excuse me this
old-school<00:04:08.620> crap<00:04:09.220> it's<00:04:10.000> giving<00:04:10.209> us<00:04:10.300> a<00:04:10.390> bunch

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:10.600 
old-school crap it's giving us a bunch

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:12.840 
old-school crap it's giving us a bunch
of<00:04:10.690> problems<00:04:11.040> so<00:04:12.040> what<00:04:12.190> I<00:04:12.220> want<00:04:12.580> to<00:04:12.670> actually

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:12.850 
of problems so what I want to actually

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:15.270 
of problems so what I want to actually
I'm<00:04:13.209> not<00:04:13.360> even<00:04:13.660> gonna<00:04:13.780> I'll<00:04:14.290> comment<00:04:14.740> this<00:04:14.890> out

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:15.280 
I'm not even gonna I'll comment this out

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:18.780 
I'm not even gonna I'll comment this out
I<00:04:15.490> won't<00:04:15.790> completely<00:04:16.270> delete<00:04:16.780> it<00:04:16.930> so<00:04:17.790> this

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:18.790 
I won't completely delete it so this

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:19.800 
I won't completely delete it so this
will<00:04:18.940> show<00:04:19.090> you<00:04:19.150> guys<00:04:19.330> the<00:04:19.450> difference

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:19.810 
will show you guys the difference

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:23.130 
will show you guys the difference
between<00:04:20.020> a<00:04:20.560> good<00:04:21.600> responsive<00:04:22.600> layout<00:04:22.900> or

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:23.140 
between a good responsive layout or

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:25.110 
between a good responsive layout or
responsive<00:04:23.590> web<00:04:23.710> design<00:04:23.740> and<00:04:24.160> a<00:04:24.220> bad<00:04:24.400> one

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 
responsive web design and a bad one

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.350 
responsive web design and a bad one
so<00:04:25.930> first<00:04:26.169> of<00:04:26.320> all<00:04:26.380> like<00:04:27.340> I<00:04:27.490> said<00:04:27.520> whenever<00:04:28.210> you

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:28.360 
so first of all like I said whenever you

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.320 
so first of all like I said whenever you
see<00:04:28.600> pixels<00:04:29.290> it<00:04:29.650> means<00:04:29.889> okay<00:04:30.340> I<00:04:30.550> did<00:04:30.940> something

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.330 
see pixels it means okay I did something

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.110 
see pixels it means okay I did something
wrong<00:04:31.620> so<00:04:32.620> let's<00:04:32.830> copy<00:04:33.010> this<00:04:33.280> and<00:04:33.490> transition

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:34.120 
wrong so let's copy this and transition

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.420 
wrong so let's copy this and transition
it<00:04:34.240> all<00:04:34.419> over<00:04:34.930> to<00:04:35.500> something<00:04:35.919> other<00:04:36.190> than

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:36.430 
it all over to something other than

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:40.110 
it all over to something other than
pixels<00:04:36.900> now<00:04:37.900> instead<00:04:38.590> of<00:04:38.650> a<00:04:38.800> width<00:04:39.070> a<00:04:39.340> fixed

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:40.120 
pixels now instead of a width a fixed

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.900 
pixels now instead of a width a fixed
width<00:04:40.389> a<00:04:40.690> fixed<00:04:41.440> width<00:04:41.620> means<00:04:42.190> no<00:04:42.460> matter<00:04:42.639> how

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:42.910 
width a fixed width means no matter how

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:45.240 
width a fixed width means no matter how
small<00:04:43.210> or<00:04:43.449> how<00:04:43.750> big<00:04:43.780> your<00:04:44.229> window<00:04:44.530> is<00:04:44.710> it's

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:45.250 
small or how big your window is it's

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:47.070 
small or how big your window is it's
going<00:04:45.400> to<00:04:45.460> be<00:04:45.580> the<00:04:45.729> same<00:04:46.030> amount<00:04:46.240> of<00:04:46.510> pixels<00:04:46.780> no

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:47.080 
going to be the same amount of pixels no

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:49.020 
going to be the same amount of pixels no
matter<00:04:47.260> what<00:04:47.530> well<00:04:48.130> we<00:04:48.280> don't<00:04:48.430> want<00:04:48.699> anything

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.030 
matter what well we don't want anything

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:51.750 
matter what well we don't want anything
cemented<00:04:49.900> in<00:04:50.050> there<00:04:50.380> we<00:04:50.830> want<00:04:51.040> this<00:04:51.190> flexible

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:51.760 
cemented in there we want this flexible

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:53.520 
cemented in there we want this flexible
because<00:04:52.210> that's<00:04:52.360> what<00:04:52.540> we're<00:04:52.690> learning<00:04:52.810> so

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:53.530 
because that's what we're learning so

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:55.350 
because that's what we're learning so
what<00:04:53.800> you<00:04:53.919> can<00:04:54.070> do<00:04:54.220> instead<00:04:54.400> is<00:04:54.880> you<00:04:55.210> can

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:55.360 
what you can do instead is you can

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:58.050 
what you can do instead is you can
actually<00:04:55.540> give<00:04:55.900> it<00:04:56.050> a<00:04:56.229> percentage<00:04:57.220> now<00:04:57.910> what

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:58.060 
actually give it a percentage now what

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:59.430 
actually give it a percentage now what
this<00:04:58.150> is<00:04:58.210> going<00:04:58.389> to<00:04:58.570> do<00:04:58.720> is<00:04:58.870> it's<00:04:59.110> going<00:04:59.139> to<00:04:59.260> say

00:04:59.430 --> 00:04:59.440 
this is going to do is it's going to say

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:02.580 
this is going to do is it's going to say
no<00:05:00.130> matter<00:05:00.250> how<00:05:00.610> big<00:05:00.940> my<00:05:01.240> window<00:05:01.570> is<00:05:01.750> always

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:02.590 
no matter how big my window is always

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:05.040 
no matter how big my window is always
make<00:05:02.860> this<00:05:03.070> inner<00:05:03.340> object<00:05:03.850> this<00:05:04.540> white<00:05:04.810> thing

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:05.050 
make this inner object this white thing

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:07.680 
make this inner object this white thing
right<00:05:05.200> here<00:05:05.470> ninety<00:05:06.220> percent<00:05:06.490> of<00:05:06.760> it<00:05:06.910> so<00:05:07.510> if

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:07.690 
right here ninety percent of it so if

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:11.010 
right here ninety percent of it so if
it's<00:05:08.010> two<00:05:09.010> thousand<00:05:09.430> pixels<00:05:09.750> it's<00:05:10.750> going<00:05:10.960> to

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:11.020 
it's two thousand pixels it's going to

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:13.500 
it's two thousand pixels it's going to
be<00:05:11.229> eighteen<00:05:12.100> hundred<00:05:12.430> if<00:05:12.639> it's<00:05:12.880> one<00:05:13.389> hundred

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:13.510 
be eighteen hundred if it's one hundred

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:15.600 
be eighteen hundred if it's one hundred
pixels<00:05:13.870> it's<00:05:14.229> going<00:05:14.350> to<00:05:14.410> be<00:05:14.470> 90<00:05:14.680> pixels<00:05:14.979> it's

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:15.610 
pixels it's going to be 90 pixels it's

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:17.610 
pixels it's going to be 90 pixels it's
always<00:05:16.030> going<00:05:16.240> to<00:05:16.270> adapt<00:05:16.660> to<00:05:16.900> the<00:05:17.020> size<00:05:17.289> of

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:17.620 
always going to adapt to the size of

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:19.500 
always going to adapt to the size of
your<00:05:17.710> screen<00:05:18.130> so<00:05:18.850> this<00:05:19.030> way<00:05:19.210> it<00:05:19.360> actually

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:19.510 
your screen so this way it actually

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:23.939 
your screen so this way it actually
flexes<00:05:21.120> limitless<00:05:22.120> it's<00:05:22.330> very<00:05:22.690> cool<00:05:22.960> so<00:05:23.680> the

00:05:23.939 --> 00:05:23.949 
flexes limitless it's very cool so the

00:05:23.949 --> 00:05:26.580 
flexes limitless it's very cool so the
margin<00:05:24.490> of<00:05:24.660> course<00:05:25.660> this<00:05:25.840> is<00:05:25.960> bad<00:05:26.139> too<00:05:26.380> because

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:26.590 
margin of course this is bad too because

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:29.190 
margin of course this is bad too because
I<00:05:26.979> don't<00:05:27.340> know<00:05:27.400> is<00:05:27.610> five<00:05:28.180> pixels<00:05:28.630> like<00:05:28.840> one

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:29.200 
I don't know is five pixels like one

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:31.140 
I don't know is five pixels like one
inch<00:05:29.410> on<00:05:29.650> some<00:05:29.889> screens<00:05:30.190> is<00:05:30.400> five<00:05:30.580> pixels<00:05:30.910> like

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:31.150 
inch on some screens is five pixels like

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:32.879 
inch on some screens is five pixels like
ten<00:05:31.419> inches<00:05:31.750> on<00:05:32.080> other<00:05:32.260> screens

00:05:32.879 --> 00:05:32.889 
ten inches on other screens

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:35.310 
ten inches on other screens
maybe<00:05:33.370> maybe<00:05:33.910> five<00:05:34.210> pixels<00:05:34.660> is<00:05:34.750> way<00:05:34.930> too<00:05:34.990> much

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:35.320 
maybe maybe five pixels is way too much

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:37.770 
maybe maybe five pixels is way too much
on<00:05:35.530> a<00:05:35.560> phone<00:05:35.830> so<00:05:36.580> instead<00:05:36.970> what<00:05:37.240> we<00:05:37.389> want<00:05:37.419> to<00:05:37.690> do

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:37.780 
on a phone so instead what we want to do

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:39.420 
on a phone so instead what we want to do
is<00:05:38.020> we<00:05:38.169> want<00:05:38.380> to<00:05:38.470> use<00:05:38.530> those<00:05:38.800> things<00:05:39.100> called

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:39.430 
is we want to use those things called

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:42.930 
is we want to use those things called
EMS<00:05:39.960> so<00:05:40.960> if<00:05:41.380> you<00:05:42.010> use<00:05:42.160> something<00:05:42.190> like<00:05:42.490> point

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:42.940 
EMS so if you use something like point

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:47.460 
EMS so if you use something like point
four<00:05:44.880> e/m<00:05:45.910> what<00:05:46.570> it's<00:05:46.690> going<00:05:46.900> to<00:05:46.960> do<00:05:47.080> is<00:05:47.289> it's

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:47.470 
four e/m what it's going to do is it's

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:50.310 
four e/m what it's going to do is it's
going<00:05:47.560> to<00:05:47.740> go<00:05:47.979> grab<00:05:48.849> the<00:05:49.330> default<00:05:49.810> font<00:05:49.990> size

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:50.320 
going to go grab the default font size

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:52.740 
going to go grab the default font size
for<00:05:50.919> whatever<00:05:51.220> device<00:05:51.610> you're<00:05:51.760> on<00:05:51.820> and<00:05:52.270> it's

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:52.750 
for whatever device you're on and it's

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:54.570 
for whatever device you're on and it's
going<00:05:52.870> to<00:05:52.960> adjust<00:05:53.139> the<00:05:53.710> margin<00:05:54.160> to<00:05:54.310> that

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:54.580 
going to adjust the margin to that

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:56.850 
going to adjust the margin to that
appropriately<00:05:55.300> so<00:05:56.020> it's<00:05:56.320> going<00:05:56.410> to<00:05:56.470> be<00:05:56.620> more

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:56.860 
appropriately so it's going to be more

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:58.950 
appropriately so it's going to be more
consistent<00:05:57.430> viewing<00:05:58.150> experience<00:05:58.750> no<00:05:58.900> matter

consistent viewing experience no matter
how<00:05:59.260> big<00:05:59.440> your<00:05:59.560> screen<00:05:59.620> size<00:06:00.039> is<00:06:00.310> so<00:06:01.180> of<00:06:01.479> course

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:02.340 
how big your screen size is so of course

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:05.900 
how big your screen size is so of course
you're<00:06:03.340> going<00:06:03.460> to<00:06:03.520> want<00:06:03.610> to<00:06:03.849> adjust<00:06:03.940> this

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:05.910 
you're going to want to adjust this

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:08.760 
you're going to want to adjust this
based<00:06:06.910> on<00:06:07.060> how<00:06:07.240> everything<00:06:07.570> looks<00:06:07.900> but<00:06:08.650> this

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:08.770 
based on how everything looks but this

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:10.290 
based on how everything looks but this
is<00:06:08.950> the<00:06:09.099> basics<00:06:09.490> of<00:06:09.610> how<00:06:09.669> you<00:06:09.820> make<00:06:10.090> an

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:10.300 
is the basics of how you make an

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:13.080 
is the basics of how you make an
adaptive<00:06:10.960> flexible<00:06:11.680> layout<00:06:11.979> so<00:06:12.789> check<00:06:12.970> this

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:13.090 
adaptive flexible layout so check this

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:16.290 
adaptive flexible layout so check this
out<00:06:13.240> now<00:06:13.979> so<00:06:14.979> even<00:06:15.310> though<00:06:15.430> the<00:06:15.610> sizes<00:06:16.000> didn't

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:16.300 
out now so even though the sizes didn't

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:18.029 
out now so even though the sizes didn't
match<00:06:16.450> up<00:06:16.660> exactly<00:06:16.810> and<00:06:17.289> if<00:06:17.349> we<00:06:17.470> wanted<00:06:17.740> to<00:06:17.800> we

00:06:18.029 --> 00:06:18.039 
match up exactly and if we wanted to we

00:06:18.039 --> 00:06:19.980 
match up exactly and if we wanted to we
can<00:06:18.160> break<00:06:18.310> okay<00:06:18.669> 85<00:06:19.270> and<00:06:19.570> figure<00:06:19.810> all<00:06:19.960> that

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:19.990 
can break okay 85 and figure all that

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:21.540 
can break okay 85 and figure all that
out<00:06:20.169> but<00:06:20.710> I<00:06:20.740> just<00:06:20.919> want<00:06:21.099> to<00:06:21.160> show<00:06:21.250> you<00:06:21.310> guys<00:06:21.370> the

out but I just want to show you guys the

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:24.029 
out but I just want to show you guys the
basics<00:06:21.910> right<00:06:22.060> now<00:06:22.270> so<00:06:23.200> right<00:06:23.380> now<00:06:23.440> check<00:06:23.919> this

00:06:24.029 --> 00:06:24.039 
basics right now so right now check this

00:06:24.039 --> 00:06:28.260 
basics right now so right now check this
out<00:06:24.510> before<00:06:25.680> we<00:06:26.680> would<00:06:26.830> start<00:06:27.099> the<00:06:27.190> gate<00:06:27.370> cut

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:28.270 
out before we would start the gate cut

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:30.750 
out before we would start the gate cut
off<00:06:28.389> right<00:06:28.660> around<00:06:28.900> here<00:06:29.289> but<00:06:30.280> since<00:06:30.460> we<00:06:30.610> have

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:30.760 
off right around here but since we have

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:33.529 
off right around here but since we have
ninety<00:06:31.180> percent<00:06:31.360> no<00:06:32.110> matter<00:06:32.169> how<00:06:32.590> small<00:06:32.979> or

different devices to show you guys I

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:54.140 
different devices to show you guys I
just<00:06:51.520> have<00:06:51.760> my<00:06:51.880> browser<00:06:52.180> right<00:06:52.480> now<00:06:52.710> this

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:54.150 
just have my browser right now this

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:58.980 
just have my browser right now this
border<00:06:55.150> right<00:06:55.390> here<00:06:56.490> is<00:06:57.490> 0.4<00:06:58.210> a.m.<00:06:58.510> so<00:06:58.780> what

00:06:58.980 --> 00:06:58.990 
border right here is 0.4 a.m. so what

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:01.620 
border right here is 0.4 a.m. so what
that<00:06:59.110> does<00:06:59.350> like<00:06:59.770> I<00:06:59.920> said<00:07:00.130> is<00:07:00.310> it<00:07:00.700> grabs<00:07:01.060> the

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:01.630 
that does like I said is it grabs the

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:05.070 
that does like I said is it grabs the
default<00:07:02.080> font<00:07:02.290> size<00:07:02.590> and<00:07:02.920> the<00:07:03.460> border<00:07:03.880> is<00:07:04.080> 0.4

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:05.080 
default font size and the border is 0.4

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:09.270 
default font size and the border is 0.4
or<00:07:05.380> 40%<00:07:06.100> of<00:07:06.790> that<00:07:07.450> font<00:07:07.720> right<00:07:07.990> there<00:07:08.260> so<00:07:09.010> later

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:09.280 
or 40% of that font right there so later

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:11.160 
or 40% of that font right there so later
on<00:07:09.400> once<00:07:10.270> I<00:07:10.390> show<00:07:10.540> you<00:07:10.630> guys<00:07:10.780> how<00:07:11.020> to<00:07:11.050> make

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:11.170 
on once I show you guys how to make

00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:14.220 
on once I show you guys how to make
different<00:07:11.590> font<00:07:12.520> sizes<00:07:12.730> depending<00:07:13.090> on<00:07:13.600> your

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:14.230 
different font sizes depending on your

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:16.860 
different font sizes depending on your
device<00:07:14.470> the<00:07:15.400> border<00:07:15.850> is<00:07:16.000> going<00:07:16.120> to<00:07:16.270> shrink<00:07:16.630> and

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:16.870 
device the border is going to shrink and

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:21.180 
device the border is going to shrink and
grow<00:07:17.110> accordingly<00:07:18.070> so<00:07:18.910> this<00:07:19.360> is<00:07:19.660> a<00:07:20.350> lot<00:07:20.860> better

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:21.190 
grow accordingly so this is a lot better

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:23.430 
grow accordingly so this is a lot better
and<00:07:21.550> a<00:07:21.880> lot<00:07:22.030> more<00:07:22.060> adaptable<00:07:22.690> for<00:07:23.020> every

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:23.440 
and a lot more adaptable for every

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:25.800 
and a lot more adaptable for every
single<00:07:23.650> device<00:07:23.830> than<00:07:24.640> this<00:07:25.210> crap<00:07:25.570> right<00:07:25.600> here

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:25.810 
single device than this crap right here

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:28.500 
single device than this crap right here
