00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.480
 The b1 500 air ttl and the air remote ttl are high performance 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:10.260
 Type A is unprecedented tl 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:15.360
 Such a camera would support the feature where the te function is mainly 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:17.460
 Cognate yi support and control See with 500 b1 Sat Petit Tel encountered localized 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.699
 Support functions and I'm consists 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:24.449
 Yesterday ttl this sense language 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.730
 At this time, the dog is only two days away from meeting the distant Canon camera 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:30.599
 I have. 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:34.980
 All of the cameras are set up in such a way that things like speed, intensity , shutter speed etc. 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:39.600
 Such that the transfer to automatically identify and control the direction set to one trillion people 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:41.100
 Because of the way that users are enrolled adjuster fairly easy access to people 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.309
 It will be a big feature 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:48.149
 The catch tag type is common in 10 of the basic aviation speedlight 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:51.989
 From this high-performance Although the inability to write word line 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:56.850
 It is quite difficult to see such a function, so it is quite convenient shooting 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:59.280
 Possible and of course the water folding boiler is a general form of using two passive 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:03.629
 We will of course also support 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:08.369
 Pro puts a glimpse into the 500l detail and el 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:12.299
 Uh these common sheets as well as practically when using lighting 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:17.520
 This might be a hunch, but when using the umbrella or bounce the vehicle 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:21.710
 Overcoming the phenomenon of insufficient light intensity due to differences in angles at the time 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:27.450
 For the p1 500 and air ttl, 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:31.650
 Continuously communicate with multiple states to be set to the view angle and direction 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:33.689
 It is also possible to recognize that even those who are 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:39.210
 I'll be pretty strong . 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:42.120
 Let's take a closer look at the world . 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:45.810
 3.3 out of the workplace 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:50.640
 In this state we have provided luminescence reduction 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:55.980
 You should be able to shoot a stronger light source than the mouse you were using. 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:58.020
 It will automatically go to b1 500 now and automatically when you change the angle 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:02.190
 Because we can change the setting this year 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:05.970
 Uh dozen or so shots taken Umbrella is also quite easy to shoot plaque 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:10.740
 It will be a big advantage to be able to read it and follow it 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:13.920
 When you get back to power, you do not need to make any other settings. 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:18.330
 If you press the function so that the set automatically 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:22.880
 Support the orientation and the ability to satisfy the discourse of ct and versatility 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.880
 The point is very clear.
