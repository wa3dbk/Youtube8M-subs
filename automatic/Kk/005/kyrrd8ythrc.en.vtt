too<00:02:02.009> deep<00:02:02.659> so<00:02:03.659> BRB<00:02:04.350> and<00:02:05.840> here<00:02:06.840> we<00:02:07.020> have<00:02:07.049> our

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
too deep so BRB and here we have our

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.009 
too deep so BRB and here we have our
whole<00:02:08.030> like<00:02:09.030> last<00:02:09.300> time<00:02:09.420> we're<00:02:09.660> going<00:02:09.750> to<00:02:09.810> use

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:10.019 
whole like last time we're going to use

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:11.449 
whole like last time we're going to use
these<00:02:10.229> Pistons<00:02:10.679> here<00:02:10.800> as<00:02:10.890> a<00:02:10.920> starting<00:02:11.250> point

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
these Pistons here as a starting point

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.790 
these Pistons here as a starting point
so<00:02:11.819> place<00:02:12.330> two<00:02:12.599> more<00:02:12.720> Pistons<00:02:13.140> one<00:02:13.349> on<00:02:13.500> top<00:02:13.650> of

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
so place two more Pistons one on top of

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.059 
so place two more Pistons one on top of
each<00:02:14.120> place<00:02:15.140> blocks<00:02:16.140> right<00:02:16.500> in<00:02:16.620> front<00:02:16.830> of<00:02:16.920> them

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
each place blocks right in front of them

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:19.820 
each place blocks right in front of them
like<00:02:17.099> that<00:02:17.690> went<00:02:18.690> away<00:02:18.750> from<00:02:18.989> this<00:02:19.110> side<00:02:19.380> block

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
like that went away from this side block

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.350 
like that went away from this side block
one<00:02:20.190> away<00:02:20.310> from<00:02:20.519> this<00:02:20.670> side<00:02:20.940> block<00:02:21.440> play<00:02:22.440> some

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
one away from this side block play some

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.820 
one away from this side block play some
Pistons<00:02:24.360> right<00:02:24.750> on<00:02:24.900> top<00:02:25.110> facing<00:02:25.410> each<00:02:25.709> other

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
Pistons right on top facing each other

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.740 
Pistons right on top facing each other
like<00:02:26.610> so<00:02:27.060> and<00:02:27.890> now<00:02:28.890> what<00:02:29.100> we're<00:02:29.220> going<00:02:29.310> to<00:02:29.400> do

like so and now what we're going to do

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.210 
like so and now what we're going to do
starting<00:02:30.750> from<00:02:30.989> this<00:02:31.110> block<00:02:31.350> dig<00:02:32.069> a<00:02:32.100> little

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
starting from this block dig a little

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.740 
starting from this block dig a little
trench<00:02:33.290> it's<00:02:34.290> like<00:02:34.440> that<00:02:34.590> ok<00:02:35.519> and<00:02:35.790> then<00:02:35.850> dig

repeater going this way no delay and

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.310 
repeater going this way no delay and
this<00:03:14.190> is<00:03:14.549> going<00:03:14.790> to<00:03:14.880> power<00:03:15.269> this<00:03:15.630> block<00:03:15.989> which

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
this is going to power this block which

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:20.120 
this is going to power this block which
will<00:03:16.530> power<00:03:16.799> the<00:03:17.310> line<00:03:18.120> here<00:03:18.660> ok<00:03:19.410> and<00:03:19.769> that's

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
will power the line here ok and that's

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.250 
will power the line here ok and that's
going<00:03:20.280> to<00:03:20.340> go<00:03:20.519> into<00:03:20.700> the<00:03:20.970> double<00:03:21.329> piston

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
going to go into the double piston

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.309 
going to go into the double piston
extender<00:03:22.530> part<00:03:23.100> which<00:03:23.730> I<00:03:24.390> don't<00:03:24.810> have<00:03:24.959> a<00:03:24.989> block

ok and what we're going to do is we're
gonna<00:03:50.459> place<00:03:50.639> the<00:03:50.790> piston<00:03:51.829> facing<00:03:52.829> this<00:03:53.760> way

00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:54.739 
gonna place the piston facing this way

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:56.720 
gonna place the piston facing this way
with<00:03:55.739> a<00:03:55.769> block<00:03:56.010> right<00:03:56.190> next<00:03:56.400> to<00:03:56.489> it<00:03:56.549> in<00:03:56.700> the

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
with a block right next to it in the

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.870 
with a block right next to it in the
torch<00:03:57.120> on<00:03:57.299> top<00:03:57.540> and<00:03:58.160> also<00:03:59.160> when<00:03:59.579> the<00:03:59.609> stick

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880 
torch on top and also when the stick

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.540 
torch on top and also when the stick
this<00:04:00.000> out<00:04:00.260> dig<00:04:01.260> it<00:04:01.380> out<00:04:01.470> date<00:04:01.739> out

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:02.550 
this out dig it out date out

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:04.790 
this out dig it out date out
a<00:04:02.610> repeater<00:04:03.540> leading<00:04:04.080> right<00:04:04.260> into<00:04:04.290> that<00:04:04.530> block

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:04.800 
a repeater leading right into that block

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:09.860 
a repeater leading right into that block
set<00:04:05.070> to<00:04:05.190> to<00:04:05.750> torch<00:04:06.750> right<00:04:06.960> here<00:04:08.000> dust<00:04:09.000> right

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
set to to torch right here dust right

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:14.870 
set to to torch right here dust right
into<00:04:10.110> that<00:04:10.230> ok<00:04:11.060> so<00:04:12.060> I<00:04:12.510> believe<00:04:13.370> that<00:04:14.370> is<00:04:14.610> it<00:04:14.850> for

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880 
into that ok so I believe that is it for

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:20.360 
into that ok so I believe that is it for
our<00:04:15.620> falling<00:04:16.620> edge<00:04:16.799> part<00:04:18.080> yeah<00:04:19.080> ok<00:04:19.620> so<00:04:20.130> now<00:04:20.310> we

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
our falling edge part yeah ok so now we

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:23.660 
our falling edge part yeah ok so now we
can<00:04:20.700> start<00:04:21.030> let's<00:04:21.860> skip<00:04:22.860> these<00:04:23.010> blocks<00:04:23.430> right

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:23.670 
can start let's skip these blocks right

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:25.940 
can start let's skip these blocks right
now<00:04:23.880> so<00:04:24.210> I<00:04:24.480> don't<00:04:25.170> have<00:04:25.320> to<00:04:25.410> worry<00:04:25.680> about<00:04:25.770> them

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:25.950 
now so I don't have to worry about them

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:28.030

00:06:32.529 --> 00:06:32.539 
case it you know goes all crazy if

00:06:32.539 --> 00:06:35.959 
case it you know goes all crazy if
however<00:06:34.039> one<00:06:35.039> goes<00:06:35.250> off<00:06:35.490> you're<00:06:35.639> not<00:06:35.789> going<00:06:35.909> to

00:06:35.959 --> 00:06:35.969 
however one goes off you're not going to

00:06:35.969 --> 00:06:37.899 
however one goes off you're not going to
be<00:06:36.030> able<00:06:36.060> to<00:06:36.240> fix<00:06:36.389> it<00:06:36.539> the<00:06:36.689> same<00:06:36.900> way<00:06:37.110> because

00:06:37.899 --> 00:06:37.909 
be able to fix it the same way because

00:06:37.909 --> 00:06:40.159 
be able to fix it the same way because
they<00:06:38.909> affect<00:06:39.300> each<00:06:39.449> other<00:06:39.599> so<00:06:39.900> they'll<00:06:40.050> just

00:06:40.159 --> 00:06:40.169 
they affect each other so they'll just

00:06:40.169 --> 00:06:43.670 
they affect each other so they'll just
alternate<00:06:40.710> between<00:06:41.550> the<00:06:41.909> two<00:06:42.120> so<00:06:42.659> when<00:06:43.259> what

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:43.680 
alternate between the two so when what
