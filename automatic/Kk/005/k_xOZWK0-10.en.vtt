00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.470
 noticed that you were talking about money 

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:31.419

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:33.610

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:35.200

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.180

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:40.450
 outlet that they said wow this on 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.830

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:43.720
 we will take away but this would be 

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:45.760
 scared it would trigger the explosive 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:48.100
 killing himself obviously nothing 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.780

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:53.110
 a bare cell and has been done 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:55.870
 eat alive from 120 hungry dogs but if 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:58.000
 you make me eat from 34 capers 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:00.130
 rather than being torn to pieces by 120 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.160
 dogs the thing is a bullshit it was 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:06.640
 invented by a king sodality partnership 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:08.130
 shoot it with a gun drawn from the 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.360
 own vagina 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.770
 Gospels was also making the gesture 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.420
 to pull out the gun but really 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:15.940
 no one really wants it 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:18.070
 imagine this moment and some of 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:20.140
 you said but web duff shooter like 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:22.060
 you're never talking about such bad things 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.430
 for various reasons, basically because 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.080
 one negative things happen and 2 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:27.460
 bad things happen 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.070
 a boy talks about all the newspapers 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.510
 British today than after having given in to 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.940
 consumption of drugs that I didn't even know

 precisely myo miao existed 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:37.659

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:40.060
 that anyone would have done or a knife 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:42.100

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:47.640
 unpleasant for other reasons or the 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:50.770
 fact that makes homosexual propaganda 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:53.260
