trying to make looks like and then we go
into<00:00:33.809> a<00:00:33.930> new<00:00:34.020> version<00:00:34.380> a<00:00:34.980> new<00:00:35.309> map<00:00:35.670> and<00:00:35.910> create

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
into a new version a new map and create

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.619 
into a new version a new map and create
it<00:00:36.899> and<00:00:37.140> show<00:00:37.920> you<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.399> process<00:00:38.879> of<00:00:39.329> it<00:00:39.450> being

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
it and show you the process of it being

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.740 
it and show you the process of it being
made<00:00:39.870> so<00:00:40.230> you<00:00:40.320> can<00:00:40.500> see<00:00:41.059> how<00:00:42.059> it's<00:00:42.270> made<00:00:42.420> and

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
made so you can see how it's made and

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.060 
made so you can see how it's made and
all<00:00:42.960> that<00:00:45.289> so<00:00:46.289> yeah<00:00:46.440> we're<00:00:46.620> gonna<00:00:46.680> start<00:00:47.010> with

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
all that so yeah we're gonna start with

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.880 
all that so yeah we're gonna start with
the<00:00:47.160> cell<00:00:47.399> blocks<00:00:47.670> here<00:00:47.940> and<00:00:48.170> yeah<00:00:49.170> I've

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
the cell blocks here and yeah I've

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.180 
the cell blocks here and yeah I've
actually<00:00:49.950> got<00:00:50.489> a<00:00:50.520> different<00:00:51.739> cell<00:00:52.739> block<00:00:52.980> that

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
actually got a different cell block that

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.430 
actually got a different cell block that
I<00:00:53.250> think<00:00:53.550> looks<00:00:53.730> a<00:00:53.969> little<00:00:54.120> bit<00:00:54.329> nicer<00:00:54.719> but<00:00:55.140> I

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
I think looks a little bit nicer but I

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.470 
I think looks a little bit nicer but I
uploaded<00:00:56.250> this<00:00:56.430> map<00:00:56.699> so<00:00:56.969> I'll<00:00:57.059> just<00:00:57.210> go<00:00:57.360> with

time<00:02:08.459> so<00:02:08.670> why<00:02:08.789> not<00:02:08.970> have<00:02:09.179> them<00:02:09.360> just<00:02:09.629> open<00:02:10.050> one

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
time so why not have them just open one

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:10.900 
time so why not have them just open one
time

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910

really undamaged cell doors break I
named<00:02:23.720> all<00:02:23.900> these<00:02:24.140> two<00:02:24.560> cell<00:02:24.800> doors<00:02:25.040> so<00:02:25.550> yeah

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
named all these two cell doors so yeah

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.230 
named all these two cell doors so yeah
that's<00:02:26.720> the<00:02:26.870> breakable<00:02:27.490> set<00:02:28.490> that<00:02:28.670> I'm

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:29.240 
that's the breakable set that I'm

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:32.080 
that's the breakable set that I'm
impressed<00:02:29.690> so<00:02:30.080> let's<00:02:30.320> break<00:02:30.820> maybe<00:02:31.820> I<00:02:31.970> won't

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
impressed so let's break maybe I won't

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.030 
impressed so let's break maybe I won't

block me making it because it's a little
self-explanatory<00:02:37.510> you<00:02:38.510> just<00:02:39.160> take<00:02:40.160> your

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
self-explanatory you just take your

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.130 
self-explanatory you just take your
textures<00:02:40.700> out<00:02:40.910> if<00:02:41.180> you've<00:02:41.300> already<00:02:41.450> made<00:02:41.750> maps

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
textures out if you've already made maps

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.070 
textures out if you've already made maps
there's<00:02:42.920> plenty<00:02:43.280> of<00:02:43.510> tutorials<00:02:44.510> on<00:02:44.720> map

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
there's plenty of tutorials on map

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.230 
there's plenty of tutorials on map
making<00:02:45.530> out<00:02:45.680> itself<00:02:46.220> already<00:02:46.640> so<00:02:47.060> I'm<00:02:47.150> not

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:47.240 
making out itself already so I'm not

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:50.850 
making out itself already so I'm not
gonna<00:02:47.420> go<00:02:47.540> too<00:02:47.750> much<00:02:48.020> into<00:02:48.550> the<00:02:49.550> map<00:02:49.790> making

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
gonna go too much into the map making

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.210 
gonna go too much into the map making
basics<00:02:51.860> just<00:02:52.640> the<00:02:53.210> jailbreak<00:02:54.070> aspects<00:02:55.070> that

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
basics just the jailbreak aspects that

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.490 
basics just the jailbreak aspects that
you<00:02:55.370> may<00:02:55.550> not<00:02:55.700> know<00:02:55.880> about<00:02:56.030> that<00:02:56.540> it's<00:02:57.320> like<00:02:57.470> a

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
you may not know about that it's like a

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.920 
you may not know about that it's like a
little<00:02:57.680> confusing<00:02:58.220> like<00:02:58.550> jump<00:02:59.030> rope<00:02:59.330> settings

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
little confusing like jump rope settings

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.820 
little confusing like jump rope settings
or<00:03:00.320> the<00:03:00.680> music<00:03:01.250> and<00:03:01.700> stuff<00:03:02.180> like<00:03:02.300> that

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:02.830 
or the music and stuff like that

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:07.390 
or the music and stuff like that
so<00:03:03.830> yeah<00:03:04.130> there's<00:03:04.520> that<00:03:05.380> also<00:03:06.380> the<00:03:06.830> the<00:03:07.130> fund

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
so yeah there's that also the the fund

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.130 
so yeah there's that also the the fund
the<00:03:07.580> some<00:03:08.240> things<00:03:08.450> that<00:03:08.570> you<00:03:08.660> want<00:03:08.840> to<00:03:08.900> think

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
the some things that you want to think

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.140 
the some things that you want to think
about<00:03:09.230> while<00:03:09.920> you're<00:03:09.950> making<00:03:10.430> your<00:03:10.700> jailbreak

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
about while you're making your jailbreak

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.949 
about while you're making your jailbreak
map<00:03:11.450> for<00:03:12.140> example<00:03:13.210> the<00:03:14.210> amount<00:03:14.360> of<00:03:14.480> songs<00:03:14.720> you

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959 
map for example the amount of songs you

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:20.320 
map for example the amount of songs you
have<00:03:15.200> here<00:03:15.530> well<00:03:16.280> that's<00:03:16.900> on<00:03:17.900> CT<00:03:18.580> on<00:03:19.580> most<00:03:19.910> most

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:20.330 
have here well that's on CT on most most

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:23.170 
have here well that's on CT on most most
servers<00:03:21.160> you<00:03:22.160> have<00:03:22.190> like<00:03:22.520> a<00:03:22.610> two<00:03:22.850> to<00:03:23.000> one<00:03:23.030> ratio

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
servers you have like a two to one ratio

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.780 
servers you have like a two to one ratio
of<00:03:24.020> terroristic<00:03:24.860> counter-terrorist<00:03:25.550> so

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790 
of terroristic counter-terrorist so

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:28.150 
of terroristic counter-terrorist so
there's<00:03:26.080> twice<00:03:27.080> as<00:03:27.140> many<00:03:27.320> terrorists<00:03:28.010> that

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.160 
there's twice as many terrorists that

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.400 
there's twice as many terrorists that
there<00:03:28.340> are<00:03:28.459> commentaries<00:03:29.150> so<00:03:29.420> you<00:03:30.200> probably

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 
there are commentaries so you probably

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:36.160 
there are commentaries so you probably
wanna<00:03:30.740> at<00:03:31.070> least<00:03:31.459> like<00:03:33.130> 25<00:03:34.180> or<00:03:35.180> 26<00:03:35.720> like

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.170 
wanna at least like 25 or 26 like

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:39.100 
wanna at least like 25 or 26 like
terrorist<00:03:36.920> songs<00:03:37.160> maybe<00:03:37.970> more<00:03:38.300> I<00:03:38.330> like<00:03:38.870> to<00:03:38.990> be

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:39.110 
terrorist songs maybe more I like to be

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:42.220 
terrorist songs maybe more I like to be
like<00:03:39.560> 30<00:03:39.830> around<00:03:40.280> because<00:03:41.090> just<00:03:41.570> in<00:03:41.690> case<00:03:41.900> you

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.230 
like 30 around because just in case you

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:44.080 
like 30 around because just in case you
have<00:03:42.410> a<00:03:42.440> you<00:03:43.070> handle<00:03:43.310> on<00:03:43.400> a<00:03:43.430> server<00:03:43.760> that's

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.090 
have a you handle on a server that's

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:46.630 
have a you handle on a server that's
like<00:03:44.239> really<00:03:44.540> high<00:03:44.690> populated<00:03:45.640> usually

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:46.640 
like really high populated usually

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:48.760 
like really high populated usually
doesn't<00:03:46.910> get<00:03:47.030> that<00:03:47.150> get<00:03:47.600> that<00:03:47.630> to<00:03:48.350> that<00:03:48.530> many

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:48.770 
doesn't get that get that to that many

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:53.080 
doesn't get that get that to that many
people<00:03:48.920> but<00:03:49.520> you<00:03:50.000> never<00:03:50.150> know<00:03:50.330> so<00:03:51.220> yeah<00:03:52.220> who's

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.090 
people but you never know so yeah who's

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.500 
people but you never know so yeah who's
that

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:53.510 
that

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:55.479 
that
also<00:03:53.840> you<00:03:53.900> wanted<00:03:54.230> to<00:03:54.320> be<00:03:54.410> thinking<00:03:54.890> about<00:03:55.070> the

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:55.489 
also you wanted to be thinking about the

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:59.979 
also you wanted to be thinking about the
layout<00:03:55.790> and<00:03:57.670> your<00:03:58.670> vents<00:03:59.270> and<00:03:59.480> things<00:03:59.780> like

00:03:59.979 --> 00:03:59.989 
layout and your vents and things like

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:01.840 
layout and your vents and things like
that<00:04:00.050> like<00:04:00.500> I<00:04:00.650> have<00:04:00.830> a<00:04:00.860> vent<00:04:01.160> in<00:04:01.400> one<00:04:01.640> of<00:04:01.760> these

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:01.850 
that like I have a vent in one of these

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:06.160 
that like I have a vent in one of these
top<00:04:02.540> cells<00:04:02.989> right<00:04:03.440> here<00:04:04.300> and<00:04:05.300> where<00:04:06.050> they're

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:06.170 
top cells right here and where they're

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:08.470 
top cells right here and where they're
gonna<00:04:06.230> lead<00:04:06.530> to<00:04:06.560> you<00:04:06.739> in<00:04:06.830> the<00:04:06.950> end<00:04:07.330> for<00:04:08.330> this

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:08.480 
gonna lead to you in the end for this

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.479 
gonna lead to you in the end for this
map<00:04:08.690> actually<00:04:09.110> I<00:04:09.380> kind<00:04:09.830> of<00:04:09.920> just<00:04:10.100> started

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:10.489 
map actually I kind of just started

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:13.720 
map actually I kind of just started
throwing<00:04:10.820> stuff<00:04:11.209> down<00:04:11.480> and<00:04:11.840> then<00:04:12.370> it<00:04:13.370> kind<00:04:13.670> of

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:13.730 
throwing stuff down and then it kind of

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:15.610 
throwing stuff down and then it kind of
started<00:04:14.090> working<00:04:14.510> on<00:04:14.600> the<00:04:14.810> end<00:04:14.959> I<00:04:15.200> came<00:04:15.410> up

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.620 
started working on the end I came up

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:18.460 
started working on the end I came up
with<00:04:15.650> a<00:04:15.770> theme<00:04:16.660> Castle<00:04:17.660> I<00:04:17.780> called<00:04:18.020> the<00:04:18.109> cube<00:04:18.380> a

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:18.470 
with a theme Castle I called the cube a

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:20.900 
with a theme Castle I called the cube a
lot<00:04:18.620> but<00:04:19.400> came<00:04:19.669> a<00:04:19.700> lot

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:20.910 
lot but came a lot

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:24.470 
lot but came a lot
and<00:04:22.340> you<00:04:23.340> know<00:04:23.460> it<00:04:23.700> kind<00:04:23.910> of<00:04:24.030> just<00:04:24.210> started

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:24.480 
and you know it kind of just started

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:27.200 
and you know it kind of just started
sorting<00:04:24.990> itself<00:04:25.140> out<00:04:25.500> but<00:04:25.860> basically<00:04:26.490> you

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
sorting itself out but basically you

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:29.420 
sorting itself out but basically you
don't<00:04:27.510> want<00:04:27.750> to<00:04:27.870> make<00:04:28.020> it<00:04:28.230> too<00:04:28.560> easy<00:04:28.590> to<00:04:29.100> rebell

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
don't want to make it too easy to rebell

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:32.120 
don't want to make it too easy to rebell
or<00:04:30.180> too<00:04:30.450> hard<00:04:30.780> to<00:04:30.990> Ravel<00:04:31.290> it's<00:04:31.620> about<00:04:31.800> finding

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:32.130 
or too hard to Ravel it's about finding

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:34.490 
or too hard to Ravel it's about finding
the<00:04:32.310> balance<00:04:32.820> and<00:04:33.090> some<00:04:33.900> of<00:04:33.990> that<00:04:34.050> goes<00:04:34.320> with

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:34.500 
the balance and some of that goes with

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.380 
the balance and some of that goes with
testing<00:04:34.950> and<00:04:35.130> some<00:04:35.400> of<00:04:35.490> that<00:04:35.580> goes<00:04:35.820> it's<00:04:36.120> just

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:36.390 
testing and some of that goes it's just

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:38.900 
testing and some of that goes it's just
experience<00:04:36.900> in<00:04:37.230> jailbreak<00:04:37.740> but<00:04:38.490> you<00:04:38.610> can't

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:38.910 
experience in jailbreak but you can't

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:40.370 
experience in jailbreak but you can't
just<00:04:39.150> think<00:04:39.330> about<00:04:39.630> it<00:04:39.780> a<00:04:39.840> little<00:04:39.930> bit<00:04:40.080> while
