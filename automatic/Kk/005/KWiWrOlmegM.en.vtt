00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:16.289
 hello and today a very Sicilian recipe 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:19.289
 quick to prepare actually it is 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.630
 of a typical Christmas recipe in the 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.960
 meaning that we Sicilians above all 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.660
 from the eastern part 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:31.019
 we use to prepare it for the Christmas holidays 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:33.660
 there is none and I say no eve 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:36.690
 Christmas in which there is no smurfs 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.940
 desperately driven out then the 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.399
 I propose it crushed in this 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.579
 period we say Easter because Easter 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:47.690
 it looks like it is coming in fact it is 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:50.039
 March 31 is not even April we are in 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:52.860
 very slight delay and already in the 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:56.610
 preparations and I prepare it for then 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:59.010
 this period in spite of del 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.879
 traditional period is repeated period 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.039
 30 times 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.769
 yes because I have a lot of vocabulary 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.150
 therefore I prepare it for Easter 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.420
 because it reminds me so much of the 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:12.630
 Neapolitan casatiello that slips into place 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:15.150
 inside the picnic basket 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.610
 in fact the schiacciata is one of those 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.310
 classic bread preparation made with 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.979
 the bread dough that they can 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.409
 to be eaten the next day or even later 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.909
 they are even better and just like 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.040
 happens with pizza 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.229
 now that I am raving 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.170
 images went on a lot 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.930
 I cut the Sicilian tuma that can 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.790
 be naturally replaced in the case 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.340
 in which you would like to prepare it and become a 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.770
 they are not going well to go to Sicily to take 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.350
 the tuma can be replaced by the toma 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:50.070
 or in any case from a soft cheese 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:53.579
 the Galbanino comes to mind let's say 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:55.530
 however it is absolutely not true then 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.299
 what else goes well yes I 'm preparing 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.090
 the one with the sausage potatoes 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:03.000
 although traditionally above all 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.930
 in the Catania area it is more common to use both 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.970
 cauliflower than broccoli 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:09.740
 however, cauliflower is more 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.930
 depends on any family family 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.910
 catanese obviously could deny me and 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.950
 nothing I am always late we say yes 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.920
 sausage potatoes in the case of 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:21.950
 potato sausage of course you can 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:25.580
 remove the meat if it should be 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:27.410
 served vegan vegetarian and parades 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.120
 they should be cut thin, use the 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.190
 fresh onion from the sausage 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.530
 you have to remove the gut as you are 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:36.890
 seen in the previous images and then 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:39.470
 nothing is added the side but the pepper and 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:42.350
 the salt in very abundant quantities e 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:46.450
 then there is the secret of santa signora pina 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:49.640
 that is to say that to have the 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:52.760
 content makes a circle in the center 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:55.610
 the hands are moistened and massaged 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:58.850
 slightly the chased over well yes 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:01.820
 this makes the smash to be annoyed 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:04.310
 the towards the more crunchy schiacciata 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:05.450
 word of pina and is really true in 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:10.030
 reality 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:12.290
 in antiquity it is brushed goes with 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:14.780
 I remember that abundant oil 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:16.989
 of grandmother and aunt who commanded oil from 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:19.130
 all the parts and therefore practically 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:22.250
 hold a dunk by the hand 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:26.090
 it means getting the oil to drain until 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:28.880
 elbow now let's say that traditions 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:31.220
 despite being always maintained as such 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:33.080
 we say that we are a little more regulated 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:36.230
 because cholesterol and Sicilians like 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:38.360
 media have it at 375 we say we are 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:42.400
 normally this is the only thing 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:45.019
 crushed for any adjustment 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:47.600
 elucidation bla bla bla there is always i 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:49.850
 blog www maghetta close point it 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.829
 division puntoit I always thank you 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:53.900
 and above all I thank you for the 

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:56.030
 inscriptions although I am not 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:58.070
 very much promoting the channel ne 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:00.650
 I get so many and I am 

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:02.290
 flattered is here I make a summary 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:04.870
 of the Sicilian expulsion 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:07.420
 and therefore of bili origin it goes down for the 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:10.569
 bread dough of course everyone uses the 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:12.819
 own who in a kilo of flour of 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:15.040
 semolina usually puts 50 g of yeast 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:18.130
 of beer who puts 25 I do not put 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:19.720
 beak you do your home short 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:22.169
 we give in to the next fidel field a 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:22.169
 kiss bye
