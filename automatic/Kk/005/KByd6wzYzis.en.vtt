got a little switch I hooked up for just

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.160 
got a little switch I hooked up for just
making<00:02:33.770> it<00:02:33.980> easier<00:02:34.280> on<00:02:34.340> myself<00:02:34.550> so<00:02:35.060> you<00:02:35.930> got

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
this green wire right here that runs to

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:40.960 
this green wire right here that runs to
the<00:02:37.940> radio<00:02:38.330> and<00:02:38.630> that's<00:02:39.500> the<00:02:40.340> parking<00:02:40.760> brake

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:45.739 
really have to do is ground it and so

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:47.830 
really have to do is ground it and so
this<00:02:45.950> wire<00:02:46.190> right<00:02:46.220> here<00:02:46.459> is<00:02:46.880> the<00:02:47.540> ground

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
this wire right here is the ground

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.300 
this wire right here is the ground
that's<00:02:48.080> on<00:02:48.230> the<00:02:48.320> radio<00:02:48.530> whenever<00:02:48.890> I<00:02:48.950> watered

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
up i sided a third wire ran it over here

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.360 
up i sided a third wire ran it over here
just<00:02:52.459> because<00:02:52.610> it's<00:02:52.850> out<00:02:53.209> of<00:02:53.270> the<00:02:53.510> way<00:02:53.690> and<00:02:54.110> uh

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
just because it's out of the way and uh

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:01.550 
the on position on then off so you flick

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:06.539 
the on position on then off so you flick
it<00:03:01.670> off<00:03:01.790> then<00:03:02.690> turn<00:03:02.930> it<00:03:03.080> on<00:03:03.200> off<00:03:04.690> then<00:03:05.690> back<00:03:05.840> on

and then tricks the radio thinking that

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:12.580 
and then tricks the radio thinking that
