Hi, I'm Mark Levy, owner of Aqua Boy Pools,
out here in beautiful Las Vegas pool service.

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:10.250
We've created a series of videos that includes
tips on pool service, maintenance, and repair

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:14.160
in Las Vegas - to help keep your pool and
spa in perfect working order, and to help

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.740
you identify the cause of common problems
that may arise.

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.099
Las Vegas Pool Service Available.

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:24.860
Give us a call and we'll take care of all

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:25.110
of your Las Vegas pool service needs.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.439
Every pool is going to need an acid wash,
eventually.

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:32.180
Every four to five years, you should drain
your pool water, and acid wash your Las Vegas

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:32.489
pool.

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.429
Basically, what an acid wash does, is it gets
a lot of the staining out - which is unsightly.

00:00:36.429 --> 00:00:39.399
It will make your pool look a lot nicer, and
make you happier.

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:45.839
But, what an acid wash really for is to remove
the hard minerals and calcium deposits that

00:00:45.839 --> 00:00:50.239
are in your plaster, which you don't see,
but affects your water chemistry.

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:52.409
So, after a certain amount of time ...

00:00:52.409 --> 00:00:54.210
Think of it like a big bath tub.

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.280
You can't have the same water just sitting
there ... It locks up.

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:02.550
So, you may be having trouble balancing your
chlorine, your ph, your alkalinity ...

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.700
Your chlorine might even be at a really high
level, but you still have algae all over the

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:07.060
pool.

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.660
It's because your water is locked up. It needs
to be drained and acid washed.

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:11.490
Chlorine baths are also very important for
your Las Vegas pool.

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.190
You should give your Las Vegas pool a chlorine
bath, every four to five years, as well.

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:20.910
What a chlorine bath does it it kills all
the algae spores that are in your plaster.

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:22.870
The ones that you cannot see ...

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:27.380
The ones that are dormant in the winter time,
but which will emerge in the summer time.

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.950
So, if you drain your pool, and you give it
that chlorine bath, you will kill those dormant

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:32.970
algae cells.

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.140
And, when your summertime in Las Vegas comes
around, you'll be happy you did it.

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:37.860
Because, you'll have crystal, blue water.

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.720
Thanks for watching. I hope you enjoyed the
video.
