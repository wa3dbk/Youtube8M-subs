wrath of God against men because of sin

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.850 
wrath of God against men because of sin
and<00:01:03.960> so<00:01:04.949> Jesus<00:01:05.369> is<00:01:05.700> death<00:01:06.030> in<00:01:06.330> Islam<00:01:06.780> cannot<00:01:07.680> be

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
and so Jesus is death in Islam cannot be

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.560 
and so Jesus is death in Islam cannot be
filtered<00:01:08.189> there's<00:01:08.580> no<00:01:08.760> way<00:01:08.880> Jesus<00:01:09.360> could<00:01:09.450> have

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
filtered there's no way Jesus could have

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.380 
filtered there's no way Jesus could have
died<00:01:09.750> it's<00:01:10.350> impossible<00:01:11.220> because<00:01:11.760> if<00:01:12.060> Jesus

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
died it's impossible because if Jesus

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.469 
died it's impossible because if Jesus
dies<00:01:12.600> either<00:01:13.470> he<00:01:13.710> dies<00:01:13.890> as<00:01:14.130> a<00:01:14.159> failure<00:01:14.549> or<00:01:14.760> he

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
dies either he dies as a failure or he
