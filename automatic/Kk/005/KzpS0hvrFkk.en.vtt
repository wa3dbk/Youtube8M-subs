00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:24.080
 What child I can not find my plane and I 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:27.980
 I see why 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:30.070
 you know what could help you that then the 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:34.640
 cleaning and order 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:37.220
 Jehovah has everything in place and thinks 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.860
 on the planets they are always 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:43.460
 moving but jehovah keeps them in their 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:46.700
 orbits and that's why they never collide 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:49.940
 and look at the people even though outside 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:53.890
 we are different inside is everything in 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:56.690
 its place the heart the lungs 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:59.170
 imagine if the eyes were below 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.170
 from the feet 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:03.510
 Jehovah even keeps the 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:06.810
 animals 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:11.720
 look at the little fish are cleaning the 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.720
 hippopotamus and the bird is helping 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:20.229
 I wish the animals will help me and 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:23.340
 me too but that's why jehovah gave us 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:26.280
 the hands to help us 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:30.060
 if you keep your things jehovah will get 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:34.399
 very happy and who knows maybe when 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.399
 you finish you find your plane 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.750

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:59.250
