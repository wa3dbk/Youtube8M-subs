00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:32.279
 here 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:44.600
 hydroelectric dam 5,000 megawatts that 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:47.680
 end up in the defensive system of 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.680
 evening attitude 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:09.240
 happy the energy connection the system 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.550
 ycs breaking down the dam we will eliminate the 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.040
 central evening defenses cannot 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:14.790
 feeding with the ycs system not on 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.400
 same grid 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.020
 let me understand why use a dam if 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.680
 have the ycs system which is a source of 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:27.410
 infinite energy redundancy or maybe there is 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.410
 something in the ycs system that scares them 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:34.410
 feel psycho mature know these well 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.840

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.470

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:18.599
