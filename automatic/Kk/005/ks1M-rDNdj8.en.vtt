okay<00:00:03.300> we're<00:00:03.600> looking<00:00:03.780> at<00:00:04.259> the<00:00:05.160> journey<00:00:05.549> of<00:00:06.029> a

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
okay we're looking at the journey of a

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.900 
okay we're looking at the journey of a
copper<00:00:06.990> sample<00:00:07.560> through<00:00:08.400> a<00:00:08.460> series<00:00:08.880> of

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
copper sample through a series of

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.190 
copper sample through a series of
reactions<00:00:09.150> that<00:00:09.870> we<00:00:10.019> will<00:00:10.200> then<00:00:10.320> classify<00:00:12.200> and

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
reactions that we will then classify and

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.499 
reactions that we will then classify and
if<00:00:13.320> we<00:00:13.440> consider<00:00:13.830> what<00:00:14.160> copper<00:00:14.910> is<00:00:15.089> while

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
if we consider what copper is while

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.330 
if we consider what copper is while
copper<00:00:15.960> is<00:00:16.109> a<00:00:16.139> metal<00:00:17.840> it's<00:00:18.840> a<00:00:19.020> solid<00:00:19.529> and<00:00:19.830> it's

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
copper is a metal it's a solid and it's

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.189 
copper is a metal it's a solid and it's
shiny<00:00:20.699> and<00:00:21.920> in<00:00:22.920> the<00:00:23.490> elemental<00:00:23.939> state<00:00:24.240> it<00:00:24.960> goes

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
shiny and in the elemental state it goes

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:26.570 
shiny and in the elemental state it goes
without<00:00:25.320> saying<00:00:25.500> that<00:00:25.830> copper<00:00:26.250> is<00:00:26.340> going<00:00:26.400> to

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
without saying that copper is going to

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.480 
without saying that copper is going to
be<00:00:26.699> neutral<00:00:27.320> it<00:00:28.320> is<00:00:28.470> in<00:00:28.650> fact<00:00:28.859> an<00:00:29.070> element<00:00:29.429> we

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
be neutral it is in fact an element we

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.179 
be neutral it is in fact an element we
can<00:00:29.519> represent<00:00:29.820> copper<00:00:30.390> with<00:00:31.019> its<00:00:31.230> symbol<00:00:31.650> Cu

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
can represent copper with its symbol Cu

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.979 
can represent copper with its symbol Cu
and<00:00:32.489> if<00:00:33.000> we<00:00:33.059> want<00:00:33.239> to<00:00:33.329> indicate<00:00:33.480> they<00:00:33.930> were

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
and if we want to indicate they were

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.410 
and if we want to indicate they were
talking<00:00:34.410> about<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:35.190> metal<00:00:35.640> copper<00:00:36.059> which<00:00:36.239> we

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
talking about the metal copper which we

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.690 
talking about the metal copper which we
are<00:00:36.600> in<00:00:36.750> this<00:00:36.930> case<00:00:37.230> then<00:00:37.980> we<00:00:38.129> would<00:00:38.160> write<00:00:38.670> a

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
are in this case then we would write a

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.930 
are in this case then we would write a
subscript<00:00:39.300> of<00:00:39.600> zero<00:00:40.129> to<00:00:41.129> indicate<00:00:41.309> that<00:00:41.760> this

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
subscript of zero to indicate that this

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.740 
subscript of zero to indicate that this
is<00:00:42.000> not<00:00:42.360> charge<00:00:42.780> we<00:00:42.989> have<00:00:43.140> a<00:00:43.170> total<00:00:44.070> balance<00:00:44.460> of

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:44.750 
is not charge we have a total balance of

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:48.380 
is not charge we have a total balance of
electrons<00:00:45.750> and<00:00:46.020> protons<00:00:46.850> now<00:00:47.850> we<00:00:47.910> can<00:00:48.180> change

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
electrons and protons now we can change

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.200 
electrons and protons now we can change
that<00:00:48.660> situation<00:00:48.930> with<00:00:49.530> copper<00:00:50.030> just<00:00:51.030> by

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
that situation with copper just by

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.020 
that situation with copper just by
adding<00:00:51.480> nitric<00:00:52.020> acid<00:00:52.500> so<00:00:53.280> if<00:00:53.340> we<00:00:53.460> add<00:00:53.640> copper

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
adding nitric acid so if we add copper

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.350 
adding nitric acid so if we add copper
add<00:00:54.750> some<00:00:55.079> nitric<00:00:55.440> acid<00:00:55.949> to<00:00:56.100> our<00:00:56.430> copper

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
add some nitric acid to our copper

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.049 
add some nitric acid to our copper
sample<00:00:57.809> we'll<00:00:58.379> go<00:00:58.620> from<00:00:58.949> this<00:00:59.160> solid<00:00:59.730> shiny

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
sample we'll go from this solid shiny

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.950 
sample we'll go from this solid shiny
lustrous<00:01:00.629> metal<00:01:01.190> to<00:01:02.190> a<00:01:02.550> solution<00:01:03.059> of<00:01:03.510> copper

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
lustrous metal to a solution of copper

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.250 
lustrous metal to a solution of copper
to<00:01:04.290> ions<00:01:04.710> which<00:01:05.309> is<00:01:05.489> deep<00:01:05.729> blue<00:01:05.990> what<00:01:06.990> we<00:01:07.110> will

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
to ions which is deep blue what we will

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.969 
to ions which is deep blue what we will
also<00:01:07.439> get<00:01:08.010> is<00:01:08.850> some<00:01:09.299> brown<00:01:09.600> gas<00:01:09.930> evolving<00:01:10.710> and

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
also get is some brown gas evolving and

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.190 
also get is some brown gas evolving and
this<00:01:11.159> is<00:01:11.400> due<00:01:11.670> to<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.030> formation<00:01:12.390> of<00:01:12.659> nitrogen

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
this is due to the formation of nitrogen

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.649 
this is due to the formation of nitrogen
dioxide<00:01:13.820> if<00:01:14.820> we<00:01:14.970> consider<00:01:15.330> what's<00:01:15.570> happening

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
dioxide if we consider what's happening

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.469 
dioxide if we consider what's happening
to<00:01:16.259> our<00:01:16.290> copper<00:01:16.770> sample<00:01:17.400> all<00:01:18.000> that<00:01:18.330> we're

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
to our copper sample all that we're

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.510 
to our copper sample all that we're
doing<00:01:18.630> is<00:01:18.990> we're<00:01:19.170> yanking<00:01:19.710> two<00:01:19.890> electrons

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
doing is we're yanking two electrons

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.640 
doing is we're yanking two electrons
from<00:01:20.729> copper<00:01:21.210> so<00:01:21.810> we<00:01:21.900> no<00:01:22.049> longer<00:01:22.080> have<00:01:22.439> a

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
from copper so we no longer have a

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.219 
from copper so we no longer have a
balance<00:01:23.250> of<00:01:23.340> protons<00:01:23.820> and<00:01:23.909> electrons<00:01:24.020> we<00:01:25.020> go

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
balance of protons and electrons we go

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.390 
balance of protons and electrons we go
from<00:01:25.470> a<00:01:25.650> neutral<00:01:26.070> copper<00:01:26.610> sample<00:01:27.180> copper<00:01:27.900> zero

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:28.400 
from a neutral copper sample copper zero

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:33.440 
from a neutral copper sample copper zero
to<00:01:30.049> copper<00:01:31.049> two-plus<00:01:31.610> and<00:01:32.610> that's<00:01:32.850> what<00:01:33.180> gives

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
to copper two-plus and that's what gives

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.890 
to copper two-plus and that's what gives
us<00:01:33.570> this<00:01:33.810> blue<00:01:34.170> color<00:01:34.530> in<00:01:34.799> our<00:01:34.890> solution<00:01:35.900> at

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
us this blue color in our solution at

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.420 
us this blue color in our solution at
the<00:01:37.049> same<00:01:37.259> time<00:01:37.500> we<00:01:37.710> have<00:01:37.860> to<00:01:38.009> take<00:01:38.220> those

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
the same time we have to take those

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.999 
the same time we have to take those
electrons<00:01:38.970> and<00:01:39.119> put<00:01:39.329> them<00:01:39.450> somewhere<00:01:40.009> so

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
electrons and put them somewhere so

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.889 
electrons and put them somewhere so
that's<00:01:41.220> where<00:01:41.520> our<00:01:41.549> nitrate<00:01:42.360> is<00:01:42.479> coming<00:01:42.810> to

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
that's where our nitrate is coming to

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.350 
that's where our nitrate is coming to
play<00:01:43.310> nitrate<00:01:44.310> is<00:01:44.490> accepting<00:01:45.030> these<00:01:45.180> two

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
play nitrate is accepting these two

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.960 
play nitrate is accepting these two
electrons<00:01:45.930> to<00:01:46.200> become<00:01:46.439> the<00:01:46.740> nitrogen<00:01:47.250> dioxide

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
electrons to become the nitrogen dioxide

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.179 
electrons to become the nitrogen dioxide
and<00:01:48.270> that's<00:01:48.810> what<00:01:49.020> gives<00:01:49.200> us<00:01:49.350> this<00:01:49.560> brown<00:01:49.890> gas

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
and that's what gives us this brown gas

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.510 
and that's what gives us this brown gas
whenever<00:01:50.759> we<00:01:50.909> add<00:01:51.439> nitric<00:01:52.439> acid<00:01:52.860> to<00:01:52.890> a<00:01:53.040> sample

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
whenever we add nitric acid to a sample

00:01:53.520 --> 00:02:00.550 
whenever we add nitric acid to a sample
of<00:01:53.610> copper<00:01:57.049> now<00:01:58.049> once<00:01:58.860> we<00:01:59.100> have<00:01:59.130> copper<00:02:00.090> to

which we take two ions a cation and

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.940 
which we take two ions a cation and

case<00:02:35.400> is<00:02:35.760> copper<00:02:36.209> two<00:02:36.420> hydroxide<00:02:40.760> now<00:02:41.760> once<00:02:42.150> we

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
case is copper two hydroxide now once we

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.680 
case is copper two hydroxide now once we
have<00:02:42.390> our<00:02:42.629> copper<00:02:43.049> two<00:02:43.379> hydroxide<00:02:43.640> sample<00:02:44.690> we

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
have our copper two hydroxide sample we

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.440 
have our copper two hydroxide sample we
can<00:02:45.900> change<00:02:46.200> that<00:02:46.410> simply<00:02:46.980> by<00:02:47.160> adding<00:02:47.610> Heat<00:02:48.120> so

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
can change that simply by adding Heat so

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.150 
can change that simply by adding Heat so
if<00:02:48.510> we<00:02:48.630> take<00:02:48.810> our<00:02:49.019> sample<00:02:49.470> of<00:02:49.590> a<00:02:49.739> copper<00:02:50.040> two

if we take our sample of a copper two

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.589 
if we take our sample of a copper two
hydroxide<00:02:50.190> and<00:02:51.150> heat<00:02:51.360> that<00:02:53.030> it's<00:02:54.030> not<00:02:54.299> long

before<00:02:54.870> you<00:02:55.140> go<00:02:55.500> from<00:02:55.799> having<00:02:56.069> a<00:02:56.549> Bluegreen

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540

precipitate to sort of blackish
precipitate<00:03:01.079> and<00:03:01.290> this<00:03:01.799> is<00:03:01.950> due<00:03:02.160> the<00:03:02.310> fact

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:02.549 
precipitate and this is due the fact

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:05.030 
precipitate and this is due the fact
that<00:03:02.670> we<00:03:02.880> are<00:03:03.110> decomposing<00:03:04.110> this<00:03:04.500> copper

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
that we are decomposing this copper

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.870 
that we are decomposing this copper
hydroxide<00:03:05.720> into<00:03:06.980> two<00:03:07.980> other<00:03:08.160> substances<00:03:08.819> in

hydroxide into two other substances in
this<00:03:09.120> case<00:03:09.360> we're<00:03:09.599> decomposing<00:03:10.319> copper<00:03:10.739> two

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
this case we're decomposing copper two

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.140 
this case we're decomposing copper two
hydroxide<00:03:11.280> two<00:03:12.030> copper<00:03:12.480> two<00:03:12.750> oxide<00:03:13.349> and<00:03:13.680> water

hydroxide two copper two oxide and water
this<00:03:15.150> is<00:03:15.209> a<00:03:15.360> decomposition<00:03:16.079> reaction<00:03:16.470> because

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
this is a decomposition reaction because

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.460 
this is a decomposition reaction because
we're<00:03:17.190> going<00:03:17.340> from<00:03:17.630> one<00:03:18.630> compound<00:03:18.930> and

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
we're going from one compound and

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.620 
we're going from one compound and
breaking<00:03:19.950> that<00:03:20.130> down<00:03:20.160> into<00:03:20.790> two<00:03:21.389> other

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
breaking that down into two other

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:27.199 
breaking that down into two other
compounds<00:03:25.130> now<00:03:26.130> we<00:03:26.190> can<00:03:26.430> get<00:03:26.549> our<00:03:26.760> blue

00:03:58.879 --> 00:03:58.889 
reaction and this is what's referred to

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:00.620 
reaction and this is what's referred to

as a double displacement reaction

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:02.509 
as a double displacement reaction
because<00:04:00.780> we're<00:04:00.930> displacing<00:04:01.650> two<00:04:01.920> compounds

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:02.519 
because we're displacing two compounds

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:05.629 
because we're displacing two compounds
to<00:04:02.670> form<00:04:02.700> two<00:04:03.480> new<00:04:03.690> compounds<00:04:04.220> so<00:04:05.220> we<00:04:05.310> can<00:04:05.489> go

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:05.639 
to form two new compounds so we can go

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:08.750 
to form two new compounds so we can go
from<00:04:05.910> our<00:04:06.209> black<00:04:07.139> precipitate<00:04:07.889> in<00:04:08.130> by<00:04:08.459> adding

whole sequence of reactions was to

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:24.830 
whole sequence of reactions was to
oxidize<00:04:24.030> our

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 
oxidize our

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190 
per sample two copper two-plus ions we

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.100 
per sample two copper two-plus ions we
can<00:04:29.370> then<00:04:29.580> take<00:04:29.850> and<00:04:30.210> add<00:04:30.389> some<00:04:30.690> magnesium

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
can then take and add some magnesium

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:34.520 
can then take and add some magnesium
just<00:04:31.650> solid<00:04:31.889> magnesium<00:04:32.490> and<00:04:33.169> this<00:04:34.169> will<00:04:34.380> have

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 
just solid magnesium and this will have

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:36.200 
just solid magnesium and this will have
the<00:04:34.680> effect<00:04:34.949> of<00:04:35.040> adding<00:04:35.370> two<00:04:35.520> electrons<00:04:36.060> to

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830 
way back to solid copper so in this case

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:46.640 
way back to solid copper so in this case
we're<00:04:44.280> just<00:04:44.310> taking<00:04:44.669> our<00:04:45.600> copper<00:04:46.080> two<00:04:46.229> ions

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:49.470 
and from magnesium we're getting two

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:51.620 
and from magnesium we're getting two
electrons<00:04:50.310> now<00:04:50.520> to<00:04:50.910> take<00:04:51.060> us<00:04:51.120> all<00:04:51.419> the<00:04:51.540> way

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:51.630 
electrons now to take us all the way

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:53.689 
electrons now to take us all the way
back<00:04:51.660> to<00:04:52.320> where<00:04:52.470> we<00:04:52.620> started<00:04:52.650> which<00:04:53.280> was<00:04:53.490> our

00:04:53.689 --> 00:04:53.699 
back to where we started which was our

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:58.370 
back to where we started which was our
copper<00:04:54.150> metal<00:04:56.300> so<00:04:57.300> if<00:04:57.389> we<00:04:57.510> review<00:04:58.020> what<00:04:58.229> we've

00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:58.380 
copper metal so if we review what we've

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:01.610 
copper metal so if we review what we've
done<00:04:58.650> in<00:04:59.070> this<00:05:00.060> journey<00:05:00.540> of<00:05:00.870> copper<00:05:01.380> through<00:05:01.560> a

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:01.620 
done in this journey of copper through a

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:04.340 
done in this journey of copper through a
series<00:05:01.979> of<00:05:02.010> reactions<00:05:02.780> we<00:05:03.780> started<00:05:04.169> off<00:05:04.320> by

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:04.350 
series of reactions we started off by

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:07.580 
series of reactions we started off by
oxidizing<00:05:05.130> our<00:05:05.520> copper<00:05:06.030> to<00:05:06.690> copper<00:05:06.720> 2<00:05:07.260> plus

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:07.590 
oxidizing our copper to copper 2 plus

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:09.980 
oxidizing our copper to copper 2 plus
and<00:05:08.070> this<00:05:08.430> gave<00:05:08.700> us<00:05:08.850> a<00:05:08.880> blue<00:05:09.240> solution<00:05:09.840> of

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:09.990 
and this gave us a blue solution of

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:13.040 
and this gave us a blue solution of
copper<00:05:10.229> 2<00:05:10.530> ions<00:05:11.120> we<00:05:12.120> can<00:05:12.360> then<00:05:12.540> take<00:05:12.780> those

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:13.050 
copper 2 ions we can then take those

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:15.050 
copper 2 ions we can then take those
copper<00:05:13.380> 2<00:05:13.530> ions<00:05:13.889> and<00:05:14.250> get<00:05:14.490> them<00:05:14.669> to<00:05:14.850> combine

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:15.060 
copper 2 ions and get them to combine

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:18.620 
copper 2 ions and get them to combine
with<00:05:15.660> hydroxide<00:05:16.440> anions<00:05:17.160> to<00:05:17.850> form<00:05:18.180> a<00:05:18.360> blue

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:18.630

then the last step we brought it back by

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:10.310 
then the last step we brought it back by

reducing putting those electrons back

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:13.279 
reducing putting those electrons back
into<00:06:10.680> copper<00:06:11.099> to<00:06:11.669> take<00:06:11.880> us<00:06:12.060> to<00:06:12.270> our<00:06:12.510> neutral
