00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.569 
see two and all the moves that now
followed<00:00:41.579> is<00:00:41.820> more<00:00:42.450> or<00:00:42.540> less<00:00:42.570> just<00:00:42.719> theory

00:00:43.569 --> 00:00:43.579

white captures on d5 play night b5 and
then<00:00:48.180> there<00:00:48.420> is<00:00:48.539> an<00:00:48.750> exchange<00:00:49.289> on<00:00:49.530> d2<00:00:50.370> and<00:00:50.550> went

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
then there is an exchange on d2 and went

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.170 
then there is an exchange on d2 and went
black<00:00:51.480> plays<00:00:51.719> a<00:00:51.960> 16<00:00:52.620> of<00:00:52.800> course<00:00:53.039> white<00:00:53.730> just

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
black plays a 16 of course white just

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.990 
black plays a 16 of course white just
have<00:00:54.420> time<00:00:54.690> to<00:00:54.719> play<00:00:55.110> D<00:00:55.680> captures<00:00:56.219> a<00:00:56.489> five<00:00:56.730> and

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
have time to play D captures a five and

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.500 
have time to play D captures a five and
then<00:00:57.600> put<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:58.020> net<00:00:58.170> on<00:00:58.430> default<00:00:59.430> and<00:00:59.640> here<00:01:00.480> of

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
then put the net on default and here of

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.720 
then put the net on default and here of
course<00:01:00.690> why<00:01:01.050> it<00:01:01.109> has<00:01:01.350> a<00:01:01.559> small<00:01:01.859> advantage<00:01:02.460> in

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
course why it has a small advantage in

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.509 
course why it has a small advantage in
the<00:01:03.000> in<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:03.539> pawn<00:01:03.840> structure<00:01:04.199> and<00:01:04.519> therefore

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
the in the pawn structure and therefore

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.810 
the in the pawn structure and therefore
also<00:01:05.640> in<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:05.939> end<00:01:06.180> game<00:01:06.420> but<00:01:07.140> a<00:01:07.740> strong<00:01:08.610> player

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
also in the end game but a strong player

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.679 
also in the end game but a strong player
should<00:01:09.240> be<00:01:09.479> able<00:01:09.689> to<00:01:09.960> hold<00:01:10.290> this<00:01:10.790> draw<00:01:11.790> and<00:01:12.030> the

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
should be able to hold this draw and the

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.240 
should be able to hold this draw and the
best<00:01:12.869> move<00:01:13.049> here<00:01:13.290> is<00:01:13.470> to<00:01:13.590> get<00:01:13.770> rid<00:01:13.920> of<00:01:13.979> the

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
best move here is to get rid of the

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.810 
best move here is to get rid of the
bishop<00:01:14.760> c8<00:01:15.390> because<00:01:15.810> this<00:01:16.020> Bishop<00:01:16.380> is<00:01:16.560> a<00:01:17.430> bad

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
bishop c8 because this Bishop is a bad

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.690 
bishop c8 because this Bishop is a bad
piece<00:01:18.150> now<00:01:18.540> that<00:01:18.810> all<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.770> pawns<00:01:20.040> on<00:01:20.369> the

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
piece now that all the pawns on the

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.620 
piece now that all the pawns on the
queenside<00:01:20.939> is<00:01:21.479> on<00:01:22.320> its<00:01:22.799> square<00:01:23.360> then<00:01:24.360> we<00:01:24.509> had

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
queenside is on its square then we had

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.510 
queenside is on its square then we had
bishop<00:01:25.140> captures<00:01:25.530> chief<00:01:25.770> all<00:01:26.009> night<00:01:26.280> f

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
bishop captures chief all night f

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.390 
bishop captures chief all night f

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
captures back on g4 White's problem is

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.700 
captures back on g4 White's problem is
now<00:01:29.640> you<00:01:30.360> know<00:01:30.509> to<00:01:31.490> get<00:01:32.490> his<00:01:32.700> pieces<00:01:33.299> out<00:01:33.710> fast

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
now you know to get his pieces out fast

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.160 
now you know to get his pieces out fast
and<00:01:35.040> find<00:01:35.759> good<00:01:36.060> squares<00:01:36.450> for<00:01:36.810> a<00:01:36.840> screen

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
and find good squares for a screen

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.450 
and find good squares for a screen
because<00:01:38.150> the<00:01:39.150> problem<00:01:39.540> now<00:01:39.689> is<00:01:39.720> that<00:01:40.250> black<00:01:41.250> is

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
because the problem now is that black is

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.210 
because the problem now is that black is
winning<00:01:41.880> one<00:01:42.840> temple<00:01:43.290> immediately<00:01:43.560> with<00:01:44.040> rook

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
winning one temple immediately with rook

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.380 
winning one temple immediately with rook
c8<00:01:44.460> so<00:01:44.820> he's<00:01:45.030> first<00:01:45.329> in<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:46.500> C<00:01:47.310> file<00:01:47.549> and<00:01:47.820> then

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
c8 so he's first in the C file and then

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.780 
c8 so he's first in the C file and then
the<00:01:48.600> square<00:01:48.869> c<00:01:49.140> 3<00:01:49.409> is<00:01:49.439> of<00:01:49.740> course<00:01:49.950> also<00:01:50.250> Wiegand

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
the square c 3 is of course also Wiegand

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.760 
the square c 3 is of course also Wiegand
and<00:01:50.850> why<00:01:51.420> it<00:01:51.479> has<00:01:51.659> no<00:01:51.840> chance<00:01:52.079> to<00:01:52.380> build<00:01:52.560> up

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
and why it has no chance to build up

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.740 
and why it has no chance to build up
really<00:01:53.130> an<00:01:53.280> attack<00:01:53.700> against<00:01:54.270> d5<00:01:55.820> so<00:01:56.820> yeah<00:01:57.420> okay

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
really an attack against d5 so yeah okay

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.359 
really an attack against d5 so yeah okay
in<00:01:57.840> this<00:01:58.020> position<00:01:58.500> is<00:01:58.649> possible<00:01:59.100> to<00:01:59.189> play
