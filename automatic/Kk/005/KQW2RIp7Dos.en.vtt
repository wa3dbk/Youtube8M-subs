00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.300 
stove has been going for about an hour
and<00:00:13.370> I<00:00:14.370> made<00:00:14.700> a<00:00:14.730> change<00:00:15.179> the<00:00:15.660> other<00:00:15.809> day

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:16.310 
and I made a change the other day

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:19.250 
and I made a change the other day
yesterday<00:00:17.310> when<00:00:17.699> Nate<00:00:17.940> was<00:00:18.150> here<00:00:18.449> he

yesterday when Nate was here he

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.269 
yesterday when Nate was here he
suggested<00:00:19.920> that<00:00:20.100> the<00:00:20.369> 36<00:00:21.150> inch<00:00:21.300> wildfire

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:22.279 
suggested that the 36 inch wildfire

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:25.939 
suggested that the 36 inch wildfire
isn't<00:00:23.279> getting<00:00:23.460> enough<00:00:23.640> air<00:00:24.230> so<00:00:25.230> what<00:00:25.619> we<00:00:25.769> did

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
isn't getting enough air so what we did

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.050 
isn't getting enough air so what we did
was<00:00:26.010> went<00:00:27.439> back<00:00:28.439> to<00:00:28.769> well<00:00:29.400> you<00:00:29.609> can't<00:00:29.880> really

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
see it that well in this light the bars

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.920 
see it that well in this light the bars
on<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.320> underside<00:00:34.890> of<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.489> draft<00:00:35.850> and<00:00:36.570> the

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
on the underside of the draft and the

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.979 
on the underside of the draft and the
old<00:00:37.190> Elms<00:00:38.190> back<00:00:38.520> in<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:39.120> o<00:00:40.969> pre-1980<00:00:41.989> half

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
old Elms back in the o pre-1980 half

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.200 
old Elms back in the o pre-1980 half
those<00:00:43.290> bars<00:00:43.590> were<00:00:43.860> missing<00:00:44.340> so<00:00:44.610> we<00:00:44.640> took<00:00:44.969> two

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
those bars were missing so we took two

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.860 
those bars were missing so we took two
of<00:00:45.239> them<00:00:45.420> out<00:00:45.780> yesterday<00:00:46.440> i'm<00:00:47.510> actually<00:00:48.510> i'll

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
of them out yesterday i'm actually i'll

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.040 
of them out yesterday i'm actually i'll
open<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.230> draft<00:00:50.449> and<00:00:51.449> you<00:00:51.510> can<00:00:52.500> see<00:00:52.800> a<00:00:53.039> more

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.050 
open the draft and you can see a more

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:58.970 
open the draft and you can see a more
obvious<00:00:55.820> opening<00:00:56.960> where<00:00:57.960> it's<00:00:58.170> very<00:00:58.680> bright

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
obvious opening where it's very bright

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.880 
obvious opening where it's very bright
yellow<00:00:59.480> just<00:01:00.480> to<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.780> right<00:01:00.809> of<00:01:01.199> the

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
yellow just to the right of the

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.410 
yellow just to the right of the
knob<00:01:03.229> and<00:01:04.229> what<00:01:04.500> this<00:01:04.710> does<00:01:05.010> is<00:01:05.370> allow<00:01:06.060> more

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
knob and what this does is allow more

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.420 
knob and what this does is allow more
direct<00:01:06.810> route<00:01:07.050> for<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.409> air<00:01:07.560> to<00:01:07.590> get<00:01:07.950> to<00:01:08.190> the

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
direct route for the air to get to the

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.810 
direct route for the air to get to the
coals<00:01:09.090> and<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.450> wood<00:01:09.950> it's<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.190> stove<00:01:11.460> fire

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
coals and the wood it's the stove fire

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:21.870 
coals and the wood it's the stove fire
up<00:01:12.090> hotter<00:01:12.390> quicker

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:21.880 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.560 

and<00:01:22.119> basically<00:01:23.850> makes<00:01:24.850> the<00:01:24.969> stove<00:01:25.299> more

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570 
and basically makes the stove more

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:30.240 
and basically makes the stove more
responsive<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:28.659> workshop<00:01:28.899> is<00:01:29.409> not<00:01:29.710> heated<00:01:30.100> at

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250 
responsive the workshop is not heated at

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:33.539 
responsive the workshop is not heated at
the<00:01:30.430> during<00:01:31.090> the<00:01:31.210> night<00:01:31.390> time<00:01:32.070> so<00:01:33.070> I<00:01:33.100> come<00:01:33.399> out

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:54.870 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:57.830 

so<00:01:55.500> what<00:01:55.680> I'm<00:01:55.770> going<00:01:55.950> to<00:01:55.980> do<00:01:56.160> is<00:01:56.340> to<00:01:56.720> let<00:01:57.720> it

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
so what I'm going to do is to let it

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.840 
so what I'm going to do is to let it
fire<00:01:58.110> up<00:01:58.140> a<00:01:58.500> bit<00:01:58.740> and<00:01:59.900> then<00:02:00.900> close<00:02:01.200> it<00:02:01.230> down<00:02:01.850> and

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
fire up a bit and then close it down and

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.260 
fire up a bit and then close it down and
what<00:02:03.000> we<00:02:03.120> found<00:02:03.330> was<00:02:03.900> that<00:02:03.960> the<00:02:05.270> secondaries

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
what we found was that the secondaries

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.500 
what we found was that the secondaries
are<00:02:06.560> stronger<00:02:07.560> in<00:02:07.800> almost<00:02:08.310> any<00:02:08.700> setting<00:02:09.330> of

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:09.510 
are stronger in almost any setting of

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:13.630 
are stronger in almost any setting of
the<00:02:09.960> draft<00:02:10.730> because<00:02:11.730> of<00:02:11.880> this<00:02:12.000> increased<00:02:12.600> air

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
the draft because of this increased air

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.200 
the draft because of this increased air
which<00:02:14.640> is<00:02:14.820> basically<00:02:16.220> right<00:02:17.220> there<00:02:17.490> at<00:02:17.760> the

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.210 
which is basically right there at the

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:22.700 
which is basically right there at the
bottom<00:02:18.950> of<00:02:19.950> your<00:02:20.040> picture<00:02:21.530> right<00:02:22.530> in<00:02:22.620> the

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
bottom of your picture right in the

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:30.770 
bottom of your picture right in the
center

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.460 

you<00:02:31.200> can<00:02:31.380> see<00:02:31.560> some<00:02:31.830> secondary<00:02:32.430> activity<00:02:33.470> both

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
you can see some secondary activity both

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.380 
you can see some secondary activity both
on<00:02:34.770> the<00:02:34.920> right<00:02:35.130> and<00:02:35.400> the<00:02:35.550> left<00:02:35.580> of<00:02:36.030> the<00:02:36.120> box

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
on the right and the left of the box

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:45.770 
on the right and the left of the box
beam<00:02:38.270> focus<00:02:39.270> in<00:02:39.569> a<00:02:39.600> little<00:02:40.140> bit<00:02:44.750> close<00:02:45.750> that

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
beam focus in a little bit close that

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.090 
beam focus in a little bit close that
down<00:02:46.260> all<00:02:46.590> the<00:02:46.770> way<00:02:47.239> and<00:02:48.239> the<00:02:49.069> secondaries<00:02:50.069> are

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
down all the way and the secondaries are

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.970 
down all the way and the secondaries are
much<00:02:50.430> more<00:02:50.670> obvious<00:02:51.380> with<00:02:52.380> the<00:02:52.410> flames<00:02:52.830> going

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
much more obvious with the flames going

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.570 
much more obvious with the flames going
horizontally<00:02:56.930> crossways<00:02:57.930> left<00:02:58.440> and<00:02:58.770> right<00:02:59.280> of

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
horizontally crossways left and right of

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.240 
horizontally crossways left and right of
the<00:02:59.760> center<00:03:00.030> mounted<00:03:00.480> box<00:03:00.750> beam<00:03:01.250> they

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
the center mounted box beam they

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.020 
the center mounted box beam they
actually<00:03:02.430> start<00:03:03.030> to<00:03:03.090> wrap<00:03:03.390> around<00:03:03.630> the<00:03:04.019> barrel

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
actually start to wrap around the barrel

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:09.760 
actually start to wrap around the barrel
which<00:03:06.030> is<00:03:06.209> kind<00:03:06.480> of<00:03:06.570> neat

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:09.770 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:11.950 

speaking<00:03:10.670> of<00:03:10.790> which<00:03:11.030> the<00:03:11.270> barrel<00:03:11.540> had<00:03:11.720> very

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:11.960 
speaking of which the barrel had very

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:15.580 
speaking of which the barrel had very
hot<00:03:12.230> a<00:03:12.260> few<00:03:12.560> minutes<00:03:12.800> ago<00:03:13.070> I<00:03:14.260> can<00:03:15.260> measure<00:03:15.410> it

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
through the box beam it's just

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.729 
through the box beam it's just
sustaining<00:03:50.730> the<00:03:51.390> secondary<00:03:51.959> flames<00:03:52.319> very

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739 
sustaining the secondary flames very
