Navi so what are you trying to do
was<00:05:22.590> to<00:05:22.710> turn<00:05:22.740> enhance<00:05:23.160> it<00:05:23.759> and<00:05:23.970> listen<00:05:24.270> to

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:32.840 

I<00:05:30.600> think<00:05:31.350> he's<00:05:31.470> gone<00:05:31.650> a<00:05:31.710> bit<00:05:31.770> overboard<00:05:31.920> to<00:05:32.760> be

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:32.850 
I think he's gone a bit overboard to be

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:35.660 
I think he's gone a bit overboard to be
honest<00:05:33.360> too<00:05:34.290> much<00:05:34.530> wastegate<00:05:35.220> too<00:05:35.490> much

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:35.670 
honest too much wastegate too much

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:38.950 
honest too much wastegate too much
