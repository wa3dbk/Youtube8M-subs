okay<00:00:01.850> so<00:00:02.850> many<00:00:03.000> resources<00:00:03.389> me<00:00:04.110> water<00:00:04.680> or

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890 
okay so many resources me water or

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.490 
okay so many resources me water or
clocking<00:00:05.370> the<00:00:05.490> grass<00:00:05.730> or<00:00:05.940> means<00:00:06.210> and<00:00:06.899> how<00:00:07.170> it

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
clocking the grass or means and how it

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:08.480 
clocking the grass or means and how it
can<00:00:07.710> be<00:00:07.890> achieved

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
can be achieved

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.020 
can be achieved
so<00:00:09.320> here<00:00:10.320> you<00:00:10.500> see<00:00:10.530> in<00:00:11.040> this<00:00:11.429> mobile<00:00:11.700> six

around<00:00:49.110> so<00:00:49.590> we<00:00:50.219> can<00:00:50.399> all<00:00:50.579> clock<00:00:50.820> it<00:00:51.090> just

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
around so we can all clock it just

the applications to run smoothly and I

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.170 
the applications to run smoothly and I
will<00:00:59.129> show<00:00:59.370> you<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.640> your<00:00:59.789> client

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
will show you the your client

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.929 
will show you the your client
application<00:01:00.629> I'm<00:01:00.719> about<00:01:01.170> at<00:01:01.289> home<00:01:02.420> perhaps

00:01:04.929 --> 00:01:04.939 
application I'm about at home perhaps

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:08.179

okay<00:01:05.939> here<00:01:06.180> is<00:01:06.330> your<00:01:06.360> lab<00:01:06.930> happily<00:01:07.290> dome<00:01:08.040> at

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
okay here is your lab happily dome at

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.960 
okay here is your lab happily dome at
the<00:01:08.310> clock<00:01:08.520> class<00:01:09.530> so<00:01:10.530> yeah<00:01:11.130> once<00:01:11.430> you<00:01:11.670> install

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
the clock class so yeah once you install

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.990 
the clock class so yeah once you install
on<00:01:12.090> that<00:01:12.270> clock<00:01:12.540> bus<00:01:12.810> you<00:01:13.200> see<00:01:14.720> you<00:01:15.720> see<00:01:17.000> when

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
on that clock bus you see you see when

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.460 
on that clock bus you see you see when
you<00:01:18.119> open<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.479> format<00:01:18.750> clock<00:01:19.020> less<00:01:19.229> you'll

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
you open the format clock less you'll

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.539 
you open the format clock less you'll
see<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:19.830> screen<00:01:20.189> so<00:01:20.900> holiday<00:01:21.900> to<00:01:21.990> do<00:01:22.200> is

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:22.549 
see the screen so holiday to do is

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:26.749 
see the screen so holiday to do is
select<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:23.759> clock<00:01:24.770> in<00:01:25.770> my<00:01:25.799> case<00:01:26.250> this<00:01:26.520> is<00:01:26.580> a

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
select the clock in my case this is a

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.569 
select the clock in my case this is a
similar<00:01:27.180> to<00:01:27.299> 125<00:01:27.869> and<00:01:27.900> something<00:01:28.799> on<00:01:28.920> to<00:01:29.100> 50<00:01:29.430> to

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
similar to 125 and something on to 50 to

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.410 
similar to 125 and something on to 50 to
60<00:01:30.030> is<00:01:30.619> suggested<00:01:31.619> if<00:01:32.490> your<00:01:32.729> clock<00:01:32.970> it<00:01:33.119> to<00:01:33.270> more

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
60 is suggested if your clock it to more

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.999 
60 is suggested if your clock it to more
than<00:01:33.570> time<00:01:33.840> then<00:01:34.170> there<00:01:34.409> might<00:01:34.560> be<00:01:34.619> serious

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
than time then there might be serious

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.200 
than time then there might be serious
issues<00:01:35.600> so<00:01:36.600> here<00:01:37.320> I<00:01:37.380> set<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:37.860> to<00:01:37.979> 52<00:01:38.850> 52

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
issues so here I set the to 52 52

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.679 
issues so here I set the to 52 52
megahertz<00:01:39.780> and<00:01:40.200> I<00:01:40.439> click<00:01:40.650> on<00:01:40.829> register<00:01:41.689> and

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
megahertz and I click on register and

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.990 
megahertz and I click on register and
it's<00:01:42.990> not<00:01:43.229> static<00:01:43.409> folder<00:01:43.979> so<00:01:44.540> subset<00:01:45.540> it

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
it's not static folder so subset it

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.510 
it's not static folder so subset it
it'll<00:01:49.009> automatically<00:01:50.009> work<00:01:50.250> on<00:01:50.399> the

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
it'll automatically work on the

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.490 
it'll automatically work on the
processor<00:01:50.880> as<00:01:51.060> soon<00:01:51.240> as<00:01:51.390> you<00:01:51.570> reboot<00:01:52.470> your

processor as soon as you reboot your

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:58.490 
processor as soon as you reboot your
phone<00:01:53.090> so<00:01:54.090> I'll<00:01:54.390> click<00:01:54.630> on<00:01:54.689> accept<00:01:55.259> and<00:01:57.500> then

phone so I'll click on accept and then
here<00:01:58.920> you<00:01:58.950> go<00:01:59.360> so<00:02:00.360> to<00:02:00.509> 60<00:02:00.899> megahertz<00:02:01.140> processor

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 
here you go so to 60 megahertz processor

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.410 
here you go so to 60 megahertz processor
it<00:02:03.360> really<00:02:03.810> is<00:02:04.670> that's<00:02:05.670> what<00:02:05.939> since<00:02:06.149> the

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
it really is that's what since the
