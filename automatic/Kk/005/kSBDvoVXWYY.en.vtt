light not sunlight but bright light and

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.999 
light not sunlight but bright light and
constantly<00:01:50.310> check<00:01:50.640> maybe<00:01:50.880> in<00:01:51.420> in<00:01:52.350> three<00:01:52.829> days

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
constantly check maybe in in three days

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.590 
constantly check maybe in in three days
and<00:01:53.460> see<00:01:53.640> if<00:01:53.700> it<00:01:53.850> start<00:01:54.149> to<00:01:54.509> root<00:01:56.060> or<00:01:57.060> maybe<00:01:57.299> a

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
and see if it start to root or maybe a

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.310 
and see if it start to root or maybe a
week<00:01:57.960> it<00:01:58.229> depends<00:01:58.649> so<00:01:58.679> constantly<00:01:59.429> check<00:02:00.320> then

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
week it depends so constantly check then

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.740 
week it depends so constantly check then
once<00:02:01.950> it's<00:02:02.460> rooted<00:02:02.820> then<00:02:03.030> go<00:02:03.240> ahead<00:02:03.299> and<00:02:03.539> plant

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
once it's rooted then go ahead and plant

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.180 
once it's rooted then go ahead and plant
it<00:02:03.899> and<00:02:05.719> my<00:02:06.719> suggestion<00:02:07.140> is<00:02:07.409> the<00:02:07.649> water<00:02:07.890> planet

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190

and<00:02:08.520> keep<00:02:08.730> it<00:02:08.820> inside<00:02:09.120> for<00:02:09.450> a<00:02:09.480> while

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
and keep it inside for a while

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.120 
and keep it inside for a while
