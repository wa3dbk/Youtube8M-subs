00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:05.070
 hello how about very good guys 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.950
 welcome is November and the game 

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:10.290
 the Lord of the Rings came and we're 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.930
 with a new release of bricks from 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.120
 lego red very well for this blocking 

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:19.539
 let's go to the map 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:22.119
 and right now we're going to go 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:24.520
 not until the passage of skulls to see 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:26.740
 where do i have it 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:28.990
 when a little clueless as it does 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:30.940
 a long time that no game is worth here 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:33.670
 we have the stone of the map of the step of 

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:37.720
 boilers and we have to go to the 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:42.670
 interrogation that very well so let's go 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:45.750
 there goes to the great and we are here we are going to 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.750
 get with legolas 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:51.110
 so let's go then much faster 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:54.410
 let's go back to our map 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:57.230
 and we mark the destination towards this 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:01:00.140
 interrogation very well here has 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:04.989
 marked the path of coins so 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:07.450
 we have to go back to a whole 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:09.659
 since this was the map stone more 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:12.569
 near 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.850
 to this secondary mention with which what 

00:01:12.569 --> 00:01:18.840
 let's find our brick 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:21.319
 red ego I fell good nothing happens 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.319
 we continue 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:27.870
 very good guys, the idea is 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:32.250
 finish the series and then the lord of 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:35.280
 the rings' that I had inactive already 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:38.420
 I had not uploaded more videos 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:42.659
 and I do not want to leave any game 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:45.690
 incomplete and for this reason because these 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:48.590
 days there will be more videos followed by 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:48.590
 this game 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:56.760
 so very well let's get to 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:58.770
 sam let's use the effective rope 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:02.120
 and now we put on legolas and 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:05.900
 we shoot an arrow there effectively 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:05.900
 can stick some jumps 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.729
 and another one around here very well here we are going to 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:14.460
 find 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:18.240
 a brick of meters 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:22.370
 He had already caught it before but good 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.370
 here we have a violet coin 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:29.030
 ok we have to follow the path that 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:34.240
 we had marked before 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:34.240
 and continue here you are already seeing it 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:39.459
 the truth is that I'm going to say easier 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:42.970
 cross the east river but for some reason 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:45.519
 do not leave us here we have a the one 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:49.209
 candadito of these and we have to 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:51.010
 destroy it very well we live from the 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:55.540
 step of cheeks we walked around 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:57.040
 here and finally as we arrived 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:00.250
 right now we need to break the 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:03.459
 candadito that that and we put then 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:05.760
 with fireworks from my 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:05.760
 thriller 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:11.850
 there is 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:14.280
 It's great, we've broken that candadito already 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:16.190
 see let's talk with this character to 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:20.319
 see what it says 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:22.909
 in this matter I in the final 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:25.680
 between you 

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:27.859
 I need a musical horn from me 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.859
 thrill 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:36.760
 that by the way we had forged before 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:39.159
 and we already have it among our treasures 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:42.489
 let's see where is we go to our 

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:45.040
 treasures and we have it here and here we have 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:47.409
 the musical horn of the subway 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.330
 very well let's make it work a 

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:52.200
 little bit 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:52.200
 there we are 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:04:00.430
 Let's stop fooling around 

00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:03.640
 and we will give it to you there 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:05.870
 and here we have our ego brick 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:09.360
 Red 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:11.040
 let's buy it and it's called disguises 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.950
 of boss is this brick and we can 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:18.329
 buy it for 100 thousand coins or pieces 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:20.849
 of lego very well there we have it 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:24.979
 worth the truth is that this brick of 

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:24.979
 Red ego is not very good for what it is 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:29.250
 and I want you to leave it to me in the 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:32.190
 comments 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:35.230
 I've been trying to shut it down pretty 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:37.490
 but I do not know how it works 

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:40.550
 I thought that 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:42.410
 he was going to put on some disguise or something like that 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:45.740
 boss costumes the ego brick 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:48.650
 red number 3 and we put that yes there what 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:50.780
 you have but this increase I do not know how 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:52.550
 it works and well I wanted you to 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:54.229

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:56.210
