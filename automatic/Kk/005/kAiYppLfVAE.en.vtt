00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.499
This is the Azubu team house in Chungnam.

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.000
We have nine players and three coaches,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.500
so twelve people live here in total.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
We train in two four-hour sessions.

00:00:27.001 --> 00:00:29.000
A total of eight hours each day.

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.200
After that, the players are free to do what they want.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.500
The players decide what to do with their free time,

00:00:35.501 --> 00:00:38.000
but many of them choose to train more.

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.001
I never got to experience college life,

00:00:46.001 --> 00:00:48.300
but there are advantages to being a pro gamer.

00:00:48.301 --> 00:00:52.300
I earned good money at a young age,

00:00:52.301 --> 00:00:55.700
and make a living doing what I love.

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.700
A lot more work goes into it than people think.

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.700
Because the level of competition is so high,

00:01:06.701 --> 00:01:09.700
we must constantly train harder.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.800
We have a housemaid who helps

00:01:19.801 --> 00:01:24.800
take care of the cooking, cleaning, and laundry.

00:01:24.801 --> 00:01:29.800
But because she's here, it allows us to stay focused.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:43.800
They don't really like fish, they like meat.

00:01:43.801 --> 00:01:46.800
So, I prepare a lot of meat.

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.500
We become better players while eating delicious food,

00:01:54.501 --> 00:01:56.400
and that's great because if we had to cook

00:01:56.401 --> 00:01:58.000
it would taste awful!

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.500
Teammates really help.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000
When I play alone I can get lost in my head.

00:02:14.001 --> 00:02:18.000
If that happens and I get stuck,

00:02:18.001 --> 00:02:21.000
discussing it with my team really helps.

00:02:21.001 --> 00:02:24.000
It makes solving problems easier and those aspects really help.

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.200
For the past year, several of the team members

00:02:31.201 --> 00:02:34.200
did well in league matches.

00:02:34.201 --> 00:02:37.200
It was fun watching us rise, but the pressure

00:02:37.201 --> 00:02:40.200
for us to perform has recently become more intense.

00:02:40.201 --> 00:02:43.200
When you start as a rookie you don't have that pressure.

00:02:43.201 --> 00:02:47.200
You don't quite know what to expect.

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.500
We didn't do as well as we'd expected to this year,

00:02:51.501 --> 00:02:56.500
but next year I have high hopes for them to win.
