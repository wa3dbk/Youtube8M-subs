00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:32.640
 coloring books here's a wonderful garden but to 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.410
 Unfortunately, it was not possible to do this 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.489

 Irina Irinku beads for what she 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:49.350
 agreed and was ready to help me 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.350
 but they are destiny so not destiny but anyway 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:55.949
 I am very grateful that she is from cry 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:59.070
 responded to my request here and so 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:03.379
 so I found the equivalent of these books 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:06.510
 in Russia we have this art therapy given 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:09.030
 Here on this book did the review 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.310
 Elena color that is she already I bought you 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.460
 could see her who subscribed to her 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.140
 a link to this video I will leave and so 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:21.000
 I'll leave the link to the channel 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:24.409
 Irinki that's it, but I'm so quick 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:29.490
 leafing through here in black and white 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:32.009
 illustrations are very funny i am very 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:35.520
 I looked at this book for a long time 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:37.890
 very, very much and the site 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.820
 the maze where I bought this book was 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.409
 announcement for two more books 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:46.680
 natural and ordered they were by 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:48.570
 pre-order and from pre-order if 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.630
 memory serves me I waited two or 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:55.800
 three weeks well in general i said and 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:02:00.650
 other books and here they are 1 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:04.140
 by the way I liked it more than 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:10.020
 previous here too but this is the way 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:14.190
 the book is more like a wonderful garden by 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:17.790
 pictures, but there seems to be more 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:24.150
 pictures similar than in the previous one 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:26.510
 this with chanterelle you butterflies that is here 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.950
 You can not only decorate but also 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.870
 I unfortunately do not know 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.580
 a wonderful garden you can finish there 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:37.350
 Pictures 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:42.200
 Well, I hope the girls will write here and also 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:50.550
 enchanted forest also I do nâ€™t know how 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:53.250
 inside here so it is made clear what a lion 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:57.120
 right on the whole spread very 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:03:01.620
 beautiful and the third book 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:05.280
 But is it with such a color? 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:08.489
 therapy honestly a little bit not that 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:10.950
 disappointed did not like this book 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:13.010
 and now I will explain why if 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:19.530
 previous mainly contours on 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:22.410
 illustrations are black then meet here 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:28.140
 colored outline and here you can see 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:30.750
 red forests yes there is a very 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:34.650
 many small details it is clear here 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:41.180
 a bear here can be red, he 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:44.220
 labor and place to finish and here 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:46.709
 it will be inconvenient to paint with pencils 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:50.130
 here you can see this 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:53.490
 Peppers background is so dark brown and 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:58.260
 black and a little bit it confuses me 

00:03:53.490 --> 00:04:01.900
 here's a flamenco dancer and 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:03.910
 here about each color what is written but 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.530
 maybe someone likes color 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:11.050
 contour now I wanted to find 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:14.920
 picture show that straight right here 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:26.620
 eyes they rush very well here 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:30.310
 such here you can see yes here such 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:32.590
 contour and but its really crayons neither 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:35.710
 once painting coloring only or 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:41.350
 pen even seems to me a marker 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:44.010
 it will work but I'm not upset with me 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:46.690
 This book even like it very much 

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:49.420
 consider just not painted 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:56.970
 because so many details are interesting 

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:56.970
 very much to watch and what to say though 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:05.270
 here and even 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:07.360
 Well, so much that I have two of them 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:11.330
 daughter I have a whole life ahead so that 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:14.480
 for the next maybe two or three years we 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:17.060
 let's paint them like that 

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:19.940
 the book I wanted to show you who 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:23.060
 Interesting references all look under 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:25.780
 video and thanks for watching until the following 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:25.780
 video bye
