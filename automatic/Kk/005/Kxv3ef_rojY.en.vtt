00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.269
 bye 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:20.240
 williams 

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:23.060
 obviously the green ones rained the 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:25.369
 itv 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:28.580
 very good we are in the fibo 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:30.259
 2014 with jonathan reverte that such state 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:32.629
 it's not very good here to work a 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:34.730
 What do you think about the fair of 

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:36.620
 this year very good very big very nice 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.960
 a lot of atmosphere and I guess tomorrow 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:41.989
 there will be more at what age you started 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.370
 train because instead of 17 years old to 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:45.589
 root of an accident 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.370
 I had six months and the wheels from 

00:00:45.589 --> 00:00:49.339
 there you have to start making a 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:51.500
 rehabilitation in the gym and I 

00:00:49.339 --> 00:00:54.379
 they visit all look and I think it has been 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.930
 recovered very well another little question 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:59.600
 also what I wanted to do to stay would be 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:02.299
 convenient to start to try to get there 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.890
 to the elite all ages are good 

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:05.449
 I believe that from the age of 14 a 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:08.960
 kid can start training always 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:11.150
 with a head but if you like it because you do not 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.409
 start and there you will go far with obstacles 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.770
 in the passes more muscle quality 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:14.770
 get 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.159
 best physicist will get it all after 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:21.380
 depends on physical desire the 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:22.760
 labor intensity , of course, 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.100
 Will 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:27.040
 very well when you realized that 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:30.410
 you could go far in this seriously 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:32.620
 well I realized the 2010 that by 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:35.810
 those came to me came the 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:37.580
 pre-selection of fb europe the first time 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.940
 I am presenting me a preselection me 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:43.730
 they selected and I was runner-up Europe 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:45.950
 He was still a child and it was a surprise 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:48.680
 because they are going to plead there were more than 35 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.990
 competitors on the stage and there I stayed 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:53.510
 second there people also talk about 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:56.270
 you listen and well I thought I could 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:57.650
 become something that's why I fight a very 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.570
 good position based on effort and 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:01.130
 perseverance very good post good 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:03.260
 after that changing him arnold 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.180
 classic 2013 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:09.350
 runner - up of the olympic arno for 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:11.510
 have 2010-2011 well and genetics arrives 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:13.010
 to be important in genetics is 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.350
 important to be able to create or build 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.030
 muscular lines also send a lot 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:18.200
 there but good while the work there 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.209
 a good point 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.430
 it also counts going out with the point of the 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:24.470
 muscle mass everything there are no fields 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.850
 muscle if you have not worked so much 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.610
 upstairs working under the legs 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:30.290

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.320
 part of the front leg but the 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.390
 Buttocks forget they forget about 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:38.030
 twins forget about shoulders 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:40.460
 they have to always look for the fault, not what 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:43.220
 How beautiful I have the breast but bad 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:45.320
 I have the shoulder to work it 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.210

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:49.310

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:52.760
