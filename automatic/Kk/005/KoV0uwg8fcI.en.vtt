millimeter<00:03:33.940> auxiliary<00:03:34.239> cable<00:03:35.080> which<00:03:35.680> is

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:35.739 
millimeter auxiliary cable which is

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:37.890 
millimeter auxiliary cable which is
basically<00:03:36.520> the<00:03:36.820> male-to-male<00:03:37.330> now<00:03:37.630> it<00:03:37.750> does

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:37.900 
basically the male-to-male now it does

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:39.780 
basically the male-to-male now it does
have<00:03:37.930> some<00:03:38.350> sort<00:03:38.530> of<00:03:38.620> a<00:03:38.770> clot<00:03:39.040> material<00:03:39.610> around

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
have some sort of a clot material around

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:41.250 
have some sort of a clot material around
it<00:03:40.030> so<00:03:40.180> I<00:03:40.239> guess<00:03:40.420> it's<00:03:40.570> gonna<00:03:40.660> be<00:03:40.840> a<00:03:40.870> little<00:03:41.050> bit

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
it so I guess it's gonna be a little bit

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.830 
it so I guess it's gonna be a little bit
more<00:03:41.470> durable<00:03:41.800> than<00:03:42.459> Robert<00:03:43.090> but<00:03:43.510> that<00:03:43.660> being

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.840 
more durable than Robert but that being

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.199 
more durable than Robert but that being
said<00:03:43.930> here<00:03:44.709> inside<00:03:45.040> the<00:03:45.190> box<00:03:45.430> we<00:03:45.640> have<00:03:45.670> nothing

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:46.209 
said here inside the box we have nothing

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:47.729 
said here inside the box we have nothing
else<00:03:46.660> so<00:03:46.959> let's<00:03:47.080> go<00:03:47.260> ahead<00:03:47.320> and<00:03:47.500> put<00:03:47.650> this

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:47.739 
else so let's go ahead and put this

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:50.220 
else so let's go ahead and put this
aside<00:03:47.920> and<00:03:48.310> get<00:03:48.459> back<00:03:48.640> into<00:03:48.880> this<00:03:49.090> beaker<00:03:49.480> and

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230 
aside and get back into this beaker and

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:52.020 
aside and get back into this beaker and
here<00:03:50.620> as<00:03:50.800> we<00:03:50.980> can<00:03:51.100> see<00:03:51.340> we<00:03:51.519> have<00:03:51.670> the<00:03:51.820> speaker

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
here as we can see we have the speaker

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:53.520 
here as we can see we have the speaker
itself<00:03:52.480> let's<00:03:52.780> go<00:03:52.870> ahead<00:03:52.930> and<00:03:53.140> remove<00:03:53.230> it<00:03:53.500> from

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 
itself let's go ahead and remove it from

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.160 
itself let's go ahead and remove it from
this<00:03:53.860> plastic<00:03:54.459> protector<00:03:55.030> around<00:03:55.180> it<00:03:55.630> now

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:56.170 
this plastic protector around it now

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:58.110 
this plastic protector around it now
here<00:03:56.350> we<00:03:56.500> have<00:03:56.530> the<00:03:56.680> Bose<00:03:57.010> speaker<00:03:57.459> itself<00:03:57.850> we

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:05.830 
very front on the side it's gonna have

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:08.790 
very front on the side it's gonna have
just<00:04:06.160> the<00:04:06.540> subwoofers<00:04:07.540> so<00:04:08.260> you<00:04:08.350> can<00:04:08.470> see<00:04:08.620> here

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:08.800 
just the subwoofers so you can see here

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.170 
just the subwoofers so you can see here
they<00:04:08.920> kind<00:04:09.070> of<00:04:09.190> move<00:04:09.340> a<00:04:09.459> little<00:04:09.610> bit<00:04:09.790> on<00:04:10.030> the

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180 
they kind of move a little bit on the

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:11.430 
they kind of move a little bit on the
right<00:04:10.300> side<00:04:10.570> it's<00:04:10.720> gonna<00:04:10.810> be<00:04:10.989> the<00:04:11.110> same<00:04:11.320> as

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:11.440 
right side it's gonna be the same as

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:12.930 
right side it's gonna be the same as
scenario<00:04:11.860> and<00:04:12.280> we<00:04:12.400> can<00:04:12.519> see<00:04:12.670> here<00:04:12.850> it<00:04:12.910> does

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:12.940 
scenario and we can see here it does

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:15.240 
scenario and we can see here it does

00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:17.169 
this is going to be aluminum and it's

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:19.080 
this is going to be aluminum and it's
super<00:04:17.650> solid<00:04:17.950> guys<00:04:18.340> here<00:04:18.640> in<00:04:18.700> the<00:04:18.790> very<00:04:18.970> bottom

slipping around now here just to compare
I<00:04:27.700> have<00:04:27.910> once<00:04:28.210> again<00:04:28.480> the<00:04:28.660> Bose<00:04:29.100> Soundlink

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:30.100 
I have once again the Bose Soundlink

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:31.950 
I have once again the Bose Soundlink
mini<00:04:30.220> and<00:04:30.610> we<00:04:30.700> can<00:04:30.850> compare<00:04:31.240> the<00:04:31.360> actual<00:04:31.510> size

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:31.960 
mini and we can compare the actual size

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:33.990 
mini and we can compare the actual size
of<00:04:32.110> them<00:04:32.289> I<00:04:32.500> mean<00:04:33.010> it's<00:04:33.280> not<00:04:33.430> really<00:04:33.640> humongous

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.000 
of them I mean it's not really humongous

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.360 
of them I mean it's not really humongous
except<00:04:34.630> for<00:04:34.840> the<00:04:34.930> height<00:04:35.620> of<00:04:35.890> the

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:36.370 
except for the height of the

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:37.920 
except for the height of the
we<00:04:36.639> can<00:04:36.790> see<00:04:36.970> here<00:04:37.210> that<00:04:37.360> the<00:04:37.480> Boles<00:04:37.720> is<00:04:37.900> a

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:37.930 
we can see here that the Boles is a

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:40.620 
we can see here that the Boles is a
little<00:04:38.230> bit<00:04:38.350> taller<00:04:38.650> but<00:04:39.040> on<00:04:39.910> the<00:04:40.419> width

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:40.630 
little bit taller but on the width

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:43.379 
little bit taller but on the width
they're<00:04:41.290> almost<00:04:41.500> the<00:04:41.919> same<00:04:41.949> and<00:04:42.490> on<00:04:43.030> the<00:04:43.150> depth

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:43.389 
they're almost the same and on the depth

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:45.330 
they're almost the same and on the depth
we<00:04:43.810> can<00:04:43.840> notice<00:04:44.230> that<00:04:44.260> the<00:04:44.470> balls<00:04:44.680> is<00:04:44.949> a<00:04:44.979> little

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:45.340 
we can notice that the balls is a little

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.159 
we can notice that the balls is a little
bit<00:04:45.460> deeper<00:04:45.610> it's<00:04:46.060> about<00:04:46.270> three<00:04:46.540> inches<00:04:46.570> and

bit deeper it's about three inches and
the<00:04:47.680> Bose<00:04:47.889> Soundlink<00:04:48.370> mean<00:04:48.610> it's<00:04:48.729> gonna<00:04:48.850> be

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:49.000 
the Bose Soundlink mean it's gonna be

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000 
the Bose Soundlink mean it's gonna be
about<00:04:49.090> two<00:04:49.479> inches<00:04:49.900> or<00:04:50.139> almost<00:04:50.710> two<00:04:50.830> inches
