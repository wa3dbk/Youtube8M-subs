00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
elevator that I just honestly just

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.770

noticed<00:01:57.840> after<00:01:57.990> I<00:01:58.259> played<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:58.710> game<00:01:59.600> this<00:02:00.600> is

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
noticed after I played the game this is

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.630 
noticed after I played the game this is
I<00:02:01.020> guess<00:02:01.350> it's<00:02:01.740> pretty<00:02:01.920> good<00:02:02.219> if<00:02:02.399> you're<00:02:02.520> just

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
I guess it's pretty good if you're just

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:03.889 
I guess it's pretty good if you're just
trying<00:02:02.909> to<00:02:02.969> run<00:02:03.090> away<00:02:03.119> from<00:02:03.299> somebody<00:02:03.840> just

everybody tends to go to is the building
the<00:02:49.410> building<00:02:49.740> seems<00:02:50.010> to<00:02:50.190> be<00:02:50.340> where<00:02:50.610> everybody

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
the building seems to be where everybody

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:52.940 
the building seems to be where everybody
like<00:02:51.660> we're<00:02:51.870> all<00:02:51.990> the<00:02:52.170> battling<00:02:52.560> goes<00:02:52.770> on

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
like we're all the battling goes on

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.230 
like we're all the battling goes on
everybody<00:02:53.370> tends<00:02:53.610> to<00:02:53.730> fight<00:02:53.940> for<00:02:54.150> that

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:54.240 
everybody tends to fight for that

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:57.170 
everybody tends to fight for that
building<00:02:54.950> so<00:02:55.950> that's<00:02:56.220> where<00:02:56.430> that's<00:02:56.790> mainly

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
building so that's where that's mainly

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.100 
building so that's where that's mainly
where<00:02:57.810> everybody<00:02:58.110> goes<00:02:58.320> to<00:02:59.450> which<00:03:00.450> gives<00:03:00.960> it<00:03:01.020> a

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
where everybody goes to which gives it a

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:04.880 
where everybody goes to which gives it a
little<00:03:01.230> bit<00:03:01.410> of<00:03:01.470> challenge<00:03:01.680> I<00:03:01.920> guess<00:03:03.890> but

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
little bit of challenge I guess but

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:06.980 
little bit of challenge I guess but
yards<00:03:05.220> named<00:03:05.430> it's<00:03:05.580> a<00:03:05.640> pretty<00:03:05.850> badly<00:03:06.150> beat<00:03:06.600> I

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:06.990 
yards named it's a pretty badly beat I

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:09.530 
yards named it's a pretty badly beat I
think<00:03:07.560> we<00:03:07.650> lost<00:03:07.770> like<00:03:08.070> 52<00:03:08.580> like<00:03:08.730> 37<00:03:09.420> or

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
think we lost like 52 like 37 or

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.650 
think we lost like 52 like 37 or
something<00:03:09.780> like<00:03:09.900> that<00:03:09.960> it<00:03:10.230> was<00:03:10.350> pretty<00:03:10.500> bad

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:11.660 
something like that it was pretty bad

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:15.800
