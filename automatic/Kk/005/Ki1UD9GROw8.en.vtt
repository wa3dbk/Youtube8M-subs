00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.549
 hi to all in this video I you 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.500
 shows if original way to reuse 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.400
 simple aluminum cans for 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.900
 you out of critical situations 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.519
 if you subscribe to my videos you 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.049
 there is a risk of recognizing 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.630
 projects that I have already presented 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.010
 but do not worry because in all 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.109
 If I show you the news 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.199
 ways to recycle cans that 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:27.210
 you will surely be useful the first 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:31.769
 project is to make a candle with 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:33.090
 vegetable oil and paper for 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:37.040
 this is very much a sheet of paper 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.040
 toilet that will serve as wick 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:48.540
 then put the wick in the can 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.670
 and poured oil making sure 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:52.910
 that wick a most deal bib 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.910
 possible 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:04.620
 I made a video on different 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:06.510
 ways to make candles in 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:07.410
 urgent situations and with 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.840
 everyday products 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:12.810
 among which there is a box of tuna 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.580
 an orange creates cheese 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.860
 I will put the link of the video in the 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:21.000
 information so feel free to throw 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.860
 at a glance the second way 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.180
 to use a can for survival 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.180
 is to start a fire 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.820
 for that you will have to polish well 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:33.900
 the base of the can with straw 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:35.729
 iron or cia then take a 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.950
 Tinder is focused the sun's rays 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.420
 in one point 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.760
 I specify that this method is not 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.590
 easy requires a lot of patience but 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:47.400
 especially it considers that there is strong 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:49.680
 light rays the third way 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.000
 consists in making a stove that 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.760
 walk to alcohol from 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.900
 only cans 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:57.550
 so you do not waste time 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.360
 I did not show all the steps of 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:00.340
 the making 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.530
 but know that I was 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.290
 video that explains the achievement of this 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.880
 hot in detail 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.710
 so for those who are interested who 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.080
 have not already seen the video I you 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:12.940
 invite to watch the link will be 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:16.960
 also put in the information in 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:18.970
 below the video to explain 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:20.440
 briefly would be hot is entirely 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:24.000
 made from cans 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:26.590
 he walks on alcohol he is reusable 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.710
 of stoves is perfect for 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:32.150
 bivouacs and for walks in the forest 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:34.280
 the fourth way to use a 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.110
 bobbin and use it as a 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:39.340
 containers for boiling water 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.340
 or leather a little food 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:46.030
 were not starting to mark the height 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.030
 wanted from your container 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:57.290
 then take a cutter or a chisel and 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:59.510
 cut your can your container is 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.490
 now ready and to improve it I 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:04.870
 decided to add sleeves for 

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:04.870
 can use it as a task 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:11.230
 to make the mans this I just 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.230
 cut the outline of a can 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:17.360
 you really do not need the 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:22.850
 handle to use this container I 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:24.440
 just wanted to see what that gives with 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:27.350
 those six plans you can boil 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.970
 of water so decontaminate what 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:32.110
 you will be really helpful when you 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:35.000
 find in a critical situation 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:37.220
 you can even put the container on 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:44.120
 stoves previously manufactured because 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:46.160
 he feels box the fifth way 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:48.800
 to use a can and by the 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:50.390
 making a survival hook for 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:52.460
 this project or fed in fact not need 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:56.270
 of can is in itself but of the 

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:57.860
 capsule so that the video is not 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:59.540
 rolling I also did not detail 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:02.480
 the manufacturing process for this 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:03.980
 project but I would also put the 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.400
 video link that explains everything in 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:08.020
 detail 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.020
 if you are interested 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:22.079
 the sixth and last project presented 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:24.389
 in this video is the following plot 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:26.250
 a country at the center of the bobbin 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:26.760
 cut out this letter using a 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:40.290
 knife 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:41.880
 a sculptor or sig is lit 

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:44.310
 then a candle inside the 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:47.280
 bobbin there is light released by that 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:50.450
 it could be reflected on the surface 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:50.450
 aluminum can 

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:54.990
 this method makes it possible to obtain a 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.880
 week illuminate more important and you 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:58.169
 can even directed light in 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:04.500
 moving the two doors between 

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:05.970
 quotes a last tip that I 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:08.130
 gives you if you do not want to lose the 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:10.169
 candle wax and cut the base 

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:12.870
 of a can is to arrange the candle 

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:15.060
 on this one with this method you 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:17.750
 will be able to harvest the melted wax and the 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:17.750
 reuse 

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:21.509
 here is the video is over I hope that 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:24.050
 some of these sludge projects are 

00:05:21.509 --> 00:05:26.520
 useful one day or the other 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:28.229
 however the real purpose of this video 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:30.030
 was to show you that survival 

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:33.389
 depended a lot on improvisation 

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:36.030
 and the imagination in a situation 

00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:38.009
 criticism every object has militated and that's 

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:40.569
 it's up to you to think about using this 

00:05:38.009 --> 00:05:42.580
 object as needed 

00:05:40.569 --> 00:05:44.110
 of course if you know of others 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:45.610
 ways to use these cans 

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:48.309
 do not hesitate to write them on 

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:50.969
 comments and by then I'm telling you to 

00:05:48.309 --> 00:05:50.969
 the next
