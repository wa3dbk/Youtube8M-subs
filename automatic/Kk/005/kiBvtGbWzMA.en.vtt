00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:18.110
 we see the second wildcard here 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:19.760
 session of the skateboard world championship 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:23.600
 we start with the b group 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:25.640
 These are the skaters with inferior ones 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.840
 I would say sponsors are what they are 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.760
 which they are for 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:31.250
 I do not know skate shops or I do not know 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.480
 maybe one or the other of the 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.489
 clearly faster that does not have that much 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.780
 raushauen can simply yes the 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:37.430
 are just a little light given 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.040
 then at least once in the board out or 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:41.540
 donate a nature family wacker 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.400
 we see that one of them 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:44.690
 I'm a bit disappointed, too 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.570
 I thought of was the 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:49.460
 give or guido I think so too 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:52.310
 One can say calmly that was one 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.390
 weak performance in videos I have the 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:56.000
 already quite different things seen the 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.770
 rather , 42 skaters have put that down 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.210
 actually driven very controlled 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:00.649
 i understand why the am 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.450
 end were no longer there and 

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:04.009
 why listed this time and believe that 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:06.229
 was even for troy and leon 

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:08.270
 yes that was actually a good line of 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:10.069
 the two have no idea what was going on 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.530
 that looks really safe as if 

00:01:10.069 --> 00:01:15.139
 that would hold the skateboard 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.729
 that works well with the yes we have 

00:01:15.139 --> 00:01:18.409
 now skipped the fifth place 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:21.499
 organizational reasons so we want 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:24.649
 Just not all skaters show too 

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:26.510
 because there are people doing the am 

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:28.070
 logos 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:31.030
 in the body where you do not like so much 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:33.140
 For example, adidas shoes show that 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.750
 has a reason that will of course 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.280
 like to show which side just from 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.220
 Of course adidas is also a partner 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:43.910
 below 90 percent of the stock within 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:47.300
 exactly and that's why we show, of course 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:49.640
 like the line now from johnny 's 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:52.130
 you can see cars just mittlerweise 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.110
 anyway I do not know is pretty nice 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.850
 insanely easy the seven underneath 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.010
 I think now also a helmet jumped 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.170
 put on and you get that you can see 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:01.880
 yes, even if the mac andy mckee 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:05.500
 there is always when he drives stages 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:07.850
 actually only with helmet in any case 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.800
 but beautiful leyen has set on 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.940
 every case with a ollie the threesome 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.680
 blocks at the end 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.870
 now the right skaters come 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:17.210
 who also have reasonable sponsors 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.250
 energy fin for example car from the audi 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:21.470
 has definitely on the fingers with the 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.300
 game telecom 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.580
 I think the roles here are from 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:28.250
 continental yes i think so too i have 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:30.560
 seen on disasters leave that 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.810
 this has the company as the 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.420
 really bring something there as well 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.520
 that's just great investing 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:40.750
 has the value somehow 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:43.580
 organizer is more interesting 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:45.320
 someone has a sponsor 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:53.750
 Here you can see Robin watching his 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:54.710
 leyen will be the new jever the logically beautiful 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.450
 Definitely leyen for the third 

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:58.100
 place then the line is of course first 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.170
 then to the end when the skater to the first 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.610
 times the world that means the rows goes 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.480
 It was only there 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:07.150
 drove in the front 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:07.150
 let's see what he put down now 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:20.080
 beauty sleep now what is that 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:20.080
 switch was the biophysicist earlier 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:28.659
 for johannes , i believe one 

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:30.189
 white leggins pulled under 

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:34.180
 I do not know if this is the new one 

00:03:30.189 --> 00:03:35.860
 style is the skate to more so 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.150
 I do not want her that cool too 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:38.290
 no case that will be in the 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.329
 boulevard press in any case 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:42.129
 certainly still a topic to be the 

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:43.299
 we dressed again here we see 

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:45.760
 Tomorrow destined for breakfast 

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:48.040
 and sure by the layman was okay 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:50.109
 so far a little bit longer than planned 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.310
 and fred diehl one we see that it 

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:54.060
 now not the only win why 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:04:11.349
 he explains himself 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:04:12.970
 Unfortunately we were not so after we were like that 

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:15.400
 rude were interrupted gave again 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:17.049
 So the question is the movie helicopter has 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.190
 yes unfortunately not continuously sprit that 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:20.169
 means a few lines were not 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:21.910
 like their win alone 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:23.229
 lord you can say something again 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:23.830
 these were for tricks and how 

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:30.280
 sequence 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:33.070
 yes that was a french philipp 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:35.050
 In the flat s, the three will taste high 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:37.720
 then i will become a frontside like that 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:40.750
 the three shut down then one all 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:44.110
 in flat a franzetti the foursome high 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:45.910
 a trailer ready 4 under 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:47.410
 and then I was comfortable the 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:49.510
 three again with a change for 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:52.210
 high neck all clear 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:53.860
 that was not the green alone unfortunately 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:55.450
 tape that was it from the wild card 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:57.250
 Session number two the World Cup station 

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:58.810
 Number 3 will take place the next Tuesday 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:00.040
 instead of what we do then meet 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:00.640
 As always with Hilter and I know 

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:03.850
 not exactly 

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:05.440
 it will be manny mania i believe 

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:08.040
 that means a manual 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:08.040
 contest
