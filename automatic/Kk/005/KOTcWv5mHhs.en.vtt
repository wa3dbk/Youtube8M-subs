it's<00:03:23.170> actually<00:03:23.440> pretty<00:03:23.560> sharp<00:03:23.920> so<00:03:24.370> I<00:03:24.400> might<00:03:24.580> be

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
it's actually pretty sharp so I might be

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.810 
it's actually pretty sharp so I might be
grania<00:03:25.180> back<00:03:25.360> down<00:03:25.570> um<00:03:25.989> also<00:03:26.950> like<00:03:27.370> I<00:03:27.459> said<00:03:27.670> the

grania back down um also like I said the
finish<00:03:28.120> isn't<00:03:28.480> as<00:03:28.570> good<00:03:28.840> um<00:03:30.360> let's<00:03:31.360> see<00:03:31.480> if<00:03:31.570> I

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:31.630 
finish isn't as good um let's see if I

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:35.190 
finish isn't as good um let's see if I
could<00:03:31.750> see<00:03:32.170> this<00:03:32.350> focus<00:03:32.709> is<00:03:32.830> in<00:03:33.900> I'm<00:03:34.900> not<00:03:35.020> sure

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 
could see this focus is in I'm not sure

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.600 
could see this focus is in I'm not sure
how<00:03:35.410> well<00:03:35.680> that's<00:03:35.890> going<00:03:36.040> to<00:03:36.100> show<00:03:36.340> up<00:03:36.459> on

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:36.610

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:48.070 
ripple these ripple lines here a lot

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:49.560 
ripple these ripple lines here a lot
smoother<00:03:48.670> and<00:03:48.850> this<00:03:48.970> seems<00:03:49.180> like<00:03:49.300> there<00:03:49.420> was<00:03:49.540> a

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:49.570 
smoother and this seems like there was a

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:51.720 
smoother and this seems like there was a

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730 
lot more of it and it definitely looked

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:53.310 
lot more of it and it definitely looked
a<00:03:51.790> lot<00:03:51.910> prettier<00:03:52.330> this<00:03:52.840> one<00:03:53.080> you<00:03:53.200> could

a lot prettier this one you could

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:54.900 
a lot prettier this one you could
definitely<00:03:53.440> tell<00:03:53.680> it's<00:03:53.920> not<00:03:53.950> expensive<00:03:54.519> but

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:54.910 
definitely tell it's not expensive but

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:56.490 
definitely tell it's not expensive but
by<00:03:55.330> no<00:03:55.420> means<00:03:55.540> I<00:03:55.810> just<00:03:55.989> feel<00:03:56.230> like<00:03:56.260> a
