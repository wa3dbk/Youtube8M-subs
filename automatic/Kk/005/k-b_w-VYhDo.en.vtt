00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:35.090 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:41.420 

there<00:04:38.479> so<00:04:39.479> I<00:04:39.750> said<00:04:40.650> that's<00:04:40.830> how<00:04:40.979> I<00:04:41.009> play<00:04:41.370> it

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:41.430 
there so I said that's how I play it

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:44.809 
there so I said that's how I play it
it's<00:04:41.610> not<00:04:41.729> how<00:04:42.000> it's<00:04:42.180> played<00:04:42.389> properly<00:04:43.819> my

00:04:44.809 --> 00:04:44.819 
it's not how it's played properly my

00:04:44.819 --> 00:04:48.439 
it's not how it's played properly my
diet<00:04:45.270> can<00:04:45.479> only<00:04:45.629> use<00:04:46.789> three<00:04:47.789> fingers<00:04:47.819> this

00:04:48.439 --> 00:04:48.449 
diet can only use three fingers this

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:51.050 
diet can only use three fingers this
little<00:04:48.750> finger<00:04:48.930> doesn't<00:04:49.379> work<00:04:49.560> properly<00:04:50.060> but

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060 
little finger doesn't work properly but

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:52.369 
little finger doesn't work properly but
it<00:04:51.150> works<00:04:51.360> but<00:04:51.629> it<00:04:51.810> doesn't<00:04:52.080> work

00:04:52.369 --> 00:04:52.379 
it works but it doesn't work

00:04:52.379 --> 00:04:56.420 
it works but it doesn't work
independently<00:04:53.189> of<00:04:53.490> that<00:04:53.759> finger<00:04:54.659> so<00:04:55.560> when<00:04:56.370> I

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:56.430 
independently of that finger so when I

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:57.830 
independently of that finger so when I
curl<00:04:56.699> my<00:04:56.759> little<00:04:57.150> finger

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:57.840 
curl my little finger

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.730 
curl my little finger
that<00:04:58.259> one<00:04:58.469> moves<00:04:58.710> as<00:04:58.979> well<00:05:00.139> so<00:05:01.139> I<00:05:01.169> tend<00:05:01.530> not<00:05:01.620> to

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:01.740 
that one moves as well so I tend not to

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:05.420 
that one moves as well so I tend not to
use<00:05:01.919> it<00:05:02.069> so<00:05:02.520> it's<00:05:02.789> just<00:05:02.909> the<00:05:04.159> just<00:05:05.159> the<00:05:05.250> way

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:05.430 
use it so it's just the just the way

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:07.189 
use it so it's just the just the way
