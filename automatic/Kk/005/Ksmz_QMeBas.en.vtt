 someone who is challenged in life

 a certain disorder due to a disability

 has learned the number of skills 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.640
 that can contribute to it 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.830
 confidence of children or 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.860
 adults who can contribute to the 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.000
 degree of social participation dogs 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.640
 just have lots of special 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.710
 properties that precisely make this kind 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.750
 people benefit enormously from the 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.149
 presence of such a dog the 9 year old 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.430
 twin sisters fleur and amber 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.440
 have a rare pink eye condition 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.270
 worse and worse 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.360
 six have received support since a few months 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.340
 from nando high five j it brought one 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.070
 hope rest with it because before that time 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.440
 took the came it was visually impaired 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.890
 other fleur difference a very big role 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.420
 in the family and the edges came away to 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.820
 the background 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.619
 another was important and that cares 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.320
 make the government a lot happier 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.420
 really a year it was very much on the 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.280
 background are both smack see 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.770
 fleur has extra difficulty with it if it is the 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.960
 sun that shines that is cloudy then 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.549
 she sees even less was where she ends 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.590
 really just around like a blind 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:28.939
 someone and staple like a visually impaired 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:31.140
 land just by nando running shoes 

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:34.140
 playing outside 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.570
 I always thought it was nice and fun 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.090
 therefore almost never played 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.340
 you only get another one more often 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.040
 but you can pick green to play too 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.840
 yes that you love them and favor so playfully 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.369
 just feel clear that you are mine 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.680
 licking tears 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.780
 he does my glasses with his nation one 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.700
 a little bit up and then you give more tears 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.909
 spots can also be buddy dogs 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.350
 deployed in adults who are on the one or 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.200
 different way in their daily life 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.780
 are hampered and by, for example 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.130
 a post-traumatic stress disorder we 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.290

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.789

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.379
 old knowledgeable service being able 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.770
 people from the armed forces are just that 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:13.300
 can also be people, for example 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:15.460
 you have been with the police or 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.380
 ambulance services we know that if we 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:19.090
 put in a dog that special 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:20.650
 trained and selected again 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.390
 for that person 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.310
 that the quality of life can be enormous 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.260
