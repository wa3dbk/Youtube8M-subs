00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.090
 hi people this is the channel Oscar of colleagues 

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:14.520
 tables and today we'll talk briefly about 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.890
 arte fix figurines clone commander coody 

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:19.380
 the company of the cat a bouquet based on the third 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.290
 Star Wars Saga Revenge Saga episode 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:25.110
 as opposed to my previous figurines 

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:29.220
 recoil beeches commander coody done 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:31.020
 scale not 1 to 6 1 to 7 but in fact 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.510
 noticeable difference in size is just 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:36.030
 missing from the figurine there are two 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.610
 options for assembly and display, or you can 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.159
 tell posing which i will show you 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.809
 after a couple of minutes but for now I will say that 

00:00:41.159 --> 00:00:45.239
 first of all in this statuette 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:49.290
 I was attracted by the subject of one of 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:51.449
 poses namely recreating scenes from the movie 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:55.379
 to deacon and get the message 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:57.989
 execute order 66 is just one of 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:01.260
 the most fucking moments of the movie and 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:03.720
 the whole saga and even though I'm not a fan of the company 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.700
 cat beeches but I really like star wars ii 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:09.180
 was required to add this statuette to 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.530
 collection and while I twist this abnormally 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.510
 huge box you already for sure 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.970
 reviewed the clown's print with this one 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.950
 pose and hologram 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.720
 on the back of the box besides another 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:22.350
 one print is already in black and white 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.240
 and all sorts of inscriptions at the bottom of kotobukia just 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:28.140
 shows us both build options 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:30.810
 dioramas with different postures of clones 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.870
 Of course a few words about the dimensions of the box 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.630
 about what I can not say because 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:38.400
 This flour and about obsessed on 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.810
 large boxes that generally 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.380
 do not correspond to the size itself 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.590
 statuette 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:47.900
 and when you get the blister statue then 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.900
 once more you notice it 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:55.140
 Well, here's a samkong blister as we see 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.030
 box contents 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.910
 correspond to the dimensions of the box itself 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.770
 they are figurines and then at what distance 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:03.300
 all parts are packed from each other 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.340
 again makes me think about 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:07.640
 irrational use when 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:11.000
 other spaces from the blister itself with 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.000
 crazy japanese 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.069
 Now unpack quickly assemble and 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:41.730
 admiring the first version of the assembly 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:43.770
 figurines option number one commander 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.870
 Koody holds in his left hand torn off 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:48.360
 droid's head while being in such 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.099
 imagine the winning stance in this position 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.720
 statuette, in principle, very good 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:52.260
 conveys the atmosphere of battle on the planet 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.780
 utapau 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:57.060
 and in many ways of course thanks to the 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.400
 put a diorama that is made in food 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:02.250
 damaged in the battle of the hangar of the trunk 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:04.590
 droid behind clone though quality 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.989
 materials and not so high 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:11.280
 a figurine that is but all is detailed 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:13.410
 very nice and remembering again 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.840
 a statuette for k clarke who were 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:18.450
 a couple of points of articulation then unlike 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.340
 kotobukia clone already did not do it 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:23.820
 single point articulation 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:25.829
 that is, it is a statuette full 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:28.260
 that there is some slightly plastic 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:31.380
 plastic elements go through the wires and 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:33.690
 the hands of a droid who can gun 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:37.440
 bend but strongly pull the hand of the droid not 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:39.600
 I advise regardless of the configuration of the pose 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:42.410
 clone at the statuette of information belts attached 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:45.299
 lightsaber obi-wana kenobi 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:46.980
 In general, painting is cool and all these 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:49.920
 damage effects on barney clone 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:51.209
 give a living like the truth on the back of his head 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.850
 slam slightly visible some 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:56.250
 bumps but cant it is painting or 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:58.140
 most modeling is hard to say but in 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:01.680
 the rest at first glance where am I 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:03.329
 I did my best and as usual with them 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:07.400
 it happens price-quality ratio 

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:07.400
 quite satisfactory 

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:32.959
 move on to the next version of the assembly 

00:04:44.209 --> 00:04:48.749
 Option Two Commander Coody 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.839
 gets the order to bring in 

00:04:48.749 --> 00:04:54.059
 execution order 66 

00:04:50.839 --> 00:04:56.219
 for this pose using a set of small 

00:04:54.059 --> 00:04:59.729
 mounts changing the location of the head and 

00:04:56.219 --> 00:05:01.889
 right hands with weapons and accordingly 

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:04.439
 the left hand with the head of the droid is changed to 

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:06.990
 hand with a hologram of which before this 

00:05:04.439 --> 00:05:09.389
 easily installed three small 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:11.939
 batteries for led backlight brush with 

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:12.830
 battery holograms do-it-yourself 

00:05:11.939 --> 00:05:15.629
 complete 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:18.719
 separately I want to praise who will 

00:05:15.629 --> 00:05:21.509
 flooded element in a hologram chic 

00:05:18.719 --> 00:05:23.219
 the backlight is pretty bright LED and when 

00:05:21.509 --> 00:05:28.019
 complete darkness holograms illuminates 

00:05:23.219 --> 00:05:30.360
 almost the entire clone so 

00:05:28.019 --> 00:05:32.309
 what else can I say about the statues in general I 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:34.709
 absolutely happy with the clone for 

00:05:32.309 --> 00:05:35.939
 scale one families statuette has 

00:05:34.709 --> 00:05:37.979
 impressive dimensions 

00:05:35.939 --> 00:05:41.039
 the height of the whole structure along with 

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:43.999
 stand about 30 centimeters height 

00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:46.019
 occasion of the 28 and a half centimeters 

00:05:43.999 --> 00:05:47.819
 comparing with the same who is possible 

00:05:46.019 --> 00:05:49.849
 feel free to say that this figurine is just 

00:05:47.819 --> 00:05:53.309
 one to six scale 

00:05:49.849 --> 00:05:55.259
 Well, summing up I will say that visually and 

00:05:53.309 --> 00:05:57.209
 technical execution of the figurine 

00:05:55.259 --> 00:06:00.070
 almost equal to its value 

00:05:57.209 --> 00:06:02.260
 I would like a little bit better 

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:07.780
 all the same this collector is not high-end 

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:09.730
 Well, for the idea to display the clone 

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:12.310
 using exactly scenes from the utapau 

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:14.520
 Yes, and in two versions of applause and 

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:17.590
 praise ok it's beeches 

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:19.450
