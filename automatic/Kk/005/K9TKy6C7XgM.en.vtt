 you go 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.810
 and for Rwanda how are they divided 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.840
 so the purpose of this 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:58.659
 dedicated to 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:02.590
 so a priori we will see other characters formatrice dÃ©collecte 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.590
 reduced and of course to see eight dead children 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:11.790
 so a little dedication for my friend from the Atlantic 

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:17.269

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:39.079
 there the market 

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:40.680
 so as you can see the elite 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.680
 now I run 

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:46.889
 so too 

00:02:46.889 --> 00:02:50.269
 Thursday I showed 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:54.140
 the item not dead while the physical is accurate but when I'm trying to 

00:02:54.139 --> 00:02:56.539
 so walk in team situation 

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:59.369
 to show you what is most important 

00:02:59.369 --> 00:03:02.259
 so you see a death like that I walk 

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:05.529
 he accelerates 

00:03:05.529 --> 00:03:08.179
 so here I am going to show you 

00:03:08.179 --> 00:03:09.949
 reloading 

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:13.099
 with still no standard then I will show you 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:15.029
 the giant 

00:03:15.029 --> 00:03:18.069
 if the two leaders so there I walk by lh2 course 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:19.950
 On the menu 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:20.879
 I shoot 

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:22.729
 I am atheist taraf with three shots 

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:24.359
 I recharge 

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:27.359
 the extra cost would be for sale 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:31.599
 the protector so there the senator 

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:33.889
 maybe we have a competition sooner 

00:03:33.889 --> 00:03:36.949
 so we did the same thing it is time dead the clac on recharge 

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:40.479
 for Armenians 

00:03:40.999 --> 00:03:44.139
 we are going to take 

00:03:44.139 --> 00:03:47.139
 the aca 47 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:52.009
 it's about a year has allowed to say 

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:53.119
 with one year 

00:03:53.119 --> 00:03:56.599
 with her a shotgun and look good no with the emblem 

00:03:57.679 --> 00:03:59.039
 he wondered 

00:03:59.039 --> 00:04:02.269
 then we will resume the floor 

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:05.269
 even when you see that I mark the same yard 

00:04:07.339 --> 00:04:10.729
 so here I will try to you that reloading 

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:13.130
 so there unfortunately we respond enormously 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:15.909
 we would have needed three deaths 

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:17.090
 then 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:19.689
 I will show you 

00:04:19.689 --> 00:04:21.219
 extra 

00:04:21.219 --> 00:04:23.360
 however the country 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.360
 the party is a bit short 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:32.909
 I recharge with the pass not of course 

00:04:32.909 --> 00:04:36.370
 however rare and of course to finish 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:38.550
 the thunder 63 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:41.120
 so there the club as bordeaux which huge feat 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.669
 it should be compared to the vote 

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:46.669
 so the damask height g 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:48.759
 so the 

00:04:48.759 --> 00:04:52.169
 it makes me dead and I'm charging 

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:53.749
 this is for 

00:04:53.749 --> 00:04:56.449
 the video 

00:04:56.449 --> 00:05:00.729
 so it was in the middle they tell us that they will therefore present the treacherous 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:04.430
 the guard for me while we are not 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:06.259
 dogs 

00:05:06.259 --> 00:05:07.759
 thank you to all the qualifications
