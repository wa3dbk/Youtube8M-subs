00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:21.200 

put<00:05:19.470> an<00:05:19.620> individual<00:05:20.130> marshmallow<00:05:20.610> onto<00:05:21.060> each

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:21.210 
put an individual marshmallow onto each

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:29.690 
put an individual marshmallow onto each
individual<00:05:21.750> one

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:29.700 

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:33.170 

there<00:05:30.330> you<00:05:30.420> have<00:05:30.540> it<00:05:30.840> a<00:05:30.870> robot<00:05:31.700> now<00:05:32.700> how<00:05:33.120> to

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:33.180 
there you have it a robot now how to

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:35.660 
there you have it a robot now how to
make<00:05:33.390> these<00:05:33.570> simple<00:05:33.870> structures<00:05:34.670> search

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:35.670 
make these simple structures search

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:37.790 
make these simple structures search
experiments<00:05:36.510> and<00:05:36.660> make<00:05:37.230> even<00:05:37.590> more

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:37.800 
experiments and make even more

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.760 
experiments and make even more
complicated<00:05:38.490> structures<00:05:38.970> if<00:05:39.530> you<00:05:40.530> want<00:05:40.680> to

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:40.770 
complicated structures if you want to

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:42.620 
complicated structures if you want to
see<00:05:40.890> you<00:05:41.040> more<00:05:41.280> hands<00:05:41.580> on<00:05:41.670> activities<00:05:42.120> go<00:05:42.570> to
