Evy officer in Oregon or in Scappoose
Oregon<00:00:08.790> and<00:00:09.030> we<00:00:09.780> have<00:00:09.960> our<00:00:10.110> leaf<00:00:10.320> here<00:00:10.590> and

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
Oregon and we have our leaf here and

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.560 
Oregon and we have our leaf here and
she's<00:00:11.010> fast<00:00:11.940> charging<00:00:12.599> it<00:00:12.719> this<00:00:12.870> is<00:00:13.080> a

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:14.570 
she's fast charging it this is a

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:17.720 
she's fast charging it this is a
AeroVironment<00:00:15.570> fast<00:00:15.839> charger<00:00:16.580> using<00:00:17.580> the

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
AeroVironment fast charger using the

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:23.540 
AeroVironment fast charger using the
CHAdeMO<00:00:18.260> japanese<00:00:19.260> standard<00:00:19.830> and<00:00:22.340> so<00:00:23.340> how

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
CHAdeMO japanese standard and so how

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:35.680 
CHAdeMO japanese standard and so how
long<00:00:23.760> will<00:00:23.970> this<00:00:24.060> take<00:00:24.119> the<00:00:24.449> charge<00:00:24.750> Ashley

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:35.690 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.060 

juice<00:00:36.690> that<00:00:36.930> we<00:00:37.050> got<00:00:37.200> when<00:00:37.410> we<00:00:37.500> pulled<00:00:37.739> it<00:00:37.890> and

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
juice that we got when we pulled it and

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.889 
juice that we got when we pulled it and
I'm<00:00:38.190> guessing<00:00:38.670> it's<00:00:38.850> gonna<00:00:38.910> be<00:00:39.149> around<00:00:39.390> 30%

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.389 

take<00:00:43.899> us<00:00:44.109> if<00:00:44.260> we<00:00:44.440> stay<00:00:44.500> here<00:00:44.739> for<00:00:44.980> the<00:00:45.190> full

00:00:45.389 --> 00:00:45.399 
take us if we stay here for the full

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:51.209 
take us if we stay here for the full
time<00:00:46.170> maybe<00:00:48.359> probably<00:00:49.359> 15<00:00:50.050> 20<00:00:50.260> minutes<00:00:50.649> to<00:00:51.070> get

00:00:51.209 --> 00:00:51.219 
time maybe probably 15 20 minutes to get

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:57.149 
time maybe probably 15 20 minutes to get
to<00:00:51.430> the<00:00:51.609> next<00:00:51.879> destination<00:00:52.769> in<00:00:53.769> Westport<00:00:56.159> so

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:57.159 
to the next destination in Westport so

00:00:57.159 --> 00:00:59.340 
to the next destination in Westport so
the<00:00:57.309> basic<00:00:57.670> idea<00:00:57.789> is<00:00:58.180> that<00:00:58.210> we<00:00:58.570> you<00:00:58.899> have<00:00:59.140> an

00:00:59.340 --> 00:00:59.350 
the basic idea is that we you have an

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.219 
the basic idea is that we you have an
Oregon<00:00:59.739> now<00:00:59.920> on<00:01:00.489> i-5<00:01:01.149> and<00:01:01.180> into<00:01:01.809> the<00:01:01.899> rural

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:02.229 
Oregon now on i-5 and into the rural

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:05.369 
Oregon now on i-5 and into the rural
areas<00:01:02.649> you<00:01:02.680> have<00:01:03.039> a<00:01:03.339> network<00:01:03.760> of<00:01:04.379> fast

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:05.379 
areas you have a network of fast

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:07.889 
areas you have a network of fast
charging<00:01:05.979> so<00:01:06.280> the<00:01:07.000> idea<00:01:07.299> is<00:01:07.420> that<00:01:07.450> people<00:01:07.810> can

00:01:07.889 --> 00:01:07.899 
charging so the idea is that people can

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:10.230 
charging so the idea is that people can
really<00:01:08.200> travel<00:01:08.440> fairly<00:01:09.009> large<00:01:09.250> distances<00:01:10.000> by

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:10.240 
really travel fairly large distances by

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.630 
really travel fairly large distances by
evie<00:01:10.659> right<00:01:10.960> correct<00:01:11.890> so<00:01:12.100> we're<00:01:12.280> going<00:01:12.490> to<00:01:12.580> be

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:12.640 
evie right correct so we're going to be

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.810 
evie right correct so we're going to be
traveling<00:01:12.930> 70<00:01:13.930> miles

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.950 

and<00:01:17.820> then<00:01:17.909> on<00:01:18.030> to<00:01:18.179> Cannon<00:01:18.479> Beach<00:01:18.509> so<00:01:18.810> we'll

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
and then on to Cannon Beach so we'll

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.459 
and then on to Cannon Beach so we'll
probably<00:01:19.109> do<00:01:19.469> today

00:01:21.459 --> 00:01:21.469 
probably do today

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:27.690 
probably do today
over<00:01:24.619> 140<00:01:25.619> electric<00:01:26.429> miles<00:01:26.820> maybe

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:27.700 
over 140 electric miles maybe

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.969 
over 140 electric miles maybe
Wow<00:01:28.700> and<00:01:29.659> so<00:01:29.840> we'll<00:01:30.110> need<00:01:30.140> to<00:01:30.350> charge<00:01:30.590> up<00:01:30.770> three

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:30.979 
Wow and so we'll need to charge up three

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:33.490 
Wow and so we'll need to charge up three
different<00:01:31.280> times<00:01:31.689> new<00:01:32.689> dimensions<00:01:33.320> an

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:33.500 
different times new dimensions an

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:39.820 
different times new dimensions an
electric<00:01:33.860> vehicle<00:01:34.009> travel<00:01:38.470> there<00:01:39.470> you<00:01:39.619> see

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:39.830 
electric vehicle travel there you see

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:43.480 
electric vehicle travel there you see
this<00:01:40.040> is<00:01:40.190> the<00:01:40.310> 480<00:01:40.820> volt<00:01:41.240> fast<00:01:42.110> charge<00:01:42.619> there

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490 
this is the 480 volt fast charge there

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:45.039 
this is the 480 volt fast charge there
are<00:01:43.549> now<00:01:43.670> 2<00:01:43.729> standards<00:01:44.479> for<00:01:44.659> this<00:01:44.780> the

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:45.049 
are now 2 standards for this the

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:47.170 
are now 2 standards for this the
Japanese<00:01:45.440> CHAdeMO<00:01:46.100> standard<00:01:46.789> and<00:01:47.030> the

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:47.180 
Japanese CHAdeMO standard and the

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.070 
Japanese CHAdeMO standard and the
american<00:01:47.570> sae<00:01:47.990> standard<00:01:49.090> leafs<00:01:50.090> have<00:01:50.630> the

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:51.080 
american sae standard leafs have the

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.680 
american sae standard leafs have the
CHAdeMO<00:01:51.530> standard<00:01:52.220> so<00:01:52.430> it's<00:01:53.240> probably<00:01:53.539> one

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:53.690 
CHAdeMO standard so it's probably one

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:56.350 
CHAdeMO standard so it's probably one
reason<00:01:54.020> there's<00:01:54.170> so<00:01:54.320> many<00:01:54.409> Leafs<00:01:54.770> here<00:01:55.159> 1/2<00:01:56.149> of

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 
reason there's so many Leafs here 1/2 of

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.469 
reason there's so many Leafs here 1/2 of
the<00:01:56.570> Eevee's<00:01:56.990> and<00:01:57.380> oregon<00:01:57.920> are<00:01:58.100> are<00:01:58.759> the<00:01:59.090> nizam

00:01:59.469 --> 00:01:59.479 
the Eevee's and oregon are are the nizam

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:02.820 
the Eevee's and oregon are are the nizam
leaf<00:02:00.369> so<00:02:01.369> I'm<00:02:01.520> checking<00:02:01.700> in<00:02:02.000> to<00:02:02.119> plug<00:02:02.420> share

leaf so I'm checking in to plug share
look<00:02:03.830> at<00:02:03.950> this<00:02:04.130> high-tech<00:02:04.610> stuff<00:02:05.200> we're<00:02:06.200> gonna

00:02:06.309 --> 00:02:06.319 
look at this high-tech stuff we're gonna

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:08.139 
look at this high-tech stuff we're gonna
check<00:02:06.860> in<00:02:07.100> to<00:02:07.280> show<00:02:07.460> somebody<00:02:07.700> that<00:02:07.880> we're

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:13.870 
check in to show somebody that we're
actually<00:02:09.550> charging<00:02:10.550> up<00:02:12.220> so<00:02:13.220> somebody<00:02:13.700> who

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
actually charging up so somebody who

actually charging up so somebody who
might<00:02:14.360> want<00:02:14.600> to<00:02:14.690> use<00:02:14.900> this<00:02:15.200> station<00:02:15.769> could<00:02:16.430> use

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
might want to use this station could use

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.340 
might want to use this station could use
plug<00:02:16.970> share<00:02:17.330> and<00:02:17.660> they<00:02:17.750> could<00:02:17.900> find<00:02:18.170> out

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.350 
plug share and they could find out

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:19.780 
plug share and they could find out
whether<00:02:18.620> they'd<00:02:19.100> find<00:02:19.370> out<00:02:19.489> that<00:02:19.610> this

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
whether they'd find out that this
