00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:20.000

 for them it is feeling 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:41.410
 and to know if they fall 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:45.019
 they are at furtive taste 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:48.530
 It is also to get a prize 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:48.530
 have a little more 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:54.050
 then it is also advisable to have it 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:01.750
 with very simple things the only thing 

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:04.519
 important is to see that the ferret fits 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:07.459
 for the space where you are going to leave the 

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:09.380
 toy can be all appears all 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:12.500
 our type 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:14.600
 speaking from pietro the important thing is 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:16.120
 that was always under supervision and 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:19.780
 never leave 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:24.120
 Remember also that it is not good 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:24.120
 we put gas sand 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:28.950
 because they remember that to do 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:32.190
 of the bathroom recharge their 

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:34.820
 and urinate and defecate I guess it's pretty 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:37.130
 when leaving it is quite liquid 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:40.430
 what sand does is that you can 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:43.430
 stick to your tail and how to be in 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:45.260
 Binder is made in stone then 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:48.080

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:51.449
 little ball those little pieces of 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:54.090
 sand that in the long run you go cervantes 

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:56.610

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:58.390
 small January with granulin that are 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:02.740

 broken corn or whatever you are sure to is 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:07.260
