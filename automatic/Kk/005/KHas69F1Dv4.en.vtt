00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:05.050
 there is a match 

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:08.139
 in which I see that Jesus of Jesus the 

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:10.240
 goalkeeper is the hero of the game I 

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:11.559
 it seems to me that joseph de jesus induces 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.630
 mexico to advance 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:16.119
 in a position I do not remember if it was 

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:17.680
 against korea against senegal I do not remember 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:21.010
 but there is a party in which he is the 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:23.260
 hero and he is part of the defense not him 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:26.260
 is part of the defense then the 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:28.990
 defense played splendid the fact that 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:31.779
 do not target goal leganÃ©s to Brazil 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:35.180
 others start from below start from 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:37.550
 the order below is not true yes 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:40.850
 us as a defense always before 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:42.380
 a game is talk and we will have to 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.290
 leave the door at zero we know that 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:48.050
 we have important players ahead 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:52.100
 that having a law are going to get very 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:55.910
 well very well and also very well I have 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:58.550
 been perhaps exaggeratedly observant 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:01.340
 you work and sometimes I 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:03.199
 criticisms regarding the excess of balls 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:06.320
 that go out on the line of 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:08.360
 band because you will pass the 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.880
 but the two do not pass or the 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:13.180
 ball then as a resource throw it 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:16.010
 for outside and sometimes it gets too 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:18.350
 it too 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:21.620
 ugly the match when you throw both the 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:23.990
 ball for outside and against brasil me 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:26.270
 I started counting how many times you shot 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.070
 the ball for out by the band and it was 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:33.680
 one in the whole party if badly 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:36.260
 I remember if he tried to divide the ball and 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:38.000
 not take it out but work on us 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.770
 is that they do not hit us and we have to 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.290
 defend to whatever the goal of 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:44.570
 us to whatever it is ok 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:46.910
 did not come out playing here either suddenly it 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:49.040
 he will be playing and he likes it because 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:52.520
 you can see that it is progressing with 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:55.729
 capacity and with pleasure it's not that it depends 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.260
 the situation of the party sometimes the 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:59.300
 teams that we faced were waiting for us 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:01.340
 far behind and we do not have the 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:03.590
 opportunity to climb so much because nothing 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.960
 the more you're going to hit, it's always 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:08.149
 a two against one with someone from outside 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.010
 whether it was israel or it was glass 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:12.860
 always make a two against one and 

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:15.500
 let it be cleaned, that's why I think that 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:18.010
 he did not see himself so much that he went out with the 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.810
 excellent excellent ball hirÃ¡m mier 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.069
 public capital what is football 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:24.439
 write it down 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:28.900
 Mexico was first in Brazil 

00:02:24.439 --> 00:02:32.359
 he was second and fourteenth 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:35.319
 was Spain that had just been 

00:02:32.359 --> 00:02:35.319
 World Champion 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:39.410
 pause and we return
