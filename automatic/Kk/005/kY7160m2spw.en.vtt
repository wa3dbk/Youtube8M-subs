00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.429 

let's<00:00:00.359> take<00:00:00.630> a<00:00:00.659> look<00:00:00.840> at<00:00:00.989> some<00:00:01.140> aircraft

00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:01.439 
let's take a look at some aircraft

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:05.059 
let's take a look at some aircraft
without<00:00:02.010> wings<00:00:02.520> the<00:00:03.060> ec135<00:00:03.870> helicopter<00:00:04.859> and

00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:05.069 
without wings the ec135 helicopter and

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:07.849 
without wings the ec135 helicopter and
the<00:00:05.250> Zeppelin<00:00:05.700> NT<00:00:05.910> both<00:00:06.540> are<00:00:06.810> the<00:00:07.170> aircraft<00:00:07.379> of

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
the Zeppelin NT both are the aircraft of

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:18.320 
the Zeppelin NT both are the aircraft of
this<00:00:08.130> month<00:00:16.160> so<00:00:17.160> let's<00:00:17.400> look<00:00:17.640> at<00:00:17.789> the<00:00:17.910> cockpit

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
this month so let's look at the cockpit

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.700 
this month so let's look at the cockpit
of<00:00:18.359> the<00:00:18.539> ec135<00:00:19.529> first<00:00:20.810> this<00:00:21.810> is<00:00:22.020> as<00:00:22.260> you<00:00:22.560> can

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
of the ec135 first this is as you can

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.040 
of the ec135 first this is as you can
see<00:00:22.980> very<00:00:23.460> well<00:00:23.580> modeled<00:00:24.240> it<00:00:24.420> has<00:00:24.779> photo

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
see very well modeled it has photo

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.800 
see very well modeled it has photo
realistic<00:00:25.320> texturing<00:00:26.189> which<00:00:26.880> is<00:00:27.090> rare<00:00:27.359> for<00:00:27.750> a

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
realistic texturing which is rare for a

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.200 
realistic texturing which is rare for a
plane<00:00:28.109> in<00:00:28.289> flight<00:00:28.410> gear<00:00:28.769> but<00:00:29.580> many<00:00:29.760> of<00:00:30.000> the

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
plane in flight gear but many of the

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.330 
plane in flight gear but many of the
switches<00:00:30.480> are<00:00:30.660> not<00:00:31.019> yet<00:00:31.230> functional<00:00:31.590> and<00:00:31.949> the

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
switches are not yet functional and the

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.610 
switches are not yet functional and the
procedures<00:00:32.700> to<00:00:33.270> start<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:33.750> engine<00:00:34.079> are<00:00:34.230> very

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
procedures to start the engine are very

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.770 
procedures to start the engine are very
simple<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.520> exterior<00:00:36.000> model<00:00:36.450> of<00:00:36.570> this

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
simple the exterior model of this

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.049 
simple the exterior model of this
helicopter<00:00:37.200> also<00:00:37.770> looks<00:00:37.980> great<00:00:38.280> it<00:00:38.820> uses

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
helicopter also looks great it uses

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.510 
helicopter also looks great it uses
great<00:00:39.480> reflection<00:00:39.899> shaders<00:00:40.739> and<00:00:40.890> the

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
great reflection shaders and the

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.229 
great reflection shaders and the
animations<00:00:42.149> work<00:00:42.450> well<00:00:42.980> this<00:00:43.980> ec<00:00:44.489> has<00:00:44.700> a<00:00:44.760> lot

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
animations work well this ec has a lot

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.180 
animations work well this ec has a lot
of<00:00:45.270> liveries<00:00:45.809> to<00:00:46.050> choose<00:00:46.289> from<00:00:46.559> so<00:00:47.010> you'll

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
of liveries to choose from so you'll

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:53.209 
of liveries to choose from so you'll
never<00:00:47.370> get<00:00:47.700> bored<00:00:50.930> actually<00:00:51.930> I<00:00:52.559> don't<00:00:53.070> know

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
never get bored actually I don't know

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.760 
never get bored actually I don't know
much<00:00:53.460> about<00:00:53.670> helicopter<00:00:54.390> flight<00:00:54.629> dynamics<00:00:54.809> so

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
much about helicopter flight dynamics so

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.319 
much about helicopter flight dynamics so
I<00:00:55.800> will<00:00:56.160> just<00:00:56.190> give<00:00:56.640> you<00:00:56.670> a<00:00:56.850> comparison

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
I will just give you a comparison

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.680 
I will just give you a comparison
between<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:57.960> ec135<00:00:58.890> and<00:00:59.550> other<00:01:00.000> helicopters

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
between the ec135 and other helicopters

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.590 
between the ec135 and other helicopters
in<00:01:00.809> flight<00:01:01.050> gear<00:01:01.289> it<00:01:01.890> seems<00:01:02.219> that<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:02.789> ec135

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
in flight gear it seems that the ec135

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.960 
in flight gear it seems that the ec135
handles<00:01:04.589> easier<00:01:05.040> than<00:01:05.850> for<00:01:06.180> example<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:06.840> r22

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:07.970 
handles easier than for example the r22

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.730 
handles easier than for example the r22
actually<00:01:08.970> I<00:01:09.000> learned<00:01:09.450> flying<00:01:09.869> helicopters<00:01:10.619> in

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
actually I learned flying helicopters in

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.670 
actually I learned flying helicopters in
flight<00:01:10.979> gear<00:01:11.220> in<00:01:11.430> this<00:01:11.850> ec<00:01:12.450> just<00:01:13.170> because<00:01:13.530> the

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
flight gear in this ec just because the

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.580 
flight gear in this ec just because the
others<00:01:14.010> were<00:01:14.310> harder<00:01:14.700> to<00:01:14.880> fly<00:01:15.200> so<00:01:16.200> if<00:01:16.439> you're

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
others were harder to fly so if you're

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.950 
others were harder to fly so if you're
new<00:01:16.830> to<00:01:16.860> flying<00:01:17.280> helicopters<00:01:18.030> be<00:01:18.600> sure<00:01:18.750> to

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
new to flying helicopters be sure to

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:25.160 
new to flying helicopters be sure to
give<00:01:19.140> this<00:01:19.409> one<00:01:19.650> a<00:01:19.680> try<00:01:23.600> try<00:01:24.600> landing<00:01:24.990> this

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
give this one a try try landing this

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.320 
give this one a try try landing this
helicopter<00:01:25.619> on<00:01:25.950> a<00:01:25.979> rooftop<00:01:26.310> or<00:01:26.729> on<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.119> ship

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
helicopter on a rooftop or on the ship

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.020 
helicopter on a rooftop or on the ship
it's<00:01:27.840> often<00:01:28.080> not<00:01:28.409> easy<00:01:28.740> to<00:01:28.979> do<00:01:29.130> this<00:01:29.369> but<00:01:29.820> it's

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
it's often not easy to do this but it's

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.440 
it's often not easy to do this but it's
definitely<00:01:30.299> worth<00:01:30.900> trying

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.550 

okay<00:01:35.140> let's<00:01:35.590> switch<00:01:35.860> from<00:01:36.189> the<00:01:36.340> ec135<00:01:37.409> to<00:01:38.409> the

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
okay let's switch from the ec135 to the

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:44.819 
okay let's switch from the ec135 to the
Zeppelin<00:01:39.070> and<00:01:39.340> T<00:01:42.509> the<00:01:43.509> cockpit<00:01:43.929> of<00:01:43.960> discipline

Zeppelin and T the cockpit of discipline

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:47.910 
Zeppelin and T the cockpit of discipline
is<00:01:45.009> fairly<00:01:45.460> detailed<00:01:45.869> but<00:01:46.869> it's<00:01:47.110> not<00:01:47.380> easy<00:01:47.619> to

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920 
is fairly detailed but it's not easy to

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.249 
is fairly detailed but it's not easy to

the exterior model of the Zeppelin NT
looks<00:01:58.479> fairly<00:01:58.810> good<00:01:59.140> but<00:01:59.530> could<00:01:59.770> have<00:01:59.950> some

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:00.159 
looks fairly good but could have some

surprisingly fast the real interesting

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.289 
surprisingly fast the real interesting
part<00:02:14.530> is<00:02:14.739> flying<00:02:15.069> slowly<00:02:15.459> with<00:02:16.000> much

00:02:16.289 --> 00:02:16.299 
part is flying slowly with much

part is flying slowly with much
precision<00:02:17.010> it<00:02:18.010> can<00:02:18.790> be<00:02:18.940> quite<00:02:19.150> a<00:02:19.209> challenge<00:02:19.569> to

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:20.049 
precision it can be quite a challenge to

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:22.350 
precision it can be quite a challenge to
set<00:02:20.260> the<00:02:20.410> right<00:02:20.590> angle<00:02:21.099> for<00:02:21.310> the<00:02:21.340> engines<00:02:21.880> so

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
set the right angle for the engines so

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:23.880 
set the right angle for the engines so
the<00:02:22.569> Zeppelin<00:02:22.989> can<00:02:23.260> float<00:02:23.500> in<00:02:23.709> the<00:02:23.860> air

in heavy wind settings factoring the

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:32.789 
in heavy wind settings factoring the
engines<00:02:31.450> can<00:02:31.720> be<00:02:31.750> quite<00:02:32.110> a<00:02:32.140> lot<00:02:32.410> of<00:02:32.560> fun

00:02:32.789 --> 00:02:32.799 
engines can be quite a lot of fun

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:35.039 
engines can be quite a lot of fun
especially<00:02:33.250> because<00:02:34.000> then<00:02:34.239> can<00:02:34.450> be<00:02:34.480> reversed

00:02:35.039 --> 00:02:35.049 
especially because then can be reversed

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:37.170 
especially because then can be reversed
by<00:02:35.500> changing<00:02:35.950> the<00:02:36.130> propeller<00:02:36.519> blade<00:02:36.880> pitch

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
by changing the propeller blade pitch

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.259 
by changing the propeller blade pitch
factor<00:02:38.110> the<00:02:38.500> engines<00:02:38.889> down<00:02:39.190> and<00:02:39.489> put<00:02:40.000> them<00:02:40.150> in

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:40.269 
factor the engines down and put them in

factor the engines down and put them in

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:42.609 
reverse this way the ship will descend

00:02:42.609 --> 00:02:45.150 
reverse this way the ship will descend
rather<00:02:42.910> quickly<00:02:43.299> in<00:02:43.569> a<00:02:44.109> way<00:02:44.319> that<00:02:44.590> planes<00:02:44.920> or

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
rather quickly in a way that planes or

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.900 
rather quickly in a way that planes or
helicopters<00:02:45.220> could<00:02:46.060> never<00:02:46.269> do<00:02:47.670> thanks<00:02:48.670> again

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910
