00:00:59.260 --> 00:00:59.270 
so the strum pattern i'm going to use

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:00.760 
so the strum pattern i'm going to use
i'm<00:00:59.450> going<00:00:59.630> to<00:00:59.690> be<00:00:59.780> hitting<00:00:59.960> the<00:01:00.050> third<00:01:00.350> string

i'm going to be hitting the third string

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:03.730 
i'm going to be hitting the third string
down<00:01:01.070> and<00:01:02.000> then<00:01:02.990> i'm<00:01:03.050> just<00:01:03.080> going<00:01:03.260> to<00:01:03.320> play<00:01:03.590> the

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:03.740 
down and then i'm just going to play the

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:10.310 
down and then i'm just going to play the
strum<00:01:04.010> the<00:01:04.040> whole<00:01:04.280> thing

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.200 

and<00:01:11.010> that's<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.340> strum<00:01:11.700> pattern<00:01:12.030> i'm<00:01:12.090> going

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
and that's the strum pattern i'm going

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.420 
and that's the strum pattern i'm going
to<00:01:12.270> use<00:01:12.360> for<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.570> whole<00:01:12.690> song<00:01:13.100> this<00:01:14.100> is<00:01:14.280> just

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
to use for the whole song this is just

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:15.830 
to use for the whole song this is just
an<00:01:14.520> easier<00:01:14.790> way<00:01:14.909> to<00:01:14.940> do<00:01:15.180> it<00:01:15.330> especially<00:01:15.390> if<00:01:15.750> you

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
an easier way to do it especially if you

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.240 
an easier way to do it especially if you
first<00:01:16.050> start<00:01:16.290> now<00:01:16.850> so<00:01:18.350> anyway<00:01:19.350> we're<00:01:20.070> going<00:01:20.190> to

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
first start now so anyway we're going to

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:26.990 
first start now so anyway we're going to
use<00:01:20.490> that<00:01:22.160> so<00:01:23.160> practice<00:01:23.520> that<00:01:23.550> a<00:01:23.670> few<00:01:23.729> times

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.310 

and<00:01:27.240> then<00:01:27.630> we're<00:01:27.750> going<00:01:27.840> to<00:01:27.900> switch<00:01:28.080> to<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.290> E

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
and then we're going to switch to the E

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:34.040 
and then we're going to switch to the E
minor

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:34.050 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:35.750 

I<00:01:34.170> think<00:01:34.680> you'll<00:01:34.800> be<00:01:34.890> doing<00:01:35.190> it<00:01:35.310> a<00:01:35.370> total<00:01:35.670> of

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:35.760 
I think you'll be doing it a total of

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:38.510 
I think you'll be doing it a total of
eight<00:01:35.880> times<00:01:36.180> on<00:01:36.450> each<00:01:36.510> chord<00:01:37.020> so<00:01:37.800> you<00:01:38.340> can<00:01:38.430> go

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
eight times on each chord so you can go

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.460 
eight times on each chord so you can go
as<00:01:38.580> fast<00:01:38.640> and<00:01:38.940> slow<00:01:39.210> as<00:01:39.270> you<00:01:39.360> want<00:01:39.420> until<00:01:39.810> you

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
as fast and slow as you want until you

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.950 
as fast and slow as you want until you
get<00:01:40.620> it<00:01:40.710> down<00:01:40.830> but<00:01:41.670> anyway<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.390> chords<00:01:42.720> that

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
get it down but anyway the chords that

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.110 
get it down but anyway the chords that
this<00:01:43.110> is<00:01:43.440> already<00:01:43.950> did<00:01:44.160> already<00:01:44.610> said<00:01:44.880> but

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:45.120 
this is already did already said but

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:48.230 
this is already did already said but
it's<00:01:45.600> going<00:01:45.750> to<00:01:45.810> be<00:01:45.900> a<00:01:45.930> GE<00:01:46.230> e<00:01:46.500> minor<00:01:47.010> C<00:01:47.610> and<00:01:47.940> Abby

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
it's going to be a GE e minor C and Abby

00:01:48.240 --> 00:02:07.290 
it's going to be a GE e minor C and Abby
so<00:01:48.930> let's<00:01:49.590> get<00:01:49.740> started<00:01:49.860> here
