00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
reviewing dangers is this what happens

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.310 
reviewing dangers is this what happens
if<00:01:22.710> Gary<00:01:23.100> bites<00:01:23.460> bite<00:01:24.119> strong<00:01:24.509> my<00:01:24.750> friend

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
if Gary bites bite strong my friend
