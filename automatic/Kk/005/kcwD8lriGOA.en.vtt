00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:31.009 
kind of weird but it's not that bad

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:35.469 
kind of weird but it's not that bad
though<00:01:32.259> honestly<00:01:33.280> this<00:01:34.280> pillow<00:01:34.610> is<00:01:34.909> pretty

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:35.479

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:38.710 
though honestly this pillow is pretty
damn<00:01:35.720> comfortable<00:01:36.110> I'll<00:01:36.590> admit<00:01:36.740> that<00:01:37.600> but<00:01:38.600> it

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:38.720 
damn comfortable I'll admit that but it

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.020

is<00:01:38.840> an<00:01:38.990> air<00:01:39.170> pillow<00:01:39.409> so<00:01:40.130> it<00:01:40.460> takes<00:01:40.759> some<00:01:40.880> time

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030

00:01:44.169 --> 00:01:44.179 
to get used to it but for me it only

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:45.999 
to get used to it but for me it only
took<00:01:44.479> a<00:01:44.539> few<00:01:44.630> nights<00:01:44.960> sleeping<00:01:45.440> on<00:01:45.590> it<00:01:45.619> to<00:01:45.920> get

that's really nice it usually takes a

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.529 
that's really nice it usually takes a
few<00:02:06.950> tries<00:02:07.280> to<00:02:07.490> figure<00:02:07.670> out<00:02:07.820> how<00:02:07.939> to<00:02:08.000> put<00:02:08.329> it<00:02:08.360> in

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
the bag but it's a simple design in

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:12.670 
the bag but it's a simple design in
general<00:02:11.000> so<00:02:11.900> it's<00:02:12.019> pretty<00:02:12.200> easy<00:02:12.410> to<00:02:12.560> figure

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
general so it's pretty easy to figure

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:18.300 
general so it's pretty easy to figure
out<00:02:14.380> so<00:02:15.380> far<00:02:15.739> I<00:02:16.160> haven't<00:02:16.549> really<00:02:16.820> noticed<00:02:17.150> the

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
out so far I haven't really noticed the

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.400 
out so far I haven't really noticed the
mouth<00:02:19.310> piece<00:02:19.610> right<00:02:20.120> here<00:02:20.150> I<00:02:20.660> haven't<00:02:21.049> noticed

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
mouth piece right here I haven't noticed

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:23.770 
mouth piece right here I haven't noticed
it<00:02:21.620> put<00:02:22.250> the<00:02:22.310> inflator<00:02:22.640> getting<00:02:23.060> in<00:02:23.329> my<00:02:23.750> way

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
it put the inflator getting in my way

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.060 
it put the inflator getting in my way
when<00:02:23.930> I<00:02:24.140> sleep<00:02:24.500> so<00:02:25.190> I<00:02:25.220> don't<00:02:25.310> worry<00:02:25.609> about<00:02:25.790> that

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.070 
when I sleep so I don't worry about that

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:29.229 
when I sleep so I don't worry about that
and<00:02:28.070> overall<00:02:28.340> though<00:02:28.640> I<00:02:28.910> would<00:02:29.150> definitely

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:29.239
