00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:09.260
 Julius Caesar Augustus Cleopatra 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:16.949
 of the battles that forged the empire 

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:16.949
 greatest of all time 

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:24.290
 the medium 3 the great battles of 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.880
 Roman Empire in three realities the 

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:28.100
 logical consequence of the success harvested 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.840
 by the inner saga the truth that 

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:31.660
 We think that if people or the general public 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.739
 he had been excited at first 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:37.610
 probably that excite and no longer 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:39.020
 if we place the action or include 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.750
 five centuries of history in one 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:44.120
 game and we offered them the places the 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.890
 characters the battles and the facts 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.930
 most important historical of those five 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:49.970
 centuries from the beginning we were clear 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.350
 the civilizations that we wanted that 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:53.330
 We wanted to see in the new installment of 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.610
 empire we had very clear Egyptians 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:56.390
 because we loved it visually 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.040
 I think that everyone is the 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.120
 civilization that attracts you very much and 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.590
 We also wanted you to study the 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.110
 British by importance the 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:04.220
 British and the Germans and we got 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:06.830
 hands to work the first thing was 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:09.470
 be documented then we had our 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:11.420
 arrangement a team of experts in 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.850
 ancient history and in Roman times' 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:17.250
 the process of creating empire in 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:19.680
 three has been an exciting experience 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.450
 for the whole team the challenge was in 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.940
 see if we were able to integrate in a 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.430
 same game the story is to say to be 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:28.170
 respectful of history with 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.410
 events that occurred does 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:34.979
 thousands of years and at the same time make a 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:36.310
 game that was fun year 31 before 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.299
 of Christ 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:42.909
 marco antonio supported by cleopatra 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:45.579
 Egyptian queen yearns for absolute power 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:46.600
 of red an ambition that looks truncated 

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:49.869
 when his rival 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:51.880
 octavio augusto defeat the Egyptian fleet 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:54.280
 in the battle of actium against the 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.710
 coast of greece 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.350
 [Applause] 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.630
 each of the twelve battles that 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.240
 includes the game has its own its 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.550
 own story their own dialogues their 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:09.360
 own characters 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:11.430
 and we tried to make it in the game 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.960
 more faithful as possible for example for 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.300
 recreate the alexia series which is the 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.680
 place where Julius Caesar cornered 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.570
 bertÃ­n gto leaks in the war of 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.190
 galias in the game has been built a 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:22.260
 scenario that includes the two walls that 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.480
 commanded to raise the Roman general one 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.650
 to besiege the city and another to 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.810
 protect yourself from the attacks of 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.980
 armies that came to the aid of the 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.390
 besieged 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.250
 we wanted to stand out in each of 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.010
 civilizations an aspect that 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.870
 allows you to identify it in the case of 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.480
 the Romans its most characteristic 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.280
 outstanding is the forced march that good 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.620
 it evokes a bit the legendary 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.350
 ability of those of Romans to 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.540
 remember immense distances and 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:50.790
 surprise the enemy or in the case of 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.850
 the Egyptians for example we have highlighted 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:55.470
 his ability to survive for 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:57.960
 develop your civilization 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:01.170
 in a slightly more hostile environment and like 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:02.810
 it can be desert or the British for 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.820
 example that with your exploration skills 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:08.160
 we wanted to highlight that knowledge 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:10.470
 deep they had from the ground when 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.200
 they faced the Roman regions the 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:14.790
 visual elements an empire a three 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:17.040
 they are fundamental especially because 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:20.490
 we are talking about a video game then 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:22.830
 in this way so much in everything that 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:25.650
 includes the game the game units 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:27.300
 the videos that appear as in aspects 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.430
 as important as the cover of the 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:31.620
 video game is very important to move 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.270
 in an attractive way that content 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:36.620
 historical that also involves the game 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:36.620
 but in a graphic way 

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:41.340
 try to represent a little the five 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:44.130
 centuries of history and battles that 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:46.320
 they travel this year empire interest are we 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:47.400
 the idea of using the likes happened 

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:49.740
 of the most representative characters 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:52.330
 who participated in these five centuries 

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:54.280
 of battles 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:58.510
 busts of characters of the most famous 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:04:01.390
 July Caesar and Cleopatra August Villa 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:03.070
 pto a cover of a video game is a 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:04.900
 little like the movie poster we have to 

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:06.610
 communicate in a very small space all 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.200
 what contains what the game contains 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:10.570
 convey the sensations that we want 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.430
 we want to transmit but that is going to 

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:15.310
 contain the game in each of the 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:17.709
 great empire battles a 3 appears 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:19.690
 always an introductory video that of 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:21.910
 an attractive form places the player in 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:25.300
 historical context in which 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:27.730
 develop the whole campaign and help or 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:30.820
 it serves as an introduction just before 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:33.220
 to take power for the realization of 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:37.500
 the videos we use some images in 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:37.500
 2d that we cut 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:43.700
 we separate by layers then we incorporate 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:47.420
 to adobe to 13 

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:49.550
 and there we encourage her to light up and then in 

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:52.390
 this case we add a little something in 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:52.390
 3-d that was the standard 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:58.270
 Emperor Marco Aurelio is not 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:00.040
 willing to tolerate this boldness and 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:03.300
 puts in front of the biggest army 

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:03.300
 known until then 

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:09.690
 the objective to expel the invaders more 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:13.490
 beyond the danube and end once and for all 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:13.490
 all with the barbarian threat 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:17.699
 the users in empire a 3 the truth 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:19.800
 is that it does not play a fundamental role in 

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:22.680
 the development of the game because with its 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:24.750
 ideas and with your suggestions have good 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:27.560
 contributed to enrich the game and 

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:29.360
 truth is that we are sure that 

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:31.820
 the game will be up to 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:34.040
 expectations roman's dream is 

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:36.560
 extend your domains beyond the river 

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:39.070
 a territory is stung by the old 

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:39.070
 German 

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:46.669
 the governor July quintile and home or 

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:49.910
 assumes the mission of securing a new 

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:53.090
 border on the banks of the river 

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:55.760
 among its ranks is army an 

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:58.370
 general of German origin willing to 

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:59.760
 give up rome to defend his 

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:01.710
 body 

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:03.630
 make history attractive to 

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:05.100
 empire players and especially 

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:07.230
 provide them with fun in a big way 

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:09.590
 that was our goal and good 

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:18.870
 we hope we got it 

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:18.870
