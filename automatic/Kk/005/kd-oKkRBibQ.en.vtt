00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:25.270 
fills because I heard I think it was an

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:26.550 
fills because I heard I think it was an
old<00:00:25.419> Genesis<00:00:25.869> record<00:00:26.169> where<00:00:26.320> there<00:00:26.410> was<00:00:26.500> a

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:26.560 
old Genesis record where there was a

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.200 
old Genesis record where there was a
timbale<00:00:26.860> fill<00:00:27.250> really<00:00:27.520> quick<00:00:27.820> triplets

timbale fill really quick triplets

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:29.909 
timbale fill really quick triplets
across<00:00:28.509> the<00:00:28.689> time<00:00:28.899> and<00:00:29.410> I<00:00:29.470> thought<00:00:29.619> it<00:00:29.710> was<00:00:29.770> so

00:00:29.909 --> 00:00:29.919 
across the time and I thought it was so

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:31.499 
across the time and I thought it was so
cool<00:00:30.099> I<00:00:30.160> worked<00:00:30.520> on<00:00:30.640> it<00:00:30.820> worked<00:00:31.029> on<00:00:31.180> it<00:00:31.300> worked

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:31.509

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:33.040 
on it and got it down which is exactly

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.970 
on it and got it down which is exactly
that<00:00:33.220> bigger<00:00:33.489> minute<00:00:34.270> let<00:00:34.540> and<00:00:35.410> then<00:00:35.620> I<00:00:35.649> was<00:00:35.860> in

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:35.980 
that bigger minute let and then I was in

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:37.979 
that bigger minute let and then I was in
working<00:00:36.309> in<00:00:36.399> the<00:00:36.460> same<00:00:36.610> studio<00:00:37.090> in<00:00:37.360> London

00:00:37.979 --> 00:00:37.989 
working in the same studio in London

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:39.389 
working in the same studio in London
where<00:00:38.110> that<00:00:38.260> was<00:00:38.380> recorded<00:00:38.829> it<00:00:38.950> and<00:00:39.070> I

00:00:39.389 --> 00:00:39.399 
where that was recorded it and I

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:40.709 
where that was recorded it and I
mentioned<00:00:39.730> it<00:00:39.790> to<00:00:39.820> one<00:00:40.030> of<00:00:40.120> the<00:00:40.180> engineers<00:00:40.570> he

00:00:40.709 --> 00:00:40.719 
mentioned it to one of the engineers he

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:42.720 
mentioned it to one of the engineers he
said<00:00:40.870> oh<00:00:40.899> yeah<00:00:41.110> we<00:00:41.290> slowed<00:00:41.710> the<00:00:41.860> tape<00:00:42.100> down<00:00:42.399> for

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:42.730 
said oh yeah we slowed the tape down for

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:45.000 
said oh yeah we slowed the tape down for
that<00:00:42.910> so<00:00:43.809> it's<00:00:44.260> an<00:00:44.410> interesting<00:00:44.559> case<00:00:44.829> too

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.010 
that so it's an interesting case too

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:46.139 
that so it's an interesting case too
though<00:00:45.129> I<00:00:45.160> tried<00:00:45.460> to<00:00:45.579> reproduce<00:00:45.850> something

00:00:46.139 --> 00:00:46.149 
though I tried to reproduce something

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:47.729 
though I tried to reproduce something
that<00:00:46.390> wasn't<00:00:46.690> even<00:00:46.750> human<00:00:47.140> to<00:00:47.230> begin<00:00:47.469> with<00:00:47.620> it

00:00:47.729 --> 00:00:47.739 
that wasn't even human to begin with it

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:49.200 
that wasn't even human to begin with it
was<00:00:47.829> something<00:00:48.100> it<00:00:48.160> was<00:00:48.250> done<00:00:48.370> with<00:00:48.579> a<00:00:48.940> little

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:49.210 
was something it was done with a little

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:51.810 
was something it was done with a little
extra<00:00:49.570> help<00:00:49.719> but<00:00:50.379> the<00:00:50.589> ambition<00:00:50.949> and<00:00:51.339> the

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:51.820 
extra help but the ambition and the

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:53.340 
extra help but the ambition and the
inspiration<00:00:52.239> because<00:00:52.809> I<00:00:52.899> thought<00:00:53.019> it<00:00:53.170> was<00:00:53.260> so

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:53.350 
inspiration because I thought it was so

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:54.959 
inspiration because I thought it was so
exciting<00:00:53.649> I<00:00:53.949> wanted<00:00:54.429> to<00:00:54.519> learn<00:00:54.609> how<00:00:54.760> to<00:00:54.789> do

00:00:54.959 --> 00:00:54.969 
exciting I wanted to learn how to do

00:00:54.969 --> 00:00:56.459

00:00:57.779 --> 00:00:57.789 
learning how to do something so it's

00:00:57.789 --> 00:00:59.250
