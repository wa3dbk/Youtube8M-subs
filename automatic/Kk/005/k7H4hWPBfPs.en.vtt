00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:09.389
 hello to you Artem in this video I 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.490
 tell you how you can add the necessary 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:14.370
 you switches to the control panel 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.839
 on your device so for a start us 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.779
 of course you need to install 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:21.720
 extension adding lower buttons 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.730
 the curtain and maybe the pole as the most 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.830
 functional option at the moment 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.960
 slip control center as simple and 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.820
 cheap solution or any other of 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.130
 dozens of tweaks created 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.960
 especially for this most 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.850
 supplement already have their own bases 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.100
 switches and you can output 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.200
 control function you need 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.460
 panel 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.649
 However, what to do if the author does not 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.570
 provided for the function you need in your 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.820
 tweaks or do you want to include or 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.370
 switch some specific option 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.559
 setting or any action on your 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.270
 device 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:56.699
 authors of some peaks themselves add 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.469
 special button like tweak 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.710
 display recorder for quick power up 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:03.000
 or disable recording 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:05.430
 if some functionality you do not 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.430
 grabs pay attention to the extension 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.049
 pole in its parameters you can not 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.880
 just add a switch or 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.450
 launch any application from the control 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.979
 panels but also create your own buttons 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:19.979
 for this we add a new entry and 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:22.170
 select the special menu which icon 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:25.259
 will glow on the buttons on further 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.750
 add the functionality we need as 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:30.180
 see the menu pole logically throws 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.310
 us on tweak activator settings 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.200
 accordingly we can give our 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.000
 buttons any functionality this 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.560
 extensions 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.689
 that is all you can do or 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.159
 start up with a scream activator 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.899
 now you can do with 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.549
 special button that will 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.189
 located at the bottom of your curtain 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:49.020
 devices describe this in detail 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.880
 process i won't if you want 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.240
 learn more answer activator then 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.350
 see the description of this video if 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.930
 here you could not find 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.540
 action you need then pay 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.850
 focus on flip switch addition 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.380
 not an independent peak but dependence 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.689
 which will be installed with any 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:10.140
 lower curtain extension 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:12.180

 two eclipse which a large amount 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.440
 additions for 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:19.750

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.760
 each of these additions will be 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:23.960
 add one or more 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.300
 switches 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:28.280
 which you can install or 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.620

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.880
 There are a large number of settings 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.850
 allowing you to add buttons for often 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.440
 common cydia tweaks 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:47.300
 also buttons for quick 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.040
 actions that cannot be done 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:51.650
 using the flip control center 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.390
 however, they are all duplicated by actions 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.000
 activator which can be added through 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:59.090
 track pole for example is a reboot 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.160

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:08.090
 end and you will find 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:10.280

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.820

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:19.460
 The first option allows you to enable 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:22.190
 standard setting in with inverting 

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:23.930
