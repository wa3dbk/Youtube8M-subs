I was looking to learn a new champion
for<00:01:54.600> mid<00:01:54.780> lane<00:01:54.960> so<00:01:55.170> I<00:01:55.229> made<00:01:55.409> a<00:01:55.439> list<00:01:55.649> of<00:01:55.770> about

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
for mid lane so I made a list of about

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.590 
for mid lane so I made a list of about
eight<00:01:56.250> to<00:01:56.399> twelve<00:01:56.520> champions<00:01:57.060> that<00:01:57.210> fit<00:01:57.450> my

eight to twelve champions that fit my

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.690 
eight to twelve champions that fit my
criteria<00:01:57.799> from<00:01:58.799> there<00:01:59.040> you<00:01:59.250> can<00:01:59.399> take<00:01:59.549> out

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
criteria from there you can take out

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.459 
criteria from there you can take out
champions<00:02:00.149> that<00:02:00.299> you<00:02:00.390> just<00:02:00.600> can't<00:02:01.049> really<00:02:01.320> see

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
champions that you just can't really see

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.289

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
well as champions that you think will

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.859 
well as champions that you think will
not<00:02:04.740> be<00:02:04.890> fun<00:02:05.189> and<00:02:05.399> go<00:02:05.610> from<00:02:05.790> there<00:02:06.000> don't<00:02:06.780> be

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
not be fun and go from there don't be

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.109 
not be fun and go from there don't be
afraid<00:02:07.229> to<00:02:07.350> play<00:02:07.469> off<00:02:07.710> meta<00:02:08.039> picks<00:02:08.369> especially

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
afraid to play off meta picks especially

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.999 
afraid to play off meta picks especially
since<00:02:09.330> it<00:02:09.420> is<00:02:09.539> kind<00:02:09.840> of<00:02:09.899> just<00:02:10.080> Sola<00:02:10.349> q<00:02:10.619> anyways

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
since it is kind of just Sola q anyways

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.770 
since it is kind of just Sola q anyways
it's<00:02:11.520> better<00:02:11.790> to<00:02:11.940> play<00:02:12.060> a<00:02:12.150> champion<00:02:12.599> that<00:02:12.720> you

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
it's better to play a champion that you

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.400 
it's better to play a champion that you
can<00:02:12.959> do<00:02:13.080> well

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
can do well

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.200 
can do well
then<00:02:13.980> a<00:02:14.010> champion<00:02:14.460> that<00:02:14.580> is<00:02:14.670> strong<00:02:14.940> in<00:02:15.120> the

removal was one of my personal favorite

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.650 
removal was one of my personal favorite
champions<00:02:22.200> and<00:02:22.410> I<00:02:22.710> had<00:02:22.890> about<00:02:23.040> a<00:02:23.190> 65%<00:02:24.120> win<00:02:24.480> rate

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.480 
champions and I had about a 65% win rate
on<00:02:24.780> her<00:02:24.960> in<00:02:25.110> the<00:02:25.230> mid<00:02:25.380> lane<00:02:25.650> and<00:02:25.920> I<00:02:26.130> was<00:02:26.280> great

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
on her in the mid lane and I was great

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:27.650 
on her in the mid lane and I was great
at<00:02:26.610> playing<00:02:26.760> the<00:02:26.910> really<00:02:27.180> aggressive

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
at playing the really aggressive

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.570 
at playing the really aggressive
assassin<00:02:28.350> playstyle<00:02:28.770> and<00:02:28.980> starting<00:02:29.370> team

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
assassin playstyle and starting team

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.280 
assassin playstyle and starting team
fights<00:02:29.820> with<00:02:30.000> her<00:02:30.150> after<00:02:30.810> her<00:02:30.930> changes

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
fights with her after her changes

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.140 
fights with her after her changes
however<00:02:31.560> even<00:02:32.010> when<00:02:32.160> she<00:02:32.280> was<00:02:32.430> really<00:02:32.790> really

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
however even when she was really really

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.540 
however even when she was really really
overpowered<00:02:33.810> and<00:02:33.990> had<00:02:34.110> a<00:02:34.140> 58%<00:02:34.860> win<00:02:35.220> rate<00:02:35.400> and

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
overpowered and had a 58% win rate and

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.190 
overpowered and had a 58% win rate and
solo<00:02:35.760> queue<00:02:35.970> across<00:02:36.330> the<00:02:36.510> board<00:02:36.750> I<00:02:36.900> actually

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
solo queue across the board I actually

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.410 
solo queue across the board I actually
performed<00:02:37.610> terribly<00:02:38.610> on<00:02:38.760> her<00:02:38.970> because<00:02:39.180> she

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
performed terribly on her because she

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.540 
performed terribly on her because she
shifted<00:02:39.840> to<00:02:39.960> being<00:02:40.170> more<00:02:40.410> of<00:02:40.470> a<00:02:40.650> kite<00:02:41.010> and<00:02:41.250> poke

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
shifted to being more of a kite and poke

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.000 
shifted to being more of a kite and poke
mage<00:02:41.910> and<00:02:42.120> got<00:02:42.630> a<00:02:42.660> lot<00:02:42.960> worse<00:02:43.260> at<00:02:43.500> aggressive

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
mage and got a lot worse at aggressive

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.370 
mage and got a lot worse at aggressive
play<00:02:44.190> and<00:02:44.400> initiations<00:02:45.150> and<00:02:45.390> so<00:02:45.930> my<00:02:46.080> win<00:02:46.350> rate

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
play and initiations and so my win rate

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.440 
play and initiations and so my win rate
on<00:02:46.710> her<00:02:46.860> plummeted<00:02:47.340> to<00:02:47.490> of<00:02:47.640> actually<00:02:48.210> around

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
on her plummeted to of actually around

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.110 
on her plummeted to of actually around
20%<00:02:48.840> or<00:02:49.380> so<00:02:49.410> despite<00:02:50.310> the<00:02:50.460> fact<00:02:50.700> that<00:02:50.790> she<00:02:50.970> was

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
20% or so despite the fact that she was

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.790 
20% or so despite the fact that she was
easily<00:02:51.540> the<00:02:51.690> strongest<00:02:51.750> champion<00:02:52.620> in<00:02:52.710> the

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
easily the strongest champion in the

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.280 
easily the strongest champion in the
game<00:02:53.040> at<00:02:53.250> the<00:02:53.370> time<00:02:53.580> since<00:02:54.210> she<00:02:54.480> no<00:02:54.690> longer<00:02:54.720> fit

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
game at the time since she no longer fit

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.890 
game at the time since she no longer fit
my<00:02:55.440> personal<00:02:56.010> playstyle<00:02:56.280> so<00:02:57.180> after<00:02:57.480> narrowing

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
my personal playstyle so after narrowing

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.870 
my personal playstyle so after narrowing
down<00:02:58.020> a<00:02:58.410> new<00:02:58.620> list<00:02:58.830> of<00:02:58.980> mid<00:02:59.190> laners<00:02:59.520> to<00:02:59.670> around

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
down a new list of mid laners to around

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.610 
down a new list of mid laners to around
three<00:03:00.120> or<00:03:00.150> four<00:03:00.360> champions<00:03:00.870> I<00:03:01.020> ended<00:03:01.560> up

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
three or four champions I ended up

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.410 
three or four champions I ended up
deciding<00:03:01.770> that<00:03:02.250> learning<00:03:02.670> a<00:03:02.790> knee<00:03:02.910> mate<00:03:03.240> would

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
deciding that learning a knee mate would

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:04.940 
deciding that learning a knee mate would
actually<00:03:03.690> be<00:03:03.810> the<00:03:03.900> best<00:03:04.050> option<00:03:04.320> for<00:03:04.530> me<00:03:04.770> since

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
actually be the best option for me since

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.100 
actually be the best option for me since
