I personally think that was probably one
of<00:01:08.119> the<00:01:08.299> biggest<00:01:08.840> benefits<00:01:09.020> for<00:01:09.470> me<00:01:09.560> this<00:01:09.770> year

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
same not not like it had held and then

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:03.050 
same not not like it had held and then
we<00:03:00.060> got<00:03:00.269> off<00:03:00.450> at<00:03:00.780> 4:30<00:03:01.530> 5<00:03:02.160> o'clock<00:03:02.190> it<00:03:02.700> started

pouring<00:03:03.359> rain<00:03:03.690> and<00:03:03.959> the<00:03:04.019> wind<00:03:04.139> stopped<00:03:04.560> so<00:03:04.980> I

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
pouring rain and the wind stopped so I

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.090 
pouring rain and the wind stopped so I
think<00:03:05.970> when<00:03:06.299> we<00:03:06.420> started<00:03:06.870> my<00:03:07.380> captain<00:03:07.799> told<00:03:07.980> me

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
think when we started my captain told me

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.670 
think when we started my captain told me
it<00:03:08.220> was<00:03:08.340> like<00:03:08.370> straight<00:03:08.880> a<00:03:08.910> stand<00:03:09.569> he's<00:03:10.440> from

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
it was like straight a stand he's from

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.479 
it was like straight a stand he's from
Molokai<00:03:11.100> and<00:03:11.130> he<00:03:11.760> would<00:03:11.940> just<00:03:12.150> was<00:03:12.959> like<00:03:13.489> it's

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489 
Molokai and he would just was like it's

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:17.210 
Molokai and he would just was like it's
the<00:03:14.639> best<00:03:14.849> wind<00:03:15.060> you<00:03:15.180> could<00:03:15.299> get<00:03:15.769> it<00:03:16.769> obviously

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
the best wind you could get it obviously

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.069 
the best wind you could get it obviously
went<00:03:17.430> to<00:03:17.609> be<00:03:17.700> an<00:03:17.790> ace<00:03:17.970> nor<00:03:18.269> ace<00:03:18.480> once<00:03:18.840> we<00:03:18.959> got

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:19.079 
went to be an ace nor ace once we got

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:21.530 
went to be an ace nor ace once we got
out<00:03:19.290> in<00:03:19.410> the<00:03:19.440> channel<00:03:19.889> that<00:03:20.099> I<00:03:20.420> don't<00:03:21.420> know<00:03:21.510> I

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
out in the channel that I don't know I

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.190 
out in the channel that I don't know I
haven't<00:03:21.840> done<00:03:22.109> it<00:03:22.230> many<00:03:22.380> times<00:03:22.739> but<00:03:23.099> it's<00:03:24.200> if

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
haven't done it many times but it's if

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.659 
haven't done it many times but it's if
it<00:03:25.470> gets<00:03:25.650> better<00:03:25.920> than<00:03:26.099> that

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:26.669 
it gets better than that

00:03:26.669 --> 00:03:28.400 
it gets better than that
I<00:03:26.700> found<00:03:27.389> why<00:03:27.569> had<00:03:27.660> to<00:03:27.750> saddle<00:03:28.079> up<00:03:28.139> when<00:03:28.319> it

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
I found why had to saddle up when it

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:29.809 
I found why had to saddle up when it
gets<00:03:28.440> better<00:03:28.859> than<00:03:29.040> that<00:03:29.099> because<00:03:29.459> it<00:03:29.700> was

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:29.819 
gets better than that because it was

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:32.870 
gets better than that because it was
pretty<00:03:30.030> amazing<00:03:30.389> I<00:03:30.780> was<00:03:31.109> up<00:03:31.500> with<00:03:32.489> the<00:03:32.700> rice

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
pretty amazing I was up with the rice

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.409 
pretty amazing I was up with the rice
like<00:03:33.889> there's<00:03:34.889> plenty<00:03:35.190> of<00:03:35.370> times<00:03:35.639> I<00:03:35.910> guess<00:03:36.150> you

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:36.419 
like there's plenty of times I guess you

00:03:36.419 --> 00:03:38.809 
like there's plenty of times I guess you
don't<00:03:37.290> want<00:03:37.440> to<00:03:37.590> throw<00:03:37.769> the<00:03:37.829> Talia<00:03:38.430> myth<00:03:38.640> you

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:38.819 
don't want to throw the Talia myth you

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:40.640 
don't want to throw the Talia myth you
just<00:03:39.060> probably<00:03:39.810> half<00:03:39.989> thinking<00:03:40.500> yourself

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
just probably half thinking yourself

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.250 
just probably half thinking yourself
what<00:03:41.159> am<00:03:41.250> I<00:03:41.340> doing<00:03:41.370> here

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
what am I doing here

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.619 
what am I doing here
that's<00:03:43.260> definitely<00:03:44.030> if<00:03:45.030> you<00:03:45.269> don't<00:03:45.450> like

00:03:45.619 --> 00:03:45.629 
that's definitely if you don't like

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:47.059 
that's definitely if you don't like
putting<00:03:45.900> yourself<00:03:46.200> through<00:03:46.260> time<00:03:46.620> I<00:03:46.650> guess

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:47.069 
putting yourself through time I guess

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:49.210 
putting yourself through time I guess
it's<00:03:47.280> definitely<00:03:47.730> not<00:03:47.849> the<00:03:47.970> rice<00:03:48.150> for<00:03:48.360> you<00:03:48.420> but

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.220 
it's definitely not the rice for you but

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:53.809 
it's definitely not the rice for you but
physically<00:03:50.329> it's<00:03:51.329> challenging<00:03:51.959> but<00:03:52.260> I<00:03:52.819> think

00:03:53.809 --> 00:03:53.819 
physically it's challenging but I think

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:55.880 
physically it's challenging but I think
the<00:03:54.209> mental<00:03:54.480> side<00:03:54.840> of<00:03:55.049> it<00:03:55.170> is<00:03:55.319> the<00:03:55.500> one<00:03:55.650> that

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
the mental side of it is the one that

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:58.699 
the mental side of it is the one that
really<00:03:56.159> really<00:03:56.959> gets<00:03:57.959> a<00:03:58.079> lot<00:03:58.110> of<00:03:58.349> people

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709 
really really gets a lot of people

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:00.759 
really really gets a lot of people
especially<00:03:58.950> if<00:03:59.220> it's<00:03:59.370> their<00:03:59.549> first<00:03:59.790> time<00:04:00.120> like

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:00.769 
especially if it's their first time like

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:05.089 
especially if it's their first time like
yeah<00:04:02.360> it's<00:04:03.360> a<00:04:03.510> combination<00:04:03.840> of<00:04:04.349> I<00:04:04.590> guess<00:04:04.920> the

00:04:05.089 --> 00:04:05.099 
yeah it's a combination of I guess the

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:06.979 
yeah it's a combination of I guess the
whole<00:04:05.280> lot<00:04:05.579> that<00:04:05.610> just<00:04:06.090> really<00:04:06.540> takes<00:04:06.780> its

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:06.989 
whole lot that just really takes its

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:09.229 
whole lot that just really takes its
toll<00:04:07.230> and<00:04:07.560> you<00:04:07.680> and<00:04:07.950> then<00:04:08.640> you're<00:04:08.819> out<00:04:08.849> there

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
toll and you and then you're out there

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:11.059 
toll and you and then you're out there
for<00:04:09.420> that<00:04:09.540> long<00:04:09.599> as<00:04:10.019> well<00:04:10.260> it<00:04:10.650> was<00:04:10.799> a<00:04:10.860> great

and everything really working for us to
go<00:04:30.479> within<00:04:30.840> I<00:04:31.080> think<00:04:31.140> we'll<00:04:31.469> two<00:04:31.650> minutes<00:04:31.979> off

00:04:32.089 --> 00:04:32.099 
go within I think we'll two minutes off

00:04:32.099 --> 00:04:34.070 
go within I think we'll two minutes off
the<00:04:32.130> record<00:04:32.610> this<00:04:32.760> year<00:04:32.820> or<00:04:33.240> I<00:04:33.450> ran<00:04:33.840> to<00:04:33.960> be

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 
the record this year or I ran to be

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.370 
the record this year or I ran to be
absent<00:04:34.729> I'd<00:04:35.729> like<00:04:35.969> to<00:04:36.180> have<00:04:36.840> another<00:04:36.870> crack<00:04:37.320> at

it<00:04:37.620> next<00:04:37.800> year<00:04:37.979> I<00:04:38.039> think<00:04:38.130> the<00:04:38.370> times<00:04:38.640> might<00:04:38.940> be

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090 
it next year I think the times might be

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:41.600 
it next year I think the times might be
a<00:04:39.120> lot<00:04:39.330> different<00:04:39.919> record<00:04:40.919> pace<00:04:41.159> might<00:04:41.460> be

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:41.610 
a lot different record pace might be

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:43.640 
a lot different record pace might be
other<00:04:41.760> question<00:04:42.330> that<00:04:42.360> definitely<00:04:43.349> first

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:43.650 
other question that definitely first

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:45.989 
other question that definitely first
place<00:04:43.890> is<00:04:44.490> an<00:04:44.669> animal<00:04:45.000> question

00:04:45.989 --> 00:04:45.999 
place is an animal question

00:04:45.999 --> 00:04:49.349 
place is an animal question
that's<00:04:46.719> what<00:04:46.899> I<00:04:46.929> live<00:04:47.169> for
