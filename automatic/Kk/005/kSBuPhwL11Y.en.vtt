00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.809

 sticker program does not prepare that 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.210
 takes so long 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.229

 minako trainee banja I like that 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.860
 I have to say I always have 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.770
 fear that the vista broke so bad 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:10.930
 in support but then we have here 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:13.040

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.000
 are worse things would have also each 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:35.120
 page can be clicked then 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:36.950
 Barnim, I think that's nicely done here 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.630
 Hope the kids did not have it outside 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.260
 and my neighbors are serving outside 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:41.710
 grilling 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:45.230
 i think i have that one myself 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:46.460
 yummy love barbecue then yes 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:50.660
 we have changes again and here 

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:52.610
 a beautiful buckland and can tell 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:56.090
 not every movie of the time like to see there 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:58.820
 has looked or good followers see 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:01.070
 So for me it's a special one 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:04.040
 suppose I liked it was printed 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:06.320
 the music is natural for me 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.570
 once the best season was also very 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:10.280
 sad but also the others 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:13.090
 poor fallen and census and christel 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:15.650

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:18.920
 I am the old city at least graduated 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:22.000
 One thing better , I know that's easy 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:26.090
 to sign style that's all too 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:28.070
 I'd say sterile announced be the 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:32.270
 look dangerous situation but me 

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:34.280
 like old love with twenty wrong ones 

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:36.260

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:41.660
 say, sign the drawing style, the role 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:43.310

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:44.510
 at the beginning still too thin and had one 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:46.340
 that is really big 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:46.989
 optimal on the but the head sums 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.120

00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:47.580

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:51.630
 brother of bunny player not at all 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:55.500
 More rarely sees or would have to 

00:05:51.630 --> 00:06:00.720
 Well that was on boxing to the two times 

00:05:55.500 --> 00:06:02.539
 count and box three and four and glad 

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:04.770
 that they have missing a few more 

00:06:02.539 --> 00:06:05.280
 but which one at all again 

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:06.780
 to buy 

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:08.699
 I do not say when, but I will 

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:10.530
 Bring it to me in any case and if 

00:06:08.699 --> 00:06:13.380
 Now, yes, at that time liked to watch and 

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:14.699
 that belongs to your childhood can become 

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:17.010
 still buy today of course 

00:06:14.699 --> 00:06:19.919
 the picture is not the best it is 

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:21.660
 Classics as far as the anima but me 

00:06:19.919 --> 00:06:23.460
 think the picture looks better than 

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:25.530
 many earlier have so many on amazon 

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:29.060
 So at least the standard people say 

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:31.139
 I once criticized the picture and 

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:33.570
 I even think that the picture is better 

00:06:31.139 --> 00:06:35.639
 looks like what that was 

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:39.440
 American German pink line for 

00:06:35.639 --> 00:06:41.849
 this discussion does not come up again 

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:44.120
 I open it but I think so 

00:06:41.849 --> 00:06:46.139
 German picture is totally okay and 

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:47.729
 I do not know why everything has always 

00:06:46.139 --> 00:06:48.750
 So need to talk bad you can 

00:06:47.729 --> 00:06:49.889
 be glad that it appeared 

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:52.650
 Of course my price can always be 

00:06:49.889 --> 00:06:54.360
 argue that I agree but so 

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:57.510
 bad is the alliance in classic 

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:58.830
 you just have to say and who it is 

00:06:57.510 --> 00:07:00.240
 I do not like that I should not live 

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:01.740
 or should be just Japanese 

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:03.990
 French thus can almost never 

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:05.970
 after that, that's how I see it 

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:07.320
 that's the easiest if you do not 

00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:10.500
 I would not know and get the 

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:12.150
 version you like best yes 

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:13.860
 Of course that 's it from me again 

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:15.129
 Of course I say in the end I have in 

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:17.409
 last time always 

00:07:15.129 --> 00:07:18.459
 rubber wander no matter how bad I am 

00:07:17.409 --> 00:07:19.779
 thank a spectator and 

00:07:18.459 --> 00:07:21.249
 Subscribers are taking their time for my new one 

00:07:19.779 --> 00:07:22.360
 video I hope that has taken 

00:07:21.249 --> 00:07:23.499
 fell again significantly and over 

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:24.189
 I would rate comments 

00:07:23.499 --> 00:07:25.929
 of course happy 

00:07:24.189 --> 00:07:28.289
 See you again next time 

00:07:25.929 --> 00:07:28.289
 Bye
