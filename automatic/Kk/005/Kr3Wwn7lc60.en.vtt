the<00:01:09.960> eyes<00:01:11.090> some<00:01:12.090> more<00:01:12.240> separate<00:01:12.570> it<00:01:12.720> I<00:01:12.810> think

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
the eyes some more separate it I think

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.240 
the eyes some more separate it I think
those<00:01:13.140> are<00:01:13.170> I<00:01:13.500> think<00:01:13.650> that's<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.040> type<00:01:14.220> of

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
those are I think that's the type of

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.670 
those are I think that's the type of
test<00:01:14.490> symbol<00:01:14.850> not<00:01:15.840> sure<00:01:16.049> what<00:01:16.170> that<00:01:16.200> is<00:01:16.380> that

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
test symbol not sure what that is that

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.940 
test symbol not sure what that is that
oh<00:01:16.979> sorry<00:01:17.369> separatist<00:01:18.360> symbol<00:01:18.720> and<00:01:19.470> then<00:01:19.650> I

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
oh sorry separatist symbol and then I

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.969 
oh sorry separatist symbol and then I
think<00:01:20.729> that's<00:01:20.909> just<00:01:20.970> like<00:01:21.180> glass<00:01:21.530> in<00:01:22.530> detail

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:12.210 
that off cover up the other bit spin
around<00:02:05.490> and<00:02:05.969> think<00:02:06.570> the<00:02:06.689> other<00:02:06.869> side

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.590 

and<00:02:13.220> then<00:02:13.550> there<00:02:13.790> you<00:02:13.880> go<00:02:13.970> that's<00:02:14.390> what<00:02:14.540> we

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
and then there you go that's what we

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:19.240 
and then there you go that's what we
look<00:02:14.690> like<00:02:14.750> it<00:02:15.020> feels<00:02:15.170> flying<00:02:18.160> channel<00:02:19.160> me

should<00:02:39.260> I<00:02:39.410> I<00:02:40.570> think<00:02:41.570> I<00:02:41.900> think<00:02:42.140> they<00:02:42.230> made<00:02:42.380> a<00:02:42.440> new

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
should I I think I think they made a new

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.949 
should I I think I think they made a new
piece<00:02:42.890> for<00:02:43.430> this<00:02:43.580> sat<00:02:43.790> I'm<00:02:44.000> not<00:02:44.120> sure<00:02:44.180> if<00:02:44.660> this

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
piece for this sat I'm not sure if this

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:47.979 
piece for this sat I'm not sure if this
is<00:02:45.020> new<00:02:45.320> piece<00:02:45.650> or<00:02:45.830> not<00:02:46.390> you<00:02:47.390> just<00:02:47.630> put<00:02:47.959> that

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:47.989 
is new piece or not you just put that

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:53.199 
is new piece or not you just put that
back<00:02:48.320> on<00:02:48.470> I<00:02:50.860> took<00:02:51.860> apart<00:02:52.340> all<00:02:52.520> my<00:02:52.670> Lego<00:02:52.820> Star

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:53.209 
back on I took apart all my Lego Star

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:54.040 
back on I took apart all my Lego Star
with<00:02:53.390> sense<00:02:53.540> and<00:02:53.690> put<00:02:53.810> them<00:02:53.930> all<00:02:54.020> back

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.050 
with sense and put them all back

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:55.420 
with sense and put them all back
together<00:02:54.350> so<00:02:54.680> that's<00:02:54.739> why<00:02:54.950> some<00:02:55.190> of<00:02:55.220> the

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
together so that's why some of the

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:58.810 
together so that's why some of the
pieces<00:02:56.239> aren't<00:02:57.010> color-coordinated<00:02:58.010> as<00:02:58.190> they

00:02:58.810 --> 00:02:58.820 
pieces aren't color-coordinated as they

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:01.060 
pieces aren't color-coordinated as they
should<00:02:58.880> be<00:02:59.209> only<00:03:00.020> piece<00:03:00.350> I<00:03:00.560> noticed<00:03:00.950> right

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.070 
should be only piece I noticed right

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:05.970 
should be only piece I noticed right
away<00:03:01.130> isn't<00:03:01.730> is<00:03:02.150> a<00:03:03.160> this<00:03:04.160> light<00:03:04.459> gray<00:03:04.959> piece

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
away isn't is a this light gray piece

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.290

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:49.610 
don't know what those ions are I thought

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:51.280 
don't know what those ions are I thought
that<00:03:49.820> was<00:03:49.940> a<00:03:49.970> clone<00:03:50.269> Ellen<00:03:50.600> Ellen<00:03:50.750> on<00:03:50.959> public

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:51.290 
that was a clone Ellen Ellen on public

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:52.840 
that was a clone Ellen Ellen on public
emblems<00:03:51.680> but<00:03:51.860> now<00:03:52.010> I<00:03:52.250> know<00:03:52.370> what<00:03:52.670> those

over cockpit we show you the cockpit

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.470 
over cockpit we show you the cockpit
opens<00:04:09.870> up<00:04:10.580> compared<00:04:11.580> I'll<00:04:11.820> be<00:04:11.940> ones<00:04:12.180> this<00:04:12.420> is

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
opens up compared I'll be ones this is

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:16.699 
opens up compared I'll be ones this is
on<00:04:13.790> piece<00:04:14.790> like<00:04:15.210> like<00:04:15.810> just<00:04:16.049> just<00:04:16.260> like<00:04:16.380> drop

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:16.709 
on piece like like just just like drop

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:19.370 
on piece like like just just like drop
is<00:04:16.920> the<00:04:17.910> other<00:04:18.180> one<00:04:18.360> was<00:04:18.540> I<00:04:18.720> don't<00:04:18.989> know<00:04:19.080> how<00:04:19.320> to

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
is the other one was I don't know how to

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:22.280 
is the other one was I don't know how to
explain<00:04:19.739> the<00:04:19.920> pieces<00:04:20.510> it<00:04:21.510> was<00:04:21.690> like<00:04:21.810> a<00:04:21.840> circle

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:22.290 
explain the pieces it was like a circle

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:24.260 
explain the pieces it was like a circle
thing<00:04:22.500> through<00:04:22.920> a<00:04:22.980> cross<00:04:23.310> thing<00:04:23.610> so<00:04:23.790> just<00:04:23.880> drop

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
thing through a cross thing so just drop

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:27.950 
thing through a cross thing so just drop
easily<00:04:24.660> this<00:04:24.840> one<00:04:25.080> is<00:04:25.320> unlike<00:04:26.280> the<00:04:26.810> click<00:04:27.810> on

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960 
easily this one is unlike the click on

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.770 
easily this one is unlike the click on
together<00:04:28.350> can<00:04:28.620> go<00:04:28.740> down<00:04:28.980> it<00:04:29.130> up<00:04:29.280> like<00:04:29.580> that

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:29.780 
together can go down it up like that

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:33.230 
together can go down it up like that
yeah<00:04:30.780> if<00:04:31.290> you<00:04:31.440> can<00:04:31.590> get<00:04:31.830> no<00:04:32.670> time<00:04:32.940> out<00:04:33.150> from

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:33.240 
yeah if you can get no time out from

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:37.820 
yeah if you can get no time out from
look<00:04:33.420> right<00:04:33.870> here<00:04:36.050> there<00:04:37.050> you<00:04:37.140> go<00:04:37.200> get<00:04:37.740> the

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830 
look right here there you go get the
