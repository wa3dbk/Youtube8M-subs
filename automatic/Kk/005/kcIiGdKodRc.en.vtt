00:00:00.533 --> 00:00:02.333
What’s up Krisstina?

00:00:02.333 --> 00:00:06.933
I’ll have the usual. Bed #4, full time.

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.500
So I’m like good to go, right?

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.700
I know what you’ve been doing, Onomatopoeia.

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.333
Ok, so I’ve been tanning naked.

00:00:24.333 --> 00:00:27.167
Big deal! Everyone does it.

00:00:27.167 --> 00:00:29.067
I’m not talking about that.

00:00:29.067 --> 00:00:34.067
I’m talking about how you’ve been using Jenny on your own team.

00:00:34.067 --> 00:00:37.700
She is apart of my team, Team Leather-Face.

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:42.200
Hey, Jenny’s pro now that she’s apart of Team Bitch-Slap.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.333
No, I’m the reason she’s pro. Not you.

00:00:46.333 --> 00:00:49.867
Whatever. So is my tanning bed ready?

00:00:49.867 --> 00:00:53.700
No. You are banned from this tanning salon.

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.233
You can’t ban me! I’m your best customer.

00:00:57.233 --> 00:01:04.233
Best customer? We end up losing money because you take advantage of
our unlimited pass!

00:01:04.233 --> 00:01:06.700
Hey, I know a good deal when I see one.

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:07.667
Get out!

00:01:07.667 --> 00:01:12.967
Wait, wait, wait. How about this. Let’s make a little deal.

00:01:12.967 --> 00:01:15.067
The two of us have duel.

00:01:15.067 --> 00:01:16.833
I’m listening.

00:01:16.833 --> 00:01:20.967
If you win, I’ll kick Jenny off my team.

00:01:20.967 --> 00:01:27.667
But if I win, she can stay on my team, and I can tan here every day
of the month.

00:01:27.667 --> 00:01:29.567
What do you say?

00:01:29.567 --> 00:01:34.900
Onomatopoeia, you’ve got a deal.

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:47.700
It’s time you learn, Onomatopoeia, you’re just not as pro as you
think you are.

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:48.833
Draw.

00:01:54.167 --> 00:02:00.600
I’ll Summon Amazoness Chain Master.

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.867
And set this face-down.

00:02:03.867 --> 00:02:06.433
You’re move.

00:02:09.833 --> 00:02:11.000
Draw.

00:02:17.067 --> 00:02:20.467
I’ll activate Future Visions.

00:02:35.967 --> 00:02:40.167
And I’ll Summon Fortune Lady Light.

00:02:40.167 --> 00:02:44.100
Future Visions goes off, and Light’s removed.

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:49.400
Then her effect to Summon Fortune Lady Fire.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:55.033
And with her effect I’ll destroy Amazoness Chain Master.

00:02:55.033 --> 00:02:59.967
I’ll use my trap Dramatic Rescue

00:02:59.967 --> 00:03:05.767
And Summon Amazoness Queen.

00:03:05.767 --> 00:03:11.233
I’ll set card face-down. And end my turn.

00:03:11.233 --> 00:03:12.367
Draw.

00:03:17.667 --> 00:03:23.467
I tricked you, Onomatopoeia. I had this card all along

00:03:23.467 --> 00:03:26.367
Amazoness Village.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.867
I’ll Summon Amazoness Sage.

00:03:39.867 --> 00:03:44.433
I’ll Torrential!

00:03:46.967 --> 00:03:55.467
Village’s effect goes off, and I’ll Summon a second Queen

00:03:55.467 --> 00:03:58.367
And I’ll activate Solidarity.

00:03:58.367 --> 00:04:03.167
We’re talking 3400 ATK.

00:04:03.167 --> 00:04:05.867
Attack directly!

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:13.933
You’re move.

00:04:13.933 --> 00:04:15.500
I draw.

00:04:21.067 --> 00:04:24.600
I don’t care that Fortune Lady Light’s not coming back.

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.567
I’ll use Fortune’s Future!

00:04:27.567 --> 00:04:32.233
Returning Light to draw two cards.

00:04:32.233 --> 00:04:35.233
Next, I’ll use Sarco

00:04:35.233 --> 00:04:38.733
to remove Necroface.

00:04:38.733 --> 00:04:40.533
And now it’s effect

00:04:40.533 --> 00:04:44.233
Removing five cards from the top of our decks.

00:04:55.167 --> 00:04:59.933
I’ll set a monster, and it’s you're move.
