my name is Arctic you and today I want
to<00:00:15.719> talk<00:00:15.870> about<00:00:16.170> Iraq<00:00:16.560> saw<00:00:16.830> as<00:00:17.130> a<00:00:17.160> moneymaker

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
to talk about Iraq saw as a moneymaker

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.510 
to talk about Iraq saw as a moneymaker
because<00:00:18.510> I<00:00:18.539> feel<00:00:18.960> that<00:00:19.289> a<00:00:19.439> lot<00:00:19.470> of<00:00:19.890> people<00:00:20.279> have

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
because I feel that a lot of people have

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.670 
because I feel that a lot of people have
really<00:00:20.939> underestimated<00:00:21.840> the<00:00:22.140> amount<00:00:22.529> of

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
really underestimated the amount of

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.250 
really underestimated the amount of
money<00:00:23.039> that<00:00:23.550> you<00:00:23.730> can<00:00:23.850> make<00:00:24.119> by<00:00:24.480> killing<00:00:24.960> Iraq

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
money that you can make by killing Iraq

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.279 
money that you can make by killing Iraq
so<00:00:25.500> so<00:00:25.980> when<00:00:26.250> Iraq<00:00:26.640> sir<00:00:26.849> was<00:00:27.150> first<00:00:27.480> released<00:00:27.869> a

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
so so when Iraq sir was first released a

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.529 
so so when Iraq sir was first released a
lot<00:00:28.500> of<00:00:28.650> people<00:00:29.010> consider<00:00:29.550> that<00:00:29.640> it's<00:00:30.210> worse

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
lot of people consider that it's worse

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.200 
lot of people consider that it's worse
money<00:00:30.929> than<00:00:31.320> QbD<00:00:31.859> per<00:00:32.070> hour<00:00:32.250> since<00:00:32.940> the

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
money than QbD per hour since the

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.540 
money than QbD per hour since the
regular<00:00:33.570> load<00:00:33.870> from<00:00:34.200> Iraq<00:00:34.530> sir<00:00:34.770> isn't<00:00:35.250> that

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
regular load from Iraq sir isn't that

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.209 
regular load from Iraq sir isn't that
good<00:00:36.059> but<00:00:36.690> now<00:00:36.870> that<00:00:37.110> we<00:00:37.290> have<00:00:37.530> some<00:00:37.829> kind<00:00:38.070> of

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
good but now that we have some kind of

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.790 
good but now that we have some kind of
rough<00:00:38.600> estimations<00:00:39.600> for<00:00:39.899> the<00:00:40.110> spiraling

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
rough estimations for the spiraling

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.639 
rough estimations for the spiraling
price<00:00:41.219> it's<00:00:41.820> actually<00:00:42.570> quite<00:00:42.870> a<00:00:42.899> lot<00:00:43.260> better

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
price it's actually quite a lot better

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.650 
price it's actually quite a lot better
than<00:00:44.070> just<00:00:44.460> killing<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:45.059> QPD

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
than just killing the QPD

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.049 
than just killing the QPD

so in this video I'm going to completely

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.450 
so in this video I'm going to completely
neglect<00:00:48.840> all<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.320> regular<00:00:49.680> reload<00:00:50.010> that<00:00:50.280> you

and I'm just going to say that all the
regular<00:00:53.820> route<00:00:54.210> will<00:00:54.629> definitely<00:00:55.320> pay<00:00:55.559> for

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
regular route will definitely pay for

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.279 
regular route will definitely pay for
all<00:00:56.190> your<00:00:56.489> supplies<00:00:57.030> so<00:00:57.539> I<00:00:57.570> don't<00:00:57.930> have<00:00:58.109> to

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
all your supplies so I don't have to

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.590 
all your supplies so I don't have to
consider<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:58.949> supplies<00:00:59.340> in<00:00:59.550> this<00:00:59.670> video<00:01:00.000> so

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
consider the supplies in this video so

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.540 
consider the supplies in this video so
we<00:01:00.719> will<00:01:00.899> only<00:01:01.140> talk<00:01:01.500> about<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.859> spider-like

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
we will only talk about the spider-like

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.359 
we will only talk about the spider-like
price<00:01:03.149> and<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.750> drop<00:01:03.989> chance<00:01:04.320> and<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:05.129> kind

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
price and the drop chance and the kind

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.670 
price and the drop chance and the kind
of<00:01:05.610> money<00:01:05.880> per<00:01:06.060> our<00:01:06.210> ratio<00:01:06.840> that<00:01:07.140> you<00:01:07.260> can<00:01:07.439> get

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
of money per our ratio that you can get

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.859 
of money per our ratio that you can get
with<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.130> spider<00:01:08.430> leg<00:01:08.729> price<00:01:09.150> being<00:01:09.570> four

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
with the spider leg price being four

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.320 
with the spider leg price being four
hundred<00:01:10.229> million<00:01:10.650> so<00:01:11.010> after<00:01:11.640> doing<00:01:11.909> some

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
hundred million so after doing some

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.109 
hundred million so after doing some
searches<00:01:12.900> on<00:01:13.140> forums<00:01:13.680> and<00:01:13.979> talking<00:01:14.640> with<00:01:14.939> a

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
searches on forums and talking with a

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.210 
searches on forums and talking with a
lot<00:01:15.299> of<00:01:15.420> people<00:01:15.720> that<00:01:15.869> have<00:01:16.049> killed<00:01:16.320> Iraq<00:01:16.710> so<00:01:16.950> I

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
lot of people that have killed Iraq so I

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.730 
lot of people that have killed Iraq so I
haven't<00:01:17.759> really<00:01:18.180> seen<00:01:18.600> many<00:01:19.020> people<00:01:19.320> that

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
haven't really seen many people that

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.820 
haven't really seen many people that
have<00:01:19.979> killed<00:01:20.310> more<00:01:20.580> than<00:01:21.080> 150<00:01:22.080> iraq's<00:01:22.409> or<00:01:22.650> and

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
have killed more than 150 iraq's or and

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.490 
have killed more than 150 iraq's or and
they<00:01:23.220> don't<00:01:23.430> have<00:01:23.759> a<00:01:23.790> single<00:01:24.210> spider<00:01:24.750> leg<00:01:25.170> and

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
they don't have a single spider leg and

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.219 
they don't have a single spider leg and
also<00:01:26.460> a<00:01:26.759> lot<00:01:27.119> of<00:01:27.150> people<00:01:27.390> that<00:01:27.689> have<00:01:27.840> done<00:01:28.020> a

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
also a lot of people that have done a

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.679 
also a lot of people that have done a
lot<00:01:28.350> of<00:01:28.530> kills<00:01:28.829> and<00:01:29.100> just<00:01:29.700> compiled<00:01:30.180> a<00:01:30.360> lot<00:01:30.540> of

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
lot of kills and just compiled a lot of

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.260 
lot of kills and just compiled a lot of
data<00:01:31.020> have<00:01:31.799> come<00:01:32.070> up<00:01:32.250> with<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.640> number<00:01:33.060> that

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
data have come up with the number that

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.780 
data have come up with the number that
if<00:01:33.450> you<00:01:33.630> do<00:01:33.840> one<00:01:34.079> path<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:35.040> chance<00:01:35.340> of<00:01:35.579> getting

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
if you do one path the chance of getting

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.960 
if you do one path the chance of getting
one<00:01:36.240> spider<00:01:36.659> leg<00:01:37.020> is<00:01:37.229> roughly<00:01:37.619> 1<00:01:37.890> in<00:01:38.189> 50<00:01:38.759> I

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
one spider leg is roughly 1 in 50 I

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.120 
one spider leg is roughly 1 in 50 I
would<00:01:39.240> myself<00:01:39.479> be<00:01:40.020> ready<00:01:40.290> to<00:01:40.500> say<00:01:40.710> that<00:01:40.920> it's

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
would myself be ready to say that it's

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.370 
would myself be ready to say that it's
just<00:01:41.280> a<00:01:41.820> bit<00:01:42.000> more<00:01:42.240> common<00:01:42.659> than<00:01:42.840> that<00:01:43.110> so<00:01:43.320> I

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
just a bit more common than that so I

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.710 
just a bit more common than that so I
would<00:01:43.560> say<00:01:43.799> it's<00:01:43.979> maybe<00:01:44.189> 1<00:01:44.520> in<00:01:44.790> 35<00:01:45.390> or

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
would say it's maybe 1 in 35 or

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.289 
would say it's maybe 1 in 35 or
something<00:01:46.049> like<00:01:46.409> that<00:01:46.649> but<00:01:47.070> we<00:01:47.220> will<00:01:47.369> use<00:01:47.399> 1<00:01:48.000> in

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
something like that but we will use 1 in

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.660 
something like that but we will use 1 in
50<00:01:48.780> just<00:01:49.020> for<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:49.470> purposes<00:01:49.890> of<00:01:50.100> this<00:01:50.310> video

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
50 just for the purposes of this video

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.270 
50 just for the purposes of this video
and<00:01:50.939> just<00:01:51.450> for<00:01:51.720> proving<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:52.530> simple<00:01:53.009> fact

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
and just for proving the simple fact

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.700 
and just for proving the simple fact
that<00:01:53.520> our<00:01:53.820> axon<00:01:54.149> is<00:01:54.420> better<00:01:54.750> moneymaker<00:01:55.350> than

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
that our axon is better moneymaker than

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:56.810 
that our axon is better moneymaker than
killing<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.219> QPD

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
killing the QPD

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.090 
killing the QPD
I<00:01:57.030> obviously<00:01:57.659> do<00:01:58.020> know<00:01:58.290> that<00:01:58.530> killing<00:01:58.950> the

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
I obviously do know that killing the

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.789 
I obviously do know that killing the
cubed<00:01:59.460> e<00:01:59.579> is<00:01:59.820> more<00:02:00.210> consistent<00:02:00.659> money<00:02:01.259> but<00:02:01.770> I

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
cubed e is more consistent money but I

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.830 
cubed e is more consistent money but I
think<00:02:02.189> that<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:02.670> best<00:02:02.880> cubed<00:02:03.390> a<00:02:03.479> killers

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
think that the best cubed a killers

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.859 
think that the best cubed a killers
can't<00:02:04.229> exceed<00:02:04.799> 8<00:02:05.070> million<00:02:05.640> hours<00:02:06.030> so<00:02:06.299> I<00:02:06.570> think

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
can't exceed 8 million hours so I think

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.949 
can't exceed 8 million hours so I think
you<00:02:06.990> ve<00:02:07.140> averages<00:02:07.829> out<00:02:07.950> maybe<00:02:08.310> 5<00:02:09.149> to<00:02:09.450> 8<00:02:09.629> million

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
you ve averages out maybe 5 to 8 million

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.360 
you ve averages out maybe 5 to 8 million
hour<00:02:10.259> depending<00:02:11.039> on<00:02:11.250> how<00:02:11.550> fast<00:02:11.849> you<00:02:12.060> can

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
hour depending on how fast you can

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.180 
hour depending on how fast you can
kill<00:02:12.549> it<00:02:12.580> so<00:02:13.120> I<00:02:13.450> consider<00:02:13.840> myself<00:02:13.989> an<00:02:14.620> average

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
kill it so I consider myself an average

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.880 
kill it so I consider myself an average
Eric's<00:02:15.580> our<00:02:15.790> killer<00:02:16.090> and<00:02:16.360> on<00:02:16.840> every<00:02:17.500> single

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
Eric's our killer and on every single

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.550 
Eric's our killer and on every single
rotation<00:02:18.790> I<00:02:18.940> can<00:02:19.180> kill<00:02:19.390> at<00:02:19.569> least<00:02:19.780> for<00:02:20.319> a

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
rotation I can kill at least for a

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.649 
rotation I can kill at least for a
rock-type<00:02:20.799> per<00:02:21.370> hour<00:02:21.580> and<00:02:21.940> this<00:02:22.360> is<00:02:22.510> the

00:02:22.649 --> 00:02:22.659 
rock-type per hour and this is the

00:02:22.659 --> 00:02:24.420 
rock-type per hour and this is the
average<00:02:22.810> that<00:02:23.319> I'm<00:02:23.409> going<00:02:23.680> to<00:02:23.709> use<00:02:23.830> for<00:02:24.280> my

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
average that I'm going to use for my

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.690 
average that I'm going to use for my
calculations<00:02:25.209> so<00:02:25.840> if<00:02:26.409> the<00:02:26.739> drop<00:02:27.010> chance<00:02:27.340> of

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
calculations so if the drop chance of

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.930 
calculations so if the drop chance of
one<00:02:27.970> spider<00:02:28.390> leg<00:02:28.750> is<00:02:28.989> one<00:02:29.290> in<00:02:29.560> 50<00:02:30.220> you<00:02:30.760> should

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
one spider leg is one in 50 you should

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.449 
one spider leg is one in 50 you should
get<00:02:31.180> about<00:02:31.390> one<00:02:31.930> spider<00:02:32.379> leg<00:02:32.739> if<00:02:33.010> you<00:02:33.040> kill

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
get about one spider leg if you kill

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:36.990 
get about one spider leg if you kill
Eric<00:02:33.849> sir<00:02:34.260> 150<00:02:35.260> times<00:02:35.560> obviously<00:02:36.069> it's<00:02:36.760> not

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
Eric sir 150 times obviously it's not

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.869 
Eric sir 150 times obviously it's not
guaranteed<00:02:37.329> but<00:02:38.110> if<00:02:38.349> you<00:02:38.590> do<00:02:38.860> a<00:02:39.040> lot<00:02:39.459> of<00:02:39.489> Iraq

00:02:39.869 --> 00:02:39.879 
guaranteed but if you do a lot of Iraq

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:41.970 
guaranteed but if you do a lot of Iraq
sir<00:02:40.090> it<00:02:40.329> will<00:02:40.480> average<00:02:40.720> out<00:02:41.140> to<00:02:41.440> be<00:02:41.560> something

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
sir it will average out to be something

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:42.449 
sir it will average out to be something
like<00:02:42.129> that

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:42.459 
like that

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:46.259 
like that
so<00:02:42.940> on<00:02:43.239> average<00:02:43.599> every<00:02:44.430> 150<00:02:45.430> kills<00:02:45.670> you<00:02:45.970> gain

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:46.269 
so on average every 150 kills you gain

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:48.479 
so on average every 150 kills you gain
one<00:02:46.660> leg<00:02:47.049> and<00:02:47.260> this<00:02:47.709> means<00:02:48.010> that<00:02:48.250> it's<00:02:48.430> going

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:48.489 
one leg and this means that it's going

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:50.400 
one leg and this means that it's going
to<00:02:48.819> take<00:02:49.000> you<00:02:49.209> thirty<00:02:49.569> seven<00:02:50.109> and<00:02:50.230> a<00:02:50.379> half

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
to take you thirty seven and a half

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.280 
to take you thirty seven and a half
hours<00:02:50.890> to<00:02:51.310> get<00:02:51.430> one<00:02:51.760> leg<00:02:52.060> if<00:02:52.450> you<00:02:52.690> have<00:02:52.840> just<00:02:53.079> an

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
hours to get one leg if you have just an

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:55.140 
hours to get one leg if you have just an
average<00:02:53.739> Eric's<00:02:54.099> our<00:02:54.250> killer<00:02:54.489> and<00:02:54.790> you<00:02:54.970> can

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
average Eric's our killer and you can

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.599 
average Eric's our killer and you can
kill<00:02:55.390> for<00:02:55.599> iraq<00:02:56.019> site<00:02:56.260> per<00:02:56.410> hour<00:02:56.590> and<00:02:56.950> i<00:02:57.430> can

kill for iraq site per hour and i can

00:02:57.609 --> 00:03:00.240 
kill for iraq site per hour and i can

easily kill for dioxide per hour doesn't
matter<00:03:00.400> which<00:03:00.670> rotation<00:03:01.359> doesn't<00:03:01.989> matter<00:03:02.200> if

matter which rotation doesn't matter if

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:04.289 
matter which rotation doesn't matter if
it<00:03:02.530> takes<00:03:02.799> me<00:03:03.010> some<00:03:03.280> time<00:03:03.579> to<00:03:03.819> get<00:03:03.970> the<00:03:04.120> magic

00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:04.299 
it takes me some time to get the magic

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:06.630 
it takes me some time to get the magic
spawn<00:03:04.870> and<00:03:05.140> it<00:03:05.500> doesn't<00:03:05.890> matter<00:03:06.099> if<00:03:06.340> it<00:03:06.459> takes

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
spawn and it doesn't matter if it takes

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.610 
spawn and it doesn't matter if it takes
me<00:03:06.879> a<00:03:06.909> little<00:03:07.090> bit<00:03:07.299> of<00:03:07.420> time<00:03:07.599> to<00:03:07.750> bank<00:03:07.959> my<00:03:08.200> items

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
me a little bit of time to bank my items

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.789 
me a little bit of time to bank my items
i<00:03:08.799> always<00:03:09.760> kill<00:03:10.150> at<00:03:10.420> least<00:03:10.720> four<00:03:11.109> iraq<00:03:11.560> site

i always kill at least four iraq site

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:14.099 
i always kill at least four iraq site
per<00:03:12.040> hour<00:03:12.220> so<00:03:12.790> with<00:03:13.030> the<00:03:13.180> spider<00:03:13.480> flag<00:03:13.840> being

per hour so with the spider flag being

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:17.190 
per hour so with the spider flag being
400<00:03:15.099> million<00:03:15.579> and<00:03:15.760> it<00:03:15.940> taking<00:03:16.419> thirty<00:03:16.750> seven

and a half hours on average to get one

and a half hours on average to get one
spider<00:03:19.989> black<00:03:20.319> that<00:03:20.859> gives<00:03:21.190> you<00:03:21.489> an<00:03:21.730> average

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
spider black that gives you an average

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:25.170 
spider black that gives you an average
hourly<00:03:22.660> ratio<00:03:23.319> of<00:03:23.560> ten<00:03:23.919> point<00:03:24.280> seven<00:03:24.669> million

for<00:03:25.660> only<00:03:26.290> the<00:03:26.560> spider<00:03:26.889> leg<00:03:27.370> and<00:03:27.730> that's<00:03:28.239> only

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
for only the spider leg and that's only

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:31.619 
for only the spider leg and that's only
for<00:03:28.900> the<00:03:29.079> leg<00:03:29.290> so<00:03:29.889> if<00:03:30.310> you<00:03:30.549> get<00:03:30.760> some<00:03:31.060> onix's

00:03:31.619 --> 00:03:31.629 
for the leg so if you get some onix's

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:33.990 
for the leg so if you get some onix's
you<00:03:31.810> get<00:03:31.989> some<00:03:32.169> onyx<00:03:32.590> bolts<00:03:33.220> you<00:03:33.609> will<00:03:33.790> get

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
you get some onyx bolts you will get

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.240 
you get some onyx bolts you will get
more<00:03:34.269> money<00:03:34.690> than<00:03:35.019> ten<00:03:35.260> point<00:03:35.590> seven<00:03:36.010> million

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
more money than ten point seven million

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.729 
more money than ten point seven million
an<00:03:36.549> hour<00:03:36.849> on<00:03:37.209> average<00:03:37.840> if<00:03:38.019> you<00:03:38.079> kill<00:03:38.379> a<00:03:38.560> lot<00:03:38.590> of

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:38.739 
an hour on average if you kill a lot of

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:41.550 
an hour on average if you kill a lot of
iraq<00:03:39.190> so<00:03:39.430> and<00:03:39.639> this<00:03:39.940> hourly<00:03:40.510> ratio<00:03:40.959> you<00:03:41.230> get<00:03:41.349> if

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
iraq so and this hourly ratio you get if

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.369 
iraq so and this hourly ratio you get if
you<00:03:41.709> estimate<00:03:42.250> the<00:03:42.730> iraq<00:03:43.090> sir<00:03:43.359> spider<00:03:43.750> leg<00:03:44.109> to

00:03:44.369 --> 00:03:44.379 
you estimate the iraq sir spider leg to

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:47.490 
you estimate the iraq sir spider leg to
be<00:03:44.530> one<00:03:44.769> in<00:03:45.040> fifty<00:03:45.760> each<00:03:46.000> kill<00:03:46.480> and<00:03:46.690> i<00:03:47.139> think

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
be one in fifty each kill and i think

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.680 
be one in fifty each kill and i think
it's<00:03:47.709> a<00:03:47.829> bit<00:03:47.980> more<00:03:48.280> common<00:03:48.790> than<00:03:49.000> that

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
it's a bit more common than that

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:51.960 
it's a bit more common than that
my<00:03:49.840> personal<00:03:50.440> ratio<00:03:50.949> for<00:03:51.220> iraq<00:03:51.489> sir<00:03:51.669> if<00:03:51.849> you

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:51.970 
my personal ratio for iraq sir if you

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.000 
my personal ratio for iraq sir if you
don't<00:03:52.180> consider<00:03:52.690> any<00:03:53.019> of<00:03:53.199> the<00:03:53.379> regular<00:03:53.709> loot

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
don't consider any of the regular loot

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:56.640 
don't consider any of the regular loot
and<00:03:54.280> you<00:03:54.549> consider<00:03:55.000> that<00:03:55.480> the<00:03:56.019> regular<00:03:56.379> loot

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650 
and you consider that the regular loot

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:59.159 
and you consider that the regular loot
only<00:03:57.040> pays<00:03:57.310> for<00:03:57.639> my<00:03:57.819> supplies<00:03:58.269> it's<00:03:58.540> actually

00:03:59.159 --> 00:03:59.169 
only pays for my supplies it's actually

00:03:59.169 --> 00:04:01.710 
only pays for my supplies it's actually
much<00:03:59.410> higher<00:03:59.799> than<00:04:00.310> ten<00:04:00.819> point<00:04:01.120> seven<00:04:01.359> million

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:01.720 
much higher than ten point seven million

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:05.970 
much higher than ten point seven million
our<00:04:02.019> so<00:04:02.500> myself<00:04:02.739> i<00:04:03.160> have<00:04:03.489> killed<00:04:04.319> 166<00:04:05.319> iraq

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:05.980 
our so myself i have killed 166 iraq

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:08.610 
our so myself i have killed 166 iraq
sigh<00:04:06.250> and<00:04:06.489> that's<00:04:07.090> forty<00:04:07.690> one<00:04:07.870> point<00:04:08.290> five

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
sigh and that's forty one point five

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:10.650 
sigh and that's forty one point five
hours<00:04:09.160> if<00:04:09.340> you<00:04:09.459> consider<00:04:09.879> that<00:04:10.090> i<00:04:10.209> can<00:04:10.419> kill

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:10.660 
hours if you consider that i can kill

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:12.150 
hours if you consider that i can kill
for<00:04:10.900> Iraq<00:04:11.319> side<00:04:11.560> per<00:04:11.739> hour

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:12.160 
for Iraq side per hour

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.520 
for Iraq side per hour
doesn't<00:04:12.849> matter<00:04:13.000> which<00:04:13.389> rotation<00:04:14.319> and

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:14.530 
doesn't matter which rotation and

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:16.650 
doesn't matter which rotation and
definitely<00:04:15.310> it<00:04:15.699> averages<00:04:16.060> out<00:04:16.329> to<00:04:16.389> be<00:04:16.570> about

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:16.660 
definitely it averages out to be about

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:19.199 
definitely it averages out to be about
four<00:04:17.199> because<00:04:17.620> in<00:04:17.829> with<00:04:18.070> the<00:04:18.220> easy<00:04:18.430> rotation<00:04:18.789> I

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:19.209 
four because in with the easy rotation I

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:21.899 
four because in with the easy rotation I
can<00:04:19.389> kill<00:04:19.599> like<00:04:19.750> five<00:04:20.049> or<00:04:20.289> six<00:04:20.320> per<00:04:20.890> hour<00:04:21.039> so<00:04:21.609> in

00:04:21.899 --> 00:04:21.909 
can kill like five or six per hour so in

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:25.000 
can kill like five or six per hour so in
those<00:04:22.120> forty<00:04:22.659> 1.5<00:04:23.590> hours<00:04:24.099> I<00:04:24.280> have<00:04:24.520> gained

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.010 
those forty 1.5 hours I have gained

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:27.190 
those forty 1.5 hours I have gained
one<00:04:25.160> fools<00:04:25.490> pirate<00:04:26.030> leg<00:04:26.180> and<00:04:26.420> one<00:04:26.840> full

one fools pirate leg and one full

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:30.130 
one fools pirate leg and one full
noxious<00:04:27.830> staff<00:04:28.310> and<00:04:28.640> that<00:04:29.060> average<00:04:29.300> is<00:04:29.810> my

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:30.140 
noxious staff and that average is my

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:32.860 
noxious staff and that average is my
money<00:04:30.500> per<00:04:30.680> hour<00:04:30.830> to<00:04:31.070> be<00:04:31.190> 18<00:04:31.790> million<00:04:32.210> per<00:04:32.720> hour

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:32.870

just from the leg and staff and further
if<00:04:36.350> you<00:04:36.500> consider<00:04:36.890> that<00:04:36.980> I'm<00:04:37.310> using<00:04:37.580> a<00:04:37.790> welfare

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:38.030 
if you consider that I'm using a welfare

if you consider that I'm using a welfare
gear<00:04:38.570> for<00:04:38.840> Iraq<00:04:39.110> sir<00:04:39.260> I'm<00:04:39.440> using<00:04:39.680> only

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:39.920 
gear for Iraq sir I'm using only

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:40.690 
gear for Iraq sir I'm using only
armadillo

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:40.700 
armadillo

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:43.510 
armadillo
armor<00:04:41.090> and<00:04:41.330> I<00:04:41.600> don't<00:04:41.660> use<00:04:42.320> ceramic<00:04:42.830> armor<00:04:43.010> so<00:04:43.490> I

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:43.520 
armor and I don't use ceramic armor so I

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:46.150 
armor and I don't use ceramic armor so I
don't<00:04:43.760> have<00:04:43.940> the<00:04:44.120> expensive<00:04:44.720> repairs<00:04:45.290> I<00:04:45.620> think

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:46.160 
don't have the expensive repairs I think

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.520 
don't have the expensive repairs I think
that<00:04:46.370> I<00:04:46.550> make<00:04:46.880> more<00:04:47.150> profit<00:04:47.660> from<00:04:47.840> the<00:04:48.140> regular

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:48.530 
that I make more profit from the regular

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:51.730 
that I make more profit from the regular
load<00:04:48.770> as<00:04:48.980> well<00:04:49.250> so<00:04:49.910> my<00:04:50.360> ratio<00:04:50.990> for<00:04:51.260> Iraq<00:04:51.530> sir

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:51.740 
load as well so my ratio for Iraq sir

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:54.540 
load as well so my ratio for Iraq sir
has<00:04:52.100> been<00:04:52.400> closer<00:04:52.790> to<00:04:53.000> 20<00:04:53.660> million<00:04:54.080> an<00:04:54.320> hour

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:54.550 
has been closer to 20 million an hour

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:58.210 
has been closer to 20 million an hour
just<00:04:55.550> on<00:04:55.790> average<00:04:56.210> and<00:04:56.990> that's<00:04:57.290> really<00:04:57.740> great

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:58.220 
just on average and that's really great

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:00.700 
just on average and that's really great
ratio<00:04:58.910> for<00:04:59.210> money<00:04:59.450> making<00:04:59.870> and<00:05:00.020> that<00:05:00.500> is

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:00.710 
ratio for money making and that is

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:02.770 
ratio for money making and that is
definitely<00:05:00.980> much<00:05:01.640> higher<00:05:01.970> than<00:05:02.330> I<00:05:02.420> would<00:05:02.450> get

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:02.780 
definitely much higher than I would get

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:05.590 
definitely much higher than I would get
if<00:05:02.960> I<00:05:03.110> spent<00:05:03.410> all<00:05:03.650> the<00:05:03.830> time<00:05:04.040> at<00:05:04.310> qbt<00:05:04.850> now

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:05.600 
if I spent all the time at qbt now

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:07.780 
if I spent all the time at qbt now
obviously<00:05:06.260> I<00:05:06.380> know<00:05:06.560> that<00:05:07.010> it<00:05:07.130> takes<00:05:07.400> a<00:05:07.640> little

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:07.790 
obviously I know that it takes a little

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:10.270 
obviously I know that it takes a little
bit<00:05:08.000> of<00:05:08.270> time<00:05:08.570> to<00:05:08.870> get<00:05:09.020> the<00:05:09.260> grasp<00:05:09.560> of<00:05:09.770> Iraq<00:05:10.130> sir

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:10.280 
bit of time to get the grasp of Iraq sir

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:12.280 
bit of time to get the grasp of Iraq sir
and<00:05:10.490> it<00:05:10.580> takes<00:05:10.820> some<00:05:11.120> time<00:05:11.150> until<00:05:11.750> you<00:05:12.110> can

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:12.290 
and it takes some time until you can

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:14.290 
and it takes some time until you can
learn<00:05:12.440> to<00:05:12.680> kill<00:05:12.950> Iraq<00:05:13.190> so<00:05:13.370> four<00:05:13.640> kills<00:05:13.970> an<00:05:14.180> hour

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:14.300 
learn to kill Iraq so four kills an hour

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:16.840 
learn to kill Iraq so four kills an hour
but<00:05:14.930> four<00:05:15.230> kills<00:05:15.530> an<00:05:15.800> hour<00:05:15.980> is<00:05:16.310> not<00:05:16.610> an

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:16.850 
but four kills an hour is not an

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:19.270 
but four kills an hour is not an
outrageous<00:05:17.510> speed<00:05:18.200> there<00:05:18.650> are<00:05:18.770> people<00:05:19.160> that

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:19.280 
outrageous speed there are people that

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:21.640 
outrageous speed there are people that
can<00:05:19.490> kill<00:05:19.730> probably<00:05:20.270> six<00:05:20.600> or<00:05:20.840> seven<00:05:21.440> with

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:21.650 
can kill probably six or seven with

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:23.530 
can kill probably six or seven with
maximum<00:05:22.220> enrage<00:05:22.670> of<00:05:22.910> something<00:05:23.330> like<00:05:23.480> that

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:23.540 
maximum enrage of something like that

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:25.990 
maximum enrage of something like that
and<00:05:24.110> I<00:05:24.290> only<00:05:24.500> kill<00:05:24.800> the<00:05:24.920> easiest<00:05:25.340> spawns<00:05:25.730> and

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:26.000 
and I only kill the easiest spawns and

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.700 
and I only kill the easiest spawns and
I'm<00:05:26.090> getting<00:05:26.390> four<00:05:26.660> to<00:05:26.840> five<00:05:27.050> sometimes<00:05:27.410> six

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:27.710 
I'm getting four to five sometimes six

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:29.770 
I'm getting four to five sometimes six
kills<00:05:28.220> an<00:05:28.400> hour<00:05:28.550> so<00:05:29.000> it's<00:05:29.180> definitely

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:29.780 
kills an hour so it's definitely

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:33.130 
kills an hour so it's definitely
reachable<00:05:30.590> kill<00:05:30.950> ratio<00:05:31.670> and<00:05:32.120> it<00:05:32.330> proves<00:05:32.720> that

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:33.140 
reachable kill ratio and it proves that

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:35.920 
reachable kill ratio and it proves that
if<00:05:33.410> you<00:05:33.440> can<00:05:33.740> get<00:05:33.920> this<00:05:34.250> ratio<00:05:34.580> it's<00:05:35.240> not<00:05:35.600> worth

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:35.930 
if you can get this ratio it's not worth

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:38.500 
if you can get this ratio it's not worth
it<00:05:36.140> to<00:05:36.440> kill<00:05:36.650> the<00:05:36.830> qbd<00:05:37.340> it's<00:05:37.670> better<00:05:38.000> to<00:05:38.330> kill

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:38.510 
it to kill the qbd it's better to kill

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:42.340 
it to kill the qbd it's better to kill
Iraq<00:05:38.960> sir<00:05:39.260> and<00:05:39.760> over<00:05:40.760> time<00:05:41.120> your<00:05:41.510> hourly<00:05:41.930> money

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:44.890 
Iraq sir and over time your hourly money
ratio<00:05:42.920> will<00:05:43.160> average<00:05:43.640> out<00:05:43.880> to<00:05:43.940> be<00:05:44.360> much<00:05:44.600> higher

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:44.900 
ratio will average out to be much higher

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:47.290 
ratio will average out to be much higher
at<00:05:45.260> Iraq<00:05:45.590> sir<00:05:45.800> then<00:05:46.070> it's<00:05:46.220> going<00:05:46.490> to<00:05:46.580> be<00:05:46.850> at<00:05:47.090> the

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:47.300 
at Iraq sir then it's going to be at the

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:49.720 
at Iraq sir then it's going to be at the
qvd<00:05:47.900> but<00:05:48.470> I<00:05:48.500> think<00:05:48.770> this<00:05:48.980> is<00:05:49.160> it<00:05:49.310> for<00:05:49.340> this

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:49.730 
qvd but I think this is it for this

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:52.120 
qvd but I think this is it for this
video<00:05:49.940> so<00:05:50.390> it<00:05:50.570> was<00:05:50.720> just<00:05:50.930> my<00:05:51.170> quick<00:05:51.470> notion

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:52.130 
video so it was just my quick notion

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:54.040 
video so it was just my quick notion
about<00:05:52.280> Iraq<00:05:52.790> sir<00:05:52.940> because<00:05:53.180> a<00:05:53.330> lot<00:05:53.510> of<00:05:53.540> people

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:54.050 
about Iraq sir because a lot of people

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:56.860 
about Iraq sir because a lot of people
seem<00:05:54.410> to<00:05:54.440> not<00:05:54.950> know<00:05:55.490> that<00:05:55.760> Iraq<00:05:56.090> sir<00:05:56.270> is<00:05:56.420> really

00:05:59.370 --> 00:05:59.380 
good money per hour and they seem to

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:01.990 
good money per hour and they seem to
severely<00:06:00.380> underestimate<00:06:01.370> the<00:06:01.670> money<00:06:01.850> per

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:02.000
