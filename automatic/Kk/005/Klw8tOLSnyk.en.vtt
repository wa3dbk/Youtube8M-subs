00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:39.750

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.460
 pokemon this is rare highlighting the 3g 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.230
 already captured to see if really 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.200
 it was that I always in 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:53.550
 advance so here is so just have 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:56.489
 in fact baho and the influx t one to have had 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.109
 the 8 beats so have created the bonus to 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.250
 resurgences we can do it after the 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.390
 league we can do it before live on 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.410
 can do it after the second league 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.989
 after the 3rd etc 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.450
 after after the delta episode before 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:11.850
 the delta episode and so here and then 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:15.720
 I have to go very simple I'll go 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:19.590
 show right away I believe that the 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.820
 to miss is clever it's better in the 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.840
 night we see we see small dots 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:26.369
 red no see them you see all 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.049
 the little red dots and the led cv 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.630
 the mirages 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:34.530
 wait I think I pass on it 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:36.630
 is close by which is close to the 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.040
 here it is on the impenetrable forest 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:42.020
 so until you find the forest 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.020
 impenetrable who is here so to show himself 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:50.990
 interested you will arrive here 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:57.950
 and that will tell you a burning energy and 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.570
 impetuous finally it depends the cmp have 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.640
 filled or other cases finally you you 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:05.300
 Feel observed stuff like that just 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:11.320
 save a place with elton so 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:14.240
 iten it is there it is it is 6:36 pm 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:17.450
 so the afternoon I think it's 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:23.530
 in ten in the evening it's raikou and the morning 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:23.530
 it's succulent that's so illegal 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.270
 so here's a little bit different 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.980
 simple you will see how I 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:35.750
 capture the pokemon so very simple of the 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.730
 Games weakens with my agent I 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.110
 do double slap game mega wanted if 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.420
 it is necessary in general I do not like 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.770
 too much to do next there are a lot of 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.150
 pokemon who are not sensitive to 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:46.100
 plant type attacks which samuel you 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.840
 at mega his team goes to tapie y 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:50.870
 to lose since we are planting there only 40 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:54.080
 on the special this is hockey or if he wants 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.370
 still he has the aspirates there I do not think 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.930
 that I'm going to weaken him again repent 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:00.170
 is that hurt me so the 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.610
 true I sacrifice young world that he has 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:08.300
 not been sacrificed I'm doing a 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:13.060
 little bit worse I do not have to 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:17.060
 kill i think he's dead yeah good 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:20.890

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:24.440
 changeux would capture later that's it 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:27.380

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:30.220
