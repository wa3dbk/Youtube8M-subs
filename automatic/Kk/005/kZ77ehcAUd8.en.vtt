00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:47.140 
hopefully a little bit different and

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:48.660 
hopefully a little bit different and
we're<00:00:47.260> looking<00:00:47.530> forward<00:00:47.800> to<00:00:48.010> trying<00:00:48.340> to<00:00:48.520> get

would get some silverware at last not

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:53.760

say<00:00:52.539> it's<00:00:52.660> gonna<00:00:52.750> be<00:00:52.870> that<00:00:52.989> easy<00:00:53.050> but<00:00:53.559> we'll

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:53.770 
say it's gonna be that easy but we'll

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:56.340 
say it's gonna be that easy but we'll
ever<00:00:53.980> do<00:00:54.160> yeah<00:00:54.789> we've<00:00:55.030> probably<00:00:55.629> lost<00:00:55.780> maybe

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:56.350 
ever do yeah we've probably lost maybe

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:58.560 
ever do yeah we've probably lost maybe
three<00:00:57.100> or<00:00:57.160> four<00:00:57.399> experienced<00:00:58.239> players<00:00:58.480> i

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:58.570 
three or four experienced players i

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:01.110 
three or four experienced players i
think<00:00:58.899> we've<00:00:59.020> probably<00:00:59.980> brought<00:01:00.309> brought<00:01:00.940> in

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:01.120

maybe<00:01:01.329> five<00:01:01.570> or<00:01:01.600> six<00:01:01.899> lives<00:01:02.079> who<00:01:02.260> fill<00:01:02.949> those

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:03.430 
maybe five or six lives who fill those

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:04.560 
maybe five or six lives who fill those
roles<00:01:03.550> i'm<00:01:03.879> probably<00:01:04.059> give<00:01:04.269> us<00:01:04.360> a<00:01:04.390> bit<00:01:04.510> more

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:04.570 
roles i'm probably give us a bit more

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:08.220 
roles i'm probably give us a bit more
depth<00:01:04.900> as<00:01:05.080> well<00:01:05.260> so<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:07.000> shape<00:01:07.750> of<00:01:07.930> the<00:01:07.960> squad

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:08.230 
depth as well so the shape of the squad

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:09.720 
depth as well so the shape of the squad
is<00:01:08.260> very<00:01:08.710> different<00:01:08.950> from<00:01:09.130> us<00:01:09.310> here<00:01:09.490> with<00:01:09.640> the

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:09.730 
is very different from us here with the

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:11.940 
is very different from us here with the
personnel<00:01:10.120> wise<00:01:10.360> but<00:01:10.600> there's<00:01:11.560> a<00:01:11.620> good<00:01:11.740> feel

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:11.950 
personnel wise but there's a good feel

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.820 
personnel wise but there's a good feel
to<00:01:11.980> it<00:01:12.160> I<00:01:12.370> think<00:01:12.580> we've<00:01:13.060> got<00:01:13.210> chance<00:01:13.420> to<00:01:13.830> play

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:14.830

to it I think we've got chance to play
in<00:01:14.890> a<00:01:14.920> couple<00:01:15.160> of<00:01:15.190> friendlies<00:01:15.550> and<00:01:15.670> the<00:01:16.570> way

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:16.720

in a couple of friendlies and the way
the<00:01:17.020> way<00:01:17.140> with<00:01:17.290> blood<00:01:17.470> has<00:01:17.590> been<00:01:17.620> pretty

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:17.890 
the way with blood has been pretty

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:19.980 
the way with blood has been pretty
pretty<00:01:18.190> well<00:01:18.390> I've<00:01:19.390> been<00:01:19.420> around<00:01:19.750> long<00:01:19.870> enough

now to realize no matter what you do is

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.350 
now to realize no matter what you do is
always<00:01:23.230> an<00:01:23.380> expectation<00:01:23.830> and<00:01:24.640> to<00:01:24.940> whether<00:01:25.240> it

it's<00:03:46.580> going<00:03:46.700> to<00:03:46.760> be<00:03:46.849> hard<00:03:47.000> obviously<00:03:47.810> we're<00:03:47.959> up

00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:48.019 
it's going to be hard obviously we're up

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:49.539 
it's going to be hard obviously we're up
for<00:03:48.170> it<00:03:48.230> and<00:03:48.470> obviously<00:03:48.650> we<00:03:48.980> can<00:03:49.099> achieve<00:03:49.190> it

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:49.549 
for it and obviously we can achieve it

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:50.440 
for it and obviously we can achieve it
but<00:03:49.640> it's<00:03:49.760> going<00:03:49.849> to<00:03:49.910> be<00:03:50.000> tough<00:03:50.090> their<00:03:50.269> things

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.450 
but it's going to be tough their things

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:51.789 
but it's going to be tough their things
and<00:03:50.510> we<00:03:50.630> tougher<00:03:50.900> than<00:03:50.989> last<00:03:51.170> year<00:03:51.319> we

00:03:51.789 --> 00:03:51.799 
and we tougher than last year we

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:55.089 
and we tougher than last year we
improved<00:03:52.299> massively<00:03:53.299> last<00:03:53.810> year<00:03:53.989> and<00:03:54.170> the

00:03:55.089 --> 00:03:55.099 
improved massively last year and the

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:57.130 
improved massively last year and the
previous<00:03:55.370> year<00:03:55.819> you<00:03:55.970> know<00:03:56.000> the<00:03:56.299> statistics

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:57.140 
previous year you know the statistics

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:59.680 
previous year you know the statistics
with<00:03:57.739> 25<00:03:58.250> three<00:03:58.549> percent<00:03:58.880> up<00:03:59.000> in<00:03:59.150> both<00:03:59.329> attack

00:03:59.680 --> 00:03:59.690 
with 25 three percent up in both attack

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:01.509 
with 25 three percent up in both attack
and<00:03:59.870> defense<00:04:00.140> and<00:04:00.319> if<00:04:00.829> we<00:04:01.010> can<00:04:01.160> do<00:04:01.250> that<00:04:01.280> again

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:01.519 
and defense and if we can do that again

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:05.830 
and defense and if we can do that again
in<00:04:02.390> 2014<00:04:03.200> and<00:04:03.620> then<00:04:03.890> I<00:04:04.630> think<00:04:05.630> the<00:04:05.690> league

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 
in 2014 and then I think the league

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:07.990 
in 2014 and then I think the league
personal<00:04:06.349> take<00:04:06.560> care<00:04:06.769> of<00:04:06.890> itself<00:04:07.040> and<00:04:07.519> you

you know we've got a lot of hard work to
do<00:04:19.940> if<00:04:20.060> we<00:04:20.150> want<00:04:20.299> to<00:04:20.329> achieve<00:04:20.450> what<00:04:21.289> we<00:04:21.320> want<00:04:21.410> to

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:21.620 
do if we want to achieve what we want to

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:23.379 
do if we want to achieve what we want to
achieve<00:04:21.739> we<00:04:22.400> just<00:04:22.580> go<00:04:22.669> into<00:04:22.880> the<00:04:23.000> into<00:04:23.300> the

00:04:23.379 --> 00:04:23.389 
achieve we just go into the into the

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:25.240 
achieve we just go into the into the
season<00:04:23.600> with<00:04:23.780> positive<00:04:24.139> minds<00:04:24.530> and<00:04:24.650> it's

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:25.250 
season with positive minds and it's

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:27.250 
season with positive minds and it's
hopefully<00:04:25.729> we<00:04:25.850> can<00:04:26.000> challenge<00:04:26.210> and<00:04:26.630> that's

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:27.260 
hopefully we can challenge and that's

hopefully we can challenge and that's
all<00:04:27.380> I<00:04:27.410> think<00:04:27.979> that's<00:04:28.100> what<00:04:28.220> we<00:04:28.280> want<00:04:28.430> to<00:04:28.490> do

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:28.550 
all I think that's what we want to do

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:30.340 
all I think that's what we want to do
want<00:04:28.760> a<00:04:28.820> challenge<00:04:29.150> and<00:04:29.300> not<00:04:29.840> not<00:04:30.169> give

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:30.350 
want a challenge and not not give

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:32.950 
want a challenge and not not give
everyone<00:04:30.620> likes<00:04:31.550> what<00:04:31.820> they<00:04:31.940> expecting<00:04:32.450> it<00:04:32.840> to

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:32.960 
everyone likes what they expecting it to

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.890 
everyone likes what they expecting it to
be<00:04:32.990> a<00:04:33.139> walking<00:04:33.380> so<00:04:34.130> I<00:04:34.160> think<00:04:34.310> just<00:04:35.300> from<00:04:35.750> a

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:35.900 
be a walking so I think just from a

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:46.409 
be a walking so I think just from a
kickoff<00:04:36.200> it's<00:04:36.590> just<00:04:36.800> challenge<00:04:37.310> everything

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:46.419 

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:50.140 

think<00:04:47.419> that<00:04:47.629> you<00:04:48.349> know<00:04:48.469> it<00:04:48.830> is<00:04:49.009> a<00:04:49.039> big<00:04:49.340> big<00:04:49.909> c

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:50.150 
think that you know it is a big big c

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:52.719 
think that you know it is a big big c
big<00:04:50.749> season<00:04:50.990> for<00:04:51.319> cass<00:04:51.560> and<00:04:51.919> you<00:04:52.370> know<00:04:52.490> there's

00:04:52.719 --> 00:04:52.729 
big season for cass and you know there's

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:54.399 
big season for cass and you know there's
a<00:04:52.789> lot<00:04:52.909> of<00:04:52.939> pressure<00:04:53.270> on<00:04:53.419> us<00:04:53.539> but<00:04:53.810> i<00:04:54.020> think<00:04:54.319> we

00:04:54.399 --> 00:04:54.409 
a lot of pressure on us but i think we

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:55.749 
a lot of pressure on us but i think we
just<00:04:54.529> got<00:04:54.710> to<00:04:54.800> worry<00:04:54.949> about<00:04:55.009> ourselves<00:04:55.340> this

00:04:55.749 --> 00:04:55.759

statement straight from the start and

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:03.189 
statement straight from the start and
really<00:05:01.550> stand<00:05:01.909> back<00:05:02.090> around<00:05:02.419> where<00:05:02.659> we'll<00:05:03.169> be
