00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.890
 while christmas this morning of a category 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.689
 car as unpopular among 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.059
 students or those who are starting to have 

00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:10.919
 a job the tic commander lives like one 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.169
 says perform search for a new car 

00:00:10.919 --> 00:00:14.700
 reliable a sub compact but often one 

00:00:13.169 --> 00:00:16.139
 falls into this category there because 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.670
 precisely this economic at the 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.710
 economical sock also 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.599
 insurance side or so what we 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.490
 look when we are a student or 7 

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:25.470
 economic point of view frugality summer 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.980
 fuel consumption so that becomes 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.560
 interesting 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:32.009
 we want us this is the team to 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.440
 students and this one is interesting 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.880
 for that and we also want in ch and 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.440
 parents have something to 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.120
 safe something that will us 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.740
 really make point a to point b 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.480
 so I considered all that today 

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:43.890
 what we are seeing in this 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.660
 moment fears and mitsubishi 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.940
 mirage mitsubishi is a young 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.500
 company here in canada that we 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.020
 arrive with their fifth model and 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.310
 6.6 this subcompact the so happen 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.440
 in height since a few weeks 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:57.330
 barely sold for some time and 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.860
 so we do not expect to 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:00.840
 great prowess on the part of this 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:02.760
 vehicle of a basic vehicle that we 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.530
 makes just point a to point b 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.890
 and when we talk about a vehicle of 14 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.060
 one thousand dollars all expenses included the 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:11.640
 transport in preparation and ecce terra 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.700
 intimate talent in a point of Lille 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.990
 ok we talk about 74 horses under the hood 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.880
 it's for extremely powerful but in 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.229
 same time we were looking for that side 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.149
 fuel economy the who is 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.369
 interesting so we talk about 4 points 9 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:26.189
 liters per 100 km with a transmission 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:28.859
 continuously variable or around 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.719
 5.3 5.5 liters 100 km with a 

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:32.340
 manual transmission quebec help 

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:33.509
 nice to drive yes it's 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.340
 interesting it does not necessarily take 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.829
 in the wind even if they have a small 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.170
 morning we are able to snap then 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.329
 to go there so it's a beautiful 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.469
 alternative was shooting at a car when 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.359
 we consider the chain a car 

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:46.200
 used for example either look on 

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:48.659
 a second hand car 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.369
 yeah but here too we pay 14 min we do not 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.259
 it also guarantees one of the best 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:55.499
 around the world at mitsubishi so we 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:58.229
 speak five years 160 thousand km on the 

00:01:55.499 --> 00:01:59.429
 powerplant during Paris 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.770
 pass and there are some like no 

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:03.420
 of concern however still have 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.920
 remains to see the reliability of this vehicle 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.969
 low who just arrived here in quebec 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.310
 in our conditions 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:10.860
 it remains to see a second car 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.340
 interesting and drama to reduce has missed 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.260
 the little virtue is there 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.519
 young people and complicates when we 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.310
 look ahead like that 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:20.170
 his look is really so these sports a 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.010
 little is really it's the fiesta the 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.530
 ford fiesta 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.810
 she was redesigned I would not understand 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.040
 but the grille is recognized by faure 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.290
 the new grille 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.700
 there are some sizes that sport 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.459
 this new shefford grille 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.810
 this year so an interesting look a 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:37.030
 driving that is really interesting 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:38.709
 because at this power on the hood 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.260
 to say when it comes time to 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:42.640
 start one is able to realize the 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.930
 couple is interesting by cons in 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.310
 too much recovery maybe a little bit more 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.930
 plan your child when you want 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:50.200
 overtaking 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:54.069
 the last one super well equipped forgiveness 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:55.780
 yes I am then totally naked no 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:57.549
 but with my what's going on with the 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.170
 particular products we are offered a 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:00.489
 quality product at the base but we 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.049
 can add so much to 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:03.640
 options so that one has produced to 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:04.900
 the $ 6,000 bar that can go 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.790
 up to 25000 dollars 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.290
 so that would be for example for the 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:10.930
 doorman statistics and the new 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.849
 sport model with 200 horses under the 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.799
 hood but still produced 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:17.170
 interesting I understand I love her 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:19.060
 profile look the model yes and it's this 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:20.680
 what did the league say really man this 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.329
 model there ea and at 22 thousand dollars 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.950
 because we have the titanium model with 

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:27.090
 we there is rearview camera inside 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:27.090
 leather upholstery 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:32.470
 if we made a top five rockets in 

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:34.720
 five there for the target customer the 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:37.450
 students who want a new car 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:39.069
 yes yes I am a new car 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.410
 compact so in fifth position 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:43.180
 let's go with the mass which two which is 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:43.810
 a classic that is a car that is 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:46.120
 reliable 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:47.560
 we see it right now and who more 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:49.599
 in fact the fiesta I just 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.790
 you actually present it's pretty much 

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:52.959
 the same platform 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:55.060
 on the other hand, it is a bit more expensive than 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:57.669
 the fiesta to see if that's it 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:59.200
 fits in fourth position one to the 

00:03:57.669 --> 00:04:00.970
 ford fiesta that I just presented 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.440
 who is a model that global who has 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:03.849
 proven to be interesting 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.470
 also and which comes in several 

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:06.329
 colors that comes in several 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:10.239
 colors 

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:11.139
 so it's around $ 6,000 it starts 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:13.959
 the Ford Fiesta 

00:04:11.139 --> 00:04:15.819
 in third position on the hyundai 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:16.870
 accent is the model that is very well known 

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:19.150
 here in quebec 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:20.709
 rated very popular is a classic 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:22.840
 but who is good 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:24.940
 and in fact that in time had a 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:26.710
 very bad notoriety because 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:27.880
 it was not reliable we forget that meaning 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:29.169
 because the hyundai accent is 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:31.060
 really a product she was 

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:33.460
 now and in second position the 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:35.650
 kia rio helix the people go often 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:36.940
 to wonder - but what is this 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:39.069
 which appears to be what is different 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:41.530
 these two models has it so what 

00:04:39.069 --> 00:04:43.990
 appears it is a 138 horsepower engine 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:46.479
 we are talking about a 1.6 liter engine 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:48.009
 and and this is the only engine located for 

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:49.810
 both models leaves most 

00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:52.539
 powerful finally of this category 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:53.620
 so it's ultra interesting and frugal 

00:04:52.539 --> 00:04:55.389
 at the same time that they consume 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:58.030
 relatively not a lot of fuel 

00:04:55.389 --> 00:05:00.190
 so and abs brakes also at the four 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:02.020
 wheels grew up in our just to two 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:03.729
 wheels on his flights on these cars there 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:05.110
 There are six mode airbags 

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:06.970
 six-speed manual 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:08.800
 so a lot of assets for the price 

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:10.479
 it's interesting that in both 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.039
 models eco lille france what would it be 

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:13.690
 in the differences well it's happening at 

00:05:12.039 --> 00:05:16.659
 level of driving for having tried 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:18.669
 the kia rio without the road of 

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:20.590
 really the direction suspensions side 

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:22.569
 electronic so that all that 

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:24.009
 maybe a little more nervous we talk 

00:05:22.569 --> 00:05:25.900
 from the same engine the slam a power 

00:05:24.009 --> 00:05:27.720
 so a little more nervousness on the part 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:29.650
 kia a little more sensations 

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:31.479
 the interior cabin on the inside 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:32.710
 chinian more a more ground 

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:35.349
 interesting maybe a little bit more 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:37.000
 cozy comfort if you really need 

00:05:35.349 --> 00:05:38.770
 I think to try the customs to go there 

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.539
 for his favorite hockey is in 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:41.979
 first position both palmarolle to 

00:05:40.539 --> 00:05:44.020
 standards the honda fit 

00:05:41.979 --> 00:05:45.849
 Listening is a class and there is this 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:48.219
 that we see here is the 2015 model that 

00:05:45.849 --> 00:05:50.500
 are going to be redraw completely is 

00:05:48.219 --> 00:05:52.690
 still this year in 2014 that 

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:54.820
 remains a safe bet it's really 

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:57.490
 for the price a car that extremely 

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:59.320
 versatile logeable the tray is 

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:01.750
 completely retractable its consumption 

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:03.639
 fuel and its resale value is a 

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:05.530
 of mine well let's do an exercise of 

00:06:03.639 --> 00:06:08.680
 top-5 quick at the bartering loans let's go 

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:10.690
 shock for you there the compact sub is 

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:12.849
 the best guarantee lafitte lario and 

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:13.780
 the focus 55 hundred thousand kilometers the 

00:06:12.849 --> 00:06:16.199
 more frugal 

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:19.270
 the kia rio tied with the Ford Fiesta 

00:06:16.199 --> 00:06:21.310
 6.185 is the most powerful now 

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:24.320
 Ben they have accents and kia rio 

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:30.050
 with 135 centers actually horses 

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:31.460
 and the cheapest of the top 5 but for 

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:34.310
 many know it is a factor 

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:35.540
 determining in the round at $ 15,000 $ 114 

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:37.280
 including transportation costs 

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:38.870
 delivery and all that without skidding 

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:41.600
 possible right now between for the 

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:43.880
 2000 average price of ex thank you very much 

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:49.610
 Frederic I hope we did a favor 

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:51.800
 had already with his salvation to all this 

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:53.570
 segment is presented to you by a splash 

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:56.530
 to get a detailed report on 

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:56.530
 the history of an empty
