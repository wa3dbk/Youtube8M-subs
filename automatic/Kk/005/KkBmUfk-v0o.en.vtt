00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:06.150
 hi girls this second video by 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:07.740
 following what I do for you in this 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.809
 video I want you to see what I do 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.950
 I am brought here in Bologna as the 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:15.780
 organized and let me see practically 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:18.359
 three things I got from the Chinese 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.080
 this morning to fix tricks and not 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.760
 only 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.029
 first of all I took a hat 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:26.609
 of this color because I do not use them 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:29.519
 often the hats in Sicily 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:32.669
 let's say there's not so much 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:34.440
 cold weather for so long as one 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.510
 couple of hats okay talk about this 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.329
 I had therefore one harmony flight 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.489
 so spoken like 3 euros a thing of the 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.579
 I didn't feel like spending so much on it 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.680
 it is, however, the thing that is most important to me 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.590
 keko buy and why they are pulled 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:52.320
 what exit to go to this store 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:55.260
 I was literally assidati la 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.789
 ears was a ball that I know now 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.809
 that this is not much is not really 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.410
 what i was looking for 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:03.390
 but the middle way in the sense of oria 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.489
 wanted all black because black hair 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.080
 so if you blind me only black that they were 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.360
 huge costs 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.369
 that is to say, I will put myself at you, so it is black 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.650
 big guy like that 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.560
 so in the end the least worst was 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.150
 this then in the end I paid 2 to 90 is 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.520
 okay for now 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.740
 then maybe I'll make you the collection of 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.450
 old apple on 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.780
 not really if he wasn't joking there 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.579
 like ta keep very hot and fantastic e 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.250
 just another thing that I took I took 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.270
 like boxes for clothes and others 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.950
 things I've taken is the one for 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.350
 organize afterwards arranged tricks e 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.329
 I'll show you now this is it 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:44.840
 what I got from Chinese this morning 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:51.210
 I paid 790 so I think you want 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:53.250
 yes because it actually surprises after the 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.020
 case one of those plastic drawers 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.829
 but it cost six hours the 90 when I saw 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.659
 this was the triple in size 

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:03.329
 let's say more cute oh maybe fantasy 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:05.400
 better, however, certainly does not hide much 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:07.560
 more functional 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:10.380
 and I didn't take this practically 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.270
 which they managed to put 99 98 for 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:15.480
 one hundred of what I brought 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:17.430
 then I put brushes in the brush 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.080
 roll but I know myself the brescia does n't 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.240
 it would have been a mess for me to take them 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.490
 every morning that's fine, I put it 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:26.690
 here with ida face here to those with eyes 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:29.640
 as you can see they did not spare 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:31.740
 bring those davis and me quite a bit 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.480
 however, they have put the law more into crisis 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:36.630
 which are small then stein 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.490
 of the interior but those from the notice if 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.590
 they are bigger so decide what 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:42.180
 trying hard was me 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.459
 I say it even if cumbersome way 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.890
 bring because he wanted it to remove make-up 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:50.100
 there is no leaving high in the 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:51.540
 center liter side that I use but then I know 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.270
 that when it ends as there 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:57.540
 leaves is close and will not want to buy but 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:59.070
 I put babel cream that he is using 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:02.310
 but face cream 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:04.860
 in short, all these things here are those of 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.900
 day from the peloton this month I have 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.700
 made by hand then I went to 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.890
 these fragrance samples are 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.680
 some that I like then of 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.850
 poor of us and this is the part 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.980
 higher 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:19.320
 after which these drawers the accommodated 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:22.110
 so then in here 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:23.760
 I put it into reality I have to put back 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:25.530
 However, a glass is put smaller 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.230
 and we will know kill we see if I can 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.730
 then what I don't do because with this 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:32.750
 pochette and zeman are all pencils 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.750
 that I brought 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:38.240
 des but get out of it a girls madness 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:42.080
 not taken a fair bit still a lot 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:44.600
 and then it's all the lighter in these 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:47.900
 seven I am here I put it practically 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:50.989

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:53.390
 things to save there is some mask 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:55.520
 colored boasting purple of course 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:57.380
 blue eye liner including those in 

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:59.870

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:02.000
 minetti gift is certain then there is the 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:04.190

 of essence is the mark food langhe 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:18.799
 make time to use it for 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:21.650
 temperament that time is the 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:24.950
 place because every trick here with this 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:26.540
 many misleading light 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:28.580
 or I need to know about the mythical blade 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:31.490
 bring things so I don't know we'll see 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:33.470
 here all the creamy things in cream bases 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:34.340
 then the cream and pencils eye shadows 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:39.260
 ancestry 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:42.530
 as you can see also this saved e 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:44.210
 but here it is a bit complicated 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:47.080
 in short or in this project of 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:50.570
 fireplace and there are foundation and powder 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:54.260
 New baby cream foundation is a pair 

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:57.350
 background you in time and powders and to the side 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:05:02.900
 and behind there are the blushes the lands that I have 

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:04.520
 I'm brought here and then when 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:07.010
 will manage to slip it inside then 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:09.950
 I make in this drawer all the 

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:11.510

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:15.190
 put in this gift 

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:18.979
 lusi and then I spoke only three glosses 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:20.900
 some color my excised a little 

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:23.960
 things in fact then you will see the dirty hand 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:27.320
 folk and some attempts to fight for 

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:29.120
 lips and finally does not fit complicated and 

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:31.850
 then put the pallets that I brought 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:33.440

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:35.930

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:37.470

 this was this wonder hoof e 

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:38.760
 then I did not spare myself those 

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.160
 pigments when some pigments are 

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:42.990
 almost all mac pro's are luck 

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:45.990

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:47.370
 the only color pescara I didn't bring the

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:51.979
 grain pencils that Sabina said are 

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:56.220
 a port that sells very deep I put 

00:06:51.979 --> 00:06:58.919
 and then the pigments max the most beautiful ones 

00:06:56.220 --> 00:07:00.540
 obviously two brawn greenbaum in the 

00:06:58.919 --> 00:07:03.150
 Ordinance but those that do more 

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:06.210
 late and that's it 

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:09.030
 that I then brought the beauty 

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:11.280
 sponge and detergent closer together 

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:13.590
 strange these videos do a review 

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:15.150
 of the Tuscan workshop products that it is 

00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:17.010
 tried because it also finished the 

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:21.330
 make up all this 

00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:23.190
 this mini palette lacquer this is the 

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:25.950
 meta brush actually only from 

00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:28.410
 a little slow stopped for a while 

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:29.610
 now I should start using it again vi 

00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:31.470
 I will let you know 

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:32.009
 it's not that it drives me crazy then I do 

00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:34.499
 know 

00:07:32.009 --> 00:07:36.449
 and this is no girls that's all 

00:07:34.499 --> 00:07:39.569
 what I have brought I have to say 

00:07:36.449 --> 00:07:42.330
 even more than the forgotten bit of 27 with 

00:07:39.569 --> 00:07:44.460
 of the samples and I took the 

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:46.919
 they use cream foundation casts 

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:48.839
 in short, something that could serve me 

00:07:46.919 --> 00:07:51.389
 made a good selection is me 

00:07:48.839 --> 00:07:53.639
 carried here and nothing I hope 

00:07:51.389 --> 00:07:55.740
 company has nothing 

00:07:53.639 --> 00:07:58.259
 useful because I repeat a very trivial 

00:07:55.740 --> 00:08:01.110
 chest of drawers maybe from the Chinese you find them 

00:07:58.259 --> 00:08:05.639
 easily these these seven 

00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:06.779
 according to me do not saturate so much bo 

00:08:05.639 --> 00:08:10.819
 precariously we will see 

00:08:06.779 --> 00:08:10.819
 all right, girl next time
