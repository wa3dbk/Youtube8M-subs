00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.130

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.500
 to quickly reach all 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.990
 subscribed to my youtube channel 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:32.830
 the title of the video you are about to see 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:36.760
 it's a million views on 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:39.700
 youtube a gift for you 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:43.090
 let's see what it is 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:46.330
 today March 14 is a special day for 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:50.620
 the site like life when it smiles at you 

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:51.310
 after three years of tenacious work starting 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.310
 from scratch 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:57.660
 today my videos have reached the 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:01:00.790
 share of one million views 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:03.130
 on Youtube 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:07.570
 when i started it seemed like a goal 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:11.130
 very ambitious hard to reach 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:13.180
 since my videos talk about 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.780
 personal improvement 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:20.560
 a theme quite far from the tastes of 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:23.890
 youtube audience used to prefer 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:28.180
 light arguments for evasion 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:31.770
 yet yet I succeeded 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.770
 one million views 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:38.710
 they really are much more than a million 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:42.100
 I only consider the views 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:45.400
 of my channel's official counter 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:48.550
 of youtube and not all 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:52.240
 views of my copies 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:54.729
 videos present in several tens of 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:58.390
 other sites 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:02:01.810
 now we celebrate together to celebrate 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:06.010
 this event I decided to share 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:08.860
 with you who follow me some of the most 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:11.910
 effective strategies that allowed me 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:16.120
 to reach this goal 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:20.620
 speaking only through videos a 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:23.409
 a large number of visitors 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:26.110
 if you too know the exact strategies 

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:28.110
 to achieve a goal 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:31.260
 starting from scratch 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:35.060
 then you can apply those strategies 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:38.720
 in any field and consequently 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:43.500
 you too can succeed 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:47.790
 practically in any field and there is 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:51.000
 more in this moment when so many 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:54.180
 people are worried about work and 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:58.980
 for the future, to know how it can be done 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:03:03.780
 turning an idea into reality is one 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:08.160
 of the most important things for me this 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:12.239
 is possible thanks to my framework of 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:16.110
 complete reference that tells me in each 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:20.670
 situation with precision what I do 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:23.520
 should do and why know these 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:26.370
 things has enormous value 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:31.920
 I could explain it to you in a seminar that 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:38.100
 at a minimum it should cost 500 euros 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:42.150
 certainly 500 even a thousand euros even more 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:44.250
 with similar information if you are 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:48.390
 intelligent 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:51.480
 you can make a lot of money 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:52.880
 information that is worth much more than 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.970
 a qualification 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:58.540
 you think 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:04:02.890
