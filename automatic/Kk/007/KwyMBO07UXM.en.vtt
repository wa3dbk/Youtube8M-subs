of hands we can show you some tools that

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.109 
of hands we can show you some tools that
are<00:01:59.159> the<00:01:59.310> next<00:01:59.460> best<00:01:59.729> thing

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
are the next best thing

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.010 
are the next best thing
clamps<00:02:00.960> and<00:02:01.140> magnets<00:02:02.040> check<00:02:02.490> it<00:02:02.610> out<00:02:02.899> when<00:02:03.899> it

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
clamps and magnets check it out when it

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.959 
clamps and magnets check it out when it
comes<00:02:04.200> to<00:02:04.439> clamping<00:02:04.920> things<00:02:05.189> in<00:02:05.340> place<00:02:05.610> one<00:02:05.939> of

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
comes to clamping things in place one of

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.819 
comes to clamping things in place one of
the<00:02:06.090> most<00:02:06.240> common<00:02:06.630> tools<00:02:06.810> is<00:02:07.170> a<00:02:07.200> simple<00:02:07.619> pair

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
the most common tools is a simple pair

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:08.569 
the most common tools is a simple pair
of<00:02:07.920> vise<00:02:08.070> grips

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:08.579 
of vise grips

00:02:08.579 --> 00:02:10.400 
of vise grips
now<00:02:08.970> as<00:02:09.119> you<00:02:09.209> can<00:02:09.329> see<00:02:09.390> they<00:02:09.690> come<00:02:09.899> in<00:02:10.019> various

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
now as you can see they come in various

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.620 
now as you can see they come in various
different<00:02:10.590> sizes<00:02:11.190> and<00:02:11.370> you<00:02:11.880> will<00:02:12.030> use<00:02:12.329> these

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
different sizes and you will use these

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.900 
different sizes and you will use these
for<00:02:12.930> everything<00:02:13.650> so<00:02:13.920> you<00:02:13.980> need<00:02:14.220> at<00:02:14.340> least<00:02:14.370> one

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
for everything so you need at least one

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.990 
for everything so you need at least one
or<00:02:15.060> two<00:02:15.090> of<00:02:15.390> each<00:02:15.540> size<00:02:16.130> next<00:02:17.130> up<00:02:17.310> is<00:02:17.489> the<00:02:17.640> basic

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
or two of each size next up is the basic

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.240 
or two of each size next up is the basic
C<00:02:18.180> clamp<00:02:18.480> now<00:02:18.720> once<00:02:18.900> again<00:02:18.989> these<00:02:19.709> also<00:02:19.950> come

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
C clamp now once again these also come

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.460 
C clamp now once again these also come
in<00:02:20.400> various<00:02:20.790> sizes<00:02:21.060> and<00:02:21.390> the<00:02:21.870> more<00:02:22.170> you<00:02:22.440> have

grip and the longer reach allow these to

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.670 
grip and the longer reach allow these to
reach<00:02:42.120> in<00:02:42.300> the<00:02:42.390> areas<00:02:42.780> that<00:02:42.810> a<00:02:42.990> regular<00:02:43.410> clamp

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
reach in the areas that a regular clamp

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.120 
reach in the areas that a regular clamp
can

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:50.210 
another issue is when you're trying to

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:52.390 
another issue is when you're trying to
weld<00:02:50.450> tubing<00:02:51.050> or<00:02:51.200> flat<00:02:51.440> metal<00:02:51.710> together<00:02:51.950> and

weld tubing or flat metal together and

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.280 
weld tubing or flat metal together and
it<00:02:52.970> needs<00:02:53.210> to<00:02:53.300> be<00:02:53.480> held<00:02:53.720> at<00:02:53.930> a<00:02:53.960> particular

it needs to be held at a particular
angle<00:02:54.530> that's<00:02:55.310> where<00:02:55.760> a<00:02:55.790> welding<00:02:56.270> magnet

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:56.630 
angle that's where a welding magnet

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:59.140 
angle that's where a welding magnet
comes<00:02:56.780> in<00:02:57.140> this<00:02:57.740> allows<00:02:58.220> you<00:02:58.520> to<00:02:58.700> hold<00:02:58.970> the

metal at whatever angle you need to weld
it<00:03:03.050> in<00:03:03.110> place<00:03:03.640> now<00:03:04.640> the<00:03:04.700> best<00:03:05.030> part<00:03:05.270> is<00:03:05.540> this<00:03:06.020> is

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
it in place now the best part is this is

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.350 
it in place now the best part is this is
not<00:03:06.410> high-dollar<00:03:06.770> stuff<00:03:07.100> you<00:03:07.730> can<00:03:07.910> afford<00:03:08.210> to
