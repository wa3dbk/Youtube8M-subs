just<00:00:53.640> really<00:00:54.090> really<00:00:54.270> crazy<00:00:54.660> so<00:00:55.110> I'm<00:00:55.680> hoping

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
just really really crazy so I'm hoping

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.889 
just really really crazy so I'm hoping
that<00:00:56.280> when<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.550> xbox<00:00:56.910> one<00:00:57.120> comes<00:00:57.390> out<00:00:57.539> these

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
that when the xbox one comes out these

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.860 
that when the xbox one comes out these
bombs<00:00:58.379> will<00:00:58.620> be<00:00:58.800> fixed<00:00:59.160> a<00:00:59.370> little<00:00:59.579> bit<00:00:59.760> and<00:01:00.030> I

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
bombs will be fixed a little bit and I

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.139 
bombs will be fixed a little bit and I
think<00:01:01.190> don't<00:01:02.190> quote<00:01:02.460> me<00:01:02.609> on<00:01:02.640> this<00:01:02.730> one<00:01:02.969> but<00:01:03.120> i

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
think don't quote me on this one but i

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.880 
think don't quote me on this one but i
think<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.510> xbox<00:01:03.870> one<00:01:04.049> is<00:01:04.199> getting<00:01:04.320> 9v<00:01:04.860> nine

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
think the xbox one is getting 9v nine

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.000 
think the xbox one is getting 9v nine
games<00:01:05.489> so<00:01:05.939> that'll<00:01:06.210> be<00:01:06.360> pretty<00:01:07.049> pretty<00:01:07.530> sweet

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.539 
pretty good at the game I mean I don't
see<00:01:55.680> too<00:01:56.100> many<00:01:56.219> people<00:01:56.579> with<00:01:56.820> my<00:01:57.360> stats<00:01:58.290> on<00:01:59.130> an

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
see too many people with my stats on an

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.450 
see too many people with my stats on an
everyday<00:01:59.790> basis<00:02:00.329> so<00:02:00.600> in<00:02:00.960> terms<00:02:01.680> of<00:02:01.860> like<00:02:02.100> stats

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
everyday basis so in terms of like stats

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.800 
everyday basis so in terms of like stats
not<00:02:02.969> like<00:02:03.240> amount<00:02:03.899> but<00:02:04.350> but<00:02:04.829> but<00:02:05.130> like<00:02:06.119> KD<00:02:06.390> and

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
not like amount but but but like KD and

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.740 
not like amount but but but like KD and
when<00:02:07.500> the<00:02:07.590> loss<00:02:07.799> are<00:02:08.310> not<00:02:09.030> even<00:02:09.300> so<00:02:09.420> much<00:02:09.479> when

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
when the loss are not even so much when

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.210 
when the loss are not even so much when
de<00:02:09.840> los<00:02:09.989> it<00:02:10.200> doesn't<00:02:10.440> matter<00:02:10.590> quite<00:02:10.800> as<00:02:10.920> much<00:02:11.069> I

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
de los it doesn't matter quite as much I

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.809 
de los it doesn't matter quite as much I
think<00:02:11.310> Katie

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
think Katie

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:14.729 
think Katie
I<00:02:12.959> mean<00:02:13.959> when<00:02:14.079> the<00:02:14.170> loss<00:02:14.319> doesn't<00:02:14.560> matter

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:14.739 
I mean when the loss doesn't matter

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:16.770 
I mean when the loss doesn't matter
especially<00:02:14.920> in<00:02:15.280> TDM<00:02:15.670> which<00:02:16.030> is<00:02:16.209> most<00:02:16.569> of<00:02:16.659> what

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
especially in TDM which is most of what

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.709 
especially in TDM which is most of what
am<00:02:16.840> I<00:02:16.900> playing<00:02:17.109> but<00:02:17.499> in<00:02:17.769> terms<00:02:17.829> of<00:02:18.159> KD<00:02:18.459> I<00:02:18.849> think

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:19.719 
am I playing but in terms of KD I think

00:02:19.719 --> 00:02:22.110 
am I playing but in terms of KD I think
I'm<00:02:19.870> probably<00:02:20.409> ranked<00:02:21.099> in<00:02:21.219> the<00:02:21.249> top<00:02:21.370> ten

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
I'm probably ranked in the top ten

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.559 
I'm probably ranked in the top ten
thousand<00:02:22.629> people<00:02:22.780> at<00:02:23.079> least<00:02:23.760> which<00:02:24.760> is<00:02:24.939> pretty

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:25.569 
thousand people at least which is pretty

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:27.989 
thousand people at least which is pretty
sweet<00:02:26.019> so<00:02:26.859> I<00:02:26.889> mean<00:02:27.219> I'll<00:02:27.310> never<00:02:27.579> really<00:02:27.849> know

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:27.999 
sweet so I mean I'll never really know

00:02:27.999 --> 00:02:30.360 
sweet so I mean I'll never really know
how<00:02:28.359> good<00:02:28.569> I<00:02:28.629> am<00:02:28.749> compared<00:02:29.319> to<00:02:29.469> the<00:02:29.590> pros<00:02:29.889> but

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370
