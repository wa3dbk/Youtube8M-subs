alright<00:00:01.110> messing<00:00:01.439> around<00:00:01.500> with<00:00:01.740> dispensers

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:02.399 
alright messing around with dispensers

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:07.490 
alright messing around with dispensers
today<00:00:02.760> I<00:00:04.339> just<00:00:05.339> made<00:00:05.759> all<00:00:06.000> sorts<00:00:06.210> of<00:00:06.500> new

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
today I just made all sorts of new

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.370 
today I just made all sorts of new
dispenser<00:00:07.950> designs<00:00:08.550> and<00:00:09.179> my<00:00:09.750> favorite<00:00:10.170> so<00:00:10.349> far

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
dispenser designs and my favorite so far

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.120 
dispenser designs and my favorite so far
is<00:00:10.620> the<00:00:10.980> top<00:00:11.820> load<00:00:12.150> kind<00:00:12.620> so<00:00:13.620> I<00:00:13.650> throw<00:00:13.950> some

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
is the top load kind so I throw some

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.790 
is the top load kind so I throw some
string<00:00:14.429> in<00:00:14.549> there<00:00:14.960> this<00:00:15.960> is<00:00:16.139> the<00:00:16.320> thing<00:00:16.770> that

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
string in there this is the thing that

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.439 
string in there this is the thing that
kind<00:00:17.100> of<00:00:17.220> inspired<00:00:17.609> me<00:00:17.760> to<00:00:17.789> build<00:00:18.000> the<00:00:18.150> next

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
kind of inspired me to build the next

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.080 
kind of inspired me to build the next
version<00:00:18.949> so<00:00:19.949> when<00:00:20.100> you<00:00:20.189> step<00:00:20.430> on<00:00:20.609> it<00:00:20.640> it<00:00:20.880> would

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
version so when you step on it it would

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.920 
version so when you step on it it would
drop<00:00:21.300> you<00:00:21.359> on<00:00:22.670> this<00:00:23.670> method<00:00:24.029> was<00:00:24.180> too<00:00:24.359> slow<00:00:24.660> so

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
drop you on this method was too slow so

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.769 
drop you on this method was too slow so
I<00:00:24.960> built<00:00:25.260> one<00:00:25.410> it<00:00:25.560> was<00:00:25.680> faster<00:00:26.599> that's<00:00:27.599> this

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
I built one it was faster that's this

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.169 
I built one it was faster that's this
version<00:00:28.199> right<00:00:28.349> here<00:00:28.619> so<00:00:29.340> basically<00:00:29.730> i'll<00:00:29.939> sit

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
version right here so basically i'll sit

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:38.540 
version right here so basically i'll sit
on<00:00:30.300> and<00:00:30.449> show<00:00:30.570> you<00:00:30.630> how<00:00:30.750> it<00:00:30.900> works<00:00:37.309> it<00:00:38.309> gets

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
on and show you how it works it gets

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:47.170 
on and show you how it works it gets
your<00:00:38.730> crap<00:00:39.090> loads<00:00:39.690> of<00:00:40.020> kabul<00:00:40.530> really<00:00:41.129> fast

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:47.180 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:56.000 

have<00:00:48.180> tons<00:00:48.629> storage<00:00:53.449> much<00:00:54.449> stuff<00:00:54.750> right<00:00:55.020> have

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
have tons storage much stuff right have

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.040 
have tons storage much stuff right have
enough<00:00:56.190> space<00:00:56.489> for<00:00:56.730> stuff<00:00:59.690> some<00:01:00.690> of<00:01:00.840> them<00:01:00.930> are

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
enough space for stuff some of them are

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.660 
enough space for stuff some of them are
out<00:01:02.690> now<00:01:03.690> this<00:01:03.899> is<00:01:04.680> not<00:01:05.040> really<00:01:05.220> all<00:01:05.460> we

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
out now this is not really all we

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.000 
out now this is not really all we
finished<00:01:06.030> yet<00:01:06.299> there's<00:01:07.229> still<00:01:07.530> work<00:01:07.770> to<00:01:07.830> be

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
finished yet there's still work to be

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.100 
finished yet there's still work to be
done<00:01:08.100> on<00:01:08.340> it<00:01:08.610> this<00:01:08.790> is<00:01:08.970> just<00:01:09.119> kind<00:01:09.960> of

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
done on it this is just kind of

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.149 
done on it this is just kind of
exploring<00:01:11.299> baby<00:01:12.299> number<00:01:12.600> two<00:01:12.960> just<00:01:13.830> a<00:01:14.040> the

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
exploring baby number two just a the

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:23.380 
exploring baby number two just a the
number<00:01:14.369> one<00:01:14.549> over<00:01:14.729> there<00:01:15.500> later<00:01:16.500> number<00:01:16.830> to

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.390 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.969 

the<00:01:24.390> power<00:01:24.630> is<00:01:24.869> still<00:01:25.080> a<00:01:25.140> little<00:01:25.380> bit<00:01:25.560> off<00:01:25.710> i

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
the power is still a little bit off i

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.890 
the power is still a little bit off i
like<00:01:26.280> it<00:01:26.490> shoots<00:01:27.000> it<00:01:27.180> way<00:01:27.390> over<00:01:27.420> there

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
like it shoots it way over there

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.310 
like it shoots it way over there
sometimes<00:01:29.299> i'm<00:01:30.299> still<00:01:30.689> working<00:01:30.869> on<00:01:31.079> a<00:01:31.110> way<00:01:31.290> to

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
sometimes i'm still working on a way to

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.120 
sometimes i'm still working on a way to
fix<00:01:31.590> that<00:01:31.860> all<00:01:32.790> right<00:01:32.939> stop<00:01:33.509> following<00:01:34.070> as<00:01:35.070> a

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
fix that all right stop following as a

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.890 
fix that all right stop following as a
circuit<00:01:35.640> resetter<00:01:35.970> button<00:01:36.329> in<00:01:36.570> case<00:01:36.780> you

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
circuit resetter button in case you

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.870 
circuit resetter button in case you
restart<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.380> game<00:01:37.530> or<00:01:37.860> something<00:01:38.159> made<00:01:38.310> the

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
restart the game or something made the

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.080 
restart the game or something made the
circuits<00:01:39.270> not<00:01:39.390> working<00:01:39.450> you<00:01:40.049> just<00:01:40.290> click<00:01:40.470> that

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
circuits not working you just click that

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.440 
circuits not working you just click that
we<00:01:42.090> starts<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:42.540> timer<00:01:42.720> in<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.049> middle<00:01:43.320> here

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
we starts the timer in the middle here

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:50.030 
we starts the timer in the middle here
it<00:01:45.450> uses<00:01:45.659> the<00:01:45.810> a<00:01:46.439> 4<00:01:47.009> tick<00:01:47.189> timer<00:01:48.770> where<00:01:49.770> it<00:01:49.890> only

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
it uses the a 4 tick timer where it only

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.580 
it uses the a 4 tick timer where it only
uses<00:01:50.220> four<00:01:50.579> torches<00:01:50.850> it<00:01:51.270> toggles<00:01:52.020> a<00:01:52.350> little

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
uses four torches it toggles a little

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.270 
uses four torches it toggles a little
bit<00:01:52.710> faster<00:01:53.040> than<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:54.000> five<00:01:54.240> tick<00:01:54.540> one<00:01:55.280> which

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
bit faster than the five tick one which

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.639 
bit faster than the five tick one which
is<00:01:56.310> I<00:01:56.579> why<00:01:57.060> I<00:01:57.090> like<00:01:57.479> it<00:01:57.509> here<00:01:57.930> and<00:01:58.170> it's<00:01:58.350> more

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
is I why I like it here and it's more

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.120 
is I why I like it here and it's more
reliable<00:01:59.040> than<00:01:59.310> pulse<00:01:59.700> generators<00:02:01.130> because

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
reliable than pulse generators because

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.620 
reliable than pulse generators because
it<00:02:02.310> doesn't<00:02:02.610> overload<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.240> torches<00:02:04.430> and<00:02:05.630> so

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
it doesn't overload the torches and so

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.150 
it doesn't overload the torches and so
here's<00:02:06.840> just<00:02:06.899> the<00:02:07.110> basic<00:02:07.439> setup<00:02:07.680> at<00:02:07.799> the<00:02:07.829> timer

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
here's just the basic setup at the timer

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.790 
here's just the basic setup at the timer
nothing<00:02:09.149> interesting<00:02:09.660> it<00:02:09.959> goes<00:02:10.140> up<00:02:10.319> here<00:02:10.679> and

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
nothing interesting it goes up here and

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.370 
nothing interesting it goes up here and
this<00:02:11.670> is<00:02:11.730> the<00:02:11.970> switch<00:02:12.239> where<00:02:12.569> you<00:02:12.660> stand<00:02:12.959> out

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
this is the switch where you stand out

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:14.960 
this is the switch where you stand out
side<00:02:13.560> there<00:02:13.830> there's<00:02:14.340> wires<00:02:14.550> under<00:02:14.880> the

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
side there there's wires under the

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.470 
side there there's wires under the
ground<00:02:15.210> here<00:02:15.540> goes<00:02:15.870> up<00:02:16.820> now<00:02:17.820> we<00:02:17.880> can<00:02:18.180> go<00:02:18.300> up<00:02:18.390> the

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
ground here goes up now we can go up the

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.490 
ground here goes up now we can go up the
stairs<00:02:18.750> here<00:02:19.850> here's<00:02:20.850> the<00:02:20.970> top<00:02:21.180> side<00:02:21.450> the<00:02:22.290> back

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
stairs here here's the top side the back

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.450 
stairs here here's the top side the back
side<00:02:22.800> of<00:02:22.830> the<00:02:23.100> dispensers<00:02:23.730> right<00:02:24.060> here<00:02:25.460> easy

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460 
side of the dispensers right here easy

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:28.610 
side of the dispensers right here easy
access<00:02:26.910> for<00:02:27.300> loading<00:02:27.690> in<00:02:27.840> so<00:02:28.140> you<00:02:28.230> just<00:02:28.350> grab

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
access for loading in so you just grab

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.040 
access for loading in so you just grab
up<00:02:28.800> chuck<00:02:29.580> it<00:02:29.610> in<00:02:29.820> there<00:02:31.250> chuck<00:02:32.250> it<00:02:32.280> in<00:02:32.460> there

up chuck it in there chuck it in there

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:36.290 
up chuck it in there chuck it in there
just<00:02:34.050> three<00:02:34.410> left<00:02:34.680> in<00:02:34.830> there<00:02:35.010> throw<00:02:35.880> these<00:02:36.060> in

just three left in there throw these in

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:45.140 
just three left in there throw these in
there<00:02:39.260> we<00:02:40.260> left<00:02:40.470> in<00:02:40.620> there<00:02:43.760> the<00:02:44.760> way<00:02:44.910> this<00:02:45.090> is

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
there we left in there the way this is

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.780 
there we left in there the way this is
wired<00:02:45.510> up<00:02:45.750> over<00:02:46.170> here<00:02:46.350> some<00:02:46.890> of<00:02:46.980> them<00:02:47.070> empty<00:02:47.760> a

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
wired up over here some of them empty a

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.470 
wired up over here some of them empty a
lot<00:02:48.000> faster<00:02:48.540> than<00:02:48.720> the<00:02:48.840> others<00:02:49.110> so<00:02:50.150> but<00:02:51.150> you'll

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
lot faster than the others so but you'll

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:52.970 
lot faster than the others so but you'll
still<00:02:51.660> get<00:02:51.930> the<00:02:52.080> same<00:02:52.110> amount<00:02:52.290> of<00:02:52.650> Kabul

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
still get the same amount of Kabul

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.690 
still get the same amount of Kabul
either<00:02:53.310> way<00:02:53.460> it's<00:02:54.300> still<00:02:54.390> dispensing<00:02:55.700> which

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
either way it's still dispensing which

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:01.010 
either way it's still dispensing which
is<00:02:56.880> the<00:02:57.030> good<00:02:57.150> thing<00:02:59.420> so<00:03:00.420> it<00:03:00.480> doesn't<00:03:00.540> matter

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:01.020 
is the good thing so it doesn't matter

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:03.680 
is the good thing so it doesn't matter
because<00:03:01.350> its<00:03:01.770> dispensing<00:03:02.520> really<00:03:02.970> fast<00:03:03.330> and

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
because its dispensing really fast and

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.570 
because its dispensing really fast and
it<00:03:03.930> works<00:03:04.110> good<00:03:05.480> and<00:03:07.190> there's<00:03:08.190> a<00:03:08.250> little<00:03:08.490> bit

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
it works good and there's a little bit

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.210 
it works good and there's a little bit
lag<00:03:08.760> there<00:03:09.500> so<00:03:10.500> now<00:03:10.590> it's<00:03:10.740> be<00:03:10.860> filled<00:03:11.070> again

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
lag there so now it's be filled again

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.270 
lag there so now it's be filled again
and<00:03:11.670> you're<00:03:11.760> ready<00:03:11.880> to<00:03:12.030> go<00:03:12.950> now<00:03:13.950> the<00:03:14.010> wires

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
and you're ready to go now the wires

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.250 
and you're ready to go now the wires
come<00:03:14.580> up<00:03:14.700> right<00:03:14.880> here<00:03:15.270> this<00:03:15.660> is<00:03:15.720> the<00:03:15.930> switch

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
come up right here this is the switch

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.520 
come up right here this is the switch
one<00:03:16.530> and<00:03:16.920> this<00:03:17.130> is<00:03:17.340> the<00:03:17.580> the<00:03:18.150> timer<00:03:18.450> the<00:03:19.290> timer

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
one and this is the the timer the timer

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:23.540 
one and this is the the timer the timer
is<00:03:19.680> constantly<00:03:20.190> running<00:03:21.560> it<00:03:22.560> sticks<00:03:23.040> or

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:23.550 
is constantly running it sticks or

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:29.180 
is constantly running it sticks or
however<00:03:24.000> you<00:03:24.390> say<00:03:26.420> working<00:03:27.420> and<00:03:27.950> the<00:03:28.950> switch

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
however you say working and the switch

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.610 
however you say working and the switch
method<00:03:30.120> goes<00:03:30.300> on<00:03:30.540> the<00:03:30.630> upper<00:03:30.930> trail<00:03:31.170> here<00:03:31.440> so

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
method goes on the upper trail here so

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.220 
method goes on the upper trail here so
that<00:03:31.770> way<00:03:31.860> it<00:03:31.920> gets<00:03:32.070> to<00:03:32.970> this<00:03:33.120> side<00:03:33.420> comes<00:03:33.960> down

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
that way it gets to this side comes down

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:38.600 
that way it gets to this side comes down
here<00:03:34.500> and<00:03:35.570> allows<00:03:36.570> it<00:03:36.750> to<00:03:36.780> toggle<00:03:37.460> through<00:03:38.460> the

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610 
here and allows it to toggle through the

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:42.080 
here and allows it to toggle through the
ants<00:03:38.910> which<00:03:39.060> here<00:03:39.590> so<00:03:40.670> basically<00:03:41.670> this<00:03:41.820> pulse

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
ants which here so basically this pulse

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.690 
ants which here so basically this pulse
right<00:03:42.360> here<00:03:42.630> controls<00:03:43.530> this<00:03:44.160> torch<00:03:44.490> right

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
right here controls this torch right

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.900 
right here controls this torch right
here<00:03:44.910> which<00:03:45.450> if<00:03:45.810> the<00:03:46.170> switch<00:03:46.380> is<00:03:46.440> off<00:03:46.709> or<00:03:47.370> if

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
here which if the switch is off or if

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:49.400 
here which if the switch is off or if
you're<00:03:48.030> standing<00:03:48.390> on<00:03:48.480> the<00:03:48.630> switch<00:03:48.870> in<00:03:49.110> it

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
you're standing on the switch in it

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.949 
you're standing on the switch in it
turns<00:03:49.590> us<00:03:49.800> torch<00:03:50.070> off<00:03:50.280> it<00:03:50.550> allows<00:03:50.790> the<00:03:51.060> the

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
turns us torch off it allows the the

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:54.860 
turns us torch off it allows the the
timer<00:03:52.260> current<00:03:52.740> to<00:03:52.860> pass<00:03:53.040> through<00:03:53.750> into<00:03:54.750> the

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
timer current to pass through into the

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:59.960 
timer current to pass through into the
dispensers<00:03:55.530> and<00:03:55.770> constantly<00:03:56.730> toggle<00:03:57.300> it<00:03:58.970> say

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
dispensers and constantly toggle it say

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:01.910 
dispensers and constantly toggle it say
there's<00:04:00.180> still<00:04:00.420> some<00:04:00.959> over<00:04:01.230> here<00:04:01.260> not

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
there's still some over here not

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:03.620 
there's still some over here not
finished<00:04:02.280> building<00:04:02.459> it<00:04:02.700> yet<00:04:02.850> but<00:04:03.060> for<00:04:03.570> the

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
finished building it yet but for the

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.190 
finished building it yet but for the
most<00:04:03.780> part<00:04:03.870> the<00:04:04.440> basic<00:04:05.190> design<00:04:05.340> is<00:04:05.700> done

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:06.200 
most part the basic design is done

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.860 
most part the basic design is done
so<00:04:07.069> you<00:04:07.129> got<00:04:07.250> eight<00:04:07.400> Spencer's<00:04:07.940> here<00:04:08.239> the

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:08.870 
so you got eight Spencer's here the

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:12.520 
so you got eight Spencer's here the
shoot<00:04:09.170> into<00:04:09.770> the<00:04:09.860> water<00:04:10.040> and<00:04:11.050> it<00:04:12.050> all<00:04:12.260> flows

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:12.530 
shoot into the water and it all flows

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:16.090 
shoot into the water and it all flows
down<00:04:12.890> the<00:04:13.010> middle<00:04:14.200> matter<00:04:15.200> where<00:04:15.590> it's<00:04:15.739> at<00:04:15.950> the

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:16.100 
down the middle matter where it's at the

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:19.229 
down the middle matter where it's at the
pool<00:04:16.310> it<00:04:17.269> might<00:04:17.600> take<00:04:17.630> a<00:04:17.840> little<00:04:18.019> bit<00:04:18.169> longer

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:19.239 
pool it might take a little bit longer

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:22.030 
pool it might take a little bit longer
but<00:04:20.239> eventually<00:04:20.660> gets<00:04:21.049> there<00:04:21.290> the<00:04:21.829> water

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:22.040 
but eventually gets there the water

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:27.580 
but eventually gets there the water
stopped<00:04:22.430> by<00:04:22.700> a<00:04:22.729> sign<00:04:23.860> whoops<00:04:25.210> and<00:04:26.590> that's

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:27.590 
stopped by a sign whoops and that's

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:33.669 
stopped by a sign whoops and that's
pretty<00:04:27.889> much<00:04:28.010> it<00:04:29.950> that's<00:04:30.950> my<00:04:31.250> design
