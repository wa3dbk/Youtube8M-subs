and reflect on what I fought to see if
it's<00:00:20.630> worth<00:00:20.840> investing<00:00:21.680> more<00:00:21.860> time<00:00:21.920> into<00:00:22.550> it

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:22.670

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:28.189 
a time a great man once said I hate the

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:29.320 
a time a great man once said I hate the
fur<00:00:28.400> but<00:00:28.609> maybe<00:00:28.730> it's<00:00:28.939> time<00:00:29.090> for<00:00:29.150> the

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:29.330 
fur but maybe it's time for the

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:30.939 
fur but maybe it's time for the
inevitable<00:00:29.509> game<00:00:29.900> entirely<00:00:30.259> about<00:00:30.589> future

that<00:00:33.020> but<00:00:33.560> being<00:00:33.800> from<00:00:33.950> Ubisoft<00:00:34.490> I<00:00:34.670> guess

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:34.940 
that but being from Ubisoft I guess

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.090 
that but being from Ubisoft I guess
that's<00:00:35.150> kind<00:00:35.270> of<00:00:35.540> understandable<00:00:35.890> the<00:00:36.890> best

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:37.100 
that's kind of understandable the best

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.250

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:39.260 
way to describe watchdogs is that it's

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.319 
way to describe watchdogs is that it's
like<00:00:39.469> a<00:00:39.500> mix<00:00:39.860> of<00:00:40.070> Grand<00:00:40.399> Theft<00:00:40.579> Auto<00:00:40.820> and

once<00:03:38.310> again<00:03:38.460> but<00:03:38.970> this<00:03:39.090> time<00:03:39.150> you're<00:03:39.510> trying

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
once again but this time you're trying

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.210 
once again but this time you're trying
to<00:03:39.810> collect<00:03:39.990> all<00:03:40.230> the<00:03:40.500> coins<00:03:40.680> on<00:03:40.950> a<00:03:40.980> rope

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
to collect all the coins on a rope

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.280 
to collect all the coins on a rope
before<00:03:41.430> the<00:03:41.700> timer<00:03:41.910> runs<00:03:42.060> out<00:03:42.390> it's<00:03:42.870> great<00:03:43.020> fun

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
before the timer runs out it's great fun

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:44.600 
before the timer runs out it's great fun
and<00:03:43.590> you<00:03:43.830> would<00:03:43.950> have<00:03:44.040> thought<00:03:44.160> this<00:03:44.370> would<00:03:44.520> be

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610 
and you would have thought this would be

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:46.880 
and you would have thought this would be
totally<00:03:44.940> out<00:03:45.330> of<00:03:45.360> place<00:03:45.570> but<00:03:45.900> somehow<00:03:46.230> this

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890 
totally out of place but somehow this

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:49.160 
totally out of place but somehow this
works<00:03:47.190> for<00:03:47.460> me<00:03:47.610> so<00:03:48.270> far<00:03:48.510> I've<00:03:48.720> not<00:03:48.750> really

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.170 
works for me so far I've not really
