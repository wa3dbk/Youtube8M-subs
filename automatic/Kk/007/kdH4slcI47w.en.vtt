 decorative jewelry but also help 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:29.310
 genetic or disease related 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.669

 The blankets will be temporarily on beets 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:02.870
 approach is best suited 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.870
 for a standard hair clips 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:13.380
 now a strand is in the middle 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:15.000
 pulled out and gets as soon as the 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.380
 If she is strong enough she will become one 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.220
 turned them into each other 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.220
 wedged 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.280

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.680

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.590
 it rests on the last vortex 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:14.250
 for the perfect fit are now two 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.860
 strands of the respective sides of the 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:19.080
 lid pulled out and woven 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.470
 straight into the strand in taipei 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.470
 seated 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.360

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:52.390
 comb through any smaller ones 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:54.700
 color differences from the tail and op are 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:57.370
 no problem because the toupet sits exactly 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:59.050
 in the middle of switzerland so that it 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.870
 completely from the horse's own 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:03.760
 is enclosed 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:07.380
 if needed , Switzerland can now still open 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.380
 the desired length can be shortened 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:18.360
 the taking out of the tail op gives it 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.360
 just as easy 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:27.830
