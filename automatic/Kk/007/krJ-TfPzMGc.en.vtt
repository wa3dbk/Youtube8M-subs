the let's talk about the breath aspect
of<00:02:36.210> it<00:02:36.360> well<00:02:37.520> you<00:02:38.520> know<00:02:39.440> the<00:02:40.440> more<00:02:40.650> you<00:02:40.709> focus

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
of it well you know the more you focus

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.699 
of it well you know the more you focus
on<00:02:41.340> your<00:02:41.520> breath<00:02:41.730> in<00:02:42.060> your<00:02:42.120> playing<00:02:42.709> that

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
on your breath in your playing that

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:45.470 
on your breath in your playing that
better<00:02:43.980> the<00:02:44.190> tone<00:02:44.400> gets<00:02:44.730> the<00:02:45.030> more<00:02:45.180> control

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
better the tone gets the more control

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:46.850 
better the tone gets the more control
you<00:02:45.600> have<00:02:45.750> these<00:02:46.110> are<00:02:46.260> things<00:02:46.440> I've<00:02:46.620> talked

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
you have these are things I've talked

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.250 
you have these are things I've talked
about<00:02:47.160> before<00:02:47.340> and<00:02:47.840> it's<00:02:48.840> actually<00:02:48.959> quite

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
about before and it's actually quite

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.680 
about before and it's actually quite
necessary<00:02:49.560> to<00:02:50.250> accomplish<00:02:50.640> things<00:02:51.090> like<00:02:51.420> long

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
necessary to accomplish things like long

00:02:51.690 --> 00:03:00.800 
necessary to accomplish things like long
draw<00:02:52.140> legs<00:02:58.220> just<00:02:59.220> to<00:02:59.400> relax<00:02:59.940> and<00:03:00.360> it<00:03:00.450> forces

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
draw legs just to relax and it forces

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.170 
draw legs just to relax and it forces
you<00:03:01.140> to<00:03:01.280> relax<00:03:02.280> to<00:03:02.580> be<00:03:02.670> able<00:03:02.760> to<00:03:02.910> accomplish

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
you to relax to be able to accomplish

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.820 
you to relax to be able to accomplish
that<00:03:03.860> so<00:03:04.860> as<00:03:05.670> a<00:03:06.090> segue<00:03:06.450> into<00:03:06.810> your<00:03:07.350> daily<00:03:07.530> life

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
that so as a segue into your daily life

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:10.670 
that so as a segue into your daily life
I<00:03:08.010> guess<00:03:08.190> it<00:03:08.370> would<00:03:08.520> translate<00:03:08.850> into<00:03:08.970> if<00:03:09.870> you

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
I guess it would translate into if you

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.110 
I guess it would translate into if you
were<00:03:10.740> to<00:03:10.860> focus<00:03:11.160> on<00:03:11.280> your<00:03:11.370> breath<00:03:11.610> let's<00:03:11.940> say

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
were to focus on your breath let's say

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.420 
were to focus on your breath let's say

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
like five times a day you just blocked

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.060 
like five times a day you just blocked
off<00:03:14.640> five<00:03:14.940> minutes<00:03:15.330> so<00:03:15.959> 25<00:03:16.350> minutes<00:03:16.680> your<00:03:16.830> day

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
five minutes at a time scattered

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.630 
five minutes at a time scattered
throughout<00:03:19.110> the<00:03:19.290> day<00:03:19.470> it<00:03:19.920> did<00:03:20.160> nothing<00:03:20.489> but

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
throughout the day it did nothing but

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.550 
throughout the day it did nothing but
just<00:03:20.880> this<00:03:21.150> simple<00:03:21.390> exercise<00:03:21.630> maybe<00:03:22.290> of

taking a breath in like three or four
seconds<00:03:25.739> and<00:03:25.860> letting<00:03:26.100> it<00:03:26.160> out<00:03:26.310> for<00:03:26.640> five<00:03:26.850> or

six<00:03:27.300> seconds<00:03:28.230> and<00:03:28.440> it<00:03:28.980> continued<00:03:29.670> to<00:03:29.760> increase

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
six seconds and it continued to increase

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:33.290 
six seconds and it continued to increase
that<00:03:30.420> over<00:03:30.720> five<00:03:30.930> minutes<00:03:31.610> really<00:03:32.610> relaxed

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:33.300 
that over five minutes really relaxed

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.060 
that over five minutes really relaxed
you<00:03:33.450> know<00:03:33.570> maybe<00:03:33.810> taking<00:03:34.290> five<00:03:34.620> or<00:03:34.800> six

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.070 
you know maybe taking five or six

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:37.580 
you know maybe taking five or six
seconds<00:03:35.489> the<00:03:35.640> next<00:03:35.880> time<00:03:36.060> slowly<00:03:36.959> as<00:03:37.260> you<00:03:37.320> can

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
seconds the next time slowly as you can

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.070 
seconds the next time slowly as you can
then<00:03:38.550> let<00:03:38.790> it<00:03:38.820> out<00:03:39.030> for<00:03:39.090> a<00:03:39.390> little<00:03:39.600> bit<00:03:39.810> longer

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080 
then let it out for a little bit longer

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.100 
then let it out for a little bit longer
seven<00:03:41.010> eight<00:03:41.130> nine<00:03:41.160> seconds<00:03:42.150> always<00:03:42.870> try<00:03:43.050> to

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.110 
seven eight nine seconds always try to

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:44.570 
seven eight nine seconds always try to
breathe<00:03:43.350> out<00:03:43.500> a<00:03:43.530> little<00:03:43.769> bit<00:03:43.920> longer<00:03:44.130> than<00:03:44.489> you

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:44.580 
breathe out a little bit longer than you

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:47.210 
breathe out a little bit longer than you
breathing<00:03:44.940> that<00:03:45.690> is<00:03:45.900> what<00:03:46.080> I<00:03:46.110> found<00:03:46.470> to<00:03:46.739> be<00:03:46.950> the

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
breathing that is what I found to be the

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.610 
breathing that is what I found to be the
most<00:03:47.519> useful<00:03:47.820> for<00:03:48.720> building<00:03:48.750> up<00:03:49.260> my<00:03:49.410> breath

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
most useful for building up my breath

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.470 
most useful for building up my breath
control<00:03:49.950> and<00:03:50.489> I<00:03:50.730> think<00:03:50.940> that<00:03:51.090> if<00:03:51.180> you<00:03:51.209> were<00:03:51.450> to

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
control and I think that if you were to

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.110 
control and I think that if you were to
do<00:03:51.750> that<00:03:51.780> and<00:03:52.680> I<00:03:52.890> do<00:03:52.950> that<00:03:53.280> but<00:03:53.580> you<00:03:53.850> know<00:03:53.970> in<00:03:54.090> my

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
do that and I do that but you know in my

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.300 
do that and I do that but you know in my
plane<00:03:54.690> naturally<00:03:55.380> so<00:03:55.620> I'm<00:03:55.830> doing<00:03:56.190> that

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
plane naturally so I'm doing that

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:59.300 
plane naturally so I'm doing that
throughout<00:03:56.549> the<00:03:56.700> day<00:03:56.850> it<00:03:57.540> kind<00:03:57.870> of<00:03:57.930> them<00:03:58.310> like

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
throughout the day it kind of them like

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:00.890 
throughout the day it kind of them like
any<00:03:59.459> meditation<00:03:59.790> it<00:04:00.239> just<00:04:00.420> helps<00:04:00.810> you

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
any meditation it just helps you

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.140 
any meditation it just helps you
recenter<00:04:01.500> we<00:04:01.739> focus<00:04:02.130> on<00:04:02.280> what's<00:04:02.489> important<00:04:03.000> it

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
recenter we focus on what's important it

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:04.970 
recenter we focus on what's important it
forces<00:04:03.959> you<00:04:04.140> to<00:04:04.170> clear<00:04:04.410> all<00:04:04.530> the<00:04:04.620> clutter<00:04:04.860> out
