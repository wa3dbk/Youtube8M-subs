00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 hi nice that you look today i explain 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.569
 who does the card at the parking pressure 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.970
 blue see a slave that you need 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.970
 it's a pack of regular playing cards 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.350
 that cards that actually expanded 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.510
 joke is of course already around you 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:24.029
 playing card 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:27.689
 and shake tape and a marker 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:29.910
 marker is beyond the trick 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.790
 good preparation in these pieces 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:37.559
 need you bake first card that you don't 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:39.719
 used a lot and that is the joker 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:43.710
 and you are going to fold it twice 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:45.480
 and i would just celebrate and and care 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.780
 that it is a card with a white one 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.340
 side if you look this temple wrong 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:55.489
 here a bit in the side that it 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.489
 white is why i explain it so 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.829
 and then pick off a piece of tape should 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.240
 being your own clean 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:08.700
 Grab your piece of tape and turn it around 

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:11.610
 and then you stick on the card then you look 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.200
 just bring a card or the white side with this 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:17.009
 is so the wrong way you have to 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:20.939
 not being or seeing well but the white one 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:26.220
 side must be well behind 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:27.570
 that candle slice of tape and this you do 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.390
 in your shoe 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:34.110
 what you fixed a little back and 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:36.920
 then put on these shoes and 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:42.720
 then of course actually prepared 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:44.460
 what you are going to do is you choose cancer 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.659
 would have it again the piece modern 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.659
 draw card 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:56.220
 card are let's have to take blue 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:02:00.450
 we take this card 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:04.950
 the kart you two and like you still them 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:07.550
 who asks if he draw the card and 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.550
 nicely drawn 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:11.010
 this becomes the key factor 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:14.310
 well here but it is not so whole 

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:17.280
 very much from which trick but I love 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:19.290
 just get the trick out of the trick and out of it 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.250
 sample video so I say true 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.950
 on top of 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:25.230
 I can see him you can do the first part 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.520
 from the pressure this is just one 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:31.740
 skill that you need to know 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:33.870
 you take the cards together and then 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:37.080
 do you 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.280
 put your hand a little over it and then 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:42.450
 the card is gone 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:43.860
 how do you do that he is at the bottom of it 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.740
 is very simple but it is funny 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.360
 if i am also safe 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:52.620
 it is going to pour pretty fast 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:56.040
 crytek if you do it very fast is not 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.450
 really see it to point each other but or 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.489
 endorsing the quay 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:04.080
 but what you do you take the pile 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:07.110
 cards put two fingers on it and then 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:11.760
 your hand okay actually you saint that 's you 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:16.380
 pick up the one with this card behind 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:20.980
 meat and when you put it down 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:27.540
 it is also a doing is really how you do it 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:27.540
 margins quickly put the card on the bottom 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:34.200
 so with this case there will be sat two 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:37.390
 dogs are lying around so you look like that 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:39.040
 and the map has disappeared viewer more 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:42.129
 comes the second trick 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.790
 in says here take it in the map 

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:46.540
 so disappeared 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:49.829
 and you see you have pine 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:53.819
 put it together in my hand look here 

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:57.180
 please card has disappeared and you 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:59.650
 says look but look but he says you 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.540
 no one very familiar with the subli 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:02.769
 cards but the look that is no longer there 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:04.959
 in 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:08.940
 and among these again in your hand they 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:11.140
 look into it so nice to still bicker 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:13.720
 and 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:18.549
 do you have the drawn card in your hand 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:21.910
 for you go that guy i him with you 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:23.500
 if you're here on some processor time than 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:25.690
 You can't really see this of four and you can 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:29.260
 your hand also a little opal 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:30.250
 no because you know it's coming in 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:33.280
 my shoes 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:37.570
 then take off your shoes 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:39.940
 there are shoes so she pulled out since 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:40.450
 that card and what you do so look 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:42.460
 Well 

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:45.940
 garden card a package the shoe too 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:48.370
 what i mean is you can grab him like that 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:51.130
 catfish in venturi cards you what me 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:54.669
 doe is party shoes and i'm late now 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:57.190
 that card falls again so that it 

00:04:54.669 --> 00:05:00.580
 must contain both cards 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:02.860
 and if you then turn it upside down 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:04.690
 the card falls out and what I do next 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:06.940
 is by holding the shoe upside down or 

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:10.120
 quickly attract a lot of worries 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:14.520
 that the spectators do not see this card 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:19.050
 really already kept upside down old ones 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:22.259
 and then you leave the card that you are 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:25.710
 indeed the card that 

00:05:22.259 --> 00:05:27.180
 this trick is called my name 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:27.419
 different ways i can do it 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:32.310
 to 

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:33.690
 so in your shoe it can also do it 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:35.039
 make someone's ear appear 

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:39.449
 these are actually three tricks in one 

00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:42.419
 stone is therefore the card nights 

00:05:39.449 --> 00:05:44.159
 find out the second is it 

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:45.000
 fold the hand he was so 

00:05:44.159 --> 00:05:48.810
 rinse 

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:52.319
 You can also get a breast pocket Asia Marjan 

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:54.030
 sit this was the explanation 

00:05:52.319 --> 00:05:56.750
 thanks for looking and liked it so much 

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:56.750
 seems further
