why oh really Matty on his team made it

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:22.480 
why oh really Matty on his team made it
look<00:03:19.760> deceptively<00:03:20.210> easy<00:03:20.740> but<00:03:21.740> I<00:03:21.770> realize<00:03:22.310> of

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:22.490 
look deceptively easy but I realize of

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:23.890 
look deceptively easy but I realize of
course<00:03:22.520> there's<00:03:23.060> a<00:03:23.150> lot<00:03:23.330> of<00:03:23.360> technique

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
course there's a lot of technique

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:28.180 
course there's a lot of technique
involved<00:03:24.670> from<00:03:25.670> ground<00:03:26.030> retains<00:03:26.480> Paul<00:03:27.290> so

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.190 
involved from ground retains Paul so

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:30.460 
involved from ground retains Paul so

are the horse okay then haha and the
next<00:03:39.500> peg<00:03:39.680> is<00:03:39.890> to<00:03:40.070> jump<00:03:40.220> and<00:03:40.400> my<00:03:41.360> technique

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:41.690 
next peg is to jump and my technique

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:45.000 
next peg is to jump and my technique
it's<00:03:42.140> very<00:03:42.770> slow<00:03:43.250> yes<00:03:43.790> because<00:03:44.120> I've<00:03:44.390> got<00:03:44.690> some

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
it's very slow yes because I've got some

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.250

powerful legs and I am quite wide right

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.130 
powerful legs and I am quite wide right
also<00:03:48.680> I've<00:03:49.100> got<00:03:49.130> a<00:03:49.280> powerful<00:03:49.700> jump<00:03:50.090> yes<00:03:50.510> pookie

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:51.140 
also I've got a powerful jump yes pookie

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:54.130 
also I've got a powerful jump yes pookie
boom<00:03:51.350> boom<00:03:51.950> mm-hmm<00:03:52.610> I<00:03:52.760> got<00:03:53.570> need<00:03:53.780> too<00:03:54.020> much

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:54.140 
boom boom mm-hmm I got need too much

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:58.750 
boom boom mm-hmm I got need too much
speed<00:03:56.320> so<00:03:57.320> that's<00:03:57.500> a<00:03:57.650> fairly<00:03:57.890> easy<00:03:58.190> Heights

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:58.760 
speed so that's a fairly easy Heights

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.400 
speed so that's a fairly easy Heights
isn't<00:03:58.940> it<00:03:59.180> so<00:03:59.330> once<00:03:59.480> you've<00:03:59.660> got<00:03:59.840> practice<00:04:00.290> to

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:00.410 
isn't it so once you've got practice to

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:02.740 
isn't it so once you've got practice to
doing<00:04:00.709> that<00:04:00.920> then<00:04:01.550> you<00:04:01.700> then<00:04:01.970> you<00:04:02.000> go<00:04:02.270> higher<00:04:02.510> I

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:02.750 
doing that then you then you go higher I

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:04.870 
doing that then you then you go higher I
think<00:04:03.200> the<00:04:03.320> goal<00:04:03.470> is<00:04:03.709> not<00:04:03.890> to<00:04:04.040> go<00:04:04.190> high<00:04:04.370> he

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:04.880 
think the goal is not to go high he

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:07.330 
think the goal is not to go high he
needs<00:04:05.060> to<00:04:05.209> feel<00:04:05.420> it<00:04:05.570> when<00:04:06.320> you<00:04:06.440> feel<00:04:06.590> it<00:04:06.709> after

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:07.340 
needs to feel it when you feel it after

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.040 
needs to feel it when you feel it after
high<00:04:07.670> is<00:04:07.970> not<00:04:08.240> a<00:04:08.270> problem<00:04:08.690> you<00:04:08.810> ever<00:04:08.930> thought

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:09.050 
high is not a problem you ever thought

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:10.960 
high is not a problem you ever thought
of<00:04:09.110> carrying<00:04:09.350> the<00:04:09.650> horse<00:04:09.890> the<00:04:10.490> horse<00:04:10.520> gets<00:04:10.880> on
