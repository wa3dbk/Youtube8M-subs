00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
grind you want for your coffee powder it

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.139 
grind you want for your coffee powder it
should<00:01:46.799> give<00:01:47.100> you<00:01:47.220> cost<00:01:47.579> all<00:01:47.880> the<00:01:48.030> way<00:01:48.090> to

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
should give you cost all the way to

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.510 
should give you cost all the way to
superfine<00:01:48.780> so<00:01:49.409> this<00:01:49.770> allows<00:01:50.009> you<00:01:50.159> to<00:01:50.250> be<00:01:50.340> able

coffee<00:02:39.540> machines<00:02:39.870> at<00:02:40.080> home<00:02:40.260> again<00:02:41.160> this<00:02:41.400> is<00:02:41.550> a

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
coffee machines at home again this is a

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.580 
coffee machines at home again this is a
general<00:02:41.670> rule<00:02:42.150> of<00:02:42.180> thumb<00:02:42.330> if<00:02:43.080> you<00:02:43.140> have<00:02:43.350> a<00:02:43.380> much

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
general rule of thumb if you have a much

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.050 
general rule of thumb if you have a much
better<00:02:43.770> coffee<00:02:44.070> machine<00:02:44.400> with<00:02:44.580> a<00:02:44.610> high<00:02:44.820> bar

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
better coffee machine with a high bar

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.880 
better coffee machine with a high bar
pressure<00:02:45.300> you<00:02:45.510> may<00:02:45.720> be<00:02:45.780> able<00:02:46.080> to<00:02:46.170> get<00:02:46.320> it<00:02:46.470> with

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
pressure you may be able to get it with

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.550 
pressure you may be able to get it with
more<00:02:47.130> fine<00:02:47.400> grains<00:02:47.760> and<00:02:48.000> less<00:02:48.510> medium<00:02:49.320> grains

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
more fine grains and less medium grains

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.400 
more fine grains and less medium grains
so<00:02:50.250> you<00:02:50.310> really<00:02:50.880> need<00:02:51.000> to<00:02:51.060> experiment<00:02:51.959> with

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
so you really need to experiment with

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.350 
so you really need to experiment with
what<00:02:52.650> you<00:02:52.800> have<00:02:53.040> that's<00:02:53.970> the<00:02:54.090> end<00:02:54.209> of<00:02:54.240> this

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
what you have that's the end of this

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.540 
what you have that's the end of this

it's<00:02:59.700> just<00:02:59.820> that<00:03:00.060> no<00:03:00.209> one's<00:03:00.360> made<00:03:00.510> it<00:03:00.630> possible

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:00.990 
it's just that no one's made it possible

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:05.390 
it's just that no one's made it possible
