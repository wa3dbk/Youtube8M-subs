00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:07.340
 Yes 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:36.399
 consistent with the reason why they put me here 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:38.590
 in store asked from 

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:42.640
 I have a starter language at home but how 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:45.250
 use you want to show that you have none 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:48.070
 learned people seem to be one 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:50.290
 hare it might fit well 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.519
 used starter language to your people 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:55.000
 longer sharp languages 

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:55.750
 however, do not use a number on your knife 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.519
 to sharpen 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:02.190
 so it replaces non-professional 

00:00:57.519 --> 00:01:02.190
 Grinding work from professional is leader 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:09.160
 there are many different types each 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:11.560
 own specific children here 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:15.250
 line I can explain what exactly 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:18.399
 which style is prohibited is below 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:22.979
 those man stole a ceramic stand too 

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:27.700
 just blasting 3 of the steel 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:30.580
 quality of manure quality of 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:35.410
 sit right more that determine the 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:41.349
 time how long he is crazy but have here 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:46.420
 I am a standard cool this is 0 

00:01:41.349 --> 00:01:47.440
 at this point the intersection is also one 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.920
 technical terms 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:53.340
 the next question is the cutting section 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.340
 from their nest 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:02.740
 during use your lesbos and 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:06.729
 cut it actually becomes the fold 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:11.580
 preferably what you need is damaged 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:11.580
 this woman wants to sit straight now 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:19.480
 turning on is not the same 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.890
 we will put put so often 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.500
 it will probably be there 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:29.560
 through a lock d a new woman's eyes 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:30.220
 certainly in this example I use one 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.670
 nice 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:35.560
 stalls stand in fine rays in wave 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:38.890
 radiator 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:42.760
 we was very rule how sharp knife fine 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:46.890
 standing in standing in a climate 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:54.250
 left hand museum with point on a works 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:58.120
 for your quick take with your right hand and 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:03:00.010
 we put steel against this 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:03.850
 make sure that there is an angle of 15 to 20 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:06.040
 degrees you can often find the protective cap 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:09.070
 of the sharpening steel 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:12.010
 persist for putting the right angle 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:15.459
 again from the knife to the steel 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:17.709
 the blade almost the protective cap of 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:20.410
 the sharpening steel 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:23.340
 and moves in a cutting motion 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:23.340
 down 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:27.720
 you also do this with other sides 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:38.700
 your word 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:39.330
 beautiful singing faith does not often put too much 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.780
 to turn on 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:44.519
 is unnecessary there are several 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.629
 types of people are now different 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:47.430
 species 

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:48.930
 be written in the same way 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:51.299
 different angles 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.950
 people from problems often one of 20 

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:54.870
 degrees 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:57.329
 maybe excludes extra like 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:59.670
 Rossini that are often in sharp focus 

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:00.750
 ground also in a different angle 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.819
 white 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:07.079
 from my profession as mrs there are a few 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:09.540
 in the kitchen chef comes to stabbing 

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:10.670
 bin is going to be left hand with his 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:14.730
 own hand 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:18.680
 unfortunately a lot of busy a lot 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:21.720
 will actually go and fetch me 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:24.419
 not good at all 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:27.780
 you have to steel it yourself it got hard 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:32.340
 simply do it as easy to 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:38.310
 actually double crap is the knife eyes 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:41.610
 we can do it but then it's time to 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:44.310
 people to professional diligence and that 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:49.220
 we now need simple human screen 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:52.430
 and for how i see the name 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:55.000
 and sharpest prohibition and according to in with 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:55.000
 sat test
