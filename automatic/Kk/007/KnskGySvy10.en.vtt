 then he will be our 18 folder 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.960
 show you that these files 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:34.000
 already exist 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:37.180

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:41.290
 replace files target and then the 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:43.090
 whole installed note at this place 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:46.590
 then no matter if set now 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:50.020
 has that Japanese japan discuss eg 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:52.360
 all speak German if this would have 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:54.520
 also make sure that you stop 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:56.920
 an audio out chooses if now for 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:03:02.190
 for example , wanting to change voices is correct 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:02.190
 wanted to change then staged 

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:08.170
 then we start it because I want you 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:11.010
 still want to show that the whole 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:11.010
 worked 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:25.130
 and at the place rather plays that 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:28.130
 Just take a look and see you 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:30.610
 right back the unfortunately goes with it 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:33.160
 the ingame proof is not the same 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:35.720
 recording program 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:38.750
 that is a pity but that 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:40.340
 is not a problem because first I can 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:43.070
 assure you that works and 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.959
 second, if you agree with them 

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:47.150
 you also want to be able to join 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:49.510
 go on the side and find here 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:52.730
 her a video where these are true 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:54.590
 be shown again in detail 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:57.020
 and yes I hope the video has you 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:04:00.430
 Nevertheless, I hope you have it 

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:04.160
 helped call such fables and 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:07.150
