00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:05.480
 we will apply the technique of 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.859
 circle we saw last time 

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:12.710
 to draw an email 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.710
 as long as you are looking for your circle 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:23.090
 once found to score so 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:52.440
 so yin and yang this symbol is 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:55.980
 actually composed that two curves 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:59.800
 so it's a very good implication 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.170
 to see if we control or not 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:05.830
 curve 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:08.520
 so there you see that I put a little 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:15.070
 more worth a circle 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:19.300
 here after I'll explain the 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:22.360
 embodiment 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:24.130
 here you have your circle if we 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:29.500
 had stung with a compass what is 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:32.100
 possible also we would have found that 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.100
 this one 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:45.970
 had his center here okay so we're going 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:48.250
 actually make two circles that go 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:52.020
 give us immediately the forms 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:55.229
 we wanted to get where there is 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:58.510
 had a very points fight here 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:05.260
 and we will realize a circle on all 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:08.080
 the extent here diameter and we realize the 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:12.810
 same thing here by taking the tip of the 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.810
 fight here we realize our circles 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.060
 if so 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:34.150
 see we get to 1.8 sign of 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:37.830
 infinity we will iron a little more 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:40.690
 big of the front it is necessary more marked 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:45.760
 simply the half circle that we 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:53.110
 find here agree and we'll do 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:55.269
 even for the lower part you 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:03:00.160
 go see the drop-shaped form at 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:03:09.810
 appear and then you will be able to mark 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:09.810
 circles 1 it will be black 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.680
 one that will be long 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:33.889
 here after you'll just have to color 

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:41.230
 to vampire the parts that I assure 

00:03:33.889 --> 00:03:44.920
 now to have a guignol 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:48.139
 so here I 'll do it quickly 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:58.040
 you will take the time to do it at 

00:03:48.139 --> 00:04:02.599
 marker or others to have the black 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:06.519
 that you desire and here we have the 

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:06.519
 symbol of yin and yang
