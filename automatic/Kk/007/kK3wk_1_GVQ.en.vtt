hi<00:00:00.810> guys<00:00:01.020> welcome<00:00:01.410> to<00:00:01.530> Hamish<00:00:01.829> works.com

00:00:02.119 --> 00:00:02.129 
hi guys welcome to Hamish works.com

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:04.340 
hi guys welcome to Hamish works.com
today<00:00:02.850> let's<00:00:03.030> learn<00:00:03.210> how<00:00:03.570> a<00:00:03.600> transmission

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:04.350 
today let's learn how a transmission

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.130 
today let's learn how a transmission
internally<00:00:04.890> works<00:00:05.130> so<00:00:05.640> that's<00:00:06.120> the<00:00:06.899> shaft

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
internally works so that's the shaft

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.020 
internally works so that's the shaft
from<00:00:07.379> the<00:00:07.529> transmission<00:00:07.980> how<00:00:08.400> the<00:00:08.460> 1st<00:00:08.849> and

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
from the transmission how the 1st and

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.020 
from the transmission how the 1st and
2nd<00:00:09.690> gear<00:00:09.960> NK<00:00:10.410> this<00:00:10.590> will<00:00:10.769> be<00:00:10.920> taught<00:00:11.759> here

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
2nd gear NK this will be taught here

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.049 
2nd gear NK this will be taught here
with<00:00:12.450> the<00:00:12.540> help<00:00:12.750> of<00:00:12.889> synchronizer<00:00:13.889> also<00:00:14.280> so<00:00:14.580> we

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
with the help of synchronizer also so we

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.210 
with the help of synchronizer also so we
learn<00:00:15.360> how<00:00:15.719> when<00:00:16.080> we<00:00:16.230> change<00:00:16.590> the<00:00:16.710> gear<00:00:16.980> lever

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
learn how when we change the gear lever

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.070 
learn how when we change the gear lever
how<00:00:17.550> the<00:00:17.609> first<00:00:18.029> and<00:00:18.270> the<00:00:18.449> second<00:00:18.869> gear<00:00:19.050> is

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
how the first and the second gear is

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.220 
how the first and the second gear is
getting<00:00:19.470> engaged<00:00:19.830> so<00:00:20.449> the<00:00:21.449> bigger<00:00:21.750> gear<00:00:21.930> is

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
getting engaged so the bigger gear is

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.590 
getting engaged so the bigger gear is
the<00:00:22.260> first<00:00:22.710> idea<00:00:22.980> and<00:00:23.430> the<00:00:23.939> smaller<00:00:24.210> one<00:00:24.420> next

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
the first idea and the smaller one next

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.269 
the first idea and the smaller one next
to<00:00:24.720> it<00:00:24.779> is<00:00:24.900> a<00:00:24.960> second<00:00:25.350> gear<00:00:25.500> and<00:00:25.619> center<00:00:26.130> what

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
to it is a second gear and center what

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.009 
to it is a second gear and center what
I'm<00:00:26.369> moving<00:00:26.789> is<00:00:27.000> the<00:00:27.300> synchronizer

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
I'm moving is the synchronizer

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.349 
I'm moving is the synchronizer
so<00:00:28.680> as<00:00:28.890> the<00:00:29.070> synchronizer<00:00:29.550> moves<00:00:29.970> and

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
so as the synchronizer moves and

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.740 
so as the synchronizer moves and
connects<00:00:30.929> to<00:00:31.109> a<00:00:31.140> particular<00:00:31.590> gear<00:00:31.830> the<00:00:32.279> drive

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:32.750 
connects to a particular gear the drive

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.090 
connects to a particular gear the drive
reaches<00:00:33.750> that<00:00:33.930> particular<00:00:34.380> gear<00:00:34.649> and<00:00:34.860> getting

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
reaches that particular gear and getting

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.650 
reaches that particular gear and getting
transmitted<00:00:35.730> so<00:00:35.820> that's<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.180> second<00:00:36.510> gear

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
transmitted so that's the second gear

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.220 
transmitted so that's the second gear
over<00:00:36.809> there<00:00:37.050> which<00:00:37.559> I'm<00:00:37.710> pointing<00:00:38.100> to<00:00:38.129> right

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:39.230 
over there which I'm pointing to right

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.650 
over there which I'm pointing to right
then<00:00:40.230> that's<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:41.070> first<00:00:41.100> year<00:00:41.640> so<00:00:41.879> when<00:00:42.420> these

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
then that's the first year so when these

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.020 
then that's the first year so when these
gears<00:00:42.960> get<00:00:43.200> engaged<00:00:43.620> by<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.219> synchronize<00:00:44.789> at

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
gears get engaged by the synchronize at

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.420 
gears get engaged by the synchronize at
the<00:00:45.149> center<00:00:45.570> that's<00:00:45.750> a<00:00:45.870> synchronizer<00:00:46.430> the

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
the center that's a synchronizer the

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.459 
the center that's a synchronizer the
drive<00:00:47.670> gets<00:00:47.940> transmitted<00:00:48.600> through<00:00:49.440> the

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
drive gets transmitted through the

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.069 
drive gets transmitted through the
transmission<00:00:50.190> and<00:00:50.460> gets<00:00:51.180> through<00:00:51.600> output

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
transmission and gets through output

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.439 
transmission and gets through output
shaft<00:00:52.350> towards<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:52.949> rear<00:00:53.129> wheels<00:00:53.399> so<00:00:53.670> now<00:00:54.270> I'm

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
shaft towards the rear wheels so now I'm

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.209 
shaft towards the rear wheels so now I'm
engaging<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.469> first<00:00:55.739> gear

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
engaging the first gear

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:57.799 
engaging the first gear
now<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.430> first<00:00:56.699> gear<00:00:56.879> is<00:00:57.030> engaged<00:00:57.180> so<00:00:57.690> the

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
now the first gear is engaged so the

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.380 
now the first gear is engaged so the
tribe<00:00:58.050> will<00:00:58.410> travel<00:00:59.010> through<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.399> first<00:01:00.180> year

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
tribe will travel through the first year

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.209 
tribe will travel through the first year
and<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:00.750> second<00:01:01.109> gear<00:01:01.260> will<00:01:01.440> be<00:01:01.559> free<00:01:01.980> to

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
and the second gear will be free to

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:03.740 
and the second gear will be free to
rotate<00:01:02.399> so<00:01:02.699> there<00:01:02.879> won't<00:01:03.000> be<00:01:03.149> any<00:01:03.210> drive<00:01:03.510> there

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
rotate so there won't be any drive there

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.250 
rotate so there won't be any drive there
now<00:01:04.350> let's<00:01:04.939> take<00:01:05.939> to<00:01:06.270> the<00:01:06.390> second<00:01:06.869> gear<00:01:07.020> now

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
now let's take to the second gear now

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.200 
now let's take to the second gear now
and<00:01:07.470> go<00:01:07.590> ahead<00:01:07.680> and<00:01:07.860> gets<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.340> second<00:01:08.700> gear<00:01:08.939> so

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
and go ahead and gets the second gear so

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.820 
and go ahead and gets the second gear so
now<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.479> first<00:01:09.810> gear<00:01:10.049> will<00:01:10.170> be<00:01:10.200> free<00:01:10.590> the

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
now the first gear will be free the

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.859 
now the first gear will be free the
drive<00:01:11.070> will<00:01:11.310> be<00:01:11.490> in<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:12.119> second<00:01:12.420> here<00:01:12.659> and

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
drive will be in the second here and

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.660 
drive will be in the second here and
will<00:01:12.960> be<00:01:12.990> taken<00:01:13.439> from<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:13.979> second<00:01:14.310> year<00:01:14.460> and

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
will be taken from the second year and

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.760 
will be taken from the second year and
how<00:01:15.390> it<00:01:15.509> happens<00:01:15.900> is<00:01:16.049> that<00:01:16.170> you<00:01:16.320> can<00:01:16.470> see<00:01:16.650> the

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
how it happens is that you can see the

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.219 
how it happens is that you can see the
gate<00:01:17.009> between<00:01:17.250> we<00:01:17.640> have<00:01:17.670> a<00:01:17.850> fork<00:01:18.240> there<00:01:18.570> that's

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
gate between we have a fork there that's

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.410 
gate between we have a fork there that's
the<00:01:19.439> fork<00:01:19.740> and<00:01:19.890> at<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:20.729> end<00:01:20.880> of<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.180> book

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
the fork and at the end of the book

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.770 
the fork and at the end of the book
there<00:01:22.020> is<00:01:22.049> a<00:01:22.229> hole<00:01:22.619> where<00:01:22.950> we<00:01:22.979> can<00:01:23.720> insert<00:01:24.720> a

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
there is a hole where we can insert a

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.140 
there is a hole where we can insert a
shop<00:01:25.140> so<00:01:25.560> that<00:01:25.860> shaft<00:01:26.220> is<00:01:26.460> directly<00:01:26.850> connected

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
shop so that shaft is directly connected

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.679 
shop so that shaft is directly connected
to<00:01:27.360> your<00:01:28.520> gear<00:01:29.520> lever<00:01:29.790> when<00:01:30.090> you<00:01:30.210> change<00:01:30.509> the

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
to your gear lever when you change the

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.990 
to your gear lever when you change the
gear<00:01:30.900> lever<00:01:31.140> to<00:01:31.650> first<00:01:31.979> gear<00:01:32.159> that<00:01:32.670> shaft

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
gear lever to first gear that shaft

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.899 
gear lever to first gear that shaft
moves<00:01:33.390> selecting<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.530> four<00:01:34.909> synchronizer

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
moves selecting the four synchronizer

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.260 
moves selecting the four synchronizer
towards<00:01:36.900> the<00:01:37.140> first<00:01:37.409> gear<00:01:37.740> and<00:01:37.950> that's<00:01:38.790> how

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
towards the first gear and that's how

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.450 
towards the first gear and that's how
the<00:01:39.329> FA's<00:01:39.780> VI<00:01:39.990> gets<00:01:40.259> engaged<00:01:40.650> and<00:01:40.890> that's<00:01:41.130> how

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
the FA's VI gets engaged and that's how

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.330 
the FA's VI gets engaged and that's how
the<00:01:41.520> fork<00:01:41.970> actually<00:01:42.590> looks<00:01:43.590> like<00:01:43.799> you<00:01:44.009> can<00:01:44.130> see

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
the fork actually looks like you can see

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:45.469 
the fork actually looks like you can see
how<00:01:44.549> it<00:01:44.670> looks<00:01:44.880> like<00:01:44.939> that's<00:01:45.210> the

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
how it looks like that's the

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.630 
how it looks like that's the
synchronizer<00:01:45.960> now<00:01:46.409> let's<00:01:46.649> have<00:01:46.950> it<00:01:47.100> closer

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
synchronizer now let's have it closer

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.609 
synchronizer now let's have it closer
look<00:01:47.939> at<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.210> synchronizer<00:01:48.810> and<00:01:49.020> see<00:01:49.259> how<00:01:49.470> it

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
look at the synchronizer and see how it

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.039 
look at the synchronizer and see how it
exactly<00:01:49.920> works<00:01:50.159> so<00:01:51.149> that's<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.570> synchronizer

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
exactly works so that's the synchronizer

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.600 
exactly works so that's the synchronizer
and<00:01:52.320> on<00:01:52.439> there<00:01:52.710> you<00:01:52.890> can<00:01:52.979> see<00:01:53.220> the<00:01:53.369> gate

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
and on there you can see the gate

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.120 
and on there you can see the gate
towards<00:01:54.240> where<00:01:54.750> actually<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.649> fork<00:01:55.950> is

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
towards where actually the fork is

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.270 
towards where actually the fork is
getting<00:01:56.430> engaged

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 
getting engaged

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.640 
getting engaged
and<00:01:57.369> inside<00:01:58.000> the<00:01:58.210> synchronizer<00:01:58.630> we<00:01:58.900> have<00:01:59.110> dear

00:01:59.640 --> 00:01:59.650 
and inside the synchronizer we have dear

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:01.980 
and inside the synchronizer we have dear
deeds<00:02:00.010> which<00:02:00.790> is<00:02:00.909> actually<00:02:01.299> getting<00:02:01.479> engaged

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990 
deeds which is actually getting engaged

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.710 
deeds which is actually getting engaged
towards<00:02:02.530> each<00:02:02.710> of<00:02:02.890> the<00:02:03.010> gears<00:02:03.250> and<00:02:03.520> it<00:02:04.210> has<00:02:04.450> two

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720 
towards each of the gears and it has two

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.980 
towards each of the gears and it has two
gaps<00:02:05.140> and<00:02:05.470> for<00:02:05.650> the<00:02:05.799> sides<00:02:06.009> let's<00:02:06.280> remove<00:02:06.640> that

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
gaps and for the sides let's remove that

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.230 
gaps and for the sides let's remove that
than<00:02:07.990> one<00:02:08.259> side<00:02:08.530> on<00:02:09.009> the<00:02:09.100> gap<00:02:09.369> you<00:02:09.670> can<00:02:09.940> see<00:02:10.209> a

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:10.240 
than one side on the gap you can see a

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.180 
than one side on the gap you can see a
closer<00:02:10.509> look<00:02:10.720> at<00:02:10.899> the<00:02:11.050> synchronizer<00:02:11.890> all

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
closer look at the synchronizer all

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.309 
closer look at the synchronizer all
there<00:02:12.520> that's<00:02:13.000> the<00:02:13.240> unit<00:02:13.569> and<00:02:13.690> how<00:02:13.870> it<00:02:14.020> looks

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:14.319 
there that's the unit and how it looks

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:16.770 
there that's the unit and how it looks
like<00:02:14.560> and<00:02:15.069> the<00:02:15.670> other<00:02:15.819> side<00:02:16.150> also<00:02:16.360> we<00:02:16.569> have<00:02:16.750> a

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
like and the other side also we have a

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.390 
like and the other side also we have a
capsule<00:02:17.230> this<00:02:17.440> is<00:02:17.560> the<00:02:17.620> unit<00:02:17.890> actually<00:02:18.250> can

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
capsule this is the unit actually can

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.050 
capsule this is the unit actually can
move<00:02:18.610> in<00:02:18.819> and<00:02:19.230> sink<00:02:20.230> towards<00:02:20.770> a<00:02:21.610> particular

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
move in and sink towards a particular

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.930 
move in and sink towards a particular
gear<00:02:22.540> which<00:02:22.870> actually<00:02:23.319> carries<00:02:23.800> the<00:02:24.010> drive<00:02:24.250> so

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
gear which actually carries the drive so

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:26.910 
gear which actually carries the drive so
that's<00:02:25.180> simply<00:02:26.020> have<00:02:26.290> the<00:02:26.410> synchronizer

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
that's simply have the synchronizer

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.660 
that's simply have the synchronizer
looks<00:02:27.250> like<00:02:27.489> now<00:02:28.410> let's<00:02:29.410> go<00:02:29.620> further<00:02:30.070> and<00:02:30.459> see

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
looks like now let's go further and see

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.280 
looks like now let's go further and see
how<00:02:30.820> the<00:02:30.880> fork<00:02:31.209> is<00:02:31.360> getting<00:02:31.630> installed<00:02:32.019> into

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
how the fork is getting installed into

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.170 
how the fork is getting installed into
the<00:02:32.320> synchronizer<00:02:32.830> so<00:02:33.220> that's<00:02:33.459> the<00:02:33.670> fork<00:02:33.970> and

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
the synchronizer so that's the fork and

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.570 
the synchronizer so that's the fork and
that's<00:02:34.959> how<00:02:35.140> it<00:02:35.260> is<00:02:35.350> being<00:02:35.590> kept<00:02:35.830> and<00:02:36.070> end<00:02:36.430> of

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
that's how it is being kept and end of

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.250 
that's how it is being kept and end of
the<00:02:36.730> fork<00:02:36.970> is<00:02:37.090> connected<00:02:37.510> towards<00:02:37.840> a<00:02:38.019> shaft

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
the fork is connected towards a shaft

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.770 
the fork is connected towards a shaft
which<00:02:38.620> is<00:02:38.860> directly<00:02:39.550> connected<00:02:39.790> with<00:02:40.120> here<00:02:40.330> so

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
which is directly connected with here so

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.930 
which is directly connected with here so
there's<00:02:41.019> the<00:02:41.200> gearbox<00:02:41.620> now<00:02:41.860> let's<00:02:42.550> see<00:02:42.700> how

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
there's the gearbox now let's see how

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.570 
there's the gearbox now let's see how
the<00:02:43.269> fork<00:02:43.540> is<00:02:43.769> assembled<00:02:44.769> inside<00:02:44.890> the<00:02:45.250> cave<00:02:45.430> up

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
the fork is assembled inside the cave up

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.880 
the fork is assembled inside the cave up
so<00:02:45.700> you<00:02:45.819> can<00:02:45.910> see<00:02:46.150> the<00:02:46.330> shaft<00:02:46.569> and<00:02:46.959> the<00:02:47.110> fork<00:02:47.410> it

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
so you can see the shaft and the fork it

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.280 
so you can see the shaft and the fork it
is<00:02:48.040> connected<00:02:48.430> to<00:02:48.459> the<00:02:48.550> synchronizer<00:02:49.150> and<00:02:49.510> the

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
is connected to the synchronizer and the

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.650 
is connected to the synchronizer and the
gear<00:02:50.530> so<00:02:50.830> that's<00:02:51.130> the<00:02:51.519> first<00:02:51.819> and<00:02:52.090> the<00:02:52.300> second

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
gear so that's the first and the second

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.320 
gear so that's the first and the second
gear<00:02:52.780> over<00:02:53.019> there<00:02:53.260> as<00:02:53.830> this<00:02:54.160> fork<00:02:54.519> moves<00:02:54.850> by

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330 
gear over there as this fork moves by

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.840 
gear over there as this fork moves by
moving<00:02:55.959> the<00:02:56.200> gear<00:02:56.410> lever<00:02:56.680> the<00:02:57.220> first<00:02:57.459> and<00:02:57.760> the

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:57.850 
moving the gear lever the first and the

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:00.780 
moving the gear lever the first and the
second<00:02:58.209> gear<00:02:58.390> gets<00:02:59.050> engaged<00:02:59.440> so<00:03:00.040> that's<00:03:00.400> the

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
second gear gets engaged so that's the

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.090 
second gear gets engaged so that's the
shaft<00:03:01.060> again<00:03:01.450> all<00:03:01.660> there<00:03:01.930> now<00:03:02.560> let's<00:03:02.769> see<00:03:02.950> how

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100 
shaft again all there now let's see how

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:04.020 
shaft again all there now let's see how
it<00:03:03.250> happens

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
it happens

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:07.530 
it happens
synchronize<00:03:04.870> our<00:03:05.230> Neutral<00:03:06.100> right<00:03:06.370> now<00:03:06.610> so

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
synchronize our Neutral right now so

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.930 
synchronize our Neutral right now so
that's<00:03:07.900> neutral<00:03:08.290> so<00:03:08.860> gears<00:03:09.340> are<00:03:09.489> free<00:03:09.700> you<00:03:09.820> can

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
that's neutral so gears are free you can

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.030 
that's neutral so gears are free you can
see<00:03:10.090> the<00:03:10.209> third<00:03:10.390> here<00:03:10.720> I'm<00:03:11.140> sorry<00:03:11.350> the<00:03:11.650> second

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
see the third here I'm sorry the second

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.670 
see the third here I'm sorry the second
gear<00:03:12.160> is<00:03:12.310> actually<00:03:12.430> free<00:03:12.910> all<00:03:13.090> that<00:03:13.420> and<00:03:13.720> there

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
gear is actually free all that and there

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.310 
gear is actually free all that and there
is<00:03:14.709> not<00:03:14.920> right<00:03:15.100> now<00:03:15.250> I<00:03:15.280> engage<00:03:15.940> to<00:03:16.720> the<00:03:16.840> second

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:17.320 
is not right now I engage to the second

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.140 
is not right now I engage to the second
gear<00:03:17.470> and<00:03:17.560> now<00:03:17.890> the<00:03:17.950> tribe<00:03:18.370> is<00:03:18.549> on<00:03:18.730> the<00:03:18.820> second

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
gear and now the tribe is on the second

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.230 
gear and now the tribe is on the second
you<00:03:19.299> cannot<00:03:19.630> just<00:03:19.870> rotate<00:03:20.140> but<00:03:20.560> here

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:21.240 
you cannot just rotate but here

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:22.850 
you cannot just rotate but here
to<00:03:21.390> go<00:03:21.510> to<00:03:21.570> drive<00:03:21.870> in<00:03:22.050> there<00:03:22.260> and<00:03:22.440> that<00:03:22.620> drive

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 
to go to drive in there and that drive

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:26.030 
to go to drive in there and that drive
gets<00:03:23.070> carried<00:03:23.340> away<00:03:23.750> by<00:03:24.750> the<00:03:24.810> transmission<00:03:25.530> so

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
gets carried away by the transmission so

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.650 
gets carried away by the transmission so
you<00:03:26.130> can<00:03:26.250> see<00:03:26.490> the<00:03:26.670> synchronize<00:03:27.120> was<00:03:27.360> simply

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
you can see the synchronize was simply

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.290 
you can see the synchronize was simply
there<00:03:27.870> let's<00:03:28.110> move<00:03:28.290> it<00:03:28.470> further<00:03:29.340> and<00:03:29.640> also<00:03:29.910> see

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:30.300 
there let's move it further and also see

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.300 
there let's move it further and also see
it<00:03:30.360> so<00:03:30.600> now<00:03:30.960> let's<00:03:31.200> engage<00:03:31.470> the<00:03:31.890> first<00:03:32.130> gear

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
it so now let's engage the first gear

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.250
