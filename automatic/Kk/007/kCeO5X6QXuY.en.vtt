00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.150
 I came in late November early December 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:34.270
 contact with another businesswoman and 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:36.700
 You smell from Eindhoven and make it 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:38.980
 location it had this location in mind 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.390
 and she is also a chef there 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:42.699
 company director 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:45.280
 the one that went running the area and I have 

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:47.559
 here full car bothered to yes 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.360
 really show who who who who I am and 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:51.970
 what I what I what I want and now that I look 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:54.540
 but to the hospitality industry and yes this is it 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:54.540
 search results 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.860
 Firstly what I missed in the 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:02.149
 hospitality look here comes from the higher 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:04.820
 segment that's just the way 

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:07.250
 you cook i'm going to do something else 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:09.530
 only yes you find it that that 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.840
 just walked back and it was hard 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.790
 and that that magical border of van 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:17.030
 for my feeling that 100 euros each time 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:18.530
 was exceeded by the way and yes me 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.110
 just wanted it really accessible 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:24.050
 the looks at the clouds 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.520
 I also missed restaurants there 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:28.310
 could drink a cup of coffee on the terrace 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.440
 and for 250 oh you can walk away 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.390
 I miss the oven that you at 9 o'clock in the evening 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.979
 at half past nine you can come in for one 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.440
 for a good glass of wine 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:38.240
 and that's it but you can also have a left 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.759
 Their dinner can also do cocktails 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.619
 drink this is much more and and think so 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:44.240
 I love it to you on this story 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:46.340
 that it's not just a restaurant 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.560
 there is coming here opposite us and coming 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.119
 a huge school of saint lucas 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.429
 they graphic lyceum 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:54.469
 more than three and a half thousand students 

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:56.899
 and the ultimate wish is somewhere 

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:59.750
 something something in take-away every year 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:01.549
 of being able to do 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.860
 well everywhere you see the natural 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:06.229
 hamburger matters that are known to roll through 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.100
 you call people all meat meat 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:10.039
 oriented 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:13.510
 what what what strikes me and yes we have 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:13.510
 fish inch ips a bit of a new jacket 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:28.110
 I think cooking is fantastic and me 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.910
 each left diners know each task 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.640
 the pass I participate as much as possible but 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.560
 I think it's everything that revolves around it 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.390
 that it attracts but also very much and there 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.950
 I also lost my creativity and 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.950
 that limit is not only in the kitchen 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.650
 tomorrow evening we will be first guests 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:48.030

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.380

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.050

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:54.330

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:56.790
