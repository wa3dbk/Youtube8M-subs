 of salt that contain by themselves the

 preparation and cooked with what the 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:41.170
 final figure can exceed the 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:43.149

 through educating the palate from the 

00:00:47.109 --> 00:00:51.309
 childhood to avoid future problems 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:54.219
 of hypertension of the heart and its 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:56.289
 arteries or serious kidney problems in 

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:59.530
 a healthy adult your body contains 

00:00:56.289 --> 00:01:01.420
 between 200 to 300 grams of salt if 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.909
 exceeds this amount in limits 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:06.520
 The healthy body itself is acceptable 

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:08.980
 eliminate without difficulty however 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:11.260
 when this does not happen the organism is not 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:11.950
 able to eliminate the excess reduce the 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.420
 consumption 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.250
 the immediate first step and 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.079
 important and necessary to avoid 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.509
 alterations in blood pressure 

00:01:17.079 --> 00:01:22.179
 heart or irreversible damage to 

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:23.860
 kidneys these are some of the 

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:26.619
 consequences of abuse in consumption 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.630

 silent or table salt to medium and 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:33.100
 long- term excess salt retains 

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:35.409
 water with consequent weight gain 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.479
 and work overload that forces the 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:39.030
 heart to the liver and kidneys to 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:41.500
 work beyond your means 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.299
 is the cause of problems of 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.580
 high blood pressure 

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:47.920
 Heart diseases 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:50.170
 hepatic kidneys and other organs of the 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.329
 body the problems do not appear 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.130
 immediate way but with the passage of 

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:56.229
 time so it's best to take 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.239
 precautions since childhood and it's 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:00.610
 responsibility of adults to take care of 

00:01:58.239 --> 00:02:03.189
 diabetic smokers and people

 obese are aggravated any dysfunction 

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:07.959
 of the organism in the face of excessive consumption 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:10.179
 of salt irritability good if you 

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:11.500
 they consume excess salt, these are the 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:13.660
 results to future 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.079
 remember nothing with excess everything with 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.079
 measure
