00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:13.670
 an all-Italian case for mercedes 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:15.950
 class b fueled by natural gas which it adopts 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:17.810
 composite material cylinder in place 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:19.550
 of those in steel with advantages in 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:20.720
 terms of consumption autonomy e 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.340
 lightness 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.590
 the cylinders are guaranteed by the house 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.750
 of the star for twenty years but the archaic 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:28.850
 and cumbersome Italian bureaucracy does not 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:31.070
 no difference between steel cylinder 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:32.720
 and composite material forcing the 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.269
 customers to the useless and harmful 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:37.220
 periodic redevelopment of the cylinder 

00:00:35.269 --> 00:00:38.870
 every four years with the risk of 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:41.059
 valve damage the 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.460
 German manufacturer is thus forced 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:45.470
 from the primitive Italian regulations to the 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.629
 preventive cylinder replacement 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:50.930
 to protect the safety of one's own 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:53.239
 customers the first half class 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:55.280
 introduced a great novelty 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:56.979
 these are these composite cylinders 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.780
 in size there are five of them 

00:00:56.979 --> 00:01:01.820
 positioned in the lower space e 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.799
 what we call the energy space 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.290
 so they are actually not hidden 

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:06.799
 occupy the space needed for i 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.630
 luggage 

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:10.430
 therefore the client even if he notices 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.469
 having a methane car looks like one 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.180
 normal car and this got us 

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:16.609
 through these cylinders that they use 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.560
 of composite materials that are gods 

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:20.750
 Synthetic materials is not the classic 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.090
 steel and are positioned at various points 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.899
 of the machine hidden inside 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.399
 the car 

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:26.719
 this is a big jump because also 

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:29.450
 from the point of view of lightness 

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:31.579
 this material allows you to have one 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.649
 greater efficiency in terms of 

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:34.520
 terms also of weight consumption 

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:36.890
 we bring with you 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.439
 but now this thing is in Italy 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.749
 undergoing a big stop because we are 

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:43.670
 obliged at the time of the 

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:45.490
 overhaul to replace the cylinders because 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.749
 these therefore cannot be 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:50.179
 disassemble and cannot be made 

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:52.999
 classic leak test that is done 

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:55.159
 on old antique steel cylinders 

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:57.259
 but these bomber jackets are the proof that would go 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:59.509
 made the test that is done in 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:01.909
 other European countries in Germany is 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:05.210
 simply try a sight test 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:06.950
 a a an external verification and 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:10.649
 bomb functionality and verification 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.819
 that there are no leaks oblige 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.700
 the builders they are using 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:16.650
 this new technology to use the 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.170
 old verification techniques 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.060
 technology is an absurd technical absurdity 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.739
 which is limiting the spread of 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.390
 this of this technology and is 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:26.569
 by limiting progress the advantages for i 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.569
 customers
