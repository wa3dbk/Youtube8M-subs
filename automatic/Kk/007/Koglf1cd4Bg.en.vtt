00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:39.350
 I'm probably s'pose 60 but on the xbox 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:42.080

 utility 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.940

 and of course I also have it on more often 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:25.370
 a weapon is therefore not really super anyway 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.230

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:30.260

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:46.190
 ni tired immediately pick up the weapon 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:48.380

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:50.060

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.780

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:55.340
 voyage of discovery from such acting on the 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.930
 matt walk because this is not good I 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:58.400

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:09.470
 weapon falls because I don't need anything 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:12.670

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:19.040
 shot all day looking behind me or 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:21.049

 below must address as medical press after 

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:19.320

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:22.050
 to be able to win now with 

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:24.320
