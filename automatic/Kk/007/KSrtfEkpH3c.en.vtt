Hello everyone! 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:04.400
A few days ago I did a review of the Trust Starzz microphone, 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.839
 it's this one that you see here.

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.800
It's a low-end microphone, but has a decent sound quality.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.900
At first, I had the problem that when I plugged it to my computer's

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.190
microphone input, there was a very annoying static noise,

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:22.179
like a badly tuned radio. But I realised that the problem was not in the 

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:25.960
micro, but in my computer, since it's the internal sound card that causes 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:27.018
that noise. 

00:00:27.018 --> 00:00:31.338
So I bought this little external USB sound card. 

00:00:31.338 --> 00:00:36.030
Actually, there isn't a brand name. It just says 7.1 Channel Sound,

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.800
and when I bought it, came without box, so almost certainly it's an imitation

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:44.429
I bought it in ebay for about 2 euros.

00:00:44.429 --> 00:00:47.840
It's the card I'm using to record this video. 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.700
And for you to check the level of background noise,

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.000
I'll leave a few seconds in silence. 

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:03.000
The truth is that it works pretty well: to notice the background noise you'd need

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.709
to increase the volume to maximum. 

00:01:04.709 --> 00:01:08.179
About the headphone output, the only thing I can say is that works 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.980
 correctly, although I prefer my PC's. 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:15.019
I don'tt know how to describe it, but it's like the bass didn't sound quite right. 

00:01:15.019 --> 00:01:18.319
And there's some more background noise that if I plug the 

00:01:18.319 --> 00:01:20.559
headphones directly to the computer. 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.700
It would be a cheap alternative if your internal sound card wouldn't work.

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:29.700
Now I'll give an example of a song recorded by this sound card.

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.569
To do this I simply used a male minijack cable at both ends, 

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:39.579
from the headphone output of the card to the microphone input.

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:43.500
And then I'll put the same song, but directly, ie, 

00:01:43.709 --> 00:01:45.699
without going through the sound card. 

00:02:07.129 --> 00:02:10.388
There is the possibility to activate some supplements. 

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:13.829
For example, we can check the bass boost box:

00:02:13.829 --> 00:02:17.699
the sound improves somewhat, but it's still far from the quality of the original song. 

00:02:20.278 --> 00:02:23.588
I can't speak about the 7.1 sound because I don't have any

00:02:23.588 --> 00:02:27.658
audio with that kind of sound, nor speakers to reproduce it, 

00:02:27.658 --> 00:02:31.878
but I doubt a 2-euros card could offer a good 7.1 sound. 

00:02:33.169 --> 00:02:37.900
Installation is simple. I have Windows 8.1 and I just needed to connect it.

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.000
The green LED flashes when you are using the card,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.800
for example, now, while I'm recording the voice of this video.

00:02:45.429 --> 00:02:49.348
And if you mute the microphone completely, the red light is on. 

00:02:49.348 --> 00:02:51.899
The buttons are used to raise or lower the volume, 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.709
although I prefer not to use them; it's better to control 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:57.528
the volume from your computer. 

00:02:57.528 --> 00:03:01.248
In closing, just say that I do recommend for use with microphone 

00:03:01.248 --> 00:03:05.388
due to the low background noise it has, but not if what you need is a 

00:03:05.389 --> 00:03:08.098
 headphone or speakers output.

00:03:08.098 --> 00:03:08.658
 See you soon! 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.600
Sorry for my poor English! I tried my best ;)
