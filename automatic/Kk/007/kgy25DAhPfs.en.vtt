00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:22.330
 This TV Elji basically 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:27.170
 program fork player works style d &amp; g 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:27.890
 model 690 you need to go to the menu with 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.260
 applications 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.310
 click on the button on the common path l d a 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:35.360
 n ips 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:37.130
 my applications and icons appear 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.790
 installed applications we need 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.090
 go to 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.090

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:50.640
 Yes 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:52.200
 and see what happens here 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.819
 as if everything is switched but 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.520
 top right can be switched 

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:58.140
 here is the dos button of the applications that 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.609
 set to tv's memory on 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.390
 application to star is set to 

00:01:59.609 --> 00:02:03.420
 usb flash drive 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.849
 In this case, this is our player port 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.920
 It was highlighted in Japanese and we choose 

00:02:05.849 --> 00:02:09.899
 I want to say that the only minus 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.470
 This application is what 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:16.290
 Firstly, it can sometimes turn on. 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.769
 i.e. mines do not see this application 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.769
 on a flash drive 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.670
 we fight on 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:33.170
 try 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.170
 fix it 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.630
 and so the application has opened 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:44.290
 please as the menu said a little bit 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:45.800
 can only slow down but the menu itself 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.570
 movies themselves 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:50.330
 I will not slow down that is the beginning 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:52.130
 they load and then go without 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:55.810
 brake hd cinema 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:03:01.520

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:16.280

 you may not know much now to 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:57.010
 noticeable quality is quite quite 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:04:00.070
 decently as you see here is 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:05.170
 12 channels among which there are 18 

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:06.720
 advantages in principle for smart widgets you 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:10.320
 is rare 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:16.770
