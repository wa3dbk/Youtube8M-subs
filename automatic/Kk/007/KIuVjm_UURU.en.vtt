00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.749 
of woods so they have that and then as
time<00:01:47.009> went<00:01:47.189> on<00:01:48.530> spring<00:01:49.530> of<00:01:49.649> 2012<00:01:50.250> comes<00:01:50.490> along

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
time went on spring of 2012 comes along

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.850 
time went on spring of 2012 comes along
and<00:01:51.000> then<00:01:51.659> he<00:01:52.020> releases<00:01:52.290> a<00:01:52.439> scent<00:01:52.590> called

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
and then he releases a scent called

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.249 
and then he releases a scent called
gingham<00:01:53.250> apple<00:01:53.640> so<00:01:54.270> now<00:01:54.390> gingham<00:01:54.750> apple<00:01:55.140> is

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
gingham apple so now gingham apple is

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.910 
gingham apple so now gingham apple is
basically<00:01:55.770> um<00:01:56.780> both<00:01:57.780> of<00:01:57.960> them<00:01:58.110> without<00:01:58.500> the

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
basically um both of them without the

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.370 
basically um both of them without the
spice<00:01:59.130> it's<00:01:59.399> just<00:01:59.579> a<00:01:59.700> little<00:01:59.909> bit<00:02:00.000> sweeter<00:02:00.380> so

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
spice it's just a little bit sweeter so

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.770 
spice it's just a little bit sweeter so
they've<00:02:01.829> recycled<00:02:02.520> the<00:02:02.640> scent<00:02:02.939> they<00:02:03.240> renamed

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
they've recycled the scent they renamed

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.840 
they've recycled the scent they renamed
it and<00:02:04.229> they<00:02:05.189> just<00:02:05.399> put<00:02:05.549> it<00:02:05.640> through<00:02:05.790> the

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
it and they just put it through the

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.249 
it and they just put it through the
wringer<00:02:05.909> and<00:02:06.210> it's<00:02:06.420> rather<00:02:06.600> annoying<00:02:06.960> because

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
wringer and it's rather annoying because

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.699 
wringer and it's rather annoying because
I<00:02:08.209> can't<00:02:09.209> get<00:02:09.360> any<00:02:09.539> satisfaction<00:02:09.720> out<00:02:10.319> of<00:02:10.379> the

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
I can't get any satisfaction out of the

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.559 
I can't get any satisfaction out of the
original<00:02:10.920> which<00:02:11.340> is<00:02:11.520> fresh<00:02:11.790> market<00:02:12.120> apple
