00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:37.500
 my name is rudi fuchs i am 22 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:40.400
 I am from RhÃ¶ndorf I am 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:43.140
 native of the states than in america 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:47.000
 how did you like the shooting today? 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.000
 fotoshooting with the volvo team v es 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:52.500
 At any time the people are back 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.090
 different from what I imagined very much 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:57.420
 kind and courteous 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:03:01.200
 So as I said though, good shooting 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:02.700
 it 's cold but otherwise what do you have 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.790
 something already done in the direction 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.380
 tuning to be honest no it is 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.569
 the first time i am interested 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:12.480
 already for cars but never before 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:15.090
 specially written how are you too 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.830
 am modeling come come to paint 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.569
 I actually by the photographer of 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.230
 asked me if I start with him 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:21.569
 would like to 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:27.060
 gradually you develop yours 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:28.760
 peculiarities and starts modeling what 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:31.980
 are you mainly for photos 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:35.819
 Actually, I finally got photos 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:38.630
 many areas in fashion and then but 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:41.989
 in other areas as well 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:45.630
 get the easiest underwear 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:47.489
 So I am very spread out there 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:52.590
 but I always think should someday 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:54.540
 There is never a living standard and it 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:56.880
 is first time I miss a vote 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:59.220
 Participants and I am very positive 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:01.109
 I'm surprised that I continue in the word 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:03.660
 have come and also for tuning world 

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:06.510
 what can you expect good chances 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:08.489
 to win Easter I hope that I to 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:10.350
 I'm under the last twelve 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:12.810
 not at the first decision 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:14.940
 fly out and I just hope that 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:16.680
 the people strongly support me and 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:18.269
 The jury agrees with me too 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.340
 just curious how it will be 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:21.840
 and if it does not work then I am too 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:24.510
 not sad when I experience NEN 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:25.139
 Of course I hope so too 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:26.910
 win 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:29.130
 I would not attend classes though 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:31.910
 I'm also happy if I just 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:31.910
 come a little further 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:56.409
 we are waiting fotoshooting 

00:04:51.469 --> 00:04:56.409
 I was the whole team today
