00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
one is my little tiny switchblade

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.170 
one is my little tiny switchblade
actually<00:00:15.120> I<00:00:16.160> didn't<00:00:17.160> think<00:00:17.460> of<00:00:17.580> measuring<00:00:18.060> it

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
actually I didn't think of measuring it

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.640 
actually I didn't think of measuring it
before<00:00:18.510> I<00:00:18.539> took<00:00:18.630> the<00:00:18.869> video<00:00:18.990> which<00:00:19.289> is<00:00:19.320> what<00:00:19.619> i

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
before I took the video which is what i

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:26.470 
before I took the video which is what i
usually<00:00:19.830> do<00:00:20.189> so<00:00:21.199> let's<00:00:22.199> get<00:00:22.439> my<00:00:22.590> lucky<00:00:24.470> little

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:26.480 
usually do so let's get my lucky little

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.849 
usually do so let's get my lucky little
measuring<00:00:27.480> stick<00:00:28.170> and<00:00:29.000> get<00:00:30.000> this<00:00:30.210> plate<00:00:30.570> out

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:30.859 
measuring stick and get this plate out

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:35.440 
measuring stick and get this plate out
think<00:00:31.859> what<00:00:32.009> this<00:00:32.040> plate<00:00:32.399> is<00:00:32.730> it<00:00:33.120> is<00:00:33.270> old<00:00:33.630> and

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:35.450 
think what this plate is it is old and

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:40.639 
think what this plate is it is old and
kind<00:00:37.460> not<00:00:38.460> as<00:00:38.700> springy<00:00:39.660> as<00:00:40.020> it<00:00:40.200> used<00:00:40.379> to<00:00:40.500> be

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
kind not as springy as it used to be

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.040 
kind not as springy as it used to be
able<00:00:40.770> to<00:00:40.950> suppose<00:00:41.309> so<00:00:41.760> if<00:00:42.570> I<00:00:42.719> already<00:00:42.840> just

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
able to suppose so if I already just

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.500 
able to suppose so if I already just
press<00:00:43.230> this<00:00:43.379> button<00:00:43.620> it<00:00:44.040> goes<00:00:44.570> like<00:00:45.570> that<00:00:46.430> okay

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:47.510 
press this button it goes like that okay

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:52.819 
press this button it goes like that okay
so<00:00:48.510> this<00:00:49.440> is<00:00:49.620> still<00:00:49.710> switchblade<00:00:50.280> yes<00:00:51.469> it<00:00:52.469> is

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
so this is still switchblade yes it is

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.569 
so this is still switchblade yes it is
still<00:00:53.039> useful<00:00:53.420> not<00:00:54.420> for<00:00:54.629> everyone<00:00:54.809> now<00:00:55.739> I've

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.849 
still useful not for everyone now I've
just<00:00:57.030> about<00:00:57.149> got<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.510> timing<00:00:57.750> down<00:00:58.050> see<00:00:58.710> if<00:00:58.739> I

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
just about got the timing down see if I

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.869 
just about got the timing down see if I
can<00:00:59.010> do<00:00:59.100> this<00:00:59.219> correctly<00:01:01.280> see<00:01:02.280> how<00:01:02.609> is<00:01:02.760> that

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
can do this correctly see how is that

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.149
