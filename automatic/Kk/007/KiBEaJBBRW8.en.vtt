00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
like go to the library and then we to

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.390 
like go to the library and then we to
the<00:01:02.670> dogs<00:01:02.940> all<00:01:03.449> you<00:01:03.750> have<00:01:03.930> to<00:01:04.080> do<00:01:04.229> is<00:01:04.500> look<00:01:05.309> at

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
the dogs all you have to do is look at

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.100 
the dogs all you have to do is look at
the<00:01:05.460> data<00:01:05.700> okay<00:01:06.600> and<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:07.200> data<00:01:07.500> shows<00:01:07.920> that

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110 
the data okay and the data shows that

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.870 
the data okay and the data shows that
fluency<00:01:10.110> goes<00:01:10.380> up<00:01:10.619> when<00:01:11.040> kids<00:01:11.340> re<00:01:11.460> to<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:11.610> dogs

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
fluency goes up when kids re to the dogs

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.000 
fluency goes up when kids re to the dogs
plain<00:01:12.540> and<00:01:12.689> simple<00:01:12.750> one<00:01:13.409> of<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.650> difficulties

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
plain and simple one of the difficulties

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.090 
plain and simple one of the difficulties
with<00:01:14.460> children<00:01:15.000> is<00:01:15.330> that<00:01:16.200> they<00:01:16.380> often<00:01:16.650> look<00:01:16.950> at

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
with children is that they often look at

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.630 
with children is that they often look at
reading<00:01:17.490> as<00:01:17.640> something<00:01:18.090> that's<00:01:18.240> work<00:01:19.640> this

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
reading as something that's work this

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.600 
reading as something that's work this
gives<00:01:20.880> them<00:01:21.000> an<00:01:21.150> opportunity<00:01:21.240> I<00:01:21.840> think<00:01:21.960> to

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
gives them an opportunity I think to

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:25.940 
gives them an opportunity I think to
read<00:01:23.610> make<00:01:24.450> it<00:01:24.570> more<00:01:24.750> fun<00:01:25.049> it's<00:01:25.619> kind<00:01:25.799> of<00:01:25.860> a

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
read make it more fun it's kind of a

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.190 
read make it more fun it's kind of a
safe<00:01:26.189> environment<00:01:26.580> and<00:01:27.119> I<00:01:27.930> guess

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
safe environment and I guess

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.810 
safe environment and I guess
particularly<00:01:28.740> with<00:01:28.860> with<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.250> group<00:01:29.430> of

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
particularly with with the group of

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.660 
particularly with with the group of
children<00:01:30.630> that<00:01:30.840> we<00:01:31.049> had<00:01:31.320> where<00:01:32.310> English<00:01:32.640> is

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
children that we had where English is

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.460 
children that we had where English is
their<00:01:32.909> second<00:01:33.299> language<00:01:33.420> that's<00:01:33.930> it<00:01:34.079> that's

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
their second language that's it that's

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.859 
their second language that's it that's
even<00:01:34.799> more<00:01:34.829> important<00:01:35.490> there<00:01:36.360> sometimes<00:01:36.720> i

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
even more important there sometimes i

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.020 
even more important there sometimes i
stumbleupon<00:01:37.259> words<00:01:37.770> but<00:01:38.100> sometimes<00:01:38.729> is

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
stumbleupon words but sometimes is

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.789 
stumbleupon words but sometimes is
easier<00:01:39.360> when<00:01:39.570> i<00:01:39.600> read<00:01:39.869> to<00:01:40.049> it<00:01:40.170> a<00:01:40.200> person<00:01:40.680> that

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
easier when i read to it a person that

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.730 
easier when i read to it a person that
doesn't<00:01:41.040> judge<00:01:41.340> me<00:01:41.600> it's<00:01:42.600> a<00:01:42.780> very<00:01:43.049> special

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
doesn't judge me it's a very special

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.450 
doesn't judge me it's a very special
kind<00:01:43.770> of<00:01:44.250> work<00:01:44.490> to<00:01:44.790> do<00:01:44.939> when<00:01:45.869> you<00:01:46.200> see<00:01:46.710> what
