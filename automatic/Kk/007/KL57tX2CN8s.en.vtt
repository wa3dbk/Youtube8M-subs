00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 good morning this is a video tutorial 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:07.649
 where are we going to learn to configure 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.840
 correctly a tablet with a case 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:13.500
 in this case a case with keyboard with 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:16.170
 the by means of microusb cable for it 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.359
 let's use a tablet a bq 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.710
 second generation edition and how 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.710
 we see with microusb connection 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:28.970
 It should be noted that normally tablets 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:30.490
 factory usually come with the keyboard 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.830
 configured with the international language 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:37.090
 what does this mean when we 

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:40.190
 we connect the case directly 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:42.800
 directly we will detect the 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:45.500
 keyboard but when they open we open by 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:48.770
 example the address bar and 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:51.140
 we press the letter eñe because the normal thing is 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:52.840
 that I see a semicolon worth in 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.550
 this case I already have it set 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:59.720
 how are we going to configure it, it is very 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:02.360
 simple as we have indicated with the 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:05.280
 properly connected tablet we are going to 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:07.900
 access the settings menu 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:11.170
 inside the settings menu 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:14.490
 let's submenu in the left bar 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:18.010
 which is called language and text entry 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:21.340
 we access when we have connected 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:25.030
 physically the keyboard is going to leave me 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:26.890
 menu that is called physical keyboard is worth 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.410
 I did not have it connected this menu was not 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:32.890
 would appear in this case let's click 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:36.640
 here sonics usb key word and we are going to 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:38.560
 configure keyboard layouts we press and 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.440
 This is where all of me will appear 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.720
 the languages ​​available for 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:46.810
 external keyboards as we see we have 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:49.000
 activated in this case the keyboard in 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:52.930
 spanish in spanish 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:56.890
 to see how it works we go to the menu 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:02:00.580
 let's see an address bar and 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:04.510
 here we have our qwerty keyboard with 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:08.550

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:08.550
