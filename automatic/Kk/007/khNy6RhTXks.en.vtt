 ericsson vivaz 

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:20.269
 mines 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.960
 the device looks very unusual 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.210
 especially strings 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.449
 the body is entirely plastic side 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:28.000
 faces interestingly shimmer on 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.199
 holy unusual decision 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:31.570
 the lens is originally located 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:32.860
 cameras 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.390
 assembly is not a bad thing 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:36.420
 creaking 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.130
 the back cover is firmly fixed removal 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:40.600
 no easy task 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.020
 connectors are located on the side face 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.590
 it's not clear why I needed 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:47.040
 plugs wings beaten she looks 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.260
 countries are alien and spoil it became 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.350
 interesting design 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.640
 looks like the top five slim body 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.100
 unusual shape attracts attention and 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.790
 easy to use 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:00.790
 cm 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.469
 smartphone running symbian 9 4 

00:01:04.469 --> 00:01:07.460
 interface is the same as sony ericsson website 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.540
 several desktops have different 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.330
 appointments favorite contacts and applications 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.690
 latest snapshots and videos 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.690
 you can turn it off if you want 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.780
 interface theme also 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.270
 differ from standard best 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.080
 side well or is it good interface for 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.590
 multimedia property or 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.710
 grandchildren 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:31.500
 Internet browser is not bad but 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.760
 significantly inferior to mobile safari or 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:34.540
 chromium 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.130
 built-in camera allows you to do 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:38.590
 good discounts but only with good 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:39.580
 illuminated 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.440
 the possibility of capacious and wait for the video 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:43.810
 in general, is the functionality 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:45.829
 typical of symbian devices 

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:48.640
 there is improvement but they are insignificant 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.330
 but ergonomics are not going smoothly 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.800
 unlock the phone with the button after 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.580
 what else do you need to hold the inscription on 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:55.440
 display 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.440
 the reverse process is also too long 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.870
 resistive screens always work 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:02.130
 adequately 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.710
 when typing the keyboard is not 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:05.670
 stops automatically different 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:06.380
 modes 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:07.930
 in lists not dynamic 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:10.149
 scroll 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:13.149
 m 

00:02:13.779 --> 00:02:15.419
 thanks to an interesting design 

00:02:15.419 --> 00:02:17.459
 sony ericsson vivaz will surely find his 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:18.389
 buyers 

00:02:18.389 --> 00:02:20.929
 its faults are rather faults 

00:02:20.929 --> 00:02:22.389
 yourself in general 

00:02:22.389 --> 00:02:24.349
 and the fan in this platform they are not 

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:24.700
 will stop
