00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:23.030 
and here is the discus there's a nice
tender<00:04:20.519> I<00:04:20.700> think<00:04:20.910> that's<00:04:21.209> the<00:04:21.359> snakeskin<00:04:22.040> yep

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:23.040 
tender I think that's the snakeskin yep

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:25.970 
tender I think that's the snakeskin yep
it's<00:04:23.250> the<00:04:23.400> snakeskin<00:04:24.020> your<00:04:25.020> kind<00:04:25.230> of<00:04:25.320> color

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:25.980 
it's the snakeskin your kind of color

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:27.680 
it's the snakeskin your kind of color
kind<00:04:26.639> of<00:04:26.730> gone<00:04:26.880> but<00:04:27.120> that's<00:04:27.270> because<00:04:27.419> they've

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 
kind of gone but that's because they've

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:30.379 
kind of gone but that's because they've
been<00:04:27.900> stressed<00:04:28.290> so<00:04:28.620> they'll<00:04:29.010> come<00:04:29.220> on<00:04:29.430> and

00:04:30.379 --> 00:04:30.389 
been stressed so they'll come on and

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:33.470 
been stressed so they'll come on and
then<00:04:30.780> this<00:04:30.990> is<00:04:31.260> probably<00:04:31.669> the<00:04:32.669> turquoise<00:04:33.120> of<00:04:33.389> a

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:33.480 
then this is probably the turquoise of a

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:40.640 
then this is probably the turquoise of a
pigeon<00:04:34.020> blood<00:04:34.430> and<00:04:35.540> then<00:04:38.900> here<00:04:39.900> is<00:04:40.169> my

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:40.650 
pigeon blood and then here is my

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:42.230 
pigeon blood and then here is my
favorite<00:04:41.220> and<00:04:41.430> I<00:04:41.460> think<00:04:41.669> this<00:04:41.760> is<00:04:41.880> the<00:04:41.970> pigeon

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 
favorite and I think this is the pigeon

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:54.590 
favorite and I think this is the pigeon
blood<00:04:42.919> so<00:04:43.919> I<00:04:43.950> think<00:04:44.700> God<00:04:46.490> again<00:04:48.320> yes<00:04:50.330> so
