00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219

and<00:00:38.850> gain<00:00:39.030> down<00:00:39.360> on<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:39.719> amp<00:00:39.930> but<00:00:40.590> I've<00:00:40.710> got<00:00:40.920> it

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
and gain down on the amp but I've got it

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.670

200 watts

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.490 
200 watts
obviously<00:00:45.239> that's<00:00:45.420> more<00:00:45.690> power<00:00:45.960> than<00:00:46.289> most

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
obviously that's more power than most
