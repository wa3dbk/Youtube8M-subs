00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
suture boards and that's always a

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.619 
suture boards and that's always a
popular<00:00:37.920> one<00:00:38.040> we<00:00:38.730> have<00:00:38.820> an<00:00:38.910> x-ray<00:00:39.149> station

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
popular one we have an x-ray station

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:40.459 
popular one we have an x-ray station
where<00:00:39.780> they're<00:00:39.870> gonna<00:00:39.960> look<00:00:40.140> at<00:00:40.230> a<00:00:40.290> bunch<00:00:40.410> of

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
where they're gonna look at a bunch of

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.590 
where they're gonna look at a bunch of
different<00:00:40.530> x-rays<00:00:41.010> that<00:00:41.160> we<00:00:41.280> see<00:00:41.489> during<00:00:42.450> our

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
different x-rays that we see during our

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.479 
different x-rays that we see during our
clinical<00:00:42.930> skills<00:00:43.170> labs<00:00:43.410> we<00:00:44.040> have<00:00:44.129> an<00:00:44.219> organ

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
clinical skills labs we have an organ

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:45.740 
clinical skills labs we have an organ
station<00:00:44.879> so<00:00:45.030> it<00:00:45.120> kind<00:00:45.239> of<00:00:45.270> gives<00:00:45.360> a<00:00:45.510> little<00:00:45.600> bit

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
station so it kind of gives a little bit

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.090 
station so it kind of gives a little bit
of<00:00:45.840> a<00:00:45.870> taste<00:00:46.050> of<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.350> anatomy<00:00:46.710> that<00:00:46.739> we<00:00:46.920> have

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
of a taste of the anatomy that we have

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.920 
of a taste of the anatomy that we have
and<00:00:48.090> then<00:00:48.180> we<00:00:48.239> just<00:00:48.360> give<00:00:48.510> them<00:00:48.600> a<00:00:48.629> tour<00:00:48.809> of<00:00:48.840> the

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
and then we just give them a tour of the

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.029 
and then we just give them a tour of the
school<00:00:49.140> let<00:00:49.350> me<00:00:49.440> see<00:00:49.559> everything<00:00:49.770> that<00:00:49.980> we

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
school let me see everything that we

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.040 
school let me see everything that we
have<00:00:50.219> maybe<00:00:51.149> just<00:00:51.210> try<00:00:51.539> to<00:00:51.600> flare<00:00:51.840> up<00:00:51.870> their

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
have maybe just try to flare up their

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.569 
have maybe just try to flare up their
interest<00:00:52.230> and<00:00:52.559> then<00:00:52.649> once<00:00:52.770> you<00:00:52.860> come<00:00:53.039> I<00:00:53.340> think

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
interest and then once you come I think

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:54.619 
interest and then once you come I think
it's<00:00:53.670> really<00:00:53.820> important<00:00:54.210> for<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.510> high

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
it's really important for the high

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.299 
it's really important for the high
school<00:00:54.809> student<00:00:55.110> who<00:00:55.350> might<00:00:55.770> have<00:00:56.039> interest

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
school student who might have interest

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.069 
school student who might have interest
in<00:00:56.460> medicine<00:00:56.879> to<00:00:57.090> feel<00:00:57.329> it<00:00:57.480> out<00:00:57.570> a<00:00:57.629> little<00:00:57.809> bit

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
in medicine to feel it out a little bit

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.810 
in medicine to feel it out a little bit
more<00:00:58.289> and<00:00:58.500> figure<00:00:59.039> out<00:00:59.100> that's<00:00:59.340> really<00:00:59.579> what

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
more and figure out that's really what

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.459 
more and figure out that's really what
they<00:00:59.940> want<00:01:00.180> to<00:01:00.359> do<00:01:00.510> and<00:01:01.050> I<00:01:01.109> think<00:01:01.170> this<00:01:01.320> is<00:01:01.440> a

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
they want to do and I think this is a

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.470 
they want to do and I think this is a
perfect<00:01:01.739> place<00:01:02.370> to<00:01:02.430> get<00:01:02.640> a<00:01:02.699> little<00:01:02.910> bit<00:01:03.149> of<00:01:03.359> a

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
perfect place to get a little bit of a

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.810 
perfect place to get a little bit of a
taste<00:01:04.170> of<00:01:04.409> what<00:01:04.470> it's<00:01:04.680> like<00:01:04.769> and<00:01:05.129> then<00:01:05.549> if<00:01:05.700> they

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
taste of what it's like and then if they

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.550 
taste of what it's like and then if they
are<00:01:06.000> interested<00:01:06.510> then<00:01:06.810> they<00:01:06.930> have<00:01:07.110> a<00:01:07.140> lot<00:01:07.530> more

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
are interested then they have a lot more

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.890 
are interested then they have a lot more
opportunity<00:01:08.369> early<00:01:08.760> on<00:01:08.909> to<00:01:09.180> get<00:01:09.299> involved<00:01:09.780> and

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
opportunity early on to get involved and

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:10.940 
opportunity early on to get involved and
have<00:01:09.990> a<00:01:10.049> little<00:01:10.229> more<00:01:10.470> hands-on<00:01:10.799> experience

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950
