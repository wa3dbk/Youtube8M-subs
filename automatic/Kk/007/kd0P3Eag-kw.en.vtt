investigating ways in which we can
create<00:00:31.919> artificial<00:00:32.399> load<00:00:33.260> we<00:00:34.260> could<00:00:34.470> use<00:00:34.650> it

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
create artificial load we could use it

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.380 
create artificial load we could use it
for<00:00:34.890> a<00:00:35.129> variety<00:00:35.309> of<00:00:35.519> different<00:00:35.699> applications

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
for a variety of different applications

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.390 
for a variety of different applications
implants<00:00:36.989> is<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.260> obvious<00:00:37.589> one<00:00:37.800> but<00:00:37.980> also<00:00:38.160> it

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:38.400 
implants is the obvious one but also it

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.009 
implants is the obvious one but also it
can<00:00:38.550> be<00:00:38.640> used<00:00:38.850> as<00:00:39.059> in<00:00:39.239> material<00:00:39.660> on<00:00:39.720> buildings

00:00:42.009 --> 00:00:42.019 
can be used as in material on buildings

00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:44.210 
can be used as in material on buildings
so<00:00:43.019> in<00:00:43.110> order<00:00:43.350> to<00:00:43.470> make<00:00:43.650> the<00:00:43.829> boat<00:00:43.980> like

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:44.220 
so in order to make the boat like

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:46.819 
so in order to make the boat like
substance<00:00:44.730> you<00:00:44.909> take<00:00:45.120> a<00:00:45.150> sample<00:00:45.540> and<00:00:45.930> then<00:00:46.620> you

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
substance you take a sample and then you

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.470 
substance you take a sample and then you
dip<00:00:47.040> it<00:00:47.190> into<00:00:47.430> what<00:00:47.579> beaker<00:00:47.909> which<00:00:48.089> contains

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
dip it into what beaker which contains

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.049 
dip it into what beaker which contains
calcium<00:00:48.809> and<00:00:49.350> protein<00:00:49.559> you<00:00:50.400> then<00:00:50.580> rinse<00:00:50.790> it<00:00:50.909> in

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
calcium and protein you then rinse it in

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.579 
calcium and protein you then rinse it in
some<00:00:51.269> water<00:00:51.449> and<00:00:51.809> then<00:00:52.019> you<00:00:52.199> dip<00:00:52.379> it<00:00:52.500> again

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:52.589 
some water and then you dip it again

00:00:52.589 --> 00:00:53.780 
some water and then you dip it again
into<00:00:52.890> another<00:00:53.250> beaker<00:00:53.610> that<00:00:53.640> contains

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:53.790 
into another beaker that contains

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:56.179 
into another beaker that contains
phosphate<00:00:54.659> and<00:00:54.930> protein<00:00:55.260> and<00:00:55.409> you<00:00:55.589> do<00:00:55.799> it<00:00:55.949> over

00:00:56.179 --> 00:00:56.189 
phosphate and protein and you do it over

00:00:56.189 --> 00:00:59.509 
phosphate and protein and you do it over
and<00:00:56.549> over<00:00:56.670> and<00:00:56.939> over<00:00:57.330> again<00:00:58.070> when<00:00:59.070> I<00:00:59.100> started

00:00:59.509 --> 00:00:59.519 
and over and over again when I started

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:01.250 
and over and over again when I started
the<00:00:59.580> project<00:00:59.760> I<00:01:00.059> started<00:01:00.449> thinking<00:01:00.750> about<00:01:00.839> how

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
the project I started thinking about how

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:08.560 
the project I started thinking about how
we<00:01:01.290> could<00:01:01.680> actually<00:01:01.830> automate<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.640> process

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.570 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:10.789 

there<00:01:09.570> are<00:01:09.659> variety<00:01:10.049> ways<00:01:10.200> you<00:01:10.409> can<00:01:10.560> automate

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
there are variety ways you can automate

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.100 
there are variety ways you can automate
you<00:01:10.950> can<00:01:11.070> buy<00:01:11.310> very<00:01:11.880> very<00:01:12.090> expensive<00:01:12.390> kit<00:01:12.900> off

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
you can buy very very expensive kit off

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.230 
you can buy very very expensive kit off
the<00:01:13.350> shelf<00:01:13.590> but<00:01:13.979> Lego<00:01:14.369> seemed<00:01:14.670> like<00:01:14.880> the

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
the shelf but Lego seemed like the

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.899 
the shelf but Lego seemed like the
simplest<00:01:15.600> way<00:01:16.189> the<00:01:17.189> great<00:01:17.400> thing<00:01:17.580> about<00:01:17.610> the

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
simplest way the great thing about the

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.399 
simplest way the great thing about the
robots<00:01:18.270> is<00:01:18.450> that<00:01:18.600> once<00:01:18.780> you<00:01:18.869> tell<00:01:19.080> them<00:01:19.259> what

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
robots is that once you tell them what

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:19.969 
robots is that once you tell them what
to<00:01:19.560> do

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
to do

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.370 
to do
they<00:01:20.220> can<00:01:20.400> just<00:01:20.579> do<00:01:20.700> it<00:01:20.850> very<00:01:20.969> precisely<00:01:21.450> over

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
they can just do it very precisely over

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.529 
they can just do it very precisely over
and<00:01:22.560> over<00:01:22.799> again<00:01:22.920> so<00:01:23.340> a<00:01:23.670> day<00:01:23.909> later<00:01:24.179> you<00:01:24.299> can

00:01:24.529 --> 00:01:24.539 
and over again so a day later you can

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:44.460 
and over again so a day later you can
come<00:01:24.570> back<00:01:24.960> and<00:01:25.320> see<00:01:26.100> a<00:01:26.399> fully<00:01:27.149> made<00:01:27.420> soundly

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:46.390 

research<00:01:45.470> is<00:01:45.620> a<00:01:45.650> funny<00:01:45.950> thing

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:46.400 
research is a funny thing

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.070 
research is a funny thing
because<00:01:46.670> you<00:01:46.820> might<00:01:47.030> think<00:01:47.060> that<00:01:47.420> we<00:01:47.690> order

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:48.080 
because you might think that we order

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:49.390 
because you might think that we order
everything<00:01:48.560> up<00:01:48.680> out<00:01:48.860> of<00:01:49.010> scientific

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:49.400 
everything up out of scientific

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.310 
everything up out of scientific
catalogues<00:01:50.060> but<00:01:50.300> actually<00:01:50.720> a<00:01:50.780> lot<00:01:51.050> of<00:01:51.229> the

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 
catalogues but actually a lot of the

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:52.900 
catalogues but actually a lot of the
things<00:01:51.560> that<00:01:51.740> we<00:01:51.860> use<00:01:52.040> around<00:01:52.280> the<00:01:52.460> lab<00:01:52.640> our

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:52.910 
things that we use around the lab our

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:55.030 
things that we use around the lab our
household<00:01:53.600> items<00:01:53.930> things<00:01:54.229> we<00:01:54.380> picked<00:01:54.710> up<00:01:54.830> at

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:55.040 
household items things we picked up at

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.790 
household items things we picked up at
the<00:01:55.160> local<00:01:55.370> home<00:01:55.910> goods<00:01:56.180> store<00:01:56.600> and<00:01:56.990> so<00:01:57.380> our

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:57.800 
the local home goods store and so our

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.510 
the local home goods store and so our
robots<00:01:58.370> just<00:01:58.640> fit<00:01:59.060> in<00:01:59.210> with<00:01:59.420> that<00:01:59.450> mindset

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 
robots just fit in with that mindset

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.830 
robots just fit in with that mindset
it's<00:02:01.520> really<00:02:01.820> exciting<00:02:02.150> to<00:02:02.450> come<00:02:02.600> up<00:02:02.720> with

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
it's really exciting to come up with

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.570 
it's really exciting to come up with
something<00:02:03.140> new<00:02:03.170> a<00:02:03.290> lot<00:02:03.560> of<00:02:03.710> science<00:02:04.160> you're

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:04.580 
something new a lot of science you're

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:06.850 
something new a lot of science you're
continuously<00:02:05.180> trying<00:02:05.540> things<00:02:05.869> and<00:02:06.200> some<00:02:06.770> of

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 
continuously trying things and some of

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.169 
continuously trying things and some of
the<00:02:06.920> time<00:02:07.070> they<00:02:07.250> don't<00:02:07.369> work<00:02:07.580> so<00:02:07.610> it's<00:02:07.940> great

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
the time they don't work so it's great

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:10.900 
the time they don't work so it's great
when<00:02:08.390> something<00:02:08.810> just<00:02:08.840> leaps<00:02:09.500> ahead<00:02:09.910> the

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
when something just leaps ahead the

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:12.790 
when something just leaps ahead the
importance<00:02:11.360> in<00:02:11.600> science<00:02:12.110> is<00:02:12.230> the<00:02:12.350> creativity

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
importance in science is the creativity

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.340 
importance in science is the creativity
and<00:02:13.190> going<00:02:13.430> forward<00:02:13.850> it's<00:02:14.030> not<00:02:14.110> exactly<00:02:15.110> what

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
and going forward it's not exactly what
