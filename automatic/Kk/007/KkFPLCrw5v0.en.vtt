00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:17.630
 the hands 

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:19.519
 I still think someone might 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:23.960
 break through the door 

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:26.869
 alcohol probably doesn't help excuse i have 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:29.810
 forgot to introduce me real me 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:34.219
 call alex sartorius doctor alex 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:37.670
 sartorius I would say this beautiful 

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:39.230
 my confession 20 years ago I started 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:43.160
 in business with my friend and partner 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:45.350
 simons you business that makes me strange 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.789
 talk about 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.890
 I never wanted to have i 

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:51.530
 I wasn't interested in reflectors 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:54.410
 attention he was the man to do it 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.829
 steiger scientist prizes seems to me a 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:58.160
 nice name 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:01:00.170
 we also did a great job 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.870
 I forgot ruby ​​regardless of 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:05.239
 what the cure for the god will happen 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.740
 the study was our work and also 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:14.710
 treatment for the syndrome 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:14.710
 collier our way 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.100
 of course I've never been interested 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:19.700
 I never had the financial aspect 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.310
 need 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:26.090
 don't worry, ex told me 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:27.799
 Simon and I believed I already believed him 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.920
 until the day he told me that 

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:33.710
 by now we were on the street 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:37.430
 now of course I wonder if it was 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:39.040
 true you can blame me if he didn't 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:42.080
 asked I probably would have said no 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:48.009
 I'm not sensitive but if it wasn't 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:51.380
 sorry sorry I'm digressing true 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:54.740
 fault of underlying anxiety in 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:57.110
 brain I'm trying to say that 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:59.450
 day when we were out of money 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.990
 that day the contracts started 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.990
 for weapons 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:13.670
 hi yes yes 

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:15.980
 hi today i am in a better mood i have 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.360
 discovered a pharmaceutical cure against the 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.400
 paranoia 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.170
 just put the dc solos directly 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:28.550
 in the whiskey bottle and mix 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:33.050
 well then i stayed almost gvc weapons 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:35.600
 biological weapons what a wonder we are 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:37.100
 put into business to save people but 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:40.120
 we found out that killing her more 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:42.590
 profitable but not enough for simon 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:45.380
 that dress though if you do that gordon 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:48.050
 bastard for this stuff I'm not there 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:50.570
 many buyers or at least not 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:53.300
 legitimate so you have to be 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:55.190
 competitive but how do you do it 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.910
 quick searches when it is illegal to do 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:01.310
 experiments on humans is 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:05.680
 highly dangerous immoral highly 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:11.959
 risky and obvious you do 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:14.240
 however he never told me where 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:16.930
 they only arrive that no one 

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:16.930
 would have searched 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:25.250
 and says I look for forgiveness believe that 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:27.860
 this be desperate mea culpa I was 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:30.890
 Catholic but I preferred to science 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:34.970
 in the end this pathetic confession 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:37.310
 it's not about me, I kept my word 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:39.770
 I let it reduce to silence 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:42.350
 while working on my vaccine on mine 

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:44.570
 care therefore do not judge them 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:46.100
 whoever you are journalist level of 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:47.090
 gotha mere you listen to this 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:53.420
 registration 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:54.710
 no it doesn't concern me this and look at him is 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:56.360
 worsened 

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:58.040
 we are now a pharmaceutical company 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:00.740
 just names 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.210
 we produce some weapons for the army 

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:06.170
 many more for the people than the army 

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:07.970
 fights and now there is the scarecrow so 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:10.400
 what are they doing 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:12.800
 are taking my technology on 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.390
 my inoculation device and it 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:17.330
 tin turned into something 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:21.940
 something wrong is not 

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:25.790
 I will allow you not to lose an eye anymore 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:27.650
 this confession would be an epitaph 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:29.240
 proof that I am no longer willing to 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:32.060
 balance the good I did with the 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:34.010
 badly caused by him 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:35.840
 if you are listening to this race 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:38.320
 antonius the mister you want 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.320
 talk
