like gameplay and stuff like that

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:43.370 
like gameplay and stuff like that
they're<00:03:41.100> not<00:03:41.820> so<00:03:42.060> much<00:03:42.239> a<00:03:42.510> storage<00:03:43.019> of<00:03:43.109> maps

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
they're not so much a storage of maps

modeling<00:04:13.769> with<00:04:14.130> a<00:04:14.600> cubic<00:04:15.950> program<00:04:16.950> that<00:04:17.099> lets

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
modeling with a cubic program that lets

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.370 
modeling with a cubic program that lets
you<00:04:17.370> do<00:04:17.519> all<00:04:17.789> kind<00:04:17.970> of<00:04:18.030> minecraft<00:04:18.450> modeling<00:04:18.870> to

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
you do all kind of minecraft modeling to

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:20.270 
you do all kind of minecraft modeling to
make<00:04:19.500> custom<00:04:19.830> levels

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
make custom levels

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.069

and I've actually been considering
starting<00:04:23.070> maybe<00:04:23.520> some<00:04:23.910> daily<00:04:24.330> work<00:04:24.600> showing

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:25.350 
starting maybe some daily work showing

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:27.440 
starting maybe some daily work showing
the<00:04:25.470> modeling<00:04:26.190> process<00:04:26.220> and<00:04:26.880> putting<00:04:27.330> out

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.450 
the modeling process and putting out

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:28.670 
the modeling process and putting out
just<00:04:27.690> you<00:04:27.810> know<00:04:27.900> lots<00:04:28.170> of<00:04:28.320> different<00:04:28.560> models

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 
just you know lots of different models

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.590 
just you know lots of different models
for<00:04:28.980> people<00:04:29.220> to<00:04:29.310> download<00:04:29.460> new<00:04:30.090> silver<00:04:30.450> they'd

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:30.600 
for people to download new silver they'd

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.659 
for people to download new silver they'd
like<00:04:30.750> to<00:04:30.780> use<00:04:31.020> so<00:04:31.680> that's<00:04:32.070> a<00:04:32.400> heavy

really<00:05:24.690> bad<00:05:24.960> because<00:05:24.990> I<00:05:25.380> haven't<00:05:25.890> been<00:05:26.220> doing

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:26.430 
really bad because I haven't been doing

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:29.000 
really bad because I haven't been doing
anything<00:05:27.330> publicly<00:05:27.840> on<00:05:28.110> this<00:05:28.530> channel<00:05:28.770> I

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:29.010 
anything publicly on this channel I

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:31.070 
anything publicly on this channel I
really<00:05:29.970> did<00:05:30.090> end<00:05:30.270> up<00:05:30.390> switching<00:05:30.570> a<00:05:30.810> lot<00:05:30.960> over

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:31.080 
really did end up switching a lot over

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:33.110 
really did end up switching a lot over
to<00:05:31.380> the<00:05:31.650> voxel<00:05:31.979> boxes<00:05:32.280> channel<00:05:32.550> simply

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:33.120 
to the voxel boxes channel simply

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:36.230 
to the voxel boxes channel simply
because<00:05:33.479> it's<00:05:34.229> hard<00:05:34.860> to<00:05:35.130> maintain<00:05:35.340> to<00:05:35.910> channel

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:36.240 
because it's hard to maintain to channel

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.540 
because it's hard to maintain to channel
all<00:05:36.360> the<00:05:36.419> time<00:05:36.690> especially<00:05:37.320> with<00:05:37.890> like<00:05:37.950> the

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:38.550 
all the time especially with like the

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:41.570 
all the time especially with like the
workflow<00:05:38.880> that<00:05:38.910> I<00:05:39.150> have<00:05:39.360> um<00:05:39.800> if<00:05:40.800> you<00:05:40.979> guys<00:05:41.130> can

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:41.580 
workflow that I have um if you guys can

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:43.880 
workflow that I have um if you guys can
see<00:05:41.610> for<00:05:42.240> everything<00:05:42.630> it's<00:05:42.900> a<00:05:43.320> pretty<00:05:43.650> heavy

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:43.890 
see for everything it's a pretty heavy

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:47.150 
see for everything it's a pretty heavy
workload<00:05:44.400> and<00:05:44.789> it's<00:05:45.720> really<00:05:46.350> rough<00:05:46.620> like<00:05:46.890> even

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:47.160 
workload and it's really rough like even

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:49.520
