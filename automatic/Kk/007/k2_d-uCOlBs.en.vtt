I picked three players that I think will
be<00:00:12.360> a<00:00:12.540> good<00:00:12.809> addition<00:00:12.929> for<00:00:13.230> the<00:00:13.590> team<00:00:13.769> then<00:00:14.070> at

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
range is just a rough estimate based on

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.400 
range is just a rough estimate based on
what<00:00:35.460> their<00:00:35.579> start<00:00:35.850> site<00:00:36.059> currently<00:00:36.300> so<00:00:37.200> let's

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
what their start site currently so let's

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.110 
what their start site currently so let's
kick<00:00:37.620> off<00:00:37.770> let's<00:00:37.980> get<00:00:38.100> into<00:00:38.219> it<00:00:38.309> so<00:00:38.910> I'm<00:00:39.000> off

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
kick off let's get into it so I'm off

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.389 
kick off let's get into it so I'm off
with<00:00:39.300> chels<00:00:39.840> here<00:00:40.110> I've<00:00:40.379> picked<00:00:40.680> up<00:00:40.829> a<00:00:40.980> run<00:00:41.190> and

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
with chels here I've picked up a run and

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.160 
with chels here I've picked up a run and
the<00:00:41.489> reason<00:00:42.300> for<00:00:42.329> that<00:00:42.450> is<00:00:42.629> that<00:00:42.660> you<00:00:42.899> can<00:00:43.050> see

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
the reason for that is that you can see

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.200 
the reason for that is that you can see
he's<00:00:43.290> got<00:00:43.410> very<00:00:43.680> very<00:00:44.010> good<00:00:44.100> potential<00:00:44.489> and

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
he's got very very good potential and

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.850 
he's got very very good potential and
he's<00:00:45.329> very<00:00:45.420> very<00:00:45.570> young<00:00:45.930> so<00:00:45.960> viously<00:00:46.440> he<00:00:46.649> will

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
he's very very young so viously he will

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.010 
he's very very young so viously he will
grow<00:00:47.070> he's<00:00:47.280> already<00:00:47.460> in<00:00:47.610> 81<00:00:48.090> so<00:00:48.360> you<00:00:48.420> know<00:00:48.930> it's

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
grow he's already in 81 so you know it's

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.369 
grow he's already in 81 so you know it's
not<00:00:49.140> like<00:00:49.200> he's<00:00:49.410> dying<00:00:49.559> in<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.100> low<00:00:50.219> 70s<00:00:50.760> and

00:00:51.369 --> 00:00:51.379 
not like he's dying in the low 70s and

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:53.720 
not like he's dying in the low 70s and
so<00:00:52.379> you<00:00:52.530> know<00:00:52.829> I'm<00:00:52.949> sure<00:00:53.129> he'll<00:00:53.280> do<00:00:53.430> very<00:00:53.460> well

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
so you know I'm sure he'll do very well

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.880 
so you know I'm sure he'll do very well
he's<00:00:54.480> got<00:00:54.660> actually<00:00:55.050> very<00:00:55.289> good<00:00:55.440> pace<00:00:55.649> this

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
he's got actually very good pace this

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.130 
he's got actually very good pace this
year<00:00:56.100> he's<00:00:56.190> gone<00:00:56.340> up<00:00:56.489> from<00:00:56.730> 70<00:00:57.480> pace<00:00:57.660> last<00:00:57.960> year

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
year he's gone up from 70 pace last year

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.439 
year he's gone up from 70 pace last year
to<00:00:58.260> 76<00:00:58.800> as<00:00:58.980> you<00:00:59.039> can<00:00:59.190> see<00:00:59.340> there<00:00:59.609> and<00:01:00.120> his<00:01:00.270> high

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
to 76 as you can see there and his high

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:01.880 
to 76 as you can see there and his high
it's<00:01:00.600> pretty<00:01:00.780> good<00:01:00.899> too<00:01:01.109> which<00:01:01.260> is<00:01:01.289> important

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
it's pretty good too which is important

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.369 
it's pretty good too which is important
as<00:01:02.039> a<00:01:02.100> defender<00:01:02.579> alleys<00:01:03.030> of<00:01:03.059> course<00:01:03.510> as<00:01:03.809> you

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
as a defender alleys of course as you

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:05.990 
as a defender alleys of course as you
know<00:01:04.439> a<00:01:04.559> highly<00:01:05.070> right<00:01:05.159> sense<00:01:05.460> of<00:01:05.580> our<00:01:05.670> keys<00:01:05.880> is

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
know a highly right sense of our keys is

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.190 
know a highly right sense of our keys is
really<00:01:06.270> really<00:01:06.659> really<00:01:06.780> good<00:01:06.930> at<00:01:07.020> tackling

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
really really really good at tackling

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.310 
really really really good at tackling
and<00:01:07.619> I<00:01:08.549> think<00:01:08.850> it'd<00:01:08.939> be<00:01:08.970> available<00:01:09.390> 15<00:01:09.869> to<00:01:10.020> 20

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
and I think it'd be available 15 to 20

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.469 
and I think it'd be available 15 to 20
million<00:01:10.500> and<00:01:10.830> that's<00:01:11.729> if<00:01:11.939> you'll<00:01:12.090> in<00:01:12.210> first

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
million and that's if you'll in first

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:13.700 
million and that's if you'll in first
season<00:01:12.810> you<00:01:12.930> know<00:01:12.960> obviously<00:01:13.200> it's<00:01:13.530> going<00:01:13.560> to

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
season you know obviously it's going to

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.370 
season you know obviously it's going to
change<00:01:13.740> and<00:01:14.400> it<00:01:14.880> varies<00:01:15.390> from<00:01:15.509> pyramids<00:01:15.990> como

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
change and it varies from pyramids como

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.899 
change and it varies from pyramids como
but<00:01:16.619> roughly<00:01:16.979> within<00:01:17.189> that<00:01:17.460> price<00:01:17.700> range

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
but roughly within that price range

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.820 
but roughly within that price range
you'd<00:01:18.210> be<00:01:18.299> looking<00:01:18.450> at<00:01:18.750> and<00:01:19.409> you<00:01:19.590> might<00:01:19.740> be

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
you'd be looking at and you might be

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.109 
you'd be looking at and you might be
able<00:01:19.890> to<00:01:20.040> game<00:01:20.130> a<00:01:20.159> little<00:01:20.400> bit<00:01:20.490> more<00:01:20.700> could<00:01:21.060> be

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
able to game a little bit more could be

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.880 
able to game a little bit more could be
a<00:01:21.150> little<00:01:21.240> bit<00:01:21.390> more<00:01:21.479> expensive<00:01:21.720> but<00:01:22.020> yeah<00:01:22.860> I

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
a little bit more expensive but yeah I

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.499 
a little bit more expensive but yeah I
think<00:01:23.100> it'd<00:01:23.189> be<00:01:23.220> good<00:01:23.310> addition<00:01:23.820> just<00:01:24.270> because

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
think it'd be good addition just because

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.510 
think it'd be good addition just because
Terry<00:01:24.840> although<00:01:25.560> he's<00:01:25.680> great<00:01:26.009> and<00:01:26.189> I<00:01:26.250> love

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
Terry although he's great and I love

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.539 
Terry although he's great and I love
them<00:01:27.259> he's<00:01:28.259> overall<00:01:28.710> and<00:01:28.860> FIFA<00:01:29.159> means<00:01:29.340> that<00:01:29.490> he

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
them he's overall and FIFA means that he

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:30.980 
them he's overall and FIFA means that he
starts<00:01:29.909> go<00:01:30.030> down<00:01:30.180> really<00:01:30.360> quickly<00:01:30.630> and<00:01:30.869> he's

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
starts go down really quickly and he's

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.359 
starts go down really quickly and he's
not<00:01:31.140> very<00:01:31.290> good<00:01:31.500> so<00:01:31.530> I<00:01:31.710> think<00:01:31.829> you<00:01:31.979> need<00:01:32.130> a<00:01:32.159> back

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
not very good so I think you need a back

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.219 
not very good so I think you need a back
backup<00:01:33.000> center<00:01:33.299> back<00:01:33.509> and<00:01:33.720> then<00:01:33.810> put<00:01:34.020> him<00:01:34.110> in

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
backup center back and then put him in

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.020 
backup center back and then put him in
Irish<00:01:34.710> things<00:01:34.950> he<00:01:35.100> was<00:01:35.220> not<00:01:35.520> quite<00:01:35.790> there<00:01:36.000> yet

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
Irish things he was not quite there yet

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.300 
Irish things he was not quite there yet
let's<00:01:36.479> take<00:01:36.659> terry<00:01:36.950> generally<00:01:37.950> for<00:01:38.070> me<00:01:38.159> by

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
let's take terry generally for me by

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.030 
let's take terry generally for me by
january<00:01:38.700> really<00:01:39.090> low<00:01:39.240> overall<00:01:39.509> so<00:01:39.960> I<00:01:40.259> don't

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
january really low overall so I don't

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.170 
january really low overall so I don't
someone<00:01:41.250> to<00:01:41.340> put<00:01:41.460> in<00:01:41.549> straight<00:01:41.790> away<00:01:41.820> and<00:01:42.030> that

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
someone to put in straight away and that

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.270 
someone to put in straight away and that
would<00:01:42.299> be<00:01:42.329> front<00:01:42.750> moving<00:01:43.350> on<00:01:43.560> Paul<00:01:43.920> Pogba

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
would be front moving on Paul Pogba

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.889 
would be front moving on Paul Pogba
someone<00:01:44.790> I've<00:01:45.000> picked<00:01:45.270> for<00:01:45.479> a<00:01:45.509> national<00:01:45.869> one

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
someone I've picked for a national one

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.139 
someone I've picked for a national one
as<00:01:46.079> well<00:01:46.369> the<00:01:47.369> reason<00:01:47.549> for<00:01:47.579> this<00:01:47.700> is<00:01:47.790> that<00:01:47.939> he's

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
as well the reason for this is that he's

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.260 
as well the reason for this is that he's
growth<00:01:48.360> incredibly<00:01:48.930> high<00:01:49.079> just<00:01:49.470> like<00:01:50.090> for<00:01:51.090> run

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
growth incredibly high just like for run

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.420 
growth incredibly high just like for run
there<00:01:51.509> and<00:01:51.750> obviously<00:01:52.619> it's<00:01:53.009> very<00:01:53.159> young<00:01:53.399> so

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
there and obviously it's very young so

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.609 
there and obviously it's very young so
although<00:01:53.850> he<00:01:54.180> does<00:01:54.420> cost<00:01:54.720> a<00:01:54.840> lot<00:01:54.960> of<00:01:55.020> money<00:01:55.110> and

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
although he does cost a lot of money and

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.410 
although he does cost a lot of money and
his<00:01:55.890> cost<00:01:56.100> per<00:01:56.219> season<00:01:56.399> will<00:01:56.790> be<00:01:56.939> very<00:01:57.149> low<00:01:57.360> you

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
his cost per season will be very low you

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:58.670 
his cost per season will be very low you
know<00:01:57.540> you<00:01:57.659> can<00:01:57.810> keep<00:01:57.960> him<00:01:58.110> through<00:01:58.290> the<00:01:58.350> 10

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
know you can keep him through the 10

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.319 
know you can keep him through the 10
seasons<00:01:59.189> and<00:01:59.340> he'll<00:01:59.460> still<00:01:59.670> be<00:01:59.820> an<00:02:00.030> excellent

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
seasons and he'll still be an excellent

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.630 
seasons and he'll still be an excellent
player<00:02:00.630> and<00:02:00.950> there<00:02:01.950> wasn't<00:02:02.100> even<00:02:02.250> a<00:02:02.399> star

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
player and there wasn't even a star

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.160 
player and there wasn't even a star
could<00:02:02.820> pick<00:02:02.969> out<00:02:03.119> he's<00:02:03.450> absolutely

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
could pick out he's absolutely

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.840 
could pick out he's absolutely
incredible<00:02:04.770> every<00:02:05.070> single<00:02:05.250> query<00:02:05.520> mode<00:02:05.700> that

I've<00:02:05.969> done<00:02:06.240> at<00:02:06.869> some<00:02:07.320> point<00:02:07.649> I've<00:02:07.920> at<00:02:08.399> least

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
I've done at some point I've at least

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.070 
I've done at some point I've at least
thought<00:02:08.819> about<00:02:08.879> buying<00:02:09.239> Pogba<00:02:09.720> because<00:02:09.959> he's

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
thought about buying Pogba because he's

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.170 
thought about buying Pogba because he's
just<00:02:10.410> that<00:02:10.619> good<00:02:10.679> you<00:02:11.520> can<00:02:11.700> fit<00:02:11.849> into<00:02:11.970> almost

to athletico the reason I'm thinking him

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:31.280 
to athletico the reason I'm thinking him
is<00:03:29.040> because<00:03:29.250> Drogba<00:03:29.850> again<00:03:30.299> like<00:03:30.480> Terry<00:03:30.780> he's

and cost will get very very tired and by
that<00:03:45.930> time<00:03:45.989> drop<00:03:46.530> was<00:03:46.680> overall<00:03:46.980> and

that time drop was overall and

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:48.770 
that time drop was overall and
everything<00:03:47.370> we<00:03:47.489> drop<00:03:47.700> in<00:03:47.880> so<00:03:48.389> he<00:03:48.450> could<00:03:48.690> be

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
everything we drop in so he could be

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:50.900 
everything we drop in so he could be
someone<00:03:48.930> great<00:03:49.200> to<00:03:49.560> go<00:03:49.680> get<00:03:49.889> in<00:03:49.980> January<00:03:50.400> and

someone great to go get in January and

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:52.340 
someone great to go get in January and
will<00:03:51.060> be<00:03:51.150> an<00:03:51.239> excellent<00:03:51.450> backup<00:03:51.810> available

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.350 
will be an excellent backup available

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:54.650 
will be an excellent backup available
for<00:03:52.440> about<00:03:52.590> 15<00:03:52.950> to<00:03:52.980> 20<00:03:53.220> million<00:03:53.639> he's<00:03:54.510> a<00:03:54.540> bit

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
for about 15 to 20 million he's a bit

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.180 
for about 15 to 20 million he's a bit
cheaper<00:03:55.079> side<00:03:55.260> for<00:03:55.590> strike<00:03:55.799> because<00:03:55.950> you<00:03:56.100> know

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
cheaper side for strike because you know

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:57.500 
cheaper side for strike because you know
a<00:03:56.220> lot<00:03:56.549> of<00:03:56.609> strike<00:03:56.880> because<00:03:56.970> the<00:03:57.120> top<00:03:57.329> top

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
a lot of strike because the top top

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:58.729 
a lot of strike because the top top
quality<00:03:57.780> ones<00:03:58.019> will<00:03:58.109> cost<00:03:58.260> you<00:03:58.380> a<00:03:58.440> lot<00:03:58.590> of

00:03:58.729 --> 00:03:58.739 
quality ones will cost you a lot of

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:00.500 
quality ones will cost you a lot of
money<00:03:58.859> so<00:03:59.069> that<00:03:59.519> means<00:03:59.940> a<00:03:59.970> little<00:04:00.030> bit<00:04:00.209> cheaper

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
money so that means a little bit cheaper

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.150 
money so that means a little bit cheaper
option<00:04:00.810> and<00:04:00.989> I<00:04:01.290> think<00:04:01.470> that's<00:04:01.590> a<00:04:01.680> pretty<00:04:01.950> good

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
option and I think that's a pretty good

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.190 
option and I think that's a pretty good
price<00:04:02.280> for<00:04:02.400> a<00:04:02.639> backup<00:04:02.819> of<00:04:03.060> this<00:04:03.239> quality<00:04:03.450> so

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
price for a backup of this quality so

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.479 
price for a backup of this quality so
moving<00:04:04.440> on<00:04:04.530> to<00:04:04.709> the<00:04:04.739> team<00:04:05.130> that<00:04:05.160> you<00:04:05.340> could

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:05.489 
moving on to the team that you could

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:08.449 
moving on to the team that you could
possibly<00:04:05.519> play<00:04:06.150> with<00:04:06.450> this<00:04:06.630> and<00:04:06.980> as<00:04:07.980> you<00:04:08.370> can

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459 
possibly play with this and as you can

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:10.129 
possibly play with this and as you can
see<00:04:08.489> I've<00:04:08.670> just<00:04:08.760> come<00:04:08.880> for<00:04:09.000> the<00:04:09.060> 43<00:04:09.690> one<00:04:09.840> just

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:10.139 
see I've just come for the 43 one just

00:04:10.139 --> 00:04:13.550 
see I've just come for the 43 one just
because<00:04:10.260> I<00:04:10.739> think<00:04:11.430> that<00:04:11.609> that<00:04:11.639> that<00:04:12.150> is<00:04:12.560> going

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
because I think that that that is going

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.740 
because I think that that that is going
to<00:04:14.489> be<00:04:14.579> the<00:04:14.730> one<00:04:14.850> that<00:04:14.970> we<00:04:15.090> most<00:04:15.239> successful

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
to be the one that we most successful

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:19.069 
to be the one that we most successful
with<00:04:15.870> these<00:04:16.019> players<00:04:17.630> by<00:04:18.630> the<00:04:18.690> way<00:04:18.810> I<00:04:18.840> know

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:19.079 
with these players by the way I know

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:20.629 
with these players by the way I know
Terry<00:04:19.350> is<00:04:19.470> not<00:04:19.590> in<00:04:19.709> this<00:04:19.859> squad<00:04:20.190> but<00:04:20.519> the

00:04:20.629 --> 00:04:20.639 
Terry is not in this squad but the

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:22.099 
Terry is not in this squad but the
reason<00:04:20.789> for<00:04:21.030> that<00:04:21.060> is<00:04:21.180> just<00:04:21.539> that<00:04:21.690> I<00:04:21.750> think<00:04:22.049> you

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:22.109 
reason for that is just that I think you

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:23.719 
reason for that is just that I think you
know<00:04:22.200> this<00:04:22.349> is<00:04:22.380> going<00:04:22.560> to<00:04:22.650> be<00:04:22.800> maybe<00:04:23.220> a<00:04:23.310> season

00:04:23.719 --> 00:04:23.729 
know this is going to be maybe a season

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:25.520 
know this is going to be maybe a season
in<00:04:23.849> and<00:04:24.120> if<00:04:24.570> you<00:04:24.720> bought<00:04:24.930> these<00:04:25.050> players<00:04:25.289> over

in and if you bought these players over

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:26.770 
that season

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:28.619 
that season

00:04:35.129 --> 00:04:35.139 
around Cahill on Louise very good but

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:37.050

and<00:04:42.129> not<00:04:42.580> see<00:04:42.729> bad<00:04:42.879> going<00:04:43.060> forward<00:04:43.360> either<00:04:43.449> and

00:04:44.249 --> 00:04:44.259 
and not see bad going forward either and

00:04:44.259 --> 00:04:45.990 
and not see bad going forward either and
then<00:04:44.440> you<00:04:44.500> possibly<00:04:45.250> could<00:04:45.430> have<00:04:45.460> Williard<00:04:45.909> on

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:46.000 
then you possibly could have Williard on

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.879 
then you possibly could have Williard on
the<00:04:46.090> right<00:04:46.300> Fabregas<00:04:47.050> in<00:04:47.229> the<00:04:47.440> attack<00:04:47.710> coming

00:04:47.879 --> 00:04:47.889 
the right Fabregas in the attack coming

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:49.559 
the right Fabregas in the attack coming
to<00:04:48.009> a<00:04:48.069> little<00:04:48.310> role<00:04:48.430> feeding<00:04:48.879> passes<00:04:49.210> through

00:04:49.559 --> 00:04:49.569 
to a little role feeding passes through

00:04:49.569 --> 00:04:52.020 
to a little role feeding passes through
and<00:04:49.810> has<00:04:50.289> that<00:04:50.440> on<00:04:50.590> left<00:04:50.860> costs<00:04:51.280> or<00:04:51.460> up<00:04:51.490> front<00:04:51.879> I

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:52.030 
and has that on left costs or up front I

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:53.580 
and has that on left costs or up front I
think<00:04:52.210> that<00:04:52.330> it's<00:04:52.509> got<00:04:52.930> quality<00:04:53.110> in<00:04:53.379> all<00:04:53.470> the
