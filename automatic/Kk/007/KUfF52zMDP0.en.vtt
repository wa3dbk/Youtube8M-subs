00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:35.520
 that's mental training because it's the spirit 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:37.350
 first definitions so here now 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.649
 my definition of that 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:43.199
 sports psychologists from the mister weinegg 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:45.089
 under mental training or eberspÃ¤cher 

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:46.830
 So that's the whole topic after 

00:00:45.089 --> 00:00:49.260
 germany has idei 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:52.440
 called motor training understands 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:55.530
 to learn or improve one 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:58.050
 Movement through intensive 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:02.730
 Imagine doing without simultaneous or 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:06.149
 Carrying out so important for me is through 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:12.930
 intense ideas about all senses 

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:18.570
 as in hama five namely which 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:22.580
 to hear hammer smell and taste 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:26.340
 feel and feel the buttons 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:28.950
 movements or the goals or the 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:32.399
 talk about all senses 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:37.290
 the more senses are involved in it all the more 

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:39.290
 better so that's where then nlp 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:43.890
 rhine flows the neurolinguistic 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:46.710
 program mental training that can 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:49.350
 You do it even when you are hurt 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:52.740
 You can do that behind the tax that came 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:57.600
 he doing homework that's it 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:58.950
 great skiing was for example 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.930
 Let's have a look up if you like 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.840
 Skiers prepare on a departure 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:07.020
 or on slalom what do you do it? 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:09.630
 Stand up and make her look like her 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:12.480
 inside their running depart with a 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:13.380
 Shadows are there on the runway with 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.120
 everybody is talking 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.430
 so it is difficult for you 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.680
 skiers if they misplace the race 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.630
 because the shadow changes 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.310
 on the track and it's for one 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.500
 skier what if he for example 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.420
 to sun from the sun in the shade 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.519
 drives and vice versa and that changes 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.540
 then then, so to speak, the inner film 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:36.470
 also be customized 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:38.580
 or I am just a rider and a golfer 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.530
 Germany when riding it is so we 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.850
 can parkuhren springparcours with the 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:45.750
 horse maybe twice 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:47.310
 or in training three times in the ride 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.520
 I can head the parcours 100 times 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:54.500
 ride and you know you have noticed 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:57.180
 visualization will make muscles 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.950
 activated and that of the injured and 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.530
 at least during the injury 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.870
 loses his sport in his head 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:06.480
 less muscle mass than the whole 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:09.750
 nothing does the so-called carpenter 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:12.480
 Effect but a great advantage to me 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:14.670
 I can do it a lot differently for me 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:18.330
 I'm back in training and I have 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:20.030
 by constantly visualizing one 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:23.010
 certain security 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:25.830
 therefore visualization is for me 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:27.510
 view so the key element from the 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:28.950
 mental training what I have from many 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:30.960
 other techniques like coaching 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.850
 classic coaching nlp and so on 

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:35.640
 different because we have one 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:38.820
 nlp the topic of visualization via 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:40.350
 the five senses but it is so rather one 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:42.060
 it will not really be a marginal phenomenon 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:43.530
 the headlamp put on in 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.150
 mental training is really the 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:48.000
 Spotlight on this very strong 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:51.240
 Visualization before the inner mental 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.880
 also in the inner spiritual eye i 

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:56.730
 keep experiencing ours 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:59.220
 society already very weak 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:01.920
 So I'm focused on the 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:04.530
 trainings that then be me manager 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:07.920
 attached to seminar like manager i 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:10.950
 mine do not weaken how do I strengthen 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:14.010
 my strengths but how manager I 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:14.880
 My weaknesses do not work 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:17.130
 my eyes are not 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:19.100
 Apart from that my experience is 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:21.650
 if we strengthen the strengths 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:24.150
 many weaken themselves 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:27.960
 I say that we are in the house what I open 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:29.640
 the meadow is the first wind blog so 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:32.310
 you have to first pour the foundation 

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:34.770
 Confidence because the strengths 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:35.850
 are our self-confidence and then 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:40.580
 We can also weaken on the times 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:43.740
 look and that's why I have a few 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:45.330
 forms so a few worksheets 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:47.220
 you look out there 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:49.770
 These are so-called strong ostriches 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:52.830
 collect your strengths write 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:54.980
 open them up and internalize yourself 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:57.990
 the strengths 

00:04:54.980 --> 00:05:00.540
 because I always experience in the 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:02.130
 the seminars in the workshops that if 

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:04.650
 I say debates are weaknesses 

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:06.020
 people ready in two minutes but if 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:08.730
 I say writing down strengths 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:10.430
 so write four then five 

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:13.040
 maybe out and that 's it 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:16.050
 task is at least 15 

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:18.090
 and then of course depending So 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:19.980
 with athletes in sport or business 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:24.570
 theme business since it happened again 

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:27.230
 also on the reduce to the area 

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:30.540
 or narrow down 

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:32.280
 ok, I'll give you that too 

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:34.890
 so-called resource tree that was 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:37.050
 my christmas card has nothing 

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:39.450
 wanted to do with christmas my 

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:42.240
 other christmas card make around you 

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:44.930
 just to give some ideas what gives 

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:47.070
 the resources that they could have 

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:50.690
 otherwise sometimes helps his 

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:54.060
 Colleagues to ask children to parents 

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:57.660
 after the resources yes but write 

00:05:54.060 --> 00:06:02.750
 Look at it ok then first at the 

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:02.750
 Thank you for attentive listening
