we<00:01:36.630> used<00:01:36.840> all<00:01:37.400> four<00:01:38.400> OTT<00:01:38.579> large<00:01:39.540> diameter

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
we used all four OTT large diameter

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.850 
we used all four OTT large diameter
cabling<00:01:41.270> so<00:01:42.270> there's<00:01:42.450> practically<00:01:43.439> no<00:01:43.619> loss

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860

in<00:01:43.890> them<00:01:44.369> in<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.390> cabling<00:01:45.780> and<00:01:45.960> we<00:01:46.079> have<00:01:46.320> dual

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
in them in the cabling and we have dual

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.749 
in them in the cabling and we have dual

fuse<00:01:51.329> the<00:01:52.490> Zilla<00:01:53.490> is<00:01:54.110> it's<00:01:55.110> difficult<00:01:55.470> to<00:01:55.530> see

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
fuse the Zilla is it's difficult to see

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.330 
fuse the Zilla is it's difficult to see
but<00:01:55.799> it's<00:01:55.950> on<00:01:56.040> a<00:01:56.070> very<00:01:56.759> large<00:01:57.119> IG<00:01:57.780> BT<00:01:58.439> heatsink

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
but it's on a very large IG BT heatsink

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.359 
but it's on a very large IG BT heatsink
large<00:01:59.969> aluminum<00:02:00.210> heatsink<00:02:00.600> and<00:02:00.899> that<00:02:01.049> has

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:01.369 
large aluminum heatsink and that has

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:05.120 
large aluminum heatsink and that has
dual<00:02:02.369> computer<00:02:03.329> fans<00:02:03.570> powering<00:02:04.320> it<00:02:04.710> so<00:02:04.979> that's

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
dual computer fans powering it so that's

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.389 
dual computer fans powering it so that's
air-cooled<00:02:05.640> and<00:02:06.060> then<00:02:06.420> we<00:02:06.509> also<00:02:06.659> have<00:02:06.960> a

00:02:07.389 --> 00:02:07.399 
air-cooled and then we also have a

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:09.740 
air-cooled and then we also have a
water-cooled<00:02:08.399> system<00:02:08.910> which<00:02:09.060> is<00:02:09.239> very

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
water-cooled system which is very

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:10.999 
water-cooled system which is very
difficult<00:02:09.929> to<00:02:10.229> see<00:02:10.379> up<00:02:10.530> here<00:02:10.679> in<00:02:10.739> the<00:02:10.830> corner

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
difficult to see up here in the corner

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.760 
difficult to see up here in the corner
but<00:02:11.660> as<00:02:12.660> a<00:02:12.720> water-cooled<00:02:13.349> system

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
but as a water-cooled system

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:18.020 
but as a water-cooled system
with<00:02:13.980> a<00:02:15.530> remote<00:02:16.530> radiator<00:02:17.160> that's<00:02:17.820> in<00:02:17.940> the

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
with a remote radiator that's in the

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.070 
with a remote radiator that's in the
flow<00:02:18.210> of<00:02:18.360> air<00:02:18.510> there<00:02:18.780> and<00:02:19.050> that<00:02:19.470> also<00:02:19.740> has<00:02:20.070> a

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
flow of air there and that also has a

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.960 
flow of air there and that also has a
adjustable<00:02:22.080> fan<00:02:22.350> speed<00:02:22.740> so<00:02:23.220> we<00:02:23.700> can<00:02:23.730> adjust

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
adjustable fan speed so we can adjust

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.280 
adjustable fan speed so we can adjust
that<00:02:25.280> way<00:02:26.280> so<00:02:26.340> that's<00:02:26.520> the<00:02:26.760> back<00:02:26.970> there<00:02:27.360> and

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
that way so that's the back there and

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.910 
that way so that's the back there and
then<00:02:28.680> inside<00:02:30.140> let's<00:02:31.140> take<00:02:31.290> a<00:02:31.320> peek<00:02:31.620> here

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
then inside let's take a peek here

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:40.190 
then inside let's take a peek here
inside<00:02:33.530> we<00:02:34.530> have<00:02:38.390> another<00:02:39.390> group<00:02:39.630> battery

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
inside we have another group battery

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.960 
inside we have another group battery
just<00:02:40.500> a<00:02:40.560> little<00:02:40.770> bit<00:02:41.040> difficult<00:02:41.610> to<00:02:41.640> see<00:02:41.730> in

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
just a little bit difficult to see in

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.410 
just a little bit difficult to see in
this<00:02:42.000> light<00:02:42.590> so<00:02:43.590> those<00:02:44.040> are<00:02:44.360> all<00:02:45.360> the

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
this light so those are all the

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.370 
this light so those are all the
batteries<00:02:45.750> are<00:02:46.610> held<00:02:47.610> in<00:02:47.730> place<00:02:48.110> and<00:02:49.110> with

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
batteries are held in place and with

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:52.610 
batteries are held in place and with
angle<00:02:49.740> iron<00:02:49.920> and<00:02:50.330> bolted<00:02:51.330> down<00:02:51.930> to<00:02:52.230> the<00:02:52.380> frame

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
angle iron and bolted down to the frame

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.790 
angle iron and bolted down to the frame
and<00:02:52.860> welded<00:02:53.850> to<00:02:53.940> the<00:02:53.970> frame<00:02:54.140> so<00:02:55.140> there's<00:02:55.560> no

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
and welded to the frame so there's no
