00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:10.830
 It's a new video and today I bring 

00:00:08.969 --> 00:00:13.230
 an informative video that usually makes 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.639
 little about greater editing focus and good 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.199
 I usually do few of these videos 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.350
 I usually do what they are being 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:21.960
 reviews or if of each new update 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.310
 that comes out but I was reading what 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.770
 it's been the minecraft twitters 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.840
 premium that is basically where they rise 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:29.670
 like the new things that they are going to take out and 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.230
 also on tomaso's twitter that is 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.789
 which it is responsible together with the team 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.589
 emollient are updating the 

00:00:32.789 --> 00:00:36.989
 microphone that editing to its after 

00:00:34.589 --> 00:00:40.079
 seeing the books or different failures that 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.359
 there is in him to fix them then 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.039
 good looking here where information 

00:00:42.359 --> 00:00:44.609
 that absolutely not all is very 

00:00:44.039 --> 00:00:46.109
 recent 

00:00:44.609 --> 00:00:47.999
 in fact some are from early 

00:00:46.109 --> 00:00:50.729
 this month some of late law of 

00:00:47.999 --> 00:00:52.739
 abuse etc but it is also information 

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:54.719
 very interesting that I thought was excellent 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.719
 come here to share with you 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:00.600
 Well the first thing I want to show you 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.159
 it's a tweet that for six days I 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.920
 basically what he was saying was that the 

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:06.330
 skins to use your older character and 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.370
 it was designed and already 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.050
 thought you do not know if it's going to be 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:14.550
 implanted in the next update 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:16.350
 maybe yes maybe not but nevertheless already 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:18.480
 is designed and is already designed I do not know 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.160
 how it will work at best is that it has 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:22.710
 in premium account simply place 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.390
 the genes being the name and those that are not 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.210
 Well, I suppose there will be some option 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.970
 to download the internet or upload the 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.340
 file of your whoever you want and 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.350
 place ok that's the first thing that I 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.300
 it seems very interesting the other thing that 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.190
 It got a lot of attention because the time 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.870
 I 'm waiting for you very much in 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:42.930
 very factual terms since 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:45.660
 enough time but I had never seen 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:49.290
 that is that the update of the repsol 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:51.420
 is going to be sometimes is intended to 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.310
 take it out what has been the work 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.450
 that is, the first update is from 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.740
 2015 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.500
 zablah first update of firefox 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.030
 edition that you do in 2015 you are 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.979
 thinking that it will come out update of 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.560
 network are that I find excellent because 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:07.490
 those who play in the pc they will know that 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:11.000
 the rest is very useful for fit 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:12.920
 a lot of things for mechanisms and 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.370
 there are people who are very creative with them 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.900
 and I find that very curious or that 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.819
 next is kind a good see 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.739
 there are already mines in what today saying 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:24.019
 fuchsia Maya surfaces of edicions 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:26.239
 in that in this language that is and is not 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:29.060
 same is the table that is like that 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:31.550
 mountainous and dry but good as expected 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.440
 and you can see the mines that are already 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:34.910
 abroad that I've done that nor 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.769
 have even been planted in the minecraft 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:38.269
 of pc that is to find one of 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:41.390
 you have to go into the 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:44.239
 depths of the world and if they have 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.860
 luck for help from the Lord God 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:47.660
 it is sunrise and no no 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:49.880
 so, yes, it seems great 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:51.709
 apart from that the probability of 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:54.140
 find gold and you here the gold 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:55.700
 although in two minutes it is something that 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.080
 you do not usually find many marked 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.140
 by law are the probability of finding 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:02.330
 gold be increase ok not 100% 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:04.730
 football and not increase an increase 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:05.450
 strong the next image is said a 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.750
 good to see 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:11.600
 no longer mesh colors as well as the 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:13.790
 fence itself as your door that's something 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:15.860
 attitude for decoration because it's that 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:17.900
 in decoration that has made a 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:21.200
 major update of pc in which 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:22.760
 get or put flowers and a lot of 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.489
 things and looked for a can see lately 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:28.090
 very well they are focusing a lot on that 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:30.890
 the aspect of greater is much better since 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:33.739
 because we were all used to it already 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:36.049
 be greater up to that that yes to 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:37.909
 typical of bigger but we never had 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:40.159
 presented is good to see if I want 

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:41.780
 decorate something that decorated it then 

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:44.180
 wet what you are doing is think a 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:46.879
 little bit more in those kinds of people already and 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:49.129
 nothing that seems excellent to me are a couple 

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:51.379
 of information that I wanted to bring with 

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:52.669
 you and the other than those who 

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:55.519
 ask, how will not the 

00:03:52.669 --> 00:03:57.139
 0.10 tractor are already 0.10 so no 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:59.090
 you can see already you're thinking and you already 

00:03:57.139 --> 00:04:01.390
 However, the bases are still 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:04.030
 this type of update 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:06.250
 will not bring what is coming many 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:08.050
 changes in the major codes 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:10.090
 that is, the only thing he is going to do is 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:14.230
 add different blocks of different 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:17.079
 objects to make the greater the better and 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:18.579
 the mines clear so nothing that would be 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:20.260
 I hope you all will like this 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:22.840
 information if you liked it already know that it 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.500
 you can subscribe to like it and that would be 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.700
 toxic 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:27.250
 I hope you liked this video 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:29.650
 remember to like and subscribe for 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:32.760

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:32.760
 until next time 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:43.900
 it's okay
