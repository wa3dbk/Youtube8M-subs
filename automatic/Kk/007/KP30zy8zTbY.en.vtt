today I want to show you amplitude slash

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.890 
today I want to show you amplitude slash
for<00:00:10.050> the<00:00:10.200> iPhone<00:00:11.300> so<00:00:12.300> when<00:00:12.420> you<00:00:12.480> load<00:00:12.630> it<00:00:12.780> up

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
you have two selections of amps this is

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:22.759 
you have two selections of amps this is
the<00:00:16.020> JCM<00:00:16.920> slash<00:00:17.630> and<00:00:19.789> you<00:00:20.789> can<00:00:21.529> go<00:00:22.529> through<00:00:22.740> all

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
the JCM slash and you can go through all

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.529 
the JCM slash and you can go through all
the<00:00:22.949> different<00:00:23.250> settings<00:00:23.430> here<00:00:23.880> all<00:00:24.359> the

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
the different settings here all the

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.500 
the different settings here all the
knobs<00:00:24.720> and<00:00:25.050> you<00:00:25.920> select<00:00:26.189> each<00:00:26.369> one<00:00:26.609> and<00:00:26.880> then

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
knobs and you select each one and then

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.060 
knobs and you select each one and then
use<00:00:27.720> this<00:00:27.869> control<00:00:28.289> here<00:00:28.500> to<00:00:28.710> adjust<00:00:31.070> the

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
use this control here to adjust the

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.549 
use this control here to adjust the
parameter<00:00:32.489> or<00:00:32.640> you<00:00:32.730> can<00:00:32.880> actually<00:00:33.440> turn<00:00:34.440> the

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
parameter or you can actually turn the

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:35.569 
parameter or you can actually turn the
knob<00:00:34.680> itself<00:00:34.829> but<00:00:35.100> that's<00:00:35.250> a<00:00:35.309> little<00:00:35.399> bit

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
knob itself but that's a little bit

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:41.240 
knob itself but that's a little bit
easier<00:00:37.700> if<00:00:38.700> we<00:00:38.760> click<00:00:39.000> here<00:00:39.030> on<00:00:39.239> to<00:00:39.570> a<00:00:40.110> FD<00:00:40.710> 100

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
easier if we click here on to a FD 100

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.080 
easier if we click here on to a FD 100
so<00:00:41.370> that's<00:00:41.550> the<00:00:41.640> new<00:00:41.820> Marshall<00:00:42.690> a<00:00:42.780> FD<00:00:43.110> amp<00:00:43.350> and

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:44.090 
so that's the new Marshall a FD amp and

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.970 
so that's the new Marshall a FD amp and
again<00:00:45.090> you<00:00:45.480> have<00:00:45.510> all<00:00:45.899> your<00:00:46.079> normal<00:00:46.440> controls

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
again you have all your normal controls

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.330 
again you have all your normal controls
for<00:00:47.570> you<00:00:48.570> know<00:00:48.690> bass<00:00:48.930> middle<00:00:49.350> treble<00:00:49.440> presence

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
for you know bass middle treble presence

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:51.979 
for you know bass middle treble presence
etc<00:00:50.789> but<00:00:51.149> you<00:00:51.210> also<00:00:51.390> have<00:00:51.570> a<00:00:51.629> switch<00:00:51.840> at<00:00:51.960> the

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
etc but you also have a switch at the

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.150 
etc but you also have a switch at the
end<00:00:52.140> now<00:00:52.260> I<00:00:52.289> don't<00:00:52.410> if<00:00:52.559> you<00:00:52.649> can<00:00:52.680> see<00:00:52.980> because

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
end now I don't if you can see because

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.069 
end now I don't if you can see because
the<00:00:53.309> reflection<00:00:53.910> when<00:00:54.570> you<00:00:54.660> switch<00:00:54.899> between

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
the reflection when you switch between

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.840 
the reflection when you switch between
number<00:00:55.800> 34<00:00:56.280> or<00:00:56.520> a<00:00:57.090> FD<00:00:57.719> so<00:00:58.469> it<00:00:58.680> sort<00:00:58.859> of<00:00:58.890> has<00:00:59.579> the

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
number 34 or a FD so it sort of has the

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.180 
number 34 or a FD so it sort of has the
the<00:01:00.480> two<00:01:00.629> different<00:01:01.079> voicings<00:01:01.770> of<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.070> amp

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
the two different voicings of the amp

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.600 
the two different voicings of the amp
there<00:01:02.460> and<00:01:02.960> then<00:01:03.960> across<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.260> top<00:01:04.379> you<00:01:05.339> have

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
there and then across the top you have

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.590 
there and then across the top you have
first<00:01:06.210> of<00:01:06.299> all<00:01:06.619> your<00:01:07.619> amplitude<00:01:07.979> tools<00:01:08.600> which

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
first of all your amplitude tools which

up your effects and your different
effects<00:01:49.110> slots<00:01:49.350> and<00:01:49.590> chosen<00:01:50.040> which<00:01:50.220> amp<00:01:50.430> you

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
effects slots and chosen which amp you

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.580 
effects slots and chosen which amp you
want<00:01:50.610> to<00:01:50.670> use<00:01:50.820> and<00:01:51.090> set<00:01:51.330> that<00:01:51.479> up<00:01:51.509> you<00:01:51.810> then<00:01:52.259> can

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
want to use and set that up you then can

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.100 
want to use and set that up you then can
go<00:01:52.770> to<00:01:52.830> the<00:01:53.250> record<00:01:53.820> screen<00:01:54.270> so<00:01:54.990> this

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
go to the record screen so this

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.800

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
basically allows you to record and loop

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.730 
basically allows you to record and loop
and<00:01:58.110> play<00:01:58.320> tracks<00:01:58.649> etc<00:01:59.250> you<00:02:00.240> can<00:02:00.509> go<00:02:00.720> to

there's a mixer here and you can
actually<00:02:05.909> purchase<00:02:06.420> an<00:02:06.780> add-on<00:02:06.960> and<00:02:07.289> get<00:02:07.680> up

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
actually purchase an add-on and get up

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.940 
actually purchase an add-on and get up
to<00:02:07.979> four<00:02:08.580> tracks<00:02:08.850> of<00:02:09.229> audio<00:02:10.229> that<00:02:10.619> you<00:02:10.770> can
