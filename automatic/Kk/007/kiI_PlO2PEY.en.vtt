00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:07.339
 every spring is the beginning of summer many of us 

00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:10.460
 see in the dead here is such an ad 

00:00:07.339 --> 00:00:14.629
 sorry on the hot water you won't have 

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:14.990
 15 years ago, the water was turned off at 21 

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:17.780
 day 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:20.090
 then this period was gradually reduced and 

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:23.810
 this time I was turned off for 10 days 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:26.050
 but nonetheless still turned off why 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:29.150
 hot water is shut off every year 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:30.920
 the faithful viewer asks me at first 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:33.219
 I wanted to be limited to mine 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:35.809
 standard answer because fagot 

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:38.239
 but then I decided to tell all the same 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:39.050
 more detail and at the same time scare you 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:41.239
 horror stories 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.140
 but at the same time instill faith in the bright 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:44.210
 future 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:47.179
 to understand and for what dick off 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:49.670
 hot water needs to be understood as and 

00:00:47.179 --> 00:00:52.460
 actually make hot on your 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:55.789
 boiler rooms mountains of heat it costs itself 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:58.909
 the boiler it has two contours boiler and 

00:00:55.789 --> 00:01:00.589
 network boiler is a technical circuit 

00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:02.479
 where the so-called circulates 

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:04.150
 process water which is 

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:07.070
 coolant from the gas burner 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:09.380
 flame in coal or electric spiral 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:12.200
 depending on what energy 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:15.170
 the boiler works, that is, in fact it is 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:17.780
 closed tube inside the tank of the boiler where 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.640
 water is circulating heating it goes 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:22.550
 inside the tank chilling comes back 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:25.100
 back to the burner where it heats up again 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:27.950
 But inside the tank already flows 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:30.830
 heated water which is then supplied 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:33.800
 at home, that is, they pour cold water into the boiler 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:36.740
 water it is heated there by the technical 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:39.110
 contour heat transfer occurs and heated 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.390
 water goes to the consumer and technical 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.640
 comes back to the burner so here 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:46.400
 on this very technical circuit is clear 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.710
 dick formed limescale scum 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:52.040
 which isolates the circuit from the heated 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:54.260
 water and efficiency drops sharply when I spoke 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:56.210
 about saving on washing told that 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:58.970
 when you connect the washing machine on 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:01.400
 hot water and all sorts of calgon and you can not 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.980
 buy all the scum and so left in 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:06.380
 boiler room so here during the annual 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:08.690
 prevention water from the tank is drained and 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.069
 begin to feel scum from this very 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.069
 boiler circuit 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:13.890
 in addition, due to scale formation 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:16.050
 local overheating 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.870
 in the tubes of the technical circuit can 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:21.450
 a hole through which is dirty 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:24.150
 technical water gets clean 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.760
 which then goes to your house exactly 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.950
 so you can not drink hot water from under 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.260
 tap and if any of the neighbors 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.760
 long-standing crane for example with 100 years 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.800
 back obsolete herringbone 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.020
 something happens in this country 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.420
 add hot water to cold and 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.560
 on the contrary, and he goes not only to his mouth 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.930
 trash owner 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.750
 Well, to all the other neighbors in the riser 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:48.450
 so cold tap water too 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:51.209
 you can not drink because there is no guarantee that there 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:53.970
 no impurities technical from the boiler but 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:56.459
 but I will talk about this later in 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.709
 time of prevention of scum clean off the holes 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:00.930
 brewed clean all wild chemistry and 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:03.330
 start again this is clear 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.820
 takes some time and hot pipes 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:08.370
 filled with cold water to pressure 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:09.930
 cold did not press into the empty pipe hot 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.690
 and did not break the mixers 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:15.510
 another thing is that at the time of prevention 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:17.820
 it would be possible to switch houses on 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.900
 neighboring substation as they do in 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:21.299
 European cities 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.620
 well, or put in every house common 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:25.079
 electric boiler 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.610
 what in Moscow promised to make more meadows 

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:28.950
 then for residents 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:32.010
 the hot water outages will remain in 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:34.880
 the past why this is not done because 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.880
 what a fag
