 this video is sponsored by the frank and 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:05.540
 bullet tail and huelva 

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:10.750
 Hello everyone, how are you? 

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:12.760
 have a great time, greet them to the note 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:14.950
 rivas and here I bring you another video with 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:17.080
 I'm telling you this is a little theory 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:19.480
 about one piece and as the title says 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:22.300
 everything will talk about what lucy will lose a 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:24.130
 eye so let's start at once already ago 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.349
 a couple of years a data wood came out where 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.630
 oda showed the first sketches of the 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:30.789
 very expensive as well as things that never 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.739
 they came out in the sagas however at 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:34.750
 end of the data book appears someone with 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:37.150
 an eye patch as said by 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.890
 now this is a very powerful character 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:41.530
 that will appear by the end of the series 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:43.600
 this gave something to talk about a time and it's 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.940
 that many thought immediately that 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.220
 this character was lucy and others said 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:50.799
 not that as the character said now 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:53.110
 will appear by the end of the series here 

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:54.850
 things are very curious if that 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:57.220
 character will be light and not by the 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.409
 following reasons although the character 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:01.780
 is identical to him and he has the hat 

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:03.820
 straw is strange how is that he said now 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.890
 that this character would appear at the end 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.049
 as if it were someone new 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:10.359
 apart from that said that this character 

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:12.130
 it will be very powerful your description is like 

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:13.990
 if it was a new character 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:16.390
 this was the point of many theories 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:18.369
 different from who that character would be 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:22.200
 but now I will tell you about him because I think 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:22.200
 that that character if that will be light 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:28.240
 exactly the scar if we look 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.520
 well that character has the scar of 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.439
 light and in addition to the hat so no 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.509
 there must be no doubt that this 

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:37.060
 super powerful character that will appear 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:39.250
 by the end it is the same lucido but 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:42.009
 then because oda describes it as if 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:43.929
 was another good character I think this 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:45.759
 It is because this is when Lucy 

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:48.310
 has become the most 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:50.470
 powerful of all is to say when you leave 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.390
 of being the pirate lutfi and becoming 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:54.789
 the new king of pirates monkey of 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.740
 illusion about what it says written in the 

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:58.990
 image I could not get a translation 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.580
 so I started to investigate a little 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.190
 on the subject and I found something 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:05.440
 interesting and that is that while the world of 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:07.509
 One piece is immense ode said that only 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.910
 we would see a pirate with one of the three 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:12.519
 classic permanent marks of a pirate 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:15.060
 each is the wooden leg 

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:17.200
 hook in the hand and the eye patch 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.660
 currently we already know the two 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:22.120
 first which are cef and crocodile 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:24.519
 and the third with the eye patch ode 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.680
 He said he would show it later 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:28.330
 but if we've already seen a couple of 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.720
 characters in wampis with 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:34.480
 in the eyes as for example express not 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.490
 you're wrong those are not patches the one 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.800
 drake is a kind of band and that of 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:40.930
 place is a lens besides that both still 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.420
 have both eyes uncovered is 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.890
 say that they still conserve them and it's supposed 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.050
 that the wooden leg and the hook 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:48.910
 they replace a missing member so 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:51.130
 both the eye patch carrier 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.960
 Is it because he lost his eye in addition to 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:55.690
 have a big wound that needs to be 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:57.790
 cover and as we know many now 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:59.770
 has its full history developed 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.720
 from the beginning and possibly the fact 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:03.730
 that lucy will be the bearer of the patch 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.830
 in the eye also and always has 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:08.260
 demonstrated with a small detail its 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:10.209
 scar we know that he did it to himself 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.250
 same light and to show sam's that 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:14.110
 I was brave but I think this is in 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.030
 reality to leave us a small 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:17.980
 proof of what will come to light and such 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.959
 Once the scar is the reason that 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.850
 lucy lose the eye that scar 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:24.250
 will open during one of your most fights 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:26.200
 brutal today he waits but if he makes a 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:29.410
 moment to show you what I still had 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:31.600
 the scar of fact why does he do 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:33.700
 I know but there is still the possibility that 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.840
 that will change since that image is a 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.180
 lazcoz sketch 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:39.250
 they can change but let's suppose that 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.260
 no and that when losing the eye it will still conserve 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:43.300
 his scar but this one is only for 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.760
 give us the idea that from the start 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:48.670
 will lose his eye but I think it will be for 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:51.010
 his scar that would be great now 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:53.379
 the main question how will you lose it 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:55.569
 Well, as I said it will be in one of your 

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:57.700
 tougher fights and it will possibly be 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:59.140
 against black beard and this I believe because 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:02.160
 remember that he did three 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:04.540
 scars to chance in the curious eye not 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.500
 possibly rufi sacrifice to his eye 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.239
 for some reason 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:09.280
 let's remember that against mega land he 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:11.890
 he preferred to run out of hands to lose 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.900
 I think that would make it even more epic if 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:16.060
 now he said that character would come out 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:17.979
 the end then maybe this will happen to him 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:20.079
 to adolf and to the last of the series or 

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:22.300
 the patch will be fine until the end 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:24.100
 another theory that I found in a forum is 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.169
 that in the end sanllehÃ­ would lose a 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:28.030
 leg and only one arm well the trio 

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:30.490
 monstrous would have one of the three 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:32.350
 permanent marks each one but if you 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:34.210
 you said I told you that only 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:36.810
 we would make a private one with one of the 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:39.360
 three permanent brands and those already 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:41.340
 yes I know but as I said it was a theory 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:43.410
 of a forum but I really did not think 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:45.600
 not bad that idea also now can 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:47.250
 change your mind after all is your 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:49.620
 series haha good friends 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:51.630
 that was the theory I know it does not debate much 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:53.850
 but as I said at the beginning it's a theory 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:56.100
 short I tried to be as concise 

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:58.230
 possible but good now comment me 

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:00.510
 who do you think that character is 

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:02.460
 or if they think lucy will lose her eye if 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:04.620
 they liked the video, not in the end what 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:06.389
 you want finally that's all and 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:09.240
 before leaving I want to send a greeting 

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:11.250
 my friend mateo yorbis well up here 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:13.560
 the video tell me what you want and 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:18.020
 For my part, that's all , goodbye 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:18.020
 you your friend alan otaku rivas goodbye
