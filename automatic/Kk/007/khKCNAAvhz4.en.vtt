00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:22.350

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:26.099

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:31.650
 what he had and has the big break 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:35.790
 joy had or has many thanks so 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:44.129
 get the compass today and on it 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:51.800
 we make the need to hedge 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:51.800
 Crochet hook how to do that 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.019
 you just go 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.019
 the braided 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.510
 you make them 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:58.500
 that will be so full in a row 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:03.630
 and we will show that 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:08.310
 if the center can show you like that 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:11.220
 half since we have half 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.410
 side the seatrade made on it and 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.600
 then I just kick a man upstairs 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:22.230
 and you see that the other one 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:25.670
 side not finished it exactly like that 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:31.260
 So it looks like there you can 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:34.380
 either you can let that or you can 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:39.410
 she can just come back here full 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:39.410
 do with the finished 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:46.540
 that looks like that 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:49.280
 with this page 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:53.060
 we've tied her up now 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:54.709
 have it all done purely made and 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:58.030
 I open it and then you can 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:58.030
 we see what it looks like 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:36.400
 I can roast it so open and 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:45.310
 shows her from behind her nice and long 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:49.230
 made and shows that you are her 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:49.230
 also expensive
