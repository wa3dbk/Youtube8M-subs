feel<00:01:45.600> with<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:45.990> ball<00:01:46.560> head<00:01:46.829> pin<00:01:47.820> without<00:01:48.149> even

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
feel with the ball head pin without even

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.719 
feel with the ball head pin without even
bothering<00:01:48.659> one-handed<00:01:49.500> you<00:01:49.590> touch<00:01:49.829> it<00:01:50.100> is

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
bothering one-handed you touch it is

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.690 
bothering one-handed you touch it is
it's<00:01:50.970> already<00:01:51.619> threatening<00:01:52.619> as<00:01:53.280> you<00:01:53.399> can<00:01:53.520> see

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
it's already threatening as you can see

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.370 
it's already threatening as you can see
they're<00:01:53.909> threatening<00:01:54.180> the<00:01:54.420> roof<00:01:54.600> but<00:01:55.140> then<00:01:55.259> if

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
they're threatening the roof but then if

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.590 
they're threatening the roof but then if
you<00:01:55.439> flip<00:01:55.649> to<00:01:55.680> the<00:01:55.770> other<00:01:55.890> side<00:01:56.040> I'm<00:01:56.790> getting

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
you flip to the other side I'm getting

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.800 
you flip to the other side I'm getting
much<00:01:57.780> more<00:01:58.020> control<00:01:58.890> close<00:01:59.369> to<00:01:59.549> ring<00:01:59.759> and<00:02:00.030> I

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
much more control close to ring and I

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.870 
much more control close to ring and I
can<00:02:01.049> just<00:02:01.229> angle<00:02:01.649> about<00:02:01.920> where<00:02:02.100> I<00:02:02.130> want<00:02:02.490> to

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
can just angle about where I want to

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.120 
can just angle about where I want to
help<00:02:03.060> ensure<00:02:03.450> the<00:02:03.479> slips<00:02:04.049> well<00:02:04.649> I<00:02:04.860> could

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
help ensure the slips well I could

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.800 
help ensure the slips well I could
probably<00:02:05.189> use<00:02:05.399> it<00:02:05.579> myself<00:02:05.700> don't<00:02:06.360> put<00:02:06.689> them

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
probably use it myself don't put them

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.990 
probably use it myself don't put them
down<00:02:06.840> and<00:02:07.350> shell<00:02:07.829> some<00:02:08.099> chances<00:02:08.520> is<00:02:08.610> about<00:02:08.819> so

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
down and shell some chances is about so

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.040 
down and shell some chances is about so
goes<00:02:09.149> on<00:02:09.330> to<00:02:09.450> get<00:02:09.539> to

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
goes on to get to

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.920 
goes on to get to
