00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.850

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:10.469
 Plenary paper minaz 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:14.879
 I think it hurts the tracks. 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:17.160
 Actually, I most made friends. 

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:19.199
 hello women, how are you, alexandra? 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.430

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.580
 People are going to talk a little bit about 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:26.160
 beauty and today exclusively or speak 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.800
 about botox magnetizador after all 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.210
 We all know that every woman hates 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.820
 yellow children 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.739
 we need to look for a progressive 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.300
 or even any treatment that leaves 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.859
 our kids a little bit more 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.429
 aligned right 

00:00:37.859 --> 00:00:44.159
 I search the internet and I consulted 

00:00:41.429 --> 00:00:46.909
 referring to Botox that said it was a 

00:00:44.159 --> 00:00:48.510
 process that treated smoothed hair 

00:00:46.909 --> 00:00:51.210
 especially for the hair 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:54.449
 discolored and had the touch called 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.940
 botox baptizer I consulted several brands 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.319
 And then what caught my attention was this 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.749
 It's the old age that I've read 

00:00:58.319 --> 00:01:02.249
 comments from their previous botox 

00:01:00.749 --> 00:01:04.979
 that here is 

00:01:02.249 --> 00:01:09.030
 is the were they professional where 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:12.329
 platinium - then it 's a product and show 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:16.799
 For you it 's a very consistent product. 

00:01:12.329 --> 00:01:19.530
 have a liter can not see the house 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:22.649
 product does not cause any product as 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:25.979
 constant well well 

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:28.680
 Consistent even and a half dark vote is 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:31.530
 his posture is very well very thick 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:35.219
 even I bought through the internet search 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:37.229
 on several websites I bought a mall 

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:38.939

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.549
 gaining nothing to talk about it okay 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:44.490
 good including the website the delivery was super 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:47.219
 quick and at the time I bought the kit 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:50.420
 because full value but had only 

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:53.670

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.060
 It's also very scary here, but 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.920
 We're going to do a review for you. 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.069
 his is good but today I'll talk 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.299
 exclusively on botox but the pain that 

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:08.819
 he said that a deep hydration 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:12.420
 volume reduction martins hair

 moment of application the hair

 strengthening the process of 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:47.080
 marginalization and volume reduction which 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:48.520
 caught my attention was the process of 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.410
 using it 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:53.440
 after washing the hair with shampoo 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:56.220

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.760
 centimeter of root 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:06.070
 distribute evenly using a comb 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.380
 of middle teeth by combing until 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:09.550
 perceive product uniformity in the 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:12.940
 hair 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:15.160
 pause for 20 minutes and rinse 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:17.770
 after finishing with a board and 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:21.160
 brush then the process of using I 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:23.320
 I found it to be very, very easy but I 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:26.830
 I had a surprise that you will see there. 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:29.620
 in the video but as you know it is 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:31.450
 I use mega so when I do 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:34.870
 any kind of chemical process in my 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:37.480
 Hair I do my hair right and 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:40.660
 megahair also to be able to follow and 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:43.720
 url was too much for your hair 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:46.980
 doll knows he was swinging a lot 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:49.690
 children were not aligned and 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:51.220
 to use I have always used a baptizer and baptized 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:52.600
 Whether or not she wants to dry a 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:55.030
 little hair mainly with 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:56.710
 because he is a dead movie he does not 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:58.480
 it's on our scalp 

00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:00.790
 so it also needs hydration 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:03.070
 of everything that we do ours 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:05.320
 hair he needs to have much more than 

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:08.230
 This has to be very careful with him and 

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:10.270
 I almost bought it to make it 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:11.770
 especially in my hair was a 

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:15.420
 little porous part of my hair 

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:18.310
 Is it needing a little bit? 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:19.960
 You guys, if you want to know what? 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:22.630
 happened to my hair watch the video 

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:25.120
 this was the final process in my 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:25.910
 mega how can you see where it's okay 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.820
 lined up 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:32.120
 you can compare with 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:34.640

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:37.910

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:41.350
 doll knows but look at my hair that 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:44.270
 It happened I clicked a lot. 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:45.440
 It was terrible, I tried to take off that purple and 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:48.680
 can not 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:50.900
 and then the way was to run holy project and 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:54.560
 I got this shot from my 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:56.810
 hair and give a deal even if it was too long 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:58.700
 ugly really 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:01.370
 as you can see and had to leave 

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:03.530
 running in search of jefferson is more 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:06.650
 everything worked out but in my opinion 

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:09.290
 total I loved the product I liked the 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:12.230
 product even good girls so much is that 

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:13.910
 I ended up buying is another botox from 

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:17.030
 same line they were happy because I read 

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:19.940

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:21.620

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:25.220
 then I bought as is white to 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:27.400
 mix with my ex-senator and doing 

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:30.800

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:31.880
 I 'm rushed as soon as the 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:33.680
 botox 

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:35.240
 I took this one from here, I just did the test and 

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:36.920
 I mixed both of which botox in 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:39.890

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:06.260
