00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.680
 how does javi shine today our friend the 

00:00:08.969 --> 00:00:12.900
 young man brings us a beautiful craft and 

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:15.000
 very useful for all those who 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.450
 like the decoration the crafts the 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:22.710
 jewelery jewelry very useful and it is called 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:25.110
 let's see cds dds cd that 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.399
 those that prose or good clear really 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:28.739
 translated would the song not be 

00:00:26.399 --> 00:00:30.960
 quartered or recorded I think it 

00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:33.239
 they're called craquelure so that the 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.640
 have it very clear and it is about 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.650
 simply and new to your thesis you see 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.590
 what projects are they are simply 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:43.140
 well to know a microwave mic 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.340
 ponce of you do not scare us you 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.470
 because everything has its way 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.000
 you will understand why here we have the 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:50.579
 proof of two numbers are to eat them 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.590
 in a furnace tower for the 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.990
 decoration look can be left 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:58.110
 different colors like for example you see 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:01:00.480
 this blue this more greenish yellow 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:04.050
 brown and that depends on color 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:06.870
 original that had the cde 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:10.230
 the way to do it is so simple no 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:14.370
 can be we have to warn not if by 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:17.100
 example we were commenting before 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:19.290
 start the segment that is something to 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.930
 review very very very very important and it is 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.530
 that the cde that we want to do with 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:27.750
 the craquelure should not have any paper 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:30.530
 for the simple reason that good 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.160
 could understand you can set fire to 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.840
 regardless of what we have also 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:36.210
 caution with the time in which what 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.710
 we leave the cde inside so there is no 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.000
 no danger but independently 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.860
 of this may have the danger of 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.800
 catch fire with which is preferable 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:46.520
 never have paper of agreement very 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:49.080
 well to have done is that we need 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:51.660
 ingredients ingredients it is 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.610
 clear a cedé for example this same that 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:56.460
 I have here at hand 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.610
 and a glass and a microwave and a microwave 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:02.670
 the glass is neither more nor less than the 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:04.620
 mere stand to put the cd inside the 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.570
 microwaves agree on let's go with 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:09.000
 they hear and the side you want him 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.410
 we put up face down something 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.630
 very interesting really silvia already 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.820
 I forgot to say that always with the 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.590
 face that is going to crack the ar towards 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:20.070
 above the right bright face 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:23.310
 never by the opposite side but by the 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:26.420
 face that carries everything down on paper 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:30.090
 it seems 319 that's why we're using this 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:33.030
 come on let's go with it we 're going to see 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:35.580
 we are going to introduce the glass that is a 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:39.209
 simple stand without water completely empty 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:41.480
 and with the cedé with the part where the 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:44.470
 degrees data up 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:47.690
 to the bright part to eye an exception 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:50.959
 important never never never have to 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:53.180
 let it run the microwave more than 10 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:56.299
 seconds because there is danger of 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.560
 more than temperatures between 800 and 1000 kva 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:03:01.060
 800 and 1,000 watts 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:03.470
 is the maximum of most of 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.690
 gross microwaves check the your 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:08.090
 by dry we insist never more than 10 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:10.040
 seconds and never with paper for all the 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.000
 less than synchronize it 10 seconds 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:15.420
 long 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:19.310
 we are ready then a dose 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.310
 let's go with it then nothing 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:27.950
 that's normal ridiculous hatreds or the 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:31.129
 cheese pits crackling seconds with 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:33.170
 which we opened the door and now that's 

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:34.879
 you have to let it cool a little 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:36.469
 just let it cool because now 

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:38.870
 It is hot but not because it is 

00:03:36.469 --> 00:03:41.420
 a cedé but because anything that 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:43.549
 Seen seconds in a microwave burns to 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:45.829
 some told them at the beginning not 

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:47.450
 you fear for these noises because this is 

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:48.859
 the microwave that we use never 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:51.620
 it has spoiled us for doing that 

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:55.400
 as long as you use it once with a 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:57.290
 cd or twice maximum if you like it a lot 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.609
 the craft to jewelry and you think 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:01.040
 use a lot because I know that it has 

00:03:58.609 --> 00:04:04.129
 liked then use an old one what 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:07.129
 you leave exclusively for that and uses 

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:09.799
 it's normal for cooking but already 

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:12.169
 I tell you once or twice that 6 does not 

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:13.760
 nothing would happen simply the new one is not 

00:04:12.169 --> 00:04:16.459
 old man who had it only for 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:19.340
 This jewelery, for example, is left 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:20.900
 cool a cloth is passed with a little 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:23.180
 low 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:26.180
 and even if maybe a 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:29.690
 little bit of singe smell we can 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:33.880
 put a lemon a lemon a lemon zip to 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:33.880
 half a minute and it gives a little bit of aroma if 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:43.420
 we see the result is already totally in 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:45.610
 fixed form you see exactly the same 

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:48.820
 is when we have started the 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:50.160
 craftsmanship the craquelure that pretty or 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:53.260
 is not panic 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:55.690
 nothing is very smooth but nevertheless 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:59.550
 inside does what is crack 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:59.550
 the crack the crack that's 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:14.350
 to use a lot to enjoy and ah 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:15.040
 well then to practice it friends 

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:18.870
 agreement 

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:18.870
 chau see you soon chau chau
