when<00:00:06.750> it's<00:00:06.870> in<00:00:06.960> a<00:00:07.020> warehouse<00:00:08.120> so<00:00:09.120> this<00:00:09.240> is<00:00:09.420> my

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
when it's in a warehouse so this is my

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.620 
when it's in a warehouse so this is my
fourth<00:00:10.559> one<00:00:10.830> I<00:00:10.860> believe<00:00:11.130> third<00:00:12.059> or<00:00:12.210> fourth<00:00:12.450> one

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
fourth one I believe third or fourth one

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.900 
fourth one I believe third or fourth one
something<00:00:12.929> in<00:00:13.080> there<00:00:13.259> anyway<00:00:13.920> seems<00:00:14.580> like<00:00:14.730> the

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
something in there anyway seems like the

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.609 
something in there anyway seems like the
bigger<00:00:15.089> my<00:00:15.269> store<00:00:15.509> gets<00:00:15.719> the<00:00:15.990> more<00:00:16.109> simple<00:00:16.500> it

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
bigger my store gets the more simple it

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:17.960 
bigger my store gets the more simple it
gets<00:00:16.830> so<00:00:17.070> this<00:00:17.220> really<00:00:17.430> shouldn't<00:00:17.699> take<00:00:17.910> too

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
gets so this really shouldn't take too

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.380 
gets so this really shouldn't take too
long<00:00:18.740> we<00:00:19.740> have<00:00:19.770> two<00:00:20.070> entrances<00:00:20.400> at<00:00:20.850> the<00:00:21.000> moment

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
long we have two entrances at the moment

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
this is one corner of peril there's

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.960 
this is one corner of peril there's
another<00:00:25.199> corner<00:00:25.650> over<00:00:25.800> there<00:00:26.070> you<00:00:26.519> can<00:00:26.640> get<00:00:26.789> in

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
another corner over there you can get in

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.150 
another corner over there you can get in
to<00:00:27.570> the<00:00:27.689> store<00:00:27.960> now<00:00:28.529> I'm<00:00:28.650> shooting<00:00:28.830> this

to the store now I'm shooting this

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.370 
to the store now I'm shooting this
because<00:00:29.609> I'm<00:00:30.269> gonna<00:00:30.599> be<00:00:30.660> moving<00:00:31.019> the<00:00:31.109> store

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380

yet<00:00:31.859> again<00:00:32.660> so<00:00:33.660> I<00:00:34.079> figured<00:00:34.710> I'd<00:00:34.829> better<00:00:35.010> get<00:00:35.219> it

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
yet again so I figured I'd better get it

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.530 
yet again so I figured I'd better get it
captured<00:00:35.969> as<00:00:36.180> it<00:00:36.540> looks<00:00:36.719> right<00:00:36.989> now<00:00:38.390> so<00:00:39.390> that<00:00:39.510> I

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
captured as it looks right now so that I

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.260 
captured as it looks right now so that I
can<00:00:39.570> do<00:00:39.780> another<00:00:39.989> one<00:00:40.079> when<00:00:40.680> I<00:00:40.710> move<00:00:41.010> it

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:41.270 
can do another one when I move it

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:47.139 
can do another one when I move it
upstairs<00:00:42.469> so<00:00:43.850> I'm<00:00:44.850> gonna<00:00:44.940> go<00:00:45.120> in<00:00:45.270> this<00:00:45.390> corner

00:00:47.139 --> 00:00:47.149

out of this one by 4 plates needed the
Vienna<00:04:32.860> bin<00:04:33.360> or<00:04:34.360> drawer<00:04:34.930> couldn't<00:04:35.919> fit<00:04:36.039> in<00:04:36.099> the

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:36.190 
Vienna bin or drawer couldn't fit in the

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:43.490 
Vienna bin or drawer couldn't fit in the
bin<00:04:36.360> this<00:04:37.360> nonsense

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:43.500 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:48.089 

so<00:04:45.389> you<00:04:46.389> said<00:04:46.629> the<00:04:47.169> smaller<00:04:47.620> drawers<00:04:47.800> wrap

00:04:48.089 --> 00:04:48.099 
so you said the smaller drawers wrap

00:04:48.099 --> 00:04:49.950 
so you said the smaller drawers wrap
around<00:04:48.370> here<00:04:48.550> to<00:04:48.669> the<00:04:48.729> end<00:04:48.940> and<00:04:49.210> then<00:04:49.840> they

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:49.960 
around here to the end and then they

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.059 
around here to the end and then they
have<00:04:50.139> two<00:04:50.470> more<00:04:50.680> here<00:04:50.970> the<00:04:51.970> large<00:04:52.210> drawers<00:04:53.069> go

00:04:54.059 --> 00:04:54.069 
have two more here the large drawers go

00:04:54.069 --> 00:04:56.100 
have two more here the large drawers go
to<00:04:54.129> the<00:04:54.280> end<00:04:54.400> down<00:04:54.550> here<00:04:54.610> and<00:04:55.060> then<00:04:55.780> they<00:04:55.930> go

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:56.110 
to the end down here and then they go

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:59.879 
to the end down here and then they go
down<00:04:56.530> so<00:04:57.039> one<00:04:57.250> two<00:04:57.550> and<00:04:57.849> then<00:04:58.449> stacks<00:04:58.840> four<00:04:59.259> one

00:04:59.879 --> 00:04:59.889 
down so one two and then stacks four one

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:03.119 
down so one two and then stacks four one
two<00:05:00.099> three<00:05:00.129> four<00:05:00.370> five<00:05:01.770> hanging<00:05:02.770> around<00:05:03.009> the
