and you're just like a small piece of a
really<00:01:52.659> big<00:01:52.780> puzzle<00:01:53.259> it's<00:01:53.409> harder<00:01:53.770> to<00:01:53.950> get

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100 
really big puzzle it's harder to get

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.039 
really big puzzle it's harder to get
that<00:01:54.460> one-on-one<00:01:54.729> time<00:01:55.030> with<00:01:55.299> your<00:01:55.600> agents

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:56.049 
that one-on-one time with your agents

00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:57.840 
that one-on-one time with your agents
because<00:01:56.289> they're<00:01:56.469> so<00:01:56.679> busy<00:01:56.950> and<00:01:57.219> it<00:01:57.369> pulled<00:01:57.640> in

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
because they're so busy and it pulled in

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:59.459 
because they're so busy and it pulled in
so<00:01:58.000> many<00:01:58.119> directions<00:01:58.329> they<00:01:58.990> kind<00:01:59.200> of<00:01:59.229> have<00:01:59.350> to

00:01:59.459 --> 00:01:59.469 
so many directions they kind of have to

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:02.160 
so many directions they kind of have to
prioritize<00:01:59.729> who<00:02:00.729> they<00:02:01.570> give<00:02:01.750> their<00:02:01.929> time<00:02:02.140> to

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 
prioritize who they give their time to

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.289 
prioritize who they give their time to
and<00:02:02.530> how<00:02:02.649> they<00:02:02.829> use<00:02:03.039> their<00:02:03.250> time<00:02:03.490> now<00:02:03.819> my<00:02:03.969> agent

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:04.299 
and how they use their time now my agent

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:06.679 
and how they use their time now my agent
is<00:02:04.390> really<00:02:04.659> busy<00:02:04.840> but<00:02:05.229> when<00:02:05.350> I<00:02:05.380> call<00:02:05.710> her<00:02:05.920> to

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
is really busy but when I call her to

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.059 
is really busy but when I call her to
ask<00:02:07.689> her<00:02:07.929> a<00:02:07.960> question<00:02:08.140> or<00:02:08.649> see<00:02:08.830> what<00:02:08.950> she

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:09.069 
ask her a question or see what she

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:10.740 
ask her a question or see what she
thinks<00:02:09.220> about<00:02:09.429> some<00:02:09.819> photos<00:02:10.179> I<00:02:10.420> maybe<00:02:10.569> just

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
thinks about some photos I maybe just

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:12.539 
thinks about some photos I maybe just
took<00:02:11.170> like<00:02:11.319> she<00:02:11.470> always<00:02:11.680> takes<00:02:12.069> the<00:02:12.160> time<00:02:12.430> to

00:02:12.539 --> 00:02:12.549 
took like she always takes the time to

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:14.339 
took like she always takes the time to
look<00:02:12.670> at<00:02:12.849> them<00:02:13.000> but<00:02:13.450> her<00:02:13.569> time<00:02:13.780> is<00:02:13.959> very

00:02:14.339 --> 00:02:14.349 
look at them but her time is very

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:16.140 
look at them but her time is very
limited<00:02:14.860> because<00:02:15.400> there's<00:02:15.670> so<00:02:15.790> much<00:02:15.910> talent

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
limited because there's so much talent

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.809 
limited because there's so much talent
that<00:02:16.450> she<00:02:16.629> represents<00:02:17.290> another<00:02:17.860> major<00:02:18.400> con

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:18.819

trying to sign with the big agency is

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.850 
trying to sign with the big agency is
that<00:02:23.250> less<00:02:24.250> than<00:02:24.489> 1%<00:02:25.269> of<00:02:25.450> models<00:02:25.930> sign<00:02:26.230> with<00:02:26.650> a

of one-on-one time because they're

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:49.800 
of one-on-one time because they're
smaller<00:02:48.489> you<00:02:48.700> can<00:02:48.849> see<00:02:49.000> they<00:02:49.150> don't<00:02:49.329> sign<00:02:49.569> as

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
smaller you can see they don't sign as

on a smaller part of the market so they

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:24.180

with<00:04:08.470> the<00:04:08.560> small<00:04:08.770> agency<00:04:09.160> is<00:04:09.280> that<00:04:09.459> they

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:09.610 
with the small agency is that they

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:11.550 
with the small agency is that they
usually<00:04:09.790> don't<00:04:10.150> have<00:04:10.390> locations<00:04:10.840> anywhere

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
usually don't have locations anywhere

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.020 
usually don't have locations anywhere
else<00:04:11.739> and<00:04:12.070> you<00:04:12.130> have<00:04:12.310> to<00:04:12.519> go<00:04:12.640> to<00:04:12.700> a<00:04:12.790> different

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.030 
else and you have to go to a different

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:15.720 
else and you have to go to a different
agency<00:04:13.360> if<00:04:13.989> you<00:04:14.170> want<00:04:14.350> to<00:04:14.440> sign<00:04:14.590> in<00:04:14.650> New<00:04:15.489> York

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:15.730 
agency if you want to sign in New York

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:17.250 
agency if you want to sign in New York
or<00:04:16.030> from<00:04:16.150> one<00:04:16.239> sign<00:04:16.419> in<00:04:16.450> Miami<00:04:16.900> we're<00:04:17.140> at<00:04:17.230> a

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:17.260 
or from one sign in Miami we're at a

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:18.720 
or from one sign in Miami we're at a
different<00:04:17.680> location<00:04:17.919> or<00:04:18.310> in<00:04:18.489> a<00:04:18.549> different

different location or in a different

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:21.720 
different location or in a different
market<00:04:19.269> so<00:04:19.419> that's<00:04:19.660> kind<00:04:20.049> of<00:04:20.169> a<00:04:20.380> major<00:04:20.980> con<00:04:21.400> for

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:21.730 
market so that's kind of a major con for

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:23.340 
market so that's kind of a major con for
signing<00:04:22.030> with<00:04:22.120> the<00:04:22.210> smaller<00:04:22.450> agency<00:04:22.900> the

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:23.350 
signing with the smaller agency the

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:25.020 
signing with the smaller agency the
smaller<00:04:23.590> agencies<00:04:24.070> usually<00:04:24.310> work<00:04:24.669> with<00:04:24.850> you

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:25.030 
smaller agencies usually work with you

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:28.260 
smaller agencies usually work with you
to<00:04:25.540> match<00:04:26.290> you<00:04:26.500> up<00:04:26.530> with<00:04:26.940> agencies<00:04:27.940> in<00:04:27.970> other

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:28.270 
to match you up with agencies in other

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:30.330 
to match you up with agencies in other
cities<00:04:28.630> if<00:04:28.990> they<00:04:29.200> don't<00:04:29.410> have<00:04:29.590> agencies<00:04:30.130> there

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:30.340 
cities if they don't have agencies there

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:32.730 
cities if they don't have agencies there
of<00:04:30.460> course<00:04:30.669> so<00:04:30.940> I<00:04:31.150> think<00:04:31.240> that's<00:04:31.750> about<00:04:31.900> it<00:04:32.260> for

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:32.740 
of course so I think that's about it for

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.520 
of course so I think that's about it for
the<00:04:33.700> pros<00:04:33.940> and<00:04:34.150> cons<00:04:34.450> for<00:04:34.690> big<00:04:35.020> agencies

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:35.530 
the pros and cons for big agencies

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:38.219 
the pros and cons for big agencies
