to<00:00:17.820> understand<00:00:18.330> and<00:00:18.710> wasn't<00:00:19.710> really<00:00:19.920> well

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
to understand and wasn't really well

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.189 
to understand and wasn't really well
thought<00:00:20.430> out<00:00:20.490> I<00:00:20.609> guess<00:00:20.939> but<00:00:21.300> that's<00:00:22.020> what<00:00:22.140> I'm
