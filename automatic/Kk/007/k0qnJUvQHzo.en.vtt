sharpen using Stone Age tools just took

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:18.800 
sharpen using Stone Age tools just took
a<00:02:16.890> big<00:02:17.040> rap<00:02:17.280> and<00:02:17.549> dropped<00:02:18.030> it<00:02:18.209> and<00:02:18.450> the<00:02:18.629> thing

obsidian<00:02:26.670> chert<00:02:27.299> Flint<00:02:28.019> would<00:02:28.170> work

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:28.349 
obsidian chert Flint would work

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:30.410 
obsidian chert Flint would work
especially<00:02:28.620> well<00:02:29.069> we<00:02:29.519> don't<00:02:29.700> have<00:02:29.819> that<00:02:29.939> here
