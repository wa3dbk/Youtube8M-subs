00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
change of like one letter and it I think

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.220 
change of like one letter and it I think
like<00:00:44.879> it<00:00:45.329> goes<00:00:45.510> for<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.750> same<00:00:45.960> with<00:00:46.250> Luigi<00:00:47.250> and

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:48.230 
like it goes for the same with Luigi and

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.709 
like it goes for the same with Luigi and
waluigi<00:00:49.230> even<00:00:49.649> though<00:00:49.739> it's<00:00:49.890> like<00:00:50.570> adding<00:00:51.570> a

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
waluigi even though it's like adding a

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.220 
waluigi even though it's like adding a
couple<00:00:51.930> more<00:00:52.079> letters<00:00:52.469> for<00:00:52.649> waluigi<00:00:52.920> like
