Canadian production from the welds on
the<00:02:23.620> frame<00:02:23.950> all<00:02:24.220> the<00:02:24.489> way<00:02:24.639> to<00:02:24.700> put<00:02:25.000> them<00:02:25.120> on<00:02:25.150> a

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:25.239 
the frame all the way to put them on a

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:28.920 
the frame all the way to put them on a
crate<00:02:25.510> so<00:02:26.319> that's<00:02:26.560> one<00:02:26.859> secondly<00:02:27.900> we<00:02:28.900> are

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
crate so that's one secondly we are

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:30.330 
crate so that's one secondly we are
there<00:02:29.200> every<00:02:29.230> three<00:02:29.709> months<00:02:29.859> to<00:02:30.040> make<00:02:30.310> sure

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
there every three months to make sure

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.500 
there every three months to make sure
that<00:02:30.819> all<00:02:31.389> certain<00:02:32.260> issues<00:02:32.560> technically

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
that all certain issues technically

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.899 
that all certain issues technically
quality<00:02:34.290> issues<00:02:34.620> I<00:02:34.950> would<00:02:35.040> revise<00:02:35.459> by<00:02:35.760> our

00:02:35.899 --> 00:02:35.909 
quality issues I would revise by our

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:37.729 
quality issues I would revise by our
management<00:02:36.300> with<00:02:36.930> the<00:02:37.050> CF<00:02:37.290> Model<00:02:37.590> Management

we finalize the product or retail twenty
thousand<00:02:53.519> kilometers<00:02:53.879> on<00:02:54.000> this<00:02:54.180> absolutely

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
thousand kilometers on this absolutely

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.170 
thousand kilometers on this absolutely
that's<00:02:55.230> a<00:02:55.379> little<00:02:55.560> huh<00:02:55.680> and<00:02:55.920> it's<00:02:56.129> done<00:02:56.370> quite
