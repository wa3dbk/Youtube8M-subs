00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209 
off a couple of corners from him so I

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:26.670 
off a couple of corners from him so I
definitely<00:02:25.599> did<00:02:25.930> like<00:02:26.140> that<00:02:26.290> about<00:02:26.439> him

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
definitely did like that about him

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.619 
definitely did like that about him
because<00:02:27.040> once<00:02:27.489> again<00:02:27.579> I<00:02:27.760> mean<00:02:27.969> I<00:02:28.000> feel<00:02:28.450> like

00:02:28.619 --> 00:02:28.629 
because once again I mean I feel like

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:30.270 
because once again I mean I feel like
it's<00:02:28.900> kind<00:02:29.019> of<00:02:29.139> hard<00:02:29.409> to<00:02:29.500> squirt<00:02:29.829> off<00:02:29.889> corners

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
it's kind of hard to squirt off corners

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.910 
it's kind of hard to squirt off corners
so<00:02:30.519> with<00:02:30.939> cruising<00:02:31.389> is<00:02:31.510> 88<00:02:32.079> crossing<00:02:32.650> it

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
so with cruising is 88 crossing it

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.709 
so with cruising is 88 crossing it
definitely<00:02:33.400> made<00:02:33.609> things<00:02:33.639> a<00:02:34.000> lot<00:02:34.180> easier<00:02:34.450> for

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:34.719 
definitely made things a lot easier for

00:02:34.719 --> 00:02:37.020 
definitely made things a lot easier for
me<00:02:34.959> that's<00:02:35.409> moving<00:02:35.620> on<00:02:35.859> he<00:02:36.129> has<00:02:36.370> some<00:02:36.639> very

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
me that's moving on he has some very

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:38.910 
me that's moving on he has some very
solid<00:02:37.540> dribble<00:02:38.139> on<00:02:38.260> them<00:02:38.290> as<00:02:38.469> well<00:02:38.650> me

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
solid dribble on them as well me

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.399 
solid dribble on them as well me
definitely<00:02:39.609> a<00:02:39.639> bigger<00:02:40.150> upgrade<00:02:40.659> than<00:02:40.870> last

00:02:41.399 --> 00:02:41.409 
definitely a bigger upgrade than last

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:43.319 
definitely a bigger upgrade than last
FIFA's<00:02:41.920> last<00:02:42.129> FIFA<00:02:42.489> I<00:02:42.700> don't<00:02:42.939> know<00:02:43.030> why<00:02:43.150> his

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:43.329 
FIFA's last FIFA I don't know why his

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:45.179 
FIFA's last FIFA I don't know why his
dribbling<00:02:43.780> just<00:02:43.989> did<00:02:44.109> not<00:02:44.230> seem<00:02:44.560> like<00:02:44.739> it<00:02:44.769> was

00:02:45.179 --> 00:02:45.189 
dribbling just did not seem like it was

00:02:45.189 --> 00:02:46.619 
dribbling just did not seem like it was
that<00:02:45.250> good<00:02:45.639> but<00:02:45.819> this<00:02:45.970> free<00:02:46.180> foot<00:02:46.389> it

00:02:46.619 --> 00:02:46.629 
that good but this free foot it

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:47.879 
that good but this free foot it
definitely<00:02:46.989> felt<00:02:47.230> like<00:02:47.379> it<00:02:47.530> was<00:02:47.620> good<00:02:47.769> because

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:47.889 
definitely felt like it was good because

00:02:47.889 --> 00:02:50.280 
definitely felt like it was good because
I<00:02:48.099> I<00:02:48.310> almost<00:02:48.970> pretty<00:02:49.299> much<00:02:49.450> ran<00:02:49.900> through<00:02:50.260> the

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
I I almost pretty much ran through the

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.559 
I I almost pretty much ran through the
entire<00:02:50.829> team<00:02:51.220> was<00:02:51.669> rated<00:02:51.939> up<00:02:52.030> to<00:02:52.060> his<00:02:52.299> next

00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:52.569 
entire team was rated up to his next

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:56.520 
entire team was rated up to his next
point<00:02:52.840> his<00:02:53.169> paces<00:02:53.799> pace<00:02:54.099> was<00:02:54.430> I<00:02:54.939> mean<00:02:55.720> it<00:02:56.260> feels

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
point his paces pace was I mean it feels

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.379 
point his paces pace was I mean it feels
faster<00:02:57.069> than<00:02:57.219> what<00:02:57.340> it<00:02:57.459> shows<00:02:57.639> on<00:02:57.819> a<00:02:57.849> car<00:02:58.150> but

00:02:58.379 --> 00:02:58.389 
faster than what it shows on a car but

00:02:58.389 --> 00:03:00.690 
faster than what it shows on a car but
it<00:02:58.510> definitely<00:02:58.900> isn't<00:02:59.349> that<00:02:59.739> rapping<00:03:00.310> I<00:03:00.459> mean

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
it definitely isn't that rapping I mean

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.819 
it definitely isn't that rapping I mean
the<00:03:01.659> reason<00:03:01.870> I<00:03:02.109> was<00:03:02.260> able<00:03:02.290> to<00:03:02.500> get<00:03:02.620> through

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:02.829 
the reason I was able to get through

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:04.289 
the reason I was able to get through
places<00:03:03.040> mainly<00:03:03.340> because<00:03:03.609> of<00:03:03.819> his<00:03:03.909> dribbling

00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:04.299 
places mainly because of his dribbling

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:05.699 
places mainly because of his dribbling
because<00:03:04.599> he<00:03:04.719> does<00:03:04.959> have<00:03:04.989> some<00:03:05.200> pretty<00:03:05.500> good

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
because he does have some pretty good

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:07.830 
because he does have some pretty good
dribbling<00:03:06.099> in<00:03:06.189> this<00:03:06.340> game<00:03:06.579> but<00:03:07.060> pace<00:03:07.299> wise<00:03:07.569> I

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
dribbling in this game but pace wise I

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.530 
dribbling in this game but pace wise I
mean<00:03:08.019> he<00:03:08.230> is<00:03:08.409> actually<00:03:09.250> really<00:03:09.669> slow<00:03:10.060> I<00:03:10.090> mean

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
mean he is actually really slow I mean

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.659 
mean he is actually really slow I mean
he's<00:03:11.139> not<00:03:11.349> as<00:03:11.530> slow<00:03:11.680> as<00:03:11.709> a<00:03:11.889> 50<00:03:12.310> pace<00:03:12.519> he

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:12.669 
he's not as slow as a 50 pace he

00:03:12.669 --> 00:03:14.879 
he's not as slow as a 50 pace he
probably<00:03:12.879> feels<00:03:13.150> like<00:03:13.299> he's<00:03:13.599> in<00:03:13.629> like<00:03:14.109> the<00:03:14.349> 60s

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:14.889 
probably feels like he's in like the 60s

00:03:14.889 --> 00:03:16.979 
probably feels like he's in like the 60s
which<00:03:15.400> actually<00:03:15.700> isn't<00:03:16.150> bad<00:03:16.359> because<00:03:16.870> I

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:16.989 
which actually isn't bad because I

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:18.689 
which actually isn't bad because I
normally<00:03:17.530> do<00:03:17.620> not<00:03:17.799> mind<00:03:18.099> pace<00:03:18.459> and

00:03:18.689 --> 00:03:18.699 
normally do not mind pace and

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:21.659 
normally do not mind pace and
midfielders<00:03:19.359> but<00:03:20.319> some<00:03:20.650> people<00:03:20.949> do<00:03:21.099> but<00:03:21.609> I

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:21.669 
midfielders but some people do but I

00:03:21.669 --> 00:03:23.729 
midfielders but some people do but I
