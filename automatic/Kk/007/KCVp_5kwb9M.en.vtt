00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:17.260
 in the shiny fans section we have a 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:20.350
 fanatic who asks us how to use 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:22.150
 the 3d signature hd 3 first for 

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:25.270
 those fans who do not know about 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:28.029
 what it's about hd 3 is a conditioner and 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:30.689
 plastics and rubber protector for 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:30.689
 outside part 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:38.210
 what has advantages a lot first 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:40.520
 that is not a sticky second product 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:43.040
 it does not have a formula that leaves the touch 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:45.620
 a greasy feeling and also has 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.780
 long duration based on its polymers 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.400
 that have good anchoring when one 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.920
 Apply on the cover remember that 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.989
 on surfaces not painted in this 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.460
 Case can be the plastic moldings 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:57.620
 of the drumsticks can be those for 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:00.110
 others that are not painted part of the 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.180
 mirrors and on the covers if we want 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:03.830
 that the cover is as new as 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.289
 when we buy a vehicle and do not have 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:07.729
 excess product we apply on the 

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:09.800
 microfiber applicator on all the 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:13.840
 cover we increase it well and with a 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.840
 Dry and clean cloth we remove 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.300
 the same thing is done in plastics now 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.460
 be careful the plastics of not 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:27.200
 use the sprayer what they have to 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:30.410
 to do is always apply it on a 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:32.360
 applicator of that applicator for the area 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:34.520
 of the plastics and then with a cloth 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.500
 dry will regulate the intensity if 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.720
 they want it to be shiny they do not remove the 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.240
 product if they want a matte finish 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:44.290
 or semi-matt they are cleaning until 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.290
 achieve the desired brightness 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.189
 that was the advice we have here in 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.960
 saint and fans and as I always tell you 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:06.530
 is having much more 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.530
 sainz and crankcase
