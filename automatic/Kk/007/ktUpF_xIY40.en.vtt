00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:06.470
 good morning and then video recipe 

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:08.839
 I think the effect is perfect in 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:10.969
 sense in my opinion is very practical because 

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:13.219
 today I use gnocchi and therefore it is one 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:15.169
 something to do, however, momentary 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:16.820
 usually use the link you are using 

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:19.010
 manage to keep the cooking for which 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.690
 if we have a hint of more than 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:22.450
 I prepare in the morning or in the middle 

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:24.620
 morning and then put them in the oven for 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:27.170
 few minutes for heated sheets 

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:29.300
 be doing the crust below and believe me 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:31.760
 the gnocchi crust that is me 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:34.970
 coming to this this time is some 

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:37.190
 I leave the highway thing 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:38.930
 videorecetta obviously always easy 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.840
 obviously always fast of course 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:46.820
 always practical is obviously very good 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:49.630
 but this I first make known 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:52.610
 the tomato with a little olive oil 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:55.850
 some garlic I've written is a pinch 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:59.270
 of pepper the water boils 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.890
 but I before cooking the gnocchi where 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:04.699
 have everything ready for him 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:08.060
 dumplings take a breath and are 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:10.580
 ready then cut a nice diced 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.840
 little piece of Galbanino or if you have the 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:18.820
 mozzarella only mozzarella 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:22.970
 releases a little too much art and cheese 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:26.960
 I must have an affront a nice piece 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:31.840
 paper aluminum card set 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:39.100
 the gnocchi can be lowered to it 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:41.780
 age the eyes cook the gnocchi 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:44.869
 they are ready when they come back up 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:48.890
 surface really takes nothing one 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:52.430
 couple of minutes are ready then ready 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:54.970
 the or drains add all the 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:54.970
 commodore 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:05.470
 a pinch of oregano 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:05.470
 so it tastes just like pizza 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:23.920
 a part of the Galbanino is the other part 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:23.920
 but let's put it together later 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:38.240
 then to make the cartoccio do not create 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.730
 a big mess especially when still 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:44.000
 gnocchi are cuts of help with the 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:49.460
 bowl then I stop the baking paper 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:57.950
 in the athletic foil and transfer to 

00:02:49.460 --> 00:03:01.460
 dates back obviously I transfer everything in 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:06.160
 head or group already takes shape is 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:06.160
 the last in combination with a patatrac 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:19.480
 I add the rest of the Galbanino closes 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:37.360
 we must be very careful to close 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:39.190
 well then practicality i am using one 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.350
 casserole with lid because I did 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:43.750
 only the location a portion though 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:46.420
 when I do so many that maybe guests 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:49.780
 and I make 56 papers 10 cartocci because 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:51.880
 they also often use the Sardinians there 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:54.069
 put in the pan and put them in the oven 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:57.040
 it's almost the same thing 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:59.230
 right now hurry up so I set fire 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.690
 very low puts the lid is the 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:05.230
 I leave for at least 5 minutes because I want to 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:06.840
 the crust then I moved the 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:08.670
 medium cartoccio on serving plate 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.440
 wow 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:13.630
 you understand why I put the electroplating 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:20.500
 so stop was look how nice I add 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:21.970
 a nice sprinkle of oregano the 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:25.780
 dish is ready 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:29.350
 look is an easy version though 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:32.289
 absolutely perfect and fanciful for 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:34.450
 make people the usual dumplings 

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:38.340
 I hope you have this video recipe 

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:38.340
 liked it and the next
