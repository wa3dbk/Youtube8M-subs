today<00:00:45.510> so<00:00:45.570> it's<00:00:46.140> really<00:00:46.320> close<00:00:46.559> to<00:00:46.620> Christmas

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
today so it's really close to Christmas

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.950 
today so it's really close to Christmas
or<00:00:47.250> it's<00:00:47.370> close<00:00:47.579> for<00:00:47.879> you<00:00:48.420> know<00:00:48.570> ordering

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
online anyway it's kind of touchy

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.369 
online anyway it's kind of touchy
because<00:00:50.899> shipping<00:00:51.899> times<00:00:52.110> are<00:00:52.260> usually

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
because shipping times are usually

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.709 
because shipping times are usually
doubled<00:00:52.980> so<00:00:53.399> it's<00:00:54.030> just<00:00:54.120> a<00:00:54.270> small<00:00:54.420> and

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
doubled so it's just a small and

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.959 
doubled so it's just a small and

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.870 
that I had and my buddy actually had the
same<00:03:00.540> one<00:03:01.220> different<00:03:02.220> graphic<00:03:02.549> but<00:03:02.700> he<00:03:02.790> had

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
same one different graphic but he had

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.150 
same one different graphic but he had
the<00:03:02.970> classic<00:03:03.209> shape<00:03:03.480> as<00:03:03.660> well<00:03:03.840> and<00:03:04.079> the<00:03:04.859> tail

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
the classic shape as well and the tail

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.370 
the classic shape as well and the tail
on<00:03:05.400> the<00:03:05.430> classic<00:03:05.910> shape<00:03:06.090> was<00:03:06.690> longer<00:03:07.169> and

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
on the classic shape was longer and

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.949 
on the classic shape was longer and
higher<00:03:07.769> than<00:03:08.310> the<00:03:08.430> nose<00:03:08.609> but<00:03:09.329> it's<00:03:09.540> exactly

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
higher than the nose but it's exactly

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:11.900 
higher than the nose but it's exactly
the<00:03:10.169> opposite<00:03:10.590> on<00:03:10.739> this<00:03:10.950> the<00:03:11.459> tail<00:03:11.700> is<00:03:11.880> a

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
the opposite on this the tail is a

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:15.460 
the opposite on this the tail is a
little<00:03:12.180> bit<00:03:12.299> shorter<00:03:12.750> and<00:03:13.549> it<00:03:14.549> does<00:03:14.819> sit<00:03:15.120> lower

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
little bit shorter and it does sit lower

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:17.330 
little bit shorter and it does sit lower
so<00:03:16.470> that's<00:03:16.620> really<00:03:16.859> cool

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
so that's really cool

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.400 
so that's really cool
this<00:03:17.849> looks<00:03:18.090> like<00:03:18.209> it's<00:03:18.419> medium<00:03:18.780> cakes<00:03:19.019> medium

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
this looks like it's medium cakes medium

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:21.550 
this looks like it's medium cakes medium
concave<00:03:19.859> medium<00:03:20.519> to<00:03:20.639> high<00:03:20.760> kicks<00:03:21.180> but

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
concave medium to high kicks but

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.539 
concave medium to high kicks but
definitely<00:03:22.560> medium<00:03:22.889> concave<00:03:23.750> really<00:03:24.750> nice

00:03:25.539 --> 00:03:25.549 
definitely medium concave really nice

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:28.099 
definitely medium concave really nice

the more narrow tail it's exactly

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.810 
the more narrow tail it's exactly
different<00:04:00.270> sight<00:04:01.100> that's<00:04:02.100> really<00:04:02.340> cool<00:04:02.580> and

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:02.820 
different sight that's really cool and

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:05.570 
different sight that's really cool and
the<00:04:03.600> graphics<00:04:04.380> are<00:04:04.470> by<00:04:04.650> Berlin<00:04:05.040> woods<00:04:05.220> so<00:04:05.430> you

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:05.580 
the graphics are by Berlin woods so you

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:07.070 
the graphics are by Berlin woods so you
know<00:04:05.760> you<00:04:05.910> got<00:04:06.030> the<00:04:06.180> where<00:04:06.360> graphics<00:04:06.840> on<00:04:06.990> the

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:07.080 
know you got the where graphics on the

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:10.130 
know you got the where graphics on the
Bali<00:04:07.290> as<00:04:08.280> well<00:04:08.610> and<00:04:08.910> I<00:04:09.420> believe<00:04:09.900> these<00:04:10.080> are

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:10.140 
Bali as well and I believe these are

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:11.750 
Bali as well and I believe these are
either<00:04:10.380> thirty<00:04:10.830> or<00:04:11.040> thirty<00:04:11.250> point<00:04:11.520> five

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
either thirty or thirty point five

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.540 
either thirty or thirty point five
millimeters<00:04:12.390> wide<00:04:13.350> I'm<00:04:13.740> not<00:04:13.980> exactly<00:04:14.340> sure

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:14.550 
millimeters wide I'm not exactly sure

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:16.820 
millimeters wide I'm not exactly sure
how<00:04:14.910> long<00:04:15.090> but<00:04:15.360> I<00:04:15.390> definitely<00:04:16.110> bigger<00:04:16.560> than<00:04:16.650> a

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:16.830 
how long but I definitely bigger than a

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:20.180 
how long but I definitely bigger than a
