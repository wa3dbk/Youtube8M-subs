00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660 
too because this is actually a pretty

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:18.360 
too because this is actually a pretty
small<00:03:16.959> cage<00:03:17.319> and<00:03:17.680> it<00:03:17.859> doesn't<00:03:18.160> give<00:03:18.340> you

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
small cage and it doesn't give you

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:23.449 
small cage and it doesn't give you
enough<00:03:18.639> room<00:03:19.480> to<00:03:19.810> point<00:03:20.109> anything<00:03:21.540> like<00:03:22.540> and

enough room to point anything like and

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:26.640 
enough room to point anything like and

important<00:04:22.890> for<00:04:23.190> your<00:04:23.550> hamster<00:04:24.330> sites<00:04:24.630> have

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:24.930 
important for your hamster sites have

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:27.890 
important for your hamster sites have
fruits<00:04:25.290> and<00:04:25.530> vegetables<00:04:26.419> like<00:04:27.419> she<00:04:27.690> likes
