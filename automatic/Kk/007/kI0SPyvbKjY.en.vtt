 try titans fault and they will also be 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:39.220
 guinea pigs since they themselves 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:41.680
 will be those who try first hand 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:43.630
 of the title the possible errors and good 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.910
 Well also of course give your opinion 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:47.800
 about how this title goes by the way 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:49.540
 the video that we are seeing is the new 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:52.210
 video that has been distributed so 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:54.700
 official in which several 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:56.620
 news that we had not seen until the 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:59.110
 also tell you that the beta 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:01.030
 begins on February 14 but has not 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:03.760
 given a closing date that yes no what 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:05.680
 confuse with the registration date or 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.360
 reception of requests that you already know 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.100
 which is until the next day 17 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.810
 but the beta does not know when it's going to 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.790
 finish exactly as to the 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.040
 content of the beta we will find three 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:16.990
 different game modes one called to 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:19.600
 prison in which a team should 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.970
 eliminate another one called hard point 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:25.270
 domination in which a king of the hill 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:27.550
 will have three capture zones and then there are 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:30.340
 another one called the titan extending 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:32.380
 each player will have a titan from the 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.780
 principle and will fight all against all 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:37.570
 The truth is that it seems that it will be 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.910
 fun in that multiplayer mode that 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:41.680
 you know what is the premium and the only thing 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:44.110
 that you will have in this titan fall for 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.670
 So much has to enhance the quality of 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.259
 same for the last time and the 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.180
 users who want to participate in the 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:51.550
 beta will need a user account 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:55.360
 in origin if you want to enjoy the 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:58.960
 beta on pc or a live xbox account on 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.970
 xbox one unfortunately the xbox 360 does not 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.190
 is going to have that possibility that their 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:05.020
 users are part of the beta but 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:07.509
 Well of course they have wanted to remember 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.610
 that the beta the titans fall is not your 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:11.380
 final code and represents only one 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:13.520
 small fraction of the content of the game 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.380
 and what to test the game 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.810
 since its launch, it will help 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:21.550
 its creators to create a better product 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.550
 final as in any beta
