 placed like this this is what our 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.739
 clients do not see each other today but 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:57.440
 we disbursed about 450 million 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:59.329
 monthly pesos to finance projects 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.070
 productive of our clients and 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:02.190
 sales from where do you get everything 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.930
 this money 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.240
 an advantage that we have eduardo 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.220
 we are a popular financial society and 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.380
 in fact we are the biggest Sofipos of 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.630
 microfinance that there is in Mexico 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.180
 and we fund 40 percent 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.250
 we finance it with savings 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.440
 popular with saving from the same community 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.940
 and the truth that we are very proud 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.890
 to be able to say that we are one of the few 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.960
 microfinance institutions of mexico 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.030
 that we really grasp now this is 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.670
 like a savings bank what is the 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.979
 difference between a sofipo and a box 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.590
 of savings a credit union something like that 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:37.340
 similar to this let's say society 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.570
 popular finance is a figure that 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:42.420
 emerges in 2006 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.880
 durban in 2001 sorry is a figure 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.679
 new tacuaras of the frauds that 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.300
 there was in the savings banks there with 

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:51.869
 robben bayern I remember until a 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:54.420
 distinguished colleague of a competitor in 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.789
 the radio found out he did not know it was 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.740
 secretary general or who was secretary 

00:01:56.789 --> 00:02:00.780
 of the board of directors after 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.940
 the other scams said I did not know that 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.920
 If I did not find out at a good time 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.780
 as a result of that the law of saving and 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.819
 popular credit in which it is sought 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.259
 regulate both the savings banks 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.900
 create this figure of a financial company 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.609
 popular whose main difference is that 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.069
 in savings banks they are all partners 

00:02:14.609 --> 00:02:19.019
 to be able to receive services from the box 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:21.420
 you have to be partners and understand your 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:23.069
 team are not teeth are clients well 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.599
 it's interesting is a big difference is 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:25.530
 a big difference let's say from the sun or the 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:26.879
 the moon stings 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.609
 in the offices of investors 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:31.610
 private there is no private capital and with 

00:02:29.609 --> 00:02:35.840
 that we serve clients 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:38.300
 now when when you say you have 280 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:41.360
 thousand customers is the face if it is demanding 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:43.100
 if this they ask for cake and how much is it 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.620
 that they borrow what really is 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:47.810
 the average credit us 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.220
 loans from 1500 pesos to 40 thousand 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.920
 pesos and average credit 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.910
 disbursed of 5 thousand 700 pesos of 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.980
 done we also have a credit 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.810
 average down for the industry because 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.810
 came 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:01.250
 the mission of each month to support to fight 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.830
 poverty had productive activity 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:06.680
 and if we look at poverty by creating 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:08.810
 and then wealth is lares 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.130
 we have a population one more population 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:13.190
 marginalized and if we have a credit 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:14.720
 average lower than the industry but 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.640
 it reflects the social commitment that 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.650
 we have to attend to attend to the 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.360
 people with fewer resources there are for 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:22.450
 that not for those who fortunately not 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:25.120
 we belong to those levels 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:27.760
 when one thinks a credit of 5 thousand 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.170
 pesos let's say the truth is five thousand 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.870
 pesos do not think it like a credit 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:34.810
 lately it is an income to an expense in 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:36.819
 the middle class levels up but 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:39.670
 so you can ask someone five thousand 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:42.970
 pesos as credit give an example to see 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:45.459
 this or buy candy or buy 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:47.290
 merchandise to start we have several 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:49.380
 customers who started selling sweets 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:51.370
 with a small table outside his house 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:53.110
 they started maybe with a loan of two 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:54.489
 thousand or three thousand pesos renew a 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:56.500
 loan of five thousand then maybe of 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:58.390
 seven thousand are growing and we have the 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.340
 we see many stories that they have a 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:02.349
 small table selling sweets and today has a 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.120
 miscellany very well stocked with all 

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:06.579
 the products and they are the mass the year of the 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:08.860
 community that is already a micro 

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:10.660
 they are already small businesses and it is or the other 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:13.230
 people who start buying a 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:14.909
 old sewing machine maybe 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.530
 when the first financing and the 

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:18.359
 mine that are getting new 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:20.970
 financing changed by machines 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:22.530
 new buy 34 machines and some 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:24.930
 they begin to generate jobs is 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:27.000
 really impressive the ability to 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:28.530
 work that these people have that in 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.990
 most of the time its level 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:32.790
 educational is low but it has a claw 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:34.290
 a tenacity a desire to leave 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:36.540
 forward that what they achieve is 

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:39.180
 impressive as how do you overcome this 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:40.830
 barrier of low educational level because 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:42.900
 in a moment it can be a problem 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:46.139
 because the positive attitude is not enough 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:48.210
 presents an aptitude not knowing what 

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:50.610
 is doing one that both participates 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:53.039
 came in what is to train their 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:55.080
 customers here in the studio will tell you the 

00:04:53.039 --> 00:04:55.590
 attitude already have the claw and the 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.870
 they have 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:00.090
 have me, we encourage the initiative of the 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:02.460
 of the ladies of the gentlemen who 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:04.320
 they want to boost a business 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:06.030
 there is a lot of training in the group but 

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:07.620
 The main change training is 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:10.710
 to develop a financial culture 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:13.169
 although that is to say in the group they learn the 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:14.760
 habit of saving they learn what is their 

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:17.430
 capacity your indebtedness capacity 

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:18.780
 to really be able to pay the loan and 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:19.770
 they learn to assess the ability of 

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:22.050
 indebtedness 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:24.030
 of the other members of the group as 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:25.919
 is a solidarity guarantee loan if 

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:27.780
 dona lupe does not pay the rest of the group 

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:29.430
 have to pay for dona lupe then 

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:31.800
 that's why the evaluation of dona lupe is very 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:33.870
 very important then develop a 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:35.789
 ability to evaluate your ability to 

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:38.370
 payment and that of his companions on the one hand 

00:05:35.789 --> 00:05:40.259
 and it will be a capacity a training 

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:42.840
 very interesting side in the group is 

00:05:40.259 --> 00:05:44.759
 say doña lupe doña tere raises the 

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:46.530
 business you want to do and the same 

00:05:44.759 --> 00:05:48.479
 members of the group that are in the 

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:50.520
 community can you hear doña tere 

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:52.319
 this business here is not going to walk you do not 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:54.300
 It is convenient here in the market for it 

00:05:52.319 --> 00:05:56.340
 then there is a lateral training 

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:57.990
 very interesting when you say doña lupe 

00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:01.530
 of mediation of dona lupe adored by 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:04.580
 Dona Maria, health, if there is not much gift 

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:07.169
 pepe nor don toño 85 percent women 

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:09.720
 15% men because again and it is the 

00:06:07.169 --> 00:06:12.810
 question he says to fernando 

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:14.520
 for a while because the women I had the 

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:16.800
 methodology is more conducive for women 

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:18.240
 on the one hand and the reality we have 

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:19.979
 men who pay extraordinarily 

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:21.509
 ok but we have seen that in this 

00:06:19.979 --> 00:06:23.460
 population sector 

00:06:21.509 --> 00:06:24.700
 the woman better manage the expense that 

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:26.980
 the man 

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:28.930
 and a woman is very is very unlikely 

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:31.930
 in this segment that waste the 

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:33.700
 resources harming their children is that 

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:35.560
 some men if they have some 

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:37.480
 temptations when they speak accents of 

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:40.450
 woman is a woman with children who really 

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:43.600
 the client I have the average age 

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:45.970
 35 years but we will have already three 

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:50.160
 generations of change clients 

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:52.180
 grannies moms and youngsters 22 23 years old 

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:55.030
 so is 

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:57.340
 something very interesting of the eduardo model 

00:06:55.030 --> 00:07:00.130
 It's Juan when a lady approaches 

00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:01.750
 change usually has no savings and 

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:04.480
 you need money to finance a 

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:06.010
 productive project when it ends 16 

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:07.540
 weeks later as in exchange 

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:10.450
 we encourage savings we promote the 

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:13.360
 Saving 16 weeks later has more or 

00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:15.190
 minus 30 for the 30% savings on the 

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:17.050
 loan amount is if you asked 

00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:19.120
 Five thousand pesos of loan must 

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:21.870
 finish with one thousand 500 pesos telephone 

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:21.870
 presents
