00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.570
 hi everyone is the legend x 

00:00:09.039 --> 00:00:12.280
 so in this special video of you 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:15.070
 present one by one all the cards 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:16.930
 pokemon ultra goes from the xy series 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:18.040
 so there are fourteen in total and 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:19.630
 despite the fact that I opened 

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:21.940
 a lot of booster this of this 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:22.930
 series including a display and 16 booster in 

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:25.840
 video as you may have discovered 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:27.490
 previously on my channel well i have 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.380
 had to invest in the purchase 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:31.990
 immediate of several of these cards 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:33.820
 ultra especially there the spirit it comes to me 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:36.219
 the xz reborn enough the iwelt to the ex 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.929
 scarf that cost me a lot that you 

00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:40.300
 find out later in this video 

00:00:37.929 --> 00:00:43.059
 so the cards are brand new min 1 and 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.559
 obviously French anyway 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:46.690
 I'm proud to show you if 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:49.390
 quickly all his ex and ex scarf 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:52.089
 and mega iex while this series xy does 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:53.979
 officially released on February 22 

00:00:52.089 --> 00:00:55.809
 by cons as you heard 

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:57.489
 unlike the latest black series 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:59.739
 and white there is no secret card 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:01.659
 so not to chain unfortunately 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:04.089
 I hope that pokémon reserves us that 

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:05.530
 for the next series xy we will see 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:07.030
 it would not hurt to see, for example 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.310
 exercise on arrival the talent 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:11.710
 shane and we could not even see on 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:12.910
 the pokemon games x and y managed 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:14.980
 we do not know at all what they 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:17.320
 look like for now go i'm going 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:20.050
 start by introducing you to the six 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:23.230
 ex pokemon cards so first of all we have 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:24.460
 the desire is therefore not two types and I 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:26.440
 wanted I did not want to present by 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.630
 number one so theirs right away the 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:32.020
 97th out of 146 in the set 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:34.500
 so here and well 146 cards in xy 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:37.560
 that she is sublime I love exercised at this 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:40.300
 very pretty with explosion x 140 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:43.450
 this is the first ultra type card 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:45.640
 fact that we can find so far very 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:48.490
 very nice behind we go on with the 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.790
 iwelt ali ex so here are the two 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:56.530
 legendary flagship of the series obviously 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:02:00.280
 it is the 79th out of 146 after we have the 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:02.500
 wrong as long as 180 p 120 bomb attacks 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.300
 splashing a very powerful like 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.250
 map very beautiful contrast to 1 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:08.319
 waters florise ares ix which is it 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:10.270
 really not very nice at all he has a 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:12.010
 dirty head I find but the tord tanks 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:13.069
 and manificat one can compare with them 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.950
 precisely not 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:17.120
 alas the florises to whom we have the fire draco 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.459
 but charizard I think it's going to be 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.530
 in the next flashfire series we 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:23.120
 can find both versions of 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.219
 dracaufeu of me entrusts x and draco 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:28.069
 slip it's going to be pretty interesting 

00:02:25.219 --> 00:02:31.069
 to have that towards I think it's 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:36.739
 but may 2014 and so after we have the r 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:40.459
 ripened ex here is 170 pvc the 80th out of 146 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:45.739
 yeah so not bad at all and then the and 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:47.510
 molgat ix this is very very very nice 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:49.459
 so low as we notice and has 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.949
 only two pokemon ix type 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:53.569
 legendary while in the black block 

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:55.069
 and white and down all x crosses 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:56.239
 were all legendary pokemon 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:58.569
 it is true that it was quite frustrating 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:01.579
 we still did not have roissy flames 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:05.180
 in the black and white block in ultra or 

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:07.219
 in any case the starters of the fifth 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:09.049
 generation nor for the moment the 

00:03:07.219 --> 00:03:11.930
 starters the sixth generation but that 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:14.389
 should happen with the grenoux it's 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:17.540
 all I think it's going to be late 

00:03:14.389 --> 00:03:20.629
 that the amphis nobile the in fine hobby 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:22.099
 is so brief so buy the x after 

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:24.409
 we go to x art crowd 

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:26.000
 so I put the two ex medals at the 

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:28.189
 end then the scarf ix that are 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.810
 exactly the same pokémon brace 

00:03:28.189 --> 00:03:30.829
 etc except when scarf so they are 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:33.979
 definitely more beautiful 

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:35.509
 we notice zernez ex scarf so she 

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:39.139
 is sublime one always the same card 

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:40.759
 170bp 140 da tax is the 146th out of 146 

00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:42.500
 so this is the last of the set but she 

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:44.209
 is super pretty or less honestly 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.680
 this is my favorite one especially do not hesitate 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:46.849
 not also to tell me in the 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.430
 comments a few all favorite 

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:51.019
 on his fourteen ultra I will be delighted to 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:53.000
 know what you think 

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:55.220
 So this is his last ex 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.329
 favorite is sublime unfortunately I 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:57.349
 did not have in boosters but hey 

00:03:56.329 --> 00:04:00.290
 it is not serious 

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:02.540
 as well as iv italy ex here is very 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:05.900
 very beautiful the dyed scarves that are 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:07.250
 beautiful is the 144th on 146 the 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:11.620
 thor tank not bad either the wrong so much 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:15.650
 he has his mouth very very nice 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:17.229
 I love this 142nd card on 146 so 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:21.079
 the scarves are really beautiful 

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:23.210
 the florida we took it back a little 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:24.139
 they have pretty well made Florise in Riex 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:25.310
 scarf that could have been worse 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:27.470
 unlike the x 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:30.530
 not pretty at all the art crowd that can 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:31.270
 go on we go with the and moldavie ex 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:35.000
 crowd art 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:37.460
 so here we can see effects if we 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.370
 touch the limit I removed the tops 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:42.770
 the smell obviously so they are on the 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:44.930
 side I took them off to show for 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:46.730
 you can see a little closer 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:49.190
 the cards otherwise we do not see very well 

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:50.570
 with the top the smell hides a little but 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:52.430
 in any case we can see effects and 

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:53.480
 so if we pass the hand I will not go 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:55.520
 do it because that risk is going to undermine a 

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:57.550
 little card but it's fds and 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:59.540
 reflections is enough it's very nice 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:02.540
 yeah so here we can see that it makes 

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:06.550
 circles around pokemon and malia and 

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:08.510
 finally we finish with the mrj ex 170 pv 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:10.910
 so here is the same as earlier 

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:16.010
 except that there she in 145th full art on 

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:18.020
 146 way after so both mega nex 1 

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:20.360
 from the series first the mig wrongly 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:21.350
 so much worse so mtor as ex I know 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:23.180
 not how do you prefer 

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:24.320
 call it pick as long as I think 

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:26.510
 it's better than m thor tank 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:30.620
 in any case the mega evolution of thor 

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:32.390
 tank she is there 220 pv 120 to 120 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:34.580
 attacks I had them in the third 

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:37.640
 part of the display on my channel all 

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:38.750
 very happy it's the 30th out of 146 so 

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:40.760
 they did not put in end of set they 

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:42.740
 put it just behind the turn so much 

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:45.140
 that I believe thoretton chi x this is the 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:45.740
 29th out of 146 and the pick as long as 

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:48.010
 it's the 30th 

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:49.280
 So here are very powerful cards 1 

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:52.280
 220 p 

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:55.340
 and then the mega florise ares ix she 

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:56.870
 knows the second 17 also 230 tv 

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:58.940
 so that's really I think it's 

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:00.919
 a hold that must be the card that has 

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:03.260
 the most paid of all time at the level 

00:06:00.919 --> 00:06:04.910
 pokemon cards I believe that 200 more 

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:07.130
 100 bp already had never happened 

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:09.770
 had to be the wailers obviously and 

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:11.600
 then surely other ix in the block 

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:12.800
 black and white and there frankly with the 

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:16.130
 mega evolution is the first time 

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:17.870
 that we go beyond 200 bp is enough 

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:19.340
 awesome after I do not know myself 

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:21.289
 at all at the strategic level 

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:23.360
 I think it was quite complicated 

00:06:21.289 --> 00:06:24.200
 to put it in place what saw them 

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:27.440
 pv attack him 

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:29.360
 it must not be easy so with a 

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:31.940
 rule of mega evolution so when 

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:34.280
 of your pokemon becomes a mega pokemon 

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:36.050
 evolution your turn would end so 

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:37.550
 obviously 

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:38.930
 it must not be great anyway 

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:40.789
 very nice maps we can see that the 

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:42.199
 illustrations either grew by 

00:06:40.789 --> 00:06:44.810
 compared to the neighborhoods ex so there if I 

00:06:42.199 --> 00:06:46.819
 compare izard flora and 1 mega 

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:49.639
 florise to the illustration is a little 

00:06:46.819 --> 00:06:53.870
 enlarged so here is in any case very 

00:06:49.639 --> 00:06:56.180
 very beautiful go so that was all 

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:57.289
 for its 14 ultra rare there is a little 

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:59.659
 less than in the black and white block one 

00:06:57.289 --> 00:07:00.590
 went up to 16 or even 20 in the 

00:06:59.659 --> 00:07:02.360
 last series 

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:04.099
 in any case I hope this video
