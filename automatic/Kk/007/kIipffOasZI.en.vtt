00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
mistake don't wait too much as soon as

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.530 
mistake don't wait too much as soon as
possible<00:00:53.850> pass<00:00:54.240> him<00:00:55.370> remember<00:00:56.540> overtaking

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:57.540 
possible pass him remember overtaking

success<00:00:58.079> is<00:00:58.410> on<00:00:59.090> inside<00:01:00.090> line<00:01:00.540> in<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:01.170> corner

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:02.600 
success is on inside line in the corner

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.499 
success is on inside line in the corner
so<00:01:03.600> if<00:01:03.870> before<00:01:04.079> the<00:01:04.290> corner<00:01:04.829> you<00:01:05.610> have<00:01:05.640> inside

00:01:06.499 --> 00:01:06.509 
so if before the corner you have inside

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:10.670 
so if before the corner you have inside
line<00:01:06.810> and<00:01:07.200> line<00:01:07.890> up<00:01:08.180> even<00:01:09.180> half<00:01:09.509> cards<00:01:10.140> with
