00:00:20.208 --> 00:00:21.803
 Add to friends. 

00:00:22.772 --> 00:00:24.043
 What are you thinking about? 

00:00:26.011 --> 00:00:27.401
 2 people like this. 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:30.203
 Relationship Status: Single -&gt; In Relationship 

00:00:31.504 --> 00:00:32.500
 Comment. 

00:00:33.731 --> 00:00:35.308
 Confirm. 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:36.408
 Where are you 

00:00:36.409 --> 00:00:37.383
 Where are you? 

00:00:40.694 --> 00:00:41.274
 Today's a slipper 

00:00:41.275 --> 00:00:42.148
 Today is a slipper! 

00:00:52.558 --> 00:00:54.607
 THE HARVARD UNIVERSITY, AUTUMN 2003 - I need to do something great, 

00:00:54.608 --> 00:00:56.217
 to draw attention to student clubs. 

00:00:56.218 --> 00:00:57.860
 - Why? - Because they're exclusive. 

00:00:57.861 --> 00:00:59.946
 They have fun and lead to a better life. 

00:01:02.458 --> 00:01:04.454
 People want to check their friends on the net 

00:01:04.455 --> 00:01:07.728
 So why not make a website that allows it. Friends, photos, profiles ... 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:11.104
 Just take the whole social life in college 

00:01:11.105 --> 00:01:12.052
 and put it on the net. 

00:01:12.053 --> 00:01:15.170
 2 200 people saw the page in two hours? 

00:01:15.171 --> 00:01:17.504
 No, 22,000. 

00:01:17.505 --> 00:01:19.922
 The idea can make millions of dollars. 

00:01:19.923 --> 00:01:21.681
 - Millions?! - You stole our site. 

00:01:21.682 --> 00:01:23.500
 They say we stole them from Facebook. 

00:01:23.501 --> 00:01:25.378
 - I know what's in there. - And it is true? 

00:01:25.458 --> 00:01:27.292
 A million dollars is not cool. Do you know what's cool? 

00:01:27.293 --> 00:01:29.408
 - A billion dollars. - We'll leave you out of it. 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:32.123
 Things go much faster than we could imagine. 

00:01:32.124 --> 00:01:34.033
 We sue him in federal court. 

00:01:34.034 --> 00:01:36.624
 I can't wait to look over your shoulder when writing our check. 

00:01:36.625 --> 00:01:38.303
 If you two invented Facebook ... 

00:01:38.568 --> 00:01:39.532
 ... so you would come up with Facebook. 

00:01:39.533 --> 00:01:41.825
 Would you like to tell me something? 

00:01:41.826 --> 00:01:44.071
 You could have destroyed everything I worked on. 

00:01:44.072 --> 00:01:46.938
 - What we both worked on! - You want them to tighten you up again? 

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:48.035
 Mark! 

00:01:48.132 --> 00:01:49.640
 YOU WILL NOT HAVE TO A 500 MILLION FRIENDS 

00:01:50.052 --> 00:01:51.405
 This is our moment! 

00:01:51.578 --> 00:01:53.179
 WITHOUT THAT YOU MAKE A PAIR OF ANY FRIENDS 

00:01:53.284 --> 00:01:56.199
 You are accused of deliberately violating security 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.854
 copyright infringement 

00:01:57.855 --> 00:01:59.686
 violation of personal freedom ... 

00:02:00.632 --> 00:02:04.642
 Your best friend sues you for $ 600 million. 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:08.047
 Concerning ... 

00:02:08.339 --> 00:02:11.298
 I think I deserve some recognition from this commission. 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.054
 Excuse me? 

00:02:14.275 --> 00:02:15.233
 Yes. 

00:02:15.635 --> 00:02:16.722
 I do not get it. 

00:02:16.936 --> 00:02:18.321
 Which part? 

00:02:18.673 --> 00:02:21.800
