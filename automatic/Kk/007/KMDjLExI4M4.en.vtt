nose and now the flagship td30 which is

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.850 
nose and now the flagship td30 which is
the<00:00:26.490> high-end<00:00:26.850> kit<00:00:27.030> really<00:00:27.780> really<00:00:28.230> does<00:00:28.470> add

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:28.860 
the high-end kit really really does add

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:30.590 
the high-end kit really really does add
a<00:00:28.890> lot<00:00:29.220> to<00:00:29.280> the<00:00:29.610> sound<00:00:29.850> in<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.119> tone

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:30.600 
a lot to the sound in the tone

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.600 
a lot to the sound in the tone
basically<00:00:31.170> the<00:00:31.350> idea<00:00:31.770> really<00:00:32.250> simple

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
basically the idea really simple

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.270 
basically the idea really simple
explanation<00:00:32.789> is<00:00:33.270> like<00:00:33.420> this<00:00:33.629> it<00:00:34.410> just<00:00:34.829> blends

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
explanation is like this it just blends

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.970 
explanation is like this it just blends
the<00:00:35.670> samples<00:00:36.180> together<00:00:36.540> so<00:00:37.020> it<00:00:37.170> just<00:00:37.470> sounds

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
the samples together so it just sounds

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.130 
the samples together so it just sounds
more<00:00:38.160> natural<00:00:38.190> and<00:00:38.910> feels<00:00:39.329> more<00:00:39.570> natural<00:00:39.630> I

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
more natural and feels more natural I

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.080 
more natural and feels more natural I
found<00:00:40.739> that<00:00:41.010> with<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.310> cymbals<00:00:41.730> that<00:00:41.790> laid

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
found that with the cymbals that laid

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.460 
found that with the cymbals that laid
into<00:00:42.390> them<00:00:42.510> like<00:00:42.630> I<00:00:42.720> went<00:00:42.899> with<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.110> cymbal

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:43.470 
into them like I went with the cymbal

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:45.500 
into them like I went with the cymbal
with<00:00:44.130> this<00:00:44.280> like<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.550> drums<00:00:44.820> I<00:00:45.030> kind<00:00:45.270> of<00:00:45.329> hit

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
with this like the drums I kind of hit

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:46.970 
with this like the drums I kind of hit
them<00:00:45.690> like<00:00:45.809> I<00:00:45.899> would<00:00:46.050> a<00:00:46.079> real<00:00:46.290> drum<00:00:46.530> because<00:00:46.890> of
