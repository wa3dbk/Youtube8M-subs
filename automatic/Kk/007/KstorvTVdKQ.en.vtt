when<00:04:21.370> he<00:04:21.489> fought<00:04:21.669> the<00:04:21.700> whole<00:04:22.090> year<00:04:22.270> that'll

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:22.510 
when he fought the whole year that'll

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:24.000 
when he fought the whole year that'll
way<00:04:22.630> was<00:04:22.780> going<00:04:23.020> fairly<00:04:23.289> well<00:04:23.409> he<00:04:23.800> could<00:04:23.979> have

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:24.010 
way was going fairly well he could have

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:25.610 
way was going fairly well he could have
won<00:04:24.190> that<00:04:24.219> fight<00:04:24.610> for

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
won that fight for

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.020 
won that fight for
he<00:04:25.830> just<00:04:26.070> didn't<00:04:26.310> pull<00:04:26.490> the<00:04:26.520> trigger<00:04:26.639> on<00:04:26.970> that

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:27.030 
he just didn't pull the trigger on that

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:29.960 
he just didn't pull the trigger on that
but<00:04:27.570> um<00:04:27.720> I<00:04:28.370> guess<00:04:29.370> it's<00:04:29.550> safe<00:04:29.639> to<00:04:29.699> say<00:04:29.820> that

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:29.970 
but um I guess it's safe to say that

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:32.810 
but um I guess it's safe to say that
Floyd<00:04:30.330> never<00:04:30.510> really<00:04:30.990> looked<00:04:31.110> as<00:04:31.290> best<00:04:31.560> I<00:04:31.830> 154

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:32.820 
Floyd never really looked as best I 154

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:35.420 
Floyd never really looked as best I 154

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:51.270 
and 154 152 or whatever um I don't think

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:53.780 
and 154 152 or whatever um I don't think
that<00:04:51.419> Canelo<00:04:51.750> smarter<00:04:52.410> than<00:04:52.500> both<00:04:52.710> them<00:04:53.010> but<00:04:53.760> I

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:53.790 
that Canelo smarter than both them but I

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:55.460 
that Canelo smarter than both them but I
do<00:04:53.910> think<00:04:54.419> that<00:04:54.600> he<00:04:54.870> is<00:04:54.900> more<00:04:55.020> dangerous

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:55.470 
do think that he is more dangerous

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:57.740 
do think that he is more dangerous
because<00:04:55.770> of<00:04:56.070> his<00:04:56.160> power<00:04:56.400> and<00:04:56.820> because<00:04:57.510> of<00:04:57.630> the

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:57.750 
because of his power and because of the

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:04.860 
up stopping for Mayweather so the simple

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:06.589 
up stopping for Mayweather so the simple
fact<00:06:05.130> like<00:06:05.340> I<00:06:05.550> said<00:06:05.789> that<00:06:06.000> Floyd<00:06:06.240> has<00:06:06.389> never

00:06:06.589 --> 00:06:06.599 
fact like I said that Floyd has never

00:06:06.599 --> 00:06:08.990

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:09.000 
looked this best at you know over one I

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.719 
looked this best at you know over one I
think<00:06:09.419> 147<00:06:10.050> is<00:06:10.139> his<00:06:10.260> best<00:06:10.530> weight<00:06:10.800> once<00:06:11.550> he

00:06:11.719 --> 00:06:11.729 
think 147 is his best weight once he

00:06:11.729 --> 00:06:13.730 
think 147 is his best weight once he
gets<00:06:12.120> out<00:06:12.240> of<00:06:12.389> that<00:06:12.449> you<00:06:13.020> know<00:06:13.110> once<00:06:13.320> once<00:06:13.650> he

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:13.740 
gets out of that you know once once he

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:17.930 
gets out of that you know once once he
goes<00:06:13.860> over<00:06:14.130> 147<00:06:15.470> at<00:06:16.470> that<00:06:16.740> point<00:06:16.979> I<00:06:17.310> don't

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:17.940 
goes over 147 at that point I don't

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:19.520 
goes over 147 at that point I don't
think<00:06:18.180> it<00:06:18.240> looks<00:06:18.360> the<00:06:18.449> best<00:06:18.660> and<00:06:19.110> on<00:06:19.320> top<00:06:19.500> of

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:19.530 
think it looks the best and on top of

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:22.129 
think it looks the best and on top of
that<00:06:19.680> he's<00:06:19.919> 36<00:06:20.490> so<00:06:20.699> you<00:06:21.449> had<00:06:21.599> used<00:06:21.810> to<00:06:21.930> got<00:06:22.110> a
