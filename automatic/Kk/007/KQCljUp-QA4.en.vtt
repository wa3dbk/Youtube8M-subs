00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.620 
cliq will is still nice if i compare
this<00:01:43.290> of<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:43.920> my<00:01:44.759> brother<00:01:44.970> has<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:46.280> the<00:01:47.630> 4g

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
this of the my brother has the the 4g

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.960 
this of the my brother has the the 4g
nano<00:01:48.869> and<00:01:49.380> you<00:01:49.619> know<00:01:49.680> the<00:01:50.250> headphone<00:01:50.549> jack<00:01:50.579> is

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
nano and you know the headphone jack is

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.090 
nano and you know the headphone jack is
on<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.270> right<00:01:51.720> side<00:01:51.930> as<00:01:52.170> this<00:01:52.619> one<00:01:52.799> is<00:01:52.829> on<00:01:53.070> the

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
on the right side as this one is on the

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.870 
on the right side as this one is on the
left<00:01:53.310> side<00:01:53.490> so<00:01:53.759> that's<00:01:53.970> something<00:01:54.149> to<00:01:54.299> compare

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
left side so that's something to compare

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.630 
left side so that's something to compare
yeah<00:01:56.880> so<00:01:57.119> really<00:01:57.899> nice<00:01:58.079> as<00:01:58.460> they<00:01:59.460> have

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
yeah so really nice as they have

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:00.830 
yeah so really nice as they have
built-in<00:01:59.969> speakers<00:02:00.329> so<00:02:00.450> this<00:02:00.600> is<00:02:00.689> probably

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
built-in speakers so this is probably

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.859 
built-in speakers so this is probably
the<00:02:01.020> best<00:02:01.170> nano<00:02:01.469> that's<00:02:01.770> been<00:02:02.009> released<00:02:02.369> up<00:02:02.869> so

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
the best nano that's been released up so

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.749 
the best nano that's been released up so
far<00:02:04.140> they<00:02:04.799> have<00:02:04.920> a<00:02:04.950> lot<00:02:05.159> of<00:02:05.189> features<00:02:05.520> on<00:02:05.640> this

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
far they have a lot of features on this

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.300 
far they have a lot of features on this
nano<00:02:06.000> right<00:02:06.299> here<00:02:06.540> at<00:02:07.380> coverflow<00:02:07.829> you<00:02:08.160> got

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
nano right here at coverflow you got

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.460 
nano right here at coverflow you got
shake<00:02:09.179> to<00:02:09.300> shuffle<00:02:09.330> there's<00:02:10.050> the<00:02:10.229> video

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
shake to shuffle there's the video

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.860 
shake to shuffle there's the video
camera<00:02:10.679> once<00:02:11.009> again<00:02:11.280> the<00:02:11.520> radio<00:02:11.819> radio<00:02:12.629> only

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
camera once again the radio radio only

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.520 
camera once again the radio radio only
works<00:02:13.050> on<00:02:13.170> four

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
works on four

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.460 
works on four
with<00:02:14.069> um<00:02:14.280> headphones<00:02:15.240> in<00:02:15.450> and<00:02:15.600> those<00:02:16.050> the

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
with um headphones in and those the

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.309 
with um headphones in and those the
headphone<00:02:17.310> jack<00:02:17.340> will<00:02:18.290> determine<00:02:19.290> your

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
headphone jack will determine your

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:22.040 
headphone jack will determine your
reception<00:02:20.120> when<00:02:21.120> listening<00:02:21.360> to<00:02:21.600> radio<00:02:21.870> so

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
reception when listening to radio so

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:23.330 
reception when listening to radio so
that<00:02:22.170> I<00:02:22.200> can<00:02:22.290> get<00:02:22.440> kind<00:02:22.709> of<00:02:22.740> frustrating

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
that I can get kind of frustrating

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.380 
that I can get kind of frustrating
sometimes<00:02:24.440> indeed<00:02:25.440> self-will<00:02:26.040> SOGs<00:02:26.910> and<00:02:27.209> etc

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
sometimes indeed self-will SOGs and etc

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.890 
sometimes indeed self-will SOGs and etc
so<00:02:27.750> the<00:02:28.200> mainly<00:02:28.860> the<00:02:29.250> coop<00:02:29.760> new<00:02:30.209> cool<00:02:30.510> features

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
so the mainly the coop new cool features

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.290 
so the mainly the coop new cool features
of<00:02:31.080> the<00:02:31.319> nano<00:02:31.739> I<00:02:32.100> would<00:02:32.700> say<00:02:32.850> are<00:02:33.030> the<00:02:33.120> bigger

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
of the nano I would say are the bigger

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.360 
of the nano I would say are the bigger
screen<00:02:33.690> the<00:02:34.200> nice<00:02:34.350> glossy<00:02:34.620> finish<00:02:35.100> that<00:02:35.220> makes

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
screen the nice glossy finish that makes

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.750 
screen the nice glossy finish that makes
it<00:02:35.459> look<00:02:35.610> nice<00:02:36.800> got<00:02:37.800> that<00:02:37.920> curve<00:02:38.220> design<00:02:38.400> it's

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
it look nice got that curve design it's

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.390 
it look nice got that curve design it's
really<00:02:39.060> thin<00:02:39.440> let's<00:02:40.440> check<00:02:40.590> that<00:02:40.620> out<00:02:40.800> the

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
really thin let's check that out the

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.020 
really thin let's check that out the
video<00:02:41.670> camera<00:02:42.030> is<00:02:42.090> new<00:02:42.209> in<00:02:42.330> the<00:02:42.360> mic<00:02:42.600> speakers

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
video camera is new in the mic speakers

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.720 
video camera is new in the mic speakers
so<00:02:45.030> they<00:02:45.180> it<00:02:45.300> really<00:02:45.600> added<00:02:45.810> a<00:02:46.230> lot<00:02:46.260> of

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
so they it really added a lot of

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.009 
so they it really added a lot of
features<00:02:47.730> in<00:02:47.820> the<00:02:47.970> new<00:02:48.000> update<00:02:48.269> of<00:02:48.630> this<00:02:48.780> nano

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019 
features in the new update of this nano

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:51.290 
features in the new update of this nano
so<00:02:49.650> can't<00:02:50.100> wait<00:02:50.250> to<00:02:50.340> see<00:02:50.489> out<00:02:50.610> what<00:02:50.880> they<00:02:51.030> come

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
so can't wait to see out what they come

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:52.940 
so can't wait to see out what they come
out<00:02:51.450> with<00:02:51.480> next<00:02:51.870> with<00:02:52.200> the<00:02:52.320> sixth<00:02:52.590> generation

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
out with next with the sixth generation

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.680 
out with next with the sixth generation
nano<00:02:53.280> and<00:02:53.700> that's<00:02:53.940> coming<00:02:54.090> out<00:02:54.269> probably<00:02:54.540> in

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
nano and that's coming out probably in

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.560 
nano and that's coming out probably in

September thanks guys for watching just
my<00:02:57.750> review<00:02:58.140> on<00:02:58.170> the<00:02:58.350> nano<00:02:58.970> really<00:02:59.970> short

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:00.269 
my review on the nano really short

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:03.259 
my review on the nano really short
review<00:03:00.630> not<00:03:00.930> too<00:03:01.650> I'm<00:03:02.250> specky<00:03:02.670> or<00:03:02.940> anything
