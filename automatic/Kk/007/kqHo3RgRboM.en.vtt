00:00:16.518 --> 00:00:19.509
 "40 goals" Tactical exercise to remove 40 targets Scattering and assembling tactical tactical exercise 40 Objective: dispersion and assembly. 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.419
 Paula, do a fine workout 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:28.200
 For this service also will 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:30.780
 Works to verify if you have improved 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.838
 Your service, I've seen you play now 

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:37.890
 A little I think you do not throw the ball 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.960
 Like last year, the protective look 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.649
 Service is more stable and I am 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.410
 Sure he gave you more 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:47.868
 Regularity in service, because last year 

00:00:45.408 --> 00:00:49.609
 I remember you threw the ball 

00:00:47.868 --> 00:00:52.368
 And some other things but above all it was 

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:55.129
 This is throwing the ball. I want that 

00:00:52.368 --> 00:00:58.359
 Make 40 serves until you know this 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:01:01.120
 Many players are doing it, Nadal, 

00:00:58.359 --> 00:01:04.329
 Moya has already done his day, that means he is 

00:01:01.118 --> 00:01:06.310
 Practice accuracy and dispersion for you 

00:01:04.328 --> 00:01:09.718
 You will take 10 service in every corner, as you see 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.719
 There are some goals there 

00:01:09.849 --> 00:01:18.439
 To those goals you will take 10 from 10, 10 to T and 10 to T 

00:01:14.328 --> 00:01:21.169
 And 10 out, for 

00:01:18.438 --> 00:01:22.428
 For example, the cutting service is logical 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.100
 Or whatever you want, I want you 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.720
 There is accuracy, let's measure 

00:01:25.099 --> 00:01:30.019
 Dispersion, that means it every time 

00:01:26.718 --> 00:01:33.608
 Let's bounce the ball we'll put the ball 

00:01:30.019 --> 00:01:36.409
 Instead as a brand to see then 10 balls 

00:01:33.608 --> 00:01:38.568
 The dispersion you had 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:40.759
 Did you understand the exercise? 

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:43.778
 Then when you want, it's worth 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.780
 Paula you can start now 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.269
 Quickly 

00:01:52.209 --> 00:01:54.899
 Quickly 

00:02:00.718 --> 00:02:05.699
 This exercise is from the title 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:07.950
 He has this detail and is at the end 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:11.218
 Practice player or player 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:15.240
 This paula case can see where he has 

00:02:11.218 --> 00:02:19.788
 Which works to improve your presentation 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.790
 That is, there is great dispersion 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.449
 It is better to approach already 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:39.330
 Important in these exercises 

00:02:36.658 --> 00:02:41.128
 To accompany a blow, we must continue 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:44.870
 Track the ball with 

00:02:41.128 --> 00:02:44.870
 Racket to guide the ball 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.799
 There was no escort. Paula please see 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:20.100
 Paula hits the ball and just sticks 

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:21.329
 You think you're done, but you do not 

00:03:20.098 --> 00:03:22.378
 It is very important to follow 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:25.380
 Path, follow the path 

00:03:22.378 --> 00:03:27.298
 I mean the arm and the racket 

00:03:25.378 --> 00:03:29.548
 Continue to follow the ball 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.990
 To take it to the site, you must take it 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:32.490
 To the site, the only way to take it 

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:34.950
 To the site is to accompany the ball very well 

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:36.480
 You have to follow the ball 

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:38.849
 You can follow with her arm and also with 

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:40.590
 Body, you can continue to walk if 

00:03:38.848 --> 00:03:41.038
 Do you want to approach you 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:44.069
 You want 

00:03:41.038 --> 00:03:46.108
 The truth is that your whole body projects towards 

00:03:44.068 --> 00:03:48.899
 This address is because of 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:50.860
 The dispersion is very large 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:53.200
 look here 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:56.830
 Great distances, you 

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:59.049
 In the usual 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:01.000
 The areas are good, however 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:05.069
 Must gather a bit, to see if it's in 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:07.318
 This aspect you can achieve, it is worth 

00:04:05.068 --> 00:04:10.259
 This is better now because you are 

00:04:07.318 --> 00:04:12.298
 After the path of the ball and 

00:04:10.258 --> 00:04:14.108
 Makes the ball come closer 

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:17.430
 Paul 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:17.430
 Okay, that's good 

00:04:22.319 --> 00:04:26.959
 That is, you can still continue with the body 

00:04:24.449 --> 00:04:30.817
 A little behind the ball 

00:04:26.959 --> 00:04:30.817
 Take a step forward if you want to 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:36.389
 This is 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:39.949
 Four goals 

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:39.949
 Now it's worth the other side, come on 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:52.199
 Goals are very good and they are three 

00:04:47.949 --> 00:04:52.199
