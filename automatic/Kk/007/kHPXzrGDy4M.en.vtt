00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
just fold it open like this and then you

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.210 
just fold it open like this and then you
can<00:01:58.470> fold<00:01:59.030> the<00:02:00.030> top<00:02:00.210> piece<00:02:00.479> in<00:02:00.689> like<00:02:01.200> so<00:02:01.619> then

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:02.220 
can fold the top piece in like so then

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:03.859 
can fold the top piece in like so then
there's<00:02:02.399> these<00:02:02.549> two<00:02:02.610> little<00:02:03.030> holes<00:02:03.299> in<00:02:03.659> the

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
there's these two little holes in the

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.050 
there's these two little holes in the
kick<00:02:04.049> in<00:02:04.200> the<00:02:04.229> stand<00:02:04.799> then<00:02:05.549> you<00:02:05.670> push<00:02:05.880> those

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
kick in the stand then you push those

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.300 
kick in the stand then you push those
two<00:02:06.299> rubber<00:02:06.509> pieces<00:02:06.780> in<00:02:07.020> there<00:02:07.200> push<00:02:08.009> it<00:02:08.159> down

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
two rubber pieces in there push it down

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.240 
two rubber pieces in there push it down
and<00:02:08.729> it's<00:02:08.879> securely<00:02:09.329> locked<00:02:09.750> into<00:02:09.989> place<00:02:10.250> so

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
and it's securely locked into place so

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.740 
and it's securely locked into place so
here<00:02:11.700> is<00:02:11.849> what<00:02:12.059> the<00:02:12.150> stand<00:02:12.419> looks<00:02:12.659> like

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.710 

and<00:02:16.730> there<00:02:17.730> are<00:02:17.850> some<00:02:18.060> rubber<00:02:18.330> feet<00:02:18.480> at<00:02:18.630> the

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
and there are some rubber feet at the

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.210 
and there are some rubber feet at the
bottom<00:02:18.990> to<00:02:19.140> keep<00:02:19.260> the<00:02:19.440> stand<00:02:19.770> for<00:02:19.950> moving

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
bottom to keep the stand for moving

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:21.680 
bottom to keep the stand for moving
around<00:02:20.400> on<00:02:20.550> your<00:02:20.700> desk<00:02:20.910> or<00:02:21.120> whatever<00:02:21.420> surface

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
around on your desk or whatever surface

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.110 
around on your desk or whatever surface
you're<00:02:21.960> using<00:02:22.220> it's<00:02:23.220> pretty<00:02:23.400> strong<00:02:23.670> material

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
you're using it's pretty strong material

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.670 
you're using it's pretty strong material
it<00:02:24.420> bends<00:02:24.840> a<00:02:24.900> little<00:02:25.170> bit<00:02:25.290> when<00:02:25.560> you're

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
it bends a little bit when you're

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:26.990 
it bends a little bit when you're
pushing<00:02:25.860> it<00:02:26.040> down<00:02:26.190> in<00:02:26.370> the<00:02:26.430> middle<00:02:26.670> but<00:02:26.790> that

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
pushing it down in the middle but that

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.180 
pushing it down in the middle but that
doesn't<00:02:27.300> really<00:02:27.420> matter<00:02:27.800> there<00:02:28.800> are<00:02:28.980> a<00:02:29.010> couple

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
doesn't really matter there are a couple

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:30.950 
doesn't really matter there are a couple
rubber<00:02:29.610> pieces<00:02:29.880> at<00:02:30.120> the<00:02:30.240> top<00:02:30.480> of<00:02:30.510> the<00:02:30.720> stand

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:30.960 
rubber pieces at the top of the stand

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.690 
rubber pieces at the top of the stand
which<00:02:31.140> helps<00:02:31.440> keep<00:02:31.620> your<00:02:31.740> laptop<00:02:32.220> lift<00:02:32.459> it<00:02:32.610> up

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
which helps keep your laptop lift it up

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.699 
which helps keep your laptop lift it up
which<00:02:33.000> helps<00:02:33.360> air<00:02:33.600> flow<00:02:34.020> and<00:02:34.050> it<00:02:34.380> helps<00:02:34.650> keep

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
which helps air flow and it helps keep

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:36.710 
which helps air flow and it helps keep
your<00:02:34.920> keep<00:02:35.100> your<00:02:35.370> heat<00:02:35.820> down<00:02:36.030> a<00:02:36.209> little<00:02:36.540> bit

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
your keep your heat down a little bit

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.660 
your keep your heat down a little bit
and<00:02:36.930> there's<00:02:37.800> also<00:02:37.920> a<00:02:38.040> couple<00:02:38.340> more<00:02:38.430> rubber

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
and there's also a couple more rubber

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.960 
and there's also a couple more rubber
feet<00:02:38.880> in<00:02:39.090> the<00:02:39.180> back<00:02:39.360> for<00:02:39.660> keeping<00:02:40.620> it<00:02:40.770> up<00:02:41.280> right

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
feet in the back for keeping it up right

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.760 
feet in the back for keeping it up right
and<00:02:42.360> so<00:02:42.810> that<00:02:42.959> it<00:02:43.080> doesn't<00:02:43.260> move<00:02:43.410> around<00:02:43.530> very

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
and so that it doesn't move around very

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:46.130 
and so that it doesn't move around very
much<00:02:44.120> so<00:02:45.120> I'm<00:02:45.180> going<00:02:45.300> to<00:02:45.330> go<00:02:45.450> ahead<00:02:45.540> and<00:02:45.690> take

much so I'm going to go ahead and take

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.540 
much so I'm going to go ahead and take
my<00:02:46.440> 15<00:02:47.100> inch<00:02:47.250> macbook<00:02:47.490> pro<00:02:48.590> and<00:02:49.590> I'm<00:02:50.340> going<00:02:50.489> to

stand I have my microphone plugged into
it<00:02:56.280> right<00:02:56.489> now<00:02:56.550> because<00:02:56.880> I'm<00:02:57.000> using<00:02:57.239> audacity

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
it right now because I'm using audacity

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.229 
it right now because I'm using audacity
to<00:02:58.020> record<00:02:58.410> the<00:02:58.590> audio<00:02:59.250> portion<00:02:59.820> of<00:03:00.150> this

the laptop it's lifted up just a little
bit<00:03:11.370> you<00:03:11.700> can<00:03:11.820> see<00:03:11.880> right<00:03:12.030> here<00:03:12.360> this<00:03:13.080> helps

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
bit you can see right here this helps

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.280
