00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
comfortable I didn't think the

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:33.870 
comfortable I didn't think the
conditions<00:02:32.620> were<00:02:32.800> super<00:02:33.310> fast<00:02:33.580> they<00:02:33.790> were

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
conditions were super fast they were

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.060 
conditions were super fast they were
sort<00:02:34.000> of<00:02:34.090> a<00:02:34.210> breezy<00:02:34.900> I<00:02:35.140> ran<00:02:35.290> into<00:02:35.440> both<00:02:35.800> ways

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:36.070 
sort of a breezy I ran into both ways

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:37.380 
sort of a breezy I ran into both ways
and<00:02:36.100> even<00:02:36.490> the<00:02:36.580> wheel<00:02:36.730> is<00:02:36.940> we're<00:02:37.090> commenting

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
and even the wheel is we're commenting

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.240 
and even the wheel is we're commenting
that<00:02:37.450> was<00:02:37.630> a<00:02:37.690> bit<00:02:37.810> of<00:02:37.870> a<00:02:37.930> tough<00:02:38.110> day<00:02:38.290> so<00:02:38.350> I<00:02:38.830> just

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
that was a bit of a tough day so I just

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:40.620 
that was a bit of a tough day so I just
didn't<00:02:39.459> get<00:02:39.550> into<00:02:39.670> any<00:02:39.910> sort<00:02:40.120> of<00:02:40.270> rhythm<00:02:40.420> to

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
didn't get into any sort of rhythm to

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:42.150 
didn't get into any sort of rhythm to
really<00:02:41.020> relax<00:02:41.260> but<00:02:41.560> at<00:02:41.650> the<00:02:41.709> same<00:02:41.890> time<00:02:42.100> I

didn't<00:02:42.340> feel<00:02:42.430> like<00:02:42.490> I<00:02:42.670> was<00:02:42.700> running<00:02:43.000> flat<00:02:43.180> out

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
didn't feel like I was running flat out

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.330
