 Let's see if they saw it, we started chatting 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.710
 be chats we can see the contact here 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.870
 and if we want to eliminate it simply 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.930
 we leave the sunken button and here below 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:02.090
 will go out a choice of a garbage 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:03.890
 let's do it again we perform by 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:06.140
 example or we can enter from the side 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.610
 left here where it says contacts 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.060
 Here he shows us all the contacts 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.530
 we can also leave the button sunk 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.300
 immediately leave us down here one 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.070
 puppy trash 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:18.770
 let's do it also for chats me 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.060
 call for chats and here we have all the 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:23.360
 people with whom we have chatted 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.720
 the last messages we leave the button a 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.250
 day 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:30.030
 here we are going to return 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.960
 let's see the button a god on the image 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.060
 immediately it comes out again here the 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.390
 trash pot we enter the little pot 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.240
 trash 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:40.640
 in this case I deleted the chat as such 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.380
 but it does not delete the contact's profile 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.479
 since when I'm going to eliminate the contact 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.979
 I get another option then we can 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:48.229
 enter again score out of the 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:50.090
 three dashes on the left enter the 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:53.180
 contact option as you will see here the 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:55.850
 contact still exists we click 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:58.340
 here in the contacts option on the 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.290
 image and this time that is when we get 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.750
 this little trash can we click here 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:04.440
 right here we can already eliminate the 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.720
 contact as such 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.310
 you must be very careful with these two 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.280
 options since the first option that 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.920
 it says to eliminate and to ignore so that the 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.310
 another contact can not return them to 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:19.800
 send requests 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:21.630
 to be friends or to add it back to 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.820
 our pin but if we want only 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:26.400
 eliminate it we're just going to 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:28.590
 eliminate only since with the first 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.710
 option the other user can not go back 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:34.620
 invite us to call you here with this 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:37.080
 another phone on the right hand I have the the 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.240
 iphone5 essen and here this side I have the 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:42.570
 another great vote people so that when I 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:46.150
 I give you delete only this one that is here 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:48.579
 no profile picture is the iphone 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.260

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:52.870

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:11.250

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:14.250
