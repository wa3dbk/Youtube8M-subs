always up for a game of side to side

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:43.879 
always up for a game of side to side
this<00:04:41.190> one<00:04:41.460> is<00:04:41.610> from<00:04:41.849> beyond<00:04:42.210> afar<00:04:42.630> how<00:04:43.410> did<00:04:43.680> she

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:43.889 
this one is from beyond afar how did she

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:45.950 
this one is from beyond afar how did she
know<00:04:44.370> about<00:04:44.550> goalkeeper<00:04:45.270> was<00:04:45.449> to<00:04:45.599> be<00:04:45.750> her

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:45.960 
know about goalkeeper was to be her

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:47.629 
know about goalkeeper was to be her
position<00:04:46.470> because<00:04:47.070> you<00:04:47.190> were<00:04:47.310> rubbish

00:04:47.629 --> 00:04:47.639 
position because you were rubbish

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:52.820 
position because you were rubbish
outfield<00:04:48.210> so<00:04:48.360> I<00:04:50.570> do<00:04:51.570> think<00:04:52.020> that<00:04:52.169> at<00:04:52.620> first

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:52.830 
outfield so I do think that at first

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:54.950 
outfield so I do think that at first
ever<00:04:53.130> played<00:04:53.400> in<00:04:53.550> gold<00:04:53.760> because<00:04:53.880> them<00:04:54.240> but

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960 
ever played in gold because them but

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:56.990 
ever played in gold because them but
when<00:04:55.199> I<00:04:55.229> first<00:04:55.770> started<00:04:56.130> it's<00:04:56.310> just<00:04:56.490> a<00:04:56.580> primary

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:57.000 
when I first started it's just a primary

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.719 
when I first started it's just a primary
school<00:04:57.210> and<00:04:57.479> the<00:04:58.110> lads<00:04:58.349> said<00:04:58.800> well<00:04:59.070> you<00:04:59.610> know

00:04:59.719 --> 00:04:59.729 
school and the lads said well you know

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:01.129 
school and the lads said well you know
you<00:04:59.789> can<00:05:00.060> play<00:05:00.240> but<00:05:00.300> you<00:05:00.510> have<00:05:00.630> to<00:05:00.750> buy<00:05:00.870> gold

00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:01.139 
you can play but you have to buy gold

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:03.830 
you can play but you have to buy gold
and<00:05:01.470> so<00:05:02.039> I<00:05:02.370> think<00:05:02.849> you<00:05:03.300> know<00:05:03.419> that<00:05:03.449> kind<00:05:03.810> of

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:03.840 
and so I think you know that kind of

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:05.899 
and so I think you know that kind of
suited<00:05:04.229> me<00:05:04.409> and<00:05:05.039> if<00:05:05.280> it<00:05:05.400> meant<00:05:05.520> I<00:05:05.639> could<00:05:05.669> play

00:05:05.899 --> 00:05:05.909 
suited me and if it meant I could play

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:08.659 
suited me and if it meant I could play
football<00:05:06.120> that's<00:05:06.449> why<00:05:06.720> I<00:05:06.750> did<00:05:06.990> and<00:05:07.669> really

00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:08.669 
football that's why I did and really

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:10.040 
football that's why I did and really
it's<00:05:08.820> kind<00:05:08.849> of<00:05:09.060> do<00:05:09.180> me<00:05:09.330> a<00:05:09.360> favor<00:05:09.599> being<00:05:09.990> a

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:10.050 
it's kind of do me a favor being a

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:12.350 
it's kind of do me a favor being a
goalie<00:05:10.260> from<00:05:10.500> from<00:05:11.010> such<00:05:11.340> a<00:05:11.490> young<00:05:11.520> age<00:05:11.699> but
