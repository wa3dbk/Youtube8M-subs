bolts<00:02:15.379> through<00:02:15.530> the<00:02:15.590> frame<00:02:15.680> here

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
bolts through the frame here

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.729 
bolts through the frame here
in<00:02:16.610> here<00:02:17.090> I<00:02:17.239> may<00:02:17.629> had<00:02:17.720> to<00:02:17.870> fabricate<00:02:18.500> up<00:02:18.620> a

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:18.739 
in here I may had to fabricate up a

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:21.880 
in here I may had to fabricate up a
bracket<00:02:19.160> to<00:02:19.310> mount<00:02:19.430> it<00:02:20.140> but<00:02:21.140> both<00:02:21.290> sides<00:02:21.530> are

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
bracket to mount it but both sides are

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.880 
bracket to mount it but both sides are
secure<00:02:22.459> and<00:02:22.640> in<00:02:23.269> the<00:02:23.360> proper<00:02:23.720> spot<00:02:23.989> the<00:02:24.739> only

secure and in the proper spot the only

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.890 
secure and in the proper spot the only
thing<00:02:25.040> I'm<00:02:25.129> going<00:02:25.250> to<00:02:25.310> change<00:02:25.610> today<00:02:25.849> is<00:02:26.269> this

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
thing I'm going to change today is this

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.320 
thing I'm going to change today is this
pedal<00:02:27.650> it's<00:02:28.310> supposed<00:02:28.700> to<00:02:28.849> be<00:02:29.000> the<00:02:29.120> brake

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
pedal it's supposed to be the brake

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.150 
pedal it's supposed to be the brake
pedal<00:02:29.780> but<00:02:29.930> a<00:02:29.989> brake<00:02:30.290> on<00:02:30.500> the<00:02:30.650> right<00:02:30.860> side

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
pedal but a brake on the right side

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.350 
pedal but a brake on the right side
doesn't<00:02:32.060> make<00:02:32.180> any<00:02:32.390> any<00:02:32.900> sense<00:02:33.290> so<00:02:33.489> I'm<00:02:34.489> going

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
doesn't make any any sense so I'm going

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.900 
doesn't make any any sense so I'm going
to<00:02:35.510> convert<00:02:35.900> this<00:02:36.260> pedal<00:02:36.739> into<00:02:37.010> my<00:02:37.370> throttle

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
to convert this pedal into my throttle

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.020 
to convert this pedal into my throttle
pedal<00:02:38.090> to<00:02:39.049> operate<00:02:39.080> my<00:02:39.590> carburetors<00:02:40.280> so<00:02:40.879> I'm

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
pedal to operate my carburetors so I'm

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:42.850 
pedal to operate my carburetors so I'm
going<00:02:41.180> to<00:02:41.209> pull<00:02:41.390> these<00:02:41.540> back<00:02:41.599> off<00:02:42.080> and<00:02:42.440> come<00:02:42.739> up

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
going to pull these back off and come up

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.570 
going to pull these back off and come up
with<00:02:43.040> a<00:02:43.610> cable<00:02:44.530> modification<00:02:45.530> that'll<00:02:46.400> go<00:02:46.549> up

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
with a cable modification that'll go up

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.729 
with a cable modification that'll go up
there<00:02:46.910> to<00:02:47.090> the<00:02:47.209> carbs<00:02:47.720> but<00:02:48.230> I've<00:02:48.349> got<00:02:48.530> the

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:48.739 
there to the carbs but I've got the

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:52.059

figure out how to hook it up somehow so

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:07.930 
figure out how to hook it up somehow so
when<00:03:06.319> you<00:03:06.440> step<00:03:06.680> on<00:03:06.860> the<00:03:06.980> gas<00:03:07.010> it<00:03:07.489> pulls<00:03:07.730> the

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
when you step on the gas it pulls the

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:10.479 
when you step on the gas it pulls the
cable<00:03:08.390> have<00:03:08.629> this<00:03:09.230> all<00:03:09.769> figured<00:03:09.799> out<00:03:10.280> and

might<00:03:45.709> need<00:03:45.859> to<00:03:45.919> shorten<00:03:46.400> that<00:03:46.519> cable<00:03:47.000> and

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200 
might need to shorten that cable and

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.539 
might need to shorten that cable and
possibly<00:03:48.200> post<00:03:48.380> a<00:03:48.530> video<00:03:48.680> on<00:03:48.980> how<00:03:49.099> to<00:03:49.130> do<00:03:49.340> that
